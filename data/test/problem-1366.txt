Draco shook his head, "Did what?" he asked as he finished pouring his drink and putting the jug away. He sipped it a bit before sitting down.
Defeated he sat back down on his bed and glared at the floor. He had to come up with some plan to dress normally, or it would ruin his mood. He could do what he did last night, but the jeans he had used where extremely baggy on him. One of the hand-me-downs he still had from Dudley. Minutes passed by as he tried to come up with some form of a plan, only coming to the same conclusion over and over.
"Why?! I asked you NOT to bring him into this. Why couldn't you just respect my wishes," Snape snapped.
“I don’t know, I feel like that was my Dad though. I know you guys loved him, but I don’t want anything I do to affect that part of your memories of him,” Harry stated. Sirius nodded, reaching a hand out to ruffle Harry’s hair.
Draco sucked in a shaky breath and stood up with wobbly legs. Severus was there to steady him, keeping a hand on his shoulder.
Lord Harry LeFay cleared his throat, “We are gathered currently to duel out both punishment and to question one Cadmael Greyback, formerly known as Hati Greyback. Any objections?” The room remained quiet except for Cadmael ragged breathing. “Good, now, August, produce the evidence,” Harry commanded, waving his hand for August to step forward. “Severus, administer the Veritaserum.”
“Okay. I do, why?” Harry asked as he started setting up his bed so that he would be comfortable. Since kitsune said it would take a long time he wanted to be as comfortable as possible.
Snape wanted badly to hug his godson but he didn’t think it was right. He lifted his head, eyes narrowed in on Sirius and Remus. Both looked like they were on the verge of tears.
Draco stood at LeFay's desk for a moment and then set the vile of memories on his desk. "The evidence dissolved before I could capture a photo of it, so I pulled out the memories of it. I swear that they aren't tampered with," he paused, "You where right though. He isn't as dead as it would seem." Draco motioned to the memories.
“Really?” Harry asked in surprise. Remus sighed but nodded and rolling his eyes as he ruffled between Harry's ears. Both Sirius and Remus watched in amusement as Harry finished his inspection off. Playing with his snout and teeth before finally glancing back up at his fathers as they laughed. He then remembered what Remus had said. Something about magical blocks, and he still wanted to know how long he had been out for.
Draco looked at the hand, confused for a moment before his father took him by the arms and helped him stand.
Hogwart’s wards finally gave out, shattering with a loud boom. Harry and the others didn’t stop to figure out what caused it.
"What about you August, William?" he asked, his attention turning to his two trusted immortal brothers. Both shook there heads no, letting there heads fall back down into a bow as they felt the air crackle around them. "What about the packs?" LeFay growled through clenched teeth, trying hard to keep his calm. Ammit really shouldn't have been gone this long.
“Lady Malfoy is waiting for you down stairs. She wishes you to be down within the next five minutes,” the house elf stated. Draco groaned but nodded and waved the house elf off. He could never remember their names, but he knew that this one was one of the few staying with them. He still couldn’t believe they were going to live with the Blacks of all people. Though, his mother did say that the Blacks where the closest thing they had to family left. With Lucius in Azkaban what else could they do? They had lost pretty much everything.
He added as he looked at his reflection in the mirror, seeing a ghostly reflection of his dragon half in the reflection behind him. Smoke rolled out of the dragon’s nostrils as it listened to him.
Closing his eyes he felt for out Tatsuya within his mind, connecting with him as they slipped into their Kitsune form. Their minds now as one.
The door opened slowly opened, revealing a thin woman with bright red eyes. Draco took a step back, smiling nervously. “Contacts?” he asked, trying to remember the little bits of muggle things Harry had told him in their youth. The woman just stared at him before opening the door wider.
The group progressed slowly, their eyes flicking back and forth across the trail. Charlie crouched behind a large rock at the curve of the trail and motioned for everyone to get down. Charlie motioned them forward just a bit so they could see around the rock the crouched behind.
“Come on then, let’s get this over with,” he grumbled. Draco made his way into the room as Harry grabbed a simple shirt and pulled it on. He avoided looking Harry’s way, and then turned to face him. He suddenly felt like he had just entered the liar of something evil and cunning. Just waiting for him to make the wrong move before leaping and devouring him. Harry had truly changed, or maybe he had always been like this and Draco just hadn’t been observant enough to notice.
“I’m quite alright. Though I’d advise you not to do it again,” he growled. Harry snickered at the back of the group along with Bill, both smiling like madmen. Remus rolled his eyes and then took in their surroundings.
Snape frowned. There was a gasp from the door way and Severus turned just in time to see a blonde head disappear from view.
Draco looked up from his spot on the steps, pillows surrounding him as he leaned his head against the LeFay thrown. “Patience. For how much that man does for you, and how much trust you put in him, I’m sure he’ll come through. Is everyone else here?” Draco murmured in a low tone so that only his mate could hear him.
Harry scoffed but slowly lifted his hand. The dragon winced almost nervously, or expecting pain. Harry frowned but continued until his hand rested of the middle of the dragon’s face.
Draco finds himself up against Cadmael. A jaguar beastman that's been playing the group for a while now.
It had been three days since the Malfoy’s moved in, and nothing was going Draco's way. For starters, his mother made him help with Harry’s lessons. Lessons he should have learned from the day he could walk. Along with that Draco also had to help him with potions, under instruction from Snape of course, but it didn’t make him feel any better.
Harry smiled, "That must be why he liked Neville's snack bar so much. It was candied lemon and lime." He patted Ghost's side then, trying to get the animal to stop growling. Ghost huffed with every pat and eventually stopped growling but didn't lay his head down. Instead he stood up and shook himself side to side and then jumped off the bed. Harry watched as the albino animal let out a big yawn and started sniffing around the room. "At least now I know what I'll need to feed him, thanks Herm."
“Oh, no, don’t be shy,” Hisashi purred, and Draco felt claws on the back off his neck, gently wrapping around his jaw till it tilted his head up, forcing him to stare into the golden eyes above him. “Stay a while, perhaps you’ll be able to convince our
First there had been attacks by the death eaters a few towns over, flooding Hogsmead with survivors, then Ginny confronted him about how he'd been acting lately. Harry, being cornered by Ginny at the time, was forced to tell her the truth about him being gay, and then this. Draco was dead and was more than likely Harry's fault. It was always his fault.
Harry put the letter down again before standing up and grabbing Draco by his shoulder. “What are you getting so worked up over?”
Harry opened his eyes and sat up as Draco's movements and Charlie's yelling stopped. Looking down he could see Charlie and the group standing in the grass with pale faces. He was confused unil Charlie cleared his throat and pointed behind Harry. He gulped and turned his head slowly, coming face to face with a very angry looking dragon. Harry felt his stomach flip. “Hel-l-llo Draco,” Harry chuckled nervously.
“Thank you all for coming earlier than expected of students. As many of you know, there has been an influx of students inheriting creature statuses. Those of you here are either of that status, or you are that students support. Some of you may be having trouble controlling your ‘creature features’,” McGonagall paused and looked over at Harry, “anyone that is having this problem will be expected to attend a study hall after classes in the transfiguration classroom. Now as for all of you, there will be another set of rules for those with creature inheritances and their supports on top of class rules. This is for your safety as well as the safety of the other students and staff. They will be posted here in the hall for everyone to look back over if need be.” Her voice echoed for a moment in the hall before she cleared her throat to continue.
Draco nodded, but his focus wasn’t on the conversation. It was set on letting his eyes wander over LeFay’s body.
Harry pulled himself out of the pensive, hands gripping the sides tightly. Albus twisted Cadmael in the same ways he’d done him. Tricked him and then tampered with his memories so all he knew of Albus was the sweet old man persona. He growled low before glancing at the other viles next to the pensive. He did want to look through them, he didn’t have the energy or the endurance too.
Harry pointed at the dragon’s neck then and made the same pulling motion. Draco eyed him, eyes narrowing before lifting his head to fully extend his thick neck. Draco set his head down again on the ground but kept it extended out so that Harry could get to the arrow shafts. The arrows came out much easier and it wasn’t long before Harry managed to pull them all. Bowing Harry turned from the dragon and started walking back to the group only to have a tail smash down in front of him, blocking his path.
Harry goes to be tutored by Snape only to find something else waiting there for him, and a big decision to make. Does he help Draco or does he refuse?
“Lord LeFay please. We want to do this. If it protects your- no, our family, we are willing,” Narcissa stated firmly as she walked over to Harry. He looked at her, puzzled, and even looked over at Draco who only nodded as his grey eyes never left Harry’s. Harry looked back at Sirius and huffed a little but walked up to the alter.
LeFay sat down with the book and started flipping through its pages slowly, letting his eyes skim over ever word.
LeFay felt a strong sense of pride when Draco spoke, but also guilt. Bowing low Draco turned and then left the room quickly, leaving LeFay to his thoughts. Sitting down he lifted a hand to his face, rubbing his forehead. If only Draco knew what he actually thought..."He's proved himself worthy many times over," he mumbled under his breath with a sigh.
Draco lifted his scaly head, nudging Harry’s naked body and causing him to stumble a bit. “So, how long do you plan on staying like that?” Harry asked, crossing his arm over his chest. Draco snorted, glancing around before he stretched, and stood from his position. He stretched out his wings as he looked for a spot in the maze clearing that would be large enough for him to stretch out completely in. He found one, a bit of an awkward fit around the gazebo but it was enough for him to lay out on his side and sun his scales.
"Fine.  We should be leaving though, there is another circle meeting this morning and Ammit should be returning shortly," LeFays stated as he stood, dusting any crumbs off himself. "I wanted you to attend. Perhaps you'll be able to add some incite the other cannot." Draco nodded and stood, following LeFay out of the room.
The next morning Harry was awoken to a very loud bang from downstairs. He sat bolt upwards only to fall back down on the bed as his vision blackened. He panicked for a moment until he realized it was coming back slowly. This time he sat up more carefully. That’s when he heard the yelling downstairs and another loud bang. He grabbed his wand and headed towards the attic door, opening it cautiously as he heard another loud bang. This time he could pinpoint the noise and yelling coming from the sitting room and slowly he crept his way towards the room. When he got to the end of the hall and peeked in he relaxed completely. Remus was chasing an animagus Sirius around the room, knocking over pictures and vases as his Grim form bounced around. Harry laughed, catching the attention of the two and making them stop in their tracks. This was the first time they had heard Harry laugh in a long while.
Harry got to the kitchen just as breakfast finished and everyone was dishing up. He sat down at the head of the table and did the same, all the while avoiding eye contact with Draco and Sirius.
the kitsune stated. Harry chuckled lightly as he set his wand on the ground and started petting Ammit’s head. He closed his eyes, hoping that if he meditated now he might be able to see his kitsune.
Sirius nodded his sudden understanding before falling in line behind Harry and Remus as they all headed to the will reading. When they stepped into the room, and the doors closed behind them, they were surprised to see all the people that were summoned to the will reading. Severus Snape, Neville Longbottom, and his grandmother Augusta Longbottom, and, to his astonishment, Narcissa was there as well. Draco, however, was nowhere to be seen.
Albus bit his tongue to keep from replying. That lossy goblin, he’d paid many people off in the Wizengamot to give him the power to keep these wills closed. Now that death eater had to somehow survive and ruin it. He had no proof, but the fact he’d been pronounced dead for so many years after Albus’ plot to have him killed; it had more than solidified his suspicions. Now the man was suddenly back? No. It had to be some kind of trick.
“Bloody hell…,” he mumbled as he leaned back and stared up at the ceiling, throwing his hands up behind his head. He decided to go ahead and quickly letter back, showing his gratitude for the help. Well not help so to say, but for a push to do something for a change. After the war, he'd lost what made him, him. After he finished he looked over at Bubo, about to call for the owl till he saw him nuzzled up in his feathers fast asleep. He sighed and shrugged his shoulders, deciding the letter could wait.
Months later and he was telling Albus about everything he’d found. Surprisingly, Albus had seemed relieved to find that Harry was alive and well, but then their conversation had turned rather dark. While Harry listened in and watched the memory he could vaguely tell the memory was tampered with. Waving his wand, a part of the memory changed, and Albus was yelling, and cursing while Cadmael laid stunned on the ground. A deep bruise and scratch across Cadmael’s cheek. Harry’s brows rose, remembering then a night when Hati, Cadmael.l had returned home late one night saying that it had been a scrap during a training session with one of the wolf pack. So this is where he had actually gotten the injury. He couldn’t tell what Albus was saying in the memory, just saw the feet shuffling back and forth as the old headmaster paced.
"Draco no! If you do that Hades will take the both of you!" Harry was confused, where was that voice coming from?
"I'm fine now Ghost, it was just a nightmare..." Harry managed to say twenty minutes later when he'd stopped sobbing. "I'm sorry that I woke you boy," Harry stated as he reached up and scratched behind the striped hyena's ear. "I should have honestly warned you since they are so frequent...sorry," Harry added guiltily. Draco tilted his head, confused. He understood that nightmares couldn't be controlled so why was Harry apologizing?
Harry startled himself awake, clawing at his blankets like he had been clawing at the air while he was falling in his dream. He was panting as he sat up and then lifted his hand to wipe at his brow. It was the first of the two days the headmistress gave him to become an animagus, and already it wasn’t going very well. He had practice last night with help from Hermione and Theo who had stayed with him last night. Looking around he noticed the two were already gone, which didn’t surprise him. He looked at the other side of the bed and sighed, laying his hand on the blankets there.
“That’s possible,” Charlie stated as he stood up. “Right now would actually be a good time to start trying to unravel those spells. Help me would you,” Charlie added. Bill nodded and each of them took positions and started inspecting that web of colorful spells. Bill started a with a few counter curses and reversals.
Just as Draco went to take a picture for evidence the body disintegrated, the ring in his hand burning his skin. He dropped both his wand and ring, cradling his scolded hand. He glared down at the ring in disdain as it too dissolved in a puff of black smoke and ash. He'd have to show LeFay his memories for proof, and he wasn't very happy about it. He wanted to know LeFay-Harry more but the thought of him rolling around in his head looking for memories made him sick to his stomach.
"That's ridiculously cool," Theo grinned and high-fived Neville as he sat down on the bed. Hermione scowled at both the boys before sitting down beside them. Harry snickered a little before focusing his attention on Luna.
"I think only two of you have been up here so, welcome to my abode," Harry smiled and stretched his arms wide. There was a hoot from the owl perch and Budo looked over them with interest. Theo leaped face first onto Harry's bed with a loud oof. Shaking her head Hermione sat down on the bed, patting Theo's back. Neville and Luna climbed up onto the other side, shaking their heads.
“Hey, I’m alright” Harry put a hand on his shoulder and smiled at Draco “My glasses got some of it, so it’s okay, I’m alright”
“I know” Harry sighed, cupping his face and kissing his forehead, he loved when Harry kissed his face, he never seem to stop doing it “As long as you’re with me, I’ll be fine”
He mumbled as he was out of breath, Harry finally pulled out and the moment he did, Draco craved for it again, he just couldn’t help it.
Han, for your observation, which is correct, by the way” Pansy exclaimed and Hannah nodded at her before smiling at Draco and walked away
Draco paused when he heard some noises from outside. It was two in the morning, who could it be? Draco shrugged and opened the door to the kitchen cabinet to grab a mug.
“I wanna go dance, anyone wanna dance?” Ginny stood up with a frown on her face, Draco slowly put Harry’s cock inside his jeans and zipped it up again
“I can’t believe Blaise let you have your anniversary for free at his resort” Draco huffed out a laugh
“Snots and everything” Ron added and threw the clothes behind the kitchen counter, he stood next to Pansy and smiled at both of them “To the point I could throw up”
“Oh…er” Potter looked at him for a second before shaking his head with a sigh “It’s just…you can forget about it”
“Thank you” He couldn’t say it enough, Draco stood up and looked at his father “Thank you too, father” He watched as his father’s dagger glares slowly softened up, he breathed in deep and gave Draco a quick nod before looking the other way.
He said he’ll see you two tomorrow” Ron walked back to the spot next to Pansy and nodded at them “Trust me, Theo is a brilliant Healer and he will bring the potions to Draco later”
” He heard Ron reassured his husband and heard the Floo flared up. Ron wrapped his arm around Harry’s shoulder and they kept walking until he heard the door of the lift being opened with a ding.
“Well, after the war, your family is the only left that didn’t become Death Eaters” Draco said, pointing out the truth, Blaise also didn’t become a Death Eater, but he refused the spot and replaced himself with Pansy. Recently, McGonagall had called in four people from each House to have a serious meeting about House Unity, though Draco wasn’t sure what it was about, he only knew Pansy was one of them, along with Granger from Gryffindor, Padma Patil from Ravenclaw and Hannah Abbott from Hufflepuff “And I guessed she chose all the Prefects”
Potter nodded, settling down next to Draco, they were inches apart, their robes were the only thing that touched. They both folded their legs together on the bed, staring out at the sky through the window, none of them spoke, it was nice like this.
’, you sounded pretty smug then” She tried to mimic his voice, which totally didn’t sound like him at all “I thought you were wrong,
“Sod off” He murmured, ignoring the fact that his heart was racing the moment Potter pulled him against his body
“You know what I mean, Hermione” Draco rolled his eyes and shook his head, putting his wine glass back on the table nearby “I know what you’re doing, you’re going to make me kiss Potter”
Harry frowned down at the animal and tugged on the animal's ear. Ghost apparently wasn't pleased as he swung his head around and snapped at Harry's hand.
Draco squinted at the potion as it finished cooling and then tipped it back against his lips. The taste was beyond foul, and he had half a mind to spit it, but this was his only way out. Closing his eyes he finished swallowing it and then stuck his tongue out, shaking his head from side to side.
So if you haven't read my other fanfiction, there is a notice there that both of these fanfictions are not dead. You can read my excuses there if you like, but basically (like all things) life happened. Ha, ha.
“This big boy kept escaping the cages they’d kept ‘em in, so as punishment they tried starving him. Trying to treat him like your average snake they were, that was till he popped ‘em,” he chuckled and grinned. “They brought him back after that, wouldn’t even tell me why till another couple came in and told me ‘bout it.”
"You did try to kill us all at one point or another," Draco snapped. He looked up sharply when he did and then cleared his throat, "Sorry, I mean-"
“How about you take the bags to our rooms,” she suggested. Draco looked between his mother and Remus before standing up and nodding.
“LEFAY!” he shouted, stumbling before catching himself and continuing to run. There was a tingling along his neck and the collar grew warm as Draco fell forward, rolling down the hill into a large pile of leaves.
"Perfect, just letting my hair down," Draco stated before letting LeFay's hand go to head for his own clothes. LeFay eyed him warily but didn't say anything as he finished getting dressed.
“Why are you staring at me?” Draco questioned as he lifted his eyes from his classes. He could tell Harry's eyes still had the same look as earlier; a hungry, eerie green.
Draco thought back to his mentor. He lifted his hand to his chest and gripped his shirt tight, shaking his head.
Hermione gave him a worried look before returning to the book she was taking notes from; making sure Ron didn't get any food on it either.
“I might, if he lets me…,” he paused. Bill frowned at Charlie who simply shrugged before Harry started gingerly making his way over to Draco, smiling slightly. When he finally stood before the black dragon its head turned to look at him. “Hey…um…I’m just going to pull the other spears out,” Harry stated, pointing at the spears and making a tugging motion.  The dragon seemed to regard him with interest before lowering his head to the ground and huffing. Harry stepped around Draco's head to his hind quarts and stepped up to the first spear. He looked back at the dragon, watching the big violet eyes blink slowly at him. Harry took that as a sign and grabbed the first spear with both hands, tugging hard.
As the second battle of Hogwarts starts, Harry, Snape, and Draco try to counter the attacking ex-Death Eaters. Yet as they move in Draco seems to be the only one able to make a move. That is until Harry makes a very unexpected move, one that leaves all of the wizarding world in an uproar.
Draco stepped in and cleared his throat, holding a vile in his hands. LeFay narrowed his eyes and then motioned for Draco to come over to his desk. "What is it?" LeFay asked.
Draco and Narcissa are settling in, that is until the boys came home from shopping and all hell breaks loose as well as a few tempers. Of course, there's always that one person that seems to make everything better.
Draco pulled his head away and lowered himself into the snow, giving LeFay a way to climb up onto Draco's back.
“What is it Harry? We need to get started on our preparations,” she asked as she looked at him over her spectacles.
Tatsuya went quiet, but LeFay could feel the anger rolling just beneath his ancestor's surface. He sighed, knowing they would have to talk about this sooner or later. Now was just as good as time as any.
“There will always be someone out there hungry for power," Draco said, "Take Grindelwald for instant, he even came before Voldemort, and I’m sure there was many before even him.” Draco couldn’t help the shudder that enveloped him when he said the Dark Lord’s name.
Draco lowered his head, pressing the tip of his snout against LeFay's face and letting out a slow breath. LeFay's hair shifted around his face, causing the older man to smile slightly as he brought a hand up to press it against Draco's snout.
“So, wait, run that by me again,” Sirius said. They all sat around a small fire as the sun was fading after Harry told them what was going on. Parvati had returned to her witch form and snuggled under one of the blankets Bill had brought.
Draco lifted himself up onto his elbows, watching LeFay dress as the robe slid over his back, barely catching on the raised flesh. "How many of those are new?" Draco asked, eyes squinted into slits.
Tatsuya walked over to a waterfall at the back of the glade. Its waters' glowing from glittering silver-blue, metal, rock face it fell from.
August raised an eyebrow, agreeing with William silently. LeFay wasn't the one to call anything in last minute.
“I thought Ron would have been here too,” Harry said quietly. Hermione shrugged slightly and then pulled over another chair from an unused bed so she could actually sit down.
Tatsuya watched over the boy, his thoughts stirring. He moved within the room, his dark silhouette plastered over the walls in the moonlight. ‘This boy, he is special,’ he thought to himself. ‘This LeFay will be like non-other, and I will make him more. This I promise, this I swear...’
Draco sighed and rolled his eyes before heading into the kitchen where he found Harry gorging on an apple he’d dipped in a mixture of peanut butter and honey. Seeing Draco enter, Harry stopped mid bite and eyed him for a bit before setting the slice down. “You ever notice that arguing makes you hungry?” Harry asked.
Draco stood wide eyed, his body trembling at the sheer force of magic that had been released when LeFay lost his temper. The hair on his body felt like they all had tiny electric currents running through them, and he...kind of liked it. Licking his lips he looked away from LeFay, unable to meet his gaze now as he took a step back from the desk. "I-I deserve a chance to know the real you. I can decide for myself if the pain is too great," he managed to get out.
When they got to the kitchen it was all but abandoned, only a note lay next to some sweet rolls on the counter. Draco walked past it to the coldbox, opening it to look for something he could drink.
Albus watched Severus closely as he spoke, his hand lifting to his beard, stroking it slowly. "I see you're point now, but honestly I didn't think you would be so intensive in choosing such an animal," he stated.
This truly was an amazing place, though, he had trouble believing it really existed in his mind. Maybe he could visit here again after he found kitsune. If he ever did find him this is.
Harry nodded however at Hermione's question and laid his hand down onto Ghost's mane, gripping it slightly. Draco blinked, his head lifting up in response to the action and he looked up at Harry. "Well, I'll see you later tonight," Harry stated and then turned. Draco turned with him, if only to make sure his fur wasn't pulled in Harry's tight grip on his mane. It grew tighter even as they walked towards the door and only loosened once they where on the stairs. Draco walked beside Harry patiently but he was starting to feel a bit worried about his knew charge. Could he call him that? Draco lifted one of his lips in a slight snarl. It didn't matter, what did matter was why Harry had tensed up like he had, and what happened between him and Ginny. Normally he would say it was non of his business, but now it was. He'd rather know so he could help Harry if need be than get caught in the crossfire between some feud on accident.
“You’re going to add him to your mate bond, so soon? It will weaken you both, are you sure you two can do this?” Severus asked in a hushed voice.
Harry LeFay meets with his councilor and Draco. After being keyed into the ward LeFay and Draco have an awkward conversation before Draco is one his way.
LeFay grunted and rolled his eyes as he finished organizing the pile he was focused on. "This isn't his business being stuck in this back and forth battle."
"I didn't mean to scare you, it's just. Eh," the man scratched the back of his head and half smiled.
"Harry? Harry! Come on, wake up. You can't leave us like this," came a soft male voice. It seemed full of worry, grief, as they spoke.
Severus comes up with a plan to protect both Draco and Harry in one go, but it will be painful for at least one of them.
“Tell them that for now Cadmael is under supervised treatment, he’s still a prisoner but something he said before passing out makes me think that he may not be under his own control,” Harry said as he began to walk away.
‘Dear brother, if you are reading this you have finally been able to crawl out from under Dumble-dorks thumb and are starting out on your own. I spelled this block to keep you safe from him; on the request of our mother of course. Creature inheritances are extremely rare as it likes to skip generations until it finds the right host. I hope you are doing well- Regulus.”
"I hope you aren't trying to find a weak spot. Cross any one of them down there and you'll have the rest upon you withing seconds."
Dark red eyes finally left his as the man headed towards the kitchen. He let out the breath he'd been holding and maneuvered himself so he could half face the strangers while sitting down beside the fire. The heat felt nice as he realized how tired he was, taking the moment to lean against the wall and rest his eyes.
LeFay sneered. His gaze flicked over to the mirror hanging on the wall when Draco pointed out that he wasn’t alone. Tatsuya stood in the mirror's reflection, his eyes turning to look at LeFay. Without thinking LeFay's magic formed like a whip and shattered the mirror. The pieces falling to the floor with a loud clatter.
“What? Charlie is right. It’s honestly his choice,” Sirius sighed, looking back at Harry with a small grin on his face.
he said and motioned at the pool of water. Harry obeyed and knelt by the water’s edge, cupping it to his lips and taking a sip. It felt cool against his lips and he felt it move throughout his body, leaving him tingly. He laid down beside the water to rest, and started to feel his eye lids droop.
Days passed without any sign of LeFay, and Draco’s patience was wearing thin. He thought that at least after he was healed, he would be able to catch LeFay to talk to him, but anytime he’d asked to speak to him he’d been refused access. Snape even seemed disturbed by the fact Draco and LeFay hadn’t spoken since the contestment. It was pissing him off, and yea, at first he didn’t want to talk to LeFay. Especially when he realized he’d gone to Cadmael rather than him, but it was past that now. It had been days, almost a week. And while Severus did tell him that LeFay had a lot to straighten out right now, along with figuring out the full connection between Cadmael and Albus but this? This was just too much, especially after they’d fucked like that. Draco wheezed slightly, blush creeping across his chest and covering his face in crimson. Oh yea, that night had been.
Jariss stirred to the front of Draco's thoughts and chuckled. The dragon beneath his skin smirked in amusement as he spoke,
"Draco, I'm sorry. I am so sorry I made you go though this. I am not the Harry you know, and I understand you want to know me, but if you keep pushing this. How do I know you aren't going to decide it's too much?" LeFay said, his eyes tearing up. He really didn't want to open this can but it had to be done.
"That's the last of everything we have to report on our end," Douglas stated before bowing his end. Holding this kneeling position took a toll on everyone after a while but, like everyone else, they didn't want to disturb their Lord while in one of his moods. Everyone in the room could feel it, even Draco who stood at the end of the hall by the double doors. LeFay hadn't permitted him to be closer due to him possibly becoming a distraction to his circle members. The question's they'd ask if LeFay had Draco at his feet would have been non stop.
Bill nodded and went to go get the door. He was instantly rushed by Remus and Sirius as they made their way over to the bed. Both turned into mother hens and started doting on Harry, looking him over and asking if he was okay. The other four adults started to head out, not wanting to get in the way of the family.
“Sorry, mister dragon. Sorry that I woke you up by pulling a spear from your back. I was only trying to help,” Harry apologized, keeping his eyes on the dragon. The dragon continued glaring at him for a moment before softening. Then it was moving toward Harry with open jaws and Harry squeezed his eyes shut as the group started yelling. Suddenly he was dangling in the air, and when a minute passed, and he didn’t feel any pain, he opened his eyes only to see himself dangling over the grass. Eyes wide he started wiggling. “Put me down yea over grown lizard!” Harry yelled. He stopped struggling when he suddenly felt a breeze at the back of his neck form the dragon snorting. After he'd stopped he was slowly set down on the ground.
The man looked at it curiously as he pulled it off the wall and set it on the counter. “Curious,” he said.
“It’s amazing,” Harry commented from behind Black as Sirius took the ring and slipped it onto his finger. Almost instantly the ring resized to fit Sirius’ finger and Sirius could feel the power coiling around his wrist and seeping into his veins. The ring was made of a dark metallic substance that he didn’t recognize, with a ruby set into the middle of the ring.
At least, he’d thought he’d known the real man behind this mask but now he wasn’t so sure. A six year gap, which he thought wouldn’t be a problem, suddenly turned to a massive fault between him and Harry.
As Harry was removing the borrowed robe he stopped in front of his mirror and stared at himself. The rings had counteracted his creature's features, but some changes remained. His cheekbones and face remained sharper and graceful. He was unused to the fact he didn’t need his glasses anymore, and the wild look in his emerald eyes unnerved him. His brows where thinner and his hair was quite long. Looking over it now, it was a smoother, silkier, and came down to his hips. It still had a wave to it with a few unruly tufts near his forehead, not anywhere near what it had been. His lips had also taken on a slightly green tint, the same as the tips of his nails. He sighed as he locked onto the most noticeable change to his body. Long slender ears appeared on either side of his head with a fine layer of black fur woven over them, and as he touched them they twitched at the slightest contact. Thinking about it, he could probably hide them with his hair, but the other two changes would be harder to hide. Harry’s fox legs remained; as did his set of three tails which took turns curling and uncurling as he stood in front of the mirror. After standing there for three hours or so he found he had the ability to dissolve his tails, however, a bright tattoo version of them stayed visible against his back. He found his legs could also be hidden with the right pair of pants and a glamour. Satisfied with his progress he climbed into bed and pulled the covers up over himself. Tomorrow he would go out with Sirius to get the few things left on his Hogwarts list while Remus stayed home to get ready for the full moon. Then in a week it would be off to Hogwarts. With how eventful today had been, he hadn’t gotten the chance, nor remembered, to ask Sirius about the Malfoys.
"They had no idea. And Sirius can not prove his innocence without Dumbledore's help. So far it would seem Dumbledore has convinced Sirius that he can do nothing," Narcissa stated softly. Oh Sirius, you stupid mutt. Why couldn't you have come to her for help. They where both Black's after all.
“No, I feel weird in the morning if I take them. And you really must stop calling him that,” he muttered. Lupin agreed and gave Sirius a stern glare, causing Sirius to put his hands up in defeat.
Harry smiled and then started laughing as well. "And here I thought Ghost was just enjoyed terrorizing people for no reason," Harry chuckled. He climbed up into his bed and patted Ghost's head. "Sorry I misread you," he told the albino striped hyena. Ghost seemed very appreciated of the apology and head butted Harry's chin. Harry let our an oof as he fell back on the bed, not ready for the sheer force Ghost hit him with. Ghost froze then, grey-white eyes wide as he stared down at Harry. He whined slightly as Harry groaned.
“Fine,” Draco stated and waved a hand dismissively at him, “But promise you’ll stick to Luna or Neville like glue when I’m not around. I know they both have the one class I don’t have with you.” Harry smiled and then nodded before leaping at Draco and hugging him.
LeFay inhaled sharply, a growl building up in his throat till he burst, "YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT I'VE DONE OR BEEN THROUGH! Do not come in here, spouting about what YOU think you know!" bellowed at him. The whole room shook as he spoke, "I AM NOT the same man YOU knew!" LeFay stopped himself from yelling again, taking a deep breath and waited a moment for the room to stop rolling under him. "Nor do you desire the pain that would come from knowing that man now," he sighed and then lifted his gaze from his desk to a very startled looking Draco.
Harry didn't reply for a moment before his gaze shifted over to Hermione. "I wanted to get a head start to the showers. The guys are water hogs, plus I'm tutoring with Snape today, Dumbledore's orders," Harry replied.
“A dragon is nowhere near his power I know,” Harry stated. He sighed and then narrowed his eyes at the bramble that still had his pant leg. “Wish I still had fox legs, this stuff wouldn’t get stuck to me as easily,” he muttered. Bill laughed and leaned down to help him.
Harry stopped at the door to their room, placed inside part of the Astronomy Tower he later found out, and stated the password before mossing in. Draco followed, glancing behind them to make sure they weren’t followed. Draco sighed as he leaned against the door for a moment and then headed over to the bed and flopped down, face first.
Ammit pointed out. Harry sighed and nodded his head. Harry pushed the door open to the Transfiguration room and headed to his seat, staring at the empty one next to him that Draco normally sat in. ‘
Ulkalb cleared his throat again and then gestured around the room, “Everything else has already been separated and placed in the vaults indicated on keys. In the vaults you will find letters if there was anything they wanted to personally say to each of you. Was there anything else?” he said, addressing his question to Regulus.
“Harry! This is Draco’s scarf! That means we can find him and he’s probably still out there!” Theo exclaimed. Harry seemed to brighten instantly and stood, wrapping the blanket around him.
Baxeka smirked, “For each Lord the ring will usually change its design, but the materials it is made of remains constant. This particular ring was formed out of enchanted black silver.” Sirius smiled as the ring did just that and created a new design. It shifted and curled to make a vine of metal that curled down past his finger and around his wrist; the ruby stayed where it was as two small bones covered in ivy appeared on either side of the stone. The small details intrigued him but his attention turned to Remus as his partner finished his own inheritance test.
“You are me,” Harry said softly as he closed his eyes and yawned. Gosh, was he tired. Being so; he still could have sworn he'd seen the silhouette of something standing beside his bed.
Harry's eyes where on the two, and it took a moment for him to process everything. "Wait what, Ghost is Draco?! You mean-."
Draco glanced around. Apparently no one could hear what was happening and Draco, never having any siblings, had no idea what to do. He thought about what he'd want to wake up to if he had a nightmare and then acted. Placing his legs over top of Harry's torso to keep him from struggling more and hurting himself he then started licking Harry's face, trying to wake him. He started whining when that didn't seem to work by it's self. Slowly Harry came around, sniffling as he sat up and started rubbing at his eyes furiously.
Snape's head snapped up, eyes narrowing. He was impressed Harry had done some reading. "No, not enough," Severus shook his head, gripping the table. Tears started to spill down the professors cheeks, what would Lucius do when he found out he'd killed his son. That he'd let Draco die in his care.
and he turned his head to look at the bed where Ammit was staring at them. Ammit puffed up, hissing angrily at the kitsune.
"It's okay, shhhh, it's okay, I'm here," Draco said softly as he wrapped the blanket around him and stroked his back. "Some water and food please?" he said over his shoulder. Lucius and Severus turned, bumping into each other for a moment before heading out to fullfill the request.
LeFay's tails fanned out around him, "You know why you are hear?" Draco nodded slowly as he listened to the slick dark voice emanate from Harry's mouth. As he spoke another figure appeared over LeFay, green eyes filled most of the blackness as Tatsuya's distorted face and ugly maw appeared above Harry. Draco gulped as he looked between the two, both speaking as one, "Then you know what is going to happen."
Hermione rolled her eyes, "Obviously not yet, if he was then he'd have something marking him as Harry's." Ron shrugged his shoulder then.
Harry frowned as he ate, staring at the cave entrance. Charlie stood in the mouth of the cave with a sketch book in hand. He could see the nose of Draco the dragon peeking out of the cave, the rest of him too far in shadow to see. Harry finished his food and then headed over to the cave.
Harry nodded softly. It was Harry's fault the two had disappeared, and it was his responsibility to find them. Harry nosed Herm and she got up, backing off a bit so that Harry could change back.
Draco didn’t even stop to look where he was going, barely batting branches out of his way as he heard the singing continue.
“Come on!” Charlie hollered before he started running. Bill shrugged his shoulders and followed while Sirius helped Harry to his feet before. It didn’t take long for them to come upon signs of the dragon; large trees broken in half, shrubs tossed to the sides of the trail. “Be on your guard,” Charlie said quietly as he paused for a moment.
Harry stared at the wooden floor as he yawned and passed his hand over his frill of a mane he called his hair. It had grown much longer since the end of the war and came down to his shoulders now. The length had smoothed out the tufts but it was still as unruly as ever. When he finally climbed out of bed he fished out some new clothes from a box he'd never quite ‘completely’ unpacked before heading down the attic stairs. he turned with a small bound towards the kitchen even though dark circles still hung around his eyes. Once he got there all he could really do was pick at his food, yawning as he did.
Harry takes Draco, or rather Ghost, back the dorms, scaring everyone in the lion's den. Then he has to find a way to explain the large creature staying with him to his best friends.
"Our turn," Luna stated as she smiled. Harry sat up on the bed with Theo to give them more room, a smile forming on his face. He really wanted to see how Luna looked as a unicorn, and what Neville looked like since his was a humanoid creature. Hermione came out of the bathroom just as Neville finished transforming, giving her a scare. He looked pretty much like normal Neville but wings, much like a bat, had formed. Along with a pair of small horn nubs along his hair line. He had a tail to complete it and his skin had turned a dark purple while his eyes had become pure white.
“So how are we going to do this?” he questioned, his ears tipping forward as he grinned slyly. All three tails curled mischievously behind him as he leaned forward a bit. Draco looked over his shoulder before jumping to his feet and taking a step back.
After he finished unpacking Draco headed back to drawing room, only to find not only his mother and Remus there, but also Sirius. The door closed behind him as he stepped in, causing him to jump.
“As Narcissa already knows, Harry as claimed his titles and inheritance over the summer. He should have come into his inheritance when he turned seventeen but, like many other things we’ve learned, Albus Dumbledore seems to have meddled in things he shouldn’t have,” Sirius paused and rested his elbows on the table, knotting his hands together. “Because of this Harry has only just learned of his titles and what comes with it, so I ask that you two help him. As my sole heir at the moment, he needs to practice his manners and behavior around purebloods. We also have come to realize that a fair amount of people may be coming by the manner to pledge themselves to Potter on account of more than a few of titles. They are as follows; Lord Potter, Peverell, Gryffindor, Slytherin, and LeFay and of course Heir Black.”
"How could we let this happen," Severus choked back the urge to break the chair he sat in. He wanted to slaughter the people that did this to a child. "Why didn't he ask for help?" Severus asked.
Harry pulled the collar out of his pocket and tilted it in his hands, still curious as to who had giving it to him. “What do you have there?” Severus asked. Harry looked up at Snape as he came over.
"You really can't remember my son, tis a pity," the voice paused with its soft caresses, "Have you made your choice?"
Harry started to try and stand before stopping. He realized shoes would probably hurt Draco more if he stepped on any of the sore areas, so he quickly slipped them off and dropped them onto the cave. Giving of a resounding thud when they landed. Charlie looked up from the pad he was writing on, eyes wide. “Harry! What are you doing!” he half yelled, half whispered. Harry spun his head around to hush the dragon-keeper.
"Let's go then. Walking is going to be hard." Jariss smiled and nodded as both melded together and Draco could feel his skin toughen into scales. Draco blinked, thinking about himself and Jariss as one while everything came into focus. His vision became sharper in the darkness and the trees stood shorter than he thought they would. As they stretched out their wings he could feel snow rolling off them before reaching full extension. Draco leaned their weight back before heaving their dark body into the air, surprisingly a quiet take off for their size. They circled once, twice, before getting their bearings and heading towards the pull they'd always felt.
There was a lot of relieved sighs as everyone started to dig into their food, some exchanging small talk. Harry could see a few with different types of ears, and guessed that some probably like the way their ‘creature features’ looked. Harry stared down at his plate, his ears folding back against his head as he sighed, his tails drooping.
Harry was glad he'd changed before leaving the house. The Egyptian shendyt, or kilt, he wore gave a lot more room to move and felt much better against his fur than anything else. Draco, however, was very uneasy about how Harry's choice of outfit. It was probably more do to the fact he wasn’t used to the muggle-like clothing Harry seemed to adore, but he also didn’t comment on how Harry’s tank top made him stand out inappropriately. Instead choosing to huff at him when he walked past and went through the floo.
“Sirius, is it okay if we talk about my inheritance today? I know we didn’t actually go over everything I got since I was out for so long,” Harry asked. Sirius nodded then and let Harry into the drawing room.
Draco glanced around the hall as he made his way forward, taking in all of the detail before stopping directly in front of the throne. LeFay was staring directly at him and Draco could feel the unease he’d had so many years ago. Like LeFay was just waiting for him to make the wrong move so he could devour him.
"I could ask you the same," Ginny fired back. Draco could taste the tension in the room as Harry and Ginny exchanged what looked like menacing glares. Draco had known the two broke up earlier that week but no one had known why.
LeFay tore his eyes away from Draco and glared into the fire, unwilling to even look at him as emotions started to bubble up deep in his subconscious.
Draco couldn’t help the smirk that formed across his face as he pulled the rest of his clothes off, the blush that formed for a moment on LeFay’s face brought him quite a bit of enjoyment. With a deep breath Draco dropped as he concentrated on his other half, skin melting into scales and hair twisting into horns. He blinked as his transformation finished, nose twitching as he looked down at the kitsunes. They were as different as night and day, LeFay with his vat black liquid fur that polled around his feet, massive antlers that dripped with moss, and those forest green eyes and claws. Three tails billowed out from behind him, far more than someone, even with how old he was now, should have. Hisashi on the other side was covered in bright white fur, gold tipped tails and bright golden eyes. A few red markings littered his body, but overall, even with nine tails, he seemed far less imposing that LeFay did.
Normally he felt claustrophobic in tight spaces, but somehow here he felt pleasantly at ease within the trees. It wasn’t as dark or as damp as the Dark Forest, and everywhere he looked there seemed to be green. He turned to look back the way he came, only to see trees behind him. Harry felt panic build a little before he closed his eyes to calm himself. “It wouldn’t matter if it was still there anyways,” he mumbled to himself before slicking back his hair. That’s when he noticed that he didn’t have his ears, and, eyes wide, he reached around to find his tails weren’t there either. “Strange,” he said as he looked down at his feet. He wiggled his toes, feeling the soft ground under them. If felt weird; he'd gotten so use to feeling everything through soft pads.
Draco could tell Harry was in the middle of talking to his other half, so he took the opportunity to stand and stretch. He glanced around the room, taking in the decor of the place. Glancing behind him he watched LeFay's eyes close while nodding his head. Every once in the while he made a noise, but didn't do much else. It must be pretty in depth.
Harry swallowed, part of him wanted to look away and lie, but he couldn’t. This was the first real step in the right direction for their relationship and he had to be honest. “Yes,” Harry said, biting his lip just a bit, “But, I love you too.”
“Harry is gone," Severus said quietly, keeping his voice low, "He using the killing curse on the ex-Death Eaters and then vanished with the Elderwand.”
“You said I had blocks, how many and what were they? How long was I out? Did we get a letter about my 8
“I think this one is promising,” he admitted before she could finish, “The photo isn’t blurred, nor does it look altered,” he added. He could hear Severus sigh and knew if he looked the older man would have his eyes closed. “I’ll be leaving tomorrow,” he told them before finishing his tea quickly and heading back to the study. There he would be at peace and he could look more into the area from the picture. He wished with all his heart that this didn’t turn out like the others.
The vampire grinned. “You won’t find any friends of witches and wizards like you in these woods,” he spat. “I know Ladon isn’t your real name either, so what is it?”
Hisashi sighed, “Go ahead and transform. I suggest spending more time in this form may help with your current mindset. I’m gathering that part of this is you still viewing yourself as a monster, and that these instincts of yours are evil in some way.” LeFay nodded and stood.
Jariss grumbled in the back of Draco's mind as the wizard continued forward, finally stopping in a clearing that had little snow. It must have been protected form the wind by the large trees around it.
“I think you’re right, but legally you’re also an adult in the wizarding world, so I think he’s trying to be respectful of your,” Sirius paused and clicked his tongue, “Fashion.” Harry choked on air before laughing loudly. Sirius smiled and joined in as he headed over to the floo. He hooked an arm around Harry and ruffled his hair before stepping into the floo. “Make sure you cast a glamour on yourself before you go through. I’m going to go on ahead,” Sirius said before dropping the floo powder and disappearing in a blast of green flames.
Harry gave one last squeeze around Ghost's neck before reaching for his wand to check the time. It was only ten minutes before he'd set his wand to wake him, so rather than sit there waiting, he decided on getting up now rather than later. He pulled the curtains back from around his bed slowly, not wanting to wake up Ron or any of the others. He rarely got the chance to take showers with no one around, so he usually woke up early to do so. Ghost sat on the bed, watching him curiously as Harry dug around in his chest. He was glad that Sirius had gotten him new clothes over the summer so he didn't have to wear Duddly's had me downs, though thinking about it made him depressed. Since Sirius couldn't prove his innocence Harry was still forced to live with his Muggle relatives.
"That scowl is unbecoming of you, you'll end up looking like Sev if you keep it up for much longer," LeFay looked down at Draco, grey purple eyes staring back at him. "What were you thinking about that produced such a look?" Draco asked.
“Slowly things are changing in the right direction, but honestly wizards are the least of our worries in the magical world,” LeFay stated.
Tatsuya asked. Harry nodded sharply, this was the first he had felt of Tatsuya since yesterday, and he most definitely wanted help.
"Not without you, not with you looking like this. It isn't right!" Draco shouted. He could have sworn he thought he saw Harry smile at him.
Black hair melted into a vat black body with glowing eyes hanging hauntingly over a toxic maw dripping with magic; creating moss and plants were it fell. The creature looked at Snape before gracefully loping down the hall, barely coming into contact with the ground as it disappeared.
"Skoll has found nothing as of late, however he is still currently out on his mission still. We have had little to no contact from him or his team," Hati replied, keeping his head low. The crackle of magic next to his ear surprised him and everyone in attendance was suddenly on their feet; wands drawn.
Draco's eyes snapped to attention. Had he just called him Draco rather than Lord Malfoy? What was with the sudden change, and why did the atmosphere suddenly feel so heavy?
Narcissa bowed after approaching, her black robe shimmering in the fire light. “Juniper, to heal any wounds. Larch, to protect myself and to protect this family. Lemon, to purify our bond. Maple, for longevity. And Morning Glory, to promote happiness. With these I give myself and swear to be forever loyal to the Black family and its heirs,” Narcissa’s spoke as she added the herbs. She lit them aflame and then as she added her own blood she spoke the final words, “To this day, until my death, I solemnly swear.” The fire flared as the blood was added and turned to a light calming blue.
Harry blushed a little before nodding and then took his place in the middle of the room. "Well here goes nothing," he stated.
McGonagall stood at the gates of Hogwarts, looking out at the camps of former Death Eaters standing just outside of the Hogwarts wards. The students had been safely evacuated to the great hall and all the doors had been locked, but McGonagall didn’t know how long she could hold them back. After the attack on Hogwarts last year, the castle just didn’t have the amount of magic within its walls like it used to. Oh she hopped her former students, Harry, and Snape where fairing well.
“Potter, you are a parseltongue. Are you sure you couldn’t make out anything from the hissing?” Snape asked. Harry shook his head and frowned.
Harry's eyes shimmered with emotion for a moment before they turned cold, "Nothing. This is just a dream, and you need to wake up." Draco shook his head.
Harry skipped through the hall, not a care in the world as Hermione and Luna talked behind him about famous animagi. Theo and Neville had struck up a conversation about the care of magical creatures class, and completely ignored the girls’ conversation.
“Hey, I’ll talk to you guys later. I’m feeling kind of tired,” Harry stated and waved at them as he walked over to Draco and Theo. He approached quietly, clearing his throat when he got close. Both went quiet as Draco looked up at Harry.
Hisashi thought over it for a moment before smiling brightly, “Well. If it is True, then, it won't matter even if you were a fly and him a frog.”
Harry and Draco sat slightly apart from most of the other students in the great hall, and as he was observing, Draco noticed that most of the other students were paired in threes or twos. Some of them he recognized, but only three of them stood out. Two because they were friends of Harry’s; Neville Longbottom, Luna Lovegood, the third being Theodore Nott.
Sirius looked over Neville and shook his head. “That was just an adjustment period; the real Harry testing the waters,” Sirius stated.
Ron shrugged, "Hyena's are nasty. I heard they scavenge and steal meals from other predators, damn cowards." Ghost started growling then and lifted his head. Despite the fact Ghost's head was facing the other side of the room, Ron froze up at the growl.
Draco grabbed his two suite cases and shrunk them before slipping them into his pocket. Then he held out his arm, “Come on Bubo.”
“Well, as Harry’s guardian I’m sure that won’t be a problem any longer,” Regulus said, the tiniest smirk forming at the corner of his lip. “Ulkalb,” Regulus said, addressing the goblin.
“If the owner dies than the ring usually appears to the declared heir or back to the family’s vault,” Harry stated. Remus and Sirius both stared at him like he had grown a second head. “You didn’t know?” he asked. How could they not know that? It was one of the few things Harry had learned after starting to read up on Pureblood History and Policies.
“Madam Pomfrey said I was fine, she released me last night but said I should stay here just in case,” he countered. Sirius smirked a bit, knowing that Harry wasn’t one to give up easily.
"Do you think he will wake?" Voldemort asked softly as he lifted his hand to the resident's cheek. Severus looked over the body of the young man between them.
“Damn it,” he muttered as he dodged out of the way of another spell, hearing it slam behind him against a pillar and crumbling it in seconds. Draco took the opportunity to throw up a masking spell, creating a dust cloud around him that he used for cover. He could hear Cadmael swear as the beastman tried to wipe the dirt out of his eyes.
“Hey! I told her to leave her alone!” he roared. He flicked his wand, sending Dean flying away from Parvati.
“And if he ends up disgusted by the real me, the real Harry?” LeFay snorted, "It would be a disaster. No."
“Dumbledore must have had them sealed and ordered to be read at a later date because of the circumstances of their death,” he stated before motioning Harry to keep reading.
Harry bit his lip before asking if he could hold the snake. The man nodded and opened the cage, picking him up and handing him to Harry. “You have to be careful though, he’s pretty big. Around eight feet I think,” he told Harry as the snake wound around his shoulders. For as big as the snake was it didn’t end up feeling as heavy as Harry thought it would.
Hermione stood up and put her bag over her shoulder. "Well it's late. I'm going to head to bed. I'll see you guys later okay?" she stated and then headed out. Ron watched her with a frown and then shrugged. She must be in one of her moods.
Regulus and Severus nodded, and the four of them made their way into the next room. They watched through the transparent wall of the next room as those that had gotten their keys spoke. It would seem Augusta and Sirius were having some choice words with Albus. It honestly made Regulus swell with pride that Sirius was defending Harry so adamantly. Harry watched as well, though he felt sicker than anything. Ghost pushed his head into Harry’s hand, and then kept pushing him towards a soft chair.
Tatsuya spoke as they finished up their meeting with the new ambassadress for the Hogwart's creatures. Apparently the school board was wanting to close down the school after what happened six years ago. Six years and they where still talking about it. Pathetic. The creatures where concerned about there homes on the grounds of the school and wanted to make sure they had places to move if needed. LeFay had been all to eager to agree letting them stay at one of the estates.
"This is my brother Skoll," Hati grinned, introducing his packmate, "We are both part of Lord LeFay's werewolf faction. One of three packs living on the grounds," Hati boosted. "Skoll here is also one of the twelve LeFay keeps as his pets."
Draco took a chance and glanced around the side of the hedge, surprise blossoming on his face when he saw the massive white kitsune that currently sat at the top of the small hill in the center of the maze. At the bottom of it sat Lord LeFay, looking small for once.
Draco nodded, adding it in and watching it bubble before disappearing under the surface of the potion.
“Still not sleeping well?” Sirius asked as he leaned against the center island with a hot cup of coffee between his hands. Harry nodded as he started to gnaw on the waffle in front of him.
The poem/song repeat from the few chapters before this that Tatsuya sings however is mine. Sooo, no stealzys!    =(^ . ^)=
Draco laughed, "Only to fill the role of an heir to the Malfoy line. Do you know how much flack they would have gotten if they hadn't?"
Seeing the reaction from the dragon Charlie chanced a glance at Harry only to receive another warning hiss. Charlie kept his eyes on the dragon then, bowing slightly. “Harry, try getting him to go in the cave. It’ll probably be a tight fit for him, but at least there we might be able to set up something to check out his health,” Charlie suggested but kept his eyes on Draco. Harry nodded and then slowly waded out of the water. There was a low whining nose before it followed.
Draco's lips pursed as he reached for his drink, “I was wondering… The new scar on your face,” he drifted off, his gaze questioning as he lifted the cup to his lips.
“It doesn’t matter, sniff it.” Harry scowled but did as he was told, his eyes flashing before he looked up at Theo. “It smells the same,” he stated. Theo smiled big before he put his hand down to ruffle Harry’s hair.
“If that’s all we really should be going McGonagall,” Charlie stood and then put his chair back with its respective desk. Bill got up as well, looking back at the table for a moment before bowing to the headmistress.
Draco stood there speechless and eyes glistening, as he watched LeFay’s back disappear out the door.
"I asked you if you are feeling okay..." she said; her eyebrows furrowing. Both her and Ron exchanged a look as Harry continued playing with the food on his plate.
“What’s a Kitsune?” Draco asked as he shifted in his seat. Talking about Harry was giving him a weird vibe.
“To make sure he is really dead.” LeFay’s eyes didn’t leave the students below them now. He knew it was an odd request but he needed to make sure. If he wasn’t back somehow then that would mean Albus had something planned after his death for if LeFay took back his own control. After sitting backseat to his own life, he didn’t want anything in the way of this new one.
Did he really expect it to be that easy for him to just come out and start telling Draco everything bout the real him? LeFay scoffed at the idea. "You really think it's going to be that easy?" LeFay asked as he folded his own hands in his lap, staring Draco down.
“Oh… Wait, I didn’t even know you two knew each other,” Harry said as he looked between them. Theo chuckled and then shifted his armful of books.
He was confused, but didn’t say anything else as the man took the collar to the back to add the protections and portkey to it. He brought it back out and then handed it to Harry.
“You know technically, there are two snakes in this room,” Harry stated from the bedroom. Draco scoffed and continued to put on his silk sleeping pants and t-shirt that went with it. Surprisingly it was a light powered blue rather than green. Draco finished with his nightly routine and then headed back into the bedroom, humming to himself as he put his stuff away in the baggy he carried. He froze when he looked up.
Sirius, Remus and Harry all proceed to the will reading, only to find out some extraordinary information that they may or may not enjoy. Along with the will reading they all have inheritance tests done and Gringotts with some 'INTERESTING' results.
The four-year-old wandered over raising his hands to his father, “Up,” he said. Remus reached down and lifted him into his arms, smiling as he started bouncing his son.
“Everyone, please report to the Great Hall for an announcement. Those in the infirmary, please remain there. Someone will tell you what happened afterwards. Thank you.” McGonagall’s voice faded from the coms as they got up from their seats.
Harry watched as the boy vanished into the bloody waters, he had still been surprised to see anyone else here. As he climbed out of the water he laid down on the cool glass-like surface of his worlds floor. He touched his skin, feeling the raised scarred flesh. The rough spiderwebs of each one traced a new roadway across his body. He looked up into the blackness and let his eyes slowly close. Soon enough he'd be free. Free from all of the world's credulity. Yet, something kept him here in limbo. Maybe it had something to do with the adolescence that screamed his name. He vaguely remembered yelling the boy's name back but, he couldn't remember it now.
Just as sudden as the nightmare had started Draco woke, falling off the bed and struggling to attack the arms that had plagued him in sleep.
Draco could feel the panic bubbling up but he squashed it down, a small smile forming on his face. He really should have been more careful for what he wished for, LeFay had warned him and he'd ignored it. Now it was too late to go back and he hadn't even gotten to the juice bits yet. "You're right," Draco chuckled darkly, looking up to meet the ancient vampires eyes, "What does he need me to do?" he asked.
"What? The bed looked fluffy," Theo whined. Hermione patted his head and whispered something into his ear which he smiled at.

“Showing you what it truly means to be your so-called monster, now you follow suit, both of you will be returning to your true forms for the day,” Hisashi snickered.
'We forgot about the full moon tonight!' LeFay smacked the next wolf out of the way with his antlers, trying his best not to do fatal damage. Suddenly he felt his control slip as Tatsuya yanked LeFay to the back of their mind.
Draco wasn't aware of where he went. He just wanted space to breathe. Needed it. He didn't realize how far he had actually gone till the snow was up to his waist, and he honestly didn't even remember it being this deep.
Sitting there, in a throne, across the large hall Draco had just entered was a green-eyed man, black hair trailing down his sides. As the doors closed behind him four men, that had been kneeling, stood and turned to face Draco. Red eyes, brown, and golden yes locked onto him. Not even a second passed before they started to move as one toward him, but a light tongue click was heard as the man in the throne stood. The four froze.
LeFay stayed crouched as the thing above him moved, uncovering him and letting the moonlight shine down upon him. Taking a step back, his mind exploded questions as his eyes meet giant dark purple orbs.
“Yes, based on how badly his memory has been tampered with, I fear he might start to break into insanity. I need your permission and help, to add him to our bond, that should stabilize him. My magic, by itself, would overwhelm him, but with you being the buffer,” he stopped and looked down at Draco. The other’s couldn’t see but there was a pleading expression behind those stoic eyes.
“I said enough, enough of all this self deprivation. While you are Lord LeFay, and you have a responsibility to your followers, Draco, the stubborn man that he is, chose his own path. That collar stayed on because he refused to give up on you. And as much as it makes me sick to say so, it would seem Cadmael is the same. You push others out when they get too close, but you don’t ever let them make the decision on if they want to leave or not. While I will not defend Draco’s earlier actions, you didn’t give him much of a choice. You didn’t give much of a choice to either of them, you didn’t give them the chance to see the monster.”
Severus replied. He watched his godson step backwards and tumble over, going still once he hit the floor. He felt his knees go out and he landed on the floor with his hands holding him up as Lucius rushed past him. "Its just a stunner, he'll be fine Lucius." Severus stared at the floor for a long moment before he felt a hand on his shoulder.
“Hey! Leave her alone!” Harry yelled as he came out from around the corner and pointed his wand at them. Seamus and Dean both turned around, looking stiff till they realized who it was and then relaxed. The unknown didn’t seem so relaxed and took a step back. Parvati peeked around the two males in front of her before calling out to him.
"It wasn't planned. Lord Malfoy happened to find his way here. Through a picture he managed to get his hands on, no doubt. Which leads us to our true agenda," LeFay looked over his group of twelve trusted advisers, letting his eyes have time to rest on each of them. "We have a leak."
“Draco,” LeFay muttered apologetically, “I wish I could tell you everything, I wish I’d had the time and now you’re gonna have to find out in the worst way. I really am a monster,” Harry murmured aloud to himself.
"You are still here?" the blackness asked. Harry was use to the world talking to him, and he smiled cooly.
"And please...call me Draco. It's only natural if I'm going to be learning about the real you," he stated as he crossed his knee over the other, his hands going to his lap. LeFay stated at him blankly, at a loss for words.
“I had noticed, but it's not necessarily something I can help you with. Tatsuya would be a better option, but I’m guessing that since you're here, that partnership isn’t going very well?”
“I hope I get the chase to feel your last breath beneath my claws hatchling scum,” Cadmael spat venomously as he bowed.
LeFay sat on his throne, eyes unfocused. He wasn't looking forward to this discussion, nor what would possible come of it.
"Harry?!" excitement, hope. "Severus help me, I think I can reach him. He isn't gone yet, please!" a pause. "HARRY!"
Draco on the other had felt utterly humiliated and at odds with himself as he bounded around like a bloody fawn trying to make Potter feel better. At least he had the showers with Potter to look forward, and being pampered.
Harry continued walking for what felt like hours before finally stopping and sitting at the base of a large rock.
Draco walked beside Harry, his porcupine like mane lying flat against his back and his tail still. After eating he had become very tired and walking at the moment was the only thing keeping him awake.
There was a long hiss as Draco chuckled, simply sitting down on his scaly rump, he looked down at LeFay, amused.
Harry struggles to master his animagus for so that he can look for Draco and Parvati with Bill and Charlie. Despite being pounded with homework as well Harry is determined to succeed and can't get Draco off his mind. What if Draco was hurt because of him, and Parvati?
Harry was confused. “Rings?” he asked as he glanced over both he's father's faces. Only to be handed a box instead of answers.
“What happened?!” he heard a frantic McGonagall yell. The rest of the wizards and witches defending Hogwarts spilling through the gates behind her.
Harry said quickly as he glanced around again, grabbing his wand from his nightstand. “Who’s there!?” Harry called loudly as he got his wand at the ready. Ammit stiffened on the bed and tasted the air, looking around worriedly as well. When he didn’t smell anything, he looked quizzically at his master. Was he going insane?
LeFay's hands clenched, his jaw tightening as he leaned down to run his hand over his old friends smooth, lifeless scales. He could feel the tears forming behind his eyes but they never feel as anger started to fill him. This, this was a declaration of war for sure. This was a message. It wasn't teens fighting a weak half living skeleton of a man anymore, this was real.
“Do you remember anything that just happened?” Theo asked softly as he sat to one side of Harry with Neville in front of him. Harry shook his head slowly for a moment before stopping.
he stated. Harry huffed and chewed on the inside of his cheek. He could feel the kitsune moving around, feel its muscles rolling under his own. The kitsune seemed surprised, and a bit tickled when it spoke again,
“What exactly have you been doing these past six years. Everyone seems to think you are the new big bad now,” Draco huffed when he finally caught up with LeFay.
Draco sat at his desk, frowning at the tower of paper work on it. He cursed the day he’d told Severus he’d help with his potion business.
Severus leaned back in his chair. "He wasn't fully aware Harrison was a horcrux as well," the words left his lips softly.
“He sent me back, told me to continue watching over you, but when I came back the next time and told him about our break he was furious. He beat me, tortured me for information, then convinced me that I could get you back if I just did what he said,” he stopped to lick his lips, before his head shot up, eyes wide. “I didn’t, I didn’t know,” he stopped, struggling to stand, “Harry, he has your family.”
Draco beamed brightly, his eyes lightening up. He was still wearing his weekend pyjamas, black satin pyjamas and his hair in a ponytail “Strawberry? And chocolate?”
“I kissed you?” He asked again, but Draco continued to ignore it, he grabbed the bronzer and kept going
“Because…because I thought you’d date him” Harry said, looking up at Draco again and pushed his glasses up “And, well, I thought if I could live with you, it’d be…nice”
“Well, I know that” Potter said, rubbing the nape of his neck, he grinned at Draco and continued “I just thought it would be nice if you have something to make you less cold even a little when I’m not around”
“I’m not” Pansy said “Ron said you’d do good for Harry, we all think so, you two balance each other out. Ginny thinks you’re a catch, do you think I’m lying? You know Ginny likes you now, everyone likes you, they honestly think you guys would be married by the time you’re 30” She wiped the wet hair that stuck to Draco’s forehead and slicked it back “We won’t leave you. And…if you guys fight, you
“It’s just an offer” He shrugged, stepping back as Ron still kept his eyes on him “Have a good study date, you two” He turned on his heels and walked away
“Hey” Pansy turned around and waved at them “Wanna leave? Hermione and I want to prepare for dinner. Wear something casual, not robes, Draco”
“Why would I be mad, darling?” His mother said softly with a smile “Harry, dear, come in, you don’t need to hide anymore” She said quietly as Draco widened his eyes, glancing at his boyfriend and Harry stepped into their view.
Harry said, making Draco shivered when he bit the sensitive spot on the blond’s ear, he rammed in slow but each thrust was deep, hitting Draco’s prostate every time
moment when his heart skipped a beat that he realised he wanted to get married to Draco and keep waking up next to him like this for as long as they can live. However, today has not been nice to him, Harry put the box back in his pocket and closed his eyes, he just has to wait for Draco.
“Let’s go” Harry beamed, Apparating them both away right in the pub. One second after he was somewhere familiar
“Do you like snow?” Potter asked him, pulling his attention back to the boy in front of him, he nodded and touched the snow that fell on the Gryffindor’s shoulder.
teasing him. Draco bit his lower lips when Harry stroke his hard length, he also hasn’t had sex in days because he was so busy with his work, he felt so pent up all over his body.
him to come home early, but he never listened, he always stayed late at work, he was a complete idiot. Draco felt the shivers running across his spine, it wasn’t that cold, but he was trembling for another reason. The street was empty, the streetlights were shining above him, the cold wind hitting his face, Draco clutched on his phone and dialled a familiar number that he hoped to hear an answer from, it was his last chance when his phone only has one percent of battery left.
” Potter looked at him and glanced around the hospital wing, holding his right arm while his face was slightly frowning, he wasn’t sure it was caused because he saw Draco or because of the pain “Is Madam Pomfrey here?”
“What are you doing?” He asked, pulling the bottle of wine from Theodore’s hand “You can’t drink that much. What’s wrong?”
“Because two kids who get in detentions every few weeks aren’t enough for you?” He snickered, they’ve been called by the Headmistress many times, Scorpius was a nice kid, but he could also be persuaded into James’s little pranks and mischief.
Harry whispered so quietly before thrusting in with full force, Draco could actually feel his body moving on the beach
The guy stood up, swaying in every move he made to get out of the booth and faced him, and that irritated Draco even more “How do I even know you’re really his boyfriend?”
One thing Draco has concluded was that the other Draco was much smarter than him, he found out things way faster somehow
“It is, obviously” He lied straight to Harry’s face and folded his arms together “It’s cracked when I found it just now. It must be why we can only see our reflections”
“Actually, yes, I am” He said and Potter’s face fell, but the Auror composed himself quickly and diverted his eyes
“Wait” Draco skimmed the parchment Hermione gave him and asked “We have to…do every activity in this with you two? Like…a couple?”
Theodore murmured into Neville’s neck, sliding his hands into the blond hair of the Gryffindor. Draco couldn’t help but smiled a bit when he saw them leave the room, one more couple was on the way. Draco looked around the room only to see Harry staring at him again, it was like Sixth Year all over again, only this time Harry wasn’t hiding. The blond flushed from the intense stare and sipped on his drink, turning away, it was hard avoiding him like this, but he has no other choice.
special” That was true, the blond had called his mother last week to ask her how to make chocolates, he wanted it to be done by his own hands, so he had sneaked out of his dorm almost every night since then to try making chocolate in the Hogwarts’s kitchen. Some of the elves even helped him, but last night, he was able to make the
“Okay, just, okay, stand here in front of me” Ron pushed Blaise into the spot he was standing earlier and stood behind Blaise, poking his head out to the right to look at the girls “So, I have something to tell you”
He released his hand and Harry looked at him steadily before his mouth opened to tell Luna the answer
“Just some stuff about the exam” He said, shaking his head and hoping she’d believe his lie “What about you? Shouldn’t you be organising books?”
“How could I not?” Harry said, he didn’t really regret saying it out loud, he meant it. Harry leaned close and kissed him once again, feeling Draco’s nails on his back as he kept ramming in. He trailed down his neck, licking and sucking on his pulse point, making sure Draco will be covered in hickeys the next morning, for everyone to know that Draco was his “I love you”
stuff when I see him, so I couldn’t take it anymore and made a pact with Pansy, to confess to our crushes when we’re 20 if we’re still not over it by then”
“I’m just thinking” Pansy said, leaning back on the couch and looking at something in the air “I think, I
“Yeah” Draco said, grabbing Harry’s hands and placed them on his face. He touched the blond’s smooth hair and cupped his face, Draco got thinner, he suspected, his finger trailed from his jawline down to the corner of his mouth. And before he knew it, he was touching Draco’s lips, his lips were never chapped like Harry’s, it was always glossy and just…tempting Harry to do more.
have sex with him…let me explain, after I saw the girl, Haley, wearing the ring you were supposed to give me, I…I was mad, and then you telling me Brandon was bad news, I was still mostly mad because of Haley, so, er, I did kiss him, I did
“Oh honey, if Hermione and I are friends, then we might have done some stuff friends wouldn’t do” Pansy snickered and showed off her wrist to show him a bracelet “See that? The bracelet? It’s got Hermione’s initial on it, it’s hers since she was a kid but she gave me because she loves me. We’re girlfriends”
“Come on, Ravenclaw, used to be a Chaser, and the Quidditch’s captain?” Draco smirked, glancing at Davies, who was standing next to Neville “That’s a catch”
” Draco said, dragging Harry away. When they were walking up the stairs, Draco realised his hand was intertwined with Harry already, he glanced up to see the git smiling brightly
“He did want to go, Pansy too, but we played rock, paper, scissor and I won” Hermione grinned when Theo let out a chuckled, she stepped closer to him and put her hand on his arm “Are you alright?”
“How do you know that’s happened before?” She halted and gave him a look, Draco froze there, he couldn’t believe he let that slipped
, and walked out of the room, leaving Draco there like a schoolgirl who’s just been invited to a party by her crush
“You can start” Draco mumbled, squeezing his grip on Harry, it could be uncomfortable at first, Harry angled it and tried to hit the spots he had hit with his fingers earlier
, he has been hung up on Neville for two years, it wasn’t like he didn’t try to forget about the stupid guy, he just…can’t.
“That’s a horrible place to put the spare keys at” Harry chuckled behind him and Draco glared at the officer with a twinkle of joy in his eyes
“Yes” Draco nodded, taking off his robes and putting the sweater on outside of his white shirt. Harry fixed his collar for him and cupped his face, peppering him with light kisses all over his face until he burst into laughter “
“Hmm, breezy indeed” Draco hummed at her, pulling Harry’s cock outside of his boxer and just started teasing it. He watched in amusement as Harry chugged all his beer in quickly, and slammed the glass down on the table a bit harder than usual, he was tense, he was afraid they’d get caught “Don’t you think so, Harry? Is it…breezy?”
“Well, we were scared of that too” Theo replied, squeezing his hand with Neville at the same time Draco unzipped Harry’s jeans, slipping his hand under the jeans and felt Harry’s bulge from outside of his boxer getting harder under his touch
Draco looked at the person in front of him, a nice looking guy who was showing off all the things he achieved this year, including his partners in bed. Draco’s mind was somewhere else, someone else in particular. He knew why Pansy brought him here tonight, because he needed to solve this problem with Harry. The problem was him and his fear of losing Harry, his trust issues and his anxiety. But ever since he told his parents about it, and after a lot of talks with his friends, who shared stories of them and their partners, he felt better, and he realised, he missed Harry, so bloody much. He nodded, giving the guy in front of him a fake smile when the bell rang. Thank Merlin that was over, Draco fixed himself in his seat and froze when he realised Harry was walking to his table. Draco turned around to look at Pansy for help, but Hermione and her only gave him bright smiles and winks. They knew he’d have to talk to Harry eventually, they made this happen. Draco looked down and avoided his eyes when Harry settled down in front of him, he didn’t dare say a thing.
“It’s alright” Draco spoke, biting his lips nervously, his hands were on his thighs but Harry knew the blond was fidgeting with the tablecloth, he always did it when he was nervous “Actually, I, I have to apologise too. I acted too hasty, I…Brandon was a tosser, he, er, you were right, he was only using me. I can’t believe I’d trust him over you, we’ve known each other for so long and I’d trust a guy I only know for a few months”
what you have to do when you think it’s time” She smirked, her eyes twinkling under the light, Harry took a deep breath and nodded, he wanted to do it too.
“I don’t want to” Draco pouted, sitting down on the stool near the kitchen counter and eating the meal Harry had cooked for him, eggs and bacon, his favourite breakfast “This is horrible by the way”
” Pansy jolted and pulled her Muggle phone out of her pocket, it was the one her wife had given her “
“How long has it been since you last shag anyone, Anthony?” Pansy cocked her head to the side, making Goldstein blushed
“I want to apologise for everything I’ve done to you, I was a bully, I was mean towards you for no reason, I’ve been the biggest arse in this place” He said, fidgeting with his own sleeves, he has never apologised before so this definitely made him struggle for a bit “I said so many things, I called you names, I did horrible things. I don’t know if you’ll forgive me, if you don’t, I totally get it. I just want to say that I’m sorry for being such a monster towards you, you don’t deserve any of that” He admitted loudly, his knees trembling, and then there it was, she placed her hand on his, stopping him from shaking.
“Absolutely, we will have lunch, then we’ll go to that horse ranch, then swim, then dinner, and then finally…we’ll be sitting at the beach again to stargaze, and then we’ll be home before midnight, I’ve already have the Portkey made and ready” Pansy said “We can make it”
” Draco shut Harry up with another kiss before tearing away, looking at what he accomplished “You like it?”
He groaned, pulling all of Draco’s hair up so it won’t fall into his face. Though everyone always praised him and calling him the most powerful one in the wizarding world and shit like that, he felt powerless whenever he was with Draco.
“Want me to go back with you?” Draco tapped his shoulder and Theo turned around, the photoshoot quickly ended after an hour because Cormac wanted to redo his photoshoot and it took
” He barged in her office and slammed his hands on the table, startling the witch “Do you know about Potter’s party tomorrow night?”
“Hey…didn’t your dad and his friends study here 20 years ago?” He asked, when the Headmistress mentioned she didn’t want the same thing from 20 years ago to happen again, and what she said with him having the Black’s blood inside him. Didn’t Potter’s dad play with Sirius Black? Sirius was his first cousin, once removed. And he didn’t really care about what the Headmistress said…until now
“Yes, I heard it, Pansy” Draco smiled, noticing Pansy’s happy look. During Granger’s speech, Pansy was so enamoured and focused on it, he was sure it has made some impacts on her.
Harry murmured between kisses, and that was when Draco slipped his tongue inside, the way they kiss was like the way they acted around each other, fighting back and forth for domination, but also tender and soft, full of passion and heat “
you to be better for me” Theo snapped, pushing Neville away, he leaned his back on the wall of the lift and scowled at him “I like you because you are you, you are not like other men. All the men that were with me thought of me as a toy, an object they could show off, you…you were different, you appreciated me for who I am, you were the first to notice that I have a thing for Astronomy, you named a fucking star after my name for my birthday, that was when I know you were different, you just…you make me feel things I have never felt, I don’t need you to change or to be better, if I want to be with you, I don’t care about anything else. So
“Yeah, Lov—I mean Luna insisted” Draco replied when Potter asked him after Blaise and Weasley had walked away “It’s fine, I think it’ll be a fun party anyway”
“Yeah, I also thought those two were in on helping too, like the four of you, from four Houses, right?” Theodore added another question, making Blaise smirked, surely he wasn’t smirking at someone he was reading, he knew as well “I’m just saying”
“Nev…are you a virgin?” Theo murmured when Neville buried his head in the crook of Theo’s neck, his hands were clumsy, like he didn’t know where to put it
“You know?” Pansy asked and Ron nodded at her, she chuckled and continued, leaning on the wall and watched as Harry carried Draco up the stairs “Well, years ago, he said his last wish before going to Paris was to see Harry, and he did, they even fucked, so that went better than he ever expected. But he got transferred back here this year and from what he has been telling me, he’s still not over Harry”
He said, turning on his right to face Potter. For once, he was serious about this, he wanted to have that feelings again, to know whether or not his own mind was tricking him into believing that he didn’t have feelings for Potter. Maybe he did, maybe Pansy was right…was she always right?
“That’s basically everything we need to learn for the exam—Potter, what are you doing?” He asked and pointed at the book when Harry kept staring at him “This is where you need to look, not me”
“You two, honestly” He chuckled, Pansy was too deep in love with Hermione now. They have been together for six years, it started when Pansy became a stylist for Hermione, who was trying to become the Minister back then, they fell madly in love. He knew Hermione was the one for Pansy ever since she started talking about how perfect Hermione was, she hasn’t even stopped now. Draco created a big wedding for them five years ago and now they had a small boy who was about to turn four in a month, Hugh.
“You know just what to say to rile me up, don’t you?” Draco huffed out a laugh at him and nodded, his hand never stop stroking “Challenge accepted,
The guy exclaimed, rolling his eyes before sashaying away. When Draco finally calmed down, he realised Potter was still holding him, and it felt like eternity before he spoke
?” Draco uttered shyly, his breath hitched when Harry licked his earlobe and pushed the fingers in as deep as he could, arching it up and making Draco moaned. Harry pulled the fingers out and sat back on the bed, removing the last piece of clothing on him, his cock sprung up heavily, he couldn’t even believe he’d last that long.
“Then I’ll have to use plan B” Pansy said, filling her cocktail up with her wand “Cancelling your stripper and we’ll still end up having to call Draco”
Harry grumbled in his ear, making Draco chuckled in between his wanton moans. It was winter, it was supposed to be cold, but he could see drops of sweats falling on the carpet of the stairs from his forehead. Harry’s hot body stuck to him like glue, with the sound of skin slapping on skin echoing in the house. The portrait of Aunt Walburga must have a blast hearing this from the closet where they have put her in years ago because she wouldn’t stop blabbering about how they were the filth and scum that were living in her house.
“Before you say anything, I want to tell you first” He turned around, closing the door and stopping Harry from stepping farther ahead “I’m not Draco”
has been glancing at you for a while now, since we started talking” Theo tilted his head, wanting Draco to turn around and look, but he couldn’t, he
“So, er…do you, well, do you have feelings for me too?” Harry finally finished a sentence and Draco gave him a pleased smile.
“Pansy, Draco, the usual, I guess?” Hannah asked, already making their usual drinks. She was a Muggleborn and she joined Beauxbatons instead, they had met years ago just after Draco graduated Hogwarts and they were friends since then. Draco looked around the crowded pub and sighed, it was Friday again, Pansy had called him out to Hannah’s pub since he was too caught up in work and insisted for a best friend night, so he had put on a simple white crop top and a pair of black ripped jeans and black boots, he was another person comparing to this morning
“Oh yeah, but I resigned and became a chef” Ron nodded knowingly, his hand on Brandon’s back in a friendly manner “So, what’s your greatest achievement in life?”
“I’m not stopping you. Oh you got a bit of…” Draco chuckled and wiped Harry’s lips with his thumb “My lipstick…”
you” Harry said, walking out of the loo and locked the door magically, he stormed to their table quickly and stood in front of Draco
Draco rolled his eyes at his boyfriend’s humour. One of the things he loved about Harry was that he always managed to make Draco smile, always, it was surreal.
“Well you forced all of us to keep it as a secret so…” Hermione shrugged, she smacked Pansy gently and leaned back on her seat “Watch the opera”
“Well” Potter pulled out the parchment from his jeans’ pocket and read it to Draco “Dinner at the restaurant near the beach to watch the sunset and then…Hawaii Opera Theatre. Wait, Opera? How long will that be?”
“Bossy” Draco elbowed Harry at that and earned another laugh from the Auror, he beamed to himself and felt Potter’s arm around his slim waist, for the first time in years, he felt safe.
“What I’m trying to say is, let me try figuring out my feelings too” He sighed, leaning back and looked down at Potter. Perhaps, all those times he has been wondering about Potter was because he has feelings for him. Was Draco really that oblivious? Or was he just fooling himself? “How do you usually kiss someone you have feelings for, Potter? Show me”
“What? I’m not with her” Harry claimed, laughing a bit “Oh, is this about the rumour we’re back together?”
and we are sorry but we love you and we want you to be with Harry and today the thing Hermione was talking about Harry is that he thought you don’t like him because you kept flinching every time he tried to talk or because you literally ran away when he was giving you a massage, therefore he’s considering of giving this stupid little crush up, so for
“How do you know? We hate each other there, right?” He asked, and it was true, since they hated each other, Draco has never been able to see a soft side of Potter before “If you have feelings for me, then I’m sure the other me has feelings for you too” Harry told him, with his green eyes never left Draco’s gaze “Because you once told me, you’ve always loved me like I’ve always loved you, there won’t be a universe or a time where we wouldn’t be together, it’s simply impossible, because we’re meant to be”
“You are not” Hermione pushed a lock of hair behind Theo’s ear and trailed her soft hand down his face “Have you ever considered…you love him too much? That’s why it hurts?”
He glared at the man above him “We are going to do this” He said, breathing out heavily “Give me a moment” He said and Potter went quiet, he leaned down and kissed the corner of Draco’s mouth, he moved and sucked on the blond’s lips, then sliding his tongue in again, Draco melted into the kiss but still flinched a bit when Potter started moving
“Then I’ll be pretty embarrassed because I ran here all the way here without a shirt” Potter chuckled, rubbing the nape of his neck “Do you…”
“So, did you know the whole threat Hermione got was in Pansy’s plan all along?” Draco said when Harry carried him through the hall
” Harry jolted and the ring fell from his hand down to the floor, he bent down to pick it up and looked up at Draco only to realise he was on one knee again
fell for me?” Draco smile’s widened on its own, he was filled with joy. Just when he thought he couldn’t like Harry more than he already has. Harry nodded and he leaned over, kissing his flushed cheek “You’re cute, Harry” The Gryffindor beamed, pulling Draco in a hug, and once again, Draco never stopped feeling safe when Harry was with him.
“Are you allowed to be this sweet?” He teased back, leaning in for another kiss, he liked it, the feeling of their lips meeting each other, he felt like he’d never get enough of it “Tell me, Auror Potter, just how much do you like me?”
night was normal until Harry found a ring under the table, he bent down on one knee to take it, and as soon as he looked up, the restaurant was clapping at them, thinking Harry had just proposed, Draco was equally shocked that moment. Harry didn’t know what to do then, but somehow Draco said yes and took the ring anyway, probably to avoid the scene they’d make if Draco had said no. After that, they received their first
back at the house. And since they were at a Muggle restaurant, he couldn’t really Apparate away. Not to mention, he embarrassed himself by bumping into a waiter, spilling all the wine over Draco’s clothes, he could not feel more guilty than this “I can’t believe that happened”
“Well, that’s 2 more” Pansy cocked her head to the side, leaning on Hermione’s shoulder “Take me home, darling”
“That’s obvious” Draco scoffed, looking at Ron, who was leaning on Blaise, he seemed wasted already “10 Galleons Ron will pass out before Ginny”
“I told you not to give me gloves” Draco shook his head, appreciating the gesture but gloves won’t work on him “You know it doesn’t work, I have tried it”
Ron gasped when the guy opened the door in, honestly he thought that the guy didn’t look like a normal stripper at all. If anything, he looked like a high class stripper who only do fancy performances and stuff, which he was. He wasn’t as tall as Ron, but his body was lean, wearing a Slytherin robes and even has his hood on, the robes was covering his whole body but Ron could hear the clicking sound of his heels on the floor, his long blond hair falling down his chest, the mask has covered his whole face so Ron couldn’t even really see what the guy looked like, just his eyes under the dark light of the room “A Slytherin uniform?”
“Hey, Malfoy” Potter’s face lightened up when he saw Draco, the blond pushed some of his hair behind his ear and swallowed hard, he waited until Potter was in front of him before he finally spoke
“Okay” Hermione said, winking at them both “We’ll go, see you this Sunday. You’re in good hands, Harry’s a good guy” She said with a warm smile, and walked back to her car together with Pansy
Draco could read from his father’s lips now and he watched him folded his hands over his chest, huffing out angrily.
” He bit on his lower lip and pulled Potter in a tight embrace when he felt the length being pushed into him. It hurts, that was all he could feel, it fucking hurt like a fucking bitch when Potter pushed in, it felt like his hole was going to break, could it break?
“We will visit my parents too” Draco chimed in to help when Potter stuttered, he assumed they’d also share time with his parents, considering his parents in this world were nicer than his own world, especially his father “We haven’t figured out the exact time yet, but we will discuss it after the party tonight, as long as the Hufflepuff girls don’t make us drink” He laughed as the girls nodded along, so he was right. After living here for more than a month, he was getting better at improvising
Draco was startled when Theodore called them from behind, he looked at his friend with a soft smile as Pansy clapped for him
”What are you saying? You’re the best thing that’s ever happened to me, you are my whole world” Harry said, leaning his forehead against Draco “I don’t care what the world thinks”
“Potter?” He said and Potter looked at him, finally, he swallowed hard before speaking up again “Er, so, here’s the thing”
“I found your shoes” He said, giving her the shoes as she sat down on the chair in the hall. When he was in the other world, Luna was the kindest one, Draco got the chance to see her true self without holding any prejudice against her, and it felt nice, she was nice. So she was the first one he decided to apologise for “Do you mind if I talk to you for a bit?”
“I fucking love you” Blaise said while chuckling, his hand at the nape of Ron’s neck, pushing him close
“I, maybe not” He said and glanced at Potter quickly before looking back at the girls “I’m not feeling well and-…”
He was a part of Luna and Ginny’s family just five years ago, the two of them have been together way before that, since Eighth Year in Hogwarts to be exact. They were
“Or maybe you can sit on Harry’s lap” Ron chimed in with a devilish smile, making Pansy jumped out of Hermione’s embrace with a beaming smile on her face too. He didn’t know how or when, but at one point Pansy and Ron have become close friends. And that wasn’t even the weird part, it puzzled him more that both of them were the most supportive ones to encourage Harry to make a move on Draco.
“Can we play some new game?” Padma raised her arm and they all looked at her “We’ve all played those games a lot”
Pansy chuckled loudly, their plan B was quite insane, she was hoping they wouldn’t have to use it “Let’s hope this works”
“Oh, okay” He nodded, turning his head to look at Harry. He raised his finger up, telling Harry to wait for him for a minute. Harry nodded and he turned back at Ernie, who still has that shy look on his face “What’s wrong?”
Ginny jumped at him from behind, scaring Draco with her loud words, he has gotten used to calling them by their first names, since he has to actually call them like that, it’s become somewhat natural for him to say “Stop standing at the corner, have fun!”
“Glad to know that’s your choice” Pansy smirked, smacking him softly before sashaying away to Hermione’s spot. For Potter, he was practically skipping to Draco’s place with joy. He wondered if the Potter in his world would also show this side of his to Draco.
He gaped at her, he didn’t know that she knew about it. He turned to look at Harry, who was beaming at him and the newfound the secret “It’s not that big of a deal, Harry”
“Er, I was bitten” Potter said, sitting down on the bed near him and rolling up his sleeves, showing Draco his forearm “I think it might be infectious”
” Ron laughed out loud when Harry stared at him “What? Can’t your best mate joke around when you’re in a foul mood?”
going out nor fucking anyone at the moment” Draco gave him a knowing smirk “He hasn’t been for a while now, you’re his roommate, you should know. Is that what you want to ask?”
, though you have proposed to me a million times, made me cry a million times, and I’ve said yes a million times as well, I never got the chance to tell you how much I love you back. I have never told anyone this, but, the first time you smiled to me after the war, I screamed in my pillow for a whole minute” Harry couldn’t help but grinned at that “When you first laughed at my joke, I couldn’t shut up about it for days”
“That’s understandable” Pansy flashed a sly smile before letting him in, her house was dark, with a few candles lightened up the wide hall. Now that he truly looked at her, Pansy was wearing a silver backless sequin cocktail dress. Seven years ago if anyone asked him what Pansy was wearing, he wouldn’t have a clue, but being with Draco has broaden his mind. She led him to the big living room, which was now transformed into an empty room, with a exactly four round dinner tables in the room, one chandelier shining bright on the ceiling above, Pansy led him to the table in the middle of the room and pulled a chair out for him.
“I, okay, I, er, I might…I think I, well, er, I have to admit something, I…I have feelings for you, romantic and…other types of feelings too” Harry swallowed hard, watching Draco’s reactions changed just so slightly that he could barely notice it “I, for four years now. No, wait, actually, that’s when I realised I like you, but I’m not sure when I started having feelings for you, maybe even longer than that. And, I really enjoy all our dinners together, and sometimes when people think we’re a couple, I…I kind of like it, but er, I never had the courage to tell you. And you know, we have this special proposal thing we always do, and maybe you don’t know, but every time you said yes to my fake proposal, I felt…I felt like my feelings for you kept growing, and at some point, I wanted to
“See you at the party” Potter said, following Granger to where Weasley was standing, leaving Pansy back, glaring at him
“Yeah, I heard” Pansy grinned at the sight of her wife “I’m going to make you a hella big chocolate candy”
Draco sighed, rummaging through his pocket before pulling out a Chocolate Frog and placing it in Potter’s warm palm. He was crazy for doing this, but there was something about Potter he just couldn’t deny “Here, you only get this once”
Draco. If there was a moment in time Harry regretted the most, it would be years ago when he should have just confessed to Draco instead of chickened out. Draco’s eyes were opened, looking at Harry guiltily as he was still devoured by Brandon, they locked eyes and Harry knew what Draco was thinking. The blond was still confused about the whole proposal thing, but Harry knew his place, him and Brandon were still a couple, so he turned on his heel and Apparated away.
“I know” Hermione replied “He told Ron and I, Ron said he should have just destroyed your wand anyway, while I…I’m not proud to say this, but I said he shouldn’t have given it back”
“You asked me to tutor Weasley, I said no, and now every Professor is telling me to tutor him? Was it you?”
“What does it look like I’m doing?” Draco groaned, switching leg and put his right leg on the tub “I’m shaving”
“So what happened? You two didn’t kiss?” Pansy’s face appeared in the green flames, she immediately Flooed him after they got home. Turned out Ginny did have some really bad hot dogs from the Muggle vendors, but the Healer gave her potions and guaranteed she’d be up and strong again by tomorrow
we’d be together too. But perhaps I’m wrong, maybe I’m just in love with the version of you in that world”
?” He squeaked “Alright just push it all in” He said and grimaced when it went in deeper, how far could a cock go?
“Don’t finish that” Draco chuckled “I—Potter and I, we’re not like you guys, we don’t have an easy history. Even though, sure, Potter and I have been on good terms lately, but I’m not sure if he likes me, what if I just embarrassed myself, then I’d have to change my dorm because I cannot stay in the same place with him every single day?”
“Where is Lord Black and his heir?” she asked. “I heard from a few rumors that Mister Potter claimed quite a few titles over the last few days.”
Ammit admitted as he flicked his tongue out onto Harry’s side. Harry nodded in agreement, he didn’t know when he fell asleep or how long it was until he woke to the sound of someone knocking on his door.
"You-you mean to tell me that, you think we," he stopped, gasping for breath as he continued laughing. Draco growled and stood up, slamming his hand down on Harry-Lefay's desk.
Draco didn’t know how long he'd been out, but the fire was long cold by the time he woke. Something moved to his left, his hand reflexively going to his wand.
Tatsuya stated. Harry blinked at him, it must be a first for Tatsuya then. To have someone with three tails already this young, he thought. Seeming to read his thoughts Tatsuya nodded.
“Yes, guests. Did you really forg-,” Sirius stopped in his tracks and turned to look at Harry. “Actually… we didn’t get a chance to tell you last night, huh,” Sirius bit his lip and smiled apologetically.
“I think he thinks you’re a hatchling,” Charlie hollered. Harry bit the inside of his lip as his cheeks went red.
The second spear of the day came out with another sickening pop and the black dragon winced. Growling quietly, but didn’t make a move towards Harry. He exhaled the breath he'd been holding and threw the spear to the ground, looking for the next one. The last spear was higher up, right on the dragon’s hip. He looked at the dragon’s face again, swallowing. Taking a deep breath and puffing his chest a little he climbed up the dragon’s back leg to the spear. Harry rubbed his hands together to warm them up before grabbing the spear and tugging. This time it really didn’t want to come out, and when it did it sounding like bones cracking. Harry fell to the ground with a thud as the spear came out and the dragon’s tail came down hard right beside him.
LeFay’s stone eyes said otherwise as they looked down at Cadmael, his face tight. “Severus,” Harry said softly. Severus waved his wand, spelling the floor and the man clean again, and then tipping a calming draught down Cadmael’s throat, which he greedily accepted.
Draco raised his hands to his head, stressing at his hair before dropping his hands to his neck, disappointed when he found nothing there to ground him. Nothing to remind him with a hundred percent certainty that what they had was real. He sighed, glancing at his full length mirror. His horns, wings, talons, and tail still showed, letting him know that their bond had still yet to settle. It made him anxious, knowing that when it faded away it could be for two reasons, and with how everything was looking now he was worried it wouldn’t be what he wanted.
“N-Nothing, I’m guessing you’re ready to leave?” Sirius asked as he eyed the snake wrapping around his son. Harry nodded and then headed to the front of the store, stroking the snake’s back as Sirius paid for him. As they left the store Sirius looked over at the two, and seeing the affection between them blossoming already made him smile. He was glad Harry had found something that called to him. “Do you know the name of your familiar already by chance?” Sirius asked when he remembered the fact his son was a parselmouth.
“The scars… Are they from fighting with Voldemort over the last year?” Draco asked as he finished writing down all his classes and put them in an envelop to send to Hogwarts.
“Ah, Harry. You slept in for quite a while. Remus and Sirius wanted to stay till you woke up, but it was best for them to leave quickly. Parvati had her own wounds and her sister to care for. McGonagall also needs to know what happened right away so she can figure out what precautions to take. Knowing her she’ll have all the bases covered, so I doubt we’ll have anything to worry about,” Bill explained as he got up and handed Harry a bowl of porridge. “Charlie has already started to try working with Draco but, it hasn’t been going very well,” he added.
Draco woke early, his eyes cloudy. Severus and his mother wouldn’t be awake yet, which gave him the perfect opportunity to leave without them trying to stop him. He had to know. He always had to know. Even if it did lead to a dead end, he had to know.
"I see you are short on words, come. I would like to get this over with as soon as possibly so I may return to my duties." Snape turned on his heel and headed back in the direction of his quarters. To Harry's surprise Ghost left his side and ran up ahead of him, keeping pace next to Severus' leg. If he didn't know any better it would almost appear as though the two were having a conversation of some kind.
“Narcissa Black Malfoy, and Draco Malfoy are going to swear their allegiance to you today. Narcissa would have to do it soon or later, but Draco needs to do it for your safety and his own. I’m also going to blood adopt Draco into the Black line. It will strengthen our family ties, making it impossible for Draco to hurt anyone within the Black bloodline against his will. That along with the unbreakable vows,” Sirius explained as he stopped what he was doing. Harry looked over at Narcissa and Draco, surprised.
Harry glanced around before continuing to unpack his things; working on his wandless magic as he did. He using it to float his clothes to his cabinet and drawers as well as clean areas to set new items up for display. He knew it would take a while before it became the homey room he wanted. Currently, it still resembled his room at the Dursley's, and being reminded of those years made him sick.
"Draco!" came a startled voice. Draco could hear table legs scrapping across the floor as he started to calm down, his head shaking as he looked up into the eyes of his father. "It's okay dragon. It was just a nightmare, are you okay?" Lucius asked as he stuck his hand out to his son.
“Did Minerva agree?” he asked as he started up the staircase, stopping on the step below Narcissa's.
Harry looked up at the eyes and nodded. He loved the warmth, and he promised. Anima reddetur votum, he mouthed. "Forever," he nuzzled into the warmth's neck, smiling slightly. This was the warmest he'd ever felt, and the light shinning on him didn't hurt his eyes like he expected.
"He's fine, you saved him. Now you need to wake up. He's worried sick about you," Harry smiled gently. Draco looked confused, and then pulled away.
“After more investigation it has also come to my, and the council’s attention that the death of the Greyback family has been covered up, as well as had the evidence tampered with. The true killer was not Fenrir Greyback that slaughtered his wife and child, but one Albus Dumbledore during an Order raid, where the then came upon Cadmael Greyback,” August explained.
"Yes headmaster?" Harry stammered, his eyes looking between the headmaster and the striped creature next to Snape.
Harry and Severus both jumped to their feet, wands drawn as the battle rolled into another room. "Harry! Stay here!" Snape snapped as he ran around the door frame that lead into his small kitchen. In the middle of the floor was a bloodied and shaking Ghost, teeth barred as he corned what had tried to attack Severus. It was a snake, and Severus recognized it immediately. "Nagini!" he snarled before he blasted the snake. Green left the end of his wand, hitting the snake squarely in the face. She laid still for the longest time as both Draco and Snape caught their breaths.
A sudden wave of magic and pleasure hit both of them as the last strand of magic snapped into place, leaving both exhausted and lying in a heap after what had just occurred. Moonlight streamed in around them and Draco was suddenly aware of the grass underneath his back and the sweet smell of the flowers filled his nose. LeFay was crumpled against his chest, panting lightly, while resting his eyes. When he glanced up he was met with brilliant violet eyes brimming with emotion. Harry smiled sweetly before leaning up to kiss Draco.
“Neat trick kid, but that's not gonna stop me. I’ve been waiting far too long for this to let some barely out of the shell dragonling to show me up. Should have heard him when we were fucking,” Cadmael purred as he turned on his heel, glancing around him, trying to spot Draco through the dust cloud.
Harry woke in the same state he did before, panting heavily as he looked around. Seeing that he was, in deed, still in his room he slumped back into his bed. Lifting his arm so that they covered his eyes. “Ugh… At least they aren’t nightmares about Volde anymore,” he said quietly.
Draco’s eyes widened a second, confusion written on his face for just a moment before Hisashi nodded slowly and winked at him, slowly realization enveloped him and he nodded. “Of course, if that's what you wish,” he smirked. He stood slowly once he realized what Hisashi wanted him here for, pulling his robes off and then reached for his shirt.
“Could you bring that man from up front back here please?” Harry asked. The employee nodded and headed to get Sirius, leaving Harry with the snake.
Harry did take into consideration what his father had told him earlier, and turned away from the owl area. “Something I’m drawn to huh,” he mumbled to himself as he looked around the store. He continued to walk around before stopping in a rather shabby and abandoned looking area in the back of the shop. There was a shelf with a few cages, most of them seeming to be empty or full of crickets and mice to feed to other animals in the store.
Charlie slowly stepped out from behind the rock, creeping around it followed by the rest of the group. The dragon didn’t make a move. Something caught Severus attention however and he stopped, squinting at a pile of rocks a few yards ahead of them.
“Ambassadors for the merpeople in Hogwart’s lake I think. For ambassadors they were talking an awful lot of smack about who they were representing and I just…,” Harry paused as he stabbed another apple piece with his finger nail and took a bite out of it, “If you don’t like who you are working for than you should quit. Not make their lives miserable by doing shit work for them. Same goes with if you were to fight along with someone or were someone like Voldemort,” Draco cringed at the name, “You would want loyal people that supported you, not someone that didn’t actually want to help you. Then you wouldn’t know when they would turn on you, or like those representatives, do a shit job,” Harry finished ranting.
Opening the drawer he started rummaging through it until something on Draco’s desk caught his attention. A purple and black box sat there with a letter addressed to Harry. He glanced around to see if the person that left it was still in his room.
“Bill wait!” Charlie yelled, “We need a plan!” Charlie took off after, leaving only Harry, Snape, and Draco.
He sprinted forward as the singing continued. Feeling his heart race, as the song started to near its end.
“Sirius!” Harry yelled and ran over to him, placing his hand on the dark fur. He turned, watching Remus and Bill fighting the Nagas off, trading spells while working together to help each other dodge the tail of the Nagas. Remus tried to dodge the next one but was caught by one of the Nagas' four arms and thrown to the side. Bill rolled under the tail but tripped when he came back up. The tail was posed to slam down on top of Bill till Harry ran to the side of it.
LeFay lifted his head, eyes going wide as he took in the site before him. The stars seemed to be shining just out of arms reach above him, and the purple along Draco's scales shimmered like magic itself in the moonlight.
“Sirius! You do not tell you son that he is hot!” Remus countered and cuffed Black over the head. Looking back at Harry, Remus sighed for a moment and shook his head but smiled. “I have to agree with him though. How did you get the cuts so precise? It looks like they’ve always been that way,” Remus stated as he got up to move closer, admiring Harry’s work.
Sirius didn’t respond at all to the accusation of his son; his face pale, as Hermione pushed her way forward. Before Hermione could say more Sirius put his hand out and squeezed her shoulder.
"Unless what?" LeFay asked as he finished filing the contracts away in his desk. "Unless I want something else other than his help with the all this?" he gestured to the room full of papers and books lying open.
“Oh, I’m about to make your life so much better in so many ways,” Skoll stated with a wide devilish smile.
Then the words just came to him. “I told you because I wanted to show you that I’m not just the boy-who-lived, or some Golden Boy. I showed you because I wanted you to know that what I do isn’t because I want attention. It’s because I want to make sure no one ends up like me,” Harry turned around and faced Draco, determination lighting his eyes.
“Only the estates and such going to Harrison, but we’ve already discussed most of it,” he told the goblin.
“Draco,” Narcissa called to get the attention of her son as he lifted Bubo from the back of the chair to his arm. “Here are my things, please make yourself as comfortable as possible. We’ll be staying here for quite a while.”
That was Parvati’s voice, Harry said to himself. Looking around the corner he could make out Dean and Seamus, and one other he didn’t recognize surrounding Parvati. He scowled and tightened his grip on the wall. The unknown student pushed Parvati against the wall and spat at her.
“The dragon didn’t seem anywhere as big as the Hungarian Horntail you faced, or the Ukrainian Ironbelly in Gringotts. I think most of the students said it was only about thirty feet long from head to tail. A Horntail is about fifty feet long, hints as to why the rest of it is so big. From the descriptions, the dragon was probably a juvenile Hebridean Black, full grown but not in it’s prime. It’s also a local species so it’s not completely unusual for this to happen. It probably wandered from the MacFusty’s sanctuary because it was pushed out by an older dragon,” Luna stated, waving her hand about before leaning on Neville. “I heard Charlie is coming from Romania in a day or so to help out.”
Ghost's ears flicked as Harry stroked the porcupine like mane down his back. "How'd you know all this?" Harry asked.
Draco woke again for the second time, this time, he was too groggy to react to the panic building in his chest. Opening his eyes he saw Severus, sitting on a chair next to the cot he lay on. This time he could feel a heavy blanket over his body, and some how he could smell the sticking charm that kept him from moving. He growled, eyes narrowing as his hairy toes clenched against the bottom of the cot. Severus looked up from his book and half smiled before setting it down. "You gave us quite the scare there for a moment. Thought you would bleed out," Severus stated. Draco huffed, curling his lip and snarling.
“They will be here within the hour,” hopefully, Remus thought to himself. “They went out shopping for supplies.” Damn he felt cornered, yet he had to hold his ground. Sirius was depending on him to give off a strong front. One of the reasons Sirius had planned them moving in around the full moon was so Remus had the extra boost of confidence from his wolf. Though he doubted they would feel safe here after he turned.
“Well, it’s Harry,” Theo stated, confused as he looked down at him before extending a hand to help him up.
“No, it wasn’t Harry. Not the Harry you all know. That," he sighed, "That was the real Harry LeFay,” Remus said softly.
He felt pleasure as he answered Draco, “It’s because it’s part of my domain. Kind of like how unicorns can keep it spring for long terms or how frost creatures can keep it cold. It’s just a type of magic that settles around some magical creatures’ domains. Their homes,” he explained, “Now to business."
"No, no. I'm good. I'll just head back downstairs," Neville said from his bed. Harry waited as it took Neville a moment to actually start moving. As he walked past them Neville made a big circle around them, slowing down when he neared the door and then stopping. "He's actually kind of cute isn't he," Neville commented as he looked back at the hyena chewing on the fruit bar. Harry smiled in and nodded. Neville smiled back and then headed down the stairs.
Leaning his head back onto the headboard behind him he continued to mull over everything that had occurred. Draco could obviously take care of himself now, the full adult growth of his true dragon form was all he needed to be convinced of that, but was he ready for a real relationship like this. With his, LeFay swallowed at the thought, mate. Not that it was a bad thing, it intrigued him and put him on edge sometimes but his main worry was still Draco. Would he really be able to handle seeing him in a different light.
Slowly, Harry made his way down Draco's back. When he reached it he squatted down, grabbing it with both hands and pulled. It came out with a sickening pop as a loud roar followed soon after. Harry dropped to his stomach and grabbed hold of one of the spines as the dragon shifted, standing and almost flattening Harry against the ceiling. Harry could hear Charlie yelling something as he squeezed his eyes shut.
"Okay, okay. That's enough you two," Harry sighed as he caught the candle and put it back up. The tiger huffed at him before changing back into the wizard version of Theo. He picked up Hermione in his arms before placing her in the bathroom with her clothes. "That's pretty cool. Specially since you are so accustom to shifting that your clothes shift with you. I thought the Maltese Tiger was just a normal tiger though," Harry tilted his head as Theo walked back from the bathroom.
Draco made sure to keep an eye out for any movement, especially black blurs that could be the person he was looking for. He rubbed his arms to try and get warmer before tucking his hands under his arm pits. Hopefully he could keep them from getting frostbitten without gloves. He'd started to lose hope when he smelled a fire close by, smirking a bit he made his way forward till he stumbled upon a small cabin. It looked run down. Possibly abandoned, if not for the smoke stack coming from its chimney. Something about the cabin looked familiar and he reached into his coat pocket to check. Holding up the picture beside the cabin he recognized it as the rumored vampire hive. He gritted his teeth and started forward, taking his chances that these vampires were friendly rather than freezing to death in the snow. He stomped the snow off his boots onto the porch, trying to peek into the window before knocking. It occurred to him, that if there was vampires, they surely wouldn't need a fire going. Unless it was more than just a few vampires living here.
Tom chuckled, "It's okay. I know it will take time to get used to." He pulled a chair from the side of the room and placed it next to Draco's, sitting down slowly.
When they got to Gringotts it was rather busy. Many stood around with very impatient expression. It would seem the Potter's and Black's weren't the only ones to get letters.
Harry nodded and turned, stopping when he realized the Striped Hyena wasn't following him. Frowning he looked from Snape to Ghost.
he said. Harry paused in the middle of pulling on a pair of skinny jeans Kristin had tailored for him.
Harry replied as he stroked Ammit’s head. Harry looked over at Draco, still flopped on the bed, and chuckled quietly. Draco lifted his head and glared at Potter. Scooting up the bed, he turned and sat with his back facing Potter. Ammit slithered down from Harry as the raven-head made his way over to the bed, placing his hands onto it bed and leaning on them.
“We! You mean I was, before you decided to go on a rampage demanding we let him sleep longer!” Remus wheezed as he straightened and dusted himself off. Harry was still smiling at the two as they started to bicker.
"I was still coming to from being memory wiped and 'sedated' so many times. After Albus died I suppose I had started to emerge, but I don't think I really surfaced till after claiming my titles. Even then it took a few months, and-."
Harry turned his attention to Charlie, “The green and purple one? Yea. What is it?” Harry asked. Charlie shrugged.
Neville looked over at Harry, sympathetic to his blight. He had heard from Harry how bad it had been at that house of horrors with his muggle relatives. He doubted heavily that Harry had even talked to Sirius or Remus about it.
Severus shifted from foot to foot, this was not a discussion he ever wanted to have. Definitely not with someone who could smite him for one miss step. “That is concerning,” he paused, “However, the wolf does not feel remorse for those that attack her pups. Nor does the big cat feel remorse for those he chases from his territory. I think, if I may say this, that you have yet to accept who and what you really are,” Severus turned with a sigh, waving LeFay to sit as he flicked his wrist and the door closed. LeFay took the seat, eyes glued to Severus as the older man sat across from him. “You aren’t just a wizard, and even without your wizard half, you wouldn’t be human. In all intensive purposes, Lord LeFay, you are an animal with animal instincts. As ‘humans’ we have this notion of right and wrong, that we created as a society. The animal kingdom, bloody hell, all of the rest of the natural kingdom has no notion of this. You, Draco, Cadmael, the wolf pack, all of you have this primal connection that lets you be so much closer to your true selves. Denying those parts of you, calling yourself a monster because you don’t feel everything quite the same as everyone else, or because you have vastly different needs isn’t healthy. Not for what and who you are. If you had stayed, perhaps you would understand more, and Sirius could walk you threw it but,” Severus paused again, licking his lips, dare he say it? “With how much you tell Draco off about not being the person you used to be, you compare yourself far too often to that same person. Yes, he was you at a time, but everyone changes throughout their lifetime. You just happened to go from a human normal life to one filled with so much mystery that it was probably overwhelming. Not to mention all the trauma, and I know for a fact you have yet to sit down with a mind healer,” he stopped, grimacing when he saw LeFay tense more, his hand twitching like it wanted to throw a hex at the old potions master, Severus swallowed, “And if any of this hadn’t been true, you would have put me in my place already. After all, I am sworn to you as your subordinate and I have spoken to you in a very disrespectful manner. I know you’ve done some research into your current state as someone with a creature inheritance, but, as of this conversation, it has been brought to my attention that it hasn’t been nearly enough.”
Everyone head to Hogwarts to set up what they will need to keep the two boys safe. Or at least as safe as they can be. With the new influx of people coming into their inheritances late, and some of them being trigger by the after effects of the war it's no wonder people are super stressed.
"Are you feeling okay?" Harry asked, turning around to face the younger man. Draco nodded, a smile forming across his face as he grabbed LeFay's hand and pulled him close.
“The castle has catacombs?” Luna asked as she sat up. Hermione scowled and Luna apologized before there was an announcement over the coms.
“Harry, Draco hasn’t been seen since the dragon attacked the school, neither has Parvati. Dean and Seamus are both in critical care. Along with some other students it stumbled into on its way out,” Hermione explained. Harry’s eyes widened. A dragon? He had flash backs of fourth year and the tournament before shaking his head.
Harry explained to the snake as he sat up and rubbed his head. He blinked a few times, swearing Draco had purple eyes before he sat up, but they were his normal grey. He decided it must have been due to him almost blacking out.
Letting go, LeFay turned and motioned for Draco to follow, only Draco was frozen. Both because of the sheer terror he'd just felt, and because of the way his body had reacted on it's own to the contact. It still felt warm were LeFay’s hand had been and the collar was vibrating against his skin.
“Harry! Breakfast is done!” Remus yelled up to the attic from the small set of stairs; continuing to stare at the door till he heard a faint thud. The welcoming sound of feet hitting the floor. He left with a smile and then headed back down the stairs, leaving Harry to finish getting up.
"Oh Harry," a soft voice said in his ear. He turned and Hermione let go of him as he did. He lifted a paw to wipe his face only to have Hermione hold onto it, smiling sadly at him. "I'll do everything I can to help you find Draco and Parvati," she said softly. The others nodded, causing Harry to smile a little. He had such good friends. He looked down at his shredded clothes and let out a sigh.
“What seems to be amiss?” Draco questioned as he made his way over to the fire. Remus looked tired and worn standing beside Sirius.
Draco’s eyes whipped up to Harry’s face as shivers fell down his spine. He took a step back from Harry and swallowed. His eyes reminded him of Nagi's just before she killed.
The water soaked his clothes chilled him to the bone as he made his way over to the dragon’s head. Harry stood in waist high water, looking over the calm dark scaly head in front of him. Sighing he set his hand next to its eye. “I’m sorry I got you into this mess,” Harry whispered. Stroking the brow ridge he could feel how cold the dragon’s scales where. “I’ll make sure you come back.” Harry nodded firmly, looking up at the sky for a moment.
“How did it go?” he asked. Remus was grinning from ear to ear like a goof before he tried to school his expression. Clearing his throat and straightening his clothes with a few quick tugs.
Theo looked at Neville, tilting his head a bit before turning his attention back to Harry. “I remember lots of different scents hitting me all at once, and the sounds from outside,” he stopped and pinched the bridge of his nose.
LeFay was about to retort that Tatsuya didn't know Draco as well as LeFay knew him when there was a knock at the study door. Turning his head he frowned. No one else was scheduled for today, at least he thought there wasn't. The arrowhead on his desk glowed for a moment, catching LeFay's eye. "Come in," he said as he swept the arrowhead pendant up in his hand and placed it on his neck. He tucked it in under his shirt and against his skin as the door opened.
“Huh? What is it-oh harr-HARRY!” Sirius put down the paper as he looked at his adopted son, eyes bulging. Harry straightened and then twirled on a single paw, his eyes mischievous as he faced his dads again. He wore a pair of black muggle skinny jeans that he’d cut at the knee, for the fox half of his legs, along with a v cut on the back of them for his tails to poke through. He tried to keep as much of the belt line and loops he could. A studded belt crossed above his tails and secured his pants to his hips so that the v cut in the back didn’t affect his pants’ ability to stay up. His shirt was a dark green v-neck t-shirt made of polyester and spandex with satin around the collar and sleeve ends. The back of it, starting from his neck and down to his bum, was shredded horizontally and stretched to create a ribbed pattern down his back.
"I think we should house them together, it will hopefully keep this from happening again. I'll send some one up here to bandage you arm," Severus stated as he started to walk away and then stopped. "I'm glad you are back Tom. Even if the circumstances around you acquiring your soul  and mind again are at a cost. To think all this time he planned all of this. For us to fall for this trap, for you to loose yourself in the power he forced upon you, and then almost made you kill your own flesh and blood. If I had known."
“Harry, you never told us you had a rack that size,” Sirius chuckled mischievously. Harry rolled his eyes and pushed his face against Sirius’ chest, earning him a few scratches behind his ears. Remus laughed and patted Harry’s fur covered shoulder before Harry stepped back to change.
Harry looked over the letters before standing up to follow; only to feel extremely light headed when he moved. His eyesight went fuzzy as he leaned on the table for support and waited for the spell to pass. It had been happening frequently lately, and Harry thought it had something to do with his restless sleep. If Dumbledore had lied about Sirius being able to claim the Lordship, then what else did he lie about? Harry frowned as he turned over the thought in his mind and headed to his room. To make up for the missed schooling during the war the Headmistress at Hogwarts was holding an eighth year class that was starting soon. He was nervous, and still trying to settle into living at Black Manor. He'd chosen the attic as his room do, mostly, to the view from the round window. Yet, there were also enchantments on the door and small living area already set up, conveniently for him. Though he didn’t really have anything to take up the vast space. Sirius had at first tried to get Harry to choose a different room but Harry had managed to convince him, with help from Remus, that I little space would be good for him.
Severus smiled, but it faulted slightly when he looked at Draco in his animagus form. Draco seemed distraught, and he had to wonder why. Apparently Draco had made quite the impression so far, so he'd thought his godson would have been pleased. Yet it didn't seem like it. "Well, there is something you should know about Ghost..." he trailed off as Ghost jumped from his spot, his mane standing on end as he vaulted himself at Snape. At least that was what it looked like to Harry till the african beast cleared Severus's head and landed on the other side of the chair. There was a crash and loud snapping of teeth, along with something else.
McGonagall stood at her post along with the other teachers on guard, her eyes burning behind her glasses. Another day had passed and no Harry or the others, only the ex-Death Eaters that continuously ate at the wards. They would come down soon and McGonagall had to insure the few students still here would be safe. Most had been evacuated through the floo in the night, and only a few that didn’t have immediate family had stayed. The wards faltered for a moment, flashing brightly before stabilizing.
Harry remembered when he'd first left and ended up smack dab in the middle of Slytherin Manor. Falling to his knees from the massive magic usage that day six years ago; Winky and Dinky didn’t even ask who he was and how he had gotten there. They just went to work helping him to a couch for rest and food for energy.
Tatsuya said. LeFay held the picture between his fingers for a long moment before glaring while it burst into flames and turned to ash in his hand.
“The fact it hasn’t broken explains a lot. Sudden mood swings, random floods and droughts of my magic.” LeFay’s voice was softer than it'd been throughout the whole conversation, “You seem very fond of it,” he noted.
The Nagas yelled. It threw Sirius to the side, slamming him against a rock. The Grim yelped and then went still.
Harry nodded and then slowly opened the box, his eyes widening. Inside where five rings, each made with unique metals. “There is an order to how you need to put them on, but I think they are in that order already. First is Potter, than Peverell, Gryffindor, Slytherin, and after that LeFay,” Remus said as he leaned forward in his seat, pointing to each as he listed them. Harry nodded slowly as he gazed at the each one. The Potter ring resized to his finger as soon as it touched his skin, the gold tinted metal tightening snugly as the amethyst set into the ring winked at him. The Peverell reacted a bit slower to his touch, and then blended with his Potter ring, causing the amethyst and blue diamond to sit side by side. The white metal from the Peverell ring mixed with the gold of the Potter ring, creating an almost fiery white color.
Snape's head snapped almost painfully back to the child. "Aww, welcome back to the land of the living mister Potter," Severus sneered. He couldn't help the small smile that wanted to form at the corner of his mouth.
"Welcome Ashleigh, Lady of Shadows. Late as always I see," LeFay spoke, eyeing the vixen from his seat.
Harry sighed and then sat down on the ground, leaning against Draco’s tail since it still blocked his path. When Harry noticed the dragon was staring at him, he scrunched his nose and stuck his tongue out at the dragon. It tilted its head in response. “I can’t just stay here!” Harry shouted over his shoulder. Charlie had to agree. Severus came over from the fire to where Charlie and Bill stood, examining the pickle Potter seemed to be in.
LeFay squeezed Draco tighter, "I've always accepted you Draco. I'm just never sure you will accept me, what I am now. I'm afraid you'll see me as that kid that was under Albus' thumb all those years ago, and not the man I am today. I'm afraid you'll find something you don't like and realize I'm not what who you thought I was," he said as he buried his face into Draco's neck.
"Sorry about that Neville," Harry stated as he let out a relieved sigh. Neville nodded and slowly relaxed, his eyes never left the creamy animal at Harry's feet though. Harry felt a bit guilty, but he had to admit it was a little funny watching the hyena with a sloped back try to get up a staircase while chasing Neville. "Is there anything I can do too-." Neville shook his head violently.
“Draco, you're awake,” Snape smiled. It was the first real smile Harry ever believed he had seen on the usually dower man. Charlie looked relieved as well before poking the still sleeping Bill Weasly in the shoulder. Bill groaned and rolled over.
His hands slipped in between then green branches of the bushes as he walked through the maze, and as he drew closer to the end of it he could feel the power radiating from its center. He pulled the collar of the robe around him tighter as a breeze brushed past him, cutting through the thin fabric and onto his naked flesh. Draco understood what he was headed towards but was it really necessary to be dressed in basically nothing? He grumbled quietly before the first wave of magic hit him. He stumbled hard, falling to his knees just as he came to the center of the maze. The garden opened up in front of him in the darkness as wave after wave of uncontrolled magic hit him.
