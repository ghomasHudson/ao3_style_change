“I remember the basic governing style. Some goblin wars from history class. Honestly, I barely remember the classes, most of what British wizarding skills I know I taught myself from my school books. I only remember the creepy headmaster really. It’s like from the moment he picks me up to the moment he drops me off is a giant blur.” Draco frowned.
“I’m Laney Esmerelda Dragma and he’s Hadrian Piers Dragma.” Snape gave a sharp nod.
No, he left here free, or in a body bag.
Or was that just when you thought I was a muggle-born gypsy oh great one.” Alex winced and wilted under her harsh sneer and Lily pulled him closer to her before giving a small smile.
“What if that doesn’t work James?”
“I will one day, and you won’t stop me.”
Unbidden, Hadrian felt a deep longing for the massive mint green sweater in his real trunk. It was XXL, with cotton that was beginning to pill, and a cute pig face stitched into the corner. He’d had it for as long as he could remember knowing Laney. She’d give it to him the first day she’d found him shivering on a curbside, trying to keep him warm. Annabee also loved the sweatshirt, always crawling into the folds whether he was in the shirt or not. His little clingy honeybee and his chaotic twin. Suni usually dozed in the front hanging pocket, as much as she could anymore now that she wasn’t a one foot baby anymore.
He had plenty of that left to give.
Best case scenario, he sneaks out no problem.
“I’m Sara Anderson, please just call me Sara. This is my wife Erin Dragma. We’re pleased to meet you! You’re Severus Snape, our children’s head of house, right? Minerva was talking to us along the way. I’m glad to see you in person however! As long as we’re not here because certain people,” An amused glance towards the twins was sent. Only Laney grinned bashfully as Hadrian was too busy cooing over his little sister to care. “Decided to blow up a sink again.”
Draco soon shambled down the stairs. His parents following quickly behind him. The blonde looked relieved to plop himself down next to his paramour, stealing sips from the younger man’s mug. Hadrian didn’t bother chiding him, smiling indulgently. Lucius gratefully poured him and his wife some coffee and sat down at the table. Hadrian peeked around.
Hadrian’s eyes fluttered open to a strangely tall and flat ceiling. Odd. His ceiling was vaulted at home wasn’t it? Because he was on the second floor with Laney, and it was also a popcorn ceiling, not ivory paneling. It wasn’t the dorms either, those were made of stone. Slowly, he craned his head and looked around. Wincing at the pounding in his skull, his thoughts were also foggy and hard to grasp. His entire body ached.
“Nonsense. He’ll meet a variety of people in his life. This is good practice.”
She missed her brother dearly already.
“I figured your guests might prefer it, seeing as the first time I made you tea from my home you sputtered like a nun at a strip club.” Draco was surprised to see him mother muffle a laugh at the raunchy joke, but the amusement was quick to fade. Uncle Severus was the first to speak.
Hadrian definitely took after Ms. Dragma-Erin. Long limbs with carefully tamed hair and a disposition that screamed quiet power. Beside him was a girl with dark red curls and sun kissed skin, there was a spark in her brown eyes that burned with life and exuberance. Quite the opposites it seemed. Though, Hadrian was only wearing a tank top? Severus was quicker than him, frowning at his new godson.
“Oh, no dear, your full name is Harrison James Potter actually…”
“Oh Harry, look at you. You’ve gotten so big, and look at your hair. I was so worried about you when you…” Hadrian didn’t blink. The green eyes that matched her own showed little concern or interest. Just watched silently, judging. He was so still that if his hands didn’t shift within the other little girl’s she’d think her son’s twin dead. It was unnerving to see an almost copy of James act so cold to her.
“Think nothing of it. I’ll get your rooms ready. Draco, let’s leave them to relax for a moment. You’re going to be helping me.” Draco went to protest, but Hadrian only had to glance at him with a single brow raised before Draco was standing up. Abandoning his plate.
“Met him. Didn’t like him. His ego crowds a room. Thought you didn’t want to associate with a bunch of
“Come on. Let’s move quickly, the address is 320 St. Dineral Ave.” Immediately, Draco stepped back and let his mother hold his shoulder and apparate them to the spot just outside the property. The street was dark in the night, but the soft glow of fireflies and the occasional street light made Draco smile again as he hopped up the porch with no hesitation. Keys clinking as he hurriedly opened the door and let his family and the dark lord inside.
Laney cursed, “Damn it, I wasn’t done plotting. Oh well, we only have double potions then we can do and hide out in the common room can’t we? Or grab Suni and use her to ward off any of the Gryffindor.”
Hadrian felt a similar grin tug at his lips to read HAYDEN in bright pink crayon on an attached letter. Handing off their mother’s letter to Laney he decided to read his baby sister’s  letter first.
Hadrian sighed and forced himself out of the covers. Suni hissing in displeasure, but refusing to release him from her fully body cradle. Her eyes did wander however briefly to the kitten dozing on his nightstand. He was watching Marissa for Laney for the night, apparently the tike didn’t like exploding snap and Draco was a bigger fan of chess. Therefore, he was playing babysitting Uncle for the evening. It helped that Suni was now more curious about the kit than predatory, letting the feline explore in her coils without Hadrian fearing for her safety. Suni was well behaved when he said no, so he hadn’t been too worried to begin with.
In Potter Manor.
“In the magical world custody often is gifted to the godparents, do any of the children have them?” Severus cut in.
Hadrian grinned at his Dad, “Now, since we have this all sorted out. How about you and Narcissa help me with wedding plans for after you all win that stupid British war against the old man? We have a lot of work if we’re going to win a war and pull off a marriage in a timely fashion!”
“I’m Hadrian Dragma-Potter. Minstery wouldn’t let me drop my birth name until I can legally drop my heir title.” Draco’s jaw dropped.
“She was fine love.”
Narcissa frowned, “Dear, you didn’t need to do that. That’s your income!”
“Assuming you mean Potter.” Laney flicked a strand of hair over her shoulder as an answer. Snape allowed that to be his answer as he sighed softly. “Regardless, the snake pit has a few more members than expected and we’re short a bed until I can get another one. Any ideas on what you’d like to be done for the night?”
A warning look was all that was needed to get her to back down. Draco snorted.
“Imagine having such an ego that you take a losing case to court under the delusion you win and you muck it up so badly that you’ll be lucky to say a Most Noble House by the end of the PR nightmare that was just unearthed?” Laney gave him a confused look. “I’ll explain why later, it’ll help you understand why Sev is such a big deal to all of us here and why the Potters are going to lynched in the newspapers.”
Nagini hissed again, pleased, and slithered away back into the kitchen. Draco groaned softly.
He’d tried to apologize and beg Hadrian to forgive him.
“You act like our son isn’t just as pussy whipped by his baby sister. I seem to remember him insistently taking some of her midnight fusses, even if we were already awake.” Albus quickly interrupted, this wasn’t going the way he’d planned at all. He was going to have to recollect and regroup. Perhaps a little more forcefully this time.
Hadrian squeezed his eyes shut.
“Couldn’t your godson ever do things by halves? He couldn’t just have a wizard as his mate, he needed a Metamorphagus Parseltongue. Had to go big or go home.” His Lord looked younger without Dumbledore’s forced grotesque glamour on him. Soft and spiked brown hair and warm tanned skin, the only thing unnatural about him was the blood-red eyes. He mocked disapproval, but there was a bemused tilt to his lips. Sipping tea and sitting down at the kitchen table so calmly. Draco almost could pretend there wasn’t a war. That this was just his family meeting his partner.
“Let’s not Laney.”
They won the courts, they won’t get away with this. He just had to be patient. Patient. Patient. Patient.
“Lily. Go.” The redhead shot concerned and longing glances between her husband and her ex-son before she hurried Alex away and escaped down the hall. Leaving Hadrian to face
. Suni would have bit her for her selfishness and the thought was enough to make Hadrian smiled.
Immediately those pink lips split into a grin and Hadrian was pressed into his side. Draco’s face burrowed into the crown of the smaller’s head. Squeezing him tight until he let go. An arm still wound around his beloved’s shoulders as Hadrian’s nimble fingers gently traced the small of his back, unseen to their guests. Draco could feel the blush on his cheeks as he introduced them.
The blood would stain deep and wouldn’t smudge when he had to throw the rug over it again. If he were to keep this a complete secret and only work at night, he would need at least three nights with clear skies and moonlight to finish painting all the runes. Then one night to do the ritual and run.
In the same house, another pair of lovers were mutedly speaking. Tom rubbing his partner’s back soothingly as his partner weathered through the anxiety attack they both had known was coming after the reveal at the bank.
“No one’s going to expect us to be up for a while now, so I think we can spare an hour or two…” Dray looked up at him, flushed and looking so adoring and lovingly at him, with a healthy amount of pure love and lust. Hadrian squeezed his thighs against the hips underneath him, admiring the shudder of his lover and letting their joy bleed deep into the night.
“Protego!” His first visit to Diagon Alley.
-If I’m caught. He will kill me and Lily won’t protect me
Draco huddled between his own parents lost in his own thoughts as his parents murmured above him. Anxiously, Draco fingered the box in his pocket with a mix of relief and fear. His plans were a little ruined, but hopefully for the better. This also meant instead of praying to his partner’s dead parents he was going to have to not get ripped to pieces by two men who just found out they were fathers that had their little boy ripped away from them and obliviated.
“Perfect. Severus, send for the twins?” A flick of his wrist sent a brilliantly white doe sprinting across the study and past the closed door. Sara was biting her lip nervously and twiddling her thumbs until the door gently creaked open and Lucius studied the new occupants of the room carefully.
Hadrian hid a smirk in Draco’s hair when the blond leaned over to look at his notes.
His chest clenched and he felt light headed. Throat constricting painfully as he met his Head of House’s eyes. Those hard eyes softened just a bit as Hadrian’s well hidden panic and struggle. “Ah, your
The other boy seemed to falter when he caught sight of his biological twin, before he waved and made a motion for Hadrian to come closer. A small grin on his face and a light in his eyes that spoke of glee. Hadrian for his part gave a slow blink before turning his back to their other boy, face smooth and blank as glass.
In the end, there was little she could’ve done, besides what she was doing now. Getting her son his twin brother back.
The girl fell silent and glanced at Hadrian, Lucius’ breath caught in his throat. His eyes were nearly glowing, eyes a deep emerald green with a sickly glow that reminded Lucius way to much of his ex-Lord’s favorite curse. “The Potters can crawl into a hole and die for all I care. I don’t want to see any of them.
“Play nice Leandra.” The girl looked at him with utter betrayal, as if he’d just insulted her entire family. It was a rather funny expression to see on a child before she pouted and slouched into her brother, looking up at his through her hair.
“Oh, I’m leaving. And you’re not stopping me.” Alex’s eyes widened, before he began screaming his head off for James. Hadrian only grinned wider. And slapped him. Alex paused with wide eyes.
Laney’s jaw was hanging out of her head as she stared, openly gawking before shutting her mouth and grabbing onto the side of his robes. Easily, he threw an arm over her shoulder. He’d gained a decent amount of height when he joined his real family. When a tap on his shoulder had him breaking his reverence to glance behind him. Breath freezing like ice in his throat.
“I’m Alex, and that’s
Until.
“You didn’t walk in on them Laney.”
The red head glanced around and grinned like a lune when she saw no one, keeping the Cheshire grin locked on. She pointed her own wand at her face and shot herself with a stinging hex. It sent her wand flying and her directly to the ground with a thundering smack.
“Now, you’ve met us, who are your parents? What are they like?” Hadrian hummed, sipping his coffee.
Sirius had been important to the arrest and the trial, damning Albus with a closed confession of what went down that night and nailed the old man with compliancy to child neglect, abuse, and attempted murder. He would die in Azkaban and Severus had taken his place as Headmaster. McGonagall was seen as too entrenched in Albus’ ideas to be suitable. Lily Potter escaped charges, but with the fall of Albus, the ‘Boy Who Lived’ worship fell. Criticism and hate came from all sides to a mother who abandoned her child and ignored abuse. Alex was let off as he was only a child.
Alex and Harry hadn’t gotten along as children, especially when Alex began his tutoring. Harry had always looked at her with such sadness when she had to stop reading to him to work on teaching Alex to read. James hadn’t helped. Not understanding how his sons could be so different from each other, and one so different from him.
Hell, if Hadrian hadn’t met Draco, he might have been ‘Potter’ full time. Slipping into whatever twisted role and mind-melding was forced on him. He’d never known his birth parents, maybe never even known his mate.
Severus was sat on one of the chairs beside Lucius, the two mothers were sat in front of them on the couch in his office. Tea and coffee sitting and ever warm mugs on the coffee table between them as well as a pile of documents in front of the blond lawyer.
“Years with no letters, no phone calls, when Hadrian was adopted your parents didn’t even look up the records and send a letter to us. And you blame me for Hadrian being disinclined to speaking with you? Maybe look at yourself, the sun doesn’t shine out your ass Potter and not everyone likes you.” Alexander spit hate right back as Hadrian felt dizzy, struggling to breath in the face of someone so like his biological father so angry. Flashes of pain and hurt and humiliation coming to the front of his mind.
“Really? Last I checked I’m the one who grew up with him. Oh my god this is a Twitches moment, isn’t it?” Hadrian snorted, a rather undignified sound, but it made Draco smile before listening mesmerized by the low, smooth drawl that left Hadrian’s mouth.
“A bad seed? Jealous monster? Waste of space? Disgrace? Squib? It’s alright, don’t panic; I see that face you’re pulling. I’m joking. I just hear the rumors. But yeah, I’m the ‘lowly’ Harry, twin of the Boy-Who-Lived.” Hadrian smirked. “Shame I’m not so lowly anymore when I’m going to show people just who they’re gossiping about. I’m going to make my family, the
were carved in fine cursive across the latch. It took a considerable amount of self-restraint to not burn the thing where it was. Instead, he decided to make the disgusting thing useful and haul it in front of the door. It was light. Empty. Hadrian held back a snarl. At least they hadn’t gotten their grubby hands on his actual trunk, though this certainly was the exact model his parents had bought him.
An icicle had formed in his chest, sharp, cold, and aching as he held his husband. His magic lashed out dangerously, shattering one of Severus’ empty vials while leaving the impromptu cauldron alone and brewing in the corner of the room. His baby. His son had suffered, and Tom was going to make sure every guilty person was punished thoroughly.
“Harry, it’s breakfast!” The sweet tone Lily used belied the aggressive banging at the door. “James! Calm down, give him a chance to wake up.”
“Nothing you wanna know about Papa. I assure you.” Severus looked appalled but the Lord was ducking behind his husband where Draco could hear him snorting with quiet laughter, shoulder’s shaking as he tried to cover it with a cough. Severus glared at him.
The train rumbled in the station holding, his head was lulled onto the window watching the crowds while his sister was happily spinning a quarter between her knuckles. He could tell she was more nervous than she let on as she held his hand with her free hand tightly. But he didn’t comment on it. This was going to be the longest they’d separated from their parents and baby sister since they’d become a family and Hadrian would be lying if the anxiety for his baby sister Annabee wasn’t a pit in his stomach. He was glad that Laney was at least here with him.
Hadrian froze.
Hell no.
Hogwarts wouldn’t be as bad as he feared it to be it seemed.
“The Potters are friends with the Weasley’s. A family who are widely considered blood traitors with no inheritance to speak of and one average income from the father. With
“Sounds about right! It’s a pleasure to meet you Mr. Malfoy.”
“Blaise is nice.”
Draco gave a large grin. “That’s my godfather Severus Snape. He’s the head of our house actually so you’ll get to meet him in just a minute when he joins us in the Slytherin common room. He can be a bit grumpy, but he’s cool once you get to know him. I think you’ll like him.”
Sara refocused her attention onto Lily, “What does your son have, an owl?”
They were saved from further small talk as the door opened again behind them and three women walked in. One holding a squirming and familiar bundle of dark black waves. Hadrian’s heart melted as he immediately abandoned his twin who just rolled her eyes as he collected his baby sister from his mother and returned to her without a word. His entire face was now open, eyes soft and adoring as the girl, maybe five grinned in absolute delight.
“You have the adoption papers?” Sara handed over her file of copies. “Perfect, and what can you tell me about your professions?”
stood above them all, and easy smile and strong lean arms. Laney batted her eyes back and forth between the two of them.
“You are? You are! Oh, my baby!” She cooed, misty eyes as she slapped her husband’s chest excitedly. “Lucius, Lucius! They’re mates! I knew my Veela heritage would bless my son like it did my grandmother.”
Draco looked satisfied and his companions were too busy with treats from their bags to care for the conversation. “So, not twins because your adopted with different birth parents. How close in age are you to be the same year?” Laney giggled as Hadrian slumped onto her head, his boney chin digging into her crown.
“Alexander Potter!” The hall and its boisterous energy hushed as Alex sauntered onto the stage. Evidently, he was quite used to the spot light as he didn’t even bat an eye to the feeling of everyone’s attention on him. A small glance showed many faces, all curious, a couple scornful and glaring. He’d ask Draco who the man with long dark hair at the head table was later. He looked positively murderous with that sneer.
It was a rather good day.
Bloodline.
“My name’s Hadrian Dragma.” Lily’s smile died.
James was in a room, barren of many books and filled with Quidditch memorabilia bent over in conversation with an old man with white hair. Albus. Sirius pressed himself further into the wall and held his breath. James shoulder’s shook, revealing his agitation in his nightrobes.
Even if he was absolutely destroying Alexander Potter’s sanity.
Laney and Annabee giggled as Mama swooned under one of Mother’s arms. Leaning her body against her wife’s side. “You’re such a charmer Er-bear. Keep this up and maybe I’ll extend my break to go a little while longer when we get home…”
“Now, I hate to say this. However in the event of your untimely death do you know where your children would go?” Sara patted her wife’s knee.
Mama and Mother were sitting on the edge of the outdoor pool. Nuzzling each other lovingly as their feet dipped underneath the water’s surface. Mama hadn’t let him out of her sight for weeks after his escape, watching like a hawk from his bed side. Reading while he slept and making sure he was comfortable as he weathered the healing of his injuries and bouncing back from tearing himself out of the Potter Family Magic. Coddling him perhaps a bit too much out of love. Mother was just as overprotective if not more so. Hadrian had woken up in the middle of the night more than once to Mother slumped over in front of the door. One foot on it so if it opened she’d wake up. Handgun held tightly in her grasp.
Settling down. Hadrian stripped to just his thin button up and his slacks. It was better to do it naked, but if he needed a quick escape he’d need clothes so he didn’t streak through Potter Manor. (Though the idea of escaping James while buck ass nude did inspire a delirious sort of hysterical amusement). These were the lightest clothes here. Plus, he couldn’t bring himself to put on the hand-me-downs in the closet. He’d rather feel disgusting physically than subject himself the mental torture the past would conjure up in his mind. The circle was blood, but just in case, he held his hands up and keep his weeping injury skyward and began to mutter, feeling the circle closing and encasing him. Unable to move until it was finished.
She might hate him for a while, but she would come around.
The image of a happy baby with big green eyes. Not seeing him anymore as James pushed and pushed Alex at him. The last time he’d seen his godson was the image of Hadrian looking out from the window. Eyes obscured by the window panes, hair messy long waves and laying his head down on the windowsill. Next thing Sirius knew he was gone.
“Yes dear?”
“Perhaps I’ll talk to Uncle Sev after classes today, we can’t spend the rest of first year hiding in various alcoves and being sandwiched by Vince and Greg, as much as your protection is appreciated.” The boys grunted in agreement as Laney patted their arms. Her wavy auburn hair fanning out behind her.
Hadrian dropped the shell shocked boy and shot to his feet just as James stopped at the corner. Seeing Alexander bleeding on the ground and Hadrian bleeding while standing over him, however Hadrian was still in an adrenaline rush and not just waking up. So he grabbed a vase from the table and hurled it right at James’ face before taking off.
“True enough.”
The brunet was dragged by his ear by an irate and infuriated potions professor as Draco hurried over to his sister. Holding her wand which no one bothered to check, the sparkle in her eyes was full force. Yes, a beautiful job well done. Laney put her thumbs up for him to see from the library and whooped with glee when Greg piggy backed her to the infirmary. A month and a half until the court day left.
“Now that we’re all awake, there is something I would like to talk to you about. I was brewing last night and I brewed a purging potion for you, this is all your choice however Hadrian. Only take it if you want to.” Severus placed the bottle onto the counter and the raven studied it. The color was a nearly clear blue and it smelled like a flower field, it wouldn’t taste nearly as pleasant however he knew.
“Can I pet Suni?” Hadrian gave him a gentle smile and sat still as Draco hopped on the bed with him and reached out. Hand hovering in front of the large snake patiently letting her scent him before going to gently run his hand down her long body. “She’s gorgeous.”
Vince looked up, “We have to go, we have potions.”
“HADRIAN!” The boy blinked tiredly and jumped when arms looked around him like a vice. Nearly struggling until the scent of brown sugar assaulted him like a brick to the face. Tears hot and burning welled up in his eyes as he desperately wrapped his own arms around her. Feeling her hands clawing nearly painfully at the back of his head and his back.
Just… a day at a time.
Draco grinned and Hadrian grinned back, before Severus cleared his throat.
parents too?” Dumbledore’s smile became strained, the twinkle in his eye dimming.
One time she read to him from outside the door, put treacle tart on a plate and slid it through the locked door. Hadrian liked blondies,
Hadrian blinked as Draco tapped his cheek. “Eyes up. You look sharp. Your mothers are the kindest people to exist that I’m not even sure their real. Severus is on our side and respected as a no-nonsense man who’s rescued countless Slytherin’s from abusive home. Laney’s a good holy terror and attached to you like an STD. And my father’s the best lawyer that exists in this country and everything is going to be alright. Don’t you trust me?”
“It’s common knowledge how much the Potter’s value family and their children. The Potter’s quite obviously love their son, and they love Harry just as much. Any actions made were regrettable, but it was all to protect what they thought was a squib sibling from dark wizards that targeted the family. If you believe in the love of family, you’ll return young Harry to his parent’s loving arms and let him learn to regain his place in his rightful family.” As Albus sat down, Lucius smoothly got to his feet. Hair neatly pulled back.
Dumbledore, motioned to two chairs in front of him. “Sit, Mrs. Dragma and Mrs. Anderson will be here as soon as Minerva has gotten them both. Lemon drop anyone?” Alex grabbed one happily, but hesitated as the two students opposite of him said nothing. Unanimously staying silent and united. Alex swallowed the bitter feeling in the back of his throat.
-Albus sycophants in Wizengamot will slow proceedings or dismiss charges
“I think it’s stupid they don’t let you drop your last name if you don’t want it. Did you see the way Potter and the Weasels were looking at you like you were their next victim? It was like indoctrination, it was barbaric.” The girl, Laney Dragma from what he remembered scowled.
“Like the Bernie Botts! They’re so disgusting I love them! But government? No clue.”
They were in Charms when he found out. Laney was maniacally giggling and having a bit to much fun learning the fire charm, Vince and Greg dutifully pulling books out of the radius as she experimented happily. Draco was watching with no little amount of awe and a healthy dose of fear when Hadrian felt a tap on his shoulder.
Screaming, Hadrian grabbed onto his core with both hands and felt when the accio snapped off of him and something else tore at him. It felt like his atoms were being tore apart and shoved through a small tube before they were forcefully packed back into his body. Weightless, for a moment. Then he crashed back to the ground.
This wasn’t home.
Sighing, Hadrian grabbed his wool coat and slung it on as he trotted obediently down the stairs to the floo. Hauling Annabee up onto his hip and good naturedly allowed Draco to wrap his scarf around his neck like a mother hen (or an overprotective house wife). Mama was at the tail end as Mother and Lucius led the way.
Lily leaned closer in, “Oh, I thought owls went to the owlery in Hogwarts, not the dorms?”
“We should get our robes on. We’re going to be at the school soon.” The train ride was supposed to be hours, but it had only felt like minutes to Hadrian’s surprise and delight. Their robes swished with their steps in the dying evening light as the train slowed to a stop and all the first years were dragged along by a very tall man into river boats. Hadrian felt a dim light of anxiety in his chest as he glanced back at the train. Laney felt the discomfort and granted a small mercy.
“I think I graduated, no one came to pick me up this year like the last few years. It’s been relieving.”
Draco wishes the summer had stayed forever. His body ached from running, his mother and father were on either side of him. Their lord and his Uncle Severus were running close behind, shouting defensive spells and shields until they were able to get out of the Hogwarts wards to apparate with a loud crack.
If Alex really wanted to run around lying, Hadrian would enjoy
“What are you doing?!” Hadrian’s grin was manic on top of him and it was beginning to scare the ‘other’ Potter. “Aren’t you supposed to be grounded in your room?”
“Making sure I’m not horrifying our new godfather, that my grades are fine. Oh, and that that little pleb isn’t bothering you too much.
All of them were going to burn and he would watch and
The next morning when Severus stumbled out of their bedroom, he was caught by Draco before he could even ask their host for the location of the nearest coffee shop. He glared at his godson grumpily who just rolled his eyes.
A soft touch on his shoulder jolted him out of his spiral and he looked into Draco’s silver eyes. Concern was evident in his eyes, but Hadrian just gently shrugged it off. Ignoring his food to drape his head onto the blonde’s shoulder. Ignoring everyone else and letting the idle chatter of the other Slytherins wash over him.
“Children.” All three of her kids stilled and looked at her immediately, Snape was impressed. He wished his snakes were as easily to wrestle into submission. Lily just glared jealously at the ease the woman showed in commanding her daughters and Lily’s son when she herself struggled to wrangle Alex and her husband under control on a daily basis. “No fighting. Why don’t you wait outside? I’m sure Annabee wants to tell you both all about her first day of kindergarten.”
“No. no.nononono.” Hadrian froze beside him, obviously hearing the screaming coming from the office. Laney was gripping at his robes anxiously, even Draco looked nervous though he hid it quite well. Pressing Hadrian behind himself and throwing on his pureblood mask. Huddled into him like scared children. Snape paused.
No matter how mature or brave they were, they were still kids. He was the adult here.
James snarled and snapped at him viciously. Like a wild dog on a leash.
With that, James grabbed the dishes and disappeared into the kitchen whistling a soft tune as he left.
Apparently, Laney had not stolen a sink. But she had gotten away with taking a faucet by Halloween. Uncaught by everyone except the Weasley twins, who were in the midst of stealing a toilet seat.
“Long day.” Smiling, Hadrian didn’t look up from where he was braiding his hair for bed. It was already near three in the morning and they were all exhausted. Nagini was slumped, sleeping blissfully on the charmed heated blanket she’d insisted having on one of their nightstands after she realized Hadrian was her ‘hatchling’. It seemed she felt as if she’d failed him and Tom, now determined not to fail once more. Draco stood behind him, they’re eyes meeting in the mirror, he didn’t even blink at the blonde’s nervousness. He knew his nerves were shot, but the… abuse he’d survived allowed him to outwardly brush most things off for later.
Finally, he grit his teeth and
-I might get to hex James/Alex
His heart
She’d left them alone to use the bathroom. She thought it’d be safe, they had just won the court case and it was usually a busy space at the ministry. Laney didn’t think anything would happen in five minutes. Yet, when she’d returned Annabee was screeching on the ground, clutching the Slytherin scarf Draco had wrapped around Hadrian’s neck and bleeding from a cut on her forehead. Her twin nowhere in sight.
The feast was brilliant, even if Hadrian had to glare at Laney to keep her in line with her dietary restrictions. They had a merry time all the way until they were being called to be escorted to their dorms in the dungeon. Hadrian gently tugged on Draco’s arm, gaining the other boy’s attention easily. The brunet jerked a head towards the long head table.
Hadrian giggled and nearly startled the whole table as he hissed back.
“That’s… interesting.” Hadrian glared at the paper.
His husband shook his head slowly, watching carefully as Severus pulled thin and callused fingers against his pulse point. “It’s the artery that leads to the brain, a laceration the scroll described would have killed him in minutes. That’s why he was magically exhausted that year, his magic was the only thing that kept him alive. We could have lost our son Tom! And we would have no idea what we’d lost.”
Odd, but boys were reckless, and if he were Harry Potter… Harry Potter. Why hadn’t Hadrian recognized them in his home? Severus had been his professor for years, Voldemort had even seen the boy during Albus’ set up in the Tri-Wizard Tournament. Harry Potter. Oh god, Tom had almost killed his baby. That’s why Harry had lived. The Boy-Who-Lived. Magic was more than intent, it would know if he were unsound. Even under compulsion upon compulsion and induced madness, his magic knew he’d never hurt his blood. His magic had probably recognized Hadrian and had backfired to prevent him from killing his son. Thank Merlin.
Worst case scenario. He’s caught, hides the broken wand and uses it to slit his wrists.
A shrug, “Easier to ask for forgiveness than permission. Suni’s been his longer than Hogwarts has.”
Hadrian more than kinda loved him.
“There will be time for pleasantries later, so let us get down to business. Is there anything the Potters might use against you?” Erin curled a hand behind her ear, clearing her face of any stray strands, Sara was relaxed underneath her wife’s arm.
“No one thinks of the weird shit that happens, only the cool things.”
Hadrian looked to him, almost as misty-eyed as his uncle as his voice cracked. “I had living parents, and they sent me to live with
Draco laughed, though he had no clue what his love was saying. His lord was immediately sitting up and leaning in excitedly.
As I've stated before, questions, ideas, comments welcome down below! We're nearing the end folks!
Laney’s fist in his face certainly halted that in its tracks.
“Hello Harry, how’d you sleep?” He didn’t speak. Only glaring at her. His chest was wound like a spring. Lungs held in a dizzying vice grip that left him light headed and impossible to speak clearly. “Are you ready for breakfast?”
Rage was still burning like a lovingly stoked fire in his chest, growing hotter with each minute. But something was also soothed. Godson. He had two, technically three, you didn’t get Hadrian without Laney tagging along. That desperate part of him that tracked everything he owned calmed a bit, giddily counting again and again. Three. Three. Three. He had more than he’d started with.
Severus gave a deep sigh. It would be a long year if this was anything to go by.
“Cool, what do you- holy Merlin.” Draco interrupted himself, prompting Hadrian and his sister to look behind themselves. Both froze and looked awestruck.
Immediately, the door was opened and Potter was shoved inside. The rest wandered inside and listened to Snape’s lecture in a contemplative silence. Watching as he flayed Potter alive with a small hint of amusement. The only thing reaching Hadrian was a note passed from Draco on his left to Laney on his right.
‘No, he wasn’t. Laney was a little bit. She was just neurotic and didn’t care about other people’s opinions of her though.’
Snape rolled his eyes, “Hadrian’s familiar.”
“It seems the Headmaster would like a word with Hadrian today after breakfast. However, he said nothing about informing you as his sibling. We will endeavor there after you two and I eat.” Laney frowned.
“Annabee is just plain smitten with her brother, he could say the sky was green and she’d adamantly defend him against anyone who tried to say it was blue.”
Hadrian’s went up the stairs with Draco hot on his heels, meeting the blonde’s parents and Uncles(?) had been nice. Even if it was a little tense and worried. He was glad that he finally got to meet them, seeing as Draco had already met his mentor a few times now. Hadrian grabbed his lover and shoved him into one of the guestrooms, Draco gaped at the fully clean and furnished room.
“This, will it purge out the blood adoption? How much change should I expect then?” Tom, Dad, looked him up and down curiously, Papa was more matter of fact as he tapped the vial in Hadrian’s hands.
“Hadrian?” The brunet blinked, looking to his side and stepping back when he saw Draco on one knee. A box in his hands being wrung with the blonde’s jittery hands. Hadrian covered his mouth with his hands. “I’ve known you for so many years and loved you through all of them. The little arguments, the sass, the snark, the sweet, the nights in the doghouse. When I woke up on my sixteenth birthday at Hogwarts, your name on my lips and your love on my mind, I wasn’t even surprised. I knew you’d be the one I would spend my entirety with. For life and beyond death. I want to love you for all of it. For the rest of our lives. Hadrian Dragmire, now Hadrian Thomas Prince, will you marry me?”
Hadrian surveyed the room with a quick glance and sharp eyes. Four beds, a large bathroom. Cool with dark elegance, but no windows, no escape. It both soothed him and made him crawl up the wall. Laney’s nails dug into the back of his neck and he blinked back to reality, memories of cupboard neatly shoved back into a different corner of his mind for now. Draco looked around as well, a small frown on his lips.
Holding her closer to his chest, he smiled. Eyes burning, though no tears leaked out. His vision was so bad enough it wouldn’t have mattered too much anyway. Something was hot in his chest, aching and blistering, worse than any broken rib he had, but it was addictive and sweet.
Draco assessed the situation.
He could see why they wanted to remember, however. All the little moments had been taken from them. His birth, maybe even his first word, the memory of whoever attacked them and took their little boy away. Made them unable to get him back until all these years had passed.
The tears fell silently down his partner’s tan cheeks as they always have. Draco took a step back to give his partner some privacy as his Uncle, Hadrian’s
parents wouldn’t care as long as he tried his best and worked hard. It was a deep hidden fear he never realized still lingered in his chest until it released. Leaving only a gasp of fresh air in his lungs. It left him high and joyful as his smile spread into a grin.
Harry had even looked at
“I love her.”
“What do you want?” Snape rolled over the thoughts in his head. Seems the mildly terrifying anger was on both sides. Good to know. Lily looked cowed however, holding a sulking Potter clone in her arms tight as James frowned deeply.
-Potter Manor is a Manor with strong wards, not easy to search
Pros- Legal
, so we joke that we’re pseudo-twins. Both of us just turned eleven last month.” Draco nodded thoughtfully.
“Let’s refrain from telling that story if it comes to trial.”
“I still think I could punch him.” Hadrian pinched his sister’s arm. She simply ignored his silent warning and continued plotting with Draco and his vassals. The raven sighed softly and continued twisting his ponytail between his fingers, food untouched on his plate. His chest was too tight and knotted to even think about food right now, and it gave him better focus to swipe at Laney each time she reached for something with dairy in it.
“Hadrian is much scarier than you, if Potter weren’t so obsessed with him we could probably get Hadrian to cow him into submission with a glare.”
One bed. Which is what he was laying on. With a dresser and a desk it looked like. The window was shut and lined with burgundy drapes (they only had blinds at home, and there was no water. Definitely not the dorms). The whole room was ivory with dark wood, gold accents, and warm red fabrics.
“C’mon, let’s’ go back down. You promised desert.” Hadrian laughed and they went downstairs and host their guests. Draco was pleased with their desert and for a small while, the war didn’t weigh so heavily on the families.
“Their birthdays are eight days apart and Laney declared that that made them pseudo-twins. Hadrian never argues or disagrees with anything really, so he just accepted it and so did we. It helps that when we throw joint parties they seem more pleased then jealous at sharing a birthday. Annabee was very little when we adopted Hadrian so she’d never known anything different I guess.” Sara swatted her wife.
. Tutoring in most subjects was done by year,
“Severus! You could have been so adorable! Look at those cheeks! I keep telling you two, once the wars over you should have a child. Mix your devastating good looks and you’d have a drop dead gorgeous son or daughter.” Lucius smiled at his wife’s teasing, but the adults quickly went quiet as both of the men in question stopped smiling. Only Severus managed a softening in his gaze.
All he had was a snapped wand with no core, and more bruises than he knew what to do with. Luckily, Hadrian had a good memory or his late night sneaking into the library would be for nothing. Drawing a ritual circle was easier if you had a picture, but he would make do, they either worked or they didn’t. Even so, disowning yourself from an old family bloodline was complex and complicated work-
Even his father looked up with surprise before a pleased smile stretched across his face. His Lord and his Uncle stayed quiet as Lucius leaned over to shake Hadrian’s hand. Who looked absolutely delighted at the gesture. Shaking the older’s hand happily.
“Do you think Sirius would help us as Lord Black? He loved Harry, he’d be so happy to see him again. Perhaps he’d even come to see Alex again, he misses Padfoot and Moony quite a lot. It’d be nice to have us all home together again, like old times.” James frowned.
It felt like coming home, looking into his own eyes. How they should’ve looked from the start.
“I don’t like what you’re insinuating. My children aren’t spoiled with material goods, I want them to learn hard work and humility pays off.” Her fingers flicked, and like soldiers, Laney and Hadrian stood up. The little one smooshed between the pseudo-twins to stand in front of their Mother as their Mama watched intensely, the blonde pulled them all close against her hips. Snape watched Lily’s face blossom red with rage as her eyes glared venomously and protectively. “Money and possessions mean nothing when you’re rich in love.”
“Anything else we should know about sweetheart?” Hadrian took a sip of his coffee, before letting a hand wander down to slip into Draco’s back pocket cheekily. Giving his parent’s a sly wink while Draco simultaneously wanted to grin like a loon and crawl into a hole and die before his fiancé’s parents murdered him and hid the body.
Draco’s shock spread into a deep grin. “There’s some Slytherin ambition, you had me worried for a second Dragma. I knew that goody-goody light family had to have some closed doors nonsense.”
This would be a nightmare without her. All the people. The fact that for the first time in
It was show time and he was ready.
Irregardless of the name loss, accio was an intent spell. And Hadrian could feel it fighting him. Trying to pull him towards James open hand. No! Nononononononono. He was so close. HE WAS TOO FUCKING CLOSE!
.” Sara smirked. “Besides, I wonder who would also win this fight if it’s all about money. I own my own business and Erin here is extremely affluential in an international military task-force. You are the equivalent of a stay at home wife and a police officer. Noble, but not very lucrative, all your money was made by your ancestors. We’re self-sufficient and though we have a lower net-worth than you, we didn’t see fit to
The courtroom was already packed with the Lords and Ladies as they shuffled their way to the defendants area. Hadrian bit the inside of his cheek, glancing either way, paling a bit when he caught sight of the Headmaster.
Lucius shooed Severus and the women out of the door swiftly after that and made his own greetings to the first-year students. “I’m Lucius, Draco’s father, and your mothers’ new lawyer. Do you two know why you’re here?”
And he was right. Alex glowered at him, but when he tried to get him into detention he got points removed for picking on his brother again. After all, it was well known that Alex tormented him and his sister. And it was ‘well known’ that Hadrian didn’t retaliate unless pushed and often did do in quiet harmless ways.
“For the goddesses.” Hadrian took the potion like a shot, letting it burn down his throat without really tasting it. He shuddered as he felt it crawl through him, it stung. His fathers were quick to sit him down, Dad was at his back supporting him, while Papa flitted around checking his temperature and smoothing his bangs over. Hadrian curled into his Dad’s arms, it felt so weird, like his skin was vibrating out of his body, but he still held on. It would be over soon, just like his Papa kept whispering into his hair.
“Mama, it was one sink!” Laney didn’t look a bit remorseful
“Ask your son, his best friend’s father is the best lawyer in wizarding Britain. However, I am rather close with Malfoy senior as well. I’d be happy to give him your address and arrange a meeting if need be.”
Hadrian shrieked, his back arching to an extreme angle. There was no fight in him left when James manhandled him and yanked his wand out of his wrist holster. Snapping it in half right in front of the younger boy’s eyes. Hadrian felt like his rib cage had cracked. Watching his wand fall to pieces before him. It hurt more than any beating James could dole out.
“Don’t worry about that Lily-flower. Just spruce up Harry’s new room. We’ll be teaching him what it means to be a Potter whether he likes it or not. All children have a rebellious phase after all. Harry can’t be led astray by the dark. Alex needs to defeat the Voldemort and having Harry on our side is paramount according to Albus. Alex adores Harry already, so it will be wrestling Harry into not being so difficult and teaching him to that family comes first.”
“You wouldn’t know how to unburn letters would you Fawkes?” A sad trill.
“Wait here alright?” Hadrian nodded easily, Annabee waved from his arm’s happily and Laney gave them a grin. There was a large skip in her step as she practically danced to the bathroom, Hadrian chuckling and watching her antics as Lords and Ladies alike exited the hall leaving it mostly empty as he waited.
James Potter would pay.
Green eyes shot open, blue skies were replaced with the smooth ivory ceiling of their dorm room. The covers were heavier than normal on his, which made sense when he felt a snoot nudging at his jaw from under the duvet. Hadrian let a hand reach up to massage Suni’s head, eyes still locked onto the seeing. Mind running and not really comprehending that real life existed for a moment.
. This was the first step into learning and growing into his magic, this is where all his possibilities would blossom and grow.
But not bad enough.
The box fell open, revealing the shimmering platinum band with small diamond crusting and the ruby that was traditional for Dician weddings. It was in that second, Hadrian knew he’d been blessed. This caring, sweet man that was looking at him like he was the reason the world turned. Hadrian grinned.
Dumbledore couldn’t participate in the proceedings in as a judge. It seemed he was working to be the Potter’s legal counsel, irregardless he still held a lot of personal and political sway as a witness. Hadrian’s skin crawled as he felt those blue eyes fixate on the side of his face. Alex’s gaze had less power than this one. Every time Alex’s eyes threatened to have him get a flashback to James, the memory of Snape dragging his ass like a misbehaving toddler dispersed the memories. Albus’ eyes were more dangerous. They made him feel like it was his fault, that he deserved everything he suffered.
“I didn’t know Parseltongue was a kink.” Hadrian smiled sunnily at him.
“She likes skin contact. It was an experience to wake up the first time with a boa slithering up my pants and into my shirt whining that she was cold.”
Sara waved her off, “We didn’t know owls were like magic post. We got Laney a kitten for her birthday and a Hogwarts send off. But Hadrian got Suni his ball python for his… oh, was it his ninth birthday?” Erin played with her wife’s fingers idly.
Well, his parents had money to give him a nice funeral.
Pros-Quick
“Flipendo!” His first accidental magic.
It almost looked like Alex’s room, or what little he saw of it that one time he snuck out of the attic.
He could hear James thundering footsteps getting closer as the front door flung itself open and Hadrian tore himself out of the wards. Momentarily stunning James as it shouldn’t have been possible with his Head of House Order. Shouldn’t have been possible if Hadrian were still a Potter.
Eleven and performing a ritual, especially this ritual. Hadrian wondered if he was breaking some sort of record as he bled and darkened a couple of the symbols. It would be difficult to scrub off the blood if it didn’t work and he’d be set back another week at least if he needed to sneak into the library and see what he’d gotten wrong.
“We share a room at home so a night with my brother isn’t a punishment. I call the right side! Is it okay for me to room with my brother for a night?” Snape surveyed them critically.
But safe.
“Professor, do you know why we’re being called into the office?” Laney’s pout was at full force while still being respectful to their Head of House. Hadrian glanced back at Snape himself, the man stayed blank but did answer them in a bland voice.
“She will be when I sic Marissa and Suni on her.”
He threw it into a roll and immediately his raven was off.
Hadrian cocked his head. “I don’t believe I know what that is, but it sounds like a decent idea. I called my mentor last night and took this week off in case you all needed me. Let’s say I had a feeling when you called me last night. So, my schedule is free.”
He was supposed to be brought back home when he went to Hogwarts. Hogwarts was the safest place on earth, and keeping two preteens safe when they could listen and understand the things at stake as easier than trying to keep two children safe. James hadn’t been so optimistic. He just didn’t understand. Alex was his son. Harry was
“Ah, the anxiety disorder? Not a problem, of course his sister may join.” Sara relaxed again and Severus hid a smile, still sitting beside Lucius. “I hope they won’t try to use it against you or him, however mental health studies are slightly archaic in the Wizarding World. So I hope Potter won’t be depraved enough to dig, if push comes to shove however would Hadrian be comfortable to simply be assessed by a Mind Healer? A muggleborn named Ted Tonks, he would serve as an expert testimony to help keep Hadrian out of Potter’s hands. Only if they pursue legal action that is.” Sara nodded.
Where Alex giggled madly and wrecked havoc on his broom, Harry had always looked up with those carbon copy eyes and happily sat in her lap. Listening to music or letting her read aloud to him from her charms book.
The letters were large and done with a magenta marker, but it was perfect to Hadrian; at the bottom of the paper was a child’s drawing of two stick figures and a yellow squiggle, labeled with their names. Hadrian smiled fondly and pulled out his own parchment as his friends minded their own posts and Laney was reading their other letter.
Hadrian was Harry. Who was his Uncles’ child. Who was his mate.
Have I mentioning how frustrating and amusing it is to have a seven year old throw back you words at you. Exactly as you said them with the date and time you said them? It’s awful and funny!” Sara sighed. “I consider you kind of like a godfather anyway, I don’t really know what those are supposed to be. Not magical or religious here. But any legal godfather did nothing for my son, yet here you are… protecting him. Good enough for me.”
The snake huffed and stayed put, tongue flicking affectionately against Hadrian’s cheek.
He definitely saw where the Slytherin came from now.
“What’s your middle name. Both of you.” Hadrian looked vaguely curious and Leandra looked startled. Draco just smirked.
The dark-haired man gave a swift nod. He knew what it was like to worry, even if it might be nothing. Following gut feelings were very important and it wasn’t like it was difficult to check as long as the boy consented. “Have you talked to him about this?”
If Hadrian had shorter, lighter hair, the lord and he might look similar Draco mused. But that’s assumed Hadrian would ever wear his hair short voluntarily. Draco had asked once if Hadrian would even morph his hair to be shorter than his shoulders; but the venomous reply that he was forced into one gender and one short hair-cut for nine months at school was enough even if he didn’t remember anything of school once he came home.
“Oh, you know.” It was dead. Tom had never heard the boy anything but buoyant and cheery. Always first with a welcoming embrace and a wide grin stretched across his tan cheeks and the bright green eyes. Caused by Tom’s curse, (how could he have disfigured his child.  sparkling with warmth and light. Severus’ thumb grazed their child’s neck again.
, unless you want to see me differently?” The very air around him blurred as his dark hair lightened to a smoother honey brown, eyes turning blood red and looking to his lord with a smug smile. His hair was pin straight but still swept down to just above the small of his back.
“My parents bought us a house near base as a wedding gift. I make a decent income from my business, but Erin makes quite a bit of money from her job. 60,000 a year roughly, more if there is an attack and she’s deployed to get it under control. So our bills are rather low, her sec is international, so her superiors give us some money for housing as well. We have a decent savings and investments in both Gringotts and the muggle world. I also bought stock in Microsoft when it was founded in 1975,” Sara winked. “Sufficient to say in a few more years my net worth is going up.”
Alex was nearly vibrating in excitement. When Harry had gone missing, he’d hounded for stories and pictures from his mother when his father failed to procure his brother back or give any descriptions. He was a little annoyed that he got ignored so easily, but maybe Harry was just shy. His mother had always said Harry was quieter than he ever had been. Soon enough Harry would be in Gryffindor with him and Ron though! Then he could room with his twin and they could catch up. Alex could just picture the stories they could tell each other deep into the night, Harry could apologize for leaving him.
“You’re too little too late, go away Mrs. Potter.”
“Hadrian! Oh my baby, my baby, my baby.” The raven sighed, hands digging into his Mama’s back. It wasn’t a dream this time. He was here, he made it. Nuzzling into her shoulder, he let out a hysterical sobbing laugh. He used his arms to haul himself when his legs proved useless, trying to get closer to where he felt safe. Squirm closer into his Mama’s safe arms.
It was like being in a house of over emotional toddlers. One didn’t understand basic human decency, one wanted everything to go her way, and one liked to hit. Hadrian was grateful Annabee’s tantrums were far and free between and that her biting phase was extremely short lived when he played the big brother card and told her how disappointed he was. Her little sobs had been heartbreaking when she’d realized how upset hitting made him, but she’d never bitten another kid at the farmer’s market again and Hadrian had showered her in kisses and cuddles after timeout.
His mind wandered and pulled up his first memory with his little sister’s grey eyes.
“I don’t know Lily. And I’m not going to chance it until Harry is in our family firmly and we’ve won both the court case and gotten the boys to settle their differences. I won’t risk Harry manipulating Sirius into thinking he needs to get away from us or using Sirius against us. His word in court could be the difference between a loss and winning and Harry is being extremely bitter towards us right now, who knows what he’d tell Sirius to get him to let him stay with those women.”
Alex was left gaping, his wand tightly grasped in his hand
“I can’t believe your whole family’s been Slytherins! That’s pretty cool, if either of our moms went to Hogwarts I probably would want to follow their footsteps too I guess. Is it rare for families to stick to the same houses?” Hadrian politely pressed himself into the conversation as he tuned back in, Draco looked affronted for half a second that someone was interrupting his discussion until he realized who it was. Hadrian idly contemplated the theory that curiosity usually beats annoyance.
Happy thoughts. Focus.
“I’ll stick to the basics because you’re more familiar with Dicai Wizarding Traditions, but in the British World. Which, do you remember any of that from school?” Hadrian sighed.
Immediately, it felt like shackles had dragged him down. Holding him in a vice grip and leaving Hadrian no choice but to collapse to the floor and wheeze. “Crucio! Give me your wand!”
Crammed under a bed, with hot tears beginning to stream down his cheeks. He never wanted his mother more than that moment now.
“Mama, it’s expensive. But, I’m going to need so much more therapy.” Mama laughed with him loud and unhinged, gulping in breaths between laughs and sobs with him and rocking him in her arms and her lap. Kissing every strand of hair on his head and every piece of exposed flesh. Careful not to touch his profusely bleeding leg.
held the boy tight. He looked at his own father and got a nod from him. Immediately Draco set off to fetch his mother and their lord.
They were right, it was still him. His skin was still tanned, but now it seemed more natural and less like it was just Hadrian staying in the sunny restaurant all day. His hair had changed from a dark brown to a glossy black, the only flecks of color was the slight sheen of brown when the light hit his hair just right. His eyes were the most different part, they went from that vibrant green to a dark and endless blue like an ocean.
James gave him a dark look, hauling up the trunk stuffed with all the parchment, quills and ink in the room. Leaving no books or utensils behind. “Perhaps if you have time to do nothing but reflect. You’ll realize how good you have it by even being welcomed back into this house.”
He didn’t know what the Carotid Artery was, but it seemed important and a turning point as belt lashings and iron burns turned into minor burns and ice skating accidents. Tom briefly remembered Draco mentioning that he’d met Hadrian rollerblading (he spoke as if it were an insult that Hadrian had crashed into him, but he always recounted the tale with the smallest of smiles) and saying he missed the ice. Severus himself mentioned ice skating when he’d peeked into the boy’s mind and saw the snowy forest ice rink in the boy’s mind. Odd for someone of a desert culture, but nothing about Hadrian was completely normal, was it?
It went on and on, Tom felt dizzy and sick as he kept reading and the pages kept scrolling on, giving basics before going into graphic detail of every injury. Burns, hit with frying pans, hit with a belt, fists, glass, starved. Tom held onto his son and husband tighter, but blocked their view of the paper as he read on.
She wanted her baby back. The one who had such a sweet smile and was so patient and good. Who kept her company while she read her charms work, or brewed potions, or even just cooked. Not the one who glared at her and regarded them with such fear and
Instantly, she knew he was gone or injured. Annabee would never be alone and crying like that if he were able to get to her. Most of her childhood was lazing on the couch or a park bench as Hadrian kissed Annabee’s boo boos or soothed her to sleep or fed her a bottle. Hadrian never let Annabee cry for longer than a minute if it wasn’t a temper tantrum or misbehaving. And no injury, especially a bleeding one, went unaddressed for longer than it took for her raven haired brother to get his hands on the toddler.
was proud.”
If the boy stuck with them he’d get used to the hurricane that was Laney Dragma.
“Have Uncle Sev try Legilimency on you sometime. The fact you blackout entire school years isn’t normal. Anyway, there’s a war going on. Between Dark and Light, and everyone thinks the Light side is all sunshine, roses, and goodness. But, the dark side is being painted in a demonized light. Tom, our lord, was dragged into this war by the leader of the light side who manipulated him and then tried to kill him after killing a few very well-known wizards under Tom’s name. Now our lord was forced back into the light, people know he still lives and the war has been started all over again and we’re going to die unless we can clear the names of dark witches and wizards before they kill us all.” Hadrian frowned in thought, eyebrows scrunched up.
It felt like chains had cracked and slipped off his shoulders. Leaving him raw and sore where the shackles had bit into him, but lighter than he’d ever been before. He felt free.
And he
Hilariously enough, the killing blow didn’t even come from Lucius, but rather Dowager Longbottom, Neville’s grandmother. She was wearing a lace trimmed dress with a large hat as was her usual appearance. She had a stern frown on her face with disproval heavy in her eyes, Hadrian suddenly remembered that Neville had grown up suspected to be a squib until nearly age ten. Draco grinned beside him.
“The two are siblings, both are first years in my house.” James said nothing behind his family but Lily gave another tense smile.
“I’m not worried. That would mean he’s back home and murdering me.”
When times seem the darkest, look for the light.
“You’re first years, one’s your brother and one is my godson so for tonight I’ll allow this exception. Breakfast is at eight, hurry to bed now.” Laney grinned at all four boys and snickered as they all snuck down the first year hallway to the dorm room. Hadrian rolling his eyes and brushing shoulders with Draco who stared at him with that strange look, flanked by his two vassals.
“Laugh it up Dragma. I’ll know where you sleep in a few hours.”
Hadrian gently shut the book and pushed it away from him. It disappeared with a pop, back to wherever Tippy had pulled it from for him along with the empty plate. The raven tugged nervously at his misshapen ponytail and got up. Limping back to his room and resecuring the tie against his calf. Making sure he left no mark of his night wonderings. Hadrian sat down, regathering the pieces of his shattered wand, he held them against his chest as he let his thoughts gently circulate.
.” They hesitated, especially Hadrian, but Draco the more tactful of the bunch grabbed both his friends and dragged them away. Visibly down the stairs as if to prove they weren’t eavesdropping.
Lily would come back to an untouched plate sitting outside the door. The only reason he didn’t throw it was because Tippy would have to clean in. James beat him for the offense anyway when Lily ran downstairs crying.
“Tell me Lord Potter. Isn’t it true, that Sirius Black, the boy’s godfather through you before his adoption, petitioned to raise the child and you denied the rights he had as the child’s godfather in even telling him Hadrian’s whereabouts? Wasn’t that the reason the Potter Black alliance was broken and Lord Black left to France, heartbroken with his husband in tow?” He had another godfather? One who
Lily Potter disappeared with her widow’s inheritance and Alex in tow to America. Alex would only be returning for his duties as the Potter Lord. Now only a Most Ancient House. James was buried in one of the Potter family plots (Hadrian took sick glee in convincing Laney to bring him there and spitting on his grave. After all his cruelty, Hadrian was the one who had the last laugh).
“I spent months ruining Alex, fully prepared to target James next. And he did it for me. I’m almost disappointed.” Laney grinned and Draco wrapped an arm around his waist with an conspiratorial grin.
Laney herself right now was kicking a football, dodging between Greg and Vince as she both taught them football and proceeded to curb stomp them at the sport. He knew later they were going to be teaching her Quidditch and it’d be their turn to dominate in a game.
It was lonely, it hurt.
“Do him next please. I’d pay a handsome sum to see Severus in his younger years again.”
Hadrian held back a whimper of pain at his leg, flicking his head up and using a hand to clean the tangled mess out of his eyes. To find himself looking up at the grand entrance of Malfoy Manor.
“He talks to her, Suni by the way. We decided if he had a gift that let him talk to snakes that he deserved to have the chance to let his gift flourish. It also helps him to have a confidant that isn’t one of us. Instant bodyguard too. He drapes her over his little sister and instantly she’s kidnap proof if he has to dart away for a minute.” Erin snorted.
The air rippled softly again and Hadrian’s dark hair pulled up to just below his shoulder, going just a bit darker than his natural hair color and falling in soft and thin waves. His eyes melted into the dark onyx of his Uncle’s and the smirk Hadrian tilted onto his lips was dead on. Tom nearly roared with laughter as Severus sputtered beside him. Even his mother was laughing and clapping delightedly.
“Hadrian.” The blond aristocrat kept his voice soft and nonthreatening as possible. The boy gave a slight nod, his sister was looking worriedly between the two of them. Hadrian blinked. “I promise, I’m not going to let anything happen to you. This will just be some questions to deviate your home life and how you’re doing, okay?”
Soon, they were all pulled into the Slytherin Common Rooms, which were oddly enough in the dungeons. Hadrian wasn’t complaining however; the air was nice and cool. Dark and comfortable, his sister squeezed his hand. It seemed she liked it too as she admired the green and silver drapes, she mused quietly aloud.
“The twins are doing well in my care. I was short a bed on the first night. But it seems Laney and Hadrian made friends with my godson earlier in the day and they had no problem sharing a room until another bed could be procured for Laney in the dorms. Draco seems rather thrilled to have brought the two into his friend group. However, Suni has been terrorizing some of the students by, opening doors at random?” Sara snorted.
“She’s very high up in an international bioterrorism unit. Very influential and very powerful, she’s learned to have a firm hand and an even firmer scowl.” Sara shifted and brown curls tickled under his chin. “Thank you, for watching over my children. And tolerating me snotting all over your robes.”
“Surely he wouldn’t-“
“I never would, you may actually have to worry about him hurting me-ah!” Hadrian smacked Draco’s bicep with a pout that dissolved into a grin. “See! Abuse! I’m in danger Uncle Sev!”
“Please be reasonab-“
Erin raised a single brow at her daughter and all whining stopped. “Yes Mother, Yes Mama.”
Lucius has also shown him ritual magic and allowed him to hone the craft himself, impressed with his skill in performing the difficult magic he had to escape his prison. Hadrian could honestly save he’d never been happier or more fascinated practicing a branch of magic, each successful ritual was an elation, an adrenaline high.
“Where did they get that?”
“Lucius, be kind on the boy. That reminds me so much of my eighth year at Hogwarts, the way I would drool after my husband. Though he was more subtle with his teasing. Young love in times like these is… refreshing.” A few moments and they were all seated at their dining room table. A warm Cherrywood table that Draco knew Hadrian had seen him ogling when the brunet had jokingly dragged him to an ‘Ikea’.
Severus, Sirius, and a man named Remus were also here, arguing at the grill and taking turns working on dinner. Tippy popping in and out to assist them and sending him glances as if to make certain he were still there. Tippy was familiar and deeply loved by him. Remus and Sirius were too, though he’d only met the last two recently. Sirius it turned out was his godfather from the Potters, and when they abandoned him; he rejected the Potters and disappeared with his husband Remus to France. He was also the man that arrested Albus and killed James to protect his honor and his life in a duel supposedly. Though, Sirius refused to say what it was that had set him off so badly and never told him anything about it. Never said anything about why Sirius had seen fit to kill James rather than let him live. Only that it was in Hadrian’s best interest.
“You must call me Sara then! I’m very thankful to Severus for suggesting we meet and more thankful to you for coming. My own son has only glowing reviews about your son, and my daughter is no doubt terrorizing him. I apologize for that.”
Night had finally fallen when Hadrian felt safe to crawl out of his hiding spot. Earlier James had angrily pounded on the door when he’d ignored the call for dinner and Alex had whined at him from the door. But Lily had warded them away with soft words. She didn’t let him eat either however, saying nothing when James told the elves that he either ate with them or not at all.
A firmer nod.
their son mentally and socially.
And it was her fault.
“Brother, can we blow up a sink?” The little one cooed, Snape marveled as the cold boy he was getting to know smiled again. Hadrian held her head in his hands.
“Five years.” His mother looked nearly affronted.
Though, with how the day was going. She had little hope for him, she’d thought by the end of the day she’d get her boys to work out their problems and things could go back to how they were once. Peaceful, with Harry and Alex living and balancing each other out. James could have two sons to spoil rotten, losing Harry had been a hard hit. James hadn’t meant to be so hard on the boy Lily was sure. But he had gotten into the bad habit of resenting his brother like Albus had warned them about. That he might be a squib only seemed to heighten the animosity.
Hadrian almost felt bad.
“Incareous.” Immediately ropes bound Albus helpless and Sirius stepped up from behind the two of them, wand drawn. James jumped back, wand at the ready. The man snarled at him, his forehead was still bleeding. Obviously from where Hadrian had chucked a vase at his head. Sirius gave a proud smirk. Go Haddy, he hadn’t seen that from the doorway.
And felt satisfied.
“I didn’t remember him Tom. I thought the few memories I had were dreams, the dragon plushie in my vault. I don’t remember being pregnant, I don’t remember naming him, watching him grow or crawling for the first time. And that paper…” Severus shuddered in his arms. “Tom, do you even know was the Carotid Artery is?”
“Baby, are you home? Something’s up and I promise I’ll explain once I get there and we’re safe, but I really need to take some, associates, of mine to a place we can lay low and not worry about getting blown up.” Draco could feel Hadrian sober up with little to no words, though he kept his upbeat tone.
“I’m technically a half-blood. Muggleborn mother and Pureblood father. I disowned myself from them however due to… circumstances. And I lived with the worst of muggles that were my relatives, but only for a month or so. Laney’s always had accidental magic, so even though no one’s got a clue her blood status there was no doubt she’s a witch. That being said, any help would be appreciated. There’s a difference between knowing the basics of a society and culture and actually being immersed in it.”
“Alexander has been on the list for years.” Snape furrowed his brows and Draco blinked.
“Naturally. Desert will be done soon too. If you’re lucky, I let you keep the extras.”
The magic of the place whisked away the time all through the female professor’s speech until she left them to prepare for their sorting. Hadrian was peacefully listening to Laney questioning Crabbe and Goyle with Draco’s help when he heard a voice that made his heart pound in his ears. Blood rushing and loud. It made him angry. It made him feel powerless. It made him feel vicious. Hadrian snatched Laney’s hand as Draco immediately picked up his new friend’s worsening mood and saw exactly the cause.
“Ah, and what’s your favorite classes?”
Severus left his godson to his thoughts, chuckling softly as he wandered into the kitchen. His mate was there already, practiced hands using the muggle coffee pot like it was as easy as breathing. His hair was down in slightly messy waves, a baggy tank top hanging off his shoulders. The man gave him a smile.
“We’re fighting for your son, buck up Sara, we’re winning a battle.” Pushing them both up the stairs, they swept inside to find Erin standing, nearly looming over the Potters and Albus. Glaring quite viciously too.
“You’re a sap. Come on. Let’s go home. I, think we have more to talk about then we expected.”
“Harry was always more sensitive than Alex, but he was also very forgiving. If he apologizes for hurting Harry and we show him how much we care he should come back around. We’re his parents.” Resolutely she continued eating. She gave birth to him. Raised him for most of his childhood. She knew him better than those women, he would forgive them. It would just time and some effort, and they would have lots of time if she homeschooled him for the rest of first year. Wait to send him back to Hogwarts until Albus got rid of that girl, resorted her son, and he settled into his rightful place in their family.
Tears were clearly visible as one of the twin’s mothers paced agitatedly, hands shaking and still muttering under her breath. Distressing the children further as he pushed them further behind himself. Hidden behind his robes.
“Be a dear and take their coats.” Draco smirked.
“I actually wanted to speak to you about something.” Hadrian looked up at him, those green eyes looked so familiar, it itched at Severus, but he still sat calmly in front of the boy. Reassured when he only sipped at his coffee calmly. “Draco says you have memory problems?”
Draco…
She looked so perfect, with brown near black curls and the biggest grey eyes looking up at him. Her face was scrunched up in confusion, until a tiny hand grabbed his nose with a loud giggle and a smile across both chubby cheeks.
Quickly he fixed a coffee for him and his beloved (his fiancé his mind grinned) before settling down at the table and grabbing a French curler as Draco stumbled down the stairs, Nagini nipped at his heels.
Turning half way around, the raven glowered at the sight of his biological brother smiling at him. Hadrian wand was still in front of him, a small flame licking at the tip. He wondered if he’d get in trouble for ‘accidently’ lighting the little prick on fire. Alex seemed expectant, waiting until his smile faded and he frowned.
Easily, the boy shrugged, nonchalant.
Oh f-
Valid reaction for an abandoned child.
Flicking a long ponytail over his shoulder, he blinked and turned his head when there was a knock on the train door. Pulling away from his thoughts he stared at a boy with platinum blonde hair stood in front of the two of them, cocking an eyebrow at his and Laney’s intertwined hands.
“Annabee, been a good girl for Mama and Mother baby girl? Have you? Have you!” The girl squealed happily. Grinning when her brother nuzzled her cheek, soaking up his attention and love as their Mama and Mother walked in closer, stopping to stand beside Snape.
“Laney wanted to play and those two are attached at the hip so naturally Hadrian joined to be with his twin.” James’ smile fell, turning into a scowl.
He’d gone hungry in this house before, he didn’t care about going hungry again.
“He’s probably stalking the floo like the dungeon bat he is waiting for news, I’ll come with you. Draco? Can you go run to Gringotts and get some money out for dinner?” Mother stood up.
“Would you just-“
“I’ve always liked emerald.”
“Nothing?!”
The blond was leaning against the tree with him. Their hands were intertwined and those grey eyes covered with some of the most uppity muggle sunglasses Hadrian had ever seen. Suni was splayed across his lap, her golden scales creating a contrast to the other boy’s porcelain skin. Hadrian glanced at the couples and groups around the garden and back to Draco’s hand, twisted so firmly in his own.
Not a good start
Hadrian gagged as his twin laughed in his expense. Annabee stared confused before mirroring her brother’s look of disgust on instinct. His words were still bland, but they bounced with more cadence that Snape had heard yet when he spoke. “I love the both of you. Keep it in the bedroom and away from my eyes.”
There was definitely a resemblance between the two. Potter had the same general facial structure and their hair was the same shade of dark black-brown. That was about the end of their similarities however.
Hadrian shot up and got to the other side of the room as James forced himself in. Alex grinning behind him and waving cheerily as if they hadn’t invaded his prison cell. Lily followed a bit more calmly and warily. She tried to smile calmly at him.
He remembered quite a bit from before he was abandoned and then was adopted. He remembered getting ignored by them all Mother and Father fawning over his brother. Sirius playing with his brother, Remus reading to him. Dumbledore showing him magic and teaching him theory. While he sat and watched. No one coming to play with him, or read to him, or teach him. Eventually even watching was above him and he was locked in his room for
Harry could use his guidance in seemed, spending so much time away from home had changed him for the worst. The girl next to him, he would have to phase her out of his brother’s life and the Malfoy’s son. Malfoy had been a death eater, one of his inner circle, before Voldemort’s demise and so he was both arrogant and dangerous. Alex also couldn’t deny the curl of jealousy and anger that rose up when Malfoy stepped closer to his brother. Occupying the space that should be either his or Ron’s. The girl he didn’t know, but he did know that he didn’t like the way she was hanging on his brother. Holding hands and wrapped around his arm like an octopus. It was shameless and disgusting, especially when she whispered next to his jaw and hoarded his entire left side. She was probably a muggle born that was hoping to leech off his fame through his brother and that just would not do. Especially as Alex watched his brother lean closer to her when she spoke and roll his eyes playfully. Gifting her all of his attention.
the man smiled into the kiss before pulling away. Draco grabbed his hand. Kissing each knuckle before slipping the ring onto Hadrian’s ring finger, letting the small thrill, the ember, that lit up in his chest burn as he got to admire the ring on his hand. He grinned up at his groom, grabbing the front of the man’s shirt and shoving him back inside and onto the bed. Wandlessly and wordlessly throwing up a silencing charm and straddling his future husband with a wicked grin.
“Forgot to warn you guys about that, sorry. If you can lock Hadrian’s dorm room Suni can’t open locks. You’ve no idea the frights I’ve gotten at three am when I heard a slam in the kitchen and found Suni attempting to pry the pantry or the fridge open.”
Snape rolled his eyes, “I’m aware. Draco and Laney ganged up on an unfortunate Gryffindor yesterday in Potions when Hadrian continued to be unable to speak in my class. My house is filled with more introverted students so I don’t expect it to be an issue. Your daughter’s rowdiness is definitely the more… noticeable quirk between the two.” Erin gave a half smirk that mirrored Laney’s easily.
“I’ve heard you’re a Metamorphagus, is that your effortless or just your preferred appearance?” The words tumbled out of his mouth before he thought of just how rude he was being. He was relieved as instead of being offended by the blunt question the younger man smiled softly, eyes glancing at Draco.
What.
First, he gently sawed off a chunk from the ends of his hair and fashioned it into a decent brush head. Using his ponytail, his hair hung limply down and around his head as he hyper focused on wrapping it around his broken wand and the tip of his new brush. Useless for magic, but perfect for painting precious lines.
“He’s also a Metamorphagus to give you a heads up.” The Lord sighed, a hand on his forehead as he leaned against his Uncle Severus’ frame. A smile was on his lips though, betraying the exasperation he tried to put forward.
The blonde fell to the ground, panting as the adults followed him. They all crowded into a small dark alley. Uncle Severus was bleeding from a small cut on his forehead, but overall, they were safe. For now.
“Were your parents' wizards?” Hadrian shrugged.
Both of their heads whipped back when the floo flared. Severus rushed out and past them without a backwards glance toward them. “Albus was at the school, but he’s claiming that he never saw Hadrian after the court room. He locked himself in his rooms before Minerva or I could question him otherwise. I’ll be looking around once I get back there. Has anything new happened on this end yet?”
The excess potions and compulsion charms layered on each other and Tom wasn’t even surprised that no one would recognize Hadrian from Harry. With that much mind manipulation and compulsion, it was a wonder that he wasn’t a moody and violate mess full time. How Hadrian had kept himself intact for the summers away from the insane headmaster was impressive.
Or, rather, actually cared for him rather than some image procured of him. A fantasy son that would never exist except in the mind of Lily. Nor the monster that James seemed determined to make him out to be. As if he, a grown ass man, was ever in the right to kidnap, torture, and abuse a child that happened to be his biological son.
“What?”
Hadrian held back a scoff. As if she didn’t always do that anyway, even before he escaped the hellscape that was this family. James rounded on him the second her footsteps disappeared, snatching the lists of Hadrian’s desk and hissing viciously. “What’s this?”
“Bodies are fluid, so I tweak myself depending on my mood. Kinda like when I’m working out and I get rid of the dick to be more comfortable. As for me now… sort of effortless, my scars are ugly so I smooth them over. But everything else is
I'm going to be working on a new project, however, the difficult part is deciding which project I work on first. So I'll give you two summaries and if you have an opinion. HMU in the comments! The summaries will be in the chapter notes, I'm running out of room here.
“No, you shut the fuck up. The day you lay another hand on my son is the day I hand feed you your own internal organs!” The threat was a vicious hiss, her eyes glowed harshly as she slammed her hand on the desk. Severus mused. She was the magical influence then.
Sara hesitated slightly, but Severus was quick to understand why.
“You corrupted him. He’s a lion like the rest of us Potters on the inside.” Laney rolled her eyes and pressed into Hadrian’s side as he struggled to breathe again. He sounded so much like James it was scaring him. Soft hands gently intertwined with his and squeezed.
He looked so different too. Her eyes on a face she didn’t recognize. So tall as well, he’d be taller than his father if he continued growing. With long limbs and creamy pale skin, long dark hair and eyes that weren’t hidden by glasses. So cold. He looked at her as if she were a disliked stranger.
“You’ll get as much therapy as you want baby boy. As much as you want.”
“Because they’ve never had to worry about them. I don’t see Potter or Alexander, so they probably aren’t here yet.”
It was supposed to be better now!
It looked exactly like Alex’s room.
Lily frowned and James sighed, watching her lightly pick at her food. Dark rich summer red hair curled like a waterfall around her face. Framing adorable freckles and those forest green eyes he’d be enraptured by since first year. Seeing her so unhappy always broke his heart. Which is why he couldn’t tell her everything. It would only upset her. If he kept it quiet, then he could wait until Albus let him tell the whole truth and she’d understand it was what he had to do. What had to be done.
“Of course it is, I have magic too you know. We’re letting the adults work over whatever issue they bumped into, and besides. You promised me an explanation. Not that I’m not delighted to house your relatives, you know I love guests and hosting. Even if my ‘other’ needs fall to the wayside.” Hadrian’s nails dragged down his boyfriend’s chest, he grinned at the shudder his actions elicited. “So. Talk.”
His Papa swept in to shield his other side, looking him up and down as well with a proud smirk.
“Of course! Come on in, my name’s Laney! This is my brother, we’re both first years. What’s your name?” The three boys looked thrown off in the face that was Laney Dragma, but the blonde was the first to relax. Giving a brilliant smirk that caught Hadrian’s eye.
"Shut up.”
“Amenable. It seems I don’t have to add you to the list. That little prat is still on there though.”
A small thud from upstairs caught their attention, and Hadrian got up. Moving into the kitchen, presumably to start breakfast. Draco following like a love-sick dog at his heels. Cissa smiled into her mug.
Hadrian’s own presence was quieter, like a calm stream without a sound, it soothed Draco’s still sensitive capacities as an empath. His hair was pulled into a sleek and long high pony tail, falling smoothly down his spine, the only hint of any messy curls was nestled under his ponytail and the baby hairs that skewed down his hairline and the gentle curves on Harry’s fringe and bangs. Harry’s eyes were a bright and intelligent green, with a tall and lithe figure that spoke of grace and easy elegance. Not standing out like a peacock, but still commanding respect and attention.
Both of them.
“I’m afraid it’s unplottable. I can’t help you or the Auror’s Severus. Just trust I will do what is right for the Greater Good.”
‘Do go ahead. You’re the expert.’
“Erin works in the military, I take care of the kids and run a soap making business out of my home. I sell at the local farmer’s market as well, it works well because the kids play with the other children at the market while I sell. The other moms are more than happy to watch the playground for the merchants.”
“Oh, it’s a large bath. We have one downstairs I guess.”
The table startled again, Draco included this time. His love had looked like his lord already and now he was basically the man’s (slightly more handsome) clone. His lord, though shocked, looked very amused. Raising a hand and pointing to his partner.
He was going to
“Alex is probably still sleeping and dreaming of not being an asshole.”
brother Harry.” Laney gave a confused head tilt.
“Hello there! I’m Laney Dragma, this is my brother Hadrian Dragma. You are…?” Her grin was sharp and challenging, Draco smothered a laugh at the affronted look on Potter’s face and motioned Crabbe and Goyle closer, making them loom over the three of them while Hadrian slowly sorted himself back together.
“He can’t be gone, he can’t be gone he was just there! I was only gone for a couple minutes. I was only gone for a minute.” Mama was freaking out, speaking frantically to herself and clutching Hadrian scarf that had fallen off when Anna had tried to use it to grapple onto their brother. Narcissa was beside her, holding their grieving mother upright.
“I haven’t laughed like that in ages, thanks.”
And there he’d been. Admitting to assaulting James and apperating through the wards.
Hadrian was shaking back in the back, not as bad as he could of, he had trained restraint and silence in the whirl of hectic emotions. That didn’t mean that he was unaffected internally as his mind spun.
“It’s our home Draco, you don’t need permission to bring guests over. Though, I am making dinner, so a headcount might be nice? I hope we have enough chairs…” Draco didn’t even try to stop himself from smiling like a loon. Our home. If he weren’t afraid of getting murdered by the Order the pure domesticity he was feeling might tear him apart. His Uncle Severus looked at him curiously and sharply as he hung up the phone.
Sirius blinked and refocused.
Intent was paramount.
"Who is that? With the dark hair on the left side? I meant to ask earlier, but I forgot.”
Sara turned on Lily immediately, smile sly and dangerously sweet, “How did you raise your son? Hadrian loves baking with me in the kitchen and gardening.” Lily balked.
“Suddenly, being a parselmouth seems less appealing.”
Narcissa was obviously smitten with Draco’s significant other. Severus silently snickered, if she were twenty years younger she’d probably have been all over him. As it stood, she was just enamored and very pleased with the man his son reeled in.
“The judge signed custody to my mothers and a restraining order against
The headmaster’s office was cluttered and messy, it gave Hadrian hives and made him nearly twitch at Laney’s side. Even his more messy and excitable twin seemed a little discontent with the mess, and then she was downright murderous when she looked at the desk.
“No. Now get out.” Crabbe as the one closet to the door and on alert with Draco’s attention and aggression rose up and slammed the door back shut easily with one hand. Silencing her yelling and protests. “Good job Crabbe. You were saying Hadrian?”
“You didn’t.”
“Oh? Then you will have no issue with me lawyering up then. Just for precautions. Can never be to careful when someone’s trying to
“Biologically? No clue. Mama and Mother are aware of magic, Mama has none. Mother might, but she was never schooled and I don’t think she’s ever been interested in pursuing it more than she has already for herself. But both of them worked really hard to work both the wizarding world and the muggle world into our home. Especially when this moron was adopted.” Laney jerked a thumb at him. Hadrian picked up the que.
“Mama!”
NEW PROJECT IS UP!!! I added it to the collection named Contracted Death
“Stay still, I need to fix your tie.” Draco was in his space, long and thin pale fingers working at the tie around his neck. Basically sharing the same breath, but Hadrian didn’t want to pull away. It felt warm and comfortable.
Certainly one his easier custody interviews. Lucius hummed, shuffling his paperwork around again and sorting it neatly into relevant folders. Waiting patiently until the two mothers and Severus filed back in. Lucius straightened his back and greeted them with a nod.
“Why don’t you go work on his room, I’ll clean up dinner.” Lily smiled at him and left the table, hurrying up the manor stairs. James heaved a sigh and started gathering the plates. Muttering to himself softly. “The thing needs to die. If I have to kill Harry at the right time to give Alex a chance to live and defeat the Dark Lord as Albus says. Then Lily is simply going to have to live with the fact Voldemort ensured that the boy’s soul was damaged tainted beyond repair. His sorting proves what I’ve always known. His life isn’t worth the thousands of lives his death will save.”
“He was dark! That scar on his forehead? A sign that the Dark Lord put a horocrux in him! A piece of his soul! As long as Harry is alive, You-Know-Who can come back again and again and Alex will never be safe. Is one boy’s life really worth the entirety of Britain?” James looked so pathetic suddenly, at his mercy. At wand point. So unlike the loyal boy he once knew and unlike his beautiful, beautiful godson. Who was so strong. Who suffered under this man’s hand.
“Albus! Don’t play coy or stupid with me! We both know you represented the Potters, they lose and suddenly Hadrian goes missing? Where are the Potters and Hadrian?!” Snape snarled at his employer. His godson was missing and the snake inside him was all venom and fangs, ready to dig in. Albus just smiled calmly.
Suddenly Professor Snape was upon them, merely glancing at the five snakes before he looked to the lion on the floor as the youngest Weasley boy was working on getting him up. “Twenty points from Gryffindor for lazing on the ground and blocking the entrance to the class.”
“Oh cool! Harry’s got his pet snake Suni, she’s been his for years now. But I just got a new kitten and I’m still trying to get her used to me. I named her Marissa. Do you have any pets?” Draco grinned, not responding for a moment as they all stumbled into one boat before he spoke again.
“Grand castle, soft and warm yellow lights and a night sky with a lake? This is basically Mama’s photography wet dream.” All five of the eleven-year-olds stumbled out of the boat. Crabbe and Goyle talking between the two of themselves as they helped out the three distracted students out of the boats, gaining grateful smiles in return.
“Brother, I want Italian later tonight. We’ll see you after breakfast Professor.” Laney gave a cheeky grin and blew a kiss before grabbed her brother’s hand and squeezing it lightly. Dragging him off to breakfast as he trapped himself in his head.
“Hadrian, where’s your shirt?”
“I have that to give back by the way. And a sink faucet.”
A medium, he’d need one for the ritual circle. The only material thing he would need as long as he memorized the words he would need efficiently enough. The wards would scream if Hadrian tried to smuggle the book into his room for guidance, so memorizing was the only option. He should only need chalk or paint, something that would last and not get brushed away by a draft or swirl of magic. Not that his loving ‘father’ would ever give him access to anything like that. After that last visit he’d left Hadrian bloodied up and taken everything useful or studious for him to do, or for him to use against them.
Lily’s grasp tightened on her ladle. How was she supposed to have known that her sister abandoned her son? She never called or sent post anymore and Albus had said they were family and Harry was sure to be safe there. Not in danger from wizards there, in danger of being Alex’s twin brother.
“Narcissa would be disappointed if you didn’t bring the child. She’s rather smitten with them, our biggest regret is not being able to have more of our own children. Although even just one child was a bit of a handful to raise with accidental magic.”
“Suni, Hadrian, how are you this morning?” Suni scented Draco affectionately, but refused to move off of her human. Choosing to be difficult and force the raven to squirm out of his pajamas, Suni unhelpfully constricting to keep her balance.
“Harry? Are you awake? Lunch is nearly ready! I’m calling your brother and father in from flying, it’s a shame you couldn’t join them.” The doorknob bent and stopped with the lock, jiggling and the door shuddered as it was tugged on. “Harry? Harry are you there? It’s Mum.”
“No, he’s ours.”
If Dumbledore had adopted his child out to the Potters and twisted his mind almost beyond repair. Nearly killed him with muggle relatives and hardships at that blasted school, almost made Tom kill his own child. It wouldn’t surprise Tom if they learned Albus was the reason that he and his husband couldn’t remember their own son.
Yes. This was coming home.
-I’m a child, easy to hide and escape justice
Something about that didn’t sit right with her. But, he husband was an Auror, he knew the law better than she did. And she missed her little Harry. Everything would be okay, if Albus and James agreed nothing could go wrong. So, she didn’t question him. Only smiled warmly, brightening as he smiled back.
The two were a sight to behold. The shorter woman was more stout, with caramel skin and brown curls that seemed to bleed warmth like a beach sun, her smile was easy and bright as another woman loomed over her. This woman was lean, with skinny but strong limbs and pin straight blonde hair that was held in a high ponytail on her head. Her eyes were cool and lips firmly in a blank scowl. Snape had to pause for a moment when the resemblance got a little two uncanny towards his newest duo of troublemakers. The shorter woman reached a hand out to him.
“My ring.” Severus’ smile got strained, but he dropped the glare to look at his son.
Because they were scared children.
“I’m sorry?” Alex grinned.
Hadrian stared, and stared, and
Laney took that as a challenge.
Tom gently pulled the papers from Hadrian’s, his
Ignoring his brother and leaning into that red haired little girl with the loud-mouth.
Cons- Who knows how long I’ll be here
The hat seemed to give a pleased hum at not being shoved any particular way and shouted loud and clear.
It was an impressive sight.
School will never be dull again.
“Hey Draco, where do they put our luggage? They kept both our animals with it and I’m worried for them.” Draco gave a firm pat on her shoulder before maneuvering to walk between the two siblings. Crabbe and Goyle flanking behind by a step and forming a protective ‘V’ formation. Hadrian was rather impressed with the practiced smoothness of the gesture.
Hadrian was going to reply when the door to their cabin was rudely forced open. A girl with frizzy brown hair barging in unapologetically. Hadrian gave a displeased pout as Laney smiled fondly and patted his arm. A tight smile on her lips as Draco sneered at the intruder.
“You’re so fucking beautiful, never talk about yourself like that again.” Hadrian finally cracked a smile, Draco could feel it hovering just under his bottom lip as Hadrian looked at them with those mesmerizing eyes. The scars, the emotions, the strength Hadrian had for enduring them; they were all Hadrian’s and it was all beautiful to him.
“Final questions children. Do you wish to stay with Sara and Erin?” Hadrian nodded so quick that Lucius thought his head might fall off. Laney looked affronted and deeply offended, protesting the idea vehemently. “Do you wish for visitation with the Potters and Alexander Potter?”
He was wary of course, but he also didn’t think his effortless looking more like his fathers would be so bad. Hadrian relaxed his shoulders and let out a sigh, raising the vial in a small toast, though he didn’t know what to. Having a family again? Finding his birth heritage? Reclaiming what he’d lost?
“Laney used the distraction to catch an extra episode and stay up later. So far Anna’s keeping the tradition. Though more creatively. I found it in the freezer last night.”
“Of course Laney.” The girl grinned, slow and long. Lucius had the smallest twitch of memory about Cheshire Cats in that squib’s fairytale. Hadrian simply gave her the blankest expression, occlumency? No. Basically muggle raised and too young. Lucius would mention it to Severus later perhaps.
His longing for home was near painful after a week like this.
Why I don’t… Who would do this to you, to me?”
“I am fine. Suni is a brat.”
His waiting game will continue.
“His brain got lost in all that hair.”
Stuffing the letter in his robes. Severus escaped down to the dungeons, whistling to call his post raven down to his chambers he sat down at his desk and grabbed a quill and parchment as swiftly as he could.
Fault.
The dark haired boy didn’t even meet his gaze however, too busy staring at other people as the hat above him yelled Gryffindor and he was off to join Ron and wait eagerly for his brother as McGonagall continued to listen before yelling out with a small tone of confusion.
“How did you raise them, they’re obviously magic and you’re…” Not was the unspoken word, as least Lily was semi-polite about it.
Even Dumblefuck couldn’t steal things from the school or the Malfoy Manor it seemed.
Draco remembered that one Christmas they’d shared. Their first one as mates.
Annabee cheered with Laney and Draco raised his hand excitedly. Mama ruffled the blonde’s hair and smiled at Lucius as they all began migrating to the hall. “I’ll use the floo to give a quick call to Severus to come join us. You don’t think he’s busy do you?”
, home safe and sound with more school supplies and completed homework from the year before. I brushed it off, but Draco’s worried that I can’t even remember the name of the school. The only thing I know is that I’m forced into one morph the whole time and it makes my skin burn.” Severus blinked, studying him carefully. Blackouts were one thing but losing a specific portion of time every year was odd.
-James is an auror and I could get destroyed
“I’m Draco Malfoy, this is Crabbe and this is Goyle. I’m going to be a Slytherin, what house do you think you’ll be?” Laney’s tight red curls bobbed in the corner of his eye and he looked at Draco’s face. Sharp silver eyes. Hadrian paused, watching as they continued to converse.
Shoving the pieces of his wand into his pocket, he darted out the door. The halls were dreary and oppressive, but the magic still enveloping him was intoxicating and left him feeling high. As if nothing could touch him. Whipping around a corner, he slammed into a small body. Sending them both careening to the floor. Alexander lay under him, shocked.
Lily watched with a deep bitterness as what used to be her quiet and most withdrawn son blossomed under her eyes. Butting his head against that woman’s daughter affectionately moments after he’d rejected his own blood brother.
Snape rolled his eyes, “Basil is hatred. The original meaning was, before it became love. However I favor sticking to what flowers meant before people tried to beautify their meanings with false pleasantry.”
Severus’ letter had come as a surprise to him. Meeting with him through the floo had been a meeting with an equal amount of surprise. A meeting that had filled him with equal parts hope and outrage. Hearing that James had lost custody and proceeding then to simply take it, it had infuriated him. When he’d tried and failed to gain custody as James abandoned his beloved little godson Harry. Harry-Hadrian who was no longer just a child.
“Oblivate.”
“Yes.”
It made him sick. And there was no five-year-old to ground him. It was dizzying.
“He’s doing great, Alex is annoying, but our classes are awesome! I’m getting tutored, but Hadrian’s curb stomping the rest of us in lessons.”
Draco looked impressed with his knowledge, giving a nod as if pleased. “You seem to know what you’re talking about. I do hope when you say biological family and ex-brother it means you won’t be hounding to be one of those bumbling Gryffindors. I’d love to see some competent students in a more, respectable house.”
“No! He’s my brother and I’m not going to let some muggle born gypsy steal him away and corrupt him to the-“ Snap. The anger cracked and popped like a strike of lightening in his chest, his body moved faster than his mind. The three other purebloods startling as he beat them to the punch. Hauling his former brother by the collar and shoving him against the wall. Hissing venomously next to his ear.
Still, nothing, even sweet memories could compare to the soft humming that was coming from the kitchen. Voldemort looked wary, hand at his wand with Severus also at the ready. Nagini curled around both her masters’ feet. Draco stepped forward, letting his school bag drop to the floor noisily.
Draco was sitting beside him as Laney sat across from him. Crabbe and Goyle sandwiching her protectively. The lunch table was crowded, pressing the blonde tight against his side in a way that made Hadrian hold back a blush as he enjoyed the warmth. The blonde was chewing slowly as his eyes wandered speculatively across the hall.
“Really, well, I suppose if anyone bothers you Suni will put them in their place.”
Severus gently brushed his fingers through her hair. More shouting was beginning to echo down from the room. Along with a cold rumble that sent shivers down his spine. “No one will take your son. Sounds like your wife is going to freeze everyone with sheer will power.”
Laney grinned dopily between Crabbe and Goyle a few steps ahead of them, “A true edge-lord. I am so down. Tea!”
At least Tippy cared.
Draco gaped and Severus’ hands shook. One reaching out to cup Hadrian’s jaw who was still confused, but perceptive enough to know something was happening and to stay quiet. His uncle stepped closer to Hadrian, letting the paper fall to the ground, which Draco’s father snatched up quickly, and held Hadrian’s face with both hands.
Then he had to witness Hadrian popping into existence, collapsing from blood loss from a hex James shot at his own son and hemorrhaging from his core because he had to rip the family magic from his soul and blood to escape a household he’d already fought tooth and nail to escape. Magically exhausted from apperating at his young age. Images of him dropping, passing out in Mrs. Anderson’s arms, skin paper white and blood covering his gaunt frame. Hair long and gritty with grease and grime. Limp. Like a puppet without strings.
Now she was still the same, but it was obvious to him that he’d scared her. More often than not when they walked Mother would have a hand on the back of his head, covering his old injury. Double checking the straps when he had to wear a leg brace and carrying him when he couldn’t walk anymore.
“Christmas, when he was nine. You screamed when I told him to let her wreak havoc on the neighbor’s mouse problem.”
All the students stepped into the beautiful hall and as a ratty hat started to sing, Hadrian glanced at his companions. Laney had a dreamy smile full of wonder and excitement as she held his hand. Draco caught his eye and gave a confident smirk with Crabbe and Goyle gave him firm nods. It bolstered Hadrian immediately as he looked up at the head table with determination.
“Oh my dearest brother. My knight in shining armor comes to sweep me off my feet.”
“That’s dumb. Of course, staying hidden is better. My aunt and uncle knew what I was growing up until I got away from them. It was awful… there are good people. But terrible things happen when the wrong people know…” Draco rubbed his hands along Hadrian’s sides, he’d never seen the scars. Hadrian always stayed out of his effortless as much as possible, but that didn’t mean Draco couldn’t infer his life before he’d been taken in by his boss and given a home to reside in. His mentor hadn’t been a parent in the strictest sense. Hadrian didn’t need a parent after the trauma he’d survived. But she had given Hadrian a roof, traded work for a living wage and food on the table, gave Hadrian a culture and heritage to call home.
“I wanna finish eating after we’re done.”
Now Alexander was bearing the full-frontal assault of the Twin Terrors of Gryffindor.
Not something he saw coming, but a nice outcome.
“I think I graduated last year seeing as the old coot never showed up to get me for school. Which means I can finally work full time and get the house ready. Actually build up savings for us. No, using your parent’s money is not going to be included in my mind. I need to meet them by the way. We’ve been dating for five years and mates for a year, when will I not be your side hoe?” Draco chuckled into his love’s hair, letting him ramble on and on in the sweet sunlight.
