"Yes," Draco said. "We belong to you, fully."
He stared at her along with Healer Smethwyck whose frown somehow made Draco want to squirm with second-hand embarrassment for Mother's attempt to lie. She pursed her lips, folded her hands in her lap, and then raised her chin at Draco.
He stopped when Harry frowned at him. His wide eyes, dark irises shot through with lightning bolts of lemon and celadon, shimmered with magic. And then with tears that welled up as their bond shared what Harry meant before he said the words out loud.
"We await you, Heir Potter-Black," Silverclaw said from his spot on the sidelines. "Be seated and we will begin."
Easy. It would work. Draco could do this. Harry couldn't. He didn't know enough. Not nearly enough, but Draco did, and he could, and his wards adored him. They'd do exactly what Draco wanted, even if it was locking up tight until Draco was sixty. Or two hundred.
Dobby and Ivy both popped away, but only after Dobby threw a sloppy salute at Harry.
"We is telling her," Ivy told Draco.
"No," Harry said, shaking his head at Draco so that Draco would stay right where he was.
The elves popped into place.
"Don't pass out on us now, Malfoy," Moody said entirely too gently for Draco's fraying nerves. "You're the only thing keeping You-Know-Who here."
"You like the idea of having someone who knows you," Harry said. He poked Draco's shoulder. "Don't try to lie to me."
"No, Dumbles knows," Dobby said, glaring at the floor. "He knows. Is on purpose."
Harry didn't take Remus' hand. He took Draco's hand, which was good. Draco was tired enough that he nearly fell down the stairs halfway down into the dungeon. Grandfather followed them. So did Mother. Amal and Professor McGonagall stayed in the parlor, both of them looking too tired to even get up.
Draco shook his head and turned to Ivy who pointed to the tallest pine tree out beyond the war wards. It was a quarter mile away but even so Draco could see the blue flame of the phoenix. She was huge, easily as tall as Draco. Her tail was a grand long one that would have made any of the peacocks back home jealous. Her flames were shades of blue mixed with icy white, but he thought he could make out a hint of purple at the tip of her extravagant tail and about her head.
"Enough," Draco said, pushing the biscuits at Harry. "I will not descend into maudlin tears."
It stayed firmly away from the varied bonds Draco carried, brushing over them and accepting them one by one. The only thing it kept coming back to was the blessing curled deep inside of Draco. That it plucked at from time to time like a toddler playing with the strings of a harp to make it sing atonally.
After Silverclaw left, Harry and Amal had made Grandpa Arcturus go lie down and take a nap in the suite right next door to Harry's suite. The Master suite which meant that his bedroom was the size of Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia's entire ground floor, plus a little bit of the yard outside. It was enormous with a humongous bed that Harry could have had a slumber party on and invited most of his fellow second year Gryffindors.
"Well, if that isn't a kick in the pants," Lord Black said from behind the curtains next to the fireplace.
"Yes," Grandpa Arcturus said. "Narcissa and I made a start of it two days ago. We should see progress in the next day or two. If Croaker listens, we might have Sirius back in as little as six or seven hours."
Mr. Parkinson flinched. "I don't. That wasn't what I meant."
"We'll deal with Mum and Dad," Bill promised. "Show us what you've got."
He'd thought Harry was desperate last night. That was nothing compared to what Draco felt now. As the blood flowed down Harry's face, splitting to run like tears down the sides of his nose to the corners of his mouth and then onwards to drip off his chin, Draco shuddered over the loneliness.
Harry frowned. "Um, I'm not actually supposed to do magic, you know. Not without adults around. Or Draco at least."
"Berk," Harry said, grinning at Draco whose eyes sparkled with amusement. "Come on. Let's get moving."
"It's at least a backup insurance plan," Draco agreed. "We'd best hurry or we'll be late, Harry."
"Well, we call it a maze but it's really a traditional labyrinth," Draco explained. "The way Mother explained it was that you walk the path of the labyrinth while praying or meditating and it… brings you enlightenment. Or power. Or something. She'd never done it. I don't think anyone has walked the labyrinth since, oh, goodness, probably when my grandfather was very young."
It sounded like glass and felt like jumping into the ice-cold waters of Hogwarts' lake early in spring. The fury left Arcturus' face. Wonder, shock, and then laughter that Harry echoed.
"The two of you are having a bi-level conversation," Mr. Swashlin said. He came in and took a cup of the special tea from Dobby with a nod of thanks. "There's the things you say and then there's the things you're communicating without saying anything."
And Harry.
Harry nodded, dark eyes going so sad that Draco wanted to hug him. "I know. I do know. I think this is the last chance we have to save him. We have to try. I just… I can't let Dumbledore win on this."
Draco bit his lip. Then he had to act. But carefully. It wouldn't do to give Father an excuse to torture and kill him. Then again…
It was holding Draco as the two of them read.
When Draco lay back down and stared it was the same. But staring towards the window in his bedroom, a narrow arrow slit that had been glazed with blue and cream stained glass in a simple diamond pattern, the not-wards shimmered in the corner of his eye.
The ward circle around the journal was three layers deep and the innermost layer flickered like open flame as the soul shard trapped inside tried to battle its way out.
"I… think so?" Harry said, humming. "Not sure. I mean, maybe? I didn't know anyone could run like that. I think that part was real."
"Oh," Harry breathed as he realized that yeah, that was the exact same feel as his fleece blanket. It wasn't like the blanket. It was the same magic exactly. "They warded my blanket. Wow. I had no idea you could do that. Cool."
Harry grinned. "You're welcome. For as long as you want to stay. I mean, you're the first grownup to actually help me. Go on, Dobby. But be careful. Don't let anyone see you and don't get caught."
They were alive and free, now and forever. Everything else could wait now that they'd accomplished that one thing.
There was no humility in Harry's prayer. There was only trust and love and joy. So strong, so beautiful. Draco could never be that way.
Mother's hands flew to her mouth. "No, he wouldn't. …Would he?"
Light exploded.
"Oh, what have they done to you?" Mother whispered as she held Draco up and then guided him to one of the stiff-backed sofas that Father had decreed to be "appropriate" for the grand history of the Malfoy family.
They were safe.
For tonight, Draco felt safe and utterly happy in his own home for the first time ever.
"Right, so magical communion with your core and your magic," Amal said as he flopped into one of the chairs close to the fireplace, "find the thing and then be nice as can be while you tell it that it did good and it's done working because everything is better."
"Blue?" Grandfather, Mother, Remus, and Amal all asked as if they'd never heard of such a thing.
So happy, Harry was so very happy. Draco raised his head, laughing along with his soulmate. How could he not?
"Yes, Mr. Malfoy," Professor McGonagall said as she took off her glasses, pinched the bridge of her nose and then sighed. "There are. A great many more, all of them behavior modification curses that sculpt poor Remus into do exactly what the castor wants."
"No, of course not," Draco replied. He swallowed and Harry realized that the stomach-churning nerves were at least three quarters Draco's nerves getting to him.
Draco strode up the long, dark hallway leading to the grand parlor where the biggest fireplace was; the only one linked to the Floo system in all of Malfoy Manor. Father had locked the floo powder away. Draco couldn't escape through the floo, but it was better than anywhere else in the manor right now. At least here, Draco could imagine that he might be free someday.
Then Amal ruffled both of their hair before following Mother out of the library. Draco flopped back on the couch, heart pounding. How odd to have that sort of approval out of adults. Mother was expected. Amal and Grandfather Arcturus?
Mother's plan had failed. Her very last idea, her only remaining chance to free them all, was done for.
The silver must have been a glamour.
"Mother?"
The lump of darkness that was Fake Dumbledore screamed and curled inwards, disappearing into the pool of darkness underneath Hogwarts.
Draco's smile was blindingly beautiful as he blushed and then leaned into Harry's side in a cautious little invitation to a hug. Which Harry gladly gave him. They snuggled on the best couch, watching as the grown ups tossed ideas back and forth, researched from all the books in the library, and compared old songs, old prayers, old ideas that they'd learned when they were young.
"Molly, she, I knew about it, but I didn't really see what was wrong with it," Hermione said. "She set up some betrothal contract for you and Ginny. It's supposedly iron-clad. There's no way out of it."
A simple Alohamora wasn't going to do it. Draco tried it, of course. No reason not to but he had no expectation that it would work, and he wasn't disappointed when it didn't. Harry bit his bottom lip, all but vibrating next to Draco. Thank Merlin for the cloak. It was probably the only thing keeping the two of them alive.
"Please, Mother," Draco begged and didn't even attempt to make it sound like an order. "You know I have so many things to do. Relatives to notify, the Ministry, Gringotts. I can't do this alone. Please, I need your help and I need you to be as strong and healthy as possible."
"Only the Fidelias?" Grandpa Arcturus asked from the top of the stairs. He looked just about as angry as Harry felt.
"Thank you," Draco said. He put a hand on Blue's shoulder, smiling at the way she beamed at him. "Be careful. I don't want any of you hurt. I doubt that Mother will stir, but we can't count on that."
He couldn't deny that. Ivy opened the door, letting Mother, Grandfather and Professor McGonagall into the room. Mother ran straight to him, heedless of the ancient circles still slowly fading underneath Draco. She promptly healed his hand while dressing him down in words he barely heard between the exhaustion dragging him to sleep and Mother's sobs.
Potter Keep had a room with a ritual circle.
"To do what?"
For now.
"Potter, your random ideas tend to be the most powerful and dangerous ones," Draco said with a tired sigh that seemed to come from the very bottoms of his feet. He tilted his head back and shut his eyes as if he were as exhausted as he'd been last night.
"True," Draco called back. "What is so fascinating?"
Ivy bit her lip and then drew one finger along the base of Draco's thumb. There was no pain, but blood still welled up. Draco slapped his bloody palm against the ward stone.
She went as red as her hair when Bill pushed her over to one of the sofas and made her get some food and tea. Neville was still in the Keep, which kind of made Harry feel bad because he didn't want to leave Neville out of the discussion, but well, explaining what had happened, how he'd ended up here with Draco, was important.
It was small, ridiculously so for a place that was renowned for being one of the best and most secure magical castles in the world. Where Malfoy Manor was huge with three wings and four stories, Potter Keep had ten bedrooms. Total.
"Oh, I want one of those," Draco said, staring at Moody's wrist and blinking so that his eyes stopped blurring and crossing on him. "That's brilliant."
"Oh!" Harry squeaked and slammed his book shut. His face was blazingly red as he gave it right back to Ivy who huffed and glowered at both of them. "Nope, not reading those. They're porn."
The instant they all disappeared through the floo, Draco had quite literally fallen down in relief.
Except that he might've punched Ron in the face and thrown Hermione off the battlements if she kept scoffing at him and implying that he was too stupid to know what he was talking about. So no, not a good idea.
Draco snorted and nodded, slowly, cautiously, sliding his arms around Harry's waist. He squeaked when Harry hugged him tightly. Being really hugged, good firm bearhug-hugged, felt so very strange through the bond.
Draco had the distinct impression that the wards laughed over that. He snorted a quiet laugh before tossing floo powder into the fire. Odd that it felt so very wrong to be away from Harry for this long. Odd and yet not odd at all.
"Come on, Mum," Ron whined. "Why can't we go check on Harry? We haven't gotten a single letter from him. Not even a Muggle one. You know that's not right."
"Thanks, Bill, Charlie," Fred said.
Harry shrugged. "Well, sure. I mean, we can't get back into Malfoy Manor to do it again anytime soon and it's sort of their job, isn't it?"
"You should've had an intro class that told you all about family magic," Amal said slowly while his frown went from confused to thunderous to about to make angry goose noises again.
"No, you don't have to stay," Harry murmured. "You can let go now. Shhh. It's okay. You can let go."
"Ivy will," Ivy promised, shooing him out of the bedroom. "Master Harry goes and does brave scary things. Is your turn now."
"Grandpa Arcturus?" Harry said when Draco started hissing angrily.
Magic itself.
"It's still going," Harry explained as he scrambled out of Draco's bed since that was where they'd ended up last night. "And Potter Keep has way better protections than Malfoy Manor. Well, the same protections but around a smaller space so they're super-duper thick and heavy. We'll be much safer there."
Draco blinked, surprised that he hadn't noticed it. He'd apparently turned the wards down just a bit too much. He adjusted them again and there it was. Mother was looking for him. She did feel much better, thankfully, though her magic had a long way to go before she was properly healthy.
"No one can really see us?" Harry asked. A twelve-year-old boy shouldn't be here. Dobby definitely shouldn't.
But he smiled, finally, patting Harry's hip with a bloody, grass-stained hand.
Rather than run through the hallways like a little kid, Draco had Ivy pop him to the floo room. Mother and Grandfather Arcturus were there with Blue and Cooper who had stacks of books in their arms. When Draco appeared, Mother smiled and came over to brush her hands over his hair.
Draco shuddered. "Right. Someone explain to me exactly what's going on right now."
"Whatever you're doing right now," Harry said. "It's not helping. Clearly. I mean, obviously because the blessing hasn't let go. Did you remember the part about being nice and gentle and trying to encourage the blessing that it'd done its best?"
As Silverclaw sent messages to have every single heir ring that Harry was due brought in, Amal babbled about how to get ahold of Arcturus Black as he scribbled notes on his list in the file. Harry sat back in his chair and waited. If there was a better way to get an ally than saving their life, Harry didn't know it.
There were exactly three people in Hogwarts: Harry, Draco and Dumbledore sitting in his office doing who knew what. Even the map called him Dumbledore, so Harry didn't feel at all bad about continuing to do so. He licked his lips and did the second check that Remus had taught them, the one that said where the elves were.
"Ivy does not know, Master," Ivy said. She climbed up on the bed and sighed. "None of us is knowing. Not even Dobby."
Amal snorted as he wrapped an arm around Harry's shoulders. They stopped on the landing just below the floor with all their bedrooms. The curving stairwell was beautiful, lit from overhead by a huge magical skylight that showed clouds drifting across the sky, and from the windows that pierced the walls ever few yards.
"You, too," Harry said. He started. "You brought a knife, right? It's gonna want blood."
Tortured them all.
"But what exactly did you do?" Draco asked. He sat next to Harry, frowning at him with nothing but worry in his eyes.
Of his soul.
"Goblins," Amal agreed as the others nodded grimly. "Open the floo up specifically to the bank and send him on through. I'll write a quick note for him to give to your account manager. If all goes well, we can let him in tomorrow sometime."
"Dobby will guard his Master Harry Potter!" Dobby declared as if he were ready to go into battle right that second.
"What?" Draco squeaked just as badly as Harry had, staring at the books in horror. "Who brought those into the house?"
Two sides of the same thing. Wild and harsh, like a shifting, rag-clothed wolf hunting his prey, tearing its throat out, like blood spilling onto the grass while the wolf howled his fury at the clouds rumbling overhead.
Moody caught the back of Draco's jumper, hauled him back upright and then passed him off to the green-faced junior auror whose hands shook as he held Draco up. Amazingly, Moody nodded approvingly to Draco even though he'd almost fallen down in front of everyone.
The Malfoy family magic hummed happily at Draco despite the things disturbing it.
Pretty much everyone reacted the same way to Sirius' crossed out commentary. Horror and horror, of two different varieties, prompting a ton of eye rolling and disgusted huffs from Professor McGonagall. Harry prodded Draco to go back to bed, then dragged him out of the room and up to bed, tucking him right in with Ivy backing him up. Ivy even pushed a glass of warm milk into Draco's hand and made sad puppy eyes at him until he drank it.
It could…
Fangtooth snorted. "Go sit down, Heir Potter-Black. He is alive and that, in itself, is a miracle. The man is too stubborn to die, or he would've been dead before Yule last year."
Ivy giggled as Dobby popped in by Harry's side to hug his waist tightly. "Dobby is always best at that. Dobby is like a great big storm. Nothing stops Dobby."
Mother was safe. So was Draco. He could deal with everything that came afterwards just for that.
Lord Black was properly dressed for the first time in Draco's memory, standing tall and strong in the sunlight. The grey tinge to his skin was gone. The ever so faint smell of sickness was gone, too, though Draco only noticed it once he realized that he'd been fooled.
Draco stared silently. The thoughts ticking by in his head felt like a big, complicated old grandfather clock, the sort with the open face that let you see all the workings inside and a pendulum that moved with inexorable regularity.
Who could he call? If he had floo powder, the floo would connect him to anyone in the Wizarding world. The Aurors? No, they'd let Father go when he should have been in prison since Draco was a baby. Professor Snape was no help. He was as much of a Death Eater as Father. Perhaps more so given that Professor Snape had taken the Mark willingly and Father, so he claimed, had not.
"Why him?" Harry asked with a puzzled frown.
"Dumbledore," Harry whispered.
"A lot too hard," Harry agreed. He shrugged. "They're not listening, really. And I'm not at all sure about this do it for someone else thing they're all stuck on. I did it for myself."
Draco/Harry/Fred/George said as one, words thundering around them,
The tides of electric blue shifted into a tsunami that roared straight at Draco. He opened himself to it, opened himself to the wards and the Elves and everything that truly mattered. His family. His mother.
Both Grandfather Arcturus and Professor McGonagall went next. They settled in at the same time, began to commune with their magic at the same time, but Professor McGonagall removed the blessing in five minutes while Grandfather Arcturus took nearly fourteen minutes.
This.
"Light," Amal agreed. "Light and free and happy and bloody exhausted, pardon my language."
"We don't know it was him," Amal said with a snort-laugh that turned into a real laugh as both Harry and Dobby stared at him. "Okay, fine, yes. It probably was him. Is him. Either way, that's the infuriatingly bad news. If we can save Lord Black, then he can deal with it though."
"I don't have any money, Dobby," Harry said. He grimaced. "I mean, I have money. I don't know how much, but I have money at the bank. I just can't get at it. I don't have my vault key."
"Lady Magic," Draco whispered as the reversed sky trembled overhead and the black path cracked and showed gleaming rainbow ribbons of light below their feet.
He sighed and shrugged.
They were a spear bringing the light of hope into the darkness. They were twined souls working to save the world. They prayed, together, silently, lips moving and feet pacing as one towards the monstrosity that Dumbledore had created underneath Hogwarts.
He'd slept until ten. Dragged himself out of bed by eleven. Now it was a few minutes shy of noon, the next-to-perfect time for what he had to do. The best-best time would be midnight, the witching hour, but Draco didn't dare wait that long. Father would be waking any time now. He would feel the Elves' absence in his magic.
"You stole Aunt Petunia's best apron," Harry said in a squeak before he burst out laughing.
"He…" Harry stopped and shook his head. "Dobby!"
A little pulse came back and then Dobby popped into Harry's bedroom. The grubby old pillowcase was gone, replaced with a military-style uniform in Dobby's size with cargo pants and a long-sleeved shirt like something a soldier might wear. Dobby had rolled up the sleeves, which had tiny cargo pockets on the biceps, and secured them with those little flaps that buttoned to keep sleeves from falling back down as he worked. He even had on combat boots that were shiny and black.
Harry's eyes went wide. He looked up at Lord Black who was frowning at Draco as though he wasn't at all sure what to make of Draco. The other man, Amal, bit his lip and switched his stare between Lord Black, Mother and Draco while fidgeting nervously. If he weren't Muggleborn, Draco would eat his favorite pair of dragonhide boots. No one raised in Magical society would ever fidget that way. It showed too much weakness.
Harry didn't suggest that Croaker go find another place to do the prayer ritual, not outright, but he did make sure to give Croaker everything that he could to replicate it. It might work. It might not. One way or the other, more people doing it would keep Dumbledore from stopping them and it might just save more people.
Both Fred and George sucked in sharp breaths as they stared at Moony in awe. Draco rolled his eyes and pushed the map closer to Remus who seemed somewhat reluctant to touch it at first. He brushed one finger across the corner of it, eyes sad, before sweeping his hands over the surface.
Neither did Draco, despite the little prayers that Mother had taught him. This was so much more than the candle ritual, so much more than lighting the Yule log or midsummer rites.
As he took those last few steps into the heart of the golden light, the bond to Draco flared alive after being silent since they parted on the stairs. Draco's faith was there, pulsing in the bond. His hope, his belief, his trust of Harry was right.
Ivy nodded again, more sadly.
Baby's screams. Animal screams. The screaming bleat of a sacrificed kid goat. The squeal of a dying piglet.
"I think…" Draco swallowed around a throat gone abruptly dry as sand. "I think I just saw Lady Magic, Ivy. She was sort of… over the ward stone? Maybe she was the ward stone? No, over it."
Draco grinned across the top of his mug. "Well, Dobby did always have a ton of energy. Burning it all off working for Harry is probably good for both of them."
She stared at the spell, mouth working even though no noise came out. After a moment, Professor McGonagall thrust herself away from the doorframe and snapped her wand out, handle first. She passed it over to Grandpa Arcturus who took it as if she'd just given him a knife and commended him to stab her with it.
Draco panted and waved a hand at Mother when she shouted at him, some pointless question that he couldn't focus on even if he wanted to. The spell was hurting Harry. That, they couldn't hurt Harry. He'd been through too much already!
"We didn't… do that," Draco said as he sipped the milk more because he didn't want to disappoint Ivy than because he wanted it.
"Tippy," Harry called.
"Is a celebration," Yule declared. "Short celebration. Master Draco needs his sleeps."
"The blessing everyone's been hit with," Harry repeated. "It would have to be very old, wouldn't it? I mean, we know Dumbledore is the one doing it and he's been doing it for generations. Maybe since he was a young man, back in WWII. So it's old. It's not new. I mean, I don't know. Maybe the same principles apply, but what we're looking for is an old prayer, not anything new like you were talking about."
But his whole body shook. A fine tremor that made Draco's stomach clench in worry. Harry's hand tightened on Draco's. They'd still been down in the ward room when Grandfather Arcturus returned. Or, more accurately, Draco had been in the ward room. Harry had been outside of it, asking chirpy questions about the rune circles on the wall and pestering Draco to ask the ward stone all manner of odd questions about the Malfoy magic and history and what it thought of the whole soulbond thing between them.
It was different.
Having never been allowed to see Goblin magic before, Draco had no idea if these particular Goblin magi were exceptionally skilled or talented. He had to assume that they were. Silverclaw would never have allowed anyone who was under-skilled, uneducated, or lazy to touch Harry.
"Dinner is almost ready, Master Harry," Dobby exclaimed as he popped in. "Dobby has to make dessert yet. Roast is almost perfectly roasty."
"Ah, I should've known the two of you would come straight there," Grandfather Arcturus murmured. He opened his eyes and Draco flinched at the harsh silver light of his magic beaming out his eyes. "If I'd had a lick of sense, I'd have stayed at Black Manor until I had some control over myself."
It was Draco and he was it.
He straightened up, fingers tapping against the top of the battlements like Silverclaw would tap his claws against his obsidian desk when he was thinking hard. Draco waited, paying close attention both to Harry's determined frown and to the way his thoughts tumbled about in the bond. There wasn't anything distinct to focus on, just a rushing river of faces and emotions and memories until suddenly, boom, there was a clear, hard focus.
"Tell us about it," Grandfather Arcturus ordered. "The whole thing, everything you can share."
Despite his eyes being closed, light sparkled all around him. He was suspended on a sea of stars that shimmered and popped around him. Harry smiled as a plume of stars drifted away from his lips as he breathed out. It was like his breath had become the smoke and rising embers from a bonfire.
This time the ward display swirled into life with barely a touch of Harry's magic. Nice. It got easier the more you did it. He would have to spend some serious time with Draco practicing and learning just what his wards could do.
Nothing like family magic that felt like being wrapped in a big soft blanket and hugged until he wheezed. Or like family rings that resized automatically and merged together so that Harry had just one family ring with a crest that matched the one Dobby sported.
He sighed and opened his eyes. A gleaming image of a woman with ever-shifting hair and eyes the color of emeralds stood in front of him. Her dress was made of ivy and a cascade of water that faded into nothingness before it could hit the ground.
"In his bed every night…"
"Oh, Harry didn't do anything," Draco said. He sighed and shut his eyes again. "Goodness, that's just exhausting. How odd. I didn't take that long, did I?"
"Into the heart of darkness…"
"Ah, yes," Draco said, blushing for no reason he could figure out. "But. Well. At the end when I opened my eyes, I saw a woman over the ward stone."
Dobby popped in with clothes for Harry. Instead of waiting for Harry to strip down and change, Dobby snapped his fingers and swapped Harry's pajamas for the jeans, T-shirt, and casual open robe in sapphire blue that he'd chosen for Harry to wear.
Given how Father had ranted about Lord Black's refusal to recognize Draco as his heir after Sirius Black was thrown in Azkaban, Draco was astonished that Mother had managed to save anything from Lord Black. Father was always… had always been quite violent when confronted with things that he didn't like.
Harry grinned and laughed even though the bags under his eyes had bags. Across the kitchen, Dobby snickered as he scrambled eggs, fried bacon, made a hash full of potatoes, peppers, sausage and more onion than anyone could tolerate. And garlic. So much garlic.
Behind Dobby, Mother pursed her lips and shook her head sadly. Grandfather Arcturus looked dismayed, exhausted, and frustrated all at once. On the other hand, Amal had his head tipped to the side as he frowned at Dobby.
"Remus?" Harry asked.
Tippy's eyes filled with tears as Harry overwhelmed him by caring what happened to him. "Tippy will tell the others. We is not wanting to stay but had nowhere else to go."
Remus blew out a breath, shaking his head. "That's not true, Harry. You have to go back. It's the only place that you'll be safe from Death Eaters and You-Know-Who."
"You always sleep with Scabbers," Fred said. He shrugged. "We figured that someone'd named Scabbers "Peter" before you found him and that's what was setting off the map."
"Wow, big," Harry commented. "Right, so how's this work?"
"Yes," Grandpa Arcturus said slowly. He nodded hesitantly at first and then decisively once he'd thought about it. "That seems accurate."
"A pool," Draco said with a wry little smile. "A deep pool with a current under the surface that can't be seen until you sink down into it."
He leaned his forehead against the blond wood door, shaking. Father served that monster willingly. He had always served willingly. Maybe if Father had truly wanted the Dark Mark removed, Mother would have succeeded.
The stacks of junk? Draco really wasn't sure what was up with that. Off to the left was a stack of chairs that reached twelve, fourteen feet high. A lovely harp of gold stood near it, all but a handful of the strings broken. Someone had stacked books between cracked teacups and saucers to the right and a mountain of shoes of every era lurked next to neatly stacked lanterns on top of a battered old chest that was the proper size for Hagrid.
Harry stared at the stacks and stacks and stacks of books wondering just how they were supposed to find anything substantive about the twisted blessing that'd been used on all of them. Reading all of these would take years. Well, Hermione could probably tear through them in about two weeks, but she was off on holiday with her parents. And Harry wasn't sure he could trust her.
"Not nice," Harry said, pointing at the twins who froze. "Now I know why Ron eats that way if you literally snatch food out of his hands."
"It won't?" Harry asked, approval and amusement at Draco being sneaky coming through the bond even though his face was a study in beetle-browed confusion.
The elf's eyes wrinkled in a smile that didn't reach his lips. "Tippy wants to help. What can Tippy do?"
"This is… not safe," Draco finally whispered. He pulled back, holding Harry's hands like they were lifelines. "I really shouldn't go to the ward room alone."
Draco frowned at Harry, astounded that he'd realized that Dumbledore wasn't trustworthy. All last year, Harry seemed to be in Dumbledore's back pocket. Whatever Dumbledore said, Harry and his idiot friends sucked up willingly.
"Is Headmaster," Tippy said sadly. "We is not liking him, not trusting him, but we is not able to hurt him."
Harry blinked a dozen times, very fast, as Ivy stood back up and giggled at the two of them. "Phoenixes can be blue?"
"I think I needed you, too, Dobby," Harry said.
"How'd they hide?" Harry asked.
The bond that he'd glimpsed last night fluoresced into visibility. It was still so beautiful, shimmering and pulsing in time with their hearts which hammered away. Draco jerked as he realized that there was another presence in that bond, a grey, nasty horrible one that felt just like the monster that had tortured Father to death.
"Master can," Ivy agreed. She smiled at him. "We is all helping, Master. You is the Master now. You has magic and wards and us. We is going to be fine now."
Harry shook his head and ran on down the stairs. If there was a bit of warmth blooming under his breastbone to be compared to his mother, well, only Draco needed to know that.
"Mother, I'd like you to do the same with Blue," Draco said. He waved for Mother to stay and Professor McGonagall to join them instead. "You're my regent. You hold the power of the Malfoys right now. I can't use it. You're the key person right now so you have to stay safe."
"It shows in the behavior and the magic," Draco said. "Your Muggleborn friend Granger was definitely bullied viciously. She wouldn't be so determined to impress the teachers if she weren't. Your Weasley, though, he's not been abused or bullied. His magic is completely clear of any sort of abuse which only makes his behavior regarding Granger that much more appalling."
He put one hand on the top of the stack, one hand underneath, cupping Harry's hands. This wasn't going to be easy. It wasn't going to be safe, really. Draco would have to be in the ward room because that was the only place that he could work with wards. They didn't have the training to set up proper wards around the labyrinth so it would have to be the Malfoy Manor wards.
Harry frowned at the news, to him at least, that Draco was abused, too. He hadn't realized that. Draco had always acted so proud of his father and the Malfoy family that he'd assumed that Draco was spoiled rotten. Maybe he acted like his family was perfect so that no one would suspect how bad it was?
Draco blushed but when he turned back to Harry, Harry did look like he wasn't hurting so badly. The scar wasn't open at all. It looked bruised more than anything, not like it had been cut open again when the soul anchor was removed.
"Tonight?" Harry whispered, eyes shimmering electric green with his magic.
"Well, if my random thoughts are so darn powerful," Harry said, chin on Draco's shoulder and arms around Draco's waist, "are we sure that Dumbledore is actually Dumbledore? Who could he be if he weren't actually Dumbledore?"
"Dumbledore," Harry huffed.
"You're not going to listen to me," Harry said with a shrug, "so I figure you need Professor McGonagall to tell you that you're wrong."
"I won't," Draco promised. "I just… I'm so tired. And so hungry. And it all weighs so much!"
"I ah, just remembered that I might be engaged to Pansy," Draco said.
At least he understood how important a secure base was. Draco hadn't had to explain it to him.
Every single thing that could have been done wrong had been done wrong.
Or which represented any level of disapproval.
Of course, he'd never stayed awake for a full twenty-four hours after killing his father, taking the Malfoy magics and saving his mother before. Oh, and discovering that he had a lifebond in his supposed worst enemy and that the man everyone regarded as the Leader of the Light personally wanted to destroy both Draco and Harry.
"Um, no," Harry said and then grinned as Dobby perched in the other chair and wiggled proudly as he straightened his uniform. "I haven't gotten any letters from you. I don't think my aunt and uncle have, either."
He caught Draco's hand, sucking in a breath when the contact abruptly calmed his racing heart. Draco's eyes went wide as he sagged a little, fingers so tight around Harry's hand that it hurt. Okay, so yeah, the wards were absolutely doing something to them. Dumbledore might be aware of them.
He was quite aware that he was shaking with fury. He just wasn't sure how to stop being so angry that he wanted to go set his relatives, Draco's relatives, and Dumbledore on fire. Preferably from the inside out so that they couldn't stop it.
The battlements felt different this time. Not only because of the war wards but also because deep grey clouds had blocked out the sun. The loch looked dangerous far below. Wind whipped through the pine trees, stripping away needles as Draco watched. A storm was coming, rain slashing downwards off to the east. It wouldn't be long before it arrived to drench Potter Keep.
Draco stared, mouth open, and then shook his head. He tentatively put his hand out, hovering over Harry's for a long moment before Harry nodded that yes, it was okay to touch. Hopefully. Harry really wasn't sure what would happen.
Harry's heart pounded as he stared at Dobby. The little creature stared right back, a mixture of sly determination and fear twisting his ugly face into a mask. It was the trembling ears that gave away the fear. Not the smirk or the narrowed eyes or even the way that Dobby held himself as if ready to leap away with the letters he'd stolen from Harry all summer long.
For one wild, terrified moment, all Draco wanted to do was run away.
"How long until noon?" Harry whispered. His fingernails were glowing, faintly, like he'd painted them with phosphorescent paint.
His magic saw.
No magic remained in Father's bedroom.
"You fell asleep," Draco said, patting Harry's side and relaxing under his grip, "Grandfather sent messages to Gringotts and the Department of Mysteries, and a blue phoenix is waiting to talk to you."
Amal nodded. "Yeah, that sums it up. So…?"
The bond opened up to Harry as he shut his eyes and focused on Draco. It was so much easier to find Draco now. Not just because the warped blessing was gone, but because of what they'd done last night. The wild, pure magic that'd flown through the two of them had done something nice to open their bond and deepen it. He could feel Draco's worry and fear.
As warm as a mother who screamed for her sons, restrained at the edge of a ritual circle overgrown with moss and flowers and grass and weeds.
"I have Voldemort in my head?" Harry squeaked and wow, no amount of deep breathing was going to calm him down. His armchair shook with the force of Harry's trembling. And from his magic swirling around him and Amal.
This one was wood, just common, ordinary wood like any other door in Hogwarts. The brass doorknob was bright and shiny like it had just been installed. Harry stared at it, stomach churning.
"You could do with some healing too," the healer commented.
"Ivy." Draco held his breath and then blew it out a moment later when Ivy, his personal elf, appeared in front of him.
"I agree," Draco said.
Draco nodded while trying not to laugh. "Good plan. Do you agree, Harry?"
Remus growled. Frowned. Snarled and then threw his head back to pant and shudder.
"Lady Magic," the twins said along with Harry and Draco who'd moved, somewhen while Draco's mind was off in the Forest, so that they stood on opposite sides of the altar just as Fred and George stood on opposite sides of their old, worn, moss-covered altar.
Their bond pulsed, color shifting between Malfoy blues and Harry's greens.
The Dark Mark was gone.
But no.
"Can we get to the ward room through the secret tunnels?" Draco asked the twins.
"I wanted to stay in the cell," Remus said, rubbing his chest. "It wasn't… They said no."
"You know not one single thing about wards, do you, Potter?" Draco said with a tired sigh and a little smile far too wry for his narrow face.
Harry nodded as he bounced to his feet. "So your bed or my bed? Because seriously, it's way late. I'm normally in bed by nine and we're past that now."
Draco closed his eyes and sighed.
"Breathe," Amal told Harry. "Come on, Harry. Breathe for me. Breathe for him. The stronger you are, the stronger the magic will be. Breathe. Count for me. Count to four. In for four, out for four."
An hour and a half later, after lots of cursing, lots of spells and tests and Silverclaw gouging furrows in the stone of the fireplace surround and then fixing it with his fingers alone, Harry had Dobby bring them all treats. Hot chocolate for him and Draco. Drinks of a bunch of different varieties for everyone else. Silverclaw's drink was on fire.
They paused before stepping down into the center of the auditorium where Dumbledore's horrible altar, bubbling potion and butcher's table waited. Harry hissed because there was a black, glowing labyrinth carved into the stone floor surrounding the altar setup.
"That's worth getting up for," Remus muttered without budging at all.
Harry sat on the bench outside of Remus' cell. The stone wall behind him was cold enough that goosebumps covered his arms. He didn't move. Not when Draco had fallen asleep with his head on Harry's shoulder. That was absolutely the most precious thing in the entire world and no way was he going to stir.
"Mhm," Harry agreed, eyes locked on the sweat dripping down Remus' face and his desperate panting. "Wanted to help so bad but it was just not gonna happen when it was placed with, wow, so much anger and, you know, malice."
True. She would. Draco still had to struggle to kick the stupid slippers off. He latched onto Harry's wrist, keeping him from pacing around the room. It took a good bit of mumbling and tugging but eventually Harry gave in and curled up in the bed with Draco.
Hermione's warm brown cheeks went pale enough that Harry pushed her over to one of the squashy sofas. She collapsed onto it, clinging to Harry's hands. Her teeth were chattering, dramatically chattering, and her hands were like ice.
"It would probably help Mother, anyway," Draco said. "When Father died, he'd just finished torturing her until she passed out."
"Okay, so Sirius is, what forty? Fifty?" Harry asked.
The altar screamed and screamed and screamed.
The ring stopped buzzing and flashing and poking at Harry now that it had his attention. The name wasn't Dumbledore. It wasn't even Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore. Harry frowned as he turned to Draco who looked absolutely baffled.
Harry flinched and turned away. When he turned back, Remus was face-down on the cell floor, groaning.  After a second, Remus flopped over on his back with an exhausted whine that would've done any wolf proud.
"You're sure?" Draco asked.
It shattered against a shield, but Dumbledore stumbled.
Professor McGonagall stood next to him; the next book clutched to her chest. She looked impatient, not worried, or afraid. Harry wasn't sure he'd ever seen Professor McGonagall look afraid, not even when the Weasley twins got up to one of their really horrendous pranks.
"That's fair," Harry said.
Harry's eyes burned. He never stayed up this late. This early? Aunt Petunia always worked him so hard that he dropped to sleep the instant his head hit the pillow. He'd never in his entire life stayed up until the early hours of the morning.
"Give us your aid. Help us purify Magic. Let us bring the Light of Hope into the Heart of Darkness."
He froze, then cursed under his breath.
Harry snorted and then laughed despite everything. "He can be a bit enthusiastic. But I like it."
Magic flared around Harry. Bright celadon green edged with lemon and swaths of forest green shot outwards as Harry's magic shoved at the soul anchor in his scar. His hands clenched into fists on his knees which drew up towards his chest.
He nearly fell flat on his face.
Draco made his way to the floo room, completely unsurprised when Ivy appeared with his best semi-formal robe, the open front dove-grey one with the silver-thread dragon embroidery around the collar. When Mother apparated into the floo room, she was wild-eyed but very respectably dressed in a gorgeous silver and green gown, an emerald robe and her hair pinned up with some beautiful old combs decorated with narcissus that Draco had never seen before.
Draco made his way down to the wardroom, not surprised that Ivy popped in when he approached the ward stone. No sign of blood remained. Ivy smiled and nodded once, firmly, when Draco patted her shoulder in thanks.
"I'm going, I'm going," Harry said with a nervous laugh that he cut off immediately because he could feel it sliding right towards tears and panic attacks that he couldn't afford right now.
"Mistress' elf Blue can ease her sleep," Ivy suggested. "Blue does so many, many times. Will keep Mistress asleep."
"What are we missing?" Draco asked.
The closer he got to the entrance, the more nervous he got.
He popped back out, the quietest pop that Harry had heard out of Dobby yet. Then a moment later Draco and Ivy popped in with Dobby by their sides. Draco immediately grabbed Harry's hands, clinging to him and shuddering.
Draco braced himself, gripped the wards firmly, and then wobbled his way forward to open the doors to Father's office. Father had, of course, claimed as his office a room with big double doors of carved ebony. The snakes that ran around the edges of the door's panels had all been given emeralds for eyes. They glittered like a real snake's eyes as Draco pushed the doors open.
"Well, what are ye waiting for?" Professor McGonagall demanded. "Open up another of these cells and put me in it. I'll not allow anyone to control me, not now that I know. Ye cannae let me go and ye cannae trust me to run free. In the morning, the goblins can work on me just as much as poor Remus."
Draco caught her hand, kissing the palm. It made Mother's breath catch and tears well up in her eyes. Fortunately, it also calmed her dramatically.
This was not a normal time.
They both launched into action.
"I'd have to do a great deal of work to ensure that Dumbledore couldn't enter Malfoy Manor," Draco mused. "I requested the Goblins to rework the wards so that they would exclude anyone touched by the Dark Lord's magic and by Dumbledore's magic but they're not going to get that done until later in the month. It's quite complicated spell work with a lot of preparation to be done."
Together, they raised their heads once more and smiled into the wild, beautiful sea of stars that was Lady Magic herself.
"Is, Master," Ivy agreed. "But Master must hurry. Before old Master Lucius passes out."
Just a little longer.
She looked down at the dirt smudges, green streaks across her skirt and sleeves and then raised an eyebrow at him. Her hair was dark again, fully dark instead of partially spelled blond to suit Father's idiotic insistence that everyone wearing the Malfoy name had to have blond hair.
Ivy leveled a stern glare at Dobby who pouted. "Ivy is staying. Dobby is going. We is agreeing on this already. No take-backs!"
No response.
Everything hurt. Every single inch of his body ached. His hair hurt. How could his hair hurt? That was ridiculous.
"Again!" George shouted.
Forest.
"It's Father's office," Draco corrected. "The artifacts in there are… They're vile. I'm using the wards to keep them from causing problems. I'm afraid it's taking all I have to keep… a specific one… under control."
"Oh, stop fussing, Potter," Draco huffed. "Don't play with your food. It's terrible manners."
Draco's POV:
After Draco finished unpacking, he decided he was thirsty. He went downstairs and Harry was in the kitchen. Draco snuck past Harry and went to grab a bottle of water. Harry turned around and went to grab something.
- End of chapter three
"Here's what I propose. You should live with me Draco. I bought a flat right outside of wizard London. You can stay with me until you get back on your feet." Harry proposed.
Draco looked shocked. He hadn't expected to be kicked out of his own house. Apparently, Narcissa was thinking the same way, as she got up and started screaming.
"Then you can get out of my house." He snarled.
"Here. You're washing the dishes all wrong. Let me show you." Harry whispered. Draco gulped.
"You've never deserved to be stuck on the streets," Harry mumbled.
Draco thought about this. He figured, it wouldn't be too bad to live with the boy who lived. But, he was also scared because he knew that Potter was the only thing that made him harder than hard, made him blush, which was usually impossible with his pale cheeks. He made him stutter and fidget.
"Well, mate, What do you think?" Ron asked.
2:34 a.m.
Harry fucking Potter was holding his hand and pulling him away from the Leaky Cauldron. He looked so determined, so cute. Draco tried to hide his blush.
"So, why did you bring me here, you ass?" Draco demanded.
"What? I-" Harry stuttered.
"What the fuck was that? Potter is straight, so why the fuck was he acting like that?" Draco paced around his room.
Hermione, as always, was trying to talk him out of doing something he'd set his mind on doing. No matter what she said, he wouldn't change his mind.
"I'm gay." He said.
Harry's POV
Draco instantly felt warm. There was a faint scent of Harry on the jacket. Butter beer, Mahogany from his broomstick, and a faint smell of strawberries were an amazing scent when put together. Draco could wear the jacket all day. Harry had other plans.
Draco's POV:
"No. I think I'm going to stay here and unpack my stuff. You guys can go, and I'll see you guys soon enough." Harry said.
"I'm f-fine Potter. I'm w-warm enough." said Draco, blushing profusely.
"That disgusting thing is no son of mine." he growled.
"Harry, if it's what you want to do, then I guess the only thing I can do is support you. I just need you to promise me that you will try to be careful. You've already died, twice. I don't know if I can hold myself together if you do it a third time." she said.
Draco looked shocked. How could the Boy Who Lived actually care about him? They had always been rivals. This was very strange.
A few months later, (i'm sorry) Harry had noticed a difference in his physique. He had become more muscular, he looked strong. His jawline looked better than ever, and he definitely had abs. They would show through his shirts no matter how hard he tried. Harry had been undergoing auror training, and this was a strenuous process. He had been doing workout after workout after workout. It had paid off. He was about to start his final month of auror training, which meant soon he would become a true auror. He got up and took a shower. Afterwards, he ate a small breakfast and left for training.
"Draco? What do you say?"
Guys I just want to mention that there will be a few chapters without smut and explicit content. We have to have that buildup okay? Please don't hate me. This is my first Drarry story so It probably won't be TOO long before smut, but I need to make sure it's not just smut. I want it to be an actual story. Just be patient, and Enjoy this, because the extra will make the story so much better to read and make it more interesting 😜
"I'm fine Potter! Leave me the fuck alone!" Draco spat. Harry looked almost as if he was, hurt? Then he grabbed Draco by the arm and started pulling him towards the Leaky Cauldron.
Harry's POV:
Draco paused. How the hell did he know that? It's not as if he was on speaking terms with the Malfoy's. There was no way. Almost as if he could read Draco's mind, he said, "You don't look like yourself. Your outfits are different. Plus, you seem like you're lost."
-Big time skip-
Harry unpacked his things carefully and put them away nicely. He hung up picture frames and put out furniture. He put his clothes in the closet in his bedroom. When he was done, he checked the time on his clock.
Draco's jaw dropped. He never thought he would see the golden boy again, but to be honest, he was hoping that he would. He noticed how gorgeous Potter was since the last time he saw him. He had definitely gotten hotter. His jawline was so sharp, and He looked so fit. Draco could see his abs through his shirt, which he thought was undeniably hot. Draco started blushing at the thought cursing through him. He wanted to slam Potter up against a wall and kiss him until his perfect lips were swollen and red. Draco composed himself. See, the Boy Who Lived was the reason Draco figured out he wasn't straight. During 4th year, there was the triwizard tournament. Harry's name somehow got dragged into the tournament, and Draco realized he was worried for
"And why in the name of Merlin would I do that?" Draco said.
His mother tried to stop him, but he had made up his mind. He quickly packed all of his things into his large hogwarts trunk, packed up his owl, Harley, and walked back down the stairs. His mother knelt, sobbing on her knees as he walked towards the door.
"So what if I am, Potter? Are you just telling me because you want to gloat?" Draco countered.
Harry, Ron and Hermione Drove to the outskirts of Diagon alley. They parked in front of a new, modern looking house in a small neighborhood. It was a muggle neighborhood, full of small children and young families. Harry was delighted to see the inside of his new house. One of the requirements of participating in Auror training was that Harry was to have a house in a muggle town. He knew that being an auror was a dangerous job which created numerous enemies, so he complied gratefully.
"Oh Draco, you must be cold! Here. Take my jacket." Potter said.
"No you're not. Your cheeks are really red and you're shivering. Here." He put the jacket on him.
"Mione, I'll be fine! Why do you have to worry so much?" Harry responded quickly as he packed up the last few boxes.
Hermione knew she had lost the battle, and hung her head sadly. She looked up and gave him a sad smile, and sighed.
As always, please be patient, because i do have things i have to do. But comment what you think, and I hope you enjoy!! Bai guys! 💕
Lucius Malfoy slapped him, hard, across the face. Draco had expected this. He knew his father was a pure blood at heart. He then looked over at his mother. Behind Lucius' back, she gave him a reassuring smile. "Thanks mother," he thought in his head.
Standing here now, Draco wishes that it could be that easy to tell his parents the truth. He heard them talking in the kitchen. They must have just apparated from Diagon alley.
- End of Chapter One.
"I-I don't really umm-" Draco stuttered. This was insane. Was this really happening right now?
Draco was shown to his bedroom, and he began to unpack his things. He loved the little blue room, and felt it matched him perfectly.
"Wait, what did I just say?" Harry thought.
"Seriously, What the fuck was that?" Draco kept saying to himself.
"Fuck." He said and crawled into bed, falling asleep instantly.
"Oh, cut the crap Malfoy. I can tell that you're no longer living in Malfoy Manor." Harry retorted.
"No."
"Are you sure you can do this?" Hermione asked gently.
Potter's safety. However, when he saw Potter on his broomstick during the first task, he couldn't help but blush. Potter was gorgeous, and Draco had woken up the next morning moaning, only to realize he had wet sheets. He had been dreaming about how he would feel if Potter came up to him, pinned him against the wall and-
"Fine then. I'll leave. I'm getting my stuff, and then i'm leaving." Draco said.
"Lucius, he's your son! How could you say that to him?" She yelled.
They ate dinner in silence, and all you could hear was the sound of scraping on plates. Draco helped clean up and wash dishes. Harry quietly came up behind him and put his hands in front of Draco.
The truth was, he had been hiding the truth about his sexuality since 4th year. Draco decided he didn't want to admit the feeling that he didn't care for girls. At one point, everyone in 5th year with him had believed that he was no longer straight. This is the reason he dated Pansy. He never liked her like that, and she understood. Pansy confided to him that she wasn't straight either. "I like girls Dray. I think I have my eyes set on a good one too." She had told him with a wink. He smiled and felt extremely relieved that she understood. She came up with the idea to pretend to date to get everyone off their trails. This worked tremendously. Not only had people believed their story, but Draco and Pansy had become better friends through it. Early in 6th year, they told everyone they were only going to be friends, but that hadn't stopped everyone from believing they were both straight.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Draco? We're home!" his mother called from the kitchen.
"I love you Mother, and I will see you soon." he whispered. She nodded. Draco opened the door. It was time that he start fresh.
"You know it's true Potter! You're just glad that I'm getting what I finally deserve!" he spat.
"You are not fine Draco. I am taking you to get a drink, my treat, and we are going to talk about this!" He whispered viciously into Draco's ear. This simple gesture sent a tingle down Draco's back, and he felt himself getting hard. Draco quickly tried to think about something else, which didn't work. Harry looked at him, and Draco prayed he didn't see what Draco saw. Harry looked away and pulled him into the Leaky Cauldron and out of the freezing cold.
Draco nodded slowly. "Given what we've found with Remus and Professor McGonagall, I wouldn't be surprised if she was profoundly cursed to obey, too."
He'd giggled about that so hard when Amal said it the first time. That had been when Silverclaw showed them into the Keep's wardroom and then keyed the wards to Harry in particular and Grandpa Arcturus as his backup. Amal got access to the keep but not to the wards. He wasn't family, really, though Harry sort of felt like he was.
"No, Master Draco," Ivy agreed. Her eyes were huge as she stared at him, huge and pale watery blue instead of the electric blue they would be if Father weren't so weak.
"Oh, you'll live, Lord Black," Fangtooth said with a snort. He waved one hand and diagnostic spells like the ones Madame Pomfrey used flashed into place above him. "You've a great deal of healing yet to do, but you'll live thanks to Mr. Potter. The Potter magic is what saved you."
"You're biting yourself!" Harry gasped. "That's what he's doing. It's not the blessing biting him. It's confusing things and you're biting yourself!"
Or making Harry do it.
Amal might be all right. He did have some of Dumbledore's magic on his soul but not like either Remus or Professor McGonagall. Actually, they all had some. Draco frowned, rubbing his chest as the wards tried to warn him of the magic deep inside of them.
"Of course," Draco agreed, amusement humming in their bond to match the little smirk on his lips. "What? You though they were piled like cord wood in here?"
"No, you can't," Draco said immediately. "The Weasley family are all huge Dumbledore supporters. They'd do exactly what he wants and not question it all, even if you swore up and down that you were in danger from their actions. Hermione? I don't know. Would she listen to you long enough for you to explain what's going on? Because my impression of her is that she makes up her mind and then won't budge."
"Ah, yes," Remus said. He rubbed the scars on his cheek and then shook his head. "Quite so. Good point, Harry."
"Your eyes are the same color as my magic?" Harry asked Dobby.
Which meant…
Mother stared at the letter, mouth open, and then flung it back to him. She apparated away, up to her quarters where the wards told Draco that she yelled for Blue to help her get cleaned up and changed immediately. Draco picked up the letter, let Vern read it, and then laughed as Vern set to work potting the plants that Mother had been working with while muttering about rude demands upsetting the poor baby plants.
The Dark Mark surged, exploding outwards to drive Draco away. Ivy's magic caught Draco before he could be flung into the wall. Barely. The surge still nearly knocked Draco out. He panted and struggled back to his feet, determined to try again if that was what it took to start another round of the Dark Lord's torture.
Enough that Draco was sure it would be inedible. Harry was full of anticipation for the hash. His hunger for it had Draco craving it even though he'd never been one for that much garlic. Or any garlic, really.
"I am your mother, Draco," Mother started to say. She stopped when Draco held up a hand.
And it made Harry feel bad for all the ways he'd poked at Draco last year. Still didn't feel a tiny bit of guilt for stealing Dobby, but he probably shouldn't have been such a prat to Draco. Even if he'd been a massive prat first. Several times.
A very strong one snapped into place around Father who still convulsed under the Dark Lord's torture. Not good. Very not good. The torture couldn't last too much longer, or Father might have a heart attack.
"Sorry, Malfoy," Moody muttered.
That magic clearly responded to faith and prayer wasn't going to make a dent in Hermione's firm rationality.
Lilac popped away. So did Cooper. Harry shook his head.
"Um, can you see that this gets to Bill Weasley, sir?" Harry asked Silverclaw.
There was magic. Dark and bloody and painful and twisted with hate.
"I promise," Draco said.
"Nope, we know," Harry said just as they found all the adults in the parlor looking at books. "Hey, the Wesley kids are here with Neville and Hermione. They don't know about the ritual we did."
Horribly frayed, patchy, with spots that looked barely a few threads while others were thicker, more robust but still the same bloodless silver as tendons that had been picked free from a piece of meat prior to cooking it.
"I'm halfway tempted to," Amal said, summoning law books and accounting books and history books off the higher shelves which all floated around him patiently. "This is amazing. Silverclaw said something about the audit pulling back all the entailed books that were taken elsewhere."
To Draco's relief, Dumbledore had not immediately come after them here in Potter Keep. He'd disappeared again, more than likely straight back to Hogwarts. No reason for him to give up his own fortress, especially not when he had the confluence of ley lines to pull power from.
The snap as Draco locked the wards down came at the same instant that he and Mrs. Malfoy flung themselves through the floo. Harry jerked, gritting his teeth, and refusing to let go of Draco, of the magic flowing through their bond, even as the waves of wild magic from the labyrinth abruptly cut off.
Dumbledore, fake Dumbledore, Grindelwald sitting in Hogwarts where the confluence of ley lines supported the magic of the castle, roared his fury at having his blessings destroyed. Released. Completed.
Despite the excitement and fear battering the bond, Harry nodded with the same determination he'd shown during the ritual to remove the Dark Lord's soul shard. Draco nodded back. His heart echoed with the refusal to give up that had gotten him through taking the elves and the Malfoy magic.
"Pretty much has to be," Draco agreed. He pointed at the ring that was flashing and rotating. "Touch that one and order it to identify who's attacking."
He could feel the bond tying Dobby. It led away, out of the house, somewhere else. It was weak and frayed and patchy like that two-inch thick nylon tow-rope Uncle Vernon had won at a work picnic that Dudley had unraveled into an enormous pile of white frothy thread.
For a moment, Draco felt the twins, too. The twins and Dobby and Ivy and Grandfather Arcturus who was up on one knee, shielding Remus and Professor McGonagall who were casting some sort of spell that he didn't recognize.
Harry started and stared at the window. Another shudder, more violent this time. Draco woke with a gasp, clutching his chest. Through the bond, Harry could feel the wards screaming that they were under attack.
"You've got the labyrinth," Harry agreed. He looked to the door of the ballroom and frowned. "Did Remus and Professor McGonagall get these books cataloged yet?"
"Oh, leave off, Ron," Mrs. Weasley huffed as she pulled her sleeve free. "I've told you and I've told you; Headmaster Dumbledore is certain Harry's quite safe. He can't take any mail right now. It's fine. Now, if we don't hear in a couple of weeks, yes, more forceful methods will be used. But it will not be something you're involved with, young man. You leave this to the adults, you hear me?"
"No," Harry said slowly, frowning almost as hard as Remus was. "I lived with them. Dumbledore placed me with them when my parents died."
Tomorrow.
Grandfather Arcturus breathed a laugh and nodded without opening his eyes. "Yes. Thank you, boys. You should… go study something. Else. For now."
Tears welled up in Dobby's eyes. He plopped down on the bare wood floors, too, clutching Harry's mail to his chest. In her cage, Hedwig chirruped as she tilted her head to the side until it was nearly upside down.
Harry shook his head. "No, I don't think we should. Look. The ritual is supposed to be a secret one. Says so right at the top. It's done quietly, in hiding, with no one the wiser until it's done. The more people who know, the less likely it is that it'll work."
He took a hesitant step closer to Harry, holding the letters out, and then skittered away again as if expecting a lunge. It was logical to try and grab them. To go for a wand, which Harry didn't have, to get them back.
Silence echoed.
"I think it is," Harry whispered. "I really do. It makes sense."
"Okay, so, let's go in the opposite direction," Harry suggested. "You're not like me or Draco or anyone else. You're you and you're unique and frankly, we shouldn't try to do things the same way for you anyway."
"How do we get in?" Harry whispered.
"Yes," Dobby agreed. "Master Harry's seneschal be here. Has suite here in Blackwell House. Dobby made sure. We is not added to the floo network, so we has to go in this way instead of easy way."
Next, he turned to Remus who stared at Draco as if he couldn't quite believe that he was standing there in Malfoy Manor trying to save the world. Which, fair. Harry couldn't quite believe even now that he was here with Draco and that so much had changed. It'd only been eleven days. Eleven short days full of way too much stuff happening.
"I'll take that as a yes then." Harry said with a smile, and with that, he grabbed his hand and led him outside again to begin their official friendship.
"Oi! You two! What the bloody hell is the holdup up there? Both of you need to hurry your asses up before you're late, Harry!" Ron screamed from downstairs.
"Yes," Draco murmured, putting all his hope and acceptance and resignation to that into the bond between them. "If that's what has to happen to save Potter, then I'm fine with it."
Harry grinned and went to his trunk. When he pulled out the invisibility cloak, Draco frowned at it as if Harry were being ridiculous. That lasted just as long as it took for Harry to sling it over his shoulders and cover his head. Then Draco gasped and stared at the spot where Harry had been.
"I can't believe this happened," Amal finally complained as Dobby refilled their tea and pushed the remaining three chocolate biscuits at Amal. "You've the worst luck I've ever seen, Harry."
Except that Draco's bond to Harry echoed with the fear and love and pain that reverberated between Harry and Dobby. They were so very close to each other, so deeply bound to one another. Willingly. They had chosen one another. Where Draco and Harry were soul bonded by Lady Magic herself, Harry and Dobby had chosen one another.
