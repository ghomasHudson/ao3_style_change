“No, no, Harry, that’s your business,” Hermione said, pausing beside the bed. “I just wanted to make sure that you were happy.”
Draco felt Pansy’s fingers wrap around his wrist, yanking his hand away from his face. He met her glare, surprised to see so much fury radiating within her hazel eyes.
Once he had convinced himself that it was alright to prefer men, Harry began reblogging more and more photos that involved half naked gorgeous men alone or with others.
Draco sighed aloud but minimised the window. He flicked his wand to admit Pansy who entered immediately, laptop clutched to her chest.
McGonagall’s eyes sharpened. “I requested no such thing. Be on your way, Mr Malfoy, you look in need of a good bed,” she said, started in the opposite direction down the corridor.
was why he looked so awful the next day,” she murmured, frowning at a particularly knotted floorboard. “If only I had known. I could have slipped him a blood replenishing potion.”
Potter had the good grace to appear sheepish and, while Draco was prepared for a growled threat in response, he was once again taken aback by the response.
“It is my pleasure, Mr Potter,” Khari responded. “And if it is not to bold of me, I daresay your new date is much more… appropriate.”
The blond kept his eyes closed but made sure he retained a pout on his lips as he allowed Potter to direct him forwards. He tried hard not to focus on how warm Potter’s hands were… nor did he consider how very comforting his touch was. The strength in Potter’s fingers alone definitely had
“I wondered what happened to that one,” Draco mused. “Father was hysterical for a month.” He glanced at the raven-haired-tiara-wearing young man beside him. “Father never did tell me what happened, how did you do it?”
Harry swung his gaze in the direction that Hermione was pointing and felt his mouth twist into a grimace. He shook his head rather adamantly at her, only slightly put-out when she pouted.
Surprisingly, Malfoy did so, gazing at Harry intently with his lips still quirked in a teasing smirk. The Gryffindor swallowed, ignored the abrupt flare of arousal, gripped his bag and shoved passed, his eyes fixed determinedly on the space before him.
“Whatever, when you stop being such a prima donna then we’ll talk,” Pansy sniffed, getting off the bed. “Seriously, Draco, you either stop moping to me about your fucked-up love life or you actually do something about it.”
“No, there’s something else I want to discuss with you,” Draco replied, placing his bag down on the wooden table-top and pulling out a seat.
Something hard, thick, and powerful knocked the wind right out of Draco without any preparation whatsoever. It slammed into him from behind and the blond flew forwards, hitting the ground with a bone shuddering crash despite the blanket of ice cold snow. Draco tasted blood as he rolled onto his back, staring up at what had attacked him. He looked up, alarmed, at the twisting sight of a massive tree implanted before him. The branches waved maniacally, surging through the air with powerful sweeps as the trunk curved, ready to attack Draco again. With a choked gasp, Draco rolled, narrowly avoiding a thick branch as it
“No, it’s alright,” Harry finally answered, returning his gaze to the female. “Is this your way of getting Malfoy and I back to together?”
Something fluttered onto the desk. Glancing down, Draco’s brow creased a little at the sight of a neatly folded piece of parchment. He threw a shrewd glance to the female sitting resolutely motionless at his side before he reached for it, his long pale fingers enclosing around the parchment and pulling it towards him, unfurling it surreptitiously.
The bushy-haired brunette had been shocked to receive an intense letter during the holidays. The contents of said letter was nothing compared to the surprise she had felt at the sight of the sender, however. One Pansy Parkinson, someone who had never failed to tell Hermione exactly what she thought of her, had written to her asking for the Gryffindor’s help. After the first few lines had been filled with an elaborate apology, the Slytherin had described a series of events that, even now, still had Hermione’s head in a whirl. Parkinson had admitted that she knew Hermione would be the best person to help them, but understood if the Gryffindor was apprehensive to do so.
He’d been shopping in muggle London with his mother who seemed quite taken with the jewellery they sold, when he’d passed by a store filled with strange gadgets. He’d stopped to have a closer look, nose crinkling at what the muggles had come up with. When he’d found the laptops, however, his face lost the look of pure distain and he began to look with earnest. It was when the cute sales assistant came forward, explaining which laptops were better and asking what sort of programs Draco was after that the blond found himself seriously considering buying one.
“Look, Ron...” Harry ran a hand through his head, wondering if he should tell his best mate. “I may have told Mione that you like her...”
“Just Cho Chang during fifth year,” Harry replied. “She didn’t really make it easy though—she was already upset over Cedric. We only kissed… but it didn’t feel right. Needless to say nothing ever came of it.” He bit his lip, glancing shyly at the boy next to him. “Considering our conversation has taken a personal turn, do you mind if I ask you something?”
The look of agonising hunger that had been etched on Malfoy’s face had burned itself into Harry’s memory. Malfoy’s eyes had been so desperate, wracked with a longing so deep the image still took Harry’s breath away.
“Well, aside from you hiding in your room in the dark sulking?” Ron replied with a crooked grin, coming over to sit on the edge of the bed.
Harry’s mind instantly quietened, body going entirely limp as Malfoy lifted his now sleeping mate into his arms. Draco gazed down at him in complete adoration. He had never felt closer to another male in his life. Shifting Harry in his arms, Draco held him closely, tenderly. Leaning down he pressed a lingering kiss to Harry’s warm forehead. At that moment, his and the brunet’s heart pumped as one. He could feel every breath Harry drew, every emotion that Harry felt.
“Well good, hopefully they’ll provide the answers we’re after.” Pansy flicked her hand in the direction of the classroom. “You can fill me in on what you’ve read so far before Binns arrives.”
“Haven’t most Professors adapted to receiving printed documents?” Harry asked, watching her closely.
“Uh, thank you?” Draco murmured, taking hold of the handle and lifting the cup awkwardly to his lips. He took a tentative sip before replacing the cup back onto the tray, trying desperately to hide the way his hands shook.
He smiled giddily at his slightly blurry reflection. Hell, even if nothing actually happened tonight at least Harry could be sure to plant the seed of interest. Malfoy may not even think of him in that way. Yet. Hopefully.
Cool, calculating grey eyes watched every movement a particular dark-haired Gryffindor made. Potter, at this point in time, was biting his lip, staring down at a roll of parchment resting on the desk before him. He was alone for the meantime; Weasley had disappeared within the rows of books in search for study material only moments before.
“He didn’t tell you, therefore I refuse to acknowledge it,” Draco said stubbornly. “I’m not going to allow myself to fall for a ploy—I will
Percy straightened pompously. “Ron, stand watch and inform me at once if there is the slightest change,” he ordered.
“I don’t know.” Hermione bit her lip. “I think we better though, just in case.” The brunette turned back around, reaching out a careful hand to shake her friend awake. “Harry?”
“Well come on or we’ll miss breakfast,” Hermione continued, gesturing towards to the Great Hall. She, Ron, and Harry were crossing the surprisingly empty Entrance Hall when a lone figure suddenly bumped into them.
“This will go great with your hair,” Harry smirked, picking up the tiara and turning it so it sparkled in the candlelight.
He flinched suddenly as an unexpected source of light fell across his face. He could hear the rustling of curtains and the smell of disturbed dust. Well, at least wherever they were, it apparently had windows. More rustling, the darkness ebbing away until Draco could tell he was practically bathed in sunlight.
Sliding his vision downwards, Harry indulged in the sight of Malfoy’s smooth pale skin. From the waist down, Malfoy was covered in his duvet but Harry could still recall
Hermione gazed at his screen, rolling her eyes at the many friend requests he now had on his Facebook. “Oh please, Harry, it could be worse.”
Percy’s clock-face coloured. “Er—w-well, yes, I s-suppose I do,” he spluttered. “I suppose a quick tour couldn’t hurt…”
With a groan Draco tossed back the duvet and swung his long legs over the edge of the mattress. The soft silk of his navy pyjamas brushed soothingly across his skin as he headed for the bathroom, the coolness of the tiles a welcome distraction as he took himself through his standard morning routine. He found that he was relying on the practiced movements to get him relieved and cleansed, especially since his mind insisted on being elsewhere. Before he knew it Draco was stepping out of the shower, freshly washed, and towel wrapped loosely around his hips.
Once he’d put enough distance between himself and Potter, Draco slipped out of sight down a deserted row of book shelves. He leant against one as he caught his breath, his mind a whirlwind.
While Draco wondered why the hell his inner voice sounded a lot like Pansy, the blond had gotten himself up off his bed and over to his wardrobe.
Shaking his head, Draco reached into his back pocket and pulled out his phone. He didn’t expect the guy to make a move immediately of course, but the blond couldn’t help but gaze down at the dark screen hopefully.
him once he learns the truth?” She could feel frustrated tears prickling at her hazel eyes and she roughly turned her head away, sucking in breaths as she waited for Granger to finally,
“I don’t know,” Hermione replied, just as softly. “I hope not.” She followed Ron back down the stairs, a niggling sense of concern refusing to go away.
“Just… don’t be too late,” Hermione said finally. “And don’t get caught! You’re the Head Boy, Harry, you’re meant to be setting an example.”
“Yeah.” Harry smiled crookedly. “Something like that.” He sipped his Firewhiskey, mulling over the questions running through his head. “So does this mean we can give the entire school a heart attack when they return?”
“Stop being such a melodramatic twat,” Pansy snapped. “You honestly have no idea how Potter will react to this. Given by what Granger has told me, I’m not entirely sure that Potter hates you.”
Everyone ounce of Draco’s being wanted nothing better than to thrust his best friend out of his way and claim the male that was his. He cared not for the room full of students; his craving for Potter outweighed the threat of witnesses. It was the last lingering thread of his humanity that stopped him, and he took a single step back, jaw locking and hands clenched at his side. Pansy kept her wand on him until Draco had slid back into his chair, eyes boring a hole into the desk before him. Mercifully, no one besides Pansy had noticed his abrupt change of character, which had been an added perk of their chosen position within the classroom.
“It’s what you do for an adopted brother,” Charlie had said with a smirk. “You’re the only one left without a partner.”
“I’m sure most of you will find using this new technology to be a fun and interesting experience,” Dumbledore continued. “There is much to be said for embracing new ideas; please do not fear that you will be unable to understand how a computer laptop functions. There are many students here already equipped with knowledge on how to use them and I am sure they will gladly help anyone who needs a hand.
Before Draco could even blink, he felt his body being shoved away from the wand, the case slamming down over the top so brutally the glass cracked. The blond stumbled, feeling his heart begin to thump as his eyes landed on Potter’s enraged form.
“It does not worry me,” he voiced, quirking an eyebrow at the wardrobe where both faces grinned in response. “If you would be so kind as to direct me to the bathroom I will endeavour to be quick.” His mind was already working on spells that he could use on his currently clothing—would it be too inappropriate to simply spell the clothes he was wearing clean? At least until he could work out how he was to gain his own wardrobe?
“No really, a picnic will definitely show Mione I like her,” Ron beamed. “She loves it when you go out of your way to do things.”
Malfoy waved a hand dismissively. “Call it what you want. Go get your homework and I’ll meet you in my room.”
Pansy frowned as she crossed Draco’s bedroom, coming to sit beside him on the bed. Despite the room being cast in shadow, Draco’s skin seemed to glow, his eyes illuminated against the darkness as he turned to face her. Alarmed by the desperation on the blond’s face, Pansy broke the silence, suddenly frightened of her best friend’s answer.
“When you run out of downloads—so when your internet stops working—you’ll need to go and buy some more,” Draco finished. “Most of the devices are reasonably priced; some are more expensive than others though. I use a turbo one which provides me with faster internet but I paid more for it.”
Dropping his bag to the floor, Ron left the two in the dark room and rushed down the stairs. Hermione closed the door behind him and made her way back to Harry’s bedside. She placed her wand aside, still lit, and sat on the bed, laying a comforting hand on Harry’s hair.
Draco moaned a laugh, his eyes opening and he stared down at the Gryffindor. He wanted to say something snarky, something clever. Instead, he murmured words that surprised even him.
“Of course not.” The red-head scowled. “You can be damned sure I’m going to have some words to the Ferret. Probably a hex or two while I’m at it.”
A blush tinged her cheeks. “Because,” she started. “Because—ugh, Harry, we’ve been over this. I don’t even know if he actually like me.”
“Well it hasn’t been for that long,” Harry replied awkwardly. “I started thinking I might like guys during the summer holidays but I... I wondered if it might have been a phase or something. Since finding Tumblr though, I know now that I really do prefer males.”
“I can’t see that happening any time soon,” Draco retorted. “What Potter and I have at the moment is probably nothing more than lust. We find each other physically attractive.”
Harry growled in frustration and waved an impatient hand in Ron’s direction. “Obviously you weren’t paying attention,” he said grouchily.
“A username is what you use when you make an account on different things,” Harry explained. “It’s basically the name to your account.”
“Indeed? So that hasn’t been you avoiding me for the past two days. Or you ducking out early with some ridiculous excuse every time we’ve been together. Not to mention the absurd way in which you have been avoiding even
With a silent curse he looked away, grateful for the distraction as Profession Snape stalked into the room. Obsidian eyes swept across the class, lingering for a split second on Draco who met his stare steadily.
Well we're almost there!! Thank you to everyone who has stuck with me through the process of this story. It the very first multi-chaptered fic I have ever posted to the public. Thank you for all of the wonderful comments and support that egged me on! <3
Voldemort stared at the young Malfoy, his interest in Draco not going amiss by the blond. “Join me, Draco. If your talents exceed your reputation, then you shall make a fine addition to my side. You belong here with me; it is your responsibility as a Malfoy.”
And Harry did so, lying on his stomach without a second thought. The gentle caress of the white rug felt wonderful against his heated skin and he sighed, feeling his lover’s hands run themselves soothingly down his back as Draco’s body moved, fitting in between his parted thighs.
Harry’s hand began to stroke faster as his imagination began to take over. He pictured Malfoy leaning closer, mouth parted slightly and his hot breath ghosting over the head of Harry’s cock. Harry whimpered softly, watching in his mind’s eye as Malfoy’s tongue flicked out, tasting the leaking pre-come that glistened on Harry’s head. Soft supple lips enclosed over the swollen end, a teasing tongue swirling deliciously over Harry’s sensitive skin.
Harry glanced longingly up the staircase. He had hoped to escape to his dormitory before Malfoy hunted him down. No such luck.
Harry had his parchment book open and leaning against his legs, back pressed up against the tree trunk and pencil moving carelessly. He wasn’t paying much attention to what he was drawing but he liked the way the patterns swirled down the side. A laugh from Hermione had his gaze moving and he smiled at the easy way Hermione and Ron seemed to be talking.
… Perhaps the combination of quidditch and seventh year was not a good arrangement. How on earth had Wood managed?
The blond immediately fell silent, bowing his head once more. “My apologies, my lord. I will go the castle as you request.”
Distracted as they were, Draco couldn’t help but pause, his gaze flicking back up to the dark corridor. As the two objects marched away happily, the blond slipped silently back up the stairs, curiosity
disappointed when Malfoy hadn’t invited him back to his room after dinner but he’d figured that the Slytherin had as much homework as he did.
Safely ensconced within Harry’s room, Ron turned expectantly to his best mate, folding his arms tightly across his chest.
“I completely understand if you’re upset with me,” she said. “But I want you to know that I’m okay with it—you and Malfoy that is,” she continued gently. “I know Malfoy a little better now and I—I may have already been attempting to get you together.”
Did he really seem that peaceful? Nobody but Pansy had ever seen through his mask before and yet Potter had captured such happiness and even some vulnerability in just a simple expression. Draco wasn’t sure whether he liked this look or if it showed too much weakness.
“You rocked today, Harry,” he smiled, swinging his broom onto his shoulder. “We kicked Slytherin’s butt.”
“So I am,” Draco said with a wry smile. “From what could have been a miserable experience though, has turned out to be not so bad.”
Shovelling some scrambled egg into his mouth to prevent his snort, Draco forced himself to focus on his breakfast and
“They would be so lucky,” Draco retorted, lifting himself up enough to gaze down at the dark-haired male in adoration.
“Of course you do.” Severus rolled his eyes, waving a hand in the direction of his private storeroom. “You know where they are.” He returned to his screen, adjusting it to his preferred position. Draco was curious as to what it was the professor was so interested in but he decided against snooping. If caught, he didn’t want to imagine the sort of horrible thing he’d see… or his godfather’s reaction.
,” Malfoy gasped as Harry tilted his hips, rubbing his erection against the Slytherin’s own. Malfoy’s breath shuddered, hot air gusting across Harry’s throat.
“H-Harry—what—you shouldn’t be here.” Malfoy groaned, his body trembling from the effort of holding back. “Please—just
“Oh, shove it up your arse, Malfoy,” Granger interrupted good-naturedly, “and listen for once in your life. You’ve been exceptionally lucky, finding your blood-mate within the confines of Hogwarts. Even if I did buy your ‘
With her homework done for this evening however and the weekend the next day, Hermione saw no reason why she couldn’t spend most of her night doing what she loved.
“Dean Thomas? From school?” Harry’s head swung around, trying to catch sight of their old school-mate as the male disappeared into the crowded street. “I wonder what got him so riled up?”
Despite his reassurances, his mother did not look entirely convinced and if Draco was honest with himself, even he found it hard to truly believe his own words.
“Stretching?” Potter asked with a gasp as Draco’s hand trailed enticingly around his fresh erection.
“I—I—” Lucius stammered. Fear like nothing he’d experienced was growing inside him—not even the Dark Lord instilled terror to this extreme.
“You’re a bloody idiot, Draco,” Pansy continued then, her tone slightly softer now, “and you better fix this, so help me.”
The oily haired professor could not be seen, yet Draco could hear signs of life coming from another room. The door was ajar, revealing a strip of light and the tell-tale clicks of fingers against a keyboard to filter through. With a roll of his annoyed silver eyes, Draco marched to the door, pushing it open.
“Not really, no,” Malfoy said airily, brushing snow from his shoulders. “Perhaps you could provide some insight?”
Malfoy quirked his head to the side, analysing his mate as a small simmer of curiosity began to burn within him. “Was there something in particular you wanted to talk about?” he found himself asking.
“I knew it,” she breathed, admiring the way Harry had captured Malfoy’s… pleasant side. She’d known that Harry was up to something every time she caught him sneaking out. She’d taken to heading upstairs to his dormitory, finding his map and tracking his footsteps. The first time she’d seen his name alongside Draco Malfoy’s she’d been shocked until she noticed that they weren’t actually close enough to be talking or fighting or
Draco laughed softly. “Just you wait, Potter, it gets much better than this.” As if proving a point, Draco pulled back a little, swallowing a moan as he slid back in, but satisfied when Potter shivered enticingly beneath him. He repeated this motion, drawing further and further out each time. He thoroughly enjoyed the way Potter’s breath hitched each time he thrust inwards and it wasn’t long before Draco was moving powerfully, sweat glistening on his skin from exertion while Potter whimpered and gasped beneath him.
“I’m going to fetch Madam Pomfrey,” Hermione declared. “Don’t move!” She rushed towards Pomfrey’s office, leaving Harry to continue waving his fingers in front of his eyes.
“Don’t you think I know this?” He pushed his hands through his hair, fingers tightening in the blond strands.
“Yeah, mate,” Ron chimed in, “except you promised I could get in at least one hex, yeah? Since he acted like a dick before.”
Eli was turning a petulant frown towards whoever it was that had spoken, when his face dramatically paled. He slipped off the stool immediately.
Draco looked away from the gaping man in front of him. “I can’t continue a relationship when the things that are important to me mean nothing to you.”
be pleasantly surprising? That Potter and I will just suddenly stop hating one another? That Potter would willingly become my blood donor? I have a feeling he’d rather stake me through the heart.”
Ron’s relief was obvious and Harry rolled his eyes, wondering when the universe had swapped his friends for morons.
Harry exhaled. “Because I asked them to,” he admitted. The wine had loosened his tongue enough that he did not feel embarrassed about confessing. “I was getting sick and tired of the constant stream of bedwarmers. Anonymous sex is all well and good but it’s not something I wish to continue.”
the castle. He recalled leaving the manor with the intent to explore the school… but the next thing Lucius knew, he was entering the front doors of him home, knowing he was required to report to the Dark Lord.
But Ron was already shaking his head. “No, no, no, this doesn’t make sense,” he babbled. “How the hell could Malfoy be a vampire?”
Moving his gaze away, Harry studied the landscape for some inspiration for his next drawing. His eyes drifted over smiling students and gently swaying trees until an unfamiliar laugh had him searching across the field.
“He’d like that,” Hermione smiled gently. “The only thing I can imagine him doing is being mad at you for not telling him sooner.”
“Alright, fine.” Draco drummed his fingers on the table top, gaze falling to his laptop. “I have things to do anyway.”
He knew there was no reason to be, Malfoy had just invited him over so they could talk some more—right?
Harry swallowed, lowering his gaze to stare at the ground. “I know, Ron,” he whispered. “I know all of this. Why do you think I’ve wanted to avoid Malfoy? I’m still trying to work out whether what I feel for him is actually me… or the bond.”
The blond lowered his cutlery. His eyebrows pulled together, creasing his brow as he gazed at Potter expectantly.
Sorry not sorry for the cliff hanger :D this story is now up-to-date with where I'm at with writing it. I promise to try and not keep you guys waiting for long but at the moment life is pretty hectic. <3 <3
“I assumed he would remember!” he protested. “I was so desperate for him—and I thought he was too. He responded to me, Pansy, and I just lost myself in the moment—”
For the first time since coming to terms with his sexuality Harry was truly content. Hell, if Malfoy of all people could go out of his way to make Harry feel better about himself then why shouldn’t he be happy for a change? He couldn’t help the way he felt, he couldn’t help that he was attracted to males and it wasn’t his fault.
Draco felt himself grow still. “Truthfully?” he began, lifting his gaze until he was staring at his mate. The brunet held his stare, green eyes filled with the need to be reassured, to
“Thank god,” Hermione said, placing her head in her hands. “I really didn’t want to believe that Malfoy had messed with Harry on purpose. I mean… look at what we saw this morning, Ron. I’ve never seen Malfoy look so angry before and to actually
Harry snorted. “Excuse me for noticing the one thing you seemed to love aside from potions,” he replied. “You love trying to upstage me and I know you love flying—why did you stop?” The brunet watched as a hint of sadness appeared in Malfoy’s face. He barely had time to make sense of this when Malfoy had slipped his usual mask across his features.
“Whether I can blame it on the wine or not, I’m finding myself actually enjoying this conversation,” Malfoy smirked.
Lucius lifted his head and met the burning gaze of the Dark Lord and immediately, the blond felt an immense pressure crowding his mind. Knowing at once what it was his lord was after, Lucius lowered his mental shields, allowing Voldemort full range of his inner most secrets and memories.
“Why? I know the type of person you are, Harry. I should have realised your feelings sooner rather than delude myself that you could possibly be alright with what I did,” the Slytherin explained patiently. “I can’t say I wouldn’t have done the same if I had been in your position.”
“Whatever you added to Harry’s cauldron the other week reacted with the ingredients and fixed Harry’s eyesight,” Hermione explained carefully. “If you hadn’t meddled with his potion, he’d still have glasses.”
as they gawked. Draco watched as his lips parted slightly, the muscles beneath his skin rolling as his swallowed.
“Get your homework. Loathe that I am to admit it but you are far more capable at Potions than you let on to be and I refuse to associate with anyone who rejects their mental capabilities.”
“This conversation just became even stranger.” Harry pulled an undignified face. “How on earth would Malfoy know anything about laptops?”
It was with almost uncanny awareness that the blond knew the exact moment Potter walked into the room. He stiffened, forcing himself to not look at the dark-haired Gryffindor despite how much his body suddenly began to hum, urging him to be near Potter. He did not know why it was he was so tuned into Potter’s presence but it needed to stop.
“Draco’s the only person capable to ignore your stubbornness and push your grades higher,” Pansy commented.
By this time, even Hermione was beginning to get a glazed look in her eyes as she stared at their teacher. Harry was amused to note when she finally gave up and decided to browse her dashboard as well.
“What’s this?” Hermione’s voice joined them as the bushy-haired brunette sat across from them at the table, her eyebrows raised.
“Not the red-head, you idiot! The guy next to him!” Pansy reached over and began tugging excitably on the blond’s shirt sleeve.
“If you say so,” Pansy said wryly. “Just don’t be surprised, alright? You don’t know Potter very well, neither of us do. And you never know,
A thin piece of wood was quickly levelled between his eyes and Draco’s instincts abruptly flared, a snarl curling at his lips at the unanticipated threat. He glared threateningly at the female who, despite the fear she felt bubbling in her stomach, held his gaze.
The brunet shoved the concept out of his mind. He was tired from practice and the headache, which had been hanging around since his run-in with the blond earlier that same day, was flaring up again.
“And you’re doing a good job,” Hermione sniffed from beside him. “I can’t believe how fast this flu has spread.”
“Has this become a new thing for you?” Harry commented as he entered Malfoy’s room, staring pointedly at the fact that the Slytherin was once again seated on the ground.
Silent and almost student free was how Pansy loved the library and she found herself a quiet little corner where she would hopefully not be disturbed.
Harry rolled his eyes. “I don’t think he knows what happened,” the brunet muttered. “He’s become obsessed with his laptop. Didn’t look up once.”
“And that’s it for now,” Draco finished. “I’m having too much fun with this to have you accidently get ahead of yourself and blab something.”
“Aside from my uncertainty about dating a vampire?” Harry found himself saying before he could stop himself. He wasn’t surprised when Ron rolled his eyes.
“Obviously,” Harry moped, following the peculiar Slytherin out of the library. “So why the sudden urge to be outside?”
one—but don’t we all? I mean you’ve forgiven me quite a few times… it seems only fair you should forgive your—ugh dare I say it—
“Would you just tell me what you want already?” Potter questioned impatiently, jerking his arms into a defensive fold against his chest.
As the Dark Lord neared, Draco rose to his feet. He met the gaze of the male as Voldemort paused before him, the smile on the Dark Lord’s face growing into something positively wicked.
Despite the victory he had had with avoiding Potter in person, it had not prevented his deceptive mind from teasing him viciously with dreams, tantalising visualisations, and pure erotic fallacies.
Draco thought, nearing the case. It stood on an awfully damaged bedside table by the very edge of the large window, spinning so painfully slowly it was hypnotizing to watch. He reached out an inquisitive hand, fingertips brushing lightly down the cold glass. He couldn’t help but notice that the wand seemed to be in disrepair; it had begun to flake, bits of wood peeling down the elegant sides, some splintered pieces already littering the table top. Lifting aside the case, Draco leant closer, wondering why on earth Potter had—
Harry’s mind had gone completely blank. Malfoy’s presence overwhelmed him, the simmering flame of arousal growing so potently it seemed to spread beneath every inch of his skin. Harry’s breath hitched and he bit his lip as he felt Malfoy’s tongue glide languidly up his throat. Delicate and yet powerful fingers gripped his jaw, turning his head to the side and exposing his neck. Malfoy’s other hand was busy undoing the brunet’s trousers, slipping beneath the material and beginning to rub Harry’s growing erection.
Pansy sighed audibly, sinking back into the pillows on Draco’s bed. The blond decided to ignore her for now, focusing instead on the essay McGonagall has assigned them the other day. Seriously, all this talk about Potter and feelings was extremely distracting, why on earth did Pansy think he’d want to know?
Ron glanced over in the direction his best friend had been staring in only moments before. “Uh huh,” he offered with a small grin. “Hey, have you finished that essay McGonagall gave us?”
Hermione still looked doubtful but Harry was determined to get his best friends together. They deserved to be happy.
And there Draco was, sharing smirks and quips, touching the brunet, speaking to him, acting as if nothing had happened. And it
Another whimper from Harry caused Draco’s cock to twinge again. God, he was ridiculously hard just from listening to the beautiful sounds the brunet made. Reaching down, his quickly unbuttoned his own trousers, hand diving quickly beneath his boxers to grip his own erection. He moaned around Potter’s cock, causing the brunet to jerk. Draco stroked himself with each bob of his head, taking Potter’s erection deeper each turn. The Gryffindor was emitting delicious gasps and pleading moans, his fingers tightening in Draco’s hair to the point of pain.
Draco immediately blanched and withdrew the finger that had been pointing at Potter’s chest. Hand trembling slightly, the blond wrapped his arms around his stomach as a wave of unsettling insecurity crashed over him. His heart was thumping painfully in his chest as he forced himself to maintain eye contact with the brunet before him.
When lips enclosed around the head of his impatiently twitching cock, Harry threw his head back against the wall, a moan vibrating his throat. Draco’s mouth was so warm… so
“My question was rather personal,” Potter replied, staring at his hands. “I should have been more considerate—”
The dark-haired male suddenly surged to his feet, his robes billowing angrily as he began to pace. Lucius remained where he was, eyes trained on the floor as he listened to the rustle of Voldemort’s movements. Sweat trickled down the back of his neck, his heart pounding in his ears.
The information had been shared though; Parkinson now knew as much about Harry as he did about her. He wasn’t sure whether he liked or even understood this new friendship with the Slytherin but until his mind settled he’d just have to accept it.
Potter however had become a sort of game, wherein both he and Pansy had placed themselves strategically in the best possibly place for limited contact with the Gryffindor. This included avoiding all open windows.
“Of course, Harry,” Hermione replied, her smirk morphing into a gentle smile. “I hope, for your sake, that everything works out.”
Dazzling green eyes met with grey once more and Draco was surprised to note the way the brunet’s cheeks reddening further, a tentative smile on his face.
“Harry is going to be in such a foul mood now,” Neville sulked, shifting a pot from burner to burner. The metal doors of his wide oven body clanged open and shut in agitation. “We were so close! But
The blond turned a relieved smile to him, feeling the most comfortable in the castle for the first time since his arrival.
Draco found himself admiring a drawing the Golden Boy had drawn of Pansy, the caption below stating how demanding the sly Slytherin had been to have Potter draw her. Draco smiled.
Potter spluttered indignantly. “I’m not fucking with you!” he protested, hands clenching and unclenching at his sides.
Something fluttered in Harry’s chest and the words that he had originally wanted to say flew from his head. “I’ll—um—okay.” He turned away awkwardly, unaware that the blond’s gaze followed him until he’d left the common room.
Now he was here, his gaze on the deteriorating front gates, and an icy breeze cutting through his warming charm. He fought back a shiver, unsure as to whether he could blame it on the cold or the brief spike of fear that sparked within him as he passed through onto the Hogwarts grounds.
Harry just had to flip his lid, didn’t he? What was he expecting? His prisoner to embrace him with open arms?!”
“Ah, the young Draco Malfoy,” the Dark Lord crooned, a dark smile twisting at his lips. “A pleasure at last to finally meet you.”
“Hmm.” Harry bit his lip as he wracked his brain for ideas, rubbing his forehead. His fingers brushed against his scar and a grin began to stretch at his lips.
nights… you’re even finishing Quidditch practice early just so you can spend more time with him. Mate… you’re completely smitten.”
Hermione’s eyes swept the library, gaze hopeful that she would spot her two best friends sitting at a table. When no familiar dark or red head appeared, she sighed but continued further inside, following the familiar pathway to the secluded table she, Parkinson, and Malfoy preferred. The smell of old books soothed her as she swept down the hallways of shadowed bookshelves; the past two weeks had been tiring to say the least. What with both Harry and Ron ignoring her, Hermione was no closer to being able to properly apologise to the brunet, let alone find out where he stood on the matter of Malfoy being his blood-mate. It had been almost four weeks since Draco had taken Harry’s vein—it wouldn’t be long before it began to take its toll on the vampire.
“You have no idea,” Harry breathed with a smile as they continued towards the lake. “Hermione of course was outraged that I had not told her sooner.”
Harry’s hands were drifting lazily up and down Draco’s slick back, fingertips grazing delicately over his skin. He released a content sigh, head turning so he was able to press a lingering kiss to Draco’s cheek. The crackle of the fire was the only sound to penetrate the silence as their breathing died down. Draco was a comforting weight above him and for a brief, blissful moment, Harry was able to forget that there was more to their world than the room around them.
Draco waved his wand expertly, the last of his charms settling over his skin. His morning ritual had become so standard that he barely gave the charms a second thought as he performed them.
“I wouldn’t expect anything less,” Draco replied. “I’m sure Pansy would kill us both if we hid it from her.”
Ron, Hermione, and Percy all flinched as Harry stomped passed them. They stared after him miserably, knowing that their chances of breaking the curse had diminished rapidly.
“Because a blood-mate becomes the vampire’s life force; their bond is tremendously powerful. Once the connection is made, a vampire will only ever crave their mate.”
Harry swallowed. His heart had begun to thunder in his chest from the penetrating scrutiny Ron was now holding him under.
The blond bit his lip. “I am a little hungry,” he admitted, glancing around the room. It looked to be a transfigured classroom. Where a dusty chalkboard lined the wall, cupboards now sat in front, full of utensils and crockery. Desks had been banished to the outskirts of the room, a long table surrounded by chairs now situated in the middle. The blond stared at the table in amazement. It was still placed with two dinner sets; it shocked Draco at the amount of trouble Potter had evidently gone for their failed dinner. The malicious brunet must have been kidding himself—why on earth would Draco want to dine with the very person who was keeping him here?
“You’d be surprised,” Draco replied. “Of course, everything we believed about one another is no doubt completely wrong.”
“Deny all you want, Harry,” the blond stated, “but I can read you better than anyone and you fucking know it. Stop behaving like a repugnant child.”
to ask Draco out now, would he? And it would be better for Draco to give his number rather than expect the poor bloke to fork out his own; at least it would save Draco from the embarrassment of being denied to his face.
“Let’s hope for Harry’s sake that it wasn’t,” Hermione replied stonily, jogging up a staircase. “Hurry up, Ron!”
“How so?” Pansy asked, directing them to their usual desk. As much as Draco would have preferred to remain out of the direct eyesight of his classmates, he knew that maintaining appearances was the best way to sustain normality. After all, hiding in plain sight proved to be much more effective at times—people had no reason to suspect anything different.
Pansy’s heart began to calm, her breath returning as the initial shock of what Draco had said diminished.
“Well no but I didn’t ask you if you wanted a release,” Pansy smirked. “I’m sure Potter would love to help you with that.”
Pansy felt her frown deepen. “Yes, and that is understandable. However, Harry said he forgave you. He’s obviously made the decision that despite what you did, he has deemed it worthy of forgiving and forgetting. Since you’re lying here rather dishevelled, I can only imagine what the two of you got up to just then. Is that not an indication of his trust in you? If he’s acting strangely, perhaps he made the decision about your relationship too hastily.”
“The Headmaster would like to see you,” the Potions Master stated in his usual monotone. “I’m afraid your—discussion—with Miss Granger will have to be scheduled for another time.” He eyed the Gryffindor dismissively.
Draco glanced at his laptop. He always hated not going on and neglecting his blog—he constantly felt as if he was missing out on something.
Draco quirked an eyebrow and gazed up the length of Potter’s body. Cheeky green eyes stared back and Draco couldn’t help the grin that spread across his lips.
Ron glanced at his friend, eyebrows raised. “I don’t know what to tell you, mate. Malfoy looks the same to me as he’s always looked. Like a bloody git,” he added with a grin. “Come on, let’s get this lesson over with.”
Harry woke drowsily, mind foggy. He blinked, a frown tugging at his brow. He did not remember making it to bed last night—he must have been more beat from quidditch practice than he’d realised. Trying to collect his thoughts, Harry discovered he did not recall much after deciding to leave the library and yet… here he was. In bed.
“I put one of my socks in there before giving it back to him. He of course handed it to Dobby so technically your father gave him clothes.”
“It’ll be good for them,” Harry said, “being kept out of the loop for a change.” The room was spinning sluggishly above him, the effects of the alcohol still as prominent as ever.
“Perhaps I should say it more often?” Malfoy continued, tilting his head to the side. “I had figured these intimate moments between us were enough to convince you.”
“Oh,” was all he said. Instead, he grabbed the order from the bench, eyeing the three coffees quickly. One skim latte. One hot chocolate. And one cappuccino.
The bushy-brunette’s cheeks reddened. She lifted her stare warily, glancing between the two of them. “I admitted that I’d known about this since the beginning. Harry was… less than pleased that I’d hidden everything from him. I can’t really blame him, honestly. It’s not as if we gave him much choice in the matter.”
“Seriously, Ronald, you’re not going to understand how to use your laptop if you get me to everything,” Hermione sighed exasperatedly.
It wasn’t long before the feast faded away and students were obviously itching in their seats to get to their new laptops. Dumbledore rose to his feet, gaining attention once more.
Draco blinked, realising he’d been staring at Potter while his thoughts had gotten the better of him. The brunet worried his lip nervously and Draco had the sudden urge to reassure him.
Movement roused Draco from his slight doze as students milled around for potion supplies. He sniffed miserably, wiped his nose with yet another tissue and got to his feet unsteadily, following Pansy to the supply cupboard. He watched the dark haired Slytherin fetch whatever it was they needed as he leant against the wall, wrapped his robes around him tightly as he shivered.
“Don’t like it? Go away,” Draco replied, picking his fork back up and stabbing at his food. A sudden slap to the back of his head had him dropping his utensil and turning wide eyes to the female beside him. “What was
The corridor was eerily silent and absolutely freezing. The giddy smile on Harry’s face however, could not be dampened as he made his way back through the corridors happier than he’d been since the school year started.
“I know there’s something you’re not telling me,” Ron continued calmly, breaking Harry’s thoughts and squeezing his shoulder again. “But promise me you’ll seriously think about this, yeah?”
“I—what?” Draco stilled, his eyes on Harry. The room suddenly seemed impossibly silent. “You… agree that this was a mistake?”
“I think we need to attach bells to that girl,” the brunet commented. “At least that way we’ll be able to hear her coming.”
Harry opened a new tab and typed in the URL. The familiar blog popped into view and Harry went to his ask box.
“Perhaps it’s time to see just how compatible Malfoy and I really are,” Harry said softly, starting over to the male staircase.
Even as the thought settled in Harry’s head, the reminder that Malfoy was still stroking his hip sent another wave of annoyance coursing through him. Perhaps now was not the time to test that theory. Harry was obviously still upset about something—it might not even have anything to do with Draco! Maybe he was just tired; stressed from school. It was probably best that Harry head back to his own dormitory.
Pulling his blankets up and over his head, Harry lay with his eyes shut and a miserable pout tugging at his lips. He always hated feeling ill; he’d never had anyone to take care of him whenever he was. The Dursleys never seemed to care and although he was sure Hermione and Ron would attempt to make him feel better, there was really nothing they could do but pat him on the shoulder.
Distracted as he was, Draco did not notice the small figure he brushed past on his escape. Wormtail peered after the blond with intrigue as he attempted to gauge what had occurred between the Dark Lord and the Malfoy heir. The small, quivering man glanced towards the large wooden doors, his curiosity pushing him to brave an audience with his master. Wormtail opened the door a crack and slipped inside, his gaze landing on the Dark Lord. A dark smile had appeared on Voldemort’s face, eyes gleaming with promise.
Draco thought, keeping his gaze set firmly away from Potter’s. “Pansy is determined to find out exactly what our relationship is.”
Merlin, he felt like a giant mess. For the first time in his life Draco was honestly nervous about the upcoming conversation. He had barely slept the previous few nights, trying to formulate the right words in order to apologise. And now his conversation with the brunet was barely a minute away and Draco still wasn’t sure what on earth he was going to say—
He sent his reply on its way and told his mind to shut up as it ranted happily about Draco’s obsession.
All thought ceased in Harry’s mind once Malfoy’s lips caressed his own, his eyes fluttering shut. Trembling hands came to rest on the demanding blond as Malfoy tugged Harry into his lap, the brunet moving his legs to straddle the Slytherin.
Chuckling, Harry gave in to Malfoy’s desperate pleads, swallowing the head of the blond’s cock and swirling his tongue.
Harry nodded absentmindedly in agreement, unable to stop himself from looking over once more at the Slytherin table. A familiar dark-haired female caught his gaze, cocked an eyebrow and glanced fleetingly at the blond beside her. Harry inclined his head minutely, watching as Pansy then turned to Malfoy, asking him a question Harry couldn’t hear. He saw Malfoy nod and the two of them stood, making their way from the Great Hall.
Pansy smiled as she examined her nails. “And before you ask, no, I’m not gay—I am very much into men.”
For a moment, he wasn’t sure that the young man he was staring at was his captor. Potter was now dressed in a fresh set of robes, the flowing black material draped over a pair of black slacks and a green sweater. But his hair—oh
“This isn’t what I wanted!” Malfoy snapped back angrily. “For fucks sake, Pansy… you know I never wanted this.”
“Then allow me to explain,” Voldemort announced. “This is the day, Draco, that your dreams come true.” The same sickly twisted smile was still on the Dark Lord’s face as he stared at Draco, his eyes unnervingly focussed.
“I thought it was some twisted dream!” Harry continued, voice coloured with distraught. “But you—oh my god…” He turned back to Malfoy who was watching him carefully. Harry couldn’t hide the distress from his face even if he wanted to. “You
Narcissa uttered a soft cry, her hand fluttering to her throat as she hurried to his side to read over his shoulder.
The blond left without another word, leaving Harry standing alone in the corridor just outside the Great Hall. The two of them had just left dinner and Harry was just thinking that he should probably head back to the Gryffindor tower to do some homework, when the Slytherin had mentioned the Potions essay to which Harry had admitted he hadn’t even started.
A shocked silence covered the Great Hall, broken only by an outraged voice from the Slytherin table.
It was the first evening back at Hogwarts and Harry, Ron, and Hermione were all seated at the Gryffindor table as seventh years. With the sorting having been completed, the three of them, boys especially, were waiting impatiently for the feast to begin.
Malfoy shook his head. “I do not believe so. I have never heard of a wizard getting ‘cancer’.” He shivered abruptly. “Spattergroit however…”
Somehow they had managed to get on Malfoy’s bed where the blond had shown immense skill at removing Harry’s jacket and shirt in a short amount of time. Afterwards, Malfoy had done nothing but devour Harry, planting kisses down his neck and torso with hands moving;
“Oh, really?” Hermione looked pleasantly surprised. “Is this actually happening or are you still sulking?”
“When has it not been Potter,” Draco replied bitterly, looking down at his hands as they lay haphazardly in his lap.
Eyes twinkling, Dumbledore smiled gently at the puzzled brunet. “You and Mr Malfoy are of age, I thought it would be fitting for the two of you to indulge this evening.”
slowly, Draco hooked his fingers beneath the hem of the brunet’s boxers and leisurely dragged them down, allowing Harry’s impatient cock to spring from its confinement. Draco eyed Potter’s erection hungrily, smirking at the precome already leaking from the tip. He swiped his tongue across the head of Harry’s cock, relishing in both the taste and the way the brunet gasped, hips jerking off the mattress. The whimper that he had forced down previously broke free, fingers trembling as they stroked through the blond’s hair. And finally,
Hermione rolled her eyes. “Even if he doesn’t get along with you, he can still recognise hard work and improvement.”
the derisive sneer that he knew was currently on Malfoy’s face. He watched, relieved, as Eli conceded surrender and snatched his cloak from the back of the chair. With a final sulky glare, Eli turned away and left the bar.
Draco Malfoy stood beside Pansy Parkinson, his blond hair shining even in the gloom on the dungeons. The male’s grey eyes were constantly scanning the other students in an almost calculating and shrewd manner. Harry didn’t remember the Slytherin being so… cautiously observant before. Despite the caginess, Harry couldn’t help but appreciate the way Malfoy appeared. His skin, which had always been pale, was even more so, his eyes glinting a sheen of silver whenever his gaze moved.
“Huh okay, maybe I’ll just go find the one you use,” Pansy thought. “Do you mind writing it down for me?”
Draco found himself staring aimlessly at the accustomed decorum of the manor. Everything here felt stale; overused. He figured that was most likely the reason behind his choice to remain in France. A new home to call his own—not the same manor that had been handed down through each generation of Malfoys. There were too many rules here. Too many constant, unchanging qualities.
“Draco, listen,” Pansy frowned. “Granger isn’t known for her amazing sense of humour and it was obvious she was being serious. I really, really think Potter likes you.”
“You’ll have to go to a muggle town,” Draco said. “The easiest way would be to purchase a prepaid USB device. That way you don’t have to give as many details.”
“Leave the poor guy alone, Hermione,” Ron interjected good naturally. “So Harry’s feeling a little buggered—happens to everyone.”
Harry could practically feel Hermione’s disapproving stare burning into the side of his face and he turned an innocent look in her direction.
“I just wanted to—to explain what happened. I didn’t mean—that is—I—” Frustration welled within Draco.
“Really, Malfoy?” Potter replied, quirking an unimpressed eyebrow as his best friend spluttered in indignation beside him. “Aren’t we a little old for homophobic teasing?” Potter’s unnaturally green eyes were staring right at Draco, and he felt suddenly exposed. The anger coursing through him rapidly dissipated, only to be replaced with the familiar bone-chilling desire to press Potter up against a wall and bite him.
“Why don’t the two of you head off somewhere quieter? Like the Black Stump? You like that place don’t you, Harry?”
Malfoy’s nose crinkled. “Beer does not suit my palate,” the ex-Slytherin said haughtily. “If you message me detailing what you intend to cook I shall provide a suitable wine.”
Staring at the blond, Harry nodded, trusting the vampire completely. A beautiful smile lit up Draco’s face and he leant forward once again, grazing his lips against the brunet’s in another tender kiss.
“Merlin you two are frustrating,” she growled, jabbing a finger in their direction. “You’ll want my help soon enough.”
Agony swept over the brunette’s face. “Harry, you don’t fully understand!” She pressed desperately. “Yes, I knew about Malfoy; he asked for my help you see.”
“I—I just—” Potter cleared his throat, eyes flicking up and down as he fiddled with his knife. “I… thought it would be appropriate for you to send a letter to your father,” he stated gruffly. “To let him know you’re fine. To stop people from looking for you.”
Fuck, whatever this was, Harry absolutely thrived on it. It was familiar, antagonising, challenging, enjoyable,
“Aside from that,” the blond continued, “who you are, what you do, and who you like is your own business. People aren’t always going to agree but who cares? That’s not your problem. No matter what we wish, there will always be someone who disagrees with you. And that’s alright, because at the end of the day, whatever is making you happy is obviously doing the trick. Why give that up for someone with the bigoted opinion of a troll?”
“Go on, Harry,” Hermione prodded gently. “Whatever it is you have to tell us I am sure we will understand.”
Potter rubbed the back of his neck, the confusion fading from his brow. Draco watched as the tension slowly eased from the young man’s shoulders and his eye began to brighten.
“It’s probably because it’s us,” Draco replied, tilting his head as he pondered the notion. “We went the better part of seven years hating one another.”
“I take mild offense to that,” Draco sniffed. “I’m not going to tell anyone your secret, Potter, of that you can be sure.”
“My brain is still trying to keep up,” Harry smiled. “I don’t think it wants to admit that we’re actually having a friendly conversation.”
The blond pressed his hands to his eyes as he groaned. “I know,” he whined, “but I actually miss him. This relationship shit is worse than I could have ever imagined. Why on earth did you allow me fall for Potter?”
“Charms,” Malfoy offered, sensing the Gryffindor’s confusion, “I apply charms on my skin daily. They work well enough if I am in the castle but they do not provide me protection from direct sunlight.”
Granger’s eyes were sickeningly kind as they studied him. “After everything that has happened, Draco, you deserve a little happiness.” She held up a hand to silence him as he opened his mouth in indignation. “I am well aware of our past,
“I became rather hooked over summer,” Hermione admitted. “One of my friends I see during the holidays got me onto it.”
“Well…” the pompous clock began, “there’s the usual things of course, flowers, chocolates, promises you don’t intend to keep…”
isn’t the understatement of the year,” he commented wryly. His eyes tracked over the movements of the objects, watching as items were placed around him. More candles were set along the table in beautiful carved silver holders and Ron bounded along the wooden top to light each one.
“I mean it,” Draco continued. “I understand how self-conscious you are about your sexuality and Theo’s words would not have helped that. Do not however, believe him. Your preferences are none of his concern nor anyone else’s.”
“Merlin, if I were Potter I’d never want to look in Draco’s direction ever again,” Pansy muttered. “How many times did we tell him to be honest? How many times did we tell him to stop
Draco supposed he should be somewhat wary of what Potter seemed to have in store for him… but it was hard not to be infected with the other male’s excitement. Ever since their walk had come to an end, Potter had been positively buzzing, his eyes alight with pleasure and exhilaration. Unsure as to what had made the Boy-Who-Lived so worked up, Draco hadn’t argued when Potter announced he had something to show him. Until, that was, Potter requested he close his eyes.
“Any Slytherin would have done exactly what you admitted, Harry,” Draco said. “Except they would have done it on purpose—and with a severe lack of honesty. We don’t handle betrayal well and when given the chance, of course we’d return the favour. I don’t blame you in the least for feeling the way you do.”
“Comfortable? Because if it’s not I might just have to trade with someone else.” Harry mused with a smile.
He unbuttoned the Gryffindor’s jeans without hesitation and he slid down the length of the male below him until his mouth was hovering over where Potter’s belly button was. Draco shoved Potter’s shirt up and out of the way so he was able to drag his tongue teasingly across the brunet’s skin. Potter squirmed, his breath coming out in gasps.
you gone?” Malfoy asked as he sat back, applying a delicious pressure against Harry’s already excited crotch.
A sigh seeped from Harry. “Guess you were right,” he mumbled. “About Malfoy being a good for nothing dick.”
was willing to wait. I knew very well how much I had hurt you and I wanted to give you enough time until you were ready to make a decision. And there you were, barely a week later, saying you missed me… that you had
Harry felt himself lean back against the wall of lockers. “So I know a few things about him—that tends to happen when you hang around someone a lot.”
All in all, Draco was feeling rather normal, all things considered. That was, however, until the wind began to pick up outside, bursts of fresh air blowing into the classroom. As the breeze blew through the open window, the blond inhaled through his nose, eyes closing as Potter’s scent suddenly enveloped every inch of him.
Little did she know that Harry was doing exactly as she was, scrolling through his latest posts and smiling at the many notes his drawings had. He noticed with excitement that he had a few questions in his ask but decided to leave them until later after he’d seen most of the new posts.
He’d meant it as a joke, Harry was pretty sure, yet the brunet could not stop the small flash of doubt that appeared.
“The Dark Lord sent him to Hogwarts,” Narcissa replied in a whisper. “He was supposed to return no later than this morning. But there’s… there’s been
“Please trust me, Draco, when I never thought hiding our relationship would hurt you,” Harry said, his lips trembling. “If I’d known losing you would be the result I would have screamed it from the heavens.”
“There’s a Hogsmead trip coming up,” Harry shrugged. “Ask her out for the day and take her somewhere nice.”
“I just need to grab my laptop,” Harry said as he got to his feet with his belongings. “Do you mind keeping this safe while I do?” He held out his parchment book and Hermione accepted it with a smile.
Hermione blinked innocently. “I don’t know what you mean, Ronald,” she replied. “Ooh, speaking of which I need to get to the library.”
“Alright I get it,” Pansy said, holding up a hand. “Well that’s good isn’t it? You’ve bagged the Boy-Who-Lived.”
“Roll over, love,” he managed to whisper, swallowing back a groan as his erection positively hummed with impatience in his grip.
Once seated in the stands, Harry cast many more warming charms before opening his art book to his latest, but unfinished, drawing of the blond. It was Harry’s favourite so far and he took extra care as he continued. Malfoy’s eyes, for one, had to be absolutely perfect. They were Harry’s favourite quality, with the rare, brilliant smile the blond would flash to his closest friends close behind.
“I’m not pretending to be anything,” the female replied truthfully. “However, since Harry has already expressed his desire to tell us something, and that we are now hidden securely in your dormitory, wouldn’t that demonstrate that he is about to indeed ‘spill’?”
Percy glared after them as Draco made his way to the table, taking a seat and looking about in amazement.
“Before I send you off to your dormitories I would like to inform you that the Library has been equipped with devices named ‘printers’ that will allow you to print any documents you will need for class or personal use. Please use your new computer laptops wisely and with care. The Ministry will be sending one of their own to Hogwarts in the next few days to be of help to those with any problems.” Dumbledore smiled widely. “Now off to bed!
you had known, you wouldn’t have done it in the first place,” Pansy snapped irritably. “You better pray to whoever is listening that Potter accepts this bond. To be perfectly honest, considering your
“Who? Oh! The lad. Yes, the, well the, ah, lad, actually he’s in the process of—um, circumstances being what they are, he…” Percy’s face fell. “He’s not coming.”
“Oh, my life is boring,” Eli remarked. He had yet to even look down at his drink let alone take a sip. He insisted on holding it tightly within his palms. “Not like yours I bet.”
was exceptional at for a change. With his enjoyment beginning to flow, Harry sat comfortably whilst Hermione became lost in her novel.
Draco groaned deep in his throat, entire body trembling. He could feel the bond materialising between them, a connection so strong it rocked his very core. The emotions he could feel from Harry intensified and he gasped aloud, swarmed with a feeling of such serenity and acceptance it made his heart ache.
When Draco next glanced up, Potter was receiving a whispered reprimand from Ron, his three flames flaring with each jab of an accusing candle, like a finger to the chest. A look of guilt passed over Potter’s face and he rubbed the back of his neck with his left hand.
his company… there was still a part of Harry that was not entirely comfortable with how things had come to be. There were moments, brief although they may be, where Harry found himself battling with a sudden surge of anger and despair.  And he wasn’t entirely sure as to why that was.
“I swear the universe has it in for me,” Draco snarled, leaning back in his chair and folding his arms tightly across his chest. “This is ridiculously unfair.”
“Tell you what,” Draco began, catching Potter’s gaze. “You tell me your secret and I will tell you one of mine.”
“I know this entire situation is frustrating for you,” she said gently. “But remember no matter what happens I will stick by you, alright?”
“In any case, I plan on explaining everything to him should the time come. If we can maintain a respectable distance from Potter while keeping Draco relatively calm, I don’t see why I need to worry him about it.”
With a frustrated sigh, Harry flopped onto his back, glaring up at the ceiling of his four-poster bed. It was two in the morning and the brunet had yet to fall asleep. A mantra was currently running through his head, peaking his distress and preventing his slumber.
He arrived at her office just as the Professor was stepping out, straightening her hat and casting an odd glance at Draco.
All the breath seemed to expel from Harry’s lungs, staring as Malfoy stalked away. His heart was absolutely thundering; it had taken his entire strength of will to utter those words.
“Shall we go check out our new toys?” Harry grinned, noticing a few of their classmates had already started.
Comments are love! The reception I receive from the first two chapters I will be posting will influence the decision I make to follow through with this idea so please, please review if you are enjoying it/want more!! Thank you!!
Trekking down the staircase and through the Slytherin common room, Draco was just leaving the dungeons and advancing towards the Great Hall doors when a little fourth year Gryffindor approached him looking rather timid.
Harry sighed and rolled onto his stomach, eyes falling on the frosty window. Snowflakes fell elegantly outside, undisturbed and peaceful. As Harry watched them, a soft breeze picked up the flakes and tossed them about in a whirl of excitement much to the brunet’s enjoyment. Harry had always enjoyed winter, particularly the beauty snow could bring.
Malfoy ducked his head, words failing him momentarily. Where would he even begin? Harry had given his trust and Draco had torn straight through it, lost in the frenzy of his hunger. He could have seriously hurt the Gryffindor—
“Yes, Wormtail,” Voldemort continued in mild amusement, “don’t talk about Lucius in that manner.” He had kept his gaze on Draco all the while, a deviant smirk curling at his lips. “Very well, Draco, be on your way. I do hope you give—
Malfoy’s skin had taken on a grey pallor, eyes dark and shadowed. He appeared thinner and exhausted, his body no longer portrayed the strength she had been used to seeing. Hermione noticed he kept his pale lips pressed firmly together and she suspected that his fangs were now permanently elongated, evidence of his hunger.
Taking Draco’s earlobe between his teeth, Potter began to demonstrate the skills Draco had also been teaching him over the last week which soon had the blond barely able to gasp for breath.
So there would indeed be a next time? Draco stole a look across the room. Potter caught his eye, blushed heavily, and looked away. Draco felt his lips part as a breath escaped him.
Glancing in annoyance across the Great Hall, the blond noted the way the brunet had placed himself with his back to the Slytherin table, giving him the perfect excuse not to meet Draco’s gaze. It was such a small thing but Draco knew that Harry had positioned himself in such a manner on purpose. Perhaps he thought Draco wouldn’t notice—yet how could Draco not when he had become so accustomed to staring across the hall at the familiar pair of green eyes for the past seven years?
Pansy grinned. “The way I heard it, Lucius can’t exactly punish his son for something he himself is guilty of.”
Blinking, Draco focused on the screen of his new school laptop. It was slighter smaller than the one he’d bought and nowhere near as pretty. It did the job however, and soon he was back on his account on Tumblr—
The bushy-haired female remained quiet, watching Pansy as she crossed the room, coming to sit on the desk opposite. Pansy found herself glaring at the wooden floor, wondering how on earth she was going to word Draco’s fuck-up to the Golden Boy’s best friend.
“Hmm? Oh, up there? Nothing! Absolutely nothing worth seeing up there in the Gryffindor tower,” Ron babbled.
“Well, yes in a way,” Hermione replied, placing her quill down and applying a thoughtful expression to her face. “But Harry seems really happy at the moment.”
Potter grinned awkwardly. “No, but I am curious as to what put you in a good enough mood to start talking to me.”
This time the cloud was a pretty pink and a large purple velvet top hat fell out. A dozen chocolate frogs quickly followed, landing all over their plates.
“No, I don’t think I do, actually,” the brunet replied. He pushed away at the wrist he was holding and Eli finally took the hint, withdrawing his hand.
Draco’s jaw clenched. “Yes,” he replied through gritted teeth, “I feel fucking awful. But, get this, I’m actually trying to make
Draco snatched the bowl she offered and proceeded to do so, shooting her dark looks all the while. Pansy on the other hand, trailed her finger across the page of her textbook as she made sure when to add each element. This particular potion was tricky, a typical favourite of Snape’s.
So he nodded his agreement. “I understand,” he replied, noting the relief that passed over Potter’s face. “I’ll tell Pansy to back off.”
,” Draco snapped brusquely. He paused, wincing at his outburst. “I know, sir,” he continued, voice gentler. “I apologise for my outburst,” he added after a moment.
“George,” Potter growled in warning. His green eyes were blazing again. Both doors snorted in derision.
Voldemort blinked, his gaze sliding to the male standing expectantly in the doorway. He raised a dextrous hand and beckoned the blond into the room. The older Malfoy crossed the room elegantly, sliding smoothly to his knees as he bowed before the Dark Lord, much to the male’s satisfaction.
Harry shrugged again. “Didn’t really want to stick around to hear the story to be honest.” Beside him, he heard Hermione sigh and he felt a warm hand come to rest on his arm.
when a creature had taken over; walking in his skin, sharing his memories? He craved Harry on a level that should have been impossible and yet here he was, doing everything he could in order to keep himself away.
The grand wardrobe swaggered towards the entrance, the stone wall grinding as it slid to the side, and Draco quickly followed. The chill that hit him as they stepped out of the Slytherin common room nearly knocked him off his feet. He couldn’t stop the sharp intake of breath, the icy air coating the inside of his lungs with an agonising burn as his arms crossed protectively around his chest. A hand quickly sought for his wand, but before his fingers even brush the wood, the torches hung intermittently down the corridor flared into roaring flames and the entire corridor was suddenly awash in delicious warmth.
At that moment Hermione arrived by his bedside with Madam Pomfrey in tow. The ever-alert Healer had her wand out instantly and her hand on Harry’s chin to hold his head steady as she scanned his eyes. She murmured gently to herself but Harry was unable to make out what she was saying.
Harry nodded vigorously, sweeping his gaze around the room. “Holy hell this is eerie.” He looked down at his hands, wiggling his fingers in front of his face. “It feels so surreal not to be wearing any glasses.” He studied his fingers intently, amazed at the detail he could clearly see without the unnatural magnification of his lenses.
As Harry followed the red-head, his gaze was drawn once more to the Slytherin who was crossing the dungeon to his usual seat with Parkinson. Malfoy sat down gracefully beside her, removed his textbook, parchment, and ink, before leaning back in his chair, his arms folded in a casual manner.
Harry grinned. “So, are we actually going to get any homework done or was that simply a ruse to have your wicked way with me?” the brunet asked, slyly.
“Because I’m not,” Hermione replied simply. “I’ve always found the relationship between Harry and Malfoy to be interesting… truthfully I was expecting something like this to happen.”
“I think you and I are going to get along just fine, Potter,” Draco practically purred, grazing his lips against the young man’s hipbone.
Happiness should have been soaring through him at this little success. Instead, Draco felt despondent, the realisation that the brunet had no clue as to what he was or what he had done overwhelming him. There would be no way he could take from Harry again, not when his mate remained unaware. A voice in his head demanded he tell Potter exactly what had happened, to reveal the truth about what had been done to him over the summer. Another voice, however, a stronger and more determined voice, warned Draco not to lose what he had already acquired: a way into Harry’s trust, into his life. By revealing the truth, there was a large chance he would be bereaved of what should be his.
“Don’t you have class?” Snape sniped shrewdly, lowering the lid of his computer to glare at the young man.
Harry considered this for a moment and decided to give his friend a break. “Yeah, fair enough,” he replied. “I promise to explain everything, alright? But it’s really not anything I want people overhearing.”
“Of course.” The blond frowned curiously at the Gryffindor. “You want to go ice skating? Seriously?”
Oh fuck, Potter was speaking. What was he even saying? Draco blinked, Potter’s face coming back into focus. How long had he been staring?
“They came up pretty clear,” Hermione said proudly, examining the drawings on her screen. “This is great.”
“Uh huh,” Hermione replied, offering a disbelieving look. Harry returned it with a sheepish one of his own.
There were only few morning stragglers roaming around the common room when they entered but Hermione didn’t bother pausing to tell them to hurry. Instead, she tugged Ron up the staircase to Harry’s door, knocking on it gently.
Harry’s emotions were growing stronger, and Draco knew he that his mate was not far now. He turned a corner and his breath caught in his throat, body going eerily still. There, just ahead of him, was his mate.
Heart pounding, Hermione clicked on the link and followed it to Harry’s supposed blog. After reading the information on the side, Hermione’s suspicion was confirmed.
Their bodies, slick with water, were inseparable; a tangle of limbs as their mouths sought for areas to kiss, nip, and suck. Harry’s mind was a whirlwind of thoughts and emotions with a desperate edge; he could barely keep himself standing let alone talk. When he felt Malfoy’s fingers over his arse, the brunet could only hiss a single word.
“That’s becoming exceedingly obvious,” Draco chided, but the gentle smile on his face soothed the mock reprimand in his voice. “I’m sorry, I did not mean for my silence to be an answer. Your offer simply surprised me.”
Ron snorted. “Yeah, ‘studying’, sure.” He heaved a great sigh and dropped his quill onto his Transfiguration book. He glanced at Hermione who was scratching away fervently at a draft study timetable. “Hey, Mione, can I ask you something?”
“Fine, we’ll go over it again tonight, alright?” Draco promised, spying a table in a rather secluded corner.
Draco had grown up hearing the stories about The-Boy-Who-Lived… but he had never imagined that what had happened at Hogwarts had involved
Ron’s eyes were wide as he stared at the brick wall. Realising suddenly that he was holding his breath, Ron steadily released it, not wanting to give away his hiding place.
Draco could only stare at the carpet. He felt as if he was falling, his body submerged into a void of darkness as the repercussions of his actions finally hit him. How could he have been so
“We prefer to study at least once a day,” Hermione shrugged. “When and where do you and Parkinson study, Harry?”
With a swell of panic, Lucius’s mind remained blank. The once clear memories of his turmoil at—wait, where had he been again? He recalled being sent on a mission… a mission for the Dark Lord. He had been instructed to search the ground of… of Hogwarts? No that couldn’t be right. He could not remember going anywhere
Ron snorted, his flames sparking in amusement. “Nah, can’t say we do.” He hopped back down to where Draco was sitting, tilting his waxed face up to the blond. “So what’s your name?”
It was true that it was second nature to glare at the blond; when had Harry ever turned a smile in Malfoy’s direction? Well, excluding the day after Harry’s vision was corrected—
Pansy’s lips curled. “You can’t admit you might be falling for Potter and then immediately deny it.”
Hands, strong and powerful, gripped Lucius’s robe, dragging the man forward until the blond was mere inches from the angry, glowing green eyes.
Harry’s head remained bowed; shoulders slumped in defeat as his arms tightened their hold around his torso. Hermione bit her lip worriedly, glancing at Ron who struggled to think of something to say.
, Malfoy. Using a glamour to hide who I am kind of defeats the point, doesn’t it? I wouldn’t want to have to use a glamour for the rest of my life.”
Harry released a gentle sigh. “I’m tired of pretending,” he admitted, lifting a hand to rub the back of his neck. And good god he really was. He was tired of the way he hid his true desires, tired of how he ignored the way he felt it in his stomach every time Draco smiled. His body knew what it wanted… and what it wanted was Draco.
“Fine.” Grey eyes dropped to the undone buttons on Harry’s robes. “Then allow me to finish what you started.” He tugged the black fabric from Harry’s shoulders and the Gryffindor felt the material pool around his legs. His gaze, however, was locked directly on Malfoy’s, who was staring at him with unhidden desire.
love-sick,” Pansy commented, “but you forget. Potter was just as smitten with you as you are with him… I highly doubt that has changed.”
For the first time in Draco’s life he actually felt a wave of concern pass through him; he wanted to make sure that Potter’s first time was enjoyable. He wasn’t sure what alarmed him the most; the thought of hurting Potter, or the fact that he actually
The damn Slytherin always managed to ignite something with the brunet that Harry had been unable to explain. And the most frustrating part was the fact that Harry really
Hermione immediately smiled, carefully closing Harry’s art book. “Of course.” She picked up her own laptop bag from beside the desk and they left together, making the trek to the library where surprisingly, there were very few students.
Harry blinked in surprise. He had a message? He clicked on the link and waited for the page to load, smiling when he saw that it was from his latest follower, Blonds-Do-It-Better, with a small, simple message.
With a glance at her best friend, Hermione opened a new tab and clicked on one of her saved links. Her Tumblr dashboard appeared and she scrolled greedily through the posts she’d missed with a hidden smile. Although she felt sort of bad that she’d kept this website secret from Harry, the idea of having her own secret blog made up for it.
“He’d never,” Harry replied sadly. “Pansy asks him to come to our study groups and he doesn’t. He avoids me, Mione.”
” He snapped around aggressively, hostile gaze landing on the three objects staring up at him. “If he doesn’t eat with me, then he doesn’t eat
Harry stared at the approaching vampire in horror, his throat tight and muscles unresponsive. Malfoy stepped towards him and Harry, whose back was already pressed firmly against the stonewall behind him, could only watch in fear as the Slytherin drew closer. He flinched away instinctively, a faint whimper falling from his lips as he screwed his eyes shut tightly, waiting for the searing pain. Lowering his head, Malfoy’s nose glided along the skin of Harry’s throat and he breathed deeply.
“So, Granger, what’s the latest as far as the Golden Boy is concerned?” Pansy asked as the Gryffindor neared, taking a seat opposite them.
Harry all but glared down at his laptop. As much as he wished it would, his laptop unfortunately did not hold the answers to his dilemma. Harry was torn. He wanted to see Draco. He wanted to constantly be near Draco. God, he wanted the intimacy with Draco more than anything else.
The evident pull of his lust for the ebony-haired male was proving too hard to ignore. Instead, it appeared that it was time to stop fighting against the inevitable and accept what his new body desired.
Unable to help herself, Hermione smiled. “You’re welcome, Malfoy.” Her smile widened. “I couldn’t pass up the opportunity of having you in my debt now, could I?”
The Gryffindor willingly conceded, allowing her smirk to fall away. “I was being serious when I said do whatever makes you happy. And if Harry makes you happy, why deny yourself that?” If Granger was surprised by the revolted look Draco gave her she did not show it. Instead, she pressed on. “Regardless of your repulsion about Harry being your blood-mate, I know he could make you happy.”
The stone wall slammed shut, a cloud of dust billowing into the room. Draco stared at the bricks in overwhelmed astonishment, the terror that had been building within him suddenly erupting. He walked unsteadily to a grime covered leather couch and collapsed onto it, burying his face into his hands as wracking sob after wracking sob decimated his quivering frame.
In a great rush, Draco felt his hunger surge, throat parch dry as he gazed achingly after the dark-haired boy. Merlin, Harry’s delectable scent seemed to fill the entire corridor, calling to Draco in such a way he could feel every cell within his being crying out, screaming for the male just beyond his reach. He allowed his eyes to close, body trembling with the effort of holding himself back.
“Oh cut the crap, Draco.” Pansy frowned at him. “What happens if Potter finds out about this?” she asked, gesturing towards his screen.
“Pretty much only that,” Harry replied with an offhanded shrug. “I didn’t want to make it too easy for him so I’ve tried to avoid him whenever I could.”
their mate. If Draco was frightening you, Harry, he would not have been able to bring himself to hurt you in any way or form, regardless of how desperate he was for you.”
was his life ever simple? Couldn’t he just meet someone who didn’t want to make him yank out his hair with each spoken word? Was it that hard for Harry to have
Lucius gaped. He had not expected the sheer amount of power that encircled the dark form. It surrounded them both and the blond was unable to tear his eyes away from the malevolent force.
“I decided to give each of us a break; I’ll return immediately to being an arse if you want me to.” Although he kept his face blank, Draco enjoyed the sound of Potter’s laugh.
The brunet slumped into his seat beside the red-head, offering a half-hearted shrug as he pulled out his History of Magic textbook. “Bloody exhausted is all,” he replied. “I think seventh year and quidditch is finally taking its toll.”
Granger handed over the utensil, and Draco watched as Potter began to cut up the Valerian roots into small enough pieces they would be able to pulverise into a powder. Draco couldn’t help but scrutinise Potter’s movements, noticing that Granger was doing the same. She flinched when the brunet’s hand slipped, the knife skidding off the roots abruptly.
Potter’s eyebrows rose in mild surprise. Beside him, a grin was beginning to spread across Weasley’s face.
“I think it came out rather nicely,” Pansy continued, examining her nails intently. “You’re just jealous because he hasn’t drawn
“Sure,” Malfoy replied, reaching forward. His sweater fell back down to his trousers, hiding away the section of perfectly smooth skin. Harry sighed silently.
Hermione hummed in agreement. “In Harry’s case, anything Malfoy-related is definitely worth the note taking.” She smirked at the Slytherin. “This is going to be a
The brunette sighed but assented. “Alright.” She turned to face him a little more. “The third and final step of your bond is… having sexual intercourse. It physically seals the connection between you. A blood-mate is always someone a vampire will crave, established bond or no. You see, Harry, when a blood-bond is officially created, it initiates the emotional and physical connection between the two of you, something so strong there is almost nothing that can break it.”
Without a further backwards glance, Draco left his godfather’s private rooms and began for the dungeons.
“I did not.” A third voice joined them and Harry and Hermione looked over to a rather dishevelled Ron.
“And you love it,” Pansy grinned, sitting herself down on the edge of Draco’s bed. “Won’t you put aside your prejudice for one day?”
you. The bond the two of you will share will be unbreakable. Sharing blood is, not to sound cliché, the
Harry looked over his shoulder. Malfoy was walking down the corridor towards him, looking more dishevelled than Harry had ever seen him.
and Harry had to curve the impulse to continue tearing his room apart. Instead, he marched over to his bedside, where a small table held a mirror and a beautiful crystal case. Enclosed within the case was an unusual wand hovering silently. “What does he
The Gryffindor versus Slytherin quidditch match had been the best game Harry had ever played. With his glasses no longer an issue, Harry had been free to pull as many risky turns and dives as he desired without the fear of losing them. Another matter that pleased Harry to no end was how distracted Malfoy had been during the entirety of the match. The blond had seemed no more interested in catching the snitch than he was during History of Magic. Harry was curious as to what it was that had been on Malfoy’s mind. It had almost seemed as if the Slytherin just wasn’t interested anymore.
“Yeah, whatever,” Draco grumbled. “Just, go do your study thing with them and I’ll see you later tonight so we can do our Potions homework.”
Harry, actually more than happy to do so, suddenly found himself frowning as his head quirked to look to the side. “Aren’t you here with Parkinson?” he asked.
The two young men came to a stand-still beside the edge of the lake, the large, vast, plane of white stretching far across before them. Harry pulled out his wand and flicked it twice; testing the thickness of the ice to make sure it was strong enough to hold them.
Halfway through, Hermione’s gaze flickered over to the brunet, questions burning on the tip of her tongue. She wanted nothing more than to sate her curiosity in regards to Harry’s crush but she knew her best friend, and she knew there was a chance he could overreact negatively. On the other hand, she
“If only,” Harry replied with a wry laugh. “Can you believe the git actually wants us to start being friends?”
“Never fear though, Potter,” Draco continued and he removed his trousers. “I will take care of you.”
Harry groaned a sigh, letting his fork clatter onto the plate. “I ran into Malfoy just before,” he grunted. “Bloody prat got me riled up is all.”
glasses you idiot,” he chuckled. “How great is this? Malfoy tries to be an arse but instead fixes my eyesight! He’s going to hate himself forever.”
Draco’s sobs had long since subsided. Although his cheeks were still lined with dry-tear tracks, his breathing had returned to a normal, somewhat calm state. He’d been staring into the fireplace for the past hour, watching the flickering flames he’d cast to help warm the unpleasantly cold room. From his surroundings, he’d gathered that this had been one of the four Hogwarts houses, most likely Slytherin, if the snake decorum was anything to go by. He had yet to search for a bedroom, assuming the old student dorms were up one of the two staircases he could see from his position on the couch. Instead, he’d slowly begun the arduous process of working out what the hell he was going to do now. Here he was, a
Focusing on his determination to squash the longing for Potter’s blood, it took Draco a moment to realise that his mouth was beginning to feel rather… crowded. A shot of alarm stabbed into his chest. Here he was, in the middle of History of Magic, and his fangs had
Moonlight streamed down onto the grounds as the clouds suddenly parted and Draco nearly wept with relief.
Harry raised his hands. “Hey, as long as she plays nice, I don’t have a problem,” he said honestly. He looked at Ron who shrugged.
His lips tugging downwards, Harry looked at Draco and spoke. “I’ll—I’ll leave you to—to think things through. I’m sorry again, Draco, I know if I was in your position I would have left a long time ago...” The shorter man turned away and stepped quietly from the room leaving the blond staring at the empty space before him.
Malfoy complied, and Harry felt himself arching up off the couch at the sensation of teeth scraping his skin roughly, a delicious moan falling from his lips.
“To fuck me around?” Harry suggested. His tone however, was anything than convinced of his belief of his words. He shrugged offhandedly, glancing down the corridor as his tried to think of something,
Harry snorted as he rearranged himself on the bed, sliding up carefully so he was able to recline against the pillows. “And look where that got us.”
The brunette stared derisively down at the blond. “How about you stop thinking about the unlikely future and focus on the present? Namely making it up to Harry before he really does decide he’s better off without you.”
If you or anyone you know can translate English to French PLEASE CONTACT ME! I want to have french-speaking Draco in this fic and I want to make sure it is correct. I do not want to have to rely on Google translate. You guys and Draco deserve better!! Thank you!
, he was quick to shove aside his shock and reach for his mate, deepening the kiss with a passion he’d kept subdued for too long.
“So far it has been quite pleasurable,” the blond agreed. “How long do you think until we get sick of each other?”
As that thought settled, a sense of alarm overcame him. What were the chances of Malfoy, being a pure-blood wizard, happening across Tumblr, a muggle site? Shouldn’t Malfoy have very limited knowledge of the internet?
Unaware that the fourth year had run off, Draco made his way slowly up the long staircase, casting a longing glace back to where he could see the Great Hall.
As his headache gave a particular painful twinge, Harry decided to go to bed. He was only missing Divination and he had a free period after lunch; he really could not be bothered going down to eat. Instead, he toed off his shoes, relaxed in bed, switched his laptop on and went straight to his dashboard. Although his headache grew monstrous from the glare of the screen, Harry was comforted by the messages he’d received about his drawings. On here he wasn’t some scarred weirdo who only succeeded because he got lucky. He had actual talent that he could show with pride and it made him happy to see so many people admiring him.
As soon as Harry’s lips parted from his skin, Draco’s mouth was back on his, kissing him so deeply it made Harry’s mind spin. His fingers scoured down the blond’s back, earning him a guttural moan and a wonderful flex of Draco’s hips. Harry gasped.
“Don’t care,” Harry said bluntly. “If Trelawney cares that much I’ll tell her I wasn’t feeling well.”
Harry stepped inside and shut the door behind him, wishing he could shove whatever this feeling was aside. As he gazed across the room to the Slytherin who sat gracefully on the edge of his bed, Harry couldn’t help but muse over how easily they had slid back into old habits. As if nothing had ever changed. The previous Friday morning had been wonderful—perfect even; Harry had been sure everything was going to be alright between the two of them.
Malfoy sat at another tree with Pansy, Theo and Blaise relaxing around him. One of them had obviously said something funny as a genuine smile had brightened the blond’s face, his eyes alight with pleasure.
Once his laptop screen went black, Harry lowered the lid and placed it aside along with his glasses. He unbuttoned his shirt, dropped it to the floor and wriggled out of his school pants. He warded his door to warn anyone who approached to leave him alone and snuggled down into his blankets, pulling them high.
Ron nodded. “Fair enough,” he said. “Do you want me to fill Hermione in? You know she’ll be desperate to know.”
That thought had Harry snorting a laugh. Distracted by that image, he barely had time to acknowledge the way his name was hissed as he passed a particularly shadowed alcove. A pair of arms suddenly shot out of the darkness, wrapping themselves around Harry’s waist and pulling him into the shadows. His exhausted mind was only just catching up to this fact when he felt his back press up against something warm, the arms twisting themselves around his figure and holding him tightly.
Pansy sniffed. “As if I would.” But she did not press further. “Alright, fine but if something extremely juicy is revealed I want
With a roll of her eyes Pansy removed herself from the room, leaving Draco in silence. He glared angrily at his screen, profanities of a vile nature running circles in his head.
… Pansy thought. “Just remember to keep an open mind. Potter isn’t as crafty or quiet as a snake, he tends to wear his heart on his sleeve.”
“Yet, despite your intense hunger, you did not.” The older woman placed a gentle hand on Draco’s shoulder. “I will admit to doubts I had when the Headmaster informed me of your… new predicament. I had expected accidents galore as you became accustomed to your new body and hunger. From what you have just explained, Mr Malfoy, you have demonstrated an amazing strength of self-control not easily matched by most. Why I may not condone the actions that led you to this point, it is obvious you are more than aware yourself of the possible dangers. I hope, for yours and Mr Potter’s sake, that some form of understanding will be established between the two of you so incidents such as this will be avoided in the future.”
Harry’s frown deepened “Yeah, and?” he pressed, before his eyes widened slightly. A grin spread across his face. “You didn’t realise I knew that already.”
“Actually there’s not really much more to tell,” Harry admitted. “I’m not really sure how we plan on acting now that school’s back.”
Panting, Malfoy paused above Harry to gaze down at him. “Do you have any objections before we take this further?” the blond asked, cheeks flushed.
On the bed, Harry’s hand suddenly twitched. Draco’s full attention was immediately back on his mate, face stricken.
“Wait, Harry, please! This can still be fixed. I can—” her voiced faltered again as Ron stepped into her path once more, allowing the brunet the chance to exit the room.
