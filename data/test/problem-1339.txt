If only she could have those moments with Dobby back right now. Poor Dobby, stuck all alone in a hole in the ground somewhere, what a terrible fate for an elf.
‘I will leave you to it so’, Draco shouted with a wave, when the group left the house with promises to reconvene at Neville’s place with some ideas the following day.
If Fleur and Bill were surprised by the arrival at their cottage of an elf, a goblin, a worse for wear famous wandmaker, four Gryffindors, a serene looking Ravenclaw and a Slytherin with a dagger sticking out of his shoulder, they did not let on.
‘Now, Harry, that is not fair,’ Neville said, sounding a bit hurt, ’I was only a student at the time and you did not exactly give me any time to do any proper research. I am now a renowned herbologist, professor of herbology for quite some time, I have my own laboratory and have written several books on the medicinal properties of a wide range of plants and have been researching the properties of Gillyweed and the dirigible Plum for a few years now.’
This was like nothing either of them had ever experienced. He could sense Harry’s relief that the suits worked as they passed through the atmosphere and realised that they could breathe easily.
‘I was just checking to see if you were ok’, he said softly.
There was none of the usual bravado in the boy’s voice, none of the cockiness he had displayed in the six years they had been students at Hogwarts.
‘Scoot over’, he said to the taller boy, as he climbed into the small camp bed beside him. With one arm gently wrapped around Draco, he fell into a dreamless sleep.
If that Potter boy had really cared for Dobby, he would have tried to contact Dobby’s family and friends and asked what arrangements Dobby would have liked for his burial. But No, that had never occurred to the pompous self-absorbed Boy who Lived only because her Dobby had saved him. There was no mention of any Hero Elf, without whose help there would have been no Boy who Lived to save the goddamn wizarding world. Winky was so mad, that the urge to open a butterbeer was nearly too much for her.
Draco could sense the excitement of his husband as the rocket gathered speed and it was matched by his own joy and sense of adventure. This was a million times better than flying on broomsticks.
Hermione was about to say something, when she felt Luna’s hand on her wrist and saw the serene creature give her a silent shake of her head.
‘Never miss an opportunity to advertise your wears’, George shrugged, when Harry turned around the space suits.
She would have to change the title, of course, as there was no way she would go around promoting something that sounded like vomit. Maybe she would call it the Society for the Promotion of Actual Care for Elves (S.P.A.C.E).
She vaguely remembered the crazy red-haired girl who was friends with that Potter boy coming down to the kitchens talking about forming an Elf Union and all that non-sense, but the only one who was interested was Dobby, who was very proud to be a Free Elf and a friend of the ‘Best and Bravest Wizard Of All Times’, as he would loudly proclaim to all who wanted to listen.
‘And where the fuck would I get my hands on that. Not helpful Freddy-boy’, Harry felt himself getting annoyed by the pointless information.
Hermione saw him staring at the large carved stone that was attached to the base of the bubble helmet. ‘To suppress any anxiety or urges to do something rash or stupid’, she said. ‘You really should read up on your amulet lore, Harry’.
Three excited faces stared up at him, expectantly.
Fred had joked that if it all went to hell they were welcome to join him and he would do his best to show them a good time.
‘Having been blowing things up again, Seamus?’, he asked cautiously.

Draco- I repeat, Ugh.  How do I choose an internet provider?
(Told in chapters that vary between Before the war and after the war, and varying points of view between Draco and Harry. It is not told in any sort of order, but bounces around to slowly round out.
Draco closed his eyes tightly, gasping for air as he moved to get up from the stool, walking unsteadily for a few steps until he felt himself start to fall, but he never hit the floor.  He knew he wasn't holding up his own weight, but he wasn't on the floor either.
But he realized he was just assuming these things.  That he didn't really know for sure...  And he was fairly certain that much like Hogwarts and Grimmauld Place, a home like Malfoy Manor, so old and so thoroughly steeped in magic, could think for itself.  And if he hadn't met whatever pre-requisites it had for allowing him inside, he could assume all he wanted to and it wouldn't make any difference at all.
Draco's first text conversation...
He exhaled the breath long and slow, pushing every last bit of air from his lungs before he started to try and breathe normally.
"If we can't unravel this naturally within a week or so Kingsley isn't going to wait.  He'd rather see your father back locked up properly and scare off whoever got him out then see him STAY out.  There'll be other ways to find out who did it.  Just not as straight forward as this.." Harry paused, looking at the mass of paperwork as sighed.  "Not that this is straight forward."
“Do you think that's what he still wants me to do?”  Draco said, looking up at Harry now he was more composed.  “I suppose he didn't say not to.”
“Harry said he told you about Millicent and Blaise, right?  That they're in hiding as well?”
"I don't want that either.  You could have just explained it to me, we could have figured it out together."
"Third time makes it habit."
sell at auction, this was just our best idea of what to do with it.  An offer of private sale would probably be taken very seriously."
"No no, change that.." Harry whispered once they had both swallowed their laughter and were once again working.  He leaned over the parchment, pressing shoulder to shoulder with the blonde boy.  "Saying onyx has the same density as the grease in his hair I think would even get you into trouble.  Or at least make him think something fishy was going on."
“Don’t you remember, Draco? Don’t you remember anything - any of this? Look at all of these pictures. I can’t stop looking at them.” Harry feels a fresh resurgence of tears he was sure were long gone, and he feels quite literally insane.
“Come here,” Draco growls and pulls Harry tighter. They crash together, a frenzy of lips and tongues and hands. Heat building between them, Harry begins to work Draco’s remaining shirt buttons, meeting his gaze for reassurance with every movement.
Harry walked home in a sort of stupor, desperately hoping he hadn’t just seen Draco for the last time. The worst part of it was that Draco thought him a liar. But it was true, he had lied; he didn’t just
“What in the blazes is a Jelly mould?” Malfoy sounded genuinely alarmed, and Harry couldn’t help but laugh.
Zabini’s eyes widened in surprise as he took in every inch of Harry’s presence in his doorway. “Harry Potter? What in seven hells are you doing showing up on my doorstep like this?” Blaise asked, voice smooth as silk. Despite the intrusion, he looked relatively unruffled.
They barely made it up the stairs, a tangled mess of limbs and tongues and roaming hands, shedding clothing as they went. Draco’s mind felt fuzzy both from the drink and lingering thoughts of the previous night. He threw himself into the unmade bed, luxuriating in the silky feeling of the sheets against his bare skin, attempting to focus on the matter at hand.
And with that, Draco crossed the space between the two of them and softly cupped Harry’s cheek in his hand. Staring into his eyes, searching them for what felt like an eternity, Draco’s eyes fluttered closed and he gently guided their lips together.
Recognition dawned across Pansy’s face. “Don’t think I don’t see what this is. This isn’t some kind of game. They’ve found their happy ending, and it doesn’t include you. You’re standing in
The night before last, he’d agreed to get a drink with Magnus, which led to some heavy petting on the couch, and ultimately a belly full of guilt for Harry. The entirety of the night, he thought of Draco, and what he would do if word floated back to him at the Ministry. He nearly felt ill, and attempted to send Magnus on his way before things went too far.
“I was thinking... indefinitely,” Blaise said, shrugging. “As I said, I love it here. It would be a much, much easier decision if you said yes.”
“I don’t really know, Luna. I thought it was a good thing, but maybe I was wrong.”
“Something like that.” Malfoy was still avoiding Harry’s gaze.
flat, looking like a fool. Don’t you understand?”
“Who knew, indeed. Draco, you don’t actually
“I- you’re probably right,” Harry conceded.
“Well, that’s inspiring me to… not do that,” Malfoy grimaced. “But I don’t really care for parties either. You must be shocked, paragon of charm that I am.”
“I’m ready, love,” he breathes and pulls Draco up to meet him, pressing their foreheads together as Draco sheaths himself with a moan. Tears form at the corners of Draco’s eyes, and he wipes them away, whispering comfort.
Sauntering through the archway looking sheepish is one Draco Malfoy, holding a basket of citrus fruit, and looking devastatingly handsome.
In the back of his consciousness, he’d heard the footsteps but chose to ignore them, thinking it must be another patron or the kindly shopkeeper. He thumbed through the pages, lost in a fantasy. If Luna were there, she’d say his head was full of wrackspurts - or was it nargles?
“Draco, you do that too. It’s what I like about you. One of the things, anyway. Maybe you’re a little more selective, but you protect what you care about.”
Harry snorts. Draco chooses to ignore this.
He was so exhausted when he got back home he didn’t even have the energy to feel bitter about returning to an empty flat. He collapsed in a heap on the bed, glasses and clothes still on, falling asleep almost immediately.
Harry could hardly think when the other man was standing there looking like that, saying his name.
“Thanks, Luna. Did you miss me?”
Harry has to stop himself from shuddering as Draco’s words ring in his ears. All he can hear in his voice is Lucius Malfoy - cold, cutting, clear.
“I just want it to stop. And the timing of it all- I’m supposed to be enjoying our new flat.” Draco sounds exasperated and rubs at his brow with two fingers. “I want to be here with you. This is our own house, and I can’t just… be here.”
Harry and Draco had been sitting in the sand, propped against a log for the last thirty minutes or so. This was at Harry’s behest, believing an impromptu visit to the sea was a cure-all. With Blaise being gone for the last month, Harry took it upon himself to occupy Draco’s time and keep him cheerful. As cheerful as Malfoys could be, anyway. This particular evening they’d found an apparition point close to Westcliff, finding it mostly empty. They’d cast a warming charm over themselves, avoiding the chill as evening settled in around them.
“I’d have you any way you’d let me.” Harry kissed his neck gently.
“If I’m ‘honest with myself,’ Potter, I want nothing to do with you right now.” And with that, Draco got up, turned on his heel and left the coffee shop. He didn’t look back once. If he had, he would have seen Harry looking miserable and embarrassed, staring at his hands.
“Vitória,” he whispered into the darkness.
“So why didn’t you?”
“We’re so sorry, Harry,” Hermione said gently. “We just weren’t sure if you were actually going to go, and we er - got a bit wrapped up.”
he doing there?
“I love you so much, I’ll let it slide that you’re only doing this to upset the Malfoy bloodline.”
The little brick house on the outskirts of London was only a speck in the swirling snow. Outside, a blanket of calm swept over the street, a deep quiet only snow can bring. Inside, the housemates huddled near the fireplace, sipping hot chocolate and firewhiskey. They watched the flurries dance from a living room bathed in the glow of embers.
“No. It was for the best. Everything,” Draco said solemnly.
“You can’t possibly think you’re the only one who knows about Ogma’s?” Draco raised an eyebrow.
“I was wondering… if you’ve any plans for Christmas?” Draco sets the basket down, still staring out the window.
Draco, and he knew exactly why he’d gone to Portugal.
“What’s happened here?” Draco asks, startling Harry deeply, and turning off the music with a flick of a wrist.
When the cuppa is ready, he slides it over to Draco, steam swirling up in thick clouds.
Jesus, was Malfoy… charming?
Witnessing the hurt in Harry’s expression, Draco attempted to reach over and take his hand. Without thinking, Harry recoiled and stared at the ground. He wanted to leave himself, but he couldn't do that to Luna - Gryffindor loyalty and all that.
“Just please don’t tell anyone,” Draco pleads. “I’m not ready to talk about this. I’m not sure I know how.”
When Harry arrives home, it is pouring. He doesn’t bother taking the Floo, opting for a more dramatic, traditional entrance. Draco is sitting on the sofa reading the Daily Prophet. He doesn’t look up when he hears the door slam.
“Oh, it’s Draco now, then? Well, I think
“Not as such,” Harry answers truthfully. He’d actually planned on staying at the castle over break, catching up on all of the grading he could never seem to get ahead of.
In Luna’s kitchen, Harry was pleased he wouldn’t have to face the conundrum of drinking his own gift, impressed by the array of various and sundry beverages. More amusing still was the variety of drinkware. He carefully selected a coffee mug adorned with a mouse holding a daisy next to the words “FOLLOW YOUR DREAMS” in a curly pink font. Smiling, he poured himself some firewhiskey.
Savio had seen through it though and questioned Harry before leaving. Harry attempted every excuse in the book before sighing exasperatedly and telling him there was someone else.
he thought to himself,
“You know, I think you’d make a brilliant healer,” he whispers into the dark.
“Is this something, Draco?” Harry asks finally. “You and me?”
Harry looked up in surprise, attempting to blink away tears in his embarrassment.
Harry ignored him. “Thanks for having me out, Luna. You’ve got a great flat.”
Eventually, he’d consumed enough alcohol that he was able to enjoy the reception, pushing all thoughts of Draco and their non-wedding from his mind. He danced with Luna and Xenophilius, the two of them attempting to teach him the Madagascan Quarter-Step, a flailing, spinning sort of motion that made him dizzy and sent him into fits of laughter. He clinked his glass and cheered to good health, longevity, and magizoology. Out of forgetfulness and force of habit, he only turned to tell Draco something once or twice.
“What?” Harry blurted, feeling an odd mixture of disappointment and happiness bubble up within him.
“Draco, thank you. Thank you so much. I love you. This will be great, so great, for both of us” Blaise said, practically bounding from the settee, obviously thrilled. He bent down and grabbed Draco’s face, planting a firm kiss on his lips. “Now, let’s see about this hangover potion. I’m sure there’s some in the cabinet.” He bustled off to the bathroom.
A raw pang of empathy courses through Harry, though he isn’t quite sure what to say. Torn between strange relief and indignation, Harry fights the desire to ask why Draco hadn’t come to him sooner, why he’d pushed him away. But he remembers all too well what it is to feel helpless, waiting for the right time, waiting while the people you care for suffer. Harry considers what
Blaise paused for a moment, studying the other man. Harry, recognizing the absurdity of the situation for possibly the first time, attempted to avoid his eyes.
Harry grabbed Hermione’s ring hand and studied it in the low restaurant light. It was simple and understated; perfect. He felt his happiness and pride swell, and thought perhaps it wouldn’t be so hard to ignore his feelings, at least for the rest of the night.
“If by hatred you mean repressed sexual chemistry and thoughts of lewd acts perpetrated in the Prefect’s bathroom, then by all means!” Pansy guffawed, taking a swig of wine and laying waste to Draco’s attempt at saving face.
“What’s that, love?” Blaise had returned, poised like a hunter on the prowl. He hugged the side of the doorway, his lean frame elongated by the pose. Draco was absolutely seething at the sight of him like this, so casual and non-chalant, as if he hadn’t just been washing off the scent of a gorgeous Portuguese woman.
Harry turns and smiles at the first year, Rory Clements. “No problem, Rory, thank you. Send them in - and happy holidays!”
” Draco finally meets his eyes, his own questioning and soft in the dark.
“You’re good, Draco. You’re so good,” Harry whispers into Draco’s hair, pulling him down onto the bed. Their bed. He isn’t sure why he says it, he just does.
“You realize you were obsessed with him for the better part of the last two decades, right?” Pansy snorted.
He shook his head.
The pair exchanged guilty looks.
, I would have just fucked that guy,” Harry growls, fire in his eyes. “But if you want an escape from this, Malfoy, be my guest. You have a choice now.”
“Christ, Potter, there’s plenty of time for that later. I’m fairly certain we didn’t come here just to
“What the fuck, Potter?” Malfoy sneers, cheeks darkening, and moving to get away.
“Potter, you’re going to go mad doing this. Of course I remember. I remember everything.” He kneels down on the floor next to Harry, fingers tenderly tracing the photograph of a beach sunset.
It felt like Draco was everywhere. His hands roaming the muscular planes of Harry’s body, worrying his nipples and collarbone with his mouth. Harry, eager to prove himself as well, attempted to divest Draco of his own trousers, but Draco moved away.
“I think maybe you should leave then, Draco. I know you don’t want to be here anyway.” Harry’s voice came icy and firm, though his insides felt shaky.
“Malfoy, you startled me.” He suddenly felt too exhausted to banter.
“I don’t know,” Harry starts. “For me, with Voldemort gone, I felt like I could breathe again. I understand it’s different for you. I don’t like to think about it.”
“Nice mug you have there, Potter. Very inspirational.”
“Would you ever consider… going to Ron and Hermione’s wedding with me? I’m to be in it of course, but I’ve got to have somebody there to help me avoid the cheek-squeezing Aunts,” Harry asked shyly. He felt fairly certain Draco would say yes; they’d been spending nearly all of their time together, but he was so nervous he was almost short of breath.
“Serious about what? Being an enormous arsehole?” Draco sneered. Harry knew he should expect something like this, but it hurt all the same. Draco didn’t tend to react well to surprises.
“I know how this looks, Draco, but I can assure you, we’re just colleagues.”
Sooner than he’d like, Harry finds his release inside of Draco, watching his face carefully, eyes searching. It’s his first time with another man, and in the afterglow he half-mourns the wasted time before he’d known what this was like.
Tears burn in his eyes, but Harry isn’t quite sure it
What happened to the people in those pictures who couldn’t get enough of each other? Who wore cheeky grins and tousled hair? Who teased mercilessly, but loved and defended even harder? It seemed to him he was the same, but The Old Harry would never have sat idly by as the man he loved packed up their life and moved on. The Old Harry wasn’t weighed down by the monotony and obligation of daily life… But was that how he’d come to view their relationship as well?
more than friends. More acknowledgment that this had been a long time coming, forever in the making.The kiss was so intimate and unhurried, it felt like they had been doing this forever. It was too much.
“I am a little shocked. I imagine you truly thriving in a debutante’s ball situation.”
“Oh. Er.” Harry debated for a moment whether or not he should tell the truth. Malfoy had really done nothing to earn his trust, and frankly, he was annoyed at this intrusion. “Ron and Hermione got engaged. That’s where they were, actually, the night of Luna’s party. That’s what they were… doing,” Harry heard himself say against his better judgment.
, conveying a longing that can only be for a person who’s right in front of you, but never close
“Blaise?” Draco’s heart sank, realizing that he hadn’t thought of Blaise all night. Or the day before, really. Possibly even the day before that. “Pansy, I’ve got to go, alright? Thanks for checking in.”
“And with all of this going on, when precisely did you discover that you were attracted to men?” Draco asked, examining his fingernails.
Draco returns as dusk is settling in, and Harry hasn’t moved from his spot. He’s poured over countless questions and compromises, trying to imagine what his new normal might be like, clinging desperately to the hope that nothing will change. He’s moved past hurt into something more visceral.
“He’s asked me to go to ‘pub night’ with those Gryffindor brigands,” Draco said breathlessly after the laughter had died down. He’d attempted to tack this on to the conversation as casually as possible, as though he hadn’t spent an hour agonizing over possible responses to Potter’s owl.
“Oh, are you alive then?” Pansy said into the receiver, sounding incredibly annoyed and relieved at once. “Where the fuck have you been?”
“Unique?” Harry suggested.
“You know, I realize when everything happened with my father, you showed up for me a way I didn’t think anybody could. And when he passed, the freedom, the guilt, the deep, all-consuming sorrow I felt… I thought it might swallow me. But you kept me alive. What if I promised to do the same when the time comes? What if that commitment was enough?”
“I’ve been sitting with it a while because it would mean moving, and… I didn’t want to leave you. Don’t want to leave you. You don’t exactly have the happiest memories of the castle.”
Normally, he wouldn’t stand for this kind of violence without some sort of retaliation, but part of his brain told him he probably deserved it. He couldn’t deny there was another part of his brain that was indeed chuffed at the possibility Draco was no longer together with Blaise.
“I know you would.” He took a deep breath. “And that’s exactly why we should do this; it’s important to you, you’re important to me, and I’ve waited my whole life to make my parents this angry.”
“Wait, what? Potter, you went to Portugal to try and - and what? Break us up or something? What in god's name is wrong with you?!” Draco’s eyes widened in confusion. “I don’t understand. Did you think it was some kind of grand gesture?”
Luna beamed. “Draco’s helped me decorate! Isn’t it lovely?”
He continued to search through the mementos, hoping for answers.
“Fuck, I’m so sorry,” he whispers, hoping it’s the right thing, knowing it falls woefully short.
Luna’s was the most recent wedding Harry and Draco had attended together.
Harry felt woozy and flattered, and he wanted so badly just to close his eyes and kiss Draco. He was so close, all it would take was a slight lean forward.
At some point in the night, Ginny arrived, her new boyfriend in tow. She bounced in the door, making the rounds and chattering cheerfully with everyone in sight. Draco caught Harry staring at them once, and gave an encouraging squeeze to Harry’s thigh. Harry jumped initially, but met Draco’s eyes and smiled in gratitude. It lessened the sting exponentially, and Harry was pleased he’d forced Draco to come along. He’d even introduced himself to Paolo, and begrudgingly admitted that while he wasn’t exactly keen on spending any more time with the pair, they suited one another.
Harry doesn’t try to stop him as he leaves.
“It’s just that… when someone is ill, it’s impossible not to pay attention to every detail of their lives. You analyze the way they look and sound, their sleeping and eating patterns. You catalogue every change, every nuance.
They watched the guests begin to trickle in, wandering about the grounds of the Burrow and chatting, deciding they’d better head upstairs to get ready.
“Well, where’s he gone?”
had been another. Draco had been the last to stop running.
I will never let go of Draco Malfoy in leather trousers.
“Did I say anything?” Draco chided. “You’re the one standing there looking guilty as hell about
“You know what I want,” Harry whispered headily, dragging him up for a kiss. “I want you to fuck me, Draco,” he growled against Malfoy’s lips. “I want to be yours.”
. Harry mentally shrugs, and moves even closer. From here, he can see a small smattering of freckles on the bridge of Malfoy’s nose. It also occurs to him that he has probably never been this close before.
This sobered Draco immediately. “What d’you mean staying? For how long?” he demanded.
“You may as well be, Potter. Don’t ruin this for them,” Pansy warned, voice dripping with vitriol. “They’re my best friends, like family. You’ve somehow managed to weasel your way into Draco’s good graces because he’s let his guard down for a minute. His heart may have softened to you, but mostly I think he feels sorry for you.”
And that was the last thing he said before Blaise punched him square in the eye and slammed the door in his face. Harry reeled a bit before finding purchase on the stair rail. He supposed he shouldn’t linger much longer before an angry Blaise decided to make good on his threat to hex Harry’s bollocks off. He walked gingerly to the bottom of the street clutching his cheek.
“I feel like I’m going to be making that up to her forever,” Malfoy sighed. “Not because of her, but I feel horrible and I’m not sure I’ll ever stop. You know, I never wanted any of that. You have to know that.” Malfoy’s eyes met his in a plea. “I started writing to Luna, apologizing at first, and then I found I just liked talking to her. She’s -”
Luna, Dean, and Seamus are scattered about somewhere, and Harry vaguely wonders if he should look for them. Deciding against it, continuing to swim in the colors and sounds, he makes his way towards a back wall to find purchase. He’s content watching others dance, and sways along himself, feeling only slightly fuzzy.
“Reparations? Draco, if you’re going to be a healer because you want to help, that’s fine... but because ‘reparations should be made’? You can’t possibly think-”
“From the looks of it, I’d say I’m doing the same thing you are,” Draco offered.
“Of course.”
“Oh, okay. Er, do you know when he’ll be back?” Harry asked, a jealous feeling threatening to swallow him where he stood.
might have liked to hear in those moments of anguish.
“I love you,” Harry whispers. It’s the first time.
” Malfoy bristles, leaning into Harry.
The hallowed grounds of his alma mater have been a surprising comfort to Harry. No longer do the echoes in the halls harken back to horrors for him; no longer do the solid walls give way to explosions when he closes his eyes. This place has become home again, and he is rebuilding himself as well, brick by brick.
The grip on Draco’s robes faltered slightly, loosened, then reaffirmed itself with twice the strength, making the blonde gasp a bit as weight leaned into him and stole a bit more of his breath.
“I have another idea..”  He said grudgingly, turning his head to look at Draco over his shoulder.
He looked fascinated by the subject.  But then, Harry had to admit that he probably had a vaguely similar look and reaction on his face when Draco had explained about them to him.  Maybe he hadn't looked quite so...
"You are a reptile by virtue of being Slytherin."
"Are you enjoying yourself playing around with Potter?" Snape said, his voice sharp and cutting.  He closed the distance Draco had left open rather quickly so he could lower his voice into a hiss.  "You seem to forget who he is and what he means to this world."
“You’re welcome.” Harry said just as simply.
He didn't know what had happened to Harry.  Didn't understand why suddenly Harry seemed to want nothing to do with his old friends or the old causes he seemed to stand for.  Could not begin to explain it.  But he liked it...  Harry was proving to offer him some very much needed respite this year.  And he really needed that.
Harry nodded.  He picked up the letter carefully, turning it over in his hands a couple of times before he just held it flat between two palms.
"So you.. don't really care about me and Astoria.  Me and Harry."
Harry's brain took a few seconds to catch up, trying to make sense of what Draco was saying in reference to the Daily Prophet article before he realized he was talking about what he heard in the bathroom.
“Anything could be a help, Harry, it's all likely relevant somehow.”  Hermione said, slightly distracted as she read from the middle of a particularly large and thick volume.
The young man slid the box with the receipt tucked into a corner across the counter to Draco.  “But I'm sorry I missed you last time.  Hopefully if you need to come back again I'll be here.”
"Dumbledore came in.  You thought he was a psychiatrist or something.  But he told you you were a Wizard and could go to Hogwarts.  You told him about the things you could do.  Make animals and people do what you wanted them to do.  You tried to command Dumbledore to tell the truth about why he was there, you thought he was lying."  Harry paused, glancing towards the wardrobe, then back at Tom.  "He set your wardrobe on fire.  Made the things in your box rattle around.  Then pretty much told you to give them back.  You told him you could talk to snakes.  You looked disappointed that he wasn't more impressed."
"Erm...  You let me in once.  Me and Ron."  Harry turned his head a bit to look up at Draco, quirking one side of his mouth into a sheepish smile.  "We looked like Crabbe and Goyle, though.  You aren't the only student who's messed around with Polyjuice."
"You called me a reptile."  He grouched at Harry, stepping forward to the edge of the bath, now quite aware that he was naked and had been giving Harry a full view of it since he walked in.  All he could do now was pretend he didn't care, slipping into the water and moving as far away from Harry as he could get.
He was out before he even hit the floor.
----------------------------------
Harry was clearly very angry, and that in itself made all the noise worthwhile to Draco.  He knew why he was back, knew it wouldn't have taken that long for Harry to figure out he'd somehow gotten his wand out of his pocket.  Harry was a great many uncomplimentary and unkind things, but 'stupid' wasn't one of them.  More's the pity.
"Snape's...  With Voldemort."  Draco said, but he frowned slightly as he said it.  "I think.  He's supposed to be but..."
Not even Harry Potter.
"If you'd just kept your big mouth shut."
A heartfelt, soul pouring of a letter was not what he needed to write...
"Date."
Coffee in hand, he settled himself on the couch again, stretching his legs out to rest his feet, crossed at the ankles, against the top of the coffee table.  He retrieved his phone and checked the time.  It was early, probably too early for most people, but he figured that Head of the Auror Department would likely at least be awake, if not ready for business.
Snape spoke the few words in absolute deadpan, not looking at McGonagall as he spoke, even though the words were directed to her.
"So she read some of them.  And apparently someone saw you and I together in that Muggle park..."
Draco read the note, barking out a laugh that was far louder and ridiculous sounding than he meant to, but he couldn't help it.  He was not expecting that when Harry dropped the note on the table next to his arm just a few moments earlier.
The only room he didn't touch was Sirius'.  He knew that Sirius would have had no problem with him making it over like the rest of the house but Harry couldn't bring himself to erase the last bits of his worldly presence.
Borgin spoke in a tone of genial rebuke towards his young 'customer', using a small cloth to pick up the slimmest of silver rings.  There was no stone, no carving to it, just a very thin line of silver.  It did, somehow, seem to shine brighter than any of the other rings.  Somehow it seemed more attractive and more beguiling than even the most ornate piece on the tray.
Harry stayed silent for a few moments, weighing the other man’s words.  Parsing them for both subtext and disdain before realizing there was no reason to.  Old habits died hard.
"I wasn't completely sure.  But I knew Draco was coming here...  He didn't tell me but he isn't the most subtle with plans."  Narcissa allowed herself a small and obviously affectionate smile when speaking about her son's shortcomings.  "I thought there was a good chance he would be followed, and I wanted to be sure that those following him were put off the scent.  You sold Harry Potter something meaningless, I assume?"
Hermione smiled at that and Harry knew he had chosen the right thing to say.  Ron looked mollified as well and inwardly Harry breathed a sigh of relief.
of it, tend to be a little bit sentient.  A little bit alive...  They actually develop their own personalities and have their own sort of magic."
“...Or we find a way for you to kill him and get away with it...”
"Saying thank you to me.  It sounded like it hurt."
But the smell just got stronger, and Draco sat up quickly when he realized the noise that accompanied the smell was not from his neighbours...  He was hearing noise from actually inside of his apartment...
Harry smiled, nodding his head at what Draco said, fully believing he was right.  “It's just all the more reason to keep working.  To follow through on everything we're working towards.”
And he liked him.  A lot.
"Sorry."  Harry said, dropping his arms down so they weren't folded on his chest anymore.  "I didn't think you were actually REALLY afraid to be in here."
"Which is admirable to say the least.  And I'm certainly not going to stand in the way of you helping someone, especially when it's clearly so pure intentioned and offers an avenue in this that I had not considered.  While I did, of course, know of this plot as soon as it came about, I was not quite as informed about the toll it was taking on Draco himself.  And was not told just how bad things were for the Malfoy's in general.  Of course, they wouldn't want anyone to know that.  Knowing they felt themselves in a bad place would be dangerous for them, even more so than the danger they're already in."
"You don't have to do this."  Draco said after a few moments, his voice a little thick.
This was NOT happening again.
Both of them make a few hard realizations, but none of it seems to stop them moving forward.
Excited...
"Snape?"  Harry asked, his eyes narrowing a bit, his hackles raising.  "What does he have to do with anything?"
Blaise took a breath. “I’ve got a business opportunity in Portugal. I’ve been working with a team there on international magical law, ironing out some of the kinks. It could be great for me, for us… But it’s six months.” Blaise practically lit up talking about this new prospect.
The boy squeaks his thanks as he bounces out of the door and relays the message of admittance to the person in the hallway.
He realizes with jarring clarity he hasn’t considered the implications Lucius’ past might have on receiving treatment. He hasn’t had to; Draco has shouldered this burden entirely alone. The thought makes him ache to his bones.
“What a coincidence, so is mine. Probably for the best though. Could have been embarrassing, showing up in the same thing.” Harry grinned and gestured to his outfit, which left something to be desired in comparison to Malfoy’s tailored appearance. Malfoy smirked in response, and Harry’s stomach did an odd sort of backflip.
Draco rolled his eyes. “There is no good reason to use the word perpetrated,” he grumbled. “At least I have good taste. As I recall, you didn’t spurn my romantic advances in fifth year.”
“You are Draco then? I’ve heard so much about you.” The woman smiled and extended her hand to Draco. “I am Vitória.”
“No! No. I just… I thought you might see that I was serious,” Harry said, trying to keep the desperation out of his voice.
, he thought to himself, amused.
Harry felt absolutely shattered. While he knew that Draco wasn’t one to rush into any sort of commitment, he had never really imagined a scenario in which there was no promise of a future.
“No one else?” Draco breathes. “Harry, I-”
Draco stared for a minute, mouth agape. “No, of course not, I was only joking. I’ll get it myself.” He started to get up when Blaise grabbed his arm.
“That was amazing. I love you,” she whispered so only he could hear. “Now go talk to him.”
“Good morning to you too,” Harry half-laughs, fighting back the fear that this will undoubtedly turn everything on its head.
“Christ, Parkinson, when did you get so hostile? I’ve just asked where Draco is, I’m not asking for his hand in marriage,” Harry spat, feeling embarrassed he was coming across so obvious.
Draco used his body to guide Harry back to his bed, never breaking contact, peppering down the side of Harry’s neck and collarbone. Harry, drowsy with arousal, melted back onto the bed without any sort of resistance. Draco took his time, slowly unbuttoning Harry’s shirt, running his hand along the tan skin beneath it. He reached for Harry’s belt, dipping a hand below his waistband, questioning
in something,” Hermione responded, resting her face in her hands and looking at Harry over the table.
“We wake up every morning not knowing what the day might hold for us, what we might lose and what we might gain. But if everyday, we take a chance on someone or something we really love, we need never fear for the future.
“Pansy, I think I’ve fucked up massively.” Draco cradled his head in his hands miserably. He sat down at the kitchen table, out of the way of Pany’s path of levitating glassware. She was there helping him move his belongings out of the shared flat.
Harry sat down across from Draco at a small table in their favorite coffee shop. He ran a hand through his hair, contemplating whether or not to tell the truth or just buy himself some time. He glanced over at Draco, who looked genuinely concerned, and felt something break inside of him. Harry knew he had to tell him, despite the fact he wanted to stare at Draco for a little longer and just be in his presence before the inevitable explosion that was to come.
“You’re going to be fun,” Blaise whispered into his hair. “I’ve missed you so much, my love.”
Draco flushed slightly at this. Taking a glance around, Harry realized he did quite like how the flat had been decorated; the wallpaper that hung in the kitchen was a deep blue baroque pattern with golden stars and moons, the furniture an eclectic mix of mid-century and lived-in comfort. It was, well, nice. Harry looked up at Draco.

“I’m just telling you that as a man who’s spent time in the presence of a woman romantically, I don’t understand why you were together for so long. It’s not as though she oozes feminine mystique.”
Pansy ignored his jibe.
“If I wanted the chance to
“Hermione, Draco’s been dating Blaise for like four years. He wasn’t jealous. Maybe he was just upset that I’d left him to fend for himself,” Harry chided.
“I didn’t, that was just the question I really wanted to ask. I don’t actually care about your breakup, I think She-Weasley is abrasive and boorish, not unlike her brothers. Though I have to admit,
Outside on the plaza, people were speaking to each other in a myriad of languages, all blending together in a pleasant hum. The colors were rich and vibrant, and Draco thrilled at the blend of modern and historic architecture at every turn. He understood how Blaise could love it here so much. The city was incredible and alive and so, so beautiful.
He began: “Ron. Hermione. I am so grateful to be a part of what you’ve done here today. While nobody is surprised that you’ve chosen each other, there has been nothing better than to witness you make it official.
“Harry. You’re daft if you think I would waste my time on something that wasn’t, to use your word,
“I wouldn’t trouble yourself over it.”
Draco looked down at their adjoined hands, and thoughtfully studied Harry’s; his tan skin was callused and a bit rough, Draco’s own pale and well-maintained. He smiled at the contrast. He also suddenly realized this was a rather tender moment, and couldn’t decide whether or not to let go. He decided against it and continued to sit in silence until he noticed Harry was nodding off.
Harry shrugged. “Well, I guess I sort of did. It’s become kind of sacred to me I think. I’ve never recognized anyone here, and it’s in such a remote little corner of London. I usually come here when I need to work through something.”

I was lightly inspired by "The Ballad of Love & Hate" by the Avett Brothers, "Supercut" by Lorde, and "Saturdays" by Twin Shadow, and have thus listened to these songs probably more than 100 times while writing this short and sweet little thing. I really wrote this for no other reason than my own enjoyment, but in the process I ended up experiencing and working through a major loss/life event while doing so. You have all my gratitude for reading.
Earlier that night he’d sat on the fire escape of his flat, thinking about how stupid it was for him to keep avoiding parties on the off-chance Ginny would be there. It was almost a given she’d be at anything he was invited to, unless she was traveling with the Harpies. It also seemed stupid to still be pining away for someone who clearly had no problem moving on. She’d ended things around a year ago, though it wasn’t a clean break. The aftermath was peppered with various instances of what Harry referred to as “backsliding,” wherein they’d get together for a chat, Harry would beg her to reconsider, and they’d inevitably end up sleeping together.
married.”  Neville said, his ears practically turning purple at this point.  “But it was...  It was an utter disaster.  We divorced not long afterwards... Quietly, though.”
Harry sat back a bit against the couch, brushing his thumb against the back of Draco's hand as he pondered what he had just said.  He wasn't sure what the end goal was.  Initially it had been to help Draco with killing Dumbledore so that Voldemort would leave him alone.  But now that he thought about it, it really was an unfinished plan.
Which meant that for the past week since Draco had started to loosen up and start to talk to him without being suspicious, he'd been having the best time.
Draco smiled as the dark haired man got up to go to the sink and wash his hands as well.  "It's not fancy to wash your hands before you eat.  It's actually the most basic of hygiene."
Harry just smiled, reaching over to pick up a piece of toast, speaking just loud enough for Draco to hear as he spread jam onto it.  “Ron and Hermione both think it would look suspicious to you if I suddenly stopped talking to you after you told me about the Vanishing Cabinet.  I agreed it would be suspicious and I should continue 'pretending'” Harry paused to double frame the word in air quotes before he continued, smiling even more. “to be your friend.”
-----------------------------------------------------------
His breathing came short and hard as he looked around wildly, twisting when he heard a twig snap, his heart rising to his throat as he heard a soft muttered noise behind Him and he turned again to try and see what it was.
-------
“Right...  yeah...”  Harry nodded, huffing out a short breath of air.  “It really was.  And you're right, we should talk.”
It was a gamble and Harry knew it.  They'd been dancing around these subjects, both of them saying things that slightly leaned towards them, but never coming right out and being direct.  But having seen the Dark Mark on Draco's arm, Harry had no doubt now that whatever Draco was doing was something Voldemort had asked him to do.  And right then he couldn't think of anything he wanted more than to help Draco with whatever it was.
“I need Slughorn's memory..”  Harry said, hoisting himself up onto the counter to sit, thinking rather smugly about how horrified Aunt Petunia would be if she knew.
"I'll be back."  Harry said, smoothing his hand against his back.  "Don't worry."
They both fell quiet for a few moments, both of them probably thinking the same things, replaying so many fights, so many tears, so much hatred and yet so much tenderness, so much understanding and so much warmth that they had shared.
"No I'm serious." Harry shifted off his knees to sit on the floor with the other boy, watching him carefully.  "I heard what you said."  He repeated, leaning forward a bit.  "Whatever you're doing, it's not because you want to, that much is bloody obvious.  I don't care what you've been doing, I just want to help you out of it."
"Malfoy... Hey, c'mon."  Harry shifted up off the other boy, giving his arms a yank to get him to his feet.  "We gotta get out of here."  He glared over at Myrtle who looked like the cat who ate a canary, ready to start shouting at any moment and draw more people into this.
"TV is... Hrm..." Harry scrunched his mouth to one side as he thought.  "That's a hard one to describe...  Without trying to get into all the mechanics behind it- A TV is a box that displays moving pictures on it with sound and everything.  Like a play but in your own home and not live in front of you, it's just pictures, the people aren't really there.  Merlin, thats a tough one to explain.  I'll just show you sometime."
"I didn't think we'd get married and raise a family or anything." Harry said, the words coming out harder than he meant them, but something in his chest was squeezing tighter than was comfortable.
Harry looked over his shoulder at Draco, regarded him silently for a few moments and then went back to what he was doing.
"You never did anything to deserve having this task forced on you."
Draco still hesitated.  He'd only been in the Forest once before and that was years ago.  He didn't have particularly fond memories of it and he knew that even those not fond memories were quite light compared to what else was in there.
Draco couldn't help but smile.  It was a wane smile, but a smile all the same.  “Yeah I only sort of fought against him.  At that point, Longbottom, everything I did for Voldemort's 'cause' was half hearted.  Just enough to make it look like I cared...”
“So you went out.”  Harry said, looking from the cup to Draco again, his anger seeming to ebb away.  “Good.  You had me worried with what you said at the cafe.”
Snape raised both eyebrows, a slightly sickly smile curving onto his thin lips.
But what bothers Harry more than anything else is knowing that nothing he does right now is truly private....
Draco shook his head rather forcibly, not wanting to entertain that thought for too long.  He'd lost his wand, it was gone.  That in itself had made his plans for a new life in the muggle world rather necessary.  He would NEVER show his face to Ollivander again.  Not ever.  So a new wand, a good one anyway, was out of the question.
The two of them started arguing together which gave Harry time to just tune out and absorb everything he had just heard.  There was a spell to fix the cabinet, that part turned out to be incredibly easy.  But unfortunately it was incredibly easy because the spell itself was incredibly hard.
After a short break, they all regrouped in the cleaned up tent for the first Technical Bake.  He and Harry had experimented with this, since no one could prepare in advance for the Technical.  They weren't sure, at first, if Draco would have to know what something was supposed to look like in order for the magic to work.
"Thanks so much."  Draco said with a bit of his usual sharpness, but he smiled slightly at the same time, picking up the mug and leaning forward over it, resting it in his hands on his knees.  "I know it's true though."
"This is your fault."
He was glad when they were done and heading out.  Hermione and Ron pushing ahead to lead the first year Gryffindor's to the portrait of the Fat Lady, while Harry lingered again, managing to fall into step behind Draco and his two hulking cronies.
"It's actually not half bad."  Paul said as though he couldn't believe he had to say those words at all.  "You've got a perfect bake, your flavours are spot on.  I'm not sure I like a coffee cake as a wedding cake but it does all work together.  Good effort."
“What?”  Harry said, leaning forward a bit, having not heard the quiet words.
Draco deflated a little at the implication.  Harry seemed to feel the wash of uncertainty that came over the blonde next to him and it made him bristle rather quickly, shooting a nasty black look at Tom.  “That isn't fair.”
He shuddered hard, grimacing and pushing back against a fresh wave of panic that swept through him.  It wasn't as serious, he could tell.  This one was an empty threat, he could shrug it off even if it was uncomfortable.
"Alright, Potter.  You've made your views quite clear.  Believe it or not, I do want to help Draco and if I am willing to help him with his task from Voldemort then I am willing to help find a means of communication with his mother."
Draco nodded as Neville spoke, still looking in the window, but personally quite proud of himself for understanding what Neville was explaining.  At least in the most basic sense.
He blinked in the dark, his eyes accustomed to it, but still unable to see much.  “Mimir?”  He said groggily, his half asleep brain trying to put pieces together of why the owl might be back already.  “I didn't think you'd be back for a day or two...”
"Draco....". Harry said the other boy's name with a bit of an exasperated groan.  He wasn't mad at HIM, but he certainly wasn't that happy right then.  "I didn't think you and I could be a long term thing.  No one knows, no one's ever known.  And Merlin himself knows we can't even get along half the time no matter what we're doing.  But what does that have to do with me getting married and raising a family?"
--Along with Inktober, it is Fictober! Following a prompt list from Tumblr I'm going to write short fics based around those prompts. A friend doing the same is titling each fic with the prompt so I'm totally copying that. ;)
Both of them stayed motionless, nothing about this situation making any sense to either of them, especially not with their minds whirling and senses pricking in a way that seemed simultaneously perfectly natural and completely absurd.
Harry, in turn, invites Draco to Slughorn's Christmas Party, which certainly is NOT acting like everything is normal...  But how could Draco say no?
“Weird?  Stupid?”
Someone brave would not have clutched at each of harry's letters like they were life preservers and laid awake at night in agonies of guilt for letting them go unanswered.
And then he picked up the sack and the suitcase and walked back to the Leaky Cauldron.  He stepped through the dim interior, not looking around, and not glancing back once before he walked out the door onto the Muggle street, turned right, and started his new life.
Harry slid his hand up into Draco’s silky blonde hair, rubbing into the strands for a few moments as his eyes roamed over the other boy’s face.  This news seemed to have taken ten years off his life, he couldn’t remember the last time he’d seen him without a crease between his eyes.  The dark circles under them were still there and likely would be for awhile, if not always, but the stress was gone from his face.  He leaned forward, pulling Draco’s head in so he could kiss him again, making a low noise as their mouths slid together in practiced unison to fit together perfectly.
“So I have to wait, then?  You said long term plans.”  Draco couldn't help feeling a little disappointed.  He was loathe to admit that he was thoroughly interested in something Muggle related.  But 'electronics', as Neville had called them, seemed terribly interesting and not at all what he was expecting of this world.
"You feel so...  Nnn..." Harry rumbled the noise out, his eyes jerking up as he heard Draco laugh softly, frowning at him.  "What?"
Draco's words came out tight and hard, like he'd had to squeeze them through a tiny space in his chest.  Then he started to cry.
If Harry helped him.  If Harry was actively trying to help him complete this task.  To kill Dumbledore, the only Wizard Voldemort knew he couldn't best.... Would Harry still have to die?  Would Voldemort still want him gone?
“Isn't it, though.”  Harry sighed out a low breath, turning his eyes up for a moment then looked back at Draco.  “You will ONLY communicate with Nott, however.  And you will only do so at night when people won't see an owl swooping into or out of your window.  Your owl is free to hunt at night, as well.  I wouldn't make you try and keep him in or just use him for messages.  But if you start using him during the day we'll remove him and you'll have to communicate via Floo.”
Draco had stopped trying to seize Harry's arm, but he did nudge the other boy into walking up the hallway as he looked around and listened.  He was clearly trying to process so Harry stayed quiet, looking around with more interest now knowing that this was Malfoy Manor.
"And Thestrals in the woods."  Harry said, picking up a sickle that was on the thick fur rug.
“You do not.”  Harry's voice was skeptical, then he laughed as he got to his feet and saw the look on Draco's face.  “How in Merlin do you know how to do the washing up?”
"  He flicked his wand to the left, to the right, then forward...
resourceful.”  Draco muttered to himself, pocketing his wand and turning back to the living room of his new home.  “I don't need anyone's help.”
"I have to say, I'm surprised."  Paul said, having tasted Draco's cake and nodded over it.  "It's beautifully done."  He didn't offer any criticism or any other compliments or thoughts past that.  He did, however, give Draco another suspicious look as he walked away.
They had both risked everything, absolutely everything, to try and stay in sparse contact with each other since the end of Year 6.  Harry used a shoddy replica of the coins Hermione had made for the DA, his magic no where near as good as hers, but it worked.
Draco glanced towards the door when Harry shouted at him and smiled just a little bit before turning back to the television.
He sat up in bed, both hands clutched to his head, panting and drenched in sweat, his arms shaking as he lowered them from his now perfectly normal scar and forehead.
Draco raised one shoulder in a slight shrug, scratching his cheek.  "He's asked me a few questions.  He also said that he'd been planning on how to help me since he made the Unbreakable Vow.  That he had a plan in place."
“I'm sorry...  This must all sound very strange.  I assure you it's more that I have been living under a rock than I am crazy.  I don't know much about laptops.  Computers.  The internet...  All of it.  But I am looking to change that.  Could you please just sell me a laptop that I can learn the internet on.  Does that make sense?”
From there he used his wand a few times, getting things to the way they were supposed to be before putting it in the oven.
Judging was fun.  And he had a chance then to talk to some of the other contestants.  Without having to find a way to make it look like he was baking when he wasn't, it was all a lot more relaxed.
The fifth day Harry sent another letter, pleading with him to come to Grimmauld Place, telling him that they had to talk and he couldn't put any of it in a letter but he had information and thought he could help.
“You aren't taking my wand.  How will I defend myself?”
That speech got him a look from the corner of Neville's eye.  A small smile.  Enough to know that he was being easily forgiven.
"Because if I don't believe that things are going to be okay, I won't be able to find a reason to keep trying and keep fighting.  And I'm fighting, remember?  This is my fight, too."
“Oh yes I do.”  Draco said, folding his arms as he looked at Harry.  “You drag me around town my first day here, force me into a restaurant, try and change the entire way I've lived for the past seven years just because you don't think you like the SOUND of the way I've been living--”
“Draco told me.”
He couldn't breathe.  Couldn't think.
Draco looked up at Harry in slight confusion for a few moments.  Harry didn't have to see him naked to know how tall he...  Oh.
Harry shook his head, moving over to sit down on the couch, tugging Draco along with him.  “How do you tell when someone is going to do that.  It's great I can push you out but I'd rather not give anyone any time to look at my mind.”
He panicked for a moment, jumping up from his chair, his breath hard and fast as he thought his SCAR was burning again...
It didn't change anything in Draco's mind.  Harry had always been too nice and too forgiving.  Too ready to believe the good in people without the bad, but still...
His school mates all said they'd seen him during the battle, some even said they could have sworn they saw him alive at the end of it.  But when there was nary a trace of him turned up they started wondering if perhaps they hadn't seen him.  It had been the most hectic and stressful of nights.  It had been a BATTLE, after all.  They couldn't count on their memories being entirely clear.
Hermione had gotten the same treatment, but had taken it even harder than Ron had, retreating tearfully to the girls dorm without another word after asking Harry how he could have not known it was missing before now.  Harry's reply had been two steps beyond unkind.
------------------------
Harry pretended to look ashamed, but grinned as he did it which made Ron laugh and Hermione swat at him and start a lecture about the importance of school work.
Draco shouted over the indignant shrieks and screams and insults of the Lady Black as he and Harry, accompanied by a worried looking Kreacher, hauled her portrait down the stairs into the depths of the basement.
Draco made a face, dusting his hands off.  “No.  He's trying to.  I'm trying to as well but I don't know what I'm doing and I don't think he really does either.
Re-telling in AU what happens when Harry finds Draco in the bathroom in book six. It wasn't supposed to be a chaptered fic but as I was writing it I realized there was no way to say everything in one part. So we'll see where it takes us!
"I was intense about my male friends.  She commented once or twice about that...  'You're so intense with your friends, Draco.  They'll get the wrong idea...'" He paused and chuckled, folding his arms in his lap.   "She said it once and I just looked at her.  Just silently met her eyes and held her gaze...  She never said it again.  So I think that was enough to either tell her what she needed to know, or give her an inkling that she didn't WANT to know and to leave it be."
Harry smiled at Draco, and Draco smiled back at Harry.
Draco- Television.  Can I ask one of the Aurors to make a withdrawal at Gringotts for me and change it for Muggle money?
“You best hope I do what you ask, then.  Nott's house burns Floo messages as they arrive so Owl Post is the only shot you have.”
"A subtle enchantment."  Borgin said, already laying the ring and cloth on the counter, pushing it towards Harry by the fabric.  "It alters the perception of the wearer.  Opens their mind to things they had never before considered."
“It's alright.”  Harry said with a nod, reaching over to squeeze Draco's shoulder for a moment, smoothing over the curve of it as he drew his hand away.  “I know what you mean.  Maybe we don't worry about the actual.. act... just yet.  If we continue as we are maybe Tom will actually ask you for something different.  I think we should focus on
“Well we've got nothing to worry about.”  Ron said, sitting back into his chair again.  “No way Malfoy could get that accomplished, could he?”
Chapter Three- A problem with Scorpius prompts Harry to contact Draco to come in for a meeting.  But Scorpius is definitely the reason for the meeting, Harry takes the opportunity to return something that rightfully belongs to Draco.
--Along with Inktober, it is Fictober! Following a prompt list from Tumblr I'm going to write short fics based around those prompts. A friend doing the same is titling each fic with the prompt so I'm totally copying that. ;)
Harry really wasn’t sure why he was sharing so much of himself with Malfoy. Wondering if someone had slipped him Veritaserum, he rubbed his forehead, feeling self-conscious; Malfoy wouldn’t deign to say something so foolish.
He wanted to hear it again.
“I didn’t lie exactly. We are friends. I just want it to be something more. I can’t help it. And I think if you were honest with yourself, you’d want that too.” Harry knew full well he was going too far and risking too much, but it was too late to stop.
“Sure you are,” Draco snarled half-heartedly. He was glad to be with Blaise, however awkward the initial encounter. “You know, if my colleagues looked like that, I’d probably have them back to mine as well.”
“You were never gone, just hiding for a bit. Heartbreak can do that. It seems like Draco really helped to heal you,” Luna said sagely.
“Come on,” he said, helping the other man to his feet, “let’s get you home.”
popped into his head, and Harry immediately scolded himself.
Harry took a step back in disbelief. The last thing he wanted was for Draco to feel sorry for him. He shook his head, reminding himself that Parkinson had no idea what she was talking about; she hadn’t seen the way they were together. Or maybe she had, and knew Harry's very presence had disrupted the relationship. He knew he had to talk to Draco.
“Look, it’s not that it’s not a lovely idea. I’m just not sure that I’ve ever seen myself as someone who gets married. To anyone. Isn’t our being together enough? Can’t we be committed to each other without all of
______
“See it through
“Are you serious? That bastard! I can’t believe I let that berk land a fucking punch. I could murder him.” Harry looked incredulous and angry, and it was more endearing to Draco than anything he could imagine.
“Hard to believe you aren’t spent already. Ready for another round so soon?” he hissed.
Nervous he was going to come before they even began, Draco ran his hand up and down his shaft, gently slicking it. He lined himself up with Harry’s tight hole and pushed forward carefully.
“Can’t imagine why,” Harry said innocently, shoving Malfoy’s shoulder and receiving a glare in return. “Look, it’s only weird if you make it weird. Just be…
As for Harry, he took his time walking home, leisurely wandering the cobblestone streets and letting his mind wander. He felt mad with frustration that Malfoy had been dancing around the idea of having a boyfriend the entire night. And not only that but sharing a flat together. It felt strangely like he was being led on, but admittedly he’d been out of the game awhile. Reminding himself that this was Malfoy and not some bloke at the pub, Harry decided he was just letting his emotions get the better of him. Additionally, he decided it was for the best not to owl. It was probably pushing his luck to imagine the two of them could be civil to each other for more than one night.
“Well, er, I’ll just be going then-” he said, backing up slowly. Curse this Gryffindor impulsivity.
“Harry, I love you. I love you so much. But… no. You’re going to be an incredible professor, and I can’t hold you back anymore. I have to let you go.” Tears stream down Draco’s face and Harry thinks he’s never seen him so miserable. At that moment, he feels so bereft all he can do is watch as Draco leaves their home.
“I don’t actually,” Draco interjected. “Have Blaise, I mean. He was sleeping with one of his colleagues. And he’s staying in Portugal, so there’s that.”
“Are we actually doing this?” Draco asked, as he adjusted his tie in the mirror for the tenth time that morning. He was sweating profusely, and Malfoy’s didn’t sweat in public.
“I wasn’t aware you were the gatekeeper of my thoughts,” Draco interrupts. “And while you may have given your royal pardon, Potter, maybe the rest of the world isn’t so keen to see me as anything more than a death eater disgrace. It will be even worse for my father, and you’re a fool if you think otherwise. We’ll be lucky if anyone decides they even want to touch our case.”
“Something like that?” Harry muttered as realization dawned. “Ah. So you’re- you’re together then?” Harry asked, feeling stupid. He wasn’t sure why he felt so gravely disappointed by this news. He’d had a really good time with Malfoy tonight, but something about this revelation had pulled him back into reality. Malfoy had been living a life outside of Harry’s awareness for a solid seven years; until tonight Harry probably hadn’t even existed in his consciousness. Harry felt the warmth that had been pooling in his stomach fade into something cold and arresting.
They left the pub tipsy and cheerful, Ron and Hermione inviting Harry back to theirs for some late-night takeout. Draco, of course, had to be getting back before Blaise started to worry.
“Luna’s amazing, and she must see something in you. She’s never been one to let the past stand in her way,” Harry said gently. It took everything he had not to reach out to the other man but instead he chose to look down at his own shoes, his trainers an interesting contrast to Malfoy’s polished oxfords.
“What did we come here for then? Just to keep sneaking around?”
Luna didn’t respond but instead smiled softly. Harry was filled with so much affection for her at that moment, he wanted to tell her everything, but he suspected she already knew anyway.
“I wanted to tell you, I think... If for no other reason than I’ve got to accept what’s happening. I’ve never been very good at that, you’ll recall.” Draco smiles weakly, his eyes puffy and red-rimmed. Harry knows he’s alluding to the fight they’d both put up when it came to just being together. Meeting in secret to kiss and touch and feel had been one thing, accepting it was a
“Wrapped up?” Harry wrinkled his nose.
“You’re nervous,” he says, blinking. “You shouldn’t be. You’re Harry Potter, you can do anything you want.”
“Yes. Going on about four years or so now. Our flat’s just west of here.” Draco paused for a beat, appearing to steel himself. “Look, I know we don’t have the best track record but tonight was… passable. If you wanted to, I don’t know, owl me or something, I wouldn’t mind.”
“Draco, I…” It was all Harry could do to keep from telling the other man everything. He sat there, fighting every impulse in his body, desperate to tell Draco that maybe he wasn’t really attracted to men in general, it was mostly just
“Fuck, you feel so good, Draco,” Harry breathes, licking and biting to punctuate his thrusts. This is a different kind of desperation, one that he hasn’t known before.
“Well thank god, Potter, I’ve been able to think of little else. Simply waiting by the window each day.”
“No, no you’re right. Merlin, you’re right.” He grabs Harry’s face and nestles it into his chest. “I suppose I’ve got a lot to work through with this.” A sharp intake of breath. “Harry, can you just take it for what it is then? That I’m not in a good place for it just yet? That it doesn’t mean I never will be.”
Not to mention how much time they spent whispering together.  Stopping as soon as Harry got close to them.  Or the even more annoying 'meaningful looks' they gave each other often when Harry did decide to say something.  It was annoying.  Anyone would find that annoying, it wasn't just him being intolerant.
Instead he took in a breath and let it out slowly, trying to temper his emotions and bring them back down again.  There was no doubt now that Voldemort was paying extremely close attention to him and what he was doing, that even if all he could do was feel Harry's emotions and do whatever 'peeking' was that he had mentioned in the dream, he was very much present in whatever was going on.
Chapter 13 Summary- Harry finds it far easier to make good with Hermione and Ron, and it even turns out better than he thought...
-----------------------
"She told me I couldn't see you.  That our family has 'enough trouble' as it is and adding this into it...  So I didn't write.  I honestly didn't think you'd be so persistent, though.  I thought if I didn't answer you that would be it."
But it seemed that he didn't now...
Draco managed that, trying to say it like he was cool and calm but Harry laughed at the look of happiness on the blonde boy's face that he was sure was mirrored in his own.
"I can't do it.  I don't see how I could.  All my ideas have failed and they all revolved around third parties.  I don't know how else to..  I couldn't just walk up to him and...  I can't just..."
Harry shook his head, running both hands through his hair.  "You better sit down."
"I thought you liked Weasley and Granger."  Draco spoke the words far more directly than anything else he'd said to Harry thus far about his shift in personality.  They came out before he even thought about it.  And they hung there in silence for long enough that his heart started to flutter in his chest just a little bit.
"I would have broken your door down to do that."  Harry said in a low voice Draco had never heard before.
"Even if you had instructions in your potions book, you still followed them correctly and made the best potion.  It's yours, you should keep it.  You'll need it."
He turned slowly to take it all in, then made a low noise as he looked up to the glass ceiling that filtered in green light from the lake above them.  Everything in the Slytherin Common Room was a little darker, dimmer and yet somehow seemed to lend itself so much more to private conversations.
"You don't actually want to leave."  Harry said, one side of his mouth quirking up.
“That can't be Neville...”  Draco said, but he knew Harry didn't have any reason to lie to him.  “He's an Auror now?  One of YOUR Aurors.”
And he couldn't help but wrinkle his nose.  Couldn't help running a finger along the mantle and making a noise of disgust at the rolled dust that collected as he did it.  Couldn't help recoiling from the smudgy dirty window when he went to look out of it.
They packed off to King's Cross not long afterwards, Harry already having forgotten his conversation with Hermione by the time they arrived.
"And do you?"
"Next option?"  Draco said almost immediately, arching one eyebrow as he looked at Harry and smiling when the dark haired boy laughed.
"I think I have to let Snape help me."  Draco said, reaching to pick up the sickle that Harry had put down on the table, rolling it against his thumb and forefinger.
“I saw you stay after one of the Slub Club meetings.”  He said, his eyes turning to the side a bit as he tried to remember. “You asked Slughorn about something you came across but couldn't get any information about, I think.  Something like that.”
"Do what?"
“I said, that isn't fair.  You've put him in the situation he is.  Purposely, most likely.  Setting him an impossible task that makes him even more alone than he already is.”
He hadn't ventured out yet...  Hadn't gone back to the electronics store and hadn't even considered getting a computer to really start to use his internet.
“I always have been.”  Neville, turned his mug so he could pick it up by the handle with his other hand, taking a sip and making a grateful noise before he continued.  “But I was pretty crap about speaking up, so no one ever really knew.  You have to be observant when you're a wimpy kid who's prone to being pushed around. It's a defence mechanism.”
Certainly, he hadn't forgotten the feelings, but he'd forgotten he'd written it.  Forgotten that at one point in time he was desperate to tell Harry.  To be completely and totally honest with him.  As time went on he'd changed his mind about wanting to say it.  Changed his mind about that level of honesty.  He'd never written it in another letter....
Draco smiled a bit, opening his box of chips as they got settled.  He wasn't going to take that as an absolute invitation, but he certainly liked that Harry had said he'd show him sometime.  He picked up a chip to put into his mouth, then made a low noise as he bit into it.
?” Draco asked, running his hands to the back of his neck and turning his head up to look at Harry, still mostly supported by his elbows.  “I lose all sense of reason and stand on a table swinging the light around while proclaiming I'm a wizard and all should bow down to me?  None of any of this has been anywhere near as difficult and challenging as you seemed to want me to believe.”
Draco stilled he hands, setting the ball of parchment down as he sighed.  "My mother.." He started, trying to bolster the courage up to actually explain it.  To be brave and just spit out the whole story.
---------------------------------------------
"Ten points to Gryffindor for stating the absolute obvious."  Draco said, his voice coming out sharp and hurt and it made him madder to hear it.  He pushed his hair out of his eyes to glare at Harry.  "You were GONE, I thought I was alone and then you GRABBED me?  In the fucking Forbidden Forest!  Who wouldn't be scared by that!?"
Unfortunately it seems like their next steps are in the 'horrible but necessary' category.  Which is going to prove to be a trial for them both...
Draco and Harry were in a train compartment all to themselves, having kicked out a group of first years so they could have a private place to talk.  Ron and Hermione were still doing Prefect duty which meant they were safe to do whatever they wanted for a little while longer before once again attempting to behave like 'normal'.
They broke apart, after several long full minutes had passed, Draco taking in a sharp breath that was half need of oxygen and half shock at the sudden loss of heat and tingling sparks from everywhere their mouths had been touching.
Harry let out a noise of surprise as Draco leaned in and kissed him again, bruising and hard.  His teeth caught Harry's lower lip, biting into it roughly and giving it a tug before he let it go with a slick noise.  "I can shut you up if I need to do so."
“That makes sense...”  Harry said, still looking around a fair bit.  “For Hogwarts, anyways, it makes perfect sense by Hogwarts standards.”
"So.. Now..?"
He really did need lessons on that.
And then their eyes broke, another rush of movement, and he didn't see him again until the battle at Hogwarts.
Draco laughed, smacking at the other boy as Harry straightened up to walk away, waving to him as he headed back to his Common Room.  Draco stayed in the window ledge a little while longer, waiting for his stomach to stop squirming happily at the way Harry had leaned into him.
Draco heard a soft shifting and scraping sound and he could tell Harry was getting to his feet.  Everything in him clenched as he imagined the other man walking away from the door.  He put his face in his hands as tears welled up and over in his eyes, finally pushed too far, the fear dissolving into absolute devastation.
" He whispered, flicking his wand, even though he hadn't wanted to make light in the woods and attract more attention to himself.  He looked further with his wand lit, trying to see the other boy, trying to find any trace of him.
Harry was quiet for a few moments and Draco let him be.  He could see he was thinking and thinking hard, he just hoped some of what he said would sink in a bit.
"What he was doing, often what he was feeling.  A couple of times I was in Nagini and seeing through her eyes as she moved around.  I was her when she attacked Ron's father."
They were in the overnight before the second day of filming for the Show-Stopper, Harry had apparated to him after he was done work for the day.
"Has been since the day after we found out.  That first day we were just trying to figure out the how and make a guess as to what they were doing.  Then we started pulling everything as quietly and casually as we could."
With a sigh, Harry leaned back in his chair, trying to make sense of all this together.  Unfortunately it was like he had a bunch of different pieces from several different puzzles, so nothing fit.
Draco raked his teeth over his lower lip as he looked at the other boy, meeting the level green gaze and sighing after a few moments, well and truly giving over to the desire to share it all with him. “Voldemort set me a task to do this year.”  He started, looking at Harry for a few moments, then turning his head to glance around the room.  “It's big... it's... awful.”
Harry waited, watching Draco who seemed unable to do anything.  After time stretched in silence too long, he held one hand out towards Draco in invitation, speaking quietly.  “Disarm me, Draco. Whether I won it or not, it’s always been and always will be yours.”
“I would have been fine.”  He eventually muttered, lifting his mug to take a larger gulp of coffee, but then pushed it away.  “You're both acting like I've never lived by myself before and need taking care of.  I have, as it happens, been living on my own for years and not once have I died.  Miraculous as that may seem.”
Draco chuckled and shook his head, running a hand through his hair.  “Brilliant.  Really..”
"If I had wings maybe that would do... Something.  I don't know."
"YOU don't know if you can trust Snape."  Harry said with a laugh, shaking his head and flopping back onto the bed on his back.  "You of all people.  Can't decide if you should trust Snape or not.  That's rich."
“You've been watching me...  You know...”
Then he opened the drawer again.  It took him a full couple of minutes of sorting through the letters until he found the one he had written first.
They were watching 'The Great British Baking Show', something that had become a bit of an evening ritual whenever both of them had a night free to spend together.  Draco, over the past few weeks, had started to get more vocal about his belief that he could absolutely be a contestant on the show and win.
Harry spoke sort of quietly an in a voice that made Draco tingle with pride, looking to the dark haired boy with the sly smile.  "I try my best."
A fight with Harry...
"No..." Draco said warily, shaking his head a bit.  "She hasn't been to see me or sent any owls since she turned up at the Manor unannounced.  .... Why?"
So his mother came to Malfoy Manor to talk to him.  Finding him gone, she had asked the House Elf where he'd gone.  When she heard he was meeting Harry at Grimmauld Place she started to snoop in the study.   Had found the drawer full of unsent letters.
Oooo....  Draco's eyes narrowed and he turned himself around quickly, his back to Harry once more as he resumed working, or at least trying to work, absolutely fuming over the dismissive way the other boy was treating him.
“I think I just got stuck there.”  Harry said with a sheepish smile.  “The Ministry is being generous but we have to account for every dollar we're putting out just to make sure we know where it's all being spent.  I just didn't quite connect the dots to the fact you really WERE asking for your own money which is yours to do as you wish with.  Oh and...  If you want internet I can figure something out for you.”
"I wish you were in Slytherin."  Draco said as he sat down on one of the couches.
"Are you going to tell them everything?"  Draco got up as well, walking Harry back to the dorm entrance to see him off.
Draco nearly jumped out of his skin, the harsh words coming from across the room and he turned to just stare at Harry, having forgotten he was there.  "I wasn't talking to you, Potter!'
“I said I'd be here soon.”  Harry said, smirking a bit and tilting his head towards Draco's phone that was charging on the counter.  “Check your texts, you can't argue with me.”
“Potter.
Harry did think for a moment, he wanted to make sure he made the right decision.  It was far easier to make fast choices when it was for himself, but making a decision for someone else who was in danger was much harder.  Eventually, he nodded his head, meeting Dumbledore's eyes again.
“A pamphlet then.  A booklet.  'How to Survive the Muggle World – For Wizards'.”  Draco said, picking up the 'remote' as per the instructions left for him.
He wasn't in the mood to play 'good boy' to his mother.
"Then you're okay.  I meant 'tell me you're okay' like you aren't mortally wounded or something.  I know that... Not everything is okay."
"Kingsley thinks he was imperiused."
And very welcome, he had to admit.
"Well...  Anyways."  Draco said, clearing his throat and softening his tone a bit.  "The point I'm making is that you didn't really have the luxury of being able to explore something like that, given everything else you were up against.  You got shunted into normal life when you were 20, after all the trials were done, all the clean up and all the rebuilding of the world was finally finished.  With the pressure of the whole WORLD watching to see what you were going to do next.  I think the Weasley's expectations of you are a little too high."
“You're just as Purebood as I am.  How in the world are YOU going to teach me Muggle things?”
"This bath smells.. odd."  Draco said, opting to focus on the scent of the water being odd rather than the fact that he was in it with Harry Potter.
And the thing about fair wages was non-sense as well. What did they need wages for? What would they spend it on?
The more Luna talked, the happier the little elf became and by the time Luna took her leave, Winky was a very contented elf.
They were on a beach and a small cottage was visible in the distance at the crest of a sand dune.
‘Well’, Luna said, ’A space capsule is as good a vessel as any and we can surround Dobby by all the things he loved by making a beautiful colourful shroud.’
To see Harry so distracted over this quest to send Dobby’s remains into space, was both infuriating and touching at the same time, but he supposed that characterised most of their relationship.
‘I would be grabbing that too’, Winky thought blushing, if only she had the nerve to do something like that.
‘I guess, my father will be in serious trouble after yesterday. Things were already pretty bad for him, you know…’
If the group had been surprised by Draco’s invite to the Malvoy-Potter home, they did not let on.
Then she spotted the distinctive silver locks of Harry’s husband peeking out from under an aviator helmet, his face partially obscured behind big goggles, but there was enough left to distinguish the wearer as being no other than Draco Malfoy. Which meant that the creature he was guiding into the hall with his right hand gently resting on the back of…
It was sometime later that I literally ran into you after your quidditch practice. When we both reached out to steady ourselves, our hands found each other and even though we had recovered our balance, we held hands for a just a while longer.
Harry ran over to where Dobby was standing beside Draco Malvoy.
The day we moved in together was the best day of my life. Thank goodness for magic and good friends, as moving house and merging both our belongings, was probably the most stressful thing I have ever done, not including any of the crazy shit Voldy had me do in our sixth year on pain of my parents’ death. I don’t know how muggles do this moving lark.
In addition to attendance by the students from year 4 upwards and their dates, the teaching and support staff and their dates, invitations were also sent to board of management members and some of the Ministry staff, most of whom were past pupils of Hogwarts and were always delighted for a chance to visit their school to let their hair down.
‘And triple checked’, Hermione and Neville added.
There had been a number of debates between Harry and himself about whether it should be Malvoy-Potter or Potter-Malvoy, all of them eventually ending up in the bedroom, but in the end they had agreed on the alphabetical convention.
The only person, she decided that could help her get a proper send-off for Dobby was Harry Potter himself. It was only proper for him to undo the mess he made of Dobby’s burial. Burying an elf under the ground, did he not know any elf-lore? Elves should be sent on their final journey in some unique vessel surrounded by the things they cared about in life, such as flowers, chocolates, sweets or other confectionary, representations of fluffy pink bunnies (they no longer sent life ones on this final journey) or other favourite creatures, butterbeer… her mind started to drift at the thought of butterbeer, but she steeled herself.
‘I suppose, that could be arranged’, Squid Harry mused, ‘Is that what Dobby wanted?
When visiting London with my mother one Summer, I once saw you sitting all alone in a coffee shop in Kings Cross station and I was about to pluck up the courage to go and talk to you, when, all of a sudden, you jumped up out of your seat, as if you had seen a ghost and before I could get to you, you had disappeared.
‘We thought Dobby would appreciate the colours’, Luna explained, and Harry clearly could see her handiwork in the intricate paint design. He also detected what looked like runes.
My Father made me visit her one time, when she was sick in hospital, during our fourth year. The entire time I was sitting at her bedside, I was imagining scenarios where you and I would get together. How I would invite you to the Yule Ball as my date and how we would be the talk of Hogwarts and the entire wizarding world.
The massive pink head turned to her and she could hear a muffled, ‘Yes?’
‘I’m afraid, brother dear, that the weight has been calibrated for Harry and Draco and little Dobby, not for a big hulk like you,’ George interceded.
Fleur immediately went into nursing mode and within minutes of their arrival, Hermione, Draco, Griphook and Mr Ollivander were assessed, treated and tucked up in bed. The rest of the ragtag bunch were planted in front of a bowl of hearty soup that would have gotten full approval of Molly Weasley herself, had she been there.
The next thing he knew, Dobby was holding a wand and Bellatrix let out a scream of outrage and something came hurtling towards them.
~ ~ ~ ~ ~
‘You did not think I would let you go on your own, did you?’, Draco and Ron shouted simultaneously.
So how to approach the famous Boy who Lived. She did not want to just apparate to his office in the Ministry Of Magic, even though that probably would not surprise him after his experiences with Dobby. Thinking of all the stories Dobby told her, which she had dubbed ‘The Adventures of a soon to be Free Elf’, always made her smile. Dobby had been one of a kind. Imagine dropping a three-tiered cake on a muggle in front of a bunch of other muggles; sealing the entrance to Platform 9 3/4 to stop a wizard from entering, disrupting one of the hallowed wizard quidditch matches by hexing a bludger…Yes, Dobby was one of a kind, not that her fellow elves were appreciative of such disrespect for what they considered their masters, but Winky had seen the kindness in Dobby’s eyes, his passion for life and his fierce loyalty to the one wizard he considered his friend.
The music was very loud and Winky had to repeat the last part in a raised voice.
Draco looked down at the ring on his left hand, a tiny ruby and diamond adorning the silver band.
Harry tried not to laugh. “You could just have said, like, ‘what happened between you and Ginny? Do you want to talk about it?’”
Once inside the warm pub, Harry and Draco were smashed into a corner with what appeared to be the entirety of Dumbledore’s Army. Harry had informed Ron and Hermione that Draco would be joining them beforehand, as to be prepared. Hermione went as far as to provide a friendly reception, telling him she was  pleased he had come. In return, Draco congratulated her on their engagement, even remarking that the ring was lovely.
Groaning, Pansy Parkinson emerged from the entryway, eying him crossly.
“When is it not?” Draco uttered. “He told me how he felt and I basically spat in his face. He went all the way to godforsaken Portugal to- to win my hand or something! And I didn’t tell him the reason I went to Portugal was to figure out how I felt. After that night on the beach, I just wasn’t sure anymore. Honestly, I was furious at him for doing that behind my back… but I think I was more furious that I was too much of a coward to tell him how I really felt.”
______
Quickly pulling himself together and searching for the champagne-fueled levity of just a few moments earlier, Harry forced himself to approximate cheerfulness until he actually felt it. Mentally preparing the excuse he would give for Draco’s absence, he bustled off to rejoin the party.
And then Harry’s heart nearly stops.
Neither Ron, Hermione, nor any other close friends showed up to the party that evening but Harry found he didn’t particularly mind. He and Draco had spent most of the evening chatting, falling into a comfortable rhythm, occasionally poking fun at the more unusual party guests. They’d even affectionately nicknamed one particular cousin of Luna’s “Old Jangles” due to the inordinate amount of silver jewelry dangling from every possible surface of his body, as well as gesticulating wildly while speaking. While they both chatted with other people, the pair typically migrated back towards one another until the night came to a close.
“Hi,” Draco said meekly, looking down at the small package wrapped in his hands.
It was now late June, and the Burrow was brimming with guests for Ron and Hermione’s wedding.
“I suppose I’d better brush up on my Portuguese then,” he conceded finally, attempting a small smile.
______
“What are you talking about? They haven’t even done toasts yet. I was-” Draco was silenced with a burning look from Harry. He stood up and straightened his collar. “Very well, if you’re certain. Give Luna my best then.”
“You can’t say you didn’t know what you were getting into.” Draco leans in to kiss him, and Harry pulls back.
“I can’t believe I’m doing this. In what universe should I let Harry Potter drag me to a pub night with everyone that has ever disliked me in my entire life?” Draco demanded, though continuing to walk at a rather brisk pace towards said pub.
Draco looked back at Harry with heavy-lidded eyes. “And what about me?” he asked.
“I want to dance with you,” Harry said shakily.
But Harry’s never been one for following these rules and continues to push on. “We should, you know. We never talk about anything,” he mouths against Draco’s neck.
“Pansy, I was not
“You’re so tight,” Draco said breathily. “It’s incredible.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Draco?”
“Would that be the
Harry took a moment to think, attempting to look past the insensitivity of it all. He searched the empty beach as if looking to say to someone,
“Guess that’s true,” Harry admitted, exhaling. “I thought ‘following my dreams’” he gestured to the mug, “might inspire me to try and enjoy this party, but really what my dreams are telling me to do is to go back to my flat, order takeout, and watch the telly with my hand down my pants.”
“Nobody likes to, Potter. But can’t you understand where I’m coming from at all? I don’t want the sort of… debt that comes with belonging to someone. And I never thought I’d be spending my life with you, of all people.”
Harry’s panting echoed in the stairwell as he climbed up towards Draco’s flat. His heart beating fast, he felt unsure of what he planned to say, but knew he had to say
Walking away left Draco with a lightness he hadn’t felt in years.
Reminded of the odd circumstance they found themselves in for the second time, Harry felt strangely vulnerable. “What
“I don’t think you want to hex each other at all,” Hermione said meaningfully. “Quite the opposite really.”
They’ve kissed too many times to count. In stairwells and bathrooms, under street lamps, and in pubs. Harry thinks he may have kissed Draco on every visible stretch of his skin, covering him like a fever. But this, this feels different. They’ve never done it like this - never in a bedroom, never so nervously and tenderly. Their hands are moving slowly, their eyes are closed, and Harry’s heartbeat hammers loud in time to the small noises they’re making.
It had been so hard for him to let Ginny go that Ron and Hermione eventually staged an intervention. Harry cringed in discomfort at the memory. He’d stopped seeing her then, mostly out of embarrassment, and became so committed to avoidance it became the norm. And thus began the season of Harry Potter rarely leaving his flat, save work and the occasional drink with Ron and Hermione.
“Yes well, it was a year too soon. I can’t handle this shite,” Draco grimaced.
“No, no, stay.” Harry grabs him by the wrist, pulling Malfoy back towards him. “Dance.”
“Nice of you to emerge from your cave, Potter. Aren’t we all so lucky?” Draco mocked, but Harry was relieved to find no edge to his voice.
“Why haven’t you tried to stop me?” Draco asks, no malice in his voice. Harry is stung into silence. “Probably because you know it’s for the best. It’s hard to accept when things are over, especially for you.”
“Oh relax, love, everybody knows you’re an
“Ah, yes,” Harry moaned, grabbing at Draco’s hips and encouraging him further. “You feel so good.”
“And what do you think Blaise would make of this?” Pansy said snidely.
Once the applause died down and everyone was seated, Hermione leaned over to Harry.
“Let them wonder,” Draco said breathily, pulling Harry into a blistering kiss and swaying on the spot.
? Maybe that’s the wrong word.” He shrugged. “Just come on, they’re going to wonder what’s keeping us.”
“It looks good,” he offered, unable to think of anything else.
Somehow, he managed to regain enough sense and respond. “Look, Draco, I’m sorry about everything. All I know is… I can’t let this go. Whatever this is. I like being with you. I like it so much. I’ve never felt as happy as I have spending time with you, and I know you’ve got Blaise-”
Clear as day in his hazy vision is Draco Malfoy, also propped up against a wall and smirking. Harry hasn’t seen him since the trials, and he looks so different. It’s obvious he’s already been spotted, judging by the look of sheer… well, he can’t fully put his finger on whatever is playing across Malfoy’s face. Carried by the vibrations of the music and the sentiment of
With that, he walks away, feeling more confident than he probably should, but also revelling in the ability to ruffle Draco Malfoy’s sharply pressed feathers. He winces a little as he realizes he’s half-hard, but doesn’t bother to check in with what that might mean; Malfoy’s always been able to get under his skin.
Ron, on the other hand, looked as though he might burst, as if he couldn’t wait to tell Malfoy he was precisely the opposite of pleased he had joined them. Chastened by a
Draco felt like someone had hit him with a stunning spell. He swayed a little as he sat on the couch, staring into the abyss.
“Magnus Savio? Oh, well I hope he doesn’t like his job at the Ministry too much,” Draco deadpanned, studying his nails. “Something tells me the DMM is downsizing and he’s first on the chopping block.”
“So, what are you going to do?”
Harry nearly dropped his spoon, mouth flying open.
“This means if you’ll have me, I’ll never leave you again. I’m yours, forever - whatever you want that to mean.”
“You’ve been talking to Neville? Merlin, Draco, it’s only been six months. There’s no way. There’s no one else.”
“I almost messed everything up with us though, second guessing myself,” Draco replied, feeling guilty and grateful at once.
“Whatever. I need a fucking cigarette,” Draco cursed, digging his hands into the pocket of his pea coat. “This was a horrible time to quit.”
“If you say ‘I’m sorry’ I will murder you on the spot. You don’t get to say it. I know you’re not.” Blaise was so intentional, deliberate and discriminating with his words and actions. Draco couldn’t bear to see him lie. “And neither am I.”
Truthfully, Harry was feeling more shocked at the way he and Malfoy had made it through a three-minute conversation without hexing one another.
his subconscious scolded.
Potter, what are you even saying, that you felt obligated to be together?” Draco pressed. Apparently he cared more about the breakup than he let on.
Draco rarely saw Blaise this flustered, which wasn’t saying much, but he rarely played with his hair.
Malfoy gave a nod of recognition, cheeks still pink.
“Er, Westcliff?” Draco responded coyly. Saying it aloud felt silly.
And then the house is quiet.
“You’re not serious!” Harry laughed and sat upright. “You’re not… Are you?”
“But-”
Draco doesn’t respond immediately, instead, he crosses over to the window and peers out into the expanse. The two men stand together silently, fingers barely touching, hearts beating in their ears.
“Please, Potter, when are you ever fun?” Draco sits up a little taller. “It’s obvious that when people think of holiday merriment, they think of yours truly.”
“So you feel like you’ll owe me a debt? By being with me? That’s what a partnership is to you?” Harry is so flustered, he can hardly contain his outrage. “What sort of fucked up concept of family is that?”
“I… did. I actually spent most of the night talking to Draco Malfoy.” Harry could hardly believe the words as he was saying them.
They’re standing very close together now, and Malfoy is eyeing him carefully. The band begins a blazing Florence and the Machine cover, and the energy and magic are palpable.
“I am here, nitwit,” Draco teased.
Harry’s always been taken by the rush that comes with the meeting of their lips, but the butterflies in his stomach seemed to have moved to his chest. He’s not sure what’s changed, but he doesn’t want it to stop.
“It’s a good thing you didn’t in the end though. I might have ended up with Savio or something. We went on a date, you know,” Harry admitted.
Judging from the lack of sting this question begets, Harry thinks he must be over it. He and Ginny wouldn’t have worked; he’s known it all along if he’s honest. “I wouldn’t know,” is all he offers, and Draco seems to get his meaning.
“What? Draco, it’s freezing, what were you doing on the beach? And with whom?” Pansy shrieked.
At some point late in the night, he found himself entangled in conversation with a very handsome man whose name escaped him. He smelled a bit like whiskey and campfire, and under different circumstances, Harry might have been quite smitten. And yet, when propositioned with a kiss on the cheek and a “Back to mine, then?” Harry shook his head apologetically.
“I - Certainly not,” Draco fumbles, tensing. He places an experimental hand on Harry’s chest, half-heartedly keeping him at a distance. “When have I ever given any indication-”
“Yes I’ll have you,” he answers, turning to face the other man, chest heaving with affection. “There was never any question for me, Draco. I’ve been waiting for you.”
Harry surveyed the room once more. His heart practically stopped when he realized that standing near the back of the tent was Draco Malfoy, looking solemn and nervous. Pulse ringing in his ears, he continued.
Harry knows what this means. This is more than just hiding in shadows, more than just lust - though Harry can admit that’s what he's feeling primarily right now. He wants to cover every inch of Draco’s body, make him feel so good and so certain there will be no questions left to ask.
His first few weeks as the DADA professor are a little shaky, and he finds he can hardly remember his students’ names, let alone figure out how to best teach them. Thankfully, Neville comes to his rescue often, sharing whatever tricks of the trade he’s learned in his short time as a professor. He’s helped Harry to find his footing again, letting him fall apart when he needs, and putting him back together again when he’s ready. Neville is truly one of the best men and friends Harry will ever know, and he believes this to his core.
“Oh, are you flatmates, then?”

Harry watched him walk off to the apparition point, fighting back the sting in his eyes and throat. Harry knew what it meant when Draco didn’t bother arguing: It was a concession now that would lead to a massive explosion later. It didn’t matter though, Harry would rather watch his retreating back than face whatever he might have to say had he stayed.
“Must you ruin everything?” Harry sighs, and rolls over on top of him.
“Malfoy, relax. It’ll be great. We’re all adults. Besides, you’re already friends with Luna, and she’ll be there,” Harry assured, attempting to provide Draco a reason to stay without sounding too desperate.
“No! Not bad per se. I just- I just don’t want anything to change. Obviously it has to, and we’re not kids anymore, but it was the three of us. And then when I was with Ginny, it was the four of us. And now it’s just the two of them… and me.”
“Look, I’m sorry. It’s not like I went there trying to break you up… I don’t know what I was hoping to achieve. I just- Draco, I just like you. That’s all it is, and I just didn’t want to wait to tell you. I didn’t want you to waste your time anymore.”
“You seemed pretty certain yesterday, Draco. You’re asking me to wait for you?”
“What an odd question. You’re high as a kite, Potter,” Draco assesses, frowning and giving him the once-over.
“Merlin, Potter, what’s happened to your eye? You look a wreck. Is everything alright?” Draco asked, startled by Harry’s appearance. He hadn’t had time to grab any bruise removal paste and knew a black eye was blooming spectacularly where Blaise had punched him two days ago.
And then their clothes are gone and they’re lying together, taking each other in inch-by-inch. Draco is the first to move, crawling on top of Harry and reaching between them. This time though, they don’t bring each other off with their hands or mouths. This time, Draco straddles Harry, taking him in slowly and deeply. Nods and whispers of encouragement urge him on, keep his hips moving in a gentle, steady rhythm.
who’s ever disliked you. I’m sure there are plenty more who couldn’t make it.” Harry grinned as Draco made a rude gesture at him.
“What is what?”
The ceremony was beautiful and understated, going off without a hitch. At the reception, seated at the Head Table, Harry prepared to give his speech. He stood and surveyed the crowd, gazing fondly at the familiar faces. He looked at Ron and Hermione, who were offering encouraging smiles in between looking lovingly at each other, and his heart swelled.
“Hear, hear,” Harry whispered back. Ron didn’t have to love Draco, he just needed to tolerate the fact they were sort-of friends.
” Malfoy admits, though sounding slightly amused. “But it seems you’re without your usual entourage. Where’s the Weaslette?”
“I love you so much, I’ll marry you in front of everyone we know, and wear this ring, and probably adopt fifteen children, ten crups, and three toads to make you happy,” Draco said, turning and pressing their foreheads together.
at him.
Draco’s heart dropped at Harry’s hasty reassurances.
This time, Harry is certain he’s said the right thing as strong arms pull him in close.
“Well, are you going to see him again?” Hermione studied Harry’s face. For his part, he wanted to play his cards close to the vest, unsure of how he was feeling. He still felt a small sting of jealousy when he thought of those intimate moments in Luna’s flat... Or at least they’d felt intimate to him.
Struggling through the crowd and certain he looks even less graceful than he feels, he arrives at Draco’s station.
Just then, Luna swept into the room, interrupting Harry’s conversation with himself. “Oh you found each other!” she exclaimed.
Draco hung up the mobile hastily. He had to get to Portugal.
“Potter, what?” Draco rubs his temples, recognizing he is no longer absolved of his behavior. “It’s nothing you’ve done at all. I just- It’s hard for me to describe, but there was a time I never thought I’d make it this far. As in, still be alive. I could hardly see beyond the next day, and that sort of thinking just doesn’t change overnight. I don’t know if it ever does. Have you ever stopped feeling that way, like your days are numbered?” His expression changes slightly to one of pleading.
“I mean, I thought if I ever gave too much of myself, I wouldn’t get anything back. I felt like my reserves would run out, and I’d have nothing left. But instead, I feel like it keeps getting better… between us, I mean. I can give it my all because you do too. I watch you do that everyday, with everything. Even things that don’t matter that much. Does that even make sense? ” Draco’s cheeks tinged a slight pink at this revelation. He tended to talk too much when he was happy and sated.
After breaking apart and managing to clean themselves up a bit, Draco stared appreciatively at Harry’s naked form as he emerged from the washroom. “I had always wondered what Harry Potter’s magic cock would be like. It doesn’t disappoint,” he said hungrily.
They’ve escaped the city for the weekend together at a cabin on the coast. Draco had mentioned it casually, as though Potter could join him if he liked, or not. Though if Harry is honest, he wants it to be a more serious invitation - he wants Draco to want him there with every fibre of his being. He wants Draco to want like he does. He tries to send this message telepathically, moving with
“Are you offering?”
He sorted through stacks of photographs and trinkets, each of them a vision of what no longer was. Tired eyes watched as younger versions of himself waved happily up at him. He attempted a feeble smile back, wishing desperately to be back in that little cottage in Cornwall, or flying above lavender fields in Hampshire.
“Oh, is it?” Draco rolled his eyes.
. He traces the lines on Draco’s chest, written some eight years ago by his own magic. They never talk about them. All of a sudden, Harry wants to, and he says as much.
“Jesus, Malfoy, don’t call her that!” Harry snapped.
“And that’s... bad?” Draco frowned, attempting to read Harry’s expression.
“Maybe you’d like to try riding it a little later,” Harry said mischievously. “If you’re up for it.”
” Draco wrinkled his nose in distaste. He then proceeded to cross his arms and wait for a response.
“Potter. Harry. I can’t bear another day, let alone holiday, without you,” Draco confesses. “That I’ve let six months go by without telling you that I want to spend every day with you for the rest of my life proves that I’m an unforgivable bastard. But I had to tell you that I’ve made the biggest mistake in my life walking away from what we had. I was dragging my feet, and I was frightened, and I was operating under some sort of delusion that I could protect you. I was trying to be selfless because I know your life is probably much better without me, but we all know that I’m not selfless. Let’s just be honest. And I want you. My pride is out the window at this point, so damn it all. I want you more than anything.”
Pansy paused. “You’re not going, of course?”
Draco looks up at him, eyes bright and blazing. Seconds later, his hands and body are everywhere, pinning Harry against the wall, claiming every inch of his neck with his lips. Their kisses are fevered, all definitions of ache apparent in their movements.
“Oh too right, and what a disaster that was! Do you remember when we tried to have sex at the Manor over break? Traumatizing, to say the least. I’m not sure how we managed to recover from that one.”
Taking in the new sensation and thrill of finally kissing Draco Malfoy, Harry let his eyes fall shut and softened into the kiss. Harry felt like he might explode, stars behind his eyes. Slowly, tentatively, Draco opened his lips, his tongue asking the question
They spent the afternoon on the Carcavelos beach, laying in the sand and leisurely sipping on Sparkling and Port. Tipsy from the drink and sun and unable to apparate, they rode the train back to the city center.
“Lucky for them,” came the disappointed sigh Harry could hardly hear over a Lovegood rendition of “The Parting Glass” sending guests on their way.
“We will,” Harry whispered back. “We’ll do it all... But for now we should probably get back to the reception. People will wonder where we’ve got off to.”
“Malfoy, I have to ask, when did you and Luna come to be such good friends? I sort of figured she might not want much to do with you after…” Harry paused, choosing his words carefully as to not upset the delicate balance they’d found this night. He was genuinely curious, and Luna hadn’t mentioned their friendship at all. Or maybe he’d just been too busy hiding from the world to take notice.
“Oh so being with anyone but you is a waste of my time? Christ, Potter, of course you’re so vain as to think that. I can’t believe you. It took a lot for me to even try and be friends, and now you tell me that it’s been a lie? I feel sick,” Draco said caustically. He somehow managed to say all of this quietly enough as to not draw attention, but it was clear he was furious.
Draco let his hands wander, roaming the bed, canvassing the surface. Sliding his hands under a pillow, a sharp
“The healers… they don’t know. It could be a sort of blood malediction, but there’s a probability it’s a curse. It’s a waiting game right now and it makes me feel like I want to crawl out of my skin.”
“Only a little. Funny to see you here,” Harry says, though not unkindly. “This doesn’t really strike me as the sort of place you’d want to be seen.” He gestures behind him to the black walls and smoke and Persian rugs. The venue itself seems to be the very antithesis of Draco Malfoy.
A familiar drawl startled Harry into action. He quickly spun around, sloshing his drink on the already sticky kitchen floor.

And then they’re in the bedroom, jumpers pulled over heads, trousers and pants slipped roughly over hips. Groaning and flushed with arousal, Harry arches toward Draco, pressing their bodies together. Their motions are firm, promises made with every gasp, every breath.
“I can’t believe I waited this long now it’s over with. It’s the best thing I’ve ever done.” Ron looked proud and patted Hermione’s hand.
Blaise bustled off to make them something called a Ginja, and Draco made himself at home, surveying the general area. He was hoping for some sign that showed Blaise had been thinking of him while off on this adventure but came up disappointed. Not even a single picture of them adorned the building, nothing to represent their life together back home. Draco huffed, attempting to let it go. He was determined to enjoy their time together and shake the lingering feeling from the other night. His mind drifted back to Westcliff, quite different than any beach Portugal would have to offer, and of holding Harry’s hand. If this were Harry’s apartment, he was fairly certain there would be pictures of the two of them plastered over every surface imaginable. His stomach did a flip, and he scolded himself.
“Forgiving. You’re right though, if I were her I’d want nothing to do with me.” Malfoy looked down at his shoes at this, and Harry felt his heart quiver. It felt like maybe he was seeing Draco Malfoy for the first time, not just the mouthy prat he’d known the entirety of their Hogwarts years. He wasn’t entirely sure if this new, softer version of Malfoy could be real.
“No.”
“We’ve gone over this so many times. We just haven’t been on the same page about anything lately. We’ve hardly had a peaceful minute in the last year; I’m not sure if I’ve seen you happy in the last six months. I haven’t given you what you want.” He counts these things on his fingers, making Harry flinch. Draco pauses to consider his next move, unsure he should continue to speak. “Look, about a month ago I heard you talking with Granger and Weasley in the backyard about being Rose and Hugo’s Godfather. You were saying you wanted to, but it’d be best if-” his voice cracks and he pauses. “I knew I was denying you something you’d wanted forever, I could hear it in your voice. You’ve never had a family in the way you’d imagined. I couldn’t keep my promise to you, and I knew I couldn’t stand in your way any longer.”
His fingers found a picture of one October years ago, fingerprints marring the perfect gloss of the photo - and that was fitting wasn’t it? That was their beginning, all tentative kisses and tangled limbs. Recollections of learning curves, raw nerves, and whispered half-apologies overwhelmed his senses. It all seemed worth fighting for then. And wasn’t it still, even now that the veneer had worn off, the shine dulled with age?
“Yes,
“Hi. You’re here,” Harry said warily, as though this were fragile; as though it could be taken away from him again.
“He’s apparently quite the interior decorator as well… It’s a long story,” Harry added at the questioning look from Hermione. “I still kind of can’t believe we’re actual friends. I don’t think we want to hex each other anymore.” Harry couldn’t keep himself from smiling, if not a bit wistfully. He’d decided last night that however confusing his feelings about Malfoy might be, he liked having the other man around. Malfoy made him feel more confident by proxy, like he could stare right back at the throngs of unabashed staring admirers.
