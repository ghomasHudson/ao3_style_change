With a start Harry realized what he was doing, he pulled away, stumbling back towards the waiting cab.
Draco slowly removed the ribbon and paper to reveal an Ollivander’s wand box. He lifted the lid and stared at the wand inside.
“Did she just say Lumos Solem?” Harry asked Hermione who was trying to save her papers from the tide of coffee running across the table. A condiment container does not make a good dam for holding back coffee spills apparently.
Harry didn’t hesitate. “Because I wanted to. I’ve wanted to kiss you since I saw you at the show at Alexandria Palace.”
“Ron, the Yorkshires should be in the oven by now,” Hermione shouted from the kitchen. Although she left the actual cooking to Ron she presided over the preparation with a precise timetable and was unforgiving if the timings went astray. “And don’t leave Harry just standing there, take him into the living room.”
“We’ve talked about this Ronald,” Hermione scolded giving Ron a stern look, “we are here for Harry.”
“I don’t know, just keep walking.” Harry slipped his wand out of his jacket, “Keep close to me but run if I tell you.”
“Thanks Luna, I’m really happy but it’s….complicated.” Harry pushed a dumpling around the bowl with his spoon.
“Hogwarts in an excellent school. Many of you have parents or siblings who completed their education here, but you will need to work hard to pass your O.W.L.S, and some of you may be lucky enough to go on to pass N.E.W.T.S. Be sure to study in your spare time, make use of the library and complete your homework on time. Dedication, commitment and application is what is required to make witches and wizards of you all.
“I had suspicions, I always thought you had a crush on Malfoy at school, you paid more attention to him than me in sixth year. Honestly I don’t know what took you so long, I mean you and Draco have had hard ons for each other for years.”
“Thank you Mrs. Weasley, thank you for inviting me.” Draco visibly sagged with relief at the warm welcome.
was at Malfoy Manor it was awful, the noise of……well…..you know. Anyway I persuaded one of the house elves to get me a Muggle guitar and I locked myself in my room learning to play so I didn’t have to hear what was going on in the house.”
Harry grabbed his jacket and walked out of the room to the floo fireplace, he had the powder in his hands when Hermione caught up with him.
Hermione grabbed Ron by the arm and pulled him to his feet. “It’s getting late, I think we should be going. Thanks for dinner, I’ll see you at work.”
“All the dramatics, like when I lost it while I was wearing the horcrux pendant.” Ron gulped down his drink. “I acted like a tosser then and I’m acting like one now. I’m sorry.”
“I want to feel you inside me,” Draco said in a low voice, his face buried in the nest of dark hairs of Harry’s groin.
Harry led Draco into the conservatory at the back of the house. “Why don’t we go for a walk, it’s a beautiful day.”
“I’m not hungry.” Harry continued to glare at the Slytherins who were still laughing at him. All except Draco who had his head down, shoulders hunched, toying with the food on his plate. Whatever Snape had said to him earlier in the day had obviously troubled the boy in some way.
“Are you sure you are not doing this to sway him towards leaving the Muggle world?” Hermione raised an eyebrow. “I know you too well Harry Potter, and you were never very subtle about anything.”
Harry awoke sometime later, for a moment he thought he was in his bed in the dorms but the blond head next to him quickly dispelled that notion. Draco stirred in his arms, his eyes opened and seeing Harry next to him brought a smile to his lips. He leaned forward and kissed him tenderly before casting a tempus, they had been asleep for around two hours.
Draco pulled Harry into a hug. As Draco was several inches taller, Harry ended up with his face buried against Draco’s neck. Harry inhaled a scent that was floral but woodsy at the same time, Draco smelt gorgeous. Draco gave him a quick squeeze then let go, Harry was a bit disappointed that he hadn’t asked for a longer hug.
Draco got out of the bed, giving Harry a very nice view of his pert arse, pulled out a big box from the walk in closet and placed it on the bed.
Harry nodded, having grown up with a Muggle family he had used the internet on Dudley’s computer when he had the chance, but he had rarely used it since moving out of the Dursley household.
“Well that was a strange experience,” Pansy said, walking into the dressing room from the hospitality suite. “I needed a pee but Draco was in the shower so I had to use the public Muggle bathrooms. I don’t know how Draco does it, living with Muggles the whole time.”
“Happy Christmas Harry, and I suppose you can wish ferret face a happy Christmas from me too.” Ron gave Harry a cheeky grin and disappeared into the mob of people inside the shop.
Draco wiped his face. “That’s the problem Harry, there will always be people who use dark magic. You know that, you’re an Auror. You see it every day. I don’t want to be in that world. I cant think of a single reason why I would ever use magic again.”
Draco gave Harry a skeptical look. “You are up to something, I can see it on your face. What have you done?”
“What will you do? You are not seriously thinking of going on tour with Draco?” Hermione said shooting Draco a sharp look who raised his eyebrows in return.
Harry gazed in stunned silence at the boy in front of him, although he saw him every day he hadn’t really
“Do you know why he was at the Ministry ‘Mione?” Harry asked. “I saw him come in but couldn’t tell where he was headed.”
As the house lights came back up the girls left for the bathroom whilst Ron went to buy more drinks and Harry was left alone with his thoughts. He was both anxious and excited, the thought of seeing Malfoy up on the stage excited him given the videos he had seen, but he was anxious about why Malfoy had given the tickets to Harry in the first place.
Harry gently pushed slightly further in, pushing deeper in small increments, the sounds falling from Draco’s mouth made Harry’s cock twitch, he wanted to listen to those sounds forever, the soft grunts, hisses and moans that made him want to scoop Draco up and never let him go. Harry pressed further until he was fully seated inside him, the tightness of Draco around him very nearly pushed him over the edge.
“If I recall, you punched me from under the invisibility cloak, which wasn’t very sporting.” Draco said rolling his eyes. “And by the way, you hit like a girl.”
Harry moaned as Draco’s mouth worked him. He loved the feel of Draco sucking him, soft lips skimming over his hardness, his tongue swirling around the sensitive glans, darting in and out of the slit. Draco used his tongue, teeth and lips to suck, lick and graze Harry’s cock, making him push back against the wall for support as his legs threatened to give way. Harry wound his fingers into the blond hair tugging gently, Draco responded by taking Harry deeper into his throat, sucking the entire length of him, swallowing him down.
“I’m worn out, the fashion industry is so very difficult, so draining. I work my fingers to the bone, the very bone of them, just to keep up. I’m just so in demand, my designs are so popular. I’m just a faded out wreak.”
Neville did beat Draco, he beat him three times, and as Harry predicted Draco was still in a sulky mood when they went to bed after Neville left.
“That was about his traitorous Slytherin heart,” Ron snorted. “Typical Malfoy, Slytherin to the core”
Harry grimaced. After he had come out as gay he had spent several months hanging out at gay bars having random hookups with men that he didn’t even like, desperately trying to find someone to be with. His friends had staged an ‘intervention’ one night gently telling him that being gay was exactly like being straight, finding ‘the one’ would not happen with a pickup from a bar but it would just happen naturally when he found someone he liked. Since then he had been on a few dates, even had a short-lived relationship with a wizard from the Portkey department, but had still not been able to find someone he wanted to be with.
When Harry looked confused Draco sighed. “To clarify, to keep him from learning about my feelings for you.”
“Of course. You’ve been my best friend since we were eleven years old, and we’ve been through a lot together, me, you and Hermione.”
Draco dragged Harry to his feet. “Bedroom is this way.” He looked at Harry’s small book bag. “I have things you can use, pj’s and stuff.”
As he exited the shop he received a text from Draco, he was home and just taking a quick shower, Harry replied that he was on his way and would be there in about twenty minutes. The nearer he got to Draco’s building the more nervous he got, this was their first real ‘date’ and he hoped he wouldn’t mess it up or say something twatish. Harry found the address Draco had given him, it was a block of luxury apartments overlooking Camden Lock, he located Draco’s name on the directory by the front door and pressed the corresponding button. There was a buzz and the front door opened to let him into the foyer, Draco lived on the top floor so Harry took the elevator up to the fourteenth floor, found the door to apartment 1422 and knocked.
Harry glanced at Draco’s arm, he was wearing a long sleeved shirt but Harry could guess what it covered.
“It’s a mixing desk, it where the engineers take all the separate channels, vocals, backing vocals, guitars, drums, and mix them all together to make the finished track. There’s computer software that can edit, adjust timing and even pitch. It’s the process that makes us sound good.”
Draco rolled his eyes. “Those girls are crazy. A few nights back a girl threw a bra onstage and it landed on Dan’s guitar head. He played a whole track with a neon pink bra hanging off his guitar.”
“Draco was amazing,” Harry said his eyes still on the stage where Malfoy had been. “Just fucking amazing.”
“I know exactly what you mean, being an Auror isn’t what I thought it would be. Don’t you want to be in the band anymore?”
Draco’s face hardened. “Just tell my Father that I will not fail him.” Tilly opened her mouth to say more but Draco cut her off with a harsh bark. “GO NOW.”
“It’s a piece of Hogwarts.” Draco took the rock and rubbed his fingers against the rough surface. “I knew I was never going back so I took a piece with me after the battle.”
“I assume by the vacant expression on your face that you are trying to remember how to write your name Potter. Very taxing on such a small brain I’m sure.”
I was always disappointed that Neville and Luna didn't end up together, and having them together in this story didn't work either :(
Draco entered from the bathroom fully dressed, hair pulled back in the messy bun that Harry liked so much.  “What are you two talking about?”
“At least you know you won’t be bumping into him anytime soon, it appears that he’s firmly established in the Muggle world and Muggle rock stars do not visit the Ministry.”
“He’s like a hippogriff with a sore head at times,” Ron said spearing a sausage on his fork, “but he’ll calm down, he always does. Pass the ketchup ‘Mione, can’t have sausages without ketchup!”
“I don’t think he’s ever had a proper big birthday party before. I want him to know he has people that want to share his birthday with him.”
The foursome made their way back out onto the street which was now deserted except for the last of the road crew loading up a tour truck.
Rowle’s jinx hit Draco in the back, sending him sprawling face down in the grime and rubbish littering the alley floor.
Harry was setting the table when Hermione then Ron appeared in the floo. Kreacher rushed to greet them as fast as his spindly legs could carry him, he insisted on greeting all guests and announcing them to Harry even though Harry could clearly see they had arrived.
“You are welcome Harry. Did I tell you about the dabberblimps I found in the basement? Father was very upset because they ate all his socks.”
Hermione pushed open the door to the office. “You probably should just see for yourself. That’s Walter over there in the red sweater, corner cubicle.”
Draco was rolling his eyes behind her back but with a grin on his face, he was apparently used to Pansy’s theatrics.
, their little voices filling the foyer with sound. Harry found himself crying, it was so charming and sweet, he felt somewhat lost as the carol ended and the elves fell silent.
Harry’s right side was a mass of pain; he could feel the blood trickling down his arm but could not move to wipe it away. He was vaguely aware of Draco crawling over and running his hands over Harry’s chest.
“I’m a Slytherin, I’m good at deflecting.” Draco stood up and walked towards the battered sofa, his back to Harry. “The point is what do you think would have happened if he had found out about my feelings for you?”
“Relax Potter, you know he can’t get past the wards. The mark does more than summon him; it acts as a kind of communication device. If you touch your mark it creates a link with the Dark Lord, allows him access to your mind, allows him to read your thoughts.”
Hermione raised an eyebrow. “Probably since when the whole of the wizarding world made him into a social pariah.”
Ron stared Harry straight in the eye. “Does Malfoy really feel guilty about the people that died in the war?”
Harry woke to the aroma of fresh coffee and bacon. He was alone in the bedroom but could hear Draco singing in the main room. Harry rolled out of bed and wandered through to find him setting the table for breakfast.
“Not nearly as exciting as it sounds.” Draco poured the wine. “I love playing music, I love doing the shows, but the touring is tedious and exhausting. I understand you are taking over as Herbology Professor next year, congratulations”
Harry uncorked the vial and brought it to his lips, it smelled disgusting, like rotten cabbage and a week dead niffler. He gagged at the odour. “Are you sure you aren’t trying to poison me Draco?”
Draco shrugged. “I’m a Slytherin, I’m good at deception. Besides, you’re a Gryffindor and there was no way I was going to admit I fancied a
They followed the crowd of people who were lining up to pass through the gates to the venue. The gates were manned by two burly Muggles, who reminded Harry of Crabbe and Goyle, and every ticket holder had to walk through a large grey freestanding doorway before handing over their tickets to be scanned.
“That was probably the best Christmas I’ve ever had,” Harry said as he lay in bed with Draco’s arms wrapped round him.
Harry’s eyes were drawn back to the photo, Malfoy was seriously gorgeous, he looked very much like his father but with an elegance and serenity that Lucius had never possessed. Harry swallowed hard,
Neville swirled the remainder of his pint around the glass in his hand. “I don’t know what to tell you Harry, this is way out of my comfort zone, but maybe you should talk to Luna. I’ve heard her counselling sessions have helped a lot of people, and Luna cares about you, she will be able to help you through this.”
” The purple light from Harry’s wand narrowly missed Rowle as Harry ran from behind the dumpster towards Draco who was still lying motionless on the ground.
Whilst Rowle’s attention was on Draco Harry lifted his wand to release a stunning spell but Rowle had anticipated the move and dodged out the way.
Harry tried to make his face blank but failed miserably; he probably should take up that meditation thing. “It’s a surprise.”
“Master Harry, sit up. Kreacher has brought Master Harry some water and coffee. Kreacher thinks Master Harry might have a headache this morning, Master Harry will need water.”
“Ronald Weasley, you are disgusting,” Hermione huffed. “I simply cannot fathom how your mind works.”
Harry knew Neville was referring to Draco’s affiliation to Voldemort and the fact he had fought with the Death Eaters at the Battle of Hogwarts.
Pansy turned back to Draco and gasped in horror. “What is that garbage you are wearing? That shirt is ghastly. Take it off right now and I’ll burn it. I have made you some simply gorgeous and exclusive shirts.” She pulled out a black shirt from one of the bags, it shimmered in the lights and, rather than being a buttoned shirt, it was a tunic style with a wide deep V-neck. “Come on darling, try it on.”
Harry tapped the disk with his wand to accept the call, he hoped that he wasn’t about to get a tirade of abuse from Hermione over papers ruined with coffee. She could rival a Howler when she really got going.
The record label had given Draco and the band a few days off over Christmas so Draco was able to spend the time with Harry at the Manor. Harry had received an owl from the Weasleys the previous night inviting him and Draco to Christmas dinner at The Burrow, which both surprised and pleased him.
“How did your date go with the guy from the accidental magic reversal squad?” Hermione asked. “He was cute.”
“Please don’t take this the wrong way,’ Draco said, “but I’m so tired I don’t think I would do myself any justice tonight.”
Draco finished up his wine. “I have to get going, I have sound check in an hour and I need to grab some stuff from home first.”
“I’m a bit nervous to tell the truth, the kids kind of scare me. They mess about in class, sneak around at night, do stupid things and never do as they are told. We weren’t like that were we?”
Harry breath stuck in his chest, Draco stood naked in front of him, he was exquisite, his lean body was perfect, sculptured like a Greek god that Harry remembered from his history classes at his Muggle school.
His bedroom was not the biggest in the house but he had turned the small room next to it into a master bathroom with a walk-in closet. He set his wine down on the vanity unit and stripped off to take a shower, one of the few things he had insisted on when he was having the house remodeled was for a huge walk in shower, after so many years of sharing cramped, cold bathrooms at Hogwarts he wanted to enjoy a shower in comfort. He spent a good ten minutes under the hot water, easing the crick in his neck and the aches in his shoulders from all the report writing he had completed that day, then flung on a pair of sweatpants and his old Gryffindor Quidditch jersey and headed downstairs to the study.
Draco led them through a maze of walkways to the stage, Harry could hear the chant of the crowd growing louder as they walked.
Harry lead them to their seats which were on a raised platform in a closed off area left of the stage marked VIP. The rest of the floor was standing only and the place was quickly filling up with thousands of fans.
The last words were whispered so quietly and with so much anguish that Harry’s heart went out to the blonde. Harry had always seen Draco as an arrogant, overconfident arsehole but at this moment all he saw was a scared and lost boy, and when Harry thought about it he realized that this was how Draco had been for weeks. The boy sitting opposite him was not the boy who had spent years taunting Harry and his friends, this was not the boy who had gotten the Ministry to order the execution of an innocent hippogriff and this was not the boy that had helped Umbridge uncover Dumbledore’s Army. This boy reminded Harry of himself, a boy full of fear and insecurity.
“Bloody hell mate,” Ron said, “it’s like you are obsessed with him. Next you will be telling us you know what colour his underwear is.” Ron narrowed his eyes. “You don’t know what colour his underwear is do you?”
“That’s because I am.” Draco placed a hand under Harry’s chin and lifted his face until their eyes met. “I wrote that song about you Harry.
“Pansy’s trousers still holding up?” Draco had told Harry the story of his ‘incident’ with the Muggle trousers he was wearing on stage splitting at the crotch which Harry had found hilarious.
Harry noted the change from Harry to Potter, his emotions were all over the place but eventually anger won out. It was all so fucking wrong.
“You’re so damn sexy Harry,” Draco breathed against Harry’s lips “you’ve been driving me wild for years.”
Harry laughed. “What can I say? I have a thing for handsome blonde haired boys who look good in a Quidditch kit.”
“I’m just having lunch with him,” Harry muttered. “We’re not seeing each other or anything, we’re not even friends really.”
“Err, that’s great, really great, umm, not the bone part clearly, that’s sounds painful, I mean it’s great that your designs are so in demand.” Harry winced as he saw Draco trying to smother his laughter.
at him. Now he was seeing him up close he realized how wretched he looked; he had always been pale but now he was so white he looked like one of the castle ghosts, and he had lost a lot of weight, his cheekbones prominent and his eyes sunken. He looked dreadful. Harry’s anger dissipated and was replaced with concern.
Harry flicked through the photos, they were mostly of Draco but one photo shot from the side of stage had captured Harry, Luna, Hermione and Ron. Harry clicked on a video but Ron leaned over and shut the laptop down.
He squeezed his way through the throng finally getting to a position where he could clearly see, and he stopped dead in his tracks.
Harry took another sip of wine and considered Draco’s message, although he seemed genuine Harry still didn’t quite trust him, but there was only one way to find out.
“Why did you end up in the Muggle world after your house arrest was up?” Harry asked digging into his meal.
“Oh, there were many times,” Hermione chuckled. “There was that time in sixth year when he was obsessed with you and –“
Harry’s stomach was fizzing, he had the strangest sensation of the potion expanding to the size of a quaffle ball then burst like a bubble. As soon as it burst his headache receded to nothing more than a slight nagging behind his eyes and the nausea completely disappeared, in fact he was starving hungry. He snatched a sandwich and ate it in three bites with a large gulp of coffee to wash it down.
Unfortunately Harry knew exactly which look Ron was referring to, he had seen it every day at Hogwarts.
Walter brought up a new webpage with a large photo of the lead singer. Harry stared at the photo, he couldn’t quite comprehend what he was seeing, but a glance at the tagline under the photo confirmed it.
“I can’t believe it, Draco Malfoy playing in a Muggle band to Muggle audiences.” Harry plopped down into one of the chairs outside the department door. “What the hell is that all about?”
Neville smiled. “Thanks Draco. You should come and visit the greenhouses, pick up any other herbs you need. You’ve not been back to Hogwarts since the Battle have you?”
“Doing really well, the new shop in France has really taken off and we are thinking of expanding into the rest of Europe. George is looking at potential locations in Germany this week.”
Draco wrapped his arms around Harry. “The memory will be forgotten but my feelings won’t, I’ve had them for years, and trust me Harry when I say if I ever have to choose between you and Him it will always be you. Always.” Draco’s own tears mingled with Harry’s as he pressed his cheek against Harry’s. “I’m yours Harry, I always have been and always will be, and maybe someday we can be Draco and Harry again but right now it has to be Malfoy and Potter.”
Harry was dragged awake by the sound of his phone ringing in the middle of the night. He fumbled to pick it up in the dark nearly dropping it on the floor, but his heart stopped when he saw it was Draco calling. It was three in the morning, people only called at that time when there was an emergency, maybe he was sick or had been injured. His heart was pounding as he accepted the call.
“Doesn’t make up for the two times we saved Malfoy’s arse during the Battle of Hogwarts,” Ron said, but there was no malice in his words and he had a ghost of a smile on his lips.
“I swear to Merlin that if you have done something stupid I will tell everyone about the pigeon incident.”
Harry woke in an unfamiliar bed. His head felt fuzzy and he could swear he could hear Draco talking to Ron; deciding he must be dreaming he let the conversation wash over him.
Harry continued to stare at the photo of Malfoy. His hair was longer than when he had last seen him at his trial at the Wizengamot, but it was still the same shade of platinum blonde, and he was as pale and slim as ever. He was pictured wearing a black shirt with several buttons undone exposing an expanse of white chest, and tight black jeans that hung very low on his narrow hips. He looked sexy as hell but the thing Harry noticed immediately was the fact that Malfoy was smiling. The smile totally transformed his face, he looked relaxed and happy, a million miles away from the scowling boy he had known at school.
“That’s fantastic!” Hermione reached over and squeezed Harry’s hand. “Wait, it’s not gobstones guy is it?”
“Draco, I’m so sorry.” Tears formed in Harry’s own eyes as he realized the hopelessness of the situation. “But if you go through with it you might die or be given the Dementor’s kiss if you are caught.”
“Mine too,” Draco agreed. “Malfoy Christmases were really prim and proper, really boring now I think about it.”
Harry did love Camden Market. The place was crowded with hundreds of market stalls selling everything from clothing, to second hand books and vinyl records, to bric-a-brac, to food, to handmade jewelry. It was bright, vibrant, and exotic; Harry had never seen anything like it and was fascinated by the mix of Muggles that wove between the stalls or haggled with stall owners over the price of their wares. Draco held Harry’s hand as he led him through the maze of small booths stopping every now and then to examine a piece of jewelry or an item of clothing. Several fans recognized Draco and asked for photos or autographs, Harry was annoyed when it happened to him in the wizard world but Draco was always polite, asking their names and saying a few words before moving on. Harry was truly amazed at the change in Draco. The sneering, arrogant, spiteful bully was totally gone and had been replaced with a generous, sensitive, caring man. Harry thought back to their lunch at the bistro where Draco had said that he had now become ‘
“What are you grinning about Potter? “ Draco said. “I distinctly remember you receiving the sharp edge of Hermione’s tongue on more than one occasion.”
“I missed you too Gryffindork,” Draco murmured, placing his lips on Harry’s, “more than you will ever know.”
Draco and Harry were playing a game of wizard chess, which Draco was winning by a long margin, when Neville arrived by the floo. Harry had invited him over as he was not good at having nothing to do and he was getting irritable at staying in bed.
Neville held out a bag to Draco. “Hermione mentioned that you had used up a lot of your herbs to treat Harry, I thought you might need to replenish your stocks.”
“Have you seriously not talked about how you are going to make it work between you? Do I need to lock you both in a room with a bottle of firewhisky so you can sort it out?”
“What the fuck are they talking about?” Harry said whilst trying to soak up the coffee with a wad of paper napkins.
Harry organized the party with the help of Ron as Hermione was busy planning for the wedding next month. Harry wanted a marquee in the grounds of Malfoy Manor, by the terrace with the fountain, with a music and food and fun. Ron was in charge of the marquee and the games and Harry was taking care of the rest. Harry had some fancy invitations printed with the date and time of the party and explicit instructions to not mention it to Draco as it was a surprise. He had invited everyone he could think of including Pansy who had sent Harry a long and vacuous letter giving him suggestions on colour schemes and decorations. Draco was due back from tour two days before his birthday. Harry was going to spend the time with him at his Camden apartment, leaving Ron and George to set everything up, and then take Draco to the Manor for the party. Harry was very pleased with himself, it was going to be the best party ever.
“Malfoy is in a Muggle rock band and you are worried about them using a spell as a name?” Harry said incredulously. “He’s in a
Harry closed his eyes, his hands still stoking himself as he thought about Draco; his hair, his eyes, his lip, his toned body.
Ginny shrugged. “Obviously it was a bit of a shock at first but Luna says he’s changed, you say he’s changed and Hermione said he seems different. I think mum and dad were a bit skeptical at first but they trust your judgement. It’s just Ron who is being a tosser about it.”
“Don’t worry, I’ll be on my best behavior, no starting any arguments with Ron. I wouldn’t do that to you at your party. Besides, I think Molly might clobber me with a frying pan if I did, she’s fierce when she wants to be.”
“Draco didn’t kill Fred.” Harry said, he was surprised his own voice was so calm. “Voldemort caused all those deaths including Fred’s.”
Harry smiled, Luna worked part time at The Quibbler with her father and still insisted that Nargles and other creatures existed despite any evidence to support them. After the war Luna had studied to be a mind healer and had helped several students deal with the trauma that had effected them all in one way or another. During the first year after they left Hogwarts she had sent Harry, Hermione and Ron a letter every month nattering on about her quest to find the elusive Crumple-Horned Snorkacks or some other random creature. Luna had often included pressed flowers, leaves or twigs from her garden in the letters, which Harry had discarded, but the letters had been very welcome in those first few months as he tried to adjust from being at Hogwarts to becoming a trainee Auror. He'd found it very lonely to be without his friends and  Luna's letters always made him smile.
“What is it Malfoy? What are you hiding?” Harry tightened his grip on Draco’s arm causing him to hiss and drop to his knees. The stinging sensation on his scar intensified. Harry started at the blonde in alarm.  “What the fuck is going on Malfoy?”
“No.” Hermione grabbed a bottle of firewhisky, dragged Harry and Ron into the guest bedroom and shut the door.
They talked for another thirty minutes, despite growing up in the Muggle word Harry hadn’t really lived in it for over five years and a lot of the things Draco spoke about went straight over his head. Equally, some of the wizarding subjects Harry talked about were now outside Draco’s experience. It was a complete role reversal of their lives during their years at Hogwarts. Harry reluctantly ended the call then headed to the kitchen to check that Kreacher had remembered Luna would be coming to dinner.
“Got us a couple of butterbeers,” Neville said resuming his seat. “I’m guessing from your note that this might be a multiple beer kind of conversation.”
It was a typical London morning in September, the streets were damp from an earlier rainstorm that had thankfully stopped, but it had left the air feeling damp and chilly. Harry had moved to London after the war taking over his godfather’s house and, despite being able to floo to work, still occasionally enjoyed riding the tube as he had in his youth. After the short walk from the Ministry building, Harry and Hermione were seated in comfortable armchairs around a small glass table in the
Harry shrugged, he finished his drink and stood up to leave. “Who knows? Anyway we won’t be talking to him, we will just be there watching him. Thanks for dinner Ron, it was amazing as always.”
The shower had helped to relax the tenseness from his shoulders but he still felt like he’d been kicked in the head by a hippogriff. He pulled on some old sweatpants and a long sleeved t-shirt and flopped back into bed, Kreacher had obviously been back whilst Harry had been in the shower as a new steaming cup of coffee sat on the bedside cabinet. He pushed the pillows up on the headboard to drink his coffee but something hard was pressing into his back making him very uncomfortable. He reached round and pulled out his phone. Another three missed calls and another text message from Draco. Harry knew he had to read the messages however much he didn’t want to, so with a shaking hand he unlocked the phone and opened up the message thread he had with Draco.
Like Harry, Draco had a huge walk in shower; it was white marble tiles, dual shower heads with a small marble bench in one corner. Harry stripped off his clothes and stepped into the shower letting the hot water cascade over his body, luxuriating in the warmth.
Ron rubbed the back of his neck. “Well, he did save your life, and he was proper upset when we got here, he was a total mess. It’s obvious he cares about you.”
Hermione gave Harry a withering look. “Absolutely not. We are not at Hogwarts anymore; you can write your own damn reports.”
“Really?” Harry was surprised. “I thought that there would be professors lining up to come to Hogwarts.”
Harry hadn’t watched Muggle TV for several years and was shocked by the number of channels to pick from. He flicked through dozens before landing on a channel where the movie
“Of course Master Harry,” Kreacher started to bow again but caught Harry’s disapproving look and decided against it. “Master Harry is a very busy and important man.”
Luckily the traffic was light, the journey took twenty five minutes so Harry was only fifteen minutes late by the time he arrived at the restaurant. Draco had chosen a small boutique bistro, it was a contemporary design with dark wood furniture and polished chrome fixtures, and the place looked full. Harry gave Draco’s name to the hostess who led him through to a booth towards the back to where Draco was drinking a glass of red wine. Draco rose to greet Harry and there was a rather awkward pause, Harry felt strangely self-conscious and he was relieved when Draco nodded to Harry indicating he should take a seat. Harry gratefully slid in to the booth taking off his hoodie as Draco sat back down.
’, and Harry couldn’t help but wonder how different things could have been at Hogwarts if that Draco had been the Draco he was now.
“Then it’s time you did. You are clearly in love with each other so you need to talk about how to make it work.”
Harry sucked at his knuckles, that spoon had really hurt. “I know, but it’s never felt like the right time to talk about it.”
When they reached Wizard Wheezes Harry gave Ron a hug. “Send everyone my love, tell them I’ll see them in the new year.”
“Enough.” Snape barked. “I’m sure there will be a plethora of future occasions where the pitiful Potter will provide cause for amusement with his dimwittedness but for now turn to page 472 of your books and proceed to read chapters 28 and 29. And do it quietly. Mr. Malfoy a word if I may.”
Harry replaced the chess pieces to their starting positions on the board. “We haven’t spoken about it.”
“I went to see this at the movie theatre as a re-release for Dudley’s sixth birthday. I wasn’t supposed to be going but Mrs. Figg had broken her wrist and was in hospital so there was no one to look after me. It was one of the few times the Dursley’s ever took me anywhere. I love this movie.”
“Harry, you know I love you but I’m not going to go behind Ron’s back. I’ll keep working on him and when he’s ready we’ll meet Draco together.”
“I’m sorry babe,” Draco whispered into Harry’s hair, “touring is really hard on me. I had to de-stress properly so that I could be myself. So that I could be with you.”
“And I recall you crying like a baby when Hermione punched you in third year,” Ron said, a big smile on his face, “that’s what being hit by a girl is like.”
“He was always kind to us when we were at the Manor, he brought us extra food when no one was looking, gave us warm blankets and cleaned up our clothes for us.”
“And to think I used to be jealous of all the attention you got at school from Potter fans.” Draco laughed.
Ginny was now the star player for the Holyhead Harpies and  Harry still felt somewhat guilty at how he and Ginny had broken up. They had tried to rekindle their romance after the war but neither were in a good place emotionally or psychologically, and although they went on a few dates Harry just didn’t have the same feelings for her, so after another huge row he broke things off. It was a short time later that Harry finally admitted to himself that he was gay. He had always felt awkward kissing Ginny, and he found the sex mundane and unsatisfying, it never really excited him. He was becoming increasing attracted to men and, after a drunken one night stand with a guy Harry met at a Quidditch match, he knew he was gay. He wished he could have had admitted that earlier rather than putting Ginny through the additional stress of their messy relationship. It had not been easy coming out to his friends but they had all been supportive and accepted who he was without any questions.
The last time Harry remembered seeing Pansy was when she tried to persuade the Hogwarts students to hand him over to Voldemort.
’ during his troubled years at Malfoy Manor, so the songs were all complete when the band formed, but now all the band members wanted input into the new album and the tracks were not coming together very well with four different writing styles.
“Crap.” Neville scrubbed at his face with his sleeve. “I always forget to check before I go out. One time I had half a dittany bush stuck in my hair at the start of year feast, the kids have never let me forget that.”
“Hi ‘Mione, just trying to write a report but I need caffeine. Want to go grab a coffee from the Muggle place we found a few weeks back?”
Neville chuckled. “I might have accidentally dropped a pot of stinksap in the classroom and locked the second year students in there for five minutes. Pomona wasn’t happy but the kids haven’t given me any trouble since.”
“Oh no, but we wrote to each other,” Luna replied. “He was effected by the war too, he suffered like everyone else. He knows the harm magic can do and it scares him now.”
“Looks like you are stuffed Harry,” Neville grinned, “no way you can win from that position. How are you feeling? Ron said you were pretty messed up.”
Harry woke to a pounding both in his head and on his head. He cracked open his eyes to see Kreacher standing on the bed whacking Harry over the head with a wooden spoon.
Harry glanced over at the girls who were excitedly reading a Muggle magazine; he couldn’t make out much except for the words Lumos Solem in large type at the top of the page they were reading.
With that Draco’s lips were on his own. The kiss started gently, just the barest of touches, a tiny suck at a lip, a quick swipe with the tip of a tongue, a light breath blown across the mouth. The kiss became deeper; mouths mashed together, tongues twirling against each other, sharp nips of teeth on lips, harsh panting breaths, stubble rasping against stubble. Harry was getting hard, the sexual tension was palpable, they were moments away from taking this from kissing to something more.
“You always were an insolent cur,” Rowle sneered. “Because of you I lost my standing with the Dark Lord and now you are going to pay.” He noticed Draco by Harry’s side. “Malfoy? You’re with Potter?” Rowle spat in Draco’s face. “Traitorous fucker. I heard they turned you into a squib, you and your bitch of a mother.”
“You know, “Hermione said, “to have the spell that bound his magical core removed. He was ordered to stay at Malfoy Manor for one year and banned from using magic for five years, the five years are now up so he came to get the spell reversed that prevented him from using his magic.”
Harry took the wine from the ancient house elf. “Thank you Kreacher, but you know you don’t have to cook me dinner every night.”
“This is perfect on the sofa, under a throw, watching a movie weather,” Draco said. He chucked the TV remote at Harry. “Pick a movie while I make a pot of tea.”
“He really does make me happy, he’s not the same Draco we knew from Hogwarts. I swear to Merlin that he’s more Hufflepuff than Slytherin now.”
Draco sipped at his coffee. “Now that you are feeling almost normal we should talk Harry, talk about last night, and about the kiss.”
“She’s great thanks Kreacher,” Neville stepped out of the fireplace and shook off the remnants of floo powder from his clothes.
Harry finished his wine, went up to bed and lay contemplating the text message exchange with Draco. He had actually enjoyed bantering with him and was surprised that Draco had a sense of humour that wasn’t just mean and nasty as it had been at school.
Dean Street Studio was tucked away between a lobster roll bistro and a high-end patisserie shop on Dean Street, not too far from The Leaky Cauldron. The studio had a rich history of recording Muggle artists, most of whom Harry had never heard of, although Take That and Spandau Ballet were names he recognized. Draco was there to record the vocals on ‘
“Hello Kreacher, hello Harry, I brought some Fringlefruit flowers, they are in bloom right now. Quite lovely don’t you think?”
Harry looked at the card on which was printed Draco’s name, address and phone number. The address was in Camden Town that, although not so far from Grimmauld Place, was not an area that Harry knew well but knew it was an area where trendy Muggles liked to hang out. Harry put the card and letter back in the envelope and shoved it in his backpack, he had a lot of work to do and couldn’t be distracted by thoughts of Draco, his feelings were complicated when it came to the blonde who had been such a dick to him over the years. Kicking the backpack under his desk Harry focused on the task of tracking the movement of owls that he suspected of delivering messages to some dark wizards, and Draco, for the time being, was forgotten.
Harry knew that Draco was behind the opal necklace that had cursed Katie Bell, he was so fucking sure of it, but he just couldn’t prove it. He didn’t trust that Slytherin bastard one inch. Draco had been acting suspiciously all year; sneaking around at night, disappearing into the Room of Requirement, and being even more shifty than usual. Hermione, Ron and even Dumbledore thought he was making mountains out of gnome hills but he knew that Draco was up to no good. He was going to find out what Draco was doing, what he was planning, what he was hiding; but he’d have to do it alone, he couldn’t rely on Ron or Hermione, they thought he was seeing things that weren’t there. But he knew, he fucking knew.
Bill chucked over a large lumpy parcel to Draco, Harry knew exactly what it contained just by looking at it. Draco looked somewhat nervous as he opened it, he pulled apart the paper to reveal a large green hand knitted sweater with a silver D embroidered on the front.
“I don’t fucking care anymore, you can argue all night if that’s what it takes, but I’m fed up with this. You are
“You know she’s really pissed when she swears like that,” Harry said. “I can’t remember the last time she swore.”
Tilly let out a squeal that was followed by a sharp crack as she apparated from the room, presumably back to Malfoy Manor. As soon as the elf was gone Draco dropped his head back to his knees and Harry could hear muffled sobs which wracked the boy’s slight frame. Harry swallowed around a lump in his throat; the sight of Draco in such distress wrenched at his gut, Draco was always so composed and to see him so vulnerable was unnerving. Conflicting thoughts ran through Harry’s mind; he wanted to confront the boy, find out what he was planning, but it felt wrong to intrude when Draco was obviously distraught. The choice was made for him when Draco raised his head and saw Harry standing in the doorway. The Slytherin scrambled to his feet wiping his sleeve over his eyes and glared at Harry, a mix of embarrassment and fear fliting across his face before it was replaced with anger.
“Happy birthday Master Draco!”  The house elves were all dressed in clean vests and most of them had even cleaned their faces.
Draco whined as Harry withdrew his fingers. “I need you inside me Harry, I want to be whole with you.”
Draco poured a glass and slid it across the table to Harry along with the lunch menu. “So you are an Auror now, do you enjoy it?”
Draco’s face was still stony. “This is an important question Harry so please be truthful. Did you kiss me because you wanted to or because you were drunk?”
Harry lost the tiny piece of control he had left over his temper. “I’ll tell you what is fucked up,” he shouted. “Fucked up is when your best friend thinks calling my boyfriend a Death Eater to my face is acceptable. Fucked up is when your best friend is acting like an utter twat because I’m in love with a guy who you cannot even give a single second to trying to get to know. Fucked up is when your best friend puts his own bigoted views above our friendship.”
“I’m fine, wounds are healing up, and my strength is coming back with the blood restoration potions Draco has been force feeding me.”
Draco stopped dead in his tracks when he saw the marquee. “Is that what I think it is? Have you planned me a surprise birthday party?”
“I’m always mad at him, “Hermione sniffed. “This isn’t your fault Harry this is down to Ron. I may not like Draco, but if you think he’s the one for you and he makes you happy then I will give him a chance. You are my best friend and you always will be.”
“Draco I –“ Harry’s words were cut off as Draco leaned down and silenced him with a crushing kiss, his tongue pushing  into his mouth , sucking and nipping at the delicate skin of Harry’s lips. Harry moaned as Draco placed small kisses along Harry’s jawbone working towards the soft spot behind his ear, then kissed and sucked his way down Harry’s neck. He reached his collarbone, running his tongue along the bony ridge to the soft hollow where it met the shoulder, sucking hard. Harry arched his back as Draco’s kisses turned in to small bites working his way down his chest towards his nipple that hardened along with his cock. He sucked in a sharp breath when Draco took the nipple in his mouth rolling the hard nub of flesh between his lips, licking and sucking, and a hand trailed lightly across his stomach, a touch so light that it felt like a soft breeze on his skin. Draco’s fingers danced across the skin above the waistband of his sweatpants, Harry raised his hips to allow Draco to pull them off, a low moan escaped his lips as Draco removed the rest of his own clothing.
“I really need to brush up on my Muggle studies,” Harry said. “How did you manage when you first started out in the Muggle world?”
“Same thing I always did at school, I faked it. Got into a few sticky situations, almost got myself killed trying to use a hair dryer while sitting in the bath, but it all worked out eventually. The internet helped a lot.”
Harry looked over at Draco, who was now on his knees, his face pale and clammy and the wand wavering wildly in his hands. Their eyes met.
“Let me introduce you to the rest of the band.” Draco led him round the room introducing him to the various band members, they all seemed nice guys but Harry felt out of his depth when they started asking him about his musical tastes. He thought back to Dudley’s record collection at Privet Drive, the only band that he could remember was Queen, and he only remembered that because of the song
“Exactly Potter, he would have taken my feelings and used them for something dark and evil.” Draco’s voice hitched and Harry realized he was crying again. “I couldn’t let that happen.”
“I don’t think Ron will see it like that.” Harry pushed back his plate, his appetite gone. “A lot of people won’t.”
Harry and Ron had emerged an hour later, very drunk but on much better terms. They still had some resentments to iron out but Ron was willing to accept Draco as Harry’s boyfriend, and their friendship was beginning to heal. The party had been a success and Harry had a great time catching up with everyone, especially Hagrid whom Harry had very much missed since leaving Hogwarts. Harry finally got home in the early hours of the morning with a promise from Ron to meet with him and Draco once Draco had returned from touring.
“It’s ok, I know the way.” Harry called out to Hermione with a wink at Ron who gave him a grateful smile.
Harry felt his face flood with heat as the Slytherin contingent broke into sniggers, including Draco who formed his thumb and forefinger into an L and placed it on his forehead mouthing ‘loser’ as he did so.
“I know you won’t.” Draco kissed Harry gently on the lips. “I love you too my little Gryffindork, I love you to the moon and back.”
“It’s only as complicated as you make it Harry. The only people who matter in this are you and Draco.”
“Master Neville is here Master Harry.” Kreacher announced even though Neville was already enveloping Harry in a hug.
‘That’s what I’m worried about,” Hermione muttered under her breath. “That’s exactly what I’m worried about.”
Draco passed bottles of water to Pansy and Harry whilst gulping down a bottle himself. Harry was grateful for the water, although he had only been standing on the stage watching it had been very hot and he was thirsty.
Hermione giggled. “Are you sure it’s actually Draco! Ron is still angry about you seeing him but he’s missing you. He’s missing you enough that he agreed to invite you.” Hermione slid a small white envelope across the table to Harry.
Harry rejoined the line and made his way through the metal detector meeting Luna on the other side who was looking at the stall selling Lumos Solem merchandise.
“Just when I thought you couldn’t get more attractive, you add cooking to the list of things you are good at.”
“The now is because after going to the Ministry I want to see if I can fit back in the wizarding world, I’m not sure I want to but I would like know if it’s possible. The why you…..” Draco looked Harry directly in the eyes, “It’s you because you are the one person that I wanted to be my friend then, and I still want you to be my friend now.”
Malfoy had never used Harry’s first name before and it threw him off balance. “Err…yes, thanks for the invite...Draco.” Harry had come to think of him as Draco in his mind but the name still felt odd on his lips.
Draco slowly turned around. Their eyes met. “I have feelings for you too Malfoy, I just didn’t recognize them for what they were until now.”
Harry had been so angry when he got home that even Kreacher stayed out of his way, cowering in his nest of bedding in the kitchen scullery. Harry had shouted, screamed, thrown things around but now he just sat on his bed, head in hands crying. He and Ron had so much history together; they’d grown up together, shared a dorm together, studied together, fought together, almost died together, he was family, yet Ron was happy to throw that all away just because he didn’t like who Harry was dating. Harry wiped his eyes and sent a message to Draco.
“Seriously Pans, are you sure these wont split.” Draco exited the bathroom adjusting himself in his trousers. Harry had to advert his eyes as his own cock jumped.
Harry handed over the Christmas gifts he had for Ron, Hermione and the rest of the Weasley family. He usually spent Christmas at The Burrow but this year he wanted to spend it with Draco, and he wasn’t entirely sure he would be welcome at the Weasley’s given his relationship with Draco.
Draco raised his head and Harry could see the tears rolling down his face. “Then tell my father it will be done.”
“You mean that Malfoy can use magic again?” Ron seethed. “You’d better get the Aurors to keep an eye on him Harry, a gringlecat never changes it’s spots.”
“Right, you just carry on thinking that my little Gryffindork. I’m sorry about Ron, having your friends turn your back on you is awful. Only Pansy stuck by me after the war.”
“It wasn’t the kind of thing I could talk about in my family. It had been arranged for me to marry Daphne Greengrass, but after the war the agreement, thankfully, was broken.’
He scrolled down the page over the other band members who were all good looking but not in the same league as Malfoy. Harry clicked on a link at the bottom of the page to ‘live performances’ and nearly fell out of his chair when the screen switched to footage of Malfoy drenched in sweat, microphone grasped in his hand, standing at the front of the stage singing to an ecstatic crowd. He lifted the microphone out over the crowd where hundreds of hands reached up towards him, eager to touch him or catch the small plastic items, guitar picks Harry later learnt, that he threw out in to the sea of people. Quite belatedly, Harry realized he was watching with the sound off so he hit the volume button and suddenly the room filled with music. It was loud, incredibly loud, screeching guitars and pounding drums creating a sheer avalanche of music, yet somehow over the top of all that Malfoy’s voice rang out clear and true.
Draco is back from tour and Harry is rather excited. Harry also learns a bit more about Draco and Lumos Solem.
“Because I love you my beautiful little Gryffindork,” the smile that lit up Draco’s face was something that Harry wanted to hold in his memory forever, “because I love you.”
Ron said nothing but he poured two glasses of firewhisky handing one to Harry. Ron sprawled out on the bed, eyes fixed on the ceiling, while Harry took the loveseat under the window and sipped on his whisky. The silence was excruciating but Harry knew better than to be the one to speak first. In the end the silence was broken by a ping from Harry’s phone indicating he had a message.
“Jackass,” Harry said with a smile. “Luna is coming over for dinner tonight, I’ve not seen her for a while what with moon frog mating season and a plague of gulping plimpies.”
The streets outside the venue were crowded with fans, many of whom were wearing shirts with the Lumos Solem band logo on the front. Harry had asked Neville the previous night about the meaning of a green rose and it apparently represented fertility, it seemed an odd choice for Malfoy to use in conjunction with the symbols for Slytherin and his wand but he knew it must hold some significance. Harry spotted Luna standing by the box office, she was wearing a yellow dress with huge orange spots, a silver belt made of bottle caps, purple shoes, and what looked like a necklace made of hay wrapped around her neck. Harry made his way over to her and shortly after Hermione and Ron appeared through the crowd. Hermione waved a hand at them but Ron merely scowled, it was evident that he was not pleased at being there and Hermione all but dragged him by the hand to join them.
“Ha ha ha!” Ron fell about laughing. “You have a Weasley sweater, I never in my life thought I’d see a Malfoy in a Weasley sweater.”
Draco broke down into quiet sobs, he was clearly still traumatized by everything he had seen and been part of.
Ron had prepared a lunch of handmade flatbreads and a salad, it was tasty as all his meals were, but Harry had very little appetite. He didn’t want to ruin Ron and Hermione’s excitement by telling them about Draco but if he left much longer it the would be worse. Hermione was happily chattering about wedding favours and flower arrangements, Ron was nodding and agreeing with everything she said, Harry knew he was being a twat but he had to tell them today.
Hermione’s face flushed scarlet. “Well he does. Anyhow, I need to get back to work. Are you still coming over for dinner on Friday night? Ron will be back from France and Nev and Luna are coming over too.”
“I’m sorry I interrupted,” Harry whispered back, “I just missed you so much that I couldn’t wait to see you.”
“He hasn’t told us much about it, just that it was a very exclusive school and it got pretty fucked up while he was there.”
Draco made good use of his new Muggle camera taking photos of all the good memories. And there were plenty; Patsy got drunk and ended up making out with George, much to Draco and Harry’s amusement, Neville fell into a bush getting stuck until a laughing Draco pulled him free, Molly was dancing wearing only one shoe and Hagrid set his beard alight on one of the floating candles.
The months sped by. Draco had gone back to work as soon as the Christmas celebrations were over, the album was released the first week of March and the band went straight out on tour. Harry went back to work as an Auror but he would be leaving soon, he had found a new position that he knew would make him much happier so he was just biding his time until he could leave.
Harry and Hermione fell into a comfortable silence, in the way old friends do. Hermione was making notes on the research papers and Harry was enjoying sipping his coffee when a shriek from a girl at the next table made Harry drop his coffee cup in shock.
Kreacher attempted a bow but again toppled over, Ron picked him up setting him back on his feet and the elf scurried back to the kitchen clutching his coin.
They made their way down to the backstage entrance, Ron grumbled the whole way with Hermione scalding him in stern whispers, they held up their passes to the security who opened the barrier to let them pass through. The backstage was frantic with the road crew packing away instruments and dismantling the stage set. Harry led the way through the sea of activity to a door marked ‘Hospitality’ that took them into a large room with sofas, tables and a full bar, it was full of people chatting and although Harry noted the other band members Draco was nowhere to be seen.
Harry could hear heavy footsteps moving away, he tried to open his eyes; it was an effort just to make that small movement.
“Are you sure?” Harry’s heart was beating hard in his chest, he had not had sex for a long time and he thought he might come there and then.
Neville was silent for several minutes. “You know I’m just worried about you Harry. I don’t want to see you get hurt. If Draco is still - ”
“I’m not obsessed, I just really like the music,” Harry said indignantly, “and what do you mean again?”
Harry pondered all this as he made his way to the Muggle Liaison Office where he found Hermione standing at the door to the office chewing on a fingernail.
“Hi,” Harry said, “did you need to see me about a case?” As an Auror Harry often gave evidence at trials but it was unusual for the clerks to visit him in his office.
After dinner came the usual round of pickup Quidditch. Harry, George and Draco played against Ginny, Ron and Charlie, it was a hard fought game and by the end everyone had lost count of the score so they called it a draw. Under Harry’s advice Draco had bought his guitar with him, he played some Weird Sisters songs that got everyone up and dancing, and then some of his own songs, which everyone declared to be fantastic.
“There is no specific law preventing it,” Hermione said, “I checked. Whilst it’s obviously frowned upon it’s not illegal under any wizard regulations.”
“Green roses, they are gorgeous, I love green roses.” Draco gave Harry a long lingering kiss. “Thank you, that’s so thoughtful of you. No one has ever bought me flowers before.”
curse in order to bend him to the task of killing Dumbledore. No wonder Draco had now turned his back on magic, Harry thought, he had seen enough dark magic to last a lifetime.
The discussion moved on to other topics. They spent the rest of the time drinking, talking and laughing about old times and new until the early hours. Neville left first, shortly followed by Luna, Hermione went to bed leaving Harry to have a final glass of firewhisky with Ron.
“Exactly. I wrote that song about coming back from the brink and I though it sounded cool as a band name.”
Draco led Harry to the bedroom, he held Harry’s face in his hands kissing him gently, running his tongue along Harry’s bottom lip then darting it in to Harry’s mouth. He swirled his tongue around Harry’s mouth connecting with his tongue, placed a hand on the back of Harry’s head and pulled him closer, crushing their lips together. Draco tangled his fingers into unruly brown locks whilst the other slipped under Harry’s shirt tracing small circles on the skin of his back. A soft moan escaped Harry’s mouth as Draco pressed his body against him, the blonde’s erection digging into Harry’s hip as he ground his pelvis against him.
“Well he does have more to feel guilty about.” Ron held up his hands at the murderous look on Harry’s face “Ok, ok. I’m sorry. Look, I’m willing to give him a chance but the second he goes all Malfoy on me I’m done.”
Draco had prepared eggs benedict, a huge pile of bacon, French toast, sliced fruits with yogurt and a carafe of fresh coffee.
“Badly. Matt and Rupe got into a huge argument today, Rupe actually threw a cymbal at Matt, thank Merlin he throws like a girl or it could have taken Matt’s head off. Dan and I had to break it up.” Draco snuggled his head into Harry’s neck. “This is nice. I like having my hair stroked.”
Draco led Harry by the hand into the main room of the apartment; it was a huge open plan room with the far wall almost completely taken up by floor to ceiling windows and a sliding door leading to a substantial balcony. There was a contemporary kitchen of marble, granite and stainless steel appliances with a breakfast bar, a dining area and a lounge area with several large sofas and an enormous TV mounted on the wall above an inset gas fire.
Despite the pain of his wounds this was the happiest Harry had been in months, years even. He was with the man he loved, and who loved him back, and his best friends seemed to be finally accepting Draco into their lives.
“She’s doing very well, she was pretty shaky for a couple of years, especially after father died, but she’s much better now. She spends most of her time at our place in the South of France, she was always good at herbology so she has a small florist business there. Non magical of course.”
“I can work with this,” Draco said handing Harry a glass of wine. “Go watch TV or take a shower whilst I make dinner.”
Hermione and Ron lived in a large cottage in the suburbs of London, Hermione, who had always loved her ancient runes class, had renamed the cottage Jeram after the rune representing the end of a cycle and the beginning of a new age. Harry stepped out of the floo and was greeted by the delicious smell of roast beef wafting from the kitchen.
“I don’t really know but I wasn’t going to take any chances, I know he and you are connected somehow so I blocked my mind and yours then flung up a barrier around us. It hurt like a bitch to repel the mark’s magic, but that’s why your scar was stinging.”
Rowle’s boots appeared in Harry’s view. “Not so fucking cocky now are you Potter.” One boot moved to kick him in the ribs. Harry felt the bone snap but he could do nothing except grunt. “There are those that would pay handsomely to have the great Harry Potter in their dungeons, I could make a fortune from you, but I’d rather have the pleasure of killing you myself.” Another kick, another broken rib.
Harry smiled. “I have everything I need. I borrowed one of Hermione’s spells, this bag holds a lot more than it appears to.”
Harry laughed, elves did not get the concept of sarcasm apparently. “I’ll just go back to the library.”
“Great, saves me a lot of explaining,” Walter grinned. “I did a google search for Lumos Solem and it popped right up, top hit on the browser!”
Harry took Draco out for a birthday brunch where he gave him his gift, a Muggle camera so that he could take photographs of their happy memories. Harry had told Draco that he had another gift but it was at the Manor, not very inventive but it worked. Harry had told the guests to arrive at three in the afternoon, he took Draco over at three thirty.
Harry grinned. “Yes. He’s just so amazing.” Harry and Draco had spent every minute they could together over the last two weeks and their relationship was deepening with every passing day. “I hate that he’s leaving to go back out on tour next week, he’ll be gone for four weeks.”
