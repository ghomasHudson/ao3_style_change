Ron blushed, his cheeks matching his fiery hair and the scarlet of his Auror uniform. “Well, I… I wanted to ask you if you’d like to have lunch with me?”
There was a man I knew, Johnny or Benny or something equally as traditional and coy. I'm rubbish with names when all I want to do is fuck. Anyway, he would greet me with a smile and after we were done discussing the shipment, he would take me into the warehouse, push me against a wall, and fuck my thighs. He liked to pull my hair when he did it, and I can't say I hated it. My favorite memories are of when he'd let me do him, though. Those thighs of his… they'd press around my cock like they were made for it. I'd push into that muscled clench, his balls brushing over the top of my prick, his drooling precome with every one of my thrusts...
Harry presses at the underside of Draco's cockhead, holds his wand there as his other hand reaches for Draco's balls and the cockring. Everything is swimming around Draco, lost in the sea of overwhelming pleasure. He's going to drown in it. He's going to die.
"Harry." His name is all warning. "Ah, I'm close."
For the first ten minutes of Malfoy's lecture, Harry finds himself too distracted by the heads still turning his way to pay much attention to what the man's saying. But as the other students stop looking at him and start listening to Malfoy, Harry finds himself doing the same.
They fight about it for a long time after.
He tries his best to not listen to Potter's nightmares through the wall.
The maître d' shows them to what is likely the best table in the house, then offers them both menus. Draco isn't entirely sure when the man picked them up or if he was hiding them somewhere in his jacket, but as he handles the thick cardstock, he's again impressed by the quality of the restaurant. As he starts looking through the offerings for the evening, an eyebrow raises without his consent.
"I haven't been able to stop thinking about it," Harry says softly, though his hand is rough on his prick. "The way you looked that night."
He was nearly finished cleaning the barroom, with chairs sitting upside down on the tabletops, when a knock on the door startled him. Turning, he froze, a chair still in his hands, waiting to be set down.
"Talking to her date," Potter says before frowning. "I'm sorry, did I say something wrong?"
it all had to come from somewhere. You can't ship things via Floo. There's too much uncertainty about which fireplace you'll end up at, too much volatility in sending sensitive goods through literal flames. Apparition is just as bad. You've Sided-Along someone, of course. Now imagine doing it with a wooden crate weighing two tonnes.
just the one time, yeah?"
He doesn't mean to speak, but his blood is burning through him like poison, and his need is growing with every painful twist of the man's hand in his hair.
"Not in my pub," Harry said, laughing. He didn't stop undressing, though. "There's a flat upstairs."
"Right." Draco looks at Potter, who helpfully shrugs. Trying to bend his voice towards polite dismissal, he says, "Well, thank you for letting us know."
isn't half-bad. A bit tinny, if he isn't concentrating, but cool and consistent. It'll get him through the rest of the day.
and sighs. "I need to meet Ron for lunch. You okay in here on your own?"
"Do you want me to… Can I… Draco, I want to be good for you."
"How can I help you?" he asks, voice threaded with exhaustion and a tone that indicates he's ready to be screamed at for at least the hundredth time that day.
"Just something I've always wanted to do," Draco said as he shoved Harry's ruined shirt down his arms. "Get naked."
"Put it in my mouth," Harry says as he draws Draco's pants down. "I want to taste you."
"Oh, Gods, yes." Draco thrust into the expanse of Harry's palm. Groaning, he kissed Harry again and again. "Touch me, please."
It took him a month to realize that what he really needed was a job. Something to keep his hands and mind busy. Fame, of course, made it difficult to do. Oh, he didn't have any problems being offered work. There were endorsement deals arriving daily, flocks of owls settling in his garden in some great, migratory pattern that ornithologists would have loved to study. The Cannons even offered Harry the starting Seeker position on their team (he did
Harry's heart is thundering in his ears. His muscles clench. "What'd you do, Malfoy?"
There's something about the piercing purity of agony that makes his pleasure that much sweeter, but even as he learns his body and this side of himself, there's something missing.
There's a shout from the dance floor, and Potter glances towards it like someone hunted. When the crowd starts singing along with the indistinct pop song, the tension radiating through his body eases. "Why are you here, then?"
"I always want you to be rough with me when we do these things, Harry. I thought you'd caught on by now."
"Possibly. They always get a bit out of sorts when the seasons change."
If he thought that this would be a soft, gentle thing, Potter quickly disabuses him of that notion. He doesn't let Draco go, just levitates him over to the closest wall and pushes Draco against it. Potter bites at the nape of his neck, then licks over the sting.
"No," Harry says as he slides his other hand around Draco's waist to rest over the curve of his arse, over the curve of scales and petals. "I saw it before then. I wondered who you were, then. What you looked like on the other side of that fire." Harry lets his gaze drag across Draco's skin like a touch, lets it linger like he's never let himself before, lets it settle on Draco's lips. "What your mouth would taste like."
Draco curses and falls back, and as Harry pushes himself up, Draco's mouth falls open.
Draco goes to step around Harry, but Harry grabs him again. This time, though, his fingers are wrapped around the breadth of Draco's forearm, the touch somehow more intimate than the one around his wrist had been.
They both fumble for their joggers. Harry only pulls his low enough to get his prick out. He's never been a fan of running in boxers, and he knows the exact moment Malfoy realizes that Harry's been out here without pants this entire time. Cursing, Malfoy pushes his joggers to his knees and pulls his cock out from the slit in his boxer-briefs. They're black and tight around his thighs, and Harry's struck by the beauty of Malfoy's ruddied cock against all of that tight, inky black.
"Goyle's lying down, though," Ron offers helpfully.
Semen lands hot and warm on Harry's face, across the lenses of his glasses in off-white smears. He opens his mouth, tastes it on his tongue, feels it on his lips. It's hot and bitter, and as Malfoy's shakes, Harry squeezes his grip tighter, dragging another spurt from Malfoy's body.
Draco swallows his tongue, then chokes on it.
"It's not that kind of party game, Weasley," Malfoy says.
"How long, Malfoy?"
"No one." Draco's words come out as a croak, and though he wants to tear at the painful press of Potter's arm, he keeps his hands loose by his sides. "Honestly, Potter. I wasn't looking for you in a bloody Muggle bar."
Potter sighs when he takes his robes off. Settling them over the back of his chair, he sits with a pleased sound. "That's much better. You think they've mucked up the climate control spells?"
Draco is frozen still and on fire.
With want?
Gods help him, but Draco tilts his hips so that Potter can get deeper inside of him, can brush his fingers against the bundle of nerves that light Draco up inside. When Potter scissors his fingers apart, Draco keens, head thrown back, chest against the brick, cock hard and leaking.
"You know," Potter says between mouthfuls, "I never expected you to go into Muggle Outreach."
Malfoy's prick, still hard and shining with lube, gives a contradictory twitch.
"I am a grown man, Potter. I don't need constant supervision."
"Sorry," Draco says as he pulls back. "Fuck, didn't mean to do that."
"He's okay, actually. I've gotten to know him a bit better the last couple of months."
"Here," he says, offering the glass to Draco. He drains the glass in long, slow swallows, and Harry tamps down the embers of desire rekindled by the line of Draco's throat and arched neck. When Draco hands the glass back, Harry asks, "Do you need more?"
"Did you find anything?" Draco asks instead, wiping the sweat from his skin.
He hurries to the restroom, unaware that Harry doesn't sit, just stares after Draco and the flash of snakeskin and peonies along his lower back.
It's so hard, it aches. Pleasure is rooted low and deep in his center, its tangled roots wrapped around every painful inch of his overworked body. Even the cool air of the room is too much stimulation. He can't tell if he's sweating from the strain on his body or the fever in his blood.
"But the potion one, that one, we're going to have to talk about. I didn't like that one at all."
Three months after the renovations were complete,
. This place where you're just Harry, and not
Harry's hand brushes Draco's shoulder, and he tries to arch into the caress, but it's gone as soon as it arrives. Draco tilts his head to the side, searching for something, desperate.
"Draco…" Potter takes a hesitant step forward, his own skin golden and glistening.
Still frowning, Harry stands up and turns to the bookshelf behind his desk. He reaches up, competent fingers running over the line of folders neatly tucked into the top shelf. "I don't even know how you can see it."
They're standing so close that Harry can feel Malfoy's panted exhalations. Dizzy with desire, Harry bends in closer, close enough that his nose brushes the curve of Malfoy's shoulder. He rests in that almost-touch and breathes in the sweat-fresh scent of Malfoy.
Draco grabs Harry's hand and forces Harry's wrist up, baring Draco's name scrawled across it. "Because I own you, Potter. And as long as you're mine, you'll do what you're told."
"You're dead," he whispers. "I killed you. You died."
"Drink," Harry says as he puts a glass to Draco's mouth. Draco sips at the cool water gratefully, letting it spill from the corners of his mouth in his enthusiasm. "Slowly. You'll make yourself sick."
He pulled Draco's mouth down to his own, kissing the smug laughter from Draco's lips.
"In the…" The implication hits Harry low in the gut, and his denims go tight. At this rate, his cock's going to fall off from the aerobics it's gotten up to today. "Okay. I'll see you Saturday, then."
"Would you believe me if I said to get a drink?"
. It's bright like freshly fallen snow in sunlight, soft like the winter coat of his family's Clydesdales. The touch of Potter's lips on Draco's whips through him like a winter storm, so cold it burns.
It'd be pretty if Draco weren't terrified of irreparably damaging Potter's brain.
. I come to this stupid, low-brow pub, and I watch you work, and I keep thinking that you'll get it, that one day, it'll all click in that brain of yours, and it never bloody does. And I'm tired of it. I'm tired of coming here and, like an idiot, hoping. So unless you've finally managed to pull your head out of your arse, this is it."
Potter lifts a hand to his own throat. The sleeves of his shirt tighten. Fingers dance over his own button, and then it slides free, persuaded by a gentle touch to fall apart. Potter sighs. "That does help, doesn't it?"
Draco's mouth opens, but Voldemort's hand stops his protest. "Yes, Draco. I do believe it's time for some entertainment. Why don't you show us what the Boy Who Lived is good for these days?" When Draco doesn't move, Voldemort's tone goes hard and unyielding. "Now."
Perhaps worst of all, Malfoy's jacket is made of tweed with leather patches on the elbows, a white shirt and black waistcoat underneath, and Harry has to fight down the rush of heat the courses through him at the thought of Malfoy, all prim and properly put together, being ruined by Harry's hands and mouth.
"Such a shame," Draco says as he stares across the lunchroom again while Potter tries to return his lunch tray to the cleaning rack. "I really should have less interest in intelligence when it comes to my men."
"What a lovely thing you are." Harry gasps as the man releases his grip. "Breathe. That's good."
The office is like an oven, waves of heat pounding against his body and drawing more sweat to the surface. It clings to the curves of his shoulders, the dip of his elbow, the tendons at his wrists. It pools in his palms, and as he watches, a drop falls from his fingertips to land on the desk.
the best weather for the people in the room, they're
Uncertain if he should approach Malfoy now or after the class has emptied, Harry stands next to the drying cauldrons, trapped by indecision. Malfoy has his head down, flipping through papers—likely the reviews he mentioned—with hardly any attention paid to the Trainees gathering their stuff to leave. Harry watches them file out of the class, their voices bright with success, and feels doubt sink its claws into his gut. He'll find Malfoy later, maybe try to ask him then. As Harry moves to join the mass of leaving students, Malfoy's voice cuts through the noise.
Draco can see a sweat-dampened vest from behind the gaping front of Potter's shirt. It's white and doing very little to hide the muscled chest beneath it. As he stares, Potter shifts, and his shirt falls further open. Draco sees the curved shadow of a nipple and finally tears his eyes away.
" the maître d' replies, also in French. "
Harry Potter off-balance and screaming at Draco should not be attractive. But as he drinks his tea and takes in the unsteady but righteous fury of Potter in a full strop, Draco has to admit there's something alluring about it. It might be the flush high on Potter's cheeks, or the bit of blood still clinging to his neck. Perhaps the way his muscles tense and relax as he paces, or the narrowed, unfocused glares he keeps tossing at Draco.
He waits precisely two minutes before he starts undoing the fastenings on his robe. Not wanting to look too eager, he takes his time with it. It's a full five minutes before he shrugs off the robe. The rush of air against his overheated skin is pure bliss, and the slight breeze he feels when he walks the robe to the coat rack, hanging it neatly beside his greatcoat, is a delightful relief.
He's nearly there when a familiar voice hollers his name, sharp and pointed, down the hallway. Glancing over his shoulder, he stops walking and waits for Pansy to catch up.
"Can you get me out of this bloody
"Hush, love." Harry busses a kiss on Draco's forehead. "I'm going to get you some water. Are you cold?"
The room is stifling.
"Yes, of course. One moment, please."
Draco's cock twitches, aching.
Eyes closed, Harry falls into the motion of Draco's cock in his mouth. It brushes the back of Harry's throat, but he doesn't gag, doesn't choke. He breathes through his nose and brings Draco as deep inside of his mouth as he can. He would devour Draco if he could, but he'll take this taste instead.
"I'm going to take that as a compliment, Potter, and you can't stop me." Draco slides a bit deeper into his chair, letting memory sweep over him. "I wasn't surprised when they arrested me, not really. I'd been expecting it after they came for my father. Something about their eyes as they took him away… The magical cuffs burn, did you know that? I thought my hands were going to fall off, it hurt so badly. But then they took them off, and they told me what they needed me to do, and that, somehow, hurt more. No one had ever asked me to be a hero before, and here was the Ministry and the Head Auror, begging me to help them.
"Do about what?"
It's the smallest bit of a caress. Knuckles against knuckles. Nothing soft or gentle about it, just bones clacking into bones. But it makes Malfoy curse again before his eyes slam shut and his back arches, and he nearly sends Harry tumbling onto the mattress as he comes.
Laughing, Draco returned the favor. He threw Harry's bar cloth away carelessly, then placed his hands at the collar of Harry's flannel shirt, raised his eyebrow, and
Potter's hands still on his buttons. "I hope you don't mind if…"
Glancing from Malfoy to Seamus, Dean raises an eyebrow. "Trousers off?"
"What about pants?" Harry keeps his eyes on Dean, doesn't let his gaze drift where it wants to go.
"Of course. No one's hurt when their wallet goes missing."
Draco is spread out across the sheets, his arms and legs still stretched towards the corners of the bed, even though the ropes are gone. There's a bit of redness around his joints, and Harry runs tender fingers over the marks, healing them as he goes.
Threaded through them all, though, are the deeper riddles. The questions that have no answer, no matter how many ways you ask them.
Harry blurts out, "Coffee," and watches as Malfoy's stern expression is washed away by confusion. "Do you like coffee?"
"I hope you're struggling to find a suitable synonym for amazing. Maybe 'life altering' or 'paradigm shifting.'"
The hand in his hair gentles then releases its grip. Harry's head drops forward, and the blindfold drops to the floor.
"Door's locked," Harry says as he presses a kiss to the hollow of Draco's throat. "Why should I stop?"
"Please fuck me, you utter sadist."
His voice is soft, but his fist is tight as it wraps in Harry's tresses, pulling his head back. The man's other hand traces up the line of Harry's neck, his nails scratching at Harry's pulse.
His gut twists, but he keeps his mouth shut as he follows Malfoy into a small room off to the side of the class. Black letters spell out
"For fuck's sake, Potter! I thought you cared more about your life than this! What about all of the people waiting for you out there, the people depending on you? Even if you don't give a damn about your life, you should give a damn about theirs."
The way that Potter gulps it down is criminal, though. His throat shifts and flexes as he swallows, the condensation on the glass clinging to his fingers as he cradles it in his hand. When he finishes, he always lets out a low sigh of pleasure, a soft sound that is painfully loud in their too-small, too-hot office. Every time he drinks, he sighs, and Draco, sitting behind his desk with his sleeves rolled up and his glasses sliding down his nose from perspiration, feels it like that imagined breeze across the surface of the river. A tantalizing chill that isn't there, that he desperately wants to chase.
"Of course he'll kill you." Draco's eyes are wide and wild. "He's the Dark Lord. His temper is completely unchecked. You'll… you'll look at him one day, and he'll hate the colour of your eyes, even though they're the same colour they've always been, and he'll cast the Killing Curse and be done with it. With
As soon as the words are out of Ron's mouth, they both freeze.
The maître d' bows, then leaves. Draco does his best to not gape at Potter.
Harry's thrusts go uneven, slow, until they're both still and panting against the brick wall. There's a long moment of quiet between them, and then Draco groans.
Harry rolls Draco onto his back, bracketing his head with Harry's arms. "Should we?"
"Why him?" Harry moans before throwing the parchment onto his desk and leaning back in his chair. "He's got trainees teaching these classes most of the time. Why's he leading this one?"
"Tired," is all Draco can manage, his whole body limp and exhausted with satisfaction.
," Potter says with a laugh. "I wonder what other random nouns I can trick out of that clever mouth of yours."
"I know it's been years, and things were a bit… complicated when we last spoke, but I've spent the past few years trying to come to terms with what I did when we were children. There are an awful lot of things I could say about that, though I don't believe it needs to be said. But for all of the harm I caused you, that my family caused you, I wanted to apologize. I know amends can't be made, but I wanted to at least say the words." He took another drink, then tapped his fingers on the bartop before pushing his seat back. "Thank you for the drink, Potter, and for listening."
He got used to the fantasy, of pretending that his hand was Harry's, that the groans he sometimes couldn't help but let escape weren't his.
Malfoy's eyebrow arches. "If you think that game is the only thing I'm better at than you, I do believe you need to pay closer attention."
He's grabbed two wallets and a watch so far, and he's halfway through taking a woman's mobile from where it hangs out of her too-small back pocket when he feels eyes on him. Moving his hand away carefully, he puts it by his side and takes a step away.
the next morning, it felt like finally setting his foot on the next tread.
Malfoy continues to wash his hands, grey eyes focused as his fingers tangle together, then coast over the back of his hands, then along his blunt thumbs.
Harry quickly learns that Draco is a liar.
"You think you know what I feel, Potter. You think you understand what's going on in my head, the things I don't say. You look at me like you look at any of your other patrons, and you think, 'ah, Malfoy. I understand. I know what he's about.'" He pointed his finger at Harry, his hand shaking with anger. "But you don't. You
He laughs, and this time the smoke in his lungs stings. "I am more than aware."
"The part of Voldemort's soul that was inside of me died." Reaching into his pocket, he pulls out the Snitch and presses it against his mouth. As it clicks open, he fishes the tiny stone from its protective case. "And it's rather hard to die when you've got the Resurrection Stone."
"You can't just get off with a bloke and not tell me! I thought I was your best friend!"
If he's to be honest, he doesn't want to.
"Yes. What do you want?"
"I will consider it. Now shoo, Potter. I've got work to do."
"You shouldn't be here," he says, eyes closed.
"This is a
they cast clearly not enough to stand up to whatever weather front has been unleashed on their workspace. One woman is sobbing over a pile of ruined ledgers, her snot-muffled voice moaning about ruined balance sheets and income statements. A man far ahead of her in the queue is covered in a thick layer of snow that has yet to melt, even though he's been there much longer than Draco, who's near the very back and would be annoyed if it weren't for the fact that the hallway is relatively temperate.
It's been awhile since Draco's had to use this house. He makes a cursory check of his supplies, confirms the water is still running, and then gets his first aid supplies from the bathroom cupboard.
"Pay attention."
Draco tries not to think about the place off of Diagon, or his last visit, or the way he'd love to go there right now and have someone fuck all of this flame out of his body.
He undoes the top button of his shirt.
"I don't…" Ron frowns. "If he's not being a bastard, then what's wrong?"
"Malfoy!" Potter steps through the doors, his black greatcoat billowing about his chest and legs in a truly heroic display. He smiles sheepishly at Draco, then runs a hand through his curls. It pulls his white jumper tight across the expanse of his chest, and though the fabric is thick and heavily cabled, it still somehow defines his muscles in a way that has Draco feeling completely liquid.
"Fine." Draco kisses Potter to stop him from laughing. "Consider it a date."
Grinning, Draco asks, "Whyever not?" before leaning in to kiss the surprised laugh from Harry's mouth.
Potter blinks, then sets down his quill "Yes. It really is." He casts a
And though it feels like he's flaying his skin open with slate knives dipped in salt water, Draco Apparates away with Potter encased in his arms.
His soothing words don't mean anything, not really, but as he continues to whisper them into Draco's hair, he knows it's the only comfort he can offer that Draco will accept. So he tells Draco that it's okay, that Harry forgives him, that Harry doesn't blame him. And though he shouldn't, he tells Draco he loves him, cherishes him, would do anything for him.
Giving as good as he's getting, Harry puts on his best smile as he stands. "You, too, Draco."
"Ah, so that's how it is," Crabbe sneers. "We can take longer next time, Draco. All you had to do was ask."
"Right. So you're not gazing with longing at one Harry James Potter, Senior Auror and Ministry Golden Boy?"
Draco ground down on Harry's lap, and as he lifted, he thrust against Harry's stomach. A slow, steady pressure that drove the both of them mad. Hands fumbled for hems. Fingers slipped and skidded on buttons. Their mouths only parted long enough for shirts to be discarded, for flesh to be revealed.
The leather creaks in Draco's hand. "He certainly is."
Malfoy, also dressed in exercise clothes, is leaning against the stands, arms crossed as he watches Harry draw nearer. Like a comet caught by a star, Harry slows, then stops in front of Malfoy, caught by his gravity.
"Men, primarily, but women when the urge strikes."
"Isn't it?" When Draco takes his hand back, Harry's grip slips away easily. "You said it yourself. You're surprised I went into Muggle outreach. Doesn't matter that I'm damned good at my job or that I've learned to respect and admire the Muggles for their ingenuity. It's still a shock that someone like me would bother with them at all."
Malfoy chuckles, low and dark. "Playing dirty, Potter. I think I like it."
Not yet.
"That's just semantics. Where the hell is Hermione? She's got to hear about this."
"Do you take your tea with milk?" Draco shouts, though he knows they don't have any and Potter's probably still too out of it to respond.
"So you're, what? A double-agent? A spy?"
He spent months in Budapest cracking an illegal potions ring that specialized in Amortentia. He was deep undercover for almost a year investigating a trafficking ring that specialized in half-blooded Veela and Werewolves. There were three excruciating weeks in Russia as he and another operative smoked out the beginnings of a Neo-Death Eater cult. Draco put his heart and soul — or what little remained of both — into undoing as much of the evil Voldemort had put into the world as he could.
," Draco hisses as Potter nips at his collarbone. "
His words sting. "That's not what I meant."
," he asks before walking forward, "whyever would our office be so…
"Green," he gasps, and then Harry puts the tip of his wand to the underside of Draco's prick.
Neville stretches, his shirt riding up to reveal the toned expanse of his stomach. Blaise's eyes drift down to the strip of pale skin and the line of darker hair that bisects it before he drags them, clearly unwillingly, back to Neville's face.
They'd been skirting about the issue for weeks now. Harry hadn't wanted to push, and Draco hadn't done more than hold his hand or kiss his cheek gently before saying goodnight and leaving Harry alone on his own doorstep. Ron had warned Harry that traditional Wizarding society tended to be a bit slow about these things, that there were a lot of Wix who waited until marriage to have sex, that it wouldn't be anything personal against Harry (he was always quick to assume that others didn't want him unless he had some use to them, a habit he was trying hard to break). It had eased some of his worry, but as their third date passed, then their fourth, then their fifth, Harry started to worry that there was something wrong.
He would wake up to presents and gifts by his bedside on his birthday or any special occasion, which felt like every day. Food was sometimes just delivered to the house already paid for or a high-end chef wound come and personally prepare and cook the food right in front of him. He knew it was from them, without asking. The chefs never talked to him at all, just cooked and left. One he had talked to; he grew to like his company.
To devour and eat, lick, and bite every inch of pale skin until there was nothing, but red, puffy marks left behind. Just standing still and looking was enough to make his mouth ache. Being in his water state helped a good deal to holding him back.
Draco’s gonna have sandy, and now wet clothes.
Unable to center himself, or even control his body, Draco was left with the only option to force the man to stop. He bit down as hard as he could, with all his might, on the burning hot tongue that was still in his mouth. More blood spilled in his mouth, spit mixing in as it crawled down his neck and Draco shuttered in disgust. There was something else. He squirmed, there was something in the blood, and we wanted it out of his mouth. He expected the man to jump back in pain and confusion, but the man burrowed closer to Draco, trying to dig his tongue down his throat with a loud moan.
Draco squeezed his eyes together, clenching his teeth.
He stood up, to look for a broken stick or something but saw nothing. He walked closer towards the sand near the water and kneeled to dig around in the sand. He small yelp escaped his mouth, and he snatched back his hand. A small drop of blood was sliding down his pointer finger. Narrowing his eyes, he popped his bloody finger in his mouth, and moved the sand with his other hand to see what caused his bleeding. There about 2 inches in the sand, were about 3 shark teeth of different sizes. He grinned. He could use these as weapons if he were careful. But now, he needed to rinse the blood off.
This was the worst day of his entire life.
3. A little bloodplay
HXDHXDHXDHXDHXDHXD
The words slowly echoed throughout his mind. Draco jolted, startled. The words didn’t seem to be spoken to him. The things head turned to look at something in the distance. No other movement was made from it, besides the water below them moving in sharp and rough waves.
Harry thought and calmed himself, settling his hands around his waist and willed them to move no further. His mate huffed weakly. Harry didn’t know what he could and couldn’t feel with the uncompleted bond between them, but Harry knew what he wanted to.
Both Draco and the dragon stilled, catching the tone of the strange shape of water. His anger and impatience quick to grow. Draco shrunk back.
“He’s okay,” Lily stepped up next to her, and rubbed her arms. She was done crying, her eyes a little red. “You know your brother is strong. He just needs to time to cool down.”
there while you guys handled Big Bro.” He huffed and puffed, looking like he desperately needed air.
The large water mass seemed to watch his closely, his attention mostly on Draco.
Despite being totally lost and confused, Draco can’t focus on nothing but the man in front of him with wide eyes. With his wet, but warm hands having a firm grasp on his chin, Draco’s unable to move his head away, much less talk.
His heart stopped beating. He screamed.
Holding him, touching him,
Harry jolted. His mate - whose name he still didn’t know – was too confused....as if he didn’t know anything right now. He paced a little. Was he too late if his mate was harmed and was having memory problems? But Harry was confident to know that the only wound on him was on his hand; it was bleeding little drops of blood. He could feel somethings from the incomplete bond, but not all. They need to hurry and ensure its’ completed soon, so no risky problems would occur in the future. For either one of them. Harry cut off his thoughts and narrowed his eyes in the far distance of the water. There was movement, someone was coming. And they was fast and violent.
Draco’s brain was frozen with shock.
Draco’s heart thumped so loud; it muted his hearing. He could barely breath, his mind was fuzzy. He cannot put together a single thought, much less function right now. His body was hot and overheating.
Draco groans. If it didn't feel so damned good, he'd be embarrassed at how close he is to coming.
Malfoy's up to something.
. Where people talk shite about your homemade crisps — they're rubbish, Potter, and you should really take them off the menu — and give you guff about your football team, and if anyone thinks 'Oh, isn't he that bloke that defeated the most evil wizard of our times?' they forget about it because you've got a beard now and you're carrying a dirty dishrag on your shoulder like a sash. And I just…" He grew quiet, his anxious gaze settling in the distance, running from Harry's. "I see it, and I'm jealous, and I hate that. I've spent my entire life being jealous of you, and I thought I'd moved past it."
Harry doesn't try to stop the groan this time. He doesn't feel shame. Grey eyes flash, but then Draco is out the door, and Harry is left alone, his mind confused and his body aching.
"Brilliant. You need any help with drying charms?" Weasley lifts his foot and shakes water free. "I can help."
"Only a
"Ah. Right." Potter coughs quietly. "Are you sure you don't want some help with that?"
Pale skin suddenly flushed, Draco drops Harry's gaze, his chin falling to his chest. "Well." He coughs softly. "My apologies, then. And thank you."
It's a secret that Draco already does.
It'd been six weeks since Malfoy last visited.
Harry's mouth is dry when he says, "Fine. Let's go, then."
"You've really got to stop believing your own assumptions, Potter." He steps close enough to whisper in Potter's ear. "Now, I don't want any trouble from you. You're going to let me leave, you're not going to tell anyone you saw me here, and you're going to let Robards know that he should keep his hounds off of me if he doesn't want this all to go to shit. You understand?"
"Am I…?"
"Okay, that's enough of that. C'mere." Harry grabs Malfoy's robes in his fist, then pulls him away from the main hallway and into a corridor to the grounds. Slamming Malfoy against the wall, Harry's arm braced across his chest, he asks, "What're you trying to prove, Malfoy?"
"You're in luck, then." Draco readies another cup, then stands in silence as the kettle warms on the hob. It rattles when the water starts boiling.
His office is blessedly empty when he enters. Throwing his coat onto the rack near the door, he straightens his Auror robes and settles behind his desk. There's a mountain of paperwork to dig through, unfortunately. He and his partner closed out a big case the week before, a potions ring in Belfast that had the local team scratching their heads for months before they finally called Draco's team in to work it. They had, of course, figured it out within a couple of days of their arrival, apprehended the suspects, and found enough evidence of wrongdoing to bury them with it.
"Tell me what you like," Harry said as he stroked Draco from root to tip, again and again. "Tell me if this is too much."
"You speak French."
Draco's thrusts against Harry's stomach grew more frantic, less measured. His hands shaking, Harry took one from Draco's waist to the fly of Draco's trousers, then stilled.
"You really want this," Draco says, wondering.
Customs.
Harry couldn't stop his hands from roaming, from finding every inch of perfect muscle and skin and feeling it, finally, without the barrier of clothes between. It was overwhelming. It was glorious. And through it all, the careful motion of Draco's prick against his own, the press and pull, the drive towards completion as frantic as their racing hearts pressed as close to each other as they could get with the obstacle of flesh and bone still in the way.
So, what do you say, Potter?
Draco removes his vest at some point, tossed haphazardly away while they desperately try to keep their hands on each other. It's a fumbling, sweaty mess, but neither of them care, focused solely on the challenge of being as close to the other as possible. Harry's cock is firm and hard against the dip of Draco's hips, and when he shifts to the right, his prick rubs up against that firm ridge. They both groan at the caress. Draco thrusts are slow and steady, and even though his prick chafes against his sweat-soaked pants and trousers, he can't stop himself from chasing the pleasure of Harry's body against his own. It's too much. He burns with it. If he could, he'd immolate from this alone. But when Potter's fingers touch the buckle of Draco's belt and his lips part to murmur, "May I?" as if politeness is what's needed in this moment rather than expediency, Draco curses and fumbles for it himself.
Green fire lances through him, Potter's eyes like a dagger piercing his skin. Draco undoes another button and another until his shirt hangs open around his chest, his own sweat-stained vest visible. He carefully pulls the shirt free of his trousers, then stands so he can more easily slide it from his shoulders.
Harry meets Draco's laughing eyes in the bathroom mirror and smiles.
When he places his hand on Potter's forearm, it's like he's been burned. He can see waves of heat rising from the floor, ghosting touches against Draco's bared skin. He follows their upward path along Potter's arm, his palm dragging against Potter's tensed muscles. When he reaches the curve of Potter's elbow, he stops, wraps his fingers around the joint, and pulls Potter a step forward. He stumbles the way a man lost in the desert falls towards an oasis, and Draco catches him as easily as still waters.
For a brief moment, I went straight. Well, not
His hand on Draco's face is rough and confident. He tilts Draco's head up, forcing him to meet Potter's bright green eyes. "A trade."
"Potter."
"What are you on about?"
"Well, it certainly sounds like you are."
It feels nice, which is why it takes Draco a long time to ask, "What are we doing?"
. It does make me look the part, though, doesn't it? And it makes people fear me, more than they did before. There's something powerful about a beautiful thing ruined, isn't there?
"I've been thinking," Harry says as he coasts his lips down the column of Draco's throat, "about how much I wanted to put that pretty cock of yours in my mouth."
Whether that's for pain or for pleasure is entirely up to him.
"No milk, bit of sugar."
"So," Potter asks after six and a half days, "what, exactly, are you?"
Malfoy was at the door, his face twisted in a scowl. Banging on the glass again, his words were muffled as he yelled, "Open the bloody door, Potter!"
"We're getting a bit old for this," Harry says as he falls back. "Did you really steal a bunch of wallets?"
Malfoy laughs, low and easy, and Harry shivers.
Ron points at Harry with his fork, then down the table at Malfoy, then back to Harry. "The two of you. You're a… thing? Now?"
"Good evening, sir," he says, his gloved hands held together in front of him. "May I have your name, please?"
"It's perfect," Draco gasped. "You're perfect. Gods, Harry. This is going to be over embarrassingly fast."
Harry finished with the glasses — there weren't many left — before turning around. His patron hadn't grabbed a seat as requested, but rather stood in the middle of the nearly empty barroom, hands in his pockets, his grey eyes somber and still on Harry.
He throws it in the bucket.
"I'll be back with a flannel," he says, brushing Draco's hair to the side. "I'll be right here."
He glares at her for a moment, then his eyes drift back to where they were. "Shut up, darling. You've no idea what you're talking about."
He didn't want someone to hand him something, though, and honestly, Harry didn't really
"It's because you poisoned Jefferies," Ron says without looking up. "I'm just surprised it's not worse."
"Pleasure is all mine," Draco says before taking another drag. "You out slumming it tonight, or were you looking for me specifically?"
"No idea." Paper rustles. Ron's quill taps against the inkpot. "Better buckle up, though. He's going to be a right bastard about it, I'm sure."
They stayed that way for a long time, Harry petting Draco's hair, Draco breathing against Harry's pulse point.
"It didn't mean anything."
He's laughing when he stands, and though his knees crack — loudly — he can't feel anything but easy pleasure and happiness as he watches Draco put himself back together. Harry grabs a paper towel and quickly cleans up the mess they'd left on the floor and his face, then washes his hands again as Draco crowds in close behind him, pushing Harry's hips against the counter. Even though he's just come, Harry's prick gives an interested twitch.
"No." Draco swallows. "No, I don't mind at all."
"Fuck, Potter." He cants his hips back again, chasing pleasure. "Just fuck me already."
"But you need it." Draco touches Harry's shoulder lightly, and even that small hint of a touch has goose pimples erupting on Harry's skin. "Let me help you, Potter. If we work together, we could—"
Which is how he comes while looking straight into Malfoy's eyes, nearly spilling Malfoy's name from his lips as come spills from his prick.
of the place, the
Malfoy looks over his shoulder at Harry, then sighs. "It is and it isn't."
"Like to watch, Potter?"
"God, every time you opened that bloody mouth of yours, I wanted to shut you up with my cock in your mouth. Wanted to fuck the spoiled brat right out of you. And now," — another meaningful twist of his fingers, wrenching a cry from Draco's throat — "I'm going to fuck you raw."
Next chapter, onwards to the First Task.
“They just don’t do it here because it’s forbidden, but I doubt they have the same drawbacks at home.” Ron crossed his arms, jutting his chin forward mulishly. “They’re good enough at throwing hexes, they don’t even need dark magic anyways.”
Her voice was rich and deep and she talked with a strong French accent, and quite a few students snickered at the way she pronounced the Headmaster’s name. Even Harry barely contained his smile.
With a few swirls of her wand, she had the fraying ends of the robes all nice and neat, and the colour set to a nice sapphire blue. It was a bit loud for Draco’s taste, but actually worked quite well with Weasley’s skin tone and red hair. Fortunately, the cut of the robes was very traditional in style, which helped mask the little imperfections owing to their obvious age and wear.
Draco had resisted telling Antoniy about the Triwizard Tournament, and the fact that he would attend, for the whole length of their first afternoon at Durmstrang. He had only hinted that he knew something big while they unpacked their trunks, and that he would be part of it, and overall riled up his roommate nice and good about the whole issue, just for the pleasure of seeing his friend’s indignant face when Karkaroff announced it.
He thrust the small package at Draco’s chest without looking, and only heard the small ‘oomph’ of released air upon impact as he hit too hard, and then the rumble of Draco’s laughter.
“Then it’s even worse,” Draco hissed, shaking out of the grip.
“I was ze one who asked ‘im to take me,” Gabrielle Delacour interjected with authority. “I wanted to go, but Fleur wouldn’t take me because she wanted to go wiz a boy,” her voice turned very disdainful as that particular moment. “And I knew Ronald ‘ad no one since Fleur ‘ad rejected ‘im, so I begged ‘im to take me and ‘e said yes.”
So it rankled that there would be lies between them, and lies there obviously were. Either Narcissa hadn’t know the truth about Dobby, and Lucius had lied to her, or she had, and that was even worse because then that meant she had lied to
“What do you think she said? She said no.”
No one asked him how he knew that: Viktor always knew the most obscure details about Quidditch, which apparently included non-professional players at a foreign school.
“It’s all true,” Pansy insisted when Draco raised his eyebrow at her. “I heard him speak to that serpent Snape made me conjure during Dueling Club, we all did.”
Harry tried and failed to imagine Vernon dancing a waltz or a tango.
Harry stared at him, and Cedric patted him on the shoulder.
“Blimey. Er, thank you, I guess? I mean, you were pretty insulting about it,” here he glared at Draco, which, hey, unfair, Svetlana had also been quite vocal about her disgust. “But this is much better than before.”
“That’s a bit of a stretch, isn’t it?” Ron said with a shrug. “We don’t even know it it was her.”
He had just reached the conclusion that he should be done with it and open it, when the Hall erupted into a great brouhaha that penetrated even his suspicion-fuelled trepidation, and he raised his head to take a bewildered look around him. What he saw didn’t really help: students of all Houses were nudging each other and showing themselves a journal, apparently discussing something written large and bold on the front page.
Chuckling, Harry lifts the sheet up. "You're going to hate this, then," he says before putting the flannel against Draco's semen-smeared belly. Cursing, Draco arches away before biting Harry's neck.
He gives up on being quiet after that, especially with how long it takes Harry to stop laughing into Draco's hip.
There's another shout, and when Potter turns this time, Draco's got his wand out and pressed into the small of Potter's back before he can turn back around.
Harry licks his lips and smiles as Malfoy groans. "Doesn't taste that bad," he says before putting his sticky fingers in his mouth and licking them clean. "I could get used to it."
"You saw our target when we walked in, yeah?" Potter says, still not looking up from his menu. "Sitting near the door, back to us currently if you want to look."
"I'll kill him," Malfoy says under his breath. "Go out drinking with the idiot
Draco's hips rise at the thought, but he fights it back, muscles quaking. "I'm sorry. I won't do it again."
Draco's cock hardens as Potter pulls his hand away. He spits, and the sound shouldn't be erotic, but it is. When Potter's fingers return, they're wet and insistent.
Harry's still trying to come back to reality, his mind wiped away by orgasm, when Draco falls onto his knees next to him and captures his panting mouth in a kiss. Harry loses himself to it, to the gentle push and pull of Draco's mouth against his own, the ache of his swollen lips eased by the slow and delicate brush of Draco's lips. It's as easy as the blow job had been hard, but they both settle something in Harry's chest.
I see you've caught onto my point.
No, they've no idea what lurks beneath the shifting deck under our feet.
But it was those trips that made me think to buy my own ship. Nothing fancy, nothing pretentious. It was plain enough for Mother to not suspect, and I had a very thorough business plan. Simple runs across the Channel. Wizarding goods from the Continent, brought weekly to England until the demand outstripped our pace and I had to buy another, larger ship and switch to daily travails.
"I mean, I'd just ask him out at this point, but—"
"No!" Draco grabs Harry's hands, then stares at his wrists before throwing them away. "No, we'll find another way. I didn't go to all of this trouble just to kill you in the end. You're going to make it through this bloody war, or so help me…"
Draco twists his wrist, pulling another groan from Harry's chest as he starts to jerk Harry slowly. "Wouldn't dream of it."
"Malfoy."
"Ah, sorry for interrupting. Is it anything interesting?"
"Best two out of three," Malfoy says as the pressure of Harry's arm across his chest lessens. "And I won't count the first time against you. Clean slate, as it were."
Harry steps out of his trousers and throws them in the direction of his bed. "You'd think with the goal of this game, you wouldn't want to do what you prefer."
"It's beautiful."
Harry chuckles. "Maybe I just like you."
Draco sniffs. "It's not my fault you're not up-to-date with Muggle mythology."
"Stop!" The voice echoes against the brick walls, followed by pounding footsteps as Draco's pursuer sprints after him. "I said stop!"
They lay in the dark together, Draco's face buried in Harry's neck, nose pressed into the space between collar and skin. His body shakes, and though he's silent when he does it, Harry knows Draco is crying. Harry's shoulder is wet with tears, and he pulls Draco as close as he can.
"It is."
"You're fit," Potter blurts out, his cheeks crimson. "I mean, you know you're fit, and you know I
you. Gods, I've never wanted something so bad in my life, Potter, and what if—"
He does take the time to bring his summer uniforms out of storage. The linen shirts and trousers, their threads enchanted with Cooling Charms and antiperspirant spells, should make things a bit more bearable than his heavy woolen winter garb.
Harry swung his bar rag over his shoulder. "Malfoy. What can I get for you?"
asking you out. For coffee." Figuring he's already dead at this point, he continues. "Or maybe dinner?"
Did you know that Muggles know more about the vast expanse of space than they do about what's lurking in the sea? They can tell you the exact chemical composition of the farthest stars, but they can't tell you what thrives at the bottom of the Marianas Trench or how eels find each other in the vast expanse of the sea to mate and reproduce, though they're more than happy to dine on the bountiful results.
"Undercover operative." Draco sighs. "I can't tell you much about the specifics. You don't have the security clearances for it, and all jokes aside, if I give anything away, they'll have my hide and yours, and I rather like where ours skins are currently. You happened to stumble into one of my operations, rather unfortunately, and now," he gestures around the safe house, "we're here."
He pulled out his phone from his back pocket, and clicked to the weather report. There in big white letters, the outside temperature was said to be a chilly 67 degrees. But then why was he burning up?
His room was filled with water, for him; the water from his room was connected to the large ocean from a window. Gathering pressure, he pressed the button to release the window, to more and open water. As soon as the window was up, he tasted a sweet metallic in the water, coming from the same direction of the pull.
year old birthday and came and gone without him seeing his parents at all that day. He opened his eyes to the latest iPhone that came out just a few days ago, his already recently brought TV already replaced with a big, wider, and enhanced version, and his old-time favorite: blueberry pancakes. He did not once get an ‘happy birthday’ said to him by his parents that he didn’t see at all.
At every passing second, his body temperature was rising and rising, getting hotter and hotter. Draco started to huff and puff, and knew that his face and ears were a burning red. He leaned over, desperately trying to get oxygen in his system, but it wasn’t working.
$200 were left on the dining room table every week, without fail. Although he didn’t want to touch it, it helped pay for field trips, and whenever he wanted or needed on the spot. Things he needed (phone bill, clothing, toothpaste, and mouthwash) were always paid ahead of time, and things he’d want (new video games, shoes, candy) were already in the house in their respectable spot.
Lily blinked, slowly turning from the cooking station, bemusement in her face and put down the sharp ware. She brought her hands up a placing manner, not making fast movements and came a little forward to coming into the sitting/eating room where James was. She tilted her head and glanced at James, as he put his paper book down but stayed seated in his sitting.
“Someone’s here!” Harry suddenly said loudly, jumping out the body of water, his body reforming in the air for his feet to touch the ground. “I’m feeling a pull from somebody in that direction.” He waved his arm to the far right as he rapidly walked, His skin still moist from his nap. His face and skin were also a pale blue as it always was when he formed his body back to quickly. His eyes were a swirling mess of cerulean and lush green, letting Lily know that he still wasn’t settled right yet.
She took a deep breath, “
“Harry is a strong person, gifted and blessed with his magic, we know that.” Nothing James thought could argue against that, after all, he was there when Harry was born.
When touching a large mass of water, as Harry was connecting to it, he could dissolve his form, and still be there, anywhere in this water. But sometimes, it also made things extremely easy to do multiple things at once. With the thought of wanting to touch his mate even now, he couldn’t stop himself.
“How do you know my name?!” Draco asked, and glanced around. He needed to stall the man for time while he looked for some way to escape. He looked around without trying to be obvious, but he was in a closed off room that only have a few windows that looked to be blocked by water. An underwater room. His heart sunk, so much for trying to run, and it wasn’t possible to swim, as the man could turn into some water horse creature.
Draco crouched by a tree, wrapping his arms around himself. Despite being in the full heat of the sun, he felt so cold and lonely. The thought that someone had successfully kidnapped him, scared him. Now, he was stuck on some island, by himself and not knowing how he is gonna get home. He was alone. But he was used to being alone. All the time, ever since he was little.
His mate.
the water horses’ words popped in his mind, sounding of regret, and sorrow and longing. The horse shuffled a little, wanting to move.
Harry brought his mate in his room through the window, being extra careful to not hit his head. Most of the lower parts of his room was underwater, as he needed it or for whenever he felt like it, he’d go to the water. With roots crawling into the room from the outside, and bottles and things Harry found interesting was kept there. With it underwater, and the sun still up, it made the room light with blue.
A pained whine came from the dragon. Draco could see that the water ties were tightening on the large dragon, smoke coming from its skin. His eyes were clenched tight, and its mouth biting down together. It was in pain and...
The water creatures’ body moved, starling Draco. “What are you doing?” He yelled in a hysterical voice, fear clouding his mind. ‘
James stood with Lily, and watched over the icy waters, distantly wondering how Harry was feeling. When he reached his Mature Stage, it had come and passed, lasting a full day. He remembers his body aching up and down so much that he could not move. He slept most of the day, and when he did wake up, he just stared at the room ceiling before closing his eyes again. But he never did feel a pull like...
Draco cracked open his eyes, with pressure. They felt so heavy like what he was lying on.
Lily nodded. “I was just shocked, I knew something was gonna happen, but I didn’t expect him to just try and leave right in front of us.” Harry never outright disrespected Lily. James made a noise in agreement.
Just getting into warnings so I don't know if these are correct... for just this chapter
His lips were so soft and warm, colliding with Draco’s, and even though he was protesting to it, Draco could feel everything he was doing, and it heated up his body even more. His teeth were lightly nibbling and when his sharp tongue swept across his lips, asking for entrance, Draco unconsciously opened.
Draco made a noise a shock. “What do you mean ‘pulling?’”
“You aren’t listening to me, mom!” He yelled, furthering baking up the idea that Harry is
He had long black hair, and an ‘S’ on the front of his robes.
I'm not sure but here they are...
he thought as a glimpse of pale blue came out of nowhere and Draco fell into darkness.
James tilted his head, “but the ‘pull’, do you think that...” he was unsure of how to continue. “he’s talking about
Wincing, he got a shark tooth, and ran it down his ankle. In a panic, he blindly swept his hand down, and saw red. A section of the tongue was cut off; His leg was free.
Harry couldn’t
Sorry about the summary, didn't know what to put without giving anything away. Just people clicking on my story makes me so happy. Please comment what you think... Hope you enjoy.
“Rare, extremely rare. He can’t be talking about that.” She protested, but in a weak voice.
He followed its gaze to notice that a large, dark green dragon was thrashing as it was tangled in ropes made of water, roaring in anger. Draco stared at the teeth in fear, they were the ones he saw when he was dragged below.
James rolled his eyes. Alex always was such a queen.
The water horse whinnied.
keep his eyes off what was in front of him. Who was in front of him?
With that done, he flicked the extra water off and walked through the sand to reach the tree line. I wasn’t exactly clean, but it did its job for now. He wrapped his hand in his shirt to slow down the bleeding. At least he was experienced with small things like this.
He later figured out the shape that he felt in the water that day.
Turning his head, Draco saw the water ropes release the shaking dragon free. Blood was running down it's scales in small river while the were large bruises everywhere els. Draco knew it was in a lot of pain. With his newly returned freedom, the dragon moved to dive in the water, trying to get far and far from the powerful water creature. But.
He could answer his questions. Get him home. If it didn’t eat him.
The feel of the pull that was there every second since he woke that day was
He leaped onto the bed, transformed, “I said nothing was to happen to you,”
That means...
The meeting continues but just in a different place, and leaves them in a certain type of situation.
His form lost shape, turning into a thick and clear-like water mold, and smoothly leaped back into the open pool of water, getting lost in its large mass.
His head was clouding up.
him made his vision tunnel, blocking out everything but him. He was aware of every move he made; his small and moist pink lips stretched as he ranted and heaved, the way his glistening eyes were constantly trying to peer into his and see whatever he could, the way his beautiful ash blond hair swung with the wind, the way his hands showed his confusion and frustration at this moment, this situation.
The dragon did a small nod and disappeared under the surface water.
HXDHXDHXDHXDHXD
there. But not nearly as strong as it was before, want him to scratch his head bloody. It felt quiet, subdued in a way, asleep but ready to wake, for he was where he was supposed to be. With whom he was supposed to be with. He would have been here earlier, if it wasn’t for his smart but stubborn lady of a mother and avoided unnecessary harm to his mate.
Alexander made a face at the ground. “Big Bro wound never-“
Walking in the rain didn’t used to bother him. Besides his clothes and only his clothes and shoes getting wet thanks to his tough and smooth bookbag that was made for whatever material that had the rainwater run off the sides instead of
Waking up late, packing some of his toiletries and extra clothes, and reheating last night’s dinner had him stuffing his face as he raced for the door. While it really would not be a problem if he missed the school bus and didn’t go to school today, he had something important to do that is a little heavy on his chest.
“I’m sorry if I scared you, that wasn’t my intention  at all. Draco.”
He nodded. It was the only explanation of him not being in the city, a thousand miles away from home. As he didn’t see his book bag and phone, the ones who took him had to have dropped it. So, no way to call someone, even if he would have got a signal. He sighed, his parents might not notice him missing ‘til later, but he told Pansy that he was coming today, and he would never go back on his word. She knows that if he did, it would not be from choice.
Draco shook his head. He needed to focus on the present. If he was dropped off on this island, then he could safely assume that whoever brought him here, would come back to get him. He needed to try and get off the island before they come back. Or at least find some way to depend himself.
He’s eyes snapped open as the heat he felt on his face also went to his hand. The man softly unclenched his hand from the sheets that were a faint red. He blinked; my hand was still bleeding. Draco snapped up his head as he saw movement, the man was opening his smooth pink lips to reveal white pearly teeth, and a luscious tongue.
He shivered.
The sun was a witness to something important, private,and scared that had a connection, to something that was chased, and wet. The sun as its witness.
Harry was not always sure when he is awake or not. A dormant state, his father once said, easily to wake up at times, and not. He can’t just open his eyes...
The water creature chucked at this, finding it funny.
He glances at Lily, “What do you think Harry was talking about.... when he said a ‘pull’?”
Harry knew.
.” Her strong voice, filled with will, conviction and power ranged out. Her magic quick to respond. A smoke-like fog lifted from her lips and entered Harry’s ears. His body instantly froze, his magic though powerful, was unable to block the sudden and unexpected intrusion of hers’ in his body. Although Harry’s magic would usually never fight Lily’s’ as it knows where it came from, it's source.
James narrowed his hazel eyes. This isn’t normal Mature Stage behavior. Harry shouldn’t even be moving right now, much less talking so coherently.
He remembered waking up every morning, running down the long and dark hallways to his parents’ room, only to find it clean and empty. The bed was wrinkle free, a sign that it hasn’t been slept in at all. There were clothes in the closets, but they were the same clothing he saw every morning when he’d check. The tub and walk-in showers were still dry, not been used in however time. His heart faltered, before he roughly slammed the door and ran back to his room.
“Damn.”
Stars erupted around his vision as he was deprived of his air. With a fleeting groan, he was rushed away into darkness.
Anna immediately straightened and sped-walked to the icy water where Harry disappeared into, while Alexander fell to the ground. “Thanks, dad. It was nice
Sorry for the wait. I wasn't sure if I wanted to post a type of messing and wild kiss that leaves someone knocked out. (Sigh)
Then there was a splash, and all he could see was huge and dirty teeth before he was dragged under the water.
Draco’s eyebrows furrowed. “I’m safe now. Besides, I don’t like causing unnecessary pain to others.”
Their reunion only led to more future questions for Draco, While Harry just watched, satisfied with who he finally got in his grasp...
His skin was a warm caramel color that had faint and sharp pale blue cracks wrapped around his arms and all over his skin, all the way to his muscled thighs. There was some kind of cloth wrapped around his lower waist. He had muscles and was buff but not much, but Draco knew if he wanted, he could hold him down with breaking a sweat. He was halfway crouched over Draco, as if he didn’t want to trap him in place, but also didn’t want to be too far.
The creature didn’t bother answering, his head still turned to Draco. Draco can’t see if it has eyes, but it has a long snout, kind of like a horse.
That’s probably because he can’t feel anything. Well that’s not true, he feels something, but not what he’d expected at the time.
The water creature just looked at him for a few seconds. The dragon was roaring now, loudly, and it made Draco twitchy. “Please.” He begged.
After a moment, he didn’t feel the pain of sharp teeth biting into his body. He opened his eyes, expecting to see red dripping into the blue of the water.
The dragon bowed his head and hissed low.
Most things that were necessary, they made sure to do, though they were not home. The house was constantly cleaned, at least 3 times a week, even if it was only him staying there. He wasn’t a messy child. The kitchen was filled with food, for him and/or chefs to fix, but he did not eat a lot. Most of the food would go old and get replaced the next day. Dishes cleaned, and floors mopped almost every night.
“Well, there’s always an exception to every rule,” he said slowly. Harry could see the idea was disturbing him, and Hermione had already given him enough of a chewing. Ron would mull over it and come to his own conclusion if given some time.
Harry threw her an horrified glare, which she just shrugged off.
“I have to go,” Harry said quickly. “But, er… See you tomorrow before you leave?” he asked hopefully.
Rasputin had less qualms: she yanked the door open, pushed Harry in, and slammed the door shut on his back.
"I wonder how he got it, though, or even got the idea," she mused, still turning the pages as if she didn't already know the whole section by heart now. "It's quite a rare plant, after all. I think it's only studied in Herbology, and maybe Potions, at NEWT levels."
Surprise registered on Draco’s face.
“I told her to mind her own bloody business,” the Durmstrang boy mumbled.
Ron gave her an unimpressed glance, but she tossed her hair back and ignored him.
He had tried, and Viktor had neatly sidestepped the issue declaring it was none of his business and Draco could clear his own messes without endangering his friend’s budding relationships. Not in so many words, of course, but the feeling had been there. And voicing so much disapproval in the first place was Viktor’s way of saying he was not very happy with Draco. Accordingly, his friend had barely said three words to him since then, which, even for Viktor, represented a remarkably low count.
“They are,” Narcissa agreed, because she had grown with the stories as well, though no Black had been marked in generations. “But it changes everything.”
“Not from Hogwarts,” he mumbled.
And, on a personal note, I'll be starting a new job in Japan in May!
It stood to reason, Draco thought, that after spending so much time and effort avoiding Harry, who had then seemed to appear at every corner, the kid was now nowhere to be found. And Draco had been looking with some enthusiasm, starting first with their usual haunts: the library, the corridor where they had often “accidentally” happened upon each other, the lake. In the first he often crossed paths with Granger – Grimhildr, could that girl glare – and he once saw the Weasley boy skipping rocks for the Great Squid to catch, but of Harry Potter, no trace. How someone so well-known, and with such a distinctive appearance, could simply fall of the map, Draco had no clue, and he was starting to feel just the slightest bit of frustration at his repeated failure to locate the Boy-Who-Lived. It had already been one week since their ill-fated discussion at the Potions lab, and the longer they went without talking, the harder Draco felt it would be to properly explain what he had meant, and what he hadn’t been meaning to say. Resuming the relationship, short-lived as it had been, was nowhere in his intentions, but he, at least, owed Harry a better explanation than what he had provided so far.
Karkaroff did not put much faith into school breaks, and despised Chritsmas with an intensity only surpassed by his hatred of muggles. Thus, in Durmstrang, the only times classes were interrupted were during the month of February, for their Practicals, group projects that each year proved to be even more intense and insanely difficult than the previous one, and in the summer, when students were allowed to return home for six weeks. Even then, they were assigned a list of spells to practice and master before school resumed, and Trace or no Trace, you had better have become proficient at them, because the professors sure assumed you were.
“I’m not participating in it,” he said, his voice much lower. “I’m just accompanying the delegation.”
“None of your business,” she retorted, raising from her sofa. “But he asked me the very day they made the announcement about the ball. You know, when all the
- what's the worst nightmare of a Death Eater? Why, your one and only son in a soulbond with your master's enemy and prophesied killer!
Harry was a Gryffindor through and through, though, and a few meters from where the horseless carriages awaited to take the students to the station, he tugged them to a stop.
He could hear Draco’s soft laugh besides him, and then felt his hands, smooth and long-fingered, clasping around his own wrists to gently draw them away from his face. Harry’s breath hitched, confronted with a grinning face and eyes full of mirth, right above his.
“Oh?” Malfoy said with a raised eyebrow and a shit-eating grin, looking very pleased with himself. “Famous, am I?”
When Viktor entered the arena opposite a Chinese Fireball, all of the Durmstrang students collectively leant forward, their breaths hitched in anticipation. In the true style of their school, Viktor attacked the problem rather aggressively, and his conjunctivis curse hit the dragon with masterful precision. They all winced, however, when the Fireball roared and stepped back, smashing half of her nest under her weight. The loss of what must have been at least three eggs would have gotten them a Distressing To Watch grade at the very least, had they been evaluated on such a task back at school. Of course, Karkaroff’s partiality could always be counted on, and Viktor ended up with the highest rating yet, since he had not been hurt himself, and had retrieved the egg in less time than the previous two participants. Draco spotted his dejected expression as he left the arena, though: no matter his first place, he was disappointed in his performance.
But Draco loved his parents dearly, and had no wish to fight them for the sake of people he did not even know. So he remained silent, and always managed to switch the conversation to another track when the subject came up. Of course his mother noticed it almost immediately: she had been the one to train him in the art of manipulating the conversation to his advantage. She was too well bred, however, to comment on it, and may have sensed his opinion did not align with hers anymore on the matter. Lucius thought nothing of it, probably because he was too used to being the centre of attention to bother attending to the whims of its periphery.
“You might find the perspective of Karkaroff’s absence for a year more than enough compensation, but I’ll keep you updated on all the developments during the Tournament, Kaija, I promise. You will feel as if I’ve never left your side,” Draco said. “And you’ll be the first to know about who gets picked as our Champion between Svetlana and Viktor. That will only cost you a tenth of the betting pool.”
It was, indeed, quite big, and filled with Beauxbatons students in silky blue robes. With the Hogwarts students that were following on their heels, the entrance hall, large as it was, was starting to be filled to the brim with excited teenagers.

Harry couldn’t help but grimace at that.
By the beginning of October, he had started subjecting the students to – thankfully – the only one Unforgivable they could somewhat survive without too much damage, because apparently it wasn’t so unforgivable as long as it was used as an educative tool. Hermione had quite a few choice words to say about this, and threatened to take it to McGonagall, or even Dumbledore himself, but Harry and Ron managed to dissuade her. For all that his lessons seemed to traumatize some students, the rest of the school seemed to idolize Moody, with the obvious exception of the Slytherins. He returned the sentiment: there was something about the way he treated the Slytherin students, from the smallest to the biggest snake, which showed he expected them to attack someone at any moment, and he would be ready for them. He treated them, overall, the same way he treated the dark creatures he introduced to the third years.
Without pausing, he started swimming back to the top, desperately aching for air to get to his lungs. He wasn’t really a good swimmer, but at the moment it doesn’t matter. His life was at stake. He could tell from the rush in the water, the monster was right behind him.
Can problems be solve by ignoring the problem, going around the problem, become apart of the problem, help the problem, or ask the problem questions about the problem??
“Can you stop please?”
The creature turned his head to Draco, his focus on him now.
But it made him want to move closer.
“Harry,” she said in a calm and patient voice, ignoring what he said and keeping his attention on her. His eyes went straight to her, glowing. “We’ve been through this before. There is no one there. What you are feeling is your perimeter getting bigger. Things like that are completely normal after you have passed the Mature stage.” Lily started confidently.
“Wait. What...?”
Walking ahead, he noticed that there were no visible footprints that he could see in the sand around him but his own. There was a deep circle-like imprint around where he had laid, but not obvious as to who put him there. He frowned, puzzled. There wasn’t a note or anything on the small island, it didn’t even look as if anyone lived there.
James made a noise. I t was too soon to say anything. With the Mature Stage and with the way Harry was acting, They needed more information to guess anything. But he already knows, and he’s sure that Lily knows too.
Draco's morning had started off horrible, and he knew it was going to get worst throughout the day. He woke up late cause his alarm clock decided to not go off on time; (He forgot to replace the batteries, but he is not going to admit that). He got up and ran towards the shower, turning the knob and hoping to hurry in time for the bus. After he waited for the water to heat up, he reached his hand under and flinched as cold water sprayed out on his hand. He quickly pulled his hand back, shaking his head from side to side; he felt lightheaded.
He walked in the water, ready to get his already hurt mate to safety. Looking back, he saw him hesitating.
HXDHXDHXDHXDHXDHXD
“Mate!?”
His book bag and phone fell to the ground as his body started to fall over.
Harry slowly drifted next to the bed. His mate made a noise, confused, and looked around. “What are you doing? Where am I?”
This suck. It really does but at the same time, it’s strange.
to come down, no matter what you would hear. You could’ve been hurt.”
Draco peered up to the water creature, curiously. It was tensed, from how it's neck stood with strong muscles. It was causing the dragon pain and he didn't seem to stop anytime soon.
Draco thought while in a daze, frantically looking up at the sky to see if the sun was out and he just didn't see it. But no, only the blackness of the sky stared back. There was no one on the street that he could ask if they were feeling what he was feeling. Just him alone in the rain, starting to burn up like he was on fire on the inside. '
A small sound of distress came from Draco.
Harry was a clam and obedient child. He never talked back to his parents, always helped his younger siblings, Anna, and Alexander with whatever they needed that wasn’t beyond reason, but he also liked to play around from time to time. He was a loving and caring son, and big brother, but the Maturing Stage is stressful for the young ones going through it, and the ones around them But it was never heard of to be this way.
This strange man was kissing him and, his eyes widened, he was trying to use tongue.
His arm broke through the water’s surface before he felt weight lift the rest of his body out the water. Closing his eyes, and curling his arms around his face, he screamed.
With his mate here, it would be better to get him somewhere safe before having an all-out battle, even if Harry was sure he’ll win. His mate comes first, with everything.
tried to eat me, and now I’m seeing talking shapes made of water...” His voice was high, but not squeaky. Harry already missed having his weight on his back.
Harry bit back a groan, not wanting to scare him anymore than he already did.
Draco’s mouth fell open.
James sighed, rubbing his forehead. This whole situation was a mess. He turned back to the frozen kids and canceled his magic over them.
Anna, however, was worried about Harry. “Will he be okay down there by himself?” She asked. She was probably going to melt the ice herself to go and see. “He was acting so...different.”
Draco didn’t care about his wet and soggy clothing as he walking to his bus stop that was a few blocks from his house. He didn’t care about the fact that if he kept walking this same speed, he could miss his bus, despite that today was essential to his future, and therefore his life. He just didn’t care, not like how he did a few minutes ago. He didn’t care about anything at that moment.
He pinched himself to make sure he wasn’t dreaming. His breath speeds up. Him being on an island surrounded by clear water, with the sun high in the sky doesn’t make sense when he was just walking to the bus stop early in the morning.  He looked down to see, and yeah, he did still have on the same black tee and gym shorts that he wants to sleep in.
“W-what are you talking a-about?” He muttered low, breathe fanning out.
Harry slowly galloped through the front room, closest to the opening water, and went towards the back. He knew his mate was looking around curiously. Harry loved water, it made up of half of his body and magic, but he wanted some human things; he did have a separate area if he wanted to walk or sleep in his human form. One of his beds were siting on a small island of wood while surrounded by water on the open floor. The bed was large and a pearl white, with cushions. Harry often liked to dive in the water after sleeping in his human form.
“Forgive me, my son.” She bowed her head, tears running down her cheeks.
Lily gave a faint shrug, as if unsure of how to answer the question. “When I would walk closer to the waters to somewhat check on him, I’d hear what sounds like mumbles. His repeating of the words, ‘someone’s coming’ or ‘I have to go’. I thought it was fever talk, even though Harry never got fevers since his birth. He shouldn’t be anywhere else in his condition, especially at this time besides his water in
It was large, clear, and blue, and about the size of a house. From where he was sitting on it's back, he couldn’t see the face of the water creature, but from the way it chuffed and snorted its nose, it was annoyed.
be bothered by this mysterious being’s presence. His scent of something unknown arose from him with a hint of musk and body heat messed with his mind.
Standing in the rain, much less walking, he should be feeling to ice biting water hitting his skin, running down his neck, and leaving him shaking but he isn’t. \
Unable to move, he watched as the mysterious man gently lifted his hand, and looking as if he has got expensive wine, licked, and sucked on the dripping cut on Draco’s hand. His mouth dropped open, and something stirred low in his gut. The man groaned low in the throat as he continued to suck on his finger, a faint pink blush across his face, and his eyes closed. Draco frowned his eyebrows in confusion and weary. He whispered, “W-what are you doing? Stop.”
He opened the large wooded front door to the sound of heavy rain beating down on the street and felt his heart drop. Looking out into the flooded streets and dark grey skies, he wondered how he couldn’t notice the weather when he first awoke and quickly dismissed that thought as he remembered that the  already soundproof walls of his large house were as thick as giant pine trees and the fact that he didn’t open his dark curtain to peek outside in his panic. He let out a groan, reaching his hand up to rub his forehead.
He turned back to his mate, who was watching with wide eyes.
The water creature made a noise, clearing his throat. The dragon froze, still shaking
However, Harry’s Mature Stage is strange.
To his surprise the creature just shrunk his sized, lowering them to the surface level of the water, with Draco still on it is back. As his size got smaller, Draco now got a small guess as to what it was. Four long and strong legs with a body of muscles and a long neck, with wavy moving water down it's back as hair.
That and the fact that i'm starting an overnight job fulltime....anyway, let me know what you think. I was scratching my head at this chapter.
“Harry...,” Lily warned. He kept walking. James turned his head to the side and closed his eyes. He could hear Anna and Alexander start to make noises, fighting his magic.
It was okay if you could ignore that fact that his parents are never there.
The thought rang through the young boy’s head as he threw himself on the bed, burrowing in the big, white pillows. Every morning and day he returned from school, he would check his parents’ room and be disappointed time after time. Soon, he eventually stopped, but it never made the feelings go away, or lessen at all, the pain grew and grew.
As soon as baby Harry open his rich green eyes, the room was suddenly filled with crystal see through water growing over James head, and James was shocked to find out that he could breathe in the water like it was air. He looked down to check on Harry, but saw nothing, however, he still felt something in his hands. A second later, the water disappeared, leaving dry cloths behind and no evidence it was there at all.
Draco tried to lift his foot when he realized he couldn’t move it. There was something heavy restricting it. Tilting his head down, he saw something thin and pink around his ankle. He blinked before a sharp yank had him flying.
It made his body boil, urging him to do things that normally wouldn’t come close to his mind.
His mate, who he noticed, was now kicking his feet through the soggy sand, having climbed off him in a rush. “...Is crazy. I woke up on an island, in the middle of nowhere and a big ass dragon – a
2. Non-consensual Kissing
Draco was losing conscious fast. Whatever it was that was dragging him down and down to the sea floor, wasn’t being gentle with his body, and his air was running out.
The feeling popped back, as if it never left. The pull...but this time, it was stronger. The need to go there was stronger, and without his mother there to stop him, he can.
But what he saw was something he couldn’t explain. Whatever it was that was holding him up, was made of water. It was like some kind of densely thick gel. But the shape was strange.
Things that he didn’t value anymore.
Draco made up his mind. There were already too many questions about what all happened today...but this weird water creature had recused him, and listened to him when it didn't need to. And it seems like he cares about his somewhat. (
The made the lizard angry
The house was always cleaned, around the times he would be gone for school. He came back to the faint smell of ocean breeze cleaning products, even if he cleaned while he was there anyway. At least they remember what scent he preferred.
When he touched water, at his will, his body became the water in full sense. His mass could appear if he wanted it too, but at most times, he kept himself fluid.
“What are you doing?! Who are you?!” Draco needed his to talk. If he did, it would put a pause on whatever he’s preparing to him. His chest filled with anticipation; What’s gonna happen to him?
pull, as in
want something to stop if it feels good – no, it’s confusing his mind. Was it the kiss or the person behind that made it feel
Harry shook his head side to side roughly, showing how he disagreed with her. He could tell that his perimeter sized changed, he knew that. But He also knew that something, someone was pulling him to the right; his whole being was screaming that he needs to go to the right as soon as he could. It was important.
His mate let out a groan and tried to shake his arms to move his hands but couldn’t. His mate wasn’t a strong person, from the thinness of his arms, but he also wasn’t weak. His hand trailed over his chest, and stomach. He was perfect for him. His mate was his, and only his. The water around them surged.
He tried to sit up but found that he didn’t have any strength. He panted and slowly crept his other unoccupied hand to grip the man’s hair to try and pull him off. Thankfully hearing his plea, the man lifted his head, with glowing eyes and a wistful smile.
