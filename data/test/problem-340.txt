Draco took a deep breath, finding his voice after a moment. “Andromeda sent me. She said something about babysitting.” He scoffed, mostly chastising himself for the lapse of sanity where he had thought that Potter was fit,
"Try." Draco said as he climbed onto the bed and moved to the other side. Harry laid down, rubbing at his face before pulling the covers up. He stared at the ceiling for a bit before turning over and curling up along the blond's side. "Don't think, just sleep." He told Harry as he reached up and took his glasses from him. He folded them before reaching over and placing them on the table next to Harry's wand. It didn't take him long to fall asleep with his head on Draco's chest, fists clutching his shirt in a weird reversal of how Draco slept at Andromeda's.
Ron stared at him, gaping like a fish before closing his mouth and scratching the back of his neck. “Alright..”
She visibly stiffened at that comment, her shoulders tensing. Draco knitted his eyebrows. “Are you alright?”
"Sure." Draco nodded, moving to the pantry. "Look, I don't like that Parkinson is dating my little sister and I don't like that you are dating my best mate. I don't think you two are good enough. I don't know what little scheme you two are trying to pull but I don't buy it. Everyone else does, but I don't." Ron frowned.
By the time Harry returned, Pansy and Draco were kidding around in the kitchen making dinner. Draco was in nothing but Harry’s clothing again, smoking a cigarette as he shoved Pansy out of the way with a smirk. The girl was in a cut out tshirt and shorts and glared at him. “Arse, it says to stir before you add the sauce.”
I'm sorry for leaving you guys on a cliff hanger but I probably won't be updating until after convention weekend. If anyone is going to Momocon, feel free to say hi if you see me! I will have the_real_Karaage on my badge, but idk what I'm cosplaying each day.
“I have to get home.” Draco said, moving out of the door. “Bye Potter.” He said, walking off towards his house. Harry watched him go with a soft smile.
“What do you mean?” Hermione asked, frowning. Draco rolled his eyes. “You might be smart but you are really dense Granger.” He blew out smoke. Hermione waved her hand in front of her face. “Smoke, Malfoy.”
“Buggering shit, my mother is home.” He called to Pansy, stubbing out the cigarette before moving back into his room. He shoved some laundry off his bedside table before grabbing some air freshener. He sprayed his room, waving his hand around to try to get the smell to dissipate.
“Are you alright?” She asked her, pulling her up onto her feet. “Yeah, I am..” The redhead nodded, moving away from the bed towards her bag.
“No, maybe your parents need to start acting like adults. They need to take care of themselves for once. You spent your entire life trying to please them, take care of them. It’s time for you to take care of yourself.” She argued. “If not now, when? When you are married to some pureblooded bint, being pressured to have children? When your parents muck everything up again and you are left to clean the mess up?” She asked, her lips pulled into a tense frown. “The only reason your father and mother aren’t in prison is because of YOU!” She snapped. “You, Draco Malfoy, did nothing wrong. You were scared and pressured, wanting to please your parents. Wanted to be a good son-“
Hermione, Pansy and Ginny all looked at each other. "You don't suppose…" Ginny trailed off. "Well I it did happen, I'll hear about it." Pansy said with a snicker.
“It’s your birthday, Harry. Everyone should have cake on their birthday.” She smiled at him before grabbing his hand and pulling him over to where Pansy and Ginny were dancing. He felt so much better. With people crowding around him, looking up at him expectantly, a panic attack had started to rear it’s head and Luna had pulled him away just in time.
liked... He thought as a wave of jealousy washed over him, clawing at the surface. He glanced at Draco who was chatting with Stephanie about something.
“AHHH WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!” Draco yelled, trying to buck her off. “Get off me you uncivilized whale!” He yelled making Harry break his composure and die laughing at the door. The two froze, staring at him with wide eyes.
“Me and Ginny have been hanging out with Pansy.” She told her slowly. “Pansy?” He asked, raising an eyebrow. “I thought she might be seeing someone, so that makes since now.”
“Thank god. I know she means well but sometimes I just can’t.” She hoisted her bag up onto her shoulder.
Draco moved to the bathroom, looking himself over in the mirror. He washed his face, wiping the last bits of eyeliner from his eyes. He bit his lip, taking each piercing out slowly. Each time he felt like a piece of him was dying. The life he wanted so much and yet he wanted his world back even more. Every piercing solidified this decision. After he was done, he looked at himself in the mirror, just staring at his reflection. He looked naked… He didn’t even recognize himself anymore. He was neither the Draco before or the Draco after. He shuffled around in the drawers before finding a pair of scissors. He sat them down, leaning close, staring at his long hair in the mirror. He took a deep breath before taking up the scissors and moving towards his hair.
“I haven’t done anything to it. You don’t have to.” He muttered, looking down at his arm. “I know.” Harry said with a smile, running his  fingertips over the cuts gently before letting go. He leaned forward making Draco freeze up as the other came extremely close. Harry reached around grabbing the mug of coffee. He took a sip of it right in front of Draco’s face with a smirk. “You look good.” He turned moving to the table. Draco flushed, turning pink before becoming angry. Stupid fucking Potter.
"I change my friends minds…" Harry told him. "And I can protect you. I know I wasn't there this time but I will be."
“I wished it was that simple for me…” He said, shaking his head. “I want to talk to you about something but I don’t want you to freak out about it. I just I can’t deal with any arguments right now.”
He sighed laying back in bed before grabbing his wand, shoving the book in its place. He couldn't sleep. He really couldn't even eat what Draco had made for dinner. It smelled fantastic, but he just couldn't stomach it. What little he did manage to eat had come back up a few hours earlier.
Pansy answered the door, staring at him with a frown and knitted eyebrows. Before she could even open her mouth to say anything, Harry blurted out. “What’s wrong with him?”
Draco took a deep breath, walking into the room and moving to Pansy’s side. Pansy gave him a nod, her eyes darting to Lucius. The old man was sitting at the kitchen table, a mug of something in front of him and a scowl on his face.
"You weren't there, that's what woke me." Harry told him, taking his hand. "Come on. Let's go back to bed."
“Why not?” Pansy asked him. “Just don’t think about it. Just do it. You have to leave your parents some time Draco.”
“Sure.” Harry said with a nod. “This way..” He motioned for the other to follow him down to the kitchen. “Are you hungry?” He asked when they reached the bottom.
Harry turned,  walking back to the door. “What does he like to eat?” He asked, turning back to Pansy. “I know nothing with meat.”
“You pick the weirdest things Potter.” He muttered, as Harry handed him the plate. Draco stared at it. “I don’t eat meat.” He said, looking at the plate as if it would bite him. Harry took the plate back and dumped the bacon on his own. He handed the plate back to the blond. Draco rolled his eyes but took it and his coffee to the sitting room.
"No, I'm not." He said, squeezing him. "And you are the only one that's never treated me like I was." He with a smile on his lips. "Thank you."
When Draco finally registered the world around him again, he was sitting in his bed clad in a band shirt and sweats. He was curled up into himself in the middle of the bed with his hair still wet. He was about to get up when Pansy walked back into the room carrying an armful of clothing.
After a nice long shower, he walked downstairs in only a pair of Harry’s boxers and a tshirt leaving his clothes on the bathroom floor. He searched around the kitchen to find some things to cook for breakfast before pulling out a cigarette. He didn’t have to worry about smoke or his mother for once. He never knew what kind of a relief that was until now. He didn’t have to stand up straight, mind his diction and tone when he spoke. Didn’t have to make sure he looked presentable. He could get use to this. Something about this house felt so freeing. Like it was separate from everything else. It was safe… and felt open. Especially with all of Potter’s things lying around. Maybe that was why Potter liked being here.
Draco frowned. "I was just trying to have a conversation, Potter." He said, the last name feeling weird around his tongue now.
“You look nice.” He said with a smirk, looking her up and down.  She wore a long maxi dress over her swim suit and gold sandals. Her bushy hair was wrapped up in a tight bun at the back of her head.
Harry chuckled. “Nevermind, I mean I have enough money I suppose and I have a house, so I guess I just need to make the most of it.” He gave a small nod as a sharp knock sounded at the door. He looked up to see George and Ginny hurry in.
Lucius scoffed at that. “They are reaching. Go change, I can’t look at those hideous things anymore. It’s bad enough I have to live in this muggle dump, much less look at my son wearing muggle trash.” He muttered, taking a sip from the mug. Draco flashed his mother a glare before making a cup of coffee. He walked over, exchanging the mug for the coffee. He sniffed the contents and recoiled. Bourbon, that early in the morning. He kept his face neutral as he dumped the contents down the drain and Pansy served the plates to both his mother and father. His father was still muttering things as he ate, leaving Draco and Pansy to just disappear from the room.
“Yes and no.” Ginny answered her. “I really don’t know anymore.” She paused what she was doing. “But I wouldn’t worry about Draco. Whatever set Harry off, he won’t stop until everything is taken care of.”  She gave her a small reassuring smile.
“I have Andy… and Potter… as much as I don’t understand that. Go. I won’t stand here and let you throw this opportunity away. You’ve already stopped using magic because of me.” He said calmly.
Hermione giggled. “I’m not sure when it happened, but looks nice.” She said making Harry choke on his drink, turning red.
The girls clammed up, not even realizing that their arguing and muttering would have woken up the opposite person they had wanted. "Is Harry awake?" One of them asked. A blond Gryffindor, that looked about 5th year to Draco. He sighed, opening his mouth to answer but was cut off. "Draco, who is at the door?" Harry called to him. The girls started to whisper. "No one, Harry, just some girls." Draco called back as Harry came up to his side. He was in Draco's band tshirt and his Gryffindor lounge pants. His tattoo proudly on display for the gaggle of girls to see. "Hello?"  He greeted them, making some of them squeak and hide in their scarves.  The same blond as before, which Draco thought was their leader, spoke up. "Good Morning, Harry, we were just wondering if you wanted to join us or breakfast in the great hall."
After a bit, Harry joined him. “What is this rubbish?” Draco asked, picking at his eggs. “So this Buffy is a vampire slayer? And she goes to school? And she’s in love with this Angel bloke?” He asked with a frown.
“I sort of promised Granger that we could have Potter’s birthday party here.” She said in a rush, clenching her eyes closed.
Both Hermione and Pansy stared at her. Hermione’s expression was one of shock, her eyebrows receding up into her fringe. Pansy on the other hand didn’t look shocked, just more hesitant.
"I didn't know..." Draco said, moving to Harry's side. He sort of drifted there, not sure what to do. Harry gave him a genuine smile. "I don't like people knowing, but like I said, I'm just Harry, nothing special." He reached up and pulled Draco into a tight hug. Draco hugged him back. "You're wrong. You are special." Draco muttered into his shoulder.
“Nothing.” Pansy waved off the question. “I’m not doing it for you or Potter. I’m doing it for the last shred of hope that this awful plan of yours still works, because I don’t know about your end; but mine is doing down fast.” She frowned deeply, thinking about the note she had fished out of the bin after Draco had left.
“My name is Chris and I’ll being doing your tattoo.” He said, taking the page and nodding. “Shirt off.”
“I know.” He said, handing the scissors to Pansy. “I know what they are saying. And frankly, I don’t give a shit what they say. Because they are always going to say things. Be it true, lies, rumors, or cruel.” He shrugged. “It’s always been like this.”
“Oh, it’s fine. It’s actually nice to work there. Gin comes and helps every once in a while, and I see pretty much everyone from school. They… ask about you sometimes, but I don’t really tell them much more than you are fine.” He shrugged, looking at the other.
Harry nodded. “It’s nothing… I-“ He said thickly before swallowing hard. “I just… I just see them everywhere and I can’t do it anymore Ron..” He whispered, running his thumb over the warmth of his mug.
Narcissa nodded. “You are such a great girlfriend.” She smiled at her before leaving, shutting the door behind her. Pansy moved over, hanging off the side of the bed to check on Ginny.
“That’s great.” Pansy gave him a smile. He looked at her suspiciously. “What is going on? Why are you cleaning?” He said the word with disgust.
“I don’t know.” She sighed, walking over to stand on front of her. “I sort of think I should have never let him leave the Burrow, but then he would have left anyways. At least he is talking now, I don’t see him drinking as much, but I’m also not around him a lot.” She whispered, placing a hand on Pansy’s knee.
Chris stopped what he was doing, pulling Draco into a tight hug. “Hey, it’s going to be okay…” He whispered, rubbing his back. It took a while for Chris and Pansy to calm Draco down before he finished up the rest of his tattoo. Pansy paid for it, chatting away with Chris about going to buy Draco some new clothing. He recommended some shops in Camden, saying that Draco would look really hot in grunge. Draco thanked him for the tattoo and Chris slipped him a muggle piece of paper. “Call me sometime.”
“Basically.” Harry chuckled, settling down. “I’ve been watching it for a bit and it’s kinda grown on me.”
It didn’t take long to move their things into Potter’s house. His mother hadn’t said anything to him, just watched him go with sad eyes. He felt horrible about leaving her alone with his father, but he couldn’t stand it anymore.  Harry had cleaned out two bedrooms next to each other for the two and helped them get moved in.  Pansy took her time unpacking, hanging her clothing up in the large closet.
“Oh, fuck this bloody shit!” He yelled, throwing the bag at Harry, hitting him square in the chest. He stormed off without another word.
“So, I’ll let you think about that before you sentence them out of just plain spite and prejudice. Some people do what they do just to survive.” He said before tucking his wand into his pocket and storming out.
There is a lot of action in this chapter and a lot of time shifts. The shifts are tiny and all happen within a day and a night, I believe.  It starts from the exact same time as the end of the last chapter, just Pansy's side of the morning. Then it goes on from there.
“My mother gets tension headaches.” He muttered, slowly pulling his hands away. “Get some sleep.”  He told him, moving back to turn off the light. Harry laid down, getting settled again before Draco laid down on his side away from him. Harry stared at the ceiling for a while before reaching out and pulling the other close. Draco gave a hasty protest but didn’t move from him. He glared at the other before settling down comfortably next to his side.
Pansy scoffed. “The Almighty Granger, admitting she was wrong?” She chuckled. “No, we have done everything right. Draco is possibly the most stubborn person in the world and Potter is just oblivious to everything in the world.” She shrugged it off.
“Draco Malfoy saved my life numerous times over the past year, not to mention he was the reason why I defeated Voldemort that last time, him and his mother.” He stated.
He looked down at Teddy and hugged him tightly. “Thank you..” He told her, giving her a small smile.
Draco laid there, breathing hard before slowly pulling himself up. He moved  gently to the bathroom to wash his bleeding nose before going back to find Harry.
Harry laughed, smiling at the complete joy on his friends’ faces. He hadn’t seen them this happy in a very long time. “Yeah, mate, we are.”  He said softly, as Hermione giggled.
"Pff, Gryffindor." He rolled his eyes before running his hand through his hair. Harry wrapped his arms around him tightly, pulling him close. "It's alright?"
Harry watched him do this, taking in uneven shallow breaths as he stood there trying not to make a sound.
Compartmentalizing each room and setting goals for himself alleviated most of his stress and anxiety. He worked himself to the bone almost, his hands cut and bruising and his knees aching. By the time he was finished the sun was almost set. He tiptoed down the hall, wary of doing anything to wake the portrait of Walburga. He was almost at the end when he caught his toe on a loose floorboard and swore lately.
Draco watched him go, feeling a bit of panic rise in himself. He took a breath before ditching his cigarette and grabbing their trunks, making his way to the train, jackets under his arm.
“I understand.” She said with a smile. “Alright, so you know how to use a phone, that’s good. I will give you my number so you can just call me if you need anything at all.” She said, going through his entire outburst. “It’s okay to not know how to do anything. It’s nothing to be ashamed of. I will help you. And don’t worry about money, darling, if you need anything you just let me handle it. When is Cissy getting back?” She asked him.
Pansy was sitting with Draco in his room, the other smoking out of his window. He hadn’t said anything other than a short rant about how “Potter thinks he’s so bloody brilliant, the git.” and that Draco hadn’t gotten the part for the stove. After a bit of silence, she ordered them Chinese takeaway.
Harry frowned, moving to Draco before he could even say anything. "That's enough Ron." He told him, shielding the blond with his body. "Harry, he started it!" Ron yelped.
“Ginny? What’s wrong?” He whispered, wrapping his arm tighter around the blond. “Do you know where Draco is? He just ran off and he’s not at his house nor is he at Andy’s.”
He bit his lip, looking around the room before coming back to look at them. “You are serious?” He asked again before getting up.
Draco stood there, staring at him in shock. He bit his lip before feeling his face heat up. "It, it brings out your eyes." He choked out after a moment.
Harry nodded. “Hermione helped with most of it, but so did Parkinson.” He said, making Seamus and Ron snort.
. While everyone was frozen in shock, he pushed past some stupid Gryffindors, running towards where the other stood unarmed. He didn’t know what he was doing or thinking but his previous immobile body was moving of its own accord. He yelled for Potter, running between him and Voldemort. Another stupid decision that could have ended his life. He threw his wand to Potter before running towards his mother, pulling her out of the way, over rubble.
“Went to see Seamus’ family. Nice to have a little break after…” Dean said but seem to falter at the end. “I can’t believe Malfoy did all of this.” He said, changing the subject.
Draco waited halfway in the doorway before Chris appeared with a sly smile. "Hey, you. Long time no see." He said, hugging Draco tightly before moving around him with an appreciative stare. "Looking good. Tattoo is nice." He said, running his hand over Draco's piercings before the blond gave him a smirk and moved away. "Take good care of Harry for me." He said before moving over the waiting area, fixing himself a cup of coffee.
"As for me and Potter, you have definitely got to stop reading so many tabloids. For your information, not like it's any of your business, I am not a poof, first off. Secondly, it doesn't really matter what you think about it, Potter doesn't need your approval for anything he does. Maybe he wouldn't be so strung out all the time if you just left him alone and stop snapping at his heels all the time. I don't even see how Granger can stand dating you." He frowned.
After getting everything unpacked, Pansy and Draco took the money that Harry had given him and bought groceries. The other had nothing in his kitchen but bottles of alcohol. Which Draco poured out in the sink, Potter be damned.
The day after the party, Harry woke up with a massive hangover. He remembered everything, just not really how he had gotten home or into his bed. He didn’t remember where he left his cloths either. He got dressed and went to visit the Burrow. George was coming home and he had really wanted to see him again after so long.
Ginny started to laugh. “Oh, so it’s Draco now is it?” She asked, making Harry sputter and turn red. “It’ll be fine. His parents are asleep and I just dropped off Pansy there. I’m heading home, Ron’s waiting up for me.”
Harry felt his face flush a bit at that. “No, not really. We had cake and everyone got drunk. Traditional 18
Over the last few weeks, Harry had been drowning his crushing emotions and feelings in a steady supply of alcohol, sometimes not even waiting for the days that he wasn’t going to Andromeda’s. He would then arrive at her home, reeking of alcohol and having the worse hangover.
His dreams that night were filled with dark marks. His fingertips slowly running over soft but scarred skin. Colorful flowers blooming as he made a pathway….
Pansy pulled a flustered Draco out of the shop, laughing as she linked arms and started to walk down the street. “You know the point of flirting is not to replace what you can’t have with something that looks like it right?”
” He hissed before taking a breath, in which Teddy started to fuss again. He shifted the baby before continuing. “What more could you want for? I just cannot guess, you constantly complain to me; you should feel blessed. There are children in Africa starving to death and you don’t hear them
Harry closed the journal he had been reading, and looked at the time on the display of his phone. He sighed heavily before getting up. His birthday party was in a bit and Hermione would be here soon to “show” him the way. Right now he was feeling that anything would be better than this party. Washing the floorboards, watching lint collect in the corner of his wash room. Visit his parents graves.
Harry smirked. “Pay up, George!” The sandy blond grumbled as he pulled five galleons from his pocket and handed it over. “You guys bet on this?” Ginny asked, staring at them in disbelief.
He chuckled and started to dance with her, flittering around with his arms in the air just like her.
He was silent listening to the beating of Draco's heart before he opened his mouth to speak. "It's like you're screaming... in a crowded room and no one can hear.." He cleared his throat a bit. "You feel ashamed, that someone could be that important.. that without them, you feel like nothing. Completely numb."
Harry smiled, feeling a new set of tears fall down his face. Why didn’t Sirius show him these? Why didn’t he tell him about his parents? Why didn’t Remus? Did he know they were here? Questions bubbled up in his head, questions that he would never get an answer to because they were all dead. DEAD! Everyone was DEAD!!
He shoved the photos back into the box, taking a few deep breaths. He went to close the lid but something shiny caught his eye. He reached in and pulled out a necklace. On the chain hung a simple black band with what looked like a rune engraved into it. He couldn’t remember which one it represented though. Was this Sirius’s? He never mentioned being married or being with anyone. Nor had anyone else. All he had heard was that him and his father were joined at the hip and that Remus was always around. There was never any mention of any girlfriend except for his mother. Not even for Remus. Though, he had been kind of oblivious to Remus and Tonks’ relationship so it was possible that he overlooked something.
Harry frowned. “Yeah. I do.” He snapped, shoving his food away from him. Draco stared at him. “How? How could the great Harry Potter understand?” He whispered.
The prefect led Harry and Draco to their dorm, giving them the password before hurrying off. Harry walked in, looking at the small common room with a desk, sofa and chair next to a roaring fireplace. Harry moved up the stairs before going to his bed and unlocking his trunk.
I will try to get the next chapter up soon but I have a lot of catching up to do for school but after that I will get to writing it!
“There isn’t anyone.” He said a little too quickly. Chris raised an eyebrow. “It’s complicated.” Draco admitted lamely.
“You could always come stay with me?” He offered, looking away and scratching at the back of his neck.
“I can read.” He huffed at her around his cigarette, stirring the contents in the skillet as Pansy moved to grab the sauce. “I’m not sure what it means by saute, but I guess just let it cook? Why in Merlin’s name did you have to buy something so complicated.”  She frowned. “All because of Potter.” She muttered under her breath, making Draco whack her with the spoon he was using.
"Why?" Draco asked Harry, swallowing hard. Harry gave him a small smile. "I'm pretty sure you can get the symbolism." Harry told him with a smirk he didn't feel.
“Captain Oblivious is not going to know what hit him.” She scoffed. “If he can go seven years without realizing what was right in his face, then he won’t realize what we are doing.” She moved towards the bar with Hermione trailing after her.
“The chlorine is killing the germs in your cut. It’s not anything to worry about. Just hurts.” He explained.
Pansy shut the door, locking up before following him. She pointed to the stove, handing him the bag. “What happened to it?” He asked, opening it up. “Draco’s mother happened to it.” She muttered, crossing her arms.
I will be on and off until Sunday while I write the next chapter. And hopefully I will be able to post it by then! So come hang out with me and ask me some questions!
This chapter was bit hard to write, for a lot of reasons. But I hope you guys do like it. Leave me some comments!
“Mr. Potter?” He asked. Harry looked up, a bit out of breath. “Wait! I have something to say. On his behalf.” He moved to the front so that everyone could see him. The statement drew gasps from the crowd.
Draco nodded, getting up from the bed and gently knocking Harry away from the box. He continued what the other had started. “That seems reasonable.” He told him as Harry gave the blond’s back a soft smile.
Being in Harry Potter’s home was weird. He had been here before, had stayed the night before but there was something different about knowing that this was his home too, now. The house was huge, even to Draco. It was more compact than he was used to, but it possibly had more rooms and space than the manor.
“You’re living in my family’s ancestral home, of course I know. People talk.” He rolled his eyes before looking around. “Can I see the rest of it?” He asked, turning to look at him.
"Oy!" Draco protested, lighter out and already in position. Harry smiled at him as he placed it in his own mouth, leaning in for Draco to light it. The blond smirked, shaking his head as leaned in cupping his hand around the flame as Harry puffed a bit and pulled away.
Harry stood there, still holding the half a cup of tea for some reason in front of him. He understood exactly what she meant now. He had been through it. Many, many times the first few weeks after the Battle. He took a sip of his tea to give himself something to do. He had also contemplated different ways of killing himself as well.
Harry rolled his eyes, “Shut it Malfoy.” He chuckled. The blond stood there, his eyes locked on the other’s fingers on his arm. Harry’s thumb was slowly rubbing right over the dark mark without flinching or any signs of disgust or hesitation. Draco took a sharp intake of breath, pushing down those feelings before clearing his throat.
Draco ignored her as he stood underneath the scolding water, breathing deeply. He closed his eyes, running his hands through his hair before grabbing a scrub brush. He lathered it before bringing the brush down and scrubbing as hard as he could over his forearm. He opened his eyes, making sure that he didn’t mess up his tattoo. He scrubbed until soap started to turn pink. He barely flinched when he placed it underneath the water, washing all the soap from the wound. He watched it slowly bubble up with blood again before rinsing it off again.
“He’s great. Smart and spoiled.” Harry grinned. “Has me and Andromeda wrapped around his little finger.”
“Let me have him Malfoy.” Harry said, giving him a soft smile. Draco’s head shot up and he glared at him. “What are you doing here?” He asked, but handed over Teddy.
Harry choked on his tea in shock. “What?!” He spat out when he could get air after coughing. “Malfoy without magic?!” He laughed. A real laugh.
“Fuck you, Potter.” He hissed, glaring at him. Harry gave a short laugh. Draco was silent for a moment.
“Malfoy? Are you crazy?” He asked before catching himself. “Sorry, right, no arguments, forgot. But it’s Malfoy!” He said, crossing his arms.
Draco leaned over, running his fingertips over the tattoo gently. Harry winced. Draco chuckled. "Of all the things that's happened, Harry Potter can't even take a needle."
He took his mobile out of his pocket, walking down the pavement as he texted Hermione to ask Pansy for Malfoy’s address.
That seem like the wrong thing to say. Pansy caught the immediate reaction. Potter had gone from proudly gloating Draco into arguing to almost a complete shutdown. It was like almost a Draco type of shutting down and pulling away. He just completely stopped.
“It’s okay. We can hang out some other time before you go back.” He told her.  She leaned over hugging him. “You’ll be fine.”
She snorted. “I should be thanking you. “ She shook her head. “Biscuits?” She asked, pushing off of the counter and walking over to the pantry.
She smiled at him. “Thank you. Happy Birthday Harry!” She said, flinging her arms out and hugging him tightly. The sudden movement and the sudden touching made him jump and jerk away on instinct.
"How can I not? Ginny's dating a bloody Slytherin, Hermione having girl outings with bloody Slytherins, when did they get so chummy with Slytherins? It's like we are the only sane ones." Ron frowned.
Dean smiled, wrapping his arm tighter around Seamus’s waist. “I just couldn’t leave it like that.” He said, taking over the story. “He was so confused and just wanting to help, but I couldn’t let him go. I pulled him close and took hold of his face.  I said, ‘If one of us dies in this war, I would regret never doing this. Never feeling this way ever again.’ And I kissed him.”
He sat there, shocked. He hadn’t even thought about that. Of course Remus and Tonks would have left things. But Remus would had surely given him something that was or about his parents if he had had it. Andromeda smiled at him. “You don’t have to if you aren’t up to it or don’t want to. I just thought I would offer.”
Ron sat down next to him. “I know what you mean… George.. He dyed his hair… He said that he got tired of seeing him in the mirror every morning..”
He placed it back into the box, not even looking at the letters and the other things in the rest of the box as he closed it up. He didn’t have time to deal with this right now. He dusted himself off before taking the box up to his room. He buried it in the bottom of his trunk before setting back to work.
“If I die then I die and I won’t have to worry about any of this.” He muttered, grabbing a fork and shoving food into his mouth.
She opened the door a bit more, crossing her arms. “What are you talking about?” She asked defensively.
“I will.” He nodded, letting the warmth from the tea seep into his body as he watched Harry. The other was so sure of himself. So sure but yet, Draco knew he wasn’t. Potter was possibly more fucked up than he was and somehow the other was able to pull himself together… Something that Draco had yet to learn how to do.
Draco stared at him, a little shocked. “Are you drunk?” He asked, keeping his voice low to not wake Teddy.
He read the journals every night before getting drunk and passing out in random places of his house. The home improvement project was actually coming along nice. Most of the house had been torn down, replaced, repainted and redecorated. It was large and spacious with tons of natural light and bright paint. It didn’t even look like the same place at all. He had added some brickwork around the fireplaces using light colored stones. The kitchen was a light sunflower yellow, the various other rooms where white while the sitting room was colored a light bluish grey. The furniture looked more like something you would find at the Burrow, handmade and comfy. Handmade throws from Molly littered the place along with plush rugs on the hardwood floors.
“Thank you.” She told him seriously. “Don’t worry about it.” Harry told her, making Ron drop his jaw in shock. Ginny smiled at them, moving to continue the conversation with Seamus and Dean.
“Ginny is going out with Parkinson to the movies. Ron doesn’t get that it is a date and has since kept saying that he has to tag along to keep an eye on her friend. Also Ginny should not be friends with Slytherins. You can imagine the rest.”
It was his signature move. He would push and pull until he pushed the person to the point of not even wanting to bother with him anymore. He would let himself have what he wanted for a moment’s notice before his mind realized it, pulling back and doing what he thought other people expected of him. Mostly his parents. He would talk himself out of anything that brought him an ounce of happiness, feeling the compulsion to be this rigid model that his parents had cut out for him.
“She went off today. To talk to my mother.” He said bitterly. “He hasn’t felt good, Teddy, and she gave him some muggle medicine.” He explained, too tired to even fight or argue. Harry looked up at him and took in his appearance. The blond had horrible bed head, with dark circles underneath his eyes. He looked like he hadn’t slept or ate in a while. He.. He was wearing his shirt..
“It’s pretty bad. I mean his birthday is in like a few days and I don’t even think he will be coherent enough to realize it.”
“You have to remember that I know what I am doing and that I am of age and that like I said I don’t want arguments.” He told his coffee.
It was a buzzing needle contraption just like Pansy had said. The only thing was the ink wouldn’t go over his mark. Chris bit his lip, improvising the placement of the flowers to hid most of the mark. He couldn’t cover it up, but you could barely notice it from in the middle of the strikingly bright flowers.
Harry snorted. “Well her coping mechanism is driving me around the bin.” He muttered, stretching before getting off the cot. He stopped and sighed again. “I’m moving into Grimmauld Place..”
birthday party. Not like it was his problem if something went wrong. It was just… the excitement from both Pansy and Granger had been contagious. He left the stove, grabbing a bottle of beer and walking out onto the patio. Pansy had hired Chris to play for the party and he was currently setting up near the pool house. Draco had been avoiding him as much as he could for the last week or two. He just didn’t want to deal with everything that came with him now that he had other things going on in his life.
“All the more reason.” Harry and Pansy muttered at the same time, making them both freeze in shock. Draco stared at them both, eyebrows raised. “That’s just freaky.” He said before laughing. “This is insane, you know that right?” He asked them. “I can’t just up and move in with Potter.”
“As much as I hate to admit it, I’m worried about Draco and I’m sure you and the kitten over there are worried about Potter. I help you, you help me.” She said, ordering a drink.
“I am confused.” He said before telling her what had happened. Pansy gave him a smile. “At least he knew how to stop it. “
Harry scoffed. "Yeah, right. He might not lay a hand on you physically, but there are other forms of abuse Draco."
Kings Cross had not changed in the few months since Harry last saw it. It wasn't even crowded or bad, that was until they got to the Platform. It was like everything stopped and reverted to slow motion. Everyone turned to look at the late comers before gawking at them. Harry in his usual muggle clothing, standing there with Pansy on one side in her designer shades and clothing. The shocker for most was Draco, who was on Harry's other side, in his piercings, two toned hair and grunge muggle clothing.
“Merlin stripped pants I am putting the fucking bloody muggle money into the slot.” Draco fumed softly, the loud computer generated voice of the checking machine screaming at him about his purchase.
Pansy mocked him before pouring the sauce into the skillet. “There, is the majesty happy?” She asked, knocking him out of the way with her hip. “No, I’m not!” He yelled at him, pushing her out of the way and stirring again.
Draco rolled his eyes. “I am fine. I had one episode and she thinks I’m looney.” He muttered, looking down at the bandage.
He walked downstairs and stopped at the portrait. He sighed, bending down to pick up the sledgehammer. “This is for Sirius you old hag.” He said and before she could start to scream, he took one big swing and hit the portrait straight in the middle. It cracked like a whip and folded into itself crumbling away along with the wall.
“We talked the night I moved in. She understood that I really didn’t want to be in a relationship anymore. We are on good terms and it didn’t feel like we actually had anything since I haven’t seen her in almost a year. I think she is seeing someone to be perfectly honest.” He told him.
He knelt down, wrestling with the board before popping it loose. He set it aside before pulling out a battered old tin box. It looked like an old school muggle lunch box. He stared at the object in his hands confused. What would an old muggle lunchbox be doing in this house? He opened the set of latches, lifting the lid. In faded marker, S. Black was written on the inside of the lid in Sirius’s handwriting.
He turned around to see Harry standing in the doorway, holding a steaming mug. “It’s a lot to take in, I know. I felt the same way.” He said, walking in and handing him the mug. Draco took it, cradling it in both of his hands. Harry moved to the box, starting to unpack it.
He paused, trying to get his thoughts in order. "And when it's all over, and everything is done. Everyone is gone... you almost wish that you could have all the bad back... so that you could still have all the good.."
“During the Last bit of the Battle, when everyone thought I was dead. I was wandless. I stood in front of Voldemort without a wand, thinking I surely was going to die this time. But Draco… yelled at me, and threw himself between me and Voldemort.” He paused, looking up at the judge with a sharp frown. He turned to give the menacing look at the rest of the court room. “He threw himself between me and Voldemort at great risk to his own life and threw me his wand.” He held up the wand, turning back to the judge. “That was the reason I was able to defend myself. The wand you have right there,” Harry motioned to the wand in the holder in front of the judge. “Is actually mine and I want it back.” He said snidely.
Harry took a deep breath through his nostrils. "What's it to you?" He moved over and snatched the book from him.
“I mean, I can just go and talk to Kingsley. They would have to do it if it’s an order from the Minister.” Harry said with a smile.
She giggled. “Sirius would have loved to see this. Give it a few whacks for the old wanker.” She told him.
He missed his wand.. He missed his home.. His room with his books.  The peacocks out in the garden. The quidditch pitch. The warm fireplaces. He missed magic. He missed his friends… He missed the nook in his window that he would use to read for hours. He missed Hogwarts. The dampness of the Slytherin dungeons. The green and silver. It was like a piece of him was missing. A very large piece and he felt like an empty shell.
Draco had walked over to the edge of the pool, sticking his foot into the water and splashing a bit. Harry stood up , swimming over to him. “Why don’t you swim?” He asked the blond, holding onto the side as he floated there.
After a tour of the house, they settled down in the front room to eat and watch movies. They ate in silence for a while, watching a random movie that Draco had picked.
“Experience.” He said with a frown, one hand holding the blond’s wrist straight while the other gently but firmly held the cloth onto the wound.
Hermione shrugged as Ginny moved close to the stage to listen to the band. Pansy sat down at the table with Hermione, watching Ginny.
"Can you just shut your mouth, Malfoy, about things you don't understand." Harry told him as he buried the book in the trunk at the foot of the bed.
Draco nodded, pulling the clothing into his lap and holding up the shirt. “At least he has good taste in music.” He muttered, laying the shirt across his lap. “I think I might spend a few nights at Andromeda’s. Will you be okay with that?” He asked her.
He arrived at the Burrow just as something came whizzing pass his head. “I WILL NOT RON!” Ginny yelled as another shoe came flying past him.
“And then he starts being a complete prat.” Harry told her as he stuffed his face with bread. “What?” He asked. Hermione smiled at him, shaking her head. “I haven’t seen you this lively in a while. Also it feels like we are back in Hogwarts.” She told him.
“What is going on?” Ginny asked again, not letting go of the clasp as she stared at Pansy, her eye contact with the dark haired woman never wavering. Pansy bit her lip, pulling her sunglasses off in defeat. “Granger and me wanted to try to get Potter and Draco together so that maybe they could work out whatever it is that they have going on since they both know how the other feels.” Pansy muttered to the redhead, the intense gaze she was getting making her a bit nervous.
Harry looked at her. “What? But why?” He asked her, getting the point she was trying to make. With everyone going back to Hogwarts, Draco would be left alone.
“Somewhere!” He called back, disappearing around the corner. He remembered the way to Malfoy’s house even though he had only been there twice. It didn’t take long before he found himself in front of his door, knocking loudly.
Well better start while he had everyone's attention. He chuckled as he pulled his jacket off, dropping it over his trunk and stretching his arms up over his head. He flexed his forearm out, showing off the healed tattoo and the two wands tucked inside his waistband as his shirt lifted.
He gave him one last look before heading back down to sleep on the couch and make sure Teddy was alright.
“You did what you thought was best and I’ll support you, unless it’s a shit choice.” She added with a smirk.  Pansy chuckled. “Wouldn’t have it any other way.”
“Of course Granger would told you something different.” He said, his voice becoming louder and gaining the attention of everyone. Luna moved over to where they were, biting her lip.
“Sirius… he never let Remus get close again. He broke him over and over, pushing him away. Saying that he didn’t love him. Letting guilt and insecurity fester and eat away at Remus.” She told him. “It’s hard to be in love with someone that doesn’t want you, when every fiber of your being is completely and irrevocably still theirs’.”
Harry bit his lip, looking down at his food for a moment. Ginny grinned, knowing she had him at that. “Why would Malfoy want me there?” He asked.
“None taken. Not everyone has good taste like me.” Pansy snapped her compact closed, putting it and the lipstick back into her purse. “Unlike The Boy Who is Oblivious, Draco knows I am doing something and has come close to figuring it out on more than one occasion.” She picked up her glass, taking a small sip leaving a lipstick print.
Pansy chuckled. “No problem.” She smirked. “I didn’t mind. It’s nice to be manhandled every once in a while.”
“What are you going on about Evans?” Sirius said with a frown. “You think you know my boyfriend better than me?”
“Who gives a bloody shit?” He asked her, turning back around and taking the scissors up again. “I can’t go back to Hogwarts looking like this.”
“Muggle rags? I will not have muggle rags in my house.” Lucius announced to no one in particular. He sat there, wearing his usual black wizarding robes.
"It's just a panic attack." He told them softly. "He's been getting them for the last week." He explained. "It gets better when he knows where I am.." Draco sighed, looking down at the other in his arms, biting his lip. This was not the show he had meant to give the entire school but it really did seem like Harry's panics had been worse when the dark haired  man didn't know where he was.  Just like that time when he had his first one in the bedroom that night.
He was dragged inside before he could become lost in his thoughts and Pansy lead him to the counter. The muggle behind it smiled at the two. “How can I help you?” She asked him. He turned to Pansy unsure. She gave him a smile. “My friend here wants to know if it would be possible if you could do a cover up.”
“What’s wrong?” She asked him, a bit concerned. He let out a sigh. “Pansy got invited to go back to Hogwarts to finish her last year.” He told her plainly.
Another chapter or so and then the letters go out! I can't wait to write about it! Hope everyone liked this chapter! Please comment!
Ginny got up, shouldering her bag. “I can understand if this was just a summer thing.” She told her with an awkward smile.
“Are you offering me a job?” Harry asked, shocked. “Yeah, mate. Without you there would be no shop.” George laughed. “Now, get going, Ron help him. We can only do so much to distract her before she blows.” He smirked, popping out of the doorway. Ginny smiled at Harry. “Best of Luck.” She told him before disappearing down the stairs.
Harry was down at the end of the pool floating with Luna next to him. He had been at the party for three hours and all he could think of was wanting to go home.
Draco was standing there, looking completely uncomfortable. Harry looked at him confused for a bit before opening the door all the way. “Malfoy? What are you doing here?”
After a while, Harry lifted his head. The blond pushed his fringe back to look at his face properly, showing off the ever present scar that grew gasps from their onlookers and a few sounds of outrage.
“About time.” Harry laughed, “I was wondering if it was just the adrenaline.” He pulled on a clean shirt and joined Ron on the cot. “Nah, we’ve been taking it slow.” Ron confirmed.
She glared at him, before slowly crossing her arms. “Potter in swimming trunks.” She said slowly. “The thought that at any moment’s notice you could throw the lot of Gryffindors out on their arses.” She continued, raising a hand to examine her nails. “The thought that you have complete control over pretty much every aspect of this party. Possibly seeing Potter drunk. Potential Blackmail of same Gryffindors.” She listed off before Draco stopped her. “Okay, I get it. You can stop right there. Fine, I’ll do it. But it’ll be all out in the Garden and no one comes in the house.” He said pointedly to her. “And it’s your head if something happens.”
The next chapter time skip to boarding the hogwarts express!!! I'm really excited to write about that and Harry's furthering jealous and feelings for our resident Malfoy!
“Because I want you there, and Pansy wants me there. It’s the last time I get to hang out before I go back to Hogwarts. Please?” She pouted.
He bit his lip, turning around looking guiltier than she had ever seen him be. “ Er, Hi, Andromeda, you’re back.” He greeted, feeling his face heat up.
“What even is this?” Pansy asked her, crossing her arms. Ginny shrugged. Pansy huffed, smirking. “Now who is bullshitting?” She purred, leaning back against the armoire.
He scoffed, crossing his arms. “I don’t want to be home, I certainly do not want to play third wheel to Pansy and her miniature, plus there is someone I really don’t want to deal with right now. Andy is not home. Sadly to say, this is the last place I want to be, but the only place left.” He glared.
“What are you talking about?” He asked her with a frown. “Oh come on Draco, you can’t lie to me. He looked like Potter’s twin. Instant Potter, just add glasses.” She accused.
Harry looked up from the mess. “You were having a panic attack… among other things.” He dropped the sopping rag into the sink.
“What? Are you mental? Mum is going to have kittens!” Ron said as Harry shook his head. “I don’t care. I NEED to get out of here… it’s nothing personal… I just can’t- with all
“I put the clothes on hangers?” Harry replied, unsure as he turned to him. Draco rolled his eyes. “You are daft. I meant, this calm. How do you do it?” He asked him.
Draco frowned, visibly cringing. "Ergg it was the worst. The only time he would shut up was if he had something in his mouth. And even then it was not always a guarantee."
Pansy stilled, staring at her armoire. “And I won’t be.” She nodded, drumming her fingers on the wood surface before turning around.
Hermione and Pansy were the first to breakfast, sitting together as there was very few people in the Great Hall. Ron hurried over and flopped down next to Hermione with a sigh. "Does Zabini ever shut up?" He asked Pansy with a frown as he fixed his plate. Pansy chuckled. "No, not that I know of."
Draco chuckled as Harry took a long drag blowing out smoke leisurely before holding out the cigarette for the blond to take. Draco took it, pinching it between his index finger and thumb. "Harry smokes like an arse anyways." He smirked at the other as Pansy chuckled, and they split off a bit by themselves.
“They can’t just not let you go. It’s not right. It’s insane.” He called to him. “What they are doing is not right!” He yelled, seeing the curtain flutter from one of the windows. He took a deep breath. The only thing that they could would be yell at him.
Harry took his mobile out of his pocket and brought up a photo he had snapped at the party. He handed it over to George. He took it, staring at the image. “That is really freaky.” He said before handing it back.
There were a lot of things that I wanted to really work into this scene but had to cut half of it out from next time because god i didn't realize i wrote that much. I will explain more on Pansy later though. She is currently the only one that talks to Draco now.
She woke Harry, sitting down on the bed and holding out the mug. Harry sat up, looking at her confused. He took the mug, looking at it a moment. “Draco told him to give you that. He’s not really feeling well.”
He had never been out of the U.K. in his entire life, so he kept that in mind. He arrived to find Andromeda in the garage, covered in dirt and grease as she wheeled out Sirius’s old bike. Harry and Hadgrid had crashed landed it in her garden what felt like years ago. Teddy was in a play pen, exploring a soft toy with his mouth as a kid’s show played on an old Telly that was hooked up in the workspace of the garage.
Chris smiled sadly. “I know, but I least I tried.” He told him with a nod, leaning away. “Whoever he is, he’s a lucky bastard.”
"No, but isn't that them right there?" Ron said, pointing to the two walking into the Great Hall. Harry and Draco were dressed in their house robes but Harry was wearing a slytherin scarf around his neck.
“Gutting it? I thought that he would be shacking up with the Weaslette, shagging like rabbits.” He shrugged.
“I brought Lunch.” He told him, reaching up and  scratching the back of his neck. The blond’s face scrunched up in confusion. “First of all, if you haven’t noticed it’s dinner time. Secondly, what are you doing?” He asked, placing the book back onto the shelf using his left hand.
Draco turned to him, knocking ash off into the bowl. “I wanted a shower and breakfast.” He told him, plating the eggs and toast. He held one out for Harry. He smiled, taking the plate from him and setting it down. He took hold of Draco’s wrist, checking the wound.
“Whatever.” Draco nodded, looking up. Chris was standing there, staring at the two with a slight frown. Draco’s expression instantly turned blank and he pulled away from Harry.
“Where’s Hermione?” He asked Ron. The other dusted himself off before looking up at him. “Oy, what kind of greeting is that?” He asked with a chuckle. “How have you been?”
“As if I would find Malfoy fit,” She made a face, “No offense.” She added, picking her tea up and taking a large sip as if to wash the words out of her mouth. “I’ve done everything I could possibly think of, but nothing is working.”
Harry stood up a little straighter. “Parkinson… was upset? Like really upset?” He asked her. He knew something was off with Malfoy last night but he just figured it was because of Teddy. The little guy could be a complete handful at sometimes.
“Thank bloody fucking Merlin.” Remus sighed. “I’m going to the library.” He said, moving around them and up the stairs to the dorm.
"I know because it happened to me." He said, getting up from the floor. Draco looked over at him, raising an eyebrow.
“I’ll be back in a bit.” He told her moving her through the front door and locked up. He took a sip of his tea before starting to walk hurriedly down the pavement. “Where are you going?” She called to him, standing confused in front of his house.
and her friend. I know a few nice places. Put everything behind you. Especially that.” She said, moving her free hand to where his dark mark was peeping out from underneath his rolled sleeves.
There was a collective cheer before Dean and Seamus started. “I’m not sure when exactly it was but I think it might have been around the time Aberfoth arrived and we stopped the dementors from entering the school. We all ran back inside and scattered. I started up the staircase to help you.” Seamus said, motioning to Harry, who nodded. “We argued a bit, yelling at each other because we were scared and didn’t know what to do. I turned to go up the stairs and he grabbed my arm.”
Harry walked in the room, looking it over for the first time. “Not what I expected from you.” He said, taking in the simple furniture, the Zen tapestries, and clothing protruding from the drawers of his armoire.
"So what did you get?" Pansy asked Harry the next morning as they ate cereal. Draco froze coffee pot halfway to his mug. Harry was sitting there in a long sleeve quidditch shirt, flannel pj pants and nothing else.
Pansy watched him, curious as the dark haired man seem to take utter joy in pushing her best friend’s buttons.
A hush fell over the room as heads turned to look at Harry who was sitting there gobsmacked with his mouth hanging open in shock. The sorting hat had placed them together. The sorting hat thought they should be together. He felt a smile slowly spread across his lips before he gave a small chuckle at the outcome. He looked up and met Draco's eyes on him, and gave him a smile. Draco gave him a smirk, shaking his head before going back to talking to Pansy.
Hey guys! So sorry this took so long to get uploaded! As many of you know, I graduated college and I work nights at a theme park now, so my schedule is crazy! I hope you like this chapter! It's been a long time coming. This chapter stems from the journal entry in the last chapter and starts after ch 13.
“Who Is in my stove?” He hissed at Pansy. The girl opened her mouth to reply but before she could Harry resurfaced. “She burnt up the wires at the terminal, but I can fix it.” He said to Pansy before turning to Malfoy.
Harry rolled his eyes. "It's a symbol of Slytherin and Gryffindor! Am I the only one getting this?!" He grumbled.
“I… want to do it. I can come back another day and get started. I just need to go to the store.” He smiled. “I am in need of a sledgehammer.”
“How do you know?” Draco asked, hearing the door open again. He knew it was Pansy this time so he didn’t bother looking up.
Ginny nodded. “Heard that one before.” She muttered, looking away. “So I guess, I go out the window?” She nodded towards the window, turning to leave.
Harry frowned, shrugging of his robes before moving over to the other's bed. He picked up the scarf that Draco had disguarded and wrapped it around his neck. "How do I look?"
It was another two days before Harry was able to get back to Andromeda’s. He had been working himself to death fixing the house up. He had become a regular at the DIY Centre, the cashier knowing him by name now and always seem delighted to help him. It was always strange that he dropped everything to help him with his questions every time he came in, no matter how many customers were there in the shop.
"Get ready for bed." Draco told him before pulling away. He moved to his trunk, grabbing his clothing and going to the bathroom. When he came out, Harry was in a pair of Gryffindor lounge pants and a band shirt. He was laying on Draco's bed, underneath the emerald sheets. Draco couldn't get over how good he looked in green.  The blond walked over, climbing into bed. Harry smiled at him before reaching over and pulling Draco close. "Who said we were using my bed?" Draco purred, as Harry settled close to him. He pulled Harry's glasses off and placed them on the bedside table. "Get some sleep."
Chris held his hands up in surrender, bowing his head. “I’m sorry.” He turned and walked out of the door. Draco let out a shaky breath before hurrying upstairs to change.
“Yeah, wasn’t really feeling it after a bit.” Harry said as George started laughing. “I still can’t believe all of that happened. In Malfoy’s house of all places.”
He got up slowly and moved to the kitchen, groping his way down the stairs. After making a cup of tea, he sat there staring around the kitchen. When he couldn’t stand doing that anymore he went from room to room inspecting the contents. Everything was just as they left it the last time they had been here. A thick layer of dust had accumulated on the furniture and fixtures during the months of neglect. He busied himself for the next long string of hours cleaning and organizing each room.
Harry moved to help her, turning the trunk right side up and placing He the items savaged inside. Once that was done, he moved around, collecting over things like books and journals. He left the clothing there, not even bothering with it. With Pansy's help, they pretty much cleared the room of everything Draco left behind that was valuable to him. Once they were given the go ahead, they left carting the trunk back home.
He had been talking to Andromeda over the last two days. There was just something about her that compelled him to tell her about everything. Well
Andromeda returned to her home early that morning, glad as ever to be away from her brother in law. That man could drive a saint to murder or drink. At least Draco didn’t have to worry as much with his parents at home now. She went to check on Teddy first, finding him sound asleep in his crib. She smiled, kissing his forehead before going to check if Draco was alright.
"Be a Professor. You are good at it." Draco said, shrugging off the comment before walking out the door.
“Fuck you!” He yelled, grabbing a spatula and hitting Harry square in the back. Harry jumped, choking a bit on his coffee. “You wish, Draco.” He called, settling down in his chair and starting to eat. Draco bit his lip, shaking his head. Fucking Gryffindors.
He ran the scrub brush under the water before starting to scrub himself completely raw. He didn’t stop until his fingers started to hurt. He rinsed off slowly, turning off the water before slipping down and crumpling on the floor of the shower. He sat there staring at  nothing and everything. He didn’t feel anything. He should feel something, considering his arm was bleeding. He didn’t know how long it had been. He just sat there until he heard Pansy yell through the door again. She finally banged open the door after a few tries.
"Then stop jerking Draco around, and he is not going back to Hogwarts." Pansy frowned, sitting back and crossing her arms. "What if someone does something? What if someone hurts Draco? Curses him. Wants to take their pound of flesh?"
“Harry! Thank goodness! I have been trying to get a hold of you for hours.” Hermione said with a sigh. “I almost called Malfoy’s mobile.”
The shop keep in the liquor store gave him a weird look when he staggered in and bought his usual supply of rum and bourbon but didn’t say anything as they rung Harry up. He staggered back to his home, locking up behind himself before opening the bottle of rum. He had half the bottle gone by the time he fell into his bed, passing out in nothing but his swim suit and trainers.
Draco didn’t answer him as he grabbed the mug and walked out and up the stairs. He moved into Pansy’s room, crawling into her bed and close to her. “Draco? Draco what’s wrong?” She asked, sitting up and pulling him close. “C-Can you give this to Harry, please?” He asked her, not able to stop the tears.
“Been worse, can’t really complain.” He joked, shifting Teddy a bit before walking over to her. “You?”
Harry nodded. “You too…” He held up his hand and in a clear voice said, “12 Grimmauld Place.” He disappeared in a puff of flames.
"They were talking about it at the ministry when I went." He shrugged. "They are awarding Remus one in the coming weeks." He sighed, trying to pull away but Draco wouldn't let him. "I don't even know why I am telling you this.. You probably don't even want to be here..." He chuckled.
“Yes, she’s fine as far as I can tell. She’s moving in with me. I know that it wouldn’t be much but I know that her parents are selling the house and mine is paid for, I think. So it was the only thing to do. She’s helped me so much. I just needed her.. there… you know?” He said, looking up at her as he reached for his cup.
She gave him a smile before rolling her eyes. “Okay I cannot deal with a mopey sappy Draco anymore. You are coming with me. Get dressed. We are going shopping and we are buying you new,” She looked him up and down, “New everything. Oh darling you look dreadful and I know you haven’t left this house in weeks. I am doing myself a favor because my eyes can’t take this anymore.” She sighed. Draco smirked, getting up and doing what she said.
He had just finished pouring hot water into his tea when Hermione appeared out of the fireplace. “Harry?” She asked, dusting herself off. “Yes, I’m fine.” Harry answered, closing the journal and placing it into an empty drawer before turning to face her.
“What happened?” He asked her, clearing his throat. She walked over, sitting next to him on the bed. “I’m not sure… you were just gone. You weren’t there at all.” She told him. He nodded, reaching over and grabbing the clothing out of her arms. “These aren’t mine.”
"I... I lived in the cupboard under the stairs until I was 11." He whispered. "When I was living with my aunt and uncle."
“No.. At least I don’t think so..” Sirius said before was he was drowned out by a huffed sigh of frustration.
Draco laughed as he followed her down to the kitchen. He opened the cabinet, grabbing a box of crackers. He sat down on the counter, watching her as she lit the stove and started to boil water.
Pansy turned to him. “Just let it go. Just bloody fuck them.” She told him, placing her clothing into a box. “We are survivors. It’s what we do.” She continued. “Your parents have made their choice. It’s not ours. We are going to survive this.”
The sorting went as the sorting always went and was soon over with each house having a few new members. Professor McGonagall stood up and moved to the center of the platform. The stance reminded Harry of Dumbledore and he felt a ping of heartache.
Draco watched him with a worried look. “Don’t..” He said before clearing his throat. “Don’t hurt my tattoo.”
“No, someone that Harry will listen to. Andromeda.” She corrected as Pansy grabbed a bottle of water for Ginny.
He took a deep breath just as a knock sounded on his door. He wiped at his face before getting up and answering it. His mother stood there in her dressing gown, holding a steaming cup of what smelt like hot chocolate.  He bit his lip as she offered it to him with a soft smile. He took it, looking down at the mug. “Where is Pansy going?” She asked him, looking him over.  He took a small sip of the drink.
Ginny just smiled softly as if she knew this big secret. “If you see something but don’t acknowledge it, than no one realizes you were there and you can just pretend not to exist.” She said, turning to stare at Hermione pointedly. Hermione’s breath caught and she nodded slowly, understanding what the other meant. Pansy eyed them confused but let it go.
Draco listened to him without interrupting, holding him still. " No one will ever understand just how... much it hurts.." He breathed. "You feel hopeless, like nothing in the world can save you.."
“They just left you here?” She clarified, knowing what that meant, even though Draco wouldn’t tell her. They had left him without any food, or money, or any basic knowledge of how to fend for himself. Not to mention they broke parole, leaving Draco to pick up the pieces yet again.
“I’m surprised he hasn’t caught on to something being wrong. I mean I called Malfoy fit for Merlin sakes and he said nothing. Nothing!” Hermione frowned, crossing her legs under the café table. Pansy was sitting across from her, compact open and reapplying lipstick. “Are you serious?” She asked, eyeing her over the top of the compact.
Harry was standing there with a shit eating grin on his face when Draco slowly resurfaced, looking like a drowned rat. He shrugged off his soaking wet flannel shirt before turning to glare at Harry. “POTTER!” He screamed before lunging at him. “Oh fuck!” Harry said, trying to get away but Draco jumped him from behind and shoved him underwater. Harry resurfaced but was only grabbed again by the blond.
“And you would know?” He asked, grabbing the food bag and opening it. He stared at the food before sitting back in shock. “You really did talk to her.”
“Andromeda’s.” He said shortly. “I told her what happened and she helped us out.” He said, putting up the meals and the groceries.
He felt his mouth drop in shock, starring at it with wide eyes. Ron looked a little uneasy as he stared at Harry, his smile wavering. Harry couldn’t stand all of their eyes on him, that book staring him in the face, the closeness of Molly hoovering… just hoovering... and when she patted his hand he just lost it. He shoved the book off the table with trembling hands. His eyes watering behind his glasses as he scrambled as fast as he could out his seat and ran up the stairs amidst calls of his name.
“You.. can call me Draco as long as I can call you Harry.” He smirked, getting up a bit shaky. “You shouldn’t drink this stuff.” He said, taking the bottle and dumping it down the drain.
“I was really worried about you when Chris said you bolted but I just thought you came home. And then you weren’t answering your mobile…” She told him.
Hermione cleared her throat before continuing, “It was something that Malfoy said the other day. He said that after everything that happened, you would want peace.”
Pansy looked him over. "What part? Because you been acting like a complete nutter these last few days. Kissing Draco, getting this tattoo, moving us in here..."
He got dressed, leaving Pansy to find food for lunch and ring him when she had a reservation. When he got to the address, it was a muggle garage. He couldn’t find the door so he walked around and through the workshop, following the sound of the loud music. He recognized the rock tune, it was one that Chris’s band had done a cover of. Nirvana was what he had said the name of the American Muggle band was if he remembered correctly.
Draco woke up to the sound of Pansy in the shower. His parents were still gone, leaving him isolated in muggle Camden again. He went downstairs to the kitchen, finding a letter on the windowsill. He recognized the scrolling handwriting of his mother and opened it with a little more force than was necessary. He scanned it, frowning at the words before crumpling it up. They had gone to Scotland to stay with her cousin. Which he wasn’t so entirely sure that it was permittable in the lines of their probation, but he didn’t care. His mother had said it was for his father’s health and that the stress of all the muggle things were going to send her to St. Mungo’s. They would be back in two weeks’ time, permitting that their health had recovered. He threw the letter in the bin before walking over to the fridge. He blinked at the stacked Tupperware before pulling them out.
“No, we aren’t. At least I’m not so sure… It’s complicated.” He said, placing his cup back down as she nodded. “Alright.”
The silver liquid of the memory slowly poured from the bottle into the basin, swirling around innocently before a image made itself known. The liquid sucked him in, slowly becoming less fuzzy like as if he was tuning an antenna on an old telly.

She smiled. “Good, I was making sure that you were willing to defend this. There will be a lot of anger pointed at this decision. Are you willing to stand by him and this decision? Against anyone?” She asked him. “Because if you are not, I’m not bringing him back here where his safety is questionable.”
He shook those thoughts from his head as he blew out smoke, running his free hand through his hair. It hung long and messy into his eyes. He knew he looked like utter shit. He hadn’t been sleeping well, if at all, and dark circles had appeared. He couldn’t really remember what the dreams were about, but he could remember the feeling that left him shaken and drenched in sweat. He looked back down at his mark, the scared lines barely there but stood out white on the tough skin. He had tried to gauge out the image, hoping that the sharp knife would work since nothing else had. It had not, just making it grow a thick protective skin. It didn’t mess up his tattoo, but now he just had this ugly blotch of skin and white lines making the dark mark a little more noticeable in the middle of his flowers.
"8th years will shown to their dormitories after the feast and will be given their schedules in the morning." McGonagall continued before putting up the parchment. "Here's to new beginnings and a wonderful new year." She said before stepping back.
"Dude, ask him the fuck out. He's already turned me down once before, but I can always try again." He said, making Harry jerk. Chris leaned his body onto Harry's arm. "Stay the fuck still. I have a reputation to maintain." He grunted, finishing up before wiping him clean.
Draco looked at him unsure. “It wouldn’t violate your probation and they shouldn’t have a problem since it’s me.” Harry added.
There will be more journal entries from Remus. They will be placed as little intermission chapters as the story goes on, and will be titled by their dates.
He knew he looked ridiculous, standing in their front garden in last night’s clothes and holding a cup of tea. Pansy didn’t really look that well herself, her makeup was a bit smudged around the corners of her eyes and her lipstick had rubbed off. Her eyes were a bit red.
Draco rolled his eyes, turning away from him before shedding his own jacket, placing it on top of Harry's.  He turned to Pansy, giving her a pointed look before glancing back at Harry with all the subtleness of a bull in a china shop.
“From what I have overheard, apparently our sister is dating a questionable Slytherin and Ron doesn’t even realize it.” George chuckled over the rim of his mug.
Hello! I hope everyone is well. I spent over a week writing and editing this massive update for you. Over 12 pages and almost 6k words. I really wanted to get into the slow mindset of Draco and Harry again, but I also wanted to get Ginny's insight over all of this. I feel like Harry would really talk to her about things, which was what lead to the events in the beginning of the fic. I really hope you like it! Kudos and comments are appreciated!
Harry shook his head, not sure of what he wanted to say, he just felt like his chest was closing up every time the blond moved to the door. He didn't even know what was going on, much less how to explain it to him. He felt his throat tightening, and he felt the panic come back. "I was..."
He choked on the smoke. “Seriously? I get to meet the girlfriend?” He smirked. “Finally it is about time. It’s been two months Pansy. Two months.”
Oh god I don't even know when the last time I updated this story and I am so so so sorry. I have ch 15 written out, just gotta finish it up. My job is pretty demanding and I just graduated from college and I'm transferring to finish up my second degree. Things are kinda hectic and have been for a very long time. I love this story and would never abandon it. I will ch 15 up tonight or tomorrow before I go to work! I hope you guys are still with me and that you still love this story.
“What about you, Ginny?” Seamus asked her as their drinks arrived. “What about me?” She asked him, passing the drinks along the table. “You and Parkinson. When did that happen?”
The blond felt a jolt again, the sound of his name passing through the other lips making him feel a bit hot.
She smirked, letting out a chuckle as she blew on her nails to get them to dry. “But you are gay.” She raised an eyebrow as she looked over her shoulder at him.
It took the judge almost ten whole minutes to calm the courtroom before he sentenced him and the rest of his family to live out their entire probation without magic in a muggle neighborhood. They had been stripped of all titles and all assets. Everything they removed from their home was looked over by Aurors and tested for dark magic.
"My... friend wanted to get a tattoo done. He has an appointment with Chris." He told her. Stephanie smiled. "I'll get him." She said, walking off.
Pansy chuckled. "The feeling is mutual, Weasley." She said as she stirred her coffee. "But you are going to have to deal with me. I'm your girlfriend's roommate and if she would have me, I will be dating your sister."
“Either I am hallucinating from some unknown drug that I did not take or that is Weasley and Granger.” Draco muttered, turning to glare at Pansy. She looked away from him, guilty.
“You want to know?! They gave me six more months because they thought it wasn’t long enough! They will find every and any excuse to keep us here, isolated, without magic!” He yelled.
She sighed. “I didn’t hate him. I thought my daughter was just being reckless. Not because of Remus being a werewolf, but because I could still see how much that boy loved my cousin. Even when Sirius was still alive, I saw the way he looked at him. But Sirius… He broke him. He broke Remus to a point where I can’t even understand how the other could feel anything afterwards.” She said softly.
Ginny opened her mouth to say something, but then stopped to give her a look before turning to Hermione who just shrugged. “It seemed like a good idea at the time considering that Harry hasn’t talked to anyone in weeks and you saw how he was when we visited him the other day.” Hermione explained, looking worried.
Things are moving fast now! Everything has been building on the realization that none of them were going back to hogwarts and now, that kind of went out the window. Next chapter will show what the actual letter said, from Harry's side and others things.
When he got home, he couldn’t really stay still. The quiet was unbearable. He checked the time on his mobile. It was late but wasn’t too late. Andromeda wouldn’t mind if he stopped by. He missed Teddy and hadn’t seen him or her in days.
He glanced at the receipt before putting it in the bag and handing it to the blond. “Why are you buying a spout?” He asked curiously.
Harry laughed before scrambling up and over to his trunk. Most of his things were still packed but some had spilled out and had been made its way all over the room. Ron helped him as best he could, throwing articles of clothing and shoes at him. A few moments later there was a loud crash and a shrill scream from Ginny. Harry chuckled and made a mental note to send her a nice box of chocolates later.
“Who said you could come in my house? Maybe I didn’t want to fix it. What makes you think you are wanted? Why are you always around?” He growled.
“What do you mean the way he looks?” George asked, laughing as Dean nudged Seamus smirking. The other frowned, leaning away from him. Dean leaned forward, wrapping an arm around him before hauling him into his lap. Seamus huffed, his frown deepening. Dean leaned close, whispering into his ear before Seamus smiled and gave him a quick peck.
“Why not?” She asked, adjusting her cleavage before the master bedroom door opened again. “Draco? Can you make Dinner?” His mother called out.
He felt his chest constrict as flashes of their hollow lifeless faces came and when and his ears filled with the sounds of screaming. He gasped, wanting nothing more to shut down. He called to Andromeda that he was leaving before hurrying out as fast as he could.
Ginny watched them go with a chuckle, biting her lip before turning back to Harry. "First of all, where the hell did you get this?" She said, holding up his arm and inexplicably showing everyone it in all it's glory right side up this time.
“HARRY! DID YOU GET ONE?!” Hermione called, rushing over to him.  Harry nodded. “Yeah.. What is going on?” He asked her.
Harry bit his lip, scratching at the back of his neck. He shrugged. “I… I’m just used to it. I mean, there isn’t any reason to get upset because it won’t change anything.”
"I get it. Message received. No more talking about your godfather and your books." Draco said with a nod, twisting the covers in his hands nervously. "Plus, what would you know about it." He scoffed.
"Stop trying to leave me!" He shouted, getting irritated. Draco froze, his breath catching. "Everyone bloody leaves.." Harry whispered, feeling something crack.
Draco couldn’t keep the chuckle in at how Potter had side stepped him and refused his handshake. Chris walked over to the blond. “I would ask if you were alright but it looked like Harry had you taken care of.” He said, a note of jealousy in his voice.
After a few hours, Draco closed his book and placed it next to Harry’s glasses. That fucking bastard. He had actually gone and done it. Somehow waved his
Hermione giggled a bit. “Technically it was not us, it was Andromeda’s idea.” She said as Draco hurried around the corner. Pansy sighed, rolling her eyes as she went to greet him. Not a second later did Harry show up, smiling at Hermione. He raised an eyebrow when he saw Malfoy there, confused. “Are you following me now?” He asked, a little weirded out.
"Oh, for bloody fuck's sake, Draco, stop trying to leave when I'm bloody talking to you!" Harry snapped, frowning at the other. "Get your arse over here."
“I’m making sure it’s not infected.” Harry stated with a glare, inspecting the cuts. He pulled him into the kitchen as the other protested loudly. He pulled the first aid kit out of the shopping bag, pushing the blond into a chair. He kept a hold on his wrist before sitting down. He opened the alcohol pads, swapping it over the area.
Harry’s eyes widen as he took in Malfoy’s appearance from where he was sitting on the floor, not even bothering to stand up. He had dyed his undercut a dark almost blue black with the natural white blond hanging long into his eyes. He had a piercing in his eyebrow, along with a handful of others in his ears. His eyes were lined with dark eyeliner, and he was wearing black nail polish. He had a ripped band shirt with black tight ripped denim. He had a pair of worn out trainers on and a pack of cigarettes in the pocket of his flannel shirt.
Harry looked up at him over the top of his glasses. “It’s only alcohol. It won’t hurt it.” He stated, putting some antiseptic on it before searching for a bandage. He didn’t say anything else about it as he wrapped the gauze around his forearm. Draco watched him, flinching a bit at the roughness of Harry’s callused fingers.
She smiled at him, moving over to sit at the table. “So apparently you are going on a double date slash group date with me and Pansy.”
Hermione stopped in her tracks staring at the two. The way Draco would lean in as if dropping his guard but then he would snap back, his whole body rigid, leaning away from the dark haired man. Chris smiled softly every time this would happen as if it was natural. He reached up and pushed Draco’s hair out of his eyes, biting his lip ring nervous.
Everyone, as he had predicted, had been treating him like glass. Dean had been the first one to do it. Cutting off sentences, pitiful eyes and sympathetic pats on his shoulder. No one spoke of the war or anything heavy, as if trying to make sure everything stayed light and fluffy. As if he was fragile and would break at any second. He hated it.
He ignored her. “Saint Potter is probably tired of everyone’s shit. If I had you lot all in my face and all I wanted was peace, I would drink too.” He said, dropping the cigarette and stomping it out with his trainer. “This is enough mind-fuckery for me tonight. This whole scene is driving me mental.” He turned to Pansy with a glare. “I am going to find Chris before he gets on stage. I’ll ring you later if I can’t find you Pans.” He told her before walking off.
Draco’s head jerked up again. “You’re apologizing to me?” He let out a chuckle of disbelief. Harry looked at him, again confused. “Yeah, because I called you Draco.”
It starts off during the hours that Draco went missing at the party and continues till long after the party is over. PLEASE READ THE NOTES FOR WARNINGS FOR THIS CHAPTER!
“Just know my offer still stands, and don’t worry about anything. Things tend to have a way of working themselves out.” She smiled at him. He gave her a smile in return. “Thank you.”
Harry sighed and looked at Ron finally. “I need to get out of here… No offense Ron but your Mum has really lost the plot… I know she means well but bloody hell…” He whispered, running his hand over his face before reaching for his glasses. He sat up, pulling them on and sighed.
"Maybe he was just trying to make a point. A bad point but it seemed like Weasley wouldn't stop for anything. Didn't you notice Harry was shielding you from him and looking you over for damage?" She asked him. He shook his head. "Walk with me. I need air."
“Um, chocolate please.” He said, moving back and placing Teddy in his swing again. He turned on the switch and the swing started to move back and forth. “I didn’t do anything really, I just told the truth.”
Draco smiled, hugging him back tightly. "I know…" He buried his face into the fabric of Harry's shirt for a moment. "Thank you." He whispered before pulling back nervously. Ever since that kiss, Draco hadn't known how to act around the other.
He slumped a bit against the doorway, exhausted. He just wanted to sleep. His eyes roamed over Harry’s body as he fixed something in the microwave and tended to the kettle. He shook the thoughts from his head and turned on his heel, walking back into the sitting room. He settled down on the couch, pulling a blanket over his legs as he waited.
Once his eyes were closed, flashes of his nightmare came back. Tonks, Remus, Sirius, Fred… among the various others.
He didn’t know how he had come to be standing outside a very shady looking muggle “tattoo” shop but he was never one to question Pansy when she was on a mission. He took a look at his Dark Mark, biting his lip. Did he really deserve to start a new life?
He reached behind him, grabbing a spoon from the drying rack. He handed it to the other before coming back to his seat. Harry accepted the silent invitation, joining him and eating in silence for a bit.
“Easy?! You think this is easy?” He hissed. “Having no magic, living without any magic? Without anything or anyone?!” He yelled, rearing back and punching him in the face as hard as he could. Harry’s head jerked to the right with the force, knocking his glasses askew.
It took Harry and Andromeda almost another two weeks before they were finished with the garage. He had picked up a sort of routine. Two days on his own house, then two days with Andromeda. The nights that he wasn’t going to be going to Andromeda’s, he drank heavily. Sometimes not even making it to the bedroom and passing out in the hallway or lounge. He was on great terms with both the cashier at the shady liquor store and the DIY Centre shop keep as he saw them every other day.
“Making breakfast, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, and it’s a little after 7.” He answered in order, taking down a plate and placing eggs and bacon on it.
She blinked. “There is a little French shop near here that serves the best French onion soup. Get it with the vegetable broth and the Pain brie.” She told him. He nodded, walking out the door.
“No.” He shook his head. “I haven’t really done anything. I mean, I cleaned up my house but that’s about it.” He said before remembering the stupid portrait. “By the way, I was wanting to ask you about something. How do you get a portrait down that is put up with an everlasting sticking charm?”
“What has Potter been doing?” Pansy asked, curious. “I’ve heard rumors but nothing really concrete.”
“Every little thing that you have said and done, feels like it's deep within me. Doesn't really matter if you're on the run….” He trailed off, stilling for a moment lost in thought the smile fading from his lips a bit.  “It seems like we're meant to be.” He finished, letting the telly sing the chorus again. He went back to what he was doing, turning to check on Teddy.
“You look fine. Your makeup is perfect.” He told her, sounding a bit bored.  She nodded, pulling on her heels before grabbing her clutch.
“For once in your life, I’m going to have to ask you to do something I will never ask you again. Trust me, Granger. Just this once, and then you can go back to being suspicious of me. If this doesn’t work, than I am out of ideas and we are, pardon my language, royally fucked. And not in the way I usually like.” She stated.
He forced himself to swallow the liquid before taking a deep breath. “Thanks.” He told her, which shocked her again. “Are his parents still gone?” He asked.
“His mother sent an owl saying that she was coming home today, but I’m not sure.” She shrugged.  Harry nodded, not really sure what to say after that. He looked at Ginny, who was dressed in a quidditch jersey and jeans with her hair tied back into a low ponytail. She looked worried, not about Malfoy, but about Parkinson.
“I don’t know how to do anything. Anything at all!” He burst out. The words just came rolling out and he couldn’t stop them. It was like projectile word vomit. All over her sitting room. “I mean, we have only  survived this far because of Pansy and her pretty much muggle girlfriend and their muggleborn best friend. And this contraption.” He said, holding up his phone. “I press the buttons and people bring me food. Or I send a message to Pansy and she brings me food. I have no discernible talents with muggle things. I don’t know what half of it does, nor do I really want to know. I don’t have any money as my vaults have been seized, I have little muggle money and the only muggle money that I have been getting is from Pansy, who, which by the way, is pretty much in the same boat as me, but hasn’t told anyone that her parents left her and moved to SPAIN!” He looked at her wide eyed and breathing heavily, shocked by what had come out of his mouth.
“Yeah, you know her, bloody know it all.” He looked away embarrassed. “How is that getting along?” He asked, kneeling down in front of his trunk and digging around in it.
He knew he wanted to get rid of the wall the portrait was on and the wall the tapestry was glued to. He walked from room to room with a muggle journal and pencil, writing down notes, measurements and drawings. After a while he went back downstairs, thinking of how ridiculous he must have looked. Savior of the Wizarding world, deconstructing his house like a simple muggle. True, he could have this all done with just a few flicks of his wand. This way though, seemed more poetic. The Most Noble and Ancient House of Black being torn down the muggle way. Seem more cathartic.
“Harry, of course I’m fine.” She sighed. “Ginny and Me were waiting for Pansy the other day and she looked like she was about to cry. She wouldn’t tell us what had happened, but I’ve never seen her like that. She was as white as a sheet, and shaking. Like she had seen a ghost. I just know it was something to do with Draco.” She confessed.
Draco was standing in his kitchen, smoking a cigarette irritated as he waited for the oven to get done. He looked over the cookbook that he had gotten from Andromeda again, making sure that he had done everything. He bit his lip, looking over everything that was laid out on the counters. Pansy and Granger had helped him get everything. Drinks and ice, along with snacks and other things. Pansy had grabbed every bottle of liquor she could find from her house and brought it over. Granger seem to be hesitant about the addition but didn’t say anything.
Even though it is mentioned in the tags, let me restate it. This story is rated Mature for a reason. Please read the tags.
Ron looked around the kitchen, taking in the extreme changes as something to do. “You did a great job, with this.”
“Oh for fucks sake someone please tell me what is going on?!” Harry yelled, finally snapping. Ginny gave a jump at the unexpected yell but Pansy unfolded her arms. She looked at Harry, narrowing her eyes a bit before nodding.
It took not even two full days in the house for him to crack. Arriving at 12 Grimmauld Place had been like resurfacing from under water. A breath of very much needed fresh air after such a long time of suffocation. He had immediately fell in love with the silence and isolation that the place offered. He had moved into Sirius’s old room, crashing onto the bed and sleeping for the rest of the day. When he woke up the silence was unnerving. Looking around the pure darkness pouring into the room, he assumed it must be pretty late.
Draco was very suspicious of her still, but didn’t think that Pansy was able to do all of this by herself so he brushed it off. Not only did she have to worry about the Potter Plot, she had to worry about Chris. Draco had been pushing him away and she could tell that the other was getting a bit irritated by Draco’s push and pull. As much as Pansy had tried to break him of that Draco was still battling himself.

Draco shrugged. “Fine. I mean I don’t see why it’s such a big deal-“ He trailed off, his mouth falling open.  Granger and the Weaslette were walking towards them. Granger and the Weaslette were in Muggle Camden. They were walking up to them like it was the most natural thing in the world. He closed his eyes tightly, counting to three in his head before opening them again. Nope, still walking towards them.
Harry caught sight of the blond as he sipped his coffee and gave him a smile. “Morning.” He greeted.
James gave him a smile, pulling him into a tight hug. “Thanks.. I’m sorry too, Mate.” He said as Sirius gave a laugh, hugging him back.
“It’s like he doesn’t even register what is going on around him. Like he just isn’t there, and that scares me.” Hermione shifted, uncrossing her legs again. “I don’t know what to do.”
Harry frowned. "You've been at the bottom only surviving. You decide who you are now, no one else." He said sternly, taking Draco's face in his hand. "I'm with you through everything. It doesn't matter to me. I'm tired. I'm so tired. And summer isn't going to stop just because school started. I'm here. I'm not going anywhere." He paused, placing his forehead against the blond's.
Hey guys! Sorry it's taking me this long to get a new chapter out! My job just went into off season and I have a week before school starts, so I'm trying to get everything updated during this week I have off! I still in complete love with this story. I really am.
Ginny jumped down, dusting off her jeans before turning around and jumping. “Shit Harry!” She hissed, placing her hand over her heart. “Why must you always do that?” She hit him with a frown. Draco snickered, his sentiments exactly.
Harry chuckled before looking back at the picture. He scrolled up, making it his lock screen before locking his phone. “Okay, tell me this story and I’ll buy drinks.”
"Welcome back! I can see that many of our former 7th years have accepted my invitation back. For those of you who don't know, because of the recent events a few months ago involving the Battle of Hogwarts, many of our 7th years were not able to finish their last year and graduate like so many of their peers before them.  They have been invited back as 8th years to finish their last year. To limit the disruption to our normal years and operations, these 8th years will have their own facilities and will not be placed back into their original houses. They are free to participate in their house's activities and to wear their house colors however." She paused and looked around before taking out a roll of parchment. "Each student will be paired with another 8th year student to share a dorm and a common room together. The students have been picked and placed together by the sorting hat and are as follows. " She opened the parchment and started to read off names.
Harry slapped his hand away from him. “If I thought that I would have let the Wizengamot sentence you.” He snapped, reaching out and grabbing his left wrist. He pulled it up, looking at the mark.
"Harry..." He pushed his bangs back again, holding them up as he looked down at him. "It's fine... I have a feeling you have been bottling everything up. Pff Gryffindors.." He said with a smirk.
"Don't.." Harry repeated. "I can't... even to begin to understand it or explain it but I haven't sleep as well as I did at your house and at Andromeda's..." He confessed.
“It’s impervious to any magic. I’ve tried.” He shrugged, finishing up her nails and letting her hand go. He closed up the polish and was silence for a good bit. “Thanks Pansy.”
He wiped the blood from his lip, fixing his glasses only to find Draco staring at him fearfully. He gave a chuckle, “You know for a pureblood you don’t hit that bad.” He smirked.
“It’s okay Harry… I’m sorry, I forgot.” She said, biting her lip. “Come on!” She said with a smile, offering her hand. He gave her a fake smile, taking it after a bit.
Dean chuckled. "Hey, you saved my boyfriend, I thought I would return the favor." He told Harry, who flushed. "Draco isn't my boyfriend."
Draco woke the next morning to something sharp stabbing him in the neck. He blinked awake only to find Harry gone and a journal stabbing him from under his pillow. He pulled it out, looking it over. It must have been what Harry had been reading, he thought as he opened it up and thumbed through the pages. He froze when he realized what it was before getting pulled in to read it.
“Draco, my boy.” Lucius grinned. “Well done. I knew that you would do everything to redeem the Malfoy name. We need to get back into the Ministry and bribe our way back to the top. To get our home and our influence back. Who is it that you have under your thumb?” He asked him, a bit excited.
The beginning part, like the first three paragraphs,  of this chapter is pretty heavy. It deals with a lot of stuff. There are mentions of self-harm. The act of self harm is fully detailed. Draco has an episode where he dissociates. Please read with this in mind. This story is rated Mature for a reason and has been tagged as such for this and other chapters.
Harry actually felt sorry for the other. He moved into the room as Draco buried his face into blue hair. “I’ve shushed and I’ve cooed and I’ve even try to sing in the exact voice of Ringo. Now all I have left is to hope that a dingo will sneak in and rip off your fat bitching head…*” He whispered, just giving up.
"Like you did?" Harry asked. "I'm not trying to cover something up. I am proudly making a statement."
“Have it at my place.” She smirked. “I can talk Draco into it. Especially after what happened this morning.” She muttered, mostly to herself.
Harry had just opened a new bottle of bourbon, getting ready to unscrew the top and pour a glass to try to drink himself to sleep when he heard a knock at his door. He checked the time on his mobile, before moving upstairs to answer the door.
Even though the song is Backstreet boys in the scene, only for the sake of time era continuity,  I modeled  it around the much slower and extremely amazing acoustic cover that was done by Sleeping at Last. It is just so heart breaking and really fits the story and the scenes. So please check it out!
“Bloody hell Ginny. Why Parkinson?” Ron asked her. Ginny glared at him. “What is wrong with Pansy? She’s nice,” Ron snorted at this, “ She treats me like a princess, and she hasn’t once pushed anything on me.” She growled. “Actually, we aren’t even dating. She hasn’t asked me out.”
Pansy turned to Ginny. “Is he always like that?” She asked her. “Sometimes, when he has his mind made up on something.”
“Saute means.. you turn the heat down and you let it cook for a bit.” Harry wheezed, walking into the kitchen and taking the spoon from Draco and moving to the skillet. Draco moved to check on the rest of the things and Pansy moved to set the table.
Hermione rolled her eyes at that. “So I think I might be able to help you… I have sort of a plan in mind. But it requires not just us, but another outside force.”
“What in Merlin’s name is Buffy the Vampire Slayer?” He asked as he moved to make coffee. He was all too aware of the fact that he was standing in front of Potter in nothing but pants and his tshirt, like some weird morning after a shag thing.
Chris followed him back, he motioned to the chair before getting on his gloves and setting up his station. "So, what I am inking?" He asked again as he placed a cassette into the boombox and a song  from Rage against the machine started playing.
"Not to mention, me and Potter are just friends. Which we will only ever be." He said, not realizing he had let that slip in his bitterness and irritation.  Ron stared at him before shaking his head. "Harry and you aren't friends. He's just doing this because of pity." He told the blond as Harry walked in with a frown. "Some weird sense of wanting to save everyone. Just like my sister. He can't save everyone. Some people just need to be forgotten." He growled. "Your money can't buy friendships anymore, Malfoy."
"No, sorry.." He looked down at his hands before taking a breath and looking back up at the blond. "Look I'm sorry about the kiss, I didn't mean to make everything uncomfortable for you because you aren't gay." He said, making Draco jerk to him.
“Your parents..” She said but Draco held up a hand to silence her. His face was furious as he got out the second container. He frowned, looking down at it. “I know someone who will help me.” The venom in his voice undeniable.
"No.. it's just I'm not use to it. Even Pansy, she doesn't." He trailed off. Harry nodded in understanding. "It has no power anymore. Just a bit of ink, just like this is just a scar now." Harry told him, sounding and looking exhausted.
He shook his head of his thoughts before sighing. “I think my mother thinks I’m gay.” He told her with a frown.
She rolled her eyes. “We are not dating, we just have a mutual understanding and a somewhat mutual attraction because both of our ex-boyfriends are pig-headed gits.” She told him. “We all did things we regret during the war, Draco. Even me and it took a lot for me to seek help. I still haven’t forgiven myself for the way I treated you and other people. I was scared…” She admitted.
Harry was the first to break the silence. “Do you want to talk about what happened earlier?” He asked softly.
Seamus laughed. “Officially, during the Battle.” He said before Dean kicked him under the table. He missed completely, hitting Harry instead.
“I know.” Harry said, splashing him. “Sod off, prat!” Draco yelled, splashing him back. “You better be glad Pansy has my mobile or you would be dead.”
“Mum is out shopping, along with Dad. Charlie is out with Oliver, I think they are doing one of their not date things. Bill is at home with Fleur. She hasn’t really been feeling well lately. Mum’s got it in her head that she’s pregnant and Fleur is hiding from her.” George explained, smirking. “I’m too young to be an uncle.”
"Move it, you birds!" Dean muttered, shoving through the crowd with Seamus and shutting the door behind them. The compartment was starting to get cramped now. "Just Harry's fan club outside and also it's pretty much open season on Malfoy." Seamus explained.
Everyone seemed reluctantly to continue the previous conversation. “Don’t stop on my account.” Draco said with a smirk. “I know I look fit but please try not to drool. Finnigan .” He pointed his cigarette at the other, making him turn red and Dean burst out in laughter. That seem to break the ice and everyone went back to talking.
Ron huffed, seeming to still be angry but knew that he couldn’t dissuade his best friend. “Fine, mate. I’m just worried about you… and Ginny.. I don’t like this..” He muttered.
“This is terrible.” Draco asked, watching a bit more. “Why is she doing that?” He asked, becoming completely absorbed in the show.  Harry smirked, switching between watching the show and watching the blond. “Angel is a vampire.”
“Weird, she told me that she was going out today and that she wouldn’t be home at all.” He knitted his eyebrows.
He made his way to the bathroom, looking his face over in the mirror. He had a busted lip and a nice lovely dark bruise sprouting over his cheek bone. He washed up before padding down to the kitchen.  He stopped dead in his tracks when he saw Andromeda sitting at the table, drinking coffee and reading the paper. He turned and made his way back up the stairs as quiet as he could be. He was on his second step when she called out to him.
It was a picture of very bright vibrant flower blossoms that were curling around a stem that was made out of a previous tattoo. “Daffodils for rebirth and new beginnings. Gladiolus for strength of character. White Heather Lavender for protection and wishes come true. Blue Iris for hope. Orange Lily for passion.” She explained. “We can play with it a bit if you don’t-“
“I don’t know..  There has never been anything like this in the history of all of Hogwarts.” Hermione gushed, looking at him in shock.
"How can someone be that important indeed." Draco muttered, closing his eyes and falling asleep in moments just listening to Harry's breathing.
“Yes, Mrs. Malfoy!” She chirped as Draco rolled his eyes. The bedroom door closed and Pansy turned to look at him.
Pansy looked over her message before sitting up straight, eyes wide. “Well that’s not anything new.” She muttered, typing out the address for Granger to forward. This was actually working out a lot better than she thought it would back at the concert. Of course Draco had been extremely upset with her at first, but she had been able to pushed it off like none of it was her fault. After the garage, she had been able to get Andromeda to apologize about not remembering that she gave Potter the day off.  She was able to write off the café incident as she went with Ginny and Granger to it a few weeks ago and wanted Draco to try it. Apparently, Granger had the same idea with Potter, she told Draco with a chuckle.
The rest of George’s letter was a lot more interesting. According to George, Charlie was kind of dating but not dating Oliver Wood of all people. Harry had always wondered what had happened to his old Quidditch captain. Though Harry was confused on how someone could date but not date someone,  George went into an explanation of that. They did date things like dinner, movies, coffee and gifts; however, they didn’t do date things like kissing, shagging, etc. It confused both George and Harry greatly. The last two pages were just about how amazing Romania was and how Harry should visit, now that he was done saving the world and what not.
Draco glared at him, trying to hide his arm but before he could, Harry grabbed his wrist. He placed the rag over the wound holding it down in place. Draco hissed, glaring up at the other. “What the bloody hell do you think you are doing?”
Ron thought it over and sighed. “Yeah, ‘mione is super serious about this party. It’s like it’s the most important thing in the world.”
“I was wondering if you could help me by cleaning up the guest apartment. I’ve tried to do it but I really can’t with work and Teddy. Plus, I think those things would mean more to you than me.” She looked up at him, holding his gaze.
“I don’t know honestly… I haven’t been in Wizarding London since the Trials. I haven’t wanted to be..” He admitted, running his fingers through Teddy’s hair.
“Maybe because you were the one that actually stood up to the Dark Lord when all hope was lost?” She shrugged.
He sat up quickly when he heard the floorboards outside his door creak. The door slowly opened and he brandished his wand, breath coming out in quick pants. It took a moment for the panic to subside when he realized it was Draco and he laid back down rubbing his face. The blond didn't say anything as he moved quietly into the room stopping at the bed hesitantly. He wrapped his arm around his middle before turning on his heel and hurrying back to the door.
“Gladly. So do I.” He turned around and started to walk off, trying to be elegant with his proud strut and his head held high, like he had done in school but it didn’t really work with trainers and jeans. He tripped over his own feet, hearing a snigger of barely concealed laughter behind him.
He closed his eyes, laying there on the floor breathing slowly. The Gryffindor growled at him. "How can you come back here? Acting like nothing happened? With him?!" He asked as Draco felt what was the equivalent of a kick to his ribs. Draco bit his lip hard to keep from making a sound as he lay there. There wasn't much he could do. If he fought back, he would be arrested. Not even Harry would be able to get him out of that. He was wandless, so he couldn't defend himself. Even if he defended himself the muggle way, he was not match to someone with a wand.
“Pretty much the same.” She said, turning around and leaning against the counter to face him. “I’ve been worried about you, to be honest. It’s hard to deal.. when you lose everything but we must go on.” She said, her eyes pointedly going to Harry’s hands. He pulled the sleeves of his flannel down with his thumbs. Her eyes moved back up to his face. “We must go on for him.” She motioned to Teddy. “If nothing else.”
“Like she would know what they were if she saw them.” He rolled his eyes. “She put my mobile in the ice box and then almost had a break down when it started to ring.”
“I can’t believe this. They gave us more time on our probation because of him?!” He sputtered, spilling his drink a bit in his outrage.
He frowned, pulling the rest from the box, looking them over.  The front of each one was dated in Remus’s perfect handwriting. He grabbed a random one and opened it to the last page that was written. It was dated May of that year.
She had something that he would never have ever again. A chance. A chance to get through this. A chance to redeem herself. She was dating the Chosen One’s ex and was invited back to Hogwarts and outings with the Golden Trio.  Probably the only Slytherin that had been. He was not going to let her waste away with him in this muggle hell.  He had Andy and Potter…
“Do you have someone?” He asked before Dean shushed him. “You can’t believe everything in the papers.”
“STOP IT!” Remus screamed, making everyone freeze. He stood up from the couch, hugging his journal tight to his chest. “Just stop it alright! I can’t take this anymore!” He growled, glaring at the two. “Stop pushing him to ‘get over’ her. Love takes time. You can’t just change how you feel about someone over night.” He turned to Sirius. “Or at least the rest of us can’t. We love with all of our hearts one person that is special to us. James and me are the same in that. We don’t fall easy and when we do, we give it our everything, there is no changing it. No matter how ‘hopeless’ it seems or the knowledge that we may only ever be friends. It doesn’t stop us. We just want to be close to that person, no matter what and we want them to be happy no matter what or with who!” He ranted in pure venom.
The next part of the house to get his wrath was the tapestry in the parlour. It came to an end like the portrait and opened up the parlour to one of the many bedrooms. He kind of liked that look. He dismantled the rest of the wall, vanishing the debris with his wand. He moved back downstairs to the foyer, finishing the rest of the wall as well and vanishing the debris.
“Pans, are you ready yet?” Draco asked from where he was hanging out of his bedroom window. He took a long drag from the cigarette, flicking ash. He looked at his arm, running his fingertips lightly over his tattoo. It had been almost a month since he had done it. Every night since, he had gone out with Pansy, drinking and dancing. The fresh air was freeing and the anonymity of all the muggle places was like an addiction. It made Draco feel alive for the first time in his life.
It had been really late when he had finally finished fixing Malfoy’s stove. No one had come downstairs since the blond had stormed off. He had looked through their fridge before making a nice breakfast that the others could heat up in the morning. He left a list of instructions for the two on top of the Tupperware, before cleaning up and walking out. He made sure he locked the door behind him before rushing home.  Malfoy actually only lived a little over two miles from him, so it was a fairly easy and quick walk.  When he arrived home, he shrugged out of his jacket and past out in his bed without much help.
“What is it?” He asked her as he lit a cigarette, taking a deep drag. She waved the smoke away from her face impatiently. “I invited my friend.”
"I would love to, but I'm actually not dressed and I was going to have breakfast with Hermione and Ron."  He told them. At this point it was tradition and it was the first time they had been in separate dormitories.
Which was why they had dated for a few years before Draco had come out to her, in a strangled voice with retched sobs. She had known it for a while but she didn’t tell him that. She had talked him through it, offering to be his beard for the next few years while they were at Hogwarts. When his father started to ride him about producing an heir, Pansy had even promised to marry him in hopes that Lucius would either give up on the idea or die.  After the war, when they were given a second chance, Pansy refused to let him be like that anymore. Not many people were given second chances. Most of their friends were dead or in Azkaban, or just didn’t want to associate with them anymore. Draco was all she had left. Without him, she was alone in a world that hated her. Which was one of the reasons she had made amends with Ginny and Granger. Even though the war was over, her and Draco were still in survival mode. They were both trying everything and anything to keep from drowning. And over her dead body would she let her best friend drown. So she did the one thing she could, reaching out to the only person that could possibly understand what Draco was feeling. A deal with the devil. A calculated gamble. Anything to help him. Anything.
"Pansy is not officially dating your sister because the Weaslette doesn't want to upset you." He chuckled as Ron looked away at that. "Dating a big bad Slytherin will definitely twist  Mummie and big brother's knickers."
“I’ve had one beer. Sit down, I’ll make something.” He told him as he tucked Teddy in, kissing his cheek before going back into the kitchen.
“I was thinking about getting a tattoo like yours.” Harry said after a bit, covering the skillet with a lid and letting it cook. Draco looked up at him. “You want a tattoo?” He asked him.
“Granger was having a problem trying to find a place to have his party. Potter had already invited us, so I thought it wouldn’t matter if we had the party here. Your parents aren’t here, it would be nice to see people again….and-“ She flittered around to find another reason to explain her decision.
I hope the 19 pages that I got carried away writing is enough to make up for the long gap between updates. There is a lot of time and scene changes as this is a VERY action packed chapter. I hope everyone loves it!
Dean rolled his eyes before Luna turned to Hermione and the conversation moved onto the Quibbler and how it had been doing. The three new guests ended up sitting in the floor of the compartment and was joined by Neville, Ginny and Pansy not long after. Draco had actually drifted off to sleep after a bit and Harry gently woke him right before they got to Hogsmeade to change. Everyone had left to give them some privacy and Harry had closed the blind.
“Why are you helping me? I never asked for this, and you don’t owe me anything at all.” He paused. “What I did during the battle… I did for selfish reasons.” He told him. “So you don’t have to feel bad for just leaving.”
They sat in silence for a while before the sound of tapping was heard. They looked up to see an owl tapping on the window with a letter in its beck. Pansy moved to it, opening up the window and retrieving the letter. Once it was done with its job, the owl flew off. She looked at name, frowning before turning it over. Draco got up moving over to her curious.
“Don’t. I don’t care what they are saying, I can handle it. Remember they said I was a liar and just attention seeking for like two years. I can handle this. Also, they were printing that me and Draco were having a secret love affair in yesterday’s issue.” He chuckled. “I’m going to have call you back.”
“I.. I don’t know..” He admitted, pulling the crumpled letter out of his pocket and handing it over to her. She took it, smoothing it out on the coffee table before reading it over. She was silent for a bit before nodding. “This is great Harry..” She smiled at him before looking down at the carelessness the letter had be treated with. “But you don’t think so…”
“That’s why you asked me to clean the apartment.” He said, closing the journal and hugging it to his chest.
*The lullaby that Draco sings to Teddy is Lullaby by Tim Minchin. He is great and so hilarious. I recommend you guys watch his performance of this song.
“I could…” Harry begin to say but the blond cut him off. “I can’t.” He wished he could just use magic to make the pain go away.
She glared at him. “I have a guess and it rhymes with Hotter.” She sighed. “My mum was talking about him actually this morning.”
Ginny smiled, shaking her head a bit. “Harry is going through a lot of shit. We talked about some of it after the trial, the night he came to the Burrow.” She told Hermione. “He’s just tired and scared. He just wants to be left alone. The kind of alone that isn’t alone though, because being alone with your thoughts is dangerous. I should know that. And I.. I wasn’t the right person for that.. for him. I knew that, even before the battle, but more so after. I couldn’t be the person he needed. Because I couldn’t be anything but gentle with him, because I cared too much.” She sighed. “We all need that special something or someone to help heal. He wasn’t mine and I wasn’t his.”
