“Thank you,” Draco said, holding his hands out as if he had proven something.
“No, I actually do, back at Malfoy Man--”
“Yeah,” Harry said. “I’m serious.”
There was a pregnant pause around the room.
She rolled her eyes. “What do you think, Jadia?” she asked Harry. “I think it looks cursed to me. And you’re the expert.”
Suddenly embarrassed, he said, “Feels weird now to skirt around your first name. Feels rude.”
“Oh good,” Ginny said. “I need a bloody drink.”
“Alright,” Ron said, with renewed vigor. “We good? We ready?”
Harry was overcome with an emotion he couldn’t name. He took Draco’s face with both hands and kissed him, hard. Draco melted back into the kiss, and for a long moment they sat there, utterly consumed with each other.
When Harry looked up again, Luna’s eyes were as wide as saucers, and she had her hands over her mouth in shock. “Harry, I’m so sorry. I thought he knew…”
“There are no mimics on this road,” Ron said.
For a second, the gang was silent. Then, they all spoke at once:
Ron checked something in his book. “You healed the burns, but some scarring remains.” Luna sat back, satisfied with herself.
“Big badgers. Large as a man, they were.”
That was all Harry could think as he stood on the front stoop of Ron and Hermione’s little house. He bounced his wand against his knee with one hand and rubbed the back of his neck with the other.
“Nice to see you too, Granger,” Draco groused. He shrugged. “Hello, all.”
“Knew I’m transgender,” Harry said through gritted teeth.
“Badgers?” Several people asked at once.
“The word is transgender,” Harry snapped. “Whatever word you were about to say, don’t. I’m trans.”
They separated. Harry coughed. “We’re fine,” he said. “We’re coming out.”
Draco wrinkled his nose. “Fine.” He cleared his throat, and said, only slightly more naturally, “I am injured. Help me. Please.”
“That makes no sense,” Neville pointed out, again.
“I don’t know what that means,” Draco said.
“Yeah.”
“Are you going to say anything?” Harry asked.
“Stop being so overdramatic,” Harry said, rolling his eyes. He led Draco to the door, hand in hand. Before he opened the door, he added, quickly, “And, uhh, I should tell you. It’s not just Ron and Hermione in there.”
So maybe it would take less convincing than Harry thought.
Draco looked alarmed at the reality of having to answer a question. “I, uhh. Badgers.”
“I want him to be very strong and powerful,” Draco said, almost through gritted teeth. “And that’s it. That’s my character.”
“I never was a girl,” Harry said. “Not really. Not where it counts.”
Harry so didn’t want to have this conversation in Ron and Hermione’s guest room. He sat on the bed, rubbing his face.
“Yeah, they bought it about--”
“Yes!” Several people cried at once.
“‘Course I do,” Draco said. “Why. Do you not want to date me?”
Harry started. “What’d you say?”
“Do I say yes,” Draco said, bewildered.
Harry blinked. “You remember that?”
“How else am I supposed to get them to do what I want?” Draco said impatiently.
“Wait,” Draco said. “What does that mean? Transition?”
The others were less than thrilled.
“I like him,” Luna said happily. “Canopus seems very nice.”
Draco sighed.
crisps!”
“Is this you having a laugh?”
“Are you serious?” Neville asked.
“I think we all do,” Hermione snarked.
Draco looked bewildered. “Transgender? What, you’re some kind of…”
“Oh, they still think I’m a butch lesbian,” Harry said, rolling his eyes. “They never let me out of girls’ clothes growing up. It wasn’t until Hogwarts I got to be who I really was.”
“Yeah, I am,” Harry said, trying to keep ice from creeping into his voice.
Draco grabbed Harry by the T-shirt and pulled him in for a kiss. Harry, surprised but not displeased, kissed him back. When they finally separated, Harry arched an eyebrow at him.
“I say we leave him for the blast-ended skrewts,” Ginny said, maliciously.
“Canopus Black,” Ginny said, her voice dripping with venom. “Very inventive. Truly.”
So not the same thing. But ... he was trying. Draco sat beside Harry, and Harry put his head on his shoulder. They sat there for a moment, hearing the sounds of crows cry outside the window in the early night.
“This whole time that I’ve known you, then,” Draco said. “Even that day at Madam Malkin’s…”
“I am cooperating,” Draco snapped.
“I didn’t want to tell you this way!” Harry cried, running his hands through his shaggy hair. “I wanted...I had a plan. I had a process.”
“Are there any more crisps?” Luna asked Hermione.
“Hold up--” Ron said, as the others clamored in anger.
“Little funny, don’t you think? A grown man playing a girl?”
Draco Malfoy exited the Knight Bus with none of his typical swagger. He was wearing Muggle clothes: a black sweater and black jeans and shiny black shoes. He looked ... nervous. And a little disgusted -- he dusted off his spotless sweater with one hand.
So Harry sat on the stoop, waiting for Draco to arrive. Because, if one hadn’t guessed by now, Draco was the secret boyfriend. Draco, his childhood enemy. His childhood enemy who didn’t even know…
Draco was late.
Harry put his hands up in compliance. Draco looked the most uncomfortable Harry had ever seen him.
Draco gave Harry a look that surprised him. “Of course I do. I remember what an arse I was. Blood purity this and that.”
If he could have brought his wand out and shut her mouth then, he would have.
“Draco, can you just…” Harry massaged his closed eyes beneath his glasses. “Please. Cooperate.”
“There are no blast-ended skrewts in DnD,” Ron said.
“You owe me a galleon.”
The group nodded. Draco scowled.
“How did you become injured?” Luna asked, actually progressing the game.
“Bloody hell, mate.”
“Is this why you never wanted to sleep with me?” There was a surprising amount of vulnerability in Draco’s voice. “I always thought … there was something wrong.”
“Roll three d8s,” Ron said.
“Well, Harry is, anyway,” Draco snarked.
“This game makes no sense.”
“You settle at a table,” Ron said, “and count your spoils from the latest dungeon.”
They came out of the room hand-in-hand, and Harry’s friends all looked at him expectantly.
“Well,” Ron said, sighing and running a hand through his red hair. He looked around at everyone. “Are we playing or not?”
He could hear bursts of talking as soon as he closed the door behind them.
“Oh, do you, Canopus,” Hermione said without looking at him.
“No,” Draco said. There was a surprising fierceness in his eyes. “Don’t talk down to me. I’m not stupid. Tell me how this works, for real. You’re transgender, fine. I don’t know … I mean, my father told stories about lads at work, but … I don’t know how that works.”
“I thought I was a girl, growing up.” Harry said wearily. “‘Harry’ isn’t the name I was born with. When I got to Hogwarts, I had a long conversation with McGonagall. She could tell I wasn’t happy with how
“You alright?” he asked.
“I don’t know it.”
“Wait,” Draco said, beginning to panic, “exactly how many--”
This was starting to threaten the fine lines of Harry and Draco’s already thinly-held-together relationship.
Harry reached for another crisp. “Please don’t.” He handed the bowl to Draco, who wrinkled his nose but otherwise took one.
“Guess the Lovegood girl blurting it out is as good a moment as we get,” Draco said, chuckling. “Things never seem to go your way, Harry.”
“We’ve spoken dozens of times, how do you not know my name--”
When the Knight Bus rolled around, Harry was both thankful and incredibly nervous. Truth be told, he was half-hoping that Draco wouldn’t show up.
“So,” Draco said, very slowly. “You were born a girl.”
“Draco,” Harry said. They had been dating for six months, and he still couldn’t get Draco to call him by his first name.
“This is your mysterious boyfriend?” Hermione said incredulously. “Him?”
“Is he putting on an accent?” Neville asked.
In their last session, the crew had managed to gather rubies and gold, wealth that they hadn’t yet managed to get their hands on in this questline. But most curious of all was a circlet, inset with aquamarine.
Finally, there was a knock on the door. “You two alright?” Hermione’s voice came in through the crack.
“You can’t just threaten us,” Ginny said.
Here we go.
“So…” Ginny said. “We good?”
“Hold on, why am I injured? And what’s a cloaker?” Draco asked.
Harry laced his fingers in Draco’s. “‘Course I do. For some stupid reason.”
There was an expectant pause, and Harry knew why.
“We haven’t even started playing yet,” Ron said. “Now will you please finish making your character.”
Harry loved Luna to bits.
“What’s your name, stranger?” Neville asked.
“It means you can’t go threatening random people,” Ginny said.
“Yeah, in the cupboard.”
“OK.” Ron cleared his throat and cracked his knuckles in preparation. There was a Dungeon Master screen in front of him, a custom wooden one that Harry had etched Ron’s name into for last Christmas. “So after the fight with the cloaker, you’re all exhausted and spent. You travel down the long and weary road, looking for someplace to rest. You come across an injured traveler on the road, a person with--” He checked Draco’s character sheet and sighed. “With platinum blond hair and a thin frame.”
“I knew it.”
Draco waved all that away. “But a girl.”
“The curtains are closed.”
“Can we talk in private?” Harry got to his feet in one, loud motion and grabbed Draco’s arm to drag him into the spare room.
I looked, how I presented myself. I asked her if I could go by Harry, if I could wear the boys’ robes. I also asked her not to tell anyone.”
They had never had a fight before.
“Can we start now,” Ron said through his hands.
Draco was late. Draco was late, and this was all a mistake, and Harry was going to look like such an arse in front of his friends, and--
“You can ask your other question, by the way.” Harry had to go over this with Ginny. It was like a bandaid then, quick but relatively harmless.
“So let me get this straight,” Draco said slowly. “We, a group of wizards, are going to pretend to be wizards in a fantasy game that takes place in the MIddle Ages. For fun.”
“Yes, fine, let’s get on with it,” Draco said.
Draco nodded. “Your aunt and uncle…”
There was silence. Everyone turned to Draco. He blinked. “Oh, I talk now?”
“Ah.” He cleared his throat, then said, too loudly and too stiffly, “I am injured and I need help. Help me, or I’ll make you pay.”
Hermione spoke as she was tying her bushy hair back in a bun, held in place with her wand, “I say we leave him for the mimics.”
“As we explained four times, yes,” Hermione said wearily.
“Canopus,” Draco said. “Canopus Black. It’s a very old name, I’ll have you know, and it’s in my family, and it’s a very respectable name--”
“Nice to meet you, Canopus,” Harry said, just then realizing the game might go smoother if he did most of the talking to Draco. He raised his head off his papers. “The road is long and full of dangers. You’re safer with us.”
“So like I was saying,” Ron said, pretending the aforementioned didn’t happen. “You run across a stranger, injured. He looks up at you, and speaks.”
“Do you still want to date me, now?” Harry asked wearily. He felt as if he had just run a marathon. Coming out to Hermione and Ron was a wholly different ordeal.
“Burns,” Draco said severely. “All over my body.”
“He doesn’t know?” Ron hissed at Harry’s side.
“Wait.” Draco snorted. “Jadia?” Is Potter playing a girl?”
Hermione made a subtle motion under the table. Harry almost missed it. But Draco worked his mouth uselessly -- it was glued shut. He gave Hermione two fingers in response, before undoing the spell on his own.
“So where were we?”
Draco caught that. “Doesn’t know what?”
“It’s terrifically inventive, really, if you think about it for more than two moments, younger Weasley,” Draco said flippantly. “So my character, Canopus, is a human sorcerer, who comes from a very powerful magical family. Points in charisma and strength--”
Well, not since school, anyway.
Draco nodded. “Your whole life, then, has been people telling you what you are.” He snorted. “I know what that feels like.”
“Well, you have one now,” Ron said, seemingly desperate to continue the game.
Draco twisted a ring on his finger, a green and silver one, over and over.
“Potter,” Draco said. “Why is everyone staring at me.”
“You owe me four galleons.”
“Right,” Draco said. “So, my character…”
The temperature in the room dropped 30 degrees. Harry crossed his arms on the desk and put his head on top.
“What’s the game?” Draco asked.
Harry, who was happily chomping on sour cream and onion crisps, looked from Draco to his friends and then to Draco again. “You alright?” he asked Draco quietly.
“Harry…”
Harry wasn’t sure whether he wanted to smack him or kiss him again.
He walks up to his attic, settles under the Park sky, and sits on the floor unmoving until Tempus lets him know it’s gone midnight.
Harry snorts and walks back over to the owl that's still sitting in his kitchen, waiting for a response. It nuzzles his hand a bit, and he finds himself feeling sorry for the bird. Anything that belongs to Draco Malfoy must need all the love and attention it can get, since there’s no chance it gets any from Malfoy himself. Harry pets the owl, then shoos it out the window. He throws the letter on a side table and doesn’t make an effort to reply.
"Excuse me?"
"Because it's not safe," Harry says truthfully. Nowhere other than this house is safe from the pain, or the prejudices, or the
, the cupboard puts in, and Harry hurries to shut it. He taps to it a clear message not to say anything, and the cupboard stays closed, although obviously unhappy.
"Irish," he observes, as Harry hands him a cup that's more firewhiskey than coffee.
“’M not
Surprised by Malfoy’s actual sense of humour, Harry finds his lips quirking and says, "Yeah, I'll sleep tonight now, Malfoy."
*****
"You're a terrible show-off.”
"If it's self-inflicted then I'm tempted to continue yelling," she says, louder than necessary. Harry scowls.
"You seriously don't go outside? At all?"
“Yes, you have. Why is that, do you think?”
"Stop that, it's weird!" Malfoy grimaces. Harry, finding that he rather likes the way emotions play out over Malfoy’s face, flashes him a huge grin and relishes in the surprised look.
"Prat," Draco retorts.
Some hours later, Harry is glaring at the Manor lawn with trepidation.
“Harry,” Hermione says after a moment of thoughtfully narrowed eyes, “You’ve been smiling so much today.”
Ron stands in the doorway open-mouthed.
"Fuckface?" Draco says. "There's no need for that."
Smiling at the memory, Harry says, "Aha. Did it once. The carpet was sticky for a week afterwards."
Hermione purposefully frowns at the coffee cup in Harry's hand, shifting on the soft carpet underneath the Park sky.
"Thank you, for last night." Draco says after a tense pause, "For the Gala, I mean. I really appreciate it."
As if the neighbours need more reasons to talk. As if the reporters need to show him attention once again, over
"Why?"
Harry kisses him back, running a hand over Draco’s arm. “Good. We’re still having a lot of sex before I go back outside.”
"Malfoy," Harry growls, trying his hardest to put all his anger into that one little word.
"Nothing much," Draco mutters, and then, after a pause, "You could probably slope off now if you wanted, by the way. The dancing's going to start soon, and I suspect you'd hate to not miss that."
"Why the fuck do you care?" Harry snaps, not wanting an answer, just needing Malfoy to
"My arse," Harry snorts. "I'll ask Ginny for some more of those magazines, shall I?"
*****
Harry waits for the punch line. It doesn’t come.
Draco pours him more alcohol. Harry looks into the other man's face, and decides that it is a much more beautiful view than the one above them.
“Er,” Draco starts, and then, taking a deep breath, “I told President Cholmondely that you’d be coming. To the Gala, that is.”
"Why would it?"
to think, let alone what he's actually thinking.
"In a minute, Malfoy," Harry murmurs, closing his eyes and resting his head against the cabinet behind him. On the one hand, he’s already told Malfoy about dying. He has made the leap and shared that fact, and now he might as well go into it further. It might even be gratifying; Hermione is always telling Harry there’s scientific proof that talking about things makes people feel better.
"Then stop pretending everything's fine!" Malfoy says, rising to his feet. "People died. Let's talk about that, shall we?"
look.
Draco seems to understand, because in a matter of seconds he’s yanked his waistband down. Their eye contact never breaks. Draco pulls at the both of them, sucking Harry’s cock with what Harry can only describe as perfection.
"Oh, fucking hell, 'Mione, I thought you were joking," Harry says, voice raspy from shock. He watches as Malfoy turns and look at him, watches his grey eyes go wide and his pale hand reach for his wand before Malfoy manages to pull himself together.
"You know I haven't," Harry snaps, annoyed that she would bring that up. It should have been enough to go to the Gala, he doesn't need to hear all about it, too.
"Fine, so I don't!" Malfoy practically shouts. "How is anyone supposed to help you if you don't fucking tell them? How do you expect me to—"
Holding a cup out to him, Harry takes a moment to study Malfoy; he’s still wearing expensive and slightly elaborate clothes, Harry notes, but with less of an air of superiority. Malfoy looks much better than he did at the trials: less pale and worn, more alive. The malnourished look he’d sported then, however, is still very much present. It’s a wonder if all the house-elves he must have aren’t feeding him properly.
Draco snorts, and Harry turns to shoot him a warning glance; there’s no point, though, because Draco knows how important it is for Harry to be here—he’s the one that dragged Harry here in the first place—and he isn’t going to ruin it. And Harry feels a burst of love and fondness and affection in his chest, and he feels calm when he looks back at Ron.
“Your cup." Harry gestures to it. "Can't you hold your cup like a normal human being?"
"I'm sure," Malfoy sneers, distaste for Ron showing through clearly. "So, your only social interaction is with Granger and a crack team of Weasels? No wonder you're turning into such a misanthrope."
Harry can understand still being afraid, although not of Voldemort.
"Fuck off, Malfoy," Harry says, and Malfoy glares back. "I don't want to be your project, so just stop it."
Harry thinks of Malfoy, and how he doesn't treat Harry like he's a war victim. Malfoy treats Harry like he's a person. An annoying person with crows-nest hair that won’t do something Malfoy considers to be simple, but then, that's a better opinion than Harry would have ever thought he'd get. Harry thinks that years ago, if someone had ever told him he would one day spend hours in Malfoy’s company without either of them throwing a hex, he’d have laughed in their face.
“Not terrified,” He replies grudgingly.
The wards come down, and Harry charges through the gates, hastily putting them back up after he gets onto the grounds.
"It doesn't matter," Draco interrupts.
"No, not all right! I'm not coming. I can't!"
Harry Apparates outside Malfoy Manor, and the distorted feeling from that, in conjunction with the pouring rain, makes him stumble and fall over.
"Harry?"
is the soft, calming nothingness of the train station.
"Self-pity?" Harry asks incredulously,
Still not glancing up, Harry says quietly: "It isn't as frightening as you'd think, dying."
"Yes, him. I'm not saying it. Continue."
Feeling eyes on him, Harry tries not to smirk, but finds that he can't help it.
"Any of it. The people. The places. You can't make me," Harry scowls.
"Yeah," Harry shrugs, "Of course. But there's no grass. This is central London, remember?"
"I will not. You were happy, Harry, and I can hardly believe it myself, but it was because of him," Granger says quietly, and the amount of pity on her face makes Harry's growing anger stronger yet. "And I'm not going to watch you make yourself miserable over him when it's obvious that you both feel—"
"Fuck," Draco hisses, and when he pushes forwards, Harry almost comes apart. Gentle, needy fingers touch Harry through his clothes, and he can’t help the desperate noise that escapes him.
Malfoy hauls himself to his feet. "Why would you keep something so unpleasant?" he inquires, attempting to brush dust off his expensive trousers. Harry notes absently that it’s time to clean the kitchen. "Or is she part of your elaborate 'none shall pass' routine?"
Harry thinks, and the thought makes him strangely unhappy. However, when Malfoy finally drops his silverware looking full and pleased, Harry can’t help but feel proud of himself. He hasn’t ever seen Malfoy looks this content. It’s almost as nice as his smile.
Harry’s head goes blank. For the first time in days, there are no swarming words and building emotions and anything else unpleasant and unwanted. Instead, slowly, memories and phrases unravel in front of Harry’s eyes, and it’s like the whole world has taken a deep, deep breath.
“You’re scared to see a Weasley,” Draco concludes, and in contrast to his condescending words, a warm hand reaches out to grasp Harry’s.
"It's true, though,” Malfoy opines.
The scarf is yanked from Malfoy’s hands, and it knocks him onto his arse.
"Really?" Harry asks, intrigued. It was a long way coming, he supposes. Those people were always a bit odd.
"I certainly do not!" Malfoy replies, indignant, but Harry has his doubts. “And anyway, this isn't about owls."
Yet, here the stupid git is, knocking at his door. And knocking, and knocking, and knocking, until Harry gets so used to it that he doesn’t even hear it anymore. He re-immerses himself in a letter he’s writing to Ron—they mostly only talk by owl, these days. Ron’s too busy for much else.
The second thing he's aware of is that he isn't in his room. He isn't even in a bed, and yet there is a warm blanket covering his body.
******
"I would," Malfoy agrees. "Now come on, you were telling me about your death."
Harry raises an eyebrow—which, he notes with something akin to fear, is a quirk that he definitely picked up from Malfoy. "I'm not going to ask."
A shout of “Malfoy’s here!” comes up the stairs, and Harry rolls his eyes. It must be time for another of her elaborate schemes to get him outside. He wonders if whoever is with her will attempt to ambush him and shove him out the door. Part of him hopes so: it’s been so long since he’s gotten in a good fight.
"I think it's time you start looking for someone, Harry," Hermione says cautiously, as though she's well aware how many times they've had this conversation before, and how differently Harry reacts every time. She seems nervous that Harry is going to blow up again, as he'd done when she brought the topic up a few months back.
"What?" Harry whispers, not wanting to shatter the sweet tension that has shrouded them.
"Where's Granger today?" Draco asks, with an obvious attempt at nonchalance.
Harry doesn't bother with a response as he walks up the stairs toward his bedroom. At this point, she only said it out of habit.
"Yep. And this is the best I can do. You should know, I don't usually let anyone else come in here... except 'Mione, when she helped me with the ceiling." Harry's not exactly sure why he's telling all this, he just knows that he wants Draco to know. Ginny had stopped by for a few minutes the night before, to bring his favourite coffee, and Harry hadn’t mentioned it at all: he thought it was too personal to show her. For some reason, he only wants to share it with Draco.
Draco doesn’t even flinch at the name, and that’s how Harry knows the situation is very bad, indeed.
Draco ignores him in favour of placing his steaming coffee cup in the center of his palm and burying his nose further in the magazine.
"Yes. And I still don't like you, by the way," Harry says, because agreeing with Malfoy is weird and he wants comforting familiarity more than anything else.  After a beat, he points to the cabinet and adds, "Cups are in that cupboard, there."
"Oh, come
Until the words really sink in, and then all he feels is sadness. "How many of them left the country?"
"I know. I'm working on it, see?" Harry says, gesturing to their sticky, naked bodies.
Malfoy takes off his coat, revealing a silk scarf.
"My friends don't know," Harry snaps, suddenly embarrassed, because Malfoy didn’t need to know that. "The only people that know what I've just told you are in this room."
“Mate, you should come in. I should… explain myself,” Ron says. “And you should explain why Draco Malfoy is lurking beside us.”
"This is really weird, Draco," Harry mumbles, stepping down from the porch onto the ground. He reaches up with a red-gloved hand to rub his face. The other hand is clad in one of Draco’s duck gloves, and Harry hopes that he won’t get scolded for that. He’s come to love the damned things.
Throwing down a recognizable stack of letters and crossing his own arms in a gesture that puts Harry much more at ease because it’s so much more familiar, Malfoy says, in the same arrogant tone he appears to love using, “I want to know why you can't honour a simple request. I want to know why you failed to respond to a single one of my letters. I want to know why you think it's acceptable etiquette to return said letters without a simple 'Yes, Draco, I'd be delighted to attend your lovely charity gala' or even a 'Go and fuck yourself, Malfoy, I'd rather
"You were given the choice to come back from the dead?" Malfoy asks, surprised.
Sighing into the fabric, Harry closes his eyes and rests his head against the back of the chair, breathing in.
He's never seen him this vulnerable, so expressionless and calm. He looks nice even when he's obviously been drinking, even when his chin has light stubble on it and his grey eyes aren't open.
There’s no doubt in Harry, either, as he leans forward and captures Draco’s mouth with his.
Harry had been planning on warning Draco before coming in his mouth, but when he finally unravels with an uninhibited shout, it’s too late to say anything. Draco doesn’t seem to mind.
Feeling too broken to move, Harry casts a wand less
Harry dares himself to hope that all the smiling faces mean he won't have to do anyone any favours tonight.
soft and musky and clean, with hints of spicy scents that he must put in his hair and wash his body with—soaping long fingers down delicate, pale skin in the bath, massaging it into his shoulders and chest and abdomen, slowly sliding his hands lower, lower, lower until he finally reaches light-coloured curls of pubic hair…
******
Startled, Draco looks up, seeming generally confused as to why Hermione is asking him. He glances at Harry. Harry shrugs.
Malfoy doesn't respond, and Harry feels the grey eyes boring through him. After a few moments, Malfoy changes the subject, asking, "So, where are all these journalists that are supposedly baying for your blood?"
"Draco... fuck," Harry pants, because after all this time, he’s found his something—and now, more than anything, he needs to fucking
He looks out the door at the house, confirming that, indeed, it is a dark fuchsia. When he turns back around, Draco looks thoroughly distressed.
A pause. "You're tired."
Harry groans, swears, and jumps up to sit on the counter, elbows on knees and head in hands. "Malfoy, if you have a shred... the tiniest shred of human decency left in you, please fuck off and leave me alone," Harry mutters. He finds himself strangely wondering if Malfoy will take that as a challenge to purposefully eliminate any human decency that may be left. Teenage-Malfoy would have.
"Understand."
"I feel very strange indeed," Harry admits, restraining from reaching up to mess his hair; he's gotten it relatively close to flat for the evening. It had taken him a full twenty minutes to find two matching socks, and the dress robes he’s in now haven’t been worn since Bill and Fleur’s wedding.
Harry wonders if, had he chosen to ignore the pleas of people in the living world needing his help, and taken Dumbledore's hand to the realm of the dead back at King's Cross, his world would be calming silence, or something else entirely. He wonders if, were the former true, it would be worth leaving Voldemort for others to deal with over.
Yes, Harry is mad; of that, he's sure.
"Oh, god. Will you fuck off?"
that is sitting on the floor in front of her.
The cupboard flaps six times in quick succession, and Harry scowls. "Yes, I'm aware of that, thank you."
Draco nods vigorously. "Yes," he whispers.
When Harry looks up from the ground, there are at least twenty pairs of eyes on them. He swallows.
"That was different. I wasn't thinking about it. I was thinking about... something else," Harry says, looking out over the grounds.
"If you want, I can help you think of something else now, too."
"What exactly do you mean?" Malfoy asks, panicked, and Harry wants to bite his own tongue.
When Harry turns around to look at the scratches on Malfoy's face, the sympathetic expression on those pale features as they regard Harry lets him know just how terrible he must look. Harry winces, and turns back to the oven, holding out his arm for Draco to see his own set of scratches, courtesy of Mrs. N. "Sorry. She's in a really foul mood today. Already got me twice."
"Thanks," Draco murmurs, as Harry spots someone across the room that looks just enough like an old crone to be Draco's boss. His observation is confirmed when Draco elbows him in the ribs and says, "She looks like she's coming this way, which means it's time for your speech." Harry's stomach clenches painfully. "And I should probably get back to my date."
"I... " Harry starts, then doesn’t know how to finish. Malfoy stares at him intensely, and Harry suddenly feels like one of the ants he used to watch squirm under Dudley’s magnifying glass. "Like you said, a lot of people died that day. One of them was me."
Taken aback, Harry frowns. "Would you?"
Harry’s fist clench, and heat rises to his face. Is that what he’s worth? A reminder not to  get obsessed again because it would be
The paper crumples in his hands. Harry must have sent at least seven letters to Ron, and this is his reply—less than ten lines, including his name and Ron’s signature.
He’s been awake for hours the next day when he hears the knock at his door.
"Yes, it does," Harry agrees, wanting to cry with relief.
“No need to be like that. There's a really nice picture of the two of you, that's all, and I was going to ask how it went—stop that!" Hermione shrieks, as Mrs. Norris attempts to snap an entire bag of chips from right out in front of her, and winds up scratching Hermione's hand in the process. Harry rubs his face, absently wondering where Mrs. N had been when he’d been in his room just now. Usually, she causes much more havoc when Harry leaves her and goes upstairs. "I was going to ask, but obviously someone there upset you."
"Well, if your friends had been here—"
"You know what, Potter?” Malfoy says, lifting an eyebrow, “Not everything's about you."
Malfoy starts, as if lost in thought. "Hmm?"
"You say that now..." Harry says, foggy mind trying hard to think back to the evening and failing to get there. A lot of bad stuff happened, that’s for sure. "But people took pictures of me," he whispers, trying to get Draco to understand.
The wood shimmers and turns transparent. Draco stares at him, mouth open and eyes wide, through the door. He’s in a bathrobe and his hair is mussed and Harry has missed him
Cheeks flushed and hair all over the place, Harry thinks that Draco has never looked better. Even when he’s smiling.
Harry’s mouth twitches, and he feels light with hope. "So the point is, Draco, even though I'm completely useless at this, I think you're the something and I'd like it back, please. And walking up your drive was one of the scariest things I've ever done, so the least you can do is let me in for a bit," he finishes, barely breathing.
“I don’t
Smiling brilliantly and making Harry blink twice, Draco continues on from his previous escapade, this time from behind Harry as he works over the stove. "I, for one, don't know how waking me up at five-thirty in the morning is supposed to help, and honestly, I'm quite sure mother rises hours earlier than usual just to ensure that her stupid owls come pecking upon my window before a humanly decent time..."
“Hmm,” Draco hums, but doesn’t say anything.
“How are you feeling?” is the first thing she says, and Harry wonders if he looks like utter shite. Most likely.
Snorting and adjusting his position on the floor, Draco asks quietly, "Isn't your own backyard safe?"
******
"Fuck off, Malfoy." Harry says, shoving his hands into the pockets of his jeans. And then, before he can think about it, he says, "I'll see you tomorrow."
Draco grabs his hand and pulls him close. “If you’re going to look around my room,” He murmurs in Harry’s ear, leading him to the bed. “I think you’ll find that the most interesting part is over here."
"He doesn't fucking live here, you know," Harry finally says, with more malice than intended. Hermione is only trying to help, he knows that.
"How?"
They’re sitting in the kitchen twenty minutes later, drinking coffee and discussing Draco’s lack of Malfoy.
Already slightly uneasy because he’s run out of his favourite coffee and has had to resort to gulping down his second best brew, Harry happens to be pacing around the entrance hall when Malfoy arrives the next day. When he hears the knock, his stomach doesn’t drop quite as far as it did the last few days. As long as Malfoy doesn’t mention going outside, Harry decides that it won’t be so bad.
A low yowel comes from a hallway near the kitchen, and Harry clenches his fist. Fucking Mrs. Norris. He doesn't need this right now.
Closing his eyes and breathing deeply, Draco begins softly, "It's at my house. I can set up a direct, secure Floo connection, just for the night. Or we can Apparate right into the Manor grounds. You'd only have to step fifty feet out of your front door. As for the Gala itself, all you'd have to do is—"
"About what I said..." Harry begins, suddenly at a loss for words in a conversation he's played over in his head countless times, "I didn't... it's just..."
He doesn’t want that questionable honour, not with what it cost him to gather all three. He thinks of his parents, thinks of Sirius and Dumbledore. He thinks of Dobby. They all protected him, but what for? So he can go further, just a few steps and get slaughtered like a lamb. But no, Harry reminds himself, it’s not about death. It’s about sacrifices, the ones that every loved one in his life made. The one that he needs to make, to save his own loved ones. They don’t know that it’s his destiny to die, but they count on him to end this madness, to bring peace to the Wizarding world.
“Still, Seamus is, like, the king of us all. They cheer on him whenever he enters the common room.”
Today is an extraordinary stressful day at work and if Harry is honest, he doesn’t know when he last had a day that didn’t qualify as stressful. Probably any Sunday, but then they meet their friends, try to finish whatever chores are left from the week and, if there is still enough time, try to have sex at least once a month. Which happens less and less, since Draco is often plagued by headaches and Harry is just too tired.
He turns and unexpectedly sees an otter. It’s not a real animal, but an apparition of light. His mind fumbles for the knowledge and finally dredges up what he sees. It’s a Patronus and not just any, but Hermione’s. She’s calling to him, begging him to stop, and for a moment he feels inclined to do so, but the pathetic sobs Malfoy cries beneath him are too much of a distraction, and he turns again, ignoring the animal.
“Yes.”
He shuffles forward a bit, then presses Draco’s face into his arse. He doesn’t need to say it out loud, and Draco immediately sets to work. Harry loves his talented tongue and mouth and he gives himself over to the feeling of both of them working his hole.
He remembers all the times they were together, after a good shag or just because they needed to be near each other. It was always Draco’s fingers stroking through his hair, lightly scratching his scalp, more than once making Harry forget the heavy load that had been placed on his shoulders at a too young age. With Draco at his side, he could sleep through most nights, his mind free of horrible memories and the dark things that Voldemort projected.
—one of the copies that hadn’t been read to him earlier—and collapsing into an armchair, Harry has every intention of curling up and reading about The Weird Sisters’ new family of kneazles.
Breathe in, breathe out, breathe in, breathe out,
“Brilliant idea,” Draco replies, and then they’re Apparating into his bedroom.
"In," Draco mumbles against his mouth, and Harry wants to tell him to shut up and kiss him harder, but all that comes out is a low “hmm,” before he deepens the kiss himself.
"Muggles are weird," Draco had said, pouting and with no real bite. His view on Muggles has changed some, since his years at Hogwarts, and Harry can’t help himself from appreciating the humorous, maliceless confusion that has taken its place.
“Yes, you do. Merlin’s sake, you have before, and it’s nothing if not irritating for me. Just…” Draco gets the weird expression on his face again, somewhere between pity, concern, annoyance, and something distinctly
Mrs. Norris has struck again. Cradling a scratched and bitten hand, Malfoy seethes, "What the fuck
"Yes," Harry agrees, turning to rinse out the coffee machine.
Malfoy shows up earlier than usual. Harry can't help but snap a little as he opens the door. "What the hell kind of time do you call this? In, Malfoy."
"How much of it will I need to do so that your boss doesn't kill you?" Harry asks, stomach clenching in determination. He stares at the ceiling, unable to look at whatever expression is on Draco's face.
******
"Not clever enough, then, apparently," Harry says, though he's slightly amused. "And anyway, I'm not really newsworthy unless I actually step outside and do something for them to report on."
Draco nods and leans against the counter. Harry feels grey eyes on him the entire time he's making the coffee. It makes him even more anxious, and after the day he's had, that's a difficult feat.
He’s so lost in his thoughts that by the time he comes down the stairs and sees who exactly Hermione is conversing with, he’s completely dumbstruck.
Harry glances over at her; Hermione looks caught between exasperation and bemusement. “You’re acting a bit weird today, Hermione, did you know that?”
Hermione merely shakes her head again, muttering under her breath something that sounds suspiciously like
He’s a little more than surprised that he’s smiled at all today. Even with Hermione, smiles are rare; with Malfoy, they seem to be much more... existent. Possibly, it’s the second symptom that he’s losing his mind. The first, of course, would be all the talking to himself that he’s been doing lately.
“And it was nicer than you deserve. I’ve half a mind to throw myself off the Manor rather than deal with you
"S'good manners,” Harry says. He may as well.
“Get all… angry and tense and brooding and then spend the next week hating everything,” Draco elaborates, exhaling loudly.
Clearing his throat, Draco answers, "I bet we could Transfigure some proper grass. You know... if you really wanted to go all out with pretending you were in the park."
Footsteps come from outside the door, and there are a few swift knocks before Draco steps in.
and the unsaid information that Ron doesn’t have time for Harry, not even an hour, but he can go away with Hermione for eight weeks with no problems.
Hearing Malfoy say aloud what Harry has been trying to convince himself for the last year makes him uncomfortable. Shifting around on the floor, Harry sighs. "And there's the thing, Malfoy. I'm not sure that I did.”
"No. It's about letters. Letters, Potter," Malfoy insists.
that, Potter?"
Glaring at Draco, he storms away, towards the cat's noises.
Harry has been so,
So he does, and when Draco lets out an indignant huff and fails to hit him back, but not for lack of trying, Harry doesn’t think about the fact that this will all be over, and soon.
Malfoy mumbles something about being insane in the other room. Apparently, he's finally caught on. "Having a little epiphany there, Malfoy? 'Cause you know... I could've told you that years ago."
The most troubling part of all of that was how badly he had wanted to. When drunk, all of Harry's inhibitions had been down, and he had let every careful thought go in favour of kissing Draco Malfoy. Harry doesn't even know what to do now. When Malfoy comes downstairs later, things are going to be awkward as hell.
People are staring. People are staring a lot.
Draco laughs, thighs pressing into Harry’s. "Would you call that sex?"
Draco replies, "I don't know, do I?" and Harry feels a smirk searing into his back.
He wishes Malfoy would leave. He just really, really wishes that Malfoy would leave.
Then, before any other words between them can be exchanged, President Cholmondely is sweeping him away and saying something excitedly. Harry is distracted by the gentle squeeze Draco has just given his arm and the raging nerves in his system, and doesn't hear what she's telling him. He predicts that as long as he nods along, he'll be fine.
They stumble and touch, and by the time they’ve reached the marble stairs, there’s so much skin on skin that Harry almost can’t breathe. His jacket and shirt have disappeared without him noticing, and Draco’s mouth on his feels like fire.
After Malfoy leaves, Harry sends an owl to Hermione asking her to stop by later if she can. Then he pads around the house for a few hours, uncovering mirrors and stacking magazines that were unceremoniously thrown around the living room. Grabbing
"Draco," Harry practically sighs with relief, wanting to grab him and squeeze him and hold him and
Draco sighs, "We did that one, I think."
"No, Malfoy, are you deaf?" Harry rasps. He won’t have this conversation. Hermione is one thing, but Malfoy? There’s no way in hell. "Now, either drink that fucking coffee or give it back to me, because it's good stuff and you're not wasting it."
"You're making no sense," Draco tells him, and Harry has to take a moment to think back to what he said before that. Something about conclusions.
******
"You're a wanker, do you know that?" Draco glares.
Harry sighs; frowns; takes a deep breath. "After he killed me..."
"Which part?" Draco asks, slightly alarmed as he pokes Harry in the stomach."Sex?"
sodding
Desperate to change the subject, Harry takes his hands away from his face, opens a kitchen cabinet, and pulls out a Muggle pen and paper. After scribbling an address on it, he hands it to Malfoy.
Harry suspects that he’s got a soft spot for Malfoy.
"Janice," Harry amends.
"What should we do?"
"Helping: something you are not," Harry replies, nerves tingling at the thought."Which is strange, considering that you're the one who wants me to do outside stuff. I know there will be people. I know they'll probably be talking about me. I know."
"I hope my bitter disappointment isn't too upsetting for you," Draco murmurs, looking up and adding, "Potter," in his snarky way that makes Harry want to lean over and smack him upside the head.
"You still call me Malfoy," Malfoy points out, "and if you don't mind, I'd prefer it if you—this coffee tastes weird." He frowns, completely distressed, as though the wrong coffee has just ruined his day. Harry thinks that maybe it has.
"Well, Esme," Harry whispers to the owl, petting his feathers as Esme nips at Harry’s finger, "I suppose this is the last time I’ll see you."
Behind him on the way to the kitchen, Harry hears a hiss and a curse.
There's a strange tension around Draco the next day, from the moment Harry opens the door. His eyes are darting around, trying not to settle on Harry’s face, and his ever-expressive face is looking distinctly guilty.
"It let me pass."
It works. Draco's eye blink rapidly, and he pulls himself back together. Harry wonders what the fuck that was about.
"Well, in that case, I'm sure your neighbours will appreciate my singing instead.” Harry’s heart sinks. Malfoy is serious. “I thought I'd come a little earlier tomorrow morning... how does six o'clock grab you?"
Today, Harry is sitting on the bottom step of the stairs, watching Draco clutch his newly re-packed briefcase like a lifeline. He looks worried.
“No, of course not. But you should have seen your face."
Then her next question takes him completely off-guard.
Harry snorts. “Then why do you look as if Voldemort’s just risen from the dead?”
******
"Read what?" Harry asks, as he’s drawn away from thoughts of followers, leaders, and both sides in a war that had no real winners and only losses.
Draco doesn't leave then, but he does give Harry an almost twisted smile, a smile that makes Harry long for the nice, easy ones he used to get. And then makes him clench his fists even harder.
Malfoy lifts his head fast enough to have it clang against the stove behind him. "Are you out of your
“Have been, actually," Harry informs her, smiling a little. In fact, he’s been sleeping rather well. Probably because of the exhausting re-awakening of his libido.
"Er, I took them down," Harry says sheepishly. Draco’s glare deepens, so he adds quickly, "And put them back!" Draco just looks at him. Harry sighs. "I didn't think you'd let me in."
Draco stares at him with wide eyes. "You were a lot of an idiot.”
"Funny," Malfoy replies, sinking down into the other armchair and picking up one of the trashy celebrity magazines that Harry flat-out refuses to admit to reading. From the look on his face, it’s obvious that he isn’t comfortable with being on a first-name basis, and that’s a large part of the reason that Harry dropped ‘Malfoy’ in the first place. "I don't need to be entertained.”
Draco cocks an eyebrow. “Well, that isn’t Hermione’s owl. So you do have other friends, after all.”
"He left. He went to his office. Or home. To his house. His Manor. Where he lives. As opposed to here, where he does not live."
He even whispers Draco’s name as he comes into his fist.
“Must you?" Malfoy asks, and when Harry glances back at him, he looks pained.
Instead of concentrating on the ball room or the people there, Harry says his speech without thinking about it. He forces his mind to wander away to his Park, and while he's actually standing in front of a huge number of people, shaking slightly and palms sweaty, in his head he's sitting on a green carpet and staring at the sky.
"If you must know, we haven't been together since school. Why the unhealthy interest in my love life all of a sudden? Or are you just trying to divert attention away from the incredibly presumptuous thing you did this morning?"
Harry feels the beginnings of a smile melt off his face. "No, I haven't, and there's no way on this earth I'm getting into that with you. Forget I said anything about it. Seriously, or else you and your ducks can fuck off back where you came from right now, Gala or no Gala."
"It's a good question, though, don't you think?" Malfoy asks, coming closer to Harry, evidently intending to enter the house.
“Fuck,” Harry mumbles into Draco’s throat when a gently eager hand comes to cup his growing erection.
"I should think so," Draco says, tapping the cabinet twice and turning around to find Harry looking at him. Mrs. Norris scratches her claws deep into Harry's arm; he barely notices.
After a few minutes, Harry realizes it’s his turn to speak. "Professional owl-napping?"
Harry opens the door to find Malfoy shouting tunelessly,
“Not so bad,” Hermione repeats slightly disbelievingly, but doesn’t say anything else. She does rub her temples, however, as if she’s developing a headache.
Draco Malfoy is a good person.
The final thing he's aware of is a plethora of memories from the night before.
"Because I'm fucking desperate, Potter! You know how important this is. I panicked, all right?"
Because Harry doesn't know where to go, he goes into his bedroom. It's the only room Draco has never been in, and therefore the only room where Harry can think properly without getting overemotional and confused again.
“Though I’d never see you at all,” Harry murmurs, and Ron’s smile drops a little.
"Enjoying the view?" Someone asks from behind him, and Harry has already gone for his wand when he turns to see that it's only Draco.
forcing me," Malfoy says, "President Cholmondely is quite insistent that you attend this function, and as it's fallen to me to secure your attendance... You know, it's extremely rude to stand with your back to someone when they're talking to you, Potter. And do you know what else is rude? Failing to reply to—"
"Joking? No,” Hermione says, making her way towards the door, obviously intent on
******
Behind him, Harry hears footsteps coming into the room and stopping, undoubtedly at Malfoy’s usual chair near the table.
Malfoy. I still don't like you, so don't worry."
—want to die, Malfoy must want to die, he must want to be killed and then killed again, because—
What to do with them now?
"Yeah, football should be good. Not sure about the whole learning stuff though" he said cheekily trying not to smile at his mother. Lily glanced at him before smacking him upside the head. James sniggered quietly and Iris giggled into her hands.
I hope you enjoyed it!
"Well it was nice meeting you" Draco's heart dropped. He had thought that he had finally made some friends or at least acquaintances but maybe he was wrong.
Draco had arrived at the library after Hermione desperately trying to stall the conversation for a little bit longer.
Hermione pulled him into a hug, too shocked for words as Draco sat numb after reliving the darkest times of his life.
"My name is Draco" he said quietly cheeks still burning. Pansy and Blaise looked at each other appearing to be having a silent conversation. Draco stood there feeling quite awkward until Blaise broke the silence.
"Word on the street is that you're with Harry Potter." Pansy said crossing her arms over her chest. Had people really noticed so quickly? Draco frowned, unsure why it mattered to them and if he even was with Harry. Draco smiled at the thought of the boy and their upcoming date.
"Did you make any friends?" She prompted gently, sitting next to him on the old sofa. Draco smiled sadly again which was enough of an answer for her. She brought Draco close and stroked his fine hair trying to soothe him and his worries. Draco sniffled trying not cry, scared of the reaction he would receive.
"Actually, I said that I would meet them for lunch. I hope you guys don't mind." He said reverting back to his shy self.
Harry was still thinking about the boy Hermione was talking about when he walked into a person who then proceeded to fall to the floor. The boy hastily picked up his books missing a textbook.
"I'm so excited Mum!" Iris proclaimed throwing her arms in the air. Lily smiled fondly then turned to Harry.
"I'm a little nervous" he admitted "but I'm looking forward to seeing the library to be honest." He said smiling shyly.
Draco shuffled away and sat down at the lunch table. Harry paused his conversation with Hermione to kiss Draco on the side of the head.
The boy reached into his backpack and pulled out Draco's battered textbook "You dropped this when I ran into you the other day and I've been meaning to return it but I couldn't find you." He offered the book to Draco and Draco hesitantly branched out and took it into his hands.
"I expect him to be back before 9! And in one piece!" She said harshly to a startled Harry. She turned to Draco and pulled him into a warm loving hug.
Draco frowned unsure of who she was talking about "do you mean Harry?" He questioned still confused.
"What's got you so excited Draco?" Hermione asked from across the table.
"Yes. Please." He said trying not to sound so desperate. They both smiled before leaving the library together.
"Are you ok?" Harry asked attempting to help the boy up.His eyes seemed to be glued to the floor and he refused to look up at Harry. He tried to speak but Harry had trouble understanding so the boy left down the hallway before Harry even got to see his face. Harry picked up the textbook and opened it to find ‘Draco Malfoy’ written in neat cursive.
"Oi Harry pass the ball!" His teammate shouted from across the pitch. Harry ignored him and sprinted past the other team placing the ball straight into the net. The whole school jumped up and cheered at the winning goal and Harry felt his body being lifted into the air. Harry searched over the crowd seeing his family but not the particular blonde boy that he had been hoping would be there.
By the time lunch had come around, Harry was still in glee. He approached the table with a spring in his step and a wide smile stretched across his face.
"Well it's good that you have made more friends Dray." Hermione said making Draco smile shyly.
"Um.. I've never actually played before, but it seems fun I guess."
"Hellooo, I'm talking to you!" She said her shrill voice hurting his ears.
Draco quickly collected himself and set of to school being careful not to get in the way of any passerby's.
Harry saw his family race over which raised his spirits.
"I know how much you love the stars, so I've brought you to a date beneath the stars" Harry said as he handed Draco a bar of chocolate.
"Are your ok Draco? I didn't mean to overstep" she said her brows creasing. Draco shook his head scared that he'd worried her.
"Draco" she said hands in her hips "Where have you been? You are 10 minutes late."
"Well, yeah. I know we don't know each other well but I really like you Draco."
"How was your weekend Hermione? Sad we didn't see you." Harry said.
Harry caught him as he was leaving school and walked home with him. He even offered to carry Draco's books (which made Draco blush) .
"Really?" He squeaked out "I find them really scary." He admitted.
He slowly emerged from the covers to find a little girl smiling sweetly.
"Do you want to go out with me on the weekend?" Harry said out of the blue making Draco trip over his feet and fall to the floor.
(See the end of the chapter for
I hope you enjoy and let me know what you think <3
Pansy and Blaise blocked Draco from his seat forcing him to look up at them.
Draco was not ashamed to say that he went to hide in the library. It had become a safe space for him where no one talked to him or had an expectation of who he should be. So when someone entered his haven, he was nervous until he saw who it was.
All of a sudden, Draco moved away and left down the hallway leaving Harry staring after him.
"Oh, it's ok-" "I wasn't finished yet." She said holding up a finger "I would really like if we could be friends"
"Hey mate!" Ron greeted just as Hermione had said "Hi Harry!".
They were walking to lesson one day when the subject of family first came up and Draco froze. He had been dreading the subject since it came up with Pansy and Blaise but he knew that it was only a matter of time before she asked. Hermione looked at him worriedly and pulled him to the side of the hallway.
Hermione started getting red in face with frustration "No, I definitely saw him. He has very blond hair and he... he is in Snape's form!" Ron and Harry groaned at the mention of the chemistry teachers name. "His name is, oh what is his name?!"
All too soon Draco arrived at the lunch hall and looked around to see Blaise and Pansy waving at him. Draco hesitantly waved back at them and plucked up the courage to go up to their table.
"It's ok Hermione." Draco said suddenly embarrassed.
"He's the most popular boy in school, he's trouble and we-" Blaise raised his eyebrows "..well, I don't trust him."
"Fine, we were watching you with Draco. And
Harry had only just left his house when he first saw him. He had blond hair so light it was almost white and he was wearing the same school uniform as Harry. He was outside Ms Figg's house which Harry thought was strange as he thought his neighbour lived alone. Harry was about to approach him when Iris pushed him along the path towards school.
Draco sat thoughtfully, truthfully he was incredibly nervous about going to the new school. He feared he would have no friends and that he would get made fun of, but he couldn't tell Ms Figg that without upsetting her. So instead he got up from the table and returned to his room to put on his uniform for school.
"Hi Harry" Lily said her voice strained. Harry frowned at them.
Draco walked anxiously to the canteen running through all the possibilities of what could go wrong. It had taken Draco so long to find one friend and he was worried that he could loose that. He saw Hermione as soon as he entered the canteen and made his way towards her keeping his eyes down and his books close to his body.
When Draco woke up he was laying on the sofa with his head in Ms Figg's lap. He noticed that not only was it dark outside but he was still in his clothes- yet again. He got up slowly trying not to disturb Ms Figgs slumber and made his way down the hall to his room.
"Why?" Blaise prompted gently.
Draco was just leaving the library when someone tall and broad bumped into him, making him drop all of his books and fall to the floor. Draco scrambled to pick up his books and attempted to make a quick exit when the person spoke.
"That sounds lovely Ms Figg, thank you." Draco murmured softly.
"So whose excited for school?" Lily said looking over at her children.
Harry was on his way to school the next day, when he saw a familiar blonde boy in front of him. He jogged to catch up with him and threw an arm around his waist. Draco jumped in surprise but calmed when he saw Harry smiling cheekily at him; Draco blushed shyly and ducked his head out of view.
Draco made his way into form silently when two people stopped him before he could sit. Draco didn't dare look up and instead looked at their shoes. You could tell a lot about someone based on their shoes. They both had shiny polished shoes without a single blemish: rich kids.
Harry beamed "He said yes, we're going out this weekend"
Draco walked down the street clutching his books to his chest and hiding his face behind a canopy of blonde hair. He frantically rushed home trying not to miss his curfew, which he failed yet again.
"Saw you with golden boy again" Pansy greeted.
"Me?" Draco spluttered suddenly feeling shy "why?"
"Draco, how would you feel about eating lunch with me, Ron and Harry today?" Hermione asked I'm the middle of their maths lesson. Draco looked at her before looking back at his book.
"I'm sorry for whatever I have done." He murmured, eyes wide.
"He's real Ron. In fact, I returned his textbook today".
Harry didn't see him again until he was on his way home from school. He was in front of Harry walking slowly whilst reading an enormous book about something that Harry couldn't even pronounce. Harry went to reach for the textbook when Draco looked up from his book and went inside Ms Figg's house. Harry sighed and tucked the book back into his bag and headed to his house just a few doors down.
"Yeah I'm pretty sure he got those from Lily" Sirius' husband Remus said trying to seem serious. Everyone burst into laughter and Harry doubled over forgetting his previous disappointment.
Harry had searched the school for a whole month before he had finally seen Draco.
"I don't really want to talk about it" Draco said emotions flooding his features. He could tell that they felt bad but he didn't want their pity.
Draco followed behind her to the kitchen where he was met by the sweet smell of breakfast. Halfway through eating Draco thought he had gotten away with staying quiet until Ms Figg began speaking again.
"Just so you know, I don't approve." Pansy said picking at her salad.
How is it? <3
"I'd really like to have a pet snake." Harry said thoughtfully which took Draco by surprise.
"What about my rugged looks?!?" His father exclaimed bringing an arm around Harry.
"Ok, but don't come running back to me when he hurts you"
"Now that we're friends, let's talk about Potter..."
Draco was so excited to have actually talked to someone that he wasn't looking where he was going on the way to his lesson. He breezed through the hallways feeling like he was on top of the world when it all came crashing down. Draco fell in a heap in the middle of a (thankfully) quiet corridor. Draco collected himself before walking straight into a boy standing behind him.
Harry and Iris both nodded before sitting down at the table.
"Don't worry love, I'll protect you from any rogue snakes."
Draco was quite content sitting in the corner of the form room when the bell forced him back into reality, Draco hastily picked up his things and left the room before anyone had even noticed he was there.
"Oh I'm sorry! I was with Draco all weekend" Harry perked up at the mention of his name but Ron rolled his eyes.
Draco spluttered trying to find the words to resolve the situation, instead finding it easier to look down upon his still socked feet.
They broke apart to allow Harry to say one thing "will you be my boyfriend?" Draco surged forward to re-meet their lips which was enough of an answer for Harry.
Thank you so much for 1000 reads! ❤️
"I have to go now, sorry" Draco hurried away his neck burning in shame and embarrassment. He could hear them calling after him, but he couldn't face them and their questions yet.
"Here you go love" they had arrived at Draco's form "I'll see you at lunch" Harry said before he kissed Draco tenderly on the lips, Draco could never get bored of those kisses.
Draco reached form just as Mr Snape appeared. Hermione had told him that it was quite unfortunate to have Snape as a form tutor as he was a 'greasy hook-nosed bat'. But, so far he hadn't been that bad as he hadn't forced Draco to introduce himself or talk to anyone.
"Harry, get out from under there I have big news" a voice proclaimed.
"Where are we going Harry?" Draco murmured.
Harry had barely registered the conversation as he walked away still in awe of what he had seen.
Harry away from me! I mean why would he want to be with someone like
"Maybe from the start?" Hermione smiled seeming supportive "Take your time."
"Then how come no one else has ever seen him but you?" Ron questioned sipping his drink. "What does it matter anyway, you gave him back his stuff so you never have to talk to him again."
Draco was on his way to lunch when he bumped into a girl with red hair making them both fall to the floor.
"Good morning Dear, I've come to let you know that breakfast is ready. Oh Draco did you fall asleep in your clothes?" She said chuckling slightly.
"Of course we don't!" Hermione said as he picked up his belongings.
Let me know if there’s anything that you’d like to see :)
"I love it, thank you Hazza" Draco said as he kissed Harry on the cheek.
anyway, just look at you!" Draco looked down at his oversized school uniform in shame as she strutted away.
"Hi" Draco squeaked out, not certain that they could even hear him.
"You should invite him to sit with us today at lunch so Ron can
"I'm Harry by the way, I'll see you around." Harry then walked away out of sight and Draco was left staring after him.
"Are you alright Dray? I'm so sorry, I didn't know that they would be there." Harry pulled Draco into his arms and tucked Draco's head beneath his chin.
"Ron! Given the amount of time and effort that Harry has put into trying to find him, I think this about more than a missing textbook." Hermione informed. Harry blushed slightly and chose not to respond instead turning to his lunch to distract himself.
Draco and Hermione had found that they shared many lessons together, despite never seeing each other, and had grown quite close over the past few weeks. He was so grateful that she wanted to spend time with him and she constantly talked about him meeting her other friends- which he was still hesitant about.
Draco, being too nervous to even look at the boy, spluttered a response turned, and fled without turning back.
"We could be friends if you'd like!" She exclaimed "I really do need someone better to study with, I'm pretty sure my friends don't even know where the library is!" A small giggle escaped him which he covered with his hands.
"Hey guys you'll never guess who I saw today." Harry said almost jumping up and down in his seat.
"Don't act so innocent, you know what you have done. You took
"Maybe you imagined him then" Harry said smirking from behind his sandwich.
Draco woke the next morning to a soft knocking at the door. Hurriedly he tumbled out of bed and went to open it to find old Ms Figg behind it wearing a gentle smile.
"Ok, so I was born in Wiltshire to Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy. I have always been shy and Father always resented me for it because he wanted me to be his idea of a strong man when I grew up."
"Hello" the first one spoke, she seemed ok, but how much can you tell based on their voice?
A sharp knock broke the silence and Ms Figg went to let Harry in.
"I'll have to ask him" Hermione said sounding unsure. Just then Ms Mcgonagall strode into the classroom silencing all conversation. 'Later' Hermione mouthed and Harry nodded hopeful that Draco would join them.
"Stop saying mean things about Harry, Pansy" he said hesitantly, trying to stand up for his boyfriend.
"Blaise, leave us" Blaise backed away arms raised in surrender as Draco sunk into his seat.
Harry flung open the front door to see his parents standing there looking very suspicious.
Draco stood in front of Ms Figg allowing her to brush out his fine hair. Draco was anxious about the date, Harry hadn't told him anything only to dress warm which Draco thought was far too ambiguous.
"Draco how do you feel about going to school today? I do hope your not too anxious, I've heard lovely things about Hogwarts." She said animatedly.
"I'll let you know the details then, bye Dray."
"So sorry Lily." He said flashing his teeth at his wife "anyway, hello my loves are you ready for your last day of summer dinner?"
"Is this about your imaginary friend again, because if you've seen him mate, you've gone insane." Ron said seriously. Harry frowned at him.
What did you think? ❤️

Draco nervously fiddled with the strap of his bag refusing to meet the eyes of any students as he entered. He timidly approached a girl with large fluffy hair and gently patted her shoulder.
want to know if you like him." Lily said jabbing his chest.
Draco had made it all the way to lunch without having to talk to anyone. He thought about Ms Figgs homemade lunch secured in his bag whilst he peered over the hundreds of faces looking for a free table or at least a friendly face. He couldn't see Hermione either, which left him with no option but to find refuge in the school library. Draco sat in a dusty corner of the library, which he had claimed as his own, and pulled out a book.
Harry's heart fell at the loss, he had been thinking of Draco since their last meeting but hadn't been able to speak to him. Harry knew that Hermione had become friends with Draco which didn't help his longing for the boy.
Draco looked at him in shock "how did you know?" Draco whispered gazing up at Harry.
"What's got you down sweetheart?" She asked having noticed his glum mood.
"I made new friends!" He exclaimed causing Harry to whip his head up look at Draco.
Draco looked up to see fairy lights twisting through the trees and an opening above to the sky. He looked towards Harry in confusion to which he beamed.
"Iris could you stop doing that every time you come in my room." Harry said annoyed.
"Draco love, how was school?" Ms Figg asked Draco upon entering the house. Draco smiled sadly and placed his bag on the floor.
"Hi." Draco murmured perching on the side of the chair. He looked up for a brief moment to see Harry staring at him intently. Draco blushed furiously and tried to hide his eyes behind his hair.
"Hey Draco, we saw that you were with lover boy again." Blaise teased as Draco sat down. Draco blushed furiously at the comment and Pansy scowled at the mention of Harry.
Let me know what you think <3
"Why?" Draco squeaked out.
Harry only knew him for his white blonde hair and his name, which nobody else knew. Draco was completely off the radar not known by anyone, like a ghost walking the halls.
Draco takes a deep breath, and Harry would do the same if only he could breathe properly at all. "Your speech is the pre-dinner one, so you can say your piece, make awkward conversation with her highness while you eat your steak, and then you can bugger off if you want to."
"I don't know..." Draco says, and Harry can hear the hope struggling to break into his voice, "A short speech, dinner, perhaps a bit of mingling with some of those important rich people. You wouldn't have to stay the whole night.”
Harry smile is huge as he sits up and peers into Draco's face. Draco's so funny, acting like he doesn't know. "No, no, no. You
Harry stares at him for a moment. Then he shrugs. "Yes."
Harry grabs the bottle of Ogden's and leaves the kitchen without saying anything else. In the room with his Park sky, he can hear Draco coming up the stairs to join him.
Ginny stops by on Friday, and with her a large stack of magazines. Harry thinks Hermione probably told her to come over, but he wishes she hadn’t. As Harry sits with Ginny in his living room and they talk about Gladia the Gorgeous’ newest divorce, he misses the snotty comments and little quips that could only come from Draco. When Ginny leaves a few hours later, Harry stays in his living room; after about ten minutes, his resolve breaks.
Harry hides a smile with his hands and says, "You're right, that is weird. And I can't believe I just said you were right. And... what? My cupboard's been talking to you? My cupboard's been telling tales on me to you?"
As if showing up here for the night hadn't been too much already. "Behave, Draco." He gestures to the land he's still looking at. "Look at that. I can't remember the last time I could see such a long way; it's incredible."
, Harry mentally chides himself. He knows better than anyone that Malfoy never wanted to do half the things he had to. And he had saved Harry’s life that day.
"I don't—"
“That's not true. You know exactly what to do to get rid of me," Draco says lightly, and as the words sink in, Harry feels something akin to longing in his chest. Longing for Malfoy to stay, for his companionship, if he's not mistaken, and that's not only weird, but it's also... true. Harry sighs.
"Oh, go on and tell your stories, Malfoy. Don't let me get in the way."
"Ever heard of taking things slowly?" Draco says sarcastically.
"You're not helping, you know." Harry makes a face and walks steadily towards Draco, who is already standing in the middle of the lawn.
"Look,” Draco begins, and Harry tries his hardest not to repeatedly slam his head against the table. That’s Malfoy’s listen-to-me-now-or-I’ll-bother-you-about-it-for-the-rest-of-your-life voice, the same one he uses when speaking about the Gala. “I can no longer be arsed pretending that there's nothing different about today. Two years ago, a couple of great things happened, and a lot of fucking awful, senseless things happened. I know that, Harry. You know that. And I'm just confused about why your so-called friends aren't here with you, because you're not fine," Draco says, tone soft, concerned. Harry feels like crying. "Or are you just pulling your self-sacrificing hero act?"
"Lie down?" Draco asks, voiced raised a few pitches in what must be terror at the thought of his expensive cashmere sweater touching the ground. "Lie down where, anyway?"
"I'm not very good at drinking," Harry admits. "Did you un-network me?" he adds, suddenly curious, and it's a mistake to look at Draco. His blond hair looks perfect under the Park's night sky above them, and Harry can't think of why it would be a bad idea for them to kiss. It seems like a great idea now, brilliant, even. But what if Draco doesn't like him? Harry wants Draco to like him.
Which, Harry has to cede, doesn’t mean half of the bad things it used to.
