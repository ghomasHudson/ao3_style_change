“Do you have this under control?” Potter asks as he scans the scene. Draco shrugs.
“Draco!” calls a warm, feminine voice. He glances to his right, his eyes immediately falling on Hermione’s petite yet imposing form. Her wild bushy hair is hidden under a lavish deep-plum and gold gele that matches her robes tied around her head. She has an air of confidence about her that warrants immediate attention and respect, and he often finds himself standing a bit straighter around her. “Looks like I just missed Harry,” she says, peering down the corridor at Potter’s retreating form.
Everyone looks up at Draco. Potter’s hands are shaking as he takes several steps away from Luna, who stops trembling almost immediately. Millicent is glaring at Draco. Padma’s lips are pursed.
—I’m not going to last
“What?” Draco snaps.
“Such a
The room is once again stirring with murmurs and the flashing of camera light.
“You’re down here, aren’t you?” Gedeon says, his hands clasped in front of him as he smiles at Harry. “My, I think this is the first time I’ve actually seen you up close. Not bad, no wonder Draco is so smitten with you.”
“I’d like to do this again,” Potter says warmly, stepping into Draco’s personal space.
“It’s fine, Draco, don’t ever apologise for crying. I don’t think you should have smoked that spliff.” Potter’s now rubbing soothing circles into Draco’s shoulder blade. “I’m going to tell everyone to head out, yeah?”
Padma takes a step back, looking unsure. “Draco. I know you are upset—”
Draco checks his Rolex with a scowl. “I only have an hour for lunch. He bloody knows that.”
their emotions...it’s very intense to experience.
Draco sneers. “Of course I do. I may be a lot of things, but a bully is no longer on that list. I see right through you. You’re a bully who’s ended up in law enforcement to hide behind your Ministry robe and badge so you can easily intimidate people and take what you want. You’re disgusting.”
“Let me die,” Draco whispers, his gaze unblinking and unseeing. Harry knows then that the creature has taken over completely.
Before Draco can bite back the question, it spills from him. “Why?”
Draco turns around.
Potter snorts, shifting beside him. “D’you fashion yourself Chief Warlock or the Supreme Mugwump one of these days?”
“You don’t miss it?”
Potter is silent for a moment. “Okay.”
She’s been growing her hair out, it’s nearly down to her bum again, and right now it’s plastered to her face like a mangled curtain. Upon closer inspection, Harry realises that she’s soaked to the bone with rain, her mascara running down her pale cheeks. She releases a sob.
did that! What the hell are you on about?”
This is fluffy/funny with a brief discussion on mental health, so just wanted to provide a heads-up! xx
Draco sighs happily. “Perfect. Amazing. Sexy.”
“What the hell is your problem today, Potter?” Draco asks, snatching the ink pot up before it destroys the album. Draco hates that he doesn’t sound entirely as casual as he’d like, his hurt spilling out into his tone.
“Actually. You haven’t been the same since Saeed left,” Millie muses, her expression questioning. “You know you can talk to us, right, Draco?”
Draco falls into a deep depression that he hasn’t felt in months. The pain he feels hooks into him, gnarly nails digging into his delicate flesh. Some days he can’t breathe, some days he can’t think.
The guards wince, apologise profusely, and let Harry through. Pansy grabs him with both hands. “Listen to me. I’ve known for quite some time that Draco’s in love with you. I guess I thought you were smarter than you actually are, as it didn’t cross my mind at all that you would hurt him...so you have to make this right. Draco’s too stubborn to pull his head out of his arse and accept that maybe you’re not Satan reincarnate. He’s over by the champagne fountain...don’t mind his date, horribly boring man…And like I said before, Harry, don’t fuck this up. I’ll hex you to Timbuktu if you do.” She pats him on the cheek. Pansy smiles before shoving him off and disappearing into the crowd herself.
“What are you doing?” Draco hisses. “Unhand me, Potter!”
“Nice of you,” he retorts with a scowl. When she doesn’t move away from the door, he flops ungracefully onto her couch, kicking his feet up onto her coffee table, knowing this will drive her up the wall with a rant about uncouth behaviour and the sanctity of her perfect furniture. When she refrains, Draco growls. “Get me a bloody drink or
Draco’s drawn back to Harry, whose voice is so hushed and strained as he says, “I’ve always been afraid of the dark, I still am, as a result of sleeping in a cupboard my entire childhood. I was forced to sleep in pitch black, locked away and crying, alone, sometimes wetting my pants in fear.” Harry swallows, the shame and sorrow thick in his voice. Draco read about Harry’s terrible childhood through unauthorised biographies, and wants to reach over and hold him, but he’s too transfixed to move. Harry’s words build a ball of panic in Draco’s chest and he doesn’t know what’s happening, or why it’s happening so quickly—how did they go from playfully mocking one another to feeling so full of sorrow and cold, piercing fear, each word like falling pieces of shrapnel in his belly.

was also an actual monster,
Bitty suddenly looks troubled, a frown gracing her pretty face as she looks up at Blaise before gazing back at Draco. “We’re so sorry. Like I said that night, Draco, we don’t want to hurt you. We’ll never hurt you.”
Draco’s forehead is slightly glossy with sweat. He always exudes an effortless elegance that Harry surprisingly sometimes finds himself envious of. Even as he’s dressed in simple tight tan chinos, an equally simple tucked white t-shirt, and black braces, Draco looks impeccable. The cuffs of his chinos are rolled up to expose his attractive, narrow ankles and his white blond hair is pulled back in a bun, showing off his recent, closely cropped sides. What suspiciously looks like a joint is tucked behind his left ear. Harry’s mouth goes a little dry.
“I…” Malfoy trails off, his indignant expression slipping into one of bewilderment. “I don’t see how it’s any of your business, Potter, but I’ve just come from an Imperial College catch up event… I’m now in the area for a lunch rendezvous, which I am terribly late for. Now, am I allowed to leave,
“May I touch you?” Padma asks instead of pushing him further on the topic.
He stands then, stretching his body out before placing his hands on the back of his hips. He sighs, shoulders sagging as he glances back at the music box. “I think I should take that box.”
Draco knows what Pansy means. The complicated feelings he’s had for Harry, and what he is to Harry since before he even met him,
Draco snorts. “
“I’m not,” he groans. “I’m fine, really.”
What the

Draco thinks. He wouldn’t go so far as to call it that. Argued, maybe. Was ignored and disrespected, definitely. And that was the sorriest sorry he’s ever heard in his life. Draco leans back in his chair and runs a hand through his hair.
. This irrational anger you’re feeling? The confusion and pain? It will consume you if you continue to ignore it.”
But Merlin, he is still the most beautiful man Draco’s ever seen.
“I’m sorry,” Harry says once more, an ache in his chest as he takes in Draco’s face, the undiluted rage etched like hard lines in marble. “I didn’t want you to mean anything, either. I didn’t want to look at you and feel like I had found home, Draco, but I did and I’m so sorry I’ve brought us to this point. You chose me, Draco, and I-I was too late in choosing you
Draco’s certain of one thing, though: he’s quickly losing the plot.
Saeed sighs, folding his arms against his wide chest. “You’re fine. My mother may have protested your name remaining on the list, but I talked her down. Merlin forbids if she offends Narcissa and Dany. The fall out—”
Draco tries to sit up but the pain that lances through him has him flat on his back and panting. “Padma, please. I need relief. I need to get up and go—”
Bawling! I’ve never seen you cry so bloody hard!”
When they make it out onto a secluded area on Charing Cross to Apparate, Potter holds his hand out. “Side Along?”
” Blaise babbles. Draco turns to gape at him, surprised to hear Blaise ramble in such a way.
piece of fucking shit out there gets off on hurting people,” Potter says, a vein throbbing in the side of his neck as his grip on Draco perceptibly tightens. “I’m sorry. I’m so sorry it happened to you, you don’t deserve this. It is
No matter how well he wants this job to go, he refuses to be bullied by Harry fucking Potter. Yes, it would be the karma Draco deserves, but he’s determined to prove that he’s not the same selfish, snivelling Pureblood prick he was at Hogwarts. And there’s only so much he can take
“Young Master Black is being hurt. Young Master Black should be understanding Kreacher is not enemy, but loyal servant to The Noble and Most Ancient House of Black. Kreacher is being caring for its heirs now over 650 years, even heirs like ungrateful Young Master Black, no mattering Kreacher’s feelings.” The elf carefully approaches him, head cocked to the side.
“Don’t let it go to your head. In the meantime, why don’t we pay a visit to the Veil?” Granger quickly gets to her feet.
When Draco finally reaches the bathroom, it’s a simple, white tiled room with a clawfoot bathtub. The shelf in question does indeed have a small vial of dittany on it, as well as a plant that’s on its way to dying. Draco pauses, though, when he notices that the mirror cabinet across from him is slightly ajar.
“Oh!” Hermione says, interests clear in her voice as she tilts her head back to peer at Neville. “Sounds brilliant, Neville. What plants have you been manipulating?”
Harry nudges Draco gently so he can see his face. He tilts Draco's chin up. “We’re still married.”
Draco shakes himself. “Oh! Of course, yes,” he says, placing his cup of coffee on the road and gently taking Potter’s elbow to help him up. Potter smells like sweat and copper and honey and so much excitable magic that Draco's almost drunk from it, being this close. He bites his lower lip and tries to focus. Potter grunts in pain as he gets to his feet. It’s only then that Draco realises just how painful-looking Potter’s injuries are, his skin peeled back in several rows and bleeding across his palms. “Merlin, that looks manky, we should probably find somewhere to heal it.”
Harry starts to panic. He hadn’t expected Hermione to be so emotional about all this. They had taken his coming out very well when they’d arrived home, just as Ginny said they would. They loved him and would support him no matter what. Hermione had taken his relationship with Dean as a sign that he was finally “embracing his true self”, “letting go of past traumas”, “attempting to move on from the war”, and such.
“Wow. You sound…really healthy,” he says, a tight, worried frown crossing his face. Malfoy glowers at him. “Did you, I mean, do you, want children?”
“I love you,” Harry slurs, a delirious smile on his face. Draco makes a note that the Chinese Chomping Cabbage from the Skele-Gro probably interacts strangely with the syrup of Hellebore, heightening the slight euphoric nature of the Draught of Peace. He’ll need to look into it more or find an alternative ingredient. Harry continues undeterred. “I love you so much. Will you stay with me, forever?”
Draco wants to stay mad even though Potter has a woefully mournful look on his face. He finds he can’t. Potter may be a trained Auror, he may have read books on trauma, he may have firsthand experience with trauma, panic attacks and breathing exercises, and
. Did Harry not remember he was crying in Draco’s lap?
Potter snorts. He places the items on the desk. Draco stares at them for a long moment before fixing Potter with a quirk of an eyebrow.
“Obviously not,” Draco responds, withdrawing his hand to pick up his drink. He tries to calm his thunderous, fast heartbeat as both Potter and Smith fix their eyes on him.
“He was
He finds himself in Gedeon’s office, a file of their most recent findings tucked under his arm and a flashdrive of video documentation of the studies he’s pulled from his Cloud. It’s nearing 9 p.m., and the offices and corridors of the Ministry are dark and eerily silent. Gedeon ushers Draco into his large, lush office, thrusting a glass of amber liquid in his hand and encouraging him to sit on the sofa rather than have an office desk between them.
. Two, it’s...incredibly rare...to find a soulmate. Yes, people fall in love all the time, but this kind of compatibility, this love, it’s otherworldly, literally. The connection itself is powerful magic. You’re attuned to your partner’s magic, and as time goes on, you can
. This was not on the list at all.
Draco thrashes against Smith—wild, breathless. “
Draco swallows. He places a hand over Harry’s, removing it from his cheek. “What are you trying to say? Are you trying to—what are—what are you trying to say? Because, you’re right. It hasn’t—it hasn’t been that long, and I don’t know if I can be what you want me to—” Draco rushes out softly before Harry frees his hand to place a finger against Draco’s lips.
. It took me hours to break through the privacy wards on it, by the way.”
Draco scoffs. “You shouldn’t worry about things you don’t understand.”
And furthermore, it bothers Draco that Potter has been able to see so accurately through his shield, the only layer of protection he has between himself and the rest of the world. Potter believing he has any right to judge Draco, let alone comment on the choices Draco has made concerning his own well-being and who is privy to it, has left a bitter taste in his mouth. He glances once more at Potter only to find that their eyes meet. Draco hastily drops his gaze, but Potter has now stopped walking, the cold wave of his presence leaving Draco’s side.
Draco turns Harry’s hand over and brings it up to his lips, kissing the inside of his wrist. “Whatever it is for you, Harry, I want to be around when it happens,” Draco says, the words only slightly shaky as they pour out. It’s worth admitting it, because the way Harry lights up with a smile is so beautiful Draco has to look away for a moment, it feels too much like looking into the sun.
She looked like she was glowing, happy, and well-rested. Well, at least until they both sat down for lunch.
Harry remains silent, but his brain is trying to sort through the shock and confusion of this little known secret. He suddenly recalls something that Malfoy told him all that time ago at
“Not that, Potter. She doesn’t care about
Narcissa Malfoy arrives back to Malfoy Manor on a blistering cold Saturday morning in mid-October. Draco had had very little warning of her arrival, apparently. So little that he was still passed out from working a double shift when his mother’s house elf, Étienne, who was decked out in the prettiest green chiffon dress, popped into existence in his bedroom. It caused him quite the panic, and not even a spliff had helped him calm down afterwards.
Hermione decided on a
. He just wants to forget this happened. The attack had felt like it lasted for hours but Draco knows realistically it wasn’t more than ten minutes. Something sharp and shameful twists in the pit of his stomach.
“How come we stopped doing this?” Draco asks suddenly. “We used to mark film openings in our diaries all the time, I miss it. Even with my work at the hospital, my diary can always fit in a film with you,” Draco says, bumping his shoulder against Harry’s.
Draco glances about the room. Potter is nowhere to be found, but Pansy is curled up at the foot of the bed and Luna is sitting on a round floor cushion, slouched against the wall under his window. Draco tries to breath slowly to ease his growing anxiety, but it comes out rough. A part of him knows that Harry is probably lingering in the kitchen to avoid triggering Luna’s magical sensitivity.
“Scared of what?”
“Harry, Harry, Harry, my boy. Why do you always leave me hanging?”
“I need you.”
With every gentle brush through his hair, every flick of a strand from his forehead, every careful
But Draco thinks of what’s waiting for him if he does.
Draco nods, and Harry pushes the rest of the way in, a low, gravely groan escaping him as he rolls his hips, and Draco cries out, lifting his hips up, the angle causing Harry to slip in even further, sliding across that wonderful cluster of nerves again.
Harry scrunches up his nose. “Oh,
Bitty’s laugh is sharp as it fills the room.
Draco’s suddenly reminded of Tracey’s tear-stained face as she pushes the scroll of secrets (a term Draco has been using in his head frequently since passing it off to Potter) into his hands. His brain, in this moment, won’t let him feel the immense panic and concern that usually overcomes him when he thinks about that scroll or Tracey’s dire situation, stuck in a possibly violent marriage, carrying burdens on her shoulders that no one should have to suffer. Instead, his mind drifts, and he wonders when Theo will stop bogarting the drugs.
“What’s a soulmate to you?” Harry asks before pulling away his hand, not wanting to put Draco off by too much touching.
. You won’t because you’ll be in the holding cell next to mine. Dickhead.”
“I’m alone, I’m so alone, so
Harry’s eyes widen and his mouth slides open, utterly confused. He thinks about her flirtatious personality, her lovely long inky black hair, dark eyes, dark skin, and full sensual lips. He thinks about the Yule Ball and the many boys who followed her around.
This office is much smaller than her previous one, a desk in the centre of the room with a small box of her belonging perched on the corner of it. The lighting is bright, which works because maintenance has Granger’s office window depicting tropical-storm like conditions. Granger is seated in her chair, quietly slipping her wand up her sleeve. Draco bites back a gasp when he gets a full look of her.
“Don’t you
The look Draco sees there is all he needs to put aside every single reason why he shouldn’t accept his feelings for this man.
“Fucking hell, are you all right?” he asks, a hand pressing into the small of her back. She shakes her head, coughing, waving his concern off.
“Get the
He always does this eventually, push away well-meaning people. He’s done it especially to Pansy and Luna. Now Padma. A part of him hates himself for the cruelty that easily slips from his mouth. He rarely resorts to petty insults nowadays, finding it better to just remain indifferent and unapproachable to ward off his housemates or his colleagues’s gentle enquiries into this well-being.
Draco gazes at him and shivers. Harry’s voice is pitched low, brimming with unbridled lust that shapes Draco’s name into the embodiment of hunger itself. Draco’s hands are now tightly gripping the fabric of Harry’s shirt as his stomach floods with anxiety, his breathing becoming laboured as he bows his head.
Daphne shoots them a lazy grin.
“Because this program wasn’t her original fucking idea, Draco. It was yours. Accept some accountability.”
Potter chuckles, shooting Draco another warm smile. “Have a good night,” he says before ducking out of the office.
,” he says, his hand coming up to briefly rub the back of his neck. Now up close, he can see that Malfoy’s too-stylish haircut is a bit longer and pulled back into a bun, a few escaped strands framing his pointy face. Harry hides a snort with an ill-conceived cough. Malfoy looks like a bloody ponce.
“It doesn’t have to be today?” he asks in a tiny, unsure voice.
“No, Draco, you haven’t,” Harry says, lifting his hands up, palms facing out. “Just listen to me.”
Draco knows that Pansy is more hurt than angry. He picks up their drinks and hands one to her. “Drink up, babe,” he says, watching as she takes a long sip from her G&T. Draco chugs down about a third of his. “I didn’t know how to talk about it. Most of the time he just...made me angry. But we’ve agreed to give this...
When Draco closed up the Manor six months ago, he was sure moving in with Pansy and her mix-matched set of girlfriends would be disastrous.
Draco’s mouth slides open. “Fuck, you’re right. I have to get drinks.”
scenarios were constant material for daydreams, and more than a handful of times Draco would wake from a dream swearing he could still smell Harry, like cinnamon and amber, or felt the brush of his lips against his own, or the press of his body alongside Draco’s.
“I...I was just thinking about you and here you are,” Potter says, a curious tone attached to his words. “Isn’t that strange?”
“I don’t understand,” Draco whispers, sinking back onto his bum as he stares up at Jenkins.
Unable to avoid it much longer and in desperate need to not think about Harry every few seconds, Draco reopens the Flint dossier. After putting out an emergency cigarette, he pulls the files from the hidden hole behind an old Malfoy tapestry hanging in his office, spreading its contents across his large table as Sprinkles sprawls out on her belly at the foot of his chair.
Much like Pansy, she has foregone the ugly Christmas jumper. Harry’s heart swells with pride and appreciation looking at her — she’s wearing a gorgeous shoulder-padded, velvet emerald green jumpsuit that seems to illuminate her pale skin and short, slicked-back fiery red hair. The low neckline rivals Pansy’s, dipping to her navel. It must be magic that’s keeping the front covering her breasts. She looks terribly bored as Blaise Zabini proceeds to bark up the wrong tree. Ginny nods and sips her whisky as Zabini leans in
“After the war, I lost everything
Draco slowly approaches the table, walking around it, wide-eyed and anxious. What he sees causes him to collapse in the chair. He thought it was just him Andrews captured at the Flint property, but he was wrong. There’s pictures of Pansy stealing designer

of all people.”
“It is!” Ginny says, suddenly appearing in the kitchen, her sequined green shirt sparkling in the bright light. Pansy had surprised Ginny with a three month long vacation that involved traveling to cities all over the world after proposing to her. They were getting married next month on Christmas Eve. “Hermione, you’d be crazy not to have a glass,” Ginny says, pouring herself a helping.

. She’s always had the control, not only over Draco, but Blaise as well. Draco wonders who else Bitty has been able to manipulate into getting exactly what she wants and when she wants.
, we can go,” he says resolutely.
When Malfoy stumbles into his massive sitting room, he looks endearingly rumpled in a tattered white t-shirt and grey pyjama bottoms. His hair is all over his head and there are dark circles under his tired eyes. He jumps when he sees Harry.
“What?”
Pansy’s shark-like smile is terrifying. Draco always thought it made her look a bit murderous. But then again, she absolutely hates to be called princess.
Potter reels back so fast Draco’s surprised he doesn’t fall backwards. He quickly recovers and crosses his arms against his broad chest. “If you’re not up for Rosie’s birthday,” Potter says. “I’ll let Hermione know and we can stay in.”
“It’ll do you some good to smile so your poor mamma can be happy. She worked hard on this amazing event,” she says in a saccharine voice, a hand now resting on Draco’s elbow. He carefully pulls away. “You can at least pretend to care about orphans.” She drains the liquid with a small frown. “I hate whisky.”
Marcus leans forward, resting his hands on the table between them.
“Harry,” she starts slowly, “Are you sure you’re happy with me? Are you sure that...

She
A cough near the doorway draws Draco’s gaze away from Luna’s bright blue eyes to vibrant green ones.
Draco wants to ask her a million questions, the cold hunger in his stomach aches for it, but he sighs instead. “I’m really tired, Mia, and not particularly in the mood to discuss Harry right now. Thanks for the invitation to your party. Have a fun night out with Pansy,” he says before entering his room. He shuts the door behind him, throws up a
“When did you two fall in love?”
. But you’re bloody leaving me!” He spits angrily, crossing his arms against his chest, willing the tears and the flush of his cheeks to go away. He knows he should calm down, but
“And do what with it?”
“Whatever she says, whatever we learn...I want you to keep an open mind. Hermione is my best friend and I know she would never intentionally do anything to harm me.”
“Well, Harry. This year has been rather difficult,” she starts carefully, “and what with my impending work at the Ministry, and Ron about to start as a full Auror, we thought it would be best to take the trip now,” Hermione says as she comes to sit beside Ron on the sofa. Ron, seemingly instinctively, brushes the hair back from her face before offering her a cup of tea which she happily takes from him. He then curls his arm around her shoulders.
This was it, Draco thought. He had pushed aside his fears, his hesitation, all the little big reasons he’s been holding onto these words for the last month. The fear that he wasn’t good enough, or that this relationship was moving too fast, the words too much to say, too heavy to risk saying, too upsetting to say aloud in case it ends up hurting Draco because everything about them is meant to be adored in secret. In darkness. Too terrifying to truly feel, because some part of him believed that Harry did think he was
of love—has felt it, carried it, expressed it. If he could only send his Patronus to Harry, wherever he is, he’d know that Draco is thinking of him, and if his Patronus comes back, he’ll know that it's because Harry sent her back.
He pulls out the wand he bought in Paris: ten inches of white sycamore with dittany stalk at its core, the handle made up of intricately carved vine tendrils. The wandmaker had asked Draco if he was a healer or a caretaker due to the strength, protectiveness, and restorative nature of the wand.
Later on, as they lay wrapped around each other with the first glimpses of sunrise stretching across their naked bodies, she announced that they were somewhere near Naples. Draco hadn’t cared. He couldn’t stop thinking about how she frantically wrapped her long legs around his head, her pointed nails scraping his scalp hard enough to draw blood as he licked her from clit to anus the night before, or how she cried out when he’d fucked her against the bedroom wall, and then again on the bed when she slipped a finger in his arse right before he climaxed. It was the kind of chaotic, messy sex he had grown to absolutely love. And he hadn’t had it in a very,
“Do you know what’s real?” Harry whispers, pulling back completely, shoving the liar wearing his husband’s face away from him. “The fact that you almost killed my children,” Harry says, his voice tight. “You almost succeeded.” Harry’s hands curl into fists at his sides. “
and then comes horrible insults and laughter in a deep, posh accent, and, well, that’s all he remembers.
“I’ll be in the kitchen if you need anything,” comes Potter’s strained response.
you to death. Leave it, mate,” the girl says, tugging her friend back down. Draco wants to tell her that he’d rather eat shit than lift his wand to hurt someone. That he’s not that person anymore. That he’s a human being and deserves to be treated like one. That all he wants to do is live his life peacefully.
“Well, I’m out ten Galleons! There’s a wager going on over whether or not you’d show your face. I thought you’d stay away.”
“That’s enough, Smith!” Ginevra snaps. “Malfoy, wait, I don’t know what’s going on but you shouldn’t leave. Mia will be so hurt!”
Thanks for reading <3
“She’s
Harry’s shrivelling gaze fixes on Smith, his lips curling upward into a sneer.
Harry pulls his hand free from Draco’s, the loss of his warmth startling to Draco. He bites back a small sound of displeasure as Harry stares up at the night sky, his eyes haunted. Draco looks up as well. The stars are beautiful and infinite, the waxing gibbous nearly full and resting low in the sky.

Hermione then blinks hard, fat dollops of tears rolling down her cheeks.

and Harry’s struck speechless by just how warm and lovely this all feels as he gazes into Draco’s open, content face. There’s so much he wants to say to Draco right now: how amazing it’s been getting to know him this past year, how grateful he is to have him as his rock and his voice of reason, how beautiful he thinks he is, and how very much in love he is with him.

“Oh, good one!” Flint chuckles loudly. “I’m just having a spot of fun. And what are friends for? I’m letting you in on something that could be potentially record-breaking in terms of the winnings!”
Tears spring to his eyes as he gingerly cuts into the mass he takes a handful of. The
“Draco! Harry! Did you see my bubbles? Aren’t they pretty?” Teddy blows some bubbles in Draco’s direction, the apples of his cheeks swelling as he grins up at them.
“Let them send in a bloody search party,” Harry murmurs. Draco rolls his eyes.
Draco takes a moment to admire the beautiful grounds, his thoughts straying to the wealth and power of this family:
he was an arse when got legless. He was mortified and had sent off an apology to everyone that had attended. He’s yet to hear back from Neville, though.

“Potter! How did
Jeremy smiles. “Yes, I am. Your kind explained to me all about your secrecy thing, but claimed because they’re their own faction within your Ministry, they call their own shots, and you really, really wanted to test your little project out on a wee Muggle,” Jeremy says derisively.
“I want to be happy.”
Blaise places a consoling hand on his arm. “There was...there was a lot of casting. I saw their Auror buddies separating them before dragging them off down the corridor. That’s

was excruciating pain, an invasion of his mind and body. He had assured himself many times since the end of the war he’d never experience something so debilitating again. He would never again be owned, branded, and desecrated by someone. He had assured himself that blatant lack of control would never happen, nothing could ever hurt him the way the Dark Lord had hurt him. Now he feels as if he’s been branded a million times over. This time he doesn’t think he’ll survive it.
“As lovely as the new additions are to the Flint property, there’s nothing that that gormless family has that I want or don’t already own,” Draco says, running a hand through his hair. “I want for
“Erm, well—this played out a lot smoother in my head,” he says, chuckling nervously. He releases Ginny’s hand to fiddle with the stem of his wine glass. Ginny patiently watches him.
“Ah, I thought she would owl you a copy. She seems to have qualms over...the strenuous nature of the research,” Gedeon says stiffly. “She has decided to move on to a project less demanding of her time, considering the recent death of Harry Potter and her approaching maternity leave. And of course here at the Department of Mysteries, we understand and respect her delicate...condition.”

Draco drops his head onto Harry’s shoulder, smirking at her. “Fuck
Harry clears his throat. “I do have some news to share. We have a new case right now dealing with break-ins at Pureblood properties. Have you heard about it?”
Draco officially mentally checks out, instead tossing back several glasses of champagne despite the judgemental looks from the people sat at his table. Announcing the remaining debs flies by, as well as their first dance. He’s had enough of this farce of a happy event and he’s just tipsy enough to not care about his manners. He snorts and jeers as certain couples pass by him. He can tell that half of these débutante are high off their rockers, Bitty included. Since the end of the first dance, Blaise has been shooting him short, nervous glances from across the ballroom.
“Hello, Jenkins,” Draco says slowly, taking a few steps back from the man.
No harm in using it, right?
He doesn’t know, but he does know that if he’s not careful, this feeling may very well sink him, and Draco doesn’t think he’ll survive feeling

Recognition crosses Pansy’s face as she takes the spliff away from Draco, tucking it into the corner of her plump lips for her turn to puff away at. Draco wonders how her lungs haven’t burnt up yet. “Oh, yes. She was quite fit, wasn’t she?”
“He doesn’t care.”
“Right…” Draco drawls. He doesn’t know what Potter is talking about really, so instead he surveys his surroundings. For a Monday night, the place is incredibly busy. There’s a number of men gathered at the bar, loud and happy as they clink their pints together. The music is poppy and loud. Potter gestures towards a curved staircase near the back of the pub.
Draco hugs himself around his middle, rocking back and forth as he stares up at Harry, a pain twisting in his chest at the sight. He sobs quietly now as he struggles to his feet, swaying as his head feels light and his throat burns from his cries. Draco rolls his shoulders back, unclenching his hands and bringing them forward, touching the tips of his fingers as he closes his eyes. He’s terrified, but he knows he has to do this.
Smith slaps Draco across the face before tugging him forward. Draco cries out, once again struggling to free himself from Smith’s brutish grasp. “
Pansy jumps into his lap then, her excitement bubbling as she shoots him a pleased smile.
Instead, there’s the press of Blaise at his back, arms wrapped around Draco’s waist, and the soft perfumed scent of Pansy’s shampoo, her back against Draco’s front, hair tickling his nose. He blinks several times, trying to calm his riotous nerves as he pieces together the last twenty-four hours.
“Merlin,” Draco mutters, shaking his head, making his way towards the Wizengamot Courtrooms. He feels like he has whiplash.
“Why are you helping him?” she barks. He ignores her and instead turns Malfoy onto his back to assess his other wounds when two strong pairs of hands clamp down on his shoulders, attempting to pull him away from Malfoy. Harry snaps his head up to glare at the two older wizards from the mob manhandling him.
“Yes. And then the love of my life asked me to marry him.”
He then instructs them to drape an emergency blanket over the man, irritated that they’ve kept him naked this entire time. He then has them turn him onto his side before stablising him with a Full Body-Bind. The man’s eyes are still bulging but the vomiting has eased, just a small steady stream of the dark substance flows from his mouth to the widening puddle. It takes Draco a couple of tries before he can cast a Protection Charm around the puddle, and even longer to conjure a tube with a stopper, the pain in his arm causing him to mess up the appropriate wand movement. Another spell, and he’s able to siphon some of the thick vomit. Even trapped within the vial the liquid slams against the glass, as if trying to break free. Draco grimaces, having never seen anything quite like it. After adding several strong Protection Charms around it, he slips it into a DMLE evidence bag.
“You’re a scary bore, then.”
Padma is already at her station, typing on her computer before taking a look at her own samples under their newest electron microscope. Goldstein is now exiting from the small breakroom in the very back of the laboratory. He pauses under the air-sterilising vent right off the room before coming back into the laboratory and shoots Draco a nervous smile. Instead of coming towards him for a proper greeting, he veers off and tucks himself away into the far corner of the lab. Draco rolls his eyes. His newest lab assistant, Astoria Greengrass, is perched at her station reading. Draco doesn’t approach her. She’s studious and extremely determined to pull her weight in the lab, so he leaves her to it and only checks in for reviews at the end of the day.
,” Harry hisses, his hand now crushing Draco’s.
each other now! I always knew you two were destined to be together,” Luna whispers against his ear.
“Is that all this is? Shagging?” Draco asks. The grin on Blaise’s face falls away.
Even though it’s dark out and the trampoline is positioned quite far from the house, Harry heavily disillusions the both of them and throws up a Silencing Charm so they don’t draw attention to themselves.
Eventually, he nods and gets to his feet, ready to escape everything about this encounter that he simply can’t begin to understand. In the end, there really was no choice.
“What, you’re not going to tell me that’s not what you wanted, are you Potter?” Draco asks smugly.
Draco rolls his eyes, but can’t help the tug of a smile on his lips. “You know what I mean.”
Andrews steps in closer to Draco, his chin tilting up. Draco quickly assesses who would win if it came down to a duel. Andrews is much bulkier than Draco’s lithe form, and could easily win if it came down to fisticuffs, but Draco has agility on his side, and could probably draw his wand faster than the Auror…
Gedeon clearly doesn’t know how scientific studies work, Draco thinks as he slips into Granger’s office, quietly shutting the door and throwing up a Silencing Charm just in case.
from him. If Draco’s feeling insecure about their relationship, Merlin knows Potter must be as well, especially after their most recent row about moving in together. Draco sighs as he runs his knuckles down Potter’s brawny chest and taut stomach, courtesy of his Auror training. “I’m awfully fond of you, as well,” he whispers, his hand now coming up to run his fingers through the hair at the nape of Potter’s neck. He leans forward the couple of inches between them to press his lips against Potter’s—they’re dry and his breath is still minty from brushing his teeth. They kiss gently, but soon Draco’s mouth opens under Potter’s as his tongue slides across his bottom lip. Potter growls as his arm tightens around him, tugging him forward so he’s now resting half his weight on the other man. The kiss becomes heated, his breath catching in his throat, a moan escaping from him against Potter’s mouth as Potter slips a hand under the thin material of his shirt to caress his hot skin. Draco’s fingers are tightening in his hair when Potter’s mouth stops moving against his.
“Why don’t you just tell him?”
He’s turned Harry’s rooftop into a grotto of sorts, equipped with spiraling flowerbeds and a nice-sized waterfall pond Draco keeps his beloved koi fish in. In the centre of the garden is a magically widened iron-wrought sun lounge with thick, soft padding. When Draco finishes removing the weeds, he pulls his gloves off, places them in his gardening toolbox before making his way towards the edge of the rooftop. His hands grip the railing as he stares out across Islington. To think, just a year ago he stood on a rooftop and wondered what it would be like to just...jump. What a difference a year makes.
The fluorescent lights of this hole-in-the-wall Lebanese shop sting his eyes after being in such a dark nightclub for so long. He’s completely pissed and nauseous as Malfoy pays for three kofta wraps and an order of cheesy chips. He doesn’t really register Malfoy shoving him into a chair, the plastic table in front of him jostling as Malfoy tosses their food onto its surface. Pansy immediately grabs one of the sandwiches, carefully peeling back the aluminum foil before wrapping her painted black lips around the piping hot pitta. Malfoy then slides into the seat beside him, pulling his own wrap towards him and unwrapping it. Harry watches in rapture as Malfoy daintily rips a piece off with his long fingers and shoves it gracelessly into his mouth, eyes fluttering shut as he moans around the pita and kofta meat in his mouth.
“Yeah, but in a good way. You’re a firm believer in ‘there’s a time and place for everything.’”
“Yeah. I’m an Auror. I have missions. Tracey happens to be a witness that I’m working with and she unfortunately wasn’t able to hand over a really important document. I’m sorry she had to involve you to get it over to me, but I really do appreciate it. I wasn’t able to explain myself better the last time we chatted. Sorry,” Potter says with a shrug.
For a moment, Draco’s eyes turn incredibly bright as he exhales a phlegmy breath before his gaze shutters. Harry sits on the opposite side of the board, staring down at it as Draco takes one trembling hand to move his black bishop to E5. Harry sighs.
. But come what may, Draco’s going to let it happen, let these words finally slip free.
“Sorry.” Malfoy gives him a small, quizzical frown.
, when his heart stutters against his ribcage.
“I’m sorry,” Harry croaks, rubbing soothing circles into Teddy’s back. “I’m so sorry.”

Granger crosses her arms against her chest, an air of impatience about her. “You want to put people who are already traumatised and grieving in front of an artefact that is a magical manifestation of a one-way trip to the land of the dead from the land of the living. You bet your arse I’m involving our Head of Department, regardless of my personal opinions about him. I may be the point-of-contact after Gedeon as his Deputy, but I’m not foolish enough to take this project on by myself.
“But don’t you remember what it was like waking up together? Or how passionate we were together that night? Don’t you miss it? Don’t you ever think about it?” she asks, her voice quickening as her eyes flash with a manic gleam. “We were so good together. It was so, so good. You could have that again, even better this time because—”
Harry shoots Draco a commiserating look. He didn’t ask Draco to quit his job as a Financial Analyst at Gringotts a year ago to help with Teddy, but he insisted and for a whole year home-schooled him. Draco wanted to continue to home-school Teddy, but Gringotts had convinced him to agree to a part-time position which allowed him to work from home and only come in once a month – they missed his brilliant mind terribly. They were both trying to make this whole parenting thing work—and

“I was mostly tasked with filling out paperwork. I have a heap of research to do when I get back to the office. I sat in while the Wizengamot sent a few people away to Azkaban, which was a surreal experience.”
“Are you okay?” she asks, a small concerned frown playing at the corners of her mouth.

bat-bogey Ginny sent his way a couple of weeks after his accidental voyeurism as punishment. He had passed out from the force of it, face-planting into his shepherd's pie. Ginny then had the audacity to take a picture of his pie-covered face, which is now permanently stuck to the cold cabinet in the kitchen. But,
…child. We’re simply not used to such a different, creative little boy at Little Angels.”
Then, Harry pulls back to look into Draco’s eyes, his thumb grazing Draco’s cheek once more before his hand slides to the nape of his neck, drawing him in to pepper more soft, close-lipped kisses on him, a soft hum of pleasure escaping him.
I thought you were making breakfast not burning it, mate!”
Draco smiles smugly at him over steepled hands, apparently satisfied with Harry’s grief and embarrassment. “Well, Potter, I wouldn’t worry too much, I’m sure you’ll be utterly forgotten. Maybe it’s time for you to rethink your dating habits,” Draco says, affecting a casual tone. “Not every person you go on a date with will be the one nor will they be someone you should sleep with. Tea?” he asks, making a move to stand.
“Why, the evil that’s infiltrated the Ministry since the end of the war, Sir,” Draco says casually.
Simmons strolls to the centre of the courtroom, his pristine black robes swishing about his legs as he turns about the room.

“I mean it. I knew we were heading somewhere bad, Draco, but I didn’t want it to end where and how it did.”
“We’re lucky to have had two skilled rangers on board,” the coast guard says.
With a flick of her wand, the lights glow warm and amber, illuminating the large, tastefully-decorated bedroom.
“Mr Malfoy. If I may interrupt you there. If Auror Potter is willing to present these findings as a credible, investigated source, we may be able to get this case thrown out due to prejudice within the Wizengamot.”
Draco clicks through the files. Everything he needs is there. Proof of consent forms from the participants involved, all their information on the potions, their methodologies, the documentation of the trapped participants and the research they were conducting around it, and video footage.
Malfoy places one hand on either side of Harry’s hips. “Is this okay?” he asks in Harry’s ear. All he can do is nod as Malfoy then moves Harry’s hips from side-to-side, following the rhythm of the song. Harry closes his eyes briefly, allowing the music, the alcohol, and Malfoy’s hands to lead his movements.
“Harry, I’m sorry. I know it’s New Year’s Eve and I know that you’re feeling lonely, but you just can’t show up here and tell me you love me and expect that to make all that you’ve done go away. I mean, really Harry, what am I supposed to say? ‘Oh wow, that’s awesome, let’s ride off into the sunset together?’ It doesn’t fucking work that way!”
“Of all the coffee joints in all the towns in all the world, Potter, you walk into mine,” Malfoy drawls, voice slightly strained and acerbic. Malfoy looks a little bit sick suddenly as he runs a hand through his overlong fringe.
Hermione’s called him hot-headed and irrational so many times in the last week that it’s starting to sound like a bloody mantra. Hermione’s sigh brings his attention back to her.
Milton is standing on the dais, head bent over what suspiciously looks like Draco’s leatherbound notebook. The Chamber is still and quiet. Next to Milton, Draco recognises Mr Graham, strapped to a chair and dressed in a standard medical gown. The man looks heavily drugged, slouched over as his body leans to the left and his head bobs, as if he’s trying to stay conscious.
“It’s Dean, he’s right over there, coming right at me,” Harry whispers when he finally finds his voice.
Harry shrugs, his legs spreading wider under the table. “Who said anything about wit? But yeah, I reckon so,” he says, swallowing down more of his drink. Draco harrumphs.
Draco’s beloved curry goes skittering across the hardwood floor as soon as they enter Grimmauld’s sitting room. Harry, not yet registering the ear-piercing wails sounding off around him, opens his mouth to yell at Draco for ruining their lunch when his eyes finally lock on the scene before him. His jaw drops.
He doesn’t want the night to end just yet.
“It’s fine,” Harry says slowly, still taken aback by the man’s good looks. Was this man Malfoy’s

and laughter that wants so desperately to bubble up his throat. Queensbury is still on the floor groaning, so Harry decides a quick disillusionment charm will do the trick in sneaking out.
“So. What’s it like?”
“Oh,” he says quietly, trying to keep his voice even as he says, “I’m sorry to hear that you two broke up. You er, didn’t mention it.”
“So is that a yes?” Harry calls out. Malfoy continues towards the exit, but does turn around briefly to send him a two-finger salute before leaving.
“Leave him alone, Zach, please,” Harry begs, his hand reaching out to touch Smith’s arm. Smith stares down at Harry’s hand before his gaze flicks up.
I’m not continuing this conversation,” Harry bursts out wildly, tossing his now-empty glass on the table and quickly getting to his feet. Blood rushes to Draco’s head, making him feel startlingly clear-headed as the flood of adrenaline courses through him. He nearly falls out of his seat to lunge at Harry.
He’s fucked up. He’s
Maybe a fortnight ago Draco would have bought into those suspicions, but now? It can’t possibly be true. The way Harry looks at him, how he touches him, how he encourages him—there’s no way Harry is faking his feelings for him.
Pansy places a quelling hand on his elbow, pulling out her wand from her frilly red thigh-holster to hit him with a minty, refreshing cleansing charm.
“You love it.” Potter leans in to place a soft kiss in his hair. His chest is a warm presence against his back.
Draco interrupts him. “We ended things mutually and on very good terms. Oliver is a good sort. He even offered top-tier tickets for his upcoming match. I just couldn’t stay with him if my heart wasn’t in it, much less fuck him. Fuck, it’s hot in here,” he groans. Draco’s rambling is not lost on him and it’s then that he begins to suspect that maybe Draco’s
“Just stop!” Harry says sharply, making Draco flinch. “You don’t have to bloody explain a single thing! I’ve been profiling you. I

, Harry. Don’t make me hate you when loving you is already painful.”
“Well, that’s easy. Hermione Granger-Weasley. I saw her sign the papers myself, actually. Head Auror Robards caught me lingering in the corridor and asked me to lead her up from the morgue to the Admin’s office so she could take care of the paperwork,” Jenkins says proudly, puffing up his chest. “Poor thing was in tears the whole way up. I thought she was going to pop that baby out right then and there in the lift, she was crying so much. Apparently, she was listed as his Case of Emergency Person.”
“Do you have the proper forms and Potter’s signature?” Draco asks, sitting back in his chair.
...Well. I’m going to go make a pot of coffee. Pansy’s an absolute beast in the morning without it. Feel free to see yourself out of my house,” Malfoy says with a shake of his head, shuffling on bare feet towards his kitchen.
“I don’t fucking
Draco belatedly realises that she’s leading him towards the Abbott’s main property entrance.
Harry shoves him hard, and Draco moves out the way. “Fuck you! Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you!” Harry growls as he shoves Smith.
Pansy leans in. “If he weren’t your soulmate, I would be plotting his demise right now,” she laughs.
“I don’t

“You were quite the sight, Han, couldn’t help but notice you during our first year,” he said sweetly. He wrapped an arm around his fiancée’s shoulders.
“Shh, you did so well,” Harry now whispers into his ear. “Let me take care of you. Sleep now. I’ll watch over you. I’ll always watch over you.”
, it’s
One of Smith’s cronies is searching Harry’s pockets, coming across his wand and tossing it aside. Harry thrashes against the Bind, a roar of anger escaping him, tears in his eyes as he stares at Draco.
He’s too sick and too high to form the right words to ease away the look of concern on Harry’s face. There’s a moment of silence between them and Draco decides this is the time to turn on his heel to leave, but Harry’s hand on his elbow stops him.
of me. And still wants me despite all the broken bits.”
Millie steps forward. “I can promise from all of us that we’ll only search and take the Invisibility Cloak, Draco. Are you sure Potter doesn’t have any elves? It’s not like he has a home away from London,” Millie says, her concern written across her face.

And although he’s trying to regain the weight he’s lost since the attack, the sinewy definition he’d worked so hard on in the past is gone. He bites his lip, wanting to tear his eyes away from the grotesque thing in the mirror. “Look at you,” Potter says. “You’re beautiful.”
Glancing down, right beside the bag, the initials
Draco peels himself away from the sink to yank the door open. Harry looks concerned standing there in his ghastly green polyester polo and fitted black trousers. Draco almost wants to laugh at how ridiculous he looks at such an event, but instead he steps back and lets Harry into the small loo, watching as the other man shuts the door behind him.
use my anxiety as a means to dismiss me or my very valid concerns.”
“Are you sure, Shafiq?” Madame Odgen shouts from the back of the benches. “Your family should be under investigation!”
Draco searches their faces before peering at the crowd. Theo and Millie haven’t arrived yet, and Pansy, his mother, and Dany are swamped with Society ladies crowing over the decorations for the event. He’s alone and already knows that this event will be officially boring. No one will bother him. It’s the perfect opportunity to get lost in Blaise and Bitty’s world for a few hours.
Draco lifts his hand up to Blaise’s lips. “She’s a heavy sleeper,” Draco tries to say, but the words come out gnarled and slurred. Draco shakes his head, trying to clear it. He’s only vaguely aware of Blaise moving around the bed, shaking Pansy until she wakes.
“You don’t mean it,” Draco growls, his hand tightening around the handle of his wand, still posed and ready to strike. Harry bows his head. “You’re trying to fuck with my head, Potter. I won’t let you do this to me.”
He had tried touching his cock a couple weeks ago on a night Potter stayed at Grimmauld. The act of touching his flaccid dick had sent him into a panic, and this had left him feeling sorry for himself. He had realised he is an outsider to this body, now merely just a visitor residing in a place that’s foul and foreign.
Draco has wondered why this is. At first he thought it was because Harry hated Blaise, but Draco doesn’t see anyone interacting with Harry but Mia. Or Smith. Granted, there was just that first night he paid close attention to Harry’s interactions. He spent the second time mostly in the beer garden. Draco would have to ask Blaise, now entering the sitting room with a floating silver tray containing nine glass shots.
When Harry continues to shout, Smith screams out in frustration. “Shut him the fuck up!” he snarls at his friend, who scrambles to do so, dropping his wand.
“Oh? It’s hitting you already? Eh, don’t worry, it’s just a little something to help take the edge off.”
Pansy nods sagely. She picks up the spliff Draco turned off, bringing it to her lips to blow on the scorched tip to reignite it in an impressive display of wandless and nonverbal magic. She draws in the smoke. “Yes,
Draco met Saeed during the last year of his LLM program at the prestigious Merlin’s School of Wizarding Law in Central London. Saeed was the professor on Draco’s module, Advanced Negotiation: Criminal Context. Even though Draco was top of his class, plenty of his peers still considered him ‘that evil ex-Death Eater’ and generally refused to work with him or invite him to study groups. In a sea of hostility, Saeed’s tutelage, friendship, and ultimately his love, had been a breath of fresh air during a tough time. He had breathed life back into Draco. They spent most of their nights wrapped around each other, poring over texts, discussing the mechanics and moralities of Wizard law. Saeed would tell Draco often just how brilliant he thought he was. It was lovely.
Blaise scoffs.
No. He doesn’t think about it until he’s in their bedroom later that evening, searching for his favourite oversized jumper to combat some of the chill of Grimmauld, as the house never seems to hold a Warming Charm or allow a proper charm to hold on the caster. It’s bloody June and there’s still a draft in the place. His frustration builds as he pushes around the stuff in the drawers looking for it. He slams it shut, hands coming up to grip his hair. It’s supposed to be in the fucking top drawer. He knows he’s being irrational. It’s just a bloody jumper, but it isn’t here, where he knows he

“Is this your handwriting?” Draco glances up at Potter who nods. “You were investigating our project.”
Draco groans. “Not today, Bitty. Not right
He may have been too cowardly to respond to Harry’s letters after that first year, but he kept a scrapbook of clippings from various papers about Harry’s life. Draco was relieved to discover Harry left the Aurors to teach DADA at Hogwarts. Draco always believed Harry would never be able to heal properly if he always surrounded himself with criminals.
Draco’s eyes meet vibrant green.
Immediately, Malfoy’s cheeks turn pink, his mouth sliding open in an ‘o’ shape as he stares at Harry as if he’s grown a second head.
“As exciting as this reunion has been, I just have under an hour now, darling. We should go,” Draco says wearily, wiggling away from Bart’s embrace to take a step towards the entrance of the coffee shop.
“Draco, you
Harry shivers, mindlessly and wandlessly casting the necessary cleansing and protection charms between them as he rubs his face against Draco’s erection, breathing in his musk as he buries his nose in the slightly darker hair at the base of his cock.
“A lot of people, apparently,” says a voice from the door. Harry stands framed in the doorway, still in last night’s blood-stained clothing, knuckles split and bruised.
“Of course,” Draco says, his brows knitting together. “And Ginevra? You stayed with her knowing you weren’t in love with her.”
,” Draco garbles as Blaise tugs his sweat-soaked shirt over his head and Pansy throws open their balcony doors. A soft, cool breeze caresses Draco’s bare chest, the pain in his stomach lessening, and for a moment he’s reminded of his and Harry’s entwined bodies, sweaty from making love and cooling down under the early spring air pouring in from their opened windows. In the deep recesses of Draco’s muddling mind, he knows what’s happening to him.
“I want in on your personal notations for this case, Malfoy. Potter is my partner after all.”
The crude question hangs between them and Draco stares at him, his mouth slightly open and his eyes furiously cold. Draco then, very carefully, steps up to him, using his few inches in height against Harry as he glares down at him, breathing heavily through his nostrils.
Draco’s lip further curls into a twisted grimace at the memory of the three of them standing in the foyer of Bitty’s villa in Rome, ready to head back to London as Blaise pulled out the ring and said, “I suppose this is what you want, even though you fucked this arsehole.”
“Don’t be ridiculous,” Draco says, stepping down to stand beside him.
Blaise sighs. “Talking to Pansy is like talking to a bloody wall for me right now, in case you haven’t noticed. I promise you, if asking her wouldn’t result in me being maimed, I would do it. Now, please. Come join us at the table.” Blaise gestures sweepingly down the hall.
Malfoy also hasn’t uttered a single word to anyone—not staff or other patients—for over two years.
, he looks beautiful.
“No.” Harry pulls back, sitting up a bit straighter as he looks up. Draco drops his hands into his own lap as Harry unravels his arms from his waist and instead places a palm on each side of Draco’s face, holding him steady as he stares up into his eyes. “You didn’t do this. Some evil, disgusting monster took our beautiful boy from us, not you. You loved Scorpius, don’t you ever regret giving birth to him, or giving him absolute joy for the short amount of time we had him. Don’t ever—don’t ever hate yourself for loving your son unconditionally.”

“Getting off?” Draco gasps out against his mouth.
“Probably the Shafiq’s as well,” Theo says.
Potter is on him in a second, his arms wrapping around him to hold him close. He’s warm and strong and Draco feels safe in his arms. Sometimes he can’t believe just how quickly he allowed himself to be swept up into Potter’s embrace. But, after not feeling pure joy or, dare he even speculate,

Pansy’s face pales as she nods, her hand on the front doorknob. “You better Floo-call me later, Draco.”
A sharp indignation shoots through Draco, even though he’s being held onto the tips of his toes in Smith’s grasp, his hands wrapped around Smiths, where the fabric of Draco’s shirt is twisted around the base of his neck, making a full breath difficult. “Harry will always be a million times more the man that you are, condition and all. You know that, and you can’t stand it,” Draco warbles, triumphant when Smith’s eyes flash with anger.
Draco freezes.

Harry takes a bite from his plate, looking contemplative as he uses his free hand to shuffle through his case notes, pulling one parchment onto his lap to gaze down at. “Well, I’ve been building a profile on this person with Padma and Sarah’s input. I’d wager the contents of my vault that the offender is a Pureblood. Probably disenchanted by the circumstances of their life post-war. Like what Fitzgerald talks about, nothing will ever be the same for the character. The beauty is lost for Gloria. Maybe our offender feels like these Purebloods celebrating their perfect post-war life are trying to preserve something that should just die—stay dead—I don’t know. It’s just a thought,” Harry says with a shrug, tossing the parchment away from him before taking another bite.
“Potter… are you going to properly take my statement anytime soon or is this conversation going to be about Kneazles?”

“Absolutely,” he says, digging into his meal with renewed gusto.
…” Draco says, his heart in his throat as he turns as much as he can to look into Harry’s face. “I’m sorry...I thought...I was this...dark
“Bloody hell, I don’t know what we’re doing, I don’t know why–” The rest of his sentence dies in his throat. Dean’s hands are reaching out and this time Harry doesn’t back away.
Harry rationalised. The last seventeen years of a loving marriage, and kids, and Quidditch matches, and vacations, and birthdays, and Christmases and laughter and immeasurable joy meant they were now protected from unimaginable crimes against them. No. Things like this don’t happen to people like them.
When her original piece had caught the attention of the
“What was it?”
“Planet of the Apes?” George repeats, with a quirk of his lips. “He already said it was a bloody baby, how does Planet of the Apes factor in to that?” Angelina giggles beside him.
It’s been two days since the night at the Leaky, and Draco is still reeling from his humiliation. He locked himself in his bedroom the day after, the reality of his new life in Britain finally sinking in. He had answered Pansy’s panic-stricken questions through the door for the entire two days he was barricaded inside. She pulled information from Draco with such a methodical ease that Draco had found himself becoming emotional when he told her about Finnegan upending his pint over his head. At the time, it hadn’t affected him so much, but thinking back on it, talking about it, the wave of embarrassment mixed with his anguish overwhelmed him to tears.
In three strides, Harry reaches it. He grips the creature’s upper arms and hauls it up before slamming it against the wall so hard the back of the creature’s head bounces off of it.
At approximately 5pm Harry exits the asylum, briefcase in one hand and car keys in the other. When he passes by one of the gnarled oak trees, he notices Draco leaning against it, blowing tendrils of smoke from his cigarette. Harry slows down to watch him.
Draco rolls his eyes. “Right, because of all the fawning adoration.”
Draco throws his free hand up in the air. “Gaydar! Gaydar! What
,” he scoffs. Draco watches as Potter’s jovial face shifts into a hard, dark expression. Potter glowers at him and Draco feels a crackle of magic surround them. His heart slams against his ribcage as the feeling washes over him and he shivers, equal parts alarm and desire flooding him. It’s a feeling he’s not unfamiliar with when Potter has emotional outbursts about being called the Saviour or The Boy Who Lived. Draco usually embraces the fit with a bout of lust, but right now, he approaches it with trepidation. He doesn’t understand the mix of emotions surging through him. Draco used to like playing fast and loose teasing him about it, he’s never been so cagy over Potter’s reaction to it. It’s not like Potter will hurt him.
of me,” he spat, his voice slightly shaking. The curtains rattled in retaliation for a moment, but otherwise remained perfectly still.
A shiver runs through Draco at Potter’s explanation. “
come home.”

“I’ve been texting and calling you today,” Draco says rather hollowly, stepping fully into the room. “But then again, I’ve been doing that for over a week with little to no response.”
Harry had nearly forgotten the intensity of Draco’s full attention, the vibrant shades of grey in his eyes, the elegant shape, and beautiful long lashes. He had tried to bury just how painfully similar his eyes were to Scorpius’s, the only child to carry them. He would have a reminder of his son right here, and Harry was no longer afraid of that truth.
Harry laughs. “You don’t say. Merlin, I’m so sorry, your highness. Should I have used a refreshing charm so as not to overwhelm your delicate palate? I didn’t mean to—”
“Oi. Harry, mate–” Seamus starts crossly, but Parkinson gives a sharp, cruel little laugh and places a placating hand on Seamus’s shoulder, eyes bright with amusement.
“A solid month, mate.”
“Oh, bugger off with your judgemental bollocks,” Harry says, peering into the busy restaurant. He can see Sanaa standing behind the till chatting up a customer, her long straight black hair and open face enticing as she laughs. It had been a one-off with the beautiful woman and he wasn’t inclined to pick up where they left off. Harry’s trying to be more thoughtful about who he picks up nowadays. His one-nighters phase was on hold again, at least for a while. He’s ready to try his hand at a proper relationship again.
“—we talked about it for a long time, and I said, ‘this is what I want...what I
Tired of being gawked at, Draco takes his glass and slides off the stool, deciding to finally check out the Leaky’s beer garden. He rounds the bar, nodding stiffly at everyone sitting at Blaise’s table and scurrying off before Blaise plucks up the courage to ask him to join them. There’s a narrow hallway that leads to the loos and the side entrance to the pub. A little wooden sign stating “beer garden” in looping white handwriting hangs on the door. The door itself is black, its jamb painted yellow, heart-shaped vines twisting around lemon-coloured fairy lights framing the door. Draco pulls a face at the blatant Hufflepuff-ness of the decor and turns the doorknob.
“Merlin, that was so much fun!” Bitty babbles, turning to peer back at him. “Wasn’t that fun, Draco? I told you it would be. Didn’t I tell you? You should listen to me more often. I always have the best suggestions. I tell Blaise this all the time, poor bastard finally gave in, though, didn’t he? I told him this’ll be a night he’ll never forget. Who knows, maybe we’ll even do this again!”
“I think every successful relationship needs to start with a friendship. I can honestly say I’m in love with my best mate,” Ron said, the tips of his ears going pink.
“Harry, you’re not making sense. Oliver is great! I always thought you respected him,” Hermione says in disappointment as she gives a little chastising shake of her head.
He takes a deep breath before smiling sardonically. “As sure as I’ll ever be.”
When Draco finally comes down from his orgasm, he bursts into tears, collapsing on top of Potter. Potter scrambles under him in a panic but Draco grips Potter’s shoulders. “What’s the matter? Shit, Draco, did I hurt you?” Draco draws in a stuttering breath.
Draco can feel his heart racing, a cold anxiety washing over him at Smith’s words. “Harry…” Draco whispers. “Harry...please…” Draco wants to tell him to protect himself, to cast a
“Excellent Auror Potter,” Robards says with a nod. “I hope you all heard your tasks? This taskforce is off to a brilliant start under Potter’s lead, and just as a reminder, if there are any pressing queries, Auror Potter is Lead on this. If he’s unavailable, please direct your questions to Junior Prosecutor Malfoy."
Had he actually done enough?
It doesn’t.
“Hello, Lyra! Can you please inform Harry of this message: I’m running late. Stall Blaise’s ire by buying everyone a round of drinks. Tell him I’ll bloody pay for the ceremony myself if my lateness is such a huge impact to his question! Okay, that was mean. I feel awful enough so don’t scold me! There we go, darling. No need for a response!” Draco says, watching as she takes off down the road.
Harry’s silent for a moment. “You are

“I always have time when it comes to my friends. I especially have time when it comes to Draco,” Potter says, spreading his knees further apart in a casual display of relaxed machismo, taking a sip from his whisky. Draco ducks his head to hide the smile creeping across his face.
The doors to the lift finally slam open and they step inside the crowded space. Harry resigns himself to the quiet ride even though he wants to ask Draco more questions about the little girl in yellow. He’s surprised when Draco nudges him with an elbow to draw his attention.
, even as a painful spread of heat breaks across his skin, feeling like an exposed nerve of a broken tooth, sharp and unrelenting. It’s maddening. Upsetting. It’s still not enough.
“Okay,” he says firmly, and he means it. Something shifts inside him. The ball of gloom that’s been lodged in his chest for ages now feels a tiny bit smaller. He draws in a breath and releases it, strong and messy, and watches as it causes the hair across Potter’s forehead to flutter. The unspoken promise in his words must come across clearly because Potter shoots him a beautiful, if not watery, smile. Green eyes search his grey before Potter kisses his forehead, whispering how much he loves him, how sorry he is, how he’s here for him.
” Draco lowers their clasped hands to the space between them on the sofa.
“So, er, sorry. I promised myself I’d be less of an arsehole this year, and I would say not enquiring after the crying person in the loo is a pretty arsehole thing to do.”
“You’re pale as a ghost and you look like you’re about to faint. It’s this Muggle shite Longbottom’s got us smoking,” Theo says, shrugging his shoulders. “Or maybe you’re finally sickened by Potter?” he adds hopefully. “You deserve love, Draco, and I just can’t see Potter giving that to you.”

“Oh, please. I offered you up like cattle to the Dark Lord, the least you could do is call me Pansy.”
Harry and Draco share a look. Harry has to bite back his sneer as he clears his throat. “Would he make a promising applicant because of his two dads…or because one of his dad’s is of mixed heritage…or both?” Draco coughs loudly to hide his guffaw before he takes a sip from his drink.
Draco leans into the touch, craving the soothing gentleness of it. Harry’s gaze is so warm, and Draco doesn’t deserve to be looked at like this. Harry leans in to press his lips softly against his.
The road ahead of them will be difficult. They’ll learn how to carry their love for their son within them. There will be many more nights of tears and screaming and misunderstandings
, Happy Christmas Eve,” Draco says cheerfully, pulling her in for a kiss on the cheek. “Is that eggnog in your glass?” he teases, tapping her wrist. Pansy scoffs as she turns up her nose.
“What are they here for?”
“Yeah, tell me about it,” he grumbles, staring off into the distance. London is slowly waking up around him and the street is already busy with equally grumpy people.
,” Bitty whimpers, her head falling against Draco’s chest. “Don’t stop.”
What the f—”
Draco fidgets in his seat, feeling a bit overwhelmed by Potter’s concern. He doesn’t know why the other man gives a toss about what’s happening to him.
“No, no, sorry,” he says hastily, replacing the remote on the stand.
Draco becomes rigid in Theo’s armchair. There’s a flopping sensation in the pit of his stomach as he stares out into the bored, unbothered eyes of his friends. Pansy continues to lounge on the chaise, breaking her gaze from his to fix instead on the ceiling. Theo eases his way onto the floor in front of his infamous round, glass coffee table, sectioning off long thin lines of cocaine as Millie moves to rest her head in his lap.
“Always of you. Dying. You’re a terrible person,” Jeremy says, twisting the knife. Draco cries out, jerking forward, his hand coming up to squeeze Jeremy’s shoulder, the other digging into Jeremy’s hand, trying to loosen his hold on the handle of the knife and failing.
Harry would hurt another person without cause, especially defenceless, even if they are a suspect.
Draco’s stomach plummets like always when he recognises the smell. He pushes the thought to the back of his mind and makes his way to the laboratory, just beyond the fountain. As he swings open the glass door, his team member Justin Finch-Fletchley comes rushing up to him.
Draco shivers.
He throws himself across the bed, sinking into the soft fabric, the mattress encircling him like a hug from an old friend. If he pretends hard enough he can smell the sharp citrusy scent of Saeed’s aftershave. He pulls a pillow into his arms, curling around it to hold against his chest, trying to recall the last happy memory he has of them before their relationship became botched.
“I may have to talk to him.”
Narcissa sighed, her eyes forlorn as she stared out of the glass panel in the Malfoy conservatory, surrounded by beautiful, exotic flowers. “Learn how to heal together,” Narcissa said softly. “I know this is not something you’d care to hear, or even believe, but Lucius and I are soulmates. I admit that my love for him is so strong that I’d willingly follow him into war...and though I have many regrets, loving Lucius is not one of them. I know my husband will not be the same when he leaves that god awful prison. Every note he sends, every stolen moment I have with him at Azkaban, it’s becoming very clear that my husband is not the man he was before going into that place. That is our curse and our penance for the crimes we have committed. It will be my job,
“Damn right I am. Be it on your own head if you ever forget,” she chuckles.
,” Jenkins starts sceptically. “
“—I was quite concerned. Why didn’t you report it?”
Harry nods, currently distracted as he searches his writing desk for his favourite quill. He had finally caved to the Ministry’s appeal for Auror recruits, and Harry had started the process of attending lectures, taking notes, and doing practical field work. But he found himself enjoying it. He has a knack for Auror work, even with his limited training.
Careless.”
Draco bites Harry’s lip, hard, his teeth breaking the delicate skin at Harry’s resounding gasp as Draco wraps his arms around Harry’s neck, his hands cradling the back of Harry’s head, fingers sprawled in his hair. The thought that he can touch Harry so intimately is thrilling.
“We do not,” Draco protests. “We’ll probably never cross paths again.” Draco sighs.
“Yes, Harry. There are times and places for such things.”
“Yes, I can see that,” Harry snaps. He fixes Malfoy with his best imitation of Hermione’s no-nonsense glare he’s been desperately trying to master over the years. “But that’s not exactly what I’m asking, is it?” Malfoy’s eyes narrow, like he’s about to respond with something cutting, when another worker at the till calls out:
“I don’t think I’ve seen you have anything to drink this entire night,” Harry says, eyeing Hermione as she flushes.
We owe it to him to let him figure out who he wants to be. Will the world end if he wears a frock, grow his hair out, and call himself Thea, Draco? I don’t think so. It may very well not be permanent, but we’d be doing him—and us—a disservice if we don’t let him fucking
Draco gets to work with Cooling Charms and shifts through the contents of the medical bag left behind by the attending Aurors. He’s limited in how he controls the vomiting or whatever pain the man is in without his own potions. He uses the only pain relief potion in the bag, as well as a few drops of Dittany and Salamander blood under the man’s tongue. Suddenly, the man begins to gag.
“Er, I thought I’d let myself in?”
Potter glares at him. “You don’t know what the fuck you’re saying. You can’t possibly...you can’t
Draco groans again, slowly turning to his side. “Zilly, can you...check for my wand?”
polite Wizarding Society when it comes to my Mother? I’m talking Pureblood, old money, with a hint of dark magic.”
“Thanks,” Draco says as he wraps the cloth around the handle of the mirror, using the wide end to slide the cursed music box onto the silver platter. Theo then places the lid over it and takes it from Draco’s hands.
“Malfoy! Hey, sorry about that,” Potter starts cheerfully before biting into his apple. “Why don’t you come on in?” he says around his mouthful.
, but continues, pulse racing.
“He’s
“What? You never talk about Bart. I never see you even react when his name is brought up! How is that possible? Don’t you experience any feelings of loss?” he spits, shaking his head as he glares at the other man.
Harry smirks. “Ron and Hermione’s. I’m, er, staying with them for a while...I need to be near you, being at home without you is too much. Can’t you feel it? It’s like I was starving and now I’m full but still
I begged you not to do it. I don’t know
” Harry says, scrunching up his face and sticking his tongue out as he tightens his arms around Draco. “Not me, ever. How about you?”
“Potter, need I remind you who the hell you’re talking to? Of course, I’ve experienced loss. Father is in Azkaban, Mother hardly ever leaves her house if it’s not advantageous to her social standing. I can’t do magic for ten years. My long-term boyfriend left me, and now my best friend is being a snivelling, selfish tit! So yeah, I have experienced fucking loss, but guess what? My mourning period is over. I’m tired of feeling sorry for myself—all I want is to be happy. So, excuse me if I’m not throwing a tantrum, breaking shit that doesn’t belong to me, and embarrassing myself in front of my friends every time I’m upset!”
“I know,” Blaise says solemnly. “You’re too good for him, you know that?”
“The correct word is abnormal, but yes, I will marry you, Harry. Let’s be un-normal together. Forever.”
you. So perfect,” Potter says against his mouth. They both need this. Draco pulls away then, a smile crossing his face at Potter’s impatient groan. He only pulls away enough so he can grab his wand to throw a Stasis Charm on his cauldron. When he places his wand back on the worktable, Potter grabs him roughly by his upper arms to walk him backwards into the space between the worktable and enormous bookshelf. As soon as his back hits the wall with a thud, Potter’s lips are against his once more, Draco’s mouth opening, their eager tongues caressing one another as the kiss deepens. He wrestles against Potter’s grasp so he can wrap his arms around the twat, but Potter won’t release his upper arms. He gives him a little shake when he tries to escape. He stops resisting as a surge of lust washes over him. The intensity of it could crack through the smog in the London sky.
A naked middle-aged man is convulsing on the pavement, his sickly pale skin appears to have areas that look like red inflamed rashes, his eyes round and nearly bulging from the sockets. But the most startling aspect of his man’s ailments is the tar-black vomit spewing from his mouth, the liquid slithering in thin tendrils to coalesce into a single puddle, thick like molasses, and shimmering. In between his vomiting the man gurgles and screams, his body heaving and contorting violently. Several Aurors rush forward, but even with three Aurors holding him down, Protective Charms on their entire bodies, the naked man still manages to arch his back off the ground.
He rolls off and onto his back, his cock wet and spent as it slips out of Draco, who gives a soft moan as they separate. Draco leans sideways to grab the heavy throw from the foot of the bed, tossing it over their rapidly cooling bodies and tossing the pillow under him to the floor. Harry feels loose and tingly, but nothing prepares him for the feeling of affection that blooms in the centre of his chest as Draco curls around him, throwing an arm across his torso and placing a kiss on his chest. He’s always had an inkling that Draco was a serial cuddler, and although he should feel happy to have the man in his arms like this, he just feels incredibly guilty and ashamed. “Are you comfortable?” Draco asks.
This, of course, further fuelled Harry’s interests.
Draco flinches when he’s finally able to see all of Harry. If Draco, who hasn’t seen his reflection in a month thought he looked bad, he has nothing on Harry. Harry’s complexion is washed out, with deep, violent purple bags under his eyes. He looks like he’s lost weight, too.
“What?”
Harry’s lips mouth along the base of Draco’s throat, his tongue flicking out. Draco shivers as Harry drags a hot, velvety patch up his neck, kisses chasing after the patch leading up to Draco’s sharp chin. “Harry.
, Harry. Look at us. We’ve slept with the same tragic bloke. We dated each other, broke up,
“You do that,” Draco says coldly, his eyes narrowing as their earlier air of camaraderie evaporates.
She nods and hands Draco a glass of whisky. It’s then that Draco notices the half-full bottle tucked under her arm. It’s a rule that during Social Season waiters replace the duties of house-elves during events. For aesthetic purposes and not entirely because of Granger’s new piece of legislation currently being debated in the Wizengamot to end house-elf usage. He wonders what Bitty did to lift a bottle from one of them. He waits until she’s taken her first sip to sip his own. One can never fully trust an Agnelli. After all, their family motto is
“You’re so beautiful, Draco. So, so beautiful.”
“We need to talk,” Potter says from behind him.
Draco realises it’s

“Well, that comes with the title of Slytherin’s forever queen bee,” Draco jokes weakly. Pansy sobs harder. He squeezes her gently. “I’m sorry...I’m sorry. I don’t mean to jest. You’re not awful. Blaise will understand if you simply tell him.”
“Where’s Granger?” Draco croaks out.

Harry gently places his fingers on Draco’s neck, the bruising now having bloomed to noticeability. “Draco. What happened here?”
Draco refuses to let Harry hyperfocus on this. He grasps Harry’s wrists, shaking him slightly.

Draco's patience is stretched thin with a nosy neighbour. Harry's just along for the ride.
A tiny flicker of sharp, callous anger shoots through him at her barbed comment, but Draco just rolls his shoulders back, trying to maintain his composure.
Draco bites back a gasp.
“Well, okay,” Mia starts, her concern smoothing away as she smiles. “Now that I have you here, I wanted to ask if you want to come to my birthday party? I’m doing it at the Leaky, of course. In one week! Save the date, babe,” she giggles.
Ginny crosses her arms against her chest with a huff. “Right…” she drawls. “Because a ten-thousand quid vase just screams homey.”
” Harry roars, withdrawing his wand and body to shove his fingers into his unruly hair.
“Is this true, Watson?” Pierce’s sharp voice rings out in the courtroom.
I’ll call on you later, okay?” Blaise says, passing the items to him. Draco takes them with a grateful nod, blindly walking to the steps of the shop. When he stares down at the packaging, Harry stares up from him, a guileless smile on his young face painted across the chocolate frog card.
“Ha-ha,” Draco says, rolling his eyes. He notices the pint, the glass dappled with condensation, and the small shot glass of clear liquid. He pulls both the shot and pint towards him. “Is this muck any good?”
At the word monster, Potter cringes and hangs his head, lifting his hands to push under his glasses and rub over his eyes and face. Potter sniffs several times before he drops his hands and readjusts his glasses.
say Harry was a degenerate if they met.
“Er,” Harry mutters.
Just then, Kreacher pops up, dropping into a bow so low his long nose touches the floor. “Young Master Black! Kreacher is being so pleased you have reentered the Most Ancient and Noble House of Black after so many years! Anything you is be needing will be Kreacher’s pleasure of getting for you!”
“I already can’t keep up with Mother’s social calendar and the Season just started. I was mentally preparing myself for a lie-in when she announced that I’m to show my face at this bloody fundraiser. I just wanted a quiet day in. Maybe have a hooker or two for dinner,” Draco says, his lips twitching up in a smirk as he folds himself into the space beside Bitty and rummages through his pocket for his pack of cigarettes.
“I think you need to take your own advice,” Draco says curtly. Potter’s expression shifts to something dark as he steps into Draco’s personal space, their roles from earlier now reversed as Potter crowds him. Only, Potter's presence is looming, larger than he physically is as he crowds Draco. That wild, untamed energy radiates off him. Draco swallows a soft gasp as he shrinks back from Potter’s powerful, incandescent gaze.
Draco’s jaw goes slack at the suggestion, his cheeks ruddy as Potter sidles up beside him, following him stride for stride towards the Ministry lifts.
“You deserve better. I know you know that,” Draco says softly.
“Do you want to get out of here?” Draco asks, utter nerves spiraling sweetly. He makes his decision right then. “We can go to yours.”
Potter’s staring at Draco with wide eyes, his lips slightly parted. Draco averts his gaze from Potter.
“Bart
Draco stares at him, unblinking. “You
“You have about two minutes before the Chief Wizengamot Prosecutor comes down here looking to serve your head up on a platter, young man. If I were you, I’d take these forms here.” She shoves a small stack of parchment into his hands. “Give me your briefcase and mosey on down to the courtroom to get a start on the day’s cases being heard for arraignment and bail.”
“Fuckin’ suburbia,” he repeats, leaning back in for another kiss.
love you, too."
“Oh, Merlin, really? I’m sorry—”
“Yeah, but it was a last-minute thing,” Hermione says with a shrug. “Don’t read too much into it.”
Draco looks up, his hands dropping into his lap. A small part of him screams to shut up, that despite Harry’s warmth and kindness, he’s still an Auror and can sniff out suspicious behaviour, especially when it sounds like a bloody confession. He can’t stop the words falling from his mouth. It’s as if something has been turned on inside of him and he needs to let out his pain.
, I suppose so if you’re going to keep harping on about it.” He watches as Harry gets to his feet, wincing.
“What’s going on with you?”
This lone figure.
Draco knows all of this information and more not just because his mother is currently in a pissing contest with Bitty’s mother, oh no, not just that. There are a few reasons why Draco is privy to this information, the prominent one being: Draco fucked Bitty somewhere between Rome and Naples. And the girl just loves to talk when her mouth isn’t otherwise occupied with cock.

“Then we fell in love.”
“RON!” and “What the hell!” are shouted from Hermione and him, respectively.

“That’s why I’m at this

Draco cuts his gaze away from Padma again, landing on his hallucination. A night away from
“Ah,” Draco starts, feeling light-headed. “Can you, can you tell her I’m sorry? And let Pansy and Blaise know I’m going home.”
Draco cups Harry’s chin, tilting it up so they’re eye-to-eye. “Please tell me why you did this.”
“Rough week with the Ministry,” he says, voice dipping low. He’s happy for the distraction in the shape of a babbling Rose crawling towards him.
The ceiling has four skylights across the open floor plan and a gleaming chef’s kitchen at the back. The flat is a maisonette, with part of the second floor overlooking the sitting room.
“It appears Mother is staging a re-entrance into polite British Wizarding Society and has kindly requested that I make an appearance.” He slams the envelop down on the table Harry is sat at, his pale face exhausted.

His shoulders sag and slouches forward, his elbow hitting the table as he covers his mouth with his hand. He squeezes his eyes shut, willing away the burning sensation.
_______________________
He feels weak, now resting most of his weight against Pansy’s tiny form and he wonders how she can even keep them both upright.
Draco nods. “It’s nice to meet you.”
Draco falls to his knees, his hands flying to protect his chest, believing that Smith is about to punch or kick him. Instead Smith’s hand slithers into Draco’s hair, gripping the long stands and tugging his head back. Draco’s lips part as he gasps at the sharp reminder of that terrible pub night while staring up into Smith’s smug face. He releases Draco’s hair, his hand roughly grasping Draco’s sharp chin instead, tilting it up as his thumb brushes against Draco’s lower lip as he says, “You’re not so very smart, Malfoy. I like that in my scum. You all think you’re so clever but can’t seem to see what’s right in front of you, and that’s when I swoop in to take you out. Lucky for you, I also like to chase my scum, it feels so much better when I finally crush them. I can’t wait to see what you look like under my shoe, you little slut. I bet you'll even like it,” Smith cackles, his hand flat across Draco’s face, shoving him away as he turns on his heel towards the mouth of the alley, not looking back.

fallout with the public be fun to deal with. So of course he had panicked when Potter had offered to take things further, Draco had once again run from the situation. They had an awful row Friday afternoon and in the evening, Draco had gone out drinking. If he tells Potter this, he’ll certainly make it impossible for him to forget the whole ordeal. Maybe even blame himself for Draco getting attacked, as the Gryffindor shite is wont to do. Then they

“Idiot, the bloody Quidditch match is being held at their estate in Maidenhead. They’ve definitely traveled to their main estate for the summer to prepare for that,” Theo says, leaning back in his armchair and crossing his legs. “This is a perfect idea. Imagine, Draco. We can help you take your revenge.”
Harry lets go.
“Are they meant to be front and centre like this?” Draco mumbles to Simmons, his chin jutting towards the two settling on the benches for the Wizengamot.
It feels like coming full circle, somehow. After everything he’s been through in the last three years, he’s once again in the company of Ginny, the person who was first to knock down the domino to what would be an experience of self-learning for him. They were both in pain, both learning to navigate through new waters and unexpected changes. Things will never be the same again.
