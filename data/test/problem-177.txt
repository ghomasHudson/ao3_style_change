Ron and Hermione exchanged glances.
Draco stared at her, mouth open for a long moment as he took in her words.
Except it was. Everything was different. This was Draco. They were at his house. This was somehow far more intimate and real.
'When?' Draco asked, wondering just what he wanted out of this conversation. He tried to muster the feelings of anger and rejection he'd harboured for so long, but here, wrapped up in Harry's body and scent and touch, it was so hard to bring them back. He felt sated. He thought it might be the closest to happiness he'd felt since before the war.
Malfoy shrugged and looked away, closing his book and putting his hand on the arm of the couch, as if to push himself up.
Harry blinked at her and recalled her instruction.
. If the Reparation Society is serious about funding reform, throwing ridiculously expensive parties is hardly the way to go about it, I would have thought.' Harry leaned back again, crossing his arms and raising his chin slightly as though he'd scored a hit.
'So basically,' Harry concluded. 'The Australians are the only ones of the lot of them with a lick of sense. And even their proposal is too weak. It's just things we should already be doing.'
Impervius didn't seemed to be holding as well as it should.
Jones nodded, scribbling notes and then Harry waved her away, checking the clock on the wall. He had a briefing with Javier and the Minister in ten minutes. He stopped by his office to scribble a note, which he asked Mrs. Norris to owl to Malfoy, and then he headed into the lion's den. He just knew Javier was going to try to take over the investigation and the last thing he needed was the DMLE Head wrapping the whole thing up in red tape and miscommunication. This would be solved by the people on the ground, and he was the one that got the best out of those people.
'Draco invited us, actually,' Andromeda said, and Harry's face crinkled in confusion.
'I'm not hiding anything. Unlike you, I know exactly who I am and what I want.' He paused, taking a step to the side and gesturing around the room they were in. Harry followed the movement and his eyes widened in shock.
He needs to find out Malfoy's aim in meeting Davies, he knows. He needs to understand the talk of a market. Harry looks again over the farm, trying to see if there are any details that give away a connection to Malfoy's business in the strip club the night before. To his eye, everything looks exactly as it should, and that, coupled with the strength of the wards around the house, makes him more suspicious than ever.
'What?' Malfoy said, looking over at him with a faint smirk. 'Don't even try and say you don't agree.'
The words ricocheted through Harry's mind for a moment before they registered, and then he looked up, mind abruptly sharpening.
'W'appen?' Harry whispered, trying to push himself up into a seated position. He barely managed to move his head off the pillow. The helplessness sent fear jolting through him. What
Ron raised an eyebrow. 'Fine, but dinner's on you.'
They passed through a small living room that was neat, but reasonably bare, just a few books, a blanket thrown over the back of the couch and the telly on one wall. There were no photos, no personal items. Harry tried not to wince as he saw the similarities in the way he'd put Grimmauld Place together. It had been so much nicer when he lived there with Draco.
'Fuck,' he gasped again as Harry's tongue swirled around the head of his cock, licking at him, tonguing against his slit and licking his foreskin down.
'Where to now, Mr Potter? Oh, never mind, I know just the place.'
'Okay, Harry. We might drop by on Sunday? I feel like it’s been ages since we spoke properly.'
'Not anymore,' he said. Then he shifted, sitting up straighter. Harry sat up as well, feeling like he'd crossed some unspoken line. Feeling like maybe, sharing confidences with this stranger wasn't a good idea. He stopped himself -
. The whole site was situated under a high, domed glass roof, and it looked light and airy. Harry shrugged, guessing it beat his dingy office with its enchanted window as the only source of interest.
'In light of your recent accomplishments, it is transparently clear that the decision to request your resignation in light of your… affliction was a poor one. Head Auror Robards and I would like to ask you to consider returning to your former position.'
Draco nodded, looking down at Scorpius for a moment and swallowing before he spoke.
you could do is rest for a day. You should be dead,' Malfoy says, and his voice leaves no room for argument. 'Jimsonweed is incredibly toxic. It leads to fever, hallucinations and heart failure within an hour, two tops. People don't just fight that off.'
Harry kicked his boots off and crossed to the small table with its one, rickety chair, pulling the two vials and the letters out of his jacket and laying them on the table in front of him. His eyes roamed over them as he pulled the bag of 'weed from his other pocket and reached for his papers. He'd look at the vials in the morning, and add what the memories told him to his ever-growing list of leads. Doing it before bed often made the nightmares worse.
'Right,' Harry said, pushing to his feet. 'Right.'
, Harry said in response, unable to stop the smile spreading across his face.
He let out the air in a strangled sob and lifted a shaking hand to uncap the bottle. He took a deep swig, the craving for gillyweed rising in him viciously. The booze just made him feel angry and sick. It didn't help to calm him. Didn't stop the dreams from coming. But maybe, if he drank it quickly enough, it would help to make this bearable.
'What made you leave?' he asks, sorting through possible questions and links to Malfoy's current situation and finding none. He goes with what he's curious about.
'I can look after myself,' Malfoy says, and Harry, thinking about the way he's comported himself so far, realises he has no doubt about that. Whatever else Malfoy may be now, he's clearly capable. 'But I need to give the impression that I can't, and I need to fit in. To fit in, I need someone like you living with me and looming over me. Can you do that?'
'What will the money raised be put towards?' Harry asked, and Draco knew he had him.
'Harry, love, you're safe here. I promise. There is no one to hurt you. You're safe, love. Open your eyes for me.
As he watches, Davies flicks again and there's a picture of a boy, dark-haired. Younger this time. Eight maybe. His eyes are wide and terrified. An image slams into Harry's mind, of Teddy, just a bit under this age, of the terror of his final moments left imprinted on his face. Harry wants to vomit with the force of the memory.
He did want to be there, if only to remember it for Teddy, so he could share the memory when the boy was older. Harry sighed and tilted his drink up, feeling the familiar burn of the firewhisky as it slid down his throat. He placed the now empty glass on the table beside him and was looking through the crowd for one of the many house elves circulating in their smart service robes when he heard a familiar booming voice behind him. He closed his eyes for a moment and breathed out a long, slow breath, and then plastered the smile back onto his face and turned.
It's about ten minutes later that he hears the shower start in the bathroom two floors above them. He looks up at the ceiling for a moment, feeling that same niggle of worry working its way through him. He tries to push it down. Draco's taking a shower. That's fine. It's been a massive day and he's taking a shower before bed. It doesn't mean anything more than that.
Harry looked at Draco a moment longer, thinking about his own father and how much he missed him and wished he could have had him around his whole life to do nothing more than talk to when he pleased. He shrugged the thought off, not wanting to get maudlin.
The images flashed through his mind again. Sex swing. Medical play. Blood play. He'd seen rooms with restraints and benches and one set up just like a dining room, which Ladon had told him was for those who enjoyed being human furniture. He'd been reeling by the end of the tour.
Teddy's face fell and at that moment Andromeda approached them. 'Teddy's had a spot of trouble at school and he's spending a few days at home until he feels better.'
and sent the owl.
The words filtered through the haze of Harry's need and reality came crashing back down around him. What was he doing? He couldn't kiss someone - he couldn't be with someone else. He was married - it was fucked up and not working, but he wasn't a cheater. He wouldn't be. He pushed backwards, out of Ladon's grip and to his feet, panting roughly as he looked at the man in the chair, face flushed, dark hair tousled, eyes full of need.
He took his drink to an empty couch, skirting couples and groups entwined in various intimate acts. He saw a woman being used as a footstool and another man kneeling, head bowed, beside a couch, clearly waiting on the next whim or words of the man sitting within it. He tried not to stare, but it was hard to pull his gaze away. The man looked so relaxed, almost lost inside his own head.
'It's not your fault, Harry, and thinking it is takes away from the bravery of Fred's choice to fight.' Harry heard Ladon's words from the night before whisper in his mind,
, his wolf rumbles inside him.
Malfoy's gaze sharpened and his eyes flicked over Harry, then he turned to the fridge.
'S'wrong?' Harry asks, turning slightly so he's leaning on the car again. He sighs as the movement takes the weight off his hip and for just a second gives some relief to his back.
Malfoy was dancing now, and Harry remembered watching him dance at the Yule Ball, all those years ago. He'd hated Malfoy then, for how easy he made it look. For how seamlessly he fit in, with his Pureblood manners and what was clearly years of familiarity with the dances. Now … now he watched Malfoy and wasn’t sure what he thought. Malfoy was a better dancer now than he had been then. He'd grown into his gangly limbs, filled out into a lean, well-built man.
'Do you think I would have gone if I'd had any other choice? Do you think I'd live like this'—he gestures to himself in a movement that takes in everything about who he is and what he does now—'if I had a choice?'
'It's none of my - we're not in the scene anymore, so you don't have to say anything you don't want, but why … why didn't you?'
'What's going on, Potter?' he asked.
and realising to his shock that it was three am. He moved to the shadow of a nearby alley and turned on the spot, disapparating with a familiar hooking sensation.
The next three had been less obvious. He wasn't sure that without an understanding of Pureblood politics, he would have identified them.
Malfoy's eyes met his again and he nodded. There was something written in them that Harry couldn't read and it frustrated him.
wards, leaving them tattered in his wake.
Malfoy turns his attention back to the door, but ignores Harry suggestion for the ropes.
The tentacles retreated one by one, withdrawing into the tank, pulling Draco back against the glass. The last of them left his skin with a slide that was almost a caress. Then it was gone and Draco felt Harry's magic closing the portals.
'What are you thinking about?' Draco asked, rolling to his side and cushioning his head on his arm as he faced Potter.
the judgement in his thoughts, the resentment he kept behind his lips.
Harry pulled the memory closer and then cast around, seeking anything else that could be useful to him. The memories were fleeing, as the woman whose mind he'd invaded tried to protect herself from him. Harry smiled grimly. She didn't have a hope.
Malfoy's mouth opened and then closed, as though he could think of a hundred reasons why not, but finally he nodded. Something in his face made Harry think Malfoy was expecting a trap; an ambush at any moment. Harry felt some of his suspicions give way before a spike of guilt that that was exactly what he had in mind. Malfoy's look was one he was too familiar with and one he'd spent years trying to alleviate in the many creatures he'd handled.
'And what about my son?' Harry asked, his mind coming back to that thought again and again, unable to make the connection as to why James had had to die. 'What does he have to do with all of this?'
'No,' Harry whispered, the emptiness inside him rippling with concern. 'Please, don't. The whisky—it numbs things. I can't feel all of this. Not—Not yet. Please, Ron.'
But Ron spoke before he could, coming over to kneel beside the table, leaning gently against Harry's side as he said, 'People can be sad about lots of things, Rosie. Maybe Uncle Harry has an owie. Or maybe he read a sad story. Or maybe something happened to make him sad. You know what the most important thing is?'
Malfoy frowned at him as if the answer was obvious. 'Look at you. How long since you've eaten? How long since you've slept properly? How long since you've thought about something other than the dreams?'
Giles took Lucius through his testimony, clearly trying to establish him as a lonely old man who was no threat to anyone. Harry didn't buy it and looking around the courtroom, he didn't think many others did either. Lucius was just too
Draco moved to the large bay windows overlooking the garden and positioned himself
Harry finished up, brewed the tea and went upstairs to find Draco. He was curled up on the end of the couch in front of the crackling fire, a book open in front of him. The sitting room had always been Harry's favourite, ever since his first visit to Draco's house six years earlier. He liked the whole house. It was light and airy and he had felt at home the very first time he walked in, but there was something about the sitting room that just spoke of warmth and comfort and home.
Harry sat, taking a deep breath and trying to think about where he wanted to start.
Harry continued. 'I'd like to draft something and bring it to you to talk through.'
with Malfoy.
The boy swallowed, his eyes widening. 'We were just having some fun, Mr. Malfoy.'
'You're the first person who's seen my real face in the last ten years. Did you know that?' He glances across at Harry as though checking his reaction, then looks back out into the night. Harry feels shock run through him at the words.
'Good,' Ladon said, and he sat back upright. Harry had to stop himself from protesting the loss of closeness.
Ladon made a sound of approval and returned to the papers in front of him. Harry reddened slightly as he remembered some of the other things he'd indicated.
Draco sniffed, looking him up and down with eyes that lingered too long to be anything but appreciative. 'Yes, well you look like a bird flew into your hair and took up residence,' he said, reaching across to tuck a curl behind Harry's ear. Harry grinned at him, turning his head quickly to press a kiss against Draco's palm.
'Red or black?' Pansy said and Draco pushed himself up onto his elbows to see her standing in front of her closet wearing only a pair of skimpy lace knickers, with two dresses held up to her chest. He eyed them both, knowing from experience he couldn't get away with a flippant answer.
anything about it. Things were already far too messy.
Draco let his hand fall to the bed as he looked at Harry, stretched out across the covers, leaning on his elbows, covered in Draco's come.
Malfoy leaned over, eyes flicking over the pages, before he glanced away, dismissing them. Harry opened his mouth to argue with him - to make him see the danger.
'You don't strike me as the kind of man who names his child Steven. But I understand you not wanting to tell me his name.'
Draco felt his guilt and regret over the past few weeks stir, and begin to shift. He felt the first hints of anger begin to rise in its place. Potter had done this to hurt him - despite the fact that Draco had practically begged for Harry's forgiveness. Despite the fact that he had laid himself bare to apologise. Had Harry even watched the memories? Had he watched them and laughed - and decided he could use them to hurt Draco in turn?
'Can I have Hogwarts this time?' he asked, sending a weak smile Malfoy's way, as though he was embarrassed to have asked.
'How did you find out about us?'
His attention flicked to the three figures as Malfoy spoke.
Draco waited, but she didn’t say anything more.
Harry looked around. 'Why is it not raining in your office?' he asked suspiciously.
Harry considered her a moment longer. 'Are you done?' he asked finally.
Wolf hits the ground hard, claws digging into the wooden floor beneath him, gouging furrows in it. He snarls at the renewed shockwave of pain that travels through him.
Estelle gave him a smile, and then turned to Scorpius, asking him how his day was. Draco had already let her know they'd been to the aquarium and that he was buzzing but would likely crash early for the night.
at the mechanism from under his cloak, but nothing happens. He frowns, but Draco seems to take it in his stride, knocking on the door.
'Trust that pointy git to be wound up with that lot,' Ron said, with a look of disgust. 'Did you hex him?'
'And once, in the distance, I saw the merfolk come to play with the squid...' Draco stopped speaking as he realised what that process must have been. The spawning cycle.
Harry closed his eyes and sucked more of the smoke into his lungs as he sat and felt his son's heartbeat flutter under his fingertips. He'd had it done when James was born, right over his own heart. He'd wanted to burn it off, those first few weeks after James had been killed. It felt like a sick mockery of his life. But now... now it brought him a strange comfort.
'Alright,' Draco said with a nod, as he mounted his broom again. 'Let's see who's the better seeker once and for all.'
Harry shrugged, deliberately not reaching for his cloak. The longer he kept the fact that he had it a secret, the more right that decision felt.
Malfoy is quiet for a moment before he shakes his head. 'Not really, no. I don't have time.'
Behind the door was a lift. It only had one button, with the word ASS on it. Harry exchanged a grin with Ron and Hermione rolled her eyes at them. Ron pushed it and when the lift stopped, they opened the door to see a large, flat roof space. The cool Autumn air they should have been feeling inside rushed over them and Harry welcomed it after the stifling heat of the Ministry.
'If you mean that a demon rider came bursting out of the chest of a woman I killed—the woman who
Ron gave a bitter laugh. 'That's great mate. After we've tracked him down and charged him for fifteen murders, I'll be sure to tell him it's important that you speak with him.'
'That's right,' Rick said. 'You're the one that fucked up the kill for the first rising.'
Draco nodded, still watching his son. 'His mother and I … didn't work out. She was the main thing keeping us in France. I … I missed home.'
Harry takes a careful, silent step, and then another, until he's in the line of sight of Davies' phone, and then he freezes. The image Malfoy is looking at—the image on the screen of the phone—is of a girl, no more than ten, with her hair done in beautiful ringlets, tied with bows, and a look of utter helplessness in her eyes.
The light from the moon spilled into the room illuminating Malfoy's bed. His hangings were open and his body was long and pale in the moonlight. Harry's eyes moved down Malfoy's naked chest, the buttons of his silk pyjama top open, leaving it hanging half off him.
Jayne had told him, after their second session, that keeping a journal might be a useful way for him to reflect on his days and his thoughts between sessions, to look for patterns and to be deliberate about his choices.
Unfortunately by the time they'd found the photos tucked under his seat, Bright had already been carted off to the morgue by the Muggle first responders. Once they'd finally been able to send a Healer Liaison in to test him for magical residue, the crucial six hour window had passed, so it was impossible to tell if he'd been coerced in some way. The only lead was the fact that his house contained more of the same photos of the people who had been on the bus trip - the people who he'd slammed his vehicle into with, it seemed now, the intent to kill.
'We keep their bodies safe while their spirits journey. They provide a balance to this world.' Daniela clearly noticed the sceptical expression on his face, because she continued. 'Some Muggles believe that this place holds the skull of Adam, the first man, placed on earth by their deity. They believe the site has been made holy through this presence and through soil sprinkled from Golgotha, the site upon which their Saviour was said to have been crucified.'
'I miss you so much,' Potter said, and his other hand slid onto Draco's hip. Two fingers slipped under the edge of his t-shirt, rubbing against his skin. Draco's breath shook as his entire focus narrowed down to that touch.
Draco takes a step closer and Harry sees something rising in his eyes, the same look he'd had the night they'd kissed. He feels panic run through him. Draco can't be involved with him. He'll get hurt. It's too dangerous.
It was hours later when he passed out on the couch. He woke into daylight glaring through his curtains and he got up for a piss, stumbling through the house until he reached the bathroom and the blessed relief of hangover potion. Then he collected his pouch of tobacco, another bottle of booze and went back to the lounge. If he was drunk, he wouldn't have to remember Malfoy's bullshit.
Draco's eyes narrowed at this and he leaned forward, all signs of his discomfort at the relationship between he and his father gone. 'He said that?' Draco asked. 'That my mother loved gardening? Loved gardening, not the garden?'
'Are you ready for me to take this off?' Ladon asked, looking Harry in the eyes with a serious expression.
He jerked awake, squinting up at her and then moaned as pain ratcheted through his body. The memories of the night before came rushing back and he squeezed his eyes shut, curling in on himself, heedless of the fresh pain this brought.
She stood looking down at him a moment longer, then glanced at the door. 'Okay,' she said at last. 'Do you need anything?'
Malfoy raised an eyebrow at him. 'I'm not guilty of anything, Potter. I disappear, suddenly I am.'
Draco gritted his teeth. He should have bought Pansy out years ago. He was far beyond the need for the start-up loan he'd initially approached her for, back when Release had been nothing more than a dream. If she wasn’t still a partner, the confidentiality clauses would have prevented Dahlia breathing a word about Potter's presence in the club, even if the two of them went out drinking together every night of the week. Nosy bint loved to keep Pansy informed. Normally Draco didn't mind - it was nice to have someone who wasn't a part of the scene to be able to chat with sometimes. But this … this he hadn’t wanted Pansy to find out.
He looks at Malfoy, mind racing as he thinks through the best way to talk him into giving Harry what he needs. It will have to be done slowly, he knows. Malfoy is a slippery bastard, clearly, and despite his rot about exceeding the ten year statute, Harry knows the Auror office will happily slap a dozen new charges on him the moment they see him.
Harry nodded and moved across, reaching into the bag and pulling out the collar. He ran his fingers over it, anticipation tingling through him, and then placed it on the bar.
Harry feels something stir in him, wanting to leap to Draco's defence. It's a mixture of himself and the wolf and they both want to growl, but he knows Ron is right. The persona Draco is playing is a right arsehole. He spends just a second wishing things could be different and that Draco could be himself around Ron.
Draco looked up and caught him staring. His eyes tightened. 'It's hot in here,' he said. 'I'll cover it, if it bothers you.'
Ladon was in the records, that much was clear … but he was in there in the way that Harry usually only saw in his work cases. He had a basic history - date of birth (he was in his mid-forties - a bit older than Harry had suspected), Hogwarts schooling, a Gringotts vault, a low-level Ministry job before the opening of
'Draco,' said the older woman, tucking a grayed curl behind her ear as she smiled up at him. 'Geraldine and I were just talking about the last time you hosted a ball at the Manor and she said we simply must come over.'
'I'm sorry,' he said, laying a hand on her shoulder as he passed her. His touch was brief, but he felt her lean away from it, all the same. He grabbed the whisky bottle off the shelf and left the kitchen.
knew those things. Had pulled them from him.
'Fuck,' Harry says. He opens his eyes to see Malfoy watching him, curiosity written across his face. He can't even begin to explain himself, so he makes his way to the table and sits down heavily.
He was preoccupied the rest of the day and it was late when he got home, stepping through the floo and heading straight to the cabinet that housed his firewhisky.
He hesitated for just a moment and then spun in place, Apparating to the Museum. He needed help if he was going to try and stop this. The area surrounding the Museum was no less panicked. Harry looked out over the chaos and saw a number of blue-robed figures Apparate into the gardens, immediately beginning to fire off spells at those who held wands and were terrorising the Muggles they were herding together.
'It will join with War now, mark my words. We're going to see an all-out global conflict. Right up War's alley, of course. And with it, we'll see Plague joining the party and Death reigning over them all, like the carrion bird he is. It will be Wizard against Muggle, this cycle. They've already set it up that way. They're so close to breaking the Statute of Secrecy this time. We got them last time, with the Salem Witch Trials, but this time, I don't know if we—'
Malfoy's eyes widened fractionally and his gaze flicked to Harry. Harry willed him not to say anything. He hadn't told Ginny about the entry fee. Malfoy looked back at Ginny a moment later, smiling, with a smooth, 'Of course. It's a pleasure to have you. You'll know many of the other guests, of course. I see the French Head of Magical Sports and Games over by the orchestra. You'd be acquainted?'
'No!' Harry interrupted, not sure why his heart was suddenly beating so fast and why the image that Ladon had just raised wouldn't leave his mind.
'How bad is it?' Ron said.
- So does begin a journey
Draco bit his lip at the evidence of Harry's arousal. Surely it couldn't be that easy.
He tapped the memo with his wand so that it folded into a plane, marked itself as 'General' and shot into the air. Harry thumped the compendium back onto Ron's desk and decided that since he was here, he may as well have his afternoon tea break. He liked spending time at Ron's desk. People didn't bother him here.
Luna opened her mouth, but Harry knew the answer before she spoke.
'Some of it - some was just us being kids. It - fighting against you - was one of the best parts of school.' He let out a small grin that Harry couldn't help but return.
Harry props himself up slightly, bringing his hand up to the glass, covering Malfoy's fingers as Malfoy guides it to his mouth. The water is cool and delicious and Harry swallows it greedily. Some spills from the corner of his mouth, dripping down his neck and onto his chest, but Harry pays it no mind. It feels nice against his feverish skin.
He'd freed all the other elves years ago, but Modrey had insisted he stay – that to abandon Master Lucius just could not be borne. Draco hadn't tried to fight it too hard – the idea of anyone, including his father, being shut up alone inside this living tomb, was just too much.
When he felt more human, he went back downstairs, continuing out through the garden. It had been a long time since he'd opened up the shed in the yard … but he was curious, after his dream. The small building was as cluttered as he remembered it, tools and parts spread all over the workbenches. It had been another room they'd closed after Sirius had gone - another thing that had been too painful to keep open. The ache was duller nowadays. Harry set his mug down on a grease-stained bench and looked at the sheet-covered machine in the middle of the shed. He hadn't touched it since Hagrid had returned it. He'd always kind of hoped Sirius would show him how to ride it … but that dream had sat on the shelf, like so many others.
But then he thought about what that weather system was doing right now - the vistas in the windows had changed from jungle scenes to baked dry sand dunes that morning - and suddenly the job seemed a lot less tedious.
'Hi,' he said again, reaching out a hand, and hoping Draco would take it.
'The circle represents the world,' Daniela said, tracing her finger around it, from memory as she held Harry's gaze. 'The diamond represents the Host, or humanity and our role in preserving life,' she continued, tracing the shape inside the circle. 'The figure eight,' she said, finger following the two sharp-edged triangles linked together and placed over the diamond, 'is the infinity symbol, and the sign that life prevails, or triumphs, in some form. And it always will.'
Draco lay back in the grass as Potter approached. He put one hand behind his head and closed his eyes. He heard the grass swish as Potter made his way over and then the sound stopped as Potter stood above him, looking down at him, sprawled out on the ground. Draco breathed slowly and evenly, and after a moment, the grass rustled as Potter moved closer, lowering himself onto the ground and stretching out beside Draco.
All the great spells required intent. Harry knew the way the
'This is nice,' he murmured.
Harry glared at him, feeling his anger go from a simmer to a roar. He ignored the way the truth of the words pulled at him. That just made him angrier.
The words of the Horseman came back to him.
It's only a ten minute trip before they're pulling up in front of a seedy looking building with a flashing neon sign that reads, of all things, Licker's Tits.
Draco rubbed a hand over his face and up into his hair, mussing up the styled look. Harry watched the path of his hand, and then pulled his eyes back down as Draco began to speak.
It was Potter's turn to be weak in front of Draco. And Draco—well, if he happened to learn things that he could use to blackmail Potter and find himself something better in life—that's just what Potter owed him, really.
'Fucks sake, Ginny,' he said, anger surging through him again - so much more preferable than guilt - as he pushed up from the table. All of the lights in the house flared painfully bright for a moment as Harry glared across the table at his wife. 'You don't know - I can't-'
Harry nods and Malfoy looks around. 'Do you think he'll be back, or do you think he just wanted to keep us here?'
'Harry's crossed O'Neill off the list,' Blake said.
Ron seemed eager to change the subject. He turned and looked back out the door, as though listening. 'Where's Ginny?'
He reached out and touched Malfoy's knee lightly. Malfoy looked up at him, eyes widening slightly.
'Harry, you clearly hate it here. Those idiots in PR be damned; I want you to resign.'
'Fine,' he rasped. At her skeptical look he shrugged. 'Tired.' Then he focused on the more important thing. 'What happened to everyone else?'
'Will you share with the court your exact feelings about your father over the past five years?'
It wasn't until he had banished the ropes, cast a cleaning charm over himself and was under the covers, drifting towards sleep, that he realised Ladon had disappeared completely from his fantasy.
Daniela Musilová had been taken apart and reassembled into an obscene parody of one of the sculptures made of bones that filled the room. Harry forced himself to look at her, the acid rising in his throat again as he moved closer.
'Germany,' Harry said, as pieces clicked to place in his mind. 'The Erklings are native to Germany. I need to know what one was doing here.'
Jones considered him for a moment longer, looking slightly surprised at the defensiveness in his tone. Then she nodded. 'Right. Will do. I'll send Johnson in with an update later.'
Harry frowned, annoyed that Malfoy wasn't taking the threat to himself seriously, he certainly seemed to be considering the threat to his son with the gravity it required.
To Keyflight790 and ElleGray - thank you for jumping in to cheer and help me work shit out. Elle, I hope you like this when you finally read it haha.
He caught sight of Zabini again. He was at the bar now, bending his head to talk to an elegant woman in a sweeping black dress, her hair cut into a neat bob. With a start of surprise, he recognised Pansy Parkinson. At that moment, she turned, eyes scanning over the crowded room. Her gaze snagged on Harry and her eyes widened then she looked away, waving a hand in the air as she said something else to Zabini. Harry snorted at the irony of dodging a party of his old school friends only to attend one filled with his old school enemies.
in front of strangers. The thought didn't scare him the way he'd thought it might, instead he just felt the earlier stirrings of desire lick higher. He felt himself harden slightly and closed his eyes, breathing in slowly. He folded his shirt neatly and then toed his boots off and left his socks inside them.
'I've visited,' Davies says. 'I found plenty of delicious things during my stay.' His smile turns knowing and Malfoy seems to read something more in it.
Harry turned him around, pulling him into a deep, hard kiss.
Malfoy hesitated a moment longer, half-turned in his chair, face conflicted as though trying to see if there was any way he could salvage the situation. Then he sighed and stood, smoothing down his dark robes.
Behind them, Harry caught Teddy's look of surprise out of the corner of his eye and then Scorpius piped up. 'Why were you in a cupboard Mr. Harry?'
Harry moved closer, feeling the wards tingle over his skin. He pushed against them, feeding them a hint of his magic, just enough for them to want to send an alert to their keeper. Then he stepped back, studying the building in front of him through the gates.
They'd puzzled over how Lucius could be involved in the recent attacks when he was locked inside the Manor. They'd narrowed their suspicions down to one thing. The letters. It was his only link to the outside world.
Aoife looked at him, her eyes knowing again, but it was Conor who spoke, his voice strangely gentle. 'You are a Catalyst, Harry. Death marked you for his own. The forces—they like to play with the Catalysts, or kill them before they can be brought against them. It's possible that however your child died, he took a death that had been aimed at you. Or it's possible the
Ron bailed him up as soon as he walked in the door. He pulled Harry aside, looking into his face with concern.
Harry crossed his arms over his chest, hunching his shoulders as he looked up at Ron. The sensation made him think of Malfoy towering over him the night before - Malfoy outsmarting him. Malfoy inside his mind taking whatever he wanted.
'Steer clear of the fighting, Catalyst,' Mac said to his back, as he strode away from her. 'Your real fight will be much more challenging than what is happening on the streets.'
, time for bed.'
Harry frowned, eyes flicking over the information on the screen. 'I think he might be connected to one of my names,' Harry said absently, as he took it in. What the hell was Malfoy doing making deals with the guy who set the military direction for the entire bloody country?
He gave her a sad smile. He would do what he had to. He had no choice.
'So, what?' Harry says, pushing his plate away, a bit more forcefully than he meant to. He can feel energy running through him, so much leftover strength from the shift. A part of him just wants to go outside and run, search the caves despite what Draco thinks. 'We just give up on them?'
Hermione grinned at that. 'Come for breakfast if you like. The kids would love to see you and Ginny. It's been ages since we've had you both over.'
He bottled his fierce love for his son and the fact that he would put Scorpius before any other life, including his own.
Harry went to his desk, shifting the top layer of his filing tower onto it with a thud and a wince. He'd been letting things pile up. Just because they had a high-profile case that was taking the majority of the department's resources didn't mean that the rest of the normal workload had ceased. He began reviewing and signing off on the case sheets Jones and Johnson had sent in for him over the last two weeks.
Pain. Betrayal. Anger. Lashing out. His petty crusade against Draco, which had put Scorpius at risk. He remembered the emptiness and agonising loss at the thought that Draco might be gone. Harry thought of the drop after doing a scene, of how good it felt to come home to Draco, of the freedom of someone knowing the darkest parts of him and not flinching away. He thought of what he may have already lost through his own actions.
Harry snorted, remembering the anger on Malfoy's face. 'I doubt it, Hermione. You didn't see him. He seemed desperate. I don't think he wants anything to do with me.'
He almost didn't catch Malfoy's words, as the darkness dragged him under.
Harry nodded and as the doors began to spin he watched her. Hermione waved her wand through the air, and a sideways figure eight glowed in the air for a moment before sweeping across the room to attach itself to one of the doors.
She paused and Harry nodded grudgingly, getting the feeling he knew where she was going with this.
Harry stepped closer, heedless of Malfoy's drawn wand. 'What happened?' he said. 'Where's Scorpius? How long has he been gone?'
Harry hissed, gasping out a moan and Draco stilled.
'A chance of what?' Draco said hopelessly. The memories of his despair and loss after Astoria's death tugged at him, whispering of the solace he could find in that dark place again.
He lay back on the couch and pulled Draco down beside him. Draco put his head on Harry's chest and his leg between Harry's, and Harry resumed his gentle stroking up and down Draco's back.
Harry opened his eyes and glared at Draco.
, his traitorous mind whispered.
Malfoy raised one unimpressed eyebrow and Harry flushed slightly, knowing exactly what he looked like. Malfoy's next words confirmed that. 'Anyone ever tell you that you look like your four year old when you do that?'
Harry shook his head, chewing and swallowing, 'No, I told
Then they walked through the shark walk, and they could see fish and shark swimming under their feet, and all of them got a bit lost in the wonder of being a part of the underwater world.
Pheo stuck her head up, bobbing it slightly as a drop hit her.
Then there were slick fingers rubbing over his hole - in him, smooth and pressing, the burn of them adding to the burn of want through him. He pushed down onto them. Wanting it deeper. Needing to be - to be -
(See the end of the chapter for
'Pleased to meet you as well.' Davies reaches over the table to shake Harry's hand and it's obvious he means to cement the dominance he'd established in their initial interaction.
'No shit,' Harry said, wiping his hair away from his forehead briefly.
'Have you ever been edged?' he asked, after a long moment, eyes meeting Harry's again.
you,' Malfoy says, and he tries to wiggle out from under Harry. Harry tightens his grip and Malfoy freezes.
'Fuck's sake, Potter. What if they have a listening charm in the bar? I
It was then that the bomb went off.
Harry watched the patch of wetness shrink and then disappear, and wished more than anything that there was a spell to do that with people. He shook himself. Shook off the image that flashed before his eyes for a moment. James on the floor and blood. So much blood. He locked it away far, far inside himself. He couldn't see that again. He couldn't. Instead he lifted his head blinking slowly. He didn't look Ron in the face. Couldn't do that either. Instead he watched Ron's hands. His hands were strong. Freckled. Harry remembered wondering if James would freckle. If he would have Ginny's colouring or Harry's. They'd always been so careful about his sun charms, and now—
Harry was speaking before he'd consciously decided to.
Malfoy smiled down at her progress, twitching slightly when her tongue flicked out onto his neck.
The driver turns around to give him a look as though he is particularly slow and Harry shakes himself out of his disbelief, opening the door and stepping onto the street. He can feel the deep bass of the music inside vibrating through him immediately and he knows inside it must be overwhelming.
It feels so strange—so wrong—to refer openly to the part of him that he's been so careful to keep hidden. But Draco doesn't even blink at the reference to his other senses. He shakes his head. 'I think it's too risky. We don't know what sort of follow up they might do the day after a drop, or what other traps are laid down there. That magic—the room we were in—it's old magic. I don't think the people that are activating it have a particularly good handle on what it does.'
Draco smiled and arched into him, twisting his upper body slightly so he could reach behind himself, tangling his fingers in Harry's mess of hair.
open presents?'
Harry felt the fire of his need blaze through him again. He didn't think he'd ever been so turned on in his life. He nodded, squeezing his eyes shut beneath their cloth covering.
'Two dead, six injured. From what we can ascertain, one of the dead was a Muggle waiter at the venue - white, late twenties, male. The other has been confirmed as Cordelia Avery, forty three, Pureblood, married with two children. The family was informed an hour ago.' Harry winced at the news.
Harry didn't know how much time had passed before he came out of his fitful doze and felt alert enough to keep his eyes open. His room was dark, the curtains drawn, and the house was silent. He pulled the covers back slowly, feeling the burn of his back and ribs as he moved. He brought his hand up to his throat - remembered being collared, helpless. He remembered the freedom - the freedom of finally letting himself feel.
'I gathered,' she said, 'from the way you came home glowing every few weeks. You fucked him, then?'
'Of course, come through. Dinner's almost done, if you want some?'
'Enjoy your evening, sir,' came a murmured voice from behind them.
Harry shakes his head, unconsciously breathing in, so that Malfoy's sharp scent fills his nostrils, clearing some of the desperate need he'd just inhaled.
'Hmm?' Draco asked, looking down at Harry, his fingers stilling momentarily before they began stroking through Harry's hair again.
His eyes flitted from person to person, until he found what he was looking for. He felt his heart stop in his chest for a moment as he saw a slim man seated near the window, his hair almost white, his posture rigid. He could only see the back of the man's head as he tilted it to say something to the man opposite him, but Harry knew. This was Malfoy. He'd found him. Abruptly, the nausea came curling back, more powerfully than before, and for a moment, Harry was worried he would be sick. He pushed the impulse away. He was better than this. He was more in control than this.
'I read the Muggle newspapers,' Lucius said. 'Do you know what they are full of? Death. Killing. Rape. War. Terrorism. All they ever do is hurt each other. They're like rats in a sinking ship, tearing each other down in their struggle to survive.'
When Elders was finished, Lucius' lawyer stood. Harry recognised him from the questioning they'd brought him in for during the case - his name was Gregory Giles, and he was a slippery bastard. Harry had been singularly unsurprised to find he was the Malfoy family lawyer.
Harry shook his head, 'No. Thanks. I'm - I've had enough tonight.'
Harry laughed at the slightly alarmed look on Draco's face as he led them from the room.
'No, that's all,' he said, slipping off the stool and giving a bit of a wave as he walked towards the exit.
James was the reason he stayed. James was everything.
'You're brave and strong and you have a ridiculously noble streak that makes you do the right thing even if it's going to get you killed. Your wolf is those things as well, if you let him be.'
Harry looks at him, not understanding. Malfoy rolls his eyes in exasperation. 'I prefer cocks, Potter, not that it's any of your business. Owning women and selling them for the pleasure of men is very much not a space I play in.'
Dahlia gave nothing away, eyes meeting his coolly.
The thought made him frown and he glanced around the room, checking to make sure he had everything. His next stop was his room, where he gathered the few changes of clothes he took on every trip. His invisibility cloak. The more extensive potions kit he took for long range field first aid.
times before. He looked to be in his early fifties, hair graying and face worn, but despite that his gaze was sharp.
He looked almost exactly the same as he had thirteen years before, when Harry had seen him at his trial - when he'd spoken for Malfoy's wife and son, but not for him. Never for him. His long blond hair still flowed down over his shoulders, shining in the light from the room. His face was still pointed and cruel, lined now but retaining that edge of contempt.
'Not a good idea?' Ginny queried, eyes on the home improvement show on the screen.
'I need this to go well, Potter,' Malfoy says, slipping his phone into the pocket of his joggers as he walks back to the table and collects his glass, draining it. He looks down at Harry, still sprawled across the couch, and there is no trace of the openness he'd displayed a few minutes before.
He turned as a voice behind him said his name in a tone of surprise.
Draco tightened his fist and the leather band dug into his skin, the tiny prick of pain barely registering compared to the tidal wave of anguish that was threatening to drown him if he let it in.
Harry rolled his eyes. 'I'd need to have a whole bunch of those drinks before that happened,' he said.
'Level 4: Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures.'
'And no one thought to mention this to me, at any point?' Harry asked, voice reaching a level of disinterest he was proud of. Underneath it, he could feel his anger stir to life.
Harry remained quiet, as Draco tried to unravel his own thoughts, but then he spoke, and there was an almost-defiant note in his voice, as though he was expecting to be told he was wrong.
Draco felt himself unaccountably on edge as he Flooed to the Ministry and signed in, collecting his badge and making his way to the lifts. He tried to pull himself together. It was just Potter. He could run rings around Potter. Surely it wouldn't be that hard to sit down and have a civil conversation with the man about achieving public safety outcomes. But then a wisp of a memory flickered to life in his mind: the desperate sense of loss in Harry's eyes as he'd reached up to unfasten Draco's – Ladon's – collar from his neck. The shuddering tension that had filled him as his magic flooded back into him and he began to put the mask of Harry Potter, Head Auror and Golden Boy, back on.
She frowned, 'But a few years ago, when you went alone, you -'
Draco opened his mouth to say something else, but Harry leaned forward, zipping off towards the flock. He pushed all of his inappropriate thoughts from his mind and just focussed on flying and on the job they had to do. Draco joined him after a moment and they went back to being a seamless team, flying on opposite sides of the flock until the Snidgets started to tire and descend to the flowers to feed.
He has no further reason to stall and he knows if he stands there much longer he's going to be late. Malfoy had said he was making contact with someone that night after all. Harry's hardly going to get the information he needs loitering out here.
'You might be able to make twenty toasties,' Harry deadpans, keeping his eyes on the page in front of him. He hears Draco huff and he bites back his smile.
Harry shrugged and Draco rolled his eyes, standing up, muttering under his breath. Harry caught something about 'fucking Ministry imbeciles,' before Draco gestured him to the couch. 'Sit. You want a drink?' Harry let out a deep sigh at the idea. He'd kill for a drink.
Draco shook his head slightly, then said, 'No.'
He's sitting at the table with his head in his hands.'It will wear off in another five minutes or so,' he says, Walter's thin voice muffled. 'Go and make yourself useful.'
Malfoy comes out of the bathroom a few minutes later and he's fully dressed, his shirt buttoned up to his neck. Harry looks at his collar, wondering if the teeth marks are still there, under the shirt, or if Malfoy healed them.
Harry looked up as a scuff of carpet indicated Draco was entering the room. He had Harry's collar held in one hand and a coil of rope in the other, and the look on his face was hot and full of wanting. His eyes raked over Harry's body as though he owned it … until he reached Harry's face, and their eyes met, and suddenly Harry could see a hint of uncertainty. He realised that this was new for Draco too - this was the first time he had done this with Harry knowing him, and wanting him, for himself.
When he's done, Harry smooths the paper out and lays it on the bed in front of him. He stares at it for a long moment, his fingers tracing over the pictures on the front page.
Harry woke up as he came, grinding into the mattress with a cry of pleasure. He could still feel Malfoy on him, in him. He could taste and smell Malfoy all around him. He pushed against the bed again, wanting to reach for the man behind him but aware with every passing moment that Malfoy wasn't there. That it hadn't been real.
this? Harry would never have let something like this happen to James. Malfoy had seemed fine with it... then Harry remembered the look of fear and longing which had flashed across his face. This whole situation was wrong.
Malfoy's mouth thins in displeasure. 'And that is exactly why you're the hired muscle and I'm the one hiring you. I know exactly what's needed for you to fit in and not embarrass me, and it's a tailored suit and you need it now. So shut up and hurry up.'
Ron made a face. 'Too much information, Harry. She's still my little sister.'
'I was bitten,' Harry says, and he feels the words shift something inside himself; opening a part of himself that he has kept closed and hidden for what feels like a lifetime. 'On a job.'
'Vanished it,' he says, as the memory comes back to him.
'We both almost died last night,' Draco says, slapping his hand away. 'We're done for today. We need to rest.
He distracted himself by thinking about the weather issue. He had been mulling over Shacklebolt's words from the day before almost constantly. The rain showed no sign of letting up, which meant whoever the Minister had picked to investigate what was happening showed no sign of being competent. Harry scratched a quick memo off to Hermione on his lunch break, tapping it with his wand so that it formed into a boat. He stuck it on the river that was now flowing down the corridor and into the lifts. Her response came back quickly.
He can’t sleep, not with the moon so high, but he closes his eyes and rests, feeling his body strengthening slowly. The rage in him is a simmer. He doesn't want to tear the den apart and hunt this time. He has had his kill for the night. He and his mate are a pack now, they have hunted together, and that is enough to let him rest.
He moved into a jog as he got close enough to see the Auror stationed at the front door. The man drew his wand and called out a challenge. Harry forced himself to slow. He tucked his wand into his jacket and stepped into the light with his hands raised. He recognised the Auror, Jeffries. He was in Ron's team. It seemed Jeffries recognised him as well, because his stance relaxed and he lowered his wand slightly.
Harry took in the words and felt like his insides had turned to glass, felt like one tiny tap would send him splintering to pieces. He took in a deep, shaky breath.
The movement presses against Harry's cock, which he realises is half hard. He rumbles his satisfaction and licks at the skin again, before sucking at it as he gives a little hum of pleasure.
He paused in front of the door and straightened his robes again, before knocking lightly.
'Harry? Harry! Are you in there? Open up.'
'What did you do to him?' Weasley asked, remaining standing and crossing his arms. Granger reached up to him, tugging him into a seat beside her and he slumped back, scowling across at Draco, clearly expecting an answer.
'Change your glamour again,' Malfoy says, and Harry nods, dropping his fingers to his wand in his pocket. The magic is sluggish to his touch, but it seems he's succeeded because Malfoy turns the key, gunning the engine to life.
Draco sighed. 'Trust is such a delicate thing. Do you know the first person I trusted in years? Back in school?'
He looked to one side, pressing his hips back helplessly, as the man behind him gripped him harder - fucked him deeper.
Scorpius reached into his blankets and pulled a bear out, holding it to his chest as he spoke, as though drawing comfort from it. Harry's hand dropped down, almost unconsciously, to the Mokeskin pouch at his hip and the bear he had inside. James' bear. His son should have had the chance to grow up. What was being done to this child was an abomination.
'Service access,' Ron said, in response to Harry's curious look. 'Kitchens, waste disposal, stock orders, that sort of thing.'
Scorpius nodded, and Draco could see his son's worry over his strange actions melting away.
'Fuck, Harry,' Draco gasped. 'That's it. So good. You're so good.'
going to be calling it, thank you very much Hermione. It had the benefit of being cooler up there, but apart from that, he didn't find much to go on, and the Aurors on duty kept giving him strange looks. Yes, technically, solving weather-related mysteries had nothing to do with his job description, but unless the changes were maliciously created, it probably wasn't the Aurors' jobs either. The lot of them were just too full of their own self-importance and too protective of their own patch. Ron excepted, Harry thought reflexively, as he always did when thanking Merlin that he'd talked himself out of being an Auror.
Harry watched the spot he had been, wondering why Malfoy just wouldn't get out of his head. Wondering why the man had opened his own mind and laid it bare for Harry to view.
Harry looked up at Draco, pillowing his chin on one hand as he considered Draco's words. He was beautiful, Draco realised as he looked at him. Even after he'd rejected the mere thought of Draco a moment ago, there was something so captivating about him. Draco had never thought of Harry as beautiful before. Fierce, proud, arrogant and dangerous, yes, but like this, loose and comfortable with eyes full of feeling...
The next day was the same. Harry didn't even have to go looking for Malfoy. He just appeared in Harry's doorway first thing in the morning. Harry didn't notice him for a moment, as he shifted through folders on his desk.
'Food will be brought for you.' Mac began to leave, but then turned back. 'Welcome to New York, Catalyst,' she said, with a brief incline of her head, face still cold. 'Let's see that we make the right change, this time.'
Harry shook his head, feeling overwhelmed by the speed at which everything was happening.
'They're also happy not to ask too many questions, provided the facts I bring them check out, and the story is juicy,' Malfoy says, seemingly oblivious to the path Harry's thoughts have taken
Malfoy takes a sip of his wine, appraising Harry with dark eyes that look wrong, though they hold the same level of intensity that he remembers seeing from across the Great Hall for so many years.
Somehow Harry could feel the moment Malfoy understood the situation - his satisfaction, laced with annoyance, as he realised Harry had acted alone, that no one knew where he was.
Harry came back to himself as he looked down at the drawer again, remembering that moment in a new light. Was Malfoy connected to Death too? Had that been what he was doing, all those years ago, when he put things elsewhere? Harry's earlier thought came back to him. Was Malfoy a Catalyst, too? Was he mixed up in all of this? Or had his appearance in the news footage been a coincidence?
He unfolded the note, looking at it alongside the memories that were swirling enticingly up at him. It was brief and unsigned.
Draco gasped as one of the tentacles wormed its way up between his arse cheeks. The intrusion was quick, a push against his clenched hole and then gone as it continued its exploration.
By the time he pulled up out the front of Malfoy Manor, Harry was tired and cold, and thinking that perhaps pushing on through the night had been a bad idea. Malfoy was hardly likely to invite him in for a chat this close to midnight, was he? But he was here now, so he may as well make the best of it.
Conor stood too, and the look on his face held concern.
I tilt my arm, so that he can see the Morsmordre that still claims my forearm, proclaiming my hate to the world.
Ron was looking at him as though he regretted even bringing up the subject.
should stay out of
'Do you want to wear my leather jacket again?' Harry asked, turning his attention back to Draco.
'How long?' Harry asks and his voice is rough. His mind is spinning. He can't push himself into any sort of equilibrium—and sort of reality where Malfoy knows he's a werewolf.
'Save it, Harry,' Ginny said, voice quieter now. 'I'm so sick of hearing it. Go and tell mum. She might believe you.' With that she turned away from the television - away from Harry - and left the room.
Harry nodded and wordlessly sent a thicker sheaf of papers to her, noting the eyes of the other Wizengamot members as they lingered on the lack of a wand in his hand. He felt a curl of satisfaction as he noted Javier's scowl.
Malfoy nodded, eyes lingering on him.
I also want to shout out to all of you lovely people for leaving me such amazing thoughts and comments through this story. Reading a WIP is a pain in the arse, so thank you so much.
At the entrance to Davies' offices Draco pauses. Harry almost runs into the back of him as he looks to see what the issue is. There's an electronic access pad on the wall, the kind that requires a swipe card, which Draco most definitely does not possess.
It was only a second later before Draco's question was answered as he felt his arse cheeks spread and then Harry's tongue was on him.
Draco's eyes fluttered for a moment, his only concession to the pleasure, and then he picked up his book. 'Carry on, then.'
'And the paperwork you send out?' Harry asked. 'There are coercion spells on it.'
Ron grimaced. 'I've already been to work. I came by because the last two times I have, you haven't been here and you haven't been answering my owls and Dean just owled me to say he saw you at a club last night and you looked really out of it. But yeah, we can go to work together if you like.'
Harry turned his thoughts back to what he was doing. The Repair Manual he'd ordered from the Muggle bookshop near the Ministry had arrived the day before and he was sitting on the workbench, the bike uncovered before him, flipping thought it, trying to get his head around the unfamiliar terminology. At least the thing wasn't still filthy with crusty pond water and twelve-year-old mud. The first thing he'd done on uncovering it again was to give it a detailed clean, by hand, rather than a
'Of course,' Draco said, '
Harry felt the weight of his past pressing heavily on him. Why couldn't they all just leave him be? Why did everyone have to have a piece of him?
Draco nodded again, glad that Granger had seen the same things he had.
His face ached and he could feel pain radiating from several spots on his body where people had hit or kicked him before he'd managed to push them back. He thought of the surging fury of the crowd, the spectral creature he'd seen burst into life.
'You're an Auror, Potter,' Malfoy says. 'Whether they sacked you or not. I wasn't sure if you'd be able to help yourself.'
Harry shakes off the thought as his eyes are drawn into the first few words and he begins to read.
Draco sighed, feeling some of the tension enter his shoulders again at the reminder of his Aunt's words.
They move swiftly and the pile of files grows on the desk. Davies' office isn't visible from the entry way, but Harry keeps an eye on the door. He'll stun Joseph if he has to. It's fifteen minutes before they're done and Draco shrinks all of the duplicated files down, tucking them into his pocket.
He blinked and Malfoy was gone. The walkway was full of bodies and the trees were blackened skeletal figures.
Draco looked at her, feeling a tendril of hope unfurl inside him. He crushed it. He couldn't afford to hope.
'Good,' Ladon said, running a finger lightly down Harry's side, over his ribs. Ladon's gaze followed his touch and with a jolt, Harry realised exactly what he was seeing.
Sometimes he wondered how much of that was real, and how much of that was the Estates keeping up appearances, as generations of magical owners had trained them to do. In the absence of those owners they carried on, expending their magical energy to preserve themselves beautifully for families who would never return. Harry sipped his whisky and thought of the wild tangle of his own garden at Grimmauld Place. He wondered what the state of that house said about its owners, past and present. Ginny had given up on it years ago. She'd never had much of a green thumb, but Harry found the untamed jumble of life suited his moods some days.
'So good,' Draco whispered, as he reached behind himself, hand closing around Harry's hard cock for the first time that night. Draco closed his eyes as he positioned himself above Harry, breathing out sharply as he pushed down.
Harry moved closer, the words coming to him as he concentrated.
This isn't an excuse. He doesn't feel comfortable staying in a space he hasn't personally verified and strengthened the wards on. He never would have, but the instinct is stronger now. His den needs to be secure and he doesn't try and push back against that particular need. In this one thing, the wolf and him are aligned.
'Thank you for your visit, Head Auror.'
'You're so wired, you're vibrating, Potter. You don't need coffee. Now drink your damned milk.'
'I just had to help my friend with something,' he said, hoping Scorpius wouldn't register the hint of a shake in his voice.
Harry nodded. Most of the latest people they'd looked into had turned out to be overseas or long dead.
Potter shakes his head, as though he's trying to shake something into place. 'So you're actually doing this?' he asks. 'Prostitution?' As though it's not abundantly clear that was what he meant from the fact that he called my fucking pimp to hook up this little social call.
'And that's why I'm going to speak to you instead of going to Javier with my concerns.'
He'd taught Blaise that song. He and Blaise had comforted each other with it, after the war. When things had been hard and dark and cold.
the mess, or leave it. A review of the memories and the various substances Charlie was often covered in meant the snot probably had to stay in place. Draco's frown deepened in distaste.
Malfoy let out a sound. Disbelief? Hurt?
Harry pulled back to give him an unimpressed look. He and Dean had an agreement. They went out, they had fun, they got wasted, they pulled and they went home. They didn't fucking keep tabs on each other.
'Does the door work the same, then? For every room in the house?'
Harry nodded, feeling guilt and torment rise up in him like bile. He needed to be punished for this. He deserved to be.
'What? Young, fit and funny?' she said, clearly trying to lighten the melancholy that had entered the room.
'Jeffries got ten years,' Harry says, not knowing what else to say.
'It sounds good. Do I need to bring anything?'
Draco dropped his eyes, shame rising through him at the memory of just how seriously he'd betrayed Harry.
Teddy shook his head. 'It's not like that in the castle. And Draco gave me a coin to use if I ever needed help.' Teddy shrugged, like it wasn't an issue. Harry felt a twinge of pain that Malfoy was closer to his godson than Harry was - that he was there for the boy when Harry was wrapped up in his own problems.
His eye snags on a discarded letter and he reaches over to pull it out from underneath a file. Harry looks at Ron's handwriting, at the note filled with worry, wondering if he was okay, where he had spent the moon, if he needed them.
'As always, we will begin with some, shall we say, less-tantalising items.'
'Won't the We- your wife notice?'
The second man was dark-skinned, well built and carrying a box, which he placed in the center of the room. He unfolded a stand from the bottom of it and opened the box.
soon. 'From what Malfoy said -' Ron looked impressed now, proud, rather than awed. 'You turned time, Harry. You bloody - somehow, you - they were dead he said. All of them. And you pulled time back … or something …' he trailed off and Harry felt his memory unspool.
. Harry felt his thoughts sharpen as anger flared to life. These were his memories. Malfoy was in his head.
But he doesn't. He doesn't say anything as he follows behind Malfoy, not daring to look back at Davies. If he had to see that smug face one more time…
Harry spent two days thinking and planning before he visited his London post box. He half-thought Ron might jump out of the shadows, but he opened it unmolested. He'd expected a letter back from Conor, but it was Aoife who had written to him. He wasn't surprised to see she wrote the way she spoke. It was pages and pages of information in a quick, scribbled hand. He skimmed it quickly.
He rounded the corner to see an empty corridor, a number of doors leading off it. He frowned, looking around. There was no sign of whoever had been in such a hurry. It could have been nothing - it was probably nothing - but something about the whole interaction seemed off to Harry. He cast a locator spell, something that would usually show him the footprints that had been left in the last few minutes, but nothing showed up. Whoever had just left was trailing a minor disillusionment behind them.
Harry felt a stab of guilt run through him at her words. He thought about the night before - the brutal honesty of facing his demons, his pains and truths.
'State your full name, the reason you are here and one embarrassing fact about yourself.'
The man in the corner booth is thin and his teeth are crooked. He reaches forward to clasp Malfoy's hand in his, giving a smile that reeks of insincerity. He pays no attention at all to Harry. Harry makes sure he takes in all the features and defining characteristics. This man could be important or could be no one, but he has to be thorough.
A hand grabbed his arm and refused to be shrugged off. There were words, but he couldn't make them out, couldn't see or hear anything. And then someone shook his arm and everything around him snapped into razor-sharp focus.
Malfoy's face became less impressed. 'None of your business. You slept, now go home.'
Draco let the words flow through him as he tried to figure out what they meant. Was Harry talking about his parents? His godfather? What did this have to do with his husband?
It soared up into the sky, joining Draco's, flying around it, as though teasing it.
else.
He took another two paces before Molly stepped in front of him.
Harry shook his head. 'Seeker's game. Me and you. We never did have one. I used to play against the other seekers all the time, but you always trained alone.'
'The Horsemen,' Luna said simply, as though the answer were obvious.
He shivered when he got out of the shower and the cold air hit his skin. He wrapped the towel around himself, huddling into its warmth. Then he dried himself slowly, wincing at the aches of his body as he bent and moved. He realised, as he picked his t-shirt up to slip it over his head, that his clothes were days old, and smelled it. He wrinkled his nose and considered for a moment looking through the drawers in the room or asking Draco if he had spares. The thought made him snort in wry laughter. It was getting too easy to forget that they weren't friends outside the dream - that the Draco he was seeing was a completely different person from the Malfoy in the real world.
'He doesn't know it's me,' Draco muttered, the guilt swirling in a new direction. He hadn’t meant things to get as far as they had - had never expected that Harry would return to the club, let alone that he would demand a scene. The memories surged back into his mind and Draco let them wash over him. He'd been reliving both of Harry's scenes on repeat - barely able to believe they'd happened. Harry had been so perfect - so responsive. He'd never had anyone fall as hard or far under his hands as Harry had. The memories were still raw and brutal in their intensity. He didn't think he'd ever realised - ever understood - what Potter had wrapped up inside him, through all of those long, hard years. He wondered if he had, whether things might have turned out differently.
Harry had destroyed the lot of it, but containing the explosion of magic each time he released a curse in order for the item to be Incendioed had taken its toll on him. He'd ridden his bike back afterwards, and the flight over the ocean had sapped the last of his energy. He felt like every step was an effort he didn't have in him.
It wasn't until he'd started to speak to Jayne about Draco that he'd seen the fear he was wrapping himself up in.
Hermione's dark eyes fixed on Harry. 'He was really upset, Harry. They had to force him out. What's … I didn't know you and he were …' she trailed off, as though unsure what to say next.
Harry looked at him, surprised. 'Are you saying you want to spend time with Hermione and Ron? When was the last time you even spoke to them?'
Ron shakes his head immediately. 'Healers have orders for no contact outside basic medical personnel and family. When the kids show signs of being ready, we'll send in Cynthia Langley, down in Children's Services, but now they're just hoping they can get them to a place where they will start to feel safe.'
He revved the engine before kicking the lever to send it flying into the air.
They drive for an hour in silence, Harry watching the countryside go by out the window as he tries not to focus all of his attention on the wound in his back. It should be healing by now. He can feel the burn of it, but instead of easing off, it seems to be getting worse, the more time passes. He grits his teeth against it and watches the signs pass.
Harry nodded, 'Yeah whoever it is, they're not stupid.'
He caught his breath, pushing a finger up inside himself and grunting at the feeling. He moved it in and out, teasing a second against his rim, but not wanting to - not without being told he could.
'I could die?' he asked, choosing his words carefully. He needed to know. This was the moment he would find out, he knew.
'Harry-' she began, and then paused, cocking her head to one side. 'Why ever would you say sorry for that?'
Draco just rolls his eyes and stands. 'You got anything decent to drink in this place?' he asks, moving towards Harry's pantry.
'What we should be doing,' Pansy continued, 'is figuring out how we're going to fix this.'
Molly greets them at the door and envelops Harry in a hug. He relaxes into her warm embrace, not letting go of his grip on Draco's hand. He's seen her since they finished the case, of course. One of the first things he did was come back here and make sure everyone was alright—let them know he was alright. But this, bringing Draco here to meet them, this feels big.
Draco tried to think, but Harry's hands were everywhere; his attention shifted from Harry's mouth to the sounds he was making and the feeling of his body grinding against Draco's lap. He could feel himself becoming overwhelmed by how close Harry was and how many things were happening all at once.
Harry scowled at him and left the room, collecting his jacket from the arm of the chair as he called out to Scorp that he would see him soon. He got back an excited. 'For your party, Harry! I'll be there.'
He clears his throat, though he can't quite meet Draco's eyes as he speaks. 'Do—do you think I could just wipe us down?' he asks.
Malfoy didn't turn back around, his shoulders stiff and angry.
Then he returned his gaze to the lists in front of him, spreading them out on the table. He read through the now-familiar words, heat curling in his chest as he thought of how he might fill in the forms anew … knowing it was Draco he was completing them for.
Harry lay awake in the darkness, thinking about her response to his request. She'd done it … but he didn't get the sense she'd particularly enjoyed it. Ladon's words ghosted back through his mind.
Harry looked down at his feet, feeling a dull sickness at the realisation that he was standing on the legs of a child, her eyes sightless as she screamed silently up at the sky.
It was the one he'd taken from the house before he left. The one of James. Harry held it and watched as James cackled in laughter, almost tipping himself off the side of the couch. A moment later Harry's head appeared, as he took off the Invisibility Cloak. James was obscured for a moment and then Harry disappeared again and James returned. His face was startled before he burst back into happy laughter.
'And then what?' Harry asks, still suspicious. It couldn't be as simple as that.
He flicked to the last two pages to see four images drawn there. Each was named in turn. He recognised the first, the Seal of Triumph. It was the circle containing the diamond and the infinity triangles which he'd seen on Daniela, and which the Preservation was perverting.
'He said trust is a two-way street and that if he ever wanted to earn yours back, he had to put that power back in your hands.'
'Yes,' Draco answered absently, not taking his eyes off the glass. He was growing more and more certain by the moment that Harry was behind the one-way glass - that Harry was watching as one of his interrogators attempted to get Draco to admit to something he hadn't done. The idea sent a wave of cold fury through him and Draco felt himself slip completely into the mindset he drew on when he dommed.
'Have you been keeping well?' Harry asked, wanting to request what he came for, but at the same time, not wanting to rush through this. There was something about Jakub that made Harry feel it was important to take the time—to show him respect.
Harry thought of school. The park. Their kids. Their house. The club. Malfoy inserting himself in a hundred ways into Harry's life. Malfoy giving him what he wanted and needed again and again, in a way no one ever had. 'You're making a life for us. The two of us - together.'
But then she moved her arms, scratching her nails lightly down over his back.
He felt like there was a chasm between them, one standing on each side, and in the middle a lifetime of reasons not to broach it. The easy certainty of the night before as they'd stood united in bringing Lucius down was gone, leaving this stiff distance. Harry wasn't sure how to cross it, wasn't sure whether Draco wanted him to.
'I killed one of them... or released it, maybe. I think I made things worse.'
'James deserves better than this, mate,' he said, grief and disappointment in his voice.
Her confirmation sent his mind reeling, connections beginning to form faster than thought, as the threads of his research and the images from his dreams began to come together, finally forming into a picture he could understand.
'Have you eaten?' he asked.
Harry sat heavily back into his seat, relief and confusion warring in him. He wanted to be angry at Malfoy, for making him think he had a sword hanging over his head, and at the same time, something in him responded to the fact that Malfoy hadn't carried out his threat, for whatever reason.
Harry missed his baby so badly it felt like he was missing a part of himself. Like something in his chest had been ripped away and would never be returned. There was a lightness to his arms that always felt wrong. He didn't let himself feel it—
'Would you ever want to—' Harry cleared his throat, looking vaguely unsure of himself '—to do it in person... like with a real creature?' His cheeks were subtly darker in that way that Draco knew meant he was blushing hard.
Harry had a very strong feeling Jakub was not, in fact, even human.
'Half a year?' he growled. 'I've been tearing myself apart because I kissed someone on the weekend and you've been fucking around for
'I was … connected to Voldemort for a long time.' He reached up, tracing his fingers down the scar that started at his hairline and ran in jagged lines down his forehead, over his eye and down onto his cheek. The old scar was a familiar thin ridge of pain and loss.
Harry could tell there was more to it than that - there always was, with Malfoy - but he didn't have the energy to pursue it.
Draco looked at her, feeling the shock of the words hit him, and then the meaning of them and the reasons behind them.
'Matter of pride, it is. Pride. You Know Who couldn't push us out. Little bit of hot weather certainly wouldn't be able to, eh?'
'So,' Harry said, with a grin. 'Amuse me.'
Harry didn't bother with pleasantries. He dropped into the seat opposite her.
bike. Then he locked that grief away with all the rest and stood.
Draco took his meaning immediately, shaking his head decisively. 'My father is perfectly sane,' he said. 'It's his ideas that are not. My mother never gardened. Never. She liked to walk in the gardens. She liked to enjoy the gardens. But she never tended them.'
He could feel himself begin to shake, giant tremors rocking through him. He tried to breathe through them but he couldn't catch his breath. Couldn't think.
That was all the permission Harry needed. He pushed forward, reaching for Ladon's belt buckle, but Ladon caught his hands, holding them in a firm grip. Harry felt Ladon's magic tingle over him as their skin touched and he realised this was the first time they'd had physical contact without the collar present. His own magic flowed up to meet it, rushing forward like an excited puppy, suddenly calming from the anger it had been swirling with. He liked the sensation - had rarely felt such a reaction from someone else's magic against his. Ladon felt safe. Familiar.
'It felt like I knew you,' Harry said, rubbing softly over Draco's stomach, tracing the faint silvery lines of his scars. 'Being able to see you was different, but it felt like I knew your touch.'
'Fred Weasley.' He thought of Ginny's words - of how he'd failed Molly - forgotten her. He thought of all the Weasley's and how there was an eternal hole in their family, because of him. He thought of Fred and felt like a thousand lashes wouldn't be enough. He continued. He could do nothing else.
Harry groaned. 'Shit. Big meeting with the Minister and the Auror departments from the International Confederation. Javier put up some bullshit proposal about reducing Auror numbers and half the room was for it.' He gritted his teeth, feeling his frustration rise again. Why couldn't any of them
'Draco's angry - furious. I think - I don't think he has any control over the what the weather does.'
The court was already assembled when Harry walked in the door, and he cursed internally when he saw that Myrcella Marchbanks was presiding today. The Chief Warlock wasn't always present, but when she was Harry was guaranteed a fight to get what he needed.
It was another three weeks before Harry returned to Release.
'Mr Potter, Unspeakable Granger. This is very irregular.'
I had this all planned out ... and then Harry decided he was going to investigate the club, so major parts of the story and Harry's characterisation are going to be re-framed. But I think it will work just as well.
'Hmm,' Hermione said, watching him closely. 'You went to his New Years party as well.'
Draco's head whipped up and he felt anger surge through him.
'They watch me.' He hadn't thought about it until he said it, but as he spoke, the nightmare came flooding back. Four hooded figures facing away from him. Running towards them, desperate, somehow, to find out why they were there. Desperately knowing that if he didn't, something bad would happen.
'The Cock and Bull,' Pansy said. 'Drinks with Heathcote.'
Ron just shrugged, kicking at the ground. 'It's Jeffries' case, not mine.'
He busied himself for a moment, and then turned back to Matthias and began painting in long, sure strokes. His brush left thick, black lines curving across Matthias' chest, swirling in intricate patterns, shapes Harry could just make sense of.
Abruptly, Harry realised the situation wasn't out of control.
'Hunter James,' he says to the woman on the reception desk. She takes him in, her eyes widening slightly and Harry has to stop himself from wrinkling his nose at the smell of her sudden interest.
'Ready?' he yelled over his shoulder.
He sees my reaction and he leans forward. 'I'm sorry, that— that wasn't what I meant. I shouldn't... I have no right to judge anyone. I'm sorry.'
His exit from the Centre was just as easy as his entry; a stolen robe, a glamour, and a smile that felt wrong on his face, and he was back on the street. He walked for fifteen minutes, taking a meandering path until he was sure he hadn't been followed, and then entered the small alley he'd left his bike in. No one he passed paid him any attention. It wasn't advisable to show too much interest in strangers these days, after all.
Harry made his way through the room, dropping his jacket at the coat check and thanking the Muggle woman there, then rolling his sleeves up to his elbows. It was warm in the room. He collected a glass of Edradour Ballachin from the bar, not surprised this place was stocked with the expensive stuff, then strolled over to look out the window, gazing at the city below. It was breathtaking from up this high, seeming almost motionless, distant lights twinkling in the darkness.
'I'm ready for stories, papa,' he said, and then stopped as he saw Harry. A moment later his whole face lit up in recognition. 'Mr. Harry! Why are you at my house?'
'I don't give a shit if you know what I'm doing, Potter. Your entire investigation from start to end has been a joke.' He stared at Harry, his gaze challenging. 'I've been
Draco takes a sip of his drink and turns to look at Harry.
'Nothing happened. Place was a ghost town. She went in, had a few drinks and was the only person in the place all night. Apparently Malfoy spent the entire time sitting in the corner watching her like some creepy spider.'
Harry looked back at the words he'd underlined. Cloak, wand, stone. He knew where the wand was; back in Dumbledore's grave, where it belonged. It couldn't possibly be linked to all of this, could it? He turned his attention back to the story. He knew what happened to the brother with the wand. He was killed for it. And then others killed for it over and over again through history. Harry frowned at the idea, at the possibility that he might need to bring that trouble back into his life.
A vivid image of people screaming, running, burning, flashed into Harry's mind and he flinched away from it. He closed his eyes and breathed deeply for a moment. He had to calm himself. He had to forget about what had happened, just for a moment. Just until he was safe. He took in another deep breath and then opened his eyes and looked around.
Draco hissed his pleasure and Harry felt the hand tighten, then Draco's mouth was on his, breathing the air as it left Harry's lungs. Draco was all around him, on him, a part of him. In that instant Draco controlled him fully, held his life and death in his hands.
Ron straightened and pulled his wand out, casting
'Do you understand me?' she said, her face as serious as Harry had ever seen it.
galleons.
averse to another go, I have a feeling Weasley and his friends will be back very soon and this probably isn't how you want them to find us.'
Harry barely hears the words as he flips open the brochure and looks at the other pictures.
Davies' lip curls slightly in an unspoken threat, but he turns back to Malfoy, clasping one of his hands in two meaty paws.
'No more lies,' Draco said, voice rough, looking Harry in the eyes, and knowing he meant so much more than what he was about to say. 'What happened?'
He wrote to Ron, starting up a series of 'remember when's' that often had him laughing into the quietness of the garden, or startling the customers at a coffee shop. It helped, to remember the laughter and fun, alongside the terror and pain.
He feels an edge of darkness woven into the wards, and wonders what would have happened if he'd brought Aurors with him and tried to Apparate them inside.
'Yeah,' he said. 'I know.'
Harry smiled at her, knowing there was nothing simple about what she'd just said. There was weeks of work in that research alone. She waved him off as if reading his thoughts. 'It’s nothing. The Librarian did most of it anyway. He has quite the interest in the Hallows, it turns out.'
Harry stayed silent, arms crossed. There was no point in defending himself. Robards had made up his mind a long time ago.
Harry didn't care. None of it was real. Malfoy had proved that with his lies upon lies.
it's happening?' Harry asked.
He spent a lot of time dreaming. In and out of consciousness. Sometimes he was at St. Mungo's, sometimes at home. Once, he thought he recognised the Burrow. When he could get whisky, or Gillyweed, they helped to dull everything for a while, make it all go away. Even the dreams stopped on those nights - faded, washed out things that they were. Sometimes he wondered if it was a blessing to forget Draco's touch, to forget the faces of his children. But he was watched more and more, and oblivion became harder to find.
He tried to think rationally about it all. Was it Death he saw in his dreams? Was it
This close to the full moon, all of his senses will be running at their peak, just like Harry's are. He always feels sharper and faster just before the moon. He always feels so much closer to being the beast that is inside him. The wolf stirs, pressing at him, eager to be released. Harry forces it down. He'll do the reconnaissance tonight and then take the suppressant potion to fight the moon off tomorrow night. It will be fine. It's always been fine.
, for fuck's sake.
He can't lose Draco.
'Indeed,' he says, smiling in return. 'There are all sorts of delicious things to be had in France, if only one knows where to look.'
', stepping closer to catch Malfoy's form as he fell, then he whirled back into Apparition, Malfoy's arm tight in his grasp.
Baatneil who asked a million other questions and led to you all getting another 5K of content and me getting a much, much stronger chapter
'And yes, I did know that,' Draco continued.
'I mean, yes like that. Definitely like that. I haven't been able to get you out of my head, even when I was mad at you.' Harry took a deep breath, forcing himself to slow down - to get this right.
'Coming,' Harry called, moving faster. He stepped into the kitchen and stopped in surprise.
'As much as I am absolutely
Malfoy just frowns, his mouth thin. 'Jimsonweed is resistant to magic. It can be treatable by Muggle means if you get to it within the first thirty minutes but most wizards don't know that. It's a poison Hit Wizards often use when they want to make someone suffer and leave a message.' He looks Harry in the eyes. 'If he'd scratched me with that knife, I'd be dead. I owe you my life, Potter. Again.'
'I'm sorry,' Draco said back. He trailed his fingers down Potter's arm until he was covering his balled-up fist. He gently encouraged Potter to open his hand, and he twined their fingers together.
'Who wants pancakes?' he said, in response, chuckling as Rose and Hugo both jumped up and down in excitement.
'Why the fuck would I agree to that?' Harry asks, Malfoy's words running through his mind.
He could feel himself starting to unravel. He couldn't do that here. Couldn't do it in front of his son. He had to hold it together long enough to get Scorpius in bed and then he could - he paused shaking his head mentally. No, that wasn't right. Something was tugging at the edges of his mind. Something important. About Harry. Draco shied away from the thought. He didn't want to think of Harry - he couldn't. The way he had left, the anger radiating from him as he ripped through the -
1. Someone sent a creature to kill James.
Harry thought about what it had been like the last few days, working alongside Draco. Draco was a little bit off too, he thought. He wasn't always all the way there in the way that people should be. But somehow, that made Harry feel more comfortable in his presence, not less.
'I'm going to bring you to the edge again and again,' he whispered in Harry's ear, breath hot on his throat. 'But I'm not going to let you fall until I give you permission.' Harry whimpered at the words - at the image they raised. He could already feel himself surrendering to what was about to happen, and he embraced the sensation.
She was seated at the kitchen table when he entered and she glanced up with a brief smile before returning to the copy of the newspaper in front of her.
'Wait,' Pansy said, swiveling around in her seat to look at him. 'You went to the aquarium … with Weasley and Granger … at Potter's invitation.'
He wouldn't let it happen.
He stepped off later that day, concentrated on where he needed to be, and Apparated. Weaving on his feet slightly as he landed, Harry reflected a single egg muffin probably wasn't enough food to sustain him. He pushed the thought away. He had more important things to focus on.
His smile deepened. He may not have Blaise's charisma, but he knew how to convey his focus and attention with his eyes, and nowadays, his attention was highly sought out.
'What's on for today?' Draco asked, transferring Pheo to his neck and reaching for a file.
Harry shrugged. 'I don't care if you believe it or not,' he turned slightly to include Blake in this statement as well. 'I told you. I saw him up close and nothing about him made me think he could be holding a Horseman. He's Muggle. He has no magical aura at all. He wasn't acting off. He didn't give me any sort of feeling of attraction or concern. I've seen one of the Horsemen in the flesh. I know what I'm looking for.'
Davies scent changes to something rank and challenging in response to Harry's unspoken threat. He turns, gesturing towards his office, deliberately putting his back to Harry as he places a hand on Malfoy's hip, gently steering him in the right direction. Malfoy doesn't protest the touch. Harry wants to rip Davies' hand off.
Harry turned his head to look at her, incredulity warring with his fury. 'We're not friends, and he's certainly not fucking family.'
He opens his eyes to his mate and they watch each other in the semi-darkness, as they both wait for the moon to fade from the sky.
'Harry,' said the voice of the person holding his arm. 'Harry, you need to breathe. Please, can you breathe with me?'
Harry is surprised at the way seeing Ron in his Auror uniform, looking relaxed and happy and totally at home at work, hits him like a punch in the guts. His old bitterness floods back through him.
Harry took one last look around the ASS and then stroked his finger along Pheo's back.
'Zabini,' he said in return, shaking the proffered hand almost automatically.
Granger shook her head. 'He told me about Ladon, yes, but I only just connected the dots. I've been doing some research into BDSM and into the man Harry said he'd been meeting with.' She raised an eyebrow at him. 'Ladon? Really. You thought a name that literally means 'Dragon of Hera' was a subtle way of hiding your identity?'
continue to rule. He died because he thought it was important to fight horrible people with horrible ideas, who wanted to take away the fun in the world.' Molly's voice cracked and Harry felt tears leak from the corner of his eyes. He bit his lip.
He floated there, watching them for a moment, casting about, trying to figure out if this was his memory or his dream. But then Hermione opened her eyes and began to scream, bubbles of air escaping her, floating to the surface far above in her panic. Harry poured all of his energy into speeding to her as he ceased to wonder. This was his nightmare. This was -
Malfoy appraises him and Harry feels his anger die back down. 'I think you're doing perfectly well for yourself now,' he says. Malfoy's face is filled with a complicated emotion that Harry can't quite read. The air between them feels charged with something unsaid.
He could hear Malfoy's steps, slow and heavy and Harry felt his mouth twist into a grin, though there was no mirth in it. Let him be afraid. Let him feel what it was to be helpless.
The adolescent squid's body was about the size of a horse, far smaller than the one he'd watched at Hogwarts. It was a dark green, mottled with black, but as Draco watched, patterns began to move across its skin, little flashes of red and yellow.
Harry winced. Ah. The Breakup Trip. That explained it.
He focussed again on what he knew.
Harry sped up immediately, kissing Draco hard and fast, almost frantically, as though something in him had been unleashed with the touch. His hands began to stroke over Draco's face, his neck, his chest, as though he couldn't settle on just one place, but needed to touch everywhere all at once, now that he was able to.
'That's why I'm here,' Malfoy agrees, smile widening a touch. Harry has to stop himself from jerking his head around to glare at Malfoy. What does he mean that's why he's here? To look at girls… or to source girls?
Harry looked back to Malfoy's face, feeling unexpected sympathy well up in him. He thought of his own life - the emptiness of Grimmauld Place, his inability to spend much time around anyone except for Ron and Hermione. He tried - he really tried - but people made him feel wrong. Anxious. Like if he stayed around them too long there would be restrictions and expectations and eventually, losses.
Draco moved to Harry's right leg, finishing the bindings down to just above his knee and then he stood, stepping back a pace to look Harry over, clearly admiring his work.
Harry felt those words echo through him. A Master. A Master of Death?
'Good morning, Mrs. Norris,' he said, reaching into his pocket for the bouquet of flowers he'd purchased and shrunk on his way in. He  waved his wand over them and then held the pink and white valerian blooms out to her.
He'd see a kid walking through the Atrium and would remember watching Malfoy with his son, and the care and love written through his whole body. It had been two days since Malfoy last tried to contact him. He'd tried to visit the Ministry - as if Harry wouldn't have thought to block him. A part of him wondered, as he sat in his office, catching up on case reports from the minor crimes team, whether Malfoy had given up. He didn't know whether the thought relieved him or disappointed him.
was printing increasingly outlandish stories about crazed Muggles with vendettas against wizardkind who were hell-bent on ridding the world of magic. They were marketing it as this century's witch hunts. Harry was tempted to release their list of suspects to curb some of the hysteria and take the focus off the Muggles, but they hadn't managed to track Rudolf Avery down and Harry didn't want him spooked in case he was connected to Lucius somehow.
Draco didn't speak as his hands moved. He preferred not to, when he worked with the ropes. It helped him to get a little lost as well, in the texture of the rope under his fingers, in the pattern he created on the person before him.
Ladon looked down at him, licking his lips quickly, then he closed his eyes briefly, as though struggling with something.
Harry reached out and gripped Malfoy's arm, holding him in place.
He'd been close to giving up … until he'd seen Harry from across the Ministry's Atrium floor as he made his way out the door. Harry had looked … wound up, as though he was wrapped around himself with layers of misery and anger and pain. He'd looked the way he had when he'd first walked into Release all those months ago - as though he had no idea where he was in life and where he should be. He'd looked as though he was shouldering all the burdens of the world single-handedly, and that that was his lot in life.
'How was your day?' Ginny asked, when he didn't comment further.
He let his arms loosen for just a second, just long enough to unbutton Draco's robes and slide them off his shoulders, then he slid out of his own Ministry robes and pulled Draco by the hand to the couch. He was still sniffing and hiccuping, wiping at his eyes as though ashamed of his outburst. Harry's lips quirked into a wry smile as he thought about how much worse a state Draco had seen him in.
There are layers to it, Harry thinks. Layers upon layers to whatever game Malfoy is playing. He recalls Malfoy's words about why he had agreed to have Harry work for him, despite Harry knowing his identity.
Harry heard a scrape as Ladon picked something up from the bench, and then the faintest of footsteps as he moved back towards Harry.
The last thing to fade was Malfoy's eyes, bright and silver and full of mockery in the darkness.
They spend a day sitting in a café together watching people coming and going. Malfoy makes small talk, telling him stories of people and places that belong to other times, other faces. The stories are the same though, no matter whose life he shares. Malfoy moves on alone, every time.
Harry relaxed back against Draco's chest, then smiled as another thought occurred to him.
Harry watched him go for a moment, then he turned back to the view, watching the city unfold below him as he sipped his drink. That had been … strange. Almost as if Zabini had information Harry didn't. He found his mind returning to the case with that thought, trying to puzzle through it. They were missing something obvious. Something big. He could feel it. He turned to survey the room again, leaning against the glass panel, watching the guests circle. He knew most of them, by sight and reputation, if not personally. He thought idly about the list of names Malfoy had given him, of people who had cause to want to disrupt the Society's aims. There had been half a dozen on there. None of them were present tonight.
A second later a bright green flash fills the air, and shouted words that smell of death echo in his ears.
'Yes, Chief Warlock,' Harry said, trying to bite back the words he wanted to say. 'I would draw your attention, however, to the fact that we first questioned those suspects under the assumption that the attacks were directed by Muggles. We did not have a clear connection to magical involvement, beyond the suspicion of an Imperius use.'
Harry's gaze sharpens and he freezes at those words. He spares a second to wonder why Draco's mentioning Remus now, of all times.
'Aren't you worried about getting caught?' he asks, looking at the tension in Malfoy's jaw and the way his fingers are clenched slightly too tight around the steering wheel.
Malfoy just looks at him, gaze serious. 'Until
He couldn't take the risk that Malfoy would feel the magic. He should be sufficiently distracted by his current activity as well as the serious levels of magic wrapping the entire suite, for the casting to go unnoticed.
Harry thought for a moment, the words sounding odd coming from the mouth of the put-together man in front of him. Then he thought back to what he'd seen that put-together man doing weeks ago at the Club and shivered.
He imagined faceless people watching as he was stretched out naked and he let his fingers slip into his mouth, sucking lightly on them. He hadn't tasted Ladon, but he wanted to.
'Fuck you,' Malfoy spits, standing, clearly done with the whole thing.
who mocked his misery with such gloating pleasure?
Harry knows, as soon as he speaks, that Draco has done it. His voice is full of excitement, almost feverish with it.
Harry felt a jolt of surprise and something more - yearning? - as he recognised Draco. Malfoy immediately stalked forward, towards the group of children.
'I did not watch you like a creep,' Harry objects, annoyance rising in him. 'If anything, you were watching me.'
He owled Ladon on a Thursday night.
He looked down at the picture propped up against the side of the case. It was still - taken on a Muggle polaroid camera and handed to him out of the blue. It showed him and Pansy, years ago, after school, after the War, and when they had been trying to figure themselves and the world out.
He had never felt so vulnerable in all his life and the feeling sent a jolt of arousal through him so strong that he cried out, thrusting his hips forward, hard into Draco.
Harry wanted to reply that Draco wasn't his mate, but he'd spent all week trying to forget the feeling of Draco's warmth against him, the way his mouth quirked when he was teasing Harry, the way he had burrowed his way into Harry's life like he'd always been there.
'Harry,' Hermione said, dismay on her face. 'What did you do? I
All the boys in his dorm did it. They were older when they started to do it. Younger when they talked about it. Harry could hear them in the night sometimes, before he learned to cast silencing charms.
'Hey,' Draco says, voice raw but gentle. 'You're okay. I've got you.' Draco's hands cover his, pushing them away gently as he works deftly at Harry's flies, pulling his trousers open and reaching inside to wrap a hot hand around Harry's cock. Harry cries out at the touch of him and bucks his hips forward. Draco pulls him into another kiss, and Harry spares the briefest through for the fact that he's covered in the scents and tastes of Draco and that Draco clearly has no issue with that.
'Are you sure?' Hermione asked. 'He definitely deliberately made it snow while you were with him? Did he use his wand? Did you hear a spell?'
Malfoy squeezes his fingers lightly and his grip is a solid reminder that Harry's not alone. He focuses on that, on the warmth of Malfoy's skin and the sound of his breathing in the darkness. He's not alone. Malfoy is here with him. The anxiety fades slightly and he continues on.
is in charge now.
He paused, as if struck by sudden inspiration, looking at Geraldine. 'Perhaps you and Mr Shafiq might be interested, given your recent success,' he said with a wide smile, gesturing to her husband, who was still speaking to the Ministry official.
'I'm going to lick you, Harry,' Ladon said, voice gravelly and low. 'If you feel like you're going to come, I need you to say "yellow". I will be very disappointed if you come before I say you can.'
'You didn't,' he whispers.
He eyes the remaining three, alert for any sort of threat and ready to pull Draco out if one of them so much as moves for his wand. But they're still, content to wait for further orders before acting. That fact puts Harry slightly at ease. Clearly the occupants of the party have heard of them, but perhaps their cover hasn't been blown.
Draco's mind raced. What could he tell Scorpius? The boy liked Harry. A lot. It would hurt him to know he wouldn't see Harry anymore. Draco couldn't face that conversation now.
Harry sat back in his chair with a huff of frustration. 'I've already reported it to Magical Maintenance. Twice. And by the sounds of it, so has every other level. What the bloody hell are they doing about it? It's literally their job to maintain magical things.'
'Was he at your team party last night?' he demanded, feeling his magic crackle up inside him, rushing to defend against what he was feeling.
He called his clothes down to himself and dressed quickly, Apparating to the point nearest the Ministry without bothering to shower or eat. He needed to report his suspicions. They would have to examine every piece of evidence again.
He pulls out his wand, casting the spell that will light Malfoy's location up for him. It fails. Nothing happens. Malfoy looks at him, eyes flinty.
He looked around wildly, thrashing arms and legs. He looked down to see they were flippered and then he was possessed by an urge to move - to swim. It was as though he was pulled by an invisible force - made to act out what was to come. Harry tried to fight against it, but then he was in front of the pillars. He could see the bodies hanging in the water, lifeless.
'Not even to get a drink?' Harry queried, desperate for the connection they'd had to continue beyond this moment - this room. 'Just as friends?'
Draco leaned forward, bracing one hand beside Harry's hip and leaning back, pushing his arse into Harry's face. Harry moaned loudly and his effort renewed. It was as his tongue breached Draco's hole that Draco took Harry's cock in his fist, leaning forward to swallow him down.
'The man I have worked with to solve this case over the past six weeks has been forced to hide his identity,' Harry says and he sees Ron, Robards, and Kingsley all turn their attention to Draco. He moves slightly so that he's in front of Draco, just enough to make it clear whose side he's on.
Draco closed his eyes for a second, trying to calm his racing heart, then he opened them again and nodded. A second later, the portals in the glass changed until they were translucent, and the questing tips of three tentacles slid out. The squid flattened itself against the glass and Draco shivered as a suctioned appendage moved towards him, as though scenting the air for him.
He could picture the names - had run his fingertips over them a million times, in the same way as Ladon was now.
'What do you need?' he asked instead.
, peering out from under his arm and wincing when he saw it was ten am.
Harry had been initially aghast at the way the paper was inciting anti-Muggle feelings, but he was hopeful that people would know better than to be taken in by such hype. Surely their own personal experience would trump the scaremongering the paper was putting out.
, his wolf rumbles and Harry doesn't disagree. He can't. Draco is his.
Then the squid moved its tentacles across his body again, bright colours flashing as it manipulated him until he was standing on the ground, facing away from it. The tentacle around his neck and in his mouth shifted until it was supporting the weight of his chest as well. Then another wrapped around his torso, trapping his arms at his sides. He grunted against the pressure constricting him, eyes meeting Harry's.
He flicked his gaze from a picture of a large, wooden X frame with leather straps dangling from the ends, to the words
'Right. Right, of course.' The sting of rejection cut deeply into him and he reached for his shirt, tugging it quickly and roughly over his head. It was time to leave. He had to leave now. He felt flayed open, raw. Ladon didn't want him - hadn't wanted him? Everything had seemed so real - their connection had seemed so real, but now Ladon was turning him away?
'Right,' Harry said, casting a nonverbal Protego over himself. He watched for a moment as Draco and each of his Aurors did the same, then they set off, jogging forward.
He leaned forward, wanting another kiss at least, but Ladon stopped him with a
Harry's blush deepened in embarrassment. 'Sorry,' he said.
Aoife leaned back in her chair, tapping on the table as though she didn't have the time to be filling him in on all of this. 'Yes,  they get stuck. They have to possess a human body to
But when he opens the door, Bill is standing there, and Harry realises he must have still been up and had heard the crack of his arrival.
Harry gritted his teeth but forced himself to speak calmly. There was something about this place, about the unruffled confidence of the man in front of him, that made him feel off balance, like he only had half of the information he needed to make decisions.
The way he'd looked had made Draco want to march over to him and drag him home - to berate him and care for him and make him see how desperately he needed to care for himself, instead of pulling himself to pieces trying to be the hero again.
'You wish, Potter,' Draco said, as he kicked up and flew gracefully into the air to hang far above them.
Harry's dad stepped forward, strong arms wrapping around him and bringing him close for a hug. Harry hugged him back, despite feeling he was getting a touch old for this. Then his dad clapped him on the back.
Baggins was sitting at his desk with a stack of boxes beside him on the floor, and another teetering over him. He looked like one wrong move would have him buried. Harry cleared his throat from the doorway and Baggins started, looking up with a squint as he adjusted his glasses. His eyebrows pulled in disapprovingly as he saw Harry and Hermione standing in the doorway of his cluttered workshop.
Malfoy looks at him for a moment and then turns on the spot. Nothing happens and Harry curses. Fucking Fae bastards. Can nothing be easy?
'Scared, Potter?' Malfoy's words, and the mockery in them, derailed Harry's thoughts, bringing him up short.
Harry's standing there in his pants and a tight top that doesn't do anything to hide his body, alone with Malfoy. He turns away from the mirror and reaches for his jeans, pulling them back on. Malfoy looks at him for a second longer, not saying anything until he too pushes the curtain aside, leaving the small fitting room.
Below him, his mate has stilled and his words are coming again. Quicker now, though still making no sense.
Harry had felt his anger stirring. Why couldn't Malfoy just say bloody thank you and for once not turn something into a fight? He'd decided then and there that Malfoy would always be a bastard and that he wanted nothing more to do with him.
Draco gave him Charlie's crooked smile and a gentle push in the back, urging him out the door and into the field beyond.
'I don't drink on the job,' I say automatically.
'It is—it was,' he managed, cursing himself as he stumbled over his words. 'That is, I haven't used it in—I packed it during the move and forgot it was there. Can you just—'
Harry smiled, a shy smile that was somehow challenging as well. 'Do you want me to?'
It will take me a few months to pull the next chunk together, so any comments in the meantime will sustain me <3
I hate working on Christmas Day. The johns always want one of two things. To use me hard and make themselves feel superior. To pretend for one day that they're not sad, pathetic and alone. Or to play house with me and make themselves feel loved, as though they can convince themselves they're not sad, pathetic and alone.
Malfoy's face hardened, and a look like anger flashed across it before it was gone. He held up a hand. 'I did not force you into anything that happened in that dream. I merely planted the seeds - the players and the stage. Your subconscious let the rest unfold the way it wished.'
Harry frowned. Unmarked? Something wasn't right about that. Something important.
Malfoy's hand touches his back and it's cool, offering a beautiful relief against the fever that seems to be running through him.
did. What happened was a tragedy … but it's been three years, Draco. At some point you need to open yourself up again ...'
Felix surged within Harry and suddenly he knew what he needed to do as clearly as though it had been shouted to him. He drew his wand and sent a Stupefy at the man, then a cushioning charm as he fell to the ground.
'Why did you?'
He shoves one of the sleeves of his jacket up his arm slightly and flicks the clasp open, wrapping the chain around his wrist. Malfoy steps closer, reaching out to clip it closed, before pulling out his wand, face inscrutable.
Harry took a deep drag and blew the smoke out.
Harry snorted to himself. Of course they hadn't. Malfoy might be a bastard, but he wasn't an idiot. He never had been.
Malfoy's touch is gentle and repetitive, and Harry feels it soothing something much deeper inside himself than the fever has reached. Malfoy's touch makes him feel safe, he thinks, as his eyes slip closed. He doesn't know how long it's been since someone else could make him feel safe.
Draco leaned in close, murmuring in Harry's ear. 'I'm pretty sure I can convince the Head Auror to let me off with a warning,' he said, voice low as his lip grazed Harry's ear. Harry huffed out a breath, heat suddenly curling through him. He felt his magic rush through him, surging to the surface as though it wanted to join with Draco's and make them both feel good. He wrestled it back down.
'You don't get to decide shit for me,' he spat. 'I thought we made that fucking clear a long time ago.'
He flipped through the rest of the file. According to the supervision he'd been under for the first few years after his release from Azkaban, Malfoy had no friends remaining in England. Zabini had moved to America, Goyle to Australia and Nott to Germany. The only one who had remained in London was Parkinson, though a file note from a few years before said they hadn't been seen together in several months.
She nods. 'He won't be back until late. They have a few big cases on at the moment.' She doesn't say any more and Harry doesn't ask. That's an unspoken agreement between the three of them. Ron had tried to keep him abreast of the doings of the DMLE after he left, but Harry had wavered between a longing to be back in the action, rage at how he had left, and frustration at the way things were being handled in his absence. They'd all agreed it was better to avoid the topic.
'Scorp likes him?'
His job - his real job - was a farce, just like so many things in his life.
And so it goes on. Harry watches the room more than he watches the items. Each of them smell of sadness, loss, pain and greed. He can see, as the night goes on, that the bidding, the cut and play of winners and losers is putting all of the men on edge. Each of them is powerful in their own right and losing things they desire to each other is working their emotions slowly higher.
,' Malfoy whispered in the darkness.
'Fuck,' Harry breathes as that fact hits him, overwhelming him. Draco has completely removed his own role—his own centrality—in favour of giving Harry the thing he's missing most. Harry feels another jolt of understanding, as he realises that in some ways, this is what it's always like for Draco, living his life in the shadows, never known, never taking credit for what he's done. He thinks, not for the first time, about what a lonely, cold life that must be, and he wants to run back downstairs and pull Draco to himself, tell him he's not alone.
Then Malfoy flicks his wand and Harry feels wards go up around them, prickling against his skin. Malfoy gestures again and his glamour disappears. Harry clenches his teeth to contain the surge of emotion that seeing Malfoy's face creates in him. The anger rushes back to the forefront, hot and vicious and Harry wants to slam Malfoy into a wall and demand to know what
Draco rolled his eyes, not at Harry, seemingly at the whole situation. 'It's a contract my father put in place, to control my access to my inheritance and to the family name. I didn't care much before Scorpius was born … but after that - I won't be the reason he has to go without.'
He checked again when he got to the house. This time he could feel other spells, older spells, layered beneath the crime scene ones. He considered them, watching them move slowly across the surface of the entrance, undulating sluggishly. His diagnostics came back free of threat. The spells knew he was there but didn't plan to harm him.
He opened his mouth, though he had no idea what he was going to say, but Malfoy held up a hand to stop him.
He hears a faint rustle as Malfoy moves slightly, then the warmth of his skin disappears, but the smell of his arousal rises in the air again. Harry lowers his head, unable to help himself as he realises Malfoy has just tilted his head and bared his neck to Harry.
'You will never harm Draco or Scorpius again. You will never
'Oh pet, trust me. You know,' she looked him up and down again. 'Somehow I feel that none of the rest of us are going to get a play though.' She looked put out at the thought and glanced back at the door Ladon had disappeared through.
Harry groaned and arched into Draco's touch. Draco's mouth moved to Harry's neck and he bit lightly. Harry tilted his head to one side to give him better access and Draco nosed at the skin there, nudging aside the thin strip of leather Harry wore constantly. The one he'd found in Draco's bedside drawer when he was looking for lube. The one he'd thrown at Draco's feet all those months ago.
He turns away, stepping out of the booth. 'I'll be there tomorrow night,' he says. 'Don't try and contact me before then.'
A few weeks later, Draco had walked out on him.
Then he looked back over at Malfoy, who seemed to have recovered from Harry's abrupt awakening and was now watching him closely, leaning back in his chair, dressed in smart, deep blue robes.
'Goodnight Harry,' she said, smiling gently.
It had bothered him to start with, Draco's secrecy, the fact that he kept hiding, kept disappearing, even though his name was cleared now and he was free to return to society as himself. Draco had explained it simply, when Harry had asked him. He lives for the work he does as Veritas, the same way Harry does as an Auror. After that it was easy. Harry makes sure that when Draco comes home to him, he makes every second count.
'Hi,' Harry replies, and his voice is croaky. He remembers screaming, roaring, howling. He grimaces and his skin feels tight. He looks down and realises he's naked and blood is splashed all over him. Half-healed wounds litter his body, red and angry against his skin.
Draco takes one last look at the three men facing him and then he reaches slowly into his waistcoat and withdraws his wand. He holds it lightly, but it's clear he's ready to use it. Robards tenses at the gesture, but Harry sees Ron step up beside him. The look he gives Harry is a mixture of trepidation and resignation.
'Hi,' Draco says softly, and that one word holds a whole host of things unsaid.
'I truly am sorry for the loss of your colleague,' Draco says. 'My apologies for the mess.'
She looked over at Harry, concern on her face. 'Are you sure you won't come?'
In a second his ankles were bound by smooth black cords, his legs wide and fastened to the bed posts. He cast a second rope at his knees, looping under the bed. Then he pulled against the ties, trying to close his legs, and groaned at the feeling of restriction, of being fully on display, and of wanting it.
It's another few hours before Banks turns in and forces Harry to as well. Gordyn turns up, with a report that they've recovered two more of the children. He's another of the team Harry used to run, and Harry makes himself let go. He knows he can trust Gordyn to keep things moving.
Draco cringed, waiting for Blaise's condemnation of his actions.
'Fun?' Malfoy's voice was full of derision. 'Seven against one is fun, is it? Racial slurs are fun, are they? Your mother,' Malfoy pointed at one of the boys, who looked to be close to Teddy's age, 'Was one of the strongest advocates of the new Werewolf Rights Act. How do you think she will feel when I tell her about your attack on the son of one of the war's heroes?'
'I'm fine,' Harry said, pulling his arm away. He felt absurdly grateful Ron let him. He moved into his bedroom and slipped into the first clothes he found, turning back to face Ron and forcing a smile onto his face.
Hermione looked to be holding back a laugh as she asked, 'Will you be okay getting home? You sure you don't want me to side-along you?'
'Nonsense, Harry,' she said as she held him. 'I know you're busy with work. Arthur was much the same at your age - making a living for the family and everything.'
Malfoy sniffed, and made to get up. 'I'll leave you to it -' he began.
The President paused and his face was grim.
Harry made his notes on the new case and then linked the two together, sending them floating back up onto the wall.
'Of course,' Davies says. 'I'll set up a time. And after?'
'Yes. Yep—ah. Just fine. Sorry to leave like that. How did everything go? Is Oliver okay?' Harry asks, both wanting to change the subject and genuinely needing to know what had happened.
he do that again? Send that hate spreading forth in the form of death?
Aoife frowned. 'That's the hard part. We
'Right,' he said, moving towards Hermione to give her a kiss on the cheek and a quick hug, then Ron for a pat on the shoulder. Ron's eyes met his and Harry could see faint worry in them. He realised with a twinge of guilt that he hadn't seen Ron in weeks … since he'd had his moment at the Burrow … and that Ron had probably been worrying about him. He mustered up a smile, as sincere as he could make it, and after a moment, Ron smiled back.
'The destination is Rothwell Estate,' Ron's voice says, issuing from the terrier in front of them. 'Apparition point is just outside the front gates. I'm bringing all Aurors into previously agreed covert positions. Signal remains as discussed. Ensure you have your coin with you.'
Draco swallowed heavily, desire blooming across his face. 'Are you sure?'
Malfoy had decided not to cut him off, but he didn’t want to give him any reason to change his mind.
'Of course,' Lucius said, eyes not leaving Draco. 'Time passes so differently here. I forget.'
The thought was overtaken by his overwhelming need to know where Draco was.
'Yes, Chief Warlock,' Harry said again, unable to voice any of the thoughts racing through his mind.
'So will you help me?' Harry wheedled, trying to put on his best helpless maiden voice, aware that there was mockery laced all through it. 'Please, Draco, there's simply no way I'll pass without your mighty potions mind.'
Conor reached out to put a hand on her shoulder and she jumped and whirled around, looking up with wide, startled eyes.
'He's always been a hot-head,' Blaise said dismissively. 'You used to brag about how easy it was to rile him up.'
Harry rubbed his fingers over the fabric of his cloak again, wondering. His dreams had changed when he started wearing it. The hooded figures had disappeared. His nightmares were ordinary again. Was he hiding from Death, in this cloak, or had his imagination just conjured the entire thing? Was it all just happening inside his mind as some twisted way to make sense of James' death?
'Right-o, right-o,' Dean said, a laugh in his voice. 'Break it up, you two.'
. The thought hit him with a certainty he couldn't shake. He looked back down over the crowd, despair rising in him as he saw someone fall, engulfed by flames. She rolled, screaming and smacking at her clothes, but within moments the flames overcame her and she stilled and fell quiet. Then he saw it happen again, and again, and realised the Preservation members below were targeting people with the fire now. These people were dying because of him. It wasn't from his wand, this time, but it was no less his fault.
After a few moments he hears movement inside, feet hitting the floor and the rustle of clothes, and then the door handle twists and Draco is standing in front of him, Markwell's face and a perfectly pressed suit in place.
is the one in control for one more day.
'Right,' Harry said, looking back at all of the images. 'So I track them, try and see if I'm drawn to any of them, and then what, if I can't kill them?' He saw Eliška's face again.
Harry caught his breath, threads pulling closer together in his mind, his thoughts on the roof swirling back into life. Malfoy had always had close control of his expressions, but these last few days, it almost seemed like there was something inside him, struggling to get out, smothered every time it tried to surface. He felt a sense of creeping dread begin to move through him. Movement interrupted Harry's thoughts and he forced himself to focus.
This time the look that met his was positively devilish, as Ladon grinned broadly. 'Oh, Harry. I get everything out of it.'
It's a faint sound, a rhythmic splashing. Harry listens to it for a long moment before he realises what he's hearing and he freezes. It's Malfoy, in the shower. Wanking. He's listening to Malfoy wanking.
'What did you get from your attacker's memories?'
'Yes, absolutely fascinating,' Harry says. 'This is perfect, thanks. We'll definitely check it out.' He reaches out and sweeps all of the brochures into a pile, gives David a big smile before he turns to Malfoy.
'However, Mr. Potter,' Ladon said smoothly, his eyes taking on a spark of heat as he glanced up and down Harry's body. 'I have not forgotten that you were called here last night. It would be my pleasure to show you what our Club can offer.'
it gives me to live inside a host who is so opposed to everything I want to achieve, yet who submits to me to save others.'
At the sound of his entrance she looked up
'Ready?' Draco asks, offering him an arm and breaking Harry out of his thoughts.
'I'm fine,' Harry said again, realising as thoughts and fears churned inside him, how far from fine he really was. He could feel his heart begin to beat faster again. Having Ron and Hermione right in front of him, looking at him like he'd somehow let them down, wasn't helping in the slightest. He reached for his smokes and lit one, sucking back on it and trying to let the nicotine calm him slightly. It didn't work. But it gave him something to do with his hands, something to do aside from feel guilty over the hurt radiating from his two best friends.
Harry let out a deep breath. 'Okay, so what does 'unlinking' me look like?' he asked, eyeing the three of them.
Harry let himself be led forward as his mind raced, trying to make sense of what he was seeing, what Malfoy was saying - why he was suddenly so gentle where before he had been hard and cold.
It was half past six when the last review from this week's batch was complete. Harry looked at the clock and contemplated the thought of buying and cooking the rosemary and red wine shanks Ginny loved so much. It would take him an extra half hour to detour via the shops and at least an hour of time in the kitchen. He stretched, trying to relieve the tension in his shoulders, and winced at the sensation. Then he picked up a few of the case files from the week before and made his way downstairs to the Ministry floos. Perhaps he could get take away from the Indian Place that did floo deliveries. Ginny liked their Rogan Josh as well. They could have dinner together and sit down to some telly. Ginny had been enjoying watching it since they'd gotten it twelve months earlier.
'Yes,' he said instead.
'I also … died,' he said, glancing at Malfoy to see how he would take the news. Malfoy sucked in a breath and his eyes jerked to Harry's, shock in them morphing into understanding, as though he'd just had long-held thoughts confirmed.
He took a step forward, clenched fist rising, but was stopped by a hand on his arm and an urgent voice in his ear.
'Hmm?' Draco said, already picking up the next pile of letters and scanning through them.
'No. I - thank you - but I'm married. And - I should be going.' He gave the man a small smile, noting the way his mouth pulled up in a rueful smile in return as he ran his fingers through his white-blond hair.
'We hurt each other, Harry,' Draco said, his face reflecting that pain. 'We always have.'
Harry feels his mind racing as he tries to figure out what Malfoy means. Does he know Harry is into him? Has he known all this time and been waiting for Harry to wake up and realise it too.
He started with the ones he knew would be approved and which Javier could just have signed off if he wasn't a monumental prat, determined at every point to undermine Harry's ability to do his job.
Draco shivered slightly as Harry's magic flowed over him, his breathing coming faster as he stared at Harry. He didn't move or speak and Harry was afraid that he'd gone too far - had finally told Draco the thing that would drive him away.
Malfoy hesitated, before he nodded. 'It's easier that way. I don't have to be on my guard as much and people don't have to deal with knowing I work in the same place my father once tried to destroy.'
''kay,' Harry mumbles, the idea of lying down the best thing that's ever come out of Malfoy's mouth.
The terrier pauses and cocks his head. 'Good luck, Harry,' he says, then he fades away.
Draco pulled off, sitting up and looking back over his shoulder at Harry with a grin that he knew was just on the edge of the schoolboy sneer he used to wear.
'Hunter,' Malfoy says. 'That's enough.' His tone is sharp and it contains just a hint of the desperation that his voice in Harry's mind had held. It's so subtle that Harry doesn't think Davies would register it.
'At least let me wrap it,' Malfoy says as Harry stands beside the Land Rover, steeling himself to climb into it.
'I - I have to go,' Harry said, taking a step back and giving Ron a pleading look, hoping he would understand. He couldn't do this. He twisted on the spot, Apparating with a crack.
He'd invited Malfoy onto the case. All of the leads they were exploring - including Draco's father - were because Draco had pointed to them and Harry had trusted him, like a fucking fool. He cursed himself again, his anger flickering back to life at the thought that he may have jeopardised the entire case with his trust.
Harry's blood was still pumping as he stalked down Central Park West, his cloak wrapped tightly around him. He thought briefly about Apparating closer to the Plaza, but he had about an hour until Malfoy would be meeting with General Andrews, and he could feel the adrenaline from his confrontation with Rick still pumping through him. He tapped out a smoke and sucked back on it deeply, breathing it out as he walked.
'The top is where the power is. It always has been. If you want to change things, you change them at the top. Speaking of which, Potter,' Draco said, leaning forward, an idea striking him with an intensity that took his breath away. '
'I don't think - well, he seems pretty pissed, Harry,' Ron began, but Harry cut him off.
'How … did you respond?' Ladon asked, his calm tone sounding slightly forced.
. He still didn't know if he believed it. The whole thing was so mad. But so much of what he had just heard brought the threads of his research over the last year together in a way that had a frightening ring of truth to it.
Mac and Blake both approached him as he entered, but Harry merely shook his head. He'd fucked it up. He knew it. He didn't need to unpack for them how. The only thing he stopped to ask was whether Scorpius had got away safely. At Mac's nod, he went to the kitchens, found himself a bottle of vodka and retreated to his room.
When their lips touch, it's soft and slow and Draco's mouth is warm. Harry breathes in the smell of his skin, almost unconsciously. He feels the wolf press forward within him, rumbling in pleasure.
. He'd cleaned it himself, not even wanting the House Elves to touch it. He'd had Harry sit, once, and had stood behind him, placing his fingers on the keys as he showed him how to play a simple melody, something short and happy. He'd placed kisses on Harry's neck in between each of his attempts, but the moment Harry had tried to turn it into anything more serious, he'd moved them both away from the instrument with chiding words.
'You won't hurt me, Harry,' Malfoy says, looking over his shoulder with a sharp-edged smile.
Ladon could give him things Draco never could, he knew that. But Draco … on the  balance of it, Draco could give him so much more. He'd seen Draco watching him, knew that the friendship they were developing had solid foundations. He allowed himself to hope that Draco wanted something more with him as well. Ladon could give him release. Harry thought that just maybe, Draco could give him a life.
