Draco's cheeks had pinked and he looked rather elsewhere than at Harry. He seemed shaken up by his own doing and swiftly pulled on his other glove. Harry bit his lip. He felt partly embarrassed but another part of him had deeply enjoyed Draco's attention. He smeared the tincture on his blisters and put his dragonhide gloves on.
Suddenly the pillow flew by him and he came face to face with fierce green eyes. "No, fuck! Nothing is alright." Harry spat, letting Ron recoil, and then all fight was gone from his body. He covered his face in his hands and Ron noticed that the tips of his ears began to show a deep red blush.
Hermione rounded the table and sat beside him after apologizing to Mrs. Pince, the librarian, who sent a warning glare their way. They cuddled together and Hermione updated Ron what had happened while he was sulking.
Draco laughed and answered with descending his lips to Harry's. Slowly he moved Harry backward toward the bed that was laid out in the middle of the room, not breaking their lips apart.
Harry's challenging green eyes remained fixed on Zabini. "I will never hurt him again. I love him and will do everything in my power to make him happy."
Sitting down in a chair near the window, Harry looked around in the Three Broomsticks. He noticed that Madam Rosmertay glared at Malfoy‘s back before she gave Harry a half-smile. He made out Dean and Seamus who sat behind the stairs who led upstairs, talking eagerly to each other while their heads were bowed over a magazine. A few third years awed over the taste of butterbeer and all in all it was a cozy atmosphere in the taproom.
Draco and Harry had neither eyes nor ears for their fellow classmates. The two were completely lost in one another and looked deep into the other's eyes before they gave each other a passionate kiss in front of all the assembled residents of Hogwarts.
The breakup with Harry had brought old, hurtful memories back to life and he cried bitterly into his pillow trying not to wake Blaise, who was sleeping in the bed next to his.
Before Harry could even open his mouth, McGonagall spoke again, "Does your behaviour have anything to do with Mr. Malfoy? I noticed you were getting along and now you're not."
"Merlin, woman! Would you stop bringing me out of the concept? It's dangerous," he shouted and drew Professor Sprout's attention to them. "Be careful!" she exclaimed and pointed her wand at one of the baubles which had come loose of one of the corolla leaves. "Glacius," she shouted, and the small ball of fire froze in mid-air before it splintered into a thousand ice crystals on the ground.
He was pleasantly surprised that he found in Hermione of all people someone who could proceed and share his fascination with ancient runes. They got on like a house on fire, given that she was as well educated in other subjects like him.
Harry was going crazy. It was now almost a month since Draco had heard that sodding conversation and Harry still hadn't found a way to apologize in earnest. All attempts had been nipped in the bud, either from Draco himself or from one of his friends. Pansy was particularly rigorous in cursing him. When she was around Harry couldn't even look at Draco without risking a hex.
Harry nodded and shrugged at the same time, what else could he have done? The fall-out with Draco weighed heavily on him. He doubted the Headmistress would show sympathy for a heartbroken student if he was risking his health and schooling over it.
His tongue flicked against the puckered rim. Draco let out a surprised squeal and tried to flee up the bed but Harry wouldn't let him. He clenched his fingers around Draco's pointy hip bones and began to lick in earnest.
"Well that concludes the torture for the day. I'm leaving," and with that, Draco walked swiftly out the door without a second glance at the Gryffindors.
Draco rubbed the back of his neck awkwardly as he agreed, watching for a moment as Harry walked towards the exit before catching up.
When they reached the outskirts of Hogwarts Harry let go of Draco's hand unwillingly and they both felt a little disappointed.
Draco tried to ignore the way his arm felt on fire where Harry leaned into him, their fingers brushing on the railing.
"You alright there?" Ron said, breaking Harry out of his thoughts, "You're kinda red. You didn't make yourself sick practicing last night did you? It was kinda cold out."
"I wish I'd seen her face when she saw there were no cushions," Draco giggled, arms gripping at his stomach and he bent over with laughter.
"Think Gryffindor will win?" Hermione asked, looking around at the Quidditch players who were littered around the long table.
"I'm really glad you invited me on a date today, I've had a really good time," Neville said, giving Blaise's hand a squeeze and smiling up at him.
"Are the rumors true?" Blaise asked, coming up from behind Pansy, "Did Potter really-" his eyes traveled down to Draco's chest that was currently covered with layers of bandages below his clothes, "cut you all open?"
Harry glanced away as Draco managed to pull on his shirt and he felt his cheeks heat up. He had to stop looking at Draco if they had any chance of winning the match, he needed to focus.
Draco ached all over with need as Harry continued to press kisses on his stomach and just above the waistband, he was teasing him and Draco knew it. A strangled groan escaped his lips as Harry pressed his lips to Draco's erection over his underwear, and his hips jerked up unconsciously.
"You did though, all shocked and surprised. I don't get to see you show emotion very often," Harry got closer then, his mouth near Draco's ear and Draco was turning red.
Draco shut his book with a thud and glared at Pansy who smirked when she noticed the growing redness of his cheeks.
Harry and Draco looked at each other for a moment and a sudden urge to kiss Draco passed through him. He was just about to lean over the table when he heard someone clear their throat.
"Well, I just picked who I thought would be the best for the team," Harry shrugged, sitting on the edge of his bed, looking over at Draco.
"Wait! Where are we going?!" Harry tried to shout over the music as Draco drags him down the hall. Harry knew, whatever happened, he had to get away. Who knew what Draco was planning? I mean, Draco had always hated Harry and he could easily do what he wanted right now, he'd come and distracted him with sweet words that made his heart pound in a weird way. Harry was utterly defenseless, wishing he hadn't forgotten his wand in his room. Before he could think about how to retrieve his arm from Draco's hand, and then an escape plan, Draco pulled Harry into an entrance to a secret passage. Before Harry could recover Draco pushed Harry to the wall.
"You totally like him," Ginny snickered and Harry groaned because maybe he did like him. Just a little.
Ginny simply smiled and hugged Harry, "Thanks, I care for you too, as a brother of course. And I guess since we're sharing shocking news," Ginny paused for a second to take a breath, "I'm dating Luna right now."
"No!" Pansy responded with a skeptical look. "Look, if you can't be quiet and let me read, I'm going to the library."
I've got to say, this and chapter 24 were my favorite chapters in the story to write so far, so enjoy!
"Yeah, well I'm not envious of your situation either," Ron laughed, "At least I got a girlfriend out of it."
"You're just what? Watching him? All-day long? Following him around? What do you want to call it, take your pick."
"What on earth do you think you're doing?" Snape hissed when the classroom door closed behind the last student. "First I hear you lost it on your housemates when they called Granger a mudblood, then you dye your hair blue, and then I hear you're associating with Hagrid and Granger."
Hermione gave him a contemplative look before seeming to give up with a sigh, "Well you could still take someone you know, just don't do whatever Ron is suggesting."
Draco figured it was a muggle thing as the gesture made no sense, but it flooded him with a sense of happiness at how happy Harry looked.
"You are!" Harry said, suddenly seeming to get defensive and made Draco jump. "You are, you really are, don't tell yourself otherwise."
"We know how to get into the kitchens, so food wouldn't be a problem," Ron said, "We'll probably need help carrying it all though."
His long legs make his strides towards the table quick, and he makes it there quicker than he thought he would, but he doesn't stop there. Taking the front of Harry's robes into his fists, he pulls him forward into what can only be described as the best kiss in his entire life.
"Yeah, we should probably go to bed too," Ron said, standing up and heading towards the stairs, Harry and Hermione following behind.
"Yeah, but I was the one who broke up with you in the first place, I should have been the one to say something."
“No way, you seriously figured it out?” Ron laughed a bit, suddenly interested, “Oh this is gold, you gotta tell us who it is!” Hermione shot him a look but he either didn’t see it or ignored it and kept his eyes trained on Harry.
"Today we'll be trying the potion," Snape said as everyone fished their books out of their bags, "But first you'll need to add two more ingredients to dilute it, stirring for ten minutes clockwise before putting in the ingredients," Snape scribbled down the ingredients and directions onto the blackboard as he spoke.
He was quickly surrounded by house elves and he was suddenly saddened by the thought he'd never see Dobby here again. He quickly spotted a house elf he knew though and made his way over to her.
When he finally made it to the great hall for lunch, Ron was as red as his hair and arguing about something with Hermione.
"I'll try and sneak away from Ron and Hermione on the train to see you if you'd like," Harry said and he rounded up the last of his things to take down to the Hogwarts Express.
Pansy came when they were cleaning up breakfast. “Are you both decent?” Pansy called from the living room.
As you guessed, it's much quieter here than at the Weasley's. The holiday's are a much quieter affair here.
When they came back down, Harry looked up to find Ron redder than his hair from embarrassment and decked in a tight shirt. If the shirt was tight on Hermione it was constricting on Ron and he felt extremely exposed.
Draco sucked in a breath at the sudden proximity. He could feel Harry's breath ghosting over his lips, and his wrists were still being held by Harry. "I would," he said, just above a whisper. Harry was silent for a moment and Draco couldn't help noticing the way Harry's eyebrows furrowed just slightly as he contemplated his next words.
Twenty minutes later, Harry and Draco made their way to the Great Hall for breakfast, only separating when they had to go to their own tables. Harry watched from the Gryffindor table as Draco pushed his eggs around his plate sleepily.
Draco panted as he slowly rolled off Harry. He felt limp as he laid next to Harry for a moment before curling up to his side and pressing light kisses to Harry's cheek.
Draco wandered through the aisles for a minute until he found a black and silver pheasant-feather quill. He bought it quickly and they headed out towards The Three Broomsticks.
Draco's head was pounding and the light from the window was assaulting his eyes. When he tried to sit up his stomach turned and he felt nauseous. He laid back down and then felt the bed shift.
Neville thought about it for a moment and then an idea popped into his head. "When did you start liking Ron?"
Draco held his breath as he reached for Harry's hand, waiting for his reaction. Harry simply smiled at him though, grabbing Draco's hand back and not letting go until they got back to the castle and Harry let go to open the door for Draco.
"Oh don't act like you wouldn't be too if it weren't for the fact that your interested about why Harry was so late," Hermione replied, rolling her eyes.
"Fine, then what do you suggest we do?" Draco said, putting his book down on the bed. Harry blanched, he didn't think he'd get this far, and accordingly, didn't have a single idea what they should do.
"Mmmhmm," Harry said with a smirk, "Want to go down to the common room? I think everyone is at Hogsmeade and we can sit by the fire."
"That's the glory of masks though, isn't it? No one can tell it's us, we could be anyone right now,"
"Alright, alright," Harry laughed, then turned to Ron and Hermione, "And you're really okay with this? I thought you'd be a bit more shocked..."
"It's alright, we know that this potion is going to take longer than one moon cycle at least. You can add that to the short list of things we know," Harry said with a sigh and Hermione gave him a knowing look.
The kiss lasted no more than a couple seconds and it was more like a friendly peck than anything else. Hermione picked the bottle up next and looked awkwardly over at Ginny before giving her a kiss just a quick as Seamus and her had done.
"We should hurry to the Great Hall and try and beat some of the rush getting in the doors," Hermione suggested to everyone as they made their way down the stands. Many students were still mulling around the stands and if they hurried, they could make it into the Dinning hall before they got trapped in a big crowd.
Harry moved back to his bed where his homework had been left forgotten. He picked up his potions book, looking it over. He still couldn't believe he was back here sometimes, it was so weird to come back and have a normal school year after so much had happened the year before. He couldn't complain though, it had given him a second chance at a lot of things and had also allowed him to be friends with Draco.
Harry pulled Draco's face back up to kiss him as Draco finally pulled Harry's pants off his hips. Draco pulled back to drop down to his knees.
"Hey, didn't realize you were in here too. You should've come sit with me, or called me over," Draco said with a smile and Harry could practically hear his heartbeat. He wondered if it was as audible to Draco as it was to him.
"Great idea, Pansy," Hermione said, "I'll explain how you play it for everyone. One person spins a bottle and the person it lands on has to do a truth or dare - they get to choose which - and the person who spun gives them their truth or dare. If the person doesn't want to answer or do the dare, they have to take a shot of firewhisky," Hermione shot a look at Seamus who looked too smug for her taste, "Everyone understand?" Everyone nodded in the affirmative.
How has your break been? It's always a bit crazy at Ron's house, it's a lot of fun though. Ron, George, Percy, and Ginny all still live here of course, but Charlie and Bill will be coming tomorrow. Fleur, Bill's wife, is coming as well so the house is going to be packed. I suppose it's a lot less hectic at your house. Hermione will be coming for New Years too, so pretty soon there'll be 11 people here. You're probably rolling your eyes right about now, but it really is nice. I wish you could be here as well, I do miss you.
"Even if it hurts me a bit to let you go, I'll give you a piece of honest advice," she said next to his ear, "go and get your man back and be damn well happy with him. You deserve to be happy." She slapped him encouragingly on the back, before pulling away from him. Harry looked at her with wide green eyes, "Thanks, Ginny," he said and a hesitant smile began to play around the corners of his mouth.
"So he's ... what's that called again?" Ron asked, relatively fascinated by the subject. Since Harry had let out that he might have feelings or something for Malfoy, Ron had been thinking more and more about the subject.
Blaise got up too. "Make that a date. I also want to know how the Golden Boy snatched up my best friend," he winked at Draco, making him blush yet again before the three eventually decided to go to their lessons.
Harry undid Draco's pants and ran his rough hands over the bony curve of Draco's hip. He stroked under the elastic of the Slytherin's boxer shorts and pulled them down over his legs together with the trousers. His hands never left the pale, soft skin of his lover.
Harry’s head whipped around. "You get them, too?" he asked astonished and while his attention was diverted, Hermione snatched the scroll and placed it into Pansy’s waiting hands beneath the table.
“Merlin, give me strength,” the ginger muttered and set his piercing glare on his girlfriend who was currently working with Nott on the assignment Professor Sprout had given them.
"Oh, you need to go to Hermione to vanish it. I still haven’t got the remover spell down," Pansy said without looking up from her work on Blaise's hand.
They kissed fiercely, till they were both breathless and broke apart, still clutching at each other for dear life. The dark-haired boy whispered hoarsely, "I’ve missed you so much," and tightened the grip he had on Draco's waist pulling the blond even closer to him.
Harry looked slightly annoyed at Pansy at the stupid comment but then decided not to start an argument. He was tired of arguing, except when he bickered with Draco, which was a lot of fun. This was partly because the usual cutting edge was missing and partly because it was Draco. They didn't really seem to know any other communication than teasing each other.
"That was …Oh by Salazar‘s pink knickers! So HOT!" Pansy wheezed between loud barks of laughter, while Hermione had her red face buried in her hands and was giggling like mad.
Harry groaned as a beam of sunlight shone directly into his face through the window and woke him from his fitful slumber. It was his third weekend back at Hogwarts for his eight-year and he had hoped that he could have a lie-in but the damn sunrise seemed to have other plans for him, as much as the imposing owl that sat perched on the windowsill and knocked her beak urgently against the glass.
Meanwhile, Zabini grinned wildly at the red-faced Neville who had caught a stain of dirt on his nose when he ran his earth-smeared hands over his heated face.
Draco was a mess. Since his breakup with Harry, he had let himself go down the drain. His things were strewn everywhere and Blaise was getting on his nerves by complaining about it. He felt heartbroken for Salazar's sake, couldn't he be left alone. Sighing, he bent down to take his dirty clothes to the hamper, and then he decided to organize his things anew.
"Longbottom? Does he want to take over Herbology later on?” Draco asked, taking the tip of his tongue between his lips in concentration as he wrote out the last sentence of his essay.
When the girls had calmed down, Pansy folded the parchment neatly and gave it to Hermione. "Maybe, Potter wants to read it," she smirked with an amused glint in her eyes.
Harry audibly swallowed the bite of his ginger biscuit. His mouth felt as dry as if he had been skidding through the desert on his stomach with his mouth open. He quickly grabbed one of the steaming teacups in order not to have to answer immediately. Taking small sips of the hot brew, he wondered if and how he should explain his behaviour to the Headmistress. He didn't really want to talk about the breakup with Draco, but he saw no way around not having to bring it up.
Ron nodded and drew her in for a tight hug, before kissing her head, before they parted ways for the night and headed up to their own dorms.
Harry sighed, "I know, Ginny. We were together for almost two years. But I fucked up and now it's over and I just can't ... I can't do this, Gin. When I see him with Zabini, I just ... I want to hurt that slimy git so badly sometimes for laying his hands on Draco, I have the feeling I will go bonkers soon." Harry pressed the balls of his hands against his eyes, pushing up his glasses in the process.
"I ... uhm ... the thing is ... I...," Draco stuttered and broke off. Damn this was horrible, but he needed to get it out or he would explode with the tension of not knowing how they would react. He mentally berated himself to grow a pair and opened his mouth to look his imminent doom in the eye.
He swept through the room, threw himself into his new, fitting clothes, which he had ordered specially on Ron’s advice and, for once, needed forever in the bathroom to tame his hair with the newly learned spells from Hermione. And with a good portion of Sleekeazy's. When he eventually finished, Neville was groaning from the door that he would finally have to go to the bathroom if Harry didn't want to wipe up a puddle.
Harry nodded again. He just couldn't open his mouth because McGonagall's carefully chosen words had brought tears to his eyes and he had to look away from her.
Harry's chest contracted painfully at the thought and his hand clenched into a trembling fist around his fork.
Had he heard right? Getting verbally bashed by the Weasel was nothing new to him, but that Harry hadn't defended him, hell, even participated in it. Harry had said things about Draco that ripped his heart to shreds and anger flooded the hole it had left in his chest. It was simply too much for him to bear. He was numb inside and out. But against his conviction that it couldn't get worse, Harry continued to tear his heart apart when he admitted to having had a crush on Cedric Diggory.
"Just tell us who you like, mate. You're making half a Ministry secret out of it," Ron said, curiosity riding high on his face.
Draco let out a startled yelp but soon moved his lips to kiss back just as frantically as he registered the wild mop of hair and the intoxicating scent of one Harry Potter, his former arch-enemy and beloved ex-boyfriend.
Draco's heart sped up as Harry came to a stop before him, he seemed nervous but courageous. Harry held out his hand to Draco invitingly. Flabbergasted upon the bold approach Draco let himself be pulled up and quirked a questioning eyebrow at the Golden Boys' mischievous grin.
Tomorrow would be the big day and Harry felt pretty nervous but more so excited. He tossed and turned in his bed, going over everything in his head and praying to Merlin, Morgana, and Circe that Draco would react positively to his performance.
So he wanted to talk to Harry today and hoped that his boyfriend would agree to go public with their relationship. Even if that meant that people would say he had bewitched Harry, he didn't care. He wanted everyone to know of their love. He felt deep down that he could build a future with Harry, but for that to happen they needed to take the first step into the unknown together.
"Erm, Ron ... you see ... I wasn't sure myself at first, and then I didn't want to freak you out, you were my first real friend so ...," Harry stuttered and again scuffed his shoe against the floor. This wasn't going as well as he had hoped it would.
Draco closed the letter and put it back in the bottom of his trunk. He felt sad again, feeling as if the pressure from back then, was now back on his shoulders. He missed Harry so much. His unruly hair, his green eyes, his reassuring smile. Why had he taken Blaise's offer to be fake boyfriends? In the last few weeks, he had seen how hurt Harry was by this. More often than not he almost gave in to the temptation, but Blaise had held him back every time, saying, "If that is all Potter does to get you back, he's not worth it."
Harry checked himself in the mirror again. His wild hair was tamed into a deliberately tousled look; his glasses were sparkling clean and actually sat straight on his nose. He had freshly shaved and applied aftershave. His clothing consisted of a black silk shirt, the green vest that favorably accentuated his broad shoulders and slim waist. A black leather belt with a snake as a buckle was pulled through the belt loops of his black trousers and the whole thing was rounded off with new black sneakers.
"Really Darling? The way you've been following him with your eyes lately and literally undressing him with them,
"You'd like to know that, wouldn't you?" Draco asked, amused. "What’s with your ambiguity today? Are you really that inarticulate or is it my lucky day?"
Draco groaned, "I can’t even begin to describe how exhausted this whole ordeal is." He waved his hand dramatically to show that he meant everything around him. "I think you know that I get hate mail almost every day. Even McGonagall‘s warning didn’t do much about it. And if that wasn’t enough…" Draco paused and pressed his lips together. He almost gave away what he got at breakfast on Saturday, but luckily he was able to resist it at the last moment.
Draco's ice-cold stand towards everything that had happened, hurt Harry deeper than the sharpest blade could. But he simply couldn't let Draco go. The love he felt for the ice prince of Slytherin ran far too deep for Harry to even think of giving up on him. Harry couldn't even imagine a life without Draco in it. He wanted everything. Hugs, kisses, commitment, a house, a warm family, maybe children. But none of this mattered if it wasn't with Draco Malfoy, the love of his life.
Hermione must have seen his face fall. Her head spun around, her bushy hair flew all over the place and her eyes widened in shock. Next to Harry, Ron choked on his pumpkin juice and turned red. But Harry only noticed a bit of it all, as his eyes began to pierce and filled with tears against his will.
"Thanks, Hermione.” Harry grinned at his friend and this time poured milk over his flakes. "You seemed absentminded. Did something happen before I was here?” Hermione asked and put a teabag in her cup with hot water.
Harry chuckled low in his throat. "That's another thing that makes you perfect for me since I like to watch you, and only you," he said and twisted Draco's nipples which were already as hard as pebbles.
"Minerva, dear, everyone has to experience the secrets of the heart for themselves. I'm sure Draco and Harry will find each other again. Didn't you tell me about the surprising discovery you made after the war?" Dumbledore asked with a merry twinkle in his blue eyes. When McGonagall nodded he smiled sympathetically. "The two of them survived a war and Voldemort, and managed to stay together despite that, so I think that they will settle this dispute soon," Dumbledore said with a knowing twinkle in his eye.
Hermione‘s eyebrows shot up into her fringe and she already had a prickly comeback on her down-drawn lips as she noticed the almost hidden upward turn of Draco’s lip corner. "I practice speeches like that every day or how do you think I get those two thickheads to do their homework?" she said with an amused smirk on her lips.
Blaise held her gently back at her shoulder when she was ready to storm out the door, "Wait Pans, I think I have a better idea to get back at Potter." A sly smirk played on his lips. "Why don't Draco and I pretend to be dating and let him feel what it is like to get your heart broken?" he said,  gazing to Draco for affirmation.
Draco groaned again. "Blaise! Can you only think with your cock?” he hissed, shooting daggers at his friend.
“Yes, that was something. They seem perfectly fine being in each other's company but then they start to bicker like an old married couple again. I thought that they finally reached the first name basis when we were in Hogsmeade but they started that Potter/Malfoy shit all over again. Though the name-calling and the insults have considerably lessened. What the hell is wrong with them?” Pansy exclaimed, wildly waving her hands about.
He wiped the sweat from his brow and pushed his unruly black hair back out of his eyes. It was even wilder today with all the moisture in the air. Draco beside him was also drenched in sweat, his white long-sleeved button-down clung to his lean body and small translucent droplets ran down his neck into his collar. Harry in his red t-shirt felt hot just looking at him, although that had less to do with the heat in the room, as he incredulously had to admit to himself.
A heart-wrenching sob escaped his lungs as he felt Hermione’s hand on his shoulder. She directed him gently back to the Gryffindor tower, cooing gently words into his ear to keep him going without breaking down. He later couldn’t tell how he made it back. He only felt hollow and empty.
The still-fragile friendship that was building between the six of them persisted with lots of teasing, banter, and laughter and Draco wondered how it was after everything that had happened between them that it came so light and without malice.
"Mr. Potter, did we have an accident?" Professor Sprout asked beside him, eyeing his hand. She held a small pot with healing salve in her hand and gave Draco an approving look. "Well, as I see, Mr. Malfoy has already done the cooling spell. When you are done holding hands, put that salve on, and continue repotting. The lesson is almost over." She nodded to Harry, who snatched his hand back from Draco at her words, and pressed the little crucible into his uninjured hand.
Once she entered his dorm room she was struck with a bout of sudden sympathy. Draco was curled up in a ball, like a small pile of miseries on his bed. And he was crying into his pillow. His whole body was shaking uncontrollably, as she heard heart breaking sob after sob escaping his mouth.
"Malfoy," he breathed while all color fled his face. The one guy he didn’t want to see right now was standing in front of him. In fact, he was standing so close that Harry’s nose had grazed against the soft texture of the blond‘s light blue sweater when he had looked up.
When he finally reached the Room of Requirement, he saw that Harry had arrived there before him. Inwardly, he braced himself for the upcoming conversation, took another deep breath, and opened the door.
Everyone placed their order, the Slytherins a little more reluctantly than Hermione and Ron when Madam Rosmerta came to the table with her mouth pinched.
All three Gryffindors rolled their eyes at them, thanking the Sorting Hat for putting them in Gryffindor.
Harry was his and Draco was jealous of everyone looking at Harry and talked to him like they knew him, while Draco could not even be around Harry as much as he had wanted to be.  He could only hold his boyfriend’s hand in private.
Harry scanned over it and his jaw dropped almost to the ground. What the hell was that? A shiver ran down his back as he began to read from the top again.
Harry was too stunned and startled that he followed her to her office without a word. Once there, he looked around with cloudy eyes. Many of the little trinkets Dumbledore had collected were still there, even if they had been given a new place under the portrait of the former headmaster. Two hard-looking chairs stood in front of the dark desk behind which Minerva McGonagall now sat on a wing chair that was covered with red velvet. The ubiquitous tea set that stood on the left side of the table immediately started brewing fresh tea and a bowl of ginger biscuits hopped happily in Harry's direction. "Have a seat and take a biscuit, Mr. Potter. And if you would be so kind as to take off your cloak, I would love to see you, when I am speaking to you," she said in her brisk tone but the slight twitch of the corner of her mouth told Harry that she wasn't that mad at him.
"Mate," Ron said, sighing, "this is a strategic plan to let you pay, and it bloody sucks. Is Malfoy really worth making such a fuss over though? He's a sodding Death Eater, Harry!"
, fell on deaf ears as he spun on his heel, robe billowing behind him in a manner that would have made his godfather proud, and stormed away.
He was immediately surrounded by strong arms and a wild mop of hair had blocked his view when a pair of hot demanding lips conquered his own.
Had Harry felt this way all along? How could he endure this pain? Draco couldn't. His feet automatically carried him down to the dungeons and to the Slytherin's common room. He had to talk to Blaise today. There was no turning back for him; he could no longer do this to Harry.
Hermione got her wits together faster and eyed him curiously. "Oh, alright then. I don't have an issue with you being gay."
A certain kind of cold began to seep into his broken heart. The one that Harry had once thawed and made his own, going back to his original state, just even more abused than it had been. Draco's old mask of cold indifference slipped on like an old well-loved glove. His heart hardened and froze. He swore to himself that he would make Potter pay. That he would rip Potter's heart out and trample all over it, burn it to ashes, and laugh when the remains shattered in the wind of his wrath.
"Oh come on, Draco. The hickeys on your neck are evidence enough that you're seeing someone," Pansy chided.
"No, I didn't mean it like that. I just thought, if I had to choose someone, it would have been him," Harry explained, feeling really bad. He had never liked Cedric that way and now using him like this, it felt wrong. In general, this whole conversation felt utterly wrong to him, and instead of it getting any better he had only managed to get himself buried, deeper, and deeper into this shit.
Draco groaned in surprise and excitement and Harry seized the opportunity and plunged his tongue greedily into Draco's mouth, twisting and licking the walls of Draco’s mouth and tongue.
Blaise looked sternly back. "If you don't keep your word, we will hunt you down and curse you so badly you'll wish you never messed with a Slytherin. We will take him away from you, this time for real; we won't let you harm him again."
"He's bi-sexual, Weasley. Don't you know anything?" Pansy sighed and handed him his gloves as he reached out for them. "And you are clearly straight and so is Hermione. What is Potter?" she asked innocently and pushed a damp strand of hair behind her ear. She had noticed the looks Potter threw at Draco and they weren't the ones he usually got from the Golden Boy. Something had changed since they first became friends with the Gryffindors and Pansy wondered if there could come more for them.
"Why did he lie? It's been two years, Pans. Fucking two years!" Draco said, suddenly agitated with anger. He pushed slightly back from Pansy's warm body to look into her face. "Just last month, he told me that he loves me and that he wanted to be with me. And the idiot that I am let him into my life, into my mind, my heart, my body. I fucking gave him my first time, Pans, and for what? He lied, he pulled one over me, talked about me behind my back with his friends and I still can't-," Draco's breath shuddered as the last image of Harry sprang to his mind. Harry standing there where he had left him. Trembling, tears falling from his green eyes and running down his tanned cheeks, dripping off the jawline that he loved to kiss. "The sight of him after we were done ... he looked so broken, empty. I wanted to go to him, but I didn't- couldn't…" Draco's eyes searched Pansy's for answers to the urgent question squeezing his heart. "Did I do the right thing, Pans?"
Hermione was a clever witch so she didn't really believe it, but suspected it was a scheme to get back at Harry. One that was really mean, but so very Slytherin of them. Harry hadn't said those things about Malfoy, because he really believed them, but because he was afraid of losing his first real friend. Harry's living muggle relatives had never been particularly warm or loving to him, so he was afraid of losing the new family that he had gotten through Ron and Hermione.
"Okay, I will talk to them, just give me some time," Harry said and then suddenly grinned. "Are you up for some more snogging and maybe something more?" he asked, cheekily with a raised eyebrow.
Draco had his eyes tightly squeezed shut, a dark blush riding high on his cheekbones, and groaned in dismay, "I think I’ve gone blind.”
Draco gaped at them. Was he really that obvious? Then again, these were Slytherin’s he was talking to; he should have known that they would find him out.
Harry choked on his cornflakes and groused out between coughing to get his windpipe cleaned, "No, … no-thin..”
Harry nodded to the girls and turned on his heel to flee the scene but Pansy was faster. "Accio parchment” she whispered almost unheard and the grumbled paper flew into her waiting hands.
Draco jerked awake into a sitting position, grabbing at his pajama top to feel for the now-closed Sectumsempra scars. '
Harry smiled at her. He was glad that he had forgiven her for trying to rat him out to Voldemort. The circumstances at the time were not the best and he had found it in him that he could understand her need to protect herself. He wanted to leave the past where it belonged and live in the present. And making friends with former enemies was certainly interesting.
"What? You're saying Harry and Malfoy are gonna starting dating 'cause they're spending time together?" Ron laughed at the thought, but Harry's stomach squirmed at the thought and a light blush spread over his cheeks.
The restaurant was definitely an expensive one, Draco noted as they followed a waiter to their table. He was used to going to expensive restaurants, but it was rare for Harry to take him to one, or even suggest it.
When the shower turned on, Harry walked over to his bedside table and picked up the framed picture he had of his parents and the rest of the order. He smiled ruefully down at the image, he wondered what his parents would have thought about him liking Draco. Same-sex relationships weren't exactly widely accepted. Granted, they weren't illegal and could get married (unlike muggles), but many still didn't approve. Dean and Seamus had already gotten several disapproving looks since coming out as a couple, but they mostly just took it all with a grain of salt. He hoped that his parents would have been happy for him.
"You two really need to stop your petty bickering, you know? It's been going on for years," Hermione said, heaving a sigh.
"You guys want to join us? We're just going to Zonko's and then heading back to the castle," Neville said.
"Wait, stop-" Harry said as Draco leaned down and planted a kiss on the corner of his mouth. Harry's mind seemed to go a bit blank. Draco was kissing him again, he thought, and it'd be so easy for Draco to attack him right now. He couldn't seem to push him away though and he found himself leaning into the kiss as Draco's hands found their way to Harry's hair.
"You should've taken them off then and come in. They'll dry anyway," Harry laughed, and splashed into the water next to Draco who glowered at him.
"You totally skipped the first two steps!" Pansy said, getting out the notebook. "You went straight to step three, or I guess more like step four."
"Maybe I'd be nicer to her if she had given me a hangover potion," Ron responded and Hermione rolled her eyes.
Draco kept his eyes determinantly on the thestrals, "I was quite horrible in your class. I didn't mean any of it, I really actually quite enjoy the class."
"I think so?" Harry said, eyes finding their way to Draco across the room again, "I was going to ask if he wanted to sit with us actually if that's okay?"
Harry had been trying to tell himself all night that he was just paranoid and that perhaps whoever he liked used the same shampoo. He tried to ignore the fact that it was definitely cologne. He was also trying not to pay attention to the important question of why he even knew what Draco's shampoo smelled like.
"You know what I mean! I just think it'd be nice to actually find someone for our final year here don't you think? I know we all joke but I really think we should try and just have a normal year. And if you like Potter there's really nothing wrong with that Draco," Draco groaned and threw his head back, "And you Blaise, you should just admit it if you like him. In my opinion I think he'd say yes and if he doesn't like guys we both know he's too nice to be mean to you about it."
They both slowly pulled away after what felt like both an eternity and barely any time at all, eyes still closed and breath mixing between them.
In a last ditch effort, Draco said the first thing that came to mind to get him to stop talking and to just end the whole thing, "I don't like you! I don't, alright? I don't want to date anymore!"
"I am not always up to something! Maybe I just want some sort of privacy from you for once! You've been stalking me since first year!"
“You’re not slick Harry, you can’t just hold someone’s hand in public and not expect anyone to notice,” Hermione replied, rolling her eyes, “Ron’s right, you really are helpless.”
"Oh don't go getting upset," Pansy said rolling her eyes, "That wasn't meant for you, it was for them." She shot a look at Draco and Harry who sat defiantly staring at their plates and had been very quiet.
Draco gestured to Harry's armful of candy, "Every time we've come here you've gotten an arm-load of candy."
"Anywhere you want," Draco said and then paused to take in Harry's unsure stance, "You have made a fort before right?"
Harry groaned as he leaned into Draco, placing his hands on Draco's chest again. Draco pushed him back to the wall, their chests pressed against each other, their tongues moving together, fighting for dominance. Draco ran his hands back down his chest again, brushing his nipples, and Draco felt him moan, arching up into him and he got an idea.
"I hate sharing a room with him! He's the most annoying roommate I've ever had!" Ron groaned  at the table at breakfast the next morning. Hermione was seated next to him and Neville and Harry were seated in front of him.
“Well, I mean, you are right,” Harry started and both Ron and Hermione turned to look at him, Harry was surprised they didn’t get whiplash.
“Listen, Draco,” Harry reached out like he was going to grab his hand but thought better of it and dropped it down to his side again, “I really am sorry. I’m kind of an idiot, I uh- didn’t mean to make you upset the other day. I wasn’t thinking.”
"He's done it more than once and I want to get the stuff back. They were some fireworks and things that Ron was planning to use then when Gryffindor wins against Slytherin at the first match this weekend."
"We're in a first-name-basis now," Harry replied, trying to hide his blush, but Hermione noticed it anyway. Her eyebrows rose slowly in recognition.
Harry looked up at him and Draco gulped, his face getting a bit hot in his nervousness, and he had to look away. "I have a feeling it wasn't a death eater," he said and Harry looked up at him, a questioning look on his face, "I just mean, don't you think it was a little sloppy? They could have just switched out the potion to something else, that probably would have had better results. Think about it, what do you think they wanted to accomplish by dumping veritaserum into the potion?"
"No way, really?" Harry breathed, and turned a bit to peek at them again. They were laughing now and Neville was still holding Blaise's hand on the table. "They are pretty cute together, I've got to admit. Hey! That's what Ron was talking about then earlier today!"
"Thanks, it means a lot," Draco said and Harry suddenly felt a surge of fondness for the boy, that he quickly fought to ignore.
"Anyway, I have to hang out with him for at least an hour on weekdays and two on weekends. She said it was to promote 'inter-house unity' and all that."
Harry woke up shivering and his back hurt. He tried to sit up and when he couldn't he looked down to see Draco was laying across his chest. Harry had slid down the wall over night and Draco's head had fallen off Harry's shoulder as a result.
"Wow, I can't believe school is finally over," Harry said gazing down at the water which rolled over their toes as the tide came in.
"Ron," Lavender said without a moment of hesitation and winked at Ron who looked like he wanted to be sick. Hermione scooted closer to Ron. Draco picked up the coin and flipped it, the group watched as Draco caught it from midair and flipped it on his arm, "tails," he announced, passing it to Lavender.
A letter dropped in front of Ron that looked like it might have been from his mom and then a bright pink letter dropped in front of Harry. Everyone turned to look at him as Harry stared at it.
"We'll bring the alcohol!" Seamus proclaimed, grabbing Dean's hand. Hermione shook her head laughing slightly and giving up.
"Hush. Yeah, don't you remember when Neville got all cleaned up for Hogsmeade last week? They were meeting for a date."
Harry set the picture frame back down and reached over to grab his transfiguration homework from his book bag that he set on his bed. He'd been having a hard time focusing while him and Draco studied lately and he now needed to finish his transfiguration essay, quickly, before Draco got out of the shower and stole all his attention away from homework again.
Harry felt embarrassed as Hermione turned the conversation about Draco back to him, "Yeah, he's been nice. He's just a bit reserved."
The second they got back to the common room they immediately split up, and Harry walked over To Ron and Hermione who were talking quietly in the corner with Dean and Seamus.
Draco seemed to notice Harry looking at him across the library, startling Harry, and picked up his stuff to go sit next to him.
"Just because the war is over doesn't mean that there aren't people out there who don't still want revenge," Pomfrey said, "though I don't see who at Hogwarts would want to do so."
"Wait it feels like-" Draco couldn't finish the sentence, his face already coloring a dark shade of red.
What could it be now, she thought with a sigh as she headed up the stairs to their room. She hoped that whatever was going on up there, she didn't need a teacher to deal with it - for all of their sakes.
"Shhh! Keep it down! Someone's going to hear," Blaise shot a nervous look at the door and they all turned to look for a moment.
"I didn't want to get back together with you because I was starting to realize that I might not like girls and I didn't want to lead you on." Ginny's eyebrows went up at that, that was not what she was expecting. Harry continued, "Don't get me wrong, I do care for you, but as a sister." Harry took a breath, he hoped that she wouldn't be mad at him.
Ron grabbed it off his head and shook himself out of his stupor, "Yeah, I know... I just - you're really pretty."
It was messy and his teeth clanked against Harry's, but when Harry finally kissed back, it was oh so worth it.
"Oh nothing, don't worry about it. Just normal Pansy and Blaise stuff," Draco said, ducking his head down to hide his flush. Ron and Hermione stared at the display awkwardly across the table until Dean and Seamus seemed to come out of nowhere, plopping down next to Hermione.
"Alright, I'll be down for lunch as soon as I get dressed," Harry said, quickly recovering himself, "Thanks for reminding me."
Blaise felt giddy and nervous as he stood up to walk over to Neville. Neville looked up at Blaise as he sat down on his knees in front of him.
Harry was fuming now and shot back, "How could you ever think that?! Why would I go on dates with you and everything else if I only wanted to have someone to make out with!?"
It was Halloween and there was to be a party in the eighth year dorms. Dean and Seamus were in charge of bringing alcohol as they seemed to be the best at sneaking unbelievable amounts of alcohol into Hogwarts. The party was supposed to start in ten minutes and Harry was lounging lazily in the corner of the room watching out across the common room as Pansy went through the alcohol piled on the table in a way that she seemed to think wasn't suspicious. Harry figured she would be tipsy before the party even started.
This reporter had been wondering for a long time when it would finally come to this, as the two had been in a secret relationship for over two years with a minor hiccup this year. Luckily, they soon found their way back to each other. If you're at Hogwarts you might stumble over the lovebirds; Laughing, flirting, and teasing each other, both with bright smiles, as they run around the castle grounds playfully while holding hands.
Draco yelped in surprise, his back coming off the mattress. Harry chuckled again as he soothingly circled the abused nubs with his thumbs.
Harry looked at Draco with a determination as close to the one he had when he had faced the Dark Lord. He was damn serious and Draco felt a shiver run down his spine. This was his brave Gryffindor. The man he fell in love with but he wasn't going to let him get away with it that easily. "If you do something like this again, I will string you up on your balls and hang you from the astronomy tower for everyone to see," he glared with arms crossed imperiously.
Fuming, he made it around the table, when he heard Ron mutter under his breath, "... holding hands with that slimy git now …”
But now two years later, the war is over, those looming death threats behind them. Draco's father is locked away in Azkaban. Most of the Death Eaters had been rounded up and caught, so that wasn’t a concern anymore to either Draco or Harry. Harry's side had won the war, and little to anyone’s knowledge Draco had actually helped him, by passing on critical information, in any way he could at the time though mostly with their secretly linked coins. They were finally free to be with each other now, they both knew that the public would still react badly to such news of "light and dark" together. But they were in love, so Draco was willing to take the risk.
So now he got it and he wanted to apologize. The last few weeks without his friends had been horrible. He missed the jokes with Harry and even more the kisses and cuddles from Hermione. And even if he loved his sister, he didn’t want to hang around her and watch her play Quidditch, when he, himself, couldn’t since 8th years weren’t allowed to be on a house team. His thick-headedness only got so far.
If the Great Hall had already been in an uproar because of Valentine's Day, it now looked like a vicious cauldron. Absolutely everyone had an opinion on what had just happened and was loud and clear about it.
Ron groaned in dismay and Pansy let her shoulders hang in defeat. Three rows back, Harry chuckled at the odd pair and shook his head.
"Pans, I- I-" Draco shuddered as he tried to suck a breath into his lungs. "I broke up with him," he breathed out, his tears soaking further into his pillow.
"Hm? Let’s see it then,” Potter said curiously and reached over Draco’s right shoulder, pulling his hand up to his face. "Wow! That’s some crazy patterns you got there.”
Hermione eyed him warily, "What's on your mind, Harry?" She gnawed at her lip, seemingly contemplating if she should cancel the sticking charm. Instead, she cast a
Had his boyfriend lied to him? Played him all this bloody time? For two fucking years? Why had Harry confessed to him, if he had liked Diggory? Was he just a cheap replacement for the dead boy from Hufflepuff? His father had been right. Draco felt like an utter useless fool. He had thought Harry loved him and cherished him, but now knowing that it wasn't true and that it was the complete opposite, he just couldn't wrap his mind around it all.
Back in the Great Hall, Ron glared daggers at Malfoy and Hermione had to hold herself back from not going over and breaking the blonde Slytherin's nose again. It couldn't be true. Yesterday he was still with Harry and today he was already attached to someone else's arm. Was Malfoy just taking the piss out of Harry, by trying to rub it in his face that he could be so easily replaced?
"Would someone care to explain to me what that was?" Ron asked Parkinson as they exited the greenhouse with Neville and Zabini.
Hermione chuckled, mirroring Pansy’s expression, and a certain kind of knowledge settled into her mind when she thought back to Harry’s reaction. He hadn’t seemed all too upset about it. Rather amused and curious. She smiled to herself, "I‘ll make sure he gets it."
"Only a friend, Nev?" Zabini asked curiously, pulling Neville closer by slinging his arm around the Gryffindors shoulder.
"Because it would be good for your reputation and ⅔ of the Golden Trio are actually fun. Blaise will come with us. I already told Hermione.” Pansy counted on her fingers, while she tried to look intelligently at the ceiling.
"Fine. Fine! I will ask her. Kindly! But if she hexes me you both will pay," he exclaimed and strode dramatically to the door.
"Tell me, is Zabini into boys or girls?" Ron asked Pansy casually, mixing dragon manure under the earth. "Hm?" made Pansy absently, having just checked her book for Advanced Herbology. But now she looked up and her gaze slid from Zabini to Neville and a shrewd expression came into her eyes. "Oh, are you jealous, Weasley?" she giggled and thrust her elbow into Ron's ribs.
"Oh God, Harry..." Draco moaned loudly. He couldn't begin to describe what Harry's tongue did to him. He felt so vulnerable like this, but at the same time it was utterly amazing and hot and his balls drew up, initiating his pending orgasm in a rush. But no matter how hard his prick twitched, it could only leak pre-cum. Draco trashed and moaned to no avail. The thing Harry had put around his genitals before prevented him to find completion.
Pansy and Blaise nodded, both wishing their friend would have chosen someone different to fall in love with, but since something like love couldn't be influenced willingly, they hoped Draco had found his luck with Potter. Thus they would hold their mouths shut and hope for the best.
"Listen, Harry, you know I like you and care about you. I would like to be there for you when you feel bad. You can lean on me. We could go and do something fun together. I've been thinking about asking you out for three years now but with the upcoming war and You-Know-Who on the loose, I held it back, but I can't anymore." She took a deep breath and lifted the black-haired boy's chin with her index finger so that he had to look at her. "Harry Potter do you want to go out with me?"
Banishing everything that had happened in the past half an hour from his mind, Harry finally got out of his bed, snatched a towel and fresh clothes from his trunk, and walked out of the room. He needed a shower, a cold one and he wasn’t keen to ponder why he needed it cold. Ice cold.
Draco watched the stuttering dark-skinned boy with contemplating eyes. He wasn’t used to Blaise being anything other than straight forward and thus knew that his former friend was serious about his offer. He didn’t need to think much about this. Raising his chin, he stood up straight and walked over, placing a hand on the other boy’s shoulder. "I’m sorry, Blaise. I would like to be your friend again."
Harry didn't eat anymore; he paid less and less attention in class and had argued with Hermione about it. Ron sat helplessly in the face of the whole spectacle; Harry didn't want to take any advice from him on the subject of Draco. Sleep had become a foreign word to Harry and so he had started to watch Draco on the Marauder's Map. Again and again, he picked it up and followed every step his Slytherin made. In the meantime, it had even gotten so bad that he never let the map out of his sight and even had it with him during the day and consulted it when the Slytherin’s had lessons in another part of the castle.
The kiss was so caring that it hurt and made Draco almost sob. He felt the apology radiating off Harry's chapped lips cruising through his body, as the last of his tension washed away. He had already forgiven his stupid boyfriend with this kiss but he was now curious about what his Gryffindor had planned for him. Luckily he didn't need to wait long to find out.
Draco cursed and called Blaise all kinds of unflattering things but to no avail. His soon to be ex-friend sat on his chest, laughing like a mad man and held his wrists in a death grip while Pansy painted whistling Draco’s nails. Draco didn’t know the song and it didn’t matter anyway. What mattered was that he didn’t want his nails painted. "You vile imbecile beings. Go away!” he shouted, which made Blaise laugh even more. " Don’t be like that, Draco. Pansy needs to test her new Charms work. What better way to rekindle an old friendship?”
Unconsciously, he licked his lips and blushed all kinds of red when he caught himself in the action. Draco shook his head again, turned, and walked away, resisting the urge to glance one last time over his shoulder.
Madam Rosmerta was flabbergasted but accepted the apology by taking the flowers out of Malfoy‘s hands. Harry beamed at him as the blond made his way back to the table. "You think that was enough?" he asked Harry while sitting down again. "Yes, she looks very pleased," he responded as he glanced at Madame Rosmerta who had a slight pink flush to her cheekbones and smelled the flowers with a small smile on her lips. Malfoy nodded thoughtfully, "Maybe I should apologize personally to all people I hurt over the past years."
Draco's silver eyes were big and wide. His mouth opened and closed as he stared at the beautiful ring Harry had chosen for him. He just couldn't grasp the reality of it; Harry had just proposed marriage to him in front of the whole school.
"I think he has something for you," Blaise said with curiosity clearly on his face, as he watched the confident attitude of the approaching Gryffindor.
Draco walked into the Great Hall and let his eyes roam over the students currently present which weren’t many at this early hour. He let out his breath in relief when no one instantly shot a hex at him and moved fast to his chair at the outside of the eight years table, which was situated parallel to the teachers one.
"Well, yes. But that doesn’t mean I will have somewhere to work afterward,” he said, furring his brows. "No one wants someone with a Dark Mark working for them,” he muttered.
"Well, Mr. Potter, don't hang your head now. I called you here because I wanted to talk to you about your behaviour in the last few weeks. I was informed that you aren't paying attention in class or even sleeping properly. You either don't do your homework or it's incomplete and I have observed that you eat next to nothing. Your clothes have already started to fall off your bones. What are you so worried about, Mr. Potter?" She hesitated for a moment, then went on in a motherly tone, "Harry, you know you can always talk to me about anything."
Harry couldn’t believe his ears even if he had already thought that Draco used Zabini to get back at him. The only words that rang through his head were that Draco missed him and wanted him back. Before he could even think, his feet started moving on their own. He was through the door, grabbing Draco’s arm, and pulled him against his body while his invisibility cloak fell to the ground around him. Heedlessly of Zabini’s presence, his other hand found its way to the blond’s neck and he pulled him in, their lips crashing together passionately.
Silently, Draco got up and swept the fresh tears away from his cold skin. The memory was still one of his most treasured ones, but now it had a bitter after taste. He couldn't believe that Harry had acted at that moment in the bathroom or in the infirmary. But he had said so many hurtful things, that it overshadowed the beginning of the change in their relationship.
Greenhouse four, they were currently in, was a tropical hell. The humidity was so thick that even the glass which separated the colorful plants from the outside world seemed to sweat. Most students had upon arriving thrown off their robes and jumpers and groaned as Professor Sprout presented them with Solem Inflamaris that they had to replant. The sodding plant with its dark green leaves sprouted small yellow glowing balls of sun fire as fruits, they were inedible, but when put in certain potions could warm up the body for hours on end. The heat they released in small puffs once in a while wasn’t harmful, only when one of the baubles would burst open it could leave huge damage because the little flames would grow like wildfire.
"Who wasn’t what?" Ron asked as he sat down beside Hermione and placed a kiss on her cheek. "I asked Harry if Malfoy was hexed this morning since he looked distressed earlier."
"That my dear Darling is the hottest shit I ever read, even better as the one of those two,” Pansy answered delighted while pointing her thumb between Harry and Draco.
"With this ring, let it be known I choose you. I promise to love you and care for you for all eternity. Draco Lucius Malfoy, will you marry me?"
Draco screamed hoarsely as lightning flashed behind his tightly squeezed shut eyes. Harry's thrusts hit spot on every single time. Spit was trickling into the cushion beneath Draco's open mouth. When Harry pulled back, Draco's channel clenched of its own accord, trying to hold him inside, and then he could just breathe and moan with every forward motion of his boyfriend. It felt amazing, almost otherworldly and Draco wanted it to go on and yet never stop.
It had made Draco nervous and since Harry hadn't taken his eyes off him anymore, his nerves had been tense. He still had needed to fix the Vanishing Cabinet without anyone noticing, Severus had been breathing down his neck and Harry's penetrating gaze had been too much for him. Draco hadn't known what to do then, so he had snapped, without wanting to.
Harry huffed a laugh and leaned back, a smirk beginning to play on his lips. "This is somehow fun if I’m not the one starring in it,” he said amused.
He watched with furious eyes as the Slytherin’s' left the hall. He tried to will Draco to look at him but the blond had his head bowed low and stared stubbornly in front of him.
They were currently jostled up in the library writing frantically on their parchments. Hermione sighed exasperated and swished a stray strand of her fussy hair out of her face. "Done,” she breathed relieved, and smirked at the pile of paper to her left.
Harry pulled back a little more, held Draco by the upper arms, and sighed heavily. "Yes, I know what you mean. I've already thought about it, but I still feel torn. I don't like this secrecy either and would love to be with you in public. Just Hermione and Ron ... I have absolutely no idea how they would react to that. The Weasley's ... we don't even want to start, they are still getting over Fred's death.
He didn't understand or knew why Harry would play such a foul game with him. Especially since he gave Harry all of him. His heart, his body, and even his virginity. He thought that they had something special, something more. But it was just poison and lies.
"Ha! Slipped out my ass!" Draco scoffed. He narrowed his eyes and came close to Harry’s face. "We are nothing, Potter. Get your sorry ass back to your sodding friends and leave me fuck alone. We are through," he spat with hard eyes. Then he turned around, held his head high, and left.
spell later and his trunk had tipped his things on his bed, creating more chaos. He began sorting through it, trash and treasures on two different piles. Clothes on a third and school supplies made the fourth. It took him a while but when he was almost done, he noticed that he began to feel a bit better. Cleaning had a calming effect on him as his mother had often advised him.
Harry was not deterred by the fake scowl. He took a deep breath that caught Draco's attention and took hold of both Draco’s hands, holding them tightly. The Gryffindor seemed to ignore the silence that had befallen the Great Hall.  Just like that everyone's eyes were on them.
The scroll bounced off of Harry's head and landed right into Draco’s fish and chips. The blonde Slytherin looked at it in disgust as he fished it out of the vinegar puddle he had accidentally created earlier. "Urg, Bon Appetit," he groused, handing it over to Harry and whipped his hands with the napkin. Harry snorted at the unintentional joke and put the parchment to the side, ignoring it completely.
"Salazar’s blue balls! Pansy, have you lost your mind? I can’t just walk up to her and kindly ask her to remove it. You know my history with her. She will hex me into next week."
"I have liked him since first year and we were together for the last two. Anything else you want to know?" Harry hissed sarcastically, tears springing suddenly to his eyes.
Ron gaped at them in shock, pleading Harry with his eyes to tell him that it wasn’t true. Before Harry could open his mouth though, a red-faced Malfoy sprung up from his chair and was out the door faster than anyone could react.
Harry got up. "I will look where he went," he said. The next moment the doors opened again and a breathless Draco Malfoy strode in with the biggest bouquet in his hands Harry had ever seen. Malfoy stopped in front of Madam Rosmerta, bowed, and presented the flowers to her. "I sincerely apologize again for what I did to you. I‘m really sorry and hope you will accept my sincerity," he said in his best manners.
Tonight they were going out to the lake to work on homework. Hermione eyed him as he made his way towards the door with Draco.
After that announcement, it was like everyone completely forgot about the quidditch match. The hall seemed to explode with chatter. Girls were worrying about getting a dress and guys were talking about who they would invite.
The gesture made Draco freeze. His head was spinning as he stared at Harry's outstretched hand. Should he accept? Before he even had a chance to contemplate it Harry was already talking again.
"You- you can't be serious about this Potter!" Draco's face was getting redder as Harry sat down in front of him, and he just hoped everyone would attribute it to the alcohol in his system.
Harry's mind was also a complete whirlwind of what Dean and Seamus had told him earlier. Experiment? How on earth was he supposed to do that? He knew no one else who was gay- at least no one that was single.
"Is that really a shock?" Blaise laughed, "He was so deep in the closet I thought he'd never make it out."
"And I realized what pink was because of Dean and Seamus," Hermione said, trying to continue the conversation.
Pansy came up to the bathroom door then after a few minutes sitting, smirking, on Blaise's bed. Draco hadn't told them he had a date but Pansy had noticed something was up, regardless.
Panting, he came down from his high, opening his eyes to see Draco smirking down at him. "I didn't even touch you."
"Well, we think that they all have to do with your romantic feelings. Like, red means you love someone, pink a crush, blue you don't currently like anyone, and green means aromantic or something. Green was Hermione's idea."
"We found Harry," Ron shouted when they entered the house and Molly came hurting around the corner engulfing him in a hug.
Draco looked up from his book to stare blankly across the room at Harry. "What the hell is a bucket list?"
"The cutest," Harry said and before Draco could retort he captured his lips again in a light kiss. Harry tilted his head just slightly and Draco's head spun. Harry's hands were in Draco's hair and Draco was asking himself why he waited so long to try this.
"I know, I don't either. Draco is stubborn, he always has been, you know that. Maybe just give him a bit of space to sort it out for himself, maybe he just needs a bit."
"Ginny," Harry said, gently grabbing her arms, "Your family is the most loving one I've ever seen. I'd be surprised if they didn't accept you."
"For goodness sakes, it's not that hard," Pansy said growing annoyed, and before Ron could even express his confusion, "They're dating," she continued.
"Hey Harry, Hermione, Ron," Luna greeted them in turn, "You look happy today Harry and the Wrackspurts around your head seem to have been growing lately too."
2. Because I only had one idea going into this I had planned on this story being about 5 chapters, maybe 10 at the most. I was not expecting it to get this out of hand…
“So in other words you asked him if he had a date to the Yule Ball and then told him he should go simply because it’s his last year, never asking him to go, and all the while holding his hand?” Hermione said, completely disappointed.
"What did you do to me last night," Harry groaned, trying to make his way to the bathroom without walking funny.
“I got your letter,” Draco said when Harry found him waiting in front of the Room of Requirement. Harry looked down to see it clutched in his hands. “You said you wanted to talk to me?”
“As I was saying,” Harry continued, less nervous now that he knew his friends were just going to make fun of him for making a mess of things rather than liking Draco, “I was going to ask him, but I ended up just making him upset.”
A faint smile graced Harry's lips and Draco found himself returning it before he could even think about it, "I love you too," he said, leaning down to capture Harry's lips again. He knew he meant it too. The way Harry made him feel was more than just a silly crush and he knew that. His feeling scared him though, he knew if his dad found out he'd probably be off-the-wall mad. He couldn't help it though as he let his hands travel through Harry's messy hair and he knew he'd never been happier than he was here with Harry.
Draco let out a soft sigh and grabbed Harry's giving it a shake. Harry felt his hand tingle at the feeling of Draco's hand in his.
"Truth or dare, Longbottom," Pansy said as a wide smirk spread across her face and Blaise shot her a very worried look.
"How daft do you think I am? Who is it? Hmmm?" Draco leaned closer to him and Harry scooted closer to the headboard.
Draco let his hand travel to the mess that was Harry's hair. It was slightly damp from sweat, but he enjoyed it anyway. Draco was still getting used to the fact that Harry was dating him, of all people, the novelty of it all still gone away.
“Yeah, at the least he’ll be curious and open it,” Ron said, “It’s in his nature, he’s kind of a busy body.” When Harry glared at him he put his hands up in mock surrender, “Hey, I’m just telling the truth.”
Draco let out a sigh, looking down at the mandrakes, "Yeah. Are you really surprised? My father wanted to do anything that would please the Dark Lord and letting him have full reign over the manor was a good way to show loyalty."
"Who is interested? You said you talked to some people," Harry said, trying to not focus on the way Draco looked when he laid like that.
"Malfoy?" George asked, pulling a face of disgust, "Why would you like that git? He was a prat to all three of you when you guys were younger."
"We won of course, so we have to throw a party," Ron said, handing Harry a piece of red cake. Harry figured he'd gotten before they even played the match, assuming they were going to win. Typical Ron, Harry thought, laughing a bit. Ron seemed to notice the green jumper around Harry's shoulders then and the two bags hanging off Draco's shoulders, and his eyebrow drew together in confusion, "Why are you wearing a Slytherin jumper?"
"Happy anniversary," Ron greeted Harry when he sat down at the Gryffindor table in the dining hall for breakfast.
"You think the color is ever gonna wear out?" Ron snickered to Harry and Harry chuckled in response.
Pansy looked around at the group gathered on the stairs before rushing after Draco. "Wow, your father isn't going to like that very much," she said, leaning against his bed frame.
“Hey, are you going with anyone to the Yule Ball?” Harry asked, proud of himself when he didn’t sound nearly as nervous as he felt.
Harry struggled with knowing what to say. Ron and Hermione were the only ones he'd ever really confided in about his life before Hogwarts, but he also knew that Draco was right. Talking about it might help.
"Wake! Up!" Harry's sheets were violently thrown off him to show a sheepish Ron and an angry looking Hermione.
"Can I sit here today," Draco asked, fidgeting a little and Harry realized that he was nervous. Draco being nervous is rather cute, Harry thought before shutting the whole idea down. He was forced back into the present when he realized Draco was still talking, "Pansy and Blaise are driving me a bit crazy today."
Everyone slowly meandered over to the slowly forming circle and pansy put an empty bottle in the centre for their usual truth or dare game.
"Alright, I'll give you something for it and then you can go if you'd like. I'll have to discuss this with Professor Snape and Headmistress McGonagall and when I have more information I'll come find you, alright?"
"Wow, all that and you both lost," Pansy said with a snicker, "Alright, time to clean up. It's already past one in the morning."
"Oh, good," Hermione said as she noticed him sitting down, "you're finally here, Ginny said she has some news for us."
Draco's sobs only got louder and after a while, an almost incomprehensible string of words fell from his mouth. "Potter ... lied to me ... I'm not his type ... broke up ... him."
Ginny stiffened for a moment; she had not been expecting that response. Harry was in love with someone already? But who was it and why didn't Harry look happy about it? Did she not feel the same way for him in return?
He looked down to the grumbled parchment and with a sudden burst of anger smashed it into the toilet and flushed it down, angrily ripping at the metal chain. His palm hurt and his breath came in short gasps as he slowly got his demeanor together again.
Blaise and Pansy looked at each other and then back to Harry. "Slytherin!" they said in unison and began cackling.
"Draco, honey, breakfast is-" she paused in shock as she noticed the sleeping form of Harry in the bed next to Draco and he wanted nothing more to dissolve into a puddle right then and there. Her eyes widened in shock and she took a long breath, "Breakfast is ready, please put some clothes on and meet your father and I down stairs, him too." With that she closed the door behind her and Draco could hear her soft footsteps get softer as she walked down the hall.
"Alright, so now what? It's only ten, not exactly time for lunch or anything yet," Harry said, shuffling through his bag and pulling out some Liquorice Wands and offering one to Draco who happily accepted.
"What did you come to talk about?" Harry grumbled, feeling slightly put out after being thoroughly embarrassed.
Harry stopped him by pressing his lips back against Draco's and Draco soon lost himself in the kiss and let his hands trail a line of fire down to the waistband of Harry's underwear. Hooking his fingers under the waistband, he yanked them down and off; Harry shifted to let him do so.
"Draco," he screamed as he saw the blond Slytherin’s back from afar. "Draco, please wait!" Harry pleaded, running even faster to get to his beloved.
"Next weekend, it will be two years on the dot," Draco said almost bashfully. Blaise choked on his spit. "What? Two years?" he exclaimed. "And you didn't see the need to tell us before now?"
But Harry didn't feel like eating. He just waited until everyone had food on their plates. His gaze slid over the Slytherin table. It will be soon. In a moment he would go over to Draco and personally give him his present.
Minerva smiled slightly as she thought back to how she had caught the two boys tightly embraced in a remote alcove when she was searching the school for injured people after the fight.
A week had passed since the incident and Harry was at his wits' end. He had tried several times to catch Draco alone, so he could talk to him, try to explain. But there was always either Parkinson around him, who treated Harry with profoundly evil insults, or Zabini had wrapped his arms around Draco's waist, laughing directly in Harry's face before pulling Draco out of the room with him.
"Oho, Mr. Potter then I'm curious what you're up to. And remember, you've got a lot to make up for," Draco said warningly. He knew he was being petty but he just couldn't let it go.
"Oh, please, Draco! Don’t give me that. We both know how you ranted about him denying your friendship request. Don’t tell me otherwise now." Blaise interrupted.
What worried Ron, however, were three smaller groups with students from different houses who had come together.
Feeling his cheeks catch on fire, he stuffed the sodding paper into his trouser pocket while looking anywhere but the girls.
"Yes, Albus, I think they will come around if Draco Malfoy gets a light push in the right direction," she said and winked at the former Headmaster.
"Yeah, I don't think that will go down well. He didn't talk to Harry, he wouldn't want to talk to us," Ron said, giving up on that idea.
So, for today he told Blaise he needed time alone. He had slipped outside to take a walk around the grounds. In the near distance, he could make out Hagrid's hut, from which whitish clouds of smoke curled up from the chimney. Draco sighed. He felt melancholic today and thought maybe it was a good time to apologize to the gamekeeper about his past behaviour.
Ron snorted, "As if. It’s one of those… uhh~ PG-17 things, right?" He looked at his girlfriend questioning. "Yes, you used the right term for it but we don’t know if it is one of those until we read it," she said, greed bleeding into her expression.
Now looking at the haughty boy in front of her, she again wondered why Slytherin’s always worked in a roundabout way. She knew that the blond had changed but it seemed hard for him to let go of the mask he was used to wearing when interacting with strangers.
"Yes. Pansy has, for whatever reason, disfigured my immaculate self with nail varnish and I want it gone," he said stiltedly in a haughty tone and winced inwardly. That didn't come out the way he wanted. He needed to remember that she wasn’t the enemy anymore, had never been in fact and that he needed her help. So, he breathed in again and whispered, "Please."
Ginny didn't notice the approaching Slytherin and continued to talk to Harry, whom she had dragged down here against his will. "Harry, I know that you haven't been feeling well for the past few weeks. Anyone can tell just by looking at you. I can't go on seeing you like this Harry and stand by doing nothing. Besides, it surprises me since you seemed quite balanced after we returned to Hogwarts this year. What happened that has made you are so beside yourself? You can talk to me," she spoke calmly.
"Oh Darling, what happened? I thought you and Potter were going to celebrate tonight," she asked softly and sat carefully on the edge of his bed. She rubbed a comforting hand over Draco's trembling back in soothing strokes, hoping to calm him down.
Hermione shook her head, "No, we need to fix this. I will try to talk to him. Just be near when I do, I don't trust him to not hex me."
He cursed under his breath as he saw his face in the mirror. He looked like an Inferi. Skin grey, bloodshot eyes, and deep blue shadows beneath them. "Brilliant!" he groused and scrubbed his teeth until he tasted blood.
Draco looked aghast at his friend but then a contemplating look crept into his red-rimmed eyes. What better way to get back at his lying ex-boyfriend than dating the second hottest boy in school? He nodded slowly at Blaise and Pansy clasped her hands together in delight. "That's my cunning boy," she squealed and kissed her boyfriend soundly on his lips.
Harry collapsed onto Draco's back. His body felt boneless as he pressed a needy kiss against the corner of his Slytherin's mouth. "I love you," he whispered breathlessly and carded his hand through the sweaty strands of Draco's blond hair before they both drifted off to a peaceful sleep wrapped up in each other's arms.
"Uhm, I …" Draco whispered, not knowing where to begin. He had wanted to tell his friends for a while now. He had even talked Harry into coming out officially. But now being in this situation on his own, He was immensely overwhelmed. He felt his cheeks growing hot and he couldn't look Pansy or Blaise in the eye. Then he thought maybe it was the best to first clear up the misunderstanding that Blaise had naturally made.
Harry gulped audibly as Draco's minty breath washed over his heated face. Unconsciously he leaned closer to get more of Draco's intoxicating smell of Orange blossoms, mint, and honey.
"Oi, watch it, Parkinson. It's just weird that's all," Ron groused and trudged annoyed up to the castle.
The conversation with Ginny had made Harry think again. It was true what she said about Draco's feelings, they couldn't be so superficial that this argument could permanently break them apart forever. Also, that Draco had simply exchanged Harry for Blaise as if it were nothing, couldn’t be because the Slytherin no longer had feelings for him. He remembered Draco’s parting words when he ended it between them. Draco had been hurt by the things he said to Ron about him, he knew Draco could be petty and maybe it was just a way to make Harry hurt in return. He knew he needed to find Draco and clear things up with him, no matter who stood in his way this time. He needed to pull up his Gryffindor bravery or he could end up missing his beloved Slytherin forever.
"That's because it is a secret, Ron," Harry said, feeling shy and afraid. His feelings were all over the place, standing before their inquisition was so utterly nerve-wracking, his face flushed in embarrassment.
"Eww, that was an image I didn't need in my life. Thank you, Potter... for nothing," Draco growled and made a disgusted face.
Harry shook his head, "No, he wasn’t.” He contemplated telling her about the parchment clutched in Malfoy’s hand, but decided against it. It reminded him of his version, not suitable for minors, and he didn't want to start with that.
Cold sweat formed on his forehead. He had lost it. The sodding parchment was gone. He groaned inwardly and pulled his hair. "Gryffindor‘s left nipple. Fuck!" he cursed under his breath as he backtracked his steps through the castle, eyes pinned to the floor.
Harry nearly exploded at that but Hermione was faster. She took the tome she brought earlier and smacked it straight into Ron’s face. "You’re the slimy git. I'm so disappointed in you. Don’t even imagine coming to Harry or me without an apology," she hissed at her boyfriend, trembling from head to toe with anger.
Was it to give Draco the ultimate blow for being on the wrong side of the war? Was that the background of Harry’s sick game?
"Bloody hell,” Ron breathed with air rushing out of his lungs as he fell back against the backrest of his chair, breaking the spell that seemed to have hit them. His face was ashen and his eyes were so wide that the blue of them seemed to swallow his face.
Harry snorted and walked over to the cabinet. "Glad you like it," he murmured while he sorted through the small glass vials on the shelf. When he had found what he was searching for, he pulled the three boxes open and looked at its contents appraisingly. He nodded to himself and tucked all three of them under his armpit. Then he walked over to the bed and stacked them on the bottom of the bed, laying two vials beside them.
"Draco. We both agreed to call him that," Hermione shot Ron a reproachful look, "and you have no place to criticize, Harry can date whoever he chooses." While Ron continued sputtering she turned to look at Harry, "Thanks for letting us know, even if you didn't actually tell us, but you know what I mean. I'm happy if you're happy."
"Oh yes, Ginny invited me today," Luna said and smiled over at Ginny who turned slightly pink around the ears.
The next morning Draco walked down to Care of Magical Creatures, his first class, with bright sky blue hair.
"That's easy stuff Draco," Pansy smirked as she reached to lift her shirt off, "Or did you want to help."
"Hmm?" Ron muttered, sitting up and looking over at the empty bed Harry normally slept on. "He's probably just in the bathroom, I'll go get him," Ron said, sliding out of bed and pulling on a shirt.
A knock on the door is what finally pulled them apart and Harry got up to stumble over to the door sleepily. Hermione was standing outside the room when Harry opened the door and she handed over a notebook and piece of paper.
"It was painfully obvious how much you liked him, Draco," Narcissa said and Draco blushed, "All you did was talk about him non stop."
"Okay what's first on your long list of stores you want to shop at this time?" Harry said with a bit of a teasing tone to his voice. Draco scowled back at him, but it didn't hold the same amount of venom as it would have held a week ago.
"Your head hurt?" Harry asked as he reached out a hand to feel Draco's forehead. Draco didn't open his eyes.
Ron leaned back too and wrapped his arm around Hermione's shoulders, pulling her into him. "I've noticed too. Do you think he likes Malfoy?" Ron's nose scrunched up as he said it.
Draco and Harry had climbed the winding staircase till they reached their room, which was situated at the top of the stairs. Games had ended early as the eighth-year Quidditch team had their first match the next day and they all decided it'd be a good idea to get decent sleep the night before. They also stayed away from alcohol for the first time since the game nights had started.
“I was bored,” Pansy said with a shrug as she helped herself to a leftover pancake. “This looks like a fancy breakfast. Special occasion?” Pansy said with a wink at Harry.
Draco had been trying to shed the title of Death Eater but knew it would always haunt him and for Harry to bring it up, it seemed like a smack in the face. The only one who stood up for him and his family against the wizengamot, calling him a Death Eater was too much and he immediately raised his wand.
"Don't worry," he assured Hermione, "I wasn't planning on doing that anyway. I'll probably end up just going alone."
Harry smiled after them and made his way back up to the dormitory where Draco was laying on his bed doing his homework.
The day had come for Harry, Hermione, and Ron to get back on the train for their eighth year at Hogwarts, something that Harry was both excited for and dreading all at once. For one, Harry didn't think he'd ever be returning and that thought made him sad, but it also meant coming back to people who were sure to gawk at him.
"What]'s wrong?" Neville asked when Blaise dropped his bag down next to his seat next to him in herbology with a sigh.
The first Quidditch practice was set for that afternoon and Harry knew that Draco would be there. He was dreading it. Especially since practices had been set for Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Sundays, meaning Harry would have to see Draco three times a week.
Draco gave him a warm smile, "Sounds like a good idea to me. It won't be very fun walking back in this weather though," he said jokingly.
"Sounded like you meant them, Malfoy," Harry said, he knew Draco hadn't meant it but he was still hurt.
Draco stared at his reflection in the mirror in Blaise's bathroom. He was dressed in dark pants that hugged his hips and were rolled at the bottom. He also had on a pair of black shoes and a plain light-blue long-sleeved shirt he had gotten over the summer.
"Erm, … up to new adventures?” he supplied forced cheerfully and took another spoonful, chewing pensively. His face involuntarily cringed again.
Draco punched his regained friend in the shoulder. "Don't get used to it," he laughed and suddenly felt better than he had for a long time.
Ron had done a lot of thinking since the fall out with his friend and his girlfriend. He now knew what Hermione and Harry had been talking about when they said that Malfoy shouldn’t fall victim to bullying and that it got completely against what Harry believed and wanted to achieve.
Draco arrived at the Slytherin common room, completely out of breath. He would snatch Blaise up and put a stop to this fake dating immediately. He wanted to get back together with his Gryffindork as fast as possible. The cheeky prat needed him after all. Draco, despite all, smiled a little when he thought back to the encounter with the Headmistress. Only Harry could pull something like that off and get away unharmed.
Draco lowered the letter to his lap. A single tear rolled down his cheek as a small laugh brushed out his lips. He could still remember why his mother had written him this letter.
Harry felt honored and amazed every time that his former enemy trusted him so much. Even after two years of a secret relationship, Harry still sometimes couldn't believe that Draco was his. And this time he had almost lost him due to his own stupidity. Now it was time to make it up to him.
Pansy chuckled, "Yeah Draco, tell us. I've been dying for some really good gossip lately." She slid curious to the edge of her chair and wiped a stray lock of her straight, black hair behind her ear, beaming at him.
He was just about to take a sip from his tea when a brown barn owl swept down and threw a scroll into his lap. Draco flinched and looked anxiously down. He had got enough hate mail in the last weeks since he was back at school, some coming with curses when being touched.
Hermine looked at Ron, rolling her eyes at her clueless boyfriend. "Really Ron, what don’t you get?" she asked incredulously. "Bloody hell, Harry! Malfoy? Really?" he bellowed, blanching.
Now he was sitting here and all the noises around him seemed to have fallen away as Draco Malfoy, his Draco, walked into the room on the arm of Blaise Zabini, another 8th-year Slytherin. The dark-skinned boy leaned in slightly and whispered something in Draco's ear. Draco began to laugh, the laugh that Harry loved to hear so much and usually was otherwise only reserved for him.
