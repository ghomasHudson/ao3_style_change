"Do you really think that's all she knows?"
All of the girls but Ginny and Hermione apparated away.
"I didn't know what it did the first time!"
"I'm sure it'll be fine."
"It's the city of love. What did you expect?"
Draco looked at his shirt, feeling a bit confused, but then realized what Harry meant.
Harry laughed and quickly explained how each appliance worked. Draco looked fascinated as he started at them.
Inside the house, Draco was snapped out of his thoughts when there was a knock on the door. Draco slowly got up and walked towards the door. He was shocked to see Harry Potter and Hermione Granger on the other side.
"That wasn't long."
"Right." Hermione said. "Anyways, we ended up going back in time. Except, it had had been awhile sense I had handled a time-turner."
Harry smiled and hummed.
"Yes, sir."
Draco grabbed the shorter boy's arm and the two apparated.
Starting to get impatient, Draco pulled his fingers out of Harry, beginning to put lube on himself. Once Draco had put lube onto himself and Harry, he aligned himself with Harry. He slowly pushed himself in, knowing the male under him would still be tight. Harry whined as Draco pushed himself into him, not caring about any pain he was in.
"Where?"
"Wormtail, go. See if they know anything." Severus said, not bothering to look at the meek male he spoke to.
"Okay. Thanks 'Mione."
"That'll be the next place we go."
It had been two weeks since Draco and Harry last saw each other. Harry wanted to see Draco, but he wasn't sure if Draco wanted to see him. Draco wanted to see Harry, but he thought he scared him away. The two were both upset about the other person. Harry threw himself into work and Draco stopped talking to everyone, even his mother.
"Have they had sex or not?" Parvati finished for Cho.
"No, she didn't. I faked my death. I healed myself. I didn't want to risk being thrown in Azkaban because I had no one to preach for me, saying I'm good. So I figured, the only way to ensure not having to go was to let everyone assume I am dead."
"How fancy? Dress robes fancy or-"
"Harry. It's not your fault. You didn't know. It was out of your power. If you had known, I know you would've made different choices. But you didn't know. You can't keep blaming yourself for things that aren't your fault. If Cedric heard you right now, what would he say?"
"And so am I."
"Stop. I have to go make the eggs."
"What happens if both of us are wrong?"
"Kingsley, we have some very important information for you. This will completely crack the case wide open." Harry said.
"I have left over fish and chips from my dinner last night. You two take them and eat them. They'll give you energy. I will just buy myself lunch later."
It had been two weeks since Harry had told Ginny and Ron about him and Draco. Surprisingly, things were pretty normal between all of them. Of course, no one ever mentioned Draco or anything Malfoy related. Until, today that is.
"Draco, I'm fine. I'm no thinner than I have been and I've been sleeping more than enough."
"Calm down. We have places to go."
When I still hadn't been answered, I unlocked the door.
Draco almost choked on his food.
"We'll tell you later." Harry said warily.
"Harry, how do I get her back?"
"Don't touch me!" Harry said, shaking.
"What!? You broke up with Ron!?" Romilda exclaimed. "That's why he was so sad when I had to work with him!?"
"I should probably go make sure she doesn't take this personally." Harry said.
"Yes. Yes I can."
"Harry, you'll be with Katie Bell. I assume you know her, she was in your house."
The couple looked around and saw all of the Death Eaters now laying on the ground. The Aurors stood around, picking them up off of the ground and handcuffing them.
"I haven't tried it yet."
"You sounded like Dumbledore."
Before anyone could do anything, Rodolphus had pulled out his wand and yelled, "Crucio!"
"Say something." Harry encouraged.
"Harry kinda went all Dumbledore and pleaded my case." Draco said, a slight smirk on his face.
Hermione's eyes widened at the question while Ginny laughed.
"Well, there is something."
Kreacher put the food on the table and left.
"Why are you wearing a long sleeved shirt?"
Narrator's POV
"Okay."
"He's been more of a father to me than my real father. When I found out he was dead, I was crushed. But, he isn't."
"Yes, mother."
"Draco!?"
"Am I too early? I seem to be the only one here."
"Okay...."
"You said you needed to talk to me." Draco said.
"Thank you."
Previously
"Seems like you really like him."
"How?"
"So...." Ron said Draco was gone.
"O-okat."
"Thank you."
"Again, we owe him."
"Of course? Let's go!"
"Does it look like I care!?" Harry yelled, trying to get his point across. "You're not even supposed to know about any of this! I am not letting you risk your own safety by coming to an ambush we've set up with a bunch of Death Eaters! Your parents will be there! You used to be a Death Eater! It will not end well for you, I promise you! Please just stay here where I know you'll be out of harm's way!"
"Ginny!? Who's at the door?" Ron asked, as he came into view.
"Hi, Draco."
Harry picked the paper back up and read what it said.
All the while, Narcissa stood outside and watched the two boys. Even though she already knew, she was still shocked to see how close the two really were. That would explain the trials and the reunion. But why wouldn't Draco tell her?
"Draco, I can see you're beyond happy. I'm happy that you found someone that can make you feel that way. I don't care if it isn't s female."
"Did you check his house?"
"What's wrong, Ron?"
"Can someone tell me what's going on?" Ginny asked
"Exactly."
"Don't think I'm terrible."
Draco wrapped his arms around his boyfriend's waist.
"I know."
"I don't hate you. I could never hate you. I don't give a shit what we did to each other at school. We're not there anymore. We can be and do whatever out here. If I want to love you, I'm gonna love you. If I want to put our past behind us, no matter how bad and messy, I'm gonna do that. And, Harry, that's exactly what I wanna do. I wanna forget we ever hated each other and be with you. I don't give a shit what doubts you have, that's what's gonna happen. As for your PTSD, why didn't you tell me?"
"I love you t-too, Harry." Draco said nervously.
"Dray, when the toast comes up, put two pieces on each plate and put jam on them."
"That is the craziest thing I've ever heard!" Hermione exclaimed.
"Yeah. But, not today. I have a terrible headache."
"Sit down."
Narrator's POV
"It was a joke. Calm down."
So, he just gave up. He walked through the Ministry, hoping no one would ask him about the fresh looking mark on his neck. He entered his shared office with Ron and sat down. Ron, as he was already there, looked over at his friend and noticed the mark on his neck.
"I would like to talk to you."
Draco smirked before lightly tracing his pointer finger down Harry's length, making Harry shakily take in a breath. Draco then licked Harry's tip, making Harry whimper.
Upon hearing his boyfriends request, Draco started moving at a faster, steadier pace. Harry didn't try to stop the moans coming out of his mouth. With every sound Harry made, Draco found it harder to control himself.
"Come on."
"They were probably snogging." James said.
Draco cautiously stepped towards the swings.
"I have a bed."
Narrator's POV
"How dare you speak The Dark Lord's wretched name!"
"I don't know."
"Have you ever ice skated?"
"That's fine. He's the reason I had to become a death eater in the first place."
Narrator's POV
The the past two weeks they had went to a free concert, got breakfast, and went mini golfing. All in the muggle world, of course. Harry liked getting to really see London, seeing as he couldn't do that with the Durselys. Draco was fascinated by the muggle world, and the two could be open about whatever they had going on since no one knew them. Plus, Harry loved how cute Draco looked whenever they went somewhere new and Draco was fascinated.
"Sorry." Draco said.
"Making sure you're no mad."
"Remember! No one is to know what we just told you!" Hermione said.
"That's why you didn't want to wear a t-shirt?" Harry asked, taking a step closer to Draco.
He already had all of the details worked out and he had heard back from Harry. They were all in agreement and had worked everything out.  He just needed to make sure everything went according to plan.
"More, harder. D-dray." Harry moaned.
"What's with all the questions, Potter?"
"That's genius, Harry!"
"No problem."
"He's not happy."
"And, earlier, when I said you could come by anytime..."
"Put your arms back around me."
"Yes it does. Some Death Eaters who haven't been caught make some Polyjuice, somehow manage to get my hair or something, use it, goes to Azkaban, and then people escape. It's clearly related, I just don't know how."
"I mean, I still need time to fully process it, but I don't want to lose my best friend either."
I grabbed the red head's arm and we appeared outside the house.
"Yeah. Do you have anything else on your mind?"
"He told me a day or so after they started dating." Ginny said.
"Speaking of Draco, I wanted to tell you that I like him."
"And it is not by my choice that I leave. But I love my husband too much to leave him. And I love him so much that I don't want to risk him leaving me. But, my dear cousin, I will never forget you for you will always be in my thoughts. Goodbye, Leta. I love you."
"Draco?"
Severus motioned for all of them to leave, Narcissa going back to Malfoy Manner and the others going back into the hidden spot in the wall.
Draco and Harry both chuckled as James and Aurora came down the stairs, trunks in hand and owls in their cages.
"Yes you are! You were more cut out to be an Auror in our second year than any of the actual Aurors. I don't know what to tell you about the case, but you will figure it out. Especially with Weasley and Granger helping you. You three aren't the Golden Trio for nothing. It's only been a few days. Don't beat yourself up."
"That was not funny! You could've gotten hurt!"
"Do you and Draco have anything planned to do soon?" Hermione asked
"You're not an auror, 'Mione. You don't have to worry about this." Harry said
"What does this mean?"
"Like you're one to talk." Harry spat back.
Harry watched silently as his boyfriend walked around the kitchen, making food that smelled amazing. Harry smiled as Draco piled two plates high with spaghetti.
"Dray, my ass hurts." Harry whined.
"Dray?"
"I know, but you almost died. I want to cuddle and protect you now."
"Why are we at a park?" Harry asked.
Harry rolled his eyes at Draco. "I can't stand you sometimes."
As the two walked away from the house, Ron stopped and turned to Harry.
"What do you want me to do to you?" Draco asked.
Harry smiled fondly as Draco cheered at the toast.
I walked into Ron's room and sat down on the floor.
Draco ran down the stairs of the house the two now lived in together.
"What does that even mean?" I asked.
Then, Draco walked through the front door, stopping and smiling at the scene in front of him.
"Hermione. Be quiet."
Harry touched my shoulder. I looked at him and saw his eyes already on me. His eyes filled with worry, but still glimmering.
As Harry and Hermione neared the house, Harry got more and more nervous. He honestly thought he was going to thrrow up. Despite this, he thought he looked calm.
"I-I didn't know you were here. You scared me."
"I need to talk to Ron."
Draco chose that moment to jump off the swing.
"Okay, well, thank you. That could prove helpful."
"You're right, we do not know that." Padma said.
"Good."
"You're making us tea?"
Draco pulled me into his chest and wrapped his arms around me. I tried to blink back my tears, but that only resulted in them falling.
"I know. Before, I was terrified of what someone would've thought of my feelings. But now that we're out of school and we we've seen Draco's true colors, I'm gonna be a little more open.
“Aw, don’t be grumpy,” Draco pouted. “I missed you.”
It seemed Potter went for another and Draco fisted at the sheets, threw his head back, and groaned, "fuck, Potter!" before he regained some composure, lifted it his head, and threw Snape a hard glare. Though his eyes quickly snapped back to Potter as the other boy spoke.
Below him, Potter seemed to have some issues breathing, but Draco didn’t actually hear him panting, because there was a loud buzz that started out softly in his ears, moved down his spine, and ended up strongly thrumming in his arse. It was very distracting.
Harry grabbed Malfoy’s hips before he could get too far and made him sit back down on Harry’s groin. “That was an invitation . . . if you’re serious about this whole thing, that is.”
“Surely, we can have one civil conversation," Blaise chuckled. "I just want to know your opinion on Potter’s . . . affection toward Draco.”
somehow managed to teach my heir bloody occlumency without my knowledge! Let alone my consent! It is only coincidence that Draco managed to find something of mine instead of yours and you know it! But I will give you what you want, Narcissa,” his father laughed darkly. “Reason to hate me: it is a horcrux.”
"Platinum?" Snape growled. "Honestly, Potter--"
Draco giggled, somehow that stupid statement had made perfect since to him. It was all in his chin, Draco liked to make it look pointy and tried to do so.
She strode away, and Draco was free. He turned to glare at Granger, only to find her still blinking at him, red as a tomato. She’d somehow managed to slick all her bushy hair into a smart looking bun. The sight was distracting.
“Master—oh, my!” Linky gasped.
The heavy movement of a man that Potter had become throughout Draco’s orgasmic haze fucked him through his many aftershocks, but soon Draco found himself empty and dragged to the floor. Knees painfully smacking the ground, more tears fell down Draco's face around a silent cry for no reason except to satisfy his impulse. He heard the slick of Potter stroking himself, and opened his eyes and mouth seconds before Potter jerked and shot, pearly globs of cum making art out of Draco’s ruined face.
"Well, I wasn't willing to take that risk--"
Draco smiled.
“Why? Because I'm so fucking sexy? I couldn't possibly want a real man to fuck me?”
"That, and we are siblings of the air," Luna claimed.
"Dinner's in ten minutes and Theo said he'd really like to be able to change out of his robes without life scarring next time," Pansy relayed and then stepped out of the room. "Oh," she called then popped her head back in, "and Blaise said twenty points to Slytherin for not fucking it up, Draco."
As he was drifting to sleep that night, a sleepy thought crossed through Draco’s mind. Maybe . . . Narcissus was trapped in . . . just like . . . Draco would ask Owen tomorrow . . . probably.
“Rags?” Potter growled.
“Oh, I've noticed,” Malfoy threw Harry’s words back at him. “Too bad I like man boobs.”
Nott grimaced but followed Draco into the kitchen nonetheless. He joined the table and soundlessly accepted a purple cup from the witch. "So," Draco drawled once he was comfy. "What has Pansy done this time?"
“I can’t believe you want something like this,” Draco admitted, his voice void of emotion. If Potter wanted to talk . . . well, Draco could
"I'm not about to tell you that, Potter!" Draco spat, indignant.
"And you are an arrogant--"
Draco broke off,  and failed to mention how recent the development was compared to his time dancing at this studio. He did not want to think about what Jean’s diminishing presence in her own lessons might mean. Or how this past school year she had seemed to age forty years in his absence. Or how he would have to leave her alone next school year as well.
“Have you engaged in sexual intercourse in your current form?”
Draco sagged in his chair and let his father rant. When Draco was finally dismissed, he all but ran for the door only stopping when he heard his father’s voice.
Draco laughed, relieved that she comforted his almost-fear.
See, Potter, he’d never showed much inclination toward anyone, but especially not the same sex. Draco was ninety-four percent sure that the Golden Boy was as straight as they came. Draco was also sure that even if Potter was gay he would never go for an ex-Death Eater who had made his life hell for years.
“I'm not now, am I?” Harry said, indignant.
“Shut up,” Harry said, but he flashed Draco a smile.
“Please,” Malfoy breathed.
Jean stopped him with a wave of her wand, his feet suddenly stuck to the floor. “Talk it out, boy,” she instructed. “I do not like quitters.”
“Excuse me?”
“Please?”
?” Draco bit his lip, but quickly spoke on despite his hesitance, “I was so careful, Potter.”
Malfoy eagerly slipped his fingers inside, and Harry bit his lip as two long digits began to work open the tight muscles of Malfoy’s backside. As he began to stroke his swell once more, Malfoy grew more animate than Harry had ever seen him. Moans and curses fell from Malfoy’s red mouth, and his body quivered and misshaped in his urge to please himself.
“He—she?” Harry questioned.
“What I believe Narcissa is trying to say, Severus, is that Ronald Weasley dorms with Harry Potter, does he not? That is one sure way to involve the Potter boy in this plan when we could easily avoid the unnecessary risk toward Draco altogether. For, if our assumptions are correct, this piece of Lord Voldemort would not know anything about Harry Potter. The threat should not directly harm Potter, and Dumbledore, if he has a shred of decency left, will be forced to play his hand without his wild card.”
Ron had to stand up at that revelation, he moved back toward the fire and began to pace; the idea of
Snape and his father sighed after his father had waved his wand and vanished the fruits.
“Malfoy,” Harry growled. “If you don’t stop teasing me—“
Of course, this was how Snape found himself in the doorway to the boy's dorms, staring at Potter's bare arse and Draco in women’s undergarments. Snape had literally walked in right as Potter kicked his own trousers to the floor, climbed on hands and knees, and took Draco's cock in his mouth.
Without his gender or evilness in the way, Draco had known there was no chance Potter would reject him. He could throw himself at the Boy Who Lived Twice as much as he pleased without getting himself hexed in the process.
“About six months ago,” Jamie smiled back at Draco. “Do you like?”
“No nosy family members!” Draco said.
"Well . . . what do you even want to say?" conceded Ron, still huffy.
Draco scowled. “You’re unbelievable.”
Two days later Draco started to think someone (most-likely suspect being his father) had slipped him some Felix Felicis when his mother still hadn't confronted him about it. Draco shook his head to clear it of those thoughts, smoothed out the parchment before him and got back to work.
“Yes, Harry!” Draco screamed, unable to care about their public location any longer. “Fuck me! Fuck me!”
Draco sighed, no other lie came to mind. “To . . . to do something about this,” Draco thought about his biggest problem. Bigger than Horcruxes, manic mothers, or horrible house elves. Next time he would make certain to layer his reasoning as much as possible before getting caught.
Draco hadn't thought Potter would have been interested in his legs since he never bothered to rid them of their hair. After all, Potter liked the more feminine side of Draco, that much was clear. Though, Potter wasn't wavered in the slightest, he made his way up Draco's leg, licking, biting, and sometimes taking the hairs between his teeth and tugging, until he'd reached the palest, smoothest, and highest point on Draco's thigh. Only then did Potter get back on track and mouth at Draco’s hardness through the silk until he was sopping wet with Potter’s spit.
“Mmm, that sounds like fun, Potter.”
, there was no other word for it. He hadn’t been this utterly incapable of anything since Harry Potter had . . . well, since he’d met bloody Potter.
Oh, and what sweet revenge it was, to have a night and morning stuffed full of Savior cock. Nothing like a swell and hard shag to make one forget all about their exes.
Draco had started to sweat the moment he walked from the table and felt Harry’s eyes on his back. By the forth song, Draco was drenched from his own constant movement and the other bodies grinding against him. By then, the hands pulling off Draco’s shirt were completely welcomed. The heat and loud music had Draco feeling every single drop of alcohol in his blood, and he couldn’t help but smile as the world flashed around him – a blur of neon, skin, and homosexuality.
“Oh!” Draco sneered as he saw Harry hovering there. “Here’s Potty now. Well, too bad I’ve already found better company.”
Potter hadn’t noticed him, but . . . Snape's eyes narrowed and quickly honed in on Draco's face. The foolish boy propped his head up with one arm, smirked widely, and merrily held Snape’s gaze. Snape glared at him like he was an idiot. Snape was about to turn when suddenly Potter had his wand out. What? Now the boy was going to hex Draco? Snape wondered. Then Potter cast
“Vermouth,” Draco partly lied. “It’s a dry wine.”
“Since you could be what?” Potter asked. “A poof? Do you want to be a girl forever or something?”
Liking what he liked didn’t make him a bitch, Draco had already come to terms with this, no matter what his father thought about the situation. Draco had never held back before, and so he hadn’t held back this time; he’d guided Potter’s cock toward his own wet pussy and started fucking himself on it just as he would with any one up his arse.
Draco took the glass and slid over so she could join him on the ground.
“You’re truly bloody sick for this one, Malfoy!” Potter shouted as soon as the door had been warded.
Draco shook his head, no, he wasn't really mad at Blaise anymore.
“Bad things will be happening if Dobby is being a scared elf.”
!?” Granger snapped.
"Are you telling me," Theo started, his tone very careful, "that the scaly thing did it for you?"
"My thoughts exactly . . . of course, this will call for utter bluntness as Potter has a bit of trouble understanding sometimes," Draco drawled and gestured around the room at large until he was pointing back at himself. "Lucky for Potter, he deals with a wizard who has never been on the best of terms with the Tact Fairy."
“We are the only ones who know . . ?” Snape drawled. “It could easily disappear in a trench halfway across the world.”
how dark magic works--”
"I might not be next time; can we move on?" She clicked her tongue in reply.
“Oh!” Ginny paused her dancing, catching on to the idea. “Yes! And then I wouldn’t have to stay at the burrow. It could be us together like this all the time.”
The pack had stared at Draco, and then blinked as a collective.
“What’s wrong with what I’ve got on?” So, dense, dense, dense, Draco’s new boyfriend was.
Hours later saw Pansy in the boys dorms, sitting on the bed across from Draco's bed, and clearing her throat.
“But you like it.”
Malfoy started to protest so Harry fingered a bruise he'd left on Malfoy's thigh and whispered in his ear, "I wouldn't mind everyone seeing what I just did to you. Having everyone's eyes on me because I walk in to the Great Hall with you next to me looking like sex on legs is attention I wouldn't have to try hard to get used to."
“Oh, Dracooooo! Don’t say that,” Ginny said, patting the recently vacated spot next to her. “Come let me hold you.”
It was only Wayne, his father’s favorite elf who was a complete prick. Draco rolled his eyes and contemplated tossing a pillow at the smug elf just for the fun of it.
“Goody,” Luna said. “The rules go like this . . .”
“Er, you okay?” Harry asked. “You’re leaning a bit.”
the letter make you feel inside?"
With a chuckle that seemed to say Harry was only humoring him, Draco felt all of Harry’s hardness slam into his body at once. Five inches seemed like so much more as Harry began to pound ruthlessly into Draco’s loosening passage. The force behind each thrust knocked Draco’s head against the wall, but that felt good too. Draco served up his last mental ability before his orgasm to thank Merlin that Harry only needed a bit of liquor to stop caring about his weight and use all of it to fuck Draco into oblivion.
with your cousin. Who is three years older than you and should have known better." His father sighed. “You were always so smart and interested in learning new things, yet . . . the
"No, I didn't mean his clothes. I mean like . . . his y'know? His pants? Do you think he's got on--"
“A deal on what?” Harry asked but Draco acted like he hadn’t heard.
Her bet, they were black and silky.
“We have,” Snape sighed, “you are not going to like it, but we fear it is the only way to accomplish your wishes.”
Harry had a feeling Malfoy wasn’t talking about Harry anymore. So, he kept quiet and listened as Malfoy continued his ranting.
“Oh, yes, Potter!” Malfoy shouted as climax overcame him. This time, Malfoy’s powerful come shot hit Harry in the face. Harry licked his bottom lip and the taste of Malfoy’s load, along with his clenching hole, triggered Harry’s orgasm.
She conjured a chair and summoned her writing pad and quill. Draco watched as she jotted down a few things. She did not look up as she spoke.
"Oh my . . . Merlin, Potter! Why do you even care?!"
“Do too,” Ginny said.
"This. This is worse than that, son, we can never let her find out about this or she may very well kill me." There was not a thing in his father's voice besides pure sincerity and this tone always sent a chill down Draco's spine. Surely his mother wouldn't . . ?
"Master Draco be thinking that he and Dobby can solve each other's problems," Draco coughed a bit, realizing himself. "If you run and warn the Weasleys, that could be being bad for father and you, Dobby. However, the Weasleys aren't really important in the grand scheme of things, are they? No. We be needing -- we need to focus on one wizard in particular if we hope to save anybody."
"Keep it in if you must," sighed Luna, "too many tears are not good for you."
In the summer following his first year at Hogwarts, Draco became more familiar with the woods behind his manor - meaning he was no longer afraid to look out the white gallery windows during the daytime. He also spent a lot of time studying, when he was not in the mood to practice Occlumency against his own parents or chat with one of Owen's many portraits. The rest of his time was spent in solitude, pursuing Snape’s poem, dancing, or chasing after puny birds on his broom. True to the vow he'd made at the leaving feast, Draco planned to do everything he could to make Harry Potter’s life a living hell which, of course, included keeping Potter alive and beating him at every quidditch match in the next six years.
Draco retreated to the shower, confident in Linky’s abilities to remove any evidence of Patrick’s sorry self from Draco’s life. After all, any reminders of the other wizard were smashed or torn or burned to ashes and scattered around Draco’s living room.
Rearing back, Harry asked, “what the hell is that?”
“Did you find what you were looking for?” Ginny asked as Draco reclaimed his seat.
Draco was
"Why?" said Ron, completely toneless. He his body gave a violent twitch and the parchment finally fluttered from his fingertips and fell out of sight. "Why, Harry? Why? Oh, Merlin, my eyes! My brain!"
"Pansy, what--" Draco started but she cut him off as she stood.
He added in the last ingredient, following the directions to let simmer until it changed from green to red.
"What about Lucius?"
"Hello, Lucius." Harry said rather calmly.
"Hey! I was having fun!" Harry pouted.
"I'll help you."
"Because, I see the good in you. I saw it that night when you tried to kill Dumbledore. I saw it when you didn't tell the death eaters that it was me they found. I saw it when you hesitated to rejoin to death eaters. I saw it when you ran away from the final battle. I saw it when you let me and Hermione into your house. I saw it when you told me I could come see you anytime. I saw it when you helped me find Hermione. I know you're not bad because I've seen so much good in you. And whether you like it or not, I'm helping you."
"Ummm...."
Draco's smirk grew as he watched Harry struggle against his magic, pulling his shirt off for the male under him.
Hermione kicked Harry's leg from under the table and gave him a look that said, 'Stop it.'
He lost his boyfriend and didn't know how to find him to apologize.
I cleared my throat from my spot in the doorway. All three turned to look at me. Draco looked pleased, Lucius looked annoyed, and Narcissa looked confused.
"You have really hit the jackpot with this, you three." Kingsley said. "I'll alert the Aurors and tell them that it is of the upmost importance that this information stays 100% classified. I'll let them know when and where, and that you three will be in charge."
When they got to the playground, Draco stared laughing.
Draco rolled his eyes and started to pull Harry towards the door.
"Hey, mate." I heard Ron say.
"Come on. We only have five minutes." Harry said to my scowling father.
"Mom!?" Draco yelled.
"Why are you still here?"
"It's fine. I was just worried."
"We'll be with you the whole time." Draco said. "I'll do everything I can to keep my family out of your grill. And if at any point you want to leave, I'll do everything I can to get you out of there. I promise. Everything will be fine."
"Harry?"
"Calm down, mate. Let's just finish up here."
"I don't want to hear any of your excuses."
Harry took the invisibility cloak off and threw it on the floor. He plopped down on the couch next to Draco.
"Shut up, Scarhead."
"Dray, what are you doing?" Harry asked, continuing to wash the dishes.
"Yeah. I'm sorry, I must've spaced out."
Harry Potter ventured through Hogwarts. He was surprised to see that after everything, the walls still stood. Of course, all of it could be fixed with the flick of a wand. But everyone would remember The Battle of Hogwarts. Especially Harry Potter.
"Don't you dare hurt my boyfriend!" Harry yelled as he shot a powerful stunning spell at Fenrir.
"When you put it like that, it sounds really bad. But no. Harry is bisexual." Ginny said.
"Ah, yes. I would introduce you but you all seem to know exactly who he is." Narcissa said.
"How do you feel?" he asked.
"Scarhead," Draco said, making Harry get even more annoyed. "What's wrong?"
"How was work?" Draco asked when Harry got home.
Draco looked at Harry, sensing that he knew more then he was letting on, but decided not to dig any deeper.
"Are you sure? It doesn't look safe."
"Harry! Go back!"
I just chuckled and snuggled into Harry's back, feeling how warm he was.
"She wasn't happy?"
"Wait, back up. You had a trial?"
"Wait, so I had a crush on a gay dude?" Cho asked quietly.
I told him the story of the Dementors coming for Dudley and I. He looked scared as I spoke, but laughed once I told him I'd seen Umbridge there.
"I don't care how mad I was at you, you can sleep next to me still. I wasn't mad at you either, just slightly annoyed."
"This is so good!" he said through a mouthful of food.
"What's wrong?" Draco repeated.
"Harry!?"
"Shit!" I yelled, collapsing back onto the couch.
"That seems easy enough."
"What did he say?"
Back at the ambush sight, the number of Death Eaters that lay around was steadily decreasing as they all got take to Azkaban.
"You'd do that for me?"
ALRIGHT THAT IS THE END. And that might have been confusing. So lemme explain a little bit;
"Okay." Harry said.
"Thank you."
"Alright. Then I'm going home."
"I will, sir! I will!"
"I don't think we should speak for awhile."
Harry laid down on the couch, putting his head in Draco's lap. Draco ran his fingers through Harry's already messy hair. Harry hummed in response, letting his eyes close as he relaxed.
The lock clicked, signaling that the door had been locked.
"Oh shush, that is the least of my concern. I'm just happy he didn't get himself killed trying to fight Fenrir Greyback and his dad."
"S-sorry. I wanted to help..."
"Draco, I am the last person who should be judging anyone."
Everything got silent and Peter slowly creeped out from behind the desk he was hidden behind. He saw all of them still sitting there and quickly ran back into his hiding spot.
"Harry, I'm fine."
"Hermione came here and told me she wanted to end things with you. She asked me for my advice and I gave her some. Then she complained that I wasn't helpful. But from the looks of it, she did what I told her to do."
"Well, when will you pursue any of that?"
"Let me explain."
"Come on! We're going somewhere else!" Harry said as Draco stood up.
"You have the stomach of a pig." Hermione said as she also stood up.
"O-okay."
"Give me Veritaserum, I'm not lying. He was home. He couldn't have gone to Azkaban because when I got home he had made food. And we ate together and then we watched tv."
"No." Draco said coldly.
"No." Draco said, barely loud enough for anyone to hear.
"Oh calm down, you two will be just fine." Hermione said, slightly scoffing.
My mom apparated out of my room and I looked over at Harry. He looked slightly upset.
Draco's POV:
"I don't know. I went ice skating in the winter and this really isn't much different."
Harry's eyes filled with tears again and he looked away from Draco. "Don't be mad." he whispered.
"I don't know." Ginny replied honestly. "But at least if they want to say something, there are other people that know so they can talk about it to those people."
The Patil twins stood off, talking to Ginny.
"Give me details!"
"You just made your mother and probably Rodolphus mad just to keep your promise to Harry." Hermione said.
"He bullied us all through school!"
He heard the lock click and Draco quietly walked in. Draco quietly walked all through the house, but he found no trace of Harry anywhere. He remembered Harry had the invisibility cloak and checked for it. Draco's small but of hope was diminished when he saw the cloak thrown into Harry's closet.
"It's okay. You just get to make us breakfast."
Harry stood up, placing a hand on Draco's, Draco snapping his head to look at his boyfriend.
"But how are we getting to Paris?"
"And, we uh, saw something interesting. We found out my grandmother was a squib. She fell in love with a man with the last name Granger. They got married and ran away together. They had my dad and he was born a squib, which was good because she never told my grandfather about her true heritage. Then, when my father had me, I was born a witch."
Harry's heart swelled with emotions as he heard Draco say this.
"What?" Harry asked.
"Shhh." Harry said. "It's fine. This is what's supposed to happen."
Hermione looked away from Ginny, feeling a pit in her stomache, but allowing Ginny to speak anyways.
Draco and Harry sat across from each other, feeling relaxed.
"I thought I might find you here." she said.
I instantly picked up Harry. He giggled as I carried him to my room and flopped down on the bed, still holding him. Harry readjusted himself but soon enough we were both comfortable and talking. I had one arm around Harry's waist and the other laced in his hair. Harry had both of his arms around my torso and his face buried in the crook of my neck. We talked, dozed, and he set up movies to play. All day. It was perfect.
“Something like that,” Harry huffed, and Ginny and Draco laughed at Harry’s awkwardness.
"Why?" questioned Draco, on full alert now. Next to him, he felt Pansy tense as well. Blaise softly chuckled in the background.
"Our animagus forms for one, which we have somehow managed to keep a secret since we were at Hogwarts!" snapped Snape.
“Ohmymerlin,” she groaned as she fell into his waiting arms and pressed her face into his sweaty collar. “Did you just sex me via potion?”
Draco nodded again. Draco could not let Potter find out the real reason.
"Isn’t it?"
"You truly did bring that one upon yourself, I'm afraid," Luna agreed kindly.
“Alright, where to then, Malfoy?” Harry asked as he stopped them in front of his motorbike and began to strap his helmet on Malfoy’s head.
"You dare to use that spell against me?" His father was suddenly shouting louder than Draco had ever heard. "You have some nerve, Narcissa, to imply that
enemy.
“How did this happen
“Why now?”
His mother's cold voice announced her arrival. The flowers died as she approached them, but they always did that.
“So, you hexed me?”
“We are,” Potter said, sitting next to Draco but keeping his distance.
“Just tell me the damn story!” Draco demanded.
By the time Harry found them, they were both red in the face with laughter and the fifth was empty.
"I brought some tea," announced Luna, as she pulled out a large jar from her small satchel and took a seat at the table.
Potter froze and gazed at Draco, seemed to contemplate the meaning behind Draco’s words. Fucking Potter!
“You’ve done this tons, haven’t you?” Potter accused and Draco could only nod before Potter had his chest pressed against the desk again.
“But of course,” his father replied, smug. “We have a sufficient reason to appeal to the lives of the Weasels now. People will suspect I knew what I was doing--that I deliberately went about a way to bring my master back--but I can at least have the security of playing dumb. Once I make a few more stops, that is. I need one more month for the act to be placed into motion, Narcissa, and some time for a few appearances in Knockturn Alley.”
Wrapping around Malfoy’s every point and lying perfectly across his flat chest, the item was without a doubt made especially for him. Instead of halting Harry in his tracks, thoughts of Malfoy being a spoiled little brat about his knickers made Harry’s cock twitch inside his pants and he groaned aloud.
and the one who only days ago was on his knees, moaning from the sound of your commanding voice. I found myself compelled to write you, my dear antagonist, if only to sooth my own hot desires . . ."
“You’re my date, right?” Potter questioned, still staring at their clasped hands. “I mean, we’re dating?”
"Oh, Ron," she sighed again and went back to reading
Ron started toward the hearth, snatched the parchment off the floor and let it hang above the blazing fire. "This, Harry," he said calmly. "This is how you are going to respond."
“Well, not everything. Just the essentials. However, I forbid you to mention the Malfoys, any of us. I forbid you to mention the details of what the Horcrux will do or what it is if you are somehow still hiding that knowledge from me or we find out. Just say a bad, bad thing is coming for Hogwarts. I am sure Potter will be pleased with an extended vacation. He isn’t much for studying, I’ve noticed, more for space-staring.”
He’d been ‘stalking’ Malfoy for several days now. Ron had said that Malfoy was clearly into it, and Harry had never felt his cheeks grow as warm as then. Yet, there Harry was under his invisibility cloak, watching Malfoy bathe through the vain git’s open window (no matter if there were only supposed to be trees around to see, Malfoy clearly ate up even nature’s attention). Ron had told Harry to make his move days ago, but Harry felt he’d needed to gather more information. Today however, Ron was at Luna’s place next door, talking to Harry through an extendable ear 2.0; one of George’s new inventions based off muggle walkie-talkies.
It was only lying there with Potter still slumped over him, panting and sweating, that Draco wondered how serious his condition might be. Draco could hurry and see Madam Pomfrey tonight, or he could let the potion run its course. At least for one more day. It might be worth the shame to stroll into the Great Hall for breakfast, sit in his normal seat, and watch Potter’s face as he realized his one-night stand had actually been Draco Malfoy.
Dobby and Draco were well on their way to Azkaban, or where ever bad, bad elves were sent. Still in it for the prize, Draco was unfazed and, Dobby, well, the house elf was in it merely because he was a moronic Hufflepuff gone Gryffindor hybrid all wrapped up in a wrinkly little package.
“No,” Snape hissed as Draco’s father nodded sharply.
“Ah!” shouted Malfoy as Harry burst in the steamy room. “Potter!” Malfoy snapped, but quickly flowed out of his instinctive defense stance and began to tease his own hard cock again, drawling, “I mean,
Malfoy tried to order another drink but the bartender looked skeptical, so Harry spoke up.
When Draco spotted Harry returning, he frowned and stopped fondling his silver band. Harry was wearing jeans and T-shirt, but unlike Draco’s similar attire, they were old, ugly, and stained. Ginny had on a short dress of black velvet and would fit in perfectly at any muggle club.
Malfoy lounged in the tub. He liked to fit in a midday soak to relieve tension, Harry had learned. Having already washed his hair that morning, Malfoy’s head hung off the rounded edge. Harry couldn’t see from his angle, but he imagined the softly hanging blond strands were the slightest bit sweaty.
“Teasing you?” Malfoy laughed. “See, Potter, this is why relationships such as these are based off contracts and rules—“
The next evening, Draco was once again attempting to teach Dobby how to act.
“You heard her: she wants a party,” Draco smirked. “I’ve just decided I’m treating this lovely lady to an evening out. I have a special routine for occasions such as these. I call it Draco’s Dash to Disremember. So, I repeat, will you be joining us?”
“You may have a pregnancy test, and further decide how to proceed. You may contact the father and ask him for advice right now or after the test. Or, you may take one potion followed by another and never speak of this to anyone again.”
The rest of the day went much more pleasantly. McGonagall was not subject to the same torture that Snape had been, as Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy had both disappeared after lunch and missed her class entirely. For the time being, Hermione was able to focus better, and Ron was able to tell himself that Harry and Malfoy had possibly hexed themselves silly and ended up in the hospital wing. Though, he hadn’t bothered to check.
Snape seemed to think over his next words carefully. "Maybe," he muttered at last.
"What?" Ron questioned, his brows furrowed. "Course he's got legs, mate! You've seen him ride a broom."
"Okay, okay," Ron soothed and pulled Harry toward his couch before asking, "how
“Of course,” his father had given him an odd look. “But did you really believe your mother would not send a little something for you?”
Draco rushed to her like a starved man would to a bowl of mashed potatoes. Ginny held him and petted his tangled hair. Now, they were both smiling madly while tears rolled down their rosy cheeks.
“Yes . . .”
“No,” Malfoy sighed sadly. “He said he knew that I liked him, but he never really believed me. If he did, he would have trusted me more.”
Draco nodded and sucked in a deep breath. He didn't much feel like crying another tear but the building pressure was undeniable.
“No, Narcissa, you misunderstand,” his father answered just as quietly. “It is
“In other words, you’re worried I’ll find something I dislike about you once you finally let me know more than one thing about you.”
His father glared harder and, even ten paces away, Draco nearly pissed himself from the force of it. His mother only rolled her eyes and asked, "well . . . what
“Excuse me?!” Harry squeaked.
And that was when Harry realized this was all some big joke, and he’d foolishly let Malfoy have him on. After all, he’d seen Malfoy’s thick, seven maybe eight inch cock, and he’d seen his own. It was the skinniest, smallest thing on Harry’s whole body besides maybe his pinky finger.
By the time they reached their next destination, the water bottles were empty. Harry and Gunny eyed the long queue skeptically, but Draco ignored it and cut to the front.
Draco felt relieved. Between his own and Granger’s lessons, Draco had managed to thoroughly distract himself from the impending doom he knew lurked. Two hours and a floo trip later, Draco found himself speculatively eying Granger as he stalked a tight circle around her still form.
"Besides breathing?" Nott's eyebrows were nearly touching his forehead, then he sighed, defeated. "She imperiused me again."
Potter looked up at him with lost eyes that Draco couldn’t decipher, but it seemed that Potter got the point as he gripped Draco’s hips, guided Draco up, and lined his cock with Draco’s hole. Potter paused to flick the tip against Draco’s stretched rim a few times before he gently pressed in.
“Dobby,” Draco hissed, shaking the little body in his grip. “Kindly cease moving and squeaking this very instant.”
to know. I do not . . . I do not care, okay. Yes. I don't."
Hermione reached across the table and smacked him hard. Harry not only blinked, but managed a strangled breath too. It was progress.
The house elf nodded, and indeed was already next to Linky later that night, tugging on his own ears as Draco blinked awake from the lady elf’s snapping.
Draco's father suddenly started to laugh. Under the cloak, Draco was as startled as Snape seemed. "You were bluffing," his father said to his mother.
“You are so fucked, Draco.” Pansy passed him some cinnamon toast under her mumbled words. “Potter will throttle you.”
Draco had to break the kiss and roughly squeeze at the base of his own cock, because his plan was failing already. He couldn’t have helped it, because that was Potter’s cock he felt against his backside. Harry Potter’s perfect cock that was lubed up now, rubbing against his arse, and ever so slightly pushing against his rim. It was the cock that Draco was about to fuck, a cock that was going to be inside him any second. Draco whined without meaning to. He just couldn’t believe that Potter was actually going through with it. That Potter actually wanted to fuck him.
fine. Potter could be his fucker.
“You like your body? Oh, Gods, Granger.” Draco shook his head. “Nobody likes their body. That is your first problem.”
"I changed my mind," Draco smirked.
“You want to let the thing loose in Hogwarts,” his mother guessed before he could finish, and Draco’s father nodded once, curt as could be.
Draco had finally had enough. “Excuse me,” Draco said as he removed her from his person. “I am a perfect specimen of the human body, as you can clearly see. I can only assume you were being purposefully obtuse, to make your sons feel better about their lesser beauty.”
Oh, apparently, Draco was a drunkard as well. As if anyone who had participated in the war didn’t have a few every now and again. Sorry Patrick, Draco’s brain supplied savagely, if you were hiding in the shadows while some of us suffered in the heat of battle. Besides, it’s not like Draco was constantly as smashed as he’d been last night. What he’d told Potter was true. Draco wasn’t usually drunk when he had sex with Patrick. Draco was tipsy perhaps, but it had nothing to do with Patrick’s weight, and everything to do with constantly running from scary memories.
The next day, Draco was bored out of his mind with no hope of an extra lesson. His father was doing something in the library so Draco couldn’t even pretend to research if he wanted to. Still mad at his Godfather, Draco was avoiding his potions lab and the book hidden inside Linky’s keeper.
"What things?" his father asked, seeming affronted.
“He did,” Ginny agreed.
“I will send for him now.”
Theo's eyes narrowed further. "I wouldn't be so smug if I were you, Draco," he warned. "Pansy stole information on Potter--" here Draco startled to his feet with wide eyes and groaned
Sure, one could call Harry fat, but his skin was firm, and while most people his weight would have a bit of flab, Harry was simply made up of thick, wide planes of golden skin that hid solid muscle. In fact, it was almost ironic how knobby-kneed Harry Potter had grown up to look quite like the two minions Draco had used to bully Potter for over half their lives, and which Harry had despised them for it.
"When it comes to Draco's life, I would never lie to you. Besides," his mother spat, "you were the one who taught it to me, were you not?"
“Do you really find him attractive?” Ginny asked, and Draco flushed as he realized where she’d caught him staring.
Draco stroked the shaft briefly before he took it in his mouth. Potter moaned as Draco swallowed the swell with practiced ease. Too soon Draco found himself yanked back to his feet.
"I don't!"
pale stockings.
"What is you thinking, master Draco?"
Potter could really be a fucker, yes, but Draco decided that everything
Draco felt frozen in place while Harry quickly pulled back. Potter’s face flamed so hot it looked as though Draco might have hexed it that way. Potter took a step away, but in the end, didn't flee. Like he was too worried about knowing the answer.
“So, you coming, Potter?”
Wide eyed, Draco instantly stood, threw the journal to the ground and, with a horrified huff, began to wipe his hands on the damp grass. "What have I done?" he shrieked, hoping he wasn’t about to die slow and horribly.
“My . . .” Madam Pomfrey blinked, her astonishment caused her magic to slip and the chair she sat on nearly flickered out of existence for a second.
"I don't know, Harry," Hermione drawled slowly as she waited for Harry to look at her. When he did, she continued, "why don't you go over there and find out?"
Potter made a broken sound, and the noise threw Draco back to real life to the image of Potter underneath him, his eyes squeezed shut, and his mouth parted. That was more like it, Draco thought as he rocked back. The movement ripped another satisfying noise out of Potter, but the angle was wonderful for Draco and he burned so hot the air around him became a cold caress.
"He did not!" Harry burst. "He was just teasing me, I think. Besides he implied that Voldemort torturing him into a twitching bloody mess didn't do it for him."
The room was silent for a long time until Draco suddenly summoned parchment and quill. "If Pansy has gotten to Potter already there's no telling. I must sooth the prat with a strongly worded letter," Draco shared a look with Theo as he finished speaking.
“I don’t think that’s a word, Potter,” Draco said. “Now back up.”
Well, the hall may have quickly sparked with chatter, but Harry was smiling anyway, Hermione was too busy rolling her eyes at Zabini's smirking face to take notice, and Ron couldn't have known having been absent, finally off checking the hospital wing for Harry (he would hear all about it from Dobby in about ten minutes when the excited house elf cornered him in the hallway and wouldn't shut up).
"Malfoy . . . made you hard," Ron discovered flatly, completely unimpressed with his best mate. "Harry, that's pathetic. The guy's a slimy git and didn't even try to hide it! And since when do you like boys?"
“Are you mad?” Malfoy asked.
They rode out the wave of pleasure for what seemed like hours. When Malfoy finally collapsed on Harry’s chest, Harry quickly wrapped the small waist up in his arms. Harry couldn’t bare to let Malfoy go now that Harry had had him.
“Hullo,” Draco said.
much . . . Jean, the best private dance instructor the Wizarding World had ever seen, just wouldn’t have it. Quidditch required a lot of intensive muscle, you see, whereas ballet required a body full of limber ones. Trying to develop both at once was nearly impossible, and ballet was painful enough, thank you very much. Draco wasn’t about to harm his own body over  Harry bloody Potter. Neither had he even considered quitting ballet, not when he could finally wear his pointe slippers for twenty minutes of each lesson.
fault!” his father continued and tried to sit up but was forced back into place by Snape’s hands on his shoulders.
“I told them I was bringing a date,” Potter said, and the soft tone caught Draco’s attention.
This seemed to make his mother pause, and Draco couldn’t help but notice how the crazy look in her eye grew cold and hard. “I know,” she said and raised her wand again.
“Yes, black,” Malfoy moaned, and thrust up into Harry’s face, which caused his tongue to flatten over the silk covering Malfoy’s tip, so he could feel every ridge. “The question is, Potter, do you want black . . . or white?” drawled Malfoy, as he slipped a thumb under the silk, shimmed his hips until the knickers slipped down past them, and his cock was freed to slap against his pale belly.
Draco’s blood froze in his veins, but his father continued. “We do not know how, but what else could have completely obliterated the protection he had placed on him - specifically to ward him away and from the possession of any nearby pieces of the Dark Lord? The same ones I have placed on all of us, which still stand strong? I may be a lot of things, Narcissa, but what have you two always trusted me with?”
“Now, now, boys,” Madam Pomfrey cut in, a look on her face that clearly said
“Yes,” and, “don’t stop,” were all Harry could bring himself to utter, and Malfoy didn’t stop until he was frozen in orgasm. The sweaty tufts of his hair blew in the wind from outside as his body clenched around fingers and spurted pearly globs along his tense stomach. As Malfoy collapsed back into the tub, Harry watched the come gather in the crease across his bellybutton.
“No. Crucio!” she yelled again, and the same thing happened.
“She needs her rest,” Draco hissed. “Is that going to be a problem? Because I
imperiused?” His mother’s tone was steel, she seemed to be watching his father’s back. However, for the life of him, Draco couldn’t fathom what that combination could ever possibly be used for.
“Draco do not think I haven’t noticed you have been home for over two weeks.”
“Patrick, that’s why!” Draco stood and started pacing as he pulled out his bun and ran his fingers through his hair. “He acted like my father, but worse because my father doesn’t care about anything anymore, especially me.”
"Oh, Merlin, no!" Ron screeched.
“Probably.” Draco shrugged. “There
One more bottle split between them and Draco and Ginny made it through another two clubs. Harry, on the other hand, refused to drink any of the potion and demanded they return home at a quarter past three in the morning.
Malfoy stared at Harry rather seriously for being three sheets to the wind and drawled, “you avoid me. Don't think I haven't noticed.”
“Well, you see, the thing about Harry is . . . he’s sort of got this . . . protectiveness about him that could very well sometimes be mistaken for possessiveness or . . . maybe obsession?”
managed to think of an insult I take it?" Draco asked, and kept any nerves he may have felt from tainting his voice.
"Because you are a selfish bastard--"
“What was in those drinks Luna gave us?” Ginny said as she strolled happily from Lindy’s. “I feel great.”
Draco sighed and thought for a moment. “Well, basically tell him everything . . .”
“It’s being no problem, sir!”
“Mmmmalfoy!” groaned Potter as he jerked within Draco and came. Draco pressed back into Potter’s throbbing swell as his own body began to shake in orgasm. He whimpered around the intense pleasure Potter’s cock gave to him with every weakening thrust. Fuzzy warmth grew from within Draco and soaked the space between them as he milked Potter empty.
Added a chapter due to smut.
“Thank you,” Draco practically moaned as he took a large gulp. He usually drank dry, not dirty ones but at this point he would have settled for gin straight from the bottle. “I can see why you need alcohol around here. Your family is – is – is – “
“No,” Draco said slowly. It wouldn’t be good to crack a smile now and let Harry know how much his jealousy made Draco’s tummy flutter. Draco wouldn’t want Harry to discover too many of Draco’s kinks too fast. Vanilla guy like him might just run off. “It was Luna. I asked her earlier if she could get something for me and she just replied. I had to use my wand to reply back to her.”
Then Potter moved. Just a small, tiny readjustment of his hips. He slid and pressed up into Draco at the same time that Draco sank downward.
He’d spent the past three days tucked away in his potions lab - his “play” room had been easily cleaned out and converted. After he and Linky dumped all his old junk in one of the endless closets, that was. Besides Bear.
Potter had a huge, ugly frown on his face by the time Draco finished.
,” his father spoke firmly, “didn’t your dear cousin get himself killed trying to destroy something much similar? Like Severus said, it is unknown how Potter managed it, but I am guessing it had something to do with the potency of the soul, and the Dark Lord had most-likely been three times stronger when he made this one.”
“Hey,” Harry replied, his voice deliciously husky. “You’re a great dancer.”
Draco couldn’t stop staring at Harry wearing Draco’s modified clothes. Harry was built much differently than Patrick, and the tight jeans and shirt highlighted those differences more than the baggy clothes Harry always wore.
as loud as he could but Theo continued over him-- "I may not know what exactly is going on, but I do know that if Potter's involved then you must be too."
“I did,” Draco smirked.
tell anyone.”
“Are you an animagus?”
Potter was not happy to see Draco, but he was clearly reluctant to show any anger in front of Pomfrey. Instead he stared at Draco, waiting for Draco to explain himself.
"Malfoy . . . he's into what the muggles call BDSM," Harry muttered. "I looked it up online at the library. It's actually kind of . . . respectable - though nothing you should ever try looking up at a public library without privacy charms."
Draco blinked. Rapidly. A few forks clattered against plates. One of them may have been Draco's own fork. Not Zabini's fork though, Draco took care to note. Blaise happily munched on his potatoes. Hmm, Draco was suspicious of the other snake’s intentions of course, but Blaise clearly knew something that Draco was ignorant to. Draco would be a fool not to heed the warning. Draco would not fuck up whatever it was Zabini thought Draco would. That, Draco was sure of.
With that, Draco fell asleep.
“And isn’t this night for Ginny disrememberment?”
“Catch me,” Draco repeated. “So you admit—“
Draco frowned and moved closer to Potter, taking Potter’s hand and lacing their fingers together. Potter became statue like and stared at their entwined body parts. Draco’s heart started to beat faster. Draco was so, so stupid, letting himself grow optimistic after two bloody shags. Of course, Potter had changed his mind. Of course. Of course. Of course.
"Take this to Harry Potter, my black beauty, and give him a good peck for me, would you?"
It was easy for Draco to focus on the good parts of the full feeling in his arse with Harry's hand stroking his cock. Soon enough, the pain faded, and Draco found himself relaxing again. Instead of waiting for Potter to thrust into him, Draco slowly lowered himself a little bit at a time. It still hurt but Draco didn’t have time to be put off, because before he knew it he’d bottomed Harry Potter out, and his stretched-out rim rested against Potter’s wild, untrimmed pubes. God, Draco preened at the thought and had a fleeting urge to comment on what his father would have said about it.
“No. It is a possessed item, or have you forgotten? Who's to say it won't appear right back on Draco's nightstand the second we let it out of my magic’s grasp?"
Draco knew. He did know that silk, his sensitive nipples, and those Potter fingers were going to be a dastardly combination. Draco still hadn’t been prepared for the actual pleasure shooting through his every nerve. Draco became the animal, wildly bucking into Potter’s hard body, at the first tentative touch.
Luna’s voice rang through Draco’s brain over the thumping beat.
“Have you ever brought a date home?”
“That old spell binds magicks, not beings,” his mother said soundly. “It binds the power, not the heart.”
Harry was quiet for a long moment. "Well . . . I may have left out few key points in my rush to explain earlier," he admitted.
“Hello, there,” Potter said. His smile was shy and Draco had a sudden, strange urge to purr like a cat.
Harry choked on his own spit and waved the bartender over. Harry ordered a beer. He’d wanted something a little stronger tonight, but had a feeling he was going to end up carrying Malfoy out of there.
“Harry,” Draco mumbled, not ready to completely give in just yet.
His father only sighed and guided Draco back on the bench. They sat in silence for a moment before his father broke it.
Harry looked like he wanted to say something else, but instead he said, “what kind of drinks?”
this,” Ginny said, even though her voice sounded sad her face seemed happy. “This freedom! I cannot go back to live with my mum. She smothers me!”
Having no luck, Draco pushed down the sick feeling in his gut and stepped. The three Slytherins were tucked away in the black cabinets again. An eerie chill overtook Draco as he processed the room around him. He didn’t think any of the black rooms would ever feel comforting again.
Silence.
of the spell--” Draco’s father tried--while Snape drawled--
“Well . . .” his mother made a get on with it gesture and raised her brows. “You told me you have finally decided on a course of action.”
"I am not."
“Could . . . could we just do it now?” Draco was already losing his nerve. He could take the two potions and try to forget his weakness had ever been tempted. Draco needed to tell Potter now with Pomfrey’s help or he would just end up coming back later with a changed mind. Draco knew himself well enough by now to know this.
“What? No!” protested Draco, and then realized that he’d wasted a perfectly good chance to do just that. “I am only curious, Granger,” he continued in a haughty manner. “I have heard muggles are quite violent, especially while drunk.
Draco closed his eyes as he felt hands tugging off his clothes. He gave weak protests, but was trying to convince himself this was what he’d wanted. Draco had thought he and Potter would talk more but honestly, that had been a high expectation. He wanted everything Potter had to offer. If this was all . . .
Luna caught them with practiced ease and Draco had already flicked his wand toward the kettle. He hadn't a clue how to work the "Stove-top Kenmore 500" yet. He still flew about two feet from the ground when it came to his muggle kitchen, and mastering the oven was his top priority. One day though, Draco was determined to draw back his curtains and let the muggles bask in all his glory.
“What were you hoping to do with this information, Dobby?”
The men glared at her, both having had to obliviate several people for the sake of their forms, Draco knew, he'd read that in the journal they’d given him before first year.
After Draco lifted and sank back down, the smirk was lost, but Draco wasn't sure if Potter had ever seen it anyway. Draco couldn't have said his own name let alone remembered his plan to not let Potter beat him. Draco had no problem, however, saying Potter's name as he couldn't have stopped mumbling it, but this was mostly because Potter was a mess underneath him and it was quite the sight. Draco kept working himself up and down on Potter’s hardness almost absently. It felt so interesting, new, and good . . . and Draco had finally gotten what he wanted. Even as Potter’s hand left his cock to fist in the sheets instead, Draco barely noticed because he was finally learning what was so good about rock hard cocks and having them inside him. Every time Draco moved Potter scratched something inside of Draco that was so much better than an itch.
“Why would you do this?” Potter spat through gritted teeth. “Why? Malfoy, answer me!”
Draco thought of the mountain of clothes, the decanter of gin in his restroom, and the four empty martini glasses strewn about random places that he could not remember. “Move out of the way, Potter,” Draco replied.
Snape sat but still protested, "I did nothing wrong."
“Harry Clifton?” Madam Pomfrey frowned.
“Once, and never will I again . . .” Draco settled in for what was sure to be a truly interesting story.
Snape groaned again at the amused look Dumbledore sent his way. Though Snape could admit it to himself, Harry Potter was certainly very different from his father.
“He’s changed so much,” Ginny muttered, looking after Harry as he leaned against the bar waiting for service. “Physically and mentally.”
It was around this time when Hermione’s day took yet another interesting spin.
There was a knock on the door and Draco froze in his useless pacing. The only person he was expecting a visit from was Pansy - and the bitch certainly wouldn't come knocking.
“I want you in my own way, is that enough for you, lover boy?” Draco smirked.
Hence, Draco sneaking away when Harry was deep in discussion with Ronald. Draco ended up on a stoop that led to a garden. Draco was impatiently keeping track of how long it took Potter to come find him. Sure, being with Harry Potter had a lot of benefits, but Draco wasn’t so desperate to exploit them that he’d let Potter treat him as anything less than a prince.
“I know,” Malfoy smiled. “As far as first times with me go, you’re doing quite well. I know I can be a little . . . much.”
“Harry!” Draco had to shout to be heard. “You wait in line for drinks. I’ll find us a clean table. Ginny!” Draco averted his attention to the awed girl. “You stay in the middle and don’t lose either of us. When Harry has the drinks, lead him to our table!”
"Er--well--Hermione said I should--um--tell you what I think before I--er--askedyousomething."
“How did you know –“ Draco started then said, “you know what? Never mind. I don’t care.”
"You lost me at 'muggles,'" Ron pointed out. When Harry only sighed he forced himself to continue, "Harry . . . I might not be quick on the up-take, but trust me, I will figure out a way for you to get the git back if you are willing to work with me here."
“Look, I don’t exactly know what you want from me, but surely you’re not worried about Harry hurting Malfoy’s feelings, are you?” Hermione asked, worried about exactly the opposite.
“Seriously, Malfoy,” Harry huffed. “You’re on the rebound. It’s a bad idea, you’ll see that in the morning. I’m trying to do you a favor here. Just tell me your address.”
"Lovely," Draco grimaced even as he summoned two purple tea cups from his cupboard.
"I am serious, Draco," Luna continued over him. "You sound like the odd school boy who always wins at marbles."
party. I was thinking charmed-purple peacocks, an ice-sculpture or two, and flaming duck. I know how you love duck--”
A few days had passed since the Coiled-Snake-Incident in the purple potions lab and Draco was grateful for the distraction of Jean arranging an extra lesson for him to attend. Although, when Jean had told him she was taking on another student, Draco had naturally assumed it would be some nameless French witch, like always.
“I need advice from the other father.” Draco heard his own words rather than said them.
"I believe those were extraneous circumstances. You happened to be
“That’s not . . .” Harry trailed off, realizing that Malfoy was probably right. Most of Harry’s previous partners had looked at his cock with disappointment but were squealing by the time Harry was done with them. “Shit. I’m sorry, Malfoy. I didn’t mean to push you so hard.”
“No!” Jamie said. “I’m a sissy, for sure! I can’t imagine losing my package. Though the small tits I’ve grown are quite nice, don’t you think?”
"Like . . . maybe you should just tell him what you think about his outfit? Then maybe he'll be more prone to ending your curiosity, yeah? If he knows you're not looking to tease him about it."
His father had frowned at him for a bit too long, but replied, “You know I will make that happen, son.”
“Suddenly glad I fell in love with another man and never had a chance to create an annoying little creature like you,” quipped Owen, rather quick-witted for a man who was still wiping the drool from his chin.
“Bet if your cute, little pussy disappeared right now you’d beg me to bugger you in the arse.” Potter’s hands finally found Draco’s hips and he slammed into Draco with new strength. “Beg me to fuck you until I cum all inside your—“
“And,” Ginny cut in as Draco and Harry began to glare at one another. “You, Harry, didn’t notice! Hell, we finished off that whole bottle before you came looking.”
Draco nodded. “Do they hurt?”
with Malfoy. Draco wasn’t sure what had come over Potter either, but he found himself liking every second with this new side of the Golden Boy.
--and he sounded genuine as well.
Noticing that both their glasses were already empty, Ginevra summoned a shaker, the fifth of gin, vermouth, and olivebrine. She swiftly caught one item after the next, and then went about mixing a new batch. Draco was impressed with her hand-eye coordination and could easily see how she’d become such a successful athlete.
Malfoy was tight around Harry’s fingers, so tight that Harry was almost scared to push in a third. Okay, he was completely scared. He feared everything that he was doing and everything that was about to happen. Malfoy seemed to be loving everything Harry was doing. Though Harry still felt like he wasn't doing anything right. His teeth kept scraping Malfoy's cock and he hadn't a clue what to do with Malfoy's balls so he just sort of rubbed at them and pushed them aside. It didn't help matters that Harry kept thinking Malfoy must have had better than him before. Malfoy always had better things than Harry.
“Well, I suppose it’s a good thing your hair stopped me. We really should be going.”
it the day I was born!”
Draco shouted at Linky to finish cleaning up and ran to dig through all his old notes boxed under his bed. He found what he was looking for nearly at the bottom. His original list of symbols. He hadn't needed to use it in what felt like years.
Never mind that they were supposed to Ministry regulated. What was Potter going to do, tattle on him?
“We’re all stupid,” Ginny replied with an equally deranged smirk. “I love it. Life just happens, you know. Flows on. Wonderfully. Even the bad stuff.”
"Shh," she chastised him with a serious expression of displeasure and disgust. "You will upset the nargles."
stuff.”
“I see.”
“And that’s what has you all worried.” Hermione sighed, because she saw his point, she truly did, but she also knew better. They had much bigger problems on their hands than Malfoy’s apparently delicate emotions. “Oh . . . this could very well end in disaster, Zabini,” she decided eventually.
“It’s not a story really . . .” Potter started, picking Draco up and carrying him to the bed. “I just . . . before Voldemort died I guess you could say I had a connection to him. I could never be too sure what were actually my own impulses and what were from some of the more horrible dreams I would have. I couldn’t stand to be like him, to act as he would. Now that he’s gone . . . well, it is much easier for me to accept the grey parts of life.”
“To sabotage Harry Potter’s chances of beating me in Quidditch this year.”
His father sounded so peculiar. Draco wanted to crawl under his chair.
Draco had been thinking about someone fucking him open for what seemed like ages. He knew beyond a doubt that he wanted it and that it would be fucking amazing. So Draco was surprised by the intensity of the ripping sting that came along with Potter’s cock, hard as a rock, inside him.
"It . . . it's like the rough stuff," Harry finally met Ron's eyes, defeated. "Like . . . like with paddles and stuff."
Draco groaned. “Don’t remind me,” he said. “I’ve found someone else now. In fact, you just scared him into ordering enough drinks to fuel an army.”
Besides, Draco had never denied that he could be a bit manipulative himself. Patrick, on the other hand, had claimed ignorance in constantly using words to mold Draco’s feelings toward him. Patrick didn’t attend Hogwarts, having moved from America in his late teens, but Draco would bet anything the Sorting Hat would label him Slytherin. Any time Draco would ask Patrick to remove his shirt, Patrick’s huffy mood and self-pitiful words would cause Draco to lose determination. Draco’s parents may have made a few mistakes, but one thing Draco was sure they did right was marrying each other. As his mother had told him when he first started dating Patrick: partnerships are not supposed to make you feel that way.
Snape's life was really a disaster, but in retrospect he should have seen it coming with that white and creamy comment.
“Which is why I have spent the past week . . .
“Did he really though? Are we certain Dumbledore did not give Potter another tool that could aid in controlling soul magic?” Draco’s father smirked wider and wider as he spoke. “Can you not see, Severus? Truly beyond your love of all things redheaded, womanly and weak?” Snape began to growl, but his father continued over the offending noise. “I have put actual thought into this, you know. I did not spend the entirety of the past weeks lollygagging around like a drunken muggle. We have to watch our own backs now more than ever, and there is only one solution I could come up with that will keep the light side from considering this a direct attack on the Potter boy.”
would try and lie to
“Drink up,” Draco grinned widely. “The night has officially begun.”
. . . just the man I was thinking about.”
“Ugh! This conversation is officially over!” he declared and pulled her away to work on body positions.
His father rolled his eyes. “Like she would kill me.”
“Pathetic?” Harry chuckled darkly.
Still, the boy-turned-girl waited another day and spent his next free period sucking Potter’s cock before he even contemplated his sad stroll toward the Hospital Wing. Madam Pomfrey was concerned to see him as an unrecognizable student. By the time Draco had explained his side of the story she was exasperated and wasted no time ushering him to bed for a few quick spells.
"Really?"
"What do I do with them?"
At this time, Harry and Hermione were making their way towards Draco's house. Draco was thinking about the last time he saw Hogwarts. These days, this is what Draco did with most of his free time. Although, it wasn't ideal. When he thinks about Hogwarts, he thinks about the Final Battle. When he thinks about the Final Battle, he thinks about Harry defeating Voldemort. When he thinks about that, he can't stop thinking about the green eyed boy he had bullied all through their time at school.
"What was that?"
"Of course not, Mrs. Malfoy. We only want to know because of Lucius. He is your husband and we didn't know if you had went to see him recently or if anyone had told you anything about him."
The three then fell into an uncomfortable silence, the looming threat of the things about to happen hanging over them like the clouds right before a storm.
"Anything. Just as long as it's not too extreme."
"Tonight we have to whatever I want."
"I helped your dad and the others get out of Azkaban. I need them to make sure my plan works. I need to get all of the Death Eaters into Azkaban so I can 'come back to life.' And the only way I can do this is by having your father and Dolores and Yaxley and Fenrir."
"And I'm trying to make sure my boyfriend makes it home safely." Draco said rudely before pulling Harry out of the club and back to the streets of New York.
"Corvus. Leta. Newt. Newt, Newt, Newt... Scamander! The author of 'Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them'. And his older brother, Theseus Scamander, who was engaged to Leta Lestrange. And, my Granny! They were all alive and around the same age in that time period! Oh my god!"
"You're so needy."
When the boys finally pulled away, they immediately got red, realizing what happened. Although they were embarrassed, they couldn't take their eyes off each other.
"Yeah, okay, Daddy's boy."
"It should be in the next few days. But please don't count on that. The ministry is still getting a lot of things back together so everything is a bit hectic."
There was a table set for two and magical lights hanging from the trees and in the grass.
Draco's POV
"Are you still mad...?"
"Go!" Severus Snape suddenly yelled, Narcissa and himself pulling their wands out and shouting spells at the confused Death Eaters. The Aurors came out of the spots they were so cleverly hidden and started stunning and disarming Death Eaters. Just as The Golden Trip pulled out their wands, Harry saw a familiar blonde haired boy shooting spells at Fenrir Greyback.
OKAY SO BASICALLY WHAT HAPPENED IN THIS CHAPTER IS DRACO SURPRISED HARRY BY MAKING DINNER FOR THEM AND WHEN HARRY WAS TRYING TO CLEAN UP, DRACO KEPT DISTRACTING HIM UNTIL THEY ENDED UP... YA KNOW..... SMUT.....
The girl walked away from Leta.
"Oh, it really was nothing. It kinda helped me too."
Narcissa Malfoy apparated away and left Draco standing in the door. He closed the door and walked back into the living room.
"I told Draco and Harry the plan." Severus said to Narciassa Malfoy.
"Ginny! What are you doing here!?" Ron exclaimed.
"I'm not lying."
"Mhm?"
"Oh. Well, come by anytime. We've all missed your company."
"Thank you, mother."
"I-I don't know."
"You said you'd have me out soon!"
"Ginny!" Hermione scolded.
"Nope. He hasn't done a lot of things. He's never went ice skating. But I already told him we're doing that when it gets cold."
Draco smirked, enjoying seeing Harry become more possessive and dominant.
Ginny chuckled, but really felt worried about the information she had stupidly given away getting out.
"Look, go home. I'll be there as soon as I get done with all of this and we can cuddle as much as you want."
"So, you finally got Potter on your side?" my father asked a few minutes after Harry and my mother entered the trial room.
Draco, not caring that there were people there, wrapped his arms around Harry's waist from behind.
"Okay."
"You can't catch me!" a little girl yelled, running down the stairs and into the living room.
"Draco?" Harry asked, looking concerned.
"There are still Death Eaters out there. And I cannot be truly free until they are all gone. So, I helped them escape so other Death Eaters will think there is still hope for themselves. In reality, we will rally them all together, get them in one spot, I will leak the information, and I will get them all a one way ticket to Azkaban."
"Don't worry." Harry started. "She did research."
Draco hadn't been lying when he said his mom looked sick. She was so frail. It looked like she hadn't eaten in weeks and that she would blow over if the wind blew too hard. She had huge bags under here eyes and here whole face seemed pale.
"I'm fine, Dray. I'm just fine." Harry assured.
"Oh. Well, either way, thank you."
"YOU USED THAT ON HIM!?!" Hermione yelled.
"You don't have to say anything. I'll tell them."
"Here is the food Master requested." Kreacher said. "Kreacher has made fresh bread for an appetizer. Salmon, scallop, and lobster scampi for the main course. And a Strawberry cheesecake for dessert."
"Draco..."
"Here, let me help you."
It had been a few weeks since Harry and Draco had been on their first date. They had gone on a few more, but they weren't official. They had kissed a few more times and they would cuddle a lot, but neither one of them had asked to make things official.
"What?" Draco asked sadly.
Well, what if I told him I can't find you. Then, we could be alone while we 'look' for you."
Harry's ears started to burn.
"Yeah..."
"Get used to it."
"Why do bad things always have to happen to us!?" Harry exclaimed.
"Well, I wouldn't say I fucked him. More like, he fucked me."
"What are we doing in Paris?" Draco asked.
"Yeah, and we need to figure it out soon. Or else we'll basically have another war on our hands."
"That is for them to know! And no one else!" Hermione exclaimed
"Yes?"
"Because I love you. And your dick feels so good up my ass."
"Okay."
"I know. But you have to believe me."
"He seems to be exactly what you need."
While Harry talked, I saw his sadness disappear. The glimmer in his eyes came back and he started talking with his hands again. I smiled when I saw all of his sadness was gone. And, I may be crazy, but I think he noticed. His smile widened as he held eye contact with me.
"Yeah! I'm perfect sober!"
Narrator's POV
"I love water parks!" Draco exclaimed.
Draco pulled away and the two smiled at each other, walking out of the house and joining their kids in the car.
"Draco..."
Harry chuckled at the comment, but agreed.
"Harry, your face is stained with tears and your eyes are not just red, but puffy. You're not fooling anyone with that lie."
"I need what?"
"Yes?"
"Hermione?" Ron said.
"Oh." Draco said sadly. "What'll help?"
"Where are we? It looks so familiar." I said as I looked around.
"What?"
Lucious Malfoy made his son become a death eater the prove to Voldemort that he was committed. He volunteered his son to kill Albus Dumbledore to show Voldemort that he was loyal. His father often threatened and abused not only him but his mother to make sure they did what he wanted.
"Well, it's a good thing you're sitting."
"Malfoy Manner. See if Narcissa Malfoy has seen or heard anything. And talk to Draco too. His father is one of the escaped persons. He could be a person of interest as well."
Everyone looked amused at the boy's threat.
"Yeah. I just need shoes."
Hermione's jaw dropped but she stayed quiet and shook her head. Harry quickly grabbed Ron's arm and apparated to Malfoy Manner. They walked to the door and Harry knocked. It didn't take long for Narcissa to open the door.
"I'm sorry that your ass hurts so bad. It wouldn't be this bad if I had prepped you."
Draco's POV:
Previously
Draco just walked away, leaving a stunned Harry in the kitchen.
The toast came up and it was perfectly golden brown.
Severus suddenly drank what was remaining of his Polyjuice and apparated away.
Draco finally looked away from me and up at the minister.
"Yeah, we know." Ron said, looking up at the magic board they had.
"Because, Potter, I finally decide to move past whatever stupid thing I've had against you for years and be nice. I thought everything was fine. I even invited you to visit me whenever you want. And what do I get? Ignored!"
"Are you sure?"
"How is it going?"
"This was fun! What should we do now?"
"Sorry for, uhh, being rude earlier..."
"Okay!"
I stood up and told my mother that I had somewhere else I needed to be. She understood and didn't stop me from quickly leaving the mannor.
"Shut up." Harry said suddenly. Draco and Hermione looked at Harry questioningly. "Sorry. I'm just really nervous."
Only then did I realize I didn't have my boyfriend in my arms.
"No, it's fine. I like getting fucked senseless by you."
"What did you do?"
They all drew blanks.
"D-dray, i-it hurts." Harry whined.
"Oh, I do too. After seeing him in the battle and how he was on our side, I don't think he's that bad. Yes, he was quite mean to us but overall, I don't think he's a terrible person."
"That was not funny! You could've gotten hurt!"
"Dad!" Lily exclaimed, jumping out of Harry's arms and running to her other father.
"Oh no, you're just fine, Luna!"
"Wait. So you mean to tell me, you have more!?!?"
"Ron, I don't think we're working out. It's not that I don't like you. I just, don't like you romantically. I preferred it when we were friends."
"What?"
"Yes, yes we can."
"Yeah, I know her. That's no problem."
"But if you must know, yes, they have!" Ginny said, still giggling.
"Same here."
"Out to the car, kids. You don't want to be late to King's Cross." Draco said, all three of their kids hurrying out to the house. As Harry tried to follow behind them, Draco grabbed his wrist and pulled him back.
"Hello, Draco."
Narrator's POV:
"Why?" Draco asked.
"I've never broken my promises to you, Harry. I'm not planning on starting now."
"Okay." I said, not believing anything my mother was telling me.
"I look good." Draco said, looking at himself in the mirror.
"Oh my god. I'm surprised he would even think about liking you after that!"
"O-okay." Draco said, a blush covering his face.
"Shut up, you green eyed idiot." Draco mumbled.
"No, not really. I understand. I'll come by sometime."
"How could you not tell me?"
"Could you see us from the house?"
"Are you sure?"
"You think I'm with him!? Are you out of your minds!?"
"What is it, 'Mione?"
"Harry. C'mon. This is crazy."
"So, so we have a deal?"
"Mhm." she said beofre she apparated.
"Go." Harry cried, Draco quickly obliging and thrusting into Harry at a fast but constant speed.
"Tom Riddle's diary. There was a little hollow space in it from where I stabbed it the Basilisk's fang. I gave the book to your dad and he threw it to Dobby. What he didn't know was that I, uh, I might've taken off one of my socks an hid it in the book."
"What was that?" I asked.
"How did he take it?"
"So basically, you're mad."
"Oh. It's really quite easy. We got a tip that there are some Death Eaters roaming around in Knockturn Alley. We're just going to see if it's true so we can actually do something later."
"How in the world did you do that?"
My face got red when I realized that I just said all that to my mother.
Draco's POV:
Draco's POV:
"Oh, okay." he said sadly.
Hermione and Gregory: This one is the most shocking, but Hermione ended up with Goyle. Anyways, Draco's friends started spending more time with Harry's friends and Hermione and Goyle ended up getting pretty close.... Plus they had met before when The Golden Trio got reassigned for a day. Hermione got assigned to Goyle. Anyways, they have two kids, Hugo and Iris. Hugo is 13 and in his third year with Hunter and James. Iris is nine and is not in Hogwarts yet, but will go one year sooner than Rose and Lily.
"Can you make us food?" Draco asked Kreacher.
"You're sure about this?" Ron asked no one in particular.
"B-but you were mad at me. I didn't know if-"
"All right. Is there anyone else who wishes to speak?" the minister asked. There was a few seconds of silence before the minister said, "We shall now vote. All those in favor of clearing all charges from the accused name and setting him free?" I couldn't bring myself to look. "And all those in favor of charging the accused and sending him to Azkaban?" Still, I couldn't look. I kept my eyes on Draco as he stared back at me. "Very well then. Draco Malfoy, you are freed."
"Fuck!" Draco yelled, his voice echoing through Harry's empty house.
"No."
Draco smirked at the boy and kissed down his neck and chest. He paused when he reached Harry's pants. He palmed Harry's length through his pants, earning a small grunt from the boy.
At work the next day, Ron was there. He seemed okay enough, but still slightly off.
"What now?"
Draco found himself losing control and pounding in and out of the boy under him. Harry's moans quickly turned to screams as Draco found his prostate. Draco repositioned himself so he could hit Harry's most sensitive spot every time. Harry's back arched as Draco continuously hit his sweet spot. Both men felt themselves coming close to their highs. As Draco came closer, he pounded harder and harder into Harry, making Harry's screams get louder and nearly become cries. Draco found himself letting out a long, deep moan as he hit his high and came inside of his boyfriend. Harry's eyes rolled back in his head at the feeling of his boyfriend coming inside him. Harry finally let out one final scream and he came all over himself. Draco was quickly to ride him down from his high and pull out, breathing heavily.
"Oh, well, yeah. I love being a seeker."
"Avada Kedavra!" Harry heard Fenrir yell at Draco.
"Did you know?"
"I haven't seen you in awhile." Draco finally said.
"I know."
"I don't understand why you're telling me this." Draco said.
"Draco. Have I ever lead you wrong?"
THERE WILL BE SMUT IN THIS CHAPTER! THERE WILL NOT BE AN ACTUAL WARNING RIGHT BEFORE IT HAPPENS SO JUST SKIP TO THE VERY END OF THE CHAPTER IF YOU DON'T WANT TO READ IT. THERE WILL BE A BRIEF OVERVEIW OF WHAT HAPPENED IN THE CHAPTER
Hermione looked confused, but then noticed the one hickey that was showing.
"Hold on tight and sit up straight."
"You get on my nerves sometimes. Sometimes I can't remember why I started being nice to you."
Hermione quickly apparated out of the Burrow and went to her house. She let out a sigh of relief and smiled at herself in the mirror.
Slowly, Draco stared moving his hips in an attempt to loosen his boyfriend. Harry moaned and whined under his boyfriend.
"My shift doesn't start for another ten minutes. I came early to ask you how your date went."
"Yes."
"Don't sleep in my boyfriend's cabinets anymore."
"What!? You must've been misinformed."
"I never said you had to become perfect at it. And I never said you had to do it now. It's something to work on."
"Yes?"
"I figured you didn't want to see me. You're the one who told me to leave."
"Well, you obviously can't so I have to pick up your slack." Hermione said, with a playful smirk on her face.
"Are we gonna go to it?"
"He said he'd use Veritaserum. Why would he say that, knowing that you could very possibly take him up on that offer, if he was lying?"
"It was our sixth year. In our sixth year, I was focused on hating him."
"Will a trip to the past help?"
"It's honestly okay. He tortured you so, in a way, he had it coming."
"I don't know. Because I'm Harry Potter?"
"Where's the food?"
"It's fine."
Draco smiled at his boyfriend as he glared at the stunned werewolf.
"I-I can't believe I just did that. I-I vowed never to use that spell again. He... Snape is the only one who knows how to reverse it. He-he's gonna die. I just killed him. Oh my god. I can't-"
"It's not my fault you look so damn sexy in that."
"No."
"Hello!" Cho said brightly.
Lucius looked at his son with wide eyes.
"That's not my problem, it's yours. Figure it out."
"I don't know. I don't usually have to do these things."
"How?"
Draco watched the younger slowly get out of bed and waddle over to him. Draco tried not to laugh, but it didn't work.
"No. I just think it's ironic that Hermione came here to ask Harry for help and complained that he was no help, but she took his advice." Draco said.
"What?"
"Are you mad?"
"But-"
"And why is this of any importance? Why are you telling me? Why should I care?"
"Ginny, leave."
"What?" Hermione asked.
"Okay. You don't have to talk about it." Ron said.
"Nothing....?"
"Spaghetti and Meatballs."
"Kreacher!" Harry yelled.
"Yeah. It's not like we can't afford it." Harry joked, earning a small chuckle out of his husband.
"Well?" his father said.
"What are you doing?" Harry asked, scaring Draco.
"Yeah."
"No. When I left I saw you."
When they appeared in Draco's house, Draco immediately felt Harry's lips press against his cheek. Draco pulled Harry closer to him and pressed a kiss to his lips. The two didn't want to pull away, so they deepened the kiss until there was no more room left between them. Harry felt Draco's tongue flick across his bottom lip and he happily let Draco have the entrance. Draco's tongue filled Harry's mouth and the two fought for dominance. Rather quickly, Harry decided to give up, letting Draco explore every crevice of his mouth. Draco slowly started to pull out of the kiss. Draco bit down on Harry's bottom lip, causing Harry to let out a small whimper. Draco smirked as he started trailing kisses down Harry's jawline and neck. Draco started leaving hickeys along Harry's neck. Harry quietly whimpered as Draco sucked along his neck, feeling his bulge grow in his pants.
Harry let out loud moans as Draco continued thrusting into him at the same speed, the sounds of moans and skin slapping filling the room. Just as Harry felt his orgasm coming on again, Draco pulled out of him.
"Draco, I'm serious."
After a few thrusts to his prostate, Harry couldn't keep going. His legs started to shake from the effort he was putting in. Draco noticed this and switched their positions once more, Harry's ass now in the air as Draco thrust into him from behind.
" I know. But you're always cooking and working and teaching me about the muggle world. I wanted to do something for you."
"I know." Draco said as he snaked his arm around Harry's waist and pulled the smaller boy onto him.
"N-nothing." Harry said, stumbling closer to Draco.
"It's okay, Dray." Harry said, moving one of his hands back to find Draco's. Draco happily took his boyfriend's hand and squeezed it.
"I knew that they liked each other. And I knew that they had been going out on dates. I didn't know that this was going to happen, though."
"It was only an hour." Harry said.
"Okay." Ron said
Narrator's POV
"I just had to run something by him for work."
"Sure. Whatever you want, mate."
Draco grabbed Harry's messy brown hair and pulled him up, Harry's back pressing against Draco's chest as Draco thrust into Harry, still hitting his prostate.
"You slept on the couch...?"
The Golden Trio got to their floor and made their way to Kingsley's office. They found the door already open so they walked right in.
"Tell that to my butt."
"What's a bike?" Ron asked.
"I don't really know."
Draco pulled Harry's jeans off of his body, sending goosebumps down Harry's body. Draco straddled Harry and pulled his shirt off of his body, tracing his fingers over Harry's defined abs. Harry tried to move his hands to pull Draco's shirt off, but his hands stayed glued to their spot.
Harry quickly aligned himself with Draco, sitting onto his boyfriend's length. Harry and Draco both moaned as Harry started to bounce on Draco, spreading his legs even further so he could get deeper. After he did this, Draco hit his prostate, Harry crying out in immense pleasure.   Draco started thrusting his hips to match Harry, hitting his prostate dead on every time.
"Draco and I went on a date."
"Something fancy."
"Do they know anything?" Severus asked.
"Go put on a t-shirt."
Through it all, he lost Lupin, Tonks, Snape, Fred, Hedwig, Cedric, Sirius, Dumbledore, and Dobby, he fell in love, and he killed the man that killed his parents all those years ago.
"I'm just hugging my boyfriend."
"What do you mean?"
"This is sweet and all, but can one of you stun this stupid Death Eater!?" Hermione yelled, Harry throwing a quick stunning spell at the Death Eater.
"Hi." Dracco responded weakly.
All of us are smart individuals, so tell me, does that really make any sense? I've said all I need to say. The power is in your hands. I just beg that you make the smart choice. There is one quote that I like. It goes something like this; 'The right choice isn't always the easiest. This is why so many people make the wrong decision.' With that, I leave you to make your decision."
"Beat these together until the whites and the yolks are completely combined."
"He's not that bad. He was just under a lot of pressure."
But on the inside, Ron was dying. He actually really like Hermione. And Hermione, she didn't feel the same for him. It hurt him a lot more than he was willing to admit.
"She is being serious. Harry's dating Draco. They've been together for a decent amount of time, now. They started talking almost directly after the war." Hermione said.
"How is Draco?"
"How long?" she asked.
"I told you, I didn't forget. I wanted to talk to him first."
One short car ride later, the family arrived at King's Cross, walking quickly through the train station and onto Platfrom 9 3/4.
Draco sighed and brought his hand to Harry's head and ran his fingers through his hair. He lifted Harry's face enough for him to be able to kiss his forehead. Draco continued to do this until he didn't hear anymore sobs coming from his boyfriend. Slowly, Draco lifted Harry's face all the way up.
"Sit, I made bangers and mash. I know how much you love it."
"Is there anything else you wanna do?"
"How do I do that?"
"I don't know. I could do either. Draco just kinda, took the initiative, I guess. Can we not talk about this?"
"Oh my god!! Why did that take so long!?!"  I whined.
"Good moring, Dray."
"Draco, that's not what I meant."
"Thank you. You can put the food on the table. I'll summon you back if we need you."
Harry giggled at his boyfriends cuteness and took the lock. He quickly attached it to the bridge and looked back at Draco
"What are you doing?" Draco asked.
I slowly started to pull Harry into a hug. When he didn't protest, I pulled him into my chest. I held him there as he cried into my shirt. I whispered nice things in his ear so he would feel better. Soon enough, I felt him pulling out of my grip. I let him out of my arms. I was a little upset. I liked the way it felt. Having him in my arms.
"What, were you with someone smarter than you?" Harry teased.
"Hermione, give me your brain."
"It's Peter Pettigrew! He's supposed to be dead!" an Auror that annoyed Harry yelled.
"A few days ago, actually. Being an Auror really isn't all it's cut out to be."
"I'll see you tomorrow, Draco."
Draco bit Harry's lower lip, Harry happily opening his mouth to give Draco the entrance he desired. Draco's tongue felt every crevice of Harry's mouth before finally colliding with Harry's tongue, the two fighting for dominance, Draco winning.
"I love you, Harry. I would never do anything that could hurt us. I promise you, I have nothing to do with this."
"Yeah! Hermione, how are you and Ron?" Katie asked
"Really? Where to?"
"Really?"
"Use your brain."
"Not yet. I've been practicing like you told me to."
"I-I just c-can't help i-it."
"Know what, I don't need to explain myself to you. It's not like I'm asking your permisson to be friends with him. Think what you want, Ron."
"Because, I wanted to take you out on a real date. Not just random things in the muggle world. A date. Where we can be us and as gay and lovey dovey as we want."
"Oh, yeah." I said, noticing that she had barely touched her plate. She still had food piled on it. I eyed my mom warily before taking a deep breath. "Are you okay, mom?" I asked.
"But how?"
"What's wrong?" he asked
"How long what?"
"Was the invisibility cloak there?"
"That was not my fault! You decided to be a hard-headed prick and not let me help you."
"You don't have to say anything. I'll tell them."
"Okay. Just, let me know as soon as you can."
When the two of them were away from all the muggles, they apparated back to Draco's house.
"You need to help me, mate!"
"How do you know?" I asked as Draco finally pulled me up and put his arms around me.
"Harry, are you actually mad at me?" Draco asked, a hint of worry in his voice.
"Someone was quiet touchy with their boyfriend." Herimone teased.
Hermione stood silently in the door way.
"I don't. But Sirius left him for me. And he's kinda a dick so, I don't mind making him suffer."
Draco pulled away from Harry long enough to push himself inside the younger. Harry whimpered, his ass hurting from Draco pushing into him raw.
"Because, I know you are now affiliated with Harry Potter. He needs to know this information, but I'm not quite sure what he'd do if he just saw me. I'm hoping-"
"They still know nothing more than they've known the whole time." Wormtail replied.
"What do you mean?"
-Lucius Malfoy, Fenrir Greyback, Dolores Umbridge and Corban Yaxely escaped from Azkban
Harry crossed his arms and pouted.
"Well, I don't know where he is." I said, ignoring Ginny.
"What did your mom want?"
"He's been moping around the burrow for days now!" Ginny exclaimed
She spun the time turner in the opposite direction. I watched as time went forward and I started recognizing things. Before I knew it, we were back where we had left off.
"You like that?" Draco whispered.
"Alright. Then I bet 3 Galleons that he messes up but 'Mione doesn't mind and everything goes according to plan."
Narrator's POV
"Yeah?"
Narrator's POV
Harry Potter was a changed man.
"If you are implying that you think I had something to do with this-"
Draco just continued laughing and helped Harry put clothes on. When he was done, Draco picked up his boyfriend and carried him into the kitchen. Draco set the boy down on a counter and opened the cabinet with the house elf in it.
"D-Drayy!" Harry moaned as Draco flipped them over, making himself top.
Draco pushed Harry against a wall and started to unbutton the top few buttons of his shirt. Draco placed his lips on the bit of exposed skin on Harry's chest. He left a few marks on the brunette before pulling his lips off of the boy.
"So what is Snape's real plan?" Hermione asked once they sat down in The Three Broomsticks.
James ran up the stairs and left Draco and Harry alone with Lily.
"Paris. They have their own amazing world. You can go to a café and walk around in the city of love."
So when a worried looking Cho apparated into Hermione's office, Hermione felt confused.
"I'm sorry. I'm going to do everything I can to keep you and your parents out of that place."
"What? Why?"
"Oh. I, uh, maybe."
"We were only kidding." Harry sasid.
I walked through Malfoy manner until I reached the huge dining room. My mom already sat in the room with a plate of food in front of her. She smiled when she saw me.
"What do you know so far?" Hermione asked.
Harry left Draco's room. He returned a few minutes later wearing a light blue button up shirt that was fitted and black jeans with white shoes.
Harry gave Ron an encouraging smile before Ron apparated away.
"He doesn't accept it. He doesn't want to be friends." I whispered with tears welling back up in my eyes.
"Ron could learn a thing or two from this."
The three of us silently stepped inside the house. Ron motioned for Ginny to stay on the main floor while we went up the stairs.
I took a deep breath before twisting the door handle and opening the door.
"Of course I am, I had to see you and Aurora when you leave for Hogwarts."
"Look."
"So, we can start moving on to the next phase?"
"How ever long you want."
"If it makes you feel any better," Hermione started. "I got really annoyed and told him that I'm part Malfoy."
One Week Later
"I never want to have raw sex again." he complained.
"He was bottom!!" Ron laughed.
"Perfect?"
Harry's POV:
"Draco, that was not needed."
"Well I wish me and Aurora could switch places."
"As in Severus Snape?"
"Yes, yes it is!" Harry said, laughing.
"Sorry. I'm curious."
"Well, everywhere we go is in the muggle world. We've gone to the zoo, we went to the beach, and I taught him how to ride a bike."
"Yeah. Think about it like this, Draco probably doesn't want to do it either. If he brings us, he'll have an excuse to not really talk to them."
"Yeah?"
Ron unlocked the door and motioned for us to be quiet.
Draco just sat and cuddled closer to Harry, enjoying the younger's company.
"What took you so long?" Lily asked.
"Yes, Draco."
"I hate you."
"An hour that I could've been at home thinking."
"Answer, Draco."
"Yes, sir?" he asked.
"Sure. Come in."
Draco shoved Harry off of him and smirked.
"She is doing well."
"That does sound good right now."
As the two got in the elevator to see Kingsley, Hermione saw them and joined them.
Narrator's POV
"For as cute a you two really are," Hermione started, causing the boys the jump. "can you not do this here?"
While I put jam on the toast, Harry finished the eggs. He giggled when he saw me.
"I promise. But right now, I really need to work. As soon as I'm done I'll be home."
"Is he really taking it this hard?"
"Oh, yes." Hermione started. "During the battle, I found a time-turner. After it was over, I took it to Harry. We decided-"
Before the argument could go on any further, Harry returned with my mother.
"I'm gonna be so sore tomorrow." Harry said.
Draco looked his boyfriend up and down, licking his lips.
"It looks dangerous."
"Okay so they could do it next to us. We could turn it into a group experience."
Draco chuckled as he put his lips on mine and softly kissed them.
"So this is the breakthough we've been waiting for!"
I watched Harry as prepped everything. He cracked the eggs into a bowl and looked at me.
"Before school starts. Remember, Luna and I still have our last year." Ginny said.
Without waiting for a response, Harry apparated to his house. He was surprised to smell something amazing from the kitchen. He walked towards the room and saw Draco squinting his eyes in concentration, stirring something in a pot.
"Well, well, well. If it isn't Harry Potter. The reason I got thrown in Azkaban." Lucius Malfoy sneered.
Draco felt confused as he watch Harry dance with the other guy. The guy's crotch was against Harry's ass and they were both looking aroused. As Draco slowly walked closer, he could make out small grunts and moans coming from both of them as they continued to dance. When Draco got close enough to Harry, Harry noticed him.
"That was fun!" he said.
"That's the craziest thing I've ever heard." Harry said.
They then looked at Ginny again.
"I know." I said, chuckling at how right the blonde was.
"You're here!" his mom yelled back, appearing from behind a table. "With friends?"
Then, a scream was heard.
"Come on! I want cuddles!"
"Because I want to."
"Then go to sleep, Scarhead."
Harry, now the one not caring about their audience, pressed a sweet, tender kiss to Draco's lips.
I took a deep breath before twisting the door handle and opening the door.
"So what, we have to go to Azkaban to see what is going on?" Ron asked.
Draco started laughing. "Th-that'll t-teach y-you to be r-r-rude!!" he said between laughs.
I watched and listened in awe as Harry explained each of his years at Hogwarts. I almost lost it when I found out he and Weasley used Polyjuice Potion and tricked me in our second year. But I couldn't stay mad. When I saw the worry in his eyes and he touched my hand, I felt all of my anger slip away.
"That is for you to find out later."
Harry quickly put on the shoes and laced them. Draco, taking longer as he was trying to figure out what he was doing.
"So, what does that mean?"
"What did I just watch?" Ron asked.
Draco smiled and put his arms back around me. I put my arms around his torso and burried my head in his chest, taking in his scent.
When Harry and Ron finally walked into the hallway, they ran right into Draco. Ron walked around the blonde, but Harry and Draco stared at each other for some time.
"Are you gonna call me Scarhead from now on?"
"I know."
"You're scared of my family."
"I don't know. A library?" Harry joked.
Harry laughed at Draco as the eighth piece of burnt toast came out of the toaster.
"What's wrong?" Draco asked worried.
"Can we cuddle?"
"Flustered?" Draco said mockingly.
"I'm not dark. He's just always been rude to me and Ron and Hermione. I feel like by keeping him I can silently rub it in his face that he's stuck with this life."
He thought about his first, and only, love. He though about all the times his love crossed his mind. He thought about what he would do if anyone found out. What he would if they saw each other. If someone said the name. Mentioned the family. Looked familiar.
Seeing as Harry was on top, he could choose when he started pleasuring himself. After a few more minutes of making out, Harry started to thrust his hips. Draco grunted as Harry continued this motion.
"You said you love making potions but you didn't say that about being a seeker."
"Well, I'm not sure how to start this." Harry said, fiddling with his hands. "We can't go out tonight. Or tomorrow. Or any time."
"I love you, Harry. I love you so damn much. It hurts how much I love you. It hurts me to see you hurt, It hurts me to see you worry. It hurts me to see you anything other than happy. I've never felt like this for anyone else. Never. You need to realize that this is how I feel and nothing is changing that."
"If anything happens to you, I'm going to kill you." Harry threatened once they reached Ron and Hermione.
"W-what? No!"
"Draco!!" Harry yelled, loud enough for Ron and Hermione to hear from their spot in the distance.
Harry, Draco, and Hermione all pulled out their wands and Narcissa smiled.
Draco quickly spread his boyfriend legs open and lined himself up. Knowing how tight he would be, Draco slowly pushed himself into Harry. Harry couldn't suppress the groan that came out of his mouth. He felt so much pain in his ass, he wasn't sure that he would be able to find it pleasureable.
"But look at my boyfriend! He's too cute not to cuddle!" Draco whined, causing Harry's face to burn pink.
"What on Earth are you talking about?"
"Now leave, Wormtail. Before you're caught."
"You're crazy."
I walked up to the Burrow and took a deep breath. I knocked on the door and nervously waited for a response. To my relief, Molly opened the door.
"Please. I wouldn't mind at all."
"Well, I don't know. I just wanted to know if you thought it was a good idea."
Draco quickly walked to his room and threw open his closet. Harry stood there looking at everything before pulling out an outfit and handing it to his boyfriend.
"Like what?"
Draco pulled Harry so Harry was now resting with his head in Draco's lap. Draco started playing with the dark haired male's already messy hair, knowing this helped calm him down.
"Do you know how worried I was?"
"He's done so much shit!" Draco said, feeling tears sting at the back of his eyes. "He made become a death eater so the Dark Lord would trust him. He volunteered me to kill Dumbledore so the Dark Lord would know he was completely loyal. He forced my mom to go back after he rose again. He threatened and abused us so much. I just, things will be less... I don't know how to explain it."
Harry's POV:
"Right!!"
"Not be my messanger, just simply help me tell him in hopes that he will have a more open mind."
Draco stood frozen after Harry left.
Draco just looked at Harry, shocked.
"It's just, something happened to one of Harry's friends from school. And, we're kind of worried about it. It's hard to explain. But we both think it would be best if we were together as much as possible. Decreases the chances of something happening to either one of us."
"Stop being such a hard-headed prick."
After a second, Harry had completely gotten the hang of it. Draco, on the other hand, had already fallen.
"We can't talk about this here. Let's go get some food and talk there." Ron said, standing up.
Draco's POV
"Yes."
Harry got their roller skates. He handed a pair to Draco and stood their, looking dumbfounded.
"Harry, if I'm horny, I'm making you do something about it. I'm not gonna touch myself when I have a perfectly good boyfriend."
Draco woke up before Harry did the next morning. Draco watched his boyfriend as he peacefully slept next to him. Draco placed a quick kiss to his boyfriend's temple before getting out of the bed. He put on some clothes and walked to the kitchen. He opened a cabinet and was shocked to see a house elf sleeping in it.
Hermione dragged them to a more private area of the park.
"It's not working."
"Really?"
Narrator's POV:
"Fine." Draco said, hesitantly letting go of his boyfriend's waist.
"Harry?" I said as I stepped inside.
"Come on. It'll be fun."
"Harry..."
"What?"
"None taken."
"Oh, yes. I have heard about that."
"Is this all we do? Just sit?"
Two Weeks Later
Draco's POV
"He's a keeper." Hermione said to Harry, making Harry blush as well.
Draco let himself fall on top of his boyfriend. The two panted as they laid together, Draco on top of Harry.
"I came to see Harry."
"Ummm...." I said feeling more lost that I usually am when I talk to Hermione.
"Yes. Definitely."
Harry smiled when he noticed Draco wearing a t-shirt.
Harry groaned in reply. “Come on, Draco,” Harry pleaded. “You’re so hot, and perfect, and I’m hardly random dick, am I right?”
“Like you plan to let me go any time soon?” Draco said, half hopeful. Potter hadn’t let him go two days without a fuck since they’d started this ordeal.
handle the stretching and other basics. For
“Just an up and coming DJ everyone’s been raving about,” Eddy said, as he stepped aside and let them through. “Have fun, Draco! Hope to see you around here more!”
“We need only look at the fault in Severus’ initial resolution to determine what we have to do,” his father explained, even though Draco had the feeling his mother was now ten steps ahead all on her own. “There is only one way to ensure the Gryffindors do not disregard it or do as he would have done and chucked it into the high sea - or,” here his father paused to chuckle, “Gods forbid, simply attempted to break its curse.”
