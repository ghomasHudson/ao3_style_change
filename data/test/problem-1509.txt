Granger looked like she was thinking. It didn’t look the same as when Harry was thinking - he looked like he was leafing through folders in his memory, one page at a time, squinting as he got closer to the right one. But Granger, she looked like she had a few libraries in there instead of a single file cabinet.
“Hmm… Yeah. You’re right.” Harry exaggeratedly looked at the ceiling, trying to appear contemplative. “Maybe you should ask
"Well, I'm not going to pretend that isn't on my to do-list," Harry admitted, making Draco laugh, "but there's more to it than just that."
“It was worse last time I was here," Draco said. He had changed out of his uniform after Magical Injury, and was wearing Adidas joggers and a black longsleeve that fit him just well enough that Harry couldn't look at him for a very long time without his thoughts straying.
Often Draco was tempted to guilt Harry about being away so much, but even more often he found himself unable to. There was something about a feeling of urgency and threat that seemed to bring Harry alive somehow. The mental struggles he had faced during their time at Darthorn were now far in the past, and unfortunately some of Harry’s transparency had disappeared with them. It was a trait Draco had found very attractive about him. The way his temper riled up, or his smile when he was happy, even his panic. He had lived on extremes, that boy. But he was twenty-seven years old now, and he had learned to self-regulate. Or perhaps it just wasn’t Draco who got to see that side of him, now. Maybe it was the other Aurors or the criminals Harry chased or Ron, whenever the two of them met up for pints after Ron had won an important game. Either way, it was Draco who got the worn-down Harry, the mildly stressed Harry, the content but not beaming-Harry. And maybe that was for the best.
“You really thought I’d let you off easy after what you pulled earlier?” While Harry pulled back to say that, he ran his finger just around the tip of Draco’s cock - Merlin, that was
“See, I’m not for earwigging personally, but since I happened to overhear that conversation between you and Malfoy a couple days ago, Dean and I figured-”
“Oh, so that was just, a very friendly snogging I just walked in on? Or did he give you a love potion or something?”
“Oh, I think you heard me just fine," Theodore said, standing up. He was as tall as Ron, although he didn’t look very intimidating. Harry’s arms were easily twice the diameter of his.
“Cock," Seamus then said without blinking. Harry frowned and smiled at the same time, not really knowing how to react.
He started to feel uneasy. He wanted to go back to the tent on the quidditch field but didn't know how. Clearly there was something in this vision he had to fight or figure out, but what was it? He had already died in the most unsatisfying way he could have possibly came up with.
Narcissa's tears start falling again. She can't accept it, she knows this much already. And Draco must know it too, because there is little hopefulness in his words about visiting and welcoming.
was a Muggle prison in Moscow that hid under it one of the most high-security wizard prisons in the world.
After the waves settled, they lay there for a moment, foreheads pressed together, breathing each other's air as they caught breath. They were a little sweaty in euphoria that went beyond words, just jadedly looking at each other. Harry smiled, and Draco gave a chuckle. Draco wasn't wrong in laughing: it really was kind of ridiculous, unbelievable that they, out of all people, had just had sex.
“There’s nothing brave about torturing spiders," Harry said. ”I saw you in the mirror. Voldemort had killed me the previous night, and he - I
Harry decided to go see if Dean was in his room. He was an art major and into men in more ways than just aesthetic, so surely he wouldn’t think Harry was out of his mind for thinking Draco was kind of… bewitching to look at? Harry passed through the hallway and knocked on Dean’s door. He heard the sound of someone getting out of bed, but it was Seamus instead of Dean that opened the door. He was in sweatpants and a T-shirt and essentially looked like he was enjoying a day of doing absolutely nothing.
"What, you mean sneaking out to give each other handjobs in broom closets?" Harry said, grinning. He was more amused by Ron's reaction than the situation itself. In fact, he had suspected Dean was gay during their last couple years at Hogwarts but he had never paid much attention to the matter with the whole, saving the wizarding world business going on.
“I wouldn’t go against your supervisor if I were you,” Percy said. “Why do you even insist on taking care of this yourself? If Spencer knew that father gave you the Malfoy file-”
“This is not of importance. Go now, and tell Mr. Weasley that I am expecting him. He is late for his exam, and I would not have the mirror left in the hands of my assistants for longer than is necessary.”
always jealous of Adrik. Tired of living in his big brother's shadow… I reckon that's why he really went to Great Britain, to make something of himself." The woman chuckled again. "And how did that turn out?
Neville was clearly on his way back from class. His knees were stained with dirt, and his sleeves were rolled up, revealing arms dotted by small cuts from the thorns of the magical roses he was tending to at the college greenhouse. Yes, he had told Draco about them, and just about everyone else too who would listen. His eyes settled on Harry and Draco. He looked at them, then at the bee. Then back at them.
Mr. and Mrs.Weasley were proud to say that they were not only the parents of the famous Weasley twins of Diagon Alley, but also of a daughter playing chaser for the Holyhead Harpies and a son in the Auror training programme at Darthorn College, thank you very much. They had never been so proud of Ron, and the young man was regurarly reminded of this by little baskets of muffins and scones that his poor owl valiantly delivered to the dormitory every Monday. The basket always came with a note that contained some variation of the following: your father and I are so proud, send hugs to Hermione and Harry, aunt/cousin/father's colleague so and so asked about you and was absolutely thrilled to hear about the programme, don't you dare eat all of these yourself, please write to us soon, your father and I are so proud.
“Probably while you and I were…” Ron fell silent, clenching his jaw like he often did when he was nervous. “I haven’t seen Hermione since then but, Dean told me. He said he saw them talking when he was on his way back from Visual Charms.”
The Muggle houses started to blow up, one by one. Draco watched, horrified, as fire and smoke devoured the city. It was his fault, it must've been his fault, he was always thinking about how awful Muggle architecture was - and then he jolted awake and realized someone was banging on the door.
“And it never made sense, not even in the beginning. All the things I had been taught about how the world worked, how I was special and my family was better than other families, and how money and reputation were all that really mattered in the end… Ever since I started going to Hogwarts I became more and more confused by it. Because I knew- I saw it happening, I saw how completely and utterly wrong my father was, but I just couldn’t… Because that would have meant he lied to me, and no one wants to think their father lies to them. And at some point I realized he was lying to himself too, and I started noticing how weak he really was and I was terrified, because before that he had been…” There was a tremble in Draco’s voice. “He had been my hero, you know? And sure he beat me and screamed at me and made me feel like shit about every little thing, but it was all alright until I realized it wasn’t.”
… A shame, really. If he had stayed in the motherland, he could have had potential." She deeply inhaled from her cigarette again, now in a considerably more cheerful mood.
Hermione looked up from the newspaper and raised her other eyebrow in a way that made Harry quickly gulp down the rest of his tea, get up and go to his room. He could still hear the rest of the conversation.
“And what if I do?” Harry said, giving Draco’s teasing his best challenge. That was clearly enough to drive Draco over an edge. Something in his eyes turned hazy, too far in to focus anymore, and he pushed Harry back against the wall. He was so close Harry could feel his hot breathing on his lips.
“Yes," Granger said. “He said you wouldn’t call me a mudblood anymore, and I want to believe him. Some people may think everything is black and white, that there are good people and bad people and that’s it, but I’m not one of those people.”
“Don’t distract me," Draco said. "This isn't your fault and if I'm being honest, I wouldn't give a damn even if it was. I don't care what they write. I have nothing to lose at this point."
Harry’s heart was still racing from what had happened when he made it into the sixth floor of the dorms building. He found himself secretly hoping that he’d be the first to be back from classes so he could lock himself in his room and maybe release some pressure.
"He worked hard to raise himself differently. He made some friends, even fell in love at some point, perhaps - and no, the world was not kind to him, as is often the case with kind people. But I don't believe that he regretted for a moment that he lived on his own conditions instead of someone else's."
“Well, we were actually looking to interview a nurse," Harry said. “We just think they’re the most underappreciated people in the whole, uh, society right now. Unsung heroes, isn’t that right, Draco?” Harry flashed a confident smile at Draco, who was staring at the ceiling impatiently.
“What’s there to talk about? He kissed me first, Granger - I didn’t give him force him to do it or give him a love potion or blackmail him into it - he kissed
“He isn’t… doing so well with school," Harry said, his smile fading. “I had to help him with Charms last week.”
“Oh, yes, it’s all in there,” Gwen said, handing Harry a file with the familiar Ministry emblem. “I interviewed everyone present before you arrived, so you should find all the basics in there.”
"Holy shit that's cold-" Harry blurted as his body jerked in reaction. Cold or not, it felt good, way too good to have Draco's hand around his cock like that with no fabric in between, skin on skin.
“I know worse," Draco said. “But better? No. Now, remind me again - why is it that you think it’s any of your business who I spend my time with?”
Draco then read the quote to Harry, who at this point was staring at the young man, experiencing waves of euphoria that he suspected were side effects of utterly, irreversibly,
Had everything gone according to plan, the Christmas six years later would’ve been similar. Harry and Draco had agreed to be at the Burrow at five - an optimistic estimate considering Harry usually got home from the Ministry at half past, but Draco was hopeful. He had to be, because today Hermione was finally going to reveal to everyone that she was pregnant, and Draco was anxious to be there and see everyone's reaction.
Harry learns a few things about sex that his teachers at Hogwarts had failed to mention. He also finds himself accommodating two unexpected visitors, and it turns out Theodore Nott isn't the only one who read the article about Harry and Draco on the Daily Prophet...
Hey guys! Just quickly letting you know that I've started at a new job, so it may take a bit longer than usual for the next chapter to be published. I want to take my time with that one since something quite special happens in it... ;)
Neville handed him a gray rag that Draco suspected represented a tissue. He nodded as thanks, not really knowing what else to do.
“I’m not sure you want to know," Draco said. “Now, I think you’d better be on your way before I make such a fool of you that you’ll never want to show your face again, not even in Moscow.”
Harry glanced at Malfoy again. It was strange to be the one answering questions instead of firing them at him.
reflecting from his eyes giving them a fierce glow. “I’m not taking an apology from you. You had every right to use that spell. I deserved it.”
“I don’t get it," Draco said, still staring at the card. “This is Luna Lovegood, right? The girl who was… They were keeping her and Mr. Ollivander downstairs. Why would she address the card to you
Neville was quiet for a while. Apparently something very distracting was going on where his feet were.
“Ah, probably around the fourth time Dean and I had made out," Seamus said. He made a smug face. “You thinking of hopping over to the dark side?”
Draco pulled Harry closer with the leg that was hooked around Harry's lower back, and with his hand, guided Harry inside him. The sensation silenced both of them for a second - Draco was hot and slick and so tight around him that Harry's toes curled and a groan escaped him.
“Apparently headmaster McGonagall had invited both of them there to discuss teaching positions,” Arthur said. “They still haven’t found a competent Defence Against the Dark Arts professor, and the Scamander boy was there to discuss the Magizoology post.”
"What don't I understand?" Narcissa says encouragingly, hoping that by being gentle she could bring Draco's mind back to the good times they have shared together.
“I hope not," Harry said but decided it was best to keep to himself what he really thought was going to happen. He decided to change the subject, although what he had in mind wasn’t exactly less uneasy than Ron’s poor success in the AT programme.
“Blimey, you scared me,” Longbottom said as he stepped out of the door. He was wearing an apron and was drying his hands on it. Blue stains were left behind on the fabric, but that gave Draco no clue as to what he had been up to.
“No, Mr. Malfoy, such is not the case. I did not introduce this mirror to Mr. Potter without the intention of teaching him how to overcome its horrors, should that be what he still wants after what he has seen today.” The professor was looking up at Draco. She was so short she probably couldn’t have reached the top of Draco’s head with her hand. “I can tell that you care for Mr. Potter deeply, and I would have you understand I am operating under the particularly close watch of the Auror Department. They are - how do you say - most
" Draco replied with the formal hello as he wasn't sure what else to say. It had been many years since they had last met and had it been for Draco to choose, he could have happily lived the rest of his life without ever speaking with the hag again.
Harry briefly considered punching Theo, but then, he was also Draco’s friend. Or at least had been at some point. And it wasn’t like punching him would have made him any less of a jerk. Then again, a jerk with a bruise tended to be a quiet jerk… But also, maybe this just was how Slytherins spoke to each other? Then again, this wasn’t Hogwarts and Harry wasn’t a Slytherin.
Draco felt the blood escape his face as he came to the realization that he was looking at Harry Potter, and that this was his room.
“Greenhouses are always in season,” Neville said. “That’s what I like about them. But you’re not the first one to wonder about it. That Professor Toadsworth was interested in it, too.”
“Ah, no,” she said. “That would be Mr. Slughorn. I’m his apprentice until he retires. However, right now he’s in bed with a cold, so right now it can be said I’m the Potions Master. What is your name?”
"Good, good," Skepperus said and started walking back to the front of the classroom, talking as he went. "Next week we will start our short delve into the healing practice of muggles. It's not in the curriculum, but I find that knowing the basics can be very useful to magic-users, should they find themselves in a tricky situation with no wand at hand."
“Oh damn, he really do be looking kinda gay," he then said to Seamus who was leaning on to the doorframe, clearly pleased with himself.
“Can’t really complain," Harry said. “I mean, it’s kind of draining every drop of energy out of me but I’m also just really lucky to be there.”
“We wanted to find out if you were the heir of Slytherin," Harry said. “We chatted with you for a bit, but then you said you didn’t know who the heir was, and the next thing I know you’re calling Hermione the m-word and I have to physically stop Ron from punching you into the next morning so, yeah. It didn’t go very well. Hermione turned into a cat, too. Well, her face did anyway. She spent quite a chunk of that year at the hospital wing, come to think of it.”
Draco hadn't even finished shifting his weight from one foot to the other before Harry had captured him in a sudden hug.
“He’s locked himself in his room - professor Toadsworth tried to get him to go to the school healer but he wouldn’t, and I don’t really know what happened to him - Toadsworth had only just gotten him out of that mirror when I saw him -”
What was it with these Gryffindors and their constant need to apologize when there was obviously no reason to? Draco knew exactly why she wanted to talk about Harry, and that wasn’t a conversation he was looking forward to.
The walls of Skepperus’ office were lined with bookshelves, each of them jam-packed full of books that looked about as ancient as the man himself. Apart from the writing desk that stood in the middle of the room, and a narrow closet in the corner that looked like it probably contained extra robes, there was no other hiding place for the notebook.
kiss back… He was a bit taller than Harry was, and now that Harry really put some thought into it, he realized he probably would get pinned against a wall or something.
“She told me about them in year seven, when we went back to Hogwarts," Draco said. “That was the first time I’d seen them, and I quickly realized not everyone did. She must have seen me staring at the carriages or something, because a couple of days later I was sitting by the lake feeling sorry for myself when she walked up to me. I got scared shitless since I hadn’t heard anyone coming, but she just sat down and started talking about thestrals and how she could see them too. To be honest I didn’t know what the fuck was going on, because I knew she was in Dumbledore’s Army and it didn’t really make sense for her to talk to me.”
“We’ll take a right at Paddington Station”, Harry said. “You reckon we’ll be seeing any little bears with red hats running about?”
“Ah it’s too late now, you didn’t pass the test," Seamus said, still not breaking his what Harry really hoped was a just an insanely good poker face, and went into the hallway. “Dean? Ah it is you, good. Get your perky ass over here, we got a C-69 with some serious denial issues.”
“It’s nothing really," Neville said, “or at least, not as if it’s any of my business, but… Why was Draco Malfoy in your room the other night?”
Thank you for your patience with this latest chapter! I am currently in the process of moving houses and working at a new job, so it's safe to say things have been rather hectic. And I won't lie - certain statements made by the author of Harry Potter lately really struck a nerve with me and I've found it difficult to allow myself to enjoy the world she created in the current circumstances. But fear not - I have no intention of leaving this work unfinished! To quote Daniel Radcliffe:
"Well, clearly not," Remus said, probably referring to the article. "It's very brave of you, as usual, but…"
"But you do," Draco said. "And I turn your whole life complicated. That's us. That's what it… would be."
“Got it covered up," he said. Harry knew from the look on his face that he was talking about the Dark Mark.
Some hours later Harry was sitting at his desk, crouching over papers and books in a position that would have made dollar signs appear in a chiropractor's eyes. Harry was struggling to remember all the incidents in which he had been injured somehow. Professor Skepperus had given them an assignment to list all the magical injuries they had suffered and using the course material, research how they should have been treated. In addition to the broken arm incident in year two (and the sentence "not
“Are you boys lost? The loo is down the hallway and to the left," she said. She was a friendly looking woman who reminded Harry of Mrs. Weasley somehow.
“Oh, it’s you," Hermione said, peeking from behind the books. She apparently hadn’t noticed Harry’s offer to help her, as she made her way to the desk just fine and put the books down. She then placed her hands on her hips and turned to look at Harry.
And although Harry was fairly convinced that he would annoy Draco by showing up unannounced, he was surprised with a hug right when he walked through the door. A hug so tight, in fact, that Harry was lifted off of the floor a good inch or so. Harry's heart fluttered as his feet dangled in the air.
“What is it," Harry slurred and turned towards the door, seeing Neville’s head peeking out of the door frame.
“In two days," Hermione said. “I promised to send them some known historical cases of the misuse of Amortentia, just to spice up the article a bit, you know?”
Harry thought about it. No, he had never had a problem where he had found himself thinking of Ron all the time. But surely that alone didn't mean that he was into guys?
“No," Hermione said. “Just before you didn’t shake his hand. He came up to you - Ron and I were standing next to you - to introduce himself.”
"You don't know what kind of resources that family has," Draco said under his breath, glancing at the Weasleys, who were all watching the silent conversation. "If my father is at all involved, he could have found a magical object or spell that can track it. For all we know, it could already be too late. We have to get it while Bill and Fleur and the children are still here."
“It’s true then," Theodore said with his nasal, stretching voice. “Saint Potter has come down to greet the lower classes.” He was sitting in an armchair, looking like he was up to absolutely nothing. Harry saw a copy of Daily Prophet lying on the floor next to his feet and realized why Draco had asked him to bring a copy. Judging by Theodore’s tone of voice and the way he was looking at Harry with a stupid, very uncle Vernon-esque smile on his face, he hated Harry more than Draco ever had.
He noticed his handwriting subtly change every time he switched the page on which he was writing on. He usually wrote in rounded, small letters using soft pressure, leaving generous space in between the words in case he needed to tweak something later. Whenever he started writing in Potter’s notebook and saw his pointed, squeezed-together letters that overlapped each other, sometimes so much so that the words became impossible to decipher, he started to suddenly make mistakes he usually wouldn't have, and his writing started to unexplainably and stubbornly slant to the left.
Potter looked at Skepperus with a face that unmistakebly belonged to a person who had just woken up. Nothing seemed to yet be happening behind the eyes.
Harry sat on Dean’s writing desk chair and watched as Seamus wrote down names of songs he was considering for the mixtape.
The four of them turned to look at Neville who had appeared at the door. He was holding a pile of heavy-looking books with what looked like pressed leaves sticking out from in between the pages.
“Why, do you want me to?” Draco said, raising his brows and giving a smirk that caught Harry off-guard, causing a jerk in his gut and a burning on his cheeks.
Harry glanced at Draco. He didn’t say anything, but he raised his eyebrows in a gesture that told Harry he should probably continue talking.
Draco didn’t answer. He glanced at Harry, carefully wrote a new date on top of the old one and put the notebook back in the drawer.
"Poor bastard, your father really told you nothing, did he?" Grandmother Yana seemed to enjoy Draco's grim expression. "Well, Lucius
Later that night Harry was overseeing the dishes as they washed themselves. Darthorn, much to the horror of some parents, didn't have house elves. Instead each dorm had to divide chores within its inhabitants, and that included cooking and cleaning. In addition to that, the 200 students were also in charge of keeping the classrooms and hallways clean. The task rotated between dorms weekly so that on average, each dorm would have to clean the school about once a year. Even with five people who all used magic, the job was still pretty daunting. Neville had accidentally created a flood in the owlery the previous year, causing little rodent skeletons, feathers and owl droppings to pour into the courtyard. Harry already dreaded their next turn.
“About Amortentia?” Harry said, letting out an amazed laugh. “Hermione, that’s great! When is it coming out?”
"Are you sure you don't want to stay here? I'm sure Potter will manage on his own," Harry heard her say. He didn't have time to hear whether Malfoy answered her or not, because he was now in a hurry to lean against the nearest wall and look indifferent about the whole situation.
“And… finished," Ron said after adding one last dot on the parchment. He laid down his quill, stretched and leaned back in his chair. He had a victorious smile spread across his face.
“You look like this,” Draco said and leaned back down, imitating Harry’s heavy-lidded expression. “Impatient, much?”
“Kind of," Draco said. “I guess, also that I wouldn’t even be friends with her anymore. It was too weird after everything that had happened. She tried to tell me she didn’t care what I thought about Muggles, that she just didn’t want me to disappear from her life.”
“Hm.” Draco looked outside, but could see nothing but white mist and the drops of moisture rolling off the glass walls. “Suppose I already love that person,” he then said. “Suppose I do everything in my power to love him as best as I can.”
"We were actually on a date," Harry said, finally managing a few words. They tip-toed out hesitantly, as if checking whether the atmosphere was safe to say such a thing. To his relief, the smile that rose to the corner of Remus' mouth didn't appear amused, not in the wrong way.
Wilkins piped up, concerned. “If this void exists, will we be able to use protective magic once we enter?”
By the fourth afternoon he had come to expect that Harry would be waiting for him, but not to find him sitting on the floor across from Greg, who was dangling a piece of string over the kittens.
Draco takes a slow sip and turns back towards the window, seemingly intent on the glow from the street lamps. “I wouldn’t have taken you for an interpreter of allegory.”
Couldn’t I have guessed she’d have no use for someone so weak, so disloyal, as to be manipulated away from what I had with him?
And, at times, considerably more interesting. Particularly when they involve the delivery of semi-pornographic photos to one’s desk on a Monday morning.
Harry turned back reluctantly and cringed when he was met with Granger’s confused, expectant stare. She looked to Draco and back to Harry. “Harry? Please, what is it?”
She leaned sideways so that plump, slappable arse came up off the table, and made me an offer: if I took Potter’s arse, I could finally have hers.
Lee kept on. "Tell us, Harry, how was he doing? Were you ready to bust in, nick of time, and save the day?"
“Auror Robards, if anything has been made abundantly clear, it is the importance of Potter’s schedule.”
,” Potter repeated, knitting his brow and straining to concentrate. Again, the beginning of a shield appeared but it wouldn’t solidify.
“We’ve considered the possibility, I assure you. The MLE and Department of Mysteries have both expressed concern that any visible sign of ill health might compromise Harry’s safety. In addition to those who took an interest in him recently, there are several former Death Eaters who might wish him harm. We simply can’t afford the risk.”
“I did?” He was genuinely confused, but raised a hand to forestall her objection. “I might have mentioned it, I suppose, but I’m certain I didn’t ask. Nor will I, since you’ve mentioned it. It hasn’t planted any seed. So to speak.”
Potter’s flush has filled in nicely, but the look on his face has segued from rage to something else. He almost looks distressed. “And the stuff that isn’t on the list?”
No, if Potter reacts, it won’t be in the Wizengamot. Potter’s always valued his privacy. As much as the
“And?” Draco repeated, the tatters of his stomach seeming to settle into a leaden crypt at the bottom of his gut. This didn’t seem to be going in any predictable direction at all, and that was almost worse than waiting for certain doom.
“Somehow,” Hermione piped up from behind him, “I suspect that Harry means Malfoy’s involvement in the procurement and display of Muggle art, particularly as intended for a mixed Muggle and wizarding audience and requiring quite a lot of unusual security.”
“I assure you, I’ve said nothing about how good my skin feels.” Though now Potter’s mentioned it… “Not that the insight into your associations isn’t fascinating.”
“I know you think I am, but I disagree. We have different interests. Different priorities. That’s all.”
inclined to help? I haven’t got a Pensieve on me just now, but I’d wager you’re badly misremembering our shared history if you think that’s the case.”
He pushed forward as Potter pushed back, slipping inside of him with the most electric friction he could’ve imagined. “Fuck.”
Malfoy lifts the stack, preparing to file it away, and looks down to align the edges. It’s just an instant, but Harry knows there has to be some way to do this that doesn’t involve six weeks, nineteen owls, three Sickles and an unnaturally calm Malfoy, and his instincts have always served him well.
“The foundation. Haven’t given it a public name yet, but I have a solicitor for it and she’s filed the paperwork to start things. And that’s what I’ll do. It’s something I can do, for one, and keep my magic without having to use it in ways I don’t want to. And it’s something I want to do, too. And it has the benefit of being something that the Ministry can’t really go after me for, you know? Wouldn’t look to good if the press went after me for this.”
It sounds like a challenge and he wishes he could stuff the words back in as soon as they’re out, but the glimmer in Harry’s eye suggests he’s far too late.
decorated, perhaps, but not overtly shameful. It had been a dusty mess the last time he’d been here.
Robards beats him to it. “We’re here to see Mr Malfoy. Mr Potter will be testing his newest project.”
He thinks of Malfoy’s back, as yet unmarked. Wonders if a shoulder blade would be as satisfying as the inside of a knee, or the arch of a rib.
“We’re all over there,” he pointed, “on the right, if you’re looking straight on, towards the back.”
Pushing himself up, Harry straddled Malfoy’s lap. “Or do you want to come with me hissing in your ear?” Malfoy’s cock twitched. “Do you want to come up my arse? Again? Fill my sloppy hole again?”
. Hadn’t wanted to care at seventeen, when Potter had been marched into the drawing room and Draco had lied to save him, or maybe to try to save himself—or when Potter had pulled him from the Fiendfyre, or when Potter had looked at him across the Great Hall when it was all over and then looked away like he wasn’t any more interesting than the furniture. He hadn’t wanted to care at eighteen, when Potter's testimony had shortened his stay in Azkaban considerably. Hadn’t wanted to care when he didn’t see Potter again for years after that or when, once he did, it ended in fisticuffs. He certainly hadn’t wanted to care tonight, and he didn’t want to care now.
“Fine. Any other incidents of unexplained magical outbursts from, near, in, related to him, in any way?”
“No.” The rattling in the makeshift wall between them muffles Potter’s voice. “I think there’s a boggart in the that one.”
He’d’ve been an idiot not to look, and eventually he did, just for a second. Then blushed, of course, the naïf. He almost yelled his, “Of course not!” before he began mumbling to himself, calling himself an idiot. A new point of agreement between us.
Robards hadn’t named the runes in front of Malfoy. Harry was sure of it. It was classified, on a need-to-know basis, and Harry only knew because he’d seen the bodies. He didn’t know which symbols had turned up at the other two crime scenes, though when he looked at another drawing, Malfoy seemed to; there was a couple, laid out across a field, with a rune carved into one of their bare stomachs, and its inversion on the other’s.
To his consternation, Harry couldn’t think of any reason to say no to dinner, or to Luna’s suggestion that he should go home without stopping back at the hide.
He smiles into Potter’s skin when another almost-word falls from Potter’s lips. It’s a strangled sort of noise, one that Draco’s fairly certain started with “Ple—” And at that he’s unsure, again, of whether this feeling is victory or arousal or whether it has, with Potter, always been some amalgam of the two. He’s unsure, too, whether it matters exactly why he’s throbbing at the sight of the Harry Potter, stretched out, bound and stripped, cock straining through his pants.
There wasn’t one to be found. “And when we continue on?” He frowned. “And when they try to pull dozens of teenagers into some Ministry reprogramming course?” His jaw fell open, mortification written across his face.
too.” She patted his arm and then let it go. “Goldfinches and swans. Then he would have been able to coast for quite some time, in hopes of landing somewhere safer. Which he managed, in a sense. Quite a bit safer than coming down in the middle of a hunting party, don’t you think?”
He looks almost surprised to realise he hasn’t been. He looks down to his own dripping erection, and lifts a hand from the sheets to stroke himself.
It was pitch black when Harry woke, coughing. Malfoy must have drawn the curtains after he’d fallen asleep, and Harry had to grope for his wand on the bedside table. Panic rose as his fingers found the wooden tabletop, and the legs of an ancient alarm clock, but not the smooth, familiar grip of his wand until… there, wedged between the table and the wall. His exhale of relief turned into another round of coughing; Malfoy kept the place drier than the Sahara—probably something about preserving whatever invaluable Malfoy heirlooms the Ministry had deigned to leave him—and Harry hated it so much he would’ve made a habit of going home if he weren’t so reliably exhausted by the end of their evenings together. And if he weren’t inclined to avoid rocking the boat with Malfoy.
and, with it, unlimited good press, the appearance of ethical standards, and a renewed handle on politics; Ministry types are even more responsive to bad press than to bribes, and the interactions are considerably cleaner.
Malfoy didn’t say anything, and for all the time as Harry had spent alternately dreading and wishing for this meeting, he couldn’t think of how to start it.
Millie leaned back and crossed her arms over her ribs. “I was picking up files for the Minister’s morning briefing, stayed for a glass of wine, and then those three showed up. Potter was, granted, in the vicinity of the shelf, but there was glass all over the place. Much closer to an explosion than a fall.”
When he spoke, it was with the threat of imminent explosion. “If there are any more surprises, any more bits of information that you have seen fit to leave out, and you do not tell me what they are in the next five minutes, I will leave you, and this project, and this country, the instant—the very second—I find out.”
“A phone call, then?” Draco snorted and crossed his arms. “I can’t imagine you’d know anyone I’d want to speak with.”
Draco pushes through the doors to the warehouse, unbuttoning his robes as he goes. The Ministry’s required uniforms are stuffy even for someone with a pureblood upbringing, all starched collars and thick wool and rows of double-breasted buttons that must be polished to a shine. They’re appropriate enough for the increasingly chilly weather, but too heavy to really permit free movement. Most Ministry workers resolve the issue by wearing them improperly, a shortcut that sets Draco’s teeth on edge. When his work requires a greater range of movement – which, happily, only occurs when he is out of the public eye – he prefers to remove them altogether, lest they become wrinkled or stained. He has therefore made a habit of doffing his robes on his way in to the warehouse, hanging them near the massive dais where Vanished items come to rest.
that it was his magic, starved for nourishment, fading away. He knew it, felt it, with Ron and Hermione during those horrible months on the run, hunting Horcruxes. But, even then, Hermione always found them something to eat; his magic never abandoned him completely.
Severus found Draco curled up on the window seat of an oddly placed window that gave light to an alcove that was part of a largely unused staircase that led to the upper floors of the Manor. It was too large to be a landing and too small to be an actual room… and it was the perfect place for the Malfoy heir, abused and afraid, to hide.

The baby isn’t quite a year old, but there something about holding his solid form securely on one hip makes Draco feel that maybe… just maybe… everything is going to be all right.
Severus had learned long ago that it was pointless to try to anticipate Voldemort—and there was precisely nothing he could do to spare the boy in any case—but Severus found that his heart ached for the pale, trembling boy who was about to learn, for the first time, what it
“I had it in my head that you would step through the Floo into this sort of… domestic bliss. And there would be breakfast waiting for you and… everything. Instead, look!” I waive my hand around the disaster that is my kitchen.
“I’m not surprised,” Draco answered. “I had rather a rough arrival here, you recall.” He had aimed for the snarky tone that he had once commanded so easily… and he didn’t think he had done too terrible of a job, either, given that Potter was kneeling before him with Draco’s own blood on his fingertips.
The man is also wearing several sickles worth of an astringent-smelling cologne. Harry tugs his arm out of the man’s grip—a feat that requires quite a bit of effort; the motion threatens to disrupt the fragile truce he and his stomach have reached.
“Harry, it’s okay.” Draco picks up Harry’s hand and presses his lips to his palm. “Nothing you don’t want.”
Draco felt the hand on his shoulder tense at the mention of Snape, before squeezing. Carefully. “You’re safe here. I swear it.”
Harry’s hand reaches out, so slowly, and brushes away his tears.  “We’re going to get through this, Draco. Together. I promise.”
Harry’s body becomes welcoming. His mouth finds Draco’s, hot and tender and giving, and Draco finds himself sobbing slightly with the effort of keeping still.
When the days begin to shorten again, he knows it’s time to go home. He finds a tiny flat in London and the job at the coffee shop. Almost no one knows he’s back.
His back hadn’t stopped hurting, but it had begun to itch. He couldn’t reach to scratch and, indeed, couldn’t have borne his own touch if he could.
?” he says. “Please? Just tell me why I could have gotten strep throat, but not the common cold from… from…
A speck of color tinges Potter’s cheeks. “Thanks. I did all the cooking when I lived with my aunt and uncle.”
Draco wanted to just keep lying on the stone floor, maybe allow a few of the threatening tears to leak out, to keep Potter’s hand on his shoulder… but he knew he had to move. Without giving voice to any of the painful sounds that wanted so badly to escape him, he forced himself to sit up.
meet you.” Miss Harding’s face is round and slightly freckled. She has wide, blue eyes… and should look innocent. She doesn’t. Her eyes dance. “I’ll just take the rest of your class, shall I, Mr. Malfoy? You three take the bus, yes?”
“Don’t be sorry. Not for that. Besides…” Harry works tiny kisses up his wrist... up the inside of his arm. “We’ve got time. We’ve got all the time in the world.”
Draco nods. And feels the shirt lift off, over his head. He’s blinking his hair out of his eyes… then looking up at the look of horror on Harry’s face.
These bits of information haven’t the time to congeal into a proper thought when he realizes that he
He is gasping, his breath coming short, as though he has taken the stairs at a dead run. Maybe he had.

The library at Grimmauld Place is full of books… but it is obviously rather short on the Muggle fiction Draco has become attached to. Sometimes he sneaks into the room Granger and Weasley share and nicks one of Granger’s books—he knows she doesn’t mind—but her tastes run more towards romance, well-written, of course, but light enough to make up for the heavy tomes she reads for work.
Victoire chatters throughout the meal, disguising any awkwardness with chirpings about her classes, classmates, and of course, dragons.
Weasley and Granger decide to stay the night, but Draco is happy when Harry declines Mrs. Weasley’s kind offer… for one thing, Draco can tell she isn’t sure where to
“You know,” Harry says, “I wasn’t even sure I liked blokes until… I guess I don’t know when. But it seems like it should be something I’ve just always known… you know? But I didn’t.”
He finds himself squatting down, watching Malfoy right the cup, replacing the few coins with trembling fingers… watching him arranging himself on the filthy blanket, tucking the ends back over his legs, pain written across his face... watching another tear slither out of his eye, running the track of almost pure white all the way to his jaw.

I make the story last longer than necessary, adding an unreasonable amount of detail. Victoire’s blinks are long and slow by the time I finish.
He is in the library, reading, and sipping chamomile tea out of his rainbow mug when Harry walks in.
“Excuse me, please,” Draco says to the Welcome Witch. She doesn’t look up. “We have an appointment with Healer Mitchell.”
“And You Know Who moved into your house when you were fifteen. It’s probably not best to start comparing horror stories, yeah?”
Draco threads his fingers through that oh-so-familiar hair and kisses him back. He nips Harry’s lower lip in the way that he knows he likes and is rewarded with an almost desperate cry. Draco throws his head back, giving Harry access to his neck and Harry gently worries the skin in the way that always could—always would—make him moan.
Draco finds himself matching the smirk. “Too right. So,” he says, trying to lean casually on the doorframe. “What

idea what to do next and… he couldn’t stop himself from worrying about Malfoy. He hadn’t seen him at all in days and days… and Hermione was violently opposed to Harry taking peeks into Voldemort’s mind.
Draco sheds his coat before reaching for Harry. He cups his head gently, leaning down for a gentle kiss. Harry’s lips are soft, tasting of bread, butter, and a fruity red wine. Draco closes his eyes and deepens the kiss, kissing Harry like he’s been gone for days, not hours.
“You’re right… I--” He’s cut off by the arrival of the house elf carrying a tray of sandwiches. Sandwiches that are warm and smell delightfully meaty and cheesy.
The mug. It’s a rainbow mug and the hands holding it out for him are rough and flecked with ginger hair.
Draco feels a strong Disillusionment charm wash over him, creating a bubble of absolute privacy. He shivers—if anything the air behind the charm is even colder… and it is certainly doing nothing to block the wind.
, you know? So I moved in… and then Hermione, too, when she finished Hogwarts. It was a bit awkward, actually, but we got it sorted. He told us about you—bit floored, we were, but we got over it—and how you disappeared…”
Harry sat on his bed, leaning back against the wall, with the full intention of taking a quiet moment to try and invade Voldemort’s mind. He had been seeing flashes on and off; glimpses of hatred, anger, rage that were not his own… but he hadn’t seen Draco Malfoy.
Aunt Petunia took one of his hands, spreading his fingers out along the wrinkled hem. With her own bony hand, she held his in place, her palm pressing sharply against his knuckles. Then she picked up the iron with her other hand, sliding it to the hem, sliding it right into the tips of his fingers.
She doesn’t move. If anything she sinks lower to the ground and her quivering becomes audible, more a purr than a proper growl, though the sound is anything but happy. He drops to the floor next to the door, careful not to look at her, and transfers a treat into the palm of his hand, which he holds open and flat on the floor.
Harry was three days into his job at the coffee shop, two days past spilling and dropping things at regular intervals, when Malfoy strolled through the door, greeted Adelle by name, and nodded when she asked if he wanted his usual. Harry
He doesn’t know who snapped his picture and what they might have heard, but he can no longer pretend to be out of the country. His relationship with Draco is public knowledge. He might not even have the luxury of announcing his own damn pregnancy.
Harry is an excellent cook, but he hates it. Weasley is a terrible cook, and on his nights he usually suggests that they grab a bite at the pub—something Draco won’t even consider—or he brings home takeaway; Draco is mildly annoyed to find himself enjoying various exotic dishes, purporting to hail from all corners of the globe, out of paper boxes or plastic trays.
“I knew what I was getting myself into… I just…” Draco feels his voice fall away, remembering the cold and the hunger and the dirty feeling of knowing that he would have gone with
Potter opens a cupboard, rummages around a moment and pulls out a couple of worn, but soft-looking towels. He snags a pair of red and gold flannel pants out of a plastic laundry bin and reaches in again for a battered burgundy sweatshirt with seven white, blocky letters on it. Draco cannot resolve the letters into anything sensible. “They’re clean,” he says.
tells his story with his usual detached calmness… but not quite, and the slight wobble in his voice makes Harry afraid to ask what the elf’s punishment was—or what Draco meant by “rather sternly.”
found him. He was shivering on a street corner, resolved to take literally anyone… because the money was due in the morning and if he didn’t pay he would be sent straight to Azkaban.
Ron pushed open the door to the bedroom Harry and Malfoy were sharing and felt the silencing spell shatter around him.
Harry reaches up, finds one of Draco’s hands and places it gently in his hair. He finds the other one and does the same. Harry’s messy hair is soft as silk under Draco’s fingertips, and he has to fight his fingers to keep them steady.

Harry’s thumbs made soft circles on Draco’s hand, carefully tracing the knuckles. “Where would you have gone?”
Harry’s flat is tiny and sparsely decorated in what could politely be considered “eclectic,” but what would really be better described as “things other people were throwing away.” In the main room there’s a threadbare sofa at one end, a beautiful-but-battered Victorian-era table with three mismatched folding chairs in the middle, and a tiny kitchen at the other end. In his bedroom, the mattress on the floor takes up almost all the space—you can only walk all the way around it because of the wide bay window. There’s no tub, just a toilet and a tiny stand-up shower.
Weasley pops in once or twice a day, staying at the edge of the fog, asking if there is anything that Draco needs.
Harry leans forward, cupping Draco’s chin with his free hand. “I’m glad,” he whispers before lowering his mouth to Draco’s. The kiss is long and slow and Draco lets out a little whimper when Harry deepens it.

He’s not even sure Harry’s still awake… until he feels the brush of an illumination charm and the room glows softly. It’s enough to make out Harry’s features, beautiful and worried, but not much else.
“No. What I really want is a turkey sandwich… with spicy mustard,” he says. “I know it sounds weird. And then to take a nap.”
“Draco, I would never—on my life—force you or coerce you or take from you a single thing that you did not want to give. I would never do
“Harry, you were the Boy Who Lived.” Draco traces the roughness of Harry’s lightning bolt scar with a gentle finger. “You were never going to not stand out.”
“Why would I mind?” He is using his professional voice now. “That was very kind of you. I’m sure she’s exhausted.”
Harry does it, breaking eye contact for no longer than the fraction of a second it takes to pull off his shirt; Draco isn’t even sure that he blinks.
Harry was worried about him. He said it out loud… said he wanted to help. The words stung Draco’s pride.
Draco takes a deep breath. “Yes, I am.” He tilts Harry’s chin up and meets his eyes. “I am going to go to work. I am going to because I
“Dinner won’t be ready for a couple of hours,” Potter is saying. “I didn’t know if you’d want to sleep… or read, maybe?”
. Not someone who is paid to be with me… not someone who has no choice… not someone who can’t tell me no. Just you.”
Harry runs his own calculations… and comes up with something unpleasant. “You’re not a whore, are you?”
Malfoy’s fingers press down on the last cords… the last delicate notes slipping away like thistledown in a gentle breeze. He turns back towards Harry, his face stripped bare of every mask it has ever worn.
It’s a pleasant thought—to use the money to restore Malfoy Manor to the safe, sun-soaked home of his childhood memories. Part of him wants to bring Harry there and have tea in his mother’s rose garden and play Quidditch on the grassy lawns. He wants to take him into the woods and show him the fort he built in the summers
It was her hair the Dark Lord sent him… to remind him that he was failing in his mission to kill Dumbledore. If it hadn’t been for that lock of hair… would he have joined the side of Light and fought alongside Harry? Would his mother be dead right now? Would he? Would he and Harry have run away to New Zealand and left the British Wizarding World to deal with the Dark Lord on their own?
. It’s foggy enough that Harry doesn’t bother looking for a secluded spot, but rather simply turns on his heel and disappears.
) petition the courts to have control of the Malfoy fortune given over to him. Draco is surprised by the amount in the Malfoy vaults—he thought more had gone to the Dark Lord and then to fines and legal fees.
Draco takes a bite of sandwich. Ground meat and melted cheese combine with the bite of ketchup on toasted bread. If a hug were a sandwich, he thinks, it would taste like this.
Harry does buy two helmets. And then two leather jackets, two pairs of boots, and two pairs of tight-fitting leather pants.
Draco took the broth, the cup was warm in his hands, and inhaled. It smelled wonderful, but his stomach wasn’t entirely sure about it, and he sipped gingerly. Warmth flooded him, and he began to shiver.
The third time Ron had been seriously injured in the line of duty, he decided that opening a business might be a better choice than an Auror for a husband and father. He took the empty space beside the bookshop and opened a coffee shop. They put in a door between the spaces and both businesses have been thriving ever since.
“Sometimes it was just a punishment. But sometimes…” He shrugs. “Usually I had to stay in my room when there were guests. When Dudley had a friend over or something. My aunt wouldn’t always remember to bring something up for me.”
The shadows are long when Harry stops the bike. The towers… the bricks… even the hedges already look cheerful. If a house can look cheerful. Hopeful.
Antonie drops his napkin on the table and rises. His plate disappears in the magic of the house elves. “See you later, Draco,” he says, striding from the dining room.
“I’m not doubting that.” She pats his hand gently. Her knuckles are swollen with arthritis, but her manicure is subdued and perfect. The diamond on her ring is one of the ones that could feed a small country. “But I watched my mother go through three pregnancies and my sisters have had sixteen between them. I, myself, have been pregnant five times, and now I have three grandchildren and twenty-eight great-nieces and –nephews. I am not usually wrong when it comes to noticing when someone is expecting.”
Severus wished he could say he didn’t know how long the punishment continued… but he did know—exactly. Tom Riddle and his seven times

blushing. He drinks the last of his coffee. “So… the bookshop, then? To find something for Hermione’s new bookshelves?”
Harry is trembling under him. His hair, black against the white of the pillow case, his eyes wide and green.
Which is, of course, another reason why it is me here instead of a responsible adult. Like Andromeda. Victoire probably has other friends, but Fleur wouldn’t ask a Muggle to keep her overnight—too much chance for accidental magic.

“Yes, please.” Weasley might not be able to cook, but his coffee is exquisite, and Draco has never quite been able to comprehend why he
“I love you, Harry Potter,” Draco says, pushing Harry back on the rock… straddling him… kissing him gently, but only at first. “You don’t make any fucking sense, but I love you.”
Draco takes it. And lets the tears fall freely into the checkered cloth. He takes a deep breath, and wipes his eyes. “Thank you.” He refolds the handkerchief and offers it back.
happens, and Draco has the vague impression that someone is standing there… someone who hands Harry a set of clean robes. Not the flimsy sort of robes that Draco wears between clients, but proper wizarding robes.
Potter has turned bright red, and Draco would be lying if he said he wasn’t enjoying Potter’s stuttering.
The last time he saw him, it was Potter’s voice between Draco and a lifetime in Azkaban. And before that, it was Potter’s body between him and the leaping Fiendfyre flames. And before
Narcissa had sent over a few items for Draco; clothes mostly, but also a few tatty paperback books—Tolkien, Shakespeare,
Minerva McGonagall offered him one of the rooms at Hogwarts, and peace and quiet, while he studied for his NEWTS, while he decided what he wanted to do. He almost accepted that offer.
Sometimes Harry goes to the cottage with Weasley and Hermione, and occasionally Draco goes too… only to spend an uncomfortable evening always looking over his shoulder.
Not like a hangover. Not like the stomach flu. But an undercurrent of nausea that drags at him, turning him away from his favorite smells.
Potter regards him curiously, but takes the rinsed dishes, dries them, and puts them away without comment.
That’s also a lie as it turns out, and a moment later, Harry Potter is reaching through the bars of his cell to wipe a tear from his cheek.
In the end, though, it was Charlie Weasley’s invitation to Romania that had him packing his things, leaving a note for Ron and Hermione, and disappearing without a trace.
words… and by the patient blink of Granger’s eyes, he thinks maybe they haven’t this time. “I was there voluntarily,” he repeats, certain that it is out loud this time.
... for just a little while longer. She left him with the hot iron and the stack of wrinkled handkerchiefs, telling him there would be no lunch until they were perfect.
Draco feels his eyes fall, briefly, on the bed. His desire to crawl into it is just as strong as it was a few moments before… but now for completely different reasons. He feels Harry’s eyes follow his.
Apparently, Higsbee takes his silence for focus and starts in on a ramble. “You see, sir, policy is unclear.”
“Is that relevant?” Draco didn’t pause before his question. He was well trained in deflection, and bloody thankful for it.
“No, no. He came in through the window.” He shakes his head at their collective raised eyebrows. “To avoid the staff, he said.”
Penelope hummed disapprovingly. “In your professional opinion, Auror Potter, is the accused guilty of the ten murders attributed to a single killer, and which follow the pattern previously described by Head Auror Robards?”
His robes, yes. Waistcoat first. Three buttons. Robes. He shrugs them on. He’s done this before. He can walk and - yes, one, two, three, four, five, six rows of buttons. Clasp at the collar, which he straightens. He runs a hand through his hair, smooths his robes and opens the door.
Draco glanced at his watch. Three minutes. Beyond what he’d expect from a healthy adult wizard who was focused on the task. More focused than Potter currently was. “How does the spell feel?”
He has a million questions and not a single one of them is worth asking if it involves taking Potter’s cock out of his mouth.
Draco snorted. “Well that solves it then, as no one gives better ethical advice than a literary agent and a bureaucrat.”
“Hey,” Draco reaches over and pulls him close. “Coq au vin, soufflés, and I’ll return them properly later tonight.”
I move to correct him at once. This pain is not necessary. Kneeling between his legs, I lift one knee over my shoulder. He looks as relieved as he does startled.
Draco was about to object when the force of Potter’s reaction stopped him. Instead he asked, “Let what go?”
“She didn’t feel it was necessary to tell me in advance that you had the entire Wand implanted, as opposed to a conventional implant.”
Harry couldn’t decide whether to keep up with Malfoy or wander off on his own. Malfoy didn’t seem bothered either way. Harry was, though; no matter what he chose, he felt itchy and restless and unsure of what was up or down. It had all seemed…soft, somehow. Intimate. That was confusing enough. To have it disappear through a doorway was like finding himself on the receiving end of a
Draco gave a wry laugh. “All other attempts to digest them have left me with more questions than answers. Perhaps we ought to try it.”
As he walks, he remembers – lets himself remember – the times he’s shared these spaces with Potter. It’s harmless enough as a way to pass the time.
“In kitchenware. We have successfully retrieved items used to prepare and serve meals, but there’s more to it than that.”
“Can too.” Draco pulled their hands closer to him and Potter followed. He’d needed Potter to be still. Still did, in order to think. But the silence was as loud, now, as Potter’s boots had been.
There’s a long pause from the other side of the blockade before Potter continues. “I’m not positive, but there was a desk a while back with a boggart in it. It did the same rattling thing and this wardrobe is from the same room.”
“So then,” he rushes on, still picking up speed, “I went to try to help George, with the store, you know? I had trained to be an Auror, I had the charms work down, but then word got out and the store was mobbed all the time. Not even customers, just people who wanted to,” Potter shudders, “to touch me, to talk to me, and they’d knock things over and the real customers couldn’t even get in. It was ruining the business, so I had to leave that too, and I liked it, you know? I really liked it. But it was dangerous.
The door might not be heavy, but it’s ominous. Everything this morning has felt ominous to Harry. Everything for the last few days has. His gut’s so permanently twisted he’s barely been able to eat, much to Molly’s consternation. But he’s not sure he could keep anything down, the way his whole body starts roiling every time he thinks about it.
He has to dodge another one as he steps forward. Has to jump aside when Draco sees him getting closer and levitates a polished tree stump at him. Almost trips when Draco slides a heavy oak night stand into the diminishing space between them.
Hermione rested her hand on Ron’s arm. Harry strongly suspected Ron would pull away if he tried the same.
Dammit. “Taken the liberty, have you?” Draco drawled from behind his menu, racking his brain for some other way out. “How bold of you.”
“You’re welcome.” He returned the nod, watched as she bid Millie, Blaise, and Greg goodnight and left the room, giving the door only marginally gentler treatment than Potter had.
Draco watched him for any hint of where the line of questioning might be going. There was none. But he didn’t believe—didn’t feel—that Harry would be setting him up for anything. It felt like it would be fine to admit it. “Yes.” He waited a beat. “Do you?”
“Your comrades in arms, the source of your missions, the former headquarters of your army. Very stable.”
“That’s even—” Draco shook his head, half-convinced he’d entered an enchantment or an alternate universe and needed to clear away some sort of potions vapor. “You once broke into a bank, stole a priceless artefact, stole a
She also had a way of changing the subject, and it was a bloody enormous relief to discuss the management of the Manor and the proper care of wool. Since she’d arrived he’d made it through almost two whole hours without jumping at every sound, between their conversation and the reassurance that came with knowing that every stray click was Pansy’s nails on the table or her heels on the parquet or the ice in her glass resettling.
Draco sighed. “I don’t know, to be entirely honest. There are a lot of factors. It’s not even possible to know, I don’t think. If that uncertainty is too much for you, I’ll understand.”
Harry’s frozen to the spot. Not that he’s been asked for a response, really; he’s fairly sure it’s rhetorical. Which is for the best; he doesn’t have an answer.
“Thank you, darling. Do say goodnight before you leave, would you? If I’m still here, that is.” With a polite smile, she swept towards the front of the room.
The sun has inched closer to the tops of the hills. He doesn’t know how long he’ll be able to hang on to the prototype. It’s time to try again.
“I could, but they’d be awfully redundant reports. Magical progress comes slowly. I’d hate to waste your time like that.”
, pulled the key out of her robes and made me the kind of bet that neither honour nor, frankly, desire would let me refuse.
He kissed Potter before he could answer, pressed into him with all he had, and thrilled at Potter’s response. Potter’s lips parted and he let out the first hint of a moan, and when Draco pulled back Potter’s pupils had gone so big that they were rimmed by only the finest ring of Slytherin green.
I gave Blaise a hearty slap and asked him to confirm. His argument made a lot of sense for someone quite so thoroughly out of his gourd.
If anything, the pain potion should slow Harry’s heart rate, so he can only imagine how hard it’d be pounding without it. He’s sure there’s some sort of good excuse for his request out there somewhere, but he’s buggered if he can think of it. “Want you to.”
“Really, I didn’t. I’m nervous, alright? But it’s not that I don’t trust you or anything like that.”
Auror rules strictly forbade punching Malfoy in the face. That was the only thing keeping Harry from decking him, and even that was hanging on by a thread. It had been absurd to think Malfoy might change, that he was even capable of it. Malfoy was just as selfish and deluded as he’d always been.
“What would help you –” Harry rests his hand over Draco’s and Draco’s breath hitches “—make a positive identification?”
Draco knew the gallery like the back of his hand. He was especially glad of that now, when it let him move on autopilot.
“Darling, I don’t know how they do it in Paris, but when that many people reach for their envelopes that quickly?” She raised her eyebrows.
(ed. note – we hope our readers will excuse the name! It may be a shock for us, but it’s just one more reminder of the bravery that’s made Harry a national treasure and an international hero!)
Fortunately, it’s rarely put to the test. Draco works in Research and Development, Harry in Special Operations, and never the twain shall meet, outside of the holiday party and the quarterly meetings, neither of which is small enough to force anything. Harry occasionally hears that Draco’s invented something new, and Draco occasionally mentions a project that Harry later recognises in updates to their commissioned gear, but they are, for all work-related intents and purposes, former acquaintances.
He didn’t seem to care. Just held my damp hand in his, in broad daylight, in the middle of the Quidditch pitch.
Malfoy lets go with a scowl. His collar is mussed, Harry notices, and his hair. He grabs the page out of Harry’s hand and frowns down at it, then sticks it to Potter’s chest.
He cleared his throat and glanced down at his bare chest, hoping it would be enough hint for Millie. “I am not able to speak to the Minister at present. May I ask what this concerns?”
The first tests are fine. A bit thrilling, if Harry’s honest about it. After Phillips is satisfied that he’s mastered the jump, he tries moving left, first. Does a quick spin and reverses direction. He can’t help grinning, or sneaking a look at Draco as he does. He’s relieved to see something softer in Draco’s eyes. Relieved and exhilarated, he tries for a flip, just as he would on a broom.
“They don’t want to believe that it is. But I assure you, Potter, I absolutely guarantee, that they’re wrong. They haven’t seen all the research. I have.”
“He was in his office, one. Two, fuck off. Three, no. It’s confidential for good reason, and this connection is even less secure than the other.”
When the bag was balled up between them, devoid even of the last substantial crumbs, Harry looked at his watch and sighed. “Almost nine.”
I should’ve wanted to think of Quidditch statistics and flobberworms, but my ability to focus on anything other than him was non-existent. It was all him, all us. There was nothing more.
Neither moved for a long moment. Harry’s shallow breath had grown faster, and he thought Malfoy’s might have as well. The hand that had rested on Harry’s back was gone, and he thought he heard fabric rustling behind him.
“Draco.” It’s Pansy’s Serious Voice. “We love you very much and are very sorry to see you hurting—which you are, as is evident to anyone with eyes—even if it does offer a remarkable amount of insight into a decade’s worth of perplexing choices. And while we have not always been Potter’s biggest supporters,” her voice cracks, just for an instant, and Draco wants to kick himself for ever mentioning Potter, “we have always been yours. Clearly, you need to do something. Or else we do.”
These were, Harry knew, among the very good reasons they did not discuss anything personal. But then, he hadn’t been wrong that this made things more interesting. “Then you may also recall how she got her scoops? And how Hermione was able to fit a witch into a jar?”
resolved the stickiness, though it made his skin feel just a bit too tight; spells were never as good as real showers. He didn’t want to think about why he’d given Potter his own. Several helpful suggestions sprang to mind; he overrode them with the reminder that he’d just needed to give Potter somewhere else to go, lest his inevitably awkward post-coital explanations and excuses make the situation even worse.
Harry doesn’t look up, won’t risk Malfoy seeing the dampness gathering in the corners of his eyes. He mumbles into the wool, instead. “You’re just going to stand there?”
Draco still watches him. Seated astride the fence, the cloak spilling over to either side, Harry watches back.
been quick to point that out before whatever Malfoy’d had to say in their gallery-related meetings. And while Malfoy and friends made periodic shows of repentance, Harry was never able to bring himself round to seeing them as anything more than that. Particularly when they involved displays of wealth and influence.
He’s tired of Potter’s looks. And really, it’s probably none of the things he’s thought of. Probably just Potter’s own unending entitlement. He probably thinks Draco’s just another Vanished object that can be tagged up and brought down for his perusal.
Malfoy scowled. “Problem, Potter? We have a vested interest in keeping the texts safe. The Ministry isn’t secure enough and Gringotts is too inaccessible. With the exception of this outing, that’s where they stay.”
Harry thinks of Draco’s bedroom in the Manor, and all the rooms he’s never seen. He wonders if Draco will look as at ease at the dining table, or in the kitchen, or wherever it is they’re going to eat.
He grasped Potter’s cock firmly, and the guttural noise that rose from Potter’s chest was already enough. He began to lose track of the rhythm just as they’d established it.
Madame Pomfrey came as quick as she could with Dittany and Blood Replenishing Potion and a million charms to get you stabilised enough to move. And here you are.
“I mean it, about being works in progress. It’s true for everyone. Some more seriously than others, perhaps. But some are better painters, too.”
He left for Titchwell instead, and spent his lunch walking along the dunes until his fingers were freezing and he couldn’t feel his nose. He wondered if Malfoy ever came out there, and if he did whether it was to work or just to look. He thought about how good Malfoy had looked when he was relaxing over a pint, back when, and how funny he’d been when they’d walk down Brompton Road taking the piss out of tourists. He thought about how shocked Malfoy had looked when Harry had taken him to the pub with his friends the first time, and how quickly it had turned to hunger after a few pints. He thought about how he’d come back from Amsterdam to a stack of letters he’d sent to Malfoy, returned unopened and interspersed with his postcards, and how Malfoy had never spoken to him again.
He paused when he felt something unusually hard and thin under through the denim and leaned back with a grin. If it felt like an age since he’d pulled, it had been half an eternity since he’d pulled another wizard, and the convenience was unbeatable. He had to lean in to be heard. One more in a list of things he’d found thoroughly unobjectionable this evening. The man smelled as good as he looked, and Draco nipped at his earlobe, eliciting a thoroughly delightful moan before he whispered, “Is that a wand or are you just happy to see me?”
The words are like stabs to Narcissa's heart and she realizes Draco is unwavering. She recognizes that look in his face, because once it has stared right back at her from the mirror. This is it. Things will never be the same. Never. Not after this.
"Well, you have been distracted lately," Remus offered. "You can allow yourself a bit of happiness."
"I'll do it if it's so important to you," he said. "I can owl you the papers as proof when I get to London."
“I won’t tell him if you don’t want me to, but I honestly don’t see the point. We aren't children anymore. You’re allowed to be friends with whoever you want as long as they’re not hurting you.”
Harry tried the door, and as he had already guessed, it was locked. He realized that if the events would follow the patterns of his nightmares, the eyes would come next. Voldemort’s eyes would appear in the vent. Harry decided to get out instead of waiting, and he cast
Draco gave a vague smile that quickly faded. No one had ever told him they were proud of him before, and he wasn't quite sure what the appropriate reaction was. He decided to look at the article instead. He didn’t really have the ability at that moment to concentrate on it. Words were running around on the page, twitching and swirling into directions that weren’t supposed to be there.
Harry read the note over and over again, his smile spreading so wide that he eventually covered it with his palm. Even though he was alone. What was this feeling?
“Thought I’d ask you what the hell is taking so long,” Theodore said. “They told me Potter went straight to re-inspect the body.
“Oh I’m sure," Harry said. “See, Ron and I used the Polyjuice Potion to transform into Crabbe and Goyle.” Harry thoroughly enjoyed the face that Draco was making.
“I did,” McGonagall said, “though I didn’t tell her that. I said to her I would owl her that same evening. That’s why I was surprised to find that she hadn’t yet left by the time I was done talking with Mr. Scamander.”
Just as Draco was about to get up and go browse his wardrobe for a less grim-looking suit, the fireplace crackled green and Harry stepped out. It was strange how, despite Draco’s love-hate-relationship with it, the uniform never failed to make Harry look like the most magnetic force of a man to ever walk the planet. This alone, however, didn’t make Draco blind to the fact that Harry was holding a file with the Ministry “M” embossed on it, and Draco knew what that meant. Though he would have liked to ignore it or at least pretend to, the disappointment made his gaze fixate on the embossed letter, complete with a gilding of gold leaf.
Confused as to what else he was supposed to do, he started look for clothes to wear. He somehow managed to put on his red hoodie the wrong way around twice before getting it right. He also put on his winter coat and a hat Hermione had knitted for him the previous Christmas, expecting it to be freezing outside. He then pocketed his wand and sneaked out of the apartment.
Harry hummed his response, his hands looking for tack on Draco’s back, but Draco didn’t let him spare his words so easily. He dragged his thumb along Harry’s lower lip.
“So, are you going to tell me why Draco was there or do you want me to guess?” Hermione said, crossing her arms.
“Oh, professor Skepperus…” he sighed and started looking through one of the shelves, holding his wand in between his teeth as a light source.
"Yeah," Harry laughed. "We had been hanging out for a while and we had such a good time together - but I don't think he was expecting it. Well, I
"For instance - I didn't know that you could see yourself being with a man," Remus said. "Not that there's anything wrong with that, of course."
“Are you sure it’s a good idea to wear it?” Harry said as Draco got up and used Scourgify on his hands.
“No matter,” Neville said. “She’s old, and with every passing year she gets nastier. And recently her memory’s started failing… I just can’t deal with it all right now. I’d rather be here now that it’s calm, for once. Silent.”
"Honestly, I don't know what it is with straight boys," Seamus said, wiping the corner of his eye. "They're all
“Someone has to look after the plants,” Neville said. “Professor Sprout was glad to go, and I was glad to stay.”
“Wishful thinking, my friend,” Draco said. “I was just about to have a walk outside, isn’t that right?”
The article was from a Russian newspaper that not so humbly called itself “The News”, implying that the events of the local wizarding society were the only news worth printing, or reading for that matter. The article itself declared that mournful events would soon cast a shadow on all of Moscow, as Adrik Malfoy, head of the esteemed family, was close to dying. Though the article referenced his adopted son numerous times, a name was never mentioned nor was he interviewed - instead, all comments were from who else but Grandmother Yana.
“Oh no," Granger laughed, “they can yell at each other all night long if they want. I have better things to do right now than play family therapist for them.”
Draco swallowed down, trying to keep his composure. He knew better than to reveal his fear in this company, although grandmother Yana had most likely noticed it already.
There was nowhere Harry could escape when Draco crawled closer to him, sniffing the air like a hound who was trying to locate a rabbit in the thicket.
Draco still couldn’t quite grasp how difficult it was to get anywhere on time despite finally having a fireplace connected to the Floo Network. Perhaps transportation was simply too easy that way; with commutes taking approximately ten seconds, one quickly began to assume that there was still time to have a cup of tea, to finish folding the laundry, to exchange a kiss or two, or otherwise…
“Pupils dilated," Seamus said and got up. “Dean, is that you baby? We got a situation over here. Seems like Potter’s playing for the rainbow team.”
“Oh come on, everyone was cringey back then," Harry laughed. “In case you forgot, Ron and I stole his dad’s car when we missed the train to Hogwarts.”
“Well, are you going to give it to me?” Harry said. He had a feeling he was being interrogated and he didn’t like it.
Harry looked at Draco and following his lead, took in a shaky inhale. Draco lifted his index finger.
“At least Malfoy knows what he’s doing”, Seamus said. “Doesn’t strike me as a bottom, though, that lad.”
They arrived to a Muggle coffee shop that looked like it was open 24 hours a day. Draco held open the door for Harry as they went in.
“Not that I can remember," Harry said. “Though I think I’d have to have been dying for the Dursleys to have me checked up.”
“Yeah," Draco said. “I remember being so salty about it… I kept telling everyone it wasn’t true since the Weasleys probably couldn’t afford a car in the first place. You know how sometimes you just, want to have a little chat with your past self and-”
Draco smiled into his palm and scolded himself for doing so. Marriage is about compromise, Molly's voice said in Draco's head. He often went to her for counsel, although it was a poor substitute for talking to his own mother. Another sip.
Open-mouthed, on a high off of tasting, breathing in Draco's scent, Harry kissed the side of his neck, nibbling and sucking and biting on the skin, leaving behind little red marks as if to say, "I was here". Carding through Harry's hair, Draco tilted his head in response and moaned quietly, low in his throat when Harry got to a particular spot.
“I mean-” Draco huffed, “I get it that you’re trying for Harry’s sake but he’s not even here right now.”
Draco didn't need to ask twice - dizzy for it, Harry started to gently thrust in and out, eventually settling on a pace that wasn't either brutal or slow, one hand stroking Draco's cock.
“And there isn’t just tops and bottoms”, Dean noted. “Some people like to switch, and a lot of people don’t even do the bum stuff.”
“No," Draco said, visibly getting more and more annoyed as Harry’s voice interrupted his thoughts. “She didn’t tell me because I already knew. You know why I already knew? Because I’m the one who was to live as Draco Malfoy in this sorry excuse of a world, and to me it was perfectly logical why she did it. It’s none of my business whether it makes sense to you or not.”
Draco had completely forgotten around the wedding, but now that he was reminded, he too started to see the severity of the situation for Rolf and Luna. They had sent Harry and Draco an invitation, too, and to Draco’s horror the date for the celebration had been set to February 14th. Was there anything more kitsch than a wedding on Valentine’s Day? Or maybe it was that the uncomfortable feeling Draco had gotten while reading the invitation hadn't been because of the disapproval of his (undeniably) superior taste, but because in that moment, he had envied the couple for their sentiment. Either way, there would be no such wedding if the murder wasn’t solved, fast.
“Maybe I should go back," Draco said out of the blue. He had a strange look in his eyes. It was as if he wasn’t even trying to focus them on anything in specific. “Pansy will be worried.”
Harry let out the breath and then Draco held him again, a little tighter this time. Draco ran his fingers through Harry’s hair and for a moment, they were quiet. It stopped snowing.
"What are you drawing?" Asked Harry, but Seamus seemed to be preoccupied with drawing a line to resemble a smile on his new stick figure.
Draco thought about a certain pile of sand near Shell Cottage with a house elf and an amulet worth more than all the treasures at Gringotts lying beneath it, and shuddered. An image flashed his mind - an image of a small corpse wrapped up in white linens, dug up from the cold sand and left there. Draco pushed the thought away. Only Harry knew where the amulet was.
Narcissa's knuckles whiten inside her suede gloves as she squeezes her purse so she wouldn't blurt out something silly. How she has missed him!
“Bold of you to assume I care about your opinion enough to spend my time with people you don’t like, just hoping you’ll see me.”
him, he had taken over my body, and he was going to hunt down all the traitors, and you… You didn’t know it wasn’t me, you thought I’d survived the crash.”
Harry ran straight into someone and found himself looking up at Draco’s gray eyes. They widened in surprise or confusion as he probably noticed how bloodshot Harry’s eyes were.
“You must be quite familiar with dark magic to be aware of this mirror," she said and stood up, her r’s rolling as she spoke. She gave Draco a once-over. “Blonde hair, dressed in black and all this,
“You’re kidding, right?” Harry sneered. “I don’t know how well Ron hides his prejudice when he’s with you, but I was there when he found out about Dean and Seamus and let me tell you, it wasn’t exactly what you’d call ‘being okay with it’.”
"I will hear no complaints about it! The rule is absolute. It's bad enough that I'm veering from the curriculum. I don't need ten Ministry officials on my back after one of you accidentally uses magic in the middle of a hospital."
"I do," Harry said, his lips pursing together at the memory. "Bellatrix threw a dagger at us when we disapparated, and it… he…"
“What did I say to you and Ron? When you talked to me as Crabbe and Goyle? Fuck, I was cringey back then…”
“Yes, we’ve gone all out ever since…" Her eyes fixed back on Draco, perhaps to ponder his resemblance to his father. "Tell me, Draco, how does your family celebrate?”
“Potter," Draco whispered. “Potter!” He quickly placed Potter’s notebook on top of his head. He startled awake and caught the notebook in his hands just in time before Skepperus stopped in front of their desks.
“That maybe someone tipped the press off about you two," Seamus said. The only way he could have been referring to Neville more directly would have been to point at him.
“Why I’m ever so sorry," Draco huffed sarcastically and threw Harry’s wand on the bed where neither of them could easily reach it.
“Harry," Draco sighed. “That wasn’t the apology. That was me saying sorry I woke you up in the middle of the night.”
“What?” Harry said, sure that his brain had somehow managed to completely mishear what Malfoy had said.
Despite Harry almost losing his faith once or twice, midnight did come. Harry was so eager to hear what kind of plan Malfoy had come up with that he arrived to the courtyard fifteen minutes early. He was surprised to see Malfoy was there already, leaning onto a column. He was dressed in the same outfit Harry had seen him wear at the lab, and it would’ve been difficult to see him in the dark if it wasn’t for his platinum hair that gleamed silvery in the moonlight. Malfoy glanced at his watch when he saw Harry approaching.
Harry is quiet, watching two girls spinning on the merry-go-round. Malfoy’s fingers are still tracing Harry’s palm… although it has long since stopped feeling like the fingers of a Healer on his patient. But not
“I went to some Muggle pub last night. Met a guy, went home with him and let him fuck me. I’m not really feeling very good about myself right now.”
“Hermione, I think I would spoil them rotten.” His heart takes flight at the thought. “If there’s one good thing my parents taught me, it’s how to spoil a child.”
They land in the front hall of Grimmauld Place, Weasley frowning and Draco shaking, gasping for air, tears streaming down his face. For a long moment they stand like that, Weasley’s hand still firmly on Draco’s.
“Not so much them. I know they’re not really leaving…. But my parents. Sirius. Remus. Dumbledore. Even Snape! They all left me!”
“I will hear anything you want to tell me.” Harry’s fingers tighten on his. “Now… or later. Whenever you want.”
know Harry Potter. Nor can he think of any circumstance where he would turn him over to the Dark Lord to be murdered… slowly and painfully… to be gone, forever, from his life.
Draco abandons his breakfast… and the paper… and goes out into the garden. When Weasley finds him, he is sitting under his roses, watching a bee buzzing inside one of the whitest of the white flowers. It is too hot for the blanket, but it’s wrapped in it anyway.
“I used to want to play Quidditch,” Draco says, slightly wistfully. “My father would never have let me go pro, of course, but I could have played for England. I was
He’s leaning on the sink, the water he’s splashed himself with still running. The man staring back at him is drained of color… just green eyes staring out of a face he doesn’t recognize.
Suddenly I realize that Victoire is standing beside me. “Uncle Harry? I think you should kiss him now.”
Potter watches him a moment, his expression impassive, before stopping all movement with a firm grip on his jaw. Potter’s thumb presses on the fading bruise under his eye… compliments of a man who thought that the word, “no” didn’t apply to him.
“It doesn’t have to mean anything.” The words fall out of my mouth in an undignified heap. “It could just be me thanking you for everything you did yesterday. And this morning.”
“What if your parents weren’t there? What if you’d been raised in a Muggle orphanage? Or with relatives who resented you?”
The force of his landing drove all the remaining air from his lungs. He gasped, unable even to cry out, as the cell door closed with a very final crash. He was in the dungeons of Malfoy Manor… cold, alone, and bleeding. Agony flooded him, body and soul.
Weasley and Granger seem to live in the house with Harry, but he doesn’t see much of them. Weasley, he gathers, is an Auror; Granger works in the Department of Magical Legal Affairs.
Draco isn’t sure he could cope. It’s a testament, he thinks, to how awful his Sixth and Seventh Years were that he ever managed to snatch
Malfoy’s eyes are grey, more fog than storm, and flecked with hints of blue and green and even lavender. When he speaks his voice is ragged. “I… I think I’ll have that shower now.”
Draco found the Dark Lord in the drawing room. His parents and several other Death Eaters were in attendance, though his mother’s eyes flicking over him were the only acknowledgement he received.
Harry’s arms come around Draco as Draco holds him close, rubbing his back, making shushing noises, and kissing Harry’s forehead over and over.
It says so… in silvery scars of messy handwriting etched onto the back of his fucking hand. Draco can see it clearly—the hand has wrapped itself around the bars of his cell.
is really gone,” he whispers. “I can’t believe everyone is safe. I want to floo Molly… or Andromeda, just to make sure she and Teddy really are safe.” He says it to the fire.
Draco lets out the breath he has been holding. He’s not sure what he would have done if Harry had said yes. “I… I’m sorry.”
Harry has mixed feelings about the flat, but it’s all he can afford without a trip to Gringotts, which would alert the Wizarding world to his presence and entirely defeat the purpose of a Muggle flat in the first place.
Harry waits until he can’t hear Malfoy’s tread on the stairs… before slamming his hand down on the kitchen table.
He lay there in the darkness, every scream, every sob wrong from him, with his head in Harry’s lap. One of Harry’s hands gently carded Draco’s hair. Draco couldn’t bear to move.
“I don’t know… We’d been working the case for a while… the model, obviously magic was involved… and I saw the way he looked at you… it was a hunch, I guess. I followed through.”
Potter wasn’t looking into his eyes, anymore. He was looking at his chest. “I did this,” he said, reaching for the scars that crisscrossed his chest… where the curse had missed his heart by millimeters.
Before Draco decided not to show up for their normal after-curfew meeting, before Harry followed him into the bathroom, before Draco pointed his wand at Harry and shouted,
gentle and he had a preference for one of the emaciated models, one of the ones where it wasn’t immediately obvious if they were male or female.
“You have been kind of busy,” Draco says, running his fingers down Harry’s chest. They are both barefoot and bare chested, together on Harry’s bed, but Harry’s ratty jeans and Draco’s tailored trousers have remained firmly in place. They are alone in the room, and probably in the whole dormitory; most people have gone home for the weekend—an Eighth Year privilege.
Draco was gone; that much was inescapably clear. The Dark Lord had ruthlessly called Draco to him and the call had gone unanswered. Severus could only hope that Hermione had found the spell needed to dampen the pain. Kreacher was to leave it in a fairly obvious location and Hermione was a smart witch; she would know what would happen to Draco should he ignore the Dark Lord’s summons. It was a supremely difficult spell… but he had complete faith in her.
He is always so careful not to push, but sometimes Draco almost wishes that Harry would just grab him and shove him against the wall and
Ron spoke quietly. Harry’s exclamation of horror at that statement had overwrought the elf to such a degree that he had nearly bashed his head into unconsciousness before Harry managed to stop him. Harry had forbidden the elf to punish himself over it, though the way house-elves seemed to operate, Ron thought it was completely possible that Kreacher might well take it upon himself to punish himself for the original transgression, and then punish himself for punishing himself against orders.
He watches Malfoy snatch at them before they are caught by the breeze. He watches him wince. Badly. He watches as Malfoy’s hair falls back from his face, revealing two tracks of porcelain, one from each eye.
He leans over to kiss Harry. Harry doesn’t try to touch him… with anything other than his tongue, which strokes Draco’s own tongue, licks gently at his lips… almost, but not quite, making Draco forget what he is doing.
Draco wonders why it took Harry so long to come back… had Luna decided that he needed some time alone and simply delayed in telling Harry that he had left? Had she delivered his message with enough calmness that Harry stayed, sure that Draco was fine, to finish his beer and hear the rest of Finnegan’s jokes?
in joined-up purple letters and shows a picture of a frightened-looking girl staring out of a cut-out in the cover.
“You’re moving out?” Draco asks, suddenly feeling as though the world has tipped, alarmingly, to one side.
Crusty pans sit on the stove, and the sink is overflowing with dirty dishes and empty wine bottles. A bin in the corner is also overflowing with more wine bottles and boxes of something claiming to be Cheesy Mac—whatever the hell
Three days, and Draco refuses to know how many clients later, Draco drinks yet another beakerful of Polyjuice potion… and it is a long time before he realizes that
“It wasn’t fair,” Harry says. He is now bowed so low his forehead is almost touching Draco’s knees. “It wasn’t fair for him… it wasn’t fair for you. You don’t know how
Harry reaches up, threading his fingers through the hand on his cheek. “I hurt you… and still you made me feel cherished…
surprised to find both boys in the same bed, darker arms entwined with ghostly pale ones. The fact that both of them looked as though they hadn’t slept more than half an hour, and that they both had tear drops glistening on closed eyelids, broke his heart.
It’s a good thing I’m good at defeating dark lords and sculpting, because hair dressing is not for me. I can create a plate or a pot or a fucking unicorn out of a lump of clay… or, you know, fight against the most evil Wizarding regime in recent history… but apparently I cannot twist silky blond hair into a braid.
Harry winds up seeing the nurse practitioner… a woman called O’Brien. She’s probably not more than a dozen years older than he is, and she has silvery blue hair, a nose ring, and an intricate tattoo sleeve on one arm that seems to center around a goldfish with flowing fins. She has a warm smile and very cold hands.
Malfoy still doesn’t say anything and Harry begins to unbutton his shirt. He slips it off and it puddles, unheeded, on the tile.

He isn’t. The healing and nourishing potions have been working miracles… but Draco is far, far from healed.
“It’s going to be okay.” He is cupping Draco’s cheek, ever so gently… his fingers tracing his jaw. And Draco finds that he doesn’t mind the touch. He leans into it. “I promise.”
His hands are shaking and tears are threatening to overflow his eyes by the time he makes it to the tiny row of tables that runs along the edge of the market. He sits at the first empty one he comes to.
The boy was breathing. And making ragged little noises that might have been stifled sobs… or a death rattle. Severus wasn’t sure.
At first Charlie leads the way, with Harry following, mutely, behind… then shoulder-to-shoulder, and finally holding hands. Words become a part of Harry’s life again. He doesn’t talk about the War… about England… about the people he left behind, but he will call out, drawing Charlie’s attention to a particularly brilliant leaf or a stone that sparkles in the creek bed. Harry begins to sleep at night, and when his nightmares get the better of him, he lets Charlie hold him close, smoothing his hair, whispering words he doesn’t understand, words said with rhythm, but no melody; they could be Cornish, they could be Romanian… Harry can’t tell, and doesn’t ask. He just snuggles closer. Even at night, Charlie smells like sunshine… and leather and singed fabric.
“I think I have some sort of block about that spell,” I say. “I always wind up doing them the regular way. The Muggle way.”
Draco sits up and catches Harry’s eyes in his own. They are so beautiful: emerald, yes, but with flecks of turquoise and even amber. He memorizes every detail, every highlight, every sparkle… because he knows Harry will not come back… not to someone whom he cannot touch without hurting.
choke on his pancakes, though can feel himself turning a color that probably perfectly matches the jam.
The shadows in the library are thick… his illumination charm must be wearing off… but when Harry raises his head he can see Harry’s eyes, bright and green and brimming with tears. He looks so young. Maybe even younger than the first time they kissed. “I
The thought makes his hands shake. He tries not to see snakes in the flames, hissing in Parseltongue, hissing in Voldemort’s voice. He tries not to see the faces of the dead… Dumbledore… Snape…
Draco turns his left arm over, the movement sharp, almost violent. The Dark Mark stands out black against white skin.
Harry snorts and continues his kisses, up Draco’s arm, running his tongue along the edge of his bicep, nibbling along his collarbone.
Draco does wait. Harry’s voice sounds… fragile. And it is all Draco’s fault. He turns, setting his books back on the desk. “Harry, you idiot. You
He has spent hours there… letting day become night and autumn become winter. Making coffee and serving snacks. Sipping tea. Reading before the fire.
have to work! And I don’t want you to!” Harry’s voice is rising toward a shout. Lisbeth lets out a little growl.
Draco came back to himself with a piece of the castle digging into his back, Harry’s hand still on him, in a corridor that they were just plain
Harry’s fingers continue tracing, then they yield to his mouth, warm and wet and tender. As his tongue traces the underside of the scar, Draco gasps, a high tiny sound accompanying the sensation of every nerve he has dancing just a little.
“Then he’s an idiot. That guy… he has no idea… Harry…” Malfoy takes a deep breath. His eyes are wide and pale grey. “Harry
“Thank you, Nicholas.” He carefully attaches the letter. “Potter will take care of you… feed you, let you rest. You don’t have to rush back until you’ve rested properly.”
Draco can never quite suppress the wary look that crosses his face whenever the bell above the door rings… though he does not usually find it difficult to assist the occasional customer.  While Mr. Ainsworth seems to be on a first name basis with all of the long-dead authors, his grasp on most of the contents of his store is shaky. Draco often finds himself filling in the gaps.
Draco was shaking, almost violently, now and Harry could feel the tears tracking down the other boy’s face.
Grimmauld Place is grand, if you like macabre Victorian as a decorating style, but Draco is unable to tell if the neighborhood surrounding it ever matched. In any case, most of the neighboring houses are broken into small flats, and the street hovers right on the border between quaint and slummy.
and pulls out his wand. He makes a number of complicated gestures, plays a few cords, repeats the spell, and plays a few more cords.
they asked of him… just so he could make his reparations payment, just so he wouldn’t have to spend the rest of his life in Azkaban. With a sick twist in his stomach, he knew he would have signed Elladora’s contract whatever it said…but he did read it first.
Potter leans in, his lips soft against Draco’s. It’s less a kiss than a suggestion of a kiss… a taste of a kiss… a
The little kennels they keep the dogs in are eerily similar to the white, windowless room Elladora kept him in… save that, in the top half of the doors, there are small, bared windows.
He lies about his ability to bring the Death Eaters into the school… until that awful moment when he isn’t lying anymore, and he turns a werewolf loose among his classmates. When he lets Death Eaters into his school to torture and maim. That ends with Dumbledore dead and Draco running for his life.

Potter’s obvious anguish disconcerted Draco. “Well,” he said a little shakily, “we’ve always had a special kind of relationship, haven’t we?”
had been during those endless three days… the days in between when Draco thought he would never see Harry again, and when Harry pushed open the door, held him in his arms, and promised that everything was all right.
Harry just holds him tighter, his face buried in Draco’s neck. When Harry breaks free, Draco’s shirt is damp. Harry palms the tears off his cheeks. “Are you still going to work for Mr. Ainsworth?” he asks, tentatively. Hesitantly.
They are silent for the longest time, listening to the night sounds and the soft laughter coming out of the kitchen.
Draco could see green eyes, looking wide and almost… frightened… sweeping over him. “Malfoy… are you okay?”
And he’s not really surprised to find Harry looking not very rumpled at all and wearing a sport coat. The table is set and the candles are lit and Harry is pouring wine when he walks in.
, even knowing all the horrible things he’d done, they just let him go. He disappeared then. Into Muggle London, some say. No one’s heard from him since.
He doesn’t even bother questioning why he doesn’t need space from Draco… why Draco now has a key to his flat when Ron doesn’t even know where it is.
The Weasleys aren’t at home today and Harry and Draco are alone in the shed. Draco thinks Harry should have waited to start the project until school ended… and he
He brings Harry’s hand to his lips and kisses the knuckles. Apologizing isn’t his strong suit… which is too bad, given the way he’s prone to lashing out whenever he’s hurt or afraid.
He’d always secretly loved that the gallery was so vast, that it gave him so much space to walk. There were worse ways to pass the night.
Millie waved a hand. “The usual, I’m sure. They’ve kept buzz going in the press about Potter being off on some grand secret mission. Perhaps this will be his grand return, flanked by… I don’t know. His retrieval team?” She shrugged. “He usually manages something half decent.”
He thinks of Malfoy’s inner thigh. Wants to know if the bruises are still there. If he’ll be permitted to leave more.
“Thank you for dinner.” She seemed equally determined to leave and to avoid burning any bridges, and stiffly nodded her thanks.
Unfinished business is a prime example of exactly that sort of thing. Which is why he finds himself, freezing in silk pyjamas, reading glasses still perched on his nose, trudging to the Owlery before sunrise with a letter in hand.
Malfoy paused, waiting for guidance. His pupils were dilated. His lips were full. His pale skin was flushed. His chest rose and fell, his breath heavy with want.
Draco saw more than one member dabbing at their eyes. But as long as Harry went on, he found he couldn’t summon a cynical reaction. Their tears were genuine, as was the tight knot that Draco realised had taken root in his chest.
When he reached the bottom of the staircase the next morning, Draco looked longingly at the corridor towards Potter’s rooms. That was down to his continued unease, in part. Concern for his patient. But thoughts of the Ministry officials waiting in the music room did not inspire eagerness.
Potter’s still looking nervous, now with a hint of the caged animal about him. “How should I know? It’s a black napkin.”
As usual, Potter was sitting in a bergère next to the windows, a book open in his lap. He had given up on any attempt to read, though. He worried the edge of the pages and stared into the middle distance, seemingly oblivious to both of them.
“If you could be assured that none of those charities will rely on Ministry funding in the new year, that all of their fundraising goals will be met this season, would you support his recovery? His proper, gradual, time-consuming recovery?”
Draco pulls an identical cloak from the second box and shrugs it over his shoulders. With a raised eyebrow and a gesture, he indicates that Harry ought to do the same.
Malfoy nodded once, approvingly, and spread his legs, so that the outside of his thighs pressed against the inside of Harry's. "As you were."
“The choices we made,” he nodded his recognition at Greg and Pansy, “they were beyond our control. There were no other answers then. There are, now, and there could be more. I think he just doesn’t want to hear them.”
This time he catches my eye as he moves. He brings his hands to the untucked hem of my shirt. He doesn’t look away as he unbuttons it. Not when he fumbles. Not when I gasp, reflexively, when his knuckles brush my chest. Not when he pushes it off my shoulders and runs his hands down my arms. His fingertips are deliciously calloused, his hands perfectly firm. He doesn’t stop until his fingers are linked in mine. “If we’re doing this, it’s together.”
Ten minutes in, he reached for his wand and Summoned his whisky. His mind began to wander. He reviewed their conversation. Harry’s admission. His flush in the firelight. The roses. Harry’s reaction to Draco leaving, and the way Harry had left afterwards.
. Once they’re a year old he can dispose of them, and thank Merlin there are so many. He tips them down the chute and waits. There’s a quick fluttering as pages try to break away and then, two seconds later, a resounding thud.
“Yeah.” Harry paused, rested his fork on the edge of his plate. “Does it make sense, why I couldn’t see you?”
Blaise set wards to fall at midnight exactly and made sure to have Neville on his back, cock-deep in Blaise’s arse, when I walked into the room. Sexual genius that he is, Blaise even managed to “fall” with his mouth on Neville’s cock when Longbottom started to panic. Made for a
Lifting his wand, he levitates the item and it falls into shape instantly. It's a pair of handcuffs. Well. Hogwarts students must be getting up to considerably more interesting things nowadays than he ever did at that age.
It’s cold on his fingers. He grabs his wand to warm the lube, casts protection spells while he’s at it.
, and it’s almost as if Harry wanted him to see it. Higsbee may be finding himself in biscuits for life.
“Yes.” He blinked. “Yes, of course. I’m sorry. Merlin, Malfoy. I mean, Dr Malfoy. I’m so sorry. I’ll—Have the cost of the repair billed to my vault. Please. It’s the least I can do.”
Draco took a deep, deep sip of his Ogden’s. “I have no intention of going to Azkaban. Nor could I confess to understanding how you get from dinner with a former schoolmate to prison sentences.”
Beyond the doorway, Draco clears his throat. “If there’s anything else I can do, please don’t hesitate to come again.”
“Christmas, Easter. There’s a heart-shaped one – maybe that’s Valentine’s Day? And then there’s one that kind of stands up, you know, it’s curved around the edges, but it’s got a hole in the middle.”
The depth of Potter’s resignation was still thoroughly surreal. Draco scrambled for purchase. “No, I don’t believe it would be. But it’s possible.”
In the long seconds it took him to realise what he was seeing, the joy vanished from Potter’s face, replaced first with guilt, then anger.
“As you pointed out, each of us is liable to miss certain items, at least if your book-purchasing claims are to be believed.”
Before they could recover the pursuit of Harry, Weasley whispered something in his ear and commanded his guard to change formation. They formed a triangle around Harry, with Finnigan and Goshawk just behind him and to the side, Wilkins in front, and Weasley in front of her.
Once Draco had established that words were not immediately forthcoming, he dropped his hands to his blotter and folded them neatly. “Of course, I’m stuck with the Arnage until they’ve finished the custom interior. Then it’s on to planes, I think. I can use the company jet, of course, but they’re still on the Learjet 40, and those have been around since… well, let’s just say that if he’d had more of a sense of style and a bit less priggishness about their origin – and any money of his own to speak of, obviously – they’re so old that the Dark Tosser could’ve had one of his own. And they only seat seven. Seven! The Bombardier Challenger 300 can fit twice as many.” He paused. “Still, it’s American...”
“It wants to be with its master. Granger noticed—oh, don’t make that noise, she’s a lot cleverer than you like to admit.”
“It wasn’t even about Granger. I merely indicated, jokingly, as one does, some very small amount of surprise that Potter was capable of feeding himself without her assistance.”
“None the first six months or the last six months. She was a tough act to follow, our Pans.” Blaise smiles at her fondly, though she’s now lost in the magazine. “And once I was determined to have her back, no one else would do.”
I press myself against him, free hand drawing him closer by the belt loops. His breath smells of whisky, his neck of fresh aftershave. “That so?”
Malfoy groaned when Harry's tongue made contact, and then again when Harry hummed in pleasure at the sound. Malfoy tasted like salt and skin, and his rim was tight around the tip of Harry's tongue. Malfoy tensed again, but Harry persisted, holding Malfoy open and licking a broad stripe over his hole. He heard Malfoy gasp and felt him press back, and Harry redoubled his efforts, making circles around the softening muscled, and then pushing in with his tongue, and when he looked up he could see Malfoy’s hands gripping on to his suit jacket, the wool bunched tight in his bound fingers. The view was enough to make Harry pull back, teasing Malfoy with just the tip of his tongue so he could watch how the fabric twisted under Malfoy's hands. It didn't last long; Malfoy pressed back into his mouth, rolling his hips for more.
“One, I can spell perfectly well, thank you. Two, I’ve been yelling for you from outside for ages. Three, it’s not a pile of rubbish.”
“Please. Granger would try to reorganise the place, nosy witch. Lovegood would spend the whole time trying to talk to the glassware.” Draco has hit his stride; the tips of Potter’s ears are getting red. It feels good, feels familiar, and the words keep tumbling out. “Longbottom would trip into a shelf and send the whole room crashing to the ground, at which point Finnigan would blow it up. The various Weasleys would confuse it with a charity shop –”
He felt Luna at one side and Ron at the other, and he didn’t think he would have got to the table without them.
I thought I had seen it all, had it all, when we made love the last time. The first time. Being with him was so different from anything I’d experienced before. He was so open, so vulnerable, so thoroughly naked. I’d imagined that’s what it would be.
It was shocking, that. The paint had begun to dry; it picked up every draught and left every hair standing on end, left me trembling for the heat of his touch. And then it was there, hot, wet, trailing over the one expanse that had remained unmarked.
He won’t buck his hips, either. Or, he doesn’t plan to, but when Potter runs his nails down Draco’s front, he can’t quite help it. Even through the fabric of his shirt, he can feel the warmth of Potter’s fingertips. Potter pulls open his belt buckle and unzips his flies. Draco closes his eyes tight.
Higsbee continues to be subtly tolerable. Draco finds himself with several new items to review each day. Among them are pictures of Jordan and Tremlett at a WWN fundraiser and a blind item from the
A million words vied for position on the tip of Harry’s tongue. He wanted something equivocal and safe.
Which is how this is supposed to go anyway. He knows this. There’s a similar story meant for him. Granted, with a lot less niceness and public approval and a lot more closing his eyes and thinking of the line, but that’s the order of things and he
Draco doesn’t say anything about St. Mungo’s… but Harry almost wishes he would. He was sick again this morning.
“Yeah.” Harry holds out his other arm, and Malfoy draws his finger down the mark, long and twisting, where Wormtail cut him that night in the graveyard; Malfoy’s expression is very shuttered. Harry thinks he knows why… it’s where a Dark Mark would be… if he had one. It even has the same curl at the bottom.
Harry is sitting on the bed, leaning against the wall, his Potions notes spread out before him. He looks up and blinks twice.
Harry turned to add the dittany to the bath. Then he tested the temperature of the water, first with his wand, then with his hand.
Draco picks up the top one… and stares. It’s one of mine, speckled grey clay fired with real hawthorn leaves still pressed into the clay. The ghosts of the leaves, perfect shadows, are left behind.
“Hello, Potter.” Draco’s voice comes from somewhere behind my right shoulder. He is using the drawling tone he used as a Hogwarts prefect and…
That’s not entirely true. The model the man preferred could have been a caricature of the man Draco is. Draco has seen the picture—the model is excruciatingly thin, all points and angles, pale to the point of ashen, with bleach-blond hair and almost colorless eyes.
The War Orphans Charity is headed by Draco’s Aunt Andromeda—helping both Wizarding children and Muggleborn children, most of whom were too young to even know they were witches or wizards until their families were killed. They want to build a proper orphanage and Draco’s main objective tonight is to use Harry’s fame and the goodwill surrounding his name to see that sizable donations are made. His minor objectives include not being called a Death Eater, not eating anything containing quince jelly, and arriving home in time to make love to is boyfriend
There is a final thrust, a groan that is not his, and a moment of absolute stillness. The hands release him as suddenly as the grabbed him.
Elladora is practiced with the Cruciatius Curse… not quite to the extent of, say, Bellatrix, but she is more than capable of making Draco wish he had never laid eyes on her… making him wish that he had just gone quietly to Azkaban.
Potter turns and pulls a set of fluffy white towels out of a cupboard. “The bathroom’s just here,” he says, pressing a switch and illuminating a tidy room with a white-tiled shower. “I’ll leave some things on the bed for you. Don’t mind the cat; she’s friendly. Her name’s Athena. Take your time and come down when you’re ready.”
Abraxas Malfoy had been an arse. He had also been one of the Dark Lord’s earliest supporters, and Severus began to feel a very real fear that Draco was going to die right there at his gravesite.
But no more strangers. No more Firewhiskey. No more passing out. If I drink, it will be wine with dinner… a few pints with friends at the Leaky Cauldron.
There is no room here for Harry Potter… the teenager… the (pretend) university student… the boy who works in the coffee shop and drinks chai tea and reads romance novels and has a newfound love for Indian food. There is no room for the Harry Potter who is terrified and slightly nauseated.
An emotion Draco can’t name wells up inside of him. The eyes aren’t enough. He reaches for Harry’s hand, intertwining their fingers. “I love you,” he whispers. It is a poor substitution for what he is feeling… what he wishes he could put into words, or even thoughts... but it is also the truth.
Harry is surprised to find himself waiting for Malfoy to come into the coffee shop… something he does most days, often twice a day. Malfoy the nursing student is soft-spoken and kind—he always holds the door for people, never places an order without a “please” and “thank you”, and once Harry watched him chase a woman half-way down the block, holding the pink stuffed bunny that had fallen from her child’s pram.
Draco took a deep breath. Whatever else it was, it smelled delicious. The hunger that normally clawed at his belly, insisting on food, but then rejecting nearly everything was as eager to eat this… pizza… as he was.
, Draco realizes, and there is a planet and a spaceship and another spaceship, seemingly endless, that is firing lasers at the smaller ship.
Weasley hands it to him and then takes a few steps back, giving him the space he so desperately needs. The fact that he cannot stand to have Weasley within arms’ reach when he had a complete stranger
earlier… before Draco had needed to stop. He’s far more afraid of hurting Harry than of being hurt himself.
Draco doesn’t want to let it go… Harry can tell. He’s almost vibrating with the need to ask more questions. Instead Draco takes a deep breath.
Harry can feel Draco’s hand beginning to tremble on his shoulder, but when he speaks it’s with his normal, collected voice. “I wouldn’t let anything… anyone, even myself… hurt Harry.”
… the bed he is in, the walls, even the sky outside is a sort of greyish white. Morning, but foggy. The couch across the room is white, the counter in the little kitchenette… white marble.
Draco lifts his eyes… and finds Weasley’s staring back at him… eyes wide and blue, anger and a helpless despair scrawled across his face.
I, on the other hand, after the whole dark lord-slaying thing, discovered the joys of working with my hands, of creating beautiful things out of lumps of clay… I have literally become a
she wants me to be happy… but she just doesn’t see how any of this… how even being a Healer, much less a Muggle nurse, could possibly make me happy. She doesn’t understand how hard I work… she doesn’t understand
“Yes,” Draco says with authority. He wanders the shop for a few minutes, running his fingers over the spines of the books…
Malfoy takes two unsteady steps into the bathroom, toes off his trainers and, turning a bit sideways, slips off his trousers.
He barely slept. He forced himself to eat the charred meat and greasy potato sticks because one meal per shift was part of his pay.
Draco’s probably far too cold… far too hungry… for a proper Disillusionment charm, but given half a chance, he might have been able to fade a little into the background as Potter walked by.
The shopkeeper chuckles gently. “Fiction is down here. Non-fiction is upstairs. I’ll be right here if you need me, boys.”
Behind her, Draco is standing in the doorway, for once free of his satchel full of textbooks. He’ll have just finished his last exam. He should be looking as relaxed and carefree as Harry has ever seen him. Instead he’s white as a ghost.
The ring is titanium and holly wood with an inlay of raw emeralds as bright and beautiful as Harry’s eyes.
“I want you to come,” Harry says, his words muffled. They are muffled because Harry’s mouth is still
Victoire doesn’t care, of course, but we’ve stayed too long at the park for me to have a chance to tidy… anything, really. There are dirty dishes in the sink.
The look of revulsion mixed with a crushing sympathy, combined with the sound of his name on the lips of
Much to Draco’s surprise, Lisbeth has taken two bold steps forward and is presenting herself for a petting, her black fur all but glistening in the sunshine.
The sun is hot on his neck and Draco can feel the skin burning. He can feel the tears running down his cheeks, feel the cracks in his heart.
Fleur is home, but I said I would pick up Victoire anyway. Fleur was up most of the night last night, after all.
Potter lets him, his body tense, almost too tense for Draco to notice the little shivers that run through it when he touches an especially sensitive spot. He is waiting for the pain he asked for…
was deserted. Harry’s pupils were blown wide and the expression on his face was one of awe, not horror.
wear trainers to pick up a child from school… though I have gone to the trouble of finding a nice, clay-free jumper to wear.
“I… I think so. It’s mine now. But I haven’t been back… Maybe it has too many awful memories… maybe I should just let it rot… But if I
Harry feels the surreptitious touch of Malfoy’s wand, then the cold trickle of a disinfecting charm, then a pinch, then… nothing.
… the boy who refused, in front of everyone, to shake his hand; the boy who laughed when he was turned into a ferret; the boy who beat him to the snitch every single Quidditch game they ever played; the boy who cast an unknown curse, slicing open his chest; the boy who flew through fire to save his life…
Harry’s won’t be a problem. They’re simple enough… Harry won’t wear anything more eye-catching than simple (though extremely well-made) robes. Actually, he would buy something off the rack if Draco would let him; Draco doesn’t. Harry's dress robes resemble nothing more flashy than the simplest Muggle tuxedo—black robes, black tie, with a plain-front shirt, a simple collar—not a speck of color anywhere, save for his eyes, glowing like green jewels from behind his glasses. The shirt can be ironed in moments, the trousers and vest will be fine, Draco took great care when he hung them up after their last gala, the robe may need the smallest touch-up.
Once it was blood. Umbridge made him scratch the words out, writing them over and over in his own blood… until they would never fade.
Something stirs in Draco’s stomach… butterflies… or fire-breathing dragons? Or fire-breathing dragons devouring butterflies?
“Yeah. That’s something,” Ron said, feeling a bit like he was lying. “’Course, walking into Malfoy Manor… that’d be just as bad as going to knock on the door of You-Know-Who’s hideout.”
Luna he doesn’t mind, nor Neville and Ginny. But he finds Dean Thomas and Seamus Finnegan to be a bit too much… especially Finnegan with his loud laugh and his propensity to touch
”Going on five years.” Lance laughs again. “Lucky he travels a lot. For business, you know? Keeps me from getting bored.”
… together into something almost tangible, almost visible. Head bent low, Malfoy’s fingers crash onto the keys. One of the books on the piano slithers towards the edge and tips, unheard, onto the floor.
Thank you to everyone who left comments on Chapter One! I love questions, comments, and constructive criticism!!!
He stands up before the Wizengamot and a courtroom packed full of observers, most of whom would wish to see Draco locked up forever in Azkaban, and explains how Draco was
Yes, he had a stomach bug… he got sick at work… it was embarrassing… but that was almost two weeks ago. And he’s still not feeling right. The exhaustion lingers and the nausea hasn’t really cleared up—a couple mornings he’s even vomited again, though, thankfully not at work.
“Draco…,” Harry begins, but the words fall away… For a moment he says nothing, does nothing, and the next thing Harry’s eyes blaze green and Harry’s mouth is descending on his.
too long; he probably should have let Hermione cut it when she offered. Then he dressed in those jeans and his favorite of the new button-down shirts she bought him. He checked that he had some Muggle money and walked to the front door. He opened it, took a deep breath, and shut it again. Twice more, he opened the door, the second time stepping out onto the stoop, before going back inside.
Draco is gentle with Harry… taking the time to kiss and caress every inch of him before opening him carefully.
“Were you really?” Harry asks, wiping his eyes, roughly, with the back of his hand. “Would the spell have even worked?”
“I know,” Draco says, the words still not coming easily to him. “I did read the contract before I signed it.”
sorry.” Draco takes a deep breath, then kisses Harry’s hand again… rather than raising his eyes to meet Harry’s.
His Aunt Andromeda smiles and sets out tea and doesn’t say anything about the fact that she was disowned by Draco’s grandparents, or that during the war Draco was on the side that murdered her
He’s exhausted, but not sleepy… and feels gritty and knows he smells less than fresh. He never changed into pajamas last night… and has now been wearing the same clothes for almost thirty-six hours straight.
She showed him how to move the hot iron across the fabric, using his fingers to smooth if first, then hold it flat, moving them only at the last second.
Elladora rarely thinks it’s worth it to give him healing potions. If she gives him a bruise-healing potion, he cannot take Polyjuice for twelve hours, for twenty-four hours if she gives him Skele-Gro. If it’s physically possible for Draco to work, she sends him clients, expecting him to simply
“Ah, that’s right,” Professor Hastings says. “Excellent school. We were very lucky to get Mr. Malfoy, here. Were you on the rugby team, also, Mr. Potter?”
The woman behind the counter is saggy in all the wrong places, her greying hair sporting two light blue stripes that frame her face. She has an eyebrow ring, two nose rings, and three rings piercing her lower lip. “What can I get you, love?” she asks.
“He hanged himself,” Harry says quietly, not looking at Draco. “Just about the time you disappeared. He couldn’t make his payments either and he chose… differently….”
“The Wizarding World can go fuck itself.” Harry’s words are harsh, but the hand that reaches out… that pulls him back… that cups his cheek… is gentle. “You aren’t a Death Eater… you never were. Not really. And I don’t want to be with without you. Ever.”
“You held me,” he says softly, stroking Harry’s knuckles, still not looking up. “At… Elladora’s… when you didn’t even know it
Draco squeezes back and forces his throat to open, forces his voice to obey him. “Cappuccino, please.”
The thought that must have written itself right across my face, judging by Draco’s suddenly dancing eyes.
In the darkness, Harry whispered something. Draco’s eyes cooled and his nose, sinuses, everything cleared. He could breathe easily again.
Draco’s been coming over most evenings. Ostensibly to play the piano, but they both know he’s there to check up on Harry.
He’s like one of the wounded dragons Charlie nurses back to health before returning them to the wild. The thought is mildly embarrassing, but Harry can’t find it within himself to feel anything but grateful.
In two strides, Harry is across the kitchen. He yanks open a cupboard door and pulls out a glass and a bottle of wine. He pours wine into the glass, gulps a bit, and then throws the glass as hard as he can against the wall.
Four doors lead off the landing: two are shut tight, another is open, revealing an unmade bed and heaps of dirty laundry, and the final, also open, is a large, grubby bath.
“What do you want, Potter? I’m busy. First I have to finish weeding your garden, then I have to make your dinner, and then I have to let you fuck me into the mattress. Or is there something
It wasn’t even particularly unjust. Macnair was the worst sort of man… vile and sadistic. And it made Severus ill to think that Draco had been given to him, that he had been allowed to rape the poor boy over and over….
Lisbeth’s nose twitches a little and she slinks, her nose pushed far out in front of her, towards Harry. She pushes right between Harry’s wrists and his chest, forcing his head out of his hands, forcing his eyes to lift to Draco’s.
, but this… this isn’t… right.” He bends down, scooping up the coat, holding it out. “This can’t happen.”
“There’s a lot of other stuff in the library… it’s on the first floor… but everything’s kind of… dusty.” He looks quite guilty. “Sorry.”
Potter looks even more guilty. “Look, just have a seat, okay? I’ll make us some…” he glances sort of helplessly around the room “…eggs.”
that had infuriated him so, made him want to kill him; he almost had, if he’s honest—and told him to go for a walk.
… not minding the rough flannel on his tongue, not minding that the floor is cold, not minding that Draco probably will not be able to return the favor.
In the Muggle world, Draco got up before sunrise to mop floors and move garbage from one place to another. Then he took money and handed people bits of charred meat and boxes of greasy potato sticks until after midnight.
The truly young went to guardians who were tasked with keeping them alive until they were old enough to begin their reparations work.
“I didn’t want you to be destitute… to feel like you had to stay because you had nowhere else to go… I was going to tell you. Maybe more gracefully than I did.”
The existence of the coffee shop is what makes it quaint, he supposes, pushing open the door, as if it were a perfectly normal thing to do—rather than a… quest… requiring every ounce of bravery Draco possesses.
, but it’s just not worth a life sentence in Azkaban… not for something that won’t do any good at all.”
“You’re excellent at Potions, and your hands move so perfectly, like a dance when you’re brewing… but you like Transfiguration more, and you like Charms even more, but you would never tell anyone because making a teacup waltz with a spoon is just too damn whimsical.... You turn up your nose at “pub food” and you won’t eat meat unless you absolutely have to and you love sweets. You know that treacle tart is my favorite, even though I never told you, and you used to bring it for us to share and then let me eat your piece too, which is how I knew, for the first time, that you loved me.”
“You don’t have to… you could… stay here. Forever, I mean.” Harry likes having Malfoy here. He feels
The white queen huffs at him, but he ignores her. He is looking down at the chess board… but not really seeing it.
He did it for the same reason that he is always first into the office in the mornings, and the reason he is always last to leave. The reason he always works harder than he needs to… maybe even harder than he
He doesn’t. Except to fist his fingers in the blankets. Even as he sobs out Draco’s name along with his release, his hips barely stutter.
under a warming charm, next to a note on which he scratched out the words “I love you” along with a promise to be back by lunchtime.
“Headmaster,” he says. “Sir, this is Harry Potter, come to collect Victoire Weasley. Her mother’s been called away to a family emergency.”
“I’m not sure it always works like that,” Draco says. “And you really have been busy. Saving the world and all that.”
Suddenly he misses Vince and Greg so much it hurts… Not the way they were at the end of a year of Death Eating… but before… when they were like big, lovable puppies, loyal and honest, following him everywhere. And he misses Pansy’s snide wit, and Blaise’s knowing smile, and Theo… who was just always
“Do you have any idea how beautiful you are?” Draco’s voice comes out as nothing more than a rough whisper.
He doesn’t know how long it lasts. Realistically, it can only be minutes… but it is the beginning and the end of his existence.
Malfoy nods—maybe he’s answering the question Harry didn’t ask, maybe it’s only a gesture of intensity as the music swells.
Harry’s fingers find the third scar, deceptively thin, deceptively straight… Harry sees it for what it is. “I could have killed you.”
actually an order—children walking in lines, children waving goodbye to their teachers and leaving with parents, children saying goodbye to their teachers at the gate and leaving alone, children getting into cars or being shunted onto squatty buses, children in the schoolyard on the swings or playing hopscotch. It’s like a too-colorful quilt. There is a pattern, it’s just that there’s too much going on all at once for that pattern to be comfortable.
nurses couldn’t make it in, and there were two separate emergencies just as I was getting ready to walk out the door. I’ve had a little less than ten hours of sleep, and I have to be at my next placement, which, thank Merlin, is only six hours long, in exactly nineteen minutes, which is the

“It has nothing to do with sewing. A novel. Entirely fiction… historical fiction. Empowered, slightly bossy female narrator; she’s a veteran of one of the Muggle wars. Ginger love interest. Stonehenge as a time-turner.” It
“Her mother is something like one-quarter Japanese.” Draco has the vague impression that Harry is stalling. “And Theo?”
“You’re not a Gryffindor,” Harry says, chasing his lips. “You’re a Slytherin. You lot are supposed to be all about self-preservation.”
Harry is still cupping his cheek, his fingers tangling in his hair. His hand is still trembling. “So good… touching me… feels so good…”
Draco has gone with Weasley to the coffee shop. Lately Weasley’s schedule has been changing with a regularity that irritates Draco… and he’s not even the one who has to live it. Still, he tries to accompany Weasley for his morning coffee. Whenever Weasley’s “morning” happens to be.
“I know what yesterday was,” Malfoy say softly, reaching over the counter to place his hand on Harry’s.
The curls say a hurried, but polite, thank you and greeting to the elderly gentleman before they throw themselves into Draco’s arms. “Uncle Draco! I’ve missed you!”
Draco will permit only one answer to that question. And, without bothering with the deep breath, he simply takes that last step off the stoop and onto the street.
“It’s hard to imagine the Savior of the Wizarding World having trouble finding a partner,” Draco says, a barb in his voice that he doesn’t bother trying to hide.
Leave it to Harry Potter to think he’s riding some sort of moral high-horse… when all he’s really doing is making things so much worse than they already are.
George, well, he’s not really in a place, mentally, to care for a child… and while there’s nothing wrong with Charlie’s mentality (unless you want to count the fact that he works with dragons for a living)… he
Chances are he would have been selling his body, anyway, to survive—but doing it cold and hungry in the darkest corners of Knockturn Alley. The Company provides him with food, shelter, and clients… and, the fact is, Draco is fucking
Harry hates them. Granger and Weasley hate them. Even Kingsley Shacklebolt hates them, Draco suspects. And yet everyone dresses in his or her finest and trots out to this function, or that charity event, with alarming regularity.
been others since him. Exactly two others. Four months with a blond-haired, grey-eyed Muggle with a sharp cheekbones and an even sharper sense of humor. And then the dark eyed, dark skinned Canadian wizard that I tried
He’s not making a judgment… both of them avoided Azkaban. But he is here, holding Harry’s hand as tightly as Harry is holding his.
Harry’s eyes really are beautiful, but they are closed now as he leans into Draco’s kisses. Draco tries to find his rhythm as he moves his lips against Harry’s, as their tongues dance… but he can’t quite. The movements aren’t natural, they feel
Malfoy turns over Harry’s hand, moving gentle fingers across his palm, where the cut had been. There’s no trace of it now.
If he did, there was a good chance Hermione would never speak to any of them—Ron, Harry, or Kreacher—ever again.
“Easy, Malfoy,” he says, his voice steady, calming. “There’s a bruise healing potion in that. I can give you some Skele-Gro, too, if you need it. But you’ll have to take
The idea of touching the Dark Mark twists uncomfortably in Harry’s stomach; the idea of kissing it, nauseates him.
He awakes to Harry’s kiss on his temple. “I’m sorry. I would stay if I could… I would let you sleep for hours like that… if she’d let me.”
“I… er… do…” Fleur told me what to say, so that Victoire would know that her mother really meant for her to go with me. But… I glance at the very obviously Muggle headmaster. “Do you want me to ask you
I am where I am supposed to be. It occurs to me, belatedly, that the dark-haired woman probably knew; I should have asked her.
Victoire’s hand slips into mine. “Come for dinner, Draco. Bring curry.” She says it with some authority.
Harry Potter had saved him from Azkaban, but he couldn’t give him back his wand, couldn’t get him a job anywhere within the magical community, and couldn’t change the fact that he still had to pay 10,000 galleons in war reparations.
perfectly pressed robes, plays the valet… even tying Draco’s tie for him. Then he steps back, and judging by the look on his face, is simply admiring him.
It should have burnt down to coals by now… but one of the elves must have built it up for him, and it’s burning brightly. We both watch as the flames lick along a log.
“I know, mate.” Ron swallowed. “But you can’t just go rushing into Malfoy Manor and rescue him either.”
Potter notes him staring. “My aunt used to read them… there’s a whole series… when she thought no one was looking,” he says. “I… I read them one summer. That girl, Heaven, she grew up in a family where nobody wanted her either. I saw them on a used book rack a couple of months ago.” He looks uncomfortable. “I shouldn’t have bought them… I don’t know why I did.”
He found that, while he certainly did not wish to celebrate, neither did he want to stay in his flat, alone, mourning his parents, mourning the life he might have led. He found himself in Muggle bar, ordering a fruity sort of cocktail. He found himself on the dancefloor in the strong arms of a tall, muscular man. Blond… but with so many pale freckles.
It will cost him his soul… to soothe Harry’s…And when he leaves in the morning he will leave his own heart, shattered on the floor of Grimmauld Place.
The bookshop becomes part of Draco’s routine. He doesn’t always buy something— though he now does have an impressive selection of cookbooks, mainly hailing from the areas surrounding the Mediterranean—but he visits almost every day.
He always orders a latte, full-fat milk, with molasses and cinnamon. If he’s on his way to class, he warmly expresses his gratitude and leaves. If he’s done for the day, he often sits down with the drink, picks up one of the tattered paperbacks, and reads for a bit.
He nods. Draco’s confidence is catching and he, almost instantly, feels better. He always feels better sitting beside Draco.
Draco doesn’t move, except to keep placing treats into his hand for the dog to take. After the last treat is gone, she simply rests her head on his knee, waiting for him to do something.
Draco had tried for him… in a way that he rarely tried for anyone. He worked through his own pain to hold the man tenderly as he sobbed into his neck.
Harry cards his fingers through Draco’s hair, so short and tangle-free. “It’s all right, just relax. Sleep, if you want to. We’ve got time.”
I’m not much in the praying department, but I string together a few prayerful-sounding words for Fleur’s parents and send them heavenward, as walk through the gate and approach the door.
They are standing only a few feet apart… separated by cold iron bars and seven years of animosity… hexes… cruel words… by hands not shaken….
When they return to Hogwarts, they find the Eighth Year common room, predictably, deserted. Harry builds up the fire and they sit in front of it.
Potter’s fingers tighten, his other hand twisting in his hair, holding his head still as he ruts forward, once… twice… Draco doesn’t quite choke, but he feels his eyes swim.
Of the mountain… of stepping out of the cabin into the valley, barefoot and shirtless, proof of Charlie’s love still splattered across his stomach. Of a cold that is feather-light and refreshing rather than biting. Of the cry of a dragon, and not being able to tell if it’s just a few hundred yards away, cloaked in the mist, or on the next mountain. Of Charlie coming to stand behind him, to kiss where his neck joins his shoulder, pulling him close with one hand, pressing a cup of tea into his hand with the other.
him… but Harry can tell she’s mostly talking to Draco… because the words she’s using are long, sound very specific and technical, and don’t make any sense to him at all.
“I’m not going to let them keep you locked up in here,” he says, green eyes blazing in that way they have… when he is chasing a snitch. Or evading a dragon.
It did not look at him. “If Master has finished, Master must be taking a shower. Master must not keep the Dark Lord waiting.”
With nimble fingers, Potter undid the buttons, pushed both the trousers and the pants to the floor, and continued his trail of kisses.
Upright is not ideal, and as soon as he is vertical, his stomach rebels completely. He pushes past the real Draco Malfoy and makes it to the loo just in time.
It means a backhand across the face. It means choking on the man’s cock. It means bruises on his hips and being taken without enough preparation, each stroke burning. It means being forced into his own orgasm, a mockery of pleasure, cold sneaking through his belly like the touch of a Dementor. It means being tossed aside, something easily discarded, as the man dresses slowly above him.
They stay at Hogwarts when there’s a Quidditch match on and watch Ginny Weasley captain the Gryffindor team through what is turning out to be an undefeated season.

Weasley smiles and shakes his head. “You have to know that once Harry finally confided in us, he couldn’t stop talking about you. He loves you; that makes you family to me and Hermione. We would have stopped at nothing to bring you home.” Weasley stops abruptly. “I would go out and
And since Ginny is traveling with the Harpies, playing games four nights a week, Luna has taken herself on a month-long camping trip to Merlin-knows-where to observe the mating patterns of Circe-knows-what. They aren’t in a position to help.
Draco is enthralled. It doesn’t take him long to understand why this film is one of Potter’s favorites.
With some attempt at artistry, Draco tosses the coat aside. It lands in a little heap, forming the third point to the triangle that he and Potter are now standing in.
“Hi guys,” Harry says, slipping his arms around Draco’s waist. Draco is taller than Harry, but Harry is stronger, and he leans back into him, wrapping his fingers around Harry’s wrists and dropping his head back onto his shoulder. He closes his eyes as Harry places a gentle kiss on his cheek.
“Nope.” Draco feels a smile on his face. He feels it all the way up to his eyes. He sees Harry’s face light to match.
Draco has learned to breathe through the change, to bear it and to hope that the Polyjuice is the worst part of the encounter.
He can separate the sensations… his cheek against the rough floor, scraping minutely back and forth, burning… something warm and wet trickling down his leg that a more detached part of his brain identifies as blood… and the rhythm, terrible and insistent, each thrust sending red and yellow starbursts to smash into the backs of his closed eyelids.
The sound Draco makes sounds wounded, and Harry stops… stops moving his tongue in the way that he bloody well
I wait a few more minutes before the still-perfectly-braided Victoire bounces up to me. “Uncle Harry!”
Now Harry’s lying on the bed, Draco beside him… just waiting for Isolde to return with the time of the appointment.
. What he doesn’t do is hover, and for that Draco is grateful. Conversation is hard, and even though Draco cannot sleep without Harry’s arms... the day is coming, he knows, when Harry will want
“But I was nothing… nobody… just someone he could fuck while his boyfriend was away. He didn’t give a flying fuck about
“He doesn’t,” Potter says shortly. “Everyone wants to date the Savior of the Wizarding World… but finding someone who wants to date Harry Potter? That’s harder. The last bloke I went out with was Muggle—are you shocked?”
Draco takes a sip… the wine is full and fruity, and surprisingly good… as music blasts into the living room—an entire orchestra coming from the strange not-magic of the combination of screen and little boxes.
It is here that Harry Potter, war hero, comes to cling to the last snatches of the childhood he never had. Here he can be nineteen—a university student, his boss thinks, living on his own for the first time.
So he wishes, briefly, for a house-elf and then quietly asks Granger if she can give him a lesson in Muggle ironing—because, unless you’re a house elf, smoothing a hot iron across fabric is really the way to go.
Draco, worshiping his body, nourishing his soul… and when he comes deep inside him, Draco forgets… who he is, what he is,
“It’s not your job to protect me. Surely you know that?” He traces his thumb along Harry’s cheekbone before kissing him gently. “And it’s a bookshop, Harry. It’s a bookshop five
Harry. He knows that Harry would never force himself on anyone… purchased whore or not. Nevertheless, if Harry leaves before his hour is up, Draco will pay dearly for it.
“Kreacher lives to serve Harry Potter and the Most Ancient and Noble House of Black.” The elf is scowling at him. “Master Harry cannot order Kreacher to stop serving Harry Potter and the Most Ancient and Noble House of Black.”
Severus had been so sure that Potter would take him in, but Draco hadn’t been. On the one hand, he hadn’t
Physically, he’s almost the exact opposite of Professor Dumbledore… yet the similarity in tone and sentiment sends an actual ache straight through my heart.
Harry’s snort is not mirthful, and he palms the tears off his face. “I know you would have. Stopping only to make crude gestures at everyone you saw on your way out.”
the dim outline of the bureau, and even the ugly, empty portrait on the wall… and yet Macnair’s hands were on him, he could feel his fetid breath… he wouldn’t stop… and Draco screamed and screamed.
But at least he’s not in Azkaban which, to hell with whatever Potter said at his trial, is where Draco belongs. He did do all the things they accused him of. Yes, he was underage, and yes, he did them to avoid having to watch his mother be fed to a fucking snake…
“You are strong and clever and cunning, and you can be downright vicious when someone hurts someone that you care about. You would do anything—literally
Harry is kissing him.  His mouth presses against his shoulder again and again before moving along his back… to his other shoulder… soft and gentle, with an occasional touch of tongue.
Eighth Years don’t have a curfew, but habit brings most people back to the common room by nine… it must be earlier than he thought.
Or lovers, maybe, who snogged in the halls between classes and snuck into each other’s dorms at night?
; he cannot seem to address anyone, or even stand near someone, without placing a hand on them in some way.
Draco stops. Abruptly aware that his words have lost any hint of flirtation. He is shaking and he can’t quite catch his breath.
.” Harry pulled gently and brought Draco’s hands to his lips. He kissed the inside of Draco’s wrist, then the other wrist. “He can’t find you now. You’re safe here.”
Potter holds him while Draco tries to gain some sort balance. He glances around. Clearly they are a kitchen, a basement kitchen if the arched ceiling and high windows are any indication.
Harry pulls a small box from his pocket and, very formally, drops to one knee. “Draco Malfoy, will you marry me?”
“Come along, imp,” he says. “Let’s take you to your mother. Apparently Harry and I have some happily ever after to be getting to.”
Harry runs his thumb across Draco’s cheek. With his other hand, he interlaces their fingers. He watches Draco with an intensity that makes Draco want to raise his Occlumency shields. He doesn’t. He wouldn’t… even if Harry were even a mildly skilled Legilimens… which he isn’t. Draco opens his thoughts to Harry… but it is no use; Harry couldn’t find his way into Draco’s mind with an engraved invitation and a road map.
He finds that he genuinely likes Harry’s friends… though he prefers them one at a time and at a slight distance.
“Another time… After I put up a silencing charm! Your poor neighbors… that wasn’t very considerate… I hope no one was trying to sleep… I’m sorry, I just…”
people, healing hurts, seen and unseen, with whispered words. Gentle fingers wash his hair, pulling free the tangles as they do. There is nothing sexual about Harry’s touch… and it is the most intimate thing that has happened to Draco in years.
It’s freezing, and the overcoat Draco is wearing long and black and nearly sweeps the ground, but is doing little to block the wind—and outside of glitter, a pair of fishnet stockings, and a few strategically placed ribbons, the coat is all Draco is wearing.
“Whatever, Potter.” His words are tight. “As long as you bring money, you can fuck me whenever the fuck you like.”
It’s getting easier… to be out of Grimmauld Place, to be among people. But it isn’t easy yet, and Draco has to wonder if it ever will be again.
Granger also brought him a book on Middle Eastern cooking and another containing dozens of things he would have
“It wouldn’t do any good, Harry.” And Draco hates the catch in his voice almost as much as he hates the way Harry’s face falls. “I’m nowhere

“Yes. Along with your shoe size, and what you’re drinking at the Leaky Cauldron, and how your ironing charms are abysmal.” Applying a mild smoothing charm to Harry’s shirts has become almost routine for Draco. “They are
He smiles. He graciously accepts their thanks and praise. He doesn’t shrink into Draco’s side as a flashbulb goes off around them.
Harry exhales, sort of a cross between a sigh and a humorless laugh. “I doubt it. I think those are all the big ones, though.”
Potter that saved him from a lifetime in Azkaban. Neither could save him from the Reparations Company, Incorporated.
Draco reads for hours before going inside to make dinner. He’s not sure whose turn it is—Harry’s, he thinks—but he drags out
Draco feels slightly guilty, sitting back and sipping his wine, while Weasley and Granger bicker. It feels like before the war, it feels like
Harry turns a little, towards Draco, and Draco is kissing him again. He traces Harry’s tongue with his own, savoring each touch, each taste.
Draco pulls Harry even closer, right into his lap, wrapping his arms around him, and letting him bury his face into Draco’s neck. The fire is warm, orange and yellow flames dancing, with an occasional flicker of blue. He presses a kiss to Harry’s temple. “I love you.”
Their next kiss is barely more than that, but the magic crackles between them… singing of promises yet to be made, passion yet to be shared.
Harry’s cock arches up, brushing the sensitive skin on the inside of his wrist… begging for attention.
“Muggles are one thing,” Macnair said softly, “but to have a fine, Pureblood at my disposal… Well, now, aren’t I the lucky one that the Dark Lord is pleased with me and displeased with you?”
A loud crack snapped him out of his musings. The front door burst open with a crash and an unmistakable cry of pain.
Harry smiles. “There’s always something else to be done. Today I was at the hospital—a Muggle hospital. There are babies there, tiny, tiny babies who are born addicted to drugs. Kind of like illegal potions, you know? And they are so tiny and so sick and they go through withdrawal and it
… they said. I don’t know his name. It’s not written down anywhere that I could find. I looked everywhere… I suppose you can imagine that I was rather fascinated with them, when I was younger… It was so romantic, a beautiful couple, fantastically in love… defying the odds, even the family, to be together.”
Draco opens his mouth and they are kissing… properly. Draco’s free hand tangles in Harry’s hair and he makes little noises, sweet little noises that are halfway between a sigh and a purr as Harry teases his tongue along Draco’s… as he nips gently at his lower lip.
Draco is somewhat surprised to find that, not only does he enjoy cooking, he is good at it. Granger lends him
“Er…,” Harry turns back to the woman behind the counter. “So the chocolate cake… and… erm… a slice of cherry cheesecake, too, please.”
And in that moment, Harry hates him as much as he ever did… every fight, every hex, even the Sectumsempra curse… was
He moves his thumb and replaces it with his lips. He teases Harry’s mouth open, letting his tongue do what his body can’t and Harry moans, arching up again.
“It’s okay. You don’t have to be okay.” He’s holding Harry’s hand, but also his eyes. “Do you want to tell me about Halloween?”
Harry looks down… away. Is he happy? Has he ever been, truly, happy? Would he even recognize happiness if he felt it?
A brown bottle flew into Harry’s hand. He looked up, searching grey eyes for permission, and Malfoy, looking so desperately fragile, nodded.
She doesn’t seem to stop, even to breathe, much less eat, though the food is disappearing from her plate at an alarming rate. Who knew eight-year-olds could eat so much?
Like they did when they were sixteen. They were arguing. Harry shoved Draco. Or did Draco shove Harry? It hardly matters. One moment they were on the verge of fighting, the next they were grinding against each other. Then there was a kiss that was all teeth and tongues… and then they were coming all over each other’s fingers.
He feels it burst. He feels it tearing through him like shards of broken glass. He hears the sound he makes… half roar, half scream… like a wounded animal.
He flips through the pages, not seeing the words. “I’m fine,” he says, somewhat more convincingly, “So… a book for Hermione. Did you have anything particular in mind?”
A man he doesn’t know places his hand—firmly—on Harry’s arm. “Is that Death Eater bothering you, Mr. Potter?” he demands. The man has battleship grey hair, is wearing a pin-striped suit and is already pulling out his wand.
He hadn’t had the nerve to ask Healer Mitchell outright about an abortion. And, once he cried himself out in Draco’s arms, he wasn’t sure he would want one… even if it were possible.
“Fuck, yeah. The color’s perfect for your skin… your hair… it brings out the grey in your eyes… so beautiful. Almost like silver, but stronger… like iron. But that thread of green… you almost can’t see it, but it’s
on his bed. He doesn’t make it into the garden the next day, which Draco pretends is the fault of the rain.
He lies to Blaise when he flings out, in sharp, cutting words, that their relationship meant nothing to him… that he was merely passing time before moving on to other things.
It had been over a week since he had seen him bleeding in the graveyard. What had happened to him? Was he even still alive? Harry wanted…
Perversely, while the Polyjuice potion steals every feature that belongs to Draco, any pain inflicted on the not-Draco does not fade with the borrowed body. The pains stays, shooting through him when he moves; the bruises remain and Draco’s body is covered with them… though they are masked, of course, by the next dose of Polyjuice.
“Oh, I’m thinking about it, Malfoy. Do you actually work for a living” —he nods at the girl down the street, freezing in her fishnets and high heels— “or do you just sit there and beg?”
The words Granger used were slippery with extraneous vowels and he couldn’t quite follow them. They weren’t so much a
Draco could feel himself being split in two. He knew there was blood running down his legs, but still he didn’t scream.
For the briefest second the smirk that Harry knew and loved and hated lit Malfoy’s face. “She was very kind,” he says. “She didn’t have to be.”
“Nope.” Harry’s change of position doesn’t seem to alter his determination to kiss every inch of Draco, and he trails little bites up his neck. “I’m gonna wear my helmet.” He kisses along Draco’s jaw. “And my leather jacket. And boots. And tight leather pants.”
Draco freezes. His fingers refuse to release the grapefruit he is holding, refuse to let it fall into his market bag.
Our eyes are locked. Is he thinking about the last time he was at Grimmauld Place? I am. I’m remembering his hands… his lips… how fucking gorgeous he looked, all spread out on my bed.
Draco helps with the washing up. He takes up the cloth and plunges his hands into hot soapy water—like a Muggle. He washes because this isn’t his kitchen and he doesn’t know where anything goes… and with the cloth because, though he can feel his magic returning to him, he doesn’t want to risk straining it on dishes.
Miss Harding continues as if he hadn’t spoken, “…then I don’t even need to see your identification.”
Draco uses his tongue to trace each of Harry’s fingers, sucking each one into his mouth before moving on to the next. “I love you, Harry Potter,” he says.
“I… I want him to have raped me. Does that sound stupid? I want him to have forced me. Or for me to have been so drunk that I could say I didn’t know what I was doing. But I wasn’t. He asked me to come home with him and I
He feels his hand float up… his fingertips brushing against Potter’s jaw, feeling just a trace of stubble. He feels his fingers trembling.
Hermione looks as though she is choosing her words very carefully. “Do you think you could do that? Love children that aren’t yours?
who he is. Not a body, used and broken, but the real Draco Malfoy. “Potter, if you hadn’t found me when you did, I would have
Draco is grateful for the truth… but an impassioned lie would be nice, he thinks. Maybe just this once.
“Than getting the most spectacular blow job of your life? Than lying on your back while I ride you until you come
“I don’t know how to do this….” He sort of collapses on the bed, turning away from Harry, his eyes firmly downcast again. “Harry, I fuck people. I think that’s all I remember… People I never wanted, people who never wanted
Harry leads him to the bathroom and starts the shower. He helps Draco take off the robes and step into the streaming water. Harry is barefoot and shirtless, but he is still wearing those Muggle jeans he likes so much. He doesn’t seem to mind that they are getting soaked as he helps Draco wash every inch of himself.
“Hey, look, I don’t want to rush you or anything…” Lance runs a hand through his just-been-fucked hair, “but my partner is due back today and I’ve got a bit of cleaning to do before he gets back. Laundry, you know?”
Harry Potter’s breath caught in his throat. The jolt of pleasure he received from seeing Draco Malfoy bleeding into the grass—was that a
Draco shares the sentiment, exactly, though, under the circumstances, it would hardly be appropriate for him to express it.
He imagines kneeling before Harry, taking him into his mouth, watching him come undone before him. For him.
Antonie scoffs. Draco starts to comment—when has Jamaica ever won at an international sports event?—but the mention of Jamaica brings to mind Blaise; his mother was born there.
He gathers up the pieces of himself that want to cry and the pieces that want to hide and that one piece that wants to shout
What is there is tenderness… and Harry pulls Draco’s hand up until it is cupping Harry’s own face. Until he is holding Draco’s eyes with his own.
At first glance, dismissal time at St. Barnabus’s is utter chaos. But as I watch, I realize that there
Weasley has almost reached the house when Draco looks back up. “But, Weasley? Could you get rid of that paper?”
Normally I find peace in my solitude; today my kitchen seems too empty, too silent. I set up Draco’s dishwashing spell and go upstairs to work.
“Harry, we’re moving to Devonshire, not the moon!” Hermione says, throwing up her hands in exasperation.
Draco looks up into the face of Ronald Weasley. The voice. The softness fades a little; Draco isn’t ready to deal with edges.
She gives him a lecture, which he feels he deserves, but desperately doesn’t want to hear, about safer sex and why it is necessary to
(meaning What Happens Next isn’t written yet, but I didn't think any of us would want to wait any longer) and without any other distractions. So, the good news is… this story will have at least four chapters. You’re welcome.
“I know. But I’m still asking. I can pay the Company if I have to… I’d pay anybody anything if I could… if… you
like the lads who’ve been away at the wars… but not too different, either, I think.” The old man smiles gently. “Anyway, it doesn’t really matter where you’ve been, my boy, so long as you come back.”
“No,” Draco whispers. “I want to see you.” Draco touches his cheek, tracing gently with his thumb, brushing his fingers along Harry’s jaw. There’s a bit of stubble there.
Harry worked hard. It took him a long time and he was hungry. But he ironed and ironed and carefully folded the handkerchiefs.
He refuses to believe that the pregnancy could possibly be accidental, refuses to believe that the other father is a Muggle, and insists, with every other breath, that they have made a very poor—and possibly fatal—choice.
The window in Draco’s little room is too small for Nicholas to fly out of, so Draco has to carry him, maneuvering his arm and the owl out the window.
“Or… erm…?” Harry’s voice drops off. He’s too polite to ask if Draco’s former lover is a Death Eater now serving a life sentence in Azkaban.
“But… Oh, Harry…” His parents were dead before he could talk. His godfather was in prison… and then he died. His aunt and uncle hated him, Harry’s told him that.
He was out of breath and tears were running down his face when he made it to the mat. It could hardly be considered soft, but being off the floor made him feel slightly better. He rested a moment before carefully picking up the pitcher.
Draco regards him carefully. Potter has never looked more dangerous… or more fragile. He places the marker in the book and sets it on the table. He stands slowly.
… Harry Potter would come back from the summer holidays so thin, with wary, shadowed eyes… but Draco had never really
“Shhh…” Harry presses a finger to Draco’s lips. “I knew you would run late. And I knew how much you wanted to wear those tonight.”
At first Harry thinks Malfoy is reaching for his face… his cheek, or maybe his chin… and Harry longs to feel the cool brush of those fingers. Maybe he
.” Draco doesn’t say anything else, he just presses his lips to Harry’s forehead. His fingers move gently through Harry’s hair.
Draco feels like an outsider, though not an unwelcome one, and he receives a hand-knitted jumper from Mrs. Weasley, green with a silver dragon-shaped “D” on the front.
He falls silent, and Draco finds he doesn’t have anything to add. The only sounds come from the scraping of knives and forks on plates, and a slow, steady drip of water into the sink.
He points to two streaks of silver, one longer than the other, on his arm, just below his shoulder. “Here’s the marks from the Horntail’s tail… the Triwizard Tournament, you know?” And to the rough patch above it, spreading to the back of his shoulder. “A frying pan. It was hot.”
“Do I look like a Muggle?” Draco asks, trying for a joke, as he holds out his hand for Harry’s inspection. He’s slightly unnerved by the look on Harry’s face.
It’s the War Orphans Charity tonight… fundraising. That will mean that all of the remaining Pureblood families will attend, more than willing to spread about their fading fortunes to prove to the rest of the Wizarding World that
Potter makes a garbled sort of noise that might have been the beginning of a word, but ends in a low sort of squeak.
He took another sip and I watched as he swallowed, and all I could think about was trailing kisses down that perfect neck.
“Good morning, gentlemen,” says the man, coming out from behind the counter. “Are you looking for something in particular?” He divides his gaze between Draco and Weasley.
Gingerly, Draco joins him on the bed. Harry is observant and sensitive and his healing spells wipe away his hurts, one bruise after another, and even the broken ribs, until Draco is resting comfortably in his lap.
“I don’t want to be an Auror.” Harry says it quickly, and his words are sharp, as if he is throwing away something he has long held on to.
. With Malfoy’s calm, quiet help they have tidied the kitchen… doing the dishes and putting away the leftovers. And now all Harry wants is to hear the smashing of china. He hits the table again… the ancient wood absorbing the sound.
“Master Draco is needing to eat something,” Kreacher said. “Master must sip this while his bath fills.”
“Oh,” Harry says. It seems like a very long time to wait to find out… something. “Draco, what… do you know about it? Male pregnancy.”
Harry whose eyes are the brightest green… though the darkness is absolute and Draco cannot see them… Draco knows they are shining at him. For him.
Draco is far less filthy… but he may be the dirtiest he has ever been. He’s been handing Harry tools all afternoon—and even adding his own muscles to unsticking the stopping mechanism.
wear the night before, and one of Harry’s stupid why-shirts. This one is utterly threadbare and has a picture of a triangle and a rainbow on it. All the shirts smell like Harry, even when they are fresh from the laundry. Part of Draco is truly appalled; part of him loves nothing more than to wrap himself in Harry’s scent.
“My beautiful Rose!” he says, pressing a kiss through those curls before setting her down. He’s missed her too. He and Harry have spent a long weekend in France, visiting his mother; normally he sees her almost every day. “Hello, Hermione. Hugo.”
Harry thanked the elf and for a while he and Malfoy ate in companionable silence. Harry, leaning against the doorframe, Malfoy, curled around himself on the chest sitting under the window. He ate slowly, but he finished the ice cream.
Harry is crying now, too. Their foreheads are pressed together, and Draco can feel Harry’s tears, mixing with his own, and running together down his cheeks and over his chest.  “And you’re stubborn. Too stubborn to die, too stubborn to spend the rest of your life in Azkaban, too stubborn to let them beat you. You did what you had to do and you
“I interviewed them,” Granger says, fingering her Department of Magical Legal Affairs badge. “Three girls and a boy. All Squibs. They all seem to be there voluntarily.”
