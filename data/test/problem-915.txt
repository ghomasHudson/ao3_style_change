Cass had never travelled so far by Portkey, and, unlike Harry, she landed gracefully on her feet with a huge smile on her face.  “That was fun!”
“Excellent, well done, Harry.  I think that using a visit with Cass as your motivation will suit our purposes for the short term.”
“I know,” Draco’s voice was heavy with unshed tears.  “It’s the worst thing I could have done.  I wanted to be a hero for you.  I wanted to sacrifice myself for you like you’d done for everyone else.  I wanted you to have your happily ever after, and I saw how much you loved Teddy, and...” Draco felt his lips form the shape of a little sob, and couldn’t keep it from escaping.  He took a breath, tried to get his shaking voice under control.  “I was so afraid that you’d end up staying with me out of loyalty.  I know what you’re like, Harry.  If someone threatens someone you care about, you’ll do anything to protect them.  I wanted to protect you for once.  You deserve so much happiness, and Andromeda seemed so certain that you were betrothed to Ginny.  I realized that if I stayed, you'd give it up for me, give up Teddy, and your wife.”
Draco was saved from having to answer, since they were presented with the site of Lucius Malfoy, walking four albino peacocks on bejewelled leashes.  Cass was standing next to him, wearing a look of wry amusement.  It seemed to be taking every ounce of her composure to keep from laughing.
A look of genuine anguish crossed Malfoy’s face.  “Bollocks,” he said softly.  “It is.  I’m going to have to pull him from school, aren’t I?”
The Healer returned the following morning.  “It will be hours now, Mr Malfoy.  Your Mother is comfortable, but her magical core is all but extinguished.  You’ll find that her breathing will simply slow until it ceases altogether.”
And suddenly Draco understood why Lara wasn’t in favour of this plan.  Seeing Harry’s eyes full of hero worship, his shy expression fixated on the first person in his life that had been the slightest bit fucking
Any normal person would be suffused with warmth, watching two innocent babies, safe and loved, playing carefree after a good night’s sleep.  Draco watched with a terror so great he had to flee the room.
When she’d calmed down, Greg explained that they were still awaiting an update on Harry’s condition.  Minerva, as Harry’s next of kin, had been contacted, and she was making arrangements to have him transferred to the United Kingdom as soon as he was stabilized.  After hours of waiting, a Healer came into the waiting room.  “Harry Potter’s family?” They looked up expectantly.  “Harry’s going to recover, but he hasn’t been taking very good care of himself lately.  We have a call in to the Department Head of our Mind Healing unit, but at present, we’ve been working to resolve his physical issues, which were primarily exhaustion, dehydration and some pretty alarming nutritional deficits.”
The house elves, bless them, arrived with a tray, and soon, Cass and Scorpius were settled by the fire with their game and hot chocolate, and the adults were sitting with tea.  Draco looked as though he’d been hit in the stomach with a bludger.  His eyes never left his daughter.  He watched her as though he could drink up every moment of her life, everything he’d missed out on.
Well, indeed.  Draco felt a wave of misery.  Why was he doing this?  Probing at the ache of his former life like a missing tooth?  This was madness.  “I suppose I should get out of your hair,” he said awkwardly.
Ron and Hermione agree to take me to my flat.  Apparently, I’ve confirmed for them that I know enough wandless magic and remember enough of Diagon Alley not to be a danger to myself.  We clear the wards, and I look around.  It’s bland.  Clean enough, but from the brown sofa to the beige walls, I’m uninspired.  I look at the photos on the mantle.  “Who’s this guy?” I ask with interest.
He didn’t expect the owl that arrived the following morning.  He was still in his mother’s room.  The house elves had entreated him to please, Master Draco, please go to bed.  Missus Cissy is being asleep.  But despite their pleas, he remained, in the stillness, keeping watch.  He dozed off in the early morning, awakening with a stiff neck and feeling gritty.  The owl that swooped in gave him an appraising look.  Feeling defensive, Draco said, “Well, what do you have?” He didn’t recognize this owl, but in order for it to have breached the wards, it had to be friendly.  The owl held its leg out imperiously.  As Draco untied the letter, the owl fluttered its wings, affronted that Draco hadn’t petted it first.  Too tired, and too full of despair to be pandering to strange owls, Draco said, “Go find an elf if you’re hungry” before simply ignoring it, unfolding the letter.
Draco fled, to his lab, where things were predictable, and safe. He placed his head on the cool marble of the worktable, and counted his breaths.  Eventually, the trembling ceased, and his breathing was more stable.  He considered, for a moment, firecalling Lara, but ever since their last session together, he’d felt unable to ask for her help.  She didn’t approve of what he was doing, and so he had to deal with the consequences himself.  That he wasn’t sure how to deal with said consequences made little difference.  The jangly, unsettled feeling roiling through his belly increased.  He was alone, and he had to somehow deal with the stupid choices he was making, the danger he was exposing innocent people to…
The queue is lengthening behind us, but Louise ignores them.  “That’s awful!  What are you going to do?”
Draco laughed.  “I was.  And I didn’t realize that until I was eighteen years old.  The War was difficult, not just for Voldemort’s enemies, but for his followers too.  He was cruel, and he was driven, and he didn’t care how he used someone, so long as he was getting what he wanted.  When Harry finally ended him, our society was very angry at those of us who had taken his Mark.  Anyone who had been in his service was hated.  Harry spoke for me at my trial.  Don’t get me wrong, Cass. I did terrible things, things I’d give anything to take back, but I was also a scared kid, trying to protect my family.  Harry seemed to understand that, and so he managed to keep me out of prison, and get my Mother put on House Arrest.  My Father served a five year term in Azkaban.  We were given incredible leniency, and the people in our social circle hated us for it.”
“Listen, Pansy, whatever he needs, okay?  If he and Astoria need security to keep the press away, hire it.  I’ll cover the cost.  If he needs to release a statement that says he publicly disavows me, that’s fine.  I want to stay until after the bone marrow transplant, but I’ll clear out as soon as it’s over.  If we play this right, it shouldn’t touch him too much.  How’s the reporter?”
So resolved, I stand and make my way upstairs.  Draco is in Scorpius’ room, releasing multi-coloured bubbles from his wand.  The baby is entranced, and when one pops around his poking finger, he laughs, huge belly laughs that make Draco laugh too.  Fleetingly, I wonder if my parents did the same for me, and then just as quickly, I dismiss it.  It doesn’t matter if they did.  I could dwell in the past, or I could
She regards him over her spectacles for a long moment, as the tea pours itself, and biscuits appear on a plate.  Her gaze is appraising, but not unkind.  “I assume,” she says finally, “that you’re here to discuss some unwanted visitors and solicitations?”  He nods, and her gaze continues, unwavering.  She’s sizing him up in much the same way she did when he was eleven.  She seems to realize something, perhaps that this is a test of her loyalty to him.  Will she decide for him, the way that Dumbledore did when he was a child, or that his friends have, now that he’s an adult?  Her smile is gentle, as she says, “The owls are easy.  We already have wards that prevent those who don’t know you from sending correspondence.  The spell can be extended to include those who do.”
“Very well.  Cass, it might not mean much to you right now, but I am sorry that I hurt you.  I swear to you that I truly believed I was making the decision that hurt you least.”
“Oh, right, I suppose that makes sense,” Harry said, embarrassed that he had brought it up.  The Malfoys had been sentenced to House Arrest after the war, but the Ministry had made them remove their ancestral Wards, replacing them with standard, Ministry-issue ones.  Two years later, a Ministry employee, nursing a grudge, had stolen a poorly-secured wardkey, breached Malfoy Manor, and killed Narcissa and Lucius while they slept.
“Peacocks!” Lucius called gaily, and Draco and his Mother exchanged a look.  Narcissa hastily summoned an elf, and sent it to discreetly follow and watch them.
“Leave me alone, Potter.”  Harry winced.  Draco almost never called him Potter anymore.  Only when he was truly vulnerable did he fall back into the patterns of their youth.
“Watch out for Ginevra, will you?  Keep him safe,” Draco said, and both of them ignored the way his voice broke on the last word.  Hermione nodded, and blew him a kiss, and then disappeared in a whoosh of green flames.
It galled him to have to ask, but, with a little moue of distaste, he said, “I don’t know much about Cass’ routines, her likes and dislikes.  Anything I should be aware of?”
“Well, obviously, Hermione and I are doing an excellent job at showcasing the highlights of marriage.  When are you going to find someone?”  His grin was wry, but Harry knew he wouldn’t get out of answering the question.
McGonagall stares at him for a long time before she mutters something that sounds a lot like “Dumbledore,” but she pats his knee and says, “I expect that you might be surprised at how properly you’re able to love, Harry.  Now, you don’t need to be entertaining a maudlin old woman.  Go dance with your friends.”
The next morning, when he made his way down to breakfast, Draco looked at him carefully.  Cass and Scorpius were chattering happily on either side of Lucius, who watched them fondly, interjecting non-sequiturs that had them giggling.  Narcissa sat at the opposite end of the table, opening her post, and occasionally redirecting Lucius, when his comments veered in alarming directions.  She smiled at Harry.  “Good morning, Harry, dear.  Did you sleep well?”
Molly’s tears were more effusive than Hermione’s.  She gripped his shoulders, cried, pulled him close, cried, and pushed him to arm’s length so that she could look at him.  “Still too thin, but you look happy,” she decided.
“'Course I did.  Draco, I’m so sorry.  Your mum was…amazing.”  Harry crosses the floor, and Draco wards him off with upraised arms.
“Kreacher,” Ron grinned. “I told you he was mad about babies.  He must have done it this afternoon.  Well, Harry’s all set, and there’s a monitoring charm to let you know if he wakes up.”
“Even if he doesn’t want me anymore,” she whispered, and a fresh storm of sobs took over.  She’d tried not to think it, and certainly hadn’t said it, but admitting that her Dad had so easily left her with a near-stranger hurt more than she could say.
“Did it all mean so little to you that you can just pick me up when I fall through your door, and put me to bed and send me away?  Don’t you care at all?”
“I know.  But don’t be.  We knew that we were on borrowed time.  You’ve been betrothed to Astoria since you were seven years old.  Lucius isn’t a patient man.”
“In order to do so, I’d like to cast a spell that will allow me to enter your mind and view your memories,” he continues, looking defensive, as though I’m going to get offended.
“Oh for fuck’s sake, Harry, just shut up a moment, will you?”  Draco’s voice sounded exhausted.  Harry noted absently that Draco had used his name, and, remembering the way he’d once said it, Harry felt his knees weaken a little.  He swayed, but then caught himself, and straightened his spine.  He cast a longing look at the floo, but remained where he was, waiting to be dismissed.  Finally, Draco said, “Look, I know we need to talk, but I just can’t tonight.  Do you understand?”
“Nope.  I was trying to arrest a potion smuggler, and I was obviously cursed, and knocked unconscious, and when I woke up, I could barely remember anything.”
I like the way he says my name.  I flip over to all fours, and feel his hot, wet mouth kiss down my spine.  His hands cup my arse cheeks, and gently pull them apart.  His sound of delight makes me thrill inside, but it’s nothing compared to how I feel when he buries his face between my cheeks and licks me.  In my eagerness to feel more of that, my shoulders sink to the bed, and my hips instinctively rock backwards and forwards, the counterpoint of friction against the sheets and tongue on my arse makes me fear for my sanity.  When his mouth sucks at my hole, my vision goes blurry, and I think I might expire, but I manage to just groan instead, and lose myself in the sensation.  His torso suddenly is against my back, and and he kisses my neck, slides his cock between my cheeks.
Astoria’s owl had asked Harry and Cass to meet them at their flat in London before the appointment with Scorpius’ Healer.  Harry smoothed his robes again as he prepared to step through the floo.  “Ready, Cass?”
“She’s been disinherited?”  Draco was shocked.  He’d never thought that Pansy’s parents would be so heartless.
“Yes, of course I did,” he says, and directs a bemused little smile my way that has Draco clinging to my arm so I don’t leap up and strangle him.
There’d been a tiny hiccup when on the first night, after spelling a set of pyjamas onto the boy, a miscommunication had occurred.  Draco had said that it was time for bed, and then a few minutes of incredible confusion occurred, when Harry seemed determined to sleep in a closet, and Draco had been equally convinced that his bed was a better spot.  Harry had ultimately been persuaded, and, as Draco pulled the duvet up over his shoulders, Harry had patted the covers in wonder.  “For Harry?  Harry bed?”
Draco’s expression changed abruptly.  “I was terrible to you,” he said.  “Now that I have Scorpius, I could curse myself for having been so cruel to a child.”
“Hi Mister Potter!”  A chorus of voices shouted his name, and he smiled broadly at everyone before sitting down on one of the mats.  Gradually, the girls all did the same.  These were his junior cohort, and they were secretly Harry’s favourite group to work with.  Old enough to pay attention for a while, but still young enough that they weren’t self conscious when trying something new.
“Yes, cub.  Don’t panic.  You’re fine, you’re not mad, you’re alive.  Your system was a little overwhelmed, and your brain is working overtime to process the sensations of two decade’s worth of memories.”
“We don’t need your pity, Potter,” Draco said.  Harry looked up.  Draco’s face was in the same mocking expression that he used to carry back in school, but Harry was older now, and had seen more faces and more expressions.  Draco was feeling vulnerable, and scared for his son.
“Yes, well, losing one’s shit like a commoner is very exhausting,” Harry says, and Draco grins at him, and shoves his shoulder.
“I liked your version better,” George offers, “but what about the fireworks?”  I am about to answer, but the door bangs, and Molly cries, “Ginny,” and that seems to be the universal signal for ‘lunch is ready’.
They passed a pleasant hour, working through Mr. Powers’ tentative inquiries about the nature of his daughter’s gifts, and Violet’s increasingly excited demands to show him more magic.  She reminded Harry a little of Rose, her eyes bright as she eagerly consumed information.  Mr. Powers looked at the clock, a little sadly.  “Vi,” he said, “you’ve your piano lesson in a half hour.”
They finally managed to retrieve Scorpius, and headed towards the floo, Draco making sure that he had Harry’s arm.  He was ungainly at this stage of his pregnancy, and Draco admitted to being a little overprotective.  It was mad, really, to be having another baby at this age, with their kids both in Hogwarts.  But Draco couldn’t find it in him to feel any apprehension.  He was enjoying seeing Harry pregnant, and looking forward to getting to know the newest Potter-Malfoy from the moment he was born.
Miriam grinned.  “Nice try.  I don’t think it’s going to be easy either, but I think it will be so illustrative for you.  I’d like you to imagine, for a moment, that there was nothing at all that would prevent you from getting what you’d most like in life.”
Harry expression grew sheepish.  “I…er, didn’t really have time.  She was a bit early, and my mediwitch had to floo in from Scotland.  By the time I realized that I was in labour, and Poppy arrived, there wasn’t time to put me out. She just cast a pain blocker spell.”  Catching the look on Cici’s face, he blushed.  “It was fine.”
“Alright then,” I say, and then something occurs to me.  “Draco, from what I’ve been told, you and your family have had some…image challenges since the war ended.”  It’s the politest way I can find to say that people seem to hate him, and the look on his face confirms that I’ve not done a terrific job at it.  No way out but through, I decide, and continue.  “Wouldn’t it do your reputation good to be seen as someone who righted a wrong?  And seeing the way that people seem to pay attention to me, I can’t imagine that it would hurt you any.”
“No.  The Head Auror wants this to die down as much as we do.  You’ve had to pay a fine for disturbing the peace, but he didn’t charge you with assault.  If we can appease the reporter, you won’t have legal issues on top of all of this.”
Narcissa, it turned out, was not alone in the gardens.  Draco went over to his father and kissed both of his cheeks.  “Hello, Father.”
“So,” Harry said, “now you know what prompted me to leave the country in the middle of the night.  I am so sorry about how I decided to leave, and that I didn’t tell you all properly.  I have no excuse at all.  You deserved better.”
It’s time, and Harry and Hermione stand at the back of the marquee, hidden from sight.  Harry extends his elbow and Hermione’s small hand tucks in, warm and firm, and utterly certain.  They step into view, and Hermione stands on her tiptoes to whisper, “I’m pregnant,” into Harry’s ear.  He stumbles for a half-step, before righting himself and continuing to guide her down the aisle.  As he kisses her cheek before placing her hand into Ron’s huge one, he whispers back, “You’re going to be brilliant parents.”
The pinched look isn’t on his face anymore, so I continue, once our meals have been placed in front of us.  “I’m told that, defensively, I was decent, before all this, but one low-level smuggler was able to completely put me out of commission.  What’s to stop them from getting to the Minister, or the entire parliament or something?  But somehow, I’m the only person who seems to think about that!”
“Nah,” I say.  “I don’t think that’s fair to Ginny.  Also, I imagine your Mum is pretty narked off at me.”
Harry refuses offers of a nightcap, and disappears through the door.  He’s about to apparate home, but on impulse, changes his destination at the last minute.  The snake dislikes apparation and makes its displeasure known.
It takes a minute for my eyes to adjust to the darkness, but I barely stumble as I make my way to get a drink.  The girl behind the bar is a tiny asian girl, whose eyes are expertly made up.  She glances at my scar for a split second before saying, “What’ll you have?”
Snape’s painted forehead creases for a moment and he regards Harry.  “So you have grown up.  I’m impressed, Mister Potter.”
“Of course,” Arthur’s voice was quiet, but his tone was firm.  “Of course you were frightened, Harry.  We all understand that.  I just want you to know, so that there’s no question of it going forward.  You’re one of ours, Harry.  Molly and I love you as much as we do the rest of our children.  There is nothing in the world that you could do that would make us turn away on you.  Nothing.  And as for you, young lady,” Arthur turned mock-stern eyes on Cass.  “It’s not every day that you get a child back
The little boy turned over, and Harry conjured a ball of light in his palm, nudging it a little until it hovered over them and bathed them in a warm glow.  Malcolm’s eyes widened at this.  Harry smiled.  “Neat, isn’t it?  Do you remember what I said I was called?”  Malcolm nodded.  “Good.  So I’m Harry, and you’re Malcolm, and I bet it’s been sort of an awful day, hasn’t it?”  Another nod.  Harry moved his hand nearer to Malcolm.  “The first thing that I need to tell you is that you’re absolutely, perfectly safe.  I am going to make sure that you stay that way, and that’s a promise.  Nobody’s going to hurt you anymore, Malcolm.”
“Maybe I am.”  Draco’s voice was tight, and he felt anxiety creep up into his chest from where it normally lay coiling in his belly.
of being this child’s father threatened to overtake him.  Harry hastily made his way to the living room, where he summoned a beer, and slumped onto the sofa.
“Yes.  I was going to send you this month’s owl, but then I decided to just come home.  To see if you wanted to see me.”
Harry was sitting on a poorly transfigured sofa, his arms and legs bound, and he was glaring at Ginny.  Draco had forgotten how Harry’s eyes looked when he was truly angry.  They were beautiful.  It struck him as strange that he was glaring, however.  If Ginevra had given him the potion, he ought to look like a lovesick cow.  Ginny’s face was red, and her arms were crossed defiantly across her chest.  “Harry, if you’ll just listen,” Ginny begged.
“I don’t know,” Hermione says doubtfully.  “I can’t imagine how…” she breaks off and looks away, biting her lip, and again, I have no idea why this is so important to them both.
“Alright, Harry,” Draco replied, and he went and got tea for all three of them anyway.  When he returned, Harry was sitting on the floor outside the room.  To Draco’s surprise, Astoria was sitting beside him.  Draco couldn’t remember a time when Astoria has done something so undignified, in public no less, but she was sitting close, and Harry’s head was on her shoulder while she spoke quietly to him.  Harry’s eyes were red-rimmed, and Draco intuited that he had given way to his fear while Draco was away.  He knew that Astoria would set him right, but he still couldn’t completely quash the tiny flare of totally irrational jealousy.
“And I, yours.” The Healer passed Draco a slip of parchment.  “This is my private floo.  Please call me if you need anything”
Louise grins and opens the gate beside the counter for me to enter.  She leads me back into a large industrial kitchen.  “Mama, do you know Harry?”
“Well, Kreacher is your…very special friend,” Draco said, the latter part coming out a bit lamely.  He was reasonably sure that the original three-year-old Harry had never seen a House Elf, living with Muggles, and he didn’t fancy trying to explain the complicated relationship between a family and its Elves.  “He is here to help you with anything you need, and to keep you safe.  His magic is incredibly powerful, and he’ll do all sorts of fun things with you.”
“Quite.” Andromeda’s thin lips quirked into a small rictus that might be mistaken for a smile, if Draco hadn’t grown up in a house with very similar lips making very similar shapes.  “I’m sure you know that he’s betrothed to Ginerva Weasley?”
“Well when you went to Canada, you left your heart here, didn’t you?”  Luna smiled gently at him.  “Excuse me, Draco, I need to go dance.”  The girl disappeared, her hips already swaying to music that likely only existed in her own head.
Harry had been through this before.  Sort of.  When he worked with Muggle families who had a first-generation wix, they sometimes worried that their child would be taken away, whisked off to a world of magic where they could not follow.  And, yes, children raised in the non-magical world did sometimes turn their back on their pasts, but Harry had learned how to reassure nervous parents.  “Malfoy, it’s not my intention to remove Scorpius from a happy home.  I truly am here to help, not destroy families.  But, make no mistake, I am
“Please, Harry.  Please?”  Draco doesn’t care that a Malfoy never begs.  He’s only just realized that everything he’s ever wanted is slipping through his grasp, and he’s going to do anything he can to hang on.
“Nobody,” I say, even if that’s not exactly correct.  “I just get the impression that I’m a bit more brawn than brain.  Anyhow, like I was saying, I know you’re going to have to give me a rough idea of how I got here, and what’s happened, but maybe I don’t need every detail.  Like, paint it in broad strokes for now, and you can fill in everything as we go.”
Harry nodded, walking to the window and watching the traffic, and beyond it, the lake.  Draco handed him a bottle, uncapping one for himself.  Then he waited.   Whatever Harry was here to say, Draco was going to give him a chance to say it.
“What?”  Harry suddenly felt unsteady, and he’d perched on the edge of the sofa.  “Why?  Did I do something wrong?”
Ron is looking at her, horror contorting his features.  “‘Mione,” he finally gasps, and the single utterance of her name is more condemning than any vitriol I could spew.
“But Ca-ass,”  They looked at one another challengingly, both grinning.  The moment held, before she impatiently flicked her head, tossed the curl back to join the others.  Harry thought gleefully of the wand that was sitting in his workshop, locked carefully in a cabinet.  In truth, he’d made Cass’ wand the first time she performed magic, and it had been waiting for her ever since.  Harry was planning to give it to her on her tenth birthday in October.  He had never been more excited to present a wand to a young witch.  As they sat, Harry’s mind moved on to homework, and packing lunch, and the finicky length of Alder that was sitting on his workbench, confounding him.
His lips tighten, and I see we’ve come to the ‘cut the bullshit’ portion of his speech.  “Harry, what exactly is going on between Draco Malfoy and yourself?”
Harry frowned a little, hoping that Scorpius wasn’t afraid to go home with Draco.  “If your Papa says it’s okay, I can certainly make sure you get settled,” he said.  “John, thank you for the offer, but I have some other things I need to do.”
The man turns out to be a Healer, and he examines Scorpius while Pansy and I stand at a distance.  I take advantage of the time to scribble a quick note to Florean.  I’m pretty sure I will be missing work for a bit.  The Healer casts a series of spells, each one bursting into bright colours over the baby’s chest.  One though, starts out as golden sparks, but fizzles out immediately.  Draco makes a sound then, and it’s somewhere between a sob and a moan.  “Fuck,” Pansy says in low tones.
Of course there are owls, several a day, at first.  He ignores them, and they become more and more persistent, but he becomes efficient with shield spells, and they flap through the Great Hall in agitation.  When Hermione appears at breakfast one morning, he rushes back to his quarters, and, later, goes to Minerva.
“Don’t,” she howled, even as she suspected that she was losing control of her emotions a little.  “Don’t say anything about my Daddy!  He’s good, and he does his best, and he loves me.  Even…even if…”. The tears took over, and she couldn’t speak, even if she wanted to.
“Listen, Dad told me about how stuff is different with cultured families like yours.  I know you don’t really say what you’re feeling, and you use politeness and stuff to get your point across.  That’s not how I want to be, so I’m going to make it really clear:  You’re crazy if you think that the way to make me like you is to be mean to my Dad.”
That had been the question though.  After spending the past seven years driven by a prophecy, Harry wasn’t sure what it would look like to do what he wanted.  Harry contented himself with focusing on what he knew, and figured the rest would take care of itself.  He spent the summer after the war playing Quidditch, hanging out with Ron at night after Wheezes had closed, and visiting his Godson, until Andromeda decided to move to France.   A few things were harder to sort out.  There’d been an awkward conversation with Ginny, when he’d finally had to admit that he thought of her like a little sister, and had been dreaming of Oliver Wood on a broomstick far too often for him to be entirely straight.
“Having you defend him so passionately means the world to me, Harry.”  Harry looked up, confused.  Narcissa was smiling at him.  “The manner in which you chose to stand up for him may be a little unrefined, but the fact that you did is what will be remembered.  The press will certainly criticize you, and, perhaps, Draco, by extension, but the people will know that their Chosen One fought for Draco’s honour.  You have given him, and me, a tremendous gift.”
“So if his core is smaller, that means he’d have to give it time to grow, or else-Wait…Master of what?”
Harry smiled.  “Cass will tell you all about what she likes and dislikes, but generally, she’s really easy going.  No allergies, or medical conditions to be aware of.  She’s a very adventurous eater.”  His smile wavered just a little.  “This is the first time we’ve actually been apart for more than a school day, so we don’t know whether she’ll like spending the night in a new place or not.  But I think she’ll do great, and if she feels anxious, she knows how to get in touch.”
Harry looked confused.  “I’ve never taken a sleeping draught.  I had some dreamless sleep during school, but never anything like this.”
Logically, Harry knew that his experiences weren’t the norm.  Most parents were, after their initial shock wore off, pretty excited to learn that their child was magical.  But most children didn’t cry as though their heart was broken after a fairly minor stinging hex.
“Oh Merlin.  I promised Cass that I’d take her places, show her things.  I guess that will have a wait a bit.”
“Well, if you think of a solution, I’ll discuss it with him, but I reckon he’s happier taking care of Grimmauld than if he were out on his own.  I’m not hurting him, or letting him punish himself…although I wish you’d warned me about that.  He brained himself with the iron yesterday before I caught him.”
Harry looked at Malfoy, who gestured him to a seat.  “I’d appreciate knowing what happened,” he said.
Hermione laughed, but it was a sad kind of laugh.  “I’ve been saying that for eighteen years.  Your Dad has been my best friend since I was eleven years old.  Your Uncle Ron, Harry and I, through thick and thin.  Even when he went away, I worried about him, tried to find him.”  She looked at Cass, and her brown eyes were kind.  “How much do you know about your Dad’s life before you?”
Later, after countless toasts, Dennis excuses himself to the loo, and Harry sidles around the table to sit next to Draco.  Draco tenses. He can be the bigger man about all of this, but he wishes it didn't warrant a
The little boy shook his head, refusing to look at Harry.  Harry sighed.  “Okay, I’ll be right back, okay?  I wanted to chat with you for a minute, but I just need to sort some things first.”  He left the room, and glared sternly at the woman.  “Come downstairs.”
“Draco,” Harry says.  He communicates a lot with that one word.  Love, and loss, and yearning, and acceptance.
“I think it’s mad that they let a bureaucratic little twat like you work anywhere other than the floo regulation department, but hey, what do I know?” Tamsin said from over Harry’s shoulder.  He raised his bun to her mouth, hoping that if he filled it, she’d stop getting them into trouble.  She took a big bite, but continued to glare at Nettle.
Linden sneered at Harry, his crooked teeth making Harry think of Snape.  It was his only resemblance to Harry’s Potion’s instructor though, as Nettle was short, squat, and had at least three decades of age on Snape.  “I still think it’s mad, letting you around children.  Between your unnatural tendencies, and your propensity to violent outbursts, you’re a walking time bomb.”
“Did you reach his guardian?”  The Healer, a man a few years older than Harry by the name of John Arden, had removed Scorpius’ clothes, down to his pants.  Harry registered the reassuring rise and fall of the child’s breathing and felt his hands unclench.
“Oh, baby,” Harry burst into relieved tears.  “You’re awake.  Oh thank Merlin.  I’m so happy to hear your voice again.”
Draco didn’t recall what, if anything, he said to Andromeda before leaving, apparating home and taking his Mother to the restaurant.  He was in a daze, politely responding to his Mother’s comments, choosing a drink, and what he wanted to eat.
“Okay,” Draco said.  He waited a moment, in case Harry would take pity on him, and save him from having this conversation in front of a horde of curious Weasleys, but Harry merely looked at him, the polite, not-entirely-hostile look planted firmly on his face.  Well, fine.  Harry didn’t trust him to be alone with him, but he’d come all this way, and Harry’s present was getting awfully heavy.  Fine.  He’d do this stupid thing, and lay his heart bare for Harry, and then it would be over, and he could go to the Manor and the elves would give him brandy, and his Mother would say comforting things.
“Of course you didn’t.  I never mean to either, but it happens sometimes.  And you and I both know that she doesn’t mean to hurt our feelings or make us mad.  She cares about us, both of us.  And when Hermione cares about something, or someone, she throws herself into making sure that they have the very best.  It’s something that makes her an amazing friend.  It’s also something that makes her a pain in the arse sometimes.”
sighs.  “Your Dad grew up without a family, and so he didn’t have the experience with the overwhelming sense of duty that comes along with one like mine.  It only stands to reason that you’d be the same.  Don’t get me wrong,” he said hastily, when it looked as though she were about to defend him.  “Your Dad is the most unfailingly loyal person I know.  This is different.  A family like mine is like a chain around your neck.  It keeps you tethered.  It keeps you secure and safe, yes, but when you’re raised as I am, the first lesson you learn is duty.  There is no pride in failing the family.  Through all my formative years, the responsibility of being a Malfoy was foremost.  It is…was, a difficult paradigm to overcome, especially in the midst of realizing how wrong my beliefs had been.”
I’m unaccountably embarrassed.  This little fellow seems delighted, in his way, to see me, and I don’t know how he’ll take the fact that I don’t remember him.  “Kreacher, that’s your name?” I ask.
“Well we knew that we’d only have a limited amount of time in the warehouse where we set up the potions bust.  The wards kept Harry’s partner out, but not for long.  I couldn’t risk anyone finding out what we’d done.”
“Of course it would recognize you,” Draco said without thinking.  He was remembering again.  A misshapen face, terrified green eyes, the terrible sense of pressure from his parents, desperate for him to recognize Potter, to turn him over to the Dark Lord, and everything would be forgiven.  Knowing, with a sick lurch in his stomach, that it was Potter, and that Draco would never be able to turn him in.   Draco heard a roaring in his ears, and didn’t notice that he’d fallen to his knees until he felt the sharp pain of his kneecaps striking the hard floor.  He counted breaths and recounted them, and the world was getting smaller, and darker, and Draco was dying.
“The Cruciatus curse.  It feels as though your nerves are being burned from the inside out.  It’s an Unforgivable curse.”
The parchment turns out to be a map, and Hermione and Draco study it, both of their heads bent over the table.  Hermione races back to her bag, and pulls out a battered book called “London AZ”.  Draco eyes it in confusion.  “It’s a street map,” Hermione explains, and she quickly flips through the pages.  “I’m nearly certain…”. She carefully examines a page, and refers back to the golden parchment, her eyes flicking back and forth between the two.  “Malfoy,” she says evenly, “do you care to explain why your son is at the Ministry of Magic?”
“Yes,” she says, and I’d bet even money that’s a look of doubt on her face.  “We’ve talked about getting married.”
“Or Harry Potter?” Lara asked, smiling gently at him.  “And that, right there, is why this isn’t a healthy course of action.  Your past is behind you.”
“Well, no of course not, with your memory loss and all.  Needless to say, the corruption runs deep.  Absolute power, you know.”
His thoughts were soon interrupted by the sounds of an argument coming from inside the house.  He sighed.  He had amazing friends, but they bickered constantly.  He honestly wasn’t sure if this was a normal sort of thing for married couples.  He didn’t have a lot of examples to consider.  Certainly Vernon and Petunia were more of a cautionary tale than anything, and Molly and Arthur didn’t seem to talk to one another, but rather talked
Despite all that, I’m collecting a fair amassment of spells, and it’s nice to be able to clean up spilled tea with my wand.  And, when she’s not waxing rhapsodic about Blubbering Humdingers, Luna’s loads of fun.  She invents all sorts of games to make the lessons go faster, including her favourite, one called ‘Secret or Memory’.  The rules are simple, if I cast a spell properly, she tells me a secret or memory, and if I fail to cast it, I owe her one.  I try to explain to her that I don’t have any memories, but she tilts her head at me and smiles, and so I just make stuff up.  It seems to suit us both just fine, and I enjoy the challenge of inventing new memories every time I flub a spell.
They’d been sitting quietly, for quite some time, when Harry’s voice came through the darkness.  “It’s so stupid, you know, but I always considered her sort of a…compensation, I guess.  Like the universe had been keeping score, and Cass was to make up for all the people I’d lost, all the shite things that had happened.”
“Yeah,” Harry said finally, “but I reckon it’s easier to know it all at now.  I hate not knowing stuff.”
She gives me a long look, which makes me uncomfortable, so I change the subject.  “Anyhow, thanks for coming by.  Did you have any news about the curse?”
The slimy git, Smith, is up next, and his testimony is enlightening, if infuriating.  As the test questions are administered, he provides his name and his job title in a clipped, absent tone, and then Marchbanks lights into him.  “Mr. Smith.  How much oversight did you have in the administration of Probation sentences?”
“Merlin, Potter, I hope you’re not this trusting of everyone.  Can I do so now?”  I shrug again, and he positions me in one of the big armchairs, kneeling in front of me so that our eyes are level.  “Legilimens,” he intones.  His eyes are locked on mine, and they’re so pretty, and his position, kneeling in front of me, causes me to imagine those red lips put to use.
Draco ignored a tiny stab of sadness, that he wasn’t able to comfort Harry, and went to floocall the Headmistress, who ordered him aside, thundered through the floo, and flew through the corridors of St Mungo’s like a woman possessed.  “Harry,” she said from the door.  He looked up, and from behind Minerva’s back, Draco thought he looked eleven years old again.
I’m about to open the window when Violet screeches, “Wait!”  My arm skids off the windowsill and I look at her in alarm.  “You didn’t cast the spells.”
I laugh, and it sounds a bit closer to hysteria than I’d like.  “I dunno.  Not really?  I might get my memories back in a week and be absolutely furious with myself.”
“Mate.  We agreed to never mention that again,” Ron says forcefully.  “I don’t mind that you’re bent, but I could do without the memory of Malfoy’s lily-white arse.”
“Are you ready, Cass?  It’s nearly time,” Draco said.  Cass nodded, her face a little nervous.  “You’re going to be extraordinary,” Draco told her, and she smiled brilliantly at him for a moment.
“Two rules then.  Get fucked up, and act like a fucking family.  Am I understood?”  Pansy’s voice got very quiet on the last sentence, and Draco nearly wet his pants.  He nodded.  Ron nodded as well.  Seamus grinned gleefully and topped up everyone’s drinks.
“I know,” he replies.  “Me too.”  His eyes are the only thing that betrays his fear.  I incline my neck and he kisses me.  For a small moment, I want to tell Hermione to leave, to call it off, and then I remember that strange longing that’s been scraping out my insides since I looked at the memories.  Win or lose, I want to try for it all.
“Oh.”  Something in her tone makes me tense.  This is a test, I realize, one that I didn’t mean to set.  If she really meant what she said, she won’t try to talk me out of things with Draco.  She seems to realize the same thing, because she says, “I did look into things with Parkinson.  It was strange.  I sent a few inquiries, and then, suddenly, I got an owl that said she’d been released.”
“Oh, good.”  Harry looked relieved.  His little face was earnest.  “I’ve never had a friend before, Draco.  You’re…you’re amazing.”
“She misses you.”  It’s only because there’s no judgement in the statement at all that Harry doesn’t bristle.  It’s just a statement of fact.
“Malfoy, actually,” Draco replied, stiffening a little, as though he was anticipating John’s reaction.
“I’ll admit,” I say, “my wardrobe is a bit lacking, and I don’t really know what’s fashionable.  Do you think you could help me with everything I need?”
This Chapter, although short, is told from Harry's perspective, and, as you'll see, he's a bit of an unreliable narrator.  I've been thrilled by all of the super-interesting commentary on both Harry and Draco's motivations and actions throughout this story, and I fully expect that this chapter might raise more thoughts.  If it seems like he's all over the place, that's because he is, and I'll ask for your patience and indulgence for a few more chapters.  I promise I'm going somewhere with this!
“Stop talking so loud,” she whispers back, summoning her beaded handbag, which is looking a little threadbare these days.  “Accio hangover potions,” she whispers into its depths, and the bottles clank cheerfully  as they zoom into her hand.
The tears spill over and she reaches a hand toward me, but I step backwards.  I watch her in silence, until her head falls in disappointment, and she walks slowly to the floo.  She looks at me, just before she throws the powder, her face awash with tears, but I just watch her, expressionless, until she disappears in a flourish of green flames.
“Anything,” Draco repeats, his voice stronger.  “It takes magic?  All of my magic?  It doesn’t matter.”
The Manor had changed little in four years.  Draco wasn’t sure what he expected, exactly, since Mother had completely redone it after…well, after.  Despite the updated decor, Draco hated everything about this place, hated hearing the echoes of Aunt Bellatrix’s laugher, hated remembering the nights that he heard Nagini slither past his door, and wondered if this was the night he’d be killed.  His panic rose.  He couldn’t be here, he had to go.  Feeling a trickle of terrified sweat slide down his backbone, Draco turned to leave.
“It was the right thing to do,” Harry’s voice was a little gruff.  It had deepened over the past year.  Coupled with the artfully scruffy stubble he was carrying, Harry had grown into a man.  Draco felt a familiar surge of envy.  What must it be like to be Potter?
Draco busily served drinks, watching Harry out of the corner of his eye, and resolving to finally talk to him after the meal.  Now that he’d admitted the truth to himself, he couldn’t stop staring at the little flecks of grey that had begun to appear at his temple, and the way his eyes never strayed from Cass, even when he was speaking to another.  It was as though a night away from his daughter had been like a week without water, and he couldn’t stop drinking her in.
“Yes, of course,” the healer said.  Draco joyfully went to floo call the relatives, and Minerva.  Astoria beamed and said she’d be back at the hospital within the hour.   As he closed the floo connection, Draco found himself feeling optimistic.  His children were okay.  They’d find out if the bone marrow was doing its job, and Scorpius would be safe.  He and Harry would figure things out, and he was certain that he’d be allowed to see Cass.  It was going to be fine.
“Dunno.  You could hex me, if you wanted.  Or punch me out?  Hermione seemed to get a lot of satisfaction from that, once.”
“I have a brother.”  Cass looked awestruck for a moment, and then pleased.  “Wow.  I mean, I guess I knew it was possible, but wow.  A brother.  How will the Healers fix his blood?”
“I hope so,” Draco said,  “but we’ll have to wait and see.”  Draco’s jitteriness manifested in a bounce in his leg, until Astoria placed a gentle hand on his knee.  He smiled gratefully at her.  She was truly his best friend, and he was so grateful to be going through this with her.
“Well, the last bloke I dated sold a story to the Prophet before the sheets had cooled.  It’s just not worth it.”
“I could see that.  Well, I’m not sure if it will make you feel better, but maybe something happened that made Harry realize he needed to address some things.  It might be good for him.”
“Um, thanks?  But I didn’t think to owl for a reservation for tonight, and I’m sure you don’t have an available table.”
Harry’s dreams change, and instead of facing Lord Voldemort in the clearing in the Forbidden Forest, he stands in front of the Mirror of Erised.  As he looks inside, he sees Lord Voldemort looking back at him.  He awakens, heart pounding, covered in sweat, and wonders if maybe he should have stayed dead.
“No, I’ll firecall Blaise in a moment.”  As Harry starts to leave, Draco says, “I’m glad you’re here.”
“Shut the fuck up!” Another voice commanded from elsewhere in the house.  “I have to work in the buggering morning!”  Pansy.
Apologies for the very short chapter, but it's needed to get us from here to there, and because of the Point-of-view change, it didn't make sense to break it up any other way.  I promise the next few are quite a bit longer, and I'll post the next chapter in a day or so to keep you from having to wait too long.
Even though he’s cold, he decides to sit for a minute longer, listening to the sounds of the night, and watching the stars twinkle.  His introspection is cut short when someone sits next to him.  It’s Draco.  “Well done,” he says, recasting the warming spell.  As a blanket of heat envelops Harry, he sighs.
“Mum will kill you if you try that with Rose,” Weasley cautioned, and Granger tsked in annoyance at him.  “Rose is our baby,” Weasley confided.  “I expect she’s close to Harry’s age.”
The front door banged above them, followed by an unearthly screeching noise.  It seemed that someone in the house was upset about “Filthy blood traitors bringing disgusting Mudbloods into her sacred house.”  Draco was alarmed.  The rest of the occupants of the kitchen seemed to think that this was no less hilarious than the orange explosion.
Harry isn’t sure what will happen with everyone else, whether he’ll ever regain the open trust they once had, but he knows that he and Ron are okay, and for now, that’s enough.
The silence stretched endlessly, Draco steadily drinking, aware of Harry’s gaze on his mouth as he did so.  As the time passed and the tension increased, Harry finally spoke again.  “You’re a bastard, you know?”  His tone was mild, but he didn’t meet Draco’s eyes.
Hermione’s eyes softened in the corners, but she didn’t respond, other than to say, “And his condition has worsened?”
Draco turned back to Astoria and Cici, and allowed himself one single moment.  He closed his eyes, and placed his head in his hands, and sighed, just once.  Then, he squared his shoulders and said, “Right then.  Options?”
“Scorp, that’s the nicest one yet,” Dean said, and Scorpius entertained himself by flying the dragon around Dean’s head.  Dean gave Draco and Astoria a friendly smile, and cast the standard diagnostics.  “Okay buddy,” he said.  “Time to appease the Vampire.”
“My son has worked very hard to restore the Malfoy name to its former level of respectability.   It has been many years since the war, and he has conducted himself faultlessly since then.  I have always been proud of him, but his ability to embrace humility and truly atone for both his and our wrongdoings has made me even more so.”
“No, Harry, absolutely not, you’re not picking out his clothes.  I specifically had robes tailored for this, and if I leave it up to you, you’ll put him in something ghastly.”
“I still can’t understand why we’re basing an entire school governmental structure around a bloody piece of clothing, even if it does talk,” Ron offered.  “Dad always said not to trust anything without a brain.”
It wasn’t as if Draco was any good at refusing his child much of anything, anyway.  “Very well.  Kattie, can you please prepare Scorpius for an outing?”
Harry holds up a hand, requesting her silence while he continues.  “You were.  Everyone does it.  From the moment I got this stupid scar, people have acted like I was public property, and that everyone gets to have a say in the choices I make.  I’m a person, Luna, and I deserve the right to decide things for myself.  If that means that I don’t want to date, or I choose not to share my feelings with others, it’s my decision.  You’re welcome to your opinions, and sometimes, I’ll invite you to share them with me.  But I’m finished with other people deciding things for me, for my own good.  If you think differently, that’s okay.  We don’t have to be friends, and I’ll wish you all the happiness in the world as we go our separate ways.  It’s your choice whether you want to take me as I am, or if you wish to see me as someone who needs fixing.”
Watching RuPaul coach and berate a room full of queens with a bunch of former classmates ranked high up on Draco’s list of 'Weird Experiences I’ve Had'.  It wasn’t quite as fraught as dining with a Dark Lord while your Muggle studies teacher dangled above the table, but it was still surreal.  Ron in particular was highly invested in the show, and when his favourite contestant was eliminated, he threw a bowl of popcorn in fury.  “She was robbed,” he spat in disgust.
“The cake is apple cinnamon, and the icing is caramel,” he says, his voice a bit proud.  Draco loves apple, and his sweet tooth was legendary amongst his housemates.  It’s a perfect choice.  “There’s a surprise inside.”
Overall, Draco reflected to himself, they’d had more successes than failures.  Draco hadn’t been able to convince himself to give Harry a bath…the voices in his head had clamoured insistently at the notion, but Kreacher had been happy to do so the following morning, and Harry had, the elf reported, ‘enjoyed the bubbles’.
I shrug.  “I don’t really know if it matters.  You have priorities, Draco.  Your son, and your friends, and I realize that your life might be too complicated to include me.  I’m attracted to you, and I enjoy spending time with you, so of course I’m disappointed, but if you’re not interested, there’s nothing I can do about that.”
“We all watch Drag Race,” Harry grinned suddenly, and Draco’s heart did another unappealing flip.  Against his better judgement, he flung some of the throw cushions onto the floor and leaned back into the couch while Harry called the housemates.  Harry flopped beside him and Draco was aware of a warm thigh so close to his own that it was nearly touching.   Draco took a breath and tried to ignore it.
“You,” I say.  We’re standing at the apparation point now, and I can’t remember that we’ve walked here.
The next song ends, and clearly he’s still pondering…whatever, because he says, “Do you want a drink?”
Astoria and Scorpius left right away.  Scorpius had Junior Quidditch, and Astoria needed to finish a brief.  Harry and Draco remained on the platform, watching as the train pulled away, and disappeared down the track.  Harry seemed ill at ease once Cass had gone.  Draco asked, “How are you doing?”
“You didn’t, though.” Severus peered out of the frame, eyeing him closely.  “And what are we grappling with this evening?  Overwhelming fear that she’ll be hurt and you won’t protect her, or overwhelming guilt over something you think she’s not getting?”
felt like that, it explained a lot about why coming home would be hard for him.  Suddenly, she realized, that although her Dad didn’t have Family, that didn’t mean that he didn’t have
“We don’t have any evidence of his current actions, but he’s a Malfoy.  Surely your friends have told you about his allegiances during the War?”
After Cass had reluctantly gone to bed, placated somewhat by the promise that Auntie Min would teach her to bake scones the following morning, Harry took the bottle of Scotch from the cupboard, and poured them each a sizeable glass without asking.  Minerva perched on the sofa, while Harry flopped into an armchair, where he could see both Minerva and Severus.
It was only after the incident with the garden hose that Harry realized that he needed to set wards to keep Gimple within the boundaries of Number Twelve.   He considered the matter settled, and had been relieved that a spray of water had been the worst that had happened, since Kreacher would be inconsolable if something more serious happened to his friend.  He ought to have known, he realized, sitting down to eat his dinner.  Kreacher held a grudge like no other living being.
“I don’t understand why it matters!  You didn’t give a fuck about the Slytherins when we were at school, and you certainly didn’t give a fuck about them after the War.  Don’t suddenly grow a conscience.”
“I know.  It sucks to have choice taken away from you.  But you choose what happens in the next six weeks, Draco.  If you want to come to me, I’m here.  I will welcome you into my bed, and I will love you.  If you want to go now, and never see me again, I will accept that, and wish you well.”
Harry was trying to get to his feet, and so Draco rose to his, and held out a hand.  Harry hesitated for a moment before taking it, and before long, they were both back on their feet.
“I had noticed,” Draco drawled.  “Fine, tell Granger.  I could use her help, to be honest.  Will you be telling…” for a moment, Draco struggled to remember the name of the female Weasley, but finally it reappeared, “Ginevra?”
As they approached the ice, Draco inhaled deeply.  The sharp, crisp smell of the ice always filled his senses with excitement.  He’d conjured some dummies who would approximate opponents, and, although they weren’t like playing with team members, at least they’d provide a bit of a barrier to get around.  And these ones weren’t spelled to slam him into the boards, so this practice was already guaranteed to hurt less than a usual one.  He got Harry settled on a bench with a warming charm, and stepped onto the ice.
Harry pushed his glasses up his nose, shrugging.  “Maybe?  He’s scared.  Abused children are often protective of their abusers, and he begged me not to take him away from Draco.”
“What is wrong with you?”  His face is pinker now, but something tells me that it’s no longer any suggestion of attraction.  “Why are you doing this?”
“Really, Aunt?  I would have thought that I made that quite clear earlier.  I’m very fond of Harry, and I am interested in pursuing a relationship with him.”
“Maybe more than friends?” Harry asked, and Draco flushed, looking away.  “Draco, I’m sorry.  I reacted badly because my feelings were hurt, and then I felt stupid, and then all that stuff with Ginny’s trial happened, and I didn’t know how to apologize.”
“Good to know.  I’m sorry I don’t remember you.  According to Ron and Hermione, I like you an awful lot.”
When he paused to take a breath, Draco spotted his chance, and cut in smoothly.  “So, today, Scorpius, do you remember our plans?”
The owl that arrived the following morning was beginning to look irritated that he was back.  Draco was shocked to see him, but said, “Go find one of the elves and they’ll get you a snack,” as he untied the letter.  The owl cocked its head at Draco, as though he were unsure why Draco wasn’t fetching the snack himself.  Draco ignored the bird, and unwrapped the parchment.
The silence that follows is companionable.  Draco turns to face him.  “What’s going on behind those big, sad eyes,” he asks, but Harry doesn’t feel pressured to answer.
He knew that Hermione had granted him access to their floo, and was still utterly touched by the gesture of faith.  In the end, he spent two hours hovering beside the flames of his own floo, wishing with his entire being that he was strong enough, but ultimately, the fear would take over, and he’d be left huddled in a heap on the floor, trying to catch his breath. In complete disgust with himself, Draco went to bed and tossed and turned all night.
Molly looks at him as though startled to see him.  “Oh yes, dear, of course.”  She continues sitting, staring into the flames.  Harry gives Ron a look.
“Listen, I just wanted to let you know, I’m going back to the Burrow, picking up Rose, yeah?  Harry’s out like a light, he’s been bathed, and I put him to bed.”
“Thank Merlin!”  I hear Draco’s voice, and I try to respond, but everything’s heavy, and tired, and I slip into sleep again.
George sits next to Angelina Johnson, Lee Jordon on his other side.  They speak quietly to him, and at one point, Harry is pleased to see a little smile appear on his face, even if it drifts away just as quickly.  Percy and his girlfriend Audrey appear, followed by Bill and Fleur.  As the night passes, Harry looks at Molly and Arthur, taking in their weary countenance.  “Maybe you might like some rest?”
I don’t look at him as I tuck myself away, and I say nothing as I walk through the alley.  Despite my release, it didn’t compare to the bliss that sex with Draco brought.  Deflated, inexplicably ashamed, I decide to head home, but as I’m walking past the line in front of the club, which now snakes even farther down the sidewalk, a distinctive flash of blond catches my peripheral vision.  I can’t apparate, not from here, but I walk more quickly.  “Harry!”
“Something like that.  But I wonder what would happen to your reputation if everyone knew about how far you actually would go to make sure that you keep everyone in their pre-appointed little box?”  He laughs, but it’s emotionless and hollow.  “Honestly, girl?  You think you can cling to your high horse after what you’ve done?  Does your precious Saviour have any idea what you’ve done to him?  You can’t justify your own actions any more than I can.”
Sarah’s eyes lit up.  “The carrot one?”  Harry grinned.  She opened it, and took an enormous bite, moaning in delight.  “Are you sure you’re not into women?”
“Kreacher is a good house elf, and there is no trouble for serving his Master.”  And, just like that, he’s back to being offended.
The next few years are a halcyon blur of weddings, and babies, helping people move into new houses, and more parties than Harry can count.  The group gets together at least once a month and it’s a more wholesome affair these days, lunch, not dinner, with children running through the garden of whomever is hosting, and the inevitable Quidditch match that follows is far less bloodthirsty than it was.  Harry has taken over from Madame Hooch as Flying Instructor at Hogwarts, and so he’s mostly exempted from hosting, so long as he convinces the Hogwarts elves to supply him with some sort of dessert.  Harry loves teaching flying and refereeing Quidditch, and he loves his friends, and he’s now Godfather to five separate children, whom he spoil rotten.  It’s a much fuller life than he ever dreamed of, back when he was a small boy in a small cupboard.  He’s content.
“How did Draco Malfoy escape this?  From what I hear, he was one of only a few students who took the Dark Mark.”
Malfoy slumped into the chair opposite Harry and put his head in his hands for a moment.  When he looked up, his face was bleak.  “I don’t understand what’s causing this,” he sighed.  “I didn’t have problems with my magic like this.”
“Harry,” Draco said evenly, his face revealing nothing, but his eyes warm.  Harry managed a nod, and a weak smile.
“Yeah, the Black madness took her.  She’s in Janus Thickey.  Come to think of it, she started going downhill right after you left.”
“Harry,”  he says, stopping in his tracks to look at him.  Harry absently notices that he’s not wearing shoes, which is a bold choice for November.
Draco, who was sitting next to him, murmured soothingly, petting his hair back and peppering kisses on the little face.  As he overcame his disorientation, he blinked up at his parents.  “Is it over?”
She waylays me in the doorway, Ginny, that is, not Molly, and kisses my cheek.  “You smell like outside,” I say.
“It’s not really a schoolboy conflict, but that’s good to hear.  If, after I tell you everything, you decide that you can’t represent me, I’ll understand, but I’ll ask you not to speak of what I’m telling you.  Can you live with that?”
“Nah, not right now,” Ron said.  “I’ve got memories to show them.  We’ll need each of you to formally put something down before her trial, but I can come by later and arrange things.  I think it’s not a bad idea to get Harry away for a bit.  Maybe stay at Draco’s for a few days.”
Ron, Hermione and Draco exchanged helpless looks.  They waited a terribly long time, and when Harry didn’t reappear, Draco said, “I’ll go and see.”
“And even though I contract to the Ministry, it’s never been public knowledge,” Draco said, a little ruefully.  The Ministry had been desperate for someone with Draco’s skills, but insisted that he sign a binding magical non-disclosure agreement to prevent him from publicizing the arrangement.  They were clearly trying to avoid the bad publicity that would result from having an ex-Death Eater working with the DMLE, but unfortunately, it hadn’t done anything to restore Draco’s reputation.  Before he’d been completely housebound, he still got hexed and spat on in Diagon Alley.  Yet another thing that Paul had been unable to live with, he recalled.
As he checked his watch, Harry allowed himself to hope that maybe he’d overestimated the interest that there would be in his return to England.    Perhaps nobody cared.  He prayed that nobody had shown up, and he could simply go back to living his life in obscurity.  His hopes were dashed, when Greg entered the room, and said, “It’s really filling up in there.”
is what he’d been fighting for.  It isn’t as if the old prejudices were completely gone.  Some of the older families still cling to their blood-purity ideals.  Some of the children of Death Eaters still get accosted and spat on in Diagon Alley.  But somehow, he can sit in a pub, across from his once-nemesis and his henchman, and share a pint, while Luna braids Greg’s fringe.  Harry allows himself to believe that things are finally looking up.
The office, when he arrived, was busy, team members coming off shift, replacements arriving.  Their boss, a no-nonsense witch named Juniper Buckley, who reminded Harry of Minerva McGonagall, hustled them into the conference room for the Thursday meeting.  Tamsin and Harry found seats at the back of the room.  The Thursday meeting was where assignments and special projects were doled out, and Harry and Tamsin always had the same assignment.  Tamsin occupied herself by levitating a quill off the table, sending it to tickle the ear of Linden Nettle, a man who she and Harry both loathed.
Harry smiled thinly.  “Well played, Malfoy,” he said quietly, then he wrapped his arm around his daughter and ushered her into the floo.
When I awaken next, it’s dark.  I fumble for my glasses, and hear a sleepy mutter beside me.  “Draco?”
“My son,” he says, and then he’s gone, and the door shuts firmly, and I sit there, stunned, in the dark.
“I was here.  I assure you I didn’t end up with Ginny fucking Weasley.  Not only is she a girl but she’s also like my sister.  Where are you getting this idea?”
on my own.  I have lovely friends, and I’m more grateful to them than I can ever say.  But I don’t really have anyone.  I have to make a decision, and I have to make it on my own.”
“Oh, family of Narcissa’s, then.  You’re quite welcome, child.”  His face suddenly twisted.  “She’s not Andromeda’s daughter, is she?”
Draco laid in the dark, listening to Harry’s even breaths, tears silently falling down his cheeks.  His hand forced, Draco knew that there was no way he could stay.  He’d fallen for Harry; maybe it had happened years ago, perhaps it was more recent, but the Draco who had watched Harry Potter die to defeat the Dark Lord had grown up.  He’d been a selfish prat as a child, and he knew that this was his punishment.  He’d escaped the war with his life, and his freedom, and Draco knew better than to think he deserved anything more.
“No,” I reply honestly.  “I may think that I’ve made a terrible mess of things, if I ever get my memory back.  But I’ll figure things out.  I think I’m good at that.”
“Maybe this was a mistake,” Harry muttered.  He looked wretched, and Draco felt a burst of sympathy.
“And you’re disgusting, Granger.  You’re quick to assume the moral high ground, as though you know best, about house elves, and your precious Order of the Phoenix, and yet you stop short of doing anything that will have a lasting impact.  Your hands are too clean to sully with doing the hard work to ensure that we stay safe.
Harry’s cock inside Draco fills him completely.  His hands grab Draco’s hips roughly, and he’s thrusting hard and fast, his skin slapping against Draco’s. He slams against Draco’s prostate, and impossibly soon, Draco’s seeing stars, and his seed is spattering his chest and Harry’s. With a whimper that’s almost a sob, Harry’s coming inside Draco.  They collapse against one another, too spent to cast a cleansing spell until their bodies are stuck together with dried come.  Harry yipes as he separates them.  Casting Tergeo, Harry peppers gentle kisses on Draco’s tightly closed eyes, murmuring endearments.  “Baby.” Kiss. “Never.” Kiss.  “Doubt.” Kiss.  “That I.” Kiss.  “Worship.” Kiss. “You”. Kiss.  Harry kisses the tears as they roll down Draco’s cheeks.
“Thanks.  I suppose a lawyer will help when Draco sues me for custody as well.  They can help me try to get visitation.”
Resolute, I catch the eye of a man with red-brown hair.  His smile is wide and open, completely uncomplicated.  His brown eyes meet mine and there’s a connection, a flare of interest.  We dance for a few songs, the touches innocent, but a surreptitious look at his crotch confirms that he’s here for the same thing I am.  I don’t even bother meeting his eyes, just turn and walk towards the door that leads to the alleyway beside the club.  I know he’s behind me.  I can feel his gaze, hot on my back.
Harry saw no flaw in these instructions as well, so he did so, hoping that Cass thought he was distracted because of the rush to catch his portkey.  Just like he’d done as a child, when teachers or other adults asked too many questions about things at home, he managed to answer Cass’ questions coherently, while a large portion of his mind wailed in terror at being found out.  He was nearly out of her room when the voice in his mind said,
“It’s hard to show solidarity for a relationship that four people know about,” Harry says.  “And the only reason you two know is because you stumbled in on-"
“You really are just like this,” she says, a funny look on her face.  It’s similar to what Draco said to me before.
“Fine.  Broken nose, black eye, both healed.  You broke two different photographers’ equipment in the scuffle.”
It’s a mess, really, hot, and wet, I’m covering him with my saliva, my hand instinctively surrounding the lower part of his cock, because I can’t seem to take the whole length of him without gagging.  I need to work on my technique.  I bob my head experimentally, and when I taste his precome on my tongue, I can’t help but groan.  This prompts one in return from him, and so I deduce that I’m doing something right.  I need his mouth again.  I come up on my knees, kiss him filthily, our tongues plunging into each others’ mouths.
“Why is a known Dark Wizard working in a position of authority within our only financial institution?”
Cass didn’t answer, and she tried to put it out of her mind, but she couldn’t, not completely.  When she got home, she opened her laptop, and typed an email:
“The mind isn’t meant to be manipulated like that.  As children, when Pureblooded parents teach their children to build basic skills, it’s part of the fundamental lessons, and parents will actively monitor how often their heirs make use of it.  It’s one of the reasons why I was so furious with Hermione for her ham-fisted attempts to manage your wild magic.  If someone occludes for too long, they can experience a complete disassociation with their emotions.  The night that you confronted me in Moaning Myrtle’s bathroom was the first time that I had dropped my shields in months.  Having all of that fear and pain come back all at once nearly broke my mind.”
“Yes, I didn’t expect to be back in town, especially with so little notice, but circumstances required it.  Do you think you could call me Harry?  I feel like we’re a bit beyond the last name stuff.”
“Yours.” Draco nodded, shouldered his hockey bag and started walking out of the arena.  As they were leaving, he saw a few of his teammates.
Draco laughs.  “Mostly.  I think, knowing what I know now, that we’re both gay, and that the sexual tension between us is incredible, who knows what sort of unconscious desires lay buried underneath all of our childhood squabbling?”
“Ah, I see, so he’s still to be shunned, and excluded from society, but not outright persecuted.  Remind me, Kingsley, were we trying to entice a new Dark Lord to rise?”
“What I know, sure.  It was strange, Harry.  We got separated, and the wards ejected me, but you were trapped inside.”
“But, wouldn’t I have more privacy at Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunias?  They don’t even know that magic is real.”
“They are,” I admit, “but I don’t know if they can.  I need someone different.  Someone who has…specialty skills.”  I’m not certain if I was any good at flirting before, but the way his eyes widen slightly suggest that I’m a bit better at it these days.  Or, perhaps I’m just so eager to shag him that I’m unable to keep my tone free of innuendo.
“I would,” Harry says.  “I’ll have to call the Ministry to come sort all this faff out before I can move on anyhow.”
“Alright, lad, but on one condition,” Mister Fortesque says.  “You’ll call us Florean and Ellen, yes?”
“No, I need to find some irrefutable proof first.  Ron is going to flip out about this, and if I can’t appeal to the Auror in him, I’ll never convince him that his little sister is giving his best friend roofies.”
He considered this, and then nodded, and said, “Mama, I just don’t feel green today.  Today is a blue day.”
“Despite your unbelievably clear signal, I’m afraid I was at a loss as to what you wanted,” Draco said, and Harry laughed once more.  Draco thought that nothing had ever made him happier than to hear Harry laughing like this, and then Harry stood on his tiptoes, and his lips pressed against Draco’s again.  As he wound his fingers into Harry’s hair, Harry’s tongue questingly traced the line of his lips, Draco opened his mouth, and as the kiss deepened, Draco realized that he was wrong.  That happiness was a virtually uncharted expanse lying ahead of him, with Harry at his side.
“So you’re a real catch, then?”  Harry’s smile is so fond that Draco wants to cry at the sight of it.
“I think it’s possible.  Ginny has always been head over heels for Harry.  And, she’s the youngest child, the only girl, and she’s terribly indulged.  She isn’t used to being refused.  I hate to think this of my sister-in-law, but Harry…well, he’s Harry, isn’t he?” Her smile grew fonder.  “Harry is my brother, in all but blood.  He’s more my family than anyone, except Ron.”
“You can’t ask him anything!  I feel like Papa and Grand-Mère both answer my questions, but they’re talking in riddles or something.  I never understand what they mean.”
.  Draco had managed to stay away for the past four years, because he’d kept himself going with thoughts of Harry happily with his She-Weasel.  It seemed that somehow everything had gotten cocked up.  Draco wasn’t a brave man, and he was very, very seldom an honourable one.  If his sacrifice hadn’t worked, if he’d left Harry here sad, and thin and broken somehow, well, Draco was going to fucking well find out how this had happened.
“Why are you like this?” Draco asked suddenly.  “The Harry I used to know wouldn’t have hesitated to call me a bastard for what I did.”
“Stop.”  Draco barely recognizes his voice.  He pushes past Blaise, ready to apparate somewhere, anywhere else.
“Well,” Draco said thoughtfully, “I do recall some potion makers that were a bit more Knockturn than Diagon, if you know what I mean.  I could put out a few feelers, if you like.”
“Thank you.  How…” Draco’s voice cracked, for just a moment, before he regained his composure.  “How long?”
“No,” Draco said shortly.  He didn’t have any, as they’d all been freed by the Ministry as part of the reparations after the war.
“See?  That’s the sort of job I should have.  Something a bit fun.”  I feel restless.  “Hey, let’s go to Diagon.  Also, why would I remember Diagon, but not the Ministry?  Why don’t I remember Hogwarts?”
“Yes,” Draco said, hoping that something enormous would fall on the house and kill him dead so that he wouldn’t have this conversation.  “Well.”
to maintain.  Besides, if I have any hope of being seen as more than just a Death Eater, I have to be above reproach.”
“You didn’t get it wrong, though.  Draco, do you have any doubt how much I care about Harry’s well-being?”  Draco shook his head.  “And do you think that if I had even the slightest reservations, I’d risk administering this potion?  Harry is fine, even if he is a baby.  There’s no downside to waiting and doing more research, if the situation warranted it.  But it doesn’t.  The reversal potion is perfect.  The ratios are correct.  It’s time to administer the first dose.”
Harry hung his head.  He couldn’t look into Mrs. Malfoy’s eyes.  Perhaps she’d ask him to leave England now.  He didn’t want to leave Cass to endure the Bone Marrow treatment alone.  He didn’t think it was fair to not do everything to pave the way for her relationship with Draco.  But, he owed Narcissa a life debt, and, if asked, he’d have to agree, wouldn’t he?
Her days became routine, and lengthened into weeks, and she and Scorpius did lessons, and visited the Manor, and went to Diagon with Papa and Astoria.  But still, Cass worried about her Dad.  His emails were short, usually just one line, but they kept coming, even if they got further and further apart, and Cass’ stomach would hurt until the next one came.
Kingsley is next on the stand, and as the Verituserum is administered, he glares at me and Draco.  Draco’s hand on my arm tightens, and I barely notice that I’ve drawn closer to him.
Scorpius shook his head.  “What is it?” Harry asked.  “You seem kind of scared.”  He was trying to control his reactions, but alarm bells were ringing in his head.  It was just that…Harry remembered crying in a principal’s office after suddenly finding himself on the school roof.  He remembered the gut-wrenching terror of what would face him when he got home.  He remembered the stifling, endless darkness of his cupboard after doing something freakish.
Eventually, our breathing returns to normal.  He’s looking at me, his brow wrinkled, as though he can’t figure me out.  Finally, he asks, “What was that?”
He wanted her to be a child, and to rely on the adults around her to take care of her.  He’d seen that Harry had worried about the same things early on, but Harry had lacked the ability to provide her with true emotional safety.  Draco had spent countless hours with Cass’ Healer, discussing her progress, and ways to support her.  His dedication to these goals had solidified the relationship between them, and Draco was thrilled to see the progress they’d made together.
“What would you have me do?  The Ministry wanted a lame duck that they could parade around Diagon Alley in a pretty set of robes.  They wanted to strip him of his magic, they were trying to find a way to overcome his ability to throw off Imperius.  I didn’t think I had a choice.”
“I’m not sure,” Potter said, shrugging off the robes, and looking down.  His legs were liberally coated.
Tamsin looked enraged, but allowed Harry to pull her to his office.  She spent the next ten minutes ranting about the size of Nettle’s cock, his beady little eyes, and what an enormous waste of space he was.  Harry made soothing noises, finished the bun, and reviewed his schedule for the day.
Harry sighed, and looked over to where Draco and Cass were exchanging tentative smiles.  Cass caught Harry’s eyes and waved.  Draco looked up at him, and then looked away just as quickly.  “Yes.  I loved him so much that I would have done anything for him.”
Cass hesitated for a moment, and then threw her arms around her father.  “It doesn’t matter,” she muttered.  “I don’t care if he doesn’t want me either.  You’re still my dad.  It’s okay.”
I consider sending Draco an owl, but realize that: a) I had no owl and b) I’d left things in Draco’s hands.  So, I consider going for a run, but, having just showered, I have no desire to do the whole thing over again.  I’m bored, and there’s nothing to do in this stupid flat.  This isn’t exactly what I imagined when I woke up in a hospital bed and learned I was a wizard.  Finally, I put on a pair of new denims and a bottle green jumper and find a butter soft leather motorcycle jacket in the front hall.  As I slip it on, I’m immediately suffused with a sense of comfort and wellbeing.  It can’t be a coincidence that it was the only not-foul piece in my wardrobe from before.  This is a good jacket.
Ginny, who had come to when the Aurors apparated in, was screaming abuse at her brothers, at Hermione, at Harry.  She ignored Draco completely, which, in retrospect, was fine by Draco.  As a young, fresh-faced Auror who looked like he’d just stepped out of Hogwarts placed the cuffs around her wrists, she descended into hysterical sobs.  “Harry,” she wept.  “I love you.  I only did this because I love you.”
Draco heartily agreed, but said, “Yes, Mother, of course it is.”  He’d found, in his dealings with his parents, that the best defence was a confident offence.  “And to what do we owe the pleasure of your company?  Are you joining us for dinner?”
Draco looks like he has a lot more to say on the topic, but a house elf pops into the breakfast room and announces that Luna has arrived.
“Scorpius?  What’s going on?”  The voice from another room was familiar, but Harry couldn’t immediately place it.  It all became clear though, when Scorpius’ father rounded the corner.  “Potter?”
Oh.  Alright, I could see myself doing that.  I'm relieved that I'm not taking a bribe or anything, but this is morally, a bit grey.
“But you’ve never seen him actually take anything?  You’ve never found a vial, or an envelope full of powder?”
“Alright,” Harry agreed, a little bemused that he and Malfoy were managing to be polite to one another.  He looked fondly at Scorpius and realized that if it weren’t for him, they likely wouldn’t be.  It seemed obvious that Draco loved his son, and Harry was essentially helpless to resist a request of a child.  Besides that, another visit to Scorpius’ home would provide another opportunity to assess what was prompting Scorpius’ magical outbursts.  Harry wasn’t ready to absolve Draco completely for making Scorpius feel unsafe, and he felt better being able to see more.
Draco became aware of a growing coolness in the hand he held, and it became obvious that his Mother wasn’t breathing any longer.  It was over.  Narcissa Black-Malfoy had died.  Draco knew he needed to call the Healer, arrange the interment ceremony.  It would wait though.  Right now, Draco sat beside his Mother’s bedside and gazed at the face who had loved him, taught him, disciplined him.  The lines of pain that had become constant during the time he’d been home had stilled.  Her suffering had ended.  There was no end in sight for Draco’s.
Harry’s condition was the other item that had cast a pall on his current happiness.  Draco carried an enormous amount of guilt over his inability to see that Harry was so wounded.  Inadvertently, he’d made things so much worse in the way he’d treated Harry during their relationship, and had solidified the damage by his actions when Harry had returned to England with Cass.  Whether he’d intended to hurt Harry or not, Draco acknowledged that he had.   Confronted by the impacts of his lack of caring, each week as he and Cass attended ‘Visitor’s Day’, it was impossible to ignore.
And then they danced around the room, whooping and cheering, and Hermione flung her arms around him.  Draco stilled, his entire body tense.  “I’m so sorry,” Hermione said immediately.  “I forgot.”
“Like knowing how the sausage is made,” Draco said, apropos of nothing, and all three of them gave him a slightly confused look.
Draco’s mouth twists for a moment, before he breaks into the most heart-stoppingly beautiful smile that Harry’s ever seen.  “Yes, Harry.  I have interest.”
“I’m not sure that this is a time for assigning blame,” Astoria shot back.  “I, for one, am delighted to meet Cass, and I want to know all about her.  And I’m sure that Cass has questions for all of us as well.”
This prompted another one of those brilliant smiles of Harry’s, and he said, “Good.  We’ll take it slow, figure things out together.”
Draco was surprised.  Purebred witches didn’t leave the family home until their marriage, and so for her to have left the Parkinson home suggested something truly shocking.  “You don’t live at Winfeather any longer?”
“It’s…um…nice that you dressed Harry for dinner, Draco.  Anyway, I’ve been doing some research, and I’m interested to compare the chemical compounds of some of the more common street potions to what Harry fell into.”
“Minister, that’s an awfully personal question, and I am quite sure it goes beyond the limits of what my employer is legally permitted to ask me.”
loves Harry.  Even Draco has to admit that, now that he’s not sharing a soul with a madman, he's surprisingly easy to get along with.  Harry flirts indiscriminately with everyone he crosses paths with, and Draco supposes that they’re flattered by the attention of the ‘Man who Saved us All’.
“Harry,” his voice was croaky.  “You’re here.”  His mind stupidly grappled with seeing someone from his other life here in his new one.
Harry sighed, pushed his fringe out of his eyes.  His gaze met Draco’s for a moment, then he bit his lip and looked away.  “Because, Draco.  I’m so fucking tired of this war, and losing so many people.  It’s been such a fucking waste.  You deserve more than to rot away in Azkaban.  I reckon that you were born into your role the same way I was.”
His eyes flashed to Miriam, and then he looked at Draco.  He was petting Hank again, stroking, stroking the long, soft ears, looking as though he would give just about anything to be elsewhere.  “Alright,” he said softly, and Draco was filled with admiration.  Harry took a breath, and then said, “I have issues with abandonment.  I try really hard to please people so that they won’t reject me, and when they leave me-” Miriam cleared her throat and frustration flitted across Harry’s expression before he corrected, “if I feel rejected, it validates all of the things I blame myself for.  I carry a lot of guilt for those people who died during the war, and if someone gets angry with me, or when…” he swallowed, “when a relationship ends, I use those circumstances as validation for not deserving love in the first place.”
The article, splayed across the front page of the Prophet, when the paper finally arrives, is brilliant:
Back in the castle, Harry feels unsettled.  He’d managed to avoid thinking about everything during his self-imposed exile, but he can’t stop grappling with his feelings at seeing his friends again, and Luna and Draco’s words echo through his mind.  Just as he had as a student, he takes to roaming the castle at night, his emotions warring.  He’s content, he tells himself, he doesn’t need to risk losing everything by selfishly wanting more.
Draco felt tears prickling at the back of his throat, and swallowed hard to prevent a wail from escaping.  If he allowed himself to, he’d never stop crying.  Fortunately, his breakdown was diverted by the arrival of his ex-wife.
“I’m glad,” Draco said, smiling.  “I didn’t expect that I’d show up here with an adorable puppy and be automatically forgiven or something, but I just had to know.  To see if we could maybe see each other sometimes, and maybe be friends, for real this time.  And maybe…”
able to help others.  If you’re responsible for the care of someone else, and you become unconscious due to lack of oxygen, you’ll never be able to help others.  Do you see how this analogy is relevant to your circumstances?”
“I’m not really mad about you lying about us being friends.  I guess I understand.  But it’s just…a lot.  Would you mind if I stayed with Ron and Hermione for a bit?”
Later that night, after dinner had ended, and they’d flooed home, Scorpius asleep on Draco’s shoulder, Draco looked in on Cass.  She was lying in the big bed in the spare room, and she looked rather small and frightened under the coverlet.  “Alright?” Draco asked.
Hermione comes through in eight minutes, not ten, and Rose is thrilled to be introduced to Violet.  The two of them scamper off, Kreacher slinking after them, secretly delighted, but acting as though he’s shouldering an enormous burden.
“So polite,” she said approvingly.  “Your Father said that you were going to the canteen.  Do you think that you could eat five bites of whatever he puts in front of you?”
“We are,” she says.  “I would have liked to have gone to Uni, but that’s impossible.  There’s too much work here, and we’d never be able to afford to pay someone a living wage.”  Her smile is a little wistful.  “Unless you know someone who will work for ice cream.”
Seamus and Dean arrive then, with reinforcements, in the form of several bottles of fire whiskey, and, rather unexpectedly, Blaise Zabini.  He’d remained neutral during the war, and in the past year, he and Dean have grown close.  Harry is the first one over to greet them.  He hugs them all in turn, hugging Blaise a little longer than Dean and Seamus, and saying, “It’s good that you’re here, mate.  Thanks for coming.”
“Master!” His house elf, who was doing something in the sink when Harry arrived, straightened and whirled around.  Harry looked at his face carefully.  Normally, he’d be berating Harry over the time, or the fact that he hadn’t apparated into the backyard, and he
“Pansy  Parkinson?”  Mill nods. Hermione looks at me strangely.  “You want me to help Pansy Parkinson?”
“Interesting that there’s been no negative press though, only a lot of speculation about star-crossed lovers in Wartime.”
Cici bustled back in, her face wreathed in smiles.  “I have the results of Cass’ blood tests.  I’m absolutely delighted to tell you that she’s an excellent match.”
Harry returned to the kitchen to find Cass standing on the countertop, rooting in an upper cupboard.  This was a habit that had been much-discussed in the Potter household, but since half of its living inhabitants were firmly opposed to the practice, while the other half equally convinced that it was an efficient way for short people to get things done, a stalemate was declared.  Cass leapt lightly down from the counter, but the second her toe touched the tile, Harry knew that the angle was wrong.  Cass collapsed into an elegant little heap, holding her ankle tightly.
He’s breathing fast, his cheeks pink, tiny drops of sweat beading on his forehead.  I’m so hard, and I can feel the orgasm building, starting from my toes and rippling through my legs.  I frantically rut against him, and he lets out the most delicious little whimper I’ve ever heard.  “Close,” he gasps, and I nod, the ability to speak having vanished.  “Harry,” he says, throwing his head back onto the pillow.  I feel his cock pulsing, the warm gush of his come against our bellies, and I helplessly follow him over the edge.  I’m losing feeling in my arms, and I carefully lever myself onto the bed next to him, trying desperately to get my breathing under control.  I feel as though my bones have gone to jelly.  I’m too spent to even look at him, and I stare at the ceiling, wondering how I didn’t figure this out earlier.  He clumsily grabs my hand, raises it in the air weakly and croaks, “Yay.”
“That’s a hard question to answer, Harry,” Draco said honestly.  “It’s confusing, because you, right now, in this time, are actually twenty-two years old, even if your body and your mind are currently just seven.  Within a couple of weeks, you’ll be back to being twenty-two, and in the time between now and then, I can promise you that you will be completely safe.”
“Aww, Harry, I don’t know.  I think Luna and Hermione have awful bloody cheek to try to nag you into something you haven’t asked for.  But, aside from that,” and here Ron looks at him, his blue eyes as clear and honest as they always have been, “I think that you’re my best mate, and that there’s nothing I wouldn’t do to see you happy.  I think you’ve been through all sorts of shit, and it’s left you a bit scared of asking for anything for yourself.  And, I think that the people who love you would be thrilled to bring you a piece of the moon if you managed to ask for it.”
Draco’s heart broke a little, as seemed to be common when spending time with Harry, but Narcissa merely smiled gently at him, and said, “You’re a lovely boy, Harry Potter.”
The earless wonder sits me down on a squashy sofa and says, with not a little bit of mischief in his voice, “So, Harry, tell me everything.”
“Soon,” I soothe.  “Need to taste you.”  My hands hesitate at the waistband of his pants, but when I look into his eyes, he nods frantically, and so I strip them off, pulling them, and his jeans, off his legs and casting them aside.  Now that he lies here, naked in front of me, I experience a momentary setback as I realize that I’ve probably never done this.  Regardless, mouth on cock seems like a start.  He’s big, and I can’t imagine fitting all of him inside my mouth, but I really, really want to try.  I take him in my hand, mouth along the length.  He hisses, and I feel his hand in my hair.  I wrap my mouth around the tip of his cock, guarding my teeth, and allowing my tongue to mould around as much of him as I can.  He clamours to a kneeling position, his hand running down my back, cupping my arse.
“Of course, mate,” Ron says easily, and Harry is so grateful for his friend that he wants to weep.  “The next few days are going to be weird enough without adding something so undignified as
“It’s a muggle thing.  A knee brace.  My joints were a little messed up.  One too many Cruciatus curses.  This just makes sure my knee stays aligned.”  Draco pulled a set of hockey socks over his trackpants, more because the colours of his team made him smile than anything.
With plans finalized, Cass and Draco flooed over to the Manor.  A house elf popped in to greet them right away.  “Master Draco!” The elf was beside herself with joy.  “You is here!  And you is bringing young Mistress of the House of Malfoy!  Madame Narcissa is being in the gardens.”
“Yes, she was.  She doesn’t see Scorpius, though.  She moved to Austria after he was born.  She’s not really the…maternal type.”
“Oh.”  Draco looked startled for a moment.  “I’m not sure, we’ll have to ask him.  Maybe we could find a Muggleborn Tutor for you.”
Harry inwardly rolled his eyes at the ‘Mister Potter’ but school rules were what they were, and he dismissed the girls with high fives, fist bumps, or waves.  He watched as Sarah checked each girl out with their associated picker-upper, and made sure that nobody had been left behind.  Except Cass, of course, who was dragging the dummy into the storage room.  He was headed over to help her when a voice said, “Mister Potter?”
Just saying her name opened the floodgates.  Astoria’s huge blue eyes filled with tears.  He knelt between her knees, and held her chin with his hand, while wiping her tears away with the other.  “Dray, I’m so scared,” she wept.  “I don’t know what to do.”
It’s happened a million times before.  Hermione is relentless, and now when Harry sees that recognizable ‘must fix Harry’ look on her face, he makes a hasty exit.  Neville suggests potential mates like a sommelier would present fine wines, but he’s affable enough when Harry declines.  Pansy seems to delight in loudly pointing out potential partners and rating them out of ten.  Harry is sick to death of it all.  “What, Luna,” he says finally, when it’s clear that she’s not going to be distracted from her mission.
“Draco, he’s not breathing,” Hermione muttered, lifting Harry’s little t-shirt and bending her head to his chest.
As I follow Kingsley to my desk, I can’t help but wonder, why did old me want this job anyway?  My desk is obsessively tidy, with small piles of parchment, tabbed and carefully annotated in tiny writing.  It seems incongruous with the type of student that Hermione and Ron described, but clearly I’ve developed new habits.  I find the file about the potions smugglers easily, and I ask Kingsley if someone can owl it to my house.  I don’t want to go home yet, but I’m a bit at loose ends.
Despite the fact that I’ve pretty much reached the end of my patience, I keep my voice even.  “Listen, I can understand that if I wasn’t out to you guys before, you’re a bit surprised, but I don’t think you’re going to be able to yell at me and turn me straight, even if you really, really want me to be.”  They look dubious, and I’ve had it.  “But, if you don’t believe me, let’s go find Jenny, and I’ll see what I can do.”  Of course, I have no intention at all of seeing what we can do, but it’s been a strange couple of days, and I’m starting to get awfully tired of people doubting one of the things I have actual empirical data to support.  Ron goes purple again, and seems incapable of speech, which…good.  (Also, I didn’t forget that her name was Ginny that time, but there’s a small part of me that’s really enjoying winding them up a little).
“It was a mistake.  I was just leaving.” Draco knew he sounded like a prat, but all he wanted was to get out of this place and drink so much that he forgot that this night had ever happened.  And hex Pansy until that bitch cried.
Well, Draco thought, that would have to wait for another time, because he was getting the fuck out of this madhouse.  He gave her a tight smile, and when she moved aside, he continued moving towards the kitchen door.  Only to walk smack into Harry Potter.  He froze, and Harry did the same.  “Draco?” his voice was tiny, disbelieving.
“He’ll always be The One, Pansy.  But just because you love someone, it doesn’t obligate them to love you back.”
“Yeah, but if he’d done something bad, you would have heard, right?  Like, say he was stirring up a bunch of shite, rallying all of Voldemort’s buddies?  He works for the Bank, Hermione, I’m sure they do a ton of background checks.  He doesn’t even talk to his schoolmates anymore.”
“It’s Molly, dear.  I know that your family and ours don’t get on, but after our Harry stood up for you after the War, you haven’t caused a spot of trouble.  I’d say it’s time to let bygones be bygones.”
Harry stiffened for a moment, as though he realized who was holding him, but said, “She is.  She’s going to be fine, and she’s going to grow up and be a brilliant witch.”  His tears seemed to have abated, and, reluctantly, Draco let him go, standing up to resume his seat on Cass’ other side.
“I know.”  He twists on his heel, and disapparates with a pop, leaving me standing in the doorway, unable to contain the enormous grin that’s spread across my face.
“Dunno,” I say.  “Try not to get mad? I expect not working for the nutters at the Ministry will help.”
“I don’t know what it was about the the things I experienced that made me such a fucking…martyr to Wizarding society.  I get orphaned and nearly murdered as a baby, shunted off to relatives that hated me, alternately vilified and glorified by the press, walked willingly to my death, and then devote my sad, boring adult life to continuing to risk my hide to keep this place safe.  Why didn’t I ever want to watch the whole thing burn? Or,” I continue, “why haven’t I fucked off to some deserted cabin in the woods?”
It was 9:30.  Since he hadn’t told Harry what time to arrive, Draco figured he might as well go start his training, and the elves would get Harry to him if he did show up.  The room that Draco had commandeered as his dryland training room had been a conservatory, in earlier days.  There were wide windows throughout, and many of the plants that Narcissa had lovingly tended still lived, if feebly.  Draco had shoved them all into a corner, and transfigured a pile of old orchid pots into his equipment.  The treadmill had been more difficult to conjure, and so Draco had ordered it online using his phone, and cast a handy spell to ensure it ran without electricity.  He knew that, within weeks, the magic contained in the wards would interfere with the device’s inner workings and it would be useless, but, if his Mother still needed him, he could always buy another.  Money, he thought, was one of the few things that didn’t trouble him, now that he was the de facto head of household.  In fact, if he wished, he had no need to return to Canada and scrimp to live as a poorly paid hockey instructor.  Putting that thought aside for the moment, he started on the treadmill and began to run.  Fifteen minutes later, he considered himself sufficiently warmed up, and he began a series of deadlifts.  The familiar exercises were soothing, and Draco soon lost himself in the mindless repetition.  Lift, hold, release, repeat.
“No, Cass, if there are subjects that interest you, we’ll certainly find you a teacher.” Papa’s face was serious.  “Darling, I know that a lot of things have changed for you, in a very short time, and you haven’t asked for any of them.  I’m very lucky to get to spend time with you, to get to know you, but I want you to have all of the same opportunities you would have had if you were still in Canada.  I want to give you everything, Cass.  If there’s anything you want, or need, you only have to ask.”
Someone was groaning.  Groaning and swallowing repeatedly.  Draco had been the sober one at enough parties to recognize the guttural swallowing noise for what it was: a harbinger of vast amounts of vomit.  “Accio bucket,” he cried in alarm.  The bucket arrived, mostly in time to catch the copious amounts of sick that poured from Harry.  Draco frantically vanished it, grateful that at least he was back in the Wizarding world, and he didn’t have to clean it from the carpet by hand like he did in Toronto.  There was a plastic cup left on the table, and so he quickly scourgified it, spelling it full of water, and holding Harry’s head up to drink.  “Here, drink a little, Harry, you’ll feel better”.  Harry obediently drank a few swallows, but turned his head away before Draco could get much into him.  He summoned another flannel, and cast another quick augumenti, washing Harry’s face, and smoothing the sweaty hair back from Harry’s forehead.  “You’re okay, Harry, I’ve got you.”
that I won’t be able to see him anymore.  It makes me furious that I’m bothered by it, but I want to cry like a child deprived of a longed-for treat.
“Oh, come on, Draco, it’s obvious that’s how you see me.  You’ve seen me that way since we met on the train on the way to Hogwarts.  Too uncultured to pick the right friends, too stupid to do anything other than succeed accidentally.  All brawn, no brain, right?  It’s stupid, but it’s one of the reasons I like you.”
As Juniper discussed break-room cleanliness, for the fourth week running, Harry stifled a snicker as Linden swiped distractedly at his ear.  Tamsin glared warningly at Harry, who bit his lip and looked away.  The meeting droned on, and Tamsin continued to plague Linden mercilessly.  Just as Linden caught a glimpse of the quill out of the corner of his eye, Harry quickly banished it with a wave of his hand, leaving Linden none the wiser.
The Hogwarts Express had already arrived by the time that they walked through the pillar.  Children were piling from the doors, and there was a noisy, excited buzz as families everywhere reconnected.  Draco was glad for his height, as it allowed him to peer over the crowds and keep an eye out.  “Do you see them?”  The voice next to him was brimming with excitement.
“And some of us were more than one house,” Luna said with a raise of her eyebrow.  Draco tilted his head curiously at her.  “Harry was supposed to be a snake,” she elaborated.
And, just like three days earlier, the sound of footsteps on the stairs forced his head up, and he looked at Hermione and Harry as they entered the lab.  Harry was taller, still quite thin, and was being reluctantly prodded along by Hermione.  “Hullo, Mr. Malfoy,” he said quietly.
“That’s deplorable, darling, but it does make you look even more rakish than usual.  I’m ashamed to say that I approve.”
“The extraction isn’t exactly comfortable, but we’ll use a sleeping draught to make sure that we offset any discomfort Cass might encounter.  She will feel a little bit of tenderness around the extraction site after she awakens for as long as a week afterwards, but again, we’ll manage that using potions.  Within a few weeks, her body will have regenerated the bone marrow.”
We’re British, so we don’t say anything until the tea is made.  She toys with the teaspoon, unable to meet my eyes.  I resolve to be brave.  “Hermione-”
“What were you mad about?”  I barely notice, but he’s helping me up from the stool, throwing a pile of gleaming coins onto the bartop, and nodding at Hannah.
“Next time,” Draco promised, even as a sick feeling in his stomach reminded him that there likely wouldn’t be a next time.
“Just tired, I think.  Speaking of, you should be resting, not traipsing around the house.  Would you rather be in your room, or the living room?”
“Okay.”  Draco resumed his vigil, remembering another night of whispering to one another in the dark.  Dawn broke, finally, and Draco stretched.  He hadn’t slept; simply sat on the uncomfortable floor, kept company by his memories, and the quelling realization that something had gone terribly, desperately wrong.
It hadn’t.  Draco was everything Harry had ever wanted, so long as they were in the privacy of their home.  Because Grimmauld Place
Madame looked closely at Cass, waved her wand a few times, and summoned a tray from one of the shelves behind her.  “Could you please touch each of the materials in this tray, and tell me if any of them feel differently?”
“No, it’s stupid.  I mean, you’ve had bad shit happen to you too, I’m just being stupid.  I just…I really wish I could be normal.”
the people we loved.”  She’s looking at him, and he nods, still watching the people on the street below, walking along as if today were normal, and completely unaware that the world sometimes ends in tiny increments, soul by soul, body by body.
She continues, “The outbursts weren’t improving.  The Psychologist put you on a regimen of meditation and therapy.  The Ministry was getting panicky.  They needed you to be this vision of the future, to publicly be the calm, strong hero that people could trust, and privately, be able to point you at whatever they wanted destroyed.  They started to pressure me for results more quickly.”
It was a work of moments for Harry to confirm the Reversal and Obliviation Squads.  They’d sort the rest of the partygoers out.  Once they were seated around the table, Harry stifled a little grin.  This was his absolute favourite part of his job.  “I told you that my name was Harry, and that’s true, but I did mislead you a little when I arrived.  I’m not actually a Police Officer.  I’m an Integration Specialist, and I work for my Government, in the Department of Magical Accidents.”
“How am I supposed to concoct a cover story for him when I’m carrying around a little munchkin with black hair and green eyes?”
The conversation moves on to Pureblood funeral rituals, and so Harry, the attention diverted from him, has a chance to exchange a look with Ron.  Ron’s face is deceptively mild-looking, but his eyes have always been his tell.
Draco laughs, and the moment passes.  They sit companionably for a while, neither speaking, and Draco tells him about how his mum used to come and prune the roses, while Draco kept her company.
Hermione disappeared up the stairs, and Draco sunk to his knees on the stone floor.  He breathed, in sets of three.  Cleaned every single item that Hermione had touched.  And remade three separate batches of the reversal potion, his brain presenting images of everyone who would suffer if he got it wrong.  When he’d finished, and had scoured the lab once more, for good measure, it was five in the morning.  His body ached, his eyes were sore, and his brain had given up any sort of rational thought a few hours ago.  He staggered up the stairs, checked the wards three times, stumbled to the couch.  And then, when his body was so exhausted he couldn’t imagine ever getting up again, he thought about the kitchen.  And how Kreacher, in his madness, might not have cleaned all the surfaces properly.  Or how Ron might not have washed his hands thoroughly enough after changing one of the babies.  As he heaved himself to his feet and gathered his cleaning supplies, he allowed himself the indulgence of weeping into one of the clean polishing cloths.
So great was his shame, Harry found himself unable to leave the lovely bedroom.  He sat on the edge of the bed, trying not to mess it up, and wallowed in his misery.  A knock at the door interrupted his self-flagellation.  “Dad?”
“However,” McGonagall continues, “there is no one I can think of who deserves privacy and peace more than you.  Not only are you a member of my staff, but also, you’re my friend, and someone who I have always felt just a little more protective of than most of my students, although I’d deny that if you breathe a word of it.  I will speak to the Guardians, and allow them to enforce the official policy.”
After promising to redecorate his bedroom, Harry is allowed to go home.  He has no desire to change anything about his room, but is more frightened of Hermione’s unbridled purposefulness, so he hires a decorator and moves into Sirius’ room while she works.  It takes two days, and the resulting room is…fine.  He moves back into his room, spends most of his days in the Library, reading books on wandlore.
Draco purses his lips.  If there’s anything he likes more than sweets, it’s surprises.  “How’s Dennis?”  His voice is a little too loud.
“It’s just that…he was always the other side of the coin.  He fascinated me, how he could be so effortlessly good.  How he was able to put aside what he wanted for the good of all.  And he…”
The scroll was actually two pieces of parchment.  One contained a huge amount of writing, and unsurprisingly, it was from Hermione:
“Kind of,” Draco admitted.  “I don’t think that there’s much to say.  He’s better now, I’m sure.  I see Hermione every so often, and sometimes he comes up in conversation.  I don’t really think about him at all.”  This, of course, was a blatant lie.  Draco thought about him often, at odd times.  Harry’s bedroom in Draco's flat had been turned into an office, but sometimes Draco lingered outside, and remembered the way his head had smelled as a baby, warm, and a little sweet, as though he were a biscuit, and not a little boy at all.  Sometimes, in the Muggle world on his ‘field trips’, he wondered if Harry had eaten popcorn at a cinema.  Once, he saw a delightfully ill-tempered swan, who haughtily swooped around beside a pond, and it reminded him so much of Professor Snape that he’d longed to be able to bring Harry and show him.
“I like hugs,” Cass said, her shy little grin looking so much like a young Harry’s had, that Hermione nearly sobbed again as she held the little girl tightly.  As introductions were made, and hugs were given, Hermione watched Harry, looking between his daughter and his family as though all of his Christmases and birthdays had come at once.
“Harry, will you look at me?”  His voice sounds different, younger.  I look up, and I’m struck by his expression.  His grey eyes are wide, and there’s a little crease in his forehead.  His lower lip is caught beneath his teeth, and I’m left with the impression of a child, trying desperately to master a new skill.  I don’t know what he sees in my own face, but his expression is complicated, unknown.  The silence stretches and he finally blurts out, “I have a son.”
“No dying allowed on your birthday,” he replied cheerfully.  Cass gave him a saucy little glare, and took off into the sky like a shot.  Draco watched as she soared high, and his breath caught in his throat as she dipped back down and executed a flawless Wronski Feint.  “She’s brilliant,” he breathed.
“You’re joking.”  Draco felt suddenly cold.  He noted, with a detached sort of alarm, that Cass and Lucius had stood and were walking away.
“Anyway,” I say, not all that interested in deconstructing my life with anyone, even people I’m pretty sure I love, “if I get my memory back, and realize I’ve made a huge mistake, Ginny and I can talk.  If she’s been unhappy, then clearly there was some stuff we needed to work through.”
“’S’fine,” Draco said, still scrubbing, wearily resigned to having people befouling his house until he could fix this.
“I didn’t realize,” Draco said.  “I knew about everything he’s been through, but I didn’t understand how it impacted him.”
Cass nodded.  “Yes, Dad is kind of into brooms.  He got us both the same ones that the Canadian National team uses.  They’re wicked fast.”
“No, it does,” Hermione says, and her head is tilted at me in obvious appraisal, “but you were never willing to try before.”
“Oh Harry.  Oh no.  Oh no no…” Draco was babbling now, his panic rising.  “Please tell me that this is your revenge, that you’re saying this to fuck with me.  I know I deserve it but please Harry, please tell me that you’ve been happy this whole time.  Because if this wasn’t worth it, why did I-”
“I always thought that you were a product of your past.  Your shit childhood, and Dumbledore’s manipulation.  I thought they’d raised you to be self-sacrificing.  You’re different now, but not completely different.  It seems like some things are just how you are.”
“You have no right!” Harry shouted, and then, realizing that the kids might be home, carefully lowered his voice.  “No right, Hermione, to assume things, and draw your own conclusions.  You have no idea what you’re talking about.”
“I don’t think that’s true.”  Harry knew that he should just accept the platitude as the olive branch it was, but it felt disloyal to Scorpius, to Cass, to regret anything that produced them.  “You don’t regret Scorpius, I know you don’t, and you shouldn’t.  I can see how much you treasure him, and with good reason.  You didn't do anything wrong by leaving me.  Of course I was hurt, but that's a risk in any relationship.  In some ways, I don’t regret taking Cass to Canada.  That quickly after the war, the press would have eaten us alive, and she would have been the fallout, but I was wrong not to tell you.”
Pansy looked like she wanted to say something, but she stood and smoothed down her dress.  “Yes, we’re done.  I’ll send over contracts for you to sign tonight.”
“Harry never hated you,” Hermione said.  “Even in school.  You made him furious, no question about that, but even when he was stalking you, convinced you were up to no good, you fascinated him.”
Harry felt his cheeks heat.  “Nah, just happy to help.”  He quickly made his excuses and headed home.  Once he arrived, after checking in with Kreacher (the battle with Mrs. Number 10 continued apace), he sat in front of the fire.  Having grown up a very lonely little boy, Harry had gotten accustomed to answering the voices in his head.  Today, his conscience sounded a lot like Hermione.
“It’s noble that you want to help Harry.  I’m so proud that your first instinct is to help him.  But as your therapist, it’s my job to ensure that you’re choosing what’s best for you.”
At midday, Ron and Hermione appeared, Ron disappearing upstairs to play with Harry, while Hermione pored over his notes.  “Draco, this is excellent,” she said, after she’d made her way through the parchments.  “I truly think you’re on to something.  It’s the Valerian from the blood thickener, the Monkshood and the Sage from the inflammation potion, and the Ashwinder eggs from the love potion.”
“Yeah,” Harry said, his smile widening.  “I’ll do you one better though.  Want to see your daughter fly?”
They had a quick fly, and Harry was pleased to see that Teddy was taking well to his broom.  He knew that Tonks had been comfortable flying, but he’d never actually seen Remus on a broom.  Teddy was quite bookish, and Harry wanted to make sure that he was well-rounded.
“You’re welcome, little witch,” he answered, patting her on the shoulder.  In the back yard, the Magical Reversal squad had reverted the lizard into a little girl, and the Obliviators were just sending the last family on their way.
So I'm sorry.  Truly.  I swear though, if you've stuck with me this long, I really hope that you'll stick with me to the end, because this is a shitty place to abandon the story, and your trust will hopefully fully pay off.  But yeah.
Cici entered the room, followed by a severe looking Healer wearing the purple robes of the paediatric wing.  “Good morning, Malfoys and Potters!” Cici cried.  “Today’s the big day.  I’d like you to meet Healer Mancini, who will be leading the procedure.  All ready, Scorpius?”
Draco resolutely did not think about what would happen when Scorpius’ bone marrow transplant had been completed, and Harry and Cass returned to Canada.  Ignoring the hollow feeling in his stomach, Draco followed his family and resolved to make today count.
, but the sound of a door opening jarred him from his mind’s efforts to self-destruct, and he took Scorpius’ hand and looked up.
Harry stilled.  When Cass was little, and wasn’t able to talk about the things that were bothering her, he’d started to ask her to score her feelings out of ten.  One meant that she was contented and coping well, ten meant that she needed cuddles and ice cream, and for Harry to protect her from the world.  She’d never asked him the question in return.  “I’m fine, Cass, truly.”
He summoned a vial of the inoculation, and a sanitizing wipe before donning a set of Muggle rubber gloves and approaching the chair.  Auror Pritchard was sitting comfortably, looking around his lab with interest.  “Mister Malfoy, you have an incredible setup here.”  She was an older witch, around fifty-five, Draco guessed, and she’d been one of Draco’s biggest combatants when he’d first started consulting to the Aurors.  She was Muggleborn, Draco knew, and had lost a family member during the war.  Old wounds remained deep in the years following, and she’d been vocal in her disapproval of an ex-Death Eater interacting with the Aurors.  Still, Draco had been one of only four Potions Master in Europe, and the remaining Death Eaters that were still at large after the war had access to Snape’s formulas.  They’d needed a great deal of help in counteracting the potions during their many attempts to round up all the remaining baddies, and, after Draco had been able to cure the effects of a bone-liquifying potion that had been threatening her partner, she’d quickly changed her tune.  Since then, she’d been collegial, but Draco remembered everything she’d said before.
The silence stretched out between them, until Kreacher muttered something that Harry could barely hear, but he made out the words ‘Number Ten’.
“Yeah.” Harry’s voice was breathy, and his tongue darted out to moisten dry lips.  Maybe Draco wasn’t the other one remembering.  Draco blushed, let his hair fall into his eyes and concentrated on tying his lace.  “It’s tight.”  Merlin, was Harry trying to wind him up?
“Yes.  You should.  But at eighteen, when the very bedrock of my understanding of the world had been chipped away, family was the one familiar thing I had left.  And so, each week, when my Father begged me to marry well, to produce an Heir, to continue the lineage, I agreed, because it was inconceivable to do otherwise.  And I would come home to Harry after each visit, and he felt just as unattainable as he had when we were enemies.”
“Yeah,” Harry laughed.  “She must be as crap at potions as me.  It didn’t work.”  He beamed at Draco.
It was nearing dawn, the light turning a murky grey, when Cass’ eyes fluttered.  Draco sat up instantly.  She must have moved a little, because Harry also sat up, immediately alert.  “Cass?”  Harry’s voice was so hopeful, as though he’d willingly give his life to have his daughter awaken.
“So where does that leave us now?”  Harry’s voice was brittle.  Draco cringed at the lack of warmth.
Draco soon disappeared into his lab, and, aside from the occasional ominous thump from the floor above, was able to lose himself in his work.  It was nearly ten o’clock when Draco realized that he hadn’t done any of his morning rituals.  Something for the journal, he resolved, and dove back into his research, only stopping for a few minutes when a cup of tea and a freshly baked scone appeared on his desk.
“Yes, of course it’s your bed,” Draco had said, still utterly confused, but Harry had simply turned over with a happy sigh and fallen asleep.  The following night, Harry had given a dubious look at the closet before toddling over and climbing into bed.
Luna smiles as they both watch Harry awkwardly dance Scorpius around.  He’s still the least coordinated dancer Draco’s ever seen, but he’s unselfconscious and laughing, and Scorpius is shrieking with glee.  “I don’t regret it,” she says, but Draco knows she does, a little.  It was good for Harry to realize that his life could be so much fuller, but it came at the cost of his trust for Luna, and Draco doesn’t think that they’ll ever get it back.
“Could I see your bedroom?” Harry asked guilelessly.  Draco started a little, wishing with everything in him that an adult Harry was asking the questions for very different reasons, but, since that were about as likely as Draco deciding to breed Hippogriffs, he merely nodded, and gave his mother a bow, before leading Harry from the room.
“That’s fine.”  Harry struggled to keep his voice free of any inflection.  He didn’t want Draco to infer anything, and get angry with him all over again.
It was a lot.  Group therapy, individual therapy, occupational therapy.  For the first two weeks, he’d be monitored constantly, and be allowed no visitors, no contact with anyone.  Then, he’d be assessed, and they would discuss what would happen next.  He was under involuntary admission, which meant that he couldn’t leave, even if he wanted to.  He wouldn’t be allowed to use magic at first. At least that explained the strange band he'd noticed around his ankle when showering.
“Yes. The therapy that has been treating him to this point is no longer effective.  There is another treatment that we’re exploring, but it won’t cure him.”
Draco gasped in a breath, and then another.  He felt a cool trickle of sweat run down his spine.  His hands were trembling.  “No,” he managed to say croakily, “’s’not that.  I just had another…It’s nothing you did, Harry.  We’re safe.  You’re fine.”
“No, what’s actually going to happen is that I’m going to take you to a very, very special place.  It belongs to a friend of mine, and she’s going to take wonderful care of you until we sort things out with your parents.”
“Nuh-uh,” George said, his grin widening.  “I’m going back to the store.  I’d suggest that you get in touch with Bill.  He can arrange a solicitor for Gin through the bank.”
Ron was busily casting spells on Ginny, and he sent a Patronus to the Aurors, who appeared quickly.  Draco idly wondered whether it was Harry’s name that had prompted their fast response, or if Ron himself warranted such service.
“Fine, mostly,” I say.  “Draco’s a bit upset, obviously, but I’m just looking forward to when the dust settles some and I can go back to work.”  I’m still annoyed that I’d barely started my new job when things got so crazy and I wasn’t able to show up, but Florean’s been gracious, and I was able to sort things out by owl with the solicitor and the bank, so they can afford to hire help.
“I’m sorry, Draco, so sorry.  You didn’t deserve this.”  He felt completely raw, exposed.  He'd never admitted this to anyone.  He had spent his entire school career encouraging people to see him as a bit dull, a bit unaware of the nuances of how people saw him.  It allowed him to accept the love and care of his friends, while he pretended not to see the toll it took on them.  But he'd always known.  During the Tri-Wizard Tournament, when the Prophet had lambasted Hermione over their inferred relationship, Harry had seen how everyone, even Mrs. Weasley, had judged her.  But Harry was weak, and unable to choose the right path, sometimes.  He prioritized his own selfish need for companionship and love over the safety of others.  He'd been terrified of the toll it would have taken on Cass, and so he'd run away.  He stood, desperate to reach the relative safety of his borrowed room.
A tired looking resident looked up at his arrival.  “Room four,” he said.  Harry nodded gratefully, and carried Scorpius into the healing room, gently depositing him on the bed.  The resident followed him, and Harry quickly explained the situation.
“That’s correct.  It’s not often that I have the privilege of meeting someone who is so rational, able to see that a peaceful, comfortable death is something valuable when all other options have been exercised.  Your Mother is incredibly proud of you, and I can see why.”
Hermione groaned.  “I’m the worst sort of coward.  I can’t find any proof, and I haven’t managed to tell Ron yet.”
His nighttime wanderings increase, while his bouts of restless sleep decrease.  Even the ghosts start to comment on his pallor, his inability to stay still.  Finally, one night, when he thinks his mind might break from the strain, he stands on the Astronomy Tower, watching the owls swoop in and out of the owlery.  “This is a cheerful place,” a voice behind him says.  He turns around, startled, to see Draco standing at the top of the stairs.
Relieved, that is, until we arrive back at theirs, and Ron turns on me the second Rose is encouraged to go play in her room.  “What happened?” He demands.
“Yeah.  As you might recall, I got rather a lot of attention as I was growing up, and I fear my return to England is going to prompt the same treatment again.  Normally, I wouldn’t give a fig about what the press says, but I’m not here alone, and I’m very protective of my travelling companion.”
“My judgement is flawed, Lara.  I made terrible choices.  I listened to my Father without question.  I don’t trust myself to gauge whether I’m different.  Because I was so wrong the last time.  Don’t you see?”
Then the package from Dad arrived.  It was delivered by four owls, international ones, all of them looking exhausted and cross.  She unpacked it to find a laptop, and Uncle Professor’s portrait.  The attached letter, which she read three times in a row, said that her Dad wanted to be able to email her, rather than wait for owl post.  The laptop had been charmed to work around magic, and she’d been asking for one for a while, but Dad had always refused, saying that the last thing he needed was more opportunities for Cass to stay locked in her room reading.  He’d sent her Uncle Professor to ensure that she didn’t get lonely.
Harry felt tears prickling.  “Thanks, Draco.  I think I’ll go to bed.”  He set his glass on the table next to his armchair and escaped to his room, where his thoughts continued to run in cross purposes.  Could Draco truly mean it?  Would they be able to make things work?  He lay awake most of the night, confused, desperately wanting to believe what Draco was saying.
I squeeze in a nap before Mill is set to arrive, and I’m just struggling back into my denims when I hear the floo.  Kreacher, who spent nearly an hour earlier trying to convince me to move back to ‘Master’s proper home’, greets her, and I hear a bright little voice demand, “Where is he?  I want to see the scar.”
Draco held the parchment so tightly that it crumpled.  To have been so close to his most treasured desire, and then let his instincts chase it away…he wanted to howl, to beat his fists against the wall, to climb into his bed and never emerge.  He did none of those, however, and merely sat down unsteadily at the table, and breathed, and examined his hands.
Rose chuckled, and launched herself into Draco’s arms, where he jounced her slightly, evoking deep belly laughs from the toddler.  “Draco,” Hermione said, “you…you’re looking wonderful.  You’re doing so well!”
“Draco!”  Hermione’s voice was distinctive, loud above the noise that filled the platform.  “Harry!”
Later that afternoon, the floo chimed and a familiar face appeared.  “News travels quickly, I see,” Draco said dryly.
“Oh Salazar.  What on earth?”  Narcissa set off across the lawns, no doubt to rescue the peacocks, whose ancestors had gone nearly feral during the Dark Lord’s stay at the Manor.  Draco wondered if these ones had any better manners.  He knew that he should get up, help sort things out, but his Mother’s question lingered in his mind.  What
Her face is stunned.  “Well, of course I can, Mister Potter.”  She looks at me strangely.  “This seems a bit out of character, if I might say.  The last time you were here, Miss Granger had to drag you, and you refused to try anything on.  Then you got into a terrible argument and stormed away.”
“Yes, as I understand it, he will, but the treatment is, by nature, experimental, and there’s no guarantee.  Hermione learned, as she researched Draco’s application, that the best chance that Scorpius has for survival is by receiving a bone marrow donation.”  She waited for Harry to say something, but the rising terror that was currently flooding his adrenal system prevented him from speaking.  “Harry, if Scorpius receives a donation from a sibling donor, his chances of survival are quite excellent.”
“Yes.  Harry Potter, someone who had so little self-worth that he willingly marched to his death.  I’m not saying that he didn’t perform a remarkable feat in facing the Dark Lord.  Many people would call it brave.  I’ve read the biographies, and I’ve listened to the testimonies.  I can’t diagnose him from a distance like this, but at first glance, I would suggest that Albus Dumbledore taught that boy that he didn’t matter nearly enough to deserve to live.  I would suggest that his actions would have been far more of a sacrifice if he’d actually valued his own life in the first place.  And, ill-advised as it is to allow someone else the ability to define your self-worth, I would say that Harry Potter’s judgement is as flawed as your own.  He’s the reverse of you, Draco, in that you’re correct, but while you valued yourself too much, I think he valued himself too little.”
Harry had the next couple of days off, so he spent the time lounging on his couch in his pants, eating biscuits, and arguing with Kreacher about cleaning the kitchen.  He bought a new coffeemaker, and begged his semi-sentient kitchen to accept this one.  He visited Teddy and took him for a fly, and then topped it all off with another visit to the Granger-Weasleys.
“I miss my Daddy,” she sobbed, and found herself a little surprised that this wasn’t an act after all.  “I don’t know why he’d leave me, and I think he’s hurting, and nobody cares.”  She felt a little alarmed that the words were true, and her worry turned into fear.
when he isn’t.  He’s alive, but he isn’t okay.  I feel so helpless.  I feel like he’s battling for his life, and we’re not with him.  We’re always with him.”
George said, “Dad reinforced it with all the same charms on the house.  Said he wouldn’t have it falling down around our ears while we were playing.  Freddie and I used to camp out there some nights.”  He sounded wistful, and Ron touched his arm lightly.
Draco indulges in a lonely weeping fit, and then goes to Hermione.  He knows how worried everyone is about Harry, and he can’t keep this proof of life to himself.  She takes one look at the parchment and bursts into tears.  After calming down, and mopping her face with Draco’s handkerchief, she sighs.  “Harry is always ‘fine’, even when he isn’t.
Then, he went through the house and completed his nighttime routine, warding each window and door, checking each burner in his lab to ensure that they were off, warding the fireproof cabinet where his potions research was kept.  He checked the floo wards, and then rechecked each window and door, passing the floos and triple-checking them one last time before turning off the gas lamps in order.
“Harry has been under enormous strain, Draconus.  It is to be expected that he might be prone to certain…discrete dalliances, but surely you don’t expect that he would seriously pursue something with you?  A former Death Eater?  A Malfoy? I don’t have to tell you that your family’s reputation makes a relationship with Harry…unsuitable.”
She laughs.  “Mister Potter, I think you’ve heard the broad strokes of my life’s story.  I can’t imagine that anyone would see me as an authority on the best course of action.”
He obeyed the voice in his head without question.  It had rarely steered him wrong in the past.  Once he had his things together, he detachedly wondered what should happen next.
“I’m concerned about Scorpius,” he said bluntly, after describing the way that Scorpius hexed a classmate.  “Accidental magic isn’t uncommon, but it’s usually productive.  A child is told no more sweets, so he summons the cookies.  A child feels scared so he casts a notice-me-not on himself, in order to hide.  When a child’s magic lashes out to hurt someone else, it’s worrisome.”
“Malfoy, please.  I know that you and I aren’t friends, and I know that you hate Harry, but he doesn’t deserve this.  It’s going to ruin him if this hits the press.  He…he’s tried so hard, since Voldemort and everything, to be okay.  He deserves a shot.  If you can make him grow up again, I’ll make sure he gets clean, I promise.”  Weasley cast a worried look at the baby, who was still sitting on the floor, placidly examining his hands.  “You got a shot, afterwards, right?  Harry helped you get a chance to change things.”  Draco opened his mouth to say something, but Weasley continued, “Don’t get me wrong, Malfoy, you deserved a shot, and you’ve done really well for yourself.  You proved everybody wrong.  It’s just that, Harry deserves a shot too.  Please?”
“No, Harry.  Harry.  Gods, you…Do you know what I see when I look at you?  I see someone who has been forced into one traumatic situation after another, who still manages to laugh and see the good in people.  I see someone who has had nearly everyone he’s loved taken from him, but who loves those he still has with an open heart.  I see someone who I’ve been fascinated with for my whole life, but who never stops surprising me.”
Harry appeared as though he was going to talk himself right out of a relationship at all, and Draco blurted out, “No!”  Harry jumped a little, startled.  Perhaps that had been a little louder than Draco intended.  “No,” he said, more quietly.  “I am.  Interested.  I’m very interested.  I…”.  He trailed off, gathering his courage to continue.  “I never got over you, Harry.  You’re like a part of my DNA by now.  I’m interested, and I want to make it work for us both.”
Harry got a look on his face that Draco recognized from long ago at Hogwarts.  “Why would I need to be a secret?”
After that, everything was simple, if not easy.  He sat through the reading of the will.  Unsurprisingly, he was wealthy.  He asked the lawyer to put the Manor up for sale.  He packed some photographs, arranged to have some artifacts stored in the vaults at Gringotts, and took a final walk through the manor.  The elves wailed when he tried to free them, so he sent them to Pansy.  Let her figure out what to do with them.  Granger could find them somewhere; Draco knew she had a thing about elves back at Hogwarts.
Harry seemed to have become more aware of the conversation.  “Oh no,” he said.  “Molly’s going to hate me.”
He laughs.  Hermione is standing slightly behind him.  “Harry, where did we brew the Polyjuice Potion, second year?”
“I dunno, Ron, do you suppose you are?”  My voice is snappish, and I regret it immediately.  “I apologize, that was rude.  But, I’m just…not.  I’m not bi, and I’m not heterosexual.  I could no more easily imagine sleeping with a woman than you could imagine sleeping with a man.”
“Oh, of course you’re not,” Hermione says, and there’s that tone again.  It’s patient, but not a little condescending.  “But Harry, there’s so much you don’t know, and until you do, we want you to be safe.”
His mind idly recalled the loving faces around Harry’s kitchen island.  The boy who’d had nobody, no parents, no proper upbringing, had built a strong family who loved and supported him.  If Harry were sitting by a deathbed, he’d have people there to with him, to make him eat and sleep and shower.  Draco may not have done things right, but at least Harry had people.  Draco had three mad house elves who he’d need to free once this was over.
Draco pulls back, and his eyes are wild, as though he’s leapt from the Astronomy Tower without a broom.  Harry feels like he doesn’t even have a body anymore while at the same time being simultaneously aware of every synapse firing, every molecule of blood pumping through his veins.  Draco’s eyes, impossibly, widen further, and he staggers back.  “I…I didn’t-,” he stammers, but his long fingers press against his own lips as though he were trying to hold the feeling of their kiss within them.
“That’s amazing to hear.  I think it’s important for kids, especially girls, to be confident in their own autonomy.”
“Can’t you get her a solicitor that’s already in England?  If your mate can’t seem to get home to help her?”
It’s only after Draco leaves, with muttered excuses about robe fittings and cake tastings does Harry’s mask fall.  He collapses to the floor in the hallway after seeing Draco to the door and sobs until his eyes are swollen shut.  He lays prone there, the tile soothing his hot forehead, his tears pooling, until Kreacher finally comes.  “Master Harry is to be going to bed.” Despite Harry’s weak protests, Kreacher prods him up the stairs, runs a bath for him, bullies him into pyjamas and sends him to bed.  Harry lies there, unable to sleep…he’d just gotten up a few hours ago, after all.  An owl from Hermione comes, but he shoos it away.  When it returns an hour or so later, he screams at it, and waves his hands until it flies out the window with a disgruntled hoot.
“You don’t!  You never talk about him, and there’s something going on, and you won’t tell me.  You don’t even care that I’m worried and lonely!”
Harry escaped gratefully to the door, but before closing it, he popped his head back in.  “Draco?  I didn’t say, but…thank you.  For everything, really.”
him.  An intriguing little blush colours his cheeks and my smile widens.  “Come on, Draco,” I say, “I’d owe you a favour.”
He chuckles.  “You’re not pathetic, exactly.  Just…floppy, and sort of sweet.”  He takes my arm.  “I’m going to side-along you, okay?”
A few days later, the floo chimed, and Draco was surprised to see the freckled face of Ron Weasley in the flames.  “Hey Malfoy, can I come through?”
“Darling.  The rumours are true!” Pansy said delightedly, and stepped through the grate, looking as lovely as a spring day.  Her brown eyes were gleaming, and the green robes she wore were immaculately tailored.  As she crossed the floor to embrace him and kiss his cheeks, Draco remembered a million other such times, Pansy crossing a room to greet him, face alight with the latest gossip.
Bringing his hand to his mouth, Harry slowly licked Draco’s come from each of his fingers.  “Do you have any idea how fucking sexy you look, doing that?” Draco growled.  Harry smiled a kittenish little smirk, popping his index finger into his mouth, his eyes closing halfway as he savoured Draco’s essence.
“Well, I hope he gets approved for the trial,” Harry said, wondering why this information merited an international portkey.
“Shut it,” Draco said sulkily, following her downstairs.  Of course he could see Cass’ point. He knew that he was being childish about the situation, too busy being angry at Harry and feeling sorry for himself to take advantage of time with his daughter while she was here.  And he knew that Harry was a good Father.  The evidence of it was obvious.
“Harry, may I ask you something?”  Narcissa kept her voice low, so as not to be overheard by the two blonde heads across the room.
They fight then.  Draco calls him a doormat, asks him how Draco can mean so little to him.  Harry calls him a git and tells him that he’s trying to make it easier for him.  Harry ends up standing in front of him, breathing heavy, eyes flashing.  “I love you, you stupid prat.  Don’t you dare tell me that you don’t mean anything to me.  I love you enough to let you go, you arsehole!”  Draco launches himself at Harry and their kisses are frantic, desperate, a clash of teeth and tongues and Harry’s glasses are crushed against Draco’s face, but he’s desperate to taste and suck and touch every inch of Harry.
“My name is Violet, which I think is kind of stupid.  I’m seven years old, and Mommy says you’re too nice for your own good.”
“Well, I’ll let you know if I ever decide to go slumming it, Potter.”  Draco tries to inject the same cutting disdain that he once wielded so successfully, but he’s out of practice, and so it just sounds like a challenge.
“I’m afraid so,” Draco said.  They shared an uneasy look, and the awkward silence extended a bit, before Draco said, “If you feel like you’d like to, I don’t know, talk, or get drunk or something…I know your best mate isn’t really available for that right now.”
His frantic spell casting seemed to help though, because Harry gasped a breath.  His eyes were still blurry and unfocused, though, and his body remained rigid.  Draco’s panic reached a frenzied peak, however when, with a tiny tremble, his body started to change.  It started at his feet, the tiny socked toes lengthening and thickening, and the change extended to his ankles, and up his legs.  Beneath his t-shirt, Draco could see his ribs expand, and then his shoulders, and ankles, before his face altered in front of Draco’s eyes.  Later, Draco would be unable to articulate exactly what changed, but as he watched, the baby-soft innocence disappeared.  He was still innocent-looking, but his eyes, in particular, obtained a more adult quality.  It was
Harry’s expression faltered.  He looked uncertainly at Draco, who resolved to give him absolutely nothing in return.  “Well, yeah.  There’s been someone that I’ve been fascinated with for most of my life, it seems.  I’ve never told him how I felt, though.”
“This might present a conflict of interest for you then.  I don’t want to put you in an awkward position, but my life is a bit more entwined with Draco’s than you know.”
“I’m here, sweetheart,” Draco said.  “It’s okay.  You’re okay.”  Scorpius raised his arms imploringly, his eyes still a little unfocused.  “Can I hold him?”
“It is dumb,” Harry agreed.  “And there’s you.  People will do the math, and they’ll wonder how you came about.  Since a male pregnancy, even in Wizards, is nearly unheard of, they’ll be looking for who your Mother is.  They’ll want to know more about you.”
“If you were only interested in dating me because you thought I was still like that, I understand.”  I get up and head to the floo.
“Nothing.  Never mind.  Anyhow, if we don’t regrow him gradually, well, I expect he’d likely die in a flash of white like the rats did.”  Hermione gave a bit of a head-toss, which made Draco remind himself to come back to the Master of Death thing later.
“Well, it’s ludicrous, really.  Imagine if someone took a shy, neglected little kid, and threw him into a world that he had no preparation for, and then told him that it was his birthright to save it?  And then the people who were responsible for taking care of him let him face danger and true evil, year after year, and did the bare minimum to help him.  Then, when the stakes were so high that he couldn’t possibly refuse, they told him that he needed to walk to his death to save the only people who had ever been kind to him.  Even if you don’t remember it, I imagine your built-in sense of obligation is pushing you to act.”
“Everywhere, Draco.  I went to so many places.  I learned so much, and saw beautiful things.  I met interesting people, and I finally understood what life could be like.”
“Does it matter?  Either way, it’s an impossible position for me.  Either I admit that I’m her parent, and the press goes insane about a male pregnancy, and our past relationship, and my family doesn’t get a moment of peace, or I don’t admit it, and Cass thinks I’m ashamed of her.  You’ve set me up, Potter.  I can’t possibly win.”  Harry looked carefully at his eyes.  There wasn’t a trace of the warmth they’d once shown him.  It wasn’t that he’d hoped for anything better.  No, that wasn’t true.  A stupid, innocent part of Harry had hoped that this would have gone better.  He felt a familiar pang of disappointment.  It was just like each birthday, each Christmas, when he’d been growing up.  Hoping that this year, his family might remember him, only to be reminded that he didn’t matter after all.
She sighs.  “I think that you’ve been done a disservice.  You’ve been given the story of your life, in broad strokes, but none of the context.  Tell me what you know of the war.”
“Merlin, I hope not.  Draco, come back to me.  Be with me.  I don’t even care if we stay here, in your poncy Muggle condo.  I just don’t want to waste another fucking second.”
Hermione gives him a glare.  “He’s not as bad as all that.  But he was on the other side, during, you know…”
“Yes.  Especially considering that you’ve taken exactly ten thousand, two hundred and twenty Galleons in withdrawals from the principal vaults since your birth.”
was the one who tried to smash my lab to bits.  Like usual, I’m going to get blamed for something that
“That doesn’t make any sense,” Draco spits.  “Without a conscience, without something driving us to a higher state of behaviour, we’d all be baseless animals.”
“I’m sorry too.  I wasn’t being fair to you.  And I put you in an awkward position when I asked you to help with Pansy.  It was wrong of me.”
Draco had honestly forgotten his little tantrum from earlier, and his face reddened.  “I found it a little difficult to go out,” he said stiffly.
a dragon story.  Her little forehead wrinkles, and she says, “Oh.  Right. Memory.”  I shrug apologetically, but she suddenly smiles.  “I’ll tell it to you,” she says, patting my arm to comfort me.
“Well reasoned,” Andromeda said.  Sentiment around Dark Wizards remained a bit negative, and it really wasn’t that surprising that Draco had fled the Wizarding world.  In the non-Magical world, he was just another man.
“Please George,” Hermione begged, “could we just look at the lab, just to make sure?  Ginny stunned us and took Harry somewhere.”
Harry’s preparing him frantically, his index finger rubbing his prostate in time with his bobbing head.  He scissors Draco’s opening and when Draco can’t take the torture any longer he begs “Please Harry, in me, I’ll die if you don’t.”
I’ve grown accustomed to Luna saying things that I don’t understand, and, although it initially took me some time to accept the futility of trying to gain an explanation, I’ve learned to roll with it.  Draco, however, is sending me panicky eyes, as though the ensuing newspaper article will make us all seem mad.  It might, I allow, but my instinct is telling me to trust Luna, and so I merely smile reassuringly back at Draco, and try to haul Luna back to the point.
“Yes, Dean Thomas, please meet Cass Potter,” Harry said.  He was still nervous, but there was nothing to be done.
“I insist.  Draco, you’ve treated your friends poorly, and you know it.  Even if you can’t regain the past, even if you don’t speak to us ever again, we deserve the right to properly say goodbye to you.”
“I see,” Harry said.  “Given that he has two magical parents, I wondered why he was attending a non-magical school?”
“I’m very sorry, Aunt, about everything that happened to your family during the War.  I’m sorry for my role in it.”
Ron dismantled the wards, just as George came up the stairs.  “Oi, what are you doing?” His voice was indignant.  “You can’t go in there!”  He stopped short when he saw Draco, “Malfoy,” he said evenly, his voice losing a lot of its ire in place of curiosity.
“Weeks, likely.  Your Mother is beginning to weaken.  You can expect that as time passes, she’ll sleep more often, as the pain draughts need to be stronger.  Eventually, she’ll simply slip into a sleep from which she won’t awaken.”
When they flooed in, Draco felt the wash of familiar magic as the house recognized him as Lord of the Manor.  He instinctively strengthened the wards, and cast a spell of his own devising to banish any germs, then cast a quick cleansing spell on Harry and himself.  Harry grinned up at him as the magic tingled on his skin.  Then he looked around in wonder.  “You grew up here?”
