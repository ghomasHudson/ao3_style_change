“Good evening mr. Malfoy.” She said as Draco sat down in the second armchair.
As fast as he could, he turned around, facing the wall, while the chuckle of Potter resonated.
Suddenly, Draco felt tired, so much tired. A lot of things happened in a short amount of time, a lot more that he was used to for the past three months if he was honest, and he was still in his cat mind sometimes, he just wanted to nap.
Slightly, as Magnolia was fixing the door heading to the girl dormitory, Harry moved cautiously toward the cat.
“More that her made up lies will lead the others to the truth.”
Draco turned his head, to show that no, he is not. But Luna understand this gesture as an invitation to pet him. Draco wanted to stop her but he couldn’t come to terms with hurting her, so he just let her do.
“Malfoy, hey, you’re safe, Malfoy.” He whispered softly, kissing the top of Malfoy’s hair.
Harry rose on his hand, the other grabbing Malfoy’ one.
He was still wondering, regretting his choice to leave Luna’s room when Potter picked him up, and started to carry him, pushed the cat formed against his chest, a hand caressing his furry back. Draco tried to think of a plan to escape Potter big ô too big and soft hands, but those terrible hands was relaxing him. As soon as they entered the bathroom, he let Draco down and started to quickly get undressed. Draco could understand that the teenager was in a hurry, but still, he could be a bit more decent !
The first surprise that welcomed the 8th year students was a common dormitory for all of them. Harry didn’t expect them to be a lot, but they were no more than ten, and a big part were Gryffindor. In fact, the only other houses’ students were Luna, Hannah Abbot, and Parkinson and Zabini. Professor McGonagall, well now Headmistress McGonagall, leaded them through the castle, reminding them that even if they had a bit more freedom because of their age, they still couldn’t wander in the corridor during night, and Harry could swear she was specifically looking at him.
“Exactly !” Harry exclaimed, breaking the hug to face Malfoy and looked at him dead in the eyes. “I mean, I don’t know what I’m doing half of the time and I ended dying the last time but I don’t care, I’m here for you and I’ll help you with all those bad nightmares or I’m even here if you need to talk !” Harry started to talk a lot and quickly. “I mean, Hermione used to say “Harry, you’re not a good listener, you never pay attention.” but I changed ! Well, I changed a lot this summer, but I’m sure you noticed at least a part, and..”
“Thank you.” Malfoy said as he stood up as well. “Can you turn around ? It’s the bare minimum privacy.”
“ Do you need some help maybe Malfoy ?” Harry asked jokily, pretending to turn around.
“Really ? But where ?” Pansy insisted.
“This summer.” Potter snickered. “Upset that I’m taller now ? You won’t be able to look down on me now.” He added in a tease.
Potter put a quick kiss on Draco muzzle, before putting him down. Draco rub his nose with both of his paws, his heart racing in his chest. Potter laughed a last time and left Draco alone. The last stayed dumbly there, on the carpet, trying to process what just happened. A part of him wondered if Potter was talking about him, well the human him, and that he unconsciously recognized him under all this white fur. But the other part, the more realistic one, doubted that he was speaking about him, and he really didn’t want to think about every single soul that crossed Potter and was undoubtedly worthier than Draco. But it wasn’t a big deal, right ?
Draco didn’t even realized that it was ready, or that the sheets were green, he just went to the bed, and at the moment his head touch the pillow, he fall asleep.
He took a deep breath, trying not too much too think of the three great men that now were gone, and got his wand as close as possible, whispering “ I solemnly swear that I am up to no good.”
“You’re right, but I never thought you would have like any news from me.” Draco explained.
“Who can resist to the cute face ?” Potter argued back, his smile showing his teeth.
But it didn’t stop the cat, and he meowed even loud.
“Pretty.” Harry whispered, his heart clutching.
“You too.”
gave it to him. However, he didn’t want to risk coming across Potter, so he just ate there, and watched the little creatures bustling and working.
“It’s the first time I have nightmare since it’s the first time I slept in my human form since long.” Malfoy explained before snapping up his head. “ I just should turn into a cat to sleep!”
“Alright.” Harry said in a shrug.
“As if.” Draco answered with a snicker. “You’ll hear it from me, I promise.” He added with a soften voice.
“It was just a surname we gave him, keep calm big brain.” Zabini explained.
Opening his eyes, he found Potter’s face very close to his own, too close. He couldn’t help but notice how relaxed his figures were, how handsome his figures were.
“No way they could accept a Death Eater in the team.” Neville approved. “It’s just rumor.”
“Shut up, Potter.”
“Yes, professor, I can’t really tell you how, but I saw it and… I just want to know why he is like that. Is Malfoy an animagus like you or Sirius ?”
Draco yawned and curled himself up, and trying to think at something else that Potter. But the thing was everything always had a thing to do with Potter. The reason hidden between him being a cat. See, first when the judge had sentenced him a community service, he asked if he could do the Hogwarts restoration. Surprisingly enough, the old man agreed, but only because the team of curses-breakers agreed too, convinced that they were nothing to fear from young Malfoy.
Eyes wide with disbelief Draco looks between the two before questioning, “Really?!”
Hadn't he also meant to say that under his breath? Wow. He had really cocked that up in every way imaginable, hadn't he?
Harry reaches down at his side to blindly rummage through his satchel for more sickles. He scoops up enough to fill his palm, guessing that'll be enough for another, and plants a quick chaste kiss on Draco’s lips before standing, “Alright?”
A companionable silence falls over the pair before Harry breaks it to point out, " You know you never really answered the question of if you want another sundae. I know, I know! You won't fit in your robes but that still isn't an answer…"
Draco decides difficult could be a good thing. A very good, very promising thing. Anything easy to come by wasn't really all that worth having anyway. He reckons he could learn to deal with difficult so long as the results got him what he wanted. Which was as simple as a difficult boy named Harry Potter.
“Oh, burning—don't you dare laugh Potter—oh no...how is it—
The more enlightened, patient part of Draco’s mind knew Potter was probably just as confused  and didn't know how to proceed either. He would have to be the better man (as usual) and pull Potter aside to sort this out.
Finding the books had been made a top priority. Unfortunately for Harry, his star power had followed him into his adult life, and high profile cases were frequently handed over to him. “Good for press and whatnot” he’d been told on several occasions by almost every supervisor he’d ever had. Fortunately for the Ministry, the magical world, and maybe even the muggle world—Harry happened to be more than competent at his job.
—die here like an ani—
Grey eyes snap open and Draco, having got his audience back begins his moaning anew.
“Do you want to keep harping on about feelings or do you want to gossip about how fucking delectable Potter would be as a vampire?” He gives Pansy a pointed look.
An unattractive snort of laughter from Blaise spoils Draco's tirade. "And what do you find so funny Zabini?"
—how is it worse this time?”
With a soft chuckle, Harry throws his arm over narrow shoulders and pulls Draco flush against him pressing a quick kiss to his temple for good measure.
Harry slaps his hand over his mouth to try and stifle the laughter that was bubbling up.
please. Isn’t there anything else?”
“Too true,” Draco replies as he wipes a tear from his cheek.
“And you’re always on me about my manners,” Harry scolds gently his face lighting up with a fond smile.
. An item. A set.
“AHEM. Mr. Malfoy, while I do congratulate you on your new found…  enthusiasm towards your fellow student, I will remind you, just this once, that my classroom is not the time for such proclamations. Do I make myself clear?”
What the trio had failed to notice the whole time they had been chatting was a mousy little third-year, tucked away in a quiet corner, keenly observing them. With the older Slytherins, now safely gone from sight, he reaches into his bag for his quill and some fresh parchment. It had felt like a whole lifetime had gone by since creating his original epic tale and he had thought himself content to have just written the one. Having overheard Draco’s confession had renewed his enchantment with the boy. The vain, egotistical Little Prince of Slytherin would unwittingly, play muse yet again. Inspiration revived, he lifts his quill to the fresh piece of parchment. He was ready to create the sequel to his masterpiece. Perhaps this time around Draco Malfoy and Harry “Vampire” Potter would finally get the happy ending they had always deserved.
She sighs and leans into Draco resting her head on his shoulder. "Love you."
Pansy and Blaise’s mouths both snap shut almost as quickly as they had opened.
to read.
had not only been written but that it had been circulating throughout the school for
“Oh! Let’s invite him to tea!”
Pansy reaches over with her free hand to playfully swat at Draco's chest. "Not my fault there are so many pretty girls attending this fine institution."
“I can't believe—
“Who doesn't enjoy a nice fancy tea?”
“Come back to watch—
Her eyes shine with impish delight and her lips quirk up into a devious grin. “After dick.” The three of them, once more, dissolve into a fit of giggles. After all, what was the point of returning to Hogwarts to complete Eighth Year if you couldn't let loose and indulge in a bit of immaturity every so often?
“...I’d like that,” Draco says softly with a small smile.  “So...evening not ruined?”
—had gotten them—
Draco stands up and makes his way towards the kitchen in such haste he stumbles over his own feet more than once. Harry falls forward, his head resting on the cushions Draco had just vacated, fully succumbing and letting the laughter take over. He clutches at his sides as the sound of Draco fumbling around his kitchen fuels another bout of giggles. Hearing a loud crash and some colorful cursing Harry decides he’s let Draco suffer enough and should probably go help.
“End of last ter—
Reaching his destination he throws the door to the Slytherin common room open with a resounding angry
—are!” Draco shouts, making sure his partner for the evening can hear his despair.
“The spice. The pork...whatever—the spice was still IN YOUR MOUTH!”
well," Harry says as he moves forward his lips but a hair's breadth from Draco's. “In fact, as good as I know you’ll look in your fancy French robes on our wedding day you’re going to look even better once you're out of them.”
No surprise there, so they had known as well. Then that just leaves…
Of course, he's not paying any attention. Chin propped up on his palm, gaze directed towards the small windows lining the far wall of the classroom and the gloomy grey sky beyond. Draco quickly glances up to McGonagall to confirm she’s not paying one bit of attention to Potter not paying one bit of attention. Of all the professors to receive special treatment from, how had he managed McGonagall? She was notoriously stern on even the most mundane of things.
—” Dissolving into a fit of laughter Harry has to resort to pointing.
Blaise! Have some manners! That’s personal! So, are you in love?”
“What are you—” Harry follows Draco’s line of sight to the meal he was packing up. “Oh, no—you think…? Draco you honestly think I’m going to kick you out for not being able to handle your spice?”
“Die a virgin?”
“Didn't
“Oh, Merlin—no! Here it—
“I thought you hadn't read it!”
“So you
“Yes, to ensure you achieve your goals we need to keep you on a very strict regimen. Once, at least, nightly should keep you on track.”
“Maybe…,” Harry says with a sly grin. A suggestive twinkle lights up his green eyes.
That's what Potter does though isn't it? Playing up his savior schtick. The poor golden boy who can't catch a break. Preying on the kindness of those around him to get special treatment. Well Draco, for one, wasn't going to fall for it.
"Okay, okay. No naked wedding. As much as it amuses me I would never put Narcissa through that.”
“That’s the plan. He hasn’t even noticed yet,” Draco lets out a long-suffering sigh, ”Why must I be in love with a thickheaded git?”
“Yes, it’s quite a step up from your usual
“Is there?”
Harry, being quite used to his other half’s penchant for theatrics, simply shrugs while shoveling a sizeable bite of his dessert into his mouth. “Suit yourself.”
“I do."
Pansy simply shrugs, triumphant smile on her face as she reaches down to put her winnings into her bag.
A hand coming to rest atop his knee stirs Draco out from his inner monologue. He looks up to meet bright green eyes and a perceptive gaze. Harry gives his knee a slight squeeze and leans in closer to Draco.
It was surprising how smoothly that last transition of their relationship had happened. If Harry dwelled on it then maybe it wasn't
“I should hope not. Moving on class - now, the proper-” McGonagall immediately picked right back up silencing the class and guiding it forward before anyone could react properly to what had just happened (though he was sure once he was out of the safety of her classroom it was going to be hell). Draco was suddenly grateful for the stern, no-nonsense way about her now. Maybe Potter wasn't the only student she had a soft spot for.
“No worse than all the cliched I’m-going-to-kill-myself teenage angst.”
“Well, I’ll leave that particular chit-chat for you two. I need to head to the owlery.” He packs up his belongings and before he turns to leave he threatens, “And you can evade the love question for now but we’ll wheedle it from you yet.” He shares a wink with Pansy and makes his way towards the entrance to the common room.
Harry almost found it rather cute to see Draco looking so undignified. Almost being the keyword. There were a bit too many bogies at the moment to overlook.
“Crisis averted then! Whew!” Harry’s eyes light up with delight as he swipes his other hand over his forehead in an over-dramatic gesture.
He brings his hands up to cup Harry’s cheeks and closes the space between them. A few sweet closed mouth kisses are shared between them before Harry runs his tongue along Draco’s bottom lip. Draco tilts his head and opens his mouth allowing Harry to take control. Sweet kisses turn back into something a bit more suggestive as tongues meet and hands begin to wander once more. They traded the desperate frenzied passion they had been enjoying for unhurried lingering kisses and slow sensual caresses.
—miss her—”
“Well—yes.”
Though at this point it was impossible to differentiate it being from the tears or the neverending stream of snot his nose was so ungraciously supplying.
Letting his gaze travel ever so slightly over he’s met dead on with intense green eyes. Potter is half-turned in his seat to get a better view of Draco. The bright grey sky illuminates him from behind shrouding his strong features in moody shadows. Still, those eyes, those damn green eyes, were as bright as ever. No amount of shadow could ever seem to dim Potter. Those eyes were burning with that same fiery, unabashed intensity that had brought Draco to his knees, literally and figuratively, just the night before.
“Ugh, do you have to be so crass?” Draco chides pushing himself away from Harry.
“Harry--”
His attention catches on the row behind Potter first. The Weasel has his chest bent over his desk, one hand reaching forward clutching at Potter’s robe. His whole body was shaking, his skin was flushed akin to a bright red apple. His face was contorted in an unattractive grimace from trying to hold in laughter. Well, he wasn't doing a very good job, was he? The Know-It-All was obviously not amused and was shushing him and making motions between McGonagall and their neglected notes. She looked more frazzled than usual, though it seemed to be more from trying to make sure she didn't miss too much of the lesson than from Draco’s declaration.
Draco had been the one to suggest they go for Indian. Harry, at the time, had found that to be quite thoughtful and charming of the sheltered pureblood. He should have known better. Draco, not familiar with the cuisine, had planned for Harry to pick what they would be eating. Draco himself would provide the wine selection for the evening. To keep away from the eyes of any slimy Daily Prophet reporters they had decided to make it a low key night getting takeaway and dining in at Harry’s flat. Harry had been plating up their respective meals when Draco arrived. Inquiring about the differences in their meals the blond was annoyed to learn Harry had ordered himself something called pork vindaloo and Draco would be having butter chicken. A much safer choice as Harry had put it for his uninitiated taste buds. Draco being too competitive for his own good had insisted it was “just spice” and he could handle anything Harry could. In hindsight, Harry supposes he should have tried a little harder to stop Draco.
oh, here it comes. It burns! Where is that sour cream?”
Green eyes slowly open and a look akin to childlike wonderment overtakes Harry’s features as he very quietly exhales a small whisper of ‘oh’. There was no hiding exactly how Harry was making him feel now. The wild fluttering of his heart a dead giveaway.
“You and Potter?”
“Or maybe I’ll have two?”
“So Potter, huh?,” Draco’s cheeks flush once more and he gave a tiny nod in affirmation, “Let’s take a walk then, shall we? You can get me up to date with this wooing business and I can help you scheme! Operation Potter begins now!”
“Says the man with flakes of pie crust stuck to his lips.”
“I placed my bet on Potter being the one to slip up. I was so sure seeing as he does tend to cause scenes. Oh, well, congrats on bagging Potter then mate! … or whatever you two have going on now,” Blaise claps him on the back before turning his focus back toward the lesson.
“Pansy!”
“I had a feeling you read it.”
“Merlin's sake, finally!”
“Feels better. So much better.”
Stupid Potter.
—mal! Some date you—
to get anything? More like
“People—
Maybe the night hadn't turned out exactly how Harry had ever imagined it would be like. And maybe it was far from being perfect in some people's eyes but it was...perfectly

You haven't even begun to fathom the beguiling ways in which I’d make you—
“Oh, no! I didn’t mean- you know I always speak without-,” Draco frantically sputters trying to undo some of the damage, “I think you loo--”
His eyes snap up to meet Draco’s at the unexpected use of his first name. Harry catches Draco’s chin forcing their eyes to meet. Hesitant grey meets heated green.
Grey eyes, sharp with perception, snap open to meet emerald green. “Found my imminent death amu—
It was Pansy’s turn to nod her head in agreement. “Definitely.”
you—Draco, you—
Still in a stupor from maybe the best kiss of his life, Harry eloquently manages, “Wha…?”
“Propriety be damned! Robes be damned,” Draco exclaims breaking off a piece of the pie crust. “I wait all year for this. I don't want to wait any longer,” He crunches down onto the piece of crust and reaches again for the spoon. “And consider me taking the rest of yours as payback for that little seduction trick you just tried. There are children here for Merlin’s sake! Have you no couth?!”
“Try looking at it this way—yes, everyone may have already read it but it’s not you that they’re necessarily laughing at.”
—is this how it ends? Is everything—
"Just that you think it took this to make you the laughingstock of Hogwarts and not your obsession with Potter."
“Ha Ha,” Draco responds with a deadpan voice and a roll of his eyes.
―there's a hole burning through it.” Draco moans as he clutches at his throat and sinks himself further into Harry’s couch.
it! No one would care about another bloke that much unless he fancied him!”
"Thank you for the clarification. I’ll be able to sleep better knowing I don't have any familial competition for your heart. And I suppose I love you too,” Draco says softly as he settles himself into Harry's side, letting his head fall onto a broad shoulder.
—for good.”
Over the years it had become a very famous dessert at Florean Fortescue's to celebrate the beginning of Autumn. It was only available for a short amount of time and it also just happened to be Draco’s absolute favorite. Every year he waited, practically counting down the days until he could experience the heavenly treat once more (Harry even swears he saw it written in Draco’s daily organizer though the latter vehemently denies it). This year though, there was a problem keeping him from enjoying the sweet delicacy.
Draco closes his eyes and lets out a long suffering sigh pinching the bridge of his nose in frustration.
“Have three for all I care!”
Harry makes his way over, pushing one of Draco’s annoyingly long legs out of his way, and settles himself between those long limbs on the coffee table before him.
“Your welcome.”
“You are the one who decided you didn't want to get anything,” Harry says, finally giving in and acknowledging the one-man pity party Draco has been throwing for himself.
When he wasn't at work Harry preferred wearing muggle clothing. Draco wasn't even sure Harry had a proper set of dress robes, to be honest, so he had no clue what Draco was going through. For the wedding, Harry had ultimately decided to go with a cream-colored sherwani with an exquisite gold pattern sewn throughout and a deep burgundy dress robe to be worn open over top. For the reception, however, he would be changing into a tuxedo. It was his way of trying to honor every part of his heritage.
"How dare you!"
“Nothing in that story makes one bit of sense. How about being in the awful band?” Blaise jests.
“Must be a pen name then.” She reaches for the parchment, scans over the text for a moment and begins to read aloud, “‘Then he put his thingie into my you-know-what and we did it for the first time. “Oh! Oh! Oh!” I screamed. I was beginning to get an orgasm.’ Didn't know you were such a filthy little minx in bed Malfoy.”
“Judging from all the grammar and spelling mistakes—we figured it must be a Gryffindor.”
“I’m hoping.”
wooing him then?”
“And that’s not personal? When are you going to announce it formally?”
"Oh, please! As if you two would behave any better if this was happening to you!” Blaise quirks his brow and Pansy crosses her arms. A shared look of disbelief crosses their refined features. “Ok, fine you would.” Draco concedes.
"I'll have to trust you on that."
So many thoughts were racing through his mind but the one that jumped to the forefront was just how beautiful of a person Potter was. Not just in the physical sense either (though it almost infuriated Draco to think how ridiculously good looking he is). It was the compassion and kindness he had maintained despite his arduous childhood. His loyalty to those lucky enough to be called his friend. How he possessed more humility than most witches and wizards, who couldn't claim half of the achievements Harry could, all before leaving Hogwarts. All of those qualities had led Potter to reach out in their eighth year and begin a fragile friendship with a boy the wizarding world had all but cast away.
“Yes! I assure you it's the writing itself. The general absurdity of it all. Have you even read it yet?”
Harry leans back, eyes closed, mouth slightly parted, chest heaving, lungs desperate to reclaim as much oxygen as they could. All the buttons of his shirt had been undone at this point, teasing Draco with a tantalizing sliver of a flat, taut stomach and broad chest.
Unphased by Draco's dramatics Blaise doesn't even spare a glance up from his essay before retorting, “I believe that would be parchment."
“I’m fine. See no more hiccups even.” He crosses his arms and takes in a mouthful of air.
He had been minding his own business, enjoying a late dinner when a group of students, from intermixed Houses, one table over, had caught his attention by glancing over every so often and giggling. By the time he had finished off his apple crumble for dessert, his patience was all but gone. He had stormed over to demand what exactly was so funny. What he hadn't expected was to find them crowded over a lengthy piece of parchment. What he had expected even less was the heinous crime against himself that had been written on said parchment. He snatches it from the table, a flush burning red on his cheeks and for a moment he is frozen in place. A fresh round of giggling shakes him from his reverie and he dashes from the hall.
Nearly everything about him was stupid to the point of absurd. His stupid hair. Stupidly sticking every which way. How it had felt thick and a bit coarser than he had imagined. His stupid lips. Stupidly perfect how full and soft they were. How surely they had dominated his own.  His stupid eyes. How they had managed to strip Draco of all resolve with one impassioned look. He hadn't even mentioned what a vibrant green they were. Stupid for eyes to be so bright, really. Those stupid hands. How they had fumbled just a bit with his belt buckle but regained all confidence once their cocks were pressed together.
“Disgusting. Ew—
Draco falls into quiet retrospection as he scours his memory for a Gryffindor by that name. Not that he had a reason to keep tabs on all those pompous do-gooding losers.
“Potter ?” A sudden voice behind them said, making them turn to witness McGonagall watching them with curious eyes. “I thought you would be at Hogsmeade tonight ?”
Heyyyy !
Harry stared at him, then smiled wildly, blush spreading on his face.
The discussion turned into lighter subject when Harry attention get drawn to the couch again. This time, he saw Crookshanks giving a slightly head stroke at Magnolia, before leaving to follow Hermione.
“Who am I fooling ?” Harry let his hand softly covering the cat’s back. “Of course I missed him.” He admitted, blushing slightly in the dark. “I wouldn’t imagine it, but after not seeing him for a year, barely meeting him those two times wasn’t enough, I thought more about him than about Ginny ! Er-“ Harry felt embarrassed.
“What are you trying to say ?”
“Oh shut up Potter, I know I’m pretty.” Malfoy answer, but Harry could hear that he was smiling.
The room’s door didn’t get close yet that Harry threw himself on the bed. Magnolia was not Malfoy, it was just a bloody patronizing cat. Nothing else. God, this year would be long.
Harry did as told, and his jaw dropped a little. The pyjamas he gave Malfoy was a bit too large, Harry didn’t like sleeping in tight clothes, and his shoulder was exposed as well as his collarbones and the top of his chest. Like this, even with Malfoy trying to fix the top, Harry was able to see the faint of the old scar, light pink on his milky skin.
“ I’m awake, it’s okay, stop.” Harry grumbled.
The night will be long for Harry.
On those words, Potter and him stood up. At they were leaving, Draco suddenly turned around.
He stared at the wall for a while, but the air was hit and steamy, and he was starting to be drowsy. He had to fall asleep, because when he opened his eyes, he was again in Potter arms, he should really not get used to it, and they were in the darkness of the corridor. When they entered Potter’s room, the latest let the cat down. He petted his head and went to bed. Draco stayed for while, a bit dumb.
“Well, er- I’m fond of cats.” Harry felt himself blushing again.
“Please, sit down.”
“Yeah, I’m sure you tired.” Pansy commented in a snarky voice.
“How ? As you said, I was just a prick, I bullied you for years, I was just so jealous of you and angry that you didn’t chose me.” Draco said, suddenly pushing Harry away, making him sat. “I never stopped trying to hurt you in any way, I even was the one who brought the Death Eaters inside the school. It’s all my fault.”
“Draco ?”
Malfoy jumped on the side and sat down, staring at Harry and the latter was sure that git was smiling.
As usual, English is not my mother tongue and I apologize for any mistakes or typos !
“What do you want Potter ?” Draco asked, almost hopeful.
Draco was sure he would be red as a tomato if he wasn’t hide by the white of his fur. Just by picturing Potter naked under the water. Well, he already did it when he was younger, but it wasn’t his fault ! Potter was quite charming even if he was a insufferable and pretentious git, and as a teenager, it was hard to resist to the hormones. But as he was panicking, not knowing how an actual cat would act. After all, he didn’t want to raise any suspicion if he was a cat or an animagus. It would be too much humiliating.
“Beware Luna, he is a defiant cat.” Potter said.
He knew Malfoy couldn’t answer, but the way he snuggled his head against his neck made Harry’s heart flustered. He passed his arms around the small form, and kissed the top of his head. He wished he had the real Malfoy.
“I’m leaving for breakfast, see you tonight and behave!”
Tw// this chapter mention past sexual assault
A cry woke up Draco in a jolt. Confused at first, he tried to remembered where he was when an another cry, a louder one, shrilled. Totally awaken now, he realized that the cries where coming from Potter. He was agitated, and Draco had to jump on the side to avoid a kick. Without thinking, he went toward Potter and ,after a particularly hard jolt, started to meow, loudly. But he was covered but Potter screams now, and in the panic, Draco licked Potter’s face, his cheeks, his nose, his lips, anything to wake him up. Eventually, Potter seemed to be calmer, if not awaken. Draco saw the tears rolling down his cheeks, and he couldn’t come to terms to let Potter. So, he climbed on his chest, licking the tears. Once done, he started purring, knowing that he could be relaxing to human, and when he felt Potter’s heart getting back to a more normal rhythm, he knew it was the good thing to do. Draco purred so hard, that he was vibrating. Eventually, he felt falling asleep,
there wasn’t any tag of the name of “Magnolia”. It was written “Draco Malfoy”.
“Come with me, Potter, the hallway isn’t a place to have this kind of conversation.” McGonagall said after a long moment of silence.
“Wait Malfoy!”
Eventually, Malfoy closed his eyes and put his fluffy head between his paws, slowly starting to purr.
“But, if you’re okay with that, I’ll kiss you again, Draco, because the first time I was a bit too shocked.”
“And how do you know that ?”
“Well, you didn’t say thank you for the trial neither, for that matter.” Harry said, shrugging.
“ Or no one
“Draco ! Oh my god !” Pansy shouted as she jumped onto her feet.
“Why you called him prince then ?” Hermione asked a bit coldly. “He has nothing to do with Salazar Slytherin.”
He couldn’t, Harry couldn’t endure more without acting, he pulled Malfoy into his arms, hugging him so hard that he was crushing him. He was whispering soft and reassuring things, while Malfoy was sobbing against his chest, grabbing his back like at life.
“And as he was working on a pretty tricky hex, he got hit. Hopefully, the professionals were close so they cleaned the curse before it got too much dangerous. However, his body answered at the offensive by turning into his animagus form.”
When Harry woke up the next morning, it was thanks to Malfoy meowing to his face, following to a bump with his forehead right
“Will you release me ?” Draco asked, raising his still perfectly drew eyebrow.
“Really ? What about ?” She asked, barely raising her head.
Once they arrived in the headmistress office, Harry noticed immediately that it looked quite differently from when Dumbledore was occupying the place. More tidy, and neat.
“Good night Magnolia.”
Draco snorted, and tried to flee, but Potter’s grip on him tightened.
“Because I know you ! And even…”
into his nose, before meowing again, louder.
Harry was in his side, watching Malfoy, slowly approaching his hand to his.
“Well, I hope I won’t stay too long out of the secret.”
“That was the first word that crossed my mind.” She said with a false apologetic look.
And now, they were back on the last name term. As Draco was about to get up, Harry grabbed him and pushed him on the bed, making the slytherin boy yelp.
“And Harry is kind of fond of you, you know.” She said. “I’m sure he would be really happy to welcom you too.”
“I’m not surprised, you have always been a bit slow.”
“Oy stop it ! I’m awake !” He exclaimed louder this time.
So I did my best ! I really hope you like it, forgive me for any typo or mistakes, as usual no beta reader here !
Malfoy purring under his administrations, now that he knew it was him. But he had still some questions, so as he was leaving, he made sure to take a little detour. Maybe McGonagall could answer him some of his questions.
Shifting uncomfortably, the raven-hair boy wiggled his fingers.
“Have a good day Potter.”
Draco opened his mouth, but closed it after no sound escaped from it. So Harry slowly approached his head, and let a kiss on Draco -still a bit ajar- lips. As Harry didn’t get any reaction from the blond boy, he just lay down next to him, and started stroking his hair, until eventually Draco got out from his numbness.
“It’s okay.” Harry tried to sound comforting and smiled. “I had some too, you know. You want to talk about it ?”
The silent fell once again, Draco closed his eyes, as he was assimilating the news. But Harry could say that he was also visibly more relaxed. Out of the blue, Draco, still with his eyes closed, started to get closer to Harry, until their lips were close enough for Harry to feel Draco’s breath. He closed the distance and started kissing Draco, slowly, his hand caressing now his cheek.
Draco rolled his eyes but didn’t answer, he didn’t know what Pansy knew, but for sure she had an idea. He gave a pat on Blaise shoulder and a cheek kiss on Pansy cheek, he didn’t dare to turn toward Potter, scared that the thing -whatever it was- between them got exposed. So he just nodded mildly to Potter’s direction and went straight up to the corridor that lead to the boys rooms. He knew that the last free room was at the end of the corridor on the right, he supposed he was there. As he was about to open the door, he heard footsteps, but their owner didn’t stay mysterious too long.
“Okay, okay I let you go, but only because you’re damn cute.”
He would not be able to tell how long he watched him before falling asleep too, maybe five minutes, maybe hours. He forgot to put off his glasses, but to late, so he just readjusted in his nose. However, when he opened his eyes, the pictures in front of him tasted like a déjà-vue. Malfoy was snuggling against him, laying more atop of him then on the bed, the early light of the morning lightening his hair, and Harry couldn’t help but brushed then, to check if they were as soft as they looked like. And they were.
He was happy, that he could turn into a cat however he wanted, so it means his body recovered from the curse. However, should he really go to professor McGonagall ? He hadn’t decided yet. Of course, it without Potter aka the Gryffindor hero going to her and spitting everything. Sure he would do it. Well, at least this was settle he guessed.
Under his fingerprints, he was feeling a scar, a really nasty scar. As he travelled along it, stroking it so lightly he was barely touching it, he noticed that the scar started from the upper right side of the chest to the left side of the hip. Harry gulped. It couldn’t be, right ? It couldn’t be Malfoy. Of course, he didn’t know if Malfoy had the scar anyway, the scar Harry inflicted himself one and a half year ago. Snape healed it, he said he healed it and that it shouldn’t leave any scar. But the shape reminded him the trail of blood on Malfoy shirt, he couldn’t stop thinking about it. What if… what if he was stroking at the precise scar he gave to Malfoy.
“You’re all red.” Potter commented.
Shut up, that’s not funny ! Draco grumbled in his head, but he hissed in real life. Potter just laughed with Pansy and Blaise, which was a odd scene, and he left the common room. The walk toward the headmistress office was plunged into silence.
Surprised, Draco felt his cheeks got hotter. They stayed for few seconds, staring at each other dead in the eyes, holding their breath like if just doing this simple thing would break the sudden heavy atmosphere. But something else broke it. They heard steps outside the room and Potter just closed the door hastily with a motion of the wrist, hence dropping Draco hands, and suddenly, Draco felt cold.
“I.. I don’t want to describe it.” Malfoy shook his head, still not rising his head. “ It was awful enough the first time I endured it, it’s even harder to relive it again, and again, and…” Malfoy broke into a sob.
“I heard that a former Death Eater was with them.” Seamus suddenly appeared, offloaded of his own bag, Dean just behind him.
“Not only for that.” Harry added.
“It’s-… But-… I-… And why are you petting me ?” Draco seemed utterly confused.
“And are you sorry ? For what all you did…” Harry asked, suddenly feeling the need to know, he needed to know.
What Draco loved about being a cat was definitively the lack of dreams - nightmares he should say- in his sleep. He had the most restful and peaceful sleep he ever had these last two years. And this morning was no different when he woke up, still on Potter’s chest he supposed. He felt refreshed and enjoyed the few moments before he opened his eyes. But, something was weird today, something was a bit off but he wouldn’t put the paw on it. As he tried to stretch, something was blocking him, well more specifically two muscular arms.
Running, keep running, stop thinking, Harry scolded himself. The sun eventually rose up, and as he took a break and conjured some water, he admired the beauty of the landscape, colored from pink to orange. Every morning, he witnessed it, and every morning, he was impressed by the incredibly colors that painted the grass and the sky, it was a different painting every day. He smiled, when suddenly a white flower fall at his feet. Harry picked up, and looked at it, curious, before looking around, wondering where it came from. There were no flowers trees by there, the wind should had bring it to him. But as he studied more carefully, he noticed some grey reflects on the petals, and he couldn’t help but smile. It reminded him a certain blonde guy, and he wondered how he would look with the flower on his hair. His smile dropped, and he threw the flower away, blushed spreading up his neck. He shouldn’t be thinking about him, or about something so... cheeky. Malloy didn’t give any living sign since he testified for his trial, not even a ‘thank you’.
“Because I hope it would calm you down, and yes I know it’s crazy. But hey, I had to face reality.” Harry ended with a shrug.
He was getting closer and, his hand brushed against Draco long fingers. Draco was sure his heart was about to jump out of his chest and ran away. He never felt so furiously flustered, happy and shy at the same time. Sodd it, he never felt shy since he was like four.
No I don’t like Potter, he is just the only one that accepted me, but now that you’re here Luna, I don’t need him anymore ! Draco thought. But it turned out to be only a pitiful meow.
“What ?!” Neville screamed. “ You-know-who is back ?! “
Without waiting for an answer, Draco turned into a cat before dying of embarrassment.
So Draco crawled out, to discover that there were no teacher around. Contrariwise, there were just four students. They were chatting and Draco slipped between Potter’s legs because of course it would be Potter who that on the couch. Around, there were Luna, Granger and Longbottom, as usual the two last didn’t pay much attention to him but Luna just let her hand down and brushed his fur while he passed by her. Draco went hidden behind a armchair, and lied down.
“Yes Mr. Sainte Nitouche.” Harry snickered as he did as told.
“Well I wanted to talk about Magnolia.” He answered with a big smile.
Suddenly, Magnolia cat’s eyes shoot open, before running away like his tail was on fire, disappearing
It was not because Draco was wandless that he wasn’t working, he was writing every single thing that damn curse-breakers were doing, for a month at least. At the beginning of August, the teenager had memorized few of diagnosis spells, and the how each of the curse-breaker proceed. But he was absolutely certain that he would just be a secretary, writing all their files report instead of them.
From hail high above the owls came swooping in to deliver the mail. Hedwig dropped a note into Harry's lap, which was the first piece of mail Harry had received that year. It made him jump, and it made Neville spill his drink because Harry knocked his elbow. Harry stared at the letter in his lap for a few moments, because
Nerves took him once more then. He could play. Everything he'd learned now could be put to the test soon. Frantically he considered everything Hermione had told him, and then covered what his teammates had said. He repeated it to himself until Marcus Flint went down, very slowly mind you, he did not go down easily like Adrian. He fell the farthest as well, he didn't lower his broom when it started to act up. It was Professor Dumbledore's quick reflexes that kept him from hitting the ground hard when he fell one hundred feet.
“My, you’re a funny sight,” The Headmaster tottled, and then smiled over his half-moon spectacles. Harry smiled back, though it felt more like a grimace. “Let’s get you back to your common room.”
Squirrel? Dog? Mess? Quirrell! Professor Quirrell had tried to go after the Philosopher’s Stone that evening. It was exactly like they expected. Except Professor Snape had put alerts up. They’d caught the DADA teacher in the act. The stone was safe.
“But I haven’t done anything.” Harry shot back.
"Or check to make sure the dog is still alive!" Harry whisper shouted. He didn't care what the thing was; if Professor Snape was actually the villain in this scenario, and the object was important enough to hide behind a three-headed dog, he wanted to stop Snape first.
"Oh, well I thought you were another one of Fred and George's jokes," he paused. "So do you really have the, you know..." He pointed at Harry's forehead.
"A giant Cerberus." Neville answered easily. Draco nodded knowingly, and then his eyes widened.
On one hand Harry agreed with Neville, but on the other hand he thought that Neville was forgetting that Draco had
Draco found the emotions at the table quite different than at his own. If you wanted a dish you asked for it, loudly, and if someone asked for a dish you passed it to them rather immediately. Certain students weren't allowed to touch the dishes, such as Neville or the Weasley Twins, and if they did you either got pranked or spilled on.
“I’ll talk to the teachers about that.” Professor Snape agreed.
"Well... if you want to stay with them, we understand." Harry said finally. Draco had been raising himself up for their response, and looked very prim and proper in that moment. Until what Harry said sunk in, and then very much like the first time they talked his face went through a range of emotions.
"Thanks." Harry said. He brushed his hair from his forehead that stuck due to the sweat.
"Being friends with us is making all your other friends leave?" Neville asked. Draco nodded solemnly, and sniffled for a good long moment.
A few minutes later the potion turned green and Draco put the crushed snake fangs in. There was giggling behind them in that moment, and they turned as a unit to see Seamus and Lavender having fun sprinkling the crushed snake fangs instead of dumping them in as Harry and Draco did.
A whistle sounded. Harry looked up at the ceiling like that was where the sound came from. He felt a flood of relief fill him, and a sense of reality appeared. This was actually happening. He was actually on a train, to a school he knew nothing about besides it was a magic school. This was happening.
A loud crash followed, and all the students turned to the noise. Harry gasped, as did the people around him. About twenty people had just jumped through the back wall. They were milky white and semi-transparent, and they glided across the room whilst talking to one another, and hardly glanced at the first years. They seemed to be arguing, though of what was hard to discern.
Harry shook his head, but he could feel a tug in his head; something about what the boy said felt weird. The boy closed the door behind him and plopped himself down on the seat. He glanced at Harry for a moment before he looked out the window.
Harry hadn't ever seen such a place in his dreams or in movies. The entire hall was filled with floating candles that had no melt marks; they floated over the four long tables just feet above where the students sat. The tables were filled with gold plates and goblets with nothing on them, which was a strange sight indeed to the young boy. At the front of the hall, farthest from the doors, was a long table with a line of people sitting behind it. All of them gazed at the incoming students, some with delight, and others with intrigue. Professor McGonagall shepherded the grouplet into a line that extended to the front of the hall, and turned to face the body of students rather than the professors. Hundreds of faces stared back at them, and the light of the floating candles reflected off of those faces in a way that made them appear to be faint lanterns. The opaque and luminous shimmer of ghosts could be seen widely dispersed throughout the students. The eyes that bored into them unnerved Harry, so he looked up at the ceiling. He had expected to see nothing, as he couldn't in the entrance hall, but instead he found himself looking into a deep silkin sky stippled with little twinkling lights.
He slipped back to his housemates, who clapped him on the back for what he'd done. It took Madam Hooch a while before she got the first years under control and back to practicing. Minus Neville, who was effectively banned from riding them. Not that he minded.
"I don't think he has a bad bone in his body," Draco answered. He remembered a steely gaze of one of their teachers that had made him shiver a few times."Professor McGonagall? She seems like she could be evil if she wanted too."
The dialogue of the professors are very book heavy, as we are still setting up the story. And of course, we own nothing.
Ron picked up a green jelly bean, looked at it carefully, and bit into a corner. "Blaaargh - see? Sprouts."
"What?" Harry asked, because he was sure he heard that wrong.
"What?" Harry said.
"Hagrid?" Draco asked. "Isn't that the giant that took us to Hogwarts that first night?"
"Transfiguration is one of the most complex and scientific forms of magic you will learn. It requires your full attention. Should I find anyone mucking around, they will be removed from my class permanently." She said, and her steely gaze ensured that the message sunk in.
Draco found that Dean was interesting to talk to, if Seamus had his wand out to duck and cover, Parvati had a twin in Ravenclaw named Padma, Lavender was a bit of a gossiper, Hermione was a lecturer, Ron was big into Quidditch and eating, Neville was a blushing mess through most of eating, and Harry was far more quiet than he'd expected.
“Depends on how much you know.” Professor Snape said very quietly. The hackles on their necks raised and there was a pause as the four thought.
"Have you managed to find Trevor yet?" She asked Neville.
"So... See you in class?" Harry asked, because he didn't know where to go from there. Harry had never had friends. Neville likely stuck around him because Harry never said go away -not that Harry was ever going to-, and it was possible Hermione didn't consider
"I-I'm glad you didn't get expelled." Neville said first. Draco pulled a sour face at the thought.
"Because every time a broom went down he was whispering a spell," Harry explained, like he'd expected Draco to ask such a thing. Draco hadn't expected that. At first he was curious, what if Professor Snape had tried something? No, that wasn't right, Draco knew Professor Snape personally, and could guarantee that the man would never actively hurt a student of any House.
"I vote we never go back." Neville mumbled. Without any hesitation Hermione and Harry agreed. No treasure was worth nearly dying for.
“The Tales of Beedle the Bard,” Harry said aloud as he pulled out another book. He ran his finger over the blue cover where a man with a pointy beard and hat sat staring at you with a quill in his hand.
"I think I'd rather break a wrist than have the Malfoy heir expelled." Neville responded.
Draco rushed through the changing room, and no one stopped him. He figured his actions made them think he was scared of the field after three of their team members went down, but that wasn't why he wanted to get in and out as quickly as possibly; he wanted to ask Hermione why in the world she set Professor Snape's robes on fire, and why Harry and Neville let her.
Draco used the new knowledge about Parvati to slip in next to Padma during his classes with Ravenclaws, and hung out with his housemates only during classes with Hufflepuffs, because he wasn't brave enough to try and talk to someone in the badger house. When he was with his housemates during class, Pansy and Blaise stuck around him, so the nitpicking his house did was dropped to a safe minimum. The only time he truly had to deal with his housemates dislike was when he was in his common room, and that only happened at curfew, because Hermione had offered to have him in the Gryffindor common room for studying. Which quickly became for fun, but hey, it was the thought that counted.
"Why do
"Anyone else sitting here?" He asked, and pointed at the empty seat across from Harry. "Everywhere else is full."
"I bet Draco is being nice to be your friend." Ron said to Harry helpfully. Harry jumped at the noise, because he hadn't seen Ron before he spoke.
"Don't do it again." Professor McGonagall ordered. Draco schooled his face and nodded, though in the back of his mind he wanted to point out that had he not helped Neville he could have hurt himself.
“You are free to leave,” Professor Snape said, and they all rose to the occasion. “And, two weeks detention with me for even thinking of trying to face a teacher on your own.”
It couldn't have been ten minutes before the first mishap happened. Brook Ivanovok, a seventh year Chaser on the Slytherin team, was scooted a foot up her broom as she reached for a quaffle. The ball began to fall, and was picked up by the Gryffindor Chaser.
“What did you see?” Professor Dumbledore asked. Harry was tempted to keep quiet, but the old wizard walked forwards and stood beside Harry, in front of the mirror. He didn’t say or do anything else for a long time, and Harry finally showed his head.
The entire day was filled with baked goods and sweets and fun treats. It was the best Christmas Harry had ever seen or been a part of, and it kept going and going. The Weasley’s made him a part of the clan for the day, and he played games and went about the castle with them as they pranked what few were there. He gained more gifts throughout the day, from a wizarding chess set to a Grow-Your-Own-Warts kit, and the dinner was a spectacle. Professor Dumbledore traded out his pointy hat for a flower bonnet, and was laughing heartily at something Professor Flitwick said. Hagrid was red-cheeked and spent a good long while plucking up his courage before he leaned over and kissed Professor McGonagall on the cheek, who flat out giggled at Hagrid. He stared at the three teachers with some guilt over suspecting them to be after the stone when Professor Quirrell was so obvious, only now that he knew about it. He, like Professor Snape, kept an eye on Professor Quirrell that evening to make sure he didn't go after the stone. It was clear this was a good night to do it if he was going to try anything.
"Ahem. Just a few more words now that we are all fed and watered. I have a few beginning-of-the-year notices to give you; First years should note that the forest on the grounds is forbidden to all pupils. A few of our older students would do well to remember that as well," Dumbledore said, and his twinkling eyes flashed in the direction of the Weasley twins. "I have also been asked by Mr. Filch, the caretaker, to remind you all that no magic should be used between classes in the corridors. Quidditch trials will be held in the second week of the term. Anyone interested in playing for their house teams should contact Madam Hooch. And finally, I must tell you that this year, the third floor corridor on the right hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a very painful death."
“Happy Christmas!” Ron told him as he took a spot beside Harry with his large pile. Harry looked over the six gifts for him, nowhere near the same size stack for Ron, but it was his very own stack of colorful arrays of presents.
“Think about it, Harry.” She whispered. Harry looked over at her, and then at the other two. He already understood
“Goodnight Harry,” Professor Dumbledore said to the Fat Lady picture. She woke up from her nap and stared at the two of them quite confusedly. “Open.”
A few minutes before class started Draco broke from the Slytherin group and walked towards the Gryffindors. In his hand, which he tossed carelessly now, was Neville's remembrall. He swaggered to the Gryffindors, and at the front of the group was Neville, who had walked forwards to take the remembrall back. Draco didn't give it back though, he continued to toss it in midair.
"He is," said the first twin. "Aren't you?" he asked.
Draco flinched at those words, and he looked down at the table. The Slytherins on his side of the room grumbled at him, but it was too quiet for Harry to hear.
The two remaining Gryffindor first years woke up on Christmas morning to a stack of presents at the foot of their beds, and they both bounded up and out and over to their respective spots. Ron began to move his pile closer to Harry, and Harry met him halfway. The idea of sharing gifts seemed like a wonderful idea, something Harry had never had the chance to do, regardless of who it was with.
"Shut up." Ron said again. Ron was almost as tall as the twins, and had the same pale and freckled skin as they had. He was gangly where they weren't though. His nose was pink where his mother had rubbed it.
"How do you know it's the future?" Neville asked curiously.
Professor Snape did it, he just didn’t like that they were given detention for trying to help. You reward behavior like this, not punish. Though maybe Professor Snape
"Asphodel and wormwood make the Draught of Living Death." Draco blurted out after the silence had gone on for a minute. Professor Snape froze in breath, and Harry thought he would die on the spot if looks could kill. Hermione's arm dropped.
It happened quite suddenly. The sallow skinned teacher tapped lightly on Professor Quirrell and said something to him. Almost like clockwork Professor Quirrell looked at his table partner, and pointed in Harry's general direction. As one the two turned to look at him. A white hot, sharp pain seared through Harry's scar in that moment.
if he was ok.
“Who’s there?” The Fat Lady asked as her portrait swung open, but no one responded. All she heard was the patter of feet, which thoroughly freaked her. Invisible ghosts! What a new one.
At breakfast Thursday morning Neville got a gift from his grandmother. It was a small orb with white smoke in it, and he called it a Remembrall.
“All of us did. Are you sure it’s Professor Quirrell?” Draco asked.
Harry mentally jumped when the hat began to talk to him.
"Password?" She asked quite suddenly, and Harry was happy Ron had shown him the cards earlier that day.
“No,” Professor Snape answered. They looked back at him, confused. “You four are to remain out of the way.”
Harry stared at the professor who had so sharply asked him to answer a question that seemed impossible to answer. Was that supposed to be obvious? Was it common knowledge? Was it something in the book he had yet to read?
"J-just now... My gran sent it." Neville answered. Draco tilted his head and looked at the ball again.
Harry set the package down and picked up the blanket. It felt like water to the touch, and was far bigger than he, so big he thought he and his friends could use it comfortably to hide under. He threw it around his shoulders and watched Ron.
"Thanks." He said.
Harry got into line behind a boy with platinum blond hair, with Neville and Hermione behind him, and they walked out of the chamber, back across the hall, and through a pair of double doors into the Great Hall.
A girl with blonde pigtails broke from the group and bounded up the stairs to the hat. She flounced down into the seat and the hat was sat atop her head for only a moment before it shouted out: "HUFFLEPUFFLE."
A few of the Slytherins sniggered behind their hands. Draco wasn't one of them, though Professor Snape didn't seem to take notice. He finished taking roll without pausing on any other student.
"C-can I have that back?" Neville asked hesitantly. Draco smiled cheekily, and tossed the glass ball back and forth between his fingers. The smoke in the ball began turning red as Draco stopped smiling and he stopped tossing the ball.
"Neville and I could go," Hermione said. Harry looked at the muggleborn with a beaming smile, which she returned with half as much teeth.
“Sit,” He ordered them. “No, Mr. Longbottom, he is much too smart to let something like a vampire stop him.”
“He’d see it.” The Professor answered. He shuffled up though, to feign giving more of his attention to them than he’d already given.
As if on cue the Grand Hall doors opened and Draco walked in with an airy smile. Professor Snape walked behind him like a dark cloud, but that didn't seem to affect the Slytherin blond. He swaggered his way down the aisles with Professor Snape until he got with his classmates and was sat down. Like a pack of hounds they surrounded Draco with questions. In no time, the entire table made noises of celebration. It wasn't long before everyone knew what had happened.
Piece of cake.
"Five," Ron corrected glumly. "I'm the sixth in our family to go to Hogwarts. You could say I've got a lot to live up to. Bill and Charlie have already left; Bill was head boy and Charlie was captain of Quidditch. Now Percy's a Prefect. Fred and George mess around a lot, but they still get really good marks and everyone thinks they're really funny. Everyone expects me to do as well as the others, but if I do, it's no big deal, because they did it first. You never get anything new, either, with five brothers. I've got Bill's old robes, Charlie's old wand, and Percy's old rat."
That wasn’t the password, but Professor Dumbledore could go anywhere he wanted. It swung open, and thankfully the Pink Lady didn’t ask questions.
“They were my students, and later great friends of mine,” The Headmaster explained. He looked down at Harry. “They would be proud of you.”
"I'm Harry." He said, and he thrusted his hand forward to be shaken. Hermione looked at the hand and then back at his face with trepidation.
The sorting carried on after Harry. There were Thomas, Turpin, Weasley, and Zabini. Two went to Gryffindor, one went to Ravenclaw, and one went to Slytherin. Thus the sorting was done. Professor McGonagall took the hat away, and the man Harry could correctly identify as Albus Dumbledore stood up.
"Can't stay long, Mother," He said. "I'm up front, the Prefects have got two compartments to themselves."
It was a horrible sight. It was so tall it almost reached the ceiling of the bathroom. Its skin was a dull gray, and it moved its great, lumpy body like it was a boulder. Atop the boulder-like body was a tiny bald head that looked like a coconut, with ears large like coconut leaves. Along the floor was the thing they'd heard being dragged, which was a giant wooden club.
It was the smell that hit them first; a mix of old socks and a toilet that was never cleaned. It made them reach for their noses. Next was the sound; a steady grunt noise, followed with unsteady footfalls of giant feet and the sound of something being dragged. The sound stopped entirely for a good few seconds, and then the bathroom door flew open, and in walked the troll.
"I hope not." Neville whispered, mostly to himself. The five Gryffindor's looked about themselves for a bit, and then dropped the topic, because they couldn't figure it out without asking someone. Which could raise questions. Best to leave it silent.
The first Quidditch match wasn't until early November, so after the initial uproar of a first year on the Slytherin team, things died down. It was school, plain and simple. They went to their classes and then hung out with friends, all the while balancing their homework schedules. The only difference was that instead of going home to the Dursleys Harry went upstairs to his common room.
"Well, I still say you were lucky, but not many first years could have taken on a full-grown mountain troll. You each win Gryffindor and Slytherin five points. Professor Dumbledore will be informed of this. You may go." Professor McGonagall told them. Like their coats were on fire they took off down the hall in the direction Draco would have gone. Once around the bend they found Draco, who had gone only far enough to hide from the teachers.
The train lurched forwards, and Harry looked out the window as the station moved past him. Soon after, there were houses outside.
Two days later Harry saw off his best friends, as well as most of the school. Only a few students stayed behind; a Ravenclaw, a few Hufflepuffs, and a few Gryffindors- him, and all of the Weasleys. Without anything to do, and his Christmas homework done thanks to Hermione, Harry found most of his days wandering the halls at a pace he’d never had the luxury of before. He began to move curtains and pictures to see what was behind them, and found a few hidden corridors that he swore were far too short for the distance they took him. He began to talk to random statues and armor sets, and some would talk back. He would walk to the highest tower, and the lowest dungeon, and even went out on the grounds as far as he dared. One day near Christmas eve he swore he saw something large move in the black lake.
"Ouch!" Harry whispered, and clapped his head with his hand the same time he turned away from the table.
The two houses converged into one as Madam Hooch taught them the ropes. Draco once more stood near the Gryffindor's of his choice, and helped Hermione and Neville fly where he could. When Neville began to fly too high Draco pushed up with his own broom and rose up to help Neville down. The class watched from the ground as Draco and Neville floated, and Draco slowly helped Neville get in control of his broom.
"He thinks it's locked." Hermione said in relief.
Sir Nicholas reached out on reaction and shook Harry's hand. Harry, to his astonishment, didn't feel anything when he touched the ghost, as he was so familiar with his entire life, but did get a dunked in cold sensation from Sir Nicholas. Sir Nicholas' hand went straight through Harry's hand, but Harry got the distinct feeling the ghost was happy that he'd at least tried to shake hands with him.
"C-can I have that back?" Neville asked hesitantly. Draco smiled cheekily, and tossed the glass ball back and forth between his fingers. The smoke in the ball began turning red as Draco stopped smiling and he stopped tossing the ball. Draco sighed with the rest of them.
"Welcome to Hogwarts," said the professor. "The start-of-term banquet will begin shortly, but before you take your seats in the Great Hall, you will be sorted into your houses. The Sorting is a very important ceremony because, while you are here, your house will be something like your family within Hogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your house, sleep in your house dormitory, and spend free time in your house common room.
There was a knock on the door of their compartment and the round-faced boy Harry had passed on platform Nine and Three Quarters came in. He looked tearful.
"So if not Professor Snape, than who?" Hermione asked once more, but much more subdued.
"Goodbye Harry." Draco said, still with that same laced smile. Harry waved at the Slytherin as he left cooly with his two friends.
"Right then. FORWARD!" Hagrid hoed and pointed to the castle. The fleet of little boats moved off all at once, and glided across the lake, which was as smooth as glass, betraying the enchantments placed upon its surface. Everyone was silent as they stared up at the great castle. It towered over them as they sailed nearer and nearer to the cliff on which it stood.
Professor Dumbledore placed his hand on Harry’s back and led him out sternly. Harry could tell with just that hand that Professor Dumbledore, while he might have seemed carefree, had an urgency behind his force.
"That doesn't say anything about me." Harry said once more. Ron shrugged, like that ended that. It didn't though.
"Blimey," said the other twin. "Are you?"
-, which surprised the group because those hadn't been there the night before. As they were nearing the final level of the castle they learned why though: the stairs
“Er- don’t look at me like that ! You’re kinda a cute cat and I felt lonely.”
“Greyback is dead.” Harry whispered, tightening his grip.
Draco tried to run, ashamed to be caught, even more that Potter seemed annoyed. However, surprisingly, Potter squatted down and started to scratch Draco between his cat ears.
Malfoy’s cat ears flustered, but he didn’t move and started purring again. How cute, Harry couldn’t believe how cute Malfoy was. Eventually, he felt himself falling asleep, two last thoughts crossed his mind. First, he was happy that Malfoy was here, meaning he didn’t hate him at last, and second, he could be used to call him Kitty and that was cheesy as hell.
He was trying so hard to not lose control to his anger, to won’t help Malfoy. But just thinking of it he wished he was the one that killed Greyback from his bare hands. Instead, he managed put this aside.
“Anyway, I think I have to go to professor McGonagall anyway.”
“Oh, so the rumors were true.” Harry mumbled.
“No, no, no, please, stop, I’ll do better, please no, no.” Malfoy was crying in his sleep.
English is not my mother tongue, so I apologize for any mistakes or typos !
“Well, I got hit by a curse so…” Draco shift on his feet. “I was resting.”
“And Potter here sure would be sad if you would leave the castle.” She added with a smirk.
Well, Potter wasn’t very good at showing disgust and disdain. In lieu, all Draco could see was worried eyes, and maybe
“I never meant to fool you.” Potter whispered, getting closer to Draco. “I kinda felt guilty, because even knowing it was you, I couldn’t stop wanting to pet you and all. Worse, I-… I wanted to be more around you and hug you, and not only because I had less nightmares since we sleep together.”
Clear yesterday ? Draco thought. What Potter was talking about ? All he said that he was missing him and that he was sorry, nothing was clear at all. Wait… was he saying that he knew before that he was a cat ? On instinct, he turned out into human and crossed his arms.
After playing at exploding snap for three hours straight, Harry eventually went back to his room to get ready for the shower time. Malfoy left him about two hours ago, disturbed in his nap by the scream of Seamus, when he realized that Dean was in fact cheating. Harry petted Malfoy head quickly, who was napping on his bed, and headed to the bathroom.
Draco heard Potter coughed, clearly embarrassed and the slytherin couldn’t hear more, he didn’t want to. He silently sneaked out of the common room and went to upstairs, and without thinking, he found himself in Potter’s room. What a mistake ! He didn’t want it, no he wanted to go to Luna’s room and maybe cried on her shoulder, or at least slept peacefully on her armchair.
“I know that you were kind of found of Mr. Malfoy, but I wouldn’t imagine you would see him in a simple cat.” She said, raising an eyebrow.
“I’m sorry okay ! But you were just all there and all wanting to pet me, I tried to run away ! It’s not my fault !” Draco was now crying hysterically.
Potter snickered next to him and Draco refrained to sigh loudly and punch Potter shoulders. Instead, he greeted professor McGonagall and left, following by the gryffindor. For the biggest relief of Draco, the corridors were empty, he was resisting to turn into a cat again, the professor being clear that she wanted Draco to be a usual student again, as usual as possible.
Before leaving the 8th year common room, he said a word to Hermione, saying he would go seeing McGonagall because the headmistress asked him to.
“Thank you professor.” Said Draco, but didn’t say the other part of his thoughts. But I’m sure they would be the only ones.
“Well, that now you are not such a big prick as before and I’m sure if you do genuine apologizes, they will be ok.”
The beginning of the summer was so chaotic - with the trials and the inheritance of 12 Grimmauld Place - that he realized only recently that his attraction for the youngest Weasley had faded. After some awkward kisses and long even more awkward silences, he was relieved when she started to avoid him most of the time. Eventually, one evening after dinner, they agreed about that they shouldn’t go back together. Their relationship had stayed at
Harry tried to wake him up before what he guessed was an awful nightmare. He put one of his hands on his shoulder, framing him with his right arm then and shook him slightly, his other hand still brushing his hair.
I’m a well-mannered man, Potter ! Draco thought.
“Good night Malfoy.” He whispered, in a way more intimate way that he intended.
just didn’t want any of you ?” Hermione couldn’t help to ask back with a cold smile, not kinda forgetting her bitterness against the slytherin girl.
Draco Malfoy was sleeping on the couch of the eighth common room. Well, sleeping was a big word, he was drowsing, his mind repeating what had happened the evening. The fact that his own friends didn’t spare him a look, even if they couldn’t have a single idea that Magnolia was in fact him, Draco, and that the only one among the bunch of students whom could be a bit nice to a poor cat was Potter.
“Yes of course, Professor. Thank you for answering.” He added as he stood up.
“But if it was this summer, that means he is stuck as cat for almost two months !” Harry exclaimed. “ Why ?”
months. Potter sat down on a armchair, in the other side of the desk, and put Draco the cat on his knees. But Draco was too embarrassed to stay there, knowing perfectly that the professor knew, so he just jumped down, made a few steps before turning into human again, he had no interest at staying into his cat form.
“Don’t worry Harry, I think he kinda likes you, right ?” Luna asked Draco with a particularly good scratch, which made him almost purr, almost.
“Potter ?” Draco whispered.
Suddenly, Harry was out of patience. He turned himself a bit to give a look at Parkinson.
When done, he went to the armchair and pet Malfoy head.
Slowly, very slowly, Harry’s hand came nearer, just under the cat nose, who had stayed still. Seeing that he wasn’t moving, Harry kept going, brushing slowly the furry cheek of Magnolia. Harry couldn’t contain his smile, when the feline closed his eyes, gently nudging against the hand.
“I’m sure you’re still too beautiful for your own good.” Harry said with a cheeky smile.
The smile on Harry’s face dropped, realizing that if Malfoy wouldn’t want him to see him naked, it wasn’t only because he was a bit prude or shy.
“ Ouch !” he screamed in pain.
Harry couldn’t help but smile, he was so happy that Malfoy was able to answer his good night that he just grabbed his hand a bit to roughly, making the now smaller boy startle. Harry was about to withdraw his hand, but Malfoy just closed his fingers on his own, their fingers intertwined. Harry’s smile grew wilder, as he kept watching Malfoy side, his face illuminated by the white light of the moon.
“It’s always the same.” Malfoy explained, still staring at their hands. “I wasn't able to finish at time the… the task He gave me. I failed. And so He punishes me, He uses crucio on me and then gives me to-to Greyback.”
“Dont wander too far Crookshanks.” It was Granger’s voice, really close to him.
Potter didn’t try to catch him or anything, it wasn’t a surprise but it still hurt a little. No way, Draco lectured himself, he shouldn’t be hurt, it was stupid. But it happened that he wasn’t the only one to notice it.
“Why ? Is there any problem with the cat Magnolia ? Is he unbearable?” She asked, walking past him and stopping just before the gargoyle in stone.
“Harry, are … Oh sorry, I didn’t mean to interrupt.” Said a feminine voice.
“Magnolia, professor, really ?” He asked.
“Oh…” Malfoy bit his lower lip, lowing his head.
And so, here he was, laying down on his bed, staring at the ceiling, thinking about what to say Hermione the next day. But, unsurprisingly, all his thoughts were monopolized by a certain blond that was not that far away from him and it was killing him.
Harry turned his eyes and watched the cat sleeping by his side. He started petting him, hoping not waking him up, but he couldn’t resist, the light blond fur was so soft. He sighted, knowing that it was late in the night, he would be tired as hell the morning coming, but he just couldn’t sleep right now. He rolled on his side, his head being supported by his hand while the other kept petting Magnolia. Suddenly, the young cat moved and changed his position, without chasing Harry’s hand away, and fell asleep as fast as he woke up. The teenager muffled his chuckle, and kept running his fingers through the fur, until he stopped, his heart starting to race fast.
“Then I guess you can be useful and carry me to the headmistress office.”
Malfoy just purred and Harry’s heart just did a leap. He couldn’t feel more contented feeling
How did you like this chapter ? It tried my best !
“Mister Potter ? Can I do anything for you this early in the morning ?”
“Oh shut up Malfoy, you were having a nightmare, and even, there is no way you can be a burden.” Harry said back, shrugging.
Draco was whining pitifully scratching the carpet in frustration when suddenly, he felt being lifted and turned around, facing beautiful green eyes and a big smile.
It was odd to Draco to be there again, but hopefully, nothing changed in the last couple of
“No !” Parkinson exclaimed. “He won’t disappear without a word ! He won’t…” She whispered her last sentence, fidgeting his fingers on her skirt.
“I… I don’t want to remember it.” Malfoy answered in a shaky voice, hugging his body with his arms.
“No, don’t be sad, I like you a lot ! Just… I think he need you too, in a way… Do you trust me ?”
Malfoy closed his eyes, and slowly, he approached his face, and pecked Harry’s mouth with his wet nose.
Surprisingly, Magnolia didn’t sniff it. Instead, he kept looking at Harry into his eyes, with those cat eyes so grey. The more he was looking into those stormy eyes, the more he was convinced that he had already saw them, the way a hint of blue glittered when the light of the sun hit them. Malfoy, Harry thought. But no, it wasn’t possible. Malfoy wasn’t an animated, and there is no way he could have fool McGonagall.
“ Again with your cat Potter ?” Pansy snickered. “Why you don’t marry it ?”
Malfoy suddenly turned his head away, letting a sad snort out.
“Mmh ?” Harry kept kissing his neck.
“Here you are.” He said as he handed him the clothes.
“We- we should go to bed now.” Malfiy stuttered, as he got away, blushing bright.
thought the big door of the common room.
“Not a word.” Parkinson answered this time, surprisingly. “And with Mr Malfoy in Azkaban and Narcissa in France, we don’t know anything.” She blinked quickly, and inhaled a quick big breath, and turned his head.
As Potter did as he said, Draco ran to hide under the bed. He should stop, he needed to stop or all of this would finished to break his heart. How could he go back to his normal life when he will be able to turn back into human again ? After all this affection Potter gave him, it would be so hard to ignore it, and just go back to ignoring each other. More than that, he was absolutely convince that Potter would be disgusted if he ever learned who was really Magnolia. No, definitely, he needed to stop. Boosted by his new resolution, Draco made a point to avoid Potter, and it wasn’t that hard, until the night came down.
Harry made an interesting discovery
“Er-“ Potter started, passing his hand into the nest that was his hair. “I think I’m too clingy, I just want him to let him breath a bit.”
“Let’s settle in our room and take a walk outside.” Neville suggested. “I’m curious to see how they repaired Hogwarts.”
“Are you okay ? You look paler than usual.” He said as he cupped Malfoy’s face, searching for something, but all he saw was under-eye bags.
His voice startled the white cat, who jumped, looking at Harry as he flattened his ears on his skull.
“Of course not, but if you want, I can lend you some pajamas, it doesn’t seem comfy to sleep in your uniform.”
But he regretted immediately, his eyes getting wide in fear, he curled up even more, like it could protect him.
The common room was empty except for Blaise and Pansy who where talking on a corner of the room.
It was night about the end of August, as they were almost finishing the cleaning all the lingering curses from the battle, Draco couldn’t sleep. A vivid nightmare woke him up, a terrible mix of what happened and what could have happened, of the reason that made him start to learn how to be an animagus and what could have happened if he didn’t. And the rest of the night, he just stared at the ceiling, switching between human being and cat, trying to calm down and convincing himself that he was safe, well safer than possible.
“Well, it isn’t, except that he is not a cat but a blond slytherin.” Harry said.
“It’s okay now, you’re safe, I’m here.”
After all, he didn’t want to search for a new place, and he kinda appreciated the Atronomy Tower, and maybe also because McGonagall asked him to not wandered too much in the castle. So, when the evening came, and the students too, he tried his best to avoid Potter, but when the said boy squatted next to the fireplace where Draco was “hiding”, and opened his arms, the resolution flattered in a second and jumped into his arms.
“Are you ok Malfoy ?” Potter asked again.
If McGonagall was surprise, she didn’t let anything show through.
Malfoy meowed, but stayed still until Harry got up from his bed. As soon as he did it, the cat
As time went by, Harry started to believe from the deep of his heart that Magnolia wasn’t just a cat. Besides that his fur was the same color of Malfoy’s hair and his eyes the same shade of grey, Magnolia always acted quite self-consciously. He absolutely never ever give him a look when he get undressed, and stared obstinately at the wall. Even if now the white cat slept near him, close to his head or chest, he always tried to ignore him when there were others around, like he couldn’t show affection to Harry when they were not alone. He was a picky cat whenever it was related to food. And he never answered when Harry called his name, more than that, he even tried to scratch him.
After a couple of hours, Luna went back to her room and Draco welcomed her with a meow and went to rub himself against her legs.
“Pansy…” Blaise said calmly, his hand clenching slightly on her shoulder, before turning toward the now golden duo. “ May Pansy and I share the compartment with you ? All others are full.” He asked way too politely for a slytherin, Harry thought.
“Oh…” Malfoy was bright red now, and Harry couldn’t help but think that it was fully entertaining.
Of course it would Potter, Draco sulked, his head laying on his pawns and his tail waving in the here. Saint Potter, the Savior, the Greatest. What is he doing there anyway ? Isn’t he supposed to enter directly the Auror training ?
“I’m saved, I have the Savior.” Malfoy laughed darkly.
He chuckled when Malfoy mewled indignantly, and was turning away, already heading to the end of the bed as Harry had just reach the headboard. He grabbed him just in time before he was out of reach and put his on his chest.
“Well…” Draco shrugged. “ I should have just leave you alone, so I guessed that yes, I’m sorry. For everything.”
“We don’t know exactly why, but Mrs Pomffrey supposed it is because of the shock. He isn’t hurt, so maybe the moment he will feel safe enough, unconsciously, he would be able to turn back human. But as I heard, you take care of that.” She added, the corner of her smile twitched up.
“It’s okay, I’m almost finished.”
“Why are you smiling ?!”
“I’m sorry, Potter ! I must have been a burden, you should have wake me up.” He said in a cold, grimacing.
