“Good point. Let’s get these clothes off of you.”
“What?”
“For springing this on you like this. I meant to kind of lead up to it, but I was just so nervous that-”
“What if I don’t want to be in the friend zone?” he asks with a smirk and Pansy can’t believe he just fucking said that. She glares at him as she picks up her drink and downs the rest of it.
“Thank you, Healer Burlington.” Another scuffling noise, and then,
“Where were we?”
?” Hermione asks, mirroring Harry’s reaction when Draco had told him.
“Should we also, I dunno, make an announcement?” Blaise asked. “You know, with a sonorous charm or something? I think people are still fighting.”
.” Ron made a horrified face. Harry let out a breath that he did not realize he had been holding. Ron seemed almost OK with the fact that he was seeing Draco. That was unexpected.
“This,” Massi says proudly as they reach the end of one of the rows. “Is a Hand of Glory made from the hand of Lord Voldemort himself.” Draco flinches. He can’t help it. He half expects the taboo name to bring Death Eaters to their current location, and worse than that, the Dark Lord himself. Even though Draco knows he has been dead for years, he still has that visceral fear. Massi notices his discomfort.
“I don’t like tea,” Potter says, jutting his chin out slightly. “It reminds me of my family.” Draco frowns at him.
“In case you ever have to deal with muggles,” she’d said with only the smallest of sneers on her face. “It’s better you have a fountain pen than a quill.” Because no wizard such as himself would ever be caught dead with a
“I’m not nervous,” Massi repeats.
“Maybe,” says Harry’s mouth, while Harry’s body says something else entirely.
“What kind of uncultured cretin do you think I am?”
“Not even for a bit? Your mother keeps the house so cold.” He gives a fake shiver and she glares at him, but it’s a wine soaked glare, so it’s not her most effective.
“Now that we have gone through the theory of the polyjuice potion,” Professor Slughorn said on Wednesday morning. “It is time to start brewing it!” He clapped his hands together excitedly. “Professor Snape and I have taken the liberty of stewing your lacewing flies for you. So this brew will not actually take the full month to brew, merely seven days.”
“Yes, Weasley, I did,” Snape hissed. Ron ducked his head and looked at his parchment again.
“Thanks, mum,” Draco said. Narcissa smiled at him, then nodded and left the room again. Harry waited until he was sure she was out of earshot before saying anything.
“Really though,” Harry says. “It’s the twenty second. Surely you can wait until after the holidays.”
“Is this,” he starts to ask before he can think better of it. “A Black family house?”
Beside her, Ron got to his feet. Then he turned and reached down to help her up. She tripped slightly on the graveyard moss as she stood and fell into his arms. She smiled into his chest as she felt his warm arms around her.
“Makes NEWT years seem less terrible,” Blaise added, also sliding his way into the conversation. “I would like to point out that Slytherin has a better NEWT retention rate than Gryffindor.”
“Sorry,” Greg says. He stares at his feet. “But you asked.” And it seems that Greg has just been waiting for someone to talk to about it. Draco sighs.
“Five.”
“Well, I’m sorry that you have to pretend you’re dating me and not here with someone else then,” he says quietly. His eyes are downcast. Harry’s heart feels like it has fallen into his heels. But Draco has given him an out and, for the sake of their professional relationship, he takes it.
As it turned out, Draco had actually saved the main part of Harry’s present for when they went to bed as he had been too embarrassed to give it to Harry in front of everyone. Of course, since he and Harry were now the pair sleeping in Gryffindor tower, he had to come up with an excuse to get something from his dorm before they left for the night. Luckily, his toothbrush was also there, so Harry was none the wiser.
“I’ll see you at home then?”
“-That I was the same git you knew at Hogwarts?”
“True, we can make love my bed instead,” Harry whispered, leaning over and nipping Draco’s ear.
“In training.”
“You insolent wretch.” Voldemort took several steps towards him. Harry took several steps back. Voldemort snarled and raised his wand again, firing off another killing curse. Harry ducked and it hit the wall behind him, which exploded in a spray of rock and dust. He barely had time to move before Voldemort shot off another curse. This time it hit a torch and sent embers spewing down on top of Harry. One particularly large one burned a hole into his sleeve, and Harry felt the piece of cinder sear its way down his arm, leaving a stinging burn behind. Before Harry had time to react, Voldemort yelled,
“The what?” Harry asks, intrigued.
“What?” Neville asked. He had not moved, in spite of Draco’s pep talk.
“Couldn’t hurt to try,” Harry said. Snape nodded and pulled his wand out from inside his robes. Harry gulped, but Snape turned to Draco and whispered,
“The clothes. Where did they go?” Harry gestured to the bench that Draco was sitting on as if to indicate where the clothes should be.
And it was at this point that Harry became nervous again. Somehow the sight of Draco, straining at his boxers, sent a shiver of nerves through Harry. Desire too, but mostly nerves. This was really happening. He reached out slowly and put his hand over Draco’s erection.
“My wand,” Draco whispers.
“Secret tunnel,” Draco said. He looked pleased with himself. Pansy said nothing, just nodded, and followed the boys to the third floor, where they met up with Harry, Ron and Hermione. Pansy did her best to look pleased to see them all - smiling at Ron and Harry and nodding stiffly at Hermione.
“Was it not?”
“I don’t know. The incident report mentioned a small amount of mud in the house, but the Ministry Police who were called out presumed it was from her garden. What with her living on the Isle of Skye.”
He moves through the Cooler, collecting what he might need and then checks the laptop one last time. There are no new locations since the last time he had checked (fifteen minutes ago), so Harry scribbles down the ones they have on a piece of parchment and stuffs it into his pocket. Then he makes his way back up to the Parlour. As he passes McLaggen, he asks the other man to tell him if they get any other location hits.
“We broke up,” he says in a clipped tone, which makes it clear to Draco that he doesn’t want to talk about it. Pansy is sure to have heard it too, but will have fewer qualms about continuing blithely on.
“Draco, there you are.” They have walked out into the hallway and right into Harry, the other Weasley and Granger.
“He’s the Master of Death. Or something. He had all the Deathly Hallows.”
to figure out. And you did it in what? Three weeks?”
“I don’t want to talk. I've a better idea. Why don’t you just bloody kiss me already.”
“That’s not a real answer.” Draco tries to think back to all the things they talked about. He knows he bared his soul to Potter, and he regrets this now. Potter puts a hand up to his forehead and massages his temples between his thumb and middle finger.
“Professional celebrity,” he says. “I do what I want.” At this, Massi grins.
“It’s Christmas, Pans,” Cormac says. “Hermione has one of the other hit wizards dealing with her. She sent me a message and said not to worry about it today. We’ll question her after the holiday.” Pansy’s watch is upstairs in her bedroom at her mother’s request, so she imagines she has just missed the message.
“And you’ve adjusted them to work with magic?”
“Okay.”
“Hard pass.”
“I don’t know if there are any,” Hermione said after a long moment. “There are enchantments to prevent boys from getting into the girls’ dormitories, but there are no such enchantments on the boys’ dormitories. Remember last year when you tried to get something for me, Ron, and the stairs turned into a slide?” Ron nodded.
“I think it would be fun,” said Ron.
In frustration, she threw the shirt down onto the bed and went back to her wardrobe. As she rifled through her many tops, she increasingly felt as though she had nothing to wear, even though the sheer number of outfits begged otherwise.
“But you just said-“
“And what? They just let you stay in each other’s dorms now?”
“Why not?” So that is settled.
He desperately wanted to ask if the Malfoys ate this well all of the time, but figured that was probably something Pansy would already know. So instead, he kept quiet and concentrated on the food.
“Seriously?”
“Seamus?”
“We’ll sit in the back,” Harry said. Hermione pursed her lips but nodded.
“Me,” Seamus said.
“Shall we give them a show then?” Harry asks. The corner of Draco’s smirk twitches and he nods. Harry reaches out and rests his hand against the bookshelf, next to Draco’s head. Then he leans in and whispers his costume idea in Draco’s ear. He pulls back briefly to see Draco’s expression. The blond appears to be considering it at the very least, and that’s the best Harry can do for now. So he takes a step closer to Draco and leans in again, this time capturing Draco’s lips with his. He hears a small cheer from behind the bookshelf and he can’t help but smile against Draco’s mouth. He thinks he feels Draco smile as well, but he can’t be sure as he is already deepening the kiss.
“I think so,” Hermione said. They were in the Room of Requirement, chatting before the real practice began. Ron scrunched his face up and his original blackboard reappeared with a pop. He picked up a piece of chalk and crossed out numbers four and five, the cup and the diadem respectively. He wrote ‘snake’ next to the number six. Then he circled it.
Ron hefted the Sword of Gryffindor in his hands. He was going to get that snake if it killed him. He just hoped it wouldn’t come to that.
“I’m sorry,” Ron said, staring at Harry. They were sitting in the sixth year boy’s dormitory, killing time before dinner. “You spent your day practicing Occlumency?”
“I testified about this.”
“So are you saying ‘let’s go’?” Harry asked.
keep trying to get
“I think so?”
“And he mentioned you had a plan for him? If you do, it would make my life easier.” Draco says quickly, trying to throw Massi under the hippogriff as little as possible.
“Thank you, Kreacher,” Narcissa said. “Your service is as excellent as I remember it.” Kreacher bowed again and Harry could have sworn he saw him wipe away a tear as he left them. Narcissa busied herself pouring tea and handing out sweets. When Harry tried to help, she waved him away.
“Hi Terry,” Blaise said, sidling up to Terry Boot.
“I’m sorry?”
Harry and Draco catch the 7:01 Eurostar to Paris, and then get on their sleeper train about an hour after they arrive in Paris. Draco thinks they have made pretty convincing Muggles on their journey. They have dragged their trunks rather than levitating them and they have taken trains as opposed to portkeys for the entire journey. (A small part of him is a little amazed that the Muggles have managed to build a train from London to Paris in the first place. Underwater! What a concept!)
“That’s a very good question,” Harry said. “I don’t know.”
Harry says nothing, just glares at Draco for a long moment before turning away. He mutters something that sounds suspiciously like ‘you don't know me as well as you think you do,’ but Harry is facing the other direction now and Draco can't be certain he heard anything.
“Dinner’s in the oven,” Ron says. He looks at his watch. “Should be another half an hour or so. We’re having roast chicken, and before you ask, Harry, yes, it is cooked over a bed of potatoes so that the potatoes cook in the chicken fat.” Harry pumps his fist in excitement.
Harry has stopped questioning his emotions when it comes to Draco Malfoy. He knows there is no point in even trying. Draco has captured a part of his heart, whether he knows it or not, and whether Harry is ever allowed to act on it or not, and that’s that.
“Then it seems we are at an impasse.” Malfoy narrows his eyes. He reaches over and picks up his water.
“I think it’s nice,” Dumbledore said quietly.
“Elf costume?”
On the one hand, she should, because nothing good will likely come from this. But on the other? It’s been so long since she’s been with anyone. And Greg is nice, and he’s not too hard on the eyes.
“I wouldn’t say that our idea of flying your dad’s car to school was necessarily the smartest,” Harry pointed out.
They had gotten back to their hotel at around one in the morning after they had supervised as the Polizia Magica had taken both the Luczkowski and Battaglia families into custody. They had paused just long enough to peel off their clothes before they had fallen into bed and slept until the maid had knocked on the door to inquire about cleaning the room. Now they are enjoying a leisurely continental breakfast at the hotel restaurant and each other’s company.
“I do not,” Massi protests.
“He’s here.”
Harry can hardly blame Draco for worrying about packing - he is hardly sure what he should take - but at the same time he’s not worried. Anything that they don’t have, they can buy. And a trip off the grid will be perfect. They can talk about their relationship in private, without worrying who can see them, and even if anyone does, they can pretend it is to keep up their cover. Harry can’t wait.
“Quite.” They sit in silence for a while after this, all of them sipping at their drinks.
“Harry, that’s mean,” Draco said, frowning at him. The frown wasn’t overly convincing however because Draco was fighting to keep a smile off of his face. Harry grinned at him and Draco rolled his eyes before turning his attention to the beaker lacewing flies they had been allotted.
“Or, at least I don’t think so. I should check with mum.”
Since Halloween. Hermione had been missing since
And suddenly, Harry doesn’t have an appetite. He looks over at Ron, who has visibly paled. Shit. He needs to distract Hermione. Or, the person who is impersonating her.
“You’re not going to like it.”
“I bloody well hope so,” Harry said. He dropped the sword and it clattered to the floor with a dull sort of finality.
“What if,” Massi says, bucking his hips slightly into Draco’s and lifting the corner of his mouth in a smirk. “What if you dated both of us?”
“This one,” Pansy says, thrusting the job posting parchment into his hands. It is clear to her that someone in her department has fucked up and not informed Richard of his new opening. She is going to find out who that was and have some rather angry words with them. And perhaps add a laxative potion to their coffee.
Pansy stares at herself in the mirror. There are bags starting to form under her eyes. She knows she should have tried to get more sleep last night, but she had spent it tossing and turning in her bed, images of Agent Wood and the flash of his wand replaying themselves in her head. So she had gotten up early and gone back to the training room for another round with her favorite punching bag.
“I beg your pardon?” Granger asks with barely controlled rage.
“Thank you,” Blaise said. “That sounds lovely.”
“-Yes it was.” Draco bit his lip and then gave two short nods of his head.
“On the contrary,” Draco said. “We need to find that cup and send it to the Hog’s Head before one thirty.”
“May I?” she asks, reaching out to move Draco’s arms. He nods. She places his arms around Harry’s waist and has him put his head on Harry’s shoulder.
He is right. Harry’s eyes go wide as he sees the soufflé make its way through the restaurant. It has risen twice as tall as the dish it is in and the most impressive part of it is that no magic was involved in making it (that Draco knows of). It is the perfect end to a lovely meal and as they fall into bed at the end of the night, Draco holds Harry close and thinks that just maybe, everything will be alright.
It took Harry another twenty minutes to finish trying on clothes and to decide what he wanted. In that time, Draco added a hat, a scarf and a very nice looking peacoat to the pile of items that he was buying. He would show them to Harry later, once he could no longer demand to pay for them.
“Whatever,” she says. “Anything in the paper this morning?” He shakes his head. “Good. Let me know if anything comes up.” She moves a step away from him and goes back to listening to Big Dick, so Draco has nothing else to do but the same.
“Oh, just thinking back to last night,” Seamus said. He played with his chicken and mushroom pie with his fork for a moment before shoveling some into his mouth.
“Why aren’t they back yet?” McLaggen asks. “That was two days ago.”
“Do you remember now?” Draco asks. He lets the shirt go and the cloth falls back to cover the majority of the scars, but Harry can still see the shiny edge of one just below Draco’s collar. He bites his lip. This is what he had thought Draco was referring to.
“Come on,” he said. “Let’s go finish the bastard.”
“I think, uh,You-Know-Who tasked my Aunt Bellatrix with protecting it.” Harry became aware of a pounding in his ears.
“I accidentally came in my pants and I was trying to surreptitiously clean it up.” Comprehension dawned on Snape’s face.
“And Malfoy read it?” She nods.
“What?”
“I figured it was the fastest way to get you out of bed.”
The article went on to detail what shop they had visited and even included an interview with a very confused Claire who clearly hadn’t understood why two teenagers were such a big deal. The article included a picture of them taken from afar, and Harry had to admit, they did look “quite chummy”. Because of course they did, they were dating for fuck’s sake. Luckily, no doubt thanks to Hermione’s blackmailing, Skeeter hadn’t gotten close enough to hear any of their conversations or the article could have been much more sensational.
Draco feels Harry’s orgasm spasm around him and he lets himself go over the edge, coming hard into Harry. The feeling takes him over, flooding all of his senses, and he cries out.
“No shit,” Harry says.
“Well,” Susan says. “She’s in a magically induced coma, but none of my tests have shown that there’s anything wrong with her.”
He allows Potter to lead him into the sitting room, which is bigger than Draco would have thought it would be from the outside, but somehow it doesn’t feel like it has been magically extended. There is a large red sofa against one wall and Draco sits down on this. It is more plush than it looks and he sinks down into the cushions. Potter walks over to the window and lowers the blinds before opening the lid to what Draco had assumed was a side table, but appears instead to be a hidden bar.
Quick warning - there is some non-consensual stuff towards the end. (Not from our boys, of course)
“And he was okay with this?” Draco asks, amazed. “But I’m the assistant manager! I’m important.”
“Mr. Malfoy is an invaluable member of the group,” Dumbledore said. “He has been working with Mr. Potter, Miss Granger, Mr. Weasley, Miss Parkinson and Mr. Zabini on something that they are here to share with you. But first, I have an announcement to make.” There was a ripple as everyone turned to face Dumbledore. “I am dying.” Even though Dumbledore had told them this weeks ago, it still felt like a kick in the stomach to Harry. He found it hard to rationalize that this man he’d known his entire Hogwarts career was going to be gone.
And then there was a flash, and the unmistakeable sound of a camera shutter closing.
Ron shrugged. “I don't know. I think he might actually care for you, Har’. And you know it pains me to say that. This is Malfoy after all. But you didn’t see him after the incident the other day.”
I am so sorry this is two days late!
“Fair point.”
Beef, Harry thought, was something he’d had before, so he thought he knew what to expect. He was wrong. The plate had two small cubed pieces of beef and one sprig of asparagus. Harry looked up and caught Draco’s eye, confused as to why there was so little on his plate, but Draco just grinned at him. So he picked up his knife and fork and cut off a piece of one of the cubes of beef. He put it in his mouth and started chewing and dear
“Hey, you’re already the Boy-Who-Lived. I have to bring you down to the same level as us plebs whenever I can.” Harry harrumphed for a moment before smiling at Ron.
“Or someone,” Draco said. “It doesn’t have to be Harry.” He frowned as Snape fixed Harry with a stern look.
But as much as he tries to downplay it, the team remains in awe of him for the whole day. Even Greg seems impressed, though once they are alone, he admonishes Draco for not asking for his help.
The Common Room was empty, as it had been for most of the Christmas holidays, and as soon as they started to walk across it, Harry was overwhelmed with the urge to mirror what they had done in the Slytherin common room. So he turned to Draco and pressed his lips to the blond’s. If Draco figured out his motivation, he didn’t say anything, but he did allow himself to be steered backwards onto one of the sofas. It wasn’t until Harry reached for his belt buckle that Draco pulled away.
“What?”
“-Ron, she had your dick in her mouth,” Harry snapped. “She likes you. Ask her out you numpty.”
Potter had vouched for him, for reasons not known to Draco, and had been present to hear the verdict. Draco had tried his hardest to ignore Potter that day, but his eyes had sought him out at the back of the courtroom, just as they had for years in Great Hall at Hogwarts. At the announcement of Draco’s reprieve, Draco could have sworn he’d seen the corner of Potter’s mouth lift in a smile. But he hadn’t been sure. He’d looked at his mother, seen tears of relief in her eyes, and by the time he’d looked back towards Potter, the man had gone.
“That sounds about right,” Draco said. He nuzzled Harry’s ear with his nose and then nibbled Harry’s earlobe. Harry melted back into Draco’s arms.
And then the reality of the situation crashes back over Harry. He’s been aware of how much danger they have been in the entire time they have been at the Battaglia house, but he has been trying to downplay it so as not to alarm Draco. But there is a not so small chance that they will not get out of this unscathed.
“Any questions?”
He glanced down at his wrist, but was again foiled by the fact that he was not wearing a watch. It felt as though they had been sitting and eating for hours. He wasn’t overly worried about the polyjuice potion wearing off - that wouldn’t happen until after seven in the evening - but as is the way with British winters, the sun was weak and low and gave him no proper estimate of the time. He hoped that the others were suitably entertained at the Hog’s Head, waiting for them, though he was sure Ron would be worried more than anything else.
“I’m still surprised you paired them together, Saul.”
was on a top secret team with
It had only been Draco’s foot brushing against his calf that had kept him calm enough to continue the lesson after that comment. Snape was better this year, but he was still a bit of an arse.
“We’re looking for a medi-witch,” Draco interjects. There is clearly history between McLaggen and Bones, or perhaps with this Veronica person, and he doesn’t want it getting in the way of finding a medical person for Hermione.
“He could have just asked for a moment alone,” Blaise said. “It’s not like we would have minded.”
“No?”
“Well, yes,” he said to his hands.
“Try harder,” she snarls.
But then, so could he and Harry (thanks to Hermione). Suddenly, all he wanted to do was talk to Potter. He sat up and scrabbled around on his bedside table for his contact lens holder. He quickly popped the lenses into his eyes and then picked up his wand.
Draco doesn’t know where to look as her head begins to bob. He glances over at Harry, but Harry is still looking at Massi as if nothing wrong were afoot. Massi stretches his arms up and puts his hands behind his head, a shit-eating grin stretched across his mouth.
“Why Fred and George never thought of this,” Ron muttered as he pulled bottle after bottle out of the bag and placed it on one of the tables that were scattered around the Chamber.
“That mark on your arm says differently.”
tried to kill me,” Harry says. He reaches out and takes Draco’s hand as they walk. For appearances sake, of course.
“You murdered someone?”
If the teachers noticed half of the students becoming more and more boisterous as the evening went on, none of them said anything. In fact, Professor McGonagall even summoned a house elf part way through the first course and requested wine for the teachers.
Draco has never seen this suave side of Harry before. He had never needed to seduce Draco - Draco had been more than willing to drop trou without it. Now he half wishes he’d played a little harder to get.
“Who wants to go first?” he asks. Draco takes a deep breath.
“Uh,” Ron said. Now that he and Pansy were alone in the entrance hall, his courage had dried up.
“Oh, we’ve already seen his parents.”
“-Can you stop saying his name?” Draco snapped.
“Isle of Skye.”
“I don’t think you’ve ever said that to me,” Harry says. He claps a hand to his chest as though touched.
“No,” Harry says again, this time more fiercely. And then the brunet’s arms are around him and Harry is clutching him close. Draco stiffens for a moment and Harry hugs him tighter. Reluctantly, Draco relaxes into Harry’s arms. He rests his head on Harry’s shoulder and all the confusion about their relationship washes over him all at once. Because Harry is holding him and whispering nice things in his ear about how he’s no longer the self absorbed arsehole he was in school and he thinks it’s real but he’s not sure.
“Traitor,” Harry said.
Harry.
“Claudia,” Draco said, not looking up from the piece of toast he was now buttering.
“No,” he said firmly.
“Sorry,” Draco says.
“Relax,” Harry mutters, but somehow that makes it worse. Draco’s shoulders are tensed up by his ears now and he can’t remember how they got there. His grip on Harry is tight and Harry wiggles in his arms. Gillian starts to move towards them, but Harry turns in Draco’s arms, ignoring her. He reaches up and puts a hand on Draco’s cheek.
“It’s just following a recipe.”
“Just watch,” Harry says.
“Is it dancing you want to do?” he asked, leaning in close. “Or something else?”
“Yeah, last time we were actually fucking.”
“So, what’s the plan,” Luca asks.
“Because,” Harry said. Then he stopped talking and frowned. “Because you can’t.”
“It’s good. I like it. Keep going.” Massi is breathless, his voice husky. Draco ups the tempo. He can feel himself getting close, but he won’t let himself go over the edge until Massi has. He begins to work through long multiplication sums in his head - the math taking his mind off of the rising pleasure for a moment. It is one of the reasons he prefers to be on top. He likes to make sure his partner finishes first, and it’s something he’s good at doing.
“Oh.” McLaggen sounds rather put out.
“What was last night?” It was not the question that Seamus had expected. He blinked for a moment.
“That’s an understatement.” He moved towards their desk and peered down at his notes. Harry sat immobilized on the sofa, still clutching the pillow over his lap. When it appeared as though Draco had forgotten he was there, Harry gave a small cough. Draco looked over at him.
“Parkinson.” Pansy groans and turns away from the punching bag she had been hitting.
“Don’t call me that,” he says. “Please just call me Greg.”
Harry wanted privacy. How could he not have thought about that? It was far too early in their budding relationship for Harry to feel comfortable undressing in front of him. Or, at least in a situation where Draco himself was not also undressing.
“Fair point, Draco,” Blaise said. “Do we have any mixers?” Draco scrunched up his face. “Also glassware?”
“Would you call this going out?” Harry asked. Draco frowned at him.
“And quite frankly what?” Draco prompts.
He thinks he hears Massi yell his name in a terrified voice, but he can’t be sure. There is a lot of screaming.
It is another win for Draco, and a pretty big one at that. This is most definitely a conviction that they wouldn't have been able to get without the help of Draco and the Reliquary.
“Pub?” McLaggen asks as the door to the Granger-Weasley house shuts behind them.
“Of course,” she said. Her expression softened back into one of quiet amusement.
“Yes.”
“I’m not feeling sorry for myself anymore,” Harry said. He stroked the back of Draco’s hand idly with his thumb. “You’re here. And we’re not arguing.”
?” Daisy asks, leaning forward to look at Pansy around Great Aunt Bertie.
“I stopped by the shop today to ask Ron for Christmas present ideas and we got into a friendly argument.”
“All I have done is sit here and be open and willing to listen to you. I hardly see how you could call that coercion.” She reached out and smoothed down a lock of his hair. “I take it Potter is your boyfriend then?” This was all going too fast.
“Would you prefer if we didn’t make out so much?”
“Hello, Ron,” George said. He reached over and tussled his brother’s hair. Ron scowled and flattened it back down.
“Oh fuck.”
“I helped,” Draco piped up.
“Fine.” Harry put down his drink and stood up somewhat gracelessly.
“Yes,” she says. “I wanted that whisky.”
“I’m sorry,” Draco says.
, a teenager, must be the one who defeats him. Talk about pressure.”
“Would it help if I said that the only reason I even tried to sleep with Blaise was because I couldn’t stop thinking about that kiss on Friday and how much I wanted it to happen again?”
“But—“
They did it. They found Hermione before Christmas and though crime never takes a break, Harry thinks he can reasonably expect to have the next few days to relax and enjoy the holiday. He is nervous about lunch with Draco’s parents, but so long as he is with Draco, he feels like he can handle anything.
“The master called?” Kreacher croaks.
“Solved what?” Draco snapped. He was irritated because he had been distracted partway through the arithmancy equation he was trying to work through. It was difficult and fiddly and this was the fourth time he had attempted to check through it.
“Really.” Harry reaches out and squeezes Draco’s shoulder and Draco feels his worries dissipate.
“Ah,” Massi replies. “You two fuck enough that you don’t need this. I get it.” He sighs and closes his eyes. “I used to have that, but she left me.”
The client he’s meeting with today is a wizard, however. A new client: Mr. Herbert Pike. They’ve had several letters’ worth of correspondence thus far and the briefcase on the passenger seat next to Draco is filled with Pike’s words and Draco’s subsequent notes.
“Look,” McLaggen says. “Can we discuss this after lunch?” Pansy purses her lips.
“Kind of.”
“And that way you can come up with the incredibly subtle question for me,” Ron says, smirking at Harry. Harry rolls his eyes but agrees. Because really, what else can he do?
“What
“That’s my lad,” Big Dick says, clapping him on the shoulder. Draco forces a smile, then nods at Big Dick and walks away. He meets Greg in the locker room and scowls as he changes into his running clothes. If today isn’t the start of his weekend, he might as well go for a run before heading home.
“Well,” he said. “I guess we have our work cut out for us.”
“Expecto patronum,” she said after a moment’s thought. A silvery otter shot out of her wand and swam around in the air. Blaise’s face lit up in delight. He reached out a hand to touch it and it swam up and nuzzled it. Hermione blushed but looked pleased with herself nonetheless.
“Blood splatter seemed inconsistent.”
“Oh no,” Harry says. He cups his face in his hands. “I do hope you don’t have to punish me.” Draco’s smirk, if anything, grows wider. Then he turns serious for a moment.
“Shall we?” he asks. His tone is the opposite of how Draco feels, bright and carefree, and not like he is potentially leading Draco to be interrogated and locked up.
“So you’re going to stick plastic on my face?” Draco asks.
“What is it?” And Draco didn’t know what to say, so he just shook his head.
“Don't worry,” she said. “People always seem to ask questions as soon as you can't answer them. Honestly, I think some waiters do it on purpose so that all you can say when they ask ‘How is the meal?’, is,” she paused and covered her mouth. “Mmm, great.” Blaise burst out laughing.
“Whose party is it?” Joe asks. Draco mimes zipping up his lips and shakes his head.
“What was my idea?” Ron asked. He had been across the room talking with Dean and Seamus when he had spotted the doughnuts and had made a beeline for them. He had most certainly not been keenly aware of the bar area for reasons of ‘Pansy Parkinson was still bartending’. What would make anyone think that?
“Who wants to destroy the diadem?” Harry asked, putting his arm around Draco’s shoulder. Draco slumped sideways into him and Harry steered him to a chair. Then, as no one made a move to destroy the diadem, Harry walked back into the middle of the room and picked up the sword.
“Oliver Wood was one of your agents,
But now it was the start of the summer holidays and with Voldemort gone, Harry was at a loss for what he was going to do with himself. He had no obligation to go back to the Durlsey’s now that no longer needed the protection that had come from living with them, and so he had decided he would never set foot in that house again. Which meant he didn’t quite know where he would live.
“What N.E.W.T.s would I need?” he asks out of curiosity. Having never gone back to Hogwarts after the second Wizarding War, Draco has no N.E.W.T.s. It is something his parents have always been disappointed about.
“Is there?” he asks.
“It’s an idea,” Harry says slowly. He doesn’t want to commit to anything before they’ve had a chance to run things past Hermione. He knows they’ve worked well on this on their own up until now, but he would feel much more comfortable with her input.
“He is not ‘
“You what?”
“And the wizarding world’s gone into a mandatory lockdown, as of,” Potter checks his wristwatch. “Twenty minutes ago.”
Later that evening, once Massi is passed out in a post coital daze, Harry pulls out his wand and performs a quick, silent
“Hang on,” George said, leaning forward so that he could look both Harry and Draco in the face. “Are you two,” he trailed off, his voice rising with inflection as he waggled his eyebrows at them. Draco stared cooly back, even as Harry grinned beside him. “Holy shit, you are, aren’t you?”
“Justin,” he said. “There you are. I’ve been looking all over for you.” The door swung closed behind him and Justin saw that he was alone.
“You’re right,” he said. “It was.”
Which is how they convince Cormac McLaggen to do a naked lap of the (empty) Leaky Cauldron in the wee hours of Christmas morning. Draco thinks it might be the best Christmas he’s ever had.
Leaving the store, Draco expects to turn right and is therefore surprised when Harry leads them the other way. A frown crosses his face while he tries to determine where they are going, but he soon figures it out when Harry stops outside of the newly refurbished Florean Fortescue’s Ice Cream Parlor.
“Of course, Pansy,”Narcissa replied. “I’m glad you’re enjoying it.”
“You didn’t tell him anything, did you?”
“Harry, we don’t actually know for sure that she’s been kidnapped,” Hermione says. But then her watch flashes purple and she looks down at it. Harry watches as she reads the message. He tilts his head to the side, quizzically. After a long moment she looks back up at him. “She has been kidnapped.”
“Um, I’m going to pass the phone to someone who can help you with the address,” Draco says.
“Sometimes, I think you’re a bit too on edge,” Draco says.“You need to switch off sometimes.” Harry gives him a rueful smile, which he drops as Draco leans in and kisses him.
“No, that’s different.”
“So you know what the fuck I can do to you then?”
“We should probably finish these and go.” She indicates their half empty glasses.
“Really Albus?” McGonagall asked. “You
“No, if you think something is wrong in your gut, I’m going to trust that,” she says.
.” Then she crossed her legs and rested one hand on her knee and proceeded to ignore them until Draco finally walked into the common room.
“—Yes, you did.”
Special Agents Spaniel, Conan and Belle
“Not being able to kiss you right now,” Harry said quietly. He was aware that there were other people around. It was precisely why he couldn’t be any more intimate with Draco other than sitting next to him. True, his knee was touching Draco’s thigh, and the contact was nice, but he wanted more than that.
“Yeah, and if they knew about it, I’m sure they’d try to find a way to take it from me.”
“He did,” Harry said. “And anyway, I’ve seen them in action.”
“So these bluebell flames,” Harry says, ignoring Draco. “She would conjure them to keep us warm, which is what I did tonight, because it was bloody freezing waiting for you two to be done in that house. Only Hermione asked where it had come from. I reminded her that she had taught me and she laughed and said she’d forgotten about it.”
“That’s not true,” Harry protests.
“We decided it would be better if one of us were the Reliquary so that we could prevent it from falling into the Simurgh Society’s hands.”
“Side-along?” Massi asks once they reach the foyer of the theater.
“It looks like a closet.”
The house is impressive and nicely designed, but it isn't until they get to the master bedroom that Draco gets truly envious.
“Let me let you in on a secret,” Draco said. He pulled back his sleeve and revealed his wand which he had hidden there. “You’re a wizard, Harry.”
“And you get to date me anyway?”
would hopefully distract him from thoughts of a certain blond Slytherin.
“Generally, with, uh,” he paused here and gnawed at his lower lip for a moment before taking a deep breath and continuing. “Generally with He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, I concentrate on how excited I am to be serving him. Or, how in awe of his power I am. Because he’s rather easily flattered. I mean, he’s an autocrat - or he wants to be.”
“Je t’aime aussi,” Draco replies.
He is glad that he was not in the office when he heard about Oliver’s death. He is not sure how well he would have held his emotions in check. He is, of course, trained to keep himself calm under pressure, but he is only human and this news hurts a lot.
“But you have the best poker face of anyone I know.”
“Interesting.”
“Ok, team,” Richard begins. “Do you know what day it is?” Emma yawns again and doesn't bother to try to hide it. Greg shrugs.
“I am old, Miss Granger,” Dumbledore said. “And when you get to my age, if one has a well organized mind, death is but the next great adventure. I’ve made my peace with this.” Harry was quite sure he’d heard Dumbledore say something similar before, but he wasn’t entirely sure when.
“And you busted us in this very room?”
“Not yet,” Draco said. “I think we should drink Blaise under the table first.”
“Why don’t we sit there?” she asked, pointing to a small loveseat nestled in the corner of the patio. It was lit only by the light of the fire pit before it, leaving it much darker than any of the other seating areas.
“Of course. I just thought you’d said you were into women.” An amused smile plays across Harry’s lips. Draco is amazed at how at ease he looks. But then, Harry’s had training for this. And he doesn’t know what Draco knows. Unfortunately, Draco can’t bring him up to speed until he gets Harry alone and for that, it seems that Massi will need to be asleep. Perhaps in a post coital haze.
“You’re really trying to take away my fun, aren’t you?” Harry asks, putting his arms back down. A brief smirk crosses Draco’s face before he recomposes his features.
“Shreeky has taken the liberty of packing Master Draco some clothes. Healer Burlington says that elves is not going to get sick, so you is not worrying about Mistress Narcissa. We will be taking very good care of her.”
“I dunno,” Harry said. “I think I could pull off blond though.”
“I hadn’t thought of that.”
“Good,” she says again. She closes her eyes again and leans against Ron’s shoulder for a moment before she straightens up. She takes a deep breath and takes Ron’s hand in hers. “Right then. Which one of you is going to bring me up to speed on what’s been going on?”
“Of course.” He nods once. “Before we go, I want to go through the rest of this.” He gestures to the papers spread across the table. Pansy puts the map to the side and pulls over another paper and discovers it is a full file. She flips through the pages and her eyes flick across the words there. It is the report from the night Harry and Draco were taken in for questioning. Unbidden, the words from Draco’s interview jump out at her.
“What makes you so sure?”
The pile is comprised of: Gryffindor tracksuit bottoms, a Gryffindor quidditch warm up shirt (replete with a yellow Potter stitched on the back), some red, flannel pajamas with little, golden roaring lions stitched into them, and a crimson jumper with a golden H on the front that is very obviously homemade. Draco sighs and shrugs out of his jacket.
Unbidden, a memory washes over her. Not long before the Battle of Hogwarts, she had been up late in the common room studying for a Charms exam the following day, when Greg and Vince had come in, chuckling and nudging each other. At first she had thought nothing of it, but it quickly became clear that they hadn't noticed her. Vince had lifted up his sleeve and pointed at something on his arm. Pansy had been unable to see what as Greg had been standing in her line of sight.
“Do you think the cup is still there?” Hermione asked, breaking the tension. “At your house, I mean.”
“Well, thank you.”
“Why wouldn’t I?” Ron shrugged.
“Dunno. Out.”
“Hi,” she says. “How’d you sleep?” Is it his imagination, or is there a small smirk on her face? He decides to act as if there isn't.
“Thank you,” Draco says. He pushes himself to his feet. “That would be most appreciated.”
“Fuck.”
“Do they wear name tags on the show?” he asked. Now it was Ron’s turn to frown.
And so it went.
“They don’t care. They think wizards are freaks.”
“Oh dear god,” Draco says. “No.”
“Never mind,” he says. “It’s not important. You were telling me about your time at the Leaky Cauldron.” He gestures for Draco to continue.
“Dinner for breakfast is a tad strange, but if that’s what you want…” Draco smirks at the look Potter is giving him.
“The Lady Galadriel welcomes you,” Hannah says, gesturing for them to enter. Once they are inside, she breaks character and greets Pansy warmly. Pansy smiles and follows her down the corridor while she chatters on about Greg and Draco. Pansy has of course seen Hannah at the Leaky Cauldron with the pair of them, but she never stays as late as Potter, so she still feels slightly awkward. She had been a bitch to Hannah during Hogwarts, but if Hannah had been offended by her, she has never shown it.
“I’m think that might, in fact, make it worse,” he said. “Don’t you?”
“Well, tough shit, Harry. Because I
Harry spat back. “But it sure as hell wasn’t this.” And with that, he fled the booth.
“So? He’s a house elf.”
“And you have one for each floor?” Draco watches as Potter walks over to the kettle and fills it.
“You what?”
been work.
He realizes that he has dawdled too long by the wine and walks back over to the living room area. He hands Malfoy his refilled glass.
“And you believe them?” she asks Pansy.
“So you don’t
“Mr. Potter,” she says. She walks over to him and extends her hand. “How nice to see you.” Potter returns the handshake warmly, clasping his mother’s hand in both of his. Narcissa turns back to Draco.
“I want to protect you.”
Granted, it can’t have been easy for him to have spent his entire school career both in the closet
“Nah,” Draco said. “Just the first half hour or so. Then I think a house elf is coming to take over?” He looked at Pansy for confirmation and she nodded.
“I see you haven’t necessarily aligned on ideology then.” Snape watched as Harry and Draco exchanged concerned glances.
“Well,” Hermione said once that was settled. “I guess we had better work on our homework now then.” Ron’s face fell.
“Also yes. But in all fairness, I
“Then let’s fight for it.”
“That’s not fair.”
“Oh, don’t you fucking Brokeback Mountain me, Potter,” Draco snaps. “Even if we
As they walk back from lunch, Massi takes Draco’s hand. Draco finds it strange that Massi touches him all the time. It is nice to have the attention, sure, but Massi seems to go out of his way to be physically affectionate with Draco, especially when Harry is watching. Draco assumes it is to make Harry jealous, and he is glad that Harry is keeping his emotions in check. He has clearly learned a lot since Hogwarts.
“Take that back.” Draco’s nostrils flared as he glared at Harry.
“Don’t worry about it. I’ll fix it.” Big Dick goes from looking like he is about to cry out of sadness to looking like he is about to cry out of joy.
“We could try being friends though,” he suggests after a while.
“Someone else will undoubtedly try to finish the job,” Dumbledore said. Draco noticed that he didn’t say they would succeed.
The door swings open and Pansy is greeted by a vision in white. The figure seems to have its own light source and Pansy puts a hand up in front of her eyes in an attempt to block it. The light fades and Pansy recognizes Hannah, in spite of the waist-length blond hair and still faintly glowing white dress.
“I don’t follow,” Malfoy says.
“But you said,” Draco starts to say but Pansy kicks him. He turns his head to glare at her and stops when he sees the look in her eyes. “Nevermind.” He will ask her about that later.
“Of course,” he says. “Anything for Master Malfoy.” Harry sighs. But at least it’s progress. Now if only he could get that picture of Bellatrix out from Kreacher’s lair. Perhaps he can talk to Draco about that.
“And because he’s in love with you,” he says.
“I’m dating Harry Sodding Potter,” Draco says. “Our relationship is highly public. I had to tell them before they saw it in the papers and disowned me.”
“Yes, quite,” Professor McGonagall said. She glanced at Dumbledore who inclined his head. “As you are here, please enjoy some breakfast. I’ll come and collect you when we’re ready for you.”
“I don’t think I can eat anything,” Hermione said at breakfast on Wednesday. She looked faintly green. Harry was nervous too, but he was gamely forcing down some toast. Ron, as always, had covered his plate with sausages, beans and toast and was wolfing them down.
“So you fucking prepared for him to die? Like fattening a lamb for the slaughter?” Draco was suddenly so angry that he could hear the blood rushing in his ears, even though he wasn’t even sure if he had physical body on this plane.
“Are the others there?”
“So you’re saying that the group must have hired a medi-wizard to do this?” Harry asks.
“Don’t be.” Harry’s tone is fierce. He wraps his other arm around Draco’s waist, encircling him all the way. Draco leans into Harry and presses their foreheads together. “It’s not your fault,” Harry says.
“What? That’s a thing? That could happen?”
“We have some unexpected news,” she says, her eyes bright. Ron squeezes her close. Harry wonders if Ron will ever feel like he can let her out of his sight again.
“Presents?” Draco asked, his eyes alight with excitement.
As the minutes tick by, Draco becomes more and more nervous. Who is this Amelia person that they’re waiting on? He gnaws distractedly on a hangnail on his thumb before he realizes what he is doing and drops his hand back into his lap.
“Also I’m pretty sure that He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named would be rather pissed that you’ve gone and started dating his worst enemy and would put you at the top of his shit list and I wouldn’t want to risk your safety like that.”
“Ta da,” Harry said as he and Ron emerged from the bathroom in their costumes. If he said so himself, they were rather perfect. But really all credit went to Ron on that, as it had been his idea.
“Did you know she used to be human?” Harry asked.
“Well, go change then,” Ron said. “Show us what you bought.”
“Anything we find up there won’t be in the Reliquary,” Hermione says. “It would be too recent.” Harry isn’t sure she’s right, but he’s not in the mood to argue, so he takes her arm and they apparate together up to the Isle of Skye.
“Top Hats,” Malfoy says without hesitation. “I’ve been dreaming about them since I was last here.” Harry smiles.
“Thank you. Now please continue this delightful fashion show.” Harry rolled his eyes, but began to pull the most recent shirt off over his head. He put it on top of the pile that Draco was now holding and then turned away. Draco let the door to the fitting room swing closed behind him. Then he hurried over to where Claire was hovering at the end of the corridor and handed her pile.
A house elf appears and cuts the cake quickly before passing it out and disappearing again. Harry digs into his cake with gusto. While everything in the meal has been delicious, this might be his favorite thing. The richness of the chocolate cake is complemented by the the whipped cream and cut by the tartness of the cherries. He savors it, just as he’s savoring this entire afternoon, and when he sits back to look around the room once he’s finished eating, he feels nothing but contentment.
“I thought you knew.”
“I think it’s nice,” said Neville.
“I checked in on the cell before I came here,” McLaggen says. “No change.”
“Scooping ice cream?” McLaggen asks.
“What? Of course not.” Harry raised his eyebrows. “I don’t need to talk you into that. I just have to say ‘let’s go’, and you’ll follow me up to the Gryffindor dorms. I’m assuming that’s where we’ll be sleeping?”
“That’s unfortunate,” Seamus said. “I’m sorry to hear that.” Harry said nothing, but continued his fierce masticating.
“-And anyway, didn’t you start Dumbledore’s Army last year? Isn’t that kind of the same thing?” Ron asked, cutting him off.
“I would have to recreate it,” Hermione stammered. “But I have the basics down. I’m sure I could do it again.”
“Not bloody likely,” Pansy muttered back. “He wasn’t even wearing them. My bet is they’ve been in his pockets the entire time.”
“Civilians.”
“I’m not sure where to start.”
“This is wicked,” Blaise said once they were all down at the bottom of the pipe.
“Uh,” Harry said.
“What?” McLaggen splutters. “Why not let me impersonate Hermione?”
He’d gotten off the train at King’s Cross - somehow - though he’s still not entirely sure how as he had been jinxed by several of Harry’s friends just moments before the train had arrived - and his mother had taken one look at him, pursed her lips and bundled him into the back of the car she had hired to take them home. It had been his last moment of reprieve for the entire summer.
“Dumbledore probably cleared us,” Ron said.
“It’s certainly not what I would want,” Harry said.
“But this isn’t about me right now,” Draco says. “You're the one who is upset. I should be comforting you, not the other way around.”
“We could be,” Draco said. “I mean, we’re sneaking around and being all secretive.” Harry frowned at him. “OK, so we’re not spies, and perhaps we’re not really sneaking anywhere.” He paused and then said, “Oh, Potter, you ruin everything.” Harry shrugged.
“This isn’t potions,” Draco points out. “It’s not magic.”
“I know,” Harry replies. “But we’re undercover and this isn’t our jurisdiction anyway.”
During the afternoon, they played a rousing game of exploding snap and even included some of the other Gryffindors who had stayed for Christmas, namely the Creevey brothers. (Colin took this as tacit acknowledgement that he was now “cool” and Dennis spent most of the game flinching whenever any one of the Slytherins moved.) And before they knew it, it was dinner time.
Cormac has never used a washing machine before. Why would he have any cause to? He’s a wizard. He just waves his wand at a bucket of soapy water and then hangs everything up to dry. Or, when he’s feeling particularly lazy, he sends it home for his parents’ house elf to clean. (If he’s being honest, he does that more often than not.)
“Yes,” Ron said. “Neville mentioned that. But do you generally apologize to someone for three hours?”
“-The war?”
“Fine. But no one wants to talk about work, Harry. I want to hear about you two.” He gestures between Harry and Draco. “When Hermione told me you were together, I didn’t believe her until she showed me the Witch Weekly cover and then it was hard
“And speaking of that,” Harry says. “You should probably call me Harry.”
“Unless you don’t want to?” she asked, sounding confused.
“Well, be that as it may, who you date is none of my business. I’m just upset that you didn’t tell me about it. I mean, I had to find out from
“Yes, but she’s my mother.” They stopped outside of the door to the sixth year boys’ dorm. “Ready?” Harry nodded and Draco pushed open the door.
“On Pansy and?” she prompted. Blaise ground his teeth for a moment, then puffed up his cheeks and blew out a breath.
“I’m not being daft. Being down in that Chamber just reminded me that you went in there when you were fucking twelve, with no concern for your own safety, and saved the smallest Weasley. I would never have done that.”
,” Blaise said. He pulled it out of his bag and placed it on the table. Hermione laughed and placed her own copy on the table.
“No need to rub it in.”
“So you’ll bring it up then?” McLaggen asks.
“Of course,” Harry says. “It’s probably best if I do that either way as the hotel room is in my name.” It is not, but it’s a convenient lie.
“Let’s see what Big Dick says.” Because he suspects that actually Big Dick might think it looks good. Indeed, several people have walked into the store since he took Jamie aside and are now looking at the tower of books appreciatively. He spots Harry among the onlookers and sidles over to him.
“For now at least.”
“Then why didn’t you bring him in?” Harry asks. He is very curious as to why she hasn’t - cries as to why she wanted them to bring Malfoy in together.
“What’s wrong, mate?” Harry shook his head. He didn’t want to talk to Ron about his fight with Malfoy. He didn’t want to talk to
“Deal.” The grin on Harry’s face is positively filthy. What has Draco gotten himself into? He doesn't have time to find out, because at that point, Greg comes back, precariously carrying three pints and Draco jumps up to help him.
“Fine,” he says. “Tell me what’s been going on.”
“Tail her.” Harry frowns, thinking.
“Because of the flames.”
“Oh, you did, did you?”
“Shh,” he intones. Draco thinks this is unnecessary as the music is so loud he doubts anyone could hear them. Harry moves his hand swiftly southward and in a few seconds he has Draco’s belt buckle undone.
“What are you getting at?”
“Yes, that’s exactly right.”
He buries his face in his hands, ashamed even now.
“Oh yes,” Pansy says. “Bertie’s already working on our costumes, so there’s no changing them now.” Harry grumbles to himself but doesn’t protest. “Christmas is a Thursday this year, so I think we should go in this Friday. Draco, I’ve already secured your afternoon off with Big Dick, so you needn’t worry about that.”
Recognizing Wood from school, he had invited him into the new VIP room that he had created and which he had been trying to convince Hannah was a good idea. Wood had been grateful to escape the adoring (annoying) public and had asked
But then Harry throws his trousers to the side and lowers himself back over Draco. He hovers above him for a moment, teasing, before his lips meet Draco’s again so hard that Draco is afraid they will bruise. But he doesn't mind. He has wanted to do this for months. But now is not the time to dwell on his agonizing over Harry Potter. Now is the time to run his hands down Harry Potter’s perfect back to then rest them on Harry Potter’s perfect naked arse.
“How?” she asks. “You were on the team that tried to stop Wood.”
“Why do you hate me so much?”
“I know. I can’t tell you how terrible I feel.” He pauses, tilting his head to the side. “Is there any way I can make it up to you? Or to show you how much I like you?”
Draco concentrates on his breathing because it is all he can do. He feels so naked without his wand, but he knows that he wouldn’t be nearly as effective as Harry in this situation. At least no one can see him. And, of course, no one can see Harry.
“Yes. I practically live with him.”
“Oh,” Potter says. “Right. That’s Walburga. She was Sirius’s mother. She’s a painting.” He scrunches his face up in a grimace. “I forgot you hadn’t met her yet.” Draco strains to make out the words that the woman is yelling.
“They’re
“Avada—“
“Well, he reads the Prophet. The others don’t. I just make him think that my sister, Daisy, is the Hit Wizard, not me.”
“I love you.”
“Thank you,” he said. “But there’s no need to apologize.” Narcissa gave a tiny shrug as if to say that there was, but that she wouldn’t push it.
“Professor Dumbledore would like to see you in his office,” Snape said. “As soon as possible.” Here, he looked at Draco again.
He mentally kicks himself. He needs to stop overthinking this. He spends time with Potter all the time. This won’t be any different.
“If it’s all the same,” Susan says. “I would prefer if you ate something first.” She is wringing her hands together in front of her, clearly uncomfortable with the situation.
“How do I watch it?” Harry pushes Draco off of his chest, and then sits up straighter. He looks around for a long moment, sweeping his gaze around the park.
“What this idiot
“-Sim Soc,” Draco interjects.
“The spell, Ron,” Harry said. “You know we all stood in a big circle and you were there for moral support?”
Though Christmas at the Burrow is in fact a thing that is happening and Harry is both excited and terrified. They’re going to lunch at Malfoy Manor - another terrifying prospect - and then staying Christmas night at the Burrow. He’s not sure where they’re going to sleep or what Draco will say about whatever room they’re sleeping in, but the prospect of Christmas with all of Harry’s chosen family is a thrilling prospect.
“Good.”
“Interesting. That
“Shit,” said Blaise.
“Surely that means you would want it more?”
“Uh.” Ron was dumbfounded. He blinked at her, unable to form words.
“Never said I was.” She shifted to her side again, but kept her expression guarded. “Do
He committed the shape to memory, so that he could explain it to the others later, and then climbed down from the chair. For good measure, he pulled some parchment out of his bag and drew a quick sketch.
“No!” Colin squeaked. “I wouldn’t do that to Harry.”
“So bloody use a cooling charm on it,” Harry snaps.
“I'm going to give that one a hard pass, Shame,” Ron said.
“And getting over them.”
“You know what this means, right?” Harry says. Draco shakes his head. “We have to either kill or arrest all of them.” Draco’s mouth falls open, but he snaps it shut and nods.
“And it’s also rather important to me that it doesn’t happen,” Draco snapped.
“Oh?”
“No, you dick. But I have a brain and I’m better at our job than you are.”
“Where should I put this?” Harry asks as they walk in. He gesticulates at the bags. Massi shrugs.
“Oh, that got your attention, did it? Now will you take me seriously?”
“Right-o, boss,” Greg says. He salutes. Draco rolls his eyes at him. Greg has come a long way since Hogwarts, but his impulse to follow orders from the most important person around him has been harder to shake. Draco reaches up and put his arm around Greg’s shoulder. It is a difficult feat as Greg is a good six inches taller than Draco.
“Si, go on.”
“I don’t know.” He put his back to the wall and slid down it until he was sitting with his knees up in front of himself. Harry slid down next to him. “I’m just so tired of the charade. I want people to know you’re mine.”
“What?” Draco cried, turning around. Ron nodded.
“I’m not made of glass,” Hermione shoots back.
“Kanpai,” Pansy said.
“She’s right,” Blaise said. “And I have an idea.” They all stared at Blaise but he did not say any more, only screwed up his face in concentration. Nothing happened for a long moment, and then there was a slight creaking noise, and then a
‘I was just leaving,’ Weasley replied stiffly.
The blonde paused, eyes darkening for a second before answering.
Harry looked up.  The flames on the floating candles were getting bigger and bigger, melting the candles and making the hall uncomfortably warm. The other first years were starting to sweat and pull off their scarves, looking around for the source of the heat.
He frowned when Harry didn’t answer right away. He didn’t see Harry’s hands signing in the dimly lit compartment. Sunlight lit up the compartment as the train exited the tunnel. The red-head’s eyes widened when he got a proper look at Harry’s face. Harry saw the moment the boy recoiled in disgust and scrambled out of his seat.
Draco’s eyes widened and he blushed, the colour immediately spreading over his pale skin. Harry barely noticed in his shock. He couldn’t remember the last time anyone had looked at him and seen anything other than the hideous scar marring his face. His lips stretched into a smile, feeling like a weight he didn’t even know had been there had been lifted off his back.
‘Harry!’ A low hiss broke him out of his reverie. He looked at Draco questioningly. Draco pointed up.
'Packed with muggles, of course. It's the same every year.'
“Malfoy, Draco!”
Weasley flushed a bright red to match his hair. ‘That’s none of your bloody business, Malfoy,’ he muttered before scurrying away, rubbing furiously at his nose.
‘Do you want to be friends?’
Harry signed. Draco looked even more puzzled.
Wide emerald eyes met his at the moment his face fell in disappointment. He looked down quickly, trying to hide the way his heart was sinking. It wouldn’t do for Harry to think he thought Hufflepuff was worse in any way. It wasn’t. It was just – in all his excitement at making a new friend, he had assumed they’d be in the same house. It hadn’t crossed his mind that Harry could be sorted into another house. Schooling his face into a disinterested mask, he looked up again at the dais. Harry was long gone. He tried to find the boy at the Hufflepuff table, but he was lost in a sea of yellow and black.
‘Bloody hell, mate! I didn’t see you there. S’okay if I sit here?’
Draco rocked back on forth on his heels, trying his best to hide his nerves as Professor McGonagall got closer to the M’s. What if the hat didn’t put him in Slytherin? His father’s cool disapproving face swam before his eyes. He shook his head, hard. No. Malfoys didn’t show fear. Even so, he reached out and grabbed Harry’s hand, telling himself that it was to calm the smaller boy. To be perfectly honest, the smaller boy didn’t look he was doing so well either. If his own shaking stopped at the feeling of another warm hand in his own, no one had to know.
Draco smirked and turned to face Harry again, waiting for an answer. Harry was still curled in on himself. When he didn’t show signs of responding any time soon, Draco reached out and tapped him on the shoulder lightly. Harry flinched back a little and looked up at Draco in surprise, uncurling a little.
‘Did you just tell me to kiss my mother?,’ he said, hands signing along with his words. Harry’s mouth fell open in shock.
Harry didn’t see anything wrong with that. He nodded. Draco’s face split into a grin. He held out his hand, pinky finger extended.
Draco rolled his eyes and whirled around to face the other boy, moving unconsciously to shield the smaller boy from the red-head’s view. ‘Did you know you have dirt on your nose, Weasley? Right there.’
Harry shrugged. He didn’t see what the big deal was. He had been reading books with light from his palms all summer. How else was he supposed to read them under the covers when his uncle locked his wand away?
‘Hullo, the name’s Draco. Draco Malfoy. Is this seat free?’ he asked Harry, looking him in the eyes, gaze unwavering.
'You lost, kid? Let's find your parents,' the officer tried again. He looked slightly uncomfortable, clearly trying not to look Harry directly in the eyes.
He squeezed Harry’s hand before letting go and striding off to the stool, shoulders straight and proud. McGonagall gave him a tight-lipped smile before placing the hat on his head.
His eyes widened behind his glasses and he scrambled back from where he was curled up against Draco’s side. Draco looked unaffected as he got up to pull on his robes. Harry shook his head and grabbed his own trunk.
Harry tried signing again at the station officer in a last-ditch effort to figure out where Station 9 and 3/4 was supposed to be. The man scratched his head, frowning at Harry's careful hand gestures.
Draco paused his monologue to catch his breath, eyes sparkling. Harry was a little taken aback; Draco was clearly passionate about the subject. He held the quill poised in mid-air as he tried to think of an adequate response to that.
The name’s Bond, James Bond *munches apple*
Screwing his eyes shut and hoping to God he wasn't about to make a massive fool of himself, Harry gripped his trolley tight and ran into the wall. When his face didn't abruptly smash into stone, he opened his eyes slowly. A gleaming red train stood on the tracks. Harry adjusted his glasses, squinting at the words emblazoned on the train head.
‘You’re doing it again, the magic.’
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco gasped and looked down. The parchment and quill, along with everything in the compartment were levitating. But perhaps most surprising of all, Harry and Draco themselves were hovering a few inches above the floor. They stared at each other in wonder.
Harry looked behind him, surprised to see Draco still in the compartment. He had forgotten about the other boy for a second in his panic. Harry shook his head and forced a small smile for the Draco’s sake, then steeled himself and stepped out of the compartment. Draco wasn’t convinced, but he didn’t press the matter and followed the dark-haired boy outside.
He sagged in relief and hopped off the stool. The clapping for Slytherin came mostly from its own table (a light smattering from Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw; Gryffindor remained stubbornly silent). Draco couldn’t care less. He almost skipped over to the Slytherin table before remembering himself and making his way over to his new house with steady composed steps. He gave perfunctory greetings to the people sorted after him, attention zeroed in on the small green-eyed boy now sitting on the stool, thin hands gripping the stool in a death grip. Loud whispers broke out in the hall at Harry’s name, many of the older students craning their necks to get a closer look at the ‘Boy Who Lived’. He had to smile at the way the large hat drooped over Harry’s face, effectively shielding him from view.
interesting shade of green doesn’t mean I’ll get distracted from teachi – ‘
‘I never did get your name.’
‘Oomph! What the – oh, it’s
‘What’s wrong?’
‘You- you’re really something,’ Draco gasped, doubled on himself, clasping Harry’s shoulder with one hand to keep himself upright. Harry started laughing too, giggles escaping him in silent huffs. The two collapsed to the floor in their mirth, making their year mates stare at them even more. For the first time in a long time, Harry really didn’t care. In that moment, he felt like gold.
‘Oh! I could teach you, if you'd like. Sorry to break it to you, but you’re butchering it.’
His heart melts as Draco blinks slowly at him before a small smile crosses the blond’s face.
He breathes in deeply again and holds the air in his lungs for three seconds before letting it out again. He wills his heart rate to slow back to a normal rate as he continues to take another pair of deep breaths. He concentrates on his breathing for a few minutes, until he feels some of the panic start to subside, and then he gently kisses Draco awake.
Draco catches Greg’s eye above Luca’s head and notes the irritation there. He grins at his friend from across the store and receives a scowl in return. He crosses the floor and walks up to them.
was the adventurous one.” Harry grinned and continued to try to undress Draco.
“Many do.”
“As in?”
“Great,” Harry replied. “Can we get some food now?” As if to back him up, his stomach growled loudly. Draco snorted in amusement.
“Thanks,” he says. “It’s just a good thing that Potter happened to be staying over.” Like he does every night, he thinks, but doesn’t say.
There was another small pop and a fireplace inserted itself against the wall of the castle. A fire sprang up in the grate. “Let me rephrase,” Draco said, settling himself properly in his seat. “What are you doing out here aside from decorating the place?” Harry gave a small snort of laughter. Draco decided that was a good sign. He couldn’t be
Harry laughed and Ron turned his attention back to the conversation.
“Here,” Potter says, suddenly in front of him. He shoves Draco’s phone — snapped closed again — into Draco’s hands before hurrying away down the stairs.
“Go to the Slytherin dorms,” Ron said. He glared at Draco over Pansy’s shoulder.
“Talk first,” he says. Harry starts to protest but Draco shakes his head. “Think of the safety of the country, Potter.”
“He what?” Harry asked, voicing what all of them wanted to ask.
“It’s not a walk in the park,” Draco snaps. “I wish someone else
“No,” Massi cries. “You should definitely stay. Yes, you should stay all night. And as I said earlier, you should forget your hotel and stay with us.” Harry catches Draco’s eye over Massi’s shoulder and raises his eyebrows. Draco stares back at him and after a long moment, Harry nods.
“Yes,” Pansy says enthusiastically. “You can tell him just how great your date went.” This time, both Draco and Potter glare at her while she smiles innocently back at them. Draco can tell that she is enjoying this. He wonders if she suspects that he doesn’t mind as much as she seems to think he does. He wouldn’t put it past her. He had often been surprised that Pansy hadn’t been sorted into Ravenclaw.
“-He did what he felt he needed to do to keep the Reliquary safe and out of the Society’s clutches.”
“Yes, Mr. Malfoy,” Potter says. “I am dating your son.” Lucius’s lips press together in a thin line.
“Fuck. I probably should have been honest with you from the start.”
“Oh.”
“What is what, darling?” Narcissa asks him. She glances at Harry but all he can do is shrug, wide eyed and confused.
“Thank you.” Harry leaned in and kissed him. Draco pulled him close and held him there. They looked at each other for a long moment before Harry passed Draco the invisibility cloak. “Don’t forget this.” Draco couldn’t be seen once he’d led the Death Eaters through to the Room of Requirement, and it was the fastest way to disappear.
“No, no! Not at all. I’ve been wanting to go back there, but Greg hasn’t wanted to venture out to Chelsea.”
“Oh, come off it, Blaise. We’re Slytherins. We’re the kings of sneaking around. Or have you forgotten your dalliance last year with that Ravenclaw, oh, what was her name?”
“Oh, that’s nice of you, but no can do, boss.”
“Ignore him, Har’,” Ron said. “He’s a dick.”
“Was that-“
By the time they’ve finished with all their crackers, Draco is wearing a knitted hat shaped like a frog, topped with large, knitted googly eyes, Narcissa is wearing a silver sequined beret, and Lucius has a flower festooned, wide brimmed hat that Harry thinks would not be out of place at Ascot. Everyone seems pleased with their hats and their gifts and so they all tuck into the main course — beef tenderloin, roast potatoes and creamed spinach — with gusto.
“I tend to get most worried at night,” Harry said. “And it’s always worse because I’m alone and it’s dark.” Draco thought about that for a moment. Those things certainly weren’t helping how he felt.
He knows that he could just send Draco a message on his watch, but he wants a moment alone with his thoughts, which he isn’t getting with Pansy and McLaggen around. He takes the stairs two at a time and then makes his way leisurely down Diagon Alley.
“That park.”
“Why not?” Harry felt the conversation was turning around. Maybe. (Maybe they would have make up sex after all?)
“What are your next steps?” Granger asks. She stares expectantly at McLaggen.
“He was just making things for us,” Harry informed Seamus.
“Maybe,” he says.
“You would count me as your best friend?”
“What?” Pansy and Harry asked at the same time.
“What do we do now?” McLaggen asks.
“At least you still had your kit on.” Draco makes a horrified face at the thought of falling over naked in front of the house elf. “How are you feeling?”
“‘Course.” Mike claps Harry on the back and ushers them through the door, much to the chagrin of the people in the front of the line, a couple of whom stare daggers at Draco as he walks past. But then they are inside and the music washes over Draco and he forgets about them.
“I’m fucking with you,” she said. “But in all seriousness, it is too late right now. We have class in the morning.” Ron groaned and then brightened.
“What are you doing?” Potter asks.
“Well apparently, they can,” Draco snapped. “You should have killed her while you had her alone.”
“They’re for the sauce. They add flavor.” Clearly Draco has a lot to learn. Not that he’s planning on learning. If Potter’s going to be cooking, what’s the point in him doing it? Draco’s been known to burn pasta when left to his own devices, and Shreeky has chased him from the kitchen with a rolling pin more times than Draco cares to count.
“What the hell, guys?” Draco cried. “I thought you said you weren't going to do this again.”
working.”
“So you’re Conan?” Pansy asked. Ron nodded. “And Potter is Spaniel?”
“The audacity of these people!” Pansy exclaims later that afternoon as they’re counting the names that they gathered at the Ministry. “How arrogant do you have to be to wear the symbol of your secret society on your sleeve like that? They clearly don’t think anyone is going to investigate them.”
He reached out and selected a small chocolate cake with cherries and cream. Ron picked up a handful of cookies, while Hermione chose a cake similar to Harry’s.
“Very good. And your romantic relationship is just that? A cover? No secret feelings for each other? Nothing untoward has happened?”
“Yes, you do,” Harry sneered.
“It’s still good practice,” Draco says. “What if someone comes round?”
They needn’t have worried. The pub was crowded at this time of day, filled with families presumably visiting Hogsmeade for some afternoon shopping. They found a table in a quiet corner and decided that Blaise and Pansy were the most inconspicuous and so sent them to order the drinks and pick up food menus.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I’m going to get us some drinks,” Massi yells over the music. He makes his way back into the club while Harry and Draco sit down at one of the small clusters of comfortable chairs. Massi returns a few minutes later, clutching three gin and tonics. He sets them down on the table and they each take one. They clink glasses and then Massi picks up his drink and heads onto the dance floor. They watch him go but agree to finish their drinks before joining him.
“Why?” he asked eventually.
“We will also give the Order of the Phoenix several weeks’ notice of the day we’re planning this and we will set up apparition points in the Forbidden forest, or in the Hogs Head which will allow them to arrive quickly and discreetly.”
“Yes. And you would do damn well to remember that.”
Draco starts to get out a bottle of wine before he realizes that he is not sure what Potter will want to drink. He does not want to seem presumptuous. But what if the wine doesn’t have enough time to breathe? That’s all well and good, but what if Potter wants beer? Do they even have any beer? Draco hurries to the refrigerator that Hannah insisted they get. Ernie had even rigged it so that it ran on magic. He pulls it open and sighs in relief when he sees a small collection of cans and bottles inside. He peers at them more closely and realizes he is not quite sure where they came from. He wonders if Greg has somehow already told Hannah about his upcoming date, because if he has, it seems likely that she might have come over and stocked their fridge. She was a thoughtful Hufflepuff like that.
“Okay,” Harry said. “Yes, friends.” He smiled at them. This was helped by the fact that Hermione appeared a moment later behind Harry, quickly took in the situation, and followed Harry, Draco and Blaise down to the dungeons.
“It is. Granger has good taste.” He pulls the cork out with a pop. “Though, not in men.” Potter snorts in amusement, turning back to face Draco.
Harry frowned. He was decently sure that Draco meant it as an insult. But he could also be referring to the fact that Harry had just essentially just flayed his own dick while they were keeping up appearances. And thus saying that they shouldn’t be keeping up appearances?
“Ooh, I love a good mission inside of a mission.” Harry fights to keep his face impassive as McLaggen
“Are you fucking kidding me?” he says.
“Don’t blow me off like that,” McLaggen says. He walks into her field of vision on the other side of the bag.
“I hope we can still be a team,” he says. But Pansy smiles at him in a way that makes it seem like they won’t be.
Draco walked back over to him and took one of his hands.
“Hi,” Harry said, his eyes bright and hopeful. “Are you real?”
They gave Kreacher a small bag of galleons and a list. The elf was back within the hour, clutching Seamus’s undetectable extension charm altered bag which had been entirely refilled and wearing a pleased expression that he had been able to be of service.
“Yes, you did,” Ron said. “I heard you.” Draco scrunched up his face in a grimace, which all but gave away that they had heard him correctly.
“Would you be kind enough to share it with me?” Draco says. “So that I may allay it?”
“It is not just speculation,” Snape said. “Nor was it then.” He stared pointedly at Dumbledore who shrugged. “In fact,” and here he paused to sigh deeply, “I think they might be in love.”
“I was just surprised to hear his name, is all,” he says. His heart is hammering in his chest. Of all the things he would have thought Massi would show him - that he thought even existed in the world - this was not one of them. He forces himself to look at the Hand. It is shriveled and dried, just like the Hand of Glory that he bought at Borgin and Burke’s before his sixth year. It could be any Hand of Glory. Oddly, this makes it seem less sinister to Draco.
“Oh,” she said. “It was nothing.” It was not ‘nothing’. It had taken her the better part of the afternoon and lots of poring through architectural magic textbooks that she had gotten from the library. But it was done now, and she was rather proud of it.
“Draco,” Harry said, laying a hand on the blond’s shoulder. “The Cup is somewhere in the castle. We’ll find it.” Draco took a deep breath and nodded. “For now, I think we should tell everyone how our afternoon went.”
“I hope so,” Hermione said, staring down at her plate. Blaise put a comforting hand on her arm.
know that they’re behind it.” She reaches up and massages the bridge of her nose with her index finger and thumb. “You know who we should tell?” They stare at her. “McLaggen. In fact, we should do that right now.”
“What?” he demands, keeping his voice to a whisper.
want to talk about it and I’m not leaving until we do.”
“What’s that supposed to mean?”
“Yes, but—“ and then Pansy stops herself. Cormac is absolutely the wrong person with whom to talk about her relationship concerns.
He was not a hundred percent sure what his feelings were towards her, the fact that she was a Gryffindor and muggle born certain muddied the waters, but there was growing affection, that was for sure. But he could not let it distract him right now, so he rolled his head from one side to the other, feeling the joints crack with the release of tension, and set to work gathering the ingredients they would need.
“Oh no,” she cried, a horrified expression on her face.
“Wait,” Pansy continued. “Didn’t you send Potter to the hospital wing yesterday?”
“What about their fight the other day?” he asked. Pansy shrugged.
“Then why did you slap me?” Ron asked. He propped himself up on his elbow too, so that he could be at eye level with her.
Men in suits and women in dull colored dresses mill about the room, forming impromptu circles before drifting apart again. While the dress is black tie, it is clearly not celebration black tie. This is a work function for everyone involved.
“Hi Luna,” Harry says brightly.
“I don’t suppose ‘no’ is an answer, is it?”
He’d felt almost cheated when Blaise had suggested the four of them destroy the diadem together. Relieved, of course, but also a bit cheated. Because Ron knew he could take out a horcrux on his own. Or, at least, he was pretty sure he could. And now he was going to. Unless Pansy beat him to it.
He can’t help it. He starts to cry, tears silently spilling out of his eyes and down his face. He feels so safe in Harry’s arms. So safe and wanted, and for a moment he can convince himself that it’s real.
“But Christmas,” she said quietly. “I thought.”
They can get through this, he tells himself.
“Would you like me to stop?” Draco asked. His fingers were scrabbling around for purchase on the zip of Harry's trousers.
“Hello sir,” he says. “Is there anything I can help you with?” The man turns and his eyes rake Draco’s frame. His mouth curls into a small sneer.
Draco stares as he walks down the entrance hall to the door. He’s carrying what appears to be a container of cleaning wipes, and is wearing a small frown on his face.
“Why do you want to know, anyway?” Terry asked.
“He only likes me because I’m good in bed,” Draco said. The girl’s eyes went, if anything, wider, while Harry turned to glare at Draco because the girl couldn’t have been much older than twelve. But now that Harry had kissed him once, it was like the dam had been broken, and Draco leaned in and kissed the glare right off of Harry’s face.
“Of course,” Draco lies. “It’s top secret though,” he adds, before Greg can ask what it is.
But at the same time, he knows exactly why they’re waiting outside - it is so that they don’t disturb the crime scene. So he stamps his feet to ward off the cold and pulls his cloak tighter around his shoulders. He pulls out his wand and looks over at Hermione, remembering her favorite spell in their first year at Hogwarts. He conjures a small, bluebell fire, thinking fondly of the time she used it to distract Professor Quirrell in order to save his life. He holds the fire in one palm and watches as it flickers. He puts his wand away and spends some time shifting the fire from one hand to the other, enjoying the warmth that it puts out.
“Uh, fine?”
They sat there in silence for a long moment. Harry didn’t want to be the one to speak first and so he waited until Draco did. Finally Draco said,
“Dobby is working very hard on these baubles,” he intoned.
“Crucio,” came a voice from behind them and suddenly Hermione’s body felt as though it were on fire. She fell, hard, on the floor, but she didn’t register that pain on top of the rest of the fire spreading through her body. A scream ripped itself from her throat and she yelled as she never had before. She was dimly aware of Blaise beside her, but she couldn’t see what he was doing. Whatever it was, it must have worked, because a moment later the pain abated.
“I meant if Hermione were here, then you two smart people could figure this out. Instead you’ve got me.”
“In all fairness, the idea of being in Witch Weekly would have been enough.”
“Hi Pansy,” a voice says and then Greg appears from around the nearest bookshelf. Out of the corner of his eye, he sees Pansy tense for a moment before a smile breaks out on her face. If he hadn’t been watching her, he would never have noticed her tension. As it is, Greg is oblivious to it. He reaches out his arms and pulls her into a hug.
“Harry,” Hermione is saying. “You’re overreacting.”
“I don’t remember any,” Richard mumbles to himself.
“Sushi is fine with me,” she says. “I was just surprised you wanted it.”
“Are you that guy from Independence Day?” Harry asked. Blaise’s face split into a smile.
“Where do you live?”
“Have you ever had a popsicle?”
“Yeah, go on, Potter,” Blaise called. “Show us lesser mortals.” Hermione whispered something in his ear. “What? All of you can do it? Even Ron?”
“That’s true,” Harry agreed. He was getting rather tired of being in Draco’s body, or more accurately, he was ready to be back in his own. Because it was almost bedtime, and while kissing was one thing, he didn’t think he could quite wrap his head around sleeping with himself. He hoped they would change back soon.
“Er,” Harry said. “I don’t know. I think so? That was Ron’s job, but I don’t know if he managed it before Voldemort found me.”
“The Chamber of Secrets?” Dumbledore asked, his eyes suddenly twinkling. Draco wasn’t sure what the eye twinkle meant.
“Do you really think you’re his number one enemy?” Draco asked. “Not Dumbledore?”
“When are they scheduled to come back?” Pansy asks. It’s been over a month now and she’s tired of working at Flourish and Blott’s for no reason other than keeping up her cover. She hasn’t arrested anyone, or stunned them in too long and her wand hand is itchy. This isn’t strictly true as she did briefly stun Luca the week before when he tried to convince her to buy the debut album of his and Joe’s band, Joca! but Pansy doesn't count this.
“So you wouldn’t rather fuck her than me?” Pansy asked with a smirk. A flash of irritation crossed Blaise’s face.
When he returned, he distributed the fangs between the four of them. Harry moved to take one, but they waved him away.
feel like you’re in over your head? You’re the highest ranking Ministry member on our task force.”
“I’m sorry. Did you just say McLaggen? As in Cormac McLaggen?” Pansy nods.
He had worked behind the bar with Hannah for a few years until he realized that few people wanted their drinks served by an ex-Death Eater (even though he had only been 16 when he’d received the Mark and hadn’t really had much of a say in the whole thing). She had generously split her tips with him, but after looking around the bar one evening and seeing a long stretch of patrons waiting for Hannah to serve them and only the most regular of regulars waiting for Draco, he had decided to find another job. Which was how he had ended up at Flourish and Blotts.
“If I had known you’d be this sappy after I told you I loved you, I would never have done it.” Draco kicks Harry lightly under the table and smirks at him over his coffee cup.
“Fair,” Draco admits.
“But Professor,” he said. Dumbledore shook his head.
He did his best to listen in to the conversations around him, but they were surprisingly mundane. Clearly no one was talking about their plans to take over the world over Christmas lunch.
“I think that’s mine,” Harry said. “But you can use it.” Draco nodded, his mouth suddenly dry. Using Harry’s wand felt almost more intimate than what they were about to do. But he banished the thought from his mind and performed the various spells he had learned from the restricted section books. He put his hand back onto Harry’s cock, covering it with lubrication, before guiding him to the right place.
“I see,” Pansy says. “So I have to help you because you failed to do your actual job?”
“What, actually?”
“Please,” Draco says.
“Tosser,” Greg says, giving his shoulder a playful nudge.
“What? We normally wear school uniforms.” Ron frowned at Harry.
“Let’s give him some space,” he said to Ron’s inquiring look.
“I am not being the little faun guy,” Harry said. “Before you even ask.”
“How did you do that?” he asks, gesturing at the skates.
“Before we go,” Harry said. Dumbledore tilted his head to the side in curiosity.
“Oh, Ron,” she said. “What are we going to do with you?”
Feedback, as ever, is appreciated :D
“It was mostly Harry,” he says.
“Well, it wasn’t funny,” Harry snaps. Draco hasn’t seen Harry this pissed off since Hogwarts, and part of him wants to keep pushing Harry’s buttons to see what happens.
Harry shook his head.
(See the end of the chapter for
“—Or else I’ll be sad and you wouldn’t want that, would you?” Draco looked up at Harry with wide, puppy dog eyes. He saw the moment that Harry relented.
“You’ll get over it. You had voluntarily been on a date with him just an hour earlier,” she says. “And I’m sure it’s not the first time Potter’s had to share a bed with someone he didn’t like. I mean, he’s an Unspeakable after all. It’s often his job to seduce people or pose as their romantic partner.”
“You were part of Dumbledore’s Army, weren’t you?” Draco asks.
“Gee thanks,” Harry said, his voice dripping with sarcasm. “Then why did you agree to go on a date at all?”
futures so that the brewers could work towards what they thought was the best one. It was created to help us decide how best to proceed, possibly with difficult decisions. ‘Is it a good idea if I take this job?’ for example.”
“You get used to the gossip witches,” he says.
“Tell me the truth.”
“Gemino,” Draco said, tapping his wand on the shirt that lay on the table. A moment later, a copy appeared next to it. It was almost a perfect copy. The cut was the same, the material was the same, but the color was slightly off. It was grey, not the black that it was supposed to be. He sighed.
“I believe,” Dumbledore said. “Miss Granger, that if I die of natural causes, Draco will appear to have done his job, particularly if he then lets the Death Eaters into the school. This should let Professor Snape out of the vow.” Hermione chewed her lip but nodded. Blaise shuffled closer to her and put an arm around her and she leaned gratefully into his side.
“Harry,” Pansy says sharply.
“Then what’s the problem?”
“Things?”
“Good. Right now the recommendation is that lockdown should last for two weeks, but that is, of course, subject to change depending on how well we contain the spread of the disease."
“Indeed.” They stand there for a long moment while Parkinson continues to glare at both of them, alternating between them.
“Are your pants off yet?” Harry’s question distracted Draco from thoughts of Harry’s cock. He held himself up in a half bridge and shimmied his underwear down his thighs.
“Yeah, me neither,” Draco says. “Absolutely miserable.” Harry reaches down and ruffles Draco’s hair. Draco sits up abruptly and smooths it back down.
“I’m not generally a bottom.”
Harry blinks back a tear as he thinks about what they had been talking about over breakfast. It had been so casual. They had been excited about the fact that tomorrow was Saturday and they had the whole weekend to do nothing but sleep late, eat whatever they wanted, and, well, fuck a lot. It had been Harry’s birthday yesterday and Oliver had promised him an entire weekend of debauchery. Because if there was one thing they did well together, it was sex. Not that they were strictly supposed to be sleeping together, but it wasn't strictly forbidden either.
“What is it?”
“That’s it?” Blaise asked. Harry nodded.
“Fuck Jamie.”
“He found out that Wood died,” Potter says over Draco’s shoulder. “And they had, ah, had a thing a few years ago.”
“He looks so sad.”
“You appear to already have a Ministry altered watch,” Banks says. “May I enquire as to how you got it?”
“Why would it not be?”
As ever, feedback is appreciated. :)
“Excellent job, team,” Big Dick starts to say, but most of the employees have already started to leave, moving as soon as the front doors were shut. Only Draco, Greg and Emma have stayed behind. Draco hears faint yells of “pub!” from the vicinity of the break room. He figures he will join them there later, but he has to get in his evening run first, even though the day has tired him out to the point that he would really rather skip it.
“A Christmas surrounded by friends,” Harry say. “I can’t wait.”
“Probably not, but I’ll be fine. Go back to sleep.” Draco tiptoes out of the room as Harry’s eyes flutter closed again.
“Oh?”
“He’s got a point,” Pansy says. Harry flicks his eyes towards her. Whose side is she on?
“I don’t know if we have the time,” she says. “I imagine Draco wants to change before we take him in.”
“And how would you know, Potter?” Draco asked in mock outrage.
Tusneem watches Malfoy impassively. When he finishes speaking, the Minister nods once and then stands fully upright, crossing his arms in front of him. He reaches up with one hand and thoughtfully rubs his chin. Then he tilts his head from side to side, cracking his neck. Finally, he speaks.
“I think everyone knows that, Pans,” Blaise said.
“I mean, sure, I liked you - and I still do - but nothing had happened between us yet.
“So you mentioned Swinn was back home?” she asks Cormac, bringing his attention back to her. He turns to face her, angling his chest so that he’s facing her. His hand slides higher, under her dress now, and Pansy barely manages to keep her face impassive.
“Where do I even start?”
“Right then,” McLaggen says. He straightens the papers he has in front of him and then looks up at Draco again. “Baseline questions. What is your name?”
“If it bothers you so much, why don’t you change your name?”
“Don’t you think that is potentially a conflict of interest?” Harry asked. He moved his head to try to fall into Draco’s line of sight, but Draco flicked his eyes down to the table instead.
“I think we should start our own meeting,” Hermione said. “And not just wait for Dumbledore to schedule one.”
“Truce,” Draco agreed. He reached up and tugged Harry back down, pressing their lips together. And the dance began again, this time with belt buckles and trouser flies. In short order, they were both stripped down to just their underwear.
“So you believe us?” McLaggen asks.
too dangerous.” Draco chewed on his lower lip, thinking hard.
He turns his attention back to the passing food, desperate to think about neither Wood nor Potter. He realizes he is bloody starving and wants to eat everything. He wonders if the Ministry is paying for lunch and voices this question aloud.
“We do have enough of them,” Hermione mused.
“I’m serious though. Let’s get a place. That way we don’t have to stay with my parents. We can look for a place while you’re at the Weaselys'.”
Silence falls as Draco turns his attention to his toast, not wanting to talk more about the night before. What would be the point? He finishes his toast and instead focuses on coffee. It is black, which is not how he prefers it, but he had not wanted to ask Potter where the milk and the sugar were and so has resigned himself to the bitterness.
“I’m kidding,” Harry said and then pushed Blaise out into the bustling shop.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Agreed,” he said. “Thank you for your counsel. I will bring this topic up at the next staff meeting.”
“Fuck,” was all Draco had to say.
“My old Auror badge. No one quite knows if I’m still an Auror, or if I’m retired, or what, so they just keep letting me use it.”
They make their way up the floors of the house until they reach a small landing at the top. There are four doors that lead off of it. Two doors lead to bedrooms — one of which is smothered in Gryffindor red and plastered with muggle posters of bikini clad women, the other of which is bedecked in Slytherin green. One door leads to a modest bathroom, but it’s the last door that’s the most interesting. The fourth door opens onto a staircase which leads them to the roof, where there’s a small garden, kitted out with a two person wrought iron table and chair set.
“I said, when you were out of the room, he informed me that I was to get the Mark as soon as I turned seventeen.” Harry’s heart sank.
“They’re totally fucking,” to which Seamus laughed. But Seamus didn’t say anything else, and for that Harry was grateful. He wondered if he should tell Dean. Everyone else in the room knew. But already too many people knew. Ron, Hermione, Blaise, Pansy, Neville, Seamus, Justin, Colin… Fuck. They really
“It’s tricky, but I think that because some of Harry’s blood lives in Voldemort, that Harry’s not being dead is tethering him to life.”
“Last minute. I was wandering through Leicester Square and thought it might be fun.”
“I don’t need setting up,
“Are you asking what I think you’re asking?”
“Claudia,” Neville said, slightly louder.
“Close your mouth, sweetie,” Draco said, glancing over at him. “You look like a trout.” Harry glared at him and pressed his lips together in a scowl. “Oh, don’t give me that look.”
“Mine had broken.” Harry doesn’t elaborate. Draco starts to walk towards the nearest body. “Your wand felt the friendliest.”
The conversation flows surprisingly naturally. Harry supposes it’s because he has Draco in common with the senior Malfoys and most of the conversation is centered around him, but even still, he’s pleasantly surprised. Draco regales his parents with the story of Harry and the snowbank and Harry even musters up a self-deprecating smile, helped along by the very good wine that the Malfoys are serving.
“On the way to the forum?” Greg hazards.
“What the fuck was that?” Harry asks once they reach the landing of Draco’s tower.
’ Harry slumped down in his seat, resigning himself to this being just an absolutely terrible day - what, with almost scourgify-ing his own balls off and now this sure to be berating from Ron.
us to get caught.”
“Possibly,” Harry said. “We can write it down as an idea.” Ron got up and wrote Hufflepuff’s Cup on the blackboard.
“Are you not?”
“Harry, you just told me you own one nice jumper and one pair of jeans. What am I supposed to think?”
He had wanted to cry as the Dark Lord had stared down at him, his red eyes flashing, and had instructed him to kill Albus Dumbledore. A summer’s worth of worrying had culminated in that. The impossible task. Coupled with the threat of death if Draco failed. Draco wasn’t sure if it was his death he worried about more, or his mother’s. But the Dark Lord hadn’t been done. As if that hadn’t been difficult enough, Draco had to find a way to bring a group of Death Eaters into Hogwarts undetected… But he had agreed because he had to protect his mother.
“Most likely.” His fingers become more insistent and suddenly Pansy can’t take it any more. She sucks in a breath.
“We were invisible,” Draco protested and Harry smirked. “That was different.”
“Damp,” Pansy said. “And depressing.”
“Dinner’s ready!”
“I’ll find you something less formal to wear in a bit.” Then he walks away, leaving Draco standing in the hallway.
“Sure,” Draco says. He leads the way downstairs.
“Of course not,” Lucius says, far too quickly.
“That’s not fair,” he splutters. “I was acting.”
“Thank you,” he says.
“But curtains, Ron,” Harry said.
“It’ll be fine,” Harry said. He was trying to reassure himself as well as Draco.
“I’m on it,” he said and he stole out of the room. Harry rolled his eyes at his retreating back.
“Is this your way of trying to talk me into bed?”
“Tap your watch with your finger now.” Draco does and a small menu pops up. One option reads ‘respond’, so Draco taps that.
“You fucking knew and you didn't tell me?” Malfoy’s voice is an angry hiss.
Plus, they had all agreed that they wanted to bring down the Dark Lord. They’d even signed a piece of parchment, that had been produced by Hermione. And knowing Hermione, she had put some sort of binding or jinx on it to make sure they were true to their word.The idea of Draco walking around with SNEAK written across his face in pimples reassured Harry slightly.
“Thinking about Christmas,” Draco mumbles.
“Why did you stop?” Massi asks.
“Thank you, Susan,” Harry says. She chews on her bottom lip for a moment before turning and walking down the corridor. Once she’s gone, Harry turns back to the others.
“Well, Ronnie’s not here,” Bones says to McLaggen.
“What? Do you think we’re eleven? Grow up, McLaggen.” He pushes himself up from the booth and slides out. He runs a rueful hand through his hair and then turns back to the booth in order to collect his empty glass.
, per se, no,” he concedes. He doesn’t know enough about it to be as worried as Potter though.
“What does this mean?” he asks, holding up his wrist to show Harry.
“Constant vigilance,” he said as Ron made a disgruntled face.
He pulled away after a long moment, conscious of the fact that they needed to get their rune finished. Draco’s lips were pink and his eyes were bright, but Harry ignored what he really wanted to do and pulled his potion’s book out instead. Draco followed his lead.
“Of course. I didn’t mean-“ he stops himself there and Seamus smiles at him.
“You planning to extend that to the rest of the DA again?” Seamus asked.
“Of course,” Draco says. He bows as Signore Battaglia dismisses him and then walks out of the room, holding his head high and trying to seem as confident, if deferent, as possible.
The song abruptly stopped and a slower one came on, in the way that songs always seem to do in romantic movies when the two characters that you want to get together finally start dancing. Ron looked around for the source of the music, but could not fine one. Perhaps it was the room itself that had changed the music.
“What about Malfoy?” McLaggen suggests and Harry’s heart constricts.
A cursory glance of the room tells Draco the room is a pretty standard, pureblood dining room. From the room long table to the china cabinet, he could be looking at his parents’ old dining room. In fact, and here he does a double take, the china pattern might even be the same.
“I wonder if Father will let us borrow one now. I think it might have been long enough since the last time we asked.”
convenient sometimes, he thought as the elf appeared next to him. “Can you please bring us six glasses and-“
“Look,” Harry said. “We’ll tell you all about it once Draco’s ready.” He looked around the room. “Where is it by the way?”
“I’m sure plenty of people will think that,” Hermione said darkly. “Don’t open any unsolicited mail, Draco. Harry’s fans can be a tad overprotective.” She clenched her fists before relaxing them and Harry was sure she was remembering fourth year when someone had sent her bubotuber pus after Rita’s ridiculous Valentine’s Day article.
“Alohamora.”
“Correct.”
“I’ve been thinking, and I think it should be me,” Harry says. He and Draco have now returned to the Cooler and if Pansy and McLaggen thought anything of his long absence, they haven’t mentioned anything.
“This is a very bad idea,” Draco said in a small, shaky voice, looking down at Harry but he didn’t stop him. Harry ignored his words, instead leaning forward and taking Draco into his mouth.
“Well, yes,” Harry says. “But that’s not what I was referring to.”
“Like hell we don’t,” Harry said. “I’ll be right back.” He stood up and hurried up the stairs to his room. He threw open his trunk and pulled out Seamus’s expanded bag. Seamus had entrusted it to Harry over the Christmas hols saying that there would be more than enough whisky for him at home. Harry carried it back down the stairs, clinking with every step he took.
“Of course, Draco,” Potter said with that same smile. That smile was definitely going to cause him problems.
"A pet? What is he?"
"Oh." Draco wasn't sure what to say. He'd never met anyone who didn't have parents before. He thought for a moment, then stepped closer. "Does he always treat you like that?"
"I couldn't tell you, Malfoy. I'm not allowed. Not to a prisoner."
“No,” Draco said, shaking his head and scowling. “And it makes absolutely no sense to me.”
Harry laughed. “Well, not every power can be exciting as mine…”
“Look…it wasn’t…it didn’t start that way. But then you kept whining…I couldn’t resist. I always intended to marry you properly, Draco.”
Draco stilled his fingers completely, deflated at that reaction. “Sorry.”
“To what? Tell Weasley? Granger?”
Soon, though, that wasn't enough, either. Despite being unable to see his host's face, Draco realized he was growing more and more attached to him. Twice he drew close to asking his name again, the other man disappeared and left Draco alone for a full week after. He hadn't done it a third time.
“God, no,” he said softly. “Why? Did dreaming of that really upset you so much?”
“No. You infuriate me. But…not just…” Potter reached out to try to take Draco’s hand. “Maybe we could…”
"Very well. We wish to verify the facts of this case, then." He flipped open the file in front of him and glanced over the papers inside before looking once more at Draco. "you are the son of Lucius Malfoy and his wife, Narcissa Malfoy, formerly Narcissa Black?"
“Yes, well…I
A war rose inside Draco, and he couldn't decide where to start. "Knew…what was me?" he finally asked.
“Well…this girl. Her parents steal something from a witch, so the witch takes their baby in return, and lock her in a tower, and leaves her there. Makes her grow out her hair so that she can climb up and spend time with her.”
“Well what, Malfoy?”
“Why? Because you didn’t like it?” Draco asked.
“Explain what?”
But the moral isn't Hope can destroy evil. Quite often, the two exist side by side, one never touching the other. No, the true moral is so long as Hope exists, evil will never win.
“The big guns being me?” Draco asks.
“Dobby has done as Harry Potter wishes,” he squeaked, handing it over.
“What?” Big Dick starts to ask, gesturing dumbly at the tower of books. And that is when he spots the interested patrons who are peering at the book fort in delight. Joe has ignored everything that has been going on and is continuing to add to the fort, building out rooms from the main tower. He looks up at a nearby patron and smiles at them.
As soon as McLaggen has left, Harry looks at his watch. It’s still early, so he stands up and makes his way back upstairs. He changes quickly back into his normal clothes and leaves. If McLaggen is confused by his actions, he doesn’t say anything. Once Harry is outside, he apparates straight to the employee entrance of the Ministry. Within ten minutes, he is in front of Hermione’s desk.
“Thanks,” she sneered and turned back to the wardrobe, not waiting to see if he closed the door behind him. She ground her teeth as she looked through her options again. Nothing jumped out at her, so she closed her eyes and grabbed a shirt at random.
“Sure,” Luna said. “Do you have time now?” Harry checked his watch. He had Defense Against the Dark Arts in half an hour. But there was plenty of time to run to Ravenclaw Tower and then back down to the third floor for class. He nodded and Luna took his hand as they weaved their way through groups of students in the corridors.
Malfoy reaches over and takes his coffee mug. Lifting it to his mouth, he takes a large sip. He watches Harry over the lip of the mug, eyes narrowed, before putting it down on the table again.
“Right,” the headmaster said, clapping his hands. “Might I please ask that the students vacate their seats please?” After a few confused glances, everyone got to their feet. Dumbledore pulled out his wand and waved it. The benches rose into the air and made their way over to the side of the room, followed shortly by the tables, leaving rows of students standing in the empty hall. One student (Dennis Creevey) had not stood up fast enough and had started to rise up with the benches before he had squeaked and jumped off.
Hermione made a noncommittal noise as she started working on adding the kitten whiskers. Blaise began to help from the other side of the rune and she looked up at him when their hands met in the middle.
“Ta,” Harry says, raising his mug at Ron who mirrors the gesture. He blows on the hot liquid and takes a small sip. He burns the tip of his tongue and so puts the mug down on the floor next to his feet for the time being. “No,” he continues. “Nothing secret about the Battaglia dinner. They were using the dinner we were at as a cover to take out a rival family.” Harry shrugs. “All I did was knock everyone out and call local authorities.”
But she hadn’t wanted him to kiss her, so he had deserved the slap.
The train rocks gently as it chugs along, and soon they rock to the same rhythm, so lost in each other that they hardly notice their surroundings.
“I think that should work,” Harry said. “We can use the Room of Requirement.” Pansy caught Ron’s eye and smirked. “Not like that.”
“Undetectable extension charm?” Harry suggested. Draco shook his head.
“I hope they can carry everything,” Hermione said, still sounding worried.
“How does no one at Flourish and Blotts know about your position?” Draco asks. It has never occurred to him to ask until now. Pansy sighs.
“Blaise?”
“There’s something wrong with Hermione,” Harry says.
“So what if I do?”
“You’re welcome.” He decides to take the bold move of sitting next to Malfoy on the sofa as opposed to going back to the chair he was in earlier. Or, rather, while Harry thinks it’s a bold move, Malfoy doesn’t bat an eyelid. But now that Harry is there, he realizes he is looking out at the room, and not at Malfoy. He shifts in his seat so that he is facing towards the blond and in doing so, he ends up bringing their knees together. And then once he has done that, he can’t take it away again or he’ll look like a twat. Merlin he wished he had tried harder during seduction class.
“I believe you already did.” As much as common sense would tell Harry to stop flirting at this point as nothing good can come of it, he finds he can’t help himself. Last night was better than he would have thought possible. And the fact that Malfoy hasn’t now cursed him from here to next Sunday seems like a good indication that he had enjoyed it too. If only Malfoy hadn’t read that damn book, Harry could convince himself that perhaps they could have made this work. But there is no sense dwelling on that now.
“Right,” she says. “I’ll go wake her up then.” She turns to leave and then stops herself. “But before I do that, I feel like I should tell you that the type of coma she is in, is one that is only ever used by medi-wizards. It’s very advanced and it’s tricky to perform - I didn’t learn it until my third year at Octogomery.”
“Do you have a costume?”
“Thank fuck for that. All our unresolved tensions have left me with needs that need to be taken care of.”
“If you know so much about the Reliquary, why are you asking me to confirm who the Reliquary is?”
“Fuck, even
“The portkey office, at the Ministry.”
“You would have thought this was beneath
“Well, uh, can you?” Greg scratches the back of his head like this conversation isn’t a big deal. He clearly doesn’t know that Draco, and quite frankly a lot of people, saw him and Pansy earlier. Or perhaps he is just not thinking about it.
“Er, yes,” he says. “That’s what it feels like when I see something. Like it sparks a memory. So for lack of any other word, I’ve been calling it sparking.”
“I spent all morning planning this out, and you just make a joke about it.” He scowls and starts to make his way down the stairs. Draco follows.
“Still sleeping,” Draco grumbles.
think will look good?” Potter stands up and begins to pace the dining room, where they’ve relocated.
“Thanks,” Massi mumbles. He waves it over himself, drying his swimming trunks and the wet spot that had spread from beneath him. “Draco, how are you feeling?”
“Ah yes,” Pansy said. “Your epic love story, of ‘fuck it’.”
“Well, there are six of us, Ron,” Hermione said.
“Leave him be, Blaise. He’s clearly just sexually frustrated,” Pansy said.
“He is,” Draco agrees.
“Do you remember in fourth year when Mad Eyed Moody showed us the unforgivable curses on those spiders? Wait, did he show the goody two shoes Gryffindors?” Draco asked.
The dumpling appeared on Harry’s plate just as Bellatrix laughed particularly loudly and Harry was grateful for the distraction that it provided. It was larger than he had anticipated and he had to bite it in half to eat it. Harry thought that it was very good, but after the beef, all other food seemed to pale in comparison.
“Pansy,” Harry says. “I think I should be the one to impersonate her. I know her best.”
Gradually, Harry’s hands travelled south until he reached the tops of Draco’s underwear. He slipped a hand underneath the band and squeezed Draco’s arse under the cloth.
Harry stared into the fireplace, watching as the flames happily licked the inside of the chimney. He didn’t want to ask if inanimate objects could be sent through the Floo Network, because he figured the answer must be no if Draco hadn’t suggested it. He took a deep breath and attempted to relax his shoulders, which he realized, in his tension, were up by his ears.
“Ambulance.” Draco points at the vehicle down the road. The flashing lights are off, but there is a person being maneuvered into the vehicle. Harry blinks. It’s not a person. It’s a body under a sheet. He frowns. He hasn’t been on the street for long enough to know who any of his neighbors are, but he seems to recall that there is an elderly couple who lives somewhere further down the street. He had seen them walking together on the day he had moved in.
Somehow, Blaise had shifted so that his face was in front of hers. Hermione hadn’t quite seen how he had done it, but he had moved them so that her legs were now draped over his and his arms were around her. Their faces were inches apart. Her eyes went wide as he moved his head closer to hers.
“I’ll go get him and you can ask him yourself.” Draco stood up from his bed and traipsed over to the door. He pulled it open and hurried back to the common room.
They follow the senior Malfoys into a different sitting room than the last time they had visited, which Harry realizes with a jolt was when Draco had come out to them. It seems like forever ago. In that time they’ve become a real couple and fallen in love. He can honestly tell Narcissa that he would do anything to keep her son safe. Not that he wouldn’t have before, but now he can certainly keep Draco’s heart safe too.
“Should we, perhaps, move somewhere else then?” No matter how many times Snape told them he didn't monitor their comings and goings in these rooms, Harry remained unconvinced.
“Are you saying you fucked him in the Chamber of Secrets?”
“So the Reliquary,” McLaggen says after a long enough pause has gone by. “Does it tell you if someone has a particular affiliation?”
“Banks,” Dempsey yells and a moment later, the image flickers and Pansy knows that Mortimer Banks has stuck his head in the room. He is so tiny on the image floating over Pansy’s watch that if she had not known to look for it, she would have missed him. “We need an emergency team at,” she pauses to allow Pansy to fill in the rest of the location.
“Would you
“I don’t know,” Draco says. He shoves his hands into his jacket pockets and looks down at his feet. “I figured you were going to decide. I don’t know what any of these are about.”
“Where did you end up?” he asked and then watched as Neville’s round face flushed.
“Potter, if you were in my bed, I assure you we would be doing more than kissing.” A smile crept across Draco’s face.
“How many of those Half and Half hangover cure potions do we have in the kitchens?”
“This side,” Draco says, pointing to the slept in side and walking around to it. Harry nods and pulls the covers back on the other side and clambers in. He is wearing his full set of pajamas, even though he usually only wears the bottoms, in an effort to be more properly attired for bed. Draco is still in his clothes and is twisting his hands together awkwardly.
“No?” Malfoy asks, pouting but still not removing his hand. “But what if there are other wizards about? Or, better yet, the Prophet?” Harry groans. “What? If your cover is that you’re Harry Potter, and my cover is that I’m your boyfriend, the Prophet is bloody going to have to find out at some point.” At this, Malfoy sits back and removes his hand. “Which,” he says more quietly. “Means my parents will find out.” And then even more quietly. “Fuck.”
“Yes,” he says. “We’ve been invited to Christmas dinner at the Burrow.” To Draco’s credit, he does not protest or make a horrified face, merely nods.
“Is that your way of asking me to leave?” Neville asked. “I didn’t mean to interrupt anything.”
“Tomorrow I think we should do a final rundown,” Hermione said.
“Perhaps he’s just misunderstood,” suggested Seamus.
“The one and same,” Draco says.
It was a jewelry box, similar to the one that Draco had given Harry the night before. Harry barely resisted reaching up and touching the ring that hung about his neck. Draco opened the box, looked at what was inside of it and then looked up at his mother.
“We could even do presents on Christmas Eve,” he suggested.
“It wasn’t my point either.
“Right, yes, your fight,” he said. “What happened? We were all shooed away by Hermione after you started screaming.”
“Oh, come off it, Draco,” Pansy snaps. “You’ve basically had a month long vacation.” It’s true so Draco does not argue, though he wants to protest that the last few days of said vacation had been spent fucking the heir to the Battaglia family, and the emotional turmoil that went with it, while also trying to stay alive. Not to mention the Luczkowski dinner. He can still see all the green and red flashes of light when he closes his eyes. He suppresses a shudder. Now is not the time to talk about that. He is sure they will have a full debrief with Granger once his day is done at the bookstore and they can talk about it then.
“We’re not even there yet,” Harry said. He took Draco’s hand again and began walking down the tunnel, not bothering to look to see if the others were following.
“Shall we call him then?” Harry asked.
“Snape.”
“Oh,” she says quickly. “We’re going to lunch.”
“You told her?”
Massi joins them in the bedroom half an hour later, looking flustered. He is still in his bathing suit and when he sits down on the bed, a damp spot begins to spread.
“I’m aware,” Harry says again. Draco glances at him and sees a muscle in his jaw working, betraying the actual irritation that Harry feels.
“I didn’t realize we had our own currency,” he says. Jamie narrows his eyes. “Look. I’m sorry about all the commotion. You know how Joe and Luca are.” But Jamie just shakes his head. Then he puts a hand on Draco’s shoulder and looks at him earnestly.
“How did Malfoy react to you casually bringing down a Mafia family over dinner?”
“Yes, what of it?”
“Thanks, Malfoy,” Harry said, sarcasm dripping from his tone. Draco shrugged.
asked him out. He should have known it was too good to be true.
“I could ask the same thing of you,” Pansy snapped back.
that you can tell me things. Like this embarrassing thing that happened to you. Because I tell you
And is he a tiny bit excited about it? Fuck yes he is. He has wanted to see Draco’s orgasm face again since that time in the shower. He wants to have that kind of power over the blond again. The power to make him gasp and moan and to make his knees go weak. To make him cry out Harry’s name as he comes. Oh Potter. Fuck, yes, Potter. He
“Yes,” Massi says quickly. “Let’s go.” He grabs Draco’s other hand and tugs them out the door. Draco squeezes Harry’s hand lightly and feels Harry squeeze his back in return. It helps to dissipate some the feeling of dread that has settled over Draco. But as they follow Massi down the stairs, Draco can’t help but think the worst. He wants nothing more than to let go of Massi’s hand and to push Harry into the nearest wall and kiss him senseless, just in case it’s the last time he can do that. But he can’t.
“The night of Dumbledore’s death you mean?” Pansy asked.
“Briefly.”
“Perhaps you’re right,” she said to Hermione. “I mean, there’s clearly something there, but then, I think there’s perhaps been something there on Draco’s side for a while now.” Now it was Hermione’s turn to look surprised.
“Uh, no,” McLaggen says, looking suddenly uncomfortable. Pansy resists rolling her eyes and instead stares at him. “I was, er, unconscious. I’d been dueling and someone hit me with a Stunner.”
“Fine,” McLaggen says. He takes a large sip of his G&T and swallows it. Then he takes a deep breath. “I’ll level with you. There’s a secret group within the Ministry who are working to undermine Tusneem's pro-Muggle cooperation agenda.” Pansy is a fan of Tusneem's “Be a light in the darkness for our magic free allies” posters. She finds them wonderfully quaint.
“It still seems weird,” Harry said. “But I think we’ll have to.”
“Uh.”
“Are you—“ Draco starts to ask and then stops himself. Potter turns to stare at him. “Are you alright?”
“-That was me, yes,” Draco says. “Just getting things ready. No rush.” Massi nods slowly. “We can stop if you want,” Draco says. A part of him hopes Massi that will say that yes, they should stop. Because this much Draco feels he could explain to Harry. Keeping their cover intact and what not. But Massi shakes his head.
“Finch-Fletchley knows?” Draco asked, his voice higher than normal.
“That was because you kissed me, Seamus.”
“Uh, yes,” Ron said. He hung his head in shame. “Sorry.”
“Non lo so,” Massi says. Draco frowns at him, keeping up the pretense that he can’t understand Italian. “I don’t know.” Draco smirks and begins to move his hand up and down. Massi closes his eyes. “Si. Mi piace.” Draco doesn’t need to understand much Italian to know that he means yes.
“I could be Hercules!” It, of course, had
“It’s rather important to me.”
“What?” Harry cried. “Do you have that little faith in my abilities?”
“Now, I have heard some whispers through the grapevine that the Unspeakables are conducting their own investigation into The Reliquary, and I want you to get to it first. Our intelligence on Mr. Malfoy indicates that he lives at 34 Sorella Gardens. He appears to have a roommate.” She lifts the top piece of paper and peers at another sheet beneath it. “A Gregory Goyle.” Pansy is surprised by this information, but she does not let it show on her face. The last she had heard, Greg was in Azkaban, but clearly he was no longer there. She is not surprised that the two of them are still friends though. She doubts Greg has any other friends and she remembers how absurdly fond of Crabbe and Goyle Malfoy had been, even despite the fact that he had deliberately picked them as friends so that they could protect him from some of the older, meaner Slytherins.
“You like that?” he asked.
“But how did it even get here?”
“When you put it that way,” she said. She reached over and put a hand on his thigh. “I quite enjoyed those two days when I didn't have to speak to you.” His mouth fell open in surprise and she laughed.
“Is that what that was?”
“Won’t he find that suspicious?” Draco asks. He’s sure he would if he were in McLaggen’s shoes. Hermione shrugs.
“Great,” Harry says. “Lunch?”
“It’s not miles. It’s about a half hour’s brisk walk,” Harry protests. “And it’s a lovely one - down the Embankment.” Draco narrows his eyes in suspicion. “Plus, it’s a beautiful day,” Harry continues.
“What? Letting the students have a little fun?”
Draco sighed and put his glass down decisively on the table. “Look,” he said. “If it makes you feel any better, honestly, when I agreed to go out with you, I didn’t think I would like you so much.”
“Draco Malfoy and Pansy Parkinson to the manager’s office.” Big Dick’s voice booms around the store. Draco and Pansy look at each other. Draco shrugs.
His mother had been an Auror and had died during the First Wizarding War, the year before Chester started at Hogwarts. His father, the influential Rex Davies, had been so heartbroken from losing his wife that he had retired from wizarding life. He had lived as a recluse in a small Muggle village, not far from their family home. After a few years, he had fallen in love with a Muggle woman from the village and married her.
“Of course.” This morning felt like forever ago now. He had entirely forgotten they’d brought brooms and was glad that Blaise had remembered to carry them out when they left: or else their broomsticks would have been another three things they’d be having to find now. He tossed Blaise the other old broomstick and he caught it.
“Shit. How?”
“Are you sure? I can stay up with you.”
She shuts the door behind her with a click. Draco starts to reach for the nearest hairbrush, but Harry shakes his head. Draco frowns in confusion for a moment before the curtains at the end of the room twitch and two women come out from behind them.
Presently a timer goes off in the kitchen, and Ron excuses himself to finish putting everything together. Hermione offers to help, but Ron waves her away.
“Holly wreath,” Harry said and she swung open to let them in. The common room was empty and the fire was down to coals.
“Oliver Wood.” Parkinson practically spits out the name.
“And where is this Malfoy now?”
“We don’t want any Death Eaters going to check on the repairs and coming through the cabinet before we have a chance to put our plans into action. It’s going to have to be fixed on the night of.”
“And who are they?”
“This is a very interesting proposal,” Signore Battaglia says. “Yes, I’ve heard through other sources that the break up of Gringotts has been good for various enterprises, what with the regulatory affairs people having to spread themselves so thinly to audit them all.” Draco had not heard that and files away that information with interest while he nods enthusiastically.
“No, but that was fun,” Ron countered. “Talking with glee about people dying is not fun. It’s mean.”
“If the information has been reported somewhere, and that information has been fed back the Reliquary, it might. But if they’re a secret society within the Ministry, I doubt the Ministry’s reporting on them.”
“What?” he snaps.
“And then McLaggen got all upset because the Ministry’s going to have to investigate because Harry had used magic, even though it was clearly a Muggle murder.”
Draco leads Big Dick back to his office and makes him a cup of tea. It takes half an hour, but the man finally calms down. At that point, another member of the DMLEHS comes in and shows Big Dick a picture of the thief and asks him to recount showing the man the rare book collection a few days prior. Draco takes this opportunity to leave.
This is a terrible idea. He should not be doing this. He shouldn’t even want to be doing this. And yet, he can’t stop himself. He doesn’t want to stop himself.
“Cormac McLaggen.”
“What base spirit? I’ll surprise you.”
“Sorry,” McLaggen says, throwing up his hands in surrender. “You weren’t a great student, so I always wondered.”
“Tough shit,” Harry said, and turned to the bench where he proceeded to julienne the dragon’s blood leaves that they needed to add.
“Just offering to do you a favor.” Draco narrows his eyes. In his experience, favors didn't come without things asked in return. He doesn’t know what Harry is playing at.
“Pansy, the security of the magical community is potentially at stake here,” he says. Her mouth twists in irritation but she nods.
“It’s always too long, Har’,” Seamus says. “So when Hannah invited me, I just couldn’t say no.”
.” Harry stopped pacing and turned to Draco.
“How did it happen?” Ron asked. “This whole dating thing, I mean.”
just tell you. It’s not the easiest thing to bring up in conversation, you know.”
She was predictably taciturn and so with help from Hermione, he trapped her in place using a salt circle. He felt rather bad for resorting to such means, but they were starting to get desperate.
“I’m sure you are.”
“You’re just lucky I’m not going to press charges,” Draco says. He reaches over, picks up his Manhattan and takes a big swig of it. It helps to deaden the angry pounding in his ears. He wants nothing more than to have Massi arrested for what he did, but he’s got whatever it is the Battaglia family wanted to steal and they need to see where he leads them with it.
“Why not take her down?”
Draco’s heart is hammering in his chest and he is worried he will falter on the walk to the house. But somehow, he manages it. And then he stares up at the Manor itself. All grey stone and gothic architecture. The doors open, seemingly of their own accord, but as he and Potter cross the threshold, a house elf peeks out from behind the oak.
“We do?” Draco asks.
“Mm,” Hermione says. “We’ll find out in the morning.”
“Dobby,” he asked as the elf made his way back over, carrying four, clinking potion bottles. “Do you always have these?” He waved the doughnut.
Draco sits opposite him. He is wearing a red sweater over a collared shirt and has a tweed jacket over the top. He looks very English. His hair is freshly washed and lightly tousled. It looks incredibly soft and Harry wants nothing more than to run his hands through it. Instead he contents himself with reaching across the table and holding Draco’s hand. His chest feels like it’s filled with warmth as he watches a smile spread across Draco’s face.
After spending the first few courses on edge - he barely tasted the caviar course - the wine started to help Harry relax.
“Thanks,” Blaise said, but Harry was already gone. He landed by the door and picked up his Firebolt. It felt so much lighter in his hands in comparison to the other broom. He picked up Draco’s and Ron’s brooms as well and, lugging the three broomsticks with him, took off again. Hermione declined a broom, so Harry gave the other two brooms to Pansy and Ron, and then carried Draco’s over to him.
“I suppose you could think of it that way,” Hermione mused. She watched as Blaise thought about his next move, idly twisting a strand of hair around her finger.
“I’m going up to the common room,” he said to no one in particular, and then gathered up his things. He made his way slowly up to the common room, mentally preparing himself for the verbal barrage that was sure to greet him when Ron arrived.
“Parkinson, I know he’s an Unspeakable,” McLaggen says.
“Ok,” he says.
“You mean, you didn’t add me the moment I came over?” he asks, a smirk on his face.
“I just worry-“ Hermione starts to say.
“I am aware.” Draco stares at Potter for a moment, a serious look on his face, and then he cracks a similar smile. “I am not averse to muggle transportation, you know.”
memorized the diagrams, just not their numbers. He had wanted to be prepared. But now he was worried that he was going to think about everything too clinically. Tab A fits in Slot B and so forth. Well, there was nothing for it, but to go for it. It was time to pretend that he was a Gryffindor and that he had courage oozing from his pores, or whatever. He grabbed Harry and rolled the brunet on top of himself. Then he lifted his legs and wrapped them around Harry’s waist.
“No wonder you lot stay out of trouble.”
“Gonna have to work on these guns then,” he says. Then he looks up at them and grins. “You know, if I might make it into the paper.”
“I’ll keep you warm,” Harry says. He threads his arms under Draco’s cloak and pulls him close.
“Oh.”
“It was McLaggen’s idea.”
“I didn’t think horcruxes could be made with living creatures,” Hermione mused.
“For you, yes.” Massi’s face is open. His brown eyes are wide and hopeful. His face is framed by the gentle waves of his hair. His lips are pink from where he’s been chewing on them. And so Draco calls him on it.
“Dunno,” she said. “But we don’t have anything else to go on right now.”
“It doesn’t seem to be,” she said without looking up. “Or I think you would have felt it when you pulled it out of the Sorting Hat.”
“What’s that?” Draco looked up at Harry who had just walked back out of the fitting room.
Neville’s mouth turned downwards as he considered the bottle. His head throbbed again and this was the catalyst to him popping open the top and taking a tentative sip.
“Spaniel?” Harry blushed.
“Thanks for just telling everyone, Greg,” Draco mutters. Greg shrugs.
“Oh, come on, Harry,” Draco said. “Live a little. I thought you Gryffindors were supposed to be courageous.”
“Everything.”
“Aren’t you?”
“Unless you two decide to fly,” Hermione said. “We’ve decided it’s best if we walk.”
and sees Luna Lovegood standing there. She is dressed as a multicolored unicorn. An uncomfortable knot forms in Draco’s stomach. He hasn’t seen Lovegood sine the war. Anytime she has come into the bookstore, he has hidden in the back room, too ashamed to face her after his family kept her in their cellar for months.
Draco shrugs out of his shirt and feels Harry’s hands on his torso. He pulls away from Massi and jerks his head towards Massi. Harry understands the unspoken communication and presses his mouth to Massi’s. Draco pulls Massi’s shirt off of his shoulders and Massi lets him. The Italian’s hand scrabble maladroitly with Harry’s buttons but eventually gets them undone. Massi pulls away from Harry and pushes him towards Draco.
So they continue to enjoy themselves. They ski until their thighs feel like jelly; they make fleeting friends with fellow vacationers; they drink until everything is funny.
“I’m not sure,” she says. “It’s an open ended assignment.”
“Uh, I mean, I’ve, uh, never…” he trailed off. His eyes left her face as he blushed scarlet.
Draco’s thoughts are interrupted by Potter’s pocket bursting into tinny song. He frowns and watches as Potter pulls out a mobile phone. Draco does his best to hide his amusement. It is exactly the mobile phone he would expect Potter to have — one of those Nokia 3310 bricks: practically indestructible and as unfashionable in this day of age as his clothes were all throughout Hogwarts. As he looks closer, he sees that it does at least have a personalized case — a gold lion on a crimson background, the bloody Gryffindor — but the phone itself is still outdated.
“Probably. Though I get the feeling this was more Dumbledore’s idea than Snape’s. Not that he’s an unfeeling person - just that he’s probably more interested in our potions being brewed correctly rather than us getting along. I was talking to one of the seventh years and he said last year Snape hadn’t gone across houses with his pairings.”
He knows he needs to pull himself together. Croaker is going to need him for the investigation into why his partner went rogue. Harry had known Oliver was a good spy, but Merlin he hadn't thought he was so good as to catch Harry with his trousers down like this. Harry had thought they talked to each other about most things, but clearly there had been parts of Oliver’s life that Harry didn't know anything about.
“Minerva, do you really think that Aberforth would just let students into his pub without telling me?”
His sentimental thoughts are interrupted by the arrival of dessert. One minute, there is nothing in the middle of the table and the next there is a towering cake covered in whipped cream, chocolate shavings and cherries.
“Sanitizing your suitcase so that we can bring it inside safely.” Potter’s voice is muffled by the mask he’s wearing. Draco nods and Potter leaves the house, shutting the door quickly behind him. Draco stays on the floor, idly tracing a finger around the top of his phone.
“It wouldn’t be very secure if you could just get the secrets out of someone’s head once you’d captured them, would it?”
“Yes.”
“Which brings us to what we think the Society is doing.”
“Fine. I
“Yeah, alright.”
“Why are you bartending at all?” Harry asked. “I would have thought that you would think this was beneath you.”
Draco's stomach flipped at the question, and his eyes dropped to his hands. "Yes sir. I needed to fix a cabinet."
“Does it really matter? I just want it,” Potter responded with a shrug.
Draco couldn't agree more, but he didn't say as much. Instead, he nodded. "Thank you, Minister."
"That sometimes you don’t realize how cutting your words or actions are, Draco," he said firmly.
The King looked at the wizard warily. “You can fix this?” he asked.
“Good. Because as soon as you convince father tomorrow, we’re going to be betrothed, and if you look at another guy, I’ll have to have you convicted of treason for betraying your future king,” he said smugly.
Apparently the Queen agreed. “This is ridiculous. Draco…”
“Who else would I ever trust that way, Harry? No one. Just you.”
Draco huffed without thinking, and another puff of smoke filled the air.
"What? No, father…"
Weasley sighed, but he didn’t stop them as they made their way up the stairs. Once Potter had shown Draco to the sitting room, he let Draco enter first, closing the door behind them. “So…what’s this about, Malfoy?”
"Please. Let her know I'm thinking of her?"
Draco starts a new story about memory and friendship.
“I simply had trouble sleeping, mother,” he assured her.
"At what time did you take his Mark?"
Potter blinked at him. “Honestly? I’d hoped…you’d ask me to stop. Or to help.”
“Who?” Pansy stood and moved to Draco’s side. “Oh. Blaise. But…who is that girl with him? I thought you said…”
Draco nodded, but he was beginning to panic. He couldn’t seem to move. Every doubt he had ever had about this came to him all at once. What if Harry didn’t like the way he looked under his clothes? He was far too pale and skinny, not muscular and tan like his friend. And what if he did or said the wrong thing? How would he ever face Harry again?
Potter tugged him close, and Draco noted a flash of annoyance that somewhere along the way, Potter had gotten taller than him. Not much, but enough that he had to look up into those bright green eyes.
Harry had been kissing him, and when he’d pulled away, he’d been wearing a robe that Draco had never seen the like of in a deep red with gold trim. He’d whispered about how he’d waited for Draco to come to him for so long, and that he had no intent to wait any longer. He’d lowered Draco to the ground before a large oak where the two had played when they’d been boys, and then…
Finally, Harry stretched out beside him, kissing him softly as his fingers moved. Draco’s whimpers soon turned to moans, and then Harry was above him once more. “Say it again,” he whispered roughly to Draco, and after a moment, Draco’s lust-fogged mind remembered the words. “Harry, please…be my First?”
“So the Sim Soc kidnapped Swinn and you think they might have also kidnapped Hermione and replaced her with one of their own? Which means we can’t
“You two are precious,” she says. She smiles at them, a warm, motherly smile and Draco feels his irritation melting away, replaced instead with a more mild irritation that he hadn’t come out to his parents earlier. It would have saved him so much heartache.
It has been several days since their ill-fated “date”, where Harry had let slip that he would rather be on a date with someone else, and in that time, Harry has been just as “hands on” as he has needed to be to keep up the charade of their relationship, but nothing more. Just as many “impromptu” make out sessions against the bookshelves of Flourish and Blotts, but no more than that. It’s almost as if Draco’s mentioning dating someone else has reminded Potter that yes, in fact, he would rather be with someone - anyone - else. Which is to say that it has been rather miserable.
“I have things to show you,” he says.
“Guess so.”
There’s a commotion down the corridor and a moment later Hermione bursts into the room.
“Spaniel,” Draco said after staring at his book for a long moment. “I task you with getting our ingredients. Lavender and kitten’s whiskers please. ASAP.”
“Don't get me wrong, I wanted the credit for bringing him in, but I didn’t want to be stuck with him.” Parkinson turns to Malfoy. “No offense, but sometimes you can be a right pain in the arse.”
“What?” McLaggen blinks at Pansy, stunned from the slap.
“The pleasure of your company.”
“But have your parents?”
This started a snowball fight that lasted all of the walk to Hogsmeade so by the time they strolled into the little village, they were bright eyed and happy, albeit damp.
“You're what?” Draco asked.
Feedback, as ever, is appreciated :D
“Freedom,” Pansy cried as they joined the rest of the group out in the village proper. She threw her arms in the air and spun in a circle. Harry could not help but grin at her exuberance.
“One of you can collect them tomorrow,” Massi says. “But right now.” He doesn’t finish his sentence, instead he leans forward to capture Draco’s lips.
“Continue kissing me?” He hazarded. Pansy smirked.
“Over here,” Harry said, tugging him towards one of the sinks. He peered down and located the sink with the small snake etched on it. He moved his head back and forth for a moment, trying to picture the etching as a real snake and then said, “Open up.”
“A funny thing happened,” Draco starts to say.
Harry starts slowly. At first he just flicks his tongue gently at the head and Draco is about to tell him he's a big fucking tease when he abruptly takes it into his mouth. And then Harry’s tongue is swirling around him as he gradually takes him in and Draco suppresses a moan, painfully aware that they are in a public restroom and someone could walk in on them at any time. Honestly, that just makes it more exciting.
Dinner was a somber affair particularly for a Friday evening. Most of the students were still subdued. Even
Dumbledore died on Friday. None of them were there, of course, but from what Madam Pomfrey told them, it had been peaceful. On Wednesday, Dumbledore had instructed Snape to lift the block on the curse in his hand and had been confined to the hospital wing, dosed up on pain potions until he’d slipped away. Harry had gone to see him on Thursday, at Dumbledore’s request, and Dumbledore had smiled at him and bequeathed him his wand. Harry had protested — who was he to Dumbledore anyway? — but Dumbledore had insisted.
“How illicit are we talking?”
The restaurant is mostly full when they arrive. Harry gives his name to the waiter and the man leads them to an empty table towards the back of the restaurant. Harry is a little bit tipsy from the wine, but not so much that he can’t concentrate on the purpose of his mission. They had not finished the bottle he had brought, but rather corked it with just over a glass and a half left. And Harry knows that food will help lessen his intoxication.
“Wonderful,” he says. The word rolls around his mouth like a marble. “You’re first-rate, you know that?”
“What was that?” Draco asks once the patronus has finished speaking and has vanished. Massi is pale but trying to play it off like nothing is wrong.
been surprised when Pansy had slapped him a second later. But, really, she hadn’t been all that surprised at that either.
“Um.”
For a moment, Malfoy looks at him blankly, but then Harry sees something in Malfoy’s posture shift as he almost imperceptibly stiffens in surprise and Harry’s heart sinks. The book is gone. Malfoy has read it. And in that moment, Harry knows that his mission has changed. Now, Malfoy is the asset, and thus is the thing that Harry will have to bring in to Croaker as soon as he possibly can. And to do that, he is going to need Malfoy to trust him. He quickly changes the subject, moving away from any work-related topics.
“Great,” Ron said. His enthusiasm had not been not dimmed by the follow up comment. He pulled Harry to the side of the hall and whispered his idea, then he stood back and watched Harry’s face for a reaction.
“Right, Potter,” she said. “This is to help with the pain and to promote the healing of the skin. I want you to use it for at least the next five days, and during that time you are to refrain from any nonessential contact down there.” She took a moment to stare pointedly at Harry and then, to Draco’s surprise, at Draco as well. “You took off several layers of skin with that spell, and skin takes time to grow back and heal - even for wizards. And as the area in question is a rather sensitive one, that I am
“Possibly.” Harry felt Draco hook his thumbs into the tops of Harry’s boxers. His breath caught in excitement, and then Draco eased them down around his thighs. He retaliated with Draco’s underwear. And then they stood there for a moment, panting and excited.
“But you’re one as well?” The snake said nothing, only blinked at him. “Isn’t that strange?” he continued after a moment. “To have one’s life tied to someone else’s?”
“Yes, yes, teamwork,” Draco said. “That’s assuming everything goes to plan.”
about my worries.” Narcissa’s face twisted in disgust. “She would just tell me that it’s an honor for you to be risking your life trying to—“ She stopped herself there, looking suddenly at Harry.
Draco is much less excited to be assistant manager at two am the next morning when he gets an urgent owl from Flourish and Blotts sent by their security wards stating that there has been a break in. He turns to shake Harry awake, but the brunet is already sitting up and blinking at him, clearing sleep from his eyes.
“Potter, wait,” he heard Draco call, but he ignored him. He was halfway up the chute now and he had no intention of turning back. “Where are you going?”
. But his stomach still flips over in a pleasant manner as Harry threads their fingers together. And Circe does his wish this were real.
“Where are we going to go?”
“We’ll just have to defeat him before then.”
“But why would he
“Ta,” Draco said. He caught the broom that Harry dropped and mounted it in one quick movement, soaring up to meet Harry’s height. Harry felt like he had probably done that to show off, and was suitably impressed. “Let’s find this Cup.”
"And your exact relation to the prisoner?"
"Of course! Though…you must never come at night. When she comes, it’s always night. And…I don’t know if she would be pleased to find out I've had visitors."
Padfoot snorted. “Well…it does fit his name…”
“He’ll follow just fine, Draco. Really. And you can walk with us most of the way, so you could even lead him, if you liked.”
“Nothing that special, but then, most of us don’t tend to make too much of a fuss over that sort of thing, really. Doesn’t mean as much to us as it would to you. Most don't even really believe that connection occurs.”
"Yes. I do." Even despite the gauntlet of passing the other cells. He couldn't handle being alone here with Harry any more.
Just as he was about to give up, he saw a young man about his own age on the road, two older men walking with him. This was his chance. Surely he would be able to defend himself against three.
The dog turned his great grey eyes on the man and muttered something, then set his head back on his paws, closing his eyes once more.
Draco rolled his eyes. “Oh, please, Potter. What I feel will never change. So you might as well pack up and go back to the Weasels and leave me be, because this is getting you nowhere.”
When Harry reappeared, he brought a peace offering.
Draco wasn’t sure if his friend was wishing him luck in finding someone, or in surviving the ball entirely. “Thank you. I’ll need it.” He smiled, then turned and headed back inside.
Potter shook his head. "Whatever you're up to."
"Did you ever think that maybe that’s
He stated it as though he had given me a boon. As though I should bow and scrape and thank him for this favour of favours. But I knew it even then for what it was—a death sentence. Even should I succeed—and how could I, a mere student, ever manage to kill the greatest wizard who ever lived?—there was no way I would make it out of the castle alive. The castle itself would rise up against me, surely?
Draco closed his eyes. Either way, he would lose the chance to know for certain. It was an unfair choice to make. "I can't—"
Harry glanced down at his hand. "What?"
“Lead me to the door? I don’t want to trip. Once inside, I should be fine.”
The members of the court turned to her in shock. Even the King could do no more than blink. Finally, he waved to their guests. “Thank you for coming. I think the Queen and I should retire now. But the feast is prepared, and we hope you will enjoy it, whether or not we are here.” The wizards all nodded and moved to seat themselves, and the King and Queen swept from the room, trying to comfort themselves that they would have at least eighteen good years with their son. Even though both knew it could never be enough.
“Because of your power?”
"Believe what you will, Potter," Draco said with a sigh. "You always do."
“Draco…” Lucius started warningly.
"Should I ask another question, then? I didn't mean to put you on the spot."
Lucius ignored him. “Very well. We will prepare a guard and a few servants to go with you and help you on the road, as you will have gifts for your impending nuptials to take back with you.”
As soon as Potter had finished his own bowlful, he stood up and dropped his bowl and utensil near Draco. “So, while I’m at the market, I’ll need you to clean the dishes and sweep out the place. And don’t forget to wash our clothes from the travel, pretty boy.”
“Looks like he’s getting ready to eat you,” Padfoot was saying, his sword still out.
At first, this ball seemed to be headed in the same direction as the first two. Simpering smiles from girls whose hands he kissed, and leering grins from the men. The most interesting point had been a pair of red-headed twins who had winked at him in tandem, grabbing his hands and kissing them before making their way back down the stairs. But the man who had followed…that was where everything had changed.
Potter shook his head. “No. I hate that place. I want to stay with you.”
The rest of the ball dragged by, and at the end, Draco waved off his parents, assuring him he was giving the matter due consideration, then headed off to bed.
Draco didn’t relax until they’d managed to fly out the window, and he could look back and see the tower fading away behind them. But even as he looked back, he heard the crack of someone appearing in the tower. He didn’t have to see the figure inside to know who had appeared. Instead, he tightened his arms and urged Harry to fly faster.
The current song came to an end and then Seamus’s voice rang out over the room.
“Potter didn’t tell you?”
In hindsight, he should have realized that he and Draco could not keep it a secret forever, so perhaps he should have started dropping small comments about how perhaps the Slytherin wasn’t nearly so bad as they all thought he was. But then that would have interfered with their plan to have a giant fight to convince everyone that it was business as usual between them.
“It’s complicated,” Harry said.
The conversation has moved on to more mundane topics, such as work, and Harry has let his mind wander, but now he realizes that they are all staring at him, so he snaps his attention back to the room.
“Yes, probably.”
The common room had emptied of the few other students who had stayed at school for the holiday and now it was just the six of them. That gave Harry the confidence to shuffle over to Draco on the couch and drape his legs over Draco’s lap. Draco wrapped an arm around Harry and pulled him close.
“Oh. I hadn’t noticed.”
“Harry, I-” he started to say.
He had forgotten how much he hated the feeling of Snape poking around in his mind. He gritted his teeth and concentrated on Quidditch.
He had been surprised that the laptop worked in the Cooler, but Draco had explained that it was one of Ernie’s hybrid models. He idly wondered it Ernie would be able to modify some of the bugs to run on magic, thereby making them usable in the Ministry. But then they would have to disclose the technology to the Ministry and it would be useless for tracking the Simurgh Society.
“I dunno,” he says. “Ask Wood why he sent it to you? Take it to work and see if any of the boffins there know anything about it? Either way, I wouldn’t open it.”
“Vaguely.”
“But when they got to the room where the bodies were, there was no sign of the assailant. Potter said that Malfoy looked out of the window to try to find the perp, but there was no trace of them. We combed that garden for evidence, but aside from some shards of glass, there was nothing. No blood, no fibers - nothing. Potter also said Malfoy had used
seems to wake him with the sun, whether or not he’s done sleeping.
“No,” she said. “I was referring to the Annual Slytherin Halloween Party. One of
“Oh, no,” she said quickly.
“From our research, we theorize that He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named created six horcruxes.” Here McGonagall clapped a hand over her mouth. “We also learned that Malfoy Senior had agreed to house a particular item for He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named and young Draco volunteered to steal it from his own house.”
“Yes,” he said confidently. Hermione turned to the others.
“What do you mean?”
“Yes,” he says so quietly that Draco can hardly hear him over the music.
“That man is plotting to kill someone tonight. At the Dorchester Hotel.” Another puzzle piece slides into place in Draco’s brain. “That Croatian diplomat. Heilgar Mott
“I’ll talk to Ron tomorrow - see if anything’s seemed amiss.”
“Thanks,” Draco says. He points his wand down at his ankle. “Episkey.” Instantly the pain that had been growing steadily while he had been sitting there dissipates. Greg straightens up and pulls Draco to his feet.
“Don’t be mean about Ron,” he says.
“Oh, and to create a secret path into the castle for the Death Eaters.”
“I absolutely would have said no,” Granger snaps.
Once they reach the Atrium of the Ministry, Pansy and Potter stare at each other. Neither of them are quite sure whose office to go to. Draco can tell from the way that they both sort of freeze once they reach the elevators. Potter even has his hand out to press the elevator call button, but is wavering between up and down. Draco decides to address the elephant in the room.
“Would you like a drink?” Potter asks. Draco considers this for a moment. He has already had a decent amount of wine tonight, but he also feels like he had most of the sobriety scared back into him by their mad dash out of the restaurant. He looks down at his hands in his lap and notices that they are shaking
“Well, I assume you were referring to the public drinking age of eighteen.”
“It was almost worse than when they did it on me.” Draco’s voice cracked and Harry looked up to see a single tear make its way down Draco’s cheek.
“Those dicks,” Harry muttered back.
“Fuck it,” Draco said. “Let’s all sit at the Gryffindor table.”
“How’s that special then?”
“So, Draco,” Massi says. He puts a hand on Draco’s knee. “You also enjoy a little dick?”
“Oh, mother, we can’t stay,” Draco starts to say.
“Right,” she says. “Now we will work on resisting the veritaserum. By now I’m sure you have felt the compulsion to tell the truth, yes?”
“That is correct,” Dumbledore said.
“Filthy blood traitor Potter,” the elf mumbles but there is no real venom behind it. Pansy bites back a laugh. The elf pushes two drinks towards her and she picks them up. She nods goodbye at Draco and makes her way back to Greg.
“I still should have noticed that my
“Yes?” he said.
They emerged in the Room of Requirement about fifteen minutes after they left the Hog’s Head. Dobby had clearly taken it upon himself to decorate while they were gone, because the room was festooned in streamers, tinsel, mistletoe and, Harry was embarrassed to see, the gold baubles from the year before that read “Have a Very Harry Christmas” with his face on them.
“Friends,” Draco says. “Of course.”
“And jealous.”
“Has anyone run magical signature tests?”
He spends his spare time at Flourish and Blotts pulling various defensive magic books off of the shelves and secreting them into his locker to read in his breaks. He practices trip jinxes on Luca and Joe, who are so accident prone that they do not notice. He takes advantage of the Ministry training rooms at the Cooler during his lunches, throwing up shields as the spell dummies hurl hexes at him. His after work runs get longer, though he now does them in the gym in the Cooler, rather than outside the way he had before. Harry had insisted for his safety, but had offered to run with him if he did want to run outside. So far Draco hasn’t taken him up on this offer. He’s not sure he wants to suffer the indignity of being slower than Potter on foot. (All those Quidditch losses still sting.)
“Possibly?” He grinned and his eyes sparkled. Hermione found herself blushing and she glanced down at her plate.
“I meant, why give it to me?” Snape sighed heavily and leaned back in his chair.
trained to be cool under pressure, but his stomach is trying itself in knots as he stands there and he is worried some of his concern shows on his face.
“You won’t want a copy?” Colin asked. Harry frowned at him, but there was no malice or suggestion around the question.
“No,” Draco says emphatically. “I’m tired of not knowing what’s going on.”
“Hey,” he cried. He wiped at his trousers with his sleeve while Hermione giggled.
“I know,” he said, once he pulled away. “I love you too.” Harry heard a small gasp behind him and he turned his head to see a small Hufflepuff girl staring at him with eyes the size of saucers. “Yeah,” he said. “I love him. Deal with it.”
“How have you not planned this out better?” Draco rounds on him. “Honestly, Potter, if this
“Would you prefer if I said shit?” Potter laughs again. “Fuck?”
A moment later, they appear in a darkened alleyway. They must be near wherever they’re going because Draco can hear the dull thump of the bass through the wall next to them. Harry, still holding Draco’s hand, drags him down the alley until they emerge on a larger street. Sure enough, the door to the club is a short distance from the alley. Draco makes to go stand in line, but Harry shakes his head and pulls him towards the front of the queue.
“That sounds more like a Dumbledore idea,” Harry said. Ron frowned.
“I will personally see to it,” Draco said. “That Harry will not die.”
“It’s going to be ok,” Harry said. “We have a plan.”
,” Pansy said. There was triumph in her voice.
“But how?” he asked. He wasn’t asking Dumbledore, more just wondering aloud, but Dumbledore took it as a question.
“Don’t document me too much, lad,” Seamus said. Colin laughed nervously.
“Ah, Malfoy,” Weasley says. “So you’re the reason we haven’t seen Harry in months.” Draco forces a smile onto his face.
“What?” she cries. “That’s not fair.” He smiles beatifically at her and she glowers at him as she hands over her whisky.
“I am too.”
“Shout out to Mr. Harry James Potter,” he said. “For organizing this evening’s activities.”
“Put your wands where we can see them,” comes a voice from the door. Draco’s eyes go wide in surprise. He stands, quickly taking stock of how bad this looks. He and Harry have been found in a house that doesn’t belong to them, leaning over a corpse. Draco can’t think of a single worse way for them to be found.
“I call bullshit on that. It’s 2008. You’re allowed to like whoever you like.”
“I just stunned him,” Draco says. “He never even saw me.”
“I can help you with the cabinet.”
But your reviews do prompt me to write (hint hint!), so if you're enjoying this please let me know.
“I’ll put it on the board,” Pansy says. The board is now several boards, spanning the entire length of the room. In fact, Chester has his own entire section. Pansy walks over and writes Millie Davies’s name on a piece of paper and pins it on Chester’s board.
“Right,” said Harry. “I always forget.” But he grinned at Draco nonetheless.
Draco listens and takes notes as they traverse the various rooms, asking the occasional question here and there. He is amazed when they reach the drawing room and he sees the tapestry of the Black Family Tree. It’s even grander than the one back at the Manor, which is saying something. His eyes travel the familiar branches until he finds his own name.
“I wonder if someone should seduce Roger.” Cormac, who has just taken a sip of his beer, spits some out in surprise. It dribbles down his chin and he wipes it away quickly with the back of his sleeve. Pansy glares at him briefly. “What?”
Even Professor Snape had seemed willing to go easy on them, though Harry wasn’t sure if this was because he was giving them a treat, or because he’d been grievously injured during the battle and had needed the time to recuperate. He’d been found a few hours after Harry had entered the Great Hall, bleeding profusely from a neck wound he’d sustained from Fenrir Greyback, and had been rushed to St. Mungo’s after Madame Pomfrey had stabilized him. From what Harry had heard, he would be spending a grudging summer with Remus on the off chance he did turn into a werewolf come the full moon.
“What?” Draco spat out part of his drink in surprise.
At one point, Draco can see that it must have been a grand hall. He can imagine it back in its hey day, lined with portraits —the lack of which can be guessed at from the uneven fading on the wallpaper— and reflections from the lamps shining off the gold accents on the wallpaper. But now the wallpaper is peeling and the carpet is threadbare.
“You know how the owner of the-“
“Hello, Amelia.” He looks around the room for another chair. When he doesn’t find one, he conjures one for her and places it on his side of the desk. Draco notices that it is nicer than the chairs that the rest of them are sitting on.
“Draco, I’m sure you remember Ginny,” he says. Ginny holds out her hand and Draco takes it without hesitation.
For a long moment, Harry just holds it and looks at it. It is all Draco can do not to thrust into his hand. But he keeps his hips still and looks down at Harry.
“You need to give me more to work with than ‘not stuffy’, Potter,” Draco says.
“What?”
“They what?” Draco is flabbergasted, but Harry just shrugs.
“Neville?” Seamus asked. “Partner?” Neville seemed surprised that anyone had asked him and so quickly agreed. His confidence in potions had grown since his Ehwaz potion had turned out so well.
“I suppose if you put it that way,” Harry says slowly.
“It’s not really Greg’s thing, is it?” Hannah asks. Draco shakes his head, grateful that he doesn’t have to come up with another reason why he hadn’t brought this up around Greg. “We’ll just have to gush excitedly about it when he’s not around. And gush we will. Oh, this is exciting, Draco! We’ll have to have the pair of you over for dinner. Of course, working around Harry’s busy schedule. Sometimes I wonder how you find time to see him. But I suppose that’s why he took you on a month’s long vacation.” Draco takes a long sip of his beer as Hannah chatters on. Greg returns to his seat next to Draco.
“Am not.”
“Can I stay with you til then?”
a bit of a swot,” Pansy said as she and Ron walked up to their group.
“You’re hilarious.”
“You have to give me this recipe,” Draco says. “These potatoes are incredible.”
“Fine.” Draco turned away and began pacing. Harry understood his feelings - really, he did - but something was telling him that this passage was going to lead somewhere useful. The Room had never yet failed him. Sure enough, Ron came flying back into the room two minutes later, a huge grin on his face.
“I found I have a lot more in common with Blaise and Pansy,” he said.
land me in the papers.”
“Why not?”
“Am I not talking dirty correctly?” he asked.
“Do I get a say in this?” Draco asks.
Draco makes his way over to one of the sinks, and splashes water on his face before taking in his reflection in the mirror. He looks tired and his skin feels dry after the two and a half hours in the car. He runs a hand through his hair and it falls limply back down. He tidies it quickly back into its normal side part and then walks back into the bedroom.
“But what if it could?”
“We’re in a fucking closet, Potter. And it’s not even cold.”
“-No.” On this, he was vehement.
either.”
Surprise was off the table as Nagini paused near the bookshelf where the (now fake) cup was resting. She turned to look at him and hissed,
But time won’t heal what he feels for Draco. Because the more time he spends with Draco, the stronger his feelings for the blond become. It’s the same as it was in school, only the polar opposite. While at Hogwarts, the more time he spent with Draco, the more he despised him. Now, the more time he spends with him, the more he likes him. And he can’t
“Clothes, preferably,” Harry says. He has changed into black jeans and a black button down.
“It’s your department,” she mutters.
“True,” Harry said. “He does at the very least teach us practical things, which I would bloody well hope that he would as these are our N.E.W.Ts.”
I will be adding songs to it as I post each chapter, so currently it's 2 songs long, but it will change :)
“Dobby!”
“Uh, yes. Of course,” he said. “Are you?” Pansy smirked.
“It was?” Draco sniffed. Harry nodded. He lifted Draco’s face up and kissed his cheek, tasting the salty tears on his cheek.
“Sorry, sorry.”
“Of course.” She nodded, satisfied.
“Morning,” he says, nodding at her.
“Fine,” Harry said. “We’re dating.”
“Yes.”
“What was that?” he asks, smiling politely at Lucius.
trust me?
“Good,” he says instead. “Big Dick will like that.” Joe makes a face to indicate that he does not care what Big Dick thinks of their performance, but Draco knows it is just an act. All of the employees are very loyal to the man, possibly because he had seen something in all of them where no one else had even bothered to look.
Harry stared over at the Slytherin table wistfully. He wanted to go over there as well, but he had the feeling a few more people might wonder why he would be sitting with Slytherins. Seamus at least had a reputation of being friendly, and sometimes rather more than friendly, with everyone.
I know this is ridiculously late and I am so sorry about that. I was busy writing and throwing a Harry Potter Murder Mystery party and that took ALL of my time. It was worth the effort though :)
“I’ll make sure of it,” Pansy says.
“Oh, I have no idea,” Harry says, dispelling this idea. “I just figure that if I’m out in a public place, they must be hiding somewhere.”
“I am as shocked as anyone, but yes.”
“Hermione,” Draco said, changing the subject. “Can you check over my arithmancy equations later?”
