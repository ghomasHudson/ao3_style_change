Hermione gave him a watery smile. "Ohh Harry! I do not know what you would do without me as well. And I am just as lucky to have you in my life." She chuckled.
"I hope you sleep well, Mother." Draco smiled at his mother as she gracefully went up the stairs.
Everyone was smirking at Pansy, even Severus. Finally, Pansy recovered. “You are telling me that we could have had the Saviour of the Wizarding World in our snake pit? This is unbelievable! If he had been in our house, maybe we would not have been so hated. Argh! How could you, Draco? You just could not behave yourself. You just had to go and antagonise the one person who could have redeemed the reputation of our house!” She sneered at her best friend.
The Golden Trio walked out of Evermore Trinkets and went back to the Floo. They arrived back at Grimmauld Place and sat down in the sitting room.
"I think so. MOINE? Do we have time for Harry tonight? She says 'yes'."
Physically recovered Harry straightens his back, inhales deeply. “Not exactly what you expected to wake up with last night, huh?” Self-irony is still the best self-protection.
Drew takes the (bloody obvious) hint. Impatiently he also pulls on Harry’s trousers. Harry wraps his legs around Drew’s back so he can lift his ass, and his trousers together with his underwear is gone, flapping audibly on the floor but other than that receives no further notice.
"Okay, good.  At that point I really would have doubted my human knowledge. I love you both but... I don't think it’d be a fit. Speaking of, anyone here to your liking then?"
Harry can well imagine Siora eagerly and at the same time desperately fluttering up and down the pane, hoping to find an opening or at least a surface to land on.
“A pleasure! The name rings a bell, but I just can’t grasp where I´ve heard it yet.”
"Sure," he says, fetching a tray with hot water, cups and various teas from the kitchen. Ron has also joined them at the table on his return.
“You’re wearing my trousers”, Drew observes and Harry blushes.
"Accio glasses", he tries a wandless spell. Nothing happens. Exasperated he sits up.
Falk pops his head between the two. "Who is who's?"
“You notice it?”, Harry wonders, as he himself has never seen this owl, and gets up, to let it in. The bird lands on Harry’s stretched out lower arm and obediently holds up its claw, where a little note has been attached.
But this was 4 years ago. Now that his everyday work has come to a routine and he has found himself a very nice flat in Wizarding London, that was not filled with painful memories as Grimmauld Place was, now that he has a steady group of friends, and a steady psyche and, yeah, practically a settled life… he was ready and open for a relationship. If it wasn’t for his prominence and the stuck-up wizarding world concerning same sex relationship.
“Harry, I mustn’t! I already said too much. Even if I knew, which I uprightly don’t, I wouldn’t tell you. And I will not try to find out. That would only make it more uncomfortable.”
Harry smiled softly at the house elf. “Could you set up two extra bedrooms? Narcissa resurrected my parents, Sirius and Remus and they’re staying here.”
Hermione pulled Harry and Ron out in the open and it seemed like the Polyjuice worked. No one was rushing up to them for autographs.
He pushed the tea aside and leaned forward and kissed Harry lovingly. When he started to pull away, Harry placed his hand at the back of Draco's head and pulled him back into a more passionate kiss. By the time they stopped kissing, their tea was stone cold.
Once Severus was ready, he went to say goodbye to Narcissa. “I am heading out. I am not sure when I shall return.” He smiled at her.
Draco squeezed Harry's hand back. "I'm glad we both enjoy each other's company. Next time we should have a seekers game. Let me walk you out." He reluctantly released Harry's hand. He stood up and started walking back to the terrace with Harry following behind.
Narcissa smirked. “Well, it looks to me that your little date with your witch went smashingly well considering that smile plastered on your face right now. Please do share the details.” She looked at him curiously.
As Harry slowly fell asleep, all his senses were consumed by Draco.
Once the tea was ready, they sat in the sitting room.
Severus flinched a bit. "A great many things have changed since I first met you, Hermione. If you will let me, I will explain myself as best I can."
Draco had watery eyes. “Love, you are the best thing that has ever happened to me. I love you beyond life itself. And I look forward to becoming your husband someday. No one else compares to you and our future life together.” He kissed Harry softly.
After Harry put the kettle on the stove he turned around in Draco's arms so he was facing him. They stared at each other for what seemed like an eternity. Harry wrapped his arms around Draco's neck and pulled him closer. Their lips were just inches apart. Both leaned forward until their lips were finally touching. At first it was a soft, tentative kiss. As the kiss continued it got more passionate as if they craved each other's touch. They were in their own little world until the kettle whistling broke the trance and they pulled apart embarrassed a bit. Harry made up the tea and put on the kitchen table. Both sat in silence at the table. They sipped at their tea.
"Yes I do like you too. You better start believing it because it's definitely true. I wouldn't lie about something like this. It's not a joke, I swear. I really do like you and want to be your boyfriend at some point in the future. As for our friends it would be too shocking for them to understand if we were together right away. I think we should all get together sometime. You, me, Hermione, Ron, Blaise and Pansy I mean. I want to get to know your friends. I hope they will eventually accept me into your life." Harry said wistfully.
Harry nudged Hermione. “It’s perfect. I know he’d love it. How much is it?”
James huffed. “Bloody hell! Why the fuck am I in Malfoy Manor of all places? Am I in Hell or something?” He continued to curse under his breath.
Draco chuckled. “I do not wish to disturb your highness but I also do not want to make Mother sore.”
Narcissa pulled away and gave him a small smile. “It was worth the risk. I wanted to give you the best possible wedding gift.”
Harry had tears welling up in his eyes and he brushed them away. “I don’t know what to say. I could never regret helping you and Draco out. Even if there was a way to pay me back, I wouldn’t accept it. Just having Dray with me is enough for the rest of my life. I’ve grown to love you both, obviously in different ways. You’re family.”
Draco pulled Harry back into bed and Harry rolled over to face Draco. “If you would like we could get some more sleep.” He caressed Draco’s cheek.
Narcissa huffed out a chuckle. "Draco, stop being overdramatic. It will be fine whether there is an article or not. Remember, Harry does not care what the press think of him. He has never cared all that much. I am sure that line of thinking still stands. He cares for you deeply and he would never allow anyone, especially the press, influence him otherwise. Just go to him and forget the potential consequences. I am sure it would be a happy surprise to see you again."
Draco stuttered to think of something to say. "I do not want to seem too eager because I will look like a daft fool. And you know I can not deal with that."
Draco nodded and hopped into the bed and adjusted to get comfortable. "Harry, you can come into the bed now." He gave a reassuring smile.
Once everyone got over the initial shock, Severus observed his surroundings and Harry curiously. "Well, Potter I presume you survived another killing curse and you were able to defeat Voldemort and the war is over considering this office looks to be in better shape and all of you no longer look filthy." He snarked.
Harry nodded. “I can’t argue with that. Mum, Dad, Sirius and Remus you’re welcome to come stay at Grimmauld Place with Draco and I. I can have Kreacher set up bedrooms for you.” His parents, Sirius and Remus nodded in agreement.
Draco scoffed at him. As he was about to respond, the floo chimed and Hermione poked her head out. "Sorry for the intrusion but you might want to look out your front door, Harry. Though that was not the real reason for my visit. It appears that Ron still has not changed his tune about you and Draco sadly. And this is after Molly scolding him for his behaviour. He is being so unbelievably stubborn and unreasonable about this. I just thought I would warn you about the nonexistent progress regarding Ron. Ohh sorry for my rudeness, hello Draco! It is nice to see you again." She smiled warmly at Draco.
Narcissa looked at him curiously. “Speaking of my darling son how is he fairing living with you? I hope he is content.”
Harry giggled softly. "You're kinda cute when you're nervous." He blurted out. He then felt his face heat up quite a bit. "I mean to say I'd like to stay longer. I enjoy your company surprisingly."
Harry, Draco, Hermione and Severus all watched Ron intently as he walked to them.
Draco pulled Harry closer to him. “I missed you today. And I am glad you had a good day with your friends.”
Draco looked surprised by how the Weasleys weren't concerned. "I'm relieved to know they trusted me with your well being. Blaise is one of the few very open to meeting you. He always wanted to be friends with you and admonished me for being awful to you and your friends. He will be happy that I made amends with you. And yes I agree time flies when you are having fun. I do not remember the last time I lost track of the time when spending time with someone. It is refreshing. Thank you for coming by for afternoon tea with Mother and I. I really enjoyed spending time with you. We should do this again sometime."
Both finished their tea and Hermione put everything on the counter. “Sev, let us go to the sitting room.” She held out her hand for him to take and without hesitation he did as she led them out of the kitchen.
Harry playfully smacks her on the arm and smiles widely. "I'll tell you how it goes and give you a good laugh. I would love to talk to you more but sadly I'm pretty knackered."
Narcissa smiled at them. "Ohh Severus calm yourself! I am sure there is a reasonable explanation as to why they shared a bed. Let them explain, please."
"I'll be sure to do that the next time I see Andromeda. Enjoy the rest of your day as well." He waved back and followed Draco to the front door.
Harry looked Ron. “I’ve never been more sure of something than Draco. So will you go?” He looked at floor nervously.
As the tea whistled, Harry stood in front of Draco and smiled encouragingly. "You really shouldn't worry so much. Everything will work out. Now let's have some tea, shall we?" Draco nodded.
Draco brought Harry’s hand to his lips for a soft kiss. “Good night, love.” He whispered.
Harry thought about Draco and could not wait until he returned from visiting Severus and Narcissa. He thought of what he was going to say as he proposed to Draco. He felt like he was vibrating, that’s how excited he was for tonight.
Harry contemplated what to say next. "Funny story. It turns out when we were separated during the beginning of the war she became interested in Luna Lovegood. Like you, I thought we were forever or something."
Hermione just stared at him dumbfounded. “Of course I will help you but I do not understand what has gotten you into this frenzy. Please explain.”
Draco sheepishly looked at Pansy. “I was trying to impress him, Pans! At the time I did not know that he was treated like a house elf at his relatives’ home. I seriously thought everyone worshipped him. None of that was true though. He did not even know he was a wizard until Hagrid told him. How was I to know?” He frowned at Pansy.
Hermione grimaced. "Ohh Harry! You could always ask Minerva, Dumbledore's portrait and Snape's portrait for any memories about the Marauders. I am sure they would be happy to talk to you. It would not be the same but maybe it would still be helpful to you."
Draco rolled over after feeling movement on the bed and opened his eyes to his Harry swatting a freakishly odd owl. “Bloody hell, Potter! Why is there an owl in our bed?” He glared at the owl for disturbing his sleep.
Draco was not sure how to respond. "My father was upset I was not into women in general since he wanted to continue the Malfoy name. He always said he did not raise his son to be an abomination. He wanted to force me to marry a woman and have, at least, have one child with her. I guess I should thank you for not helping him during his trial. Otherwise, I would not be able to live my life the way I want to. My mother never took issue with my sexual preferences. She just wanted me to find love and be happy. And it was not Diggory either. Though he is also easy on the eyes." He said at ease.
Hermione blushed. "I am so incredibly embarrassed by my behaviour. I am so sorry and thank you Severus for helping me." She smiled shyly.
Kreacher’s eyes bulged a bit and nodded. “Oh yes Master Harry! Kreacher would be pleased to do that for you.” He popped out again.
Harry reached down and grasped both of their erections in one hand. They shuddered as he stroked slowly at first. The pace became faster as they got into a rhythm. Harry leaned down and kissed Draco feverishly as they were coming undone by Harry’s hand.
Harry could not hold on any longer. “Drayyyyy!” He screamed as they came so hard at the same time.
Hermione looked pleased. "Actually not much. It looks to me that Dumbledore modified a resurrection spell. The original spell can be performed at any time during a witch's or wizard's lifetime but Dumbledore modified it so when Harry retrieved your memories and when you died, it activated the spell and a doe figurine was formed. That was all I found unfortunately."
After they took the Polyjuice, they waited for the changes to occur. Once they had, the Golden Trio vanished into the Floo. After a moment, they arrived in Diagon Alley.
"Believe it or not he does feel the same but we are going to just be friends for now. At least until our friends accept our friendship. We are taking it slow. We both think that is best." Draco said thoughtfully.
Narcissa finally decided to put a stop to the pacing. "Draco, darling, you really need to stop. I am sure whatever is on your mind you will figure it out."
Draco looked at Lucius. “Hello, Father. It has been awhile. I have come to update you with the goings on in my life. I have something to say and I need to get it out so please do not interrupt me. Besides, you owe it to me to pay attention to what I have to say after the hell you have put me and Mother through over the years.” He handed Lucius some chocolate who ate the chocolate immediately.
Severus gave her hand a gentle squeeze. "I am delighted that everything worked with your parents and they were not too cross with you. You were quite fortunate to find a way to slip away from being a relationship with Weasley so easily. Most are not that lucky."
When the morning light shone through the bedroom window, Draco started to stir. Once he was awake, he realised that there was something warm pressed up against his back. At first, he was startled but remembered what happened last night. He smiled because he was Harry's boyfriend.
Pansy huffed out a sigh. “Bloody hell, fine! Have it your way, Saviour. I will try to do my best to leave the past in the past but I am not making any promises. And if you ever break my Draco’s heart, you will wish you never came back to life in the battle.” She looked smug because Harry looked a bit terrified.
A couple days had past since Draco saw Harry and he could not decide on what to say in his letter about getting together again. He kept pacing which in turn made Winky very nervous and of course Narcissa found it quite amusing.
Hermione smiled at him. "Oh Harry! No matter what you can count on us. I am pleased that we got to share this with you as well." Ron nodded in agreement.
Draco contemplated why his mother scurried off before he had a chance to ask her a question about her reaction to him telling her about Potter coming to afternoon tea. Not knowing the reason made him even more nervous about tomorrow. As he got ready for sleep he knew all too well that he would not able to sleep well, wondering why he was nervous and thinking about his mother's curious reaction. Once his head hit the pillow, he could not stop thinking about Potter and how they would be around each other. Truth be told, he actually couldn't wait to see his ex-rival. After hours of overthinking, he finally fell asleep and unknowingly started dreaming of Potter.
Harry sighed. “I can’t believe how god awful he’s become. I’m so sorry for how he treated you all. I’m ashamed to admit he was once my friend. I don’t really know how to react but good on you Hermione for punching him. He most certainly deserved it. Also I hope you do owl Molly.” He frowned.
She shook her head. "No, just this peculiar letter appeared on my desk after you and Draco arrived. It is in Dumbledore's handwriting. It is for Draco."
"I really don’t get, why you're not looking for a relationship, Harry", Falk shakes his head, "Wouldn't it be much nicer to have a regular fuck buddy who also actually cares for you and who you can celebrate those moments with? I mean, not that I object of being your current preferred choice of company."
"Not to mention your ominous owl message last week, Harry. We know something's up," Hermione grins mischievously.
"No, only today. It’s actually our first time." So much for witty.
"Morning, Ron. No everything’s fine, don't worry. I'd like to invite you and Hermione over to my place tonight on the spur of the moment though. Does that work for you?"
"Forgive me, if I come straight out with it, I have to..." it suddenly blurts out of Drew, ending in a falter. "I was going to ask you, but was afraid you'd... mhh...," he squirms and Harry smirks.
And then not wasting a second more Drew’s mouth comes down on Harry. He gasps, his legs uncontrollably spasming and one of his hands slipping off on the counter. Harry’s bodily misfunction results in a hard smack of the back of his head against the wall behind him.
Harry nods with a grin. "To be honest, I'm glad I don’t play competitively. Sure, it’s exhilarating, when you claim victory for your team. But I couldn’t enjoy it as much if I knew I’d have to earn my keep." They are still standing quite close and Harry doesn't know what to make of it. He hasn't worked out with himself where he wants this meeting to go yet, and is being extra cautious now after his slip earlier.
“Can’t wait to meet him.”
I like to think my strong points are writing dialogue , so please bear with the weaker parts between the dialogues
"Don't tell me I had it coming," he says in conclusion, before any of them can say anything.
"Let him speak, Ron. What have you done, then?" Harry is grateful for Hermione's intervention. Since her training as a mind healer, she has admittedly actually morphed into a wonderful conversationalist and advisor. For the life of him, he wouldn't want to do without Ron's input because of this, but it helps the goal setting to have someone there to follow the conversation on a meta level and guide it if necessary.
me Matthew. Or Matt if you like", he replies, making it obvious he sees through him.
“I’m off then. Take care, Drew.”
“No, I’d rather not”, Harry admits.
"Um, not on the team though. Just recreationally with friends."
“You know what we say in the Slytherin dorms? Keep your friends close, but keep your enemies closer. If you’re so afraid of what he might do, better not leave him unobserved.”
“Sorry, I’m picky with my wand”, he says shaken.
“One very presumptuous might say it in such a self-centred way”, Harry teases, actually liking Blondies feigned over-confidence. It’s usually an indicator for real healthy confidence.
"Am I that obvious, or are you just very observant?"
“That’s of lesser interest right now, y’know?”, Harry mutters, still entranced.
Harry gives him a quick look, then retreats back to the photographs. “I like them. Where were they taken?”
"Yes. I'm here," he utters again with a crooked smile.
Exhausted, he leans against the porcelain bowl and a slight sense of depersonalisation creeps in. It's as if Harry is watching himself from the outside, as if he were the amiable but scatter-brained protagonist of a bad sitcom whose only plot is to depict twenty-somethings failing at life so that the same-age target audience can gentrify themselves at the sight of it. Harry snorts at the irony, that it is the kind of gallows humour, he is feeling right now, that the characters in such shows then usually employ. Oh, what a cliche he is portraying right now.
Along with the last sip, he stands up determinedly and walks hurriedly towards his fireplace. The only logical course of action in such a situation is to floo Ron. And Hermione, of course. But he waits in vain and his call goes unanswered. Crushed, he settles for writing an owl message asking them to floo him as soon as possible, without giving much indication of the reason for the urgent request.
"Nah. My ambitions weren't that high, I was still only a, uh, third grader, before we moved. And to be honest, I became a bit estranged from the others at some point, anyway." A dark shadow flits across Drew's face. Should Drew possibly also have had his differences with identifying as a Slytherin-member?
After the first few sips, he dares to think halfway rationally again. Since he doesn't consider beating-oneself-up to be very productive, he returns to his original question and the fear that goes with it. Why is Drew not interested in selling him to the press? The only comprehensible answer to that would be, he genuinely is interested in Harry, but that just doesn’t feel realistic, as Harry sincerely wonders what behaviour of his might have convinced Drew to consider dating him. At what point has he been conceiving the aura of being dating material? Not only did Harry lie to Drew, but had also been dead drunk and then dead hungover, almost constantly on the verge of throwing up since they’ve arrived at Drew’s flat, and practically nothing but a messy nuisance. How very attractive and exactly what you look for in a one-night stand, not to say in a partner. He doesn’t take Drew for a fame-hunter though, that much he conveyed. But he cannot get rid of the feeling that something is off.
Harry can't suppress a sigh. How he wishes he wasn't famous.
"Of course," Drew bursts out almost indignantly. Harry raises an eyebrow.
“Well, you don’t happen to know the whereabouts of my underwear? I’m practically blind without my glasses”, Harry plays it cool. “I didn’t feel the need to bring them with me last night”, he adds.
"Wow, Amazing," Harry breathes as he takes in the scenery of a light-filled conservatory-office-morph. A dormer completely glazed has been set into the gable of the roof, and Harry realises that the opposite internal wall is also glazed as he can vaguely make out the features of the kitchen this time from above through the beams. For the moment, the sun has forced its way through the dense cloud cover and bathes the conservatory in a wonderful play of light and shade.
With quick steps he walks through the flat in search of his shirt. He notices once again how tasteful and luxurious the furnishings are, and for the first time he notices a concert grand piano, which is not exactly inconspicuous. His gaze flickers to Drew, back to the piano. It's surprisingly easy to imagine his slender fingers gliding gently but firmly over the keys, surrendering the flow of the music, the playing gradually taking on a life of its own with each successive bar he strikes. A form of passion that Harry was allowed to feel on his own body yesterday. A rush of blood towards his crotch reminds him that fantasies of this kind are counterproductive when you still have to convince yourself that there is definitely no sexual tension in the room.
"Mhh, I like", Falk smirks. They three of them huddle in a flock like teenagers, stalking their common crush in not the most of discrete ways. Namely they all stare at Blondie, who was again leaning at his pillar. If they had been sober, they might have had the decency to at least act like their visual and conversational attention wasn't all occupied by him, but they weren't. Instead they tucked their heads even closer.
The three of them finish off their meal after the small interruption by Peagreen has been ended with his farewell, and then soon after Harry sees them off, too.
"You'll have to live with a bit of uncertainty I fear," Drew replies to Harry's revelation of personal issues. "Suggestion: We start all over again. Unbiased, tabula rasa."
“Then make time. Do you want to veg out into the day forever and hope that the world around you will hopefully change for the better on its own?”, she shoots back without mercy.
Harry's tension, which had built up unnoticed, unwinds leisurely. "Fair enough," he acknowledges. "I can be very judgmental. It's almost impossible to meet someone who isn't already biased in some way or another because of my notoriety. And it's always a tightrope walk to sense who is just projecting their ideas of me onto me and wants to bathe in the glow of fame." Harry smiles apologetically. "Or who is really interested in getting to know me," he adds with a big exhale.
been playing with his cards on the table from the start."
It’s Blondie who immediately takes the word. "You guys look like you have fun." Harry doesn't know how to answer to that. "Do you usually chat up the same guy for a bet?" And even less to that. He settles for a sheepish smile, rummaging his brain for some witty comeback. He has no idea to what extend Blondie is informed.
“Oh, that was hardly me at my best. My athletic peak performance is much higher.”
MILD SPOILER: As mentioined in the tags I give a mild spoiler here. If not obvious at that point, the OC/Drew is supposed to be Draco. It will be revealed at some point of course and before that hinted during various occasions, but if youre a heavy Drarry-Digger and can't bear the Drarry Dynamic being consciously perceived just by Draco, then this might not be the story for you
When Harry comes back out of the kitchen, Cas has made herself comfortable, leaning back against the side of the sofa, knees drawn up and a cushion wedged between her stomach and legs, casually fiddling with her hair, which she has undone in the meantime.
For much longer than necessary, he lets the hot water pelt his back, trying to conjure up the usual blissful mood of a sleepy hangover day, but failing. Yes, his muscles relax under the heat and his circulation also responds positively to the gentle stimulation, but one cannot speak of this effect being transferred to his mind. On the contrary. Instead of getting out of the shower, to look forward to his bed and a light novel while drinking a cup of tea, he feels as if he is about to take his NEWTs (even though he has never taken them in fact; if the two situations are even remotely similar in their stress potential, he sees little to no incentive to ever do so at any point, given how drained he feels right now).
“You certainly won’t have to,” he says and Harry feels the warm stream of breath on his cheeks, holds his own breath in anticipation. Excitement ripples through his chest, the urge to pull Drew closer immediately, the wish this hand in his nape would make use of its excellent positioning, anything to just get rid of this god damn ridiculous gap between their lips.
“I’d like to continue…”, Drew leaves the utterance hanging in the air like a question. His eyes scoot over Harry, lead from sheer hunger for what lies in front of him.
"Just do it. Hold on tight." Well, obediently he follows. Who is he to question his potential bedmate.
"But that's wonderful, Harry! How did it go?" gloats Hermione. "Oh boy, to think it's still happening. I'd almost lost hope that you'd let someone new into your life again."
you never found out. I can compensate for your silence in galleons, or broom merch, or… I don’t know. Whatever suits your taste”, he shrugs, wishing his actual nervousness would not be too obvious.
Not infrequently, especially at work, Harry finds that he has difficulty putting his drive and ideas into practice in a meaningful way. He frantically ponders how to draft a letter that conveys both the character of a casual "I just wanted to ask how things are going" and the proper remorse for his previous inappropriate silence.
He’s freed from the agony of choice, when Drew decides to lift Harry on the countertop, and starts to fiddle on his flies. Harry at first lost for balance, softly moans, enjoys the liberation of this constricting prison of fabric, that had slowly started to get painful. And the aspect that there’s one layer less separating his prick from direct skin contact, might give it a little jump. Harry’s need to wait for that last layer to vanish, proves to be a sweet torment. Drew’s lifted his shirt and kisses his abdomen, raising to the rip cage, brushing his hardened nipples. Every touch of his lips leaves a prickling heat, teases Harry to want more while never giving him the pleasure of satisfaction. Harry’s head flops back in torture, when one of Drew’s thumbs nestles its way under the seam of his boxers.
“Fuck”, he mumbles as tears shot into his eyes, but manages to hold them back. Clearing his throat, he straightens his back and sits back against the sofa’s cushion. “Thanks. Uhm… yeah. So much for that.” Nervous laughter.
"So, who do I have the pleasure to talk with?", Harry asks.
Falk laughed. "Don't worry, you'll get your share tonight if you’re so eager to." He turns around and orders some drinks for them both. "How was your day?"
Drew shakes his head in disbelieve about Harry's bluntness but agrees. This time Harry leads. On the way he catches a glimpse of Cas and Falk both giving him thumbs up. It's his first time realizing just how embarrassing they are as a trio. Quickly he shakes these self-deprecating thoughts off, concentrating on the music. And also on Drew, checking him out. His movements are restrained yet smooth. Harry, however, is more of the free spirit type of dancer. Soon he’s absorbed by the music again and the sexually tinged mood has fleeted. While they move and share some casual words they more or less coincidentally keep brushing each other’s body parts from time to time. And the more they talk the more Harry’s attracted on deeper level than just superficial appearance. Drew choses his word wisely, tainting them with intelligence, wit, and a strangely pretentious humbleness. He manages to make a conversation about noisy work mates intriguing. Harry can’t stop himself from sneakily getting more handsy and Drew reciprocates. Luckily. Harry’s getting bolder, driven by his inner maneater that has awoken again. He wraps his hands around Drew’s waist bringing their hips together. There’s no blaming their touches on the dance floors narrowness anymore, this is clearly intentional, and Harry wants Drew to know that. Drew answers by placing his arms loosely on Harry’s shoulders. They keep dancing like that for some time, matching their movements, bit by bit closing the distance between their bodies, slowing down. Drews neck is dangerously close to Harry’s mouth, and he doesn’t hold out for long until he sinks his face in the curve of it, his lips brushing Drews skin, nose greedily sucking in his smell. The neck under his face vibrates with a chuckle. Harry’s torn between looking up and bringing their faces closer or savouring the moment as it is. He decides for the latter and so they keep on dancing entangled as they are. There will be time to make out and ravish each other the whole night long, but this intimate dancing feels almost as if they were here as partners; he can almost pretend he is embracing the most precious person to him, and he closes his eyes to dive deeper into that fantasy, blends out every sense but his tactile. Nonetheless their somewhat rhythmic movements start to stimulate him. A bit too much. Especially in his crotch area. And he’s almost certain he’s not the only one building a tent in his trousers.
“Fuck, the polyjuice potion!”, Cas gasps when she concluded what happened next. “You forgot…” Harry’s confirmatory nod shuts her sentence off. He presses his lips together, roaming the room with his gaze in the discomfort of remembering, then releases the pressure with a loud smack of his lips. “Yip, I forgot to take another dose before dozing off.” His grip on his mug tightens. “And awoke looking like I usually do, to a guy who fell asleep to someone else.”
“Alright, alright. Thanks for having me and feeding my curiosity.” She finally gets up, too.
“Harry just hopes to bribe me into exploiting my authority”, she answers in an angry tone.
"Yeah, but I'll refrain," Harry jokes, way to smitten with Drew’s appearance to perceive the short facial derailment let alone question it.
“Sure”, Harry complies, relieved to see the adversary go, not knowing that the strongest resistance he has to fight is himself. I’ll just rest my eyes until he returns, he tells himself, already trailed back into slumber.
"It also only took her two minutes to understand from my hand and foot signs that you can only get in from the other side of the house. As an owl."
"Yes. A great horned owl. Grey plumage, interesting green eyes", he appraises Harry, then snickers. "I named him Peagreen for that."
wand in mind, of course, not any wand. “Must be my hangover.”
Drew laughs uproariously. "No problem. I'll get you both, wait wherever you please. Preferably the bed”, Drew is unexpectedly cheerful. “Though I can't vouch for any ulterior motives not being involved in this suggestion." Drew’s careless good mood perturbs Harry, but in anticipation of his desired beverages he gets to one of the leather couches in the sitting area, and enjoys the absurdly impressive view, that kind of makes up for these otherwise messed up circumstances of his presence here.
"Fuck", is the immediate answer and a very fast bright blond flash slams the door close from inside the bath.
"Hey Falk, it's me, Harry", he says while poking the other man’s shoulder. He's surprised by his own low raspy voice, having not heard it yet.
"Oh, Harry, tomorrow," Ron's yawning face does appear in the embers in front of him. "Did something happen? Did I forget something?"
“Is that alright?” Drew searches for Harry’s eyes. “Fuck, I didn’t mean to take it too fast”, he adds a nervous laugh.
"Have a seat. Can I get you some tea?" offers Harry hospitably.
If Harry wasn't used to his friends seeing through him every time he thinks he's cleverly hiding things from them by now, he'd probably blush with embarrassment. This way, he just laughs a little sheepishly.
"More spitefulness. If I'm honest, I expected Rita Skeeter to appear in front of me at any moment. Or at least a bit of latent blackmail. It's not every day youre being served with such a terrific lever in your hand."
“Is this your usual way of a proper send-off?”, Harry conceals his flusterdness. In hell he would admit, he enjoyed it, wanted it to last longer. Not when he had taken all his might to convince the other man of the contrary in the last 30 minutes or so.
He clears his throat, miming interest in the rest of the room to put a few steps of space between him and Drew without lacking a justification other than social uneasiness. "Did you play Quidditch at school?" he asks casually as he surveys a cast-iron watering can with exaggerated attention.
“I don’t get…”, Harry starts to speak but is interrupted.
“Sure”, Drew smiles, squeezes softly and brushes Harry’s arms longer than necessary when they detach from the embrace. “Well then, arrive home safely and get yourself a good night’s sleep.” He steps back, so Harry can apparte without reservations.
As he continues to ruminate, he realizes for the first time the absurdity of one night stands. How come he has never questioned why he willingly shares his most intimate, vulnarable sides with randomly chosen people on a regular basis without much hesitation, and even appreciated this anonymity and fleetingness? In the wake of recent events, it seems insane to him that he ever considered such an idea.
He can’t treat this like a whimsical pick up, can he? He wouldn’t know, and he needn’t know, because the announced assault isn’t put into practice.
Harry grins, "I like your definition of romantic partner as ‘fuck buddy who cares'. At least I don't wonder why you keep on being single deliberately."
I wonder, if this will play into my hands after all?"
"Uh. Sorry, I did invite you now, though" he apologises. "I perceived it as more of a me thing."
"I didn't accuse him of it in these words. And to be fair, a lot of people would probably do just that, and you know it," Harry defends himself.
“Yeah, sure”, Cas gibes. “Go tell that your doormat.” Harry snorts.
"What?", Harry can't quite follow the change of events. Wasn't he supposed to get a blowjob? Did he destroy the mood with that minor disruption?
"Is that so? Cassiopeia was your effervescent friend from ‘The Fortune Teller’, wasn't she?", Drew plainly responds to Harry's honest addition, without any further remark, thankfully.
"Hey, uh, sorry, I didn't mean to hit a sore spot.” Suddenly, talking about old school days doesn't feel so nice and light-hearted after all. Or talking in general. Harry knows by now that his strong points don't exactly lie in approaching delicate topics gently.
“How did he react?”, Cas’ hand had found its way to her mouth, concealing parts of her horrified face.
(See the end of the chapter for
“It’s fine. I’d gladly offer you another kind of wand… but I guess, you already declined.”
"No," chimes in unison.
“Right,” he admits. The rush of blood literally washes all his thinking ability away. Dumbfounded he stares at Drew’s mouth, that simply looks to enticing.
“I hope I don’t need to be excluded then? Now that I am aware of my part beforehand. Leaves not much briefing to be done anymore to me”, Blondie is visibly amused, which Harry takes in with joy.
A nauseating moment of darkness later, he finds himself near the front door inside that apartment.
Harry shakes his can of owl treat, hoping to distract Peagreen from his revenge campaign with success. The bird eagerly picks treat after treat, and Harry finally snatches the note off its leg.
Caught off guard, he pats her back and lightly joins in her laughter. Her mood is simply infectious, no matter how miserable he feels.
Though their bodily connection finally lifts some of this build up pressure, there is still a tangible tension in the air that calls for more. Harry’s hands find their way into blond, disheveled hair, that once was neatly tied to a bun but has long ago dissolved to a formless blob of messy strands. The bearer of the hairstyle doesn’t seem to mind. He rather pushes Harry backwards, arms on each side, practically locking him between the kitchen counter and himself, all while gradually deepening their kiss in a voracious manner.
and sorry. This took way longer than expected to write.. and I really notice how bad I am with writing scenes where people interact wordlessly (I wish someone would lift that burden off of me)
"Listen", Cas murmurs promising as if to drop the latest gossip, "he even had the audacity to ask me if my friend here", quick glance at Harry, then back to the subject of their topic, "happens to be interested in men and more specifically in him." Her indignation is all just an act, even though a bit of hurt pride shines through.
Blondie’s actually lost for words. "Dr... Drewes... Call me Drewes, or just Drew is fine."
“Harry?” The tone of Drew’s voice is pleading. Harry turns around, only to be surprised by the soft pressure of lips on his own. It’s a farewell kiss, demanding, almost desperate, breathless, its impact overpowering Harry’s will to move. A part of Harry jumps with delight, and every effort of the whole morning to deny the existing attraction turn out to be in vain. But before Harry can actively give in, the moment is over again.
"If you consider the perceptiveness of a flubberworm to be very observant, then it's down to us alone," Ron jibes, to which Harry flips two fingers.
Drew laughs up. "The fact that you haven't become a professional Quidditch player probably surprises half of England. Me included."
Harry shrugs it off. "Out of my league probably", he proclaims his final judgement.
This finally puts a smile on Harry’s face. “You’re impossible. I'm surprised you haven't dared me yet to another bet.”
"Always for me. Hermione gets her own food when in doubt. With her mood swings and cravings currently, it's impossible to predict in the morning what she might like in the evening anyway." He rolls his eyes, but his tone clearly shows his affectation towards her.
Minnie once again spoke. "Since it is such a late hour, why not use my floo? That way you will not encounter anyone in the halls. It was quite lovely seeing you all again and welcome back to the land of the living, Severus. It is good to have you back whether you teach here or not." She smiled warmly at him and he smiled back.
Sirius Black and Remus Lupin both suddenly appeared. Both looked befuddled and stared at Draco and Harry with wide eyes.
Blaise stepped in. “For your information Weasley, Harry owled us to come visit.”
Molly stepped forward and hugged them both tightly. “Welcome my dears! It is so lovely to see you. It was good of you to come for tea. And Draco welcome to the family!” She gave him a kiss on the cheek and gave him an extra hug.
They held onto each other tightly. As the kiss deepened, Harry and Draco were pressed up again each other once again. Both were moaning softly and continued to kiss incredibly passionately until each were desperate to breath. They slowly pulled away from each other panting heavily.
Narcissa and Harry finished their tea in relative silence for the most part. The Malfoy house elf retrieved the tea tray and left with it. As Narcissa stood and started to walk into the foyer of the Manor, Harry followed.
Harry sighed sadly. “Dray, we better get ready to go to the Burrow. But when we return, I suggest that we continue what we started.” He smirked at a stunned Draco.
Draco was rudely awoken by an overexcited house elf jumping on his bed. He growled "What is your bloody issue, Winky?!"
Harry rolled his eyes at Draco. "Most definitely not rubbish for your information, Malfoy. Some day I'll show you the memory if you need proof your Saviour was almost a Slytherin. You can also ask Hermione as well about my almost snake status. Regarding my ability to speak in Parseltongue, I had become an unknown and unintentional horcrux the night Voldemort murdered my parents which meant I had a part of his soul in me. That's why I had some dark abilities and was able to see into his mind and experience his activities through his eyes in my dreams. It was quite disturbing. And yes I still have the ability to communicate with snakes but that's the only ability that remained. I'm actually glad I retained Parseltongue because I enjoy speaking with snakes. Strange, I know but ever since I frightened my cousin Dudley at the zoo by speaking with a snake, I've come to love the language and snakes."
Hermione gave him a lovely smile. "You are not half bad company yourself. Let me know when you are not otherwise engaged and we will certainly have tea together. I will be seeing you soon, Sev."
Severus stared into Hermione’s eyes. “Uhh, I, Hermione. What do you mean by the way you feel about me?” He looked at her curiously.
Hermione took her wand out and pointed it at the doe figurine. "Semper fidelis. Te mihi revelare." She spoke the words from the letter slowly and pronounced them carefully.
Draco could hear Harry unlock the door. Harry looked a bit shocked to see who was on the other side of his front door but quickly recovered and ushered Draco inside.
Narcissa rolled her eyes. “Only a Slytherin can think of a way to go over the top in gift giving. And for your information, it is Black. I divorced Lucius.” She smirked.
The salesperson smiled. “Male or female?”
Draco smiled back. "Funny you should mention sending an owl. I had planned to do that but everything I wrote sounded wrong. Mother was getting annoyed with my pacing so she suggested that I should just show up in person rather than stress over a letter. And yes I would love some tea, thank you."
Hermione gave him a worried look. "I think it is time to start calling our former professor by his first name, Harry. But that is besides the point, why did Severus summon you? What happened?" Giving him an expectant look.
Harry smiled at Draco. “I’m doing okay. I’m happy they’re back but it’s a bit overwhelming. I never thought this was possible and then Narcissa went and did the impossible. I can’t thank her enough. I just hope everyone can figure out a way to get along. I would like to have peace like Hermione said.”
Harry took the letter that was attached to the owl’s leg and opened it. He chuckled. “Looks like Hermione made good on her threat to tell Molly about Ron’s behaviour the other day. Molly would like us to come by for tea.” Errol was still staring at Harry.
Malfoy"
Blaise looked at Pansy. “I believe that is our queue to leave as well. Potter, thank you for such an eventful afternoon.” He smiled.
"I told him I would owl him. I have never been this excited except when I am flying or playing quidditch." Draco said happily.
Harry was about to say something but was interrupted by the appearance of a whiteish blue doe figurine. Everyone looked at each other not knowing what to do next.
When Draco and Harry arrived back, they were greeted by Severus and Narcissa looking quite livid. Narcissa broke her silence. “What were you two thinking? Are you both mad? What on earth possessed you to visit my vile husband?”
Harry felt Draco flinch at Ron’s words and held his hand tightly. “No, Weasel, it’s not a joke. I can be friends with whoever I choose. You’re not my keeper. And there’s no reason to be so fucking crude! You can be such an arsehole, Weasel! It makes me question why I’m trying to stay friends with you. First, Lucius lashes out at Draco. Second, Pansy attacks me but she and I are okay now. And now you’re attacking me in my own home and questioning my decisions. No we’re not fucking as you said so eloquently and no Draco didn’t dose me with a love potion. I thought I could trust you to be there for me. I thought you wanted me to be happy. But here you are just being your fourth year self again! Betray you? How dare you use your family against me! Let them make their own decisions! It’s not up to you, thank Merlin!” He snarled at Ron. He held Draco close to him.
Harry smiled. “Actually, Narcissa has saved the day twice. She lied to Voldemort in the forest and now you’ve brought my family back. I really don’t know how to thank you for everything you’ve done.”
Narcissa looked at Potter. "Harry, I was wondering how the restoration of Hogwarts was going. Will it be ready for the coming school year?"
Draco was finally able to speak again. "If you do not regret anything, neither do I. I am looking forward to the insanity that we just caused across the wizarding world. This also means I need to pay my father a visit far sooner than I had originally planned. I hope you are up for travelling to Azkaban. I can not do this alone. I need you there with me, Harry." He looked at Harry hopefully.
Narcissa smirked. "Darling, I hate to break it to you but you are being foolish and daft right now. You might as well just go to his place."
Draco turned bright red when Harry kissed his cheek. "I enjoyed today as well. Thank you again for returning my wand. I really appreciate it. I have missed my first wand quite a bit. I will owl you about getting together again. Goodbye Harry." He stepped forward and hugged Harry tightly. As he released Harry, he started to kiss Harry's cheek but his ex-rival turned his head which caused him to kiss his lips. Harry softly kissed back. When they stepped back from each other, both boys were blushing.
Hermione started giggling. "That is definitely a sight to be seen for sure. Let me know how that goes when you do go with Draco. I could use a good laugh."
The contents of the letter read:
Harry began softly tracing the scars on Draco’s chest. He noticed how his breathing became more erratic as he continued. Harry smirked at Draco’s reaction. He followed one of the scars with his finger and it ended right at the top of his trousers which earned him a low moan and shiver from Draco. He carried on caressing along the trouser line. Draco started to buck his hips a bit and moaned even louder.
"Of course, my darling. You can ask me anything you want." Narcissa smiled sweetly.
"Draco darling I hope you enjoyed your time with Harry." Giving him a knowing smile.
Sirius was about to answer but was interrupted by the sudden appearance of James and Lily Potter. Everyone’s eyes went incredibly wide.
Narcissa approached her cautiously. "Hermione, dear, are you okay? What brings you to the manor?" She tried to reach for Hermione but was met with a swat.
Severus stepped into the bedroom and looked around as Hermione closed the door behind them. “Miss Granger, this is certainly what I imagined what your bedroom would look like. Mostly books with a bed.” Hermione blushed a little. She gently grabbed Severus’ hand and pulled him towards her bed.
Harry was comforting Draco. “Love, please try to calm down and breathe. I know what your father said was god awful but he isn’t worth your tears.” Draco’s sobs finally began to slow.
Harry looked at Draco with so much love. “I don’t want to pressure you but I’ve been wanting to feel your skin on mine. Would you be okay if we remove our shirts? I just really want to be closer to you, Dray.” He gave his boyfriend a pleading look.
Harry pulled Hermione into a hug. "Thank you! It's a relief to have your support. And of course I want you to be happy too. I hope you find it someday. You certainly deserve it after having to deal with me and Ron." He chuckled.
Draco looked at Harry intently. "Harry, that was just abhorrently embarrassing. Do your friends even know manners? Hermione could have at least knocked before barging in." He looked annoyed.
When Harry arrived back to Grimmauld Place after his visit to Malfoy Manor, he was immediately assaulted by the presence of Hermione and Ron who looked like they'd been waiting for hours. Both gave him a suffocating hug simultaneously. He huffed out a laugh.
Draco sighed contentedly. "Good night, Harry." He grasped Harry's hand and squeezed it.
They were about to talk a bit more but Winky interrupted. "Mistress is waiting patiently for Master Draco to come inside. Dinner is ready." She popped back to the Manor.
Draco's eyes went wide. He never heard of such a potion before but he knew Granger could and would find something like that. "I really do not know what to say, Potter."
Draco started to pull Harry’s shirt off and then he took his own off. He explored Harry’s chest and teased his nipples which earned him a loud moan. Draco reveled in all the sounds Harry was making because of him.
Draco sighed "I am guessing even if I refuse you will still make me eat. You are as bad as Mother, Winky." He rolled out of bed. Why did he agree to letting Potter come for tea today?
Hermione watched Severus thoughtfully. "Thank you for your kind words regarding my parents and Ron and helping me calm down earlier. I truly appreciate it. And I hope you do not mind me calling me Sev. I never asked if it was all right to do so."
Severus stood up first and offered his hand to Hermione. Without hesitation, she took hold of his hand and he pulled her towards him. For a moment, time stood still as they stared into each other's eyes. As soon as they realised what they were doing, both looked away from one another embarrassed.
Hermione bit her lip nervously. She squeezed his hand and lifted her other to his face. Slowly she reached out and touched his chin. Hermione turned Severus’ head so he was facing her. “Sev, please look at me.” And he did. “Please do not be embarrassed considering I had been the one who said that I wanted to kiss you in the first place as I was leaving the Manor the other day. Honestly, I have been hoping upon hoping that you would ask. And to answer your question, you most certainly have my permission to kiss me.” She blushed as she stared into Severus’ eyes.
Harry was curled into Draco’s side when he woke up. He thought of their first time the night before and smiled to himself. He kissed Draco’s shoulder but the love of his life did not move or make a sound so he got up to use the bathroom and get dressed. Harry checked if Draco had woken up but he had not. He quietly went down to the kitchen to make himself breakfast. During his meal, Harry received an owl from Narcissa about coming for tea. He replied that he would be there around one o’clock. He looked the time and realised how late it was. It was already noon. Harry quickly finished his breakfast and quietly went back to the bedroom he shared with Draco, only to find Draco still asleep. He was surprised but he knew it had something to do with their activities the night before. He tiptoed out of the room to use the guest bathroom to get ready for tea at the Manor. After he was finished getting ready, he checked on Draco one last time. Harry kissed him on his shoulder again and left a note for him on the nightstand saying he was summoned by Narcissa.
Harry stood in front of Hermione. "Thank you for coming by and having breakfast with us. I am so lucky to have in my life. I don't know what I would do without you." He hugged her tightly.
English translation of Narcissa's incantation: I implore you to bring back those lost, I implore you to bring back those lost, I implore you to bring back those lost. With this sacrifice bring forth Sirius Black and Remus Lupin. With this sacrifice bring forth Lily and James Potter.
Draco grimaced and nodded "You really do not have to, Winky. I am not very hungry. Do not bother making breakfast for me."
Harry stood up. “I’ll be right back.” He kissed Draco and left the room. He went upstairs to hide the wedding bands but kept the engagement rings in his pocket.
Ron was scowling. "You two are unbelievable! This can't be happening! I can't support this bloody alliance between the ferret and Harry! I just can't! I'm sorry, Harry." He stood up and left the table. Both Harry and Hermione flinched when they heard him slam the door.
Severus smirked. "I remember Albus was always irritated that he needed a replacement for the Defence Against the Dark Arts post each year. Such fond memories." He heard chuckling behind him and saw Albus' portrait laughing.
Draco walked to the front door and went back into his house. He noticed his mother in the entryway.
When Severus gracefully landed back at the Manor, he was greeted by Narcissa who sported a knowing smile.
Hermione quickly grabbed his hand ensuring that he would not leave and had tears in her eyes. “Stop, Sev. You are not a Death Eater. Maybe long ago but not now. I trust you with my life and my heart. You are none of those negative things that I know are swirling in your head right now. What I said was true, you have a brilliant soul despite your prickliness. And when you initially joined Voldemort, you did it because you wanted a sense of belonging and you were hurt because of Lily. There is no shame in that. We all do foolish things when we get hurt or do not feel like you have anyone to turn to. You made a mistake, granted a ginormous one yes but you made up for it tenfold because of your love for Lily. You saved our world by keeping Lily’s son safe nearly every year at Hogwarts despite the possibility of being caught. An evil man does not do that. An evil man does not risk his own life by being a double agent with his loyalties on the side of good. An evil man does not feel love in his heart. An evil man does not do the right thing. An evil man does not worry about the safety of those around him. A good man would watch over the child of the one who got away long ago. A good man would sacrifice his own safety for the greater good. A good man would fall in love. A good man would always do the right thing in the end. A good man would be vigilant of how important the safety of those around him are.” She stressed every word she said. “Those are all the reasons why I believe you are the truest kind of hero and one of the bravest men, Severus.” She caressed his cheek and smiled at him softly.
Harry actually smiled. "Let me guess Victor Krum was your tipping point?" He chuckled.
Draco sighed in relief. "Well, hearing you say that makes me feel like I made the right call visiting you. I am just nervous about what they will say about you if you are associated with me. I do not want your precious fanbase to attack you for being my friend. I would feel terrible if I caused any harm being seen with you in public. I only want the best for you, Harry."
Harry collapsed on top of Draco. Both felt boneless. It took them a few minutes to collect themselves.
When Harry and Draco approached the table where Lucius was, again Draco held onto Harry quite tightly and whispered. “Dray, no need to worry. No matter what happens you will always have me.” They separated and sat beside each other as Lucius watched their interactions with one another curiously.
Harry nodded. “Yes we would like that. Thank you.” Kreacher popped back out.
Narcissa stood up and walked over to her son. "My dear, I understand why you are worried. But you deserve your own happiness despite your past and Harry makes you happy and that is all that should matter. Now, I order you to go see your Harry." She gave him a teasing smile.
Harry removed his wand from pocket and said "expecto patronum" which produced his stag patronus. It walked up to Harry and bowed its head. "Please find Hermione and tell her to come to Hogwarts and floo into the Headmistress' office immediately." After he relayed the message, the stag bounded out of the office and disappeared.
Harry filled her in on what happened after she left. Hermione looked positively pleased at what she heard. She hugged Harry tightly. "I am so happy for you both! Truly I am."
Severus spoke. "Draco, you were having nightmares. Your screams broke through your wards. Do you remember what you were dreaming about?"
Draco pulled away and walked back to where Harry was. Hermione could not stop staring at Severus like he could disappear again at any moment. Harry was stunned into silence. Minnie smirked fondly at Severus.
Both Narcissa and Severus apparated away and Harry looked at Draco sadly. “Dray, my love, let’s move to somewhere more comfortable, okay?” Harry helped Draco stand up and they slowly made it up the stairs and into their bedroom. He laid his boyfriend on their shared bed and climbed in next to Draco.
See you tomorrow.
Harry sheepishly glanced at Draco. “Dray, I despise seeing you so down. I thought you could use some cheering up. I owled them. I know we were planning to have them over at some point in the future but I thought it couldn’t wait.” He blushed a bit.
Lucius nodded and Draco continued. “I know you and Mother always wanted me to marry a pure blood witch and have children. That has always been the plan. It was not until a few years ago that I realised that it was not something I wanted. I never said anything about it, fearing that I would disappoint you and Mother. I had been at war with myself for years and suppressed my true wants from showing. It was not until after the war and the trials that I was finally free. I did not have to abide to the plans and I could be myself. Father, what I am trying to say is that I am gay and I am dating Harry. I thought it would be prudent tell you before you heard the news from someone else.” He could not look at his father for a moment.
Hermione stared into his eyes. “I know we have not been together very long but I want to be as close to you as possible.” She turned bright red. “We do not have to do anything but I need you, Sev.”
Harry smiled at him. "I believe so. But what do friends usually talk about?" He eyed Draco curiously.
Kreacher popped in. “Master Harry, would you like some tea for you and your guests?”
Draco looked frustrated. "Fine, I will contact him."
Severus had tears in his eyes. “Hermione, you truly believe that I am a good man?”
Narcissa chuckled softly. "Harry, I believe you embarrassed my son by calling him Draco. I do not think you ever called him by his first name." What his mother said made him blush even harder and he averted his eyes.
The three of them walked to the new jewellery shop, Evermore Trinkets. As they entered the shop, the salesperson greeted them. “Welcome, how can I assist you today?”
Draco stepped forward and Hermione launched herself at him and hugged him. "Draco, welcome to the family!" She pulled away and smiled at him. "I will be seeing you both soon!" She disappeared into the floo.
Hermione searched for the perfect words to say. "Severus, I believe the reason for your resurrection was that you meant a great deal to Draco. I think Dumbledore knew that his father was not going to escape Azkaban and he would need someone to help his mother out. Plus I think our world needed you too. You played an important role and Dumbledore thought after what you did, you should be rewarded and reunited with your family. The remaining Malfoys. No one deserves a second chance more than you do, Sev. I truly believe that." She blushed because she called him by a nickname.
Hermione suddenly pulled Severus into a passionate kiss. They kissed for what felt like hours but it was only minutes. Hermione slowly pulled away. “I would love to live with you and no I do not think it is too fast. I mean, at least, not for us.” She smiled at him. “Plus, my books will be happy to be on shelves rather than on the floor. One can not disregard their feelings.” She laughed.
Severus stroked Hermione’s hair. “I love you with my whole being.” He blushed. “Bloody hell Granger! You have turned me into a soppy git.” He chuckled lightly.
Harry laughed. “Narcissa, you are bloody brilliant. I don’t think I’ve seen Severus blush like that before.”
Draco stared up at Harry and grabbed him and kissed him so ferociously. They continued to kiss until they were panting for air.
Draco was in shock and wasn't sure how to respond. He kept opening and closing his mouth trying to form the appropriate words. "I can not lose you either, Harry. You have always been a fixture in my life. I do not want to imagine my existence without you. Until now I never believed in the phrase 'there is a fine line between love and hate' but you challenged my belief and I am glad that you were the one who opened my heart to forgive and move on from my past. I also never thought this kind of connection could exist because of how I was raised. I mean look at my parents. My mother keeps informing me that my father was much different in the beginning of their relationship but it is a little hard to picture my father actually happy and at ease. My mother was the only one who really showed me love. I know that sounds insensitive considering your upbringing with the dreadful Dursleys. But you also had the Weasleys and they are the very definition of a loving family. I can see that now after experiencing such terror in the Manor. I still feel uneasy in my family home. No matter how many renovations my mother has done to it, I will never feel safe there. It is forever broken. But then I reconnected with you, and I feel safe once again. Like everything is going to be alright. I feel like I have a bright future and it, of course, involves you. I finally look forward to living again. I have you to thank for that because you defeated Voldemort and you gave me another chance. Sometimes I have to pinch myself to make sure I am not dreaming. I know that sounds silly but it is the truth." He smiled fondly at Harry.
“It’s fine. Sooner or later, we all reach a point like this. The important thing is, to not let it get a hold of us”, she says with an encouraging smile. Harry nods sheepishly.
The side-along apparition drops them both in a loft apartment with a large window front, that exposes a beautiful view over London’s Thames at night. Only Harry hasn’t time to appreciate that right now, as the urge to vomit comes up. Apparition sickens him every time even when he’s sober.
“I can only wonder, what impression it makes on you with regard to your former experiences. As for me, I woke up with the desire to learn more about that funny, smart guy I only had the honour to share a fracture of time with yet. And if that guy happenes to be Harry Potter, I don’t mind. I don’t want to delude you, you need to trust me on that. I think you’re interesting, and I already thought so last night. So, if you’re not completely opposed to seeing someone at the moment… I’d be glad if you considered me.”
"Have you ordered yet?" he asks, looking curiously into the kitchen.
A defiant reaction rose up in him immediately. What is that supposed to mean? Of course, he means it. How much effort does this guy think it took him to send the letter? He almost destroyed the note in his fireplace and swore he would never think about Drew again, but a few angry stomps through his room and the subsiding of the first emotional wave later, his defiance was joined by joy and understanding. Harry, admittedly, had not been particularly consistent up to this point in expressing interest in further contact. He himself would have been the first to approach the whole thing with suspicion. Nevertheless, it cost him a great deal of pride-swallowing to compose a second message affirming his serious intentions.
"It does, yes," Harry admits contritely.
Until, a week later on Sunday night, he can't stand the dissonance inside him any longer.
“Correct”, he acknowledges and proceed to collect his trousers, which lie not far away from where Drew had picked up his boxers. Unfortunately, Drew hasn’t moved since, and Harry finds himself to be awkwardly close and exposed to his observation while executing the humiliating act of bowing down to gather the very same clothes that only hours before were peeled from his body, by this very same man.
"Harry, I think he’s waving you over.” And right Cas is.
“As you please”, Drew says and opens the door, guiding the way in a butler’s manner. Grinning fat, Harry can’t be told twice. The room is basically just a narrow short windowless hallway with a wooden spiral staircase in the middle.
In helplessness because of his current poor eyesight, he fishes for whatever piece of clothes lies in front of him on the floor. The touch of the fabric alone tells him, that he was not successful in catching one of his. He’s never really had high quality wool in his hands, so Harry wouldn’t know exactly the value of this piece of tweed trousers in his hands. But he’s certain, it must be very pricy. And that it’s indeed a pair of trousers.
Harry sighs. "We talked this over more than twenty times now, haven’t we? I don't want to go public... And I'm pretty sure it's not an option to have a relationship, that heavily relies on the use of polyjuice." The topic stings Harry's guts.
“I don’t even know, if he wasn’t there just by chance. Maybe that’s why he was so angry.”
Harry's stomach still makes uncomfortable hops when he thinks of her first return from Drew. First, she was gone for considerably longer than it would normally take to get from his flat to Soho and back, and then it looked like she was coming with no news either. It wasn't until she had settled on Harry's shoulder and claimed a few cuddles that she dropped a small note from her beak. It contained four simple words
Drew inhales deeply. "Why? I mean, why did you change your mind?"
"It's me, Harry. I... drank some polyjuice potion", he admits, which earns him Falk’s elbow in the rips. "Come on you spoilsport, why are you already out with the truth? Don’t you see a perfect prank template presented on a silver plate?"
Both their stomachs are complaining audibly by now, and Drew offers to toast a few slices of bread and spread them with butter or something similar as a makeshift solution. Giggling, the two men stand in the corner of the kitchen, enjoying their more than needy dinner to a disproportionate degree, but probably even more enjoying each other's company.
“Nghh... fuck”, he gulps and buries his hands in Drew’s hair, bucks his pelvis in self-takeover for a few last thrusts, and climaxes. The brilliant shudder of unadulterated pleasure crushes him. Stars before his eyes and a mild tinnitus overshadow a coughing Drew in the background, and the usual urge to indulge in further sexual activities, and to return the favor at least.
Fortunately, the second reply provoked fewer defensive reactions in Harry. Drew was much more detailed and emotional about continuing to stand by his offer to get to know Harry.
Drew follows hastily.
“See you.”
As Cas' words continue to echo in Harry's head over the course of the next week, he knows that she is right and that he is indeed in danger of becoming stagnant in the wake of his self-imposed independence and overcautiousness, if he does not significantly and actively change his behaviour. But not only that. He notices with horror that he has developed tendencies to reject even his friends' attempts to approach him, at the latest when he only lets Ron's owl Tex in after four minutes of penetrative knocking on his window pane. A coping mechanism that is only slightly effective in avoiding having to deal with unpleasant things, such as being reminded that he may have to rethink his principles.
“What’s there?”
"I need some coffee and hangover potion", Harry murmurs.
Uneasy, he fiddles pointlessly with one of the handles of the cauldron in which a less than appetizing liquid is simmering away.
“Aw. I’m so excited”, Hermione joins in. “I really hope, it turns out well, for the both of you. And don’t hesitate to consult me next time, something buggers you.” She takes his hand to squeeze it encouraging.
"What if we both fail?"
"Harry, what the...? You wake up in your ONS's place and the first thing you do is accuse him of trying to sell you to the press?" It doesn't feel pleasant to be paraded like this, even if Harry knows Cas is right.
Harry swallows hard. No matter how many different blokes he already had the pleasure to try out, their polyjuice potion never tasted good. But it’s a welcome torture, besides the accompanying pain, for the advantages he got out of it.
He breathes a sigh of relief when he can see Cas' name at the foot of the paper roll. So, this seems to be her owl, then. Fitting, Harry realises as he scratches the bird's feathers on the back of its neck. A sublime yet discreet alien beauty with a mysterious aura about her. The aslant dark eyes in its heart-shaped face actually remind him of Cas facial features as well.
In sudden apprehension, he raises his head, searches the room, but he is definitely alone. At least as far as he can tell in this bloody big loft. Now that it’s daylight - judging from the brightness it must be past high noon, already - he can make out the layout much better. The bed he sits in stands in a room sized alcove of the ‘main room’, if you could call it that. To his right is a big window wall facing the inconspicuous backyard. On his left side he sees most of the living area and the other window front, that faces the street and shares the view of the Thames. Looking up he sees a grid of wooden beams, whereas the real ceiling extents far above, probably in the form of a gable roof, as Harry can only suspects due to his myopia. The floor is covered with parquet;  its dark colour combined with the red brick walls, the raw wood collums and ostentatios furniture emminates the vibe of a neoclassical english manor morphed with a new york industrial apartment. The undeniable classiness screams to be further explored and Harry’s inclined to do so, if it wasn’t for his horrible headache, and the fact that the owner of the flat probably was somewhere in this flat, wondering why the fuck he woke up with Harry Potter lying beside him.
Once finished they retreat back to slouch on the couches until at 1 am Harry jumps up, startled by the early hours and affirming he has to leave because he has work to attend to tomorrow, not because he's had enough of the evening.
"Guilty. Sorry, I'm not really awake yet either, and discreetly overwhelmed," Drew says plaintively. It's undeniable that he's probably just as uncomfortable as Harry, despite his placid façade. And normally Harry would take that into account, try to put himself at least somewhat in the other's shoes. But just now? Impossible, not when his only hold and sense of control lay in putting on his own clothes.
"Harry!" she exclaims, falling into his arms with a laugh. "Thanks for having me."
“Well, I’m not begging you”, says, yet moves in closer. Drews hand still lingers next to Harry’s head and starts to firmly rake through his hair, fastens its grip around some strands in the nape of his neck.
“Nothing brightens up my day more, than knowing you have been well entertained.”
"So, you don't think I'd just like to have a nice evening with my best friends?", Harry brings the conversation back to the topic at hand.
"The absence of a lurid article in the Daily Prophet made me wonder. I thought I'd better check to make sure you hadn't fallen into a permanent coma from sensationalism."
“Apparently I did”, he shrugs, his smile fading to a scowl.
As distraction he finds his own path through the crowd towards Falk and joins him in dancing mindlessly and probably very disgracefully to the fast beats. He is torn out of his trance when a grimily faced Cassiopeia appears in front of his eyes. "He's LITERALLY all yours", she announced her defeat. Harry stops and feels torn out of a bubble not moving every one of his muscles anymore. He could not tell how much time has passed. His sweat drained shirt and hair indicate at least half an hour.
When he can no longer bear the idea of his sight, he finally gets up and freshens up at the sink, though he soon accepts that a shower might be of more use.
“Let’s continue tomorrow”, a soothing voice says. Harry nods, ready to give in to the need of sleep. But something, habit, withholds him. “I should leave”, he replies. Not quite a convincing statement, when the utterer barley moves one inch, not to speak of his closed eyelids.
"I can only repeat myself. I have no intention of telling anyone about this unless it is in your best interest. I like you off your game and I bet I’ll like you when you’re running at top form, if you let me get to know this side of you. Otherwise... I will, of course, give you a proper send-off”, Drew's appeasement ends in defeated resignation. Harry can’t help but be moved by it. But he has set it in his head that one-night stands remain one-night stands, and once he has an attitude, he stubbornly follows it. Attitudes do not come from nowhere. He has good reasons for holding them, and in the end it was this quality of his that saved him from many wrong decisions and ultimately even death.
It takes no second for Harry to realize it was trance-night tonight. Not his favourite genre but usually it attracts the open-minded portion of young wizards, so that’s a plus. He always notices with interest which parts of muggle culture is adapted to the wizarding world, and music must be the greatest probably.
"Sit down, I'll be done in a minute”, Drew says and ushers Harry towards the leather couches, then disappears back into the bathroom.
"I hope I wasn’t misinterpreting the situation. It’s just, someone concealing their real name doesn’t quite give off the ‘earnest dating’ impression."
Harry sighs "Sorry, for the life of me I didn't think that far ahead when I sent Siora off." He shakes his head unconsciously. "If I remember correctly, I wasn't thinking much at all, except that I hoped I didn't make the wrong decision."
“No, that’s very much my own fault. I think, you can guess, that you weren’t supposed to learn about this. Especially not in this ungallant way.” He almost laughs at the absurdity of the situation. Here he sits on an iniquitous pricey couch in the care of an irresistible attractive man, on a dignified Saturday that screams to be spend solely with careless lazing and fucking around, and all he can wish for is to be at home in his bed and sober up, preferably alone in the comfortable certitude of preserved anonymity.
Harry can’t shake off the impression of Blondie watching their every movements and words. His eyes are definitely directed at them. He gulps and tries for a wry smile. Blondie laughs, and the music is definitely too loud but Harry could swear, he not only saw but heard it. Maybe some amplifying charm? Harry wonders if that was possible, drifting away in his mind.
“Can someone tell me, what I missed to catch up?”, Ron laments.
While he is putting away the foods packaging, he remembers that he still has Drew's unread message waiting for him in his pocket. In all the commotion, he has completely forgotten to look at what it says.
Harry awakens with throbbing pain in his head. His tactile sense tells him, he’s lying in a bed. He blinks. His visual sense tells him, it's way too bright for his eyes and that the relevant bed is not his own bed. It also informs him, that he's seeing all that through a blurry veil, hinting he's not wearing his glasses. Mindlessly he fumbles for his wand on the nightstand, but is not rewarded.
“Are you inviting me?”, Drew smirks, while his eyes blaze with desire.
Nessja's more frequent gnawing on his finger makes clear, the owl's displeasure with her errand duties. "I'm sorry. Just this once more," Harry reassures her and writes his reply as succinctly as possible
"Err...", he hasn't expected his private outing to go this smoothly. "I guess. I actually haven't quite looked around yet." With which he catches up immediately. He scans the moving people, stopping every now and then to examine a person in deeper detail, but none of those present stick remarkably to his mind.
“Okay, all worries and bad experiences aside. Will you see again?”, Cas shoves away the last traces of his sudden sorrow, and Harry is absolutely grateful to her for that.
"What?" asks Drew, brought back to the present by Harry's words.
“Oh”, Hermione turns white. “Shucks, that was unprofessional, I really shouldn’t have. I made his acquaintance at work, the other day. He’s one of the lesser friendly owls, if I ought to say so.”
Then he taps around the corner towards where he remembers the kitchenette to be in search of any liquid to moist his throat. Coming from the same direction, he again hears, now lesser faint, "shit"s. They presumably come from the bathroom, of which’s localisation behind a retrospectively erected wall he’s now aware.
"Up for it?" Drew murmurs in his ear. Harry’s heartbeat quickens. Everything until now was obviously just foreplay for this offer. As sure as it was to happen, now that these words are actually spoken in finality, Harry’s just as bedazzled.
So yeah, this chapter has little angsty parts (though I intend the story to be fluff and emotional growth), and is still mostly character building, not much happening.
"Thanks," Harry says, accepting the cup. He can't help but compare every movement, every word with the last time he was there, as Drew sits down across from him and rests his forearms on his knees, his upper body leaning towards him. Harry surveys him in silent anticipation, something he had studiously avoided the last time. The reason goes without saying; Drew is just outrageously good looking. If he had exposed himself to this sight for a longer period of time, who would have been able to tell whether he wouldn't have folded sooner or later that morning. The irony of him now sitting here again anyway, does not escape him.
“Harry, no!”
“Hey, you little nut case. How come Harry’s being spared?”, Hermione nags. “He wouldn’t leave Maggie alone until she gave him an unreasonable number of pellets for his ‘services’. I shushed him away. Ouch”, she wails, as Peagreen decided to retaliate her snide comment and started to peck on her hair. “Well, he obviously took a grudge on me for that.”
His initial plan to convince with his handsomeness he already wrote off. So, humour and wit it has to be. “Maybe I’ll classify your case as a pilot study.”
"Congrats", Falk flashes a big smile and pats Harry's Shoulder in approval, "I knew you'd make it. Looks like soon we’ll have people busting the store again." Harry grins in self-confidence and lets his glance sway over the club’s guests. Until now he hasn't really spotted someone that caught his eye. “Thanks. Which is exactly why I want to round it up with a good fuck tonight, before I’ll be busy with work day and night again."
(See the end of the chapter for
"Hug me", Drew, who’s raised his head due the turmoil, says, a slight smirk across his mouth.
“Fine”, a disappointed Drew surrenders. “Just let me go to the bathroom, then I’ll send you off.”
“Thank you. Nice sprint you did there”, Drew mocks, as he strolls closer.
“Okay, I’m sorry”, a pouty Cassiopeia mumbles, not quite taking the hint, that Harry would like to bring the conversation to an end.
Harry, in Gryffindor manner, can be in no way inferior and take such exposure by giving in. “No, it’s fine”, he barks, and defiantly locks eyes with Drew as the pair of trousers slides down his legs and reveals his by now subsided boner. Drew tries to keep his cool, but his gaze more than once slips suspiciously to lower regions than Harry’s eyes, while Harry takes an outrageous long time to get back into his boxers.
Despite his best efforts, his hair is sticking out in all directions, as if he had been on a four-hour test flight. At least his jeans fit well and emphasize his trained legs. He will probably have to rely on that, and of course on his irresistible charm, if he wants to be convincing on his upcoming date. Somehow this feels familiar to his last encounter with Drew.
“No, of course not. I still don’t know if he’s not up to no good, though”, Harry keeps resisting.
Harry watched his boyfriend intently. “Love, you are so worthy of everything involving me and happiness. You are so incredible and beautiful, Draco. There is no one else in the world I want to spend my life with. And yes I said life, not time. You haven’t a clue how much you truly mean to me. I know it hasn’t been very long that we have been together but it feels like a lifetime and I can’t imagine my life without you. What I’m trying to say is that I’m hopeless in love with you. I know it seems early in our relationship but it seems like we’ve been building up to this moment for years since the beginning when we met at Hogwarts. I wanted to let you know how I truly feel about you. I couldn’t hold it in any longer.” He kissed Draco quickly and pulled away smiling. “I love you, Draco Malfoy.”
Harry smiled. “Okay. Let me know if I hurt you or want me to stop.” Draco nodded once again. “Oh and just so you know this may hurt a bit. I need to prep you first.” Draco looked at Harry eagerly. “Roll onto your stomach and get on your hands and knees while I prep you.” Draco obeyed. Once he was on his hands and knees, Harry slathered his middle finger with lube. Draco watched him intently.
Harry nodded. “I see a few that seem perfect.” He choose the ones he thought Draco would love.
The wedding bands had just one band with swirls of green on it.
Draco was so lost in thought that he did not notice Winky had arrived. "Master Draco, Mr. Harry Potter has arrived for tea. Shall I escort him into the sitting room?"
Draco nodded. “I would love that.” He stood up so Harry could lay down.
"My darling Draco, that is something you will have to ask Mr. Potter himself. He is the only one who know the answer." Narcissa said coyly.
Hermione gazed at Severus for a moment. "Sev, it is reassuring to know that you were not entirely repulsed by a muggleborn's hug. But as much as I would like to continue our little banter, I really need to get back to my parents. We should have tea at some point in the future. I would very much like to get know you more." She gave him a sickeningly sweet smirk.
Draco got Hermione's attention. "Severus summoned Harry because I had nightmares last night and was screaming so loudly that I broke through my wards. Severus and Mother woke up and ran to my room. They woke me up and asked if I was okay. They suggested that I take a break from the Manor and contacted Harry to see if he would be willing to let me stay with him. Obviously he was and here we are having breakfast with you." He smiled softly at her.
As tea started to wind down, guests started to leave. Of course Molly hugged each and every one of them goodbye. Draco and Harry were the last to leave. They chatted with Molly a bit before heading out. They were going to say goodbye to Ron but he had vanished. Probably licking his wounds after being attacked by everyone, though rightly so considering how he treated his supposed friends. Again Molly hugged them tightly and kissed them on their cheeks.
Harry chuckled. “Bloody hell is right! Dray, I literally have no words for how I feel.” He pulled Draco closer and kissed him softly. “I love you so much, Dray. More every day.” He smiled.
Once they were on the floor that Harry's bedroom is on, Harry turned to Draco. "I was wondering if you would like to have your own bedroom or you could stay in my bed with me. It's up to you. No pressure."
Narcissa smiled. “Well someone other than Hermione has to put him in his place sometimes. Otherwise his ego would be too inflated to deal with.” She smirked. “Let us have tea. I believe it is ready now.” Narcissa walked out of the room and Harry followed.
Once inside Harry conjured his stag and it walked between him and Draco as they walked to the visitor area. The guard steered them into a room and when they looked inside, there they saw a disheveled Lucius waiting for them.
Remus sighed. “Siri love, you do realise that you have been dead for quite some time. And I do not see Voldemort here and this place feels lighter and the decor has changed. It has a woman’s touch. Narcissa’s I presume.”
Harry kissed Draco’s shoulder blade. “I never thought I’d see the day where I fell in love. I thought I was destined to save the wizarding world and sacrifice myself for the greater good and to let others live in freedom. You make my supposed short life change into something truly worth living. I love you with all my heart as well, Dray.”
Severus watched with curiosity as he held Hermione’s hand. “I am not at all surprised by Mr. Weasley’s shrewdness. He was never one to hold his tongue when necessary.” He sneered at Ron.
Harry stared at Draco in wonder. "Actually I'd love to come by for a seekers game. It would be nice to make more pleasant memories here. The piano? How am I not surprised you play. Would you ever play for me? I always liked the sound of the piano. I have to agree that it's peaceful." He said hopefully.
Severus stepped back a bit. “Thank you for the tea and the company. I had a lovely time with you. I look forward to our next adventure.” He stepped towards the floo.
Harry chuckled. “Oh I’m sorry your highness for disturbing your beauty sleep. At least you aren’t being pecked at by a bloody crazy owl!” He huffed. “By the way, meet Errol he’s the Weasley’s senile old owl.”
Narcissa nodded. "Severus, if you have a chance at true happiness, do not disregard the possibility of it happening no matter who it may be. Life is too short as you know all too well." She walked away leaving him with his thoughts.
Hope to hear from you soon.
Draco took the letter from her and sat down next to Harry. He analysed every part of the letter before he started to open it.
Harry nervously gulped looking at Snape and Narcissa. "I, umm, thought after Draco had some nightmares, it was best if he didn't sleep alone. I was worried he may have more if he didn't feel safe. And thankfully he didn't have any more nightmares last night so my idea worked."
Potter smirked. "Draco, do you have a problem with me calling you by your first name? I thought we were over childish antics." He took a huge bite out of his sandwich waiting for Malfoy's response.
Harry smiled. "Thank you. You're always the best, Hermione." He hugged her back.
Albus
Winky looked at Draco with concern. "Master Draco must eat breakfast. It's the most important meal of the day. Or so I've heard."
Pansy was the first to speak. “The ballsiness of that little Weasel! Ugh!” She growled.
Narcissa admonished her son "Oh Draco do behave yourself when Mr. Potter does show up. He has done so much for us. More than I would ever thought possible. Please be courteous."
Severus sighed once again. “Hermione, I am in love with you.” He looked at her waiting for a response.
Severus' eyes widened. "Narcissa, I have not a clue as to what you are prattling on about. Please do not meddle in my affairs." He gave her a stern look.
Hermione and Kreacher left them to go to the kitchen.
Ron observed Harry trying to think of what to say. "So out with it. Please tell us what happened."
Harry got a bit teary eyed. “I never thought I’d ever be lucky enough to find someone as brilliant and unique as Draco. I also never thought I’d fall for him but it happened and I couldn’t be more happy. I do plan to marry him some day. I was hoping he’d take my last name. Imagine Harry James Malfoy? The Prophet would have an absolute field day with that. I can imagine all the hate mail I’d get for changing my name to a former Death Eater’s. I suppose if he took the last name Black, I could change mine to that but I do like the sound of Draco Lucius Potter. You really think of me as a son already? Never in my wildest dreams, I thought I’d have one motherly figure in my life but having two is unfathomable and incredible. And it means a lot that I have your support wholeheartedly.”
Once they recovered from apparating, Draco pulled Harry closer to him. "So where is my proper goodbye? And what does it entail?" He teased.
Harry looked at Draco and smiled. "Hermione would be perfect to recite those words. You remember how important pronunciation is to her, right? She used to lecture Ron and I all the bloody time about how we could potentially get killed if we said something wrong."
Ron gave Hermione a strange look. "Bloody hell! If either of you think this is going to end well, you're both daft!" He shook his head.
Harry had tears in his eyes, not knowing what to say. He was about to respond when Hermione entered the room. He smiled at her grateful.
The morning after the debacle involving the infamous Lucius Malfoy, Harry wanted to lift Draco’s spirits up. He quietly left their bed and went downstairs to compose letters to Pansy Parkinson and Blaise Zabini, his boyfriend’s best friends. He sent his owl to deliver the letters. Now all he could do was wait. In case Draco’s friends did not write back, he opened the floo and added their magical signatures to the list of people who had access to his floo. Harry turned to go back upstairs but was interrupted by two Slytherins arguing and stumbling into his living room. In front of him was Pansy and Blaise bickering like a married couple. Both stopped dead in their tracks staring at Harry. It was one of the most painfully awkward moments in his life and he had his fair share of those.
Pansy stepped forward. “Such big words for a Gryffindor.” She smirked.
Draco mulled over his words. “I want to experience it the Muggle way. No magic. Just us. Please.” Harry then opened the draw and got lube. He was about to reach for a condom but Draco shook his head. Harry smiled lovingly at Draco and nodded.
Draco hugged his mother back. "I love you too, Mother. I will be in touch. I am sure Harry would not allow me to forget to write or visit you." He smirked at Harry.
Harry nuzzled closer into Draco and whispered. “It will be okay. I am right here.”
Draco sighed loudly. "I do not even know how he would react if I sent him an owl. What if he informs the Ministry that I am harassing him?"
"Mother, why did you have to embarrass me even more? Can you not see I am already suffering?" Draco angrily said. He felt like he was going to cry but he had to calm himself. He already allowed Potter to see him vulnerable in sixth year. He could not allow it again.
Severus smiled a bit. "No need to apologise or thank me, Miss Granger. What I did for our world was the right course of action. And it was my mission to be the loathsome Potions professor so loyal Death Eater families would not question my allegiance and suspect me of betrayal. Though, to be honest, I am rather dastardly and off-putting even without a mission of subterfuge. If I am spot on with my memory, Albus always teased that I was an acquired taste." He wistfully smiled at Albus' portrait who nodded and chuckled. Severus looked a little sad but as soon as he noticed others staring him, he once again looked stony faced.
Draco took a few moments before answering. "I think I would rather sleep next to you, Harry. You make me feel safe and maybe you will keep the nightmares away."
Narcissa laughed. “Harry, you do not have to be so nervous around me when talking about my son. I know you love him and you take great care of him. That is all I need to know. As long as Draco is happy, I see no reason to worry. He could not be in more capable hands. I trust you.” She reached for his hand and squeezed it reassuringly.
Harry shook his head. "I'm not sure what he has planned but I'm really looking forward to spending more time with him. Hermione, you're the only one I trust with this information but I really like him. We agreed to just be friends until our friends start to feel more comfortable with us." He blushed.
Harry hugged him. “Thank you! I’m glad we’re not at odd anymore. I’ve missed you. And as for Hermione, she’s on board with my idea. She just wasn’t sure you’d come.”
Minnie shook her head and chuckled. "Albus always loved surprises and his cryptic wording."
Hermione sighed. “It is not stupid at all. I completely understand why you want him here. I will owl him.”
Harry spoke up. "Last night I was summoned by Snape to go to the Manor."
Severus interrupted. “What is done is done. There is no turning back. All that matters is how we act now. A lot has changed. Old friends lost, new friends found.” He smiled fondly at all his former students.
Harry chuckled. “Yes he did. Much to Hermione’s surprise as I’m sure you can imagine.”
Hermione smiled. “That is quite true. I remember when she sent a howler to Ron after he stole the family’s flying car in second year. His reaction was beyond priceless. He looked pretty mortified but also completely terrified. That day I learned to never get on Molly’s bad side. She is not a force to be reckoned with.” She chuckled softly.
Hermione looked curiously at Severus. “Whatever it is you can tell me, Sev.” She placed her delicate hand on top of his and gently squeezed.
Harry grabbed a fist full of Draco’s hair in one hand and pulled him into another searing kiss. He started to caress Draco everywhere. They shifted a bit and both gasped as their erections touched. Harry slowly removed Draco’s trousers and pants and then his own. When they were both starkers, Harry could not stop staring at Draco’s body.
Draco had tears running down his cheek. “Yes, Harry James Potter, I would love to marry you and one day call you my husband.”
Hermione smiled brightly. “I like the sound of it too.” She thought for a moment. “The day I marry you will be one of my happiest and most memorable days ever in my life. Right up there with when I was accepted into Hogwarts and my first day at Hogwarts.”
As they drank their tea, Harry recounted the afternoon with the Malfoys. He did not tell his friends everything that happened for obvious reasons.
Harry bit his lip. “I know we were odds about who I was with but I didn’t feel right about not having you come with me and Hermione. The thing is that I’m planning to propose to Draco and I would like it if you and Hermione went with me to buy a ring. I understand if you don’t feel comfortable going with us since you aren’t a fan of Severus or Draco but I still wanted to ask you just in case.” He continued to pace.
Hermione smiled widely. “It is a date, Sev.” She moved closer to him and pulled him into a hug. As she pulled back, he gave her a searing kiss like she had a few moments ago.
Draco's face turn a bit red in embarrassment at his confession. "I did not mean to be so forthright but yes you heard correctly. I am not into women. I figured out that was the case during fourth year while the Triwizard Tournament was going on actually."
"Mother, I am going to sit by the garden until Potter arrives." He said softly.
Severus and Narcissa had just finished their lunch with Draco and Harry. They had just said their goodbyes. As they walked into the room with the ornate fireplace, Severus and Narcissa were startled by the presence of one Hermione Granger looking like she had seen a ghost.
Again Severus sighed loudly and turned back to face Narcissa. “Bloody hell woman! Why must you know everything? You know what, forget it. I will just tell you so you leave me bloody well alone. We kissed a few times. One was quite passionate since I know you will ask about what type of kisses we shared. However, I am not telling you every sordid detail of our encounter.” He huffed out the response and turned on his heel and walked away leaving Narcissa before she could say anything else.
Severus was at a loss for words and grimaced. “You can not be serious. I am a Death Eater. You can not possibly trust me that much. Um, this was a mistake. I should not have come.” He looked away from Hermione and started to stand.
Lily chuckled at the two of them. “Ohhh you two are shamelessly cute! What do you say James, cuddle with me?” She smirked while mocking Sirius. “In all seriousness though, I think we all could use some rest.”
Both were greeted by Hermione hugging them. “Merlin Harry! I thought you were not coming back. It has been nearly twenty minutes.”
Draco laid his head once again on Harry’s chest. “Let us rest some more. We deserve it.” He smirked into his chest pillow. Harry nodded in agreement and kissed the top of Draco’s head. They fell asleep together wrapped in each other’s arms with soft smiles upon their faces.
Draco got up and left the room. Harry followed. Both sat on the sofa again and stared at one another.
Draco finished his lunch and called for Winky. He told her to find his best casual Muggle clothing. Once he made his way up the stair to his bedroom, he showered and got dressed. Winky had left him black skinny jeans with a dark green t-shirt. A perfect Malfoy outfit that was appropriate for the Muggle world. He looked in the mirror to make sure he looked flawless for his Harry. He approved of his appearance and left his bedroom and made his way down the stairs.
Harry was once again alone. “Kreacher, I need to speak with you.”
Draco observed his mother curiously once again. "To be honest, I had hoped I would never see him again. I guess I am not very lucky since he is gracing us with his presence later on today."
It was Harry's turn to blush ferociously. "Umm, I, uhhh, hmm, really didn't realise I had such an effect on you. I'm astonished that anyone would feel that way about me. Ugh, I wish we didn't have to wait to be more than friends. It's, uh, almost painful not be close to you. I can't believe just admitted that and I should learn to think before I speak. Now, I feel the need to hide and never be seen again. I really need to talk about something. Hermione will definitely be pleased that you'd like to get to know her and find her brilliant. As for Ron, I know he and his family aren't your favourite people in the world but thank you for hoping he has a change of heart. Though I'm not so optimistic but Hermione has said she'll talk to Molly about his behaviour. I guess we'll see what happens after Molly speaks with him. He hasn't always been the most loyal or there for me kind of friend but I'm so thankful I have Hermione's friendship. She's literally my rock. She truly is my best friend. And then there's you. Someone I've never imagined I could get along with. It was an instant connection. Of course there's still some teasing and the snark but truthfully I wouldn't want it any other way. I think, uhh, you're quite brilliant and lovely to be around. I never thought I'd say that about you but I have the tendency to judge before knowing someone and I am sorry about that. We were both foolish children back in first year. I'm happy to know we've moved on from our foolishness. As for your friends, I'm truly looking forward to getting to know Blaise but I'm slightly terrified of Pansy if I'm being honest. Our last encounter wasn't exactly awe inspiring as you recall." He chuckled a bit.
Severus smiled when he heard her say his first name. "We all have our moments after a great trauma. No need to feel embarrassed. It is only natural to react that way." He sat next to her and gathered her hand in his.
Hermione shyly looked at Severus. “Yes they left and will not be back until late. Sit, the tea is ready.” She placed everything on the table. They both sat down.
Harry responded eagerly to the kiss. He gently pushed Draco down onto his back. As he deepened the kiss, Draco moaned and kissed him with everything he had.
Draco smiled softly. “It was lovely. Winky was so pleased to serve us.” He chuckled.
Harry, Draco and Hermione were watching the exchange between Dumbledore, Snape and Minnie in amusement. All three were highly entertained. Harry watched Snape with curiosity, Hermione watched Snape in awe and Draco watched Snape with pride.
Hermione and Ron both got up and hugged Harry and smiled.
Sirius just stared where Kreacher had been. “Bloody hell! He is still alive and kicking. And he is nice? What did you do to him, Harry?”
Severus was in deep thought. "Thank you for looking into the spell. I appreciate it. At least I know how he performed the spell. I still do not understand why he would want to bring me back though." He sighed.
Harry hugged and kissed him once more. "Until next time, Malfoy." He smirked back.
Hermione nodded. "I know they will be fine. I just worry because I am not there with them. Whenever Ron and Harry did anything without me they would some how mess everything up or nearly get caught. We joke about me being the brains in the friend group but I really am most of the time. I should be comforted in the fact that Harry is with Draco who is just as intelligent as I am. Gosh, I am making myself sound so superior to my friends." She chuckled to herself and blushed.
Lily finally looked at her son. “Harry??” She quickly walked over to him. “Would it be okay if I hugged you?” He nodded and she hugged him. Both had tears in their eyes. “I never thought I would get the chance to physically hug you. I wished for it to happen and now it has. One of my happiest moments ever!” She hugged him again.
"Yes we do have quidditch in common. We should have a seekers game sometime if you ever return to the Manor. As for interests, I could start with what I do in my spare time. I have been playing piano since I was a child. I always found peace playing. Especially during the darker time living in the Manor. I needed the distraction sadly." Draco said softly.
Once inside Harry smiled at him. "Well isn't this a pleasant surprise! I thought you were going to send an owl, not that I'm complaining. I'm happy you're here. Let's sit. Would you like some tea?"
Minnie walked over to her floo and opened it so Hermione could come right through without announcing herself first.
Hermione looked at him sympathetically. "Here's an idea. Draco, you could come with me and use my floo. And from there you could apparate."
Harry was silent for a moment. “As annoying as it will be, I think I should start looking in wizarding jewellery stores. I’m sure I’ll be harassed to no end.”
Molly nodded. “Yes he’s here. I’ll go fetch him. Sit, sit.”
Severus caressed her cheek. “Hermione, you never cease to amaze me in every way possible. How do you do that?”
Severus rolled his eyes. “I am not at all surprised, Miss Granger. Though, you are the only one to reap all the benefits of my so-called softer side.” He quirked his eyebrow up and smirked.
Draco jumped a bit not realising Snape was listening. "Mother is doing well especially without Father around. I have missed you, Severus." He smiled fondly at his godfather.
Harry picked up the ring Hermione pointed to. The ring had two intertwined bands. One was all white gold and the other was reminiscent of a snake with some areas tinged green. It also had an emerald in the centre of the band. Harry smiled widely at Hermione.
Severus stepped back a bit and nodded. “You truly are a cheeky one.” He teased back. “Unfortunately it appears that you are right. I do have to leave soon. We do not want Narcissa to send out a search party.”
Draco walked over and wrapped his arms around Harry and kissed his shoulder. "Dray is a sweet nickname and I like it. Harry, I would do anything for you too."
Ron awkwardly stood up with tears in his eyes. He slinked over to the floo and looked back at Harry and Hermione who were both watching him with such fury in their eyes. He frowned and vanished into the floo.
James grunted. “This can’t be happening! You want to be friends with a Death Eater? Are you out of your mind?” He sighed. “It’s bad enough our son is marrying into a Death Eater family!” Everyone was shocked by what he said.
Harry looked away embarrassed. “It just kinda hit me that my parents, Sirius and Remus won’t be here for my wedding. I always wished they could all be there. I know I have the Weasleys, you and Draco but it still feels like something is missing.” A tear ran down his cheek.
Draco stepped forward and wrapped his arms around Harry. He looked straight into Harry’s eyes. “This time you are forgiven, future husband of mine. But remember next time wake me up when you leave, okay?” Harry nodded in agreement.
Harry groaned. “Dray, I don’t want to get up. I’m comfy where I am.” He pouted.
Draco nodded and sighed. "Of course you are right yet again. Harry has never cared for the press or their impression of him. I just want him to get hurt because of me. It would not seem right for him to get punished for my past." He looked down sadly.
Severus nodded. “Very well. I am quite pleased to know that you will be living with me soon. Let me know when you have discussed everything with your parents and I will come by to assist you.” He smiled softly at her.
Hermione stopped and turned. “Sev! You came. I was not sure since I did not hear from you.” She walked up to him and kissed his cheek. She blushed a bit.
Draco nodded in understanding. "You like me too? I never in my wildest dreams I would have thought this was ever true. And it makes sense we let our friends get used to us getting along and see that we can be friends. I am not upset by your idea of being just friends for awhile. Surprisingly I agree. It would be just weird that we are suddenly dating after despising each other for the last seven years. It is better to ease them into the idea of us being together." He blushed again thinking about dating the great Saviour, Harry Potter.
Hermione was practically tomato red. "Thank you for being so good-natured about my behaviour. And it is not every day you are hugged back by the half-blood prince." She teased back which earned her a blush from Severus.
Harry blushed a bit. "Hermione, after getting back here we had tea and talked. Dray and I decided not wait to be together. He told me that Severus said that he shouldn't have to hide us from the world and what we mean to each other just to make others happy. I agreed with him and I asked him to be my boyfriend. And obviously he said yes. We decided to stay in the same bed because we both thought it would keep the nightmares away and thankfully it worked and we slept very peacefully." He reached for Draco's hand and squeezed it.
"It's fine, Draco. Really it is. After everything I'm just happy for her and Luna. To be honest, I was a bit surprised though. How about you? Dating anyone? I always thought you were with Parkinson." Harry said.
Blaise could not hold in his laughter anymore. “Bloody hell! I do not think I have had this much entertainment since before Voldemort was resurrected. It is never a dull moment when there are Gryffindors around. And Hermione it is a pleasure to have you in exclusive snake club.” He also winked at Hermione.
Severus' eyes visibly widened at the nickname because that is what Lily used to call him before Hogwarts and their early years at school. "I suppose you make a good point, Hermione. Though Draco has you and Harry now." He smiled sadly.
Harry huffed out a chuckle. “This surprise is worth it.” He gets off the bed and literally drags Draco out of bed. “You are coming with me whether you like it or not.”
Harry was about to respond but Draco and Narcissa distracted him as they descended the stairs. Draco looked so exhausted. Harry smiled at him warmly. When they reached the bottom of the stairway, Draco walked over to Harry and wrapped his arms around him. Harry wrapped his arms around Draco as well.
Slowly, Harry slid his middle finger into Draco. Harry moaned at the sensation and Draco hissed at the burn. “Relax, Dray. I’ll take care of you.” His finger bottomed out.
Hermione stopped at her bedroom doorway. “Well, this is my sanctuary. It is not very big since most of it is filled with books.” Severus stepped forward and looked inside her bedroom. In the middle of the room sat a queen sized bed. Bookshelves filled to the brim lined the walls from floor to ceiling. There were books stacked up on the floor as well. The whole room screamed Hermione Granger.
Hermione nodded. “Well, we could change your appearance or use Polyjuice. It is up to you.”
Narcissa stepped forward. "I saw how you were looking at him. Does he feel the same? I just want to protect you my darling boy." She kissed the top of his head.
Harry hugged Ron once again. “Come on we shouldn’t make Hermione wait any longer.”
Ron was the first to speak. "Mate, so how did go with the little white ferret? I see you are still among the living."
Hermione looked at him. “You speechless? That is quite unheard of.” She teased. “I suppose you will need to leave shortly since it is getting a bit late. I am sure Narcissa is impatiently waiting for you to return.” She smirked.
Harry nodded. "Yes, I'll see you down there." He was smiling like a loon as well.
Draco nodded and leaned into the hug. “I do not think I will ever be ready for this particular conversation but it needs to happen. I do not want my father to find out from some prison guard, who is just out for revenge, that his only son is gay. I just can not happen like that. No matter what kind of person he is, he deserves the truth from the source and not from some random person.”
Draco looked at Harry. “You can move now. I need to feel you.” Harry started moving his finger in and out causing Draco to moan. “Mo-or-re, please.” Harry nodded and added his index finger. He continued to pump into Draco faster. Both were moaning so loudly. “Mo-or-re…” And Harry added his ring finger and hit Draco’s sweet spot every time he plunged back in causing him to shout Harry’s name.
Draco sat next to Harry. “How did Weasley behave? Respectful I hope.”
Throughout his childhood Draco kept hearing about The Boy Who Lived and he was always curious about the hero. His father was livid that Potter "defeated" Voldemort when he was a baby. Though it was really Lily Potter who defeated Voldemort since it was her ultimate sacrifice and love that kept Harry safe.
"Oh my. I am sorry to hear that. I really did not mean to pry." Draco said awkwardly.
Harry shook his head as he chuckled and wrote a quick reply. Once he was done he attached the letter to Errol’s leg and the owl flew off in zig zags.
Harry stills nonplussed. "Drew?", he repeats hesitantly. The thought, that he himself might not want to be seen either, occurs with delay. The thought, that such an act would be in vain because he has already been seen, follows even later. Harry's headache intensifies. He wishes he could floo Hermione. She’d know what to do, how to proceed. For a short moment he looks out for a fireplace and actually sees one across the room, but settles with sliding down the wall to the bathroom, and waiting for Drew to come out. Seeking the talks seems to be inevitable anyway, if Harry at least wants to try and repair what damage can still be repaired.
"I understand. I'll see you later then," Harry laughs, getting up to throw another pinch of floopowder into the fireplace and disappearing into the fire for work.
“You okay?”, Drew asks since despite the fact that he is still standing in the kitchenette at the other end of the room, Harry's unusual capture by his wand can be openly observed.
"Mhm. It's okay. I'll finish getting dressed, and then I'll be on my way." Harry strokes through his hair, which unlike Drew's is sticking wildly off his head, unkempt, fresh out of bed. The desire for his own four walls, his bathroom, intensifies.
“You’re a true devoted friend”, she snickers. After a last short hug, she takes for the fireplace. “Please consider my words, yeah?”, she says at last.
“Why would he come to your place?”, he asks, though he already assumes to know the answer
Soon after, Drew comes back from the kitchen area with a steaming cup of coffee and a small flask and sits down at the other end of the couch Harry sits on. The sight of the latter remembers Harry of his own flask deep down in the pocket of his jeans, filled with the polyjuice potion he wishes he had taken before falling asleep. He receives both liquids, downing the potion then nipping at the other. The pain relief sets in straight away. At least something.
Harry blushes by that innuendo. “Right”, he clears his throat, slides his hands down his trousers in gaucherie, brushing past his back pockets, and is stunned to feel the subtle bulge of a wooden stick there. He halts, nestles at the object, and with incredulity brings his own wand in his field of vision. “What?”, he whispers.
“Oh Merlin, Harry! You didn’t, you wanker”, she giggles, which he acknowledges with an disapproving eye.
For a short moment they lock eyes, leaving Harry to wonder, if Harry was his type. He's not convinced though. First, he needs to be gay. Unlikely enough. And second, they actually look quite alike, and that usually never comes in handy. For a moment Harry damns himself for today’s choice of DNA. What good does it gain him, when the face in the mirror is close to his target group but scares off this exact group.
Harry blinks, slightly tilting his head, question mark virtually written on his face. He definitely senses the mood of being hit on, though
"As I see it, there are two possible outcomes. If today’s experience meets your expectations, it might encourage you to proceed in manifesting a betting habit. Which I don’t want to be the cause of. Whereas when I provide you with lousy experiences today, you might never want to try it with me or anybody again."
"Drew?" Harry reaches his hand out to open the ajar door.
“YOU! What are you doing here?”, Hermoine yelps with disdain.
Drew stalks towards the kitchenette and bows. “These?”
Until a small figure clanks against the dining room window.
He briefly considers whether this was unwise, but by then Siora is already flying away.
Harry faced Draco and kissed him softly. “I missed you too, Dray. How did your visit go with your mother and Severus?”
Harry smiled at her. “Of course, Narcissa. Dray’s happiness is the most important thing to me as well. It’s just that last night we got even closer than we had been. It means a great deal to me that you trust me with your son. I have never felt this way before. I don’t want to mess it up. It would kill me to ever hurt Dray. He means the world to me.” He blushed.
Harry smiled back at her. "Of course, I am happy to help in whatever way you need as long as Draco agrees and feels comfortable with staying with me. I want what's best for him just as you and Snape do."
Harry blushed a bit while Ron and Hermione stayed by his side. “Uhh, I’m looking to buy an engagement ring.”
Narcissa nodded and smiled. "Thank you Harry. We appreciate your help. I will go fetch Draco. I will return shortly." She walked up the stairs leaving Harry and Severus alone.
Draco nodded. “I want to see all of you too, love.”
Ron scanned the room. “Bloody hell I’m surrounded by snakes! What gives Harry? I stop coming around and you replace me with Draco’s lot? Being friends with these snakes is betraying me and my family! Why the bloody fuck are they here?”
Harry cast a spell so Lucius was not able to talk. “Mister Malfoy, that is enough beastly behaviour from you! You will not speak to your son in such a dreadful way. There was a reason I spoke so ill of you at your trial and I do not regret what I did for your family. I knew that if Draco and Narcissa did not have you around, they would thrive because they are actually good people without being controlled by a lunatic follower of Voldemort. After Draco did not identify me at the manor and Narcissa lied for me to Voldemort in the forest, I believed in them and I thought they deserved to live their lives free of your influence. I reconciled with your son and we became close and now we are dating. Narcissa has been supportive and just wants Draco to be happy. And if you do not want to lose your son completely I suggest you think about how you feel about his happiness. He has been through enough, don’t you think? Does he not deserve to be happy and free?” He released the spell and gave Lucius a sneer. Lucius recoiled a bit.
"Okay," Harry murmurs and shrugs his shoulders. He settles down on the sofa closest to him and the comforting sinking into the soft leather paired with the still breath-taking view over London throws him back in time. Panic spreads, and it takes some effort to consciously suppress it. It helps to remind himself that he is here voluntarily, wearing his own clothes, freshly showered and unhungover. And that not a single reporter has shown up at his place since his last visit. So why should it happen now? Then again, this could be a belated set-up.
"Have you tried? I mean, to get into the team? After Malfoy threw in the towel, there really wasn't anything left at your house. I mean, I know you weren’t at Hogwarts anymore at that time, but a few more fair-playing members wouldn’t have been too bad." he laughs, yet notices Drew grimacing at his words. Perhaps Harry himself has let his not-very-affection towards Slytherins back in school shine through a little too much.
"Huh?", Harry as oblivious as ever.
“If I always look like I’m freshly shagged, I might as well actually be.” Harry observes mildly alerted that he’s returned to sheer bluntness about expressing his sexual attraction towards the man next to him.
Drew has exchanged his suit trousers for dark blue chinos, which in Harry's eyes is only a minimal downgrade towards a casual look. On the other hand, considering his first impressions of Drew, he didn't expect much else, which is why he himself has dressed up much more deliberately and formal than he would usually do for a meet up (he’s still resistant to call it a date).
He watches Drew's face intensively, looking for signs of resonance, a hint, if he feels the same need when the sudden realisation of it still being daylight hits him. It feels like ages since he’s last made out on an occasion, that hadn’t originated during the late hours in some club. In his own body.
Harry nods absently. He never had had issues with simple charms like Accio. Especially when the object in question was in such close proximity. Has his wand been just too close?
“Staircase”, Drew answers, as if it was obvious.
"True, true. I think we’re on the same page then. Makes things easier."
"At least not when you thread it like you did this morning," Ron adds.
Soon their somewhat artificial small talk turns to more profound chatter about various topics. Harry learns that Drew went to Hogwarts, too, two years below him, making him 22 now, and was sorted into Slytherin. As an only child of a pureblood family (who would have thought), as Drew told with slight disdain in his voice, his parents moved to France as soon as the return of Voldemort was no longer deniable after the fight at the ministry. He didn’t come back to complete his education in England though, ans stayed at Beauxbatons, even after the war was over, but returned to England for 4 ago to start working at the financial department at the Ministry. Harry also learns that Drew’s favourite colour is green, and that he has been playing the piano for 15 years, and that he knows not even half of Harry’s favourite music groups and artist, be they wizarding or muggle, despite his musical background. This lack of vital knowledge however rather itches Harry to immediately apparate them to his flat and show Drew his excessive CD and Vinyl collection instead of diminishing his picture of him. That might be also due to the fact that all while talking, Drew emanates the aura of someone who feels comfortable in their skin, infecting Harry to do so, too. Something Harry yearns for.
Harry does as he's told, somewhat jerkily, under the under the misjudged slight resistance, and an unexpected amount of light floods towards him through the small gap. A little unsettled but driven mainly by curiosity, he pushes the flap completely open and scrambles up the last steps. Almost blind, he stops at the end of the stairs, his hand still resting on the banister until his eyes have adjusted to the intense light.
“Up we go”, said mate murmurs, lifting Harry up again. Now that he’s pantsless the friction of his own prick against the soft fabric of Drew’s still clothed crotch allows to feel up the other’s hardened length. Combined with those hands shamelessly groping his ass, finger tips suspiciously close to the crease, Harry forgets the interruption in their flow of sexual actions again. Riled up, he ruts the other man’s torso, not taking note to where he’s carried to. He realizes when the grip underneath him weakens, and he’s half-thrown on a mattress, though.
Harry nods in agreement, thoughtful. Drew's fixed interest in his persona still casts incomprehension for him.
“Then I better try and make it a pleasing experience, huh?
"Can't complain," she smiles with composure, straightening her back for emphasis.
“Thanks for hearing me out, really”, he tries another way.
"All right! I'm doing something about it!" he shouts exasperatedly into the otherwise empty room, and energetically gets up from the sofa to sit down at his secretary, where he immediately remains broodingly in a stupor of thought.
Just as he gets up to move his whereabouts to the living room, he sees a large, unfamiliar barn owl sitting on the window sill. Immediately he suspects a bad incident at Ron and Hermione's. She is expecting her first baby and is six months pregnant. Should she have come to the hospital because of some complication and someone from the staff sent Harry an owl to notify him? Quickly he lets the animal in, and takes from it the little message attached to its foot.
"So, you likey?"
“Then I guess you'll have no other option but to try and make it so memorable, I just can’t get enough of you." The level of propositioning is in no relation to their degree of acquaintance, Harry knows yet ignores for the sake of flirting.
"What's up, Harry? It's not every day you invite us to dinner on an ordinary Tuesday night," she doesn't beat around the bush as she takes a seat at his dining table. "Do you have tea?"
"Yeah, it was." Harry, too, can now no longer hide a grin. “I mean, definitely awkward, but I think I might actually try and date him.”
Harry shakes his head, and Cas looks both relieved and disappointed. "Hi... Harry then", hesitating, "This feels so wrong", she adds laughing.
Relieved, he exhales. "So. You have an owl?" he asks with a nodding chin towards the empty cage.
Sure, when he realized he was more or less homosexual, he was all excited about exploring and gaining new experiences rather than jumping straight into a relationship. His new work at Nimbus Racing Broom Company. claimed almost all of his leisure at that time, only amplifying his lack of commit. And after all, both had been reasons he and Ginny didn't work out and though they remained as friends, it was a breakup he had to overcome, nonetheless.
Then he waits on the sofa, keeping a steady eye on the fireplace. It can only be a matter of minutes before Cas stumbles through the opening, considering how quickly her reply to his first letter had followed.
“I just don’t want to. It got nothing to do with that.”
“You’re an oddball”, Drew frowns smiling.
“Sorry”, Drew breaks away and laughs abashed. “I shouldn’t have. This was non-consensual.” He steps back, face marked by remorse, biting his lower lip.
"Hey! I...", Harry's voice goes quiet. "I think the problem is rather, that I've seen too many times that people aren't who they pretend to be. And everyone is potentially a fraud to me."
“His name is Peagreen”, he tells the others.
“Unsurprisingly surprised. Unexpectedly approving. Well, it was mostly me acting and reacting and him just being there, trying to not frighten me off. Yeah, it kind of felt like that.” Now that he puts it into spoken words, Drew's reaction seems far less confusing and ambiguous. In fact, for the most part he had been courteous and understanding. Enough to make up for the one or two too many inappropriate suggestive jokes
In shame, Harry stops abruptly in the street and buries his face in his hands, earning him some disapproving glances from passers-by. His desolate mental and also physical state does not fit in very well with the hustle and bustle of the London streets on a sunny Saturday noon, Harry has to admit to himself. With an exasperated sigh, he determines that apparating home is currently the quickest and most effective way to escape the city's commotion. As soon as he has found a suitable out-of-sight spot, he thinks no longer and with a crack he is gone.
“Soooooo?“, she asks invitingly, her gaze expectant. Harry settles down beside her, hands her one of the steaming mugs and takes a deep breath.
Harry's face lights up. "Great, then I'll expect you guys at seven. Is take-away food okay?"
“No, really. I don’t stay nights. I just can’t”, Harry eventually defies and sits up.
"Shit", he mumbles in deep regret of those last two or three drinks.
“Generous”, Blondie further quips, "So, my performance today determines the further course of this elucidating scientific project?”
At home he realises, that they departed without defining what purpose the meeting had served. In the end they had not been making out at all, and to his surprise he’s very much at peace with this state of affairs. What hasn’t been yet, may yet come. And if they end up just talking on their next date, it might be just fine, too. Wasn’t that supposed to be the natural course of events anyway. Though technically, it was already too late to approach things in the proper order.
“This is actually Drew’s owl”, Harry reveals, facing Hermione with an odd look.
"That… disguise", she vaguely gestures her hand to indicate his whole body. "I mean, it's somewhat of an upgrade, but not as if you needed one."
“Thanks for your offer. I appreciate it. I’ll think about it. But don’t get your hopes up”, Harry’s back to seriousness as fast as he slipped. He stands up, ready to leave.
“My eyes are up here”, his absent attention is called on.
Tell me in the comments, I'd you think something is off
The idea is dumb enough for Harry to actually consider it. A tipsy brain appreciates risky and potentially profitable provocation.
"Just kidding, Harry. I'm really happy for you. Was it good then?", Ron shares a warm grin.
“Bathroom”, he utters, then runs towards the kitchenette instead, where he expects a sink to be for sure, as he’s not certain if he can bear the time loss to look out for his initially announced destination.
"I know, I know. And I understand but I also don't want to see you scourge yourself." Falk’s face has a sympathetic concerned expression, that fades into a delighted smile seconds after. "Hey, isn't that Cassiopeia?" Harry turns to the indicated direction and brightens up himself. Just like Falk he knows Cas through their Company's Quidditch-Team and even though they all work in different departments - Falk in service, Cas in financial - they often spend lunch together and sometimes meet up at bars. Harry likes her carefree, lively manner which is accentuated by her open friendly face but stands in contrast to her long black hair and fierce, dark eyes and also her Slytherin background – as some would presumably say. They wave at her, and she immediately comes over with a somewhat puzzled smile.
"Okay, okay." Defeated and with the shooing of Falk and Cas he stumbles his way through the crowd towards the other end of the dance floor where some scrutinizing, bright blue eyes await him.
. Then
"You say it as a joke, but there might be something to it. Knowing something is definitely wrong can give one a false sense of security," Hermione muses.
thank you for everyone who came back to this story... (and to the new one's too)
“Truer words were never spoken… If you please, refer to me as Drew.” Inside, Harry sighs disappointed. He had hoped to get Drew's real name now, but doesn’t bother enough to mention it explicitly.
"Thanks for the concern”, Drew laughs. “As you can see, I'm perfectly fine. The near coma only hit me when your tiny owl was knocking like crazy on my window here," his eyes wander to the window front. "Thought a bird had accidentally hit the glass at first, despite my protective spells."
Actually it is only their height, weight and Caucasian heritage whereon they match. Which are the most relevant parts to Harry to feel content and congruent when, well, taking sexual actions in a body that isn't really his. Also its convenient wardrobe-wise. It is a tragedy he can't determine the size of the prick when going for DNA hunting but that's how it is. As he runs a hand through his current hair he misses his own dishevelled curls.
„Well, as you probably witnessed, he – uh, Drew is his name - took me home to his place last night. Apparently, he owns slash rents a loft in Soho, quite the posh guy if you ask me.”
He can sense something of heavy weight dropping next to him on the mattress, a hand cupping his jaw, a face nuzzling in the curve of his neck. Soft kisses. Tickling hair. Coziness.
“Excuse me please for a moment “, Drew says and heaves himself up, and before Harry can even contemplate the change of events completely, he has gone to the toilet.
“Will do”, he murmurs and carefully puts them on, surprised by the pleasant feeling of it on his skin. Maybe he should consider putting more money into his wardrobe.
“It’s fine. You are more than welcome to stay the night. I can make us coffee tomorrow.” Luring words paired with light finger strokes along the length of Harry’s body. Oh, it’s so hard to resist. But he must, he knows. It’s deeply rooted inside his brain, though he can’t muster out why to be honest.
“Sadly not. I only know of ways to mess it up even more”, he gives Harry an auspicious look. “Which might not be in your best interest.”
After quite a few failed attempts, which manifest as small crumpled balls of paper scattered all over his living room, intense head scratching and repeated hisses of expletives, he exhales loudly. "Okay, that'll have to do."
As they happily fell asleep in each other’s arms, Draco and Harry were smiling softly musing over their romantic heart-to-heart.
He gave Draco a short kiss before leaving the room.
Draco had a single tear leave a trail down his cheek and Harry wiped it away. "Yes, Harry I would love to be your boyfriend. Every moment with you is a dream come true. I could not think of a better person to share my time with."
Draco gave Harry pleading look. “Please touch me, Harry.” He bit his lip.
Draco propped himself up a bit and looked at Harry. “What is it?” He said shyly.
Draco was about to respond but Harry interrupted. "Draco I've told you I don't care about how the press or anyone thinks of me. I can be friends with anyone. I'm the one who saved all their sorry arses from death or slavery. They should just sod off with their opinions. I could care less what they think of me. Please Draco believe me and trust me. I don't want to hide our friendship from anyone. It'll be worse if we conceal our alliance. I know I could speak with Luna and she could write an article about our new found friendship. She'd love to help us. And I think you should just leave through the front door. Hermione and I will make sure you're safe and are able to apparate to the Manor. Draco, do you trust me?" He smiled encouragingly.
No sooner did he say his name that Snape's portrait spoke up. "What a pleasant surprise to see you Draco. How is your mother?"
The two couples followed Kreacher up to their bedrooms leaving Draco and Harry alone.
Still sitting in silence, both observed one another. "So Harry, what would you like to talk about? Interests? Relationships?" Draco inquired.
Severus looked at Hermione fondly. "When you say it that manner where Draco needs my support, I feel my insecurity of being resurrected seems unfounded. No matter what I will always do my very best with Draco. As for Harry planning a trip to Azkaban, I think he will be fine. He is a very capable wizard despite all my snipes at his magical abilities. Plus Draco will be by his side. There is absolutely nothing to worry about." He tried to give her a reassuring smile.
As Harry returned to the kitchen, Hermione gave him knowing look. "Uhh, Draco I don't know how to say this but it seems that the press are camped out waiting for you to emerge from my home. I'm really sorry. You could use the floo to get back to Manor." He smiled reassuringly at Draco.
Harry blushed. “Uh, um, well she gave me her blessing to marry you pretty much and we talked about who would take what name. Saying that she can see you becoming a Potter one day. She also told me that she already thinks of me as her son and she looks forward to me becoming her son-in-law. We joked about how the Prophet would have a field day if I changed my name to Malfoy. And all the hate mail I’d get. I said that I couldn’t believe how I now had two motherly figures in my life.” He smiled softly.
Draco watched his mother leave and suddenly realised he would be alone with Potter. That thought just made his face heat up once again.
Harry and Draco continued to eat and chat about their day. When they were finished, Kreacher cleared the table and brought dessert out.
Narcissa called to him "Breakfast is ready, darling! Winky is getting impatient. She is going to come get you if you take much longer."
Harry shyly smiled. “Dray, I just wanted to do something nice.”
Harry chuckled. "And you're quite the mood killer, Malfoy! Though I do agree, we've been nattering on about our feelings for quite awhile. By the way, the Sorting Hat almost placed me in Slytherin but negotiated myself into Gryffindor. I know the shock, the Saviour of the Wizarding World almost ended up in Slytherin. The press would have had a field day with the information. And imagine if that actually happened. Everyone would think I was the next Dark Lord to rise. Though, after fellow students hearing me speak in Parseltongue, it started the rumour that I was the next powerful dark wizard. One of the worst moments in my Hogwarts days. Everyone was being so ridiculous. Such abhorrent behaviour in my opinion."
He walked over to Dumbledore's old desk. Minnie spoke. "After your arrival today, this arrived. It is a letter from Albus. It is addressed to you, Draco." She handed him the letter. He wasn't sure what to make of Dumbledore writing to him.
Harry blushed again and smiled widely. “Thank you. I appreciate it. Take care.”
Narcissa chuckled and smiled. “Oh Harry you are too precious. I am certainly not naive and I do know you will never hurt Draco, at least not intentionally. I believe you two will get married some day and I will get to call you my son-in-law in the near future. My Draco will one day be a Potter, of that I am certain. Honestly, I already think of you as my son. You are quite dear to me and you have my unending and unwavering support.” She gave him a watery smile.
The salesperson smiled. “The one you selected is the most expensive and the price is thirty thousand galleons but it also includes two matching wedding bands with a similar theme to the engagement rings.”
Molly interrupted with an announcement that tea was ready and everyone bustled into the cramped sitting area. At first, it was in silence but then everyone relaxed and started talking about a variety of subjects.
Minnie smirked. "Harry is quite right. Hermione was quite the stickler when it came to pronunciation and would not let you hear the end of it if you were to say something wrong."
Sirius laughed. “Bloody hell! I have missed watching you bicker in real life! Never a dull moment with you two!” He was shaking with laughter.
Pansy still looked like she was in a state of shock. “I, um, feel I need to apologise to you, Potter. I am genuinely sorry. I did not realise the extent of your relationship. I thought it was just a phase or some flight of fancy. Please accept my apology. All that truly matters is Draco’s happiness like Blaise stated.” She gave Harry a small smile and extended her hand. “Friends?”
What seemed like seconds later, Hermione emerged from the floo and dusted herself off. "Harry, what did you get yourself into this time? I swear I feel like I am always saving the day." She gave Harry a pointed look and acknowledged her surroundings. "Oh forgive my manners. Hello Minnie and hello Draco. It is very nice to see you both again." She smiled at them.
Severus nodded. “I do. The moment I laid eyes on you upon my return, I felt a strong pull towards you. It was like nothing I ever felt before. It was like we were connected in some way, that we were meant for each other.”
Severus pulled back and stepped closer to the floo once again. He was about to leave when she stopped him. He looked at her.
Again, Harry rolled his eyes and looked out the window. "Of course have you laugh at my expense. Whenever I do buy a snake I'll be sure to give you lessons. But of course the high and mighty Malfoy needs to practice properly."
Ron smiled at him. “Sure, mate! I may not like the ferret but I do trust your judgement. Are you sure Hermione will be okay with me tagging along?”
They made their way up the staircases to the Headmistress' office and Minnie reached the door and recited the password. "Sherbet lemons." A spiral staircase was revealed. Minnie started up the stairs. "Come, boys." Harry and Draco followed her up the spiral staircase. At the top, they saw the previous Headmasters portraits lining the walls.
Harry looked up and smiled. “Productive. I had tea with Hermione and Ron.”
Draco felt bad about how he reacted to such a nice gesture on Potter's part. He sheepishly looked at him. "Harry, I am sorry. I am just not used to nice gestures from people aside from my mother. I apologise for my abhorrent behaviour. I would like to start over with you as well." He tried to smile at Potter.
"Sure, darling. I will have Winky get you when he has arrived." Narcissa thought about what could possibly be haunting her son. Though she knew he liked Mr. Potter more than he liked to admit to himself or anyone for that matter.
Hermione smiled widely. "At first, I was not sure what to think but after you prattled on about Draco and your afternoon at Malfoy Manor I started to realise that you were really serious about moving on from the past and that you truly cared for Draco and Narcissa. So that is when I completely supported your decision regarding a friendship with the Malfoys. Also, I saw how you said Draco's name and I just knew you liked him more than a friend. And I have never seen you so animated talking about someone until Draco. So I will always support your happiness, Harry. Always."
Harry came back down and once again sat next to Draco. “Dray, want to cuddle a bit before dinner is ready?”
Hermione smirked and chuckled. “I think I was clear about my feelings. Well, at least, my actions should have been quite obvious but clearly they were not. I have held your hand, hugged you, bantered with you and kissed your cheek. I would have actually kissed you, I mean really kissed you, but I was not sure about how you would react. I did not want to humiliate myself so I just decided to give you a kiss on the cheek.” She was blushing ferociously.
Sitting in the box was Draco's wand that Potter stole during his ill fated visit to the Manor. "Potter, you really did not have to return my wand. Besides, its allegiance is to you now. I am sure you did not think about that little important fact."
Ginny and Luna both came forward and unexpectedly hugged Draco. Everyone was gawking at them. Luna spoke first as they pulled back. “Draco, you don’t have any wrackspurts buzzing about your head. I’m sure it’s due to Harry. I knew you two would end up being close.” She gave him a dreamy smile. Draco looked a bit bewildered.
Narcissa smiled softly. “Harry darling, loving and protecting my Draco is more than enough. It truly is.”
Harry gave him a contented sigh. “Good night, love.” He murmured as pulled Draco impossibly closer to him.
Draco bit his lip and blushed. "Let us go then." They held onto each other's hands and apparated outside the gate of Malfoy Manor.
Sirius put his arm around Remus. “I certainly would not mind getting to know Draco and reconnecting with Narcissa without Lucius’ influence.” He smiled at Narcissa and Draco. “For Harry’s sake, I think we should all try to get along. There has been enough pain and heartache. We all need to get over ourselves.” Everyone looked surprised at what he said.
Harry eventually pulled away. “Dray, there’s something I’d like to tell you. Don’t worry it’s nothing bad but it’s definitely important. Will you please look at me, love?”
Severus observed his witch. “Hermione, how are you feeling after what Weasley said? I never got a chance to ask and I apologise for that.” He gave a reassuring smile.
Narcissa opened the door. “Severus, a letter arrived for you from Hermione.” She gave him a knowing smile. He rolled his eyes at her which made her chuckle. “I will leave you to it.” She smirked as she left the laboratory.
Potter's face soured a bit. "Mrs. Malfoy, it's slow going but it will be ready for the fall session. At least that's what Headmistress McGonagall has been saying so far. She's impressed by the progress everyone has been making. Actually, you and Draco should come by and see what we've been doing."
Harry looked at him and shook his head. "Don't get your knickers in twist, Malfoy! You're that tongue tied about what you wanted to say to me? Colour me flattered! Honestly, I was telling Hermione about our time together. I couldn't help myself to share because I really enjoyed myself. Of course, Ron got huffy and left but Hermione couldn't have been more supportive and hopes that you two will bond over potions and become friends. And I really hope you two become close because you're literally my two favourite people in the world right now. I can't believe I got so incredibly lucky."
Draco looked at Harry curiously. “Potter, something is going on. My favourite meal and now my favourite dessert? I demand to know the meaning of this is.” He was frustrated and curious.
For a few moments nothing happened. All of the sudden, the air swirled around the figurine. The doe looked like it was dissolving and the particles were churning in the air. Minnie, Hermione, Draco and Harry all stared in wonder as the particles started to form into something solid with black fringes. The shape of a human being materialised but there were no distinguishing features. The particles seemed to be vibrating until they shattered into a million pieces and vanished into thin air only leaving just the bat like Professor Severus Snape. Everyone gasped in shock.
Harry smiled warmly at Hermione. "Thank you. You're a true friend. I'm sure Draco would be delighted to hear that you want to be friends with him. Draco said he'd owl me when he was able to get together."
Narcissa took a few bites of breakfast. "My darling, are you looking forward to seeing Mr. Potter?" She smirked exactly like she did last night.
Hermione spoke up. “I think this is a great deal. Could we see the wedding bands?”
Harry blushed a bit. "Dray, I'm really happy to know that you didn't have any more nightmares. And I feel just as lucky as you feel, having you by my side." He moved even closer and softly kissed Draco.
Hermione chuckled a bit. She takes his hands in hers. "Harry I really am happy for you. I hope Draco gives me a chance to be friends with him. And I have always wanted to talk potions with him. He is bloody brilliant at them! Have you decided when you will see each other again?"
"I most certainly did. I am glad he contacted me. And why are you smiling like that? You are making me nervous." Draco said.
Sirius finally looked around and visibly relaxed. “Does this mean Voldemort is gone for good? Bloody hell! I never thought I would see that day!” He smiled and chuckled. “Where is Lucius? I would love to punch him again.”
Draco snuggled into Harry and kissed his neck softly. “Harry love, I think I need some rest after that. Care to join me?” He smiled impishly.
Pansy huffed out a sigh. “I am deeply sorry this afternoon did not go as planned. Though I did enjoy Hermione punching Weasel. Definitely a highlight. I do hope you feel better my darling Draco! I am so incredibly happy for you and Harry.” She hugged them both.
Severus deepened the kiss and held Hermione close. After a few minutes, he pulled away. “Hermione, you are one incredible witch. I do not know what I have done to ever deserve such a treasure. The way you describe me and how you explain why I am a good man and how others see me in a positive light makes me want to believe that I am good. For so long, I was convinced otherwise. It is quite difficult to change the perception of one’s self as you know but I do trust what you are saying is true.” He grimaced. “Wait, you really wish to spend the rest of your life with me?” He looked at her curiously.
Harry looked at Draco with such tenderness. "Then the only thing left to say is, would you do me the honour of being my boyfriend Draco Malfoy?" He said with so much affection.
Severus strolled into the sitting room. “Narcissa, what is with all the commotion?” He looked around and saw the Potters, Sirius and Remus. “Bloody hell! Narcissa, what did you do? Did you take your Gryffindor pill today because you look like you have gone ten rounds with a dementor?! How reckless! This is something I would expect Harry or Weasley to do, not you. What were you thinking? You know how risky blood magic can be. It is bad enough when you bring one person back to life but four? Have you lost your mind?” He sneered at James and Sirius. “And you bring back those two? Do you not recall how they bullied me?” He fumed.
Harry awkwardly stood up and followed Draco out to the terrace and down the stairs to the garden. They walked side by side to the bench in the garden. As they walked, their hands brushed. Both felt shocks which was unknown to the other. They finally got to the bench and sat next to each other in silence.
Draco pulled away a bit. “Harry love, take me to bed.” He said seductively.
Harry gave Hermione a very annoyed look. "Yes I know you are superior to me and Ron when it comes to your magical abilities and logic but that is not why I called you here. Draco and I took your advice on coming to Hogwarts and speaking with Professor Snape and other portraits about my parents and their friends but we got distracted before I had time to think of questions to ask because a letter from Dumbledore appeared on Minnie's desk and it was addressed to Draco." He handed the letter over to Hermione to examine.
Narcissa literally pouted at him. “Oh you are no fun.”
A couple of hours had passed since breakfast. In a flurry of excitement, an owl came flying into the sitting room and left a letter. Narcissa recognised the writing. It was Hermione Granger. She smiled to herself, thinking about thrilled she was for Severus. He deserved to find love and one that would reciprocate his feelings. She left the sitting room to give Severus the letter. As she approached his potions laboratory, she softly knocked and heard a faint “come in” from Severus.
Draco smiled so widely at Harry. "Sometimes you can be such an oblivious idiot you know that?! I keep forgetting that you can be so barmy at times but then you always remind me by something you say. I can not wait until we can show our friends that we are a couple. Imagine Pansy's face when we tell her. That is something we need to film for sure. Blaise, I know, will be ecstatic for us and it seems Hermione will be too. I can not imagine Weasel is going to be pleased considering how he reacted to our friendship. I think I might have had a mini heart attack because I just realised that I also need to inform my father of our relationship at some point and it will have to be in person unfortunately. As you know my mother will be over the moon and sharing it with everyone she knows. And I will have to agree with you that Pansy can be quite terrifying so I do not blame you for being a bit anxious around her."
Hermione smirked. “Sev, breathe. I would not have agreed to living with you if I did not want that. It was a brilliant idea. Me and my books will be very content at Spinner’s End with you. Stop worrying so much. I love you and you love me. That is all that truly matters.”
After Draco found Winky and told her about their guest, she scurried off. He just reminisced the day's events as he found his back to the parlour. He was just happy he had his godfather back. And over the moon happy that he supported his relationship with Harry. His last thought before rejoining his mother and Severus for tea was Harry kissing him in front of everyone. He smiled at the sweet memory.
"Malfoy,
He could see Potter's eyes light up when he actually was polite. Potter's smile got wider. "I'm glad you're okay, Malfoy. I've been doing pretty good considering. Thanks for asking."
Harry watched Draco read the letter. “Dray, I am ready whenever you are to see your father.” He hugged him tightly.
Before anyone could reply, Kreacher returned. “Kreacher cleaned and set up two bedrooms for your guests, Master Harry. Kreacher will show you to your rooms if you would like.”
Hermione gave him a knowing smile like she knew he was holding something back but thankfully she did not say anything.
Narcissa smiled softly at him. “I thought it necessary to visit him. It is quite sweet that you are so concerned for my safety but it is unnecessary since Kingsley accompanied me to Azkaban.”
Draco turned so he was facing Harry. "Yes, Harry? Is there something you…?"
Harry looked at Draco so lovingly. “Dray, I love you beyond words. I can’t wait to call you my husband someday. I can’t think of anyone else who I’d want to spend the rest of my days with.” He kissed Draco’s forehead softly.
Hermione and Harry were stunned into silence it seemed because Snape almost seemed playful and more tolerant of them. And since Harry and Hermione didn't know Snape very well other than being in his classes and he was always so mean. But this Snape seemed lighter and oddly a bit nicer and they didn't know how to proceed or act around this "new" Snape.
Hermione reached out and squeezed Draco's shoulder. "It is going to be okay. I promise we will not let anything to you. You are safe with us." She smiled softly at him.
Draco looked between Harry and Hermione and gave them a nervous smile. "I trust you, Harry. Honestly, I am just nervous and I am not sure how to proceed."
Severus had a hard time forming words. “Only yours, always.” That was all he could say.
Harry looked at both Narcissa and Severus. “I am truly sorry we didn’t tell you about our visit to Azkaban. We weren’t thinking. Narcissa, I’ll let you know what happened. I’m not sure when but I will. And we’ll come over to visit soon, too.” He smiled at them.
Draco glared at his mother. "Mother, I do not know what to do. I know I should write to Harry but every time I start a letter it comes out wrong and then I just can't think of anything to say."
Kreacher popped in. “Yes Master Harry? How can Kreacher assist you?”
Winky scurried and said "Yes Mistress Malfoy. It's my pleasure."
As Pansy and Blaise walked to the floo hand in hand, they waved their goodbyes and vanished.
Harry cuddled even closer to Draco. "Are you awake, Dray?"
Remus smiled fondly at Harry. “Kindness does go a long way even with house elves. That was incredibly thoughtful of you. Hermione must be proud.” He chuckled.
Once they arrived, both Narcissa and Severus greeted them warmly. Narcissa hugged them both and Severus just nodded at them.
Narcissa chuckled softly. “All I need to know? Oh, so you are holding back on me. And what is this “all I need to know” involve, I wonder. Should I continue to poke fun at you until you tell me?” She teased him mercilessly.
Narcissa smiled back. “Be sure to say hello to your witch for me.” She winked and smirked. Again, Severus rolled his eyes at her antics.
Severus huffed. “That is all well and good but she never consulted with me. She should have come to me. I am sure she had a bad reaction to the spell she performed. I could have given her potions to help.” He gave her a worried look. “Not to mention, that Lily is now here. Even if I have moved on, it is still a bit painful to look at her.” He sheepishly looked at Lily. “No offence. I, too, was brought back to life not too long ago and I just recently found something I never thought possible for me. Requited love.”
Draco stared into Harry's eyes like he was hypnotised. "I slept quite peacefully. Laying next to you did the trick. I am so grateful to have you by my side. I am really lucky." He smiled at Harry.
Harry casted a tempus charm and was astonished at how late it had become. "Ohh my you're right. Wow I've been here for hours. But it didn't feel like it at all. Time flies when you're having fun, I suppose. Don't worry about my friends regarding my time with you. When I left the Weasleys, none of them were worried knowing I was coming for afternoon tea. Believe it or not."
Hermione laughed softly. “Oh I almost forgot to mention that I did owl Molly about how Ron behaved. I am waiting for her response.”
Draco rolled off the bed. "Harry, I am going to get dressed. I will see you in the kitchen." He was smiling like a loon.
Severus and Hermione gracefully stepped out of the floo and looked around. Hermione observed the scene. “Harry, what is going on? Is everything alright?”
Draco cuddled closer to Harry after he performed wandless magic to clean them. “Bloody hell, Potter. That was brilliant.” He smirked at Harry.
The one and only Severus Snape was standing before them looking confused and irritated. "What is the meaning of this?" He said in his usual annoyed tone.
Harry nodded and took Draco’s hand leading them up to their bedroom. Once they were settled into bed, they pulled each other close. Harry’s head rested on Draco’s chest. Draco kissed the top of Harry’s head. “Sleep, love.” Not long after laying down and cuddling, both were asleep with Draco holding Harry close. Both looked peaceful.
