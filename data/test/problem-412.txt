Harry accidentally met Malfoy’s smoldering silver eyes and felt a wave of nausea pass over him. This was actually happening. His only consolation was that Malfoy looked like he was about to swallow a beehive, so at least Harry wasn’t the only one suffering. Suppressing the urge to turn tail and run away from Malfoy, and the Wizarding World he was surely here to represent, Harry took a deep breath and went to face his former nemesis.
Reluctantly, he released Draco and grasped for the Floo powder on the mantle. “See you there,” Harry said, still facing the fireplace. After a quick call of “the Burrow!” he was gone.
“Coffee, Harry?” Ron asked loudly as Hermione snatched the joint out of his hand. Wisely, Ron decided to give it up as a lost cause.
Harry obliged on both counts, thrusting slightly harder and increasing his pace. He also took the opportunity to mark the side of Draco’s neck with lovebites, nipping rapidly as Draco pleaded for him.
Draco could hear him slamming doors, checking all of his favorite haunts; the kitchen was usually where he waited Harry to get home from his summer class – after three long hours of what Harry referred to as “mind-numbing torture,” he was always thrilled to have Draco and a hot dinner waiting for him.
Apparently a routine chase-down-a-Death-Eater was considered one of these dire situations. Harry felt the magic from the band pulling at him and fought against it as hard as he could, while still pounding after Avery. His efforts were futile; the powerful magic eventually cut off Harry’s resistance and Apparated him back down the block.
They quietly watched the morning pass by until the hunger in their bellies drove them away from the abandoned parking lot.
“So you have moved past all of that blood purity nonsense?” he ventures courageously, looking Malfoy dead in the eyes.
“Oh, right,” said Hermione nervously. She went to uncork the bottle with a trembling hand, but Draco stepped in.
“Actually, I might need the rest of the day. At least.” The owl gave him an inscrutable expression that was uncannily similar to Draco’s, but it consented to fly back over to the perch and hoot for more treats.
“I know that it makes you uncomfortable, mate,” says Ron sympathetically, “But it might be better if you told me and Hermione what happened to you. We almost got there, you know, earlier this week.”
Malfoy nodded again, and Harry felt that was his cue to leave. “Alright, well, goodnight,” he said awkwardly, turning back towards the castle.
A hand clapped down on his shoulder, causing Draco to jump in alarm. He spun around only to be met by Potter’s smiling eyes and ruffled hair.
They stood there panting, bodies very close together. Harry briefly looked up – Malfoy was just an inch or so taller – and met Malfoy’s silver eyes, expecting to see anger and hatred there. Instead, he saw fear, determination, and something else that wasn’t so easy to name. Harry swallowed, knowing what he had to do.
He continued Transfiguring some weird toys (Potter called them “Lincoln Logs”) into desks, taking special care to curve the lumbar support specifically to the curvature of his back. Some comfort would sure be nice for a change; Draco took particular pleasure in vanishing the remains of the horrible stools in the Potions classroom that Snape refused to let anyone touch.
“No, Gin, don’t bring that up,” Harry groaned. “It’s nearly the holiday; I haven’t even started properly thinking about them yet.”
After a short nap, Draco wakes up and nudges Harry. “That was amazing, Harry, but I think I’d like to go to bed clean.”
The entire dirt field broke out into laughter, and the grumpy batter pointed his bat at Nate again. “Just you wait,
He treated himself to a rare early morning croissant and coffee because, after all, dead men needed no gold.
He attempted to flubber out a response, but Granger hoisted up her bag and stormed out of the Hall. For a moment, Draco wished he could follow her so he could get away from all the side-eye glances they were receiving and all the muffled whispers.
Draco gave him a horrified look. “Gods, no. I’m in the Debate Club, where I can destroy idiots with my sarcastic, godly wit and people actually
Jake’s hand unexpectedly came down and slapped Draco just under his left hipbone, very close to his ass. It was enough – Draco groaned as orgasm overtook him. He arched up against Jake’s cock, and that was encouragement enough for Jake to slap him again. For one blissful moment, Draco forgot who he was with as hot come spilled out into his pants and powerful hormones overrode his senses. He was so, so relaxed and peaceful, despite the uncomfortable conversation that was sure to follow with Jake.
Surprised, Ron and Hermione shared a look of unease, turning around to regard Harry with what he thought of as their intervention faces.
Suddenly, firm hands pushed him back on his bum. “Breathe, Draco,” a voice instructed. “Slowly. In…two… three… four… out… two… three… four. Come on, you’re not even trying.”
“Understood, but you have to do what’s best for Potter and not what’s best for you, Malfoy rationalizes. “Acknowledge his pain, but don’t pretend like there’s some kind of quick fix or solution because he has to work through it himself.”
Resignation dawned in Malfoy’s eyes, and for one quick second, Harry saw Malfoy’s disappointment and sadness shine through his mask. He could only imagine the thoughts going through Malfoy’s head right now after a lifetime of being rejected for what he wasn’t able to do.
“Really?” Harry threw his napkin off his lap and onto the table, ready to leap at Ron like he had done so many months ago at Hogwarts.
“It is not.” Draco opted for cool detachment as he stared straight ahead, because even with his feelings as they were, he and Potter were not friends.
Ron disguised his snigger with a muffled cough. “You’re sure you’re alright, mate? I think you’re going to need more than a good cup of coffee to function today.”
Apparently he wasn’t. Nate blushed, quickly hiding his face behind his folder. “Um, I’d better be off as well,” he hemmed, “I found out the hard way it’s not best to leave my poor dogs at home for so long.”
Malfoy gave him an ugly glare, and Harry relented. It was really only fair, since he’d shared his real reason with Harry.
Finally, after yet another file had come through about Parkinson’s current misdeed and was waiting to be processed. Harry lost it. He threw down the folder with a
Mind made up, Draco saw some bushes behind the smallest library he’d ever seen in his entire life and made a beeline for them. Taking care to make sure he wasn’t spotted, Draco again focused on New York, turning on his heel and giving himself over to his magic.
Draco held on just as tightly. “Agreed,” he whispered. “I wish we’d done this sooner.” After a moment, he rolled onto his side, spooning into Harry’s chest, and then Harry felt Draco’s warm come running down his hole and down the back of his thighs.
Potter was in his element when he was working on the restoration, which made him all the more attractive and tantalizing to Draco. He appreciated a confident man, and while Potter did not swagger around in everyday life, with a clear objective at hand he took on the stance of a natural leader. Under his forceful presence and fierce approval of Draco, conditions had improved at Hogwarts. Though Draco did not like being separated from Potter, there were times when Potter would pair him up with the students who were more tolerant and forgiving. After a series of genuine apologies, Draco found himself with a particularly strong acquaintance—he wasn’t quite comfortable enough to use the word
“I just want you to know that I’ll be fair to you,” Potter said, still completely genuine. “I mean it, Malfoy – all that stuff from before the War, it doesn’t matter now.”
Draco waited, but Jake was apparently waiting for some sort of reply from him. He removed his hand from the door opener, silently accepting that he was not getting out of this, and turned his body towards Jake in the driver’s seat. “Mhm?” he prodded.
A few minutes later, Potter’s fingers started ghosting over his muscles, and Draco realized that yes, Potter was touching him,
“Malfoy, do you think we can ask Tipsy for some of those biscuits to eat on the way?” Potter suddenly appeared in the living room, dressed but still toweling off his hair.
“Shh!” Draco hisses at him, limping quietly toward the door. On second thought, he reaches back up to his bed and grabs the offending sleeping bag, dragging it out the door and hurling it over the railing. He ends up sitting down on the steps to the cabin, pushing on his temples before dragging his fingers through his already-mussed hair. Malfoys were simply
“Of course not,” Harry replied, eyes traveling across the page so fast he vaguely resembled Granger during finals week. “It’s all a deterrent, putting the list the bloody hell up here, writing in minuscule handwriting—for some reason, McGonagall doesn’t want anyone studying this list extensively.”
Draco’s heart sank. McGonagall was a sharp woman, and he was sure she’d observed him and Harry snogging a few times over the summer. Even if she hadn’t explicitly seen them together, he and Harry hadn’t made any sort of effort to hide that fact. In fact, it was quite the opposite, as Harry often slung his arm around Draco’s shoulders and Draco would occasionally use Harry’s stomach for a pillow as they laid out on the soft grass during their lunch breaks. Any casual observer could see that they were a couple through the looks they gave, the touches they shared, and the witty banter they exchanged.
He finds he’s still dressed in yesterday’s clothing. Good. That saves him the trouble of tiptoeing around his best friends’ house: Malfoy already had them much too worried about him. He quickly writes a note for Ron and Hermione and sets it on their coffee maker because even before going on a rescue mission, Ron has to have his caffeine. He tests another Levitating Charm and isn’t even dismayed to find out that it still doesn’t work. Doing magic might not be in his best interest right now anyway.
Hermione shook her head, so Draco showed her, specifying how many inches the piece needed to reach in length and width. She learned quickly, so it was only a short time before they were sat there on the sofa together, hooks working quickly in their yarn. When Draco reached nineteen inches in length, he turned the work and started joining the two ends together with single crochet so the hat resembled a nice, long tube.
“That’s how I keep it from becoming a plebian meal, Potter. You surely wouldn’t expect me to eat it with my hands?”
“Is there even an exit wound?” Harry asked, laughing. Everything seemed so much more amusing after a bit of weed…
Draco pulled his knees into his chest, crossing his arms around his legs and burying his face. “I want to commute,” he grumbled, voice muffled through his shirtsleeves.
“No, sorry,” Harry said. “I’ll just heat some more up.” As he got up to refill the kettle, Draco followed him.
Harry kissed him, thinking that his heart would explode from love. He briefly pulled away, but only long enough to straddle Draco before resuming kissing him again. After a minute, he kissed his way down Draco’s neck and jaw, over his Dark Mark, down his chest—he traced Draco’s scars and whispered more apologies, though he and Draco’d already had this conversation a few months ago—and finally down to his cock. There was something else he wanted to try, so Harry only spent a few minutes teasing him, relying on his knowledge of Draco’s body to turn him on quickly.
Immediately, he could feel his body shutting down and a fog settling in, encasing his mind protectively. All feeling and worries fell away for the first time; leaving Draco’s head clearer than it had ever been in his life. He was only of a lingering need to breathe, nothing else. Eventually, his mind adjusted to the darkness, revealing the nuances of grayscale shades and depths around him. Draco had always wondered if there was really a tunnel. Now, at least, he was imagining one, even if it didn’t really exist. And at the very end, there was indeed a light.
“Exactly,” Draco said, gesturing with his loofah. “Now you can see a different side of the Manor. I grew up here, you know.”
News of the article had traveled fast. Now that Harry was back in the media’s good graces, he quickly became the Golden Boy once more. They’d hardly received any Howlers at all, and Draco wasn’t even jealous, not this time, as Harry received offer after offer (the mountain of post was only just the beginning) for a myriad of different opportunities. The one that stuck with him, though, as Draco predicted right from that fateful moment on the kitchen floor, was the one for a top tier apprenticeship with the American Auror Division.
Malfoy put out his cigarette and vanished it with his wand. He wasn’t looking at Potter. He was afraid that the boy would understand everything by looking in his eyes.
Draco was relieved. God, was he scared that Granger would say something horrible and make him feel worse. He breathed out and muttered a quiet ‘Thanks’ to her.
Malfoy grabbed the boy by the shoulders, slightly pushing him away. He looked Harry right in the eyes, making sure Harry looked into his. He stared at him for a moment, trying to tell him what he thought without speaking.
A month? Harry thought only a week had passed. Maybe he just lost track of time. Doesn’t matter, he really wants this year to end.
Draco sat next to him and hugged him. He knows how important it is to be with Harry right now, holding him, comforting him. He faces Potter and looks him in the eyes, slightly holding him by the shoulders.
- Probably not being nice to people. Look at me now, I have a few friends and I am happy. Well, mostly. - the last sentence Draco whispered to himself.
They heard a knock on the door. Malfoy jumped up and started running his fingers through his hair. He put on his dark grey sneakers and opened the door. He leaned forward to greet Harry but instead he bumped into the boy, slightly touching his nose.
- Oh, no, you can’t trick me. You are always hanging out with him, doing homework and - Ron gulped, - cuddling.
Harry noticed that Malfoy’s hair was different. It wasn’t long and slicked back like the years before. The hair on top was parted in the middle, falling behind his ears and all of the remaining was buzzed off. Harry liked that kind of hairstyle much more than the long one. It suited Malfoy better.
Why is Draco becoming more punk with every chapter? also, I am not a smoker, so the smoking scene is based only on the things I read on the internet ;w;
Ron was alone in his room, though the mess on the floor showed, that he wasn’t the only one living there. There were empty mugs, smelly clothes and… something that was moving?
Draco looked up. The windows were closed and the fire was cracking in the fireplace. ‘There must be something wrong with Potter’ - he thought. Malfoy put one arm under Harry’s shoulder and one on the bed, helping him get up.
- I should let you know that It’s fine with me if you like Harry. Not that you need my permission to date him, I just wanted to say it to you.
Hermione took the piercing gun in her hand and put the needle in. She felt Malfoy tightening up a bit and she stopped to talk to him.
He didn’t care. Some people were coming to him every day, most of them he didn’t even know the names of.
Draco chuckled to himself. Apparently, that song was the last one, so they kind of had to go. Though Malfoy didn’t want the night to end.
Draco didn’t for an answer and stood up taking Harry with him, finding his way into the center of the crowd. Harry was very shy and confused at first but he got used to it, and was enjoying every moment of it.
Harry looked at the notes written in neat handwriting, read them over and put them in the exact same place as they were.
Tears were running down Harry’s face again. Malfoy hugged him, comforting Potter while he cried hysterically. It wasn’t quiet sobbing anymore, it was straightforward crying, which felt so relieving. Tears burning his face, Malfoy’s cold fingers stroking his back.
They entered the club in Hogesmeade. The music wasn’t playing but it was loud and crowded already. People were standing everywhere, holding drinks in their hands, chatting, laughing. Some were dressed in muggle clothes, some were wearing wizard clothes. They were mostly young, though there were some older generations as well. Every fifth person had a tattoo or dyed hair. The only lights were the blue-purple ones, they were creating a very comforting atmosphere.
After leaving Harry Hermione went to Draco’s room. She wasn’t quite sure what she wanted there but something told her to go.
Ron was shocked but he obeyed and ran off to get the blonde as fast as possible. Ron had seen Malfoy a few times in the library, so that was the first place he went to. Luckily, he guessed right, the boy was curled up in an arm chair, reading a book. Ron came up to him, panting and not knowing what to say.
“Your career was a huge part of your fight. I just want to make sure you’re applying for the right reasons, after all. Not because you feel like you have to follow-through because that’s what you told him you wanted to do?”
“Ron,” explains Seamus, recovering first. “I won’t be the one doing the insinuating. Harry will. Trust me.”
“That’s neither here nor there,” Ron sputtered. He had the same expression he used to get back at Hogwarts when Professor McGongall stumped him with a question he couldn’t answer. “Some tart at the pub last week gave me her number, I just haven’t called her yet.”
“I want to tell you right off that it might not bring you the closure you seek, Harry. In fact, it might make it more painful. You’ll have to see them both in court and give intimate facts to the judge and jury. They’ll ask very detailed questions and expect equally detailed answers.”
“And if those are anything like the ones on the cover,” Draco said, carding a hand through his hair. Shaking his head, he picked up the magazine and flipped to the middle, where there was an enormous glossy two page spread of their crossroads shot where they were walking determinably towards one another, drawn together in spite of their surroundings.
He exchanged a look with Ron, one that definitely said they’d get some coffee afterward as long as no one was bleeding.
“Me either,” said Hermione sadly. They sat mournfully for a few minutes before Draco cleared his throat and Transfigured his water into tea for both of them to break up the somber mood.
To say Harry had understood why Draco chose to return back home with his father would be an understatement, so as Draco approached, Harry regarded him with scarcely-contained disdain.
“Good,” Draco whispers back. This time he initiates the kiss with Potter, trying to convey everything that he’s feeling but isn’t yet ready to say. Potter responds eagerly as if using the same strategy.
“What is it, darling?” She sat down across from him. “You mean with Blaise? I’m just as shocked as you are. Do you think you shouldn’t have left?”
I watched you love each other from afar at first, afraid to take the first step, getting to know possibly everything there is to know about one another. What an incredible thing, to be someone’s very best friend and also the love of their life. That’s the real, actual magic in this world.”
“Potter. Harry. I can’t bear another day, let alone holiday, without you,” Draco confesses. “That I’ve let six months go by without telling you that I want to spend every day with you for the rest of my life proves that I’m an unforgivable bastard. But I had to tell you that I’ve made the biggest mistake in my life walking away from what we had. I was dragging my feet, and I was frightened, and I was operating under some sort of delusion that I could protect you. I was trying to be selfless because I know your life is probably much better without me, but we all know that I’m not selfless. Let’s just be honest. And I want you. My pride is out the window at this point, so damn it all. I want you more than anything.”
When he wakes up in the morning, Draco’s things are gone, the living room returned to its usual state. Unsure of what else to do, he pens two letters: one to Minerva McGonagall accepting the position, the other to Head Auror Dolan announcing his resignation. If Draco felt so strongly that he had to leave for Harry to have the life he deserves, he won’t waste another minute.
“Yes. Going on about four years or so now. Our flat’s just west of here.” Draco paused for a beat, appearing to steel himself. “Look, I know we don’t have the best track record but tonight was… passable. If you wanted to, I don’t know, owl me or something, I wouldn’t mind.”
“For us? A wedding? Potter, I’m not… I’m not certain I’d really want something like this, no.” Draco looked flushed and guilty, but his expression was resolute.
“Well, are you going to see him again?” Hermione studied Harry’s face. For his part, he wanted to play his cards close to the vest, unsure of how he was feeling. He still felt a small sting of jealousy when he thought of those intimate moments in Luna’s flat... Or at least they’d felt intimate to him.
with Potter.” Draco glared at his friend across the kitchen island. In response to her raised eyebrow, he slammed down the knife he was using to chop scallions. “Fine. But can we at least agree it was a hatred-based obsession?”
“Let them wonder,” Draco said breathily, pulling Harry into a blistering kiss and swaying on the spot.
. Instead, he chose to say, “I was wrong about you, for a long time. I feel like I’ve never known you at all until now. You’re cheeky and kind of funny, and I sort of hate that we used to hate each other so much.”
“Just a question,” Harry interrupts, smirking. “You know, I really wasn’t making fun of your leather trousers, Malfoy. You should probably wear them more often.”
“Magnus Savio? Oh, well I hope he doesn’t like his job at the Ministry too much,” Draco deadpanned, studying his nails. “Something tells me the DMM is downsizing and he’s first on the chopping block.”
“Hi. You’re here,” Harry said warily, as though this were fragile; as though it could be taken away from him again.
Harry took a step back in disbelief. The last thing he wanted was for Draco to feel sorry for him. He shook his head, reminding himself that Parkinson had no idea what she was talking about; she hadn’t seen the way they were together. Or maybe she had, and knew Harry's very presence had disrupted the relationship. He knew he had to talk to Draco.
“He’s apparently quite the interior decorator as well… It’s a long story,” Harry added at the questioning look from Hermione. “I still kind of can’t believe we’re actual friends. I don’t think we want to hex each other anymore.” Harry couldn’t keep himself from smiling, if not a bit wistfully. He’d decided last night that however confusing his feelings about Malfoy might be, he liked having the other man around. Malfoy made him feel more confident by proxy, like he could stare right back at the throngs of unabashed staring admirers.
Sitting there, alone in the dark on this beach, Draco reached over for Harry’s hand and took it. They sat there in silence for a long while, until Harry shifted a bit so he was leaning against Draco.
thing?” Hermione asked, once again met with the perplexed stares of her counterparts. She put her hands up, mimicking surrender. “Alright, alright. No Malfoys at the wedding.”
. Harry mentally shrugs, and moves even closer. From here, he can see a small smattering of freckles on the bridge of Malfoy’s nose. It also occurs to him that he has probably never been this close before.
“So. We’ve probably got to stop lying to our friends, then,” comes Draco’s hoarse whisper, eyes still closed.
“Please, Potter, when are you ever fun?” Draco sits up a little taller. “It’s obvious that when people think of holiday merriment, they think of yours truly.”
The little brick house on the outskirts of London was only a speck in the swirling snow. Outside, a blanket of calm swept over the street, a deep quiet only snow can bring. Inside, the housemates huddled near the fireplace, sipping hot chocolate and firewhiskey. They watched the flurries dance from a living room bathed in the glow of embers.
Zabini’s eyes widened in surprise as he took in every inch of Harry’s presence in his doorway. “Harry Potter? What in seven hells are you doing showing up on my doorstep like this?” Blaise asked, voice smooth as silk. Despite the intrusion, he looked relatively unruffled.
“What a coincidence, so is mine. Probably for the best though. Could have been embarrassing, showing up in the same thing.” Harry grinned and gestured to his outfit, which left something to be desired in comparison to Malfoy’s tailored appearance. Malfoy smirked in response, and Harry’s stomach did an odd sort of backflip.
“Harry, I love you.” Harry stills; Draco is careful with the distribution of this sentiment. “If you want to be with someone else more than me, someone who can give you what you want, I can only be grateful for the time you’ve already given to me. I am deeply committed to you, but I won’t hold you hostage. You can make up your own mind about sleeping with someone else, and I trust you to make the right decision. I trust you in general.” He crosses the room, puts a soft palm to Harry’s face, and sweeps the wet hair from his forehead.
Hermione looked at him with interest, not saying a word. She didn’t realise how much has Draco changed. It wasn’t only how he looked like but it was like a whole new person was standing in front of her.
- Sorry, Ron was just being a complete moron. Would you like us to watch over Harry or do you want to stay with him?
They were sitting silent for a moment. In the silence a few words escaped from his lips. He didn’t know how it happened, he was thinking of it and somehow he just asked Draco.
They both got butterbeers and sat on the nearest chairs. The boys were smiling, sitting silently. They both felt awkward because they didn’t know what to say to each other. It hasn’t been hard for them to talk before but somehow it was different now. A few times Harry would open his mouth and try to say something but only a shy “umm” would come out.
The solution came to him when he was already taking out his wand for a patronus. Malfoy took Harry’s hand and locked it with his own. The sick boy immediately relaxed and the slight crease between his brows vanished. Draco let out a sigh. ‘Didn’t know it was this easy’ - he thought.
Harry looked at the stars, they were so peaceful. Then, he looked at Malfoy. He didn’t know much about him. He was so mysterious. Harry knew that Draco was hurt. He knew it without the words, he could see it in his eyes. It wasn’t easy for Harry to talk about his feelings, though he did share with Malfoy. The blonde was completely different. He didn’t open up at all, he tried not to show any signs of his feelings. Harry felt it, though. He felt it in that maniac laugh, in the way he breathed out the smoke, in the way he was sitting on the balcony fence (like he could jump from it any second, like it would be nothing for him to just let go of the black metal and fall). The scarred boy wanted to help Malfoy so much but how could he, if he couldn’t even help himself.
“Jesus, Pansy, whose side are you on? You are legitimately the worst friend I could possibly have!” Draco snarled.
“Right. Goodnight, Potter.” Draco turned and headed towards an alley where Harry was fairly certain he’d apparate home. Malfoy didn’t strike him as the type to walk any great distance.
“Why haven’t you tried to stop me?” Draco asks, no malice in his voice. Harry is stung into silence. “Probably because you know it’s for the best. It’s hard to accept when things are over, especially for you.”
“He’s asked me to go to ‘pub night’ with those Gryffindor brigands,” Draco said breathlessly after the laughter had died down. He’d attempted to tack this on to the conversation as casually as possible, as though he hadn’t spent an hour agonizing over possible responses to Potter’s owl.
“Fuck, you feel so good, Draco,” Harry breathes, licking and biting to punctuate his thrusts. This is a different kind of desperation, one that he hasn’t known before.
Draco made short work of Harry’s clothing, leaving him fully naked and waiting. Unable to hide his feelings of deep satisfaction when Harry’s heavy cock bounced back against his stomach, Draco grinned wickedly and leaned back on his heels. Harry’s eyes fluttered closed when Draco leaned forward to lick a stripe from the tip to the base of Harry’s cock, a small moan from escaping his lips. This was all the encouragement Draco needed before proceeding to take Harry into his mouth as far as he could. Swirling his tongue around the crown and savoring the salt and musk, Draco enthusiastically sucked until Harry was bucking and moaning.
“I almost messed everything up with us though, second guessing myself,” Draco replied, feeling guilty and grateful at once.
“Draco, just come in, please. I can let off early, we can go to the beach or something.” Blaise opened his arms out to Draco, who begrudgingly allowed himself to be enveloped in Blaise’s strong embrace. “I’m glad you’re here.”
“Potter, you’re going to go mad doing this. Of course I remember. I remember everything.” He kneels down on the floor next to Harry, fingers tenderly tracing the photograph of a beach sunset.
As shocked as they were by this new development, both Ron and Hermione seemed to take it in stride. Hermione shared she found Draco to be intelligent and thorough, having worked with him on several cases at the Ministry. Ron was less complimentary but appeared to soften to the idea of Malfoy with Hermione’s encouragement. Harry reasoned he must have been basking in his newly-engaged glow and clearly wasn’t thinking straight.
Harry shrugged. “Well, I guess I sort of did. It’s become kind of sacred to me I think. I’ve never recognized anyone here, and it’s in such a remote little corner of London. I usually come here when I need to work through something.”
When Harry pads downstairs, he does so cautiously; the silence in their flat feels fragile. He finds Draco at the kitchen table, head in his hands, tea too saturated with cream. Harry sets to work making a new one without asking - this much he can do.
“Guess it’s time for a drink,” Harry muttered to himself, wondering if it was bad form to drink his own housewarming gift.
“I - Certainly not,” Draco fumbles, tensing. He places an experimental hand on Harry’s chest, half-heartedly keeping him at a distance. “When have I ever given any indication-”
Recognition dawned across Pansy’s face. “Don’t think I don’t see what this is. This isn’t some kind of game. They’ve found their happy ending, and it doesn’t include you. You’re standing in
Harry watched him walk off to the apparition point, fighting back the sting in his eyes and throat. Harry knew what it meant when Draco didn’t bother arguing: It was a concession now that would lead to a massive explosion later. It didn’t matter though, Harry would rather watch his retreating back than face whatever he might have to say had he stayed.
Luna didn’t respond but instead smiled softly. Harry was filled with so much affection for her at that moment, he wanted to tell her everything, but he suspected she already knew anyway.
“Blaise?” Draco’s heart sank, realizing that he hadn’t thought of Blaise all night. Or the day before, really. Possibly even the day before that. “Pansy, I’ve got to go, alright? Thanks for checking in.”
In Luna’s kitchen, Harry was pleased he wouldn’t have to face the conundrum of drinking his own gift, impressed by the array of various and sundry beverages. More amusing still was the variety of drinkware. He carefully selected a coffee mug adorned with a mouse holding a daisy next to the words “FOLLOW YOUR DREAMS” in a curly pink font. Smiling, he poured himself some firewhiskey.
“What does this mean then, Draco?” His question is tentative, unsure he truly wants to hear the answer.
“I didn’t, that was just the question I really wanted to ask. I don’t actually care about your breakup, I think She-Weasley is abrasive and boorish, not unlike her brothers. Though I have to admit,
They both knew what more would mean. More kissing, more touching, more labels and reckoning with the fact that they were
“Nice of you to emerge from your cave, Potter. Aren’t we all so lucky?” Draco mocked, but Harry was relieved to find no edge to his voice.
They are young and they are reckless and they are dancing and dancing. It’s the best he’s felt in so many years, and he’s spinning around, wrapped up in a stranger’s arms. He doesn’t know this woman, but she smells good - like incense - and they’re laughing and twirling. He doesn’t know this band either, but it feels good to be lost in their music, and there’s something like excitement pooling in his belly. The woman runs back to her friends, thanking him for the dance, and he sends her off with a lopsided grin.
Sooner than he’d like, Harry finds his release inside of Draco, watching his face carefully, eyes searching. It’s his first time with another man, and in the afterglow he half-mourns the wasted time before he’d known what this was like.
Draco looks up at him, eyes bright and blazing. Seconds later, his hands and body are everywhere, pinning Harry against the wall, claiming every inch of his neck with his lips. Their kisses are fevered, all definitions of ache apparent in their movements.
“Christ, Parkinson, when did you get so hostile? I’ve just asked where Draco is, I’m not asking for his hand in marriage,” Harry spat, feeling embarrassed he was coming across so obvious.
Harry thanked her profusely and took the first opportunity to skirt questioning family members and run off to find the silver-haired man. He found Draco just outside the tent, leaning on a tree, looking cool and crisp in the humid summer air. A gentle breeze washed the sounds of distant merriment and various Weasley confections over them.
Draco let his hands wander, roaming the bed, canvassing the surface. Sliding his hands under a pillow, a sharp
“What kind of a fucking question is that? What do you mean why didn’t I? Because I fucking love you! Are you serious?” Harry knows he’s being too dramatic, too crass, but he doesn’t care.
“You know, I realize when everything happened with my father, you showed up for me a way I didn’t think anybody could. And when he passed, the freedom, the guilt, the deep, all-consuming sorrow I felt… I thought it might swallow me. But you kept me alive. What if I promised to do the same when the time comes? What if that commitment was enough?”
“Harry, I love you. I love you so much. But… no. You’re going to be an incredible professor, and I can’t hold you back anymore. I have to let you go.” Tears stream down Draco’s face and Harry thinks he’s never seen him so miserable. At that moment, he feels so bereft all he can do is watch as Draco leaves their home.
“We will,” Harry whispered back. “We’ll do it all... But for now we should probably get back to the reception. People will wonder where we’ve got off to.”
“Only a little. Funny to see you here,” Harry says, though not unkindly. “This doesn’t really strike me as the sort of place you’d want to be seen.” He gestures behind him to the black walls and smoke and Persian rugs. The venue itself seems to be the very antithesis of Draco Malfoy.
Ron, on the other hand, looked as though he might burst, as if he couldn’t wait to tell Malfoy he was precisely the opposite of pleased he had joined them. Chastened by a
“No, no you’re right. Merlin, you’re right.” He grabs Harry’s face and nestles it into his chest. “I suppose I’ve got a lot to work through with this.” A sharp intake of breath. “Harry, can you just take it for what it is then? That I’m not in a good place for it just yet? That it doesn’t mean I never will be.”
“You are Draco then? I’ve heard so much about you.” The woman smiled and extended her hand to Draco. “I am Vitória.”
was doing just fine on his own. He had Neville in hysterics discussing the necessity of pore strips. But if you want to be right then I’ll let you have that,” Hermione said with a shrug. “All I’m saying is, you looked happier last night than I’ve seen you in months.”
“So you feel like you’ll owe me a debt? By being with me? That’s what a partnership is to you?” Harry is so flustered, he can hardly contain his outrage. “What sort of fucked up concept of family is that?”
“What? Potter, you’re daft,” Draco says, looking away suddenly. Harry’s cheeks burn and his chest tightens.
Draco considered Harry’s outstretched hand for a beat, equally aware of the symbolism of this gesture and moment in time. Looking Harry right in the eyes, he reached out and shook his hand.
It was the sum of all of Draco’s fears. He knew Blaise had worn earrings occasionally, but this clearly belonged to someone with a more ornate taste. The pear-shaped carnelian stone glinted in foreboding. He closed his eyes in an attempt to quell the rage pooling in his stomach.
“So, you actually listen to music?” Harry strikes first, but it’s a hopeless shot at recovering any dignity because he tries to stifle a grin and probably just looks confused.
“What are you coming here to ‘work through?” Draco asked as he absentmindedly picked up and opened a book on windowsill gardening.
The bookshop was Harry’s secret treasure. He went there on days he was particularly sad, or particularly happy, depending on which he needed to experience more or less of. He loved wandering the aisles, reading the inscriptions on the insides of the used covers, names scribbled hastily in ink, notes to loved ones, almost always making up a story to go along with them. He could feel the residual magic in some of the books crackling in the air alongside the smell of brewing coffee from the cafe next door. He delighted in the dust and scent of aging paper, a constant when he felt slightly unbalanced.
“You’re good, Draco. You’re so good,” Harry whispers into Draco’s hair, pulling him down onto the bed. Their bed. He isn’t sure why he says it, he just does.
“Potter, what?” Draco rubs his temples, recognizing he is no longer absolved of his behavior. “It’s nothing you’ve done at all. I just- It’s hard for me to describe, but there was a time I never thought I’d make it this far. As in, still be alive. I could hardly see beyond the next day, and that sort of thinking just doesn’t change overnight. I don’t know if it ever does. Have you ever stopped feeling that way, like your days are numbered?” His expression changes slightly to one of pleading.
“I was wondering… if you’ve any plans for Christmas?” Draco sets the basket down, still staring out the window.
Harry felt absolutely shattered. While he knew that Draco wasn’t one to rush into any sort of commitment, he had never really imagined a scenario in which there was no promise of a future.
Reminded of the odd circumstance they found themselves in for the second time, Harry felt strangely vulnerable. “What
She blushed. “We were getting ready to go to Luna’s party, and it was such a clear night we decided we’d walk there. We were walking by these beautiful magnolia bushes and the moon was making everything glow, and Ron said he couldn’t wait anymore. He got down on one knee, right there in the street!” Tears were sparkling in her eyes at the memory.
“He’s... not here. He left last night.” Blaise said coolly, but Harry could see he was a bit shaken.
“I shan’t. Your head injury will probably heal soon, and you’ll be back to your old ways in no time.”
enough. “My aunt and uncle, they - they treated it like caring for me was a hardship, like I was a debt they had to pay off. I know they thought I was. I can’t do that again, Draco. I can’t stand the thought of you seeing me that way. Family’s not a burden. Love’s not a burden.”
Harry surveyed the room, memories scattered about, the last vestiges of a relationship seven years in the making. It appeared as though his entire life had been reduced to rubble and ash, the contents of his memory splayed haphazardly across the floor and sofa.
Draco’s eyes widen at this admission. Harry had all but taken a vow to never speak of the Dursleys, and it becomes all too clear why.
“What do you come down here to think about?” he asks benignly, his voice bleeding into a curious silence. Harry isn’t certain how an innocent query could feel so personal… but it does.
He wandered through the city, riding the streetcar rather than apparating. He wanted to see it all, take in this gorgeous place, before getting to Blaise. His stomach fluttered a bit when he arrived at the loft just outside of the city center. It too was gorgeous and steeped in ancient history from the looks of it. The building was white with elaborate wrought iron accents and vibrant tiles, Begonias scattered about the grounds. A soft breeze ruffled his hair lightly and carried him towards the steps.
It had been so hard for him to let Ginny go that Ron and Hermione eventually staged an intervention. Harry cringed in discomfort at the memory. He’d stopped seeing her then, mostly out of embarrassment, and became so committed to avoidance it became the norm. And thus began the season of Harry Potter rarely leaving his flat, save work and the occasional drink with Ron and Hermione.
“I know you like this time to think, but I wasn’t sure if you might want some company,” Draco whispers and scoots closer, warmth radiating.
“Well then why aren’t you jealous?” Harry half-shouts, wishing that Draco would get close enough to him so he could wreck his stupid facade. He’d wrap his wet hands in that perfectly coiffed silver hair and-
“Fine. Maybe I am, but it doesn’t change the fact we’ve been skirting around this for months. I want to know. This isn’t a game.” Harry is defiant, eyes piercing, willing Malfoy to just
With that, he walks away, feeling more confident than he probably should, but also revelling in the ability to ruffle Draco Malfoy’s sharply pressed feathers. He winces a little as he realizes he’s half-hard, but doesn’t bother to check in with what that might mean; Malfoy’s always been able to get under his skin.
Draco stills, leans back, and frowns. “What’s the matter with you?” His face is marked by annoyance, but he twitches in the way he does when he’s nervous.
“I’m in love with you,” Harry whispered against Draco’s lips. Draco stilled. “You don’t have to say anything back, it’s okay.”
in something,” Hermione responded, resting her face in her hands and looking at Harry over the table.
“I love you so much, I’ll marry you in front of everyone we know, and wear this ring, and probably adopt fifteen children, ten crups, and three toads to make you happy,” Draco said, turning and pressing their foreheads together.
I was lightly inspired by "The Ballad of Love & Hate" by the Avett Brothers, "Supercut" by Lorde, and "Saturdays" by Twin Shadow, and have thus listened to these songs probably more than 100 times while writing this short and sweet little thing. I really wrote this for no other reason than my own enjoyment, but in the process I ended up experiencing and working through a major loss/life event while doing so. You have all my gratitude for reading.
“I can’t say I’ve heard about you just yet, Vitória, but it’s lovely to meet you.” He raised her hand to his lips and planted a soft kiss in greeting.
“Mate,” Ron laughed, clapping him on the shoulder, “relax. We’re getting married. We got engaged on Saturday.” He was practically beaming, cheeks glowing deep pink and accentuating his freckles. They both looked so fucking happy.
And then they’re in the bedroom, jumpers pulled over heads, trousers and pants slipped roughly over hips. Groaning and flushed with arousal, Harry arches toward Draco, pressing their bodies together. Their motions are firm, promises made with every gasp, every breath.
Once inside the warm pub, Harry and Draco were smashed into a corner with what appeared to be the entirety of Dumbledore’s Army. Harry had informed Ron and Hermione that Draco would be joining them beforehand, as to be prepared. Hermione went as far as to provide a friendly reception, telling him she was  pleased he had come. In return, Draco congratulated her on their engagement, even remarking that the ring was lovely.
“I was thinking I would study potions, or maybe healing. I can’t- I’ve got to find a way to help.” Draco sits up straighter, clearing his throat. “Even if it’s not my father, it should be someone. Reparations should be made.” His face hardens as he says this, as though he’s accepted this fate.
was startling and they broke apart from each other for a brief second, only to crash back into the kiss at full speed and intensity.
“Oh bloody pestering buggerfuck,” Harry swore, tripping over himself on the stairs, nearly dropping the bottle of mead he’d brought as a housewarming gift for Luna.
“When is it not?” Draco uttered. “He told me how he felt and I basically spat in his face. He went all the way to godforsaken Portugal to- to win my hand or something! And I didn’t tell him the reason I went to Portugal was to figure out how I felt. After that night on the beach, I just wasn’t sure anymore. Honestly, I was furious at him for doing that behind my back… but I think I was more furious that I was too much of a coward to tell him how I really felt.”
“If by hatred you mean repressed sexual chemistry and thoughts of lewd acts perpetrated in the Prefect’s bathroom, then by all means!” Pansy guffawed, taking a swig of wine and laying waste to Draco’s attempt at saving face.
Harry had never felt closer to his friends, having spent the past week playing in pick up quidditch matches, catching gnomes, and drinking honeyed ale while watching the sunset. He spent time catching up with Luna and Rolf, who had rented a room in Ottery St. Catchpole and were exploring local fauna. He felt warm and happy, and most importantly, distracted. Though he couldn’t deny, watching the couples around him fall under the spell that only weddings can cast, he felt a deep pang of longing.
“I know, it’s just-“ Malfoy stopped walking and turned to face Harry. “It’s just a little weird for me is all.”
Eventually, he’d consumed enough alcohol that he was able to enjoy the reception, pushing all thoughts of Draco and their non-wedding from his mind. He danced with Luna and Xenophilius, the two of them attempting to teach him the Madagascan Quarter-Step, a flailing, spinning sort of motion that made him dizzy and sent him into fits of laughter. He clinked his glass and cheered to good health, longevity, and magizoology. Out of forgetfulness and force of habit, he only turned to tell Draco something once or twice.
“Hermione, Draco’s been dating Blaise for like four years. He wasn’t jealous. Maybe he was just upset that I’d left him to fend for himself,” Harry chided.
But Harry’s never been one for following these rules and continues to push on. “We should, you know. We never talk about anything,” he mouths against Draco’s neck.
And then their clothes are gone and they’re lying together, taking each other in inch-by-inch. Draco is the first to move, crawling on top of Harry and reaching between them. This time though, they don’t bring each other off with their hands or mouths. This time, Draco straddles Harry, taking him in slowly and deeply. Nods and whispers of encouragement urge him on, keep his hips moving in a gentle, steady rhythm.
Draco blinked at her. To be honest, he hadn’t even thought about Blaise since meeting with Harry. In fact, all he could really think about was Harry. He felt his lips open and close like a fish washed ashore.
Somehow, he managed to regain enough sense and respond. “Look, Draco, I’m sorry about everything. All I know is… I can’t let this go. Whatever this is. I like being with you. I like it so much. I’ve never felt as happy as I have spending time with you, and I know you’ve got Blaise-”
Taking in the new sensation and thrill of finally kissing Draco Malfoy, Harry let his eyes fall shut and softened into the kiss. Harry felt like he might explode, stars behind his eyes. Slowly, tentatively, Draco opened his lips, his tongue asking the question
“Well thank god, Potter, I’ve been able to think of little else. Simply waiting by the window each day.”
They move together then, Draco sinking slick fingers wordlessly into Harry, preparing him. Harry mewls and pushes back against Draco’s ministrations. It seems unfair to him that he should be the one receiving all of the attention when Draco had been laid so bare, but he lets him take what he needs.
The hallowed grounds of his alma mater have been a surprising comfort to Harry. No longer do the echoes in the halls harken back to horrors for him; no longer do the solid walls give way to explosions when he closes his eyes. This place has become home again, and he is rebuilding himself as well, brick by brick.
“Longbottom told me that you haven’t- that you haven’t been seeing anyone. Is he- is he correct?” In a most uncharacteristic fashion, Draco trips over his words, and his cheeks flush with color.
“Draco, you do that too. It’s what I like about you. One of the things, anyway. Maybe you’re a little more selective, but you protect what you care about.”
Harry felt anger rise in his chest and moved closer to Blaise. “You know something, Zabini? Neither do you.”
“Come here,” Draco growls and pulls Harry tighter. They crash together, a frenzy of lips and tongues and hands. Heat building between them, Harry begins to work Draco’s remaining shirt buttons, meeting his gaze for reassurance with every movement.
“Wait, what? Potter, you went to Portugal to try and - and what? Break us up or something? What in god's name is wrong with you?!” Draco’s eyes widened in confusion. “I don’t understand. Did you think it was some kind of grand gesture?”
Stunned into silence, Draco gawped. It wasn’t often that he found himself at a loss for words, and, he reflected sullenly, he shouldn’t be surprised Granger was the one to render him speechless.
“Yes, I’ll do that,” said Draco absentmindedly, calculating how much time he had before his disappearance would be questioned.
Hermoine broke out into sobs and launched herself into her mother’s arms. “Mum,” she cried, “It’s really you! You’re back.”
Draco stomped back into his bedroom and snatched his robe out of the closet, throwing it hastily around himself. He also took care to step into his favorite blue slippers, and then scuffed his way down the hallway and the marble staircase to the main drawing room. Ceeley was waiting for him, her head already immersed in the Malfoy’s massive fireplace.
Harry gripped Draco’s wet blonde hair, delicately pulling him close enough to embrace. Their arms and legs intertwined, and soon Draco couldn’t tell where he ended and Harry began. As their kisses started to grow more and more heated, Draco tugged off Harry’s t-shirt and started lightly sucking marks into Harry’s neck.
“Yes. If justice isn’t appropriately served, then you’re more than welcome to help me hex and curse them to our hearts’ content,” Harry says firmly.
Draco couldn’t stop himself from getting hard when he started thinking about the wonderful range of possibilities for him and Harry to explore. The brisk shower was still too long, and Draco found himself rushing through his usually pristine grooming ritual, the idea of finally being with Harry spurring him on.
“Mother sent me a gift?” breathed Draco, holding his towel with one hand and pushing his hair back with the other. “What’s the occasion? It’s not my birthday or Christmas…” remembering he’d lost all track of time, Draco added, “at least, I hope it isn’t.”
The other girls whooped and cheered, Potter’s voice loud among them, and, unconsciously, Draco felt a smile creep onto his own face. Maybe this was going to be worthwhile, after all.
Harry shrugged. He made the mistake of looking at her before she was done changing and accidentally got an eyeful. Wincing, he quickly turned away.
An hour later, he wasn’t so sure. The basic fielding had gone well, but running plays was an absolute nightmare, as was the base running. Several “pickles” had occurred on the field, but for some reason the girls couldn’t get down how to move in from each position and switch from place to place in order to tag the runner out.
Seeing visible evidence of Harry’s nervousness helped calm Draco’s nerves. “I’m showering right now,” he said, leaning down to kiss Harry without getting dirt all over him. “I’ll only be a short while.”
“We have to,” Draco said. Silently, they picked up the letters and tore in, Hermione shredding parchment all over the table in order to get past the stubborn wax seal.
After sending the final letter, Draco fell on the sofa, breathing deeply, already falling into despair. After an hour, he was able to tear himself off of the sofa, tear-stained and aching, and amble over to the Floo to firecall Hermione.
Potter’s eyes narrowed and he glared at both of his supposed best friends. “I thought we were in this for life, all of us together. You’re telling me that because I’m dating a man I have to choose between you and him?”
“We'll talk about that later," Malfoy said. As he pushed his hair back away from his face, Harry could see that his hands were badly shaking again. “I’ll have you know that is very unbecoming behavior for a Saviour. I must attend to something before our next class." With that, he practically sprinted away.
“I forgive you,” Hermione surprised herself as those words left her mouth. She hadn’t expected to tell Ron that she forgave him, much less actually mean it. But, somehow, having her feelings recognized meant a lot, as did the apology.
“Go, Harry! Faster!” shouted Nate from the first base line, planted firmly in the dirt, furiously pointing towards second base with his right hand and wheeling madly with his left.
“Yeah, let’s go.” Harry released the Snitch and watched its golden wings flitter so fast they were only a blur, their delicacy reminding him instinctively of Draco.
Harry took his turn at walking Draco through his experiences with not only Junior Auror life, of which he had an endless amount of stories (he relayed the one about underwear that he’d already told Hermione earlier that day with great success), but also the cultural differences that inevitably came as a result of working with Americans.
He sits down across from Malfoy, helping himself to a few pieces of pizza and a generous helping of salad. As he picks up his first piece with his hand, Malfoy eyes him almost distastefully and cuts up his own pizza into neat bites with his knife and fork. He smiles. Malfoy’s changed a bit, but some things always stay the same.
But even as an intern, Harry had noted some major differences between the Aurors in Britain and the ones in California. The British Aurors were more action-oriented, more willing to get their hands dirty, less motivated by tactical safety. Not to say that they didn’t carefully plan out operations, but there was a workplace style perhaps best embodied by Mad Eye, even if he was at the more extreme end of things; the British Aurors had an overwhelming preference towards operating on judgement and gut feeling, trusting comrades from base to provide further direction if it should be needed. Stateside Aurors contracted other experts to come in and work on the ground, preferring to watch their plans unfold from the safety of the office. There was more respect and prestige accorded to Aurors Stateside, but Harry preferred the grittier, hands-on-methods of the British force. He knew Ron secretly agreed with him, but because it was easier to advance ranks in the U.S., they’d so far silently agreed not to talk about it.
“I’m leaving now, you heartless beast,” Harry teases. He extracts himself from Draco’s body and stands, letting the pins and needles work their way out of his muscles.
“This relationship,” said Harry, closing his eyes. “It’s not fair to you, and I don’t expect I’ll snap out of it anytime soon.”
“Potter, that’s simply not happening. I do have to learn the game for my position, but as you said, there’s simply too much already on your plate.”
“I took a little trip out East, and while I was touring New York, this absolute nutter saw me playing catch with my mate and tried to recruit me to play baseball,” Cale said mischievously.
Draco tentatively took a step, groaning when he realized his patent leather shoes were getting sandy as well as sweated in. America was not glamorous, at least in the heat of summer. Pushing up his sleeves, he walked towards the voices, still dragging along his designer rucksack.
Potter shrugged. “They all know whether they want to be infield or outfield. That’s a start. Besides, if they’re versatile, that’s better for the team.”
“Damn straight,” said Nate, clapping Cale hard on the back. Harry could see him wince. “Let’s go over to the bleachers for this, though. I have some exciting handouts for you all…”
instead of as their Savior. Also, he felt like he could really make a difference in the lives of the children they were going out to help. California was only a bus ride away...
“I’m game,” said Harry. “Sounds fantastic. So what, are we going to each get our own team or something?”
“We really can’t. I know you don’t like Draco, but I want him in my life. You’ll have to decide if you can live with that.” Harry sank down into the warm sand, twenty feet from the water’s edge, and Ron joined him.
“It’s not like I’ve never gotten dirty before,” Harry smirked, brushing himself off while raising his eyebrows and rolling his hips suggestively.
“Yes?” Malfoy’s posh voice rang out in the room, even with echoing through the fireplace. Even while speaking just one syllable, the git had perfect enunciation.
Out of his peripheral vision, Draco could see that Potter looked taken aback. “Um, yeah? You could just say no if you don’t want company, Malfoy.” He shook his head and turned to walk away, but Draco called after him.
“Why were you pretending to be asleep?” Draco demanded, having recovered from his shock, though he was still holding a hand over his heart for good measure.
It initially felt weird—other than that one time on the living room floor, no one besides Harry had ever cuddled him—and Draco was tense until Hermione reached out and pulled him back against her chest.
“Mate,” said Ron. “You need to lay off. They’re going to put you on probation if you get into it with Schrader again…”
As they skimmed, something clicked in Draco’s mind. “Granger?” he asked tentatively. “Are you quite alright with publishing a discovery relating to the Dark Arts?”
endure? Even if they did have sex, it was more than likely that Potter would become distant and back to normal when school resumed. Summer was a time for experimentation, not one for people to truly fall in love.
Taken aback by the pure venom in her voice, Harry wondered if it would be possible for her to find forgiveness for Draco in her heart.
Draco met Mike’s eyes, wrinkling his nose and snorting dubiously. “As if. Of course he’s going to flip a shit, especially after Potter got his goat earlier.”
Something was nagging at the front of his mind. He tried to embrace the memory, but it eluded him. Frowning, Harry continued to watch the game –rather, the
The situation is getting direr by the second. Not yet panicking, Harry lands a punch on Asten’s ribs and aims a knee for his crotch, desperate to escape the situation. Before he can execute his next move, Asten whips out his own wand and wordlessly binds Harry’s hands behind his back.
“We have a new dawn,” says Draco fiercely. “Let’s make the most of it.” Harry pulls Draco into a passionate, loving kiss, and they stay out on the balcony long after the sun assumes its proper place in the sky.
“Carpe diem, mate,” said Ron, pushing through the open door and turning on the light inside. “Cappuccinos or Americanos?”
“You didn’t hear the most embarrassing part of it,” reveals Harry. “So before Seamus was, er, in the middle, this brunet was blowing him.”
After 45 minutes spent staring blankly at the screen, Draco was in a snit. Damn fashion to hell, anyway. What was so great about having options when getting dressed? He could wear gray and black trousers and formerly-starched shirts for the rest of his life. Draco snapped his laptop closed, stood up, and angrily ran his fingers through his hair. The very next second, he reflected on what Lucius would think of his temper tantrum; he very clearly remembered all of the “common behaviors” he was instructed to avoid. Well none of that mattered now, seeing as he was attending an
“That’s correct,” Narcissa admitted, resigned. “I was content with your father’s wish to bring you up in accordance to his beliefs on, ahem, certain matters.”
Eventually he emerged from the cabin, exhaustedly walking down the little path towards the central picnic area.
“Alright, mate?” he ventures, nicking a taste of the pie filling. Merlin, Hermione’s improved drastically in the kitchen since Harry started helping her cook Saturday night dinners.
Like a fish, Ron’s mouth gapes for a minute, but then he closes his jaw and makes an active effort to be more mature. “Apology accepted. For what it’s worth, Malfoy, I’m sorry for the things I said and did as well. Unless you hurt Harry, that is. Then you better believe we’ll be enemies again.”
Harry’s eyes snapped open; that was not an image he ever wanted to contemplate again. “I don’t know, Gin, I guess part of it is. I couldn’t feel anything then either.”
Malfoy and Nate turned around to stare daggers at him, but Harry defiantly met the eyes of both, barreling ahead anyway as the subconscious part of his brain sighed and wondered how he always got himself into these scrapes. The entire team looked at him in surprise.
Dumbfounded, Harry met Mrs. Weasley’s eyes, and Draco witnessed the silent battle of wills between them. It was a showdown almost as intense as some of the ones he’d had with Father during his later school years.
“Why not be comfortable, Potter?” Draco would definitely be slouching away throughout all of his classes. Even on thin ice, he was prepared to risk a bit of wrath to not have his back hurting for once.
from the force of Draco’s shove and from Draco’s body falling into his own, reveling in the adorable blonde hair now covering Draco’s eyes.
Draco laughed, tugging Harry closer. They sat together, entwined on the kitchen chair, until Harry’s legs started falling asleep.
“Their Bloody Mary is fantastic,” Kingsley said in an undertone. He clapped Harry on the shoulder again before excusing himself and walking away.
He listened to Harry’s and Hermione’s suggestions to lay off the work once he woke up later, listening to Hermione pattering around the house as he started crocheting a new afghan and watched the neighbor’s cat evade Crookshanks. Draco hadn’t expected a response until Sunday at the earliest, but when Abalona returned that evening, slightly rumpled but in otherwise good condition, his stomach dropped.
“I would have asked you and Draco,” said Luna worriedly, “but I wanted it to be a surprise, especially after you mentioned how much you hate doing interviews.”
“Oh, yes, I suppose that’s a bit of a giveaway.” And with that, a smile crept across Hermione’s face.
Malfoy didn’t even flinch. “Why would we start fighting, Potter? Under ordinary circumstances, that is.”
“Nothing is permanent, Draco, and maybe this shift won’t have to be. The Ministry might back down to external pressure, if activists start protesting these new ordinances.”
Merram replied on Monday morning, asking Draco if he could come that afternoon. Draco could. He reluctantly put some of his nice pre-online-shopping-excursion clothes, and headed down to Merram’s office.
“Let’s start with one of the most obvious,” Luna eventually decided, rustling their lists. “Harry, how can you justify dating a former Death Eater who formerly or even currently opposes everything you stand for?”
He was also certain that Molly considered their relationship to be a passing phase, something he would grow out of after the initial shock of the War ended. But deep down, Harry knew he and Draco were meant to be together. Fate kept them on opposite sides for years, but despite that, they’d been strangely drawn to each other in ways that couldn’t be dismissed as a rivalry or even jealousy. Though they definitely didn’t
In the end, a mix of restlessness and caution won out. Instead of attempting a cross-continental trip, Harry decided to try Apparating to a random point in the state. There wasn’t a lot of time left before it got dark because the sun went down early in this part of the world, so he centered himself and meditated for a minute before Disapparating with a
Back in the wizarding world, Harry Potter was having a much less successful day. He’d also gone back to Hogwarts to study for NEWTS, mainly at Hermione’s insistence, and had managed to achieve the scores required to go into Auror training. Frankly, Harry expected that the Ministry would have accepted his application anyway, seeing as he
She was pulled out of her musings by Draco shouting from the kitchen, “Can you bring the fresh Lysol from under the sink?” There was definitely a slight undertone of panic to his voice. For that reason, and that reason alone, Hermione retrieved the Lysol quickly and wandered back out to the kitchen. She was greeted with a strong, lemony scent and an enormous neon yellow puddle in the middle of the floor, which Draco was frantically trying to wipe up.
Harry slides off of his bar stool and slouches off towards the bathroom. He has the foresight to knock on the door, even though it would look suspicious to everyone else in the bar that happened to notice. When no noise was forthcoming, he pushes open the door and walks in. Having seen Seamus in some pretty compromising positions before, Harry is still surprised to see his friend engaged with not only one, but two men; the brunet on the ground blows Seamus while a blonde man takes him from behind.
“You should shower,” Hermione said wearily. Pent up anxiety would prevent her from napping before Harry and Ron arrived, but there would definitely be time for a soothing cup of tea and some rest—the tried and true practices of professional housewives and househusbands had nothing on Draco’s cleaning routine.
Before Nate could think of another reason to stay longer, the team–showing more excitement than they had all day–jumped off the bleachers and fled to collect their scattered gear. Harry and Cale stayed behind with Nate, Cale still writing their names down.
. In the end, the curiosity got the best of Draco and so he ripped it open, allowing his eyes to furiously scan the page.
Politely excusing himself, Draco walked over to her with nervous trepidation in his stomach, uncertain as to what would happen next. She’d always seemed chill, but he’d quickly learned that, at camp, the goofiest of staff members could quickly tap into a seriousness that rivaled even the most professional Ministry members.
“Yes, really,” said Potter. “I’ve hoped to see you again after all these years. Congrats on your Potions Mastery, by the way.”
Not to mention his terrible self-destructive tendency of admiring the aesthetics of Malfoy’s body. Harry loved the way the blonde looked in baseball clothes and sweats, but he was sure that Malfoy dressed up and in his element would be hotter than anything he’d ever seen before.
“Harry,” Draco moaned, running his fingers through Harry’s hair and tightening his grasp whenever Harry did something particularly good. “More. Please.”
It was a reasonably short walk down to the Lodge. Draco made the most of it, striding along through the sleepy meadows as through as though he didn’t have another care in the world. The morning air was fresh and he found himself breathing deeply for the first time in months: Ministry-sanctioned cultural rehabilitation came with the side effect of stress and little sleep.
Zee groaned, turning to Becky Lou as they reached home plate. “Can you believe this guy? Why do I even stay on this team?”
Seamus smirks. “Oh, you’ll see.” He grasps Harry’s arm above the elbow and spins on the spot to initiate Apparation. After regaining his bearings, Harry discovers that they’d landed in the middle of a very high class business district, filled with Arguers and private Healers. At the end of the row, there is a cream colored square building decorated with tasteful peacock feathers. Though in any other setting the decor would have looked tacky, it works in this situation. Seamus makes for the front door, Harry right behind.
Despite what Harry suspected to be an iron internal will, Ginny’s tears kept falling hard and fast. Mentally and emotionally unable to deal with the situation for even another minute, Harry fled to Sirius’s bedroom to collapse for a few minutes before considering what would come next.
It was morbid and grotesque, but he leaned back down and inhaled again. After a month and a half of nothing feeling right, this one flower made Draco feel as though he’d come home.
The next couple months flew by. Though Draco still wasn’t entirely welcome by students (or some of the staff) at the Hogwarts renovations, being with Harry made everything worthwhile. Unconsciously, he started working harder and putting more heart into his efforts. Small traits of Harry’s were starting to rub off on him, but Draco was reasonably sure that he was having an equal effect on the Saviour so he wasn’t too upset. For example, Harry seemed to have taken what Draco had said about owning up to his own opinions and desires to heart. Instead of working solidly without breaks all, Harry established a new schedule. Draco considered a later start to the morning, a solid hour for lunch, and calling it quits in the mid-afternoon much more reasonable. What he liked best was that Harry would often drop by the Manor around half-past eight every morning so they could have tea and biscuits together before Apparating over to Hogwarts.
Exasperatedly, Hermione slapped a hand to her forehead. “That’s not what I meant, either, Malfoy,” she groaned. “Emotionally. How did it feel emotionally?”
“Hermione had to get up early for an Unspeakable meeting, and because she had to be awake, she decided I had to be awake too,” says Ron, equally drowsy. “Then she told me I should go check on you because you haven’t quite been yourself lately.”
Immediately, Draco snatched his hand away from his mother and stepped back. He furiously regained his composure and lashed out at his mother. “And what’s that supposed to mean? Did you not even believe half the things you led me to believe were true?”
Draco gave Potter an injured look. “Speak for yourself, Potter. I’ll have you know that all of my favorite foods can be served at the grandest of occasions, if one knows the proper herbs to garnish them with and the best plating methods to use.”
Sighing, Weasley plopped the Pastille back in the package and looked at Draco again. “He’s my best mate,” he said quietly. “I’ve done a rubbish job of being there for him, and you’re just part of the package now, Malfoy.”
“The govt. has fallen. Scrimgeour is dead. They’re coming” was all the text message said, but it was enough. With practiced ease, the Weasleys disbanded the wedding party amid the flurry of chaos. Harry didn’t have time to feel bitterness about the summer wedding being interrupted before Hermione was ushering him into the front seat of the car and putting it in reverse.
“You were victimized, but nothing was taken from you,” Malfoy explains, calming his confusion with a simple hand gesture. “Your identity is not based on the act of sex. Sexuality and the expression of sexuality are a part of your identity, but by no means do they fully comprise it.”
“Shit,” Draco muttered under his breath. This is exactly what he feared would happened. Any second now, Potter would accuse Draco of trying to intentionally hit him and then walk off the field.
Their hug conveyed a thousand things that words could not, and Harry felt his anger drain away the longer they held each other.
“Rihanna?” Harry inquired as Malfoy stepped up to make their song selection. He smiled in response, all teeth.
He shoved in another forkful of carrots, buying time. Took a sip of water. Wiped his mouth, patting the corners carefully. “What’s there to say?” he said finally.
“Calm down, Potter,” the voice sniped. “You’re going to take my eye out. What kind of wizard are you? Treating a wand that way,
“Cecelia!” Malfoy enthused, letting go of his composure for a rare second. Harry watched how his face lit up and his gray eyes shone, feeling a trace of envy for the way Malfoy opened himself up to this woman. “How did you recognize me?”
“Oomph,” Draco coughed weakly. “Control yourself, you great brute.” Unlike Nate’s platonic hug, Draco was vividly aware of his attraction to Potter, which was only made worse as he felt Potter’s back muscles flexing beneath his hands. He took a deep breath, hoping it would have the same calming effects it did upon the mound.
. “We’ve been working to revise this for the last year now, and I’m ready to be done with it. It’s time to move onto the next chapter,” Draco said decisively.
Draco was left alone on the baseball field, watching the wind stir up the loose dust and blow it around. He was oddly curious about what it would feel like to actually play a competitive game on a field so different than the Qudditch Pitch, which would, as Potter had so kindly pointed out, involve running.
Harry’s pondering came to an end when Cale started swearing at the steering wheel. “Blimey, could it be any harder to find? Can either of you make out the address? I can’t see the numbers.”
Harry laughed. “They’ll come around. The whole summer would be such a blast, honestly. I haven’t done any traveling in America yet, and California is supposed to be beautiful.”
“Right,” agreed Hermione. “There’s some past texts we need to reference--Maculliver’s ‘Intuitive Essential Oils’, for one.”
He almost was ashamed of himself–after all, Malfoys did not simply lose face over something as silly as kissing a man–but was sure that he wasn’t upset at what he
“Well thank you very much,” said Draco, rolling his eyes. He chose to let it go. Snuggling with Potter would be a fine way to put an end to this morning and there was no need to ruin the easy camaraderie between them.
Astounded, Harry’s jaw dropped. Ginny continued to seethe at him, hand now on her hips. “Were you planning to actually tell me how you felt?” he asked mutely.
“I’m sorry I neglected you today. Transfiguration is kind of our time, isn’t it?” Draco said. "I'll do better next time. I'm starting to quite adore your friend, though."
As he got closer and closer to climax, Draco’s mouth became wetter and he sucked Harry harder in an effort to bring them both off at the same time. When Harry slicked up another finger and slid two inside, stimulating the prostate with every thrust, Draco found himself fucking himself back into Harry’s hand, clenching around his fingers as he came longer and harder than he’d probably ever before. Draco’s vision blacked out for a moment as he came in Harry’s mouth and as, a few breaths later, Harry came down his throat.
“Agreed,” said Hermione. “How about for the rest of this week, you research the Obfuscation Elixir and see what else has been done, and I’ll continue revising the draft?”
“—I will not accommodate that request,” McGonagall said coldly, who had come in behind the chairman. “Mr. Malfoy is a student here and cannot continue his education under lock and key.”
“No, Potter!” cried Draco, the flush already returning to his pale cheeks. “I meant it when I said we were going to be late.”
Malfoy nodded back at him, delicately sipping his own tea, and tried the sandwich himself. At least he didn’t wince, Harry thought, so that had to be a good sign. Finishing the sandwich and turning to the biscuit, Harry seized a chocolate one and dunked it into his tea before taking a bite. Bugger propriety; he was going to actually enjoy his food. To his complete surprise, Malfoy picked up a vanilla one and followed suit, smiling at Harry’s shock.
Granger beamed. Draco scowled, but secretly felt a wave of comfort hit. This was normal, Granger showing him up in class. Her intuitions didn’t take away from his knowledge, but, as usual, she bested him seemingly without trying.
Pushed past his breaking point, Draco stepped into the shower anyway, still garbed in his bathrobe. He found that he could at least pull it away from his skin enough to soap up and rinse off, and he did just that. Though the shower was far from what he’d envisioned, Draco tried to keep his composure intact even as he realized that he was drowning in bureaucracy. He stayed in the shower for far too long.
They were interrupted as Slughorn started class, droning on for an unpleasantly long time about the Hauntification Potion, one Draco’d known how to make since third year. Finally, they reached the practical portion of the lesson. Though Draco had the sneaking suspicion he wasn't going to be let off of the hook that easily…
He hadn’t intentionally waited until she took a sip of tea to say it, but it turned out that way. She sprayed tea all over the table, coughing.
Ginny did not waver under his glare. “What do you mean, “What do I mean?” You’ve been cold and distant for months. I knew you were studying hard, but it never stopped you from being affectionate before at Hogwarts. And then when you started working full-time I thought things would get back to normal.”
“I can’t imagine any lavender more beautiful than the blooms in your backyard.” Harry hadn’t meant to say it, it had just slipped out, but somehow, that was what he was meant to say in this moment. Draco spun around and fixed him with a piercing stare.
“It’s bloody amazing,” he praises, taking another enormous bite. “God, Malfoy, I can’t believe that you didn’t use magic.”
day, without question) but he desperately wanted to get Potter alone again. They were too tired to even grab dinner after Potter finally let them call it quits, so Draco would always return back to the Manor alone.
Potter smiled, a knowing look in his eyes. "I can hardly blame you, Malfoy. Let's save it for next time, yeah? Thank you for bringing me here."
Draco walked with Potter around the winding path, taking in the roses, lilies, and tulips as well as the more dramatic sunflowers and draping wisterias. They sat in the shade of the lone willow tree, watching the wind softly blow the tall grass from side to side. Draco could not remember feeling so at ease in years; possibly since before he started at Hogwarts. Theirs was a relaxed companionship, but still Draco could feel the chemistry between them. He longed to reach out and take Potter’s hand, but the time still didn’t feel right yet.
“Feisty one, are you? I honestly never thought you’d be this much trouble. Your friend said that you were raring to go.”
“I can hear perfectly, you wanker,” snarled Potter. “I’m just not sure that you’re not having me on right now.”
“Ooh,” drools Harry, snatching one up. “Try it. It has to have the peanut sauce, though. He dunks it in the nutty brown sauce and takes a ginormous bite, eyes rolling back in his head because of how good it is.
“I’m not going to sleep with him,” Draco said, resigned. “He probably shouldn’t stay with us, and if he’s here for more than a week then it’s going to feel too permanent.”
“Draco, they accepted our article!” Hermione exclaimed, blasting out his eardrums in her excitement.
He expected to fall away, to lose consciousness and awareness simultaneously. Of course, there was always the other option, which Draco had always refused to think about when he was alive. If his life was already a living hell, what right did some deity have to make him spend an eternity there?
“Fine, Potter, I’m sure I can find something suitable for you in my closet. Tipsy!” he summoned the elf. “Help Potter work the shower and give him a set timer—we wouldn’t want to keep Granger and Weasley waiting.”
“Pass that over here,” Draco said, extracting a hand from the cover to feel around for the rest of the potion. She passed it to him, and he took the rest of the dose. “I feel human again,” Draco groaned, “But it’s still way too early for this.”
Narcissa continued, “As you’ve so bluntly pointed out, I am no Death Eater. That doesn’t mean I am free of blame, but I have a chance for a new life. I can only wish you can trust in yourself and embrace the unknown as well.”
Actually, there wasn’t much that could rile Harry up anymore. He simply felt too empty inside, too far removed from everyone around him. Even when visiting Ron and Hermione there was still a void inside of him that he could not fill, a void that caused him much melancholy. He would act glum and gloomy quite often, but his friends put up with his behavior while discouraging it heavily. Sometimes he would forget himself and become consumed with their good humor, but it was happening less and less lately.
“Harry, have you realized yet that you literally just saved the world? People have no business asking you for anything else, because you’ve already done more than most ever will in a lifetime.”
Sighing, Harry nodded in sympathy. “I understand, ‘Mione. I really hope that this doesn’t affect our relationship.”
“Yes,” he breathes back, rotating around enough to take Draco’s lips with his own. This time, Draco gives himself fully to Harry, ghosting his fingers over Harry’s back and petting his hair, cheeks, and jawline.
Lucius was still in Azkaban for his crimes, a situation to which Draco was indifferent. Without his father’s influence, he could have avoided years’ worth of suffering. He would have never joined the Dark Lord out of his own inclination. Draco reluctantly admitted that Lucius was his father, but refused to allow him to play any role in the decisions he made now or would make after Lucius was released.
Draco wasn’t planning on making any farewells (he’d thought about leaving a note for Mother, but had ultimately decided against it) except to himself. He had some time now, so maybe it was worth it to see if he could come to any sort of closure about his – he didn’t like to think the word –
“It’s called money, Potter,” grates Malfoy. His hand tightens in Harry’s hair, but he takes a deep breath and makes an obvious effort to calm down. “Obviously you did not read the special issue of the
“I’ll have you know that I like these clothes,” said Draco, feeling only a little foolish. Part of him still longed for proper wizarding robes and attire.
“Yeah, yeah,” Potter groused, standing up and brushing the dirt off the back of his Muggle jeans. With a wave of his wand, the bag full of bread suddenly Transfigured into a reasonably comfortable-looking mattress, though it was adorned with Gryffindor colored sheets, pillows, and covers.
undignified enough to use a bag of frozen peas) a light flipped on above his head. Draco spun around, clutching a container of frozen cranberry juice. Hermione met his eyes, wearing a scowl and her ratty old dressing gown.
“You’re the Head Auror, though,” blurted Harry. He was certain to be accused of being impulsive or hot-headed under the “by the book” attitude he noticed that Dawlish had.
“No,” he admitted, sitting down at the table. She’d covered his meal with that weird Muggle plastic, and moisture had gathered at the top. Regardless, it was still warm. Draco had the passing thought that she must have put a Warming Charm on it too, but it didn’t matter, really. He dug in. The potatoes were homemade, and the steak was tender and rare, just the way he liked it.
“–-and Hartely’s ‘Purposeful Stirring,” Draco added. “Because we removed every eighth counter-clockwise stir.”
“Now that you’re up, do you mind helping with the eggs?” Hermione called, her voice lilting above the sound of sizzling meat. “You’re very particular about them, you know, and I’ve already had to throw out one batch of burned sausage.”
Hermione sat in her own kitchen and watched as her best friend prepared two ham sandwiches, cutting some of the fresh apples in the fruit bowl for a healthy side. “You never used to eat apples,” she remarked.
“The New York CFBA is putting together a whole summer league for out of state teams to fully milk the publicity and positive press that comes along with us coaching. Our entire team has to play weekly, and we can only add one more person on our roster: a pitcher that can sub out for any other position in case of an injury.”
It never comes. A huge crash erupts from the left side of the room, and Harry blearily raises his head to see Draco Malfoy, still fully costumed in his leather riding crops, standing with his wand out in the bathroom doorway after having clearly blasted his way in.
Draco’s fork scraped the plate. There were carrots too, and Hermione had remembered to season them with butter and nutmeg. He couldn’t have asked for a better meal. Across the room, another page turned. The silence seemed pregnant.
“Apparating. But first, let’s pre-game it up a little. They have shit drinks, but we’re not going for the booze.” Seamus pulls a flask out of his jacket pocket, takes a long swig, and then passes it to Harry. Remembering his vow to be in control of his senses, Harry throws back the liquor, but blocks the hole with his tongue so only a little liquid flows into his mouth.
“Why should I listen?” shouted Hermione. The rage bubble inside her was finally at the breaking point, long after Draco predicted it would rise to the surface. “When did
“Well, Mum wasn’t too happy with him,” Weasley grinned, “But he was so enthusiastic about it really that she didn’t have the heart to shut him up.”
About two drinks in, after countless complaints about their own teams, taking the mickey out of Zee, and speculating how the game was going to go on Monday, Cale announced that it was time for karaoke.
After crossing the wooden stairs that only creaked slightly, Seamus steps up to the knocker and purposefully rapped it three times. A face is suddenly visible in the small mirror centered in the door, looking to Seamus with purpose.
“My father wanted me to become a Death Eater,” Draco said evenly, but with a slight edge. “Disappointing him was only slightly less dangerous than defying the Dark Lord.”
“Oi, Malfoy,” the only girl amongst them said sarcastically. “Since you think you’re so clever, always putting yourself on a pedestal, we thought you might appreciate it if we stuck you up on one permanently!”
Club, after all. His reluctance reached an all-time high when the next game, “Spin the Bottle,” was announced. Once he understood the rules of the game, Draco became convinced that his teammates were all just horny fucks. They explained the rules to him – you spin the bottle and kiss whoever it points to – and he could only imagine where they’d been. There weren’t rumors of mad STD outbreaks on campus for no reason.
When Draco finally switched with one of his co-counselors and was allowed to come back into the shade, he was relieved to see that the counselors were sitting amongst the campers on the picnic benches. He squeezed onto the end of one of the outside benches, so that the other three were behind him. Noticing that their unit director, Beans, who stayed in their living unit with them and flitted from group to group to oversee the counselors, was present, Draco decided to strike up a conversation with the camper sitting next to him instead of daydreaming about literally anything else but camp. At least his “Me Time” wasn’t too far away.
Oddly enough, the first person he found himself wanting to tell about all of this was Potter. Not even Pansy, who would certainly have something to say about the situation, could be trusted for an unbiased opinion. Draco could imagine her, delighted he had managed to find himself such a business-minded partner, practically drooling over the possibility of accompanying him on a visit to Portugal; it nearly turned his stomach. No, now was the time for an honest conversation.
Harry sat down across from Draco at a small table in their favorite coffee shop. He ran a hand through his hair, contemplating whether or not to tell the truth or just buy himself some time. He glanced over at Draco, who looked genuinely concerned, and felt something break inside of him. Harry knew he had to tell him, despite the fact he wanted to stare at Draco for a little longer and just be in his presence before the inevitable explosion that was to come.
Draco’s international portkey landed him on a wizarding platform of the Lisbon metro system. He walked through the ward and into a bustling terminal, filled to the brim with people in varying degrees of business and blatant tourist attire.
“What’s happened here?” Draco asks, startling Harry deeply, and turning off the music with a flick of a wrist.
Clear as day in his hazy vision is Draco Malfoy, also propped up against a wall and smirking. Harry hasn’t seen him since the trials, and he looks so different. It’s obvious he’s already been spotted, judging by the look of sheer… well, he can’t fully put his finger on whatever is playing across Malfoy’s face. Carried by the vibrations of the music and the sentiment of
They lay like that for a while, kissing slowly and talking about the wedding, and the past several weeks. They’d fallen into such an easy rhythm lately, it was hard for Draco to imagine it had been any other way.
They grabbed their coats and headed for the door, pausing awkwardly in the chilly night air. Harry broke the silence with a question that had been hounding him the entire night.
“Shut up, you cow,” Draco snapped, before joining in the laughter himself. “And don’t say that Potter’s sexy again or I’ll have you committed.”
“What do you suppose ‘my fire’ needs?” Harry asked, moving closer to Draco. He couldn’t help himself.
“But he asked you! You have to admit it’s been a while since you’ve made any new friends, especially since the...” Hermione caught herself before she finished. Both she and Ron tiptoed around discussing his breakup with Ginny, and scarcely even used the word. “Anyway,” she waved her hand in dismissal, “I think it would be good for you.”
He realizes with jarring clarity he hasn’t considered the implications Lucius’ past might have on receiving treatment. He hasn’t had to; Draco has shouldered this burden entirely alone. The thought makes him ache to his bones.
However, the holidays always seemed to leave Harry in a state of limbo; it seemed he felt simultaneously closer to and farther from the people he’d lost. He couldn’t help but let his thoughts stray toward a sort of fantasy life he’d created. He imagined a gathering around a holiday table, his family doing even the most heartbreakingly simple of things. In this world, he’d invented small quirks for them: James’ obsession with holiday tchotchkes, Lupin’s eternal pursuit of the perfect Bakewell tart, Sirius’ off-key rendition of “God Rest Ye Merry Hippogriffs” at the top of his voice (this fondly extracted from reality). His mind grasped at wisps of memory, real or imagined, it didn’t matter. It was strange, Harry thought, experiencing longing for and comfort in things he’d never had. And instead of the typical admonition with which he usually met his grief and longing, Harry indulged himself in this world. In doing so, he often found himself lying at the bottom of the tree, looking over the detail of each ornament with a bittersweet pang in his heart.
“I wish there was something I could do,” Harry says softly, feeling suffocated by the warmth of the small attic and the candles’ gentle glow. The air hangs heavy between them, splintered with feelings that have no business being there.
“Between your fire and her fire you were bound to burn the house down,” Draco said gently. “You need more than that.”
“No! Not bad per se. I just- I just don’t want anything to change. Obviously it has to, and we’re not kids anymore, but it was the three of us. And then when I was with Ginny, it was the four of us. And now it’s just the two of them… and me.”
“I don’t,” Draco half-whispered. “If you had really known me then, you would have seen how scared and weak I was. You would’ve hated me even more.”
A familiar drawl startled Harry into action. He quickly spun around, sloshing his drink on the already sticky kitchen floor.
“We’re so sorry, Harry,” Hermione said gently. “We just weren’t sure if you were actually going to go, and we er - got a bit wrapped up.”
“You may as well be, Potter. Don’t ruin this for them,” Pansy warned, voice dripping with vitriol. “They’re my best friends, like family. You’ve somehow managed to weasel your way into Draco’s good graces because he’s let his guard down for a minute. His heart may have softened to you, but mostly I think he feels sorry for you.”
“No,” Harry concedes. “But what if this is the chance to start something new? What if these are the children I’m meant to have, and we’re the family we’ve chosen and created? What if that’s enough?” he asks earnestly, echoing conversations of years past.
And with that, Draco crossed the space between the two of them and softly cupped Harry’s cheek in his hand. Staring into his eyes, searching them for what felt like an eternity, Draco’s eyes fluttered closed and he gently guided their lips together.
He eyed his friends suspiciously. “Am I missing something here? Is this some sort of double entendre and you’re trying to invite me to learn more about your sex life?” Harry puzzled, feeling rather disturbed. “Because I really don’t need-”
Reaching down between them, Harry pulled on his cock before coming in hot jets against their bellies, calling Draco’s name as he found release.
“Guess that’s true,” Harry admitted, exhaling. “I thought ‘following my dreams’” he gestured to the mug, “might inspire me to try and enjoy this party, but really what my dreams are telling me to do is to go back to my flat, order takeout, and watch the telly with my hand down my pants.”
“Please, it was one night out in an attempt to make peace. I see Granger constantly at the office.” Annoyance rippled at the surface of Draco’s response. “Anyway, enough about last night. I need copious amounts of coffee and hangover potion. Your finest, good sir! Chop, chop.” He clapped his hands in an attempt to steer the conversation to literally anything else.
“I was thinking... indefinitely,” Blaise said, shrugging. “As I said, I love it here. It would be a much, much easier decision if you said yes.”
He was so exhausted when he got back home he didn’t even have the energy to feel bitter about returning to an empty flat. He collapsed in a heap on the bed, glasses and clothes still on, falling asleep almost immediately.
“Can’t imagine why,” Harry said innocently, shoving Malfoy’s shoulder and receiving a glare in return. “Look, it’s only weird if you make it weird. Just be…
Appearing to sense this, Malfoy busied himself with studying the book in Harry’s hands. “Mm, I can be quite startling. Any good recipes for cake in there? I think I’ve perfected my tres leches. Literally no room for improvement. Might as well add to the roster.”
Draco doesn’t respond immediately, instead, he crosses over to the window and peers out into the expanse. The two men stand together silently, fingers barely touching, hearts beating in their ears.
The ceremony was beautiful and understated, going off without a hitch. At the reception, seated at the Head Table, Harry prepared to give his speech. He stood and surveyed the crowd, gazing fondly at the familiar faces. He looked at Ron and Hermione, who were offering encouraging smiles in between looking lovingly at each other, and his heart swelled.
Blaise, wise enough at least to admit defeat, watched wordlessly as Draco got up, dressed, and gathered his belongings. When Draco went to the doorway, travel bag in hand, Blaise halfheartedly attempted to stop him, placing a hand on either side of his head.
“Isn’t this great, Draco?” Harry asked, bubbling over with the energy and zeal of a bridesman who’d had too much sugar, champagne, and excitement for one afternoon. “What do you think about something like this?”
who’s ever disliked you. I’m sure there are plenty more who couldn’t make it.” Harry grinned as Draco made a rude gesture at him.
“Oh too right, and what a disaster that was! Do you remember when we tried to have sex at the Manor over break? Traumatizing, to say the least. I’m not sure how we managed to recover from that one.”
“You know, I think I very nearly had a nice time with Malfoy last night. I know he doesn’t want to become just another Ministry drone, but his Arithmancy skills are something to be rivaled. He could really help the Curse Breakers uncover a lot of new research with some of those theorems,” Hermione said warmly, blowing into her coffee mug. She gave Harry a little nudge with her shoulder.
Judging from the lack of sting this question begets, Harry thinks he must be over it. He and Ginny wouldn’t have worked; he’s known it all along if he’s honest. “I wouldn’t know,” is all he offers, and Draco seems to get his meaning.
“I think maybe you should leave then, Draco. I know you don’t want to be here anyway.” Harry’s voice came icy and firm, though his insides felt shaky.
Sauntering through the archway looking sheepish is one Draco Malfoy, holding a basket of citrus fruit, and looking devastatingly handsome.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. I don’t want to see you kissing or hugging, so please tell your boyfriend to stay away from me.
Normal. He wasn’t normal. No. No. No. Harry started shaking, it was hard to breathe. Tears were streaming down his face. Not this again. He needed Draco. He wanted it to end. Where were the grey eyes?
Draco stopped and looked into Harry’s eyes. They were so close, holding hands, looking each other in the eyes. A pair of grey-blue ones, a pair of green ones. The green eyes were filling up with bitter tears. Salty droplets were rolling down Harry’s cheeks, burning his skin. Draco wiped the tears off with his hand and started speaking softly.
- I, uhh.. Sixth year? I don’t know, maybe earlier. I always felt a bit different but at first I thought it was how being a pureblood felt like. Eventually I realised I was just gay.- He let out a small chuckle at the end.
- No, no, no. It’s not you. - Harry breathed out heavily. - Professor Snape was killed here, right in front of me.
Harry tightened his grip around Malfoy’s hand and entered the house, without saying anything. It was hard for him to be here after everything that happened. He gulped and squeezed Draco’s hand tighter. Awful flashbacks were flooding his mind, making it impossible for Harry to think straight. The only thing holding him from falling to the floor and starting crying was Malfoy’s cold hand.
They were both sitting on the wooden floor of the balcony, now. Malfoy was leaning against the metal fence and Harry’s was sitting on the opposite side of the small space, leaning against the old wall. Chilly breeze was tangling their hair, making it messier than it already was.
Thinking would be so much better if he had Draco next to him. The blonde always calmed him and made him feel safe. Malfoy always was there for Harry when he had those weird shaking moments. Wait, did he like Draco? Noo, that is… impossible. That was friendship he was feeling. Yeah, definitely friendship. Just a good platonic bond. Better sleep or he would decide he is attracted to Ron.
The girl hugged him causing Draco to feel relieved. He still wasn’t quite sure if he could trust Hermione completely but he felt her supportiveness. She felt like an older sister or a best friend he never had. How could have school turned out if he was friends with Granger from the start? Would there be happy memories and funny stories? He wished he could start all over again.
“Where did that come from? Did I miss something? Oh no, we probably had a fight but I just had a blackout at that time.” - Harry thought.
- A peacock. It’s probably because the Malfoy manor - Malfoy pronounced the name of the house in a sarcastic tone. - was surrounded by them while I was growing up. Lucius had them brought there by a plane from some warm country, don’t remember the name.
He guarded Harry all night, changing the towel, making sure it was cold. Only at sunrise, Draco fell asleep, still holding Harry’s hand. He was still worried about Potter in his sleep, hoping he would get better.
- What a shame, it would be interesting to know. Next question. What was the best phrase you overheard?
- Uhh, snow. I’m always happy when it’s snowing. I feel peaceful when everything is covered in snow.
They walked out of the club to the fresh air. It was a bit cold for an April night. There were no leaves yet, and no signs of spring. It was a weird kind weather. Not a wintery one, not a spring one.
Draco sat down on the little metal fence that was surrounding the balcony. His legs were hanging over it, he shifted his weight onto his hands that were clinging to the black fence. Malfoy reached for his pocket, taking out a cigarette and lit it up with his wand. He inhaled and breathed out the smoke. The action looked so peaceful, calm somehow.
Harry looked in the mirror for the first time after leaving his room. The hoodie on him was dark green with a big ’S’
Ron said it like it was okay but Harry had never seen Neville like that. How much has changed since the last time he was living consciously and actually understanding what was happening around him. Without Draco he would have still been like that. Luckily, everything has changed after that time when he was sick. Harry started feeling alive again, like he was not just a ghost in Harry Potter’s body. How relieving it was to be living again.
yes, I used the band name from IANOWT but what would trendy/punk/gay Draco listen to, if not this? Anyway, if you are not okay with that just tell me in the comments ;)
Potter was almost unconscious, his face red, body shaking rapidly. Hermione touched his forehead and after a few seconds declared that Harry had a cold, maybe the flu.
Harry woke up a few hours after. He was feeling much better than the night before, though he didn’t remember much. He found Malfoy sitting on the floor, holding his hand, half asleep. Draco snapped out of his sleepy trance as soon as Harry moved.
Malfoy was doing some weird moves, his eyes closed, feet stomping to the rhythm of the songs, hands up in the air. But other people weren’t looking strangely at him, they kind of did the same thing. Harry tried closing his eyes and moving his arms. Actually, it felt good. Yeah, he was enjoying it as much as Malfoy.
It smelled nice in the library. Like book pages and tea. Today was even better, it was raining! Rain was always Malfoy's favorite weather. The rhythmic sounds of droplets hitting the window, both chaotic and peaceful at the same time. It was like the end of the world, nobody on the streets, the sky looking grey and depressing. The air was pure and clean, it smelled fresh. Draco buried himself in a comfy armchair and started reading a book.
Hermione gave Draco a neatly folded pile of clothes and waited for him, while he was changing in the bathroom.
An idea popped in his head. He quickly cast a patronus (a beautiful peacock) and sent it to Granger. The girl came after a few minutes, she was dressed in grey sweatpants and a hoodie. Her hair was in a messy bun and she looked like she was awakened from her sleep.
She sighed. Ron wasn’t very good with changes. It wasn’t easy for him to understand the eight year concept, where there was no separate houses and Ron was sharing a dorm with a Hufelpuff and a Slytherin. It wouldn’t be any easier for him to understand now.
- A movie! It’s like a moving picture but a very long one and there are different characters and scenes and they all are talking. We should go see one, in the summer.
Harry nodded and looked into Malfoy’s grey-blue eyes. He was trying to focus only on Draco and forget about everything else. It was hard but Harry knew it would help him.
Ron nodded. He didn’t actually know what happened to Harry after that day he saw Malfoy and his best friend holding hands. He kind of distanced himself from Harry since then. The thought of his enemy dating his friend weirded him out. It was… wrong? Yeah, wrong.
- Oh no, I did nothing. It was all Draco, he was here with you all night and came up with the wet towels idea, he took really good care of you. He is in his room if you want to see him, though he is probably sleeping and you need to stay in bed.
They sat like this for a while, Draco saying calming words and Harry softly sobbing into his shoulder. When Potter pulled back from the hug Malfoy was ready for anything but not Potter’s red eyes. They were full of pain and sadness, it was awful seeing him like this.
Harry came closer to him. He sat down on the wooden floor of the balcony, watching Draco’s movements. They were repetitive. Breathing in and breathing out, producing light clouds of smoke, over and over again. Harry didn’t mind it, though. They sat in silence for a while and then, the scarred boy started speaking.
- Oh god, I’m so sorry, it must be awful to be here. - Draco puled Harry in a tight hug. - Do you want to leave?
‘What the hell?’- Malfoy thought - ‘eight years she hadn’t gone to a drugstore and now was the best time she picked?’
Draco noticed something else laying next to Harry on the floor. It was a little knife, the one muggles use to sharpen their pencils. He took it and put it in his back pocket. No, Draco couldn’t let Harry hurt himself. Malfoy wanted to scream at Potter for being so stupid and thinking the sharp object could help him somehow but Draco knew that it would only make things worse.
Draco didn’t like the silence. Was he being judged? Made fun of? He was so stupid to say what he said. “She now probably thinks I’m a moron or crazy.”- he thought.
He was wearing a black t-shirt, a jean jacket covered with pin badges and patches, wide jeans (he heard they had a funny name in the muggle world - mom jeans), and socks with little monsters on them. Yeah, Draco liked it, it was perfect.
- That’s Neville, don’t mind him, he’s just been studying too much lately and that is how he usually falls asleep.
This year winter was very cold. It was always freezing outside, though it didn’t snow once. It didn’t snow on Christmas, it didn’t snow on New Year’s Eve. Not once a snowflake fell from the sky. It did rain, though but it wasn’t the same. Rain felt cold and painful for Harry and snow felt happy and comforting.
Hermione and Ron came as soon as they woke up. They entered the room, seeing both of the boys asleep, Harry clinging to Draco’s hand. Hermione smiled at them and put her hand on Ron’s shoulder, telling him they should leave.
Malfoy hesitated a bit and then started talking, he looked uncomfortable while he was speaking and Hermione tried to stop him but he continued.
Draco nodded, he was already sitting on the floor next to Harry’s bed. He couldn’t bear seeing him suffer so much. Suddenly he remembered something his mother always did for him, when he was sick. Draco casted towel and a glass of cold water, soaking the cloth in the liquid. He put the towel on Harry’s head, making sure it wouldn’t disturb him. Just as Malfoy had finished, Harry let out a quiet cry.
- I have a scar on my right knee, I got it because I really wanted a pine cone, that I saw  in the forest but I tripped and fell, tearing off half my knee.
Malfoy screamed and jumped up a bit. His right ear was red but still on its place. He ran to the mirror in his bathroom and was quite satisfied with the way he looked like. The earring looked very stylish with his trendy haircut and simple black t-shirt completed the look.
Harry was again in Malfoy’s arms, still breathing unevenly from the crying. Draco looked around. It seems like Potter was really trying to study, before he came.
He opened the door and peeked out. Then, he fully entered the room. He was wearing a white shirt with two first buttons undone, a black tie hanging loose around his neck, and a pair of black trousers. He spun around to give Granger a full look.
At some point he gave up and started sleeping on the floor, going out of his room only to poke the food at the great hall. He didn’t want to do that but usually Hermione would barge in every morning and take him there by force.
“Not as such,” Harry answers truthfully. He’d actually planned on staying at the castle over break, catching up on all of the grading he could never seem to get ahead of.
” Pansy was so drunk she could barely keep a straight face, devolving into a fit of giggles. Eventually, Draco joined her, taking the wine glass from her hand and downing the rest.
“If you say ‘I’m sorry’ I will murder you on the spot. You don’t get to say it. I know you’re not.” Blaise was so intentional, deliberate and discriminating with his words and actions. Draco couldn’t bear to see him lie. “And neither am I.”
Grief was an interesting thing, he thought, drawing parallels between confident Draco and grieving Draco, alike and dissimilar at once. He could see the battle between caring too much and not at all waging war across his features, though this wasn’t something new - just different.
“No! No, of course not. At least not at first,” Harry’s expression softened. “At first I loved her intensity and her fire and her willfulness but after a while, we butted heads over everything. It got to the point where we could hardly make a decision about anything together. You’d be amazed at the things we could fight about. And if we weren’t bickering then she’d be gone touring, and I was tired of waiting around for her. We’d just been through so much together, and I love the Weasleys; they’re my family.” Harry felt sad, recognizing for the first time that maybe things had been over with Ginny longer than he realized. But with the passing of time, he supposed it didn’t hurt as much now to think about it.
“Merlin, Potter, what’s happened to your eye? You look a wreck. Is everything alright?” Draco asked, startled by Harry’s appearance. He hadn’t had time to grab any bruise removal paste and knew a black eye was blooming spectacularly where Blaise had punched him two days ago.
“This means if you’ll have me, I’ll never leave you again. I’m yours, forever - whatever you want that to mean.”
Today, escaping the rain and still processing his feelings about Ron and Hermione’s engagement, he found solace in the pages of an old muggle cookbook. He thumbed through the pages, imagining that these might have been some of the dishes his mother grew up on. Nostalgia, bitter and tender at once, licked at his heart and mind like waves. He couldn’t help imagining what his life could have been at times like this; maybe his emotions wouldn’t run so hot and ruthless if he’d had someone to talk to growing up, or even now.
“Do you love it too?” Blaise asked, sincerely. He stopped and turned to face Draco. “Could you see yourself here?”
“Sure you are,” Draco snarled half-heartedly. He was glad to be with Blaise, however awkward the initial encounter. “You know, if my colleagues looked like that, I’d probably have them back to mine as well.”
“I suppose I could do,” Draco said coolly. “Are you sure that would be… acceptable?” Harry shook his head in response.
Pansy was unfazed. “That I am. Do you have one of those buttons laying around, like you made in fourth year? We can transfigure it to say ‘Pansy Stinks.’ Shouldn’t be much of a challenge for a skilled wizard such as yourself.”
“Hear, hear,” Harry whispered back. Ron didn’t have to love Draco, he just needed to tolerate the fact they were sort-of friends.
Truthfully, Harry hadn’t entirely thought they’d been flirting. He’d seen Magnus once or twice at the Ministry and they’d chatted about the most recent Doxy outbreak. It seemed harmless enough. Though he did suppose Magnus had asked about Harry’s romantic status, and if he was interested in getting a drink next weekend. Merlin, but he was thick sometimes; the entirety of their conversation Harry had wanted to get back over to Draco to tell him something he’d just thought of.
“Ah yes, well my gown’s being cleaned so I didn’t have the chance to wear it out tonight. Don’t try to hide your disappointment, I can see it in your face,” Malfoy deadpanned.
“I wasn’t aware you were the gatekeeper of my thoughts,” Draco interrupts. “And while you may have given your royal pardon, Potter, maybe the rest of the world isn’t so keen to see me as anything more than a death eater disgrace. It will be even worse for my father, and you’re a fool if you think otherwise. We’ll be lucky if anyone decides they even want to touch our case.”
been painful for him. But he’s always known loving Draco meant challenging what he thought he’d wanted, defying ideals, and following gut feelings. True, he
As for Harry, he took his time walking home, leisurely wandering the cobblestone streets and letting his mind wander. He felt mad with frustration that Malfoy had been dancing around the idea of having a boyfriend the entire night. And not only that but sharing a flat together. It felt strangely like he was being led on, but admittedly he’d been out of the game awhile. Reminding himself that this was Malfoy and not some bloke at the pub, Harry decided he was just letting his emotions get the better of him. Additionally, he decided it was for the best not to owl. It was probably pushing his luck to imagine the two of them could be civil to each other for more than one night.
“Draco, I er, went to Portugal. To see you. I talked to Blaise and er, that’s how I managed to get this,” he pointed to his eye as he studied it on the back of a spoon. It had indeed morphed into an awful blueish-purplish-yellowish shade.
“I would never sleep with someone else,” Harry mutters, undone by this simple act of affection. “I would never do that. It would never make me feel better. Why do you have to be such a bastard?”
Harry can see the Mark, now surrounded by something which looks like runes and flora in the low light. He can also see that the Mark is now a part of a larger piece that continues up Malfoy’s arm. Harry wants to pull him closer, to examine, but something tells him to respect whatever sort of boundary might exist there. Malfoy takes his arm back quickly and rubs at his wrist.
“Look, I’m sorry. It’s not like I went there trying to break you up… I don’t know what I was hoping to achieve. I just- Draco, I just like you. That’s all it is, and I just didn’t want to wait to tell you. I didn’t want you to waste your time anymore.”
They spent the afternoon on the Carcavelos beach, laying in the sand and leisurely sipping on Sparkling and Port. Tipsy from the drink and sun and unable to apparate, they rode the train back to the city center.
“I should hex your bollocks off. How dare you show up here looking like a lost crup, asking about him. Your arrogance clearly knows no bounds. I know what you’re after, Potter, and you don’t deserve him.” Blaise narrowed his eyes, sounding dangerous and disdainful.
“You can’t say you didn’t know what you were getting into.” Draco leans in to kiss him, and Harry pulls back.
“It’s nothing really,” he mutters, busying himself with the sleeve of Draco’s holiday jumper: Green with silver snitches. “I do like you at Christmastime,” he teases.
“I can’t believe I’m doing this. In what universe should I let Harry Potter drag me to a pub night with everyone that has ever disliked me in my entire life?” Draco demanded, though continuing to walk at a rather brisk pace towards said pub.
It’s so rare to find that one person you can truly be yourself with, the person who challenges you without making you feel less than, the person who compliments you and you never question the sincerity. When you know it’s right like we all do with Ron and Hermione, then you never give up. So cheers to Ron and Hermione, and never giving up!”
They watched the guests begin to trickle in, wandering about the grounds of the Burrow and chatting, deciding they’d better head upstairs to get ready.
Harry found himself having a wonderful time, in spite of the run-in with Ginny. He ended the night by playing a drinking game with Seamus, Dean, Neville, Draco, and Luna. Neville surprised them all by drinking them under the table; Harry noticed Draco staring at him with something akin to reverence as he knocked back what seemed like his tenth ale. Before that, Harry had even exchanged numbers with a bloke from work.
“No, P- Harry, I think I’ve always loved you. I’m sorry I didn’t tell you. Those nights at the party, the pub, the beach, they just confirmed it. I’ve never wanted anything so much in my entire life, but I never thought it was possible.” Draco overwhelmed with the intensity of his sentiment, closed his eyes and rested his forehead against Harry’s. When he opened his eyes, Harry’s own were misty with tears which threatened to spill.
Steeling himself, he opened the door to the flat and was immediately bombarded by laughter and horrible 80’s dance music. Typical Luna. He scanned the room for his friends, recognizing a few faces here and there, but mostly finding strangers.
Draco looked at Harry square in the face. “I’m just going to come out and say it, Potter, I’m trying to understand your attraction to the Weaselette. Because at this moment in time, I do not.”
“Mm. I’m truly at my best at Yuletide,” Draco agrees, briefly allowing this feeble attempt at a deflection. He reaches for Harry, carding his fingers through messy black hair.“But just so you know… I think about my family too. Especially at night. Especially when it’s quiet.” He plants a soft kiss on Harry’s forehead.
“Malfoy, I have to ask, when did you and Luna come to be such good friends? I sort of figured she might not want much to do with you after…” Harry paused, choosing his words carefully as to not upset the delicate balance they’d found this night. He was genuinely curious, and Luna hadn’t mentioned their friendship at all. Or maybe he’d just been too busy hiding from the world to take notice.
“I think you’re upset because I’m not acting jealous,” Draco says seriously, folding the paper and standing.
Harry allows the tears to escape from his eyes then, letting Draco wipe them away and hold him. He would wait forever if Draco needed him to, he realizes. He just hopes he doesn’t have to wait that long.
“I suppose I’d better brush up on my Portuguese then,” he conceded finally, attempting a small smile.
“My father is… he’s not well.” Draco’s voice is raspy, pain evident in his face. His arms are hugged tight around his knees.
Grateful for Malfoy’s ability to make a conversation solely about himself, Harry smiled. “I’m sure it’s just after the section devoted to Jelly moulds.”
“We wake up every morning not knowing what the day might hold for us, what we might lose and what we might gain. But if everyday, we take a chance on someone or something we really love, we need never fear for the future.
“You’re not so complicated, Potter. You could compliment someone beautifully if they gave you the chance. If nothing else, you’re devoted; I’ve seen it our whole lives. I think… people treat you like you’re fragile. You need someone to trust that you won’t break if you hear the truth.” Draco had moved closer now too.
“Just please don’t tell anyone,” Draco pleads. “I’m not ready to talk about this. I’m not sure I know how.”
“I don’t understand,” Harry uttered. “I sort of thought that was where we were headed. It’s been four years.”
Harry can admit, begrudgingly, Draco is right on some level. He never meant Draco to hear his conversation with Ron and Hermione, and it
“I’m sorry, love. I’ve just been thinking about how to talk with you about this, and I haven’t been able to find the right time. It’s leaving me a bit of a mess, you understand.” Blaise looked worried, and Draco suddenly felt like all of his nerve endings were frayed and buzzing.
As Draco’s movements become more erratic, he reaches down, stroking Harry to release and finding it himself. They lay together in the aftermath, something less common of late, sleepily exploring each other’s bodies and lips.
gone over this so many times. I’ve told you, if I’ve been unhappy it’s because of anything but you.” He steels himself and plows forward. “Listen, I’ve been debating leaving the Ministry; they’ve offered me a position at Hogwarts.”
Blaise paused for a moment, studying the other man. Harry, recognizing the absurdity of the situation for possibly the first time, attempted to avoid his eyes.
Moving slowly, Draco slid further into Harry until he was fully sheathed. Arousal burned hot in his belly, and he knew he wouldn’t last long. Beginning to pick up the pace, Draco moved Harry’s legs to his hips and buried his head in Harry’s neck and hair.
“And with all of this going on, when precisely did you discover that you were attracted to men?” Draco asked, examining his fingernails.
Harry and Draco had been sitting in the sand, propped against a log for the last thirty minutes or so. This was at Harry’s behest, believing an impromptu visit to the sea was a cure-all. With Blaise being gone for the last month, Harry took it upon himself to occupy Draco’s time and keep him cheerful. As cheerful as Malfoys could be, anyway. This particular evening they’d found an apparition point close to Westcliff, finding it mostly empty. They’d cast a warming charm over themselves, avoiding the chill as evening settled in around them.
“Six months. That long, really?” Draco heard himself say, sadly. He wasn’t certain how to feel, and doubt pulled at the corner of his mind like a thread ready to unravel. Draco knew Blaise loved his job, and could hardly begrudge him the opportunity, but six months seemed an eternity. Anxiety burned brightly in his chest as he fought off the urge to make a desperate plea for Blaise to stay. He searched the other man’s face for any indication of doubt but came up short. Instead, he was met with a sweet, hopeful look in his lover’s almond eyes.
“What are you talking about? They haven’t even done toasts yet. I was-” Draco was silenced with a burning look from Harry. He stood up and straightened his collar. “Very well, if you’re certain. Give Luna my best then.”
Stifling a small smile, Draco looks at him over the top of the paper. “Unfortunately, no,” he says tightly. “I’ll be sure to keep an eye out though.”
Draco had been nervous and edgy in the weeks beforehand, and Harry had chalked it up to the nerves of yet another wedding in their circle of friends.
After breaking apart and managing to clean themselves up a bit, Draco stared appreciatively at Harry’s naked form as he emerged from the washroom. “I had always wondered what Harry Potter’s magic cock would be like. It doesn’t disappoint,” he said hungrily.
Harry’s panting echoed in the stairwell as he climbed up towards Draco’s flat. His heart beating fast, he felt unsure of what he planned to say, but knew he had to say
“Ah, of course it’s Malfoy,” Magnus had sighed. “He’s an awful prat, you know. But I’ve seen you two together, there’s clearly something there. I guess I should have known better to get my hopes up,” he said ruefully.
“I’m sure they’re fascinated with her plans for the future of elvish welfare,” he laughed. Feeling brave, he continued on with: “What do you think about something like this… for us?”
Watching the sunset on the beach was Harry’s absolute favorite thing. Draco was a bit fidgety, repeatedly shaking the sand from his boots, but eventually admitted he too enjoyed the scenery.
Harry took a moment to think, attempting to look past the insensitivity of it all. He searched the empty beach as if looking to say to someone,
Draco laughed gingerly. “Potter, you are possibly the most infuriating person I’ve ever met on this earth, but I’ll be damned if I don’t think about you every second of every day.”
The boy squeaks his thanks as he bounces out of the door and relays the message of admittance to the person in the hallway.
“What’s that, love?” Blaise had returned, poised like a hunter on the prowl. He hugged the side of the doorway, his lean frame elongated by the pose. Draco was absolutely seething at the sight of him like this, so casual and non-chalant, as if he hadn’t just been washing off the scent of a gorgeous Portuguese woman.
“Did you? Would that have made you feel better?” Draco queries. He doesn’t seem quite upset, but he also doesn’t bother to get up.
longed for a family in the traditional sense, but his world makes sense with Draco. He can’t imagine it any other way.
With time, it also becomes clear that Harry is a natural, and he falls into an easy rhythm with his classes. It seems he’s well-liked by both students and staff, and by the time fall term comes to a close, he receives more Christmas cards than he’s ever gotten in his life. He reads them over with a swelling, swooping pride that nestles into his chest and purrs. He’s managed to figure out life on his own as well, though he often feels a pang and a pull towards his “old life.”
Harry knows what it is to have a complicated relationship with a father; his own had proven to him that people could behave in shades of gray and still be good. Lucius, of course, had gone beyond the realm of gray behaviour, but he’d tried to do the right thing in the end.
Potter, what are you even saying, that you felt obligated to be together?” Draco pressed. Apparently he cared more about the breakup than he let on.
Blaise took a breath. “I’ve got a business opportunity in Portugal. I’ve been working with a team there on international magical law, ironing out some of the kinks. It could be great for me, for us… But it’s six months.” Blaise practically lit up talking about this new prospect.
“I’m ready, love,” he breathes and pulls Draco up to meet him, pressing their foreheads together as Draco sheaths himself with a moan. Tears form at the corners of Draco’s eyes, and he wipes them away, whispering comfort.
Pansy attempted to hide her giggles at first but then broke out into a peal of full-on laughter. “Look at you, babes, two men fighting for your honor. Or lack thereof!”
Blaise Zabini answered the door looking fit and sleek; his suit tailored perfectly, his umber skin even more sun-kissed than usual. Jesus, but Harry was envious. Blaise was beautiful and composed. He was a stark contrast to everything Harry was, particularly at this moment.
“Is that a challenge, Potter?” Draco growled, pulling Harry down onto the bed with him and furiously claiming his mouth.
The worst bit of all is that this feels like a call back to his time with the Dursleys. Harry swore he would never allow himself to be painted as a burden again, and he never expected Draco to be a catalyst for these feelings.
“You know what I want,” Harry whispered headily, dragging him up for a kiss. “I want you to fuck me, Draco,” he growled against Malfoy’s lips. “I want to be yours.”
His fingers found a picture of one October years ago, fingerprints marring the perfect gloss of the photo - and that was fitting wasn’t it? That was their beginning, all tentative kisses and tangled limbs. Recollections of learning curves, raw nerves, and whispered half-apologies overwhelmed his senses. It all seemed worth fighting for then. And wasn’t it still, even now that the veneer had worn off, the shine dulled with age?
“I’m just telling you that as a man who’s spent time in the presence of a woman romantically, I don’t understand why you were together for so long. It’s not as though she oozes feminine mystique.”
“It means that he was staring at you the whole time you were flirting with Magnus Savio. He was jealous.” Hermione grinned sheepishly. “You can’t say you didn’t notice.”
“You seem back to your old self, Harry,” she said airily. She rested a gentle hand on his shoulder, admiring their work.
“Don’t you remember, Draco? Don’t you remember anything - any of this? Look at all of these pictures. I can’t stop looking at them.” Harry feels a fresh resurgence of tears he was sure were long gone, and he feels quite literally insane.
“Good morning to you too,” Harry half-laughs, fighting back the fear that this will undoubtedly turn everything on its head.
“I’m asking you to think about it. I’m asking you, broken man to broken man, to wait and see if I can put myself back together. Please.”
Ah, this Harry could tolerate; at least he and Ron spoke the same language when it came to fisticuffs. Insult me once? Shame on you. Insult me many times over seven years, and not speak to me for nearly seven years after that? It’s on sight.
Savio had seen through it though and questioned Harry before leaving. Harry attempted every excuse in the book before sighing exasperatedly and telling him there was someone else.
“Right. So this is what you do for fun? You come to muggle concerts hoping no one recognizes you, judging people for some light recreational drug use, wearing... leather trousers? Malfoy, you’re wearing leather trousers.” Harry laughs at this, eyes wide and roving over Draco’s body. Honestly, he looks quite fit, and it makes Harry laugh harder. He has to fight the urge to reach out and touch them.
A raw pang of empathy courses through Harry, though he isn’t quite sure what to say. Torn between strange relief and indignation, Harry fights the desire to ask why Draco hadn’t come to him sooner, why he’d pushed him away. But he remembers all too well what it is to feel helpless, waiting for the right time, waiting while the people you care for suffer. Harry considers what
“Nobody likes to, Potter. But can’t you understand where I’m coming from at all? I don’t want the sort of… debt that comes with belonging to someone. And I never thought I’d be spending my life with you, of all people.”
?” Draco was talking fast, gesturing at the grand floral displays, faerie lights, and candles. Harry thought it was beautiful and whimsical, though perhaps not his own taste. Moreover, he recognized the importance of this day and the commitment that Luna and Rolf were making to one another. He’d always thought… He supposed it didn’t matter what he’d always thought if Draco wasn’t of the same mind.
“What in the blazes is a Jelly mould?” Malfoy sounded genuinely alarmed, and Harry couldn’t help but laugh.
Draco flushed slightly at this. Taking a glance around, Harry realized he did quite like how the flat had been decorated; the wallpaper that hung in the kitchen was a deep blue baroque pattern with golden stars and moons, the furniture an eclectic mix of mid-century and lived-in comfort. It was, well, nice. Harry looked up at Draco.
Luna had asked Harry to be her Man of Honor, a title which he’d enthusiastically accepted and secretly thrilled over. Though he’d offered to wear a flower crown like the other bridesmaids, Luna had crafted him a long garland of asters, edelweiss, and myrtle to wear over his shoulders. It was perfect.
“Pansy, any decent wizard can stay warm on a cold beach, use your head. It was nice, quiet. I was… with Potter. Everything’s fine,” he said carefully. He was feeling more awake now Pansy had yelled in his ear.
When Harry arrives home, it is pouring. He doesn’t bother taking the Floo, opting for a more dramatic, traditional entrance. Draco is sitting on the sofa reading the Daily Prophet. He doesn’t look up when he hears the door slam.
“Christ, Potter, there’s plenty of time for that later. I’m fairly certain we didn’t come here just to
” Malfoy admits, though sounding slightly amused. “But it seems you’re without your usual entourage. Where’s the Weaslette?”
They’ve kissed too many times to count. In stairwells and bathrooms, under street lamps, and in pubs. Harry thinks he may have kissed Draco on every visible stretch of his skin, covering him like a fever. But this, this feels different. They’ve never done it like this - never in a bedroom, never so nervously and tenderly. Their hands are moving slowly, their eyes are closed, and Harry’s heartbeat hammers loud in time to the small noises they’re making.
“Oh. Er.” Harry debated for a moment whether or not he should tell the truth. Malfoy had really done nothing to earn his trust, and frankly, he was annoyed at this intrusion. “Ron and Hermione got engaged. That’s where they were, actually, the night of Luna’s party. That’s what they were… doing,” Harry heard himself say against his better judgment.
“You’re nervous,” he says, blinking. “You shouldn’t be. You’re Harry Potter, you can do anything you want.”
“Draco, I…” It was all Harry could do to keep from telling the other man everything. He sat there, fighting every impulse in his body, desperate to tell Draco that maybe he wasn’t really attracted to men in general, it was mostly just
“Look, it’s not that it’s not a lovely idea. I’m just not sure that I’ve ever seen myself as someone who gets married. To anyone. Isn’t our being together enough? Can’t we be committed to each other without all of
“I don’t actually,” Draco interjected. “Have Blaise, I mean. He was sleeping with one of his colleagues. And he’s staying in Portugal, so there’s that.”
“Well, that’s inspiring me to… not do that,” Malfoy grimaced. “But I don’t really care for parties either. You must be shocked, paragon of charm that I am.”
He sorted through stacks of photographs and trinkets, each of them a vision of what no longer was. Tired eyes watched as younger versions of himself waved happily up at him. He attempted a feeble smile back, wishing desperately to be back in that little cottage in Cornwall, or flying above lavender fields in Hampshire.
“Draco. I don’t think it’s a matter of one or the other. You can be here when you’re ready, but it’s okay if you’re not. You have to give this the attention it deserves.” Harry wants to stop the world for him, wants to be a rock for him to cling to. But rocks can be slippery, and he knows Draco still sometimes sees the danger in reliance, in trust. Harry grabs his arms, holding him steady, telling him silently he’s not going anywhere.
Harry surveyed the room once more. His heart practically stopped when he realized that standing near the back of the tent was Draco Malfoy, looking solemn and nervous. Pulse ringing in his ears, he continued.
Draco looked down at their adjoined hands, and thoughtfully studied Harry’s; his tan skin was callused and a bit rough, Draco’s own pale and well-maintained. He smiled at the contrast. He also suddenly realized this was a rather tender moment, and couldn’t decide whether or not to let go. He decided against it and continued to sit in silence until he noticed Harry was nodding off.
more than friends. More acknowledgment that this had been a long time coming, forever in the making.The kiss was so intimate and unhurried, it felt like they had been doing this forever. It was too much.
Just then, Luna swept into the room, interrupting Harry’s conversation with himself. “Oh you found each other!” she exclaimed.
The night before last, he’d agreed to get a drink with Magnus, which led to some heavy petting on the couch, and ultimately a belly full of guilt for Harry. The entirety of the night, he thought of Draco, and what he would do if word floated back to him at the Ministry. He nearly felt ill, and attempted to send Magnus on his way before things went too far.
“It doesn’t matter if you did. It’s my own fault I hadn’t thought about how things might be for your family. We don’t really talk about them, and it’s not an excuse, I just… I hope you’ll let me be a part of this. I’ll make sure the healers, or alchemists, or whoever it is we’re working with are fair. I’ll make sure we can trust them.
Harry couldn’t deny he was overcompensating for the ever-so-slight sinking feeling in his chest. He was excited and happy for them, honestly… but he couldn’t help feeling this was the end of an era. A true marker of adulthood, and one he couldn’t say he was ready for himself.
Harry works his way down Draco’s chest, slipping fingers into belt loops, stopping to plant gentle kisses on his face. And now it’s almost like being underwater; he’s moving through space slowly, dreamily.
“You realize you were obsessed with him for the better part of the last two decades, right?” Pansy snorted.
“If I’m ‘honest with myself,’ Potter, I want nothing to do with you right now.” And with that, Draco got up, turned on his heel and left the coffee shop. He didn’t look back once. If he had, he would have seen Harry looking miserable and embarrassed, staring at his hands.
“Oh, okay. Er, do you know when he’ll be back?” Harry asked, a jealous feeling threatening to swallow him where he stood.
He looked down at his still-full glass and raised an eyebrow, thankful that nobody could hear his internal dialogue.
“Is there an article in there about what to do when everything is bullshit and your life is a lie?” Harry rages, demanding acknowledgement.
Mrs. Weasley had given Harry the task of arranging the heliotropes, purple tulips, and red chrysanthemums on the tables and in various spots in the garden. He’d enlisted Luna to help, though he’d actually just wanted a chat with her.
Harry grabbed Hermione’s ring hand and studied it in the low restaurant light. It was simple and understated; perfect. He felt his happiness and pride swell, and thought perhaps it wouldn’t be so hard to ignore his feelings, at least for the rest of the night.
“Oh. That. Well it doesn’t seem that important now,” Harry said. He genuinely meant it. Whatever sort of would-be friendship Harry had struck up with Malfoy for one night paled in comparison to this evening’s events.
Luna, Dean, and Seamus are scattered about somewhere, and Harry vaguely wonders if he should look for them. Deciding against it, continuing to swim in the colors and sounds, he makes his way towards a back wall to find purchase. He’s content watching others dance, and sways along himself, feeling only slightly fuzzy.
Draco returns as dusk is settling in, and Harry hasn’t moved from his spot. He’s poured over countless questions and compromises, trying to imagine what his new normal might be like, clinging desperately to the hope that nothing will change. He’s moved past hurt into something more visceral.
Draco used his body to guide Harry back to his bed, never breaking contact, peppering down the side of Harry’s neck and collarbone. Harry, drowsy with arousal, melted back onto the bed without any sort of resistance. Draco took his time, slowly unbuttoning Harry’s shirt, running his hand along the tan skin beneath it. He reached for Harry’s belt, dipping a hand below his waistband, questioning
“That’s not what I-” Harry closed his eyes and rubbed his temples. “Alright. Fine. What are you asking again?”
“Let me have this, please,” he murmured against the sensitive skin on Harry’s neck. Deciding Draco was making a fine argument for himself, Harry lay back and let Draco continue to map his body.
“I- I’ve got to think about it,” Draco acquiesced. He shook his head, remembering the pact to enjoy himself no matter the cost. “Look, we’ll talk about it tomorrow. What I don’t have to think about right now is the fact that I can’t wait to get you upstairs.” He nuzzled into Blaise’s neck, basking in the familiar scent of verbena and breathing deeply.
“I can’t believe I waited this long now it’s over with. It’s the best thing I’ve ever done.” Ron looked proud and patted Hermione’s hand.
“I… did. I actually spent most of the night talking to Draco Malfoy.” Harry could hardly believe the words as he was saying them.
Witnessing the hurt in Harry’s expression, Draco attempted to reach over and take his hand. Without thinking, Harry recoiled and stared at the ground. He wanted to leave himself, but he couldn't do that to Luna - Gryffindor loyalty and all that.
Malfoy scoffed, confirming his suspicions. “Well what do you think is going to happen, Potter? They’re going to be sent off to an island where all the marrieds go, and you’ll never see or speak to them again? I understand you’ve got some abandonment issues, which is a conversation for another time, but it can’t be as bad as all that. At least you like both of them! When Pansy started dating that Mortimer fellow, I thought I might have to give up on that crazy bint, and I’ve known her practically since birth. But now they’re married, and there’s fuck-all I can do about it, so I tolerate him. And I make it a point to spend time with Pansy. Alone. Is anything
“Blaise,” Draco’s voice came as a warning. “What would you do if you were to come to our flat and find an earring underneath the pillow? Do you think you would believe
Draco felt like someone had hit him with a stunning spell. He swayed a little as he sat on the couch, staring into the abyss.
“Of course not! Don’t be stupid,” Draco sneered. Of course, he'd known he’d be going from the moment Potter had asked, but it was far too easy to lie to an intoxicated Pansy Parkinson.
“What’s that now? In all of my days on this earth, I never thought I’d hear those words escape your lips, Potter,” Draco said dramatically, eyes widening in mock-surprise.
“Ah fuck, yes,” Harry hummed, reveling in the rhythm Draco had set, fucking back against Draco’s hard length. Angling his hips up in such a way that Draco felt all of Harry, he began to move erratically, spurred on by Harry’s encouraging noises and purrs.
“Draco, thank you. Thank you so much. I love you. This will be great, so great, for both of us” Blaise said, practically bounding from the settee, obviously thrilled. He bent down and grabbed Draco’s face, planting a firm kiss on his lips. “Now, let’s see about this hangover potion. I’m sure there’s some in the cabinet.” He bustled off to the bathroom.
On this particular night, Draco had joined him at the bottom of the tree. He’d crept downstairs almost silently and sat down at Harry’s side.
“Oh. Right. Er, yeah I could do.” Harry perked up in an attempt to mask his disappointment. “I’ll see you around then, Malfoy. I’m headed that way,” he said, pointing northeast.
“Fuck, I don’t know. Is Draco here?” Harry managed to get out, despite feeling his throat dry up. What
Only Luna could make the fact that he’d been isolating himself due to a damaged ego and failed relationship sound whimsical.
“Are you serious? That bastard! I can’t believe I let that berk land a fucking punch. I could murder him.” Harry looked incredulous and angry, and it was more endearing to Draco than anything he could imagine.
“Malfoy, relax. It’ll be great. We’re all adults. Besides, you’re already friends with Luna, and she’ll be there,” Harry assured, attempting to provide Draco a reason to stay without sounding too desperate.
“Professor Potter? I’m sorry to bother you,” a small voice echoes in the empty classroom. “It’s just, I think there’s someone here to see you.”
His first few weeks as the DADA professor are a little shaky, and he finds he can hardly remember his students’ names, let alone figure out how to best teach them. Thankfully, Neville comes to his rescue often, sharing whatever tricks of the trade he’s learned in his short time as a professor. He’s helped Harry to find his footing again, letting him fall apart when he needs, and putting him back together again when he’s ready. Neville is truly one of the best men and friends Harry will ever know, and he believes this to his core.
Harry could only stare as an older version of Draco Malfoy stood there, clutching his own mug shaped like a small cauldron with tiny human feet, looking him up and down. He looked like himself, Harry decided, but softer and less scrawny. His long silver hair was pulled into a sleek topknot.
“What’s there to say? I came home one afternoon and she had packed up all of her things. She said she couldn’t go on like we were, and it was best if she left. She seems to be doing fine with Paolo now,” Harry said bitterly.
They’ve escaped the city for the weekend together at a cabin on the coast. Draco had mentioned it casually, as though Potter could join him if he liked, or not. Though if Harry is honest, he wants it to be a more serious invitation - he wants Draco to want him there with every fibre of his being. He wants Draco to want like he does. He tries to send this message telepathically, moving with
“Want you,” was all Harry could manage to breathe against Draco’s lips. This seemed to be all of the encouragement Malfoy needed to press on, running his hand over the length of Harry’s hard cock. Harry moaned in response, bucking his hips to get more. His hands tore at Malfoy’s shirt, making short work of the buttons and leaving them pressed chest to chest on top of each other.
“Reparations? Draco, if you’re going to be a healer because you want to help, that’s fine... but because ‘reparations should be made’? You can’t possibly think-”
Harry walked home in a sort of stupor, desperately hoping he hadn’t just seen Draco for the last time. The worst part of it was that Draco thought him a liar. But it was true, he had lied; he didn’t just
“Pansy, I think I’ve fucked up massively.” Draco cradled his head in his hands miserably. He sat down at the kitchen table, out of the way of Pany’s path of levitating glassware. She was there helping him move his belongings out of the shared flat.
“It’s, er, nice enough. Luna looks lovely. The Scamanders are an interesting bunch, Granger seems quite taken with the lot.”
“I’ve been sitting with it a while because it would mean moving, and… I didn’t want to leave you. Don’t want to leave you. You don’t exactly have the happiest memories of the castle.”
Truthfully, Harry was feeling more shocked at the way he and Malfoy had made it through a three-minute conversation without hexing one another.
“Ah, did you hate Portugal too? It was clearly shite.” Harry’s attempt at a joke did nothing to assuage the knots which had quickly formed in his stomach.
Earlier that night he’d sat on the fire escape of his flat, thinking about how stupid it was for him to keep avoiding parties on the off-chance Ginny would be there. It was almost a given she’d be at anything he was invited to, unless she was traveling with the Harpies. It also seemed stupid to still be pining away for someone who clearly had no problem moving on. She’d ended things around a year ago, though it wasn’t a clean break. The aftermath was peppered with various instances of what Harry referred to as “backsliding,” wherein they’d get together for a chat, Harry would beg her to reconsider, and they’d inevitably end up sleeping together.
“Where were you two the other night? I had to go to Luna’s all by myself!” Harry demanded over curry with Ron and Hermione.
They sat in contented silence for a minute until Hermione piped up. “Oh Harry, you were going to tell us about Luna’s party?”
“No! No. I just… I thought you might see that I was serious,” Harry said, trying to keep the desperation out of his voice.
“I know I never say the right thing, but I’ll do everything I can. You’re my family.” This is Harry Potter at his most earnest. He will do anything for this man, and that much he knows.
Once inside, Draco felt rather in awe of the luxurious apartment. He expected nothing less from Blaise of course, but this was incredible. He was used to the manor but had since grown accustomed to the more compact living London afforded him. The apartment was light and airy, with the windows open and city noises wafting in.
“I don’t think you want to hex each other at all,” Hermione said meaningfully. “Quite the opposite really.”
Harry has to stop himself from shuddering as Draco’s words ring in his ears. All he can hear in his voice is Lucius Malfoy - cold, cutting, clear.
