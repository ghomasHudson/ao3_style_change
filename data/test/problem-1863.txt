Harry wanted nothing more than to turn and taste the lips that tortured him so expertly. He'd never wanted anything so badly and yet he simply couldn't make his body move. The touch of those hands on his hips had secured him firmly in place, leaving his desire to burn helplessly within his chest.
"To split one's soul in half..." Faelyn murmured, shaking her head, "It's too much for the soul to bare."
Draco nodded, taking the comment for what it was: a warning.
"That's not-" He made a very loud irritated noise that sounded like a borderline growl. "Why are you still on the Quidditch team?"
," Soren insinuated, shooting Harry a pointed look, "are growing rather impatient. It's imperative that we handle the situation immediately."
The moment he was free of Roland's grip the Scout's body slid to the floor, followed shortly by the torn vocal cords as Roland calmly deposited them. A dangerous clam had fallen over him as the blood from the recent killing dripped down his fingers. It had always been difficult to stop once he'd started. The clam was something he craved and, at the same time, something he loathed. He needed it to keep him sane, but he hated the dependency.
"Quiet, Ron!" Harry hissed. There was a low hum reverberating through the corridor. "Can you not hear that?"
After blocking the third halfhearted swing of his opponent's sword, Harry stepped back with a frustrated sigh. They were supposed to be working on their defenses, but there was no point when the offence was almost non-existent. "This isn't working!" he complained, turning his glare at Ilaria.
"Did they brainwash Dumbledore too?" she asked dryly, setting the letter back down on the table. While it was definitely concerning that Harry was with Malfoy, she was pretty sure there had to be a reasonable explanation. Was this something to do with the Elves? Did Malfoy have Elf blood as well? "Besides, what purpose would it serve to make Harry think he was an Elf? If Voldemort had a hold of Harry, I doubt he'd just let him stroll back into Hogwarts"
"Well," she sighed, gathering up her papers with a resigned look, "I suggest that you prepare yourselves. This is going to be a long and difficult night. I shall need all of your strength."
Beside him, Draco's gaze shifted to pin Potter with a calculating look.
"I'll send them immediately."
Harry felt, despite the very clear dismissal, that he should apologize again. His mouth opened in an attempt but Soren had already turned from him in order to return the Royal History to its rightful place. It was clear by the rigid posture of the Elf that an apology would fall on deaf ears. Keeping his mouth firmly shut, Harry stood and made a beeline for the door. The last thing he wanted was to upset the High Lord more than he already had.
Draco just blinked at him like he'd lost his mind. Lothair, however, had a thoughtful look on his face.
Harry frowned at that. He knew well how he felt about Malfoy no longer being a part of his life, but could he happily deal with the Slytherin's unhappiness in order to ensure he did not perish. Was having Malfoy in this world more important than the fact that Harry might face his wrath? The answer was simple. Yes. If it meant having Malfoy forever despise him for what he'd done, Harry would accept that without question. Hating him was Draco's right. At least he would be alive in his hate.
Glancing away from each other, murder still flashing in their eyes, they found the only person such sarcasm could belong to besides, Draco, himself. Lothair stood, arms crossed and looking at them with about as much disdain as Harry was currently feeling toward both of the elves currently occupying the same piece of corridor he was.
Draco didn't comment but surged forward, taking the opportunity to go on the offensive as Harry scrambled to gather his wits and his footing. Darting back and out of his reach, Draco grinned at the fury that flashed in the green depths of Potter's eyes. Unable to resist the taunt, Draco lifted his hand and beckoned Harry forward with a smirk.
Ahead of them, Draco was still fuming, though he'd quickly reigned in his magic after speaking with Soren. The older elf was right, if they went into this meeting with him blasting his magic every where they'd take it as a sign of hostility. Still, it infuriated him that every one else seemed to be taking this meeting seriously and that Gryffindor idiot was flirting with his little girlfriend. He'd been the idiot to insist on this damn meeting in the first place! Every inch of him wanted to smack that smile right off his stupid face. The only thing keeping him from doing so was the fact that they were rapidly approaching the border and the arranged meeting and he had other things to worry about.
Even to his ears the attempted apology sounded feeble. He hadn't meant to offend Soren. He had wanted to make Soren feel as confused and angry as he, himself had felt. Misery obviously loved company, but it wasn't always misery it attracted.
As the wolf's attention remained distracted by the movement in the trees, Draco began inching again toward about the river. He tried to make as little nose as possible but even with his care, the wolf's eyes zoned back in on him. Draco gulped as he stared into the large, narrowed eyes of the creature in front of him. The only thing he saw in their depths was death and pain.
Harry made a noise of irritation when Draco snorted. "I mean break the warding."
Stuffing his hands into his pockets, he began to make his way to the other side of the Manor where he could slip out into the training yard. Given the hour, he doubted there would be anyone out there, which served his purposes just fine. Flexing his fingers, the dull ache of yesterday's blisters reminded him just why he didn't enjoy training with an audience. Ilaria had decided that since he was hell bent on heading out into the world, she might as well make sure he could protect himself.
I do not own Harry Potter or anything related to the Harry Potter verse. This story has been created simply for my own amusement and there has been no monetary gain made from the production of this story.
Something was terribly wrong and Harry didn't fight the deep protective desire flooding through him. With barely a thought to consider what he was about to do, Harry turned and started running. His new found strength offered him a burst of speed that Harry, under normal circumstances, wouldn't even think was possible, which left Gwynn struggling frantically to keep up with him. Harry barely registered her footfalls echoing behind them as he ran toward the stables. He wasn't entirely sure why, but he was positive that his entire life depended on him reaching the northern border before nightfall.
All eyes shifted from Harry to Draco, catching a brief moment of surprise flicker in grey eyes before that all too familiar wall slammed down over his emotions. Potter's interest in him was starting to drive him crazy. He didn't understand the motivation behind it and it made him uneasy. Still, the consideration was more than he was expecting and it certainly was more than anything his Father had ever offered him.
She took several moments before answering, her eyes scanning the boundaries of their lands as her mind worked on drawing up the best course of action. In such a situation even the smallest miscalculation could set into motion a series of events that would have drastic consequences. "We have several outposts along the borders that could be up and running within a day or so. The outposts at Galëgori," she explained, her hand moving to touch each location as she spoke. "Zalthorián, as well as Antölia are the largest outposts we have along the borders and are spread out enough that through combined effort they can cover the entirety of the boundaries. We should send word to them and have them at the ready. If Roland is planning an attack, he'll have to move through them first, which will buy us enough time to get the main army ready to meet him in the valley."
He wasn't sure what made him think of it, but an idea started to form. "But, I think I have a better idea," he muttered, changing directions and motioning for the others to follow him. It was an insane thought, but it had potential. No one, save a small collection of people, were aware of it and only two people could freely access it. One of them was Voldemort, but Harry was willing to bet someone would notice him before he got there.
Harry grumbled something rude as he turned to glance at Gwynn, who rode beside him. An addition to the party that had surprised him. Much to either of their surprise, Ilaria had invited her to join them. She apparently had proven her worth against werewolves on his mad dash to save Draco. She also "could anticipate crazy" or so Ilaria had said with a knowing glance at him. Regardless of the reasons, he supposed, he was glad to have her there. It was a calming presence in the storm that was his thoughts.
"Is he alright?"
The remaining walk to the library was silent save for the sound of their footsteps echoing off the walls. Harry didn't notice. For those last few minutes, he focused inward, building up a prison for everything that had hit him so suddenly only moments ago. By the time he stepped into the library, he was back to being calm. The ache in his chest dulled only slightly, but it was enough to allow him to focus on those who were already occupying the room.
"Harry shook his head. The name was not familiar to him. Neither Hermione nor Professor Binns –those two being the only ones prone to quoting educational tidbits in his presence – had ever mentioned that particular name.
He was so silent and still that for a moment Draco thought the worst before a low moan escaped Harry and his head rolled to the side.
Located on the eastern side of the Manor, the training grounds were made up of a series of interconnecting courtyards. Ilaria had explained that they had once been located out near the stables, but the growth of the stables and the equestrian training grounds had moved them inside to these unused courtyards, which connected to one of the few public entrances into the Manor. Guards were stationed at the gate to regulate the traffic coming through and there were strong wards to prevent anyone from passing into the main portion of the Manor but – unless closed for military use - any citizen could request entrance to use the space. It was how many of the students entered the grounds.
Sighing, he glanced at Gwynn who just motioned him forward. As far as she was concerned, they were his friends and he could deal with their hysterics. "They're all yours."
Pushing those thoughts aside, he motioned for Harry to follow him. Heading further into the library, Soren followed a bath through the selves and tables. Normally such discussions would be held in the council hall. It was where war councils and defensive measures were sought to, but with the tension already high he wanted to avoid anything that might spark a flame.
"And you're sure that the disturbance is moving to surround?" Ilaria asked, leaning over the map spread out over the table and considering the options available to them. Covering the map were small pins, a collection of colours dotting the surface and each one having it's own representation.
"I've tried everything that I know, but nothing is working," she admitted, her regret evident in her voice and Harry knew instantly that she was telling the truth. This woman wouldn't allow anything to stop her, not if she had the choice and strangely enough that made him feel a little better. "His body's not responding to my magic and it's not strong enough to heal on it's own." It was strange, definitely. She'd never had a patient who failed to respond to her magic. Of course, she'd never really worked on a Wizard before, nor anyone with this particular degree of wounds. Normally she didn't contend with both Wizarding magic and creature influence.
"This portkey will take you London," she instructed, placing a silver locket in the palm of his hand and closing his fingers around it securely. "You must find Severus. Tell him I sent you. He'll be expecting it."
Groaning, he twisted his legs around until his feet hit the floor, elbows finding his knees as he rested his head in his hands. He really didn't need new nightmares. He had enough of his own without experiencing other people's. Even that didn't make sense, however. If he was, somehow, slipping into another person's mind how would he even be accomplishing it? It wasn't an ability associated with the Elves and it certainly wasn't something he'd picked up from the wolves. It couldn't be Legilimency. He would have needed to make eye contact with the person in question and he was proficient when it came to Occlumency so it was unlikely someone was manipulating him into seeing these images.
Gwynn held his eyes for a long, meaningful moment before she responded, "Which makes him the first human to have done so in over two centuries." The meaning behind those words lingered in the air. Something was changing and neither one of them were sure whether or not it would be a change for the better.
"I think my favourite part was you stuttering over what to call Draco."
A snort from down the table had Harry glancing down to meet Draco's eyes, if only for a moment before stormy grey shifted away from him. "I do not have numbers, nor will I be able to get them if I'm in the Realm," he continued, forcing himself to look back to the Councillors. "We benefit more if we are able to move freely across the border. Returning to Hogwarts will place us perfectly. I shall have access to Dumbledore and the Order. Draco will have access to information on Voldemort's movements."
With a final nod, he turned and headed back toward the group he'd arrived with. Most of them were eyeing him with curiosity, some with suspicion, but he supposed that was to be expected. Harry, on the other hand, wasn't looking at him at all and, in a rare show of control, wasn't giving anything away emotionally either. The only sign that anything was wrong was the nervous glances Gwynn kept shooting him.
Draco hesitated for another moment before giving up his struggles entirely, slumping forward against the pull of his confinement. There really was no point in fighting it any longer. Either Snape could be trusted as his mother had suggested or he wasn't. If Severus weren't to be trusted then he'd be in no worse position then what he was already facing. The fact that the man wasn't causing him any further pain was something to consider and a small flicker of hope began to grow in his chest.
"Actually," Faelyn interrupted, "it isn't entirely useless."
"In a sense," Lothair nodded, ignoring the smug look that moved over Draco's face and the irritation that flashed in Harry's eyes. "That is not the limit, however, elemental magic can be combined. For instance, if you combine your Wind magic with Draco's ice the magic itself will be strengthened. Luckily for the both of you, your elements are quite compatible. Not as strong as Ice and Water, but strong in it's own right."
"That easy, huh?" Harry snorted, resigning himself to the battle ahead of him ... cause it would be a battle. The look in Draco's eyes as he watched Harry move forward was predatory and the sword in his hand seemed almost impatient.
"Is that so?"
Draco bit back the curse. Dumbledore was a bigger manipulative fool than Draco had previously thought. For whatever reason, he guessed that the old man had an idea about why Draco was in the company of the Elves. He probably didn't have the whole picture, but enough of an idea to try and use it to his advantage.
Harry was confused. Hopeful, definitely, but confused. What bond? What harm, for that matter? Harm to him? He didn't really care so long as he wasn't standing there and watching Draco die. He kept telling himself that he'd feel that way about anyone in Draco's position, but deep down a part of him questioned that. The need to save the blond was strong, stronger than anything he'd ever felt. Stronger even than his common sense. The tone of Rosalind's voice should have warned him of the dangers but all he could think about was that this was a chance he couldn't pass up.
Ron muttered something under his breath that sounded distinctly like the word "stupid", but Harry didn't comment on it. It didn't matter if he didn't like it, so long as he accepted it. He felt bad about lying to them, but it wasn't just his arse on the line anymore.
"Yes, my Lord. I will not fail you."
As he moved around to the side, Harry finally turned his head to look at him. Nothing had changed from the ride back from their rendezvous with Dumbledore. His face was still closed off. "
What he needed was a guide ... and he knew just the idiot.
Somehow, he'd managed to slam his mental shields down and force him out, but not before Potter had seen whatever there was to see in his mind. He had said he hadn't seen anything but that was a lie. Draco knew he had. What exactly Potter had seen, however, was unclear and unlikely to be divulged anytime soon ... particularly since the idiot was doing his best to ignore Draco's very existence.
Sensing Harry's confusion, Soren continued the conversation by making the obvious but necessary introductions. "Ilaria, I'd like to introduce you Harry James Potter, Dark Prince of the Elven Realm."
"And the High Lords?" Roland watched the image ahead of him flicker momentarily before focusing once more.
For the fifth time, Harry's sword hit the stones of the courtyard with a resounding clang as a small line of blood blossomed across the back of his hand where Gwynn had nicked him with her blade. It was an amateur mistake and he knew there would be a frustrated look of confusion on her face long before he had a chance to glance up at the obvious physical evidence. It was entirely out of character for him and she knew it.
"Complaining about it is not going to make him appear faster," she ground out, shooting the redhead an annoyed look.
For a moment Harry simply gaped in surprise. It was the same Elf he'd seen defending herself out in the courtyard days ago. Sure, she didn't look the same in her training gear, but Harry was positive that this was the same girl. On her feet were tightly laced boots of dark leather that rose to mid-calf and the same soft material that covered Harry's own legs encased hers. The protective training gear she wore was a deep shade of green, effectively highlighting her long auburn hair, which was pulled back expertly into a thick braid that hung down her back. In her hand she held a sword very similar to Harry's own: long and light, with a slight curve to the blade. What was a surprise was the strong oak bow and quiver of arrows strung across her back. Only a handful of the Elves in the group carried a bow and hers was different still. Even from where he stood, Harry could see the delicate patterns painstakingly carved into the wood of not only the bow but the arrows as well. If nothing else, it was quite clear that her weapons – or at least that one in particular – meant a great deal to her.
"Make who appear?"
Hendrik seemed to see the truth of the situation in Soren's dark eyes, for he nodded his understanding and his gratitude. It was not everyday that a High Lord made an offer to prolong an interrogation ...and that was exactly what it was. Hendrik was not a fool. He had seen the dark look in the Prince's eyes. When he had ordered them back to Jade Manor, it had not been for a brief conversation. He'd been seeking retribution for the wrongs done to his mate. Even with the assurance in Soren's tone, he could not be sure that the Prince wouldn't still be seeking such retributions. "Three days is all I need," he informed the Elf as he stood. He did not offer a hand to be shook nor did he bow his head. He merely nodded, an understanding between strong leaders. "I shall inform Samuel of the change and then be on my way."
"Why does the Wizarding world not talk about it or even acknowledge it? This is the first time that I've heard such a thing."
There was no need to repeat the command. The feet of the second messenger were in motion long before Roland had released him. The order would be given and the Wolves would be dead within the hour. If not, there would be hell to pay.
Ilaria nodded, before hopping off the display case she'd so casually perched herself atop of. "I look forward to the earful I'll get when Caedmon learns I've bought another sword," she smiled, as she ushered Harry back to the door.
"What the fuck?" Draco muttered, watching as the sink moved and rearranged itself to reveal an entrance to whatever the hell Harry was trying to show them.
Soren had made a move to deny that claim, but Rosalind's sharp eyes had already pounced on it. "Don't argue with me. It was manipulation at it's finest. You prayed on his emotions. Plain and simple."
"Then learn to feed yourself," Sheedra retorted, crossing her arms over her ample chest, "Otherwise, you deserve to starve!"
Everything inside of him told him to run, but his body was rooted to the spot. If he ran then the chase would be on. He couldn't outrun a bloody werewolf when he was completely healthy let alone when he could barely shuffle one foot in front of the other. He certainly couldn't climb any thing; his shoulder wouldn't hold his weight. His frantic reasoning, however, did not hold up against the feral snarl that ripped past the creature's lips. Draco's eyes widened at the terrifying sound. Without a second thought, he turned and forced his bruised and bloody body to run. The pain was excruciating, but the fear taking over him was worse. The pain didn't matter. He just had to keep running.
Grumbling as he stepped out into the lit corridor, Harry shot Draco a dirty look before he stalked off down the hallway, not bothering to wait and make sure the blond was following him. He hated being up early, especially when it involved an irritable blond snarking at him about wanting to be led about the place. Couldn't Soren given him a map or something?
Harry had never been quiet so glad to hear that smug tone of Draco's. It offered a distraction for Aranel, pulling his attention from what might have been wrong with Ehlark to pin it on Draco. Ehlark, however, was not so easily distracted. Even from where he sat, Harry could see the other Elf's mind working to figure it out. As this eyes lifted, feeling Harry's stare on him, the brunette fixed a slightly suspicious look onto his face before turning his attention to where Aranel was arguing with Draco. Hopefully, Ehlark bought it enough to think that Harry thought his actions suspicious. Even as the guilt churned within him, he insisted that it was for the best in the end. They only had one more vote to secure.
Like Harry's, Draco's hair had grown long past where he normally kept it. Someone, Rosalind he assumed, had untangled the long lengths but it remained loose at his side. Harry knew, without touching it that each strand would be as soft as it looked. The colour too had changed. Though not drastically, the blond locks had lost some of the golden quality, further lightening the strands to almost platinum. This might have drawn his resemblance closer to his Father had it not been for the other physical changes Harry was seeing.
Harry's voice seemed to cut across his thoughts with ease, drawing him back to the conversation. Somewhat stiffly, he turned his head to take in the other two. Harry had switched from his blinding bright smile to something a little more exasperated and was holding out a large forkful of eggs to Gwen, who was looking at it like she might very well lean over and eat them right off Harry's fork. Noticing the brief second where hunger won out over her sense, he stood, the sudden movement startling some of the nearby occupants and jerked Harry up from the table by the back of his shirt, ignoring the startled yelp that escaped the shorter man.
"Tell me," he muttered, watching them from within the shadows with cold eyes, "did you bind her to you as well? Is that the plan? Create your own little shield of people who can't escape?" It was an unfair accusation, he realized, but he was beyond rational thought just then. His life had changed so drastically in such a short time and his anger had grown so rapidly that he latched on to the first opportunity to lash out.
This news was not something that Molly had expected to hear and it wasn't something she wanted to listen to. She listened not because she wanted to but because she had to. As Dumbledore continued, she began to look as though she was going to explode. Her cheeks flushed, her eyes narrowed, and her mouth formed a very thin line. It was not a look that the occupants of the room were unfamiliar with, which, in part, was the reason that Remus spoke before an angry syllable could fall from her lips.
Just thinking about it made his face heat up.
"You were saying?"
Draco growled at that. Lucius Malfoy. Never before had Draco felt such an unbridled anger at the man. He'd spent the majority of his life looking up to Lucius and doing his best to be everything the man had wanted in a son. In the end, he had gotten nothing but hatred and pain for his efforts. The way he acted, the relationships he developed, the way he carried himself, all of it had been an attempt to please his father and now those aspects were what confined him within that position. He'd alienated anyone who might be willing to help him out of the mess he'd found himself in.
Prior to the change of his body, he'd always felt a rush when he held his wand. It'd been alive and now ... now it felt like deadwood in his hand. There was the tiniest thrum of magic at its core but that was it. It was sad, really. It had been his companion since he was eleven. Hell, it was the first thing he'd ever been given that signified that he was someone special. Now it was nothing.
"What does that mean?" It was the first time Draco had spoken since entering the room.
"Do you think he'd going to develop a lot of the characteristics?"
"That's not really any of your concern, is it?"
"Scared," Ilaria taunted, twisting her wrist and letting her hand slid down to the end of the lance before sweeping it quickly out in front of her and sending a blast of hot air at Lothair, who barely managed to block the worst of it with a string of colourful curses.
Before Hermione could admonish him for talking with his mouth full, loud laughter echoed from the end of the Slytherin table, drawing Harry's attention. Draco was sitting with his usual group, casually talking away while the others laughed. Given the somewhat annoyed look on Zabhini's face, he had a pretty good idea what the blond git was talking about.
He'd been impressed by Hogwarts. Who hadn't? The sheer level of magic intertwined to create such a place was an awe inspiring feat of magic. The sheer levels of magic overlapping each other was dizzying to even consider ... but this ... this was beyond Hogwarts.
"Gah," he gasped, jerking backwards and away from the unexpected site of the intimidating blond. "What the hell are you doing?"
Beside him, Draco felt Harry tense, but not a sound escaped the brunette and he wasn't entirely sure that was a good sign.
"It's not difficult to get sensitive information if you know how to listen, Harry." Gwynn responded, sending him a smirk through the strands of her hair that had been caught up in the slight breeze.
"He seems like he'd be fun to have around."
Harry glanced up. He'd vaguely heard the others leaving the room from somewhere in the back of his mind, but Draco's voice seemed to cut through the darkness he was exploring like a knife, drawing Harry's attention to him. The blond stood across the table from him, eyes hard and arms crossed over his chest.
"You should never have offered him the solution, Soren!" It had been an hour since Harry had left them. An hour in which Rosalind had continuously voiced her opinions. As the lead healer for Jade Manor, she had every authority to question the decision made and voice it she did. Even though Harry had agreed and, therefore, sealed the arrangement, the decision did not sit well with her. "This could tear them apart and you know very well what would arise if such a thing should happen. You do not interfere with a mate bond. You, of all people, should know this."
Offering him a brief shrug and an even more amused smile, the healer handed him a damp cloth with which to wash his face. "You've got a bit of blood on your face, dear," she informed, sweetly.
"I want to go to the South Wing."
Again Snape shook his head. "I've been looking, but I haven't found any signs of her."
Sure enough, when Harry dragged himself to the training room the next morning, he had found himself facing two regimented lines of fifteen young Elves. After their initial respectful greeting (which Harry still wasn't comfortable with) Ilaria had instructed him to take his place among them. He wasn't just going to make a fool of himself in front of Ilaria, which happened on a regular basis, Harry was now going to be making a complete fool of himself in front of fifteen of his peers. He didn't like thinking of them as his subjects. The concept was just far too surreal.
The bored wave from Lothair confirmed her words and Draco raised an eyebrow, turning a curious glance toward the Elf lounging on the lower wall. An element? He knew a little about Elven magic but not enough to satisfy his curiosity. Magical strength was everything in the Wizarding world and he doubted it was any different in the Elven realm.
If he hadn't known any better, Harry would have assumed that everything was right as rain over at the Slytherin table. Pansy was in her usual spot attached to Draco's side and they all seemed to be having a mighty fine conversation. The only sign that there might be trouble was the placement of the group. Rather than sitting in the middle of the table for the most attention, they were located at the end, Crabbe and Goyle acting as buffers between the remainder of the table.
As lead Healer, Rosalind had the advantage of having more than just a simple office. Once through the door, the space widened out to include her personal office, medical storage, a lab, and a conference room. It was not uncommon for her to have trainees working in the lab or fellow healers converging in the conference room. That day, however, the space was wonderfully silent. Reaching the appropriate door, she ushered the three High Lords through. Taking a moment longer, she moved to her office to gather what notes she could on the procedure and returned to the others.
Draco's eyes narrowed not from the comment but from the steady, quiet tone. It was a statement of fact. Nothing more. It wasn't the Potter, Draco was used to and he couldn't say he liked the change all that much. "Don't give me that bullshit," he snapped, taking the initiative to move around to the front since Harry didn't seem all that interested in looking at him. "No one has seen hide nor hair of you for two days and now you're out here sitting atop a stone pillar like a bloody rooster."
As the desire continued to build, another of Harry's senses kicked in. It was as though someone had thrown open a window, allowing a warm breeze to wrap around the two of them and further teasing their heated skin. With that breeze came a familiar and delicate scent of oranges. As the sent registered, something in his mind changed. There was a name. It lingered at the edge of his awareness, teasing him with its presence. No matter how he tried that name prevented him from dragging it into the light.
"They'll kill you for this," he whispered, terrified not for himself but for her. If Lucius didn't, Voldemort surely would.
Harry had to bite back a laugh at the disdain in Lothair's comment. Clearly, an hour or so spent at the Head table had not changed his dismal opinion of Wizards. Draco, however, didn't bother to hide his smirk of amusement and for a moment he was irritated that Draco seemed to get along with Lothair better than the blonde did with him.
"What about our magical abilities?" he asked, raising an eyebrow. "Our magical signatures have grown drastically. We can't exactly hide that."
Gabriel winced, offering up a sheepish smile. "That obvious, huh?"
At the currently was, his studies has been divided into what Soren had described as three equally significant areas of study: politics and international relations with Soren, etiquette and Elven culture with Lothair, and military strategy and defense with Ilaria. None of which particularly excited him. Harry did, however, have to admit a certain overwhelming sense of relief to know that Soren would be starting these studies. It wasn't that he didn't like the other two High Lords; they simply had a tendency to make the hair on the back of his neck stand up. Ilaria, in her own way, was extremely welcoming but there was something all together frightening about her. He constantly felt that she knew every move he was going to make a moment before he knew. As for Lothair, the older Elf held in his possession a personality that clashed severely with Harry's. The sense of competition that had developed between the two of them was not something Harry had expected, but it was something he used to push himself further. At the moment, however, Soren had made it quite clear that he had to face the past before he could hope to handle the future. There were things in his past that held a firm grip on who he was and Harry was nervous to face them and realize just how deeply they had altered him.
If Potter's advantage was speed, then Draco's was strength. A smirk tugged at the corner of his lips as the last of his thoughts organized themselves into what he needed. He took his eyes off Harry's sword and watched him instead, focusing on the way he moved and his footwork. He fended off a few more strikes before he saw his opportunity. Potter shifted and as though in slow motion, he saw where the brunette was going to go. Switching his sword to his left hand, positioning it in the way of the brunette's strike and forcing it back and away from them, Draco created an opening. With both swords tied up to the left, Draco balled his fist and landed a solid punch to Harry's jaw. The force of the hit spun Harry's head to the side and he staggered back, dazed.
I do not own Harry Potter or anything related to the Harry Potter-verse. This story has been created solely for my own amusement and no monetary gain has been made from its publishing.
The Elf, catching the flush on Harry's cheeks, just smiled and waved. "Akkar," he introduced, offering Harry a small bow of his head. "It's a pleasure to meet you."
"The sort that no one can know about; wizard or elf."
Things were not falling into place as they should and his patience was being strained far past the point of safe return. Since the Potter brat had arrived within the realm, his plans had been gradually going astray. First the outburst brought forth by Lothair's barbed words, then the disobedience of the wolves, followed by the failure of destroying the beasts. Slowly, things were falling into place for the High Lords and their wayward orphan. The entire thing only served to boil Roland's blood.
Draco only shrugged. He supposed it didn't really matter so long as he knew what the hell he was talking about, which shouldn't be hard since he was a wolf himself. The least of Draco's concerns was pack hierarchy. "Don't tell Potter, he'll probably take some sort of weird offence to it and force your Alpha to bite his head off out of sheer irritation."
"We were standing in the dungeon and he said he could hear something," Draco responded, watching as the older elf found Harry's pulse point, pausing there for a moment before moving to lift his eyelid. "He said he could hear something. I listened but there was nothing. Whatever it was only Harry could hear it. Then there was a sudden buildup and release of pressure. The idiot shoved me out of the way and it hit him in the chest. He started screaming immediately. Akkar had to knock him out in order for me to move him."
Harry just sighed and waved it off. Sitting up, he pulled his sleeve up and showed her the angry red marks. "Apparently, I will survive." He was pretty sure if anything was going to kill him it was going to be the length of this day.
Draco was furious. In fact, Draco was so furious that he was certain the word was simply not enough to convey the full extent of his emotions. His life was falling apart around him. He had no family. His mother was likely dead and his father wanted him to be as well. He had no home. He could trust no one. He'd been mauled by a damn werewolf and could very well be on his way to becoming one himself. Then to top it off, he'd nearly died all so perfect, idiot Potter could go and bound the two of them together in some half-baked attempt to save him. He was sure it had more to do with the idiots hero-complex than any real desire to keep him alive. He had no idea the full extent of the bond forced upon him, but it didn't really matter. It likely wouldn't show it's depths until it had fully formed. He did know, however, that it wouldn't end well for him.
Lothair would be absolutely furious.
"How does that make it right?" Harry snapped, angrily.
Silence held for a moment as those around the table took in that information. Even Draco was startled by the claim. Potter sat perfectly still, that same cold mask he'd been showing the past few days locked in place.
didn't see hide nor hair of me," he repeated, offering him a shrug. "Doesn't mean others saw the same."
If his hands weren't otherwise occupied, Draco was pretty sure he'd have taken the time to offer Potter a particularly rude gesture. As it were, however, his eyes scanned his opponent, taking in the details and calculating his potential movements. He wasn't going to assume that Potter wasn't doing the same thing and, frankly, he didn't have much interest in losing to the Gryffindor.
"I agree," he quietly responded. What harm could it really do? He was already out of his depth. What did it matter if he went a little deeper down the rabbit hole."
With nothing else to say to Lothair, his eyes moved to take in the two other occupants of the room. "Gwynn, you did very well today. Thank you for going with him, despite the risks," Soren offered the young elf an acknowledging smile and bowed slightly, causing a flush to spread across Gwynn's pale skin as she scrambled to return the bow. The High Lords rarely bowed to anyone and the fact that Soren, himself, was currently bowing to her had her so far through a loop that she wasn't even sure if she'd bowed properly. Things like this didn't happen to her.
"What's a Pureblood?"
"Covert assignments?" Lothair asked, raising an eyebrow. "What sort of covert assignments?"
I do not own Harry Potter or anything related to the Harry Potter verse. This story has been created simply for my own amusement and there has been no monetary gain made from the production of this story.
"Speaking of which," Ilaria, who had perched herself on the edge of the table to better view the argument between the men, interrupted with a thoughtful expression, "Don't you find it odd how they're acting with each other? One minute their fighting, the next Harry seems to be submitting to his mate, the next they refuse to accept that they are mates at all."
"You're out here playing house with her after ruining my life and you think it isn't fair?" Growling Draco took another swing, but this time Harry was ready for it and managed to shift out of the way.
"What makes you certain he will head for the valley?"
"All the pretty words in the world don't add up to much unless you live up to them," was Hendrik's response, earning a low hiss from further down the table. Lothair, Harry guessed. He didn't dare take his eyes off the Wolf across from him. The stare was as much of a challenge as the words were.
"What the hell are we supposed to do now?" Lothair asked, coming up to stand beside Soren, arms crossed over his chest. "We're not to meddle in Wizarding affairs."
This whole place was strange and he had yet to get used to the difference. Everything here seemed to run off the natural energy of the realm itself. All the water that flowed into the Manor came from streams and rivers that ran through the land. Even in this room, the water flowed into a small pool at the center of the room before draining out. The entire Manor was built like this, as thought they had built it around nature rather than over top of it. He'd found the greenhouses the other day, but they had not been like any greenhouse he had ever seen. They were a part of the castle, but the entire floor was earth and the vegetation grew directly out of that soil. The walls were made entirely of glass as though giant sheets had been molded around the pillars. His mother would have loved it.
"To be honest, I'm not sure," she admitted, a slight frown on her features. "There could be several reasons. I did find traces of potions in his system, Wizarding variations for the most part, but there were a few that I didn't recognize. One of them may be preventing him from healing, but from what I can tell, the majority of the ones used were to keep the young man alive. Another possibility," she continued, turning her eyes away from Draco's prone form, "is that his body simply doesn't have the strength to do what's needed. He has been through a lot and it wasn't just the Werewolves that harmed him. There were lesions on each of his wrists that signify that he'd been restrained. There was also a large wound where he had almost all of the muscle detached from his shoulder joint. The cut was far too clean to be caused by a set of claws. I cannot say for sure, but I'm almost positive it was an intentional wound. The angle would have been one in a million if it had been an accident."
"What do you suggest we do then, Ron? Using your Father's car to rescue him like in second year?" Hermione asked, nearly groaning when Ron's eyes lit up at the suggestion. Sometimes she really did wonder how he had made it so far in life. "This isn't a bedroom that you're breaking him out of. It's a kingdom. A magical kingdom, no less. There are strict rules about communication let alone abducting one of their own."
"A wizarding war," he sneered, using a lazy motion of his hand to wave off the threat, "Inconsequential."
The moment Harry was laying comfortably on the bed, Rosalind pocketed her wand. Among the Elves, a wand was not a necessity. It eased the strain of accessing one's magical core when simple tasks throughout the day, but for those who had strengthened their connection to the world around them, there was no need to draw on their magical core. In her line of work, Rosalind had grown accustomed with using her tying her magical core with the ever flowing energy of the earth. Jade Manor had not been placed idly. It had been built in the North on that exact spot because there natural lines of magic crossed. It was no difficult task for Rosalind to slip into those streams and gradually draw on the natural healing magic found there.
In the second courtyard, there were a line of stone pillars that ran through the middle of the space. While Draco had never practiced in this particular courtyard, the targets fixed to the pillars told him it was designed to train the archers. That evening, however, it was being used for something else. Sitting atop the middle and largest of the pillars was Harry.
"Uh huh," Daemeon chuckled. "When do you need it?"
"Damn right, you do."
Movement on the other side of the room drew Harry's attention and he glanced away from Hermione. His eyes landed back on Draco and the good humour he'd been feeling started to drift away. The angry slowly returned and the weight on his chest seemed to press down harder. Was this what his life was going to be now? Any happiness he might feel forever doomed to be crushed under the weight of this bond? He didn't regret his choice. He couldn't. That knowledge, however, didn't make it any easier to adjust.
Soren must have been able to read that thought in his eyes because his usually thoughtful eyes darkened immediately, offering Lothair a rare look of hostility. "Be very careful, Lothair. There is more going on here than even you know." He wasn't really worried about what Lothair might or might not do. With the Werewolves in the Manor and the development of Harry's bond there were far more important things to worry about and he knew Lothair would not dare do anything while the human boy was in the Manor and under the care of Rosalind. Harry, he was sure, wasn't going to be leaving the Manor again for a while and he was equally sure that he wouldn't permit Lothair anywhere near it's new ward. There was nothing the Elf could do at the moment.
"You're avoiding me?" he asked, raising an eyebrow. "That's a bit childish, even for you."
Draco's amusement was put on hold instantly, as the presence of four unfamiliar individuals was noticed. His eyes swept over them, looking for any signs that they meant to harm him. None were familiar. They weren't the Order and Draco automatically glanced past them to look for Dumbledore. It didn't make sense the old man wasn't around there somewhere. He'd never let his precious Potter out of his sight. The nervous look in his eyes may not have been noticeable to most, but Soren could see it as though the boy had verbally admitted to it.
"Man's a saint to deal with your obsession."
Since it was clear that he would not be finishing with his reading, Soren closed the book in his hands and set it down on the table beside him. "It is one Werewolf living in the castle and I think it is an excellent idea. We've simply relied on the pack to maintain the border without any sort of regular interaction. It will be good to have a liason to keep the peace. Second, the Wizarding world is not of any significance. They can not force our hand. Should Harry return for his schooling, they will be notified-"
Harry wasn't entirely sure whether or not he should be insulted, but Ilaria was nodding her head in agreement. "I was thinking the same. He'd never be able to wield anything heavier for a long."
"Open the door?"
"Because your Father didn't claim his Elven heritage does not mean he isn't entitled to a spot among his for bearers, however, both James and Lily are only minimally documented in our archives. This is so that the bloodline can be traced. They, like you, are a stone in the path that your family has and will continue to walk for generations."
Another few moments of being led through the streets found the two of them standing outside a small shop, the only sign that it might be a swordsmith was the wrought iron sign hanging above the doorway that depicted to swords crossed over a shield. Harry raised an eyebrow at that and turned to look skeptically at Ilaria. "Not very original."
"He comes with us!" Harry growled, his narrowed eyes moving to pin Soren with a look that clearly stated any arguments would not be tolerated. With a sigh, Soren took a step back and nodded.
"And?"
"Bloody 'ell, Malfoy!" Harry snapped, the words muffled and slurred from behind his hands as he tried to stop the blood now pouring from his nose. "You broke my damn nose, you prat!"
It was clear, looking across the table to the burly Hungarian, that he was not entirely appeased by the situation. The stress of his position and the knowledge of possible outcomes of his seconds actions weighed heavily on him. This realm belonged to the Elves, the presence of the Wolves was based on the alliance between the two races. At one time, there had been a variety of magical races residing in the area, but as time had passed, they had drifted away. The Fae had left silently in the night while the Vampires had been cast out and isolated to their own territories. The wolves were all that remained. This coexistence between the Elves and the Wolves was crucial to both sides. The Wolves were protected here, away from the fear and violence of men. To be pushed outside of the boundaries would be devastating to their race and Hendrik was well aware of that. The pressure of keeping their pack safe and the full knowledge of what had taken place a few days prior was enough to keep him in his seat, as obedient as any Alpha could be.
"Erase their memories and let them go."
It was a good question, but the only answer Harry could offer was a whispered, "I don't know."
"Draco!" Harry called, the worry returning. When Draco didn't respond, Harry whirled around to face Soren as a tinge of red appeared in his eyes once again. "You said you'd help him!" The tone was accusatory, but there was also a good portion of warning in it as well. Harry's hold on himself was teetering dangerously on a ledge.
For a moment, he just watched her. Saeya. Her hair was a deep red. Not the Weasley's sort of red but like a wave of blood pulled back from her face into a long braid to reveal the pale skin of her neck where the tip of a scar showed above the collar of her jacket. The mark itself was roughly an inch wide and looked as though the wound had been jagged. He wondered idly what could have happened, barely registering the fact that she'd turned her head to return his stare.
"Have you not accepted your responsibilities as the heir to the throne?" Faelyn asked, long silver hair braided loosely and hanging over a delicate shoulder, her lavender eyes piercing him. Under the weight of her stare, Harry felt like he was being exposed.
Had he not been so worried about Draco's condition, Harry might have actually been stunned into silence by the fact that he could actually understand what the wolf was saying. He hadn't heard any yips or barks, but actual words. As far as he was aware, Werewolves, while in their wolf forms, did not speak English … and he most certainly shouldn't have been able to pick up a hint of an Irish accent. "You had best hope, he survives these wounds. If he doesn't, neither will you."
Harry snapped out of his internal considerations, thanks to Ilaria's
"Sorry," he muttered, awkwardly shifting in his chair. "Muscle spasm." It was probably the lamest excuse to have every crossed his mouth, but he couldn't exactly announce that he'd just been inside Ehlark's head. Gradually, all eyes slid from him save one. He didn't have to look up to know that Draco was staring intently at him. He could feel those silver eyes burning a hole through him. When he did risk a glance, he found Draco still staring at him, eyes narrowed as though he knew exactly what Harry had done.
"It transported him from the Manor, despite the wards against it. The potion did not, however, send him to the appropriate location. I've checked several possible destinations but I can't find a trace of the boy anywhere. Even scans on his magic aren't bringing anything up. He's simply vanished." Snape responded, feeling the tension in his body threatening to overcome him. The fact that he couldn't track down his charge was something Severus felt to his very core.
"Whatever it is you're accusing me off, could you knock it off?" Draco asked, his tone bored. He hadn't even bothered to look over as he'd said it. He hadn't needed to. His increased senses were screaming at him that Harry was glowering at him and he could practically feel the accusation in the stare. What he was being accused of, he didn't know, but he was sure it was bound to be something stupid given who it was silently accusing him. "It's irritating."
He made a face as Harry stuck a piece of toast in his mouth and stood. "As much as I'd like to watch you eat like a slob," he commented, brushing off his uniform, "I have places to be"
The shout broke the wave of surprised murmurs that had spread across the hall at their sudden arrival. Glancing to his left, Harry found Ron standing at the Gryffindor table gawking at him. Hermione and Neville across from him, both with looks of surprise. A wave of relief moved through him at the sight of them and he took a step in that direction, but a heavy hand settled on his shoulder, holding him in place.
Harry didn't recall setting an alarm the night before. Despite that, it still went off bright and early at an obnoxiously loud decibel. Sitting up groggily, he reached for his wand to cancel the alarm. It felt weird having his wand in hand again. He hadn't touched it in weeks. His magic had changed and he no longer needed it, but if they were to keep a low profile then he was going to need it in order to maintain the image.
He felt Akkar emerge behind him, the guard had already disappeared into his glamour. Anyone who looked into the corridor would only see Draco, standing alone in front of a dusty tapestry depicting some long-forgotten battle. Taking stock of where this entrance was, Draco began to make his way toward the more commonly used portions of the dungeon. Snape would already be in the classroom and Draco had time before the students arrived. Snape never opened his doors until the last possible moment, preferring to keep his contact with the students to a bare minimum.
"Let him go!"
"What if he doesn't return?"
The re-entry had him stumbling to catch his balance, wide eyes focusing back on Draco, whose face had paled. It hadn't been subtle this time. The look on the blond's face told him that he'd felt the intrusion. The wall he'd envisioned slamming down had been Draco's way of protecting himself.
Thoughts, Harry realized. The murmuring had been Ehlark's thoughts as they moved through his mind. What Soren had said was true, then. The Elf would side with Aranel regardless of the outcome. Another spike of frustration. Why the hell was he even a counselor if he was incapable of making a decision on his own. If he was just going to mimic the man sitting to his right, what purpose did he really have?
Soren looked thoughtful for a moment, before he chuckled softly. "Everything will become clear soon enough." He briefly wondered if he truly was the only one to put the pieces together. If they thought about it, he knew they'd see it, but when stress was high it was easy for the eyes and heart to be blinded. It wouldn't be long before that blindfold was pulled from their eyes.
Sighing, he steeled himself and quickly reached out to knock before he could change his mind. There were certain things he needed to speak with him about before they headed out of the Realm. With only two days left before their departure, he was running out of time.
"He said he supported the decision."
The longer he stood there, standing in front of the full length mirror that Rosalind had been so kind to bring him, Draco was finding it harder and harder to find himself. He didn't recognize the image reflected back at him. After Potter had stormed out, the High Lords had taken their leave as well with the promise to return at a later hour to continue their discussion. In that time, he had tried to gather himself. With Rosalind's help, he was given new clothes to wear. Gone were his wizarding fashions. Even if the tears in them been reparable, they still would not have fit his new frame. Instead, he was dressed much the way Potter had been. Dark trousers, the material soft and light as they seemed to comfortably take the shape of his hips and thighs before falling down to pool at his feet. The tunic covering his chest was a light blue and felt strangely soft against his skin. A corded belt had been added at his hips. He had been given boots as well, but Draco felt strangely more comfortable with his feet bare. These clothes were not his. In fact, he didn't know who they belonged to and, yet, he felt strangely comfortable in them.
"Does this book record everything?"
"He will return because he knows he has to."
The three High Lords shared a worried look as Harry left with Erebus. The bond was starting sooner then it should have and Harry's mind would now have to balance the bond and the darkening of his personality. It was a balance that Harry would need to find immediately and none of the High Lords were entirely sure what would happen if he didn't. The Realm had waited five generations for a leader. It couldn't wait any longer. If Harry fell before an heir was produced, the royal bloodline would end with him, throwing their world into chaos.
If he had expected Potter to stay down, that wasn't what he got. Potter was instantly up even though Draco knew he'd be feeling that kick for days. Barely managing to draw his sword up to block Potter's next attack, he used his shoulder to further stabilize his blade and push Potter back. Potter seemed hell bent on attacking and Draco realized the brunette was solely focused on the fight. He doubted the idiot even felt the pain in his ribs or the growing strain on their bodies.
"If I may interject, I would like to point out that there has been no history in Harry's family of creature blood intermingling with Wizarding. Lily was a Muggleborn and James was a Pureblood. If either of them had been a magical creature Sirius and I would have known. This isn't something that they could have kept quiet."
All eyes turned to Lothair in surprise, earning an irritated sneer from the Elf. Always with the surprise.
There was silence at that. It had been centuries since humans had been permitted in the realm and while Harry had a particular investment in the human population of Britain, he couldn't really fault them for their caution. The moment they order had found out about the Elves and Harry's connection to them, he knew there would have been a push to involve them in this fight with Voldemort. Any advantage was worth the risk. It was bad enough that Harry was already involving them, but to have them enter the realm without permission was going to fracture what little stability he had in this world.
After several excruciating moments, Harry spotted his hand breaking the surface of the water. Using a bit of the strength he'd tapped into previously, Harry put on a burst of speed to reach a large overhanging branch a few meters or so in front of Draco. Reaching the branch just as Draco passed under it, Harry dove into the water after him, completely disregarding the fast current. For whatever reason, he couldn't let Malfoy die. It was imperative that the blond remained alive and Harry was doing his damned best to ensure that happened. He'd never been much of a swimmer prior to his time in the Elven realm, but Harry found himself moving through the water easily. It barely took any time for him to reach Draco's limp form, an arm wrapping around the other boy's waist as he did his best to keep them both afloat. Even with his new strength and skills, Harry could barely keep Draco's head above the water as he attempted to fight the current and get them to shore.
Harry glowered, catching Draco's amused look from where he sat comfortably at a desk in the front of the classroom like the little suck up that he was. Sometimes he just wanted to smack that smug look off his lips ... at other times he wanted to do something else entirely, which made him feel an awful lot like he was suffering from whiplash.
"My shot is just as good as yours!"
I do not own Harry Potter or anything in relation to the Harry Potter verse. There has been no monetary gain from the creation of this story. It has been created merely for my own entertainment and that of my readers.
Draco wasn't entirely sure, but he was almost positive he'd caught a flash of despair in her eyes before the strength she was currently displaying took control. It was strength that Draco, himself, didn't feel. His eyes strayed to the door once more as another assault hit the frame, the wood reacting to the strong magic being used against it. With his attention elsewhere, Narcissa quickly muttered the incantation to activate the portkey. He had to leave without her and she knew he wouldn't agree otherwise.
Perhaps it was the wording Soren used, but Harry suddenly found himself not so sure in his resolve. Some part of him warned against such a thing. He couldn't shake the feeling that he shouldn't be agreeing to this. That something terrible could happen to both of them if he were to allow this. "Feed off of me? Why does it have to be me?" he asked, taking a step away from both Soren and the bed where Draco's prone form lay. He couldn't pinpoint the exact reason but he had a feeling that by allowing Draco to drink his blood, he would be admitting something. Agreeing to something. He felt like he'd be crossing a line he could never come back from. "Why can't he just drink Dragon blood … like I did?"
Potter. Wasn't that they way it was suppose to work. The disappointing son of a Death Eater had bloodied up their Chosen One. He should have already been strung up for it and yet, here he was sitting in on the most absurd meeting he'd ever heard of. Three wolves sat across the table from him, two elves to the right of him, and a chair clearly meant for Potter on his other side. And what were they there for? So Potter could deal out a suitable punishment to the wolf responsible for attacking him.
With one resting against his shoulder, he lifted the other to point it at Ilaria. "Don't start off flashy," he warned, knowing that was exactly what she wanted to do, "they're supposed to be learning not watching you show off."
If he was honest, he was somewhat annoyed with himself for getting caught daydreaming like an idiot. Alright, it wasn't about being caught or daydreaming. He was annoyed that he was jealous of Parkinson, of all people. He was really trying to keep a lid on this bond but it was proving to be extremely difficult. He could feel it, like ... like a snake had burrowed inside of him. His chest ached painfully on a regular basis, the longer they spent apart the more nauseous and cold he felt. More importantly, his thoughts tended to darken the longer he denied the contact the bond craved.
Some sort of god of protection was looking out for this idiot, Draco was certain of it, because otherwise someone would have killed him already. Draco was pretty close to it now and the only thing keeping him from doing that was the fact that there was an entire pack of wolves ready to tear his throat out if he did. "You're an idiot," was all he said as he turned and continued to stalk down the hallway.
"Why me?" Harry asked, surprised.
"He was never
"So what are you going to do then?" Gwynn sighed, knowing that pressing the issue would be no more productive than beating a dead horse. "About going back to the Wizarding world?"
Harry wasn't really sure if he understood completely, but he nodded none the less. It was particularly difficult to focus with so many things running through his head. "Is it going to hurt him?" he asked, his concern morphing onto a new level as he recalled the pain he'd gone through as his body shifted and adjusted to his inheritance. On top of the wounds on his back, Harry wasn't entirely sure whether the blond could handle anymore physical pain.
Idiot. Bloody useless, spazzy idiot.
Reaching his horse, he silently mounted and retook his place in line. He would offer no comment here. If Harry wanted to rant at him, he could do it later. It didn't matter now.
"The boy's condition?"
"The lot of you can eat right along with everyone else next time!" Sheedra commented, shooting them one last glare before returning to whatever work she'd been doing when they had interrupted her.
"Well look what new horror the Mother has graced me with this time."
Prying his eyes away from his own sword, Draco found that Harry had moved to the other side of Lothair, his own dark box sitting on the top of the wall. He hadn't opened his own box, instead watching as Draco had opened his. Only with Ilaria's urging did he make a move to lift the lid. A part of Draco thought he was almost hesitant to do so, which earned a frown.
"What do you mean I can't play Quidditch?" he asked incredulously. "I'm the bloody captain!"
"You know, you insinuate certain things when you invite people into your bathing room!"
Draco rolled his eyes and muttered, "Potter is far from Hades. He's Epimethius."
The sound of hoof beats against the Earth drew him from his internal thoughts, his eyes easily spotting the scout they had sent ahead of them. "They arrived roughly twenty minutes ago. Five of them."
"Well that was...interesting?" she hedged, unsure of what to say. The last thing she wanted to do was direct his anger to herself. She had no idea what had caused the outburst, but she was partially glad to have not been a part of it. "I'm going to go out on a ledge here and say something's got your braid in a knot."
Harry frowned. He was really tired of getting the third degree about this. What else was he suppose to do? Let Draco die? He'd never be able to live with himself if he didn't do what he could to help. He didn't understand why it had to be him to supply Draco with the needed blood, but if that's what he had to do than that's what he had to do. Hell, he didn't even know why he kept calling him Draco. "I'm saving a life, Gwynn. What more do you want from me? He needs my help."
Moving to one of the stone heads, he placed a hand on the smooth surface and focused inward. After a moment, he pulled away. "It seems somewhat similar to dragon magic, but it's not exactly the same. After centuries, all the magic had found ways to merge. It was amazing really. An entire structure of magic and stone that was separated from any one form of magic.
"But he's a Death Eater!"
Hermione continued to glare at Ron for a moment before she pulled her eyes away from him and focused on Harry. "Nothing," she shrugged. "Or at least as far as we know. When you went missing from your Aunt's the entire order was focused on finding you and then-" she hesitated for a moment, debating her words, "-when we found out you were settling into your inheritance, the order has gone silent. Not even the twins can get any information out of them."
After roughly five days of going to bed tired and bruised, Harry had petulantly snapped that he couldn't be expected to learn anything when he was paired with someone who knew everything. The sarcastic tone that lingered in his voice when he said "everything" had made Ilaria grin in such a way that the young Prince actually felt his skin crawl beneath his light tunic. Whatever she was thinking, Harry knew he probably wasn't going to like it.
"Stasis spell," he repeated, more slowly before nodding to the potion.
Continuing on, they found fourteen separate bedrooms, each with its own restroom. "I think she's outdone herself," Harry commented, opening the door to one of the rooms. The colour scheme reminded him of his room at Jade manor and he was instantly drawn to the enchanted view of the lake from his windows
Given their late arrival, there weren't any desks left together and the three of them separated. Ron immediately took the spot open beside Dean, which left Harry and Hermione to find seats with the Slytherins. Given Snape's favouritism for his own house, most of the seventh year Slytherins had taken the course. In comparison, not even half of the Gryffindors had followed suit.
After another moment, Harry sat up, not having noticed the silence that had fallen around the table as he'd thought. "What's done is done," he finally spoke, his eyes moving to meet the Alpha's across the table, "It can't be undone, but I'm willing to overlook it on three conditions."
For a moment McGonagall looked confused before she shook her head. "Not that I'm aware of." She was going to ask why he thought there might be but some sort of cloud seemed to pass over his face before he was gone.
"I'm telling him you said that." She commented, opening the door and leaving Harry along in the street to gap after her before quickly following her inside.
Looking into his Father's eyes as the older man smirked, raising the silver dagger now firmly in his grip, Draco fully realized how foolish he had been to believe in what the man had preached. There was no honour in being a Malfoy. The name no longer carried with it any respect, Lucius had seen to that. Narcissa was no longer there to save him and the Malfoy line would end as it currently stood: bloodied and broken. When the dagger met his shoulder, Draco vaguely heard himself scream as the sharpened blade separated skin and muscle with precision and ease. He could feel himself slipping beneath the onslaught of physical and emotional pain, leaving him to do the only thing left available to him: silently plead for the reprieve he wasn't going to get.
"Oh that," Draco smirked, "Well, that's simple. No one knows I have enhanced senses and physical abilities that surpass the ordinary student ... at least more than usual."
"Because I'm good, obviously."
"The Alpha and his second."
She laughed again. It had been a long while since she'd had to deal with a moody teenager. Sure, there were young recruits in the army but Ilaria rarely dealt with them. Those in her personal guard were seasoned warriors and not quite so prone to melodramatics. She supposed if she and Caedmon sired children in the future, she'd have something to reference. The thought amused her more than it probably should and she debated sharing it with the young man beside her. Given his rather pathetic state, however, she decided against it.
"Harry," she started, a familiar huff of irritation slipping past her lips as she slid her sword easily into the sheath stretched across her back. It was an uncommon place to rest, but one that Harry had come to appreciate. "What in the world is wrong with you? Even on a bad day you can usually hold on to your sword a little better then that!"
He was intrigued, naturally. In the time that he had been within the Realm, Harry had encountered no other Elves his age outside of the training environment. Sure, he liked the High Lords – or most of them anyway – but there was something very different about talking to someone your own age. After all, he liked Professor McGonagall but that didn't mean he was going to invite her over for a game of chess. Harry knew what the problem was. It was simply, really. He missed Ron and Hermione. At the same time, however, he wasn't entirely sure he was ready to face his best friends. His sudden inheritance would surely be something Hermione would want to study and Harry really didn't want to end up as an essay topic. Ron, on the other hand, proved to be an even bigger worry than Hermione. Harry's sudden change was bound to draw unwanted attention and Ron hated being pushed off to the side. Harry was positive the red head wasn't going to be at all pleased with any increase in Harry's already elevated status. For Ron, it was often a very difficult thing to be the friend of '
Harry couldn't help the look of annoyance that flickered across his face at that comment. Since volunteering to partner with him in their training sessions, Harry and Gwynn's had spent the vast majority of their time together. Harry rather enjoyed having another individual in the realm he could just be himself with. He liked having someone he could relax with … even though Gwynn rarely relaxed and received a distinct pleasure in pointing out all of his weaknesses. He was secretly terrified of the day he would introduce Gwynn to Hermione. They were far too similar for their own good … or his, for that matter. He really didn't need to have Gwynn lecture him on his poor form while Hermione lectured him on the historical relevance of swordsmanship. The very thought made him shudder with fear.
Ilaria sighed, drawing their attention. "There's a darkness in the Prince," she started, letting her mind move through the images that rose to the forefront, "I've seen it rise up during his training only for him to force it back down. For the moment, he's been successful at keeping it controlled, but I can't say he'll continue to be so. There's something preventing him from facing it completely. He forces it down and ignores it. If this boy is what he needs to final take control, then I agree with Soren. The transfusion is needed. If he continues as he is, I'm afraid that darkness will overtake him and all will be lost."
"Yep." Harry nodded, as Draco began to put the pieces together. As they reached the end of the corridor, it opened up into a huge room. The last time he'd been in there he hadn't noticed the sheer size of the place. He'd been much too busy trying not to get himself and Ginny killed. "Welcome to the Chamber of Secrets."
The two circled each other for a moment before Harry moved again. In the back of his mind, Draco felt a stab of irritation at having been put on the defensive once again. Each time Harry attacked, Draco deflected the blow, forcing the other man back. His sword seemed to vibrate in his hand, each ring of steel on steel sounded angry and the blade seemed to grow cold in his hand; the sort of cold that burned your skin.
It was fascinating and so surreal to watch member after member of his bloodline make their appearance on the pages before him. Every moment or so his mind would question the reality of the situation despite the physical confirmation. As name after name passed with each turn of a page, Harry could feel the tension start to build in his chest, directly above his heart. As interesting as it was to see past generations, there were only two people he longed to find and he was terrified that they wouldn't be mentioned. When he arrived on the page he'd been fervently looking for, the names Lily Evans and James Potter stood out glaringly. The delicate black line that connected him with his parents solidified for Harry the rather limited connection he had always felt with his parents. For once, he felt the tinniest bit of hope that he might now have a chance to build a deeper connection, even if it was simply through a deeper understanding of their heritage.
The thought of the blond Elf's anger caused a moment of indecision where Harry's speed slackened, but the sight of the familiar green pastures of the Manor's stable brushed aside any lingering thoughts of Lothair. If the High Lords wanted to know where he was they could follow after him.
If there was one thing Roland hated it was failure, particularly at the hands of the realm .This time around, the presence of that Potter brat only fueled the flames of his already deadly temper. "You mean to tell me that a mere fledgling who knows absolutely nothing of his powers or the realm had you turning back with your damn tails between your legs?"
He could feel the guard arriving in the other room and he moved to the door. "Akkar, Saeya. Lindir!" Three elves appeared immediately and Lothair motioned them into the room. "It's a forbidden curse."
For the life of him, Draco couldn't understand why there was so much noise. All he wanted to do was sleep and the entire world seemed to rebel against him because of it. There were birds chattering somewhere in the distance and he silently cursed the house elves for opening the windows. There were footsteps outside his room. A lot of them, which left him wondering what was going on. Surely the Dark Lord had not called a meeting? His thoughts continued for a brief moment in that direction, till the sound of someone calling his name brought him closer to the surface of his awareness.
Severus didn't press further. It was clear to him that Draco had no intention of letting that hinder him and, frankly, he was just as interested in discovering whether or not the Malfoy matriarch was still among the living. If Draco and his new found connection with the Elves could assist in that matter, he was more willing to allow them the opportunity to do so.
Slowly things began to click into place. The spark of guilt or pride when he'd considered Potter. The weight on his chest that had appeared when Potter had stormed from the room. They were bonded. He was bloody bonded to Harry bloody Potter, the boy with the biggest bloody target on his forehead.
"Spindly?" Harry asked, his eyebrow rising, His indignation went unnoticed, however, as Lothair's voice cut across their conversation. Lothair had just stepped back into the room, which was a surprise in and of itself. Only a moment ago Harry could have sworn he'd seen the other Elf standing beside Soren.
With a resigned air, Soren turned and followed the other two High Lords from the room. He had not meant to allow it, but a seed of doubt had been embedded in his heart. Control and understanding was quickly slipping through his fingers as, metaphorically, the wolves howled at the gates.
"Clearly," Blaise commented with amusement, golden-brown eyes staring at him from across the table, "It's not every day that you show up in the middle of dinner with Potter at your side."
"Are they armed?" Ilaria asked.
The moments passed at an agonizingly slow pace as they made their way back to Jade Manor. The thirty minute trip felt like eons and not once did Harry lose that closed off look. Not once did he unleash whatever storm was brewing behind that new stony mask of his. If it didn't frustrate him so much, Draco might have actually been impressed.
The group of them headed forward and into the open common area. There was no furniture but Harry wasn't overly concerned about that. Furniture could be transfigured. He was, however, fixated on what appeared to be large windows lining the walls. He was well aware of the fact that they were deep below the castle and, yet, here he was looking out on the grounds of Hogwarts. They were clearly things of magic but Harry was impressed all the same. Lifting his head, he glanced up to the ceiling and found the night sky. It'd created the same enchanted ceiling that was in the Great Hall and he was impressed all over again.
Two low warning growls came from the two other wolves as they moved to step in front of their injured companion once again. A month ago, Harry would have been scared to death at the very sound, now it only had him anticipating a fight. "If I catch you hunting on Elven ground again, you will become the prey," Harry returned, his voice low and dangerous. "Do I make myself clear."
"The big deal," She flushed all the more at that, "is that they now think there is something inappropriate going on. You invited a girl into your bathing room, Harry! You didn't even do so quietly. Innocent intentions or not, the whole castle will know by daybreak!"
"Being an Elf does not make you less than worthy in the eyes of the world," Soren responded, his posture tense as he slowly rose from his chair. The tone in his voice was one that had Harry instantly regretting his ill chosen words. "You were chosen to inherit the responsibilities of your Elven heritage not because you, as an individual, are special but because the realm is in need of a Prince, now more than ever. Fate is
"I'd prefer if the boys stayed," Dumbledore interrupted, "There is more that I would like to discuss with them."
"Now that we've all arrived, let us discuss what should be done about this misunderstanding."
"Damn it, damn it, damn it," he muttered, more then a little panic sinking into the tone of his voice. Turning Draco onto his back, Harry did the only thing he could think of. Clearing Draco's airways, he sealed his mouth around the other boy's and breathed air into him. After a brief moment of this, he pulled back and placed his hands on Draco's chest, applying pressure in the hopes he might be able to get his heart started again and the water out of his lungs. After several more rounds of this, Draco still hadn't moved and Harry was starting to lose what little bit of his calm that he had.
Soren nodded. "Exactly. This isn't a normal bond. I'm positive that this mortal will become Harry's consort in time. I believe the two are meant to be bound mind, body, and soul. This is why I mentioned the transfusion. Yes, I agree that the bond should, if given the opportunity, flourish on it own. However, we don't have the option of letting it take it's course. If the mortal dies now, Harry will not be able to handle the influx of power he'll receive during his coronation."
"Enough!"
"I, for one, would like to know more about how this man has split his soul," she continued, turning her attention back to Harry. "If I agree to this venture, I expect to be fully compensated with the knowledge of this Voldemort, individual."
Once he'd settled, his own magic swirling up around him, he started to reach out. He could feel the complex magic swirling around him. There were individual points of power for each of the Elves behind him, but there was a much larger presence surrounding them and he assumed that was Hogwarts. Taking a deep breath, he reached out with his magic to touch the large entity. The moment his magic connected, a surge of power slammed into him, knocking him backwards. The air rushed from his chest as he hit the floor, a low groan escaping him.
Draco hesitated for a moment, his eyes flickering to his friends. "We need allies," he commented instead. "They could be useful. They have a better idea of what's going on than we do."
"What?" he asked, his tone low and threatening. It was a tone that sent a shiver down the spine of both elves, though for very different reasons. Harry had only used that one once before and it held the same sort of weight it had when he'd demanded the respect of the Wolves.
It was not just anger that coursed through his veins. Under all that boiling rage was a steel core of fear. He'd been trying to escape the whole battle between two sides who were equally willing to sacrifice him. His mother had died for it and all he'd managed was to be caught in one cage after another; the last one a more permanent cage than he'd thought was possible. He didn't belong in a cage. He didn't belong in
Of course, this had made no impression on Draco.
At that, Severus' thoughts shifted to another. Narcissa Malfoy. He hadn't seen nor heard from her since her attempt to save her son. Fresh pain stabbed through him. It was another woman he'd been unable to protect. First Lily and now Narcissa. He'd known Lucius long enough to know he would not forgive her transgression. He'd already discretely searched the Malfoy Dungeons but had found no sign of her. If she was still alive, he wasn't keeping her there. He wanted to hope for her survival but he was starting to lose faith. The longer Lucius had her in his crazed grip, the less chance she had of seeing another day. All of his reasons for his double life were being stripped away from him and a part of him feared he was going to once again face the decision he'd made years ago. It was the light or darkness. He wasn't naive enough to believe in the shades of grey anymore.
"They will be fine. Let them loose!"
"Properly."
"Second, you continue acting as an outer defense for the realm. I've been told that you are an intricate part of our defensive system and I'd like to maintain that," Harry continued, leaning back in his chair with a sigh. He felt like most of his energy had been drained from him and, if he was honest with himself, he just wanted this all to be over with. "And finally," his eyes flickered to Draco briefly before returning to the Alpha, "Draco has to agree with the conditions as well."
Standing, Harry shook his head. He couldn't tell Draco about any of it. The bond screamed at him to confide in him, but Harry held back. Whatever Draco was planning to do in the Wizarding world was outside of anything that took place here. No one could know. Not if they wanted to cross the realms border. "I didn't do anything."
"It is our will that creates the difference between us. Free will and the potion of choice cause it. We were all created with the ability to make our own decision. Some, like us, have chosen to remember the Mother. Others, like the Wizarding population, have fallen away from the truth. Wizarding kind has created their own sense of reality in the form of their religions and social practices, but even in these varying religions the dominating gods are all representations of the Mother. They all possess the same abilities and while they not remember the truth, what they create does not stray far from it. It is ingrained in all of us."
It didn't help. The warnings, the worry, nothing helped. It still came down to the fact that Harry couldn't just let him die. He felt responsible. He should have gotten there sooner and none of this would have happened. A brief stab of anger burned hotly through him as he thought about the Wolves. They were resting somewhere in the castle and that bothered him greatly. Soren said he needed to speak with them, but had refused to tell Harry where exactly they were staying. He'd never been a violent person but at the moment all he wanted to do was rip the lot of them a new one. After a moment he sighed, offering her a small shrug. "I don't have another option," he admitted, more of his fear slipping into his tone than he would have liked. It wasn't fear for himself or what being bonded to Draco would mean for him. He was worried about what all of this would mean for Draco. It would alienate him from the world he was used to. He wouldn't be just a wizard any longer. At a moment like this, Ron would have insisted that the blond was the next in line for the dark mark and what if he was? What was going to happen then? Would the bond cancel out any desire Draco had of selling Harry out to Voldemort? Everything was far too complicated.
Before the situation could deteriorate further, Dumbledore took a step forward, breaking the Auror's focus on her cousin. "Greetings. I'm pleased to see both Mr. Malfoy and Mr. Potter are in good health. Their absence from their respective communities have been strongly noticed."
"You can continue on to wherever the hell you like," Harry growled, his eyes moving from Pansy to Draco, "You and I are going to talk."
Harry hadn't even opened his mouth before the injured wolf had started to respond, it's head lowered in shame as it spoke. "I apologize, my Lord. I did not know this human belonged to you."
"I saw them in the forest!"
Harry looked up in surprise. "What? Why the hell didn't you wake me earlier?"
"I understand your restlessness, Hendrik, as well as your need to leave this place," Soren responded, holding the other man's eyes. "Your pack is currently without leadership. I, too, would be restless in your place. It will take the Prince a few days to accustom his consort to the new environment. Your second must stay on the grounds, but you are free to leave in order to check in with your pack. I can guarantee you that no harm will come to your comrade or that no decision will be made on his fate until you are able to return to the Manor. On this, I can give you my word."
Draco's own allegiances were currently in a scrambled mess. After his previous failed attempt at escape, Draco knew he wouldn't be able to make it much further on his own. He was tired, weak, and had lost a large amount of blood. He was no longer being fed blood restoratives and without them, the wound to his shoulder was much more serious. He needed to find some help. Muggle or Magically, he really didn't care at this point. He wouldn't have a chance to care if he succumbed to his wounds.
The last glimpse Draco had of his home was filled with the image of a single tear trailing down his Mother's pale cheek and as much as that image caused his entirely world constrict, Draco couldn't help but take notice of his Father's silhouette in the broken doorway. Nor could he ignore the look of pure, unbridled fury etched into every line of his face. His mother would not survive her transgression, of that Draco was positive.
A snort of derision escaped Severus at those thought. Hogwarts wasn't safe. He'd made the mistake of believing otherwise and had ended up under the control of two separate individuals intent on doing anything necessary to get what they wanted. For the youngest Malfoy it was, unfortunately, him that they wanted. The silver lining to this new rain cloud was that Severus now had the ability to focus all of his energy on finding Draco. He refused to believe that his potion had failed. He hadn't failed to brew a potion since his second year. It was incomprehensible. His potion had worked exactly as he'd designed. It had fused with the boy's body, making him a temporary port key. What he'd miscalculated was what destination Draco's subconscious would choose as the safest. Wherever it was, Severus had been unable to locate it. He'd known the boy since childhood and still he couldn't track him. It was both a relief and a worry. If he couldn't find him, than both Voldemort and Dumbledore wouldn't be able to either. However, having been the one to administer the boy's blood replenishing potions, he knew exactly what Draco faced without them. The boy was loosing blood faster than his body could naturally replace it. His injuries did not bode well for his survival. And that did not bode well for Severus Snape's sanity.
The female shot Aranel a chilling look for the comment. Whatever Aranel had read in that look, it at least kept him quiet. It did not, however, remove the look of distaste from his feature.
Even if this particular Scout wanted to continue the report, he could no longer do such a thing once the firm grip of Roland's long fingers had secured themselves around the man's vocal cords, squeezing them until the last of his air was forced out of him. "I will not tolerate weakness," Roland hissed, flexing the muscles in his hand and allowing his elongated nails to sink into the flesh of the Elf's neck, blood dripping out from around the puncture wounds to paint a red trail over the pale skin exposed to Roland's mercy. "I will not tolerate incompetence."
Further down the table, Draco was finding himself watching the exchange intently. He was feeling it again; that pressure he'd felt in the courtyard. It had started out subtle but it was rapidly growing. It hung in the air around them. Glancing around, no one else seemed to have felt it. How that was possible, he didn't know. It was stifling.
Despite all his efforts, Draco stumbled again, hitting the dirt. All his hope instantly drained out of him. He couldn't force himself to get back up. Curling in on himself, Draco waited for the pain he knew would be coming. The creature would only take seconds to reach him. When nothing happened, Draco tensed all the more. Turning his body, Draco found the creature standing a foot away from him with saliva dripping from its open mouth as its nose sniffed the air and its ears twitched. After a moment, it's attention returned to Draco's bleeding form, a deep growl reverberating through its chest.
"Yes," Lothair muttered, the sound impatient, "Like a portal."
"You can't just-" but Draco had already shut the door, leaving the kitchen and it's occupants behind.
Hedwig snapped at his outstretched fingers affectionately and ruffled her feathers in a means of greeting. As odd as it sounded, the sight caused a rush of feelings to pass through Harry. No matter how much he had changed, Hedwig still recognized him. He was the same old Harry to her. It gave him a small bit of hope that those he had been close to in the Wizarding world wouldn't pull away from him, now that he was different.
Harry snorted, a part of him was amused by the fact that he knew Draco wasn't going to like the next part. Served the git right. Moving to the opening, he shot the blonde a smirk before lifting himself into the opening and letting go. Once he reached the bottom, he stood up and wiped off some of the much he'd picked up on the way down. He supposed it'd been years since anyone had been down there.
"There is one way."
The shuffling sound of his feet echoed through the strangely quiet forest as Draco forced himself away from the support of the tree. He hadn't noticed it before, but, now that he was focused more on keeping his body moving and not his internal monologue, Draco was acutely aware of the fact that he couldn't hear any wildlife. There were no birds, no insects, nothing. A slight chill ran down his spine at that, causing the hair on the back of his neck to stand on end. After taking a few more steps he paused and cast a nervous glance around. An entire forest set in silence didn't bode well. It wasn't exactly a sign that everything was as it should be.
"Do you feel that?" he asked, his voice hushed as though if he spoke too loud it would cause the energy to explode.
By the time Harry arrived at the Great Hall for lunch with Ron, having just returned from a rather disastrous herbology class involving Venomous Tentacula. There were little stinging bite marks along his inner arm to prove it. Madame Pomfrey had insisted he go up to see Madame Pomfrey since the venom could be quite potent ... cept it wasn't exactly potent enough to do him any harm. Still stung like hell though.
"That's not out of the ordinary," Harry commented, urging his horse up to where Soren and Ilaria were sitting. "The wouldn't have come without them."
It would not be difficult to buy the man some time. With everything that had happened since the attack in the forest, Harry's thoughts would be far from them. The boy had a lot on his plate and even more ready to be placed upon it. Deep down, Soren knew that Harry wasn't the sort to relish in pain caused to others. He would understand, if not like, the need to put this on hold. For the next little while, Draco would be his immediate concern.
"Oh, please, Sheedra? Please?" Gwyn begged, clasping her hands in front of her, "Your cooking is so much better than my mother's. I'll simply starve if I have to continue eating her cooking."
"You're the best Sheedra!" Harry called after her. "Thank you!"
Roland's hand shot out, instantly grabbing the rough shirt of the Elf closest to him. Given the current predicament, Roland just barely managed to contain his fury. The last thing he was going to tolerate was a slip up in his plans. He would kill them all before that happened.
Draco blinked in surprise. "Wait! What?"
Draco moved around the table to put himself between Harry and the quick exit he was trying to make. "Don't fucking lie to me!"
For a moment, Soren only smiled, an amused twinkle in his eye. It was a smile that told of things left unsaid and, for Ilaria who had always loved a bit of mischief, it sent a thrill of excitement through her. "All we can do is point them in the proper direction."
"We can't tell him the significance of the bond."
Harry didn't know how his part was very well done, particularly since he'd ended up on his back once again. He didn't even have the excuse of it being Ilaria who had done it. Gwynn was a student just like him; an extremely good student, but a student none the less. Pushing himself up onto his elbows with a raspy breath, Harry shot her a glare. Her amusement wasn't helping the situation, nor was the murmuring coming from the remainder of the class: a mix of awe, fear, and anger.
This time McGonagall offered him a chuckle. "It's a promise."
Immediately Soren's attention returned from his internal musings to focus once more on Harry. "It records the complete history of the royal family: your family. Now that you have been returned to your rightful place, the book will record your accomplishments."
For a moment Harry could only blink at his serious, auburn haired friend.
Lothair remained where he'd been, his eyes meeting Soren's with a hard edge to his look. He didn't need to speak for Soren to know what he was about to say. "He's reckless and cares of nothing but himself." It enraged him that some mere human meant more to the idiot than the whole of the Kingdom. As Prince, Harry was suppose to protect the people above all else, but it was quite clear that was not going to be happening so long as this human was still breathing. He wasn't normally in the habit of killing humans, but if it was the life of one against the well-being of the Kingdom, he'd gladly be the one with blood on his hands.
Rosalind nodded, "Yes, when it comes to bonds there is always a dominant and a submissive. Given your bloodline and the fact that it was your blood that was used in the transfusion with Draco, it was assumed that you would become the dominant. Due to the werewolf traits, there is a chance that the dominance will shift from you to Draco."
Of course, with the day he'd had so far, it was, perhaps, a bit too naive to assume that he would be slipping away that easily. With his first movement, the entire situation seemed to explode. The three wolves shot forward, their large claws leaving marks in the earth at the force applied. The smaller of the two moved directly forward, hitting the wolf standing with Draco at a speed that the blond wouldn't have thought the large creatures were capable of. The largest of the three, much to Draco's horror, headed toward him. He barely had enough time to turn onto his stomach before the wolf was on him, warm breath that smelled of rotted meat ghosting over his exposed neck as a sharp set of claws dug into his back, tearing skin and muscle as they moved. Draco could help the scream that was torn from him. This pain was beyond anything he'd felt before, both physical and emotional. He could feel every inch the claws tore through.
It was one of Ilaria's favourite things to yell at him when he couldn't get past her defenses. When they fought, Ilaria tended to use the same weapon as he did. The only difference between them was their skill with the same blade. This was different. Harry's Gladius was different than Draco's long sword. He didn't handle it the same way that Draco did. It was an entirely new challenge and Draco's mind was already pulling pieces together in order to solve the problem. There wasn't much in way of surroundings, which left only himself to rely on.
Draco nearly choked on the bite of chicken he'd just taken, his eyes snapping to Pansy. He wasn't the only one either. Everyone within earshot of her had turned to look at her as though she had suddenly lost her mind.
Despite the quiet of the halls, there would be one light that would still be burning. That was his current destination and, like a moth to the flame, he continued on his way despite the continued hazards he knew he would be facing. "Lemon Drop," the smooth voice echoed strangely down the corridor before being swallowed by the sound of stone grinding against stone as the statue guarding the Headmaster's Office shifted, presenting to him the stairwell that would lead him upward. It wasn't a surprise that the door to the office was open, nor was it was surprise to find the Headmaster sitting behind his desk, calmly waiting for him. A benefit of being the Headmaster meant the continued knowledge of what was happening within the school. The moment he had crossed the wards, Dumbledore had known.
He did know better, however, because the thought was ridiculous. Malfoy had not shown any signs that he appreciated the current bond between them. He'd all but rejected it and Harry couldn't really blame him, even if it did weigh heavily on him. It was like a weight had settled on his chest and if he thought too hard on it, it started to crush the breath from him. He'd been given various explanations to what this bond was or what it could be, but Harry hadn't bothered trying to figure it out. He didn't
. He wanted freedom. He wanted the freedom to make his own decision. He wanted the freedom to be the author of his own tale. Even with his misgivings and the worries that constantly plagued his mind, Harry had a strong sense of elation when he considered what he was doing. If he could pull this off, he'd be able to build what he wanted in his life. Although, he supposed it was a very large if.
Harry didn't want to think about his coronation. They'd said he'd be crowned by the end of the summer, but Harry didn't feel any closer to being ready for it. In fact, he didn't think he was ready at all and he had to wonder whether or not it was the wisest of decisions. Still, he murmured a thanks you to Ilaria, who nodded her acknowledgement.
Harry shrugged. "I just spoke to him."
"Well done," Ilaria was amused. The sound of her voice made that very clear. "Very well done, both of you."
Rolling her eyes, Gwynn shoved water in his direction before accepting the fact that Harry really had no idea what he was doing half the time. She knew he hadn't meant to make it look like there was anything going on between the two of them...still, that didn't mean she was looking forward to having to face Terrak and the others in the training room. She just knew they'd jump all over the opportunity to make fun of her. Shifting back until she was sitting on a submerged ledge across from Harry, she pinned him with a curious look. "Is that why you went after that human? Are you attracted to him?"
"You want me to chase skirts?" the blond asked, dryly.
"The Dark Lord has grown impatient. They're coming. You have to leave immediately," with a quick flick of her wand, Draco was warmly dressed. Even in the middle of August, the evening air could often be quite chilly. Her eyes softened at the level of shock and fear in Draco's eyes. It should never of gotten that far, she knew, but she would do what she could to prevent the nights events from transpiring. Setting the bag at their feet, Narcissa placed a warm hand on Draco's cheek and soft kiss to his forehead. "You were not made for the life they want you to lead, Draco. It will kill you."
"Because you've been here before. You have a connection to this place," he commented. "Furthermore, your magic contains traces of humanity, dragon, and royal elf."
"Makes sense," Draco muttered, interrupting whatever the older Elf was going to say, "I highly doubted it'd be anything else.."
"I bet," he smiled, blue eyes shifting to Draco, "And you, Mr. Malfoy. I'm glad to see that you're well. It was my understanding that you might have been lost to us."
His jaw clenched tightly at that, but he nodded his understanding. Severus was correct. If her body hadn't been produced, chances were he was keeping her alive.
Harry gritted his teeth. He supposed it was too much to assume she'd easily be distracted. No, Gwynn was like a dog with a bloody bone. "I heard you the first time."
Rosalind remained silent for a long moment, considering her answer. "I honestly can't say for sure. If any of the wounds were caused by the creature's teeth there is no way to prevent it. From what I can tell, the wounds on his back were all made by claws, however, I cannot be certain that no saliva entered into his blood stream. He's much too weak to run the necessary tests to find out." She paused again turning her eyes back to Harry and offering him that same small, hopeful smile. Even with the reassurance, Harry couldn't help but notice the hint of sadness around the edges of her eyes. He'd never been the most aware person out there, tending to be quite oblivious to things sitting directly in front of him, but he couldn't mistake that look. He'd seen it often enough to take it for what it was.
Draco woke, the last of his shout lingering on his lips as he jerked awake. Caught between reality and dream, his eyes searched for the horrifying image his mind had conjured for him in sleep. Even his thoughts, it seemed, betrayed him. As the remainder of the dream faded and reality took hold, he lifted a hand to drag over his face. It had been a long time since he'd had dreams like this. When Voldemort had first returned, Draco had experience nightmares, but eventually they had faded as he'd grown accustomed to the tension and terror in his life.
The use of his name had brought Harry's eyes back to the blond and any doubts Draco had had about his identify went out the window. The dark glare on Harry's face combined with the now flashing green eyes was a familiar expression. This
Draco snorted at that. "Perfect, Potter can fall on his arse even harder now."
The comment earned a sharp look from Draco that had Gabriel holding up his hands. "Already mated," he chuckled, "I was just saying. He has a lot of free energy. That's a rare thing in these parts."
The voice was familiar, but Draco could barely register that much through the haze of pain. Even if he'd wanted to he could do nothing but scream out his agony. He could hear the other wolves growling and snarling as they clawed at each other, their teeth snapping as they fought. Among the noise, however, the sound of a taunt bowstring snapping forward echoed through his mind, followed by the sound of impact and a howl of pained fury from above him. The force of impact knocked the wolf off balance. Unfortunately, the wolf's claws were still embedded in his back. The sharp movement served only to toss the blond as easily as a child tossed a broken toy. Draco barely felt it as he hit the earth for a third time, his consciousness slipping in and out. The momentum of his body as it hit the earth sent him rolling several times before he hit the river, immediately slipping beneath the surface. Water filled his nose and mouth, trickling down his throat as the current picked up his rapidly weakening body. The rough water sending his body rapidly down stream, hitting anything that got in his way, Draco's consciousness finally slipping into darkness, his lungs filling with the heavy weight of the water.
"Our army?" Harry questioned before realization clicked in. "Oh, you mean the room of requirements?" He thought about it for a moment before shaking his head. "No good. Too many people know about it and Dumbledore could access it if he wanted to."
Steeling himself, Harry moved to take the seat beside Zabini, while Hermione moved to sit beside one of the girls whose name Harry couldn't remember. He'd never really had any altercations with Zabini, but the intense stare he was receiving put him on edge and he couldn't quite contain the urge to shift his chair further away from him as he sat down.
Even with the majority of his focus on deflecting Gwynn's attacks, a part of Harry's mind still had the room to run strategically through the offensive moves Ilaria had skillfully trained them to execute. What he needed, however, was an opening. He doubted he would be given one easily. Returning from the possible list of attacks, Harry's eyes narrowed in on Gwynn's movements. They were almost perfectly executed, her focus intent on their execution. Luckily for Harry, there was but one tiny flaw. When performing an outward thrust of one's sword, Ilaria had made it extremely clear that the amount of space between the extended arm and one's body was minimal. Even on the offensive a warrior needed to protect his person. Gwynn's mistake was a growing gap between her body and her outstretched arm. It was a beginner's mistake that put Harry immediately on edge, but he was running out of time and options.
"I'm going to go out on a limb and say her element is Fire."
It was all but impossible to see Roland's movements with the naked eye and even having the enhanced sight of a werewolf didn't allow the messenger enough of a chance to block the silver dagger that flashed toward him. It's blade easily sliced through the thick cords of muscle and skin of the wolf's neck with a hiss of burning flesh, the smell fouling the air around them and the last lingering cry of the wolf as it's eyes glazed over with death. "I will choose your battles!" Roland sneered, jerking the knife from it's victim with a sickening sound. He wasn't nearly satisfied with the kill and it only took a second for his eyes to snap to the messenger's second, narrowing at the sight of the much smaller wolf. "You! Tell me how the Prince knew of your location."
After another moment, the door swung open to reveal the Elf in question. As per usual, he didn't look all that impressed to find Harry standing outside his door. On the other hand, he didn't look all that surprised either. "Finally come to explain yourself, then?" he drawled, arms crossed.
"What's happening? What's in the South Wing?"
"Well, if you're that hung up on it have some of mine, already!"
Harry glanced between them, eyebrows raising to find his hairline. "Did I miss something?"
"If you're going to bother hiding your footsteps you might want to make sure I can't hear your heart beating."
His thoughts shifted to the blond walking beside him, a slight frown marring his features. The blond had been acting weird all morning and Harry wasn't entirely sure how to handle it. He still had no idea why Draco had bothered to seek him out. He didn't believe it was because he was the closest or even that Draco felt that Harry owed him. Well, if he was honest, the blond probably did think that. That, at least, was in line with his personality. The fact that he'd sought him out, despite his voiced displeasure at having done so was not. In fact, it was the complete opposite. If Draco hadn't wanted to be within 100 feet of him, Harry was positive the blond would have moved heaven and earth to see that it happened. The manor was full of staff that would have relented under that self-righteous attitude of his and shown him whatever he'd wanted to see. Even in the Elven Realm gossip spread faster than anything. Harry wasn't going to believe that they didn't already know who or what Draco was.
For a moment Rosalind pondered on how best to approach this topic but it was soon clear to her that honesty was the best course of action, particularly since they would not be informing him of the nature of the bond he'd be creating. When things came to light, it would be better if only a small portion of information had been kept from him. "Unlike yourself, his changes are not going to be spread out over the course of weeks. He'll experience everything rapidly, which will go hand in hand with physical discomfort and pain," she admitted, though not giving him a moment to protest before she continued her explanation, "In his unconscious state, however, he should not be aware of it unless he regains said consciousness. It is, however, highly unlikely that he will. I don't expect him to awaken for several days after the procedure. His body will need the time to heal and stabilize his magical levels."
Draco, having come out of his surprise, sighed. "As cool as this might be, how is this supposed to help us? It's dirty, dark, and sopping wet."
Marking their current location, Draco guided them into a second corridor that led back to the wing he was currently residing in. Given the fact that Gabriel would be working mostly with him, the older Elf had suggested he find a suite in the same general vicinity. Draco, naturally, had taken the largest in the wing, but there were four other smaller suites that he felt would be suitable. The rest could be taken care of by the staff, if it hadn't already.
Draco was confused, disoriented, and his head was now throbbing. Lifting a hand, he rubbed at the spot that was now throbbing. That was, however, the only spot that hurt. He recalled all of the wounds that had been inflicted upon him and panic began to bubble beneath his normally cool exterior. His hands flashed out, running over his body to all the spots he knew should be wounded, but miraculously they were fine. The knife wound in his shoulder was healed, his jaw was no longer broken or sore, and there was no pain coming from his back. He was fine. Disoriented, but alive.
"Let's hear this wonderful explanation then," she urged, setting the files down in front of her, "for what reason will I be spending the vast majority of my skills and patience on rushing such a bond?"
Draco didn't ask questions, he simply scooped up the smaller man and headed down the corridor toward the entrance to the Chamber. He barely registered the shuffling of feet behind him. He was furious both with Harry for doing something so stupid and with himself for not being able to sense whatever it was that Harry had.
"Come," Rosalind urged, feeling the emotions churning within the youth. It worried her. Harry too, seemed to have a similar burning darkness within him, but this was different. This was volatile. "We have many things to discuss before the High Lords return." It took several moments of baited breath, but gradually the dark energy began to retreat and Draco gradually came back to awareness.
He'd been himself when he had lost consciousness. His hair had been normal, his appearance had been normal. Now he was waking up with Potter, of all people, standing over him with those bright bloody green eyes and dorky smile. Draco's eyes snapped up, narrowed with suspicion and anger. "What the hell did you do?" he demanded, moving to slide out of bed. His hand shot out to steady himself as he stood on unfamiliar legs and adjusted to the change in his height. The more he focused on the changes, the more he realized had changed. He was taller and much broader. The birds he had thought he'd heard through an open window, he could see flying overhead roughly a quarter of a mile away. "Why the hell am I here and what the hell is going on?"
The tone was low, but there was a level of accusation there that Harry had a hard time facing.
With a wave of his hand, Dumbledore created a spot at the Head table between Professor McGonagall and Professor Vector and indicated for Lothair to sit.
"It's possible," Lothair muttered, "If the magic accepts you."
It wasn't a suggestion and a part of him bristled at the command that was clear in the tone. Given the tension in the room, he had a feeling that he had not been the only one. Shifting his glance to the left, bright emerald eyes met a muddied shade of the same colour.
At first, Draco hadn't been entirely sure how the hell he was even supposed to get out of the chamber. The ride down had been disgusting and had created the sense of a one-way trip. Given the fact that there used to be a Great deadly snake living down there, he supposed, that for most people, it was a one-way trip. Much to his pleasure, the shifting of the space had also created a different means of entering and exiting the Chamber; a much more convenient means.
"You mean like a portal?" He asked, impressed and perhaps a little excited.
"I couldn't let you die."
"A lovers spat. How cute."
Low moans he had no hope of preventing seemed to echo around him as those soft lips found their way over the smooth expanse of Harry's neck and then the defined line of his jaw. At the base of his ear the sensations changed. The gentle kisses were replaced with the tip of a tongue as it traced the new curve of Harry's pointed ear. Upon reaching the delicate point, sharp teeth carefully pulled the sensitive flesh between those smooth lips, earning a desperate whimper that drastically tightened the ever-building heat building below his navel.
"You'll need the key."
Turning from where she was watching a passing group of soldiers, she raised an eyebrow. It was odd that he asked first. It was even more strange that he seemed to be nervous about asking. "Why is it that the Elven realm has no contact with the Wizarding?"
Even Lothair had to struggle beneath the weight of it before he could fall back into his usual snarky persona. "The wolves have returned."
"Uh…thanks," he muttered, a hand automatically moving to awkwardly rub the back of his neck. A nervous habit he'd adopted.
Harry flushed slightly, but didn't comment. Instead, he made a mental note to have Gwynn take him back into the city later. In the meantime, however, he let Ilaria manhandle him through the streets, navigating them with ease. It was clear that she was as comfortable in the city as she was in the Manor, which left him very little to be concerned about.
Now, standing outside the Elf's door, Harry was having second thoughts about this visit. Maybe he should have just summoned Lothair or something. Granted, he didn't think the other Elf would take too kindly to being summoned. Especially if he was the one doing the summoning. Perhaps, arriving like this was the better plan. At least there was a higher chance of actually getting to speak with him.
He wasn't wrong. The place was a mess and it certainly wasn't set up to house anyone other than a giant killer snake, but he was pretty sure it was the most protected place in the castle. He recalled an earlier conversation with Soren about Hogwarts being alive with her own magic. "I thought maybe we could ask Hogwarts if we could use the place?"
No matter. He would see things return to the proper order. He would see the fall of the Kingdom he so hated. He'd watched each of the High Lords fall. He'd make sure Soren was saved for last. Let him watch his fellow High Lords succumb to death and then let him see the royal bloodline finally snuffed out. It would happen. He would make sure of it.
There. That was his opportunity. Before Harry had a chance to responded, Draco took the opportunity. "I do," he confirmed, causing more than a few sets of eyes to snap to him.
"It's fine," she said, shaking her head. Closing the book, she moved it off the table so Neville had a place to sit. "You're already here, you should eat."
Harry felt slightly sick as she continued to talk. He could feel that strange protectiveness churning beneath the surface of his skin, waiting for him to embrace it. What could possibly have happened to him before the wolves? More importantly, what had happened to him that had caused him to appear where he had? And why had he been immediately able to sense Draco's location? "What happens if the wounds don't heal?" he asked, his voice rough in an attempt to keep himself calm and detached. It was easier to deal with the entire situation if he didn't care … or at least cared less; something that was far easier said than done. There were too many questions and worries moving through him to do much else. "Is he a werewolf?"
The sound of Draco's jaw cracking beneath the pressure of Lucius' fist was the only reprimand he received for outright refusing the Dark Lord as his master. Even the numbing of his senses wasn't enough to block the abrupt pain from clouding his vision as he struggled to breath through it.
Draco, as he had sat and watched events unfold before him, grew more and more frustrated with how little of the situation he knew and how very little sense the entire thing made. He was alive, stuck in the same room with Potter, his hair was girlishly long, and he had three intense pair of eyes focused on him. "I'd hate to interrupt but could someone please tell me what the BLOODY HELL IS GOING ON?" As he spoke, his voice rose until he was shouting.
Never before had Harry felt the kind of exasperated anger that coursed through him at that moment. "Destiny?" He asked, unable to contain the word of the venom that came with it. Soren, for once, could honestly say he was surprised by the sound. "That's the only answer you have? Destiny? Fate? It doesn't exist! I want a better answer than that! You just figure you can brush off the question with some bullock answer and I'll do exactly what you want, is that it?"
"You think?" Ilaria asked, honest surprise on her face before it shifted into consideration. "With all that darkness swirling around him, I thought Hades was apt." Her eyes returned to his then and she smirked. "You do have the whole Persephone thing down."
As he walked, Draco felt the shift in the air before he sensed a second presence. Frowning, he removed his hands from his pocket and half turned to glance back down the hallway. No one else should have been about. Not even the servants were due to be moving around for another hour or so. When he didn't see anyone, he continued on, all of his senses on alert. After another moment, he realized that whatever he was sensing was coming from ahead of him. In fact, it was coming from the exact place he was heading.
Reaching the main room again, he put out a call to draw back the rest of the guard before heading into the kitchen. Draco had Harry laid out on the table, the few items that had been on there now scattered across the floor. Not for the first time did he regret having made this ridiculous trip.
"We have more important things to worry about than the living arrangements of a single wizard," Lothair scoffed, using a lazy gesture to wave off Harry's concern. .
"Well, oh fearless leader," Draco drawled from behind him, "If we're not staying in the castle where are we staying? I am sure as hell not staying at the Three Broomsticks."
"It's not for me," Harry assured him. "It's for ... someone else. A Wizard."
Even before he'd fully registered the meaning behind her words, Harry could feel his jaw dropping open and the colour rising up his neck to paint his cheeks and ears a lovely shade of scarlet. He sputtered for a moment, his feathers ruffled by the comment.
He could barely get the air into his lungs as he forced himself to keep running, his lungs burning as they desperately tried to fill. The water was much louder now, the sound almost deafening. Nothing, however, was going to drown out the sound of the creature behind him. The pounding of paws against the earth, claw scrapping, and a sound far more terrifying then anything he'd heard yet: the howl of the wolf. If there were others in the area they would be on their way. Even if he managed to escape one, there was no way he was going to outrun more of them.
It was a silly thing, but having Potter save his arse stung his pride like nothing else. Falling flat on his face in front of the entire population of Hogwarts, ghosts included, would have been less damaging. Having it thrown in his face like that, only made him bristle all the more. "Add it to the list of things
"I apologize for keeping you all waiting," Soren greeted, nodding his head to the Alpha before moving to take a seat to the left of the last empty chair.
The wolves across from him nodded their acceptance at his apology and Hendrik took it upon himself to begin the introductions. "This is Gabriel. He'll be acting as our liaison within the Manor," he started, his tone as gruff as Harry had remembered it as he indicated the man beside him. Gabriel, for his part, only nodded his greeting. "Before this is settled, however, I still have some questions."
Harry nodded vaguely and glanced down at the bracelet in his hand. It wasn't exactly flashy so it shouldn't stand out too much and he should be able to conceal it with the sleeve of his robes.
Harry's eyes took in the complete sight of his rival. They'd spent years hating each other. They'd said and done all manner of awful things to each other and yet, there he stood, feeling absolutely horrible about the whole thing. He would have thought he'd feel a little pleased that Draco had gotten some of his own back, but he didn't. It was quite the opposite. Harry was sure that if he could switch places with him and take the brunt of Draco's wounds, he would. No questions asked. The thought made him frown. Perhaps he really did have a hero complex. Whatever complex he had, however, it did nothing to relieve the overwhelming feelings moving through him; feelings that only continued to confuse him.
"I appreciate your hospitality, thank you," Lothair said, nodding his head once again. He shot Harry and Draco a brief look before he took the spot, leaving the two of them to make their way to their respective tables.
"It' strange," Gabriel responded, conversationally as he walked along with the rolling cloud of anger, "A certain level of aggression is to be expected with the lycanthropy but this is beyond anything I've experienced." He paused for a moment with a look of consideration, "Except Hendrik. He's a bit of a dick, to be honest. I mean, he's strong enough to protect the pack, obviously. Makes him a good leader, but his a surly dick. Though, I suppose that could just be my opinion. He'd probably lighten up more if his Beta wasn't always barking at him and just mate with him."
"Understand this, Elf," Roland's tone was low and just as deadly as his temper, "No one is to suspect you. Gain Potter's trust, but stay under the High Lords attention. They will not be so easily fooled." No. Soren, in particular, would be able to sniff out the deceit. Potter was the flaw in the palace. He would be the one to target. "If you fail in your task, beg the High Lords for mercy as you won't find it with me."
"He's calm for the moment," Lothair responded, eying her for a moment before letting his gaze sweep over the rest of them. "Where are their wands?" he asked. Gwynn moved and handed him the six wands in question. It took only a moment for him to scan them and verify that none of them had been used to place the curse on Harry. He wasn't surprised. A wizarding child would not have had the strength or the understanding to cast it.
"Yes, I am."
"Are you a virgin? "he asked again, his eyes lighting up with curiosity. "Maybe it's just a whole lot of sexual frustration building up."
The structure of the Kingdom was shifting. He didn't need to be within the halls of Jade Manor to know the truth of that statement. Despite their best efforts, the three High Lords were failing. Their movements were clearly visible to all those who knew what to watch for. Ilaria was flexing her muscles and the action was causing the leaves of the Kingdom to rustle. The long dead outposts of Galëgori, Zalthorián, and Antölia were beginning to stir. The thick dust that had lain peacefully over the shields of these outposts was even known being wiped clean. By the following evening bronze and silver would be shinning with the pale reflection of the moon. Unfortunately, the Realm's preemptive movements would do noting but help bring the entire Realm to its knees. The Elven Realm would fall before him and he would have his revenge. Of that, Roland had no doubt. No longer would those of the Manor disrespect him and his. The wheels were already in motion and nothing was going to get in the way. Not even the reinstatement of an untrained and useless ruler.
"There's absolutely no need for an apology," Dumbledore chuckled, his voice jubilant and friendly despite the chill Harry was getting. Finally, after what felt like hours, those blue eyes shifted from Harry to Lothair, as Dumbledore stood. "We're simply glad that you've arrived. Come, come, you must be hungry."
Harry only raised an eyebrow and turned away, moving to head back toward the inner halls of the Manor. "You may not have any regard for your own life, but I certainly won't let you kill the both of us."
Throughout everything that had happened since the passing of the last Dark Prince, Soren had remained calm and collected. He believed that the Fates had a plan crafted for the Elves. When Roland had rebelled and vowed vengeance Soren had taken it in stride. When the Kingdom had questioned the High Lords authority to protect the realm, he had carefully and calmly helped to prove their capabilities. Now staring into the eyes of a scared and angry seventeen year old he could feel his anger rising.
Draco had managed for over two months to keep himself out of the Death Eater ranks. His friends had their own marks to contemplate, many of them still looking forward to being initiated. He simply couldn't trust them enough to turn to them with his own concerns. He couldn't turn to his Mother, Lucius would never forgive any transgression from his wife and Draco couldn't risk her life. He may not appreciate his Father, but Draco did, in fact, love his Mother and he would never ask her to trade her well-being for his own. Turning to Dumbledore was laughable. There was absolutely no way the old man and his followers would accept the son of Lucius Malfoy into their folds with open arms and he wasn't going to beg in order to be granted sanctuary. Ultimately he was alone and he was running out of excuses. The Dark Lord was not a patient man.
"Soren, this is not the way," Rosalind responded, her tone angry. Harry hadn't even really had the chance to process that there might yet be a way to save the blond before Rosalind was moving behind himself and Soren, acting almost as a physical barrier between the Draco and the remaining occupants of the room. "You know better than to mess with things such as this. It must be entered into willingly by both parties. If not it will upset the balance and there will be nothing left to save. The choice is not there for the injured party. The Mother only knows what will become of the bond because of it."
Harry's irritation spiked at that. He knew that the order likely came from Rosalind, herself, but he was fine. He felt fine. More importantly, he needed to make sure that Draco was alright. He had no recollection of the other man's wounds being healed. His mouth opened to indignantly exclaim as much, but the sudden sound of growling caused him to freeze. For the briefest moment, Harry thought the sound was coming from him. Turning their heads toward the sound, they were surprised to find Draco's eyes open and the sound reverberating through his chest. From his position, Harry was almost certain the pale grey of Draco's iris' were softly glowing, but he could not be certain.
"Gladius. 30 inches. Steel alloy with obsidian influence. Not meant for brute strength, instead meant for those who are agile and quick. It also has a magical core." Again the excitement spilled out of Ilaria for all to see. The pointed look of expectation she shot Harry told him to pick up the sword. Like Draco, the moment he held the sword in his hand, everything else disappeared. The energy that flowed into him was warm and welcoming. He could smell the wind, fresh and crisp, the cool air wrapping around him. It was like being welcomed home and then it was gone, leaving Harry back in the training room, three pairs of eyes on him as he tried to regain his senses.
Harry didn't bother wondering about how Draco knew his schedule, he was much too dismayed that he would have to face off against Snape first thing in the morning when he was already two weeks behind schedule.
Soren lean back in his chair. This was another complication to an already complicated situation. "What does this mean for the boy?" he asked, nodding in Draco's direction.
"The Council?" She asked, incredulously.
She blinked, the comment coming as much of a surprise as his sudden appearance. "Excuse me?"
He froze, his breath stilling as the words washed over him. Draco had barely heard the sound of it beneath the ringing in his ears. Had it not been for Harry's lips moving, he would have sworn the man beneath him hadn't spoken at all.
At his words, the two wolves standing protectively on either side of the injured shifted forward to block Harry's view. It was clear that they would protect the third, if they had to. As far as Harry was concerned, they were wasting their time. The injured wolf they were protecting had been involved with what had happened to Draco and Harry's wasn't exactly feeling generous about it, either.
"Lothair."
Soren's posture and tone told Harry all that he needed to know. If there was another possible way, Soren would have steered him in that direction. His choice now was based on pure necessity. If Harry wanted to save Malfoy, this was what was needed. Beneath the weight of that realization, Harry could admit to being afraid. "I'm worried about the repercussions," he admitted quietly, shifting his position so he could peer past Soren's taller form and find the occupied bed at the other end of the hall. Draco, even now, looked deathly pale and that made Harry's entire body thrum with an urgent energy. "I'm worried about his reaction. It isn't going to be positive."
"But-" Harry started to argue.
"Uh, yeah-" Harry stuttered, still embarrassed. "Same."
"I'm thinking something light and fast," he commented, shooting Harry a wink before releasing his arm and moving back to his earlier casual position against the counter. He's small, but he's got a firm grip. "Maybe a Kodachi or Gladius type form. Easy to swing."
you walk away?" And that was the real question. She may not have know Harry as long as others had, but it wasn't difficult to see the answer to that question. Not with the continued presence of this Voldemort fellow in Harry's thoughts. He couldn't walk away from this world, just as he couldn't walk away from that one.
"Because I need to find my way around this monstrosity and you're going to bloody well help me do it!"
Rosalind, as she watched, made a nod of approval as the two boys reacted as they should when the process was started. They would remain unaware of the lengthy process that had been started. For them, time currently meant nothing. The older Elves, however, still had much to do. As the boys relaxed, the High Lords directed their element, one by one, to pool around them. Only once Lothair had successfully added his own element, was their strength tested. It was a tense twenty minutes, struggling to maintain balance among the elements and plead their case, but eventually the energy settled and directed it's attention toward the boys.
Glancing back up from his now straight fork, he raised an eyebrow. "If you knew that already then why are you insisting that we go with you to the library after dinner?"
"So who's this?"
Harry stood frozen in the doorway, his eyes locked on a pair of steely grey eyes.
Having only a couple of days to grow accustomed to the idea of being a ruler, it was only natural for him to experience a sharp jolt of embarrassment at the mentioning of his full title. He had grown used to the annoying title of Boy-Who-Lived, but he didn't think he'd ever grow accustomed to being referred to as the Dark Prince of the Elven Realm. Simply thinking the title left him full of apprehension and doubt. It was a significant title that he didn't think he could live up to. He briefly wondered if Dumbledore, himself, could live up to such expectations.
"Unlike you," he commented, "I didn't blab to Dumbledore about my newfound abilities, which means that as far as they're concerned I'm my usual self."
The demand snapped Gwynn out of her silent musings, causing her to take a step back when he held out the reigns of Ilaria's mount. "No, absolutely not. Ilaria will have my head on a platter before the sun rises. I will not be held responsible for stealing her horse from the Royal Stables."
What troubled him even more, however, was that they hadn't spoken about what had happened the last time they had been together and Harry was sure that Draco was still seething about it. His lie had been flimsy when he'd said that he hadn't seen anything in the blond's mind and it was unlikely that Draco had bought it.
"I have attempted to find some reference in our archives that might shed some light on the meaning of your markings, but so far I have come up empty handed. Soren has spoken with the Alpha and his Second, but they too have no knowledge of it. It truly is very peculiar," Rosalind admitted, flipping through some of the notes she had in front of her. "I do not know what to expect from you in regards to any traits that might stem from the attack. In order to heal you, Harry's blood was pumped gradually into your bloodstream. The combination of his Elven blood with the high percentage of Dragon's blood in his system should have burned out any lingering magic in your system."
"What the hell is wrong with you?" Harry grunted, trying to maneuver himself into a position to effectively unhook Draco's fingers from his shirt.
Akkar nodded and slipped back out the door, the heavy bolt securing the door locking into place behind him. Only then did Lothair's eyes return to the group in front of him. "Downstairs," he barked, ignoring the wide-eyed looks he was getting. He had more important things to worry about.
Harry blinked, but nodded. "So," understanding slowly dawning on him, "My magic will have a harder time against Ice but will be strong against those who draw upon the element of Fire?"
"What the hell is going on with you?" Draco demanded, his eyes watching Harry intently as though waiting for a confirmation for whatever it was he'd been thinking. "I know that energy was coming from you."
Draco didn't need to look up to know that Potter was glaring at him. It pleased him. Potter deserved to be irritated. Merlin knew the git irritated the rest of the world on a regular basis. If there had ever been a bigger thorn in his side, Draco had yet to find it and prayed that he never would. Ignoring the idiot, he focused his attention on the woman in front of him, keeping silent for a moment as the energy around him charged as she had warned. When it seemed to calm again, he spoke, "I was under the impression that the Elves did not interfere with our world?"
Across from him, Draco snorted. "Classes start in twenty minutes."
Harry, of course, took the challenge. "No, you're not."
Draco wanted to protest. He wanted to deny the fact that he needed any of their help, but the fear of what might still be lingering from his experience with both his father and the wolves lingered at the back of his mind. He knew his Father had not dared do anything too drastic to him, lest he be killed before the Dark Lord could have his fun. This did not, however, apply to the wolves. They frightened Draco the most. He'd felt his skin tear beneath their sharp claws, the memory fresh and agonizing. He could not be sure that he had not been bitten. The image of a rather shabby and tired looking Professor Lupin appeared before his eyes and Draco relented, nodding his consent.
"I don't plan to kill you, Draco," Lucius informed him, a maniacal gleam in his familiar grey eyes, "but you would be surprised as to what you can live through."
Turning in that direction, he made a sprint for the stairs, startling some poor first year as they were coming up late to dinner. "Sorry," he muttered, shooting down the stairs and ignoring Ron's call for him to wait up.
He glanced at Harry for a moment before going back to Lothair. "What sort of glamour?"
Beside him, Hermione rolled her eyes loudly. Harry could practically hear the exaggerated movement of her eyes in their sockets as she expressed her complete and utter exasperation. If he was honest, he was sometimes surprised that she had put up with their nonsense for as long as she had ... then again, in all fairness, it wasn't like she was innocent. She'd joined in on just as much nonsense.
"Your shot is good if you were aiming to the left of the target, Gwynn."
"It is my responsibility to ensure their safety. Having them isolated on either end of this castle may be convenient for you, but it is not for me."
The two of them clashed again and with each clash, Draco could feel the tension in the air rise. It wasn't quite the controlled build that Lothair had demonstrated earlier. In fact, it was nothing like that. It was reckless. Even as he blocked Potter's blows, he was instinctively drawing back, preparing himself for whatever backlash was coming.
Soren, seeing no further sense to an extended conversation with the wizards across from them, turned back to his own mount. Once back in the saddle, he directed his attention to Dumbledore. We shall make preparations for Draco's return. We shall notify you when he is ready to return.
He'd just opened his mouth, a scathing comment on the tip of his tongue, when an outstretched hand drew his attention. Glancing up, Harry found Gwynn standing over him, an open and friendly smile on her face as her hand remained there in a helpful offering. Harry was a bit surprised, if he was going to be honest. Gone was the fierce and focused warrior he'd just been facing. In her place stood a girl who looked just like any of his other Hogwarts friends: open, friendly, and just a bit mischievous.
Harry raised an eyebrow at that. "If you bypassed the wards in Dumbledore's office, shouldn't you be able to do it here?"
"You're not wrong," Snape responded dryly. The sound of feet scrapping in the hallway signified that they were out of time. Standing, he moved to unlock the door to the classroom. He could see the question in Draco's eyes as he moved passed him and he responded with a nod. He would continue to search for Narcissa and pass on any information that he found.
Draco chose that moment to tune out the loud conversation taking place beside him, his eyes flickering around the room as he ate. There were Elves scurrying about the place, going about their assigned jobs. Some were preparing dishes. Others were working the ovens. Some were filling large platters with food and disappearing from the room to where, Draco assumed, they would be serving breakfast to the majority of the Manor's inhabitants.
He was tempted to just keep walking. He didn't know whether or not he had the energy or even the desire to deal with Potter just then. He had a lot on his mind and, given his most recent experiences, Potter was more likely to increase the problem rather than decrease it. His hand settled on the door knob, but instead of going through as he had intended, he stilled. Perhaps he was curious? Perhaps he was a sucker for punishment? Whatever it was, Draco waited.
Letting out a frustrated huff, Harry dropped an arm over his eyes. For once in his life he could honestly say that he wasn't happy to have received an owl from his obviously worried best friend.
"Unsaddle them and let them loose."
"I suppose that would explain why they were able to find the border. Even one who was turned would have been able to scent the division if they looked hard enough," Lothair commented, his eyes turning to Soren."
She wasn't the only one startled. Suddenly there were four different wands pointed at him. Before the lot of them could hex the idiot, Draco reached out and placed a hand on Harry's chest, keeping him from advancing on Pansy and motioned with his other hand for the rest of them to lower their wands and signalling their hidden guards to stand down as well. "Relax, Potter, before you get yourself into trouble."
Then why had he been so concerned with whether or not the blond would live? Dislike would not have fed the concern.
didn't see hide nor hair of me."
The name brought Draco's world firmly back into focus. The dagger had been removed without him realizing and the entire front of his shirt was soaked with blood. Clearly Lucius has not been as careful as he'd intended. Draco was loosing blood far too quickly for it to be a clean cut, a small mercy in hindsight. If he bled to death first, perhaps Lucius, himself, would take his own place as the Dark Lord's entertainment for the evening. Movement to his left alerted Draco to Snape's presence. His hood was drawn but there was no mask covering the Potion Master's features.
"Cut the bullshit," Draco snapped, placing his hands on the tables and leaning forward. "I could
A good ten steps behind the brooding Gryffindor, Draco was rather pleased with himself for not only managing to get what he wanted, but also irritating Potter in the process. Was only fair, really. Potter had spent years irritating him. It was high time for a little payback, wasn't it? "You know," he started, a slow smirk settling on his features, "If you only had billowing robes, you'd look just like Professor Snape."
Dumbledore had lost his smile all together and Harry was pretty certain he wanted to hex Lothair ... not that he could really hold that against the old man. Harry, himself, wanted to hex Lothair on a regular basis.
"Gaudy, you mean?"
After taking another moment to suspiciously study him, Lothair turned away and headed back inside, leaving the door open for Harry to follow suit. Closing the door behind him, Harry moved further inside, his eyes scanning his surroundings. If he was honest, he hadn't been expecting the open and light atmosphere of Lothair's suite. Unlike the green and beige of his own suites, Lothair's spoke less of the forest and more of the sky. Blues, whites, and silvers created a light atmosphere that didn't fit the image Harry had of him. He'd expecting much darker colours and a more intimidating atmosphere.
"A Wizarding education is only significant if the student is, in fact, a Witch or Wizard."
"I'm sorry."
"I want you to look into the Potter heritage for me. Properties, in particular."
"Prince, huh?" the man asked, eyeing Harry as though sizing him up. His eyes didn't give anything away, so if he found himself disappointed, Harry couldn't tell. Instead, the man moved to him and offered a his hand. "I'm Daemeon. Well met."
"What the hell are you doing out here?" Draco asked, ignoring the slight embarrassment he felt about having been caught so easily.
, he thought with a sneer. He had no bloody way of contacting anyone so it really didn't matter if he was alone. If he wanted to start doing things for himself and not his father, he was going to have to start with finding his way out of his current mess. If he managed to do that, perhaps then he could make bigger plans for himself. If those plans happened to focus around avenging his mother, then so be it
"Dumbledore believes it."
"Another one of her stories, I expect." The third Elf added, smirking from his relaxed position against one of the stone columns located around the edge of the courtyard. "Perhaps she made it while she was spying on the rouge Elves?"
Following her line of sight, he spotted the fork in his hand was now bent at a ninety-degree angle. Flushing slightly, he took it and subtly bent it back into shape. "Well, I was," he argued. "You think we should start on that report Professor McGonagall gave us, but you know well enough that there's no way Ron or I are going to hole up in the library working on it when we still have two weeks before it's due."
"Molly Weasley is beside herself with worry. Would you deny her the opportunity to see that he is safe from harm?"
Once the fabric had been secured, Soren moved back to hold his earlier position. No longer sharing the space, Rosalind's words gained momentum and there was a flash of warmth at his wrist. He made to look, but with the warmth came a strong lethargic feeling. It didn't matter what was happening in the room, Harry relaxed back into the pillow, his entire body feeling much heavier than it had a moment before. His eyes were focused on the ceiling, but he did not see it. Glazed over, he relaxed back into the content feeling that was slowly spreading through him. How long he stayed like that, he couldn't say.
"It's been a while."
"Even she won't be able to fix this," Lothair scoffed. Ilaria had her ways but he honestly doubted her ability to create something that simply wasn't there. It was clear to him that the Potter boy did not want the responsibilities he had been given. Nothing, not even Ilaria, was going to change that.
By the time Harry made it to the great hall for dinner, he was still fuming and cursing the blonde idiot he'd bound himself to for all of bloody eternity. Well, maybe not eternity. That was a bit dramatic. They weren't immortal. They could die. They would die ... eventually. Eventually seemed like a very long time right about then.
She took a moment to think about how to word her response. She may not be the most delicate of females, but even she could understand from where his question stemmed. "It's nothing based on prejudice," she started, frowning slightly. "We used to. There were trade networks and everything, but that was ages ago. The human world was young then, they hadn't quite developed the taste for bloodshed that they are rumored to have now. It's not really talked about anymore, merely stressed that our detachment from that world was detrimental to the survival of the Kingdom and our race." It had been a long time since Gwynn has sat through a history lesson and it was more difficult than she'd like to admit to remember all of the details. "There was pressure for weapons and magic greater than what the humans were producing. They'd wanted us to help them win a conflict and grew angry when we refused. Many of our liaisons to that world were slain because of it. After the killings continued over the course of a year, we withdrew completely, sealing our borders to any outside of this realm."
