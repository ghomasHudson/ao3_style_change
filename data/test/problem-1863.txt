Still frowning, Harry glanced around the Potions room and sighed as he realized he had already reached the station he had been headed to, the one he would now be sharing with Malfoy for the next few months.
"But Hufflepuff was always throwing secret parties," Blaise shrugged. "We haven't been to one since sixth year, but they were always dead decent parties. Say what you like about Hufflepuffs being daft wankers, but that lot knew how to fucking have fun. That last one at the boathouse got a bit crazy."
"I did kiss you back, you know," Draco pointed out, feeling nearly dizzy as the words fell from his lips before he had even thought them through, excitement and hope rushing through his veins with every hammering beat of his buoyant heart.
being done to him. Was this a real thing people did to each other? Christ, he hoped it never stopped; he hoped Potter's tongue could stay there forever.
With a start, he realized that Draco had been the first wizard he had spoken to that had not known who he was. After Hagrid, Malfoy had been the first in the unfamiliar magical world that he had made some sort of connection with, albeit a rather unpleasant one.
"I never knew Hannah, Mandy, or Terry," he began, looking down at the table as he spoke. "All of us here were in the same year together, but I would be lying if I said that I ever attempted to reach out to anyone I did not share a House with. I knew them from classes and from the Great Hall, but I don't have a single memory of any of them that I could share." He halted, somehow seeming unaware of the rapt attention he was receiving. "But…" he glanced up to look at Michael, voice as heavy as his gaze, "I do remember the story you told, Michael. About Terry standing up to the others in defense of the Slytherin second-year. I remember hearing her tell that story to several others in the common room the day it happened, and how she had been so grateful that Terry had been there to stop it. She said that she had been so frightened, especially when he started to walk over to them, because she had been so sure that he was going to join the ones harassing her, but he hadn't. He defended her when he didn't have to. When nobody expected him to. And not very many people would have. Not very many people have ever stuck up for us. And I remember sitting there that day in the common room, wondering if I would have stopped to help her, wondering if there had ever been a point in my life when I would have been brave enough or selfless enough to step in front of an angry crowd and tell them that they were wrong. I've never really defended anybody before, let alone a stranger. And I've never, ever been able to forget that story. You were right, Michael, when you said he was a good person." Over in the corner, Harry saw Michael lower his head as his shoulders shook with silent tears.
And just when Draco thought he could take no more, that he was surely only seconds away from leaping to his feet and running from the room, Potter finally relaxed his stare, expression softening as he looked Draco in the eye, a certain warmness stealing into his gaze that Draco was positive he had never seen shining at him from Potter's normally enraged eyes. "So," the brunet started, appearing unsure of what to follow the single syllable with, "You want to chop or stir today?"
"Okay?" Draco's eyes snapped open and he stared at Harry in amazement, as though surprised that Harry wasn't pushing for more and demanding answers.
Without hesitation, he reached out to Harry, gripping him tightly as he began to lead him from the room, casting dark looks around the place as if it had housed evil and forced up repressed memories on purpose. He led Harry through a different doorway into a smaller room with pale yellow walls and white furniture. Still gripping the Auror's arm tightly, he maneuvered Harry onto a rather stiff couch and sank down beside him.
"Draco, please," Harry said quietly, and Draco looked over to find the brunet visibly upset, the sight twisting something inside Draco's chest.
of cue balls smacking together. The three of them clenched their wands tighter and stood to the side of the door as Harry tested the locked knob before rapping his knuckles against the wood, hoping no panicked spells would be fired at them. "Hey, it's Harry, Ron, and Hermione," he called. "Unlock the door, please."
"You didn't force anything on me, Potter," Draco whispered, eyes round with surprise as he stared at Harry with a look so intense Harry could practically feel it slicing into him.
made. You condemned every single one of us with your selfishness." Her smile widened into a toothy grin, one that seemed to stretch her mouth to an unnatural size, until her whole face seemed to be nothing more than sharp gleaming teeth. "And now is when we say our farewells."
He began rethinking his earlier amusement when they approached the knot of students and they all seemed to turn as one to stare at Harry in wide-eyed awe.
"Sure. Well, thanks for the concern," said Harry sardonically, attempting to adopt the same condescending drawl that every syllable of Zabini's words seemed to drip with. "But why don't you worry about your own consequences, yeah? And leave mine and Draco's up to us." And before Harry could do anything regrettably stupid, like slam his fist into Zabini's face, he turned and strode away. There was so only so much he could stand, and he had already reached his limit that day with Slytherins.
in them and you have a tendency to be far too polite to your rabid fans when really you should be telling them to just fuck off already and leave you alone, and your palate is so unsophisticated it's almost offensive! And you
Deciding to drop any pretense, Harry straightened and took a step nearer to Zabini, so close that their shoes were nearly touching. "Is that a threat?" He spoke in a quiet voice, one he had used dozens of times in his job in the past to intimidate criminals, both in the field and in interrogations.
is how you thank someone properly, Harry," Malfoy murmured, and before Harry even had time to wonder what those words meant, Malfoy stepped forward and pressed his lips to Harry's, surprising the brunet even further, which he had not actually thought could be possible at that point. Between the continued use of his given name and the warmth of Malfoy's mouth against his own, the way one hand cupped Harry's jaw as the other slid into his hair to grip the strands with gentle fingers, Harry was at a loss for what to do.
"Ron knocked it out with its own club," Potter grinned. "It was mostly luck really, since that had been the very same day we had learned how to levitate things. We most likely would've been killed if it had chosen to attack the day before."
"What are you doing?" he asked, checking the door behind her to see if he could spot a difference. It did not appear to be any different than it had been before.
The weathered path leading back to the school began sloping gently and soon had Harry gasping for breath, his lungs burning as he continued to race after Malfoy, refusing to allow himself to slow. Draco dashed into the castle ahead of him and Harry put on an extra burst of speed before wrenching open the door, but by the time he entered the building, Malfoy was nowhere in sight.
Draco," Potter sighed in exasperation. "She may not be warm and cuddly, but she's never been spiteful or petty."
about helping you gain entrance. And for—" His words were cut off as Harry interrupted with a kiss. Hearing the blond apologize was just too strange, even if he had only actually used the word
"Then the only other explanation is that those three were targeted specifically," Harry pointed out. "Either the killings are incidental and random, or the victims are being personally targeted."
. He said it was their reactions to discovering the bodies that he liked the most. He would Disillusion himself and hide close enough to watch it."
Another brief smile flashed across Harry's face before disappearing. "But what if he hates me now? Or what if he won't listen? What if he won't even look at me?"
"The report says she died from burns," said Harry slowly. "He burnt her to death?" As the words left Harry's mouth, his mind flung him back to that day three years ago when he had been surrounded by fire, flames crackling around him, leaping toward him, scorching fingers stretching upwards hotly as he tried to outfly them, choking on thick smoke as he dropped toward familiar blond hair and pulled Malfoy onto the back of his broom—he still remembered the sounds of the Slytherin's grief when he realized Crabbe had not made it out.
to see him dead; his death would bring smiles to entire scores of faceless strangers. It would bring happiness to others in a way that Draco no longer seemed capable of achieving himself anymore.
The stone entrance slid open and Harry's heart leapt with hope before crashing painfully back into his chest at the sight of Blaise Zabini. "Potter," he greeted coolly, looking down his nose at Harry with a contempt that he had never before seen on the dark-skinned Slytherin's handsome features, and suddenly he felt very nervous.
Her words were nice and Draco did not want to tell her that she was wrong, that he only had one friend in the house, in the entire world. Greg was the only one left.
Long fingers suddenly wrapped around his cock and he cried out Draco's name in surprise. At the sound, the boy above him began to rock even faster as he stroked Harry at a furious tempo. Malfoy's movements sped up and faltered as he leaned down to kiss Harry, and at the contact they both came, gasping into each other's mouths.
With an unconscious turn of his head, Draco glanced over to watch Harry out of the corner of his eye, laughing with the others and smiling in a way that Draco couldn't help but smile at.
"What does that mean?" Harry wondered, sounding confused, and Draco gave Blaise his best glare in a silent attempt to shut the stupid idiot up.
"Speaking of wankers," Pansy said cheerfully, nodding her head in the direction of the library entrance, "look who it is, Potter. Your sidekicks have arrived."
was heard quite loudly by Harry. "What you said last night…about not wanting me to forget you." He blushed and averted his gaze, but his stance, if anything, grew even more tense.
Both he and Draco had survived everything—all the horrors and the terrors and the dark lords. They were here and they were together and Harry knew that they could face anything as long as they had one another.
Slipping out of the portrait hole, he swung the cloak over himself, disappearing into the heavy darkness. It was well past curfew. The corridors were empty and Harry's footsteps echoed lightly off the stone walls as he made his way to the dungeons, pausing every now and then to check the map to make sure that Malfoy was still in Snape's office.
Draco watched the two Slytherins walk away arm in arm, and he wondered idly just how much candy they really would get through before Harry and Draco joined them.
"Harry has done nothing but love me," Draco shook his head, refusing to be intimidated by the broken shell of a man before him, "
"Do they get to go free if they're the last ones left?" Malfoy wondered curiously, eyes narrowing as Hermione and Harry laughed at him.
But Pansy had continued to spend days and nights at the Manor, spending more time in Wiltshire than she did in her own flat. She had her own set of rooms to stay in, but more often than not would end up falling asleep in Draco's massive bed as they giggled and traded gossip late into the night. The rooms that had been set aside for her still held many of her things, but Draco had sealed them off for the time being. He was not yet ready to enter them and see time frozen, everything still in the place she had left it in the last time she had been over. The last time she would ever be over.
"Well, maybe he's out of the country, too," Potter shrugged. "We'll keep trying and hope for the best in the meantime."
"Fucking good food," Seamus nodded. "Although I could've done without that hour-long speech Malfoy made at dinner about becoming reformed and listing all the war charities he's donated to and his hope that we might set aside the past in the face of a brighter future or whatever the fuck he was twaddling on about. You'd think he thought he was fucking McGonagall or something with the way he kept talking. Now
"What, you think I'm embarrassed to be seen with you?" Potter frowned, this time stepping directly in front of Draco, trying to force the blond to look him in the eye. Draco compromised by looking at Potter's chest and shrugging. "Draco, I don't care about that."
he breathed dangerously. Hermione and Ron instantly began talking loudly and shuffling the intrigued Slytherins along the corridor. "What the
Ron and Hermione listened quietly, speaking only during the sometimes long pauses that Harry would take. When he had finally thrown himself down on his bed and finished speaking, Hermione came to sit beside him on his mattress. "Harry," she began as she smoothed the hair away from his face and stroked his head. "It's okay. It's going to be okay. Draco will understand."
Malfoy was the one to answer. "Potter smashed his way out through my door." All four of them turned to look at the splintered remains of Draco's once-whole door.
"Why do you all act like we have absolutely nothing in common?" Harry asked, wondering what Draco would do if Harry were to 'accidentally' elbow him.
"Yeah, well, I promised someone I would." Shrugging uncomfortably, Harry shifted the olive folder in his grip and took a step backward.
"So are you here just to spend time with my charming self?" he grinned, leaning in further across the table. "Or is this work-related?"
Harry woke with a groan and sat up slowly. For a few dizzying moments, the room tilted and spun, but it righted itself quickly enough. Throwing back the blankets, he climbed gingerly from the bed and headed automatically to the bathroom to splash cold water on his face. Deciding he was already wet, he took a quick shower before struggling into his Auror robes and tumbling through the Floo.
Harry! And of course you'll do something unnecessarily fucking rash, like touch some cursed fucking object and then probably fucking die, and I'm not risking your life, P, so suck it the fuck up and let's go."
With an angry sigh, Harry kicked at the nearest stone wall in frustration. Whatever the reason behind the forced touches or the pitying comfort, it never made Harry feel anything but uncomfortable. But, like the trusting, naïve git that he was, he had taken it all in stride, borne it all in polite suffering and ignorant silence, only for Slughorn to turn around and do something like
Then again, a week later, Harry had rounded a corner in the library only to come face-to-face with a startled Malfoy. They had both frozen automatically and stared at one another for long moments, neither saying a word. Harry wasn't sure what he felt as he gazed into the silvery depths of Malfoy's eyes. Gone was the animosity he had once felt towards the insufferable blond—there was simply no hatred left to feel for the boy who had once actively made his life a living hell. Not after everything he had seen Malfoy go through, or the way he had held his head high as his father was sentenced to life in Azkaban, eyes bright with tears that Malfoy blinked back, never allowing a single one to fall; tears that Harry had never been sure sprang from sadness or relief. He had no idea how Malfoy felt about his father, or how he felt about anything, really. All he knew was that he could no longer hate the silver-eyed Slytherin. Especially not after seeing those grey eyes wide with fear, sunk deep in a too-thin face, framed by blackened circles and sharp cheekbones and yet still refusing to identify him.
A grin slid across Harry's face before he even had time to register his amusement. "And I'm willing to accept responsibility for someone as pretentious as
One leg slipped off Seek's shoulder as Draco's knees shook, his entire body feeling molten and tingling as Seek finally pulled out only to drive back in immediately, sending sharp stabs of pleasure radiating throughout Draco's core. He repeated the motion, pulling back to look Draco in the eye as he slid in and out, over and over, a fierce look on his face as he stared at Draco with dark eyes.
Slipping back under the silk covers of his sheets, Draco gazed around the dark room uneasily. Everything Potter had told him over the past fortnight tumbled through his brain, denying him sleep. It was an interesting feeling, knowing that some faceless killer was out stalking the night, intent on seeing Draco dead. And not just dead, but torn apart. Was that how Potter had felt their entire adolescence? Feeling as if death was coming for him from every corner? Peering out at him everywhere he went? At least when the Dark Lord lived in the Manor, Draco had known where the danger was and what to expect. But this was different. Whatever this was, it had killed four people already, four of Draco's friends. And it still wanted Draco.
"I've never been creepy a day in my life!" Blaise said firmly. "You two are the creepy perverts, running around sucking each other off in fucking cupboards!"
It was silent. The blackness felt heavy and suffocating; Harry could feel it pressing against him from every direction, weighing down on him like a thick cloak and smothering him beneath its weight. Where was it coming from? This was not a natural lack of light—it was still morning and nearly an entire wall of the sitting room was
"Well, I meant…" Draco took a deep breath, "it won't be just any bloke they'd see you kissing, Potter. It would be me. And the Muggles don't care, but the same most certainly cannot be said of the world we actually live in."
"For the last time!" she sighed in exasperation. "I am not hexing walrus tusks on anybody! Just go look the spell up yourselves if you're so desperate to see it used!"
"That's sick," Harry whispered, feeling horrified. "Your parents would really have made you marry someone you don't even love?
"Yeah?" Draco felt one corner of his mouth pull up in a smirk. "You gonna be the one to tell him all that?"
"Isn't the reason obvious?" Blaise asked in amusement, "Clearly it's because of our extreme level of maturity and overwhelming love and respect for nature. Pansy is a flamingo because she sounds like one, Draco is a hedgehog because he's a bit spikey and thinks he's dangerous even though he's far more likely to curl into a ball at the slightest sign of danger, and I am a cheetah because, well," he gestured down at himself, "
Pulling out his wand, he bent down to kiss Malfoy, whispering a spell into his mouth and smiling to himself at the yelp Malfoy made in response as his clothing suddenly vanished and he was left without a stitch on.
Harry heard the words; Hermione and Dumbledore had both told him similar things: it wasn't his fault, Voldemort had tricked him, Sirius had made his own decision to go to the Ministry. But Harry knew who was really to blame. If he hadn't been so reckless, rushing in without a moment's hesitation, if he had just
"You think we're drinking through a hangover for the fun of it?" Blaise asked, raising one eyebrow. "Hair of the dog, Potter, hair of the fucking dog. Helpful advice, not just pretty words."
?" At the accusation, Draco flinched and Harry laughed, a sharp laugh of bitter disbelief. "You hired your own sodding fucking Tracker to hunt down Crabbe, is that it?" Ice had settled into Harry's veins, into his heart, into his words. "You don't trust me to do my job at all, do you? You have absolutely no faith in me."
Gritting his teeth, Draco prayed for calm, feeling Harry's hand tighten around his fingers. He could practically feel the waves of rage rolling off the brunet.
Draco could hear the sounds of Seek locking the door behind him as he gazed around, committing everything in sight to memory. The hallway was a warm amber brown, with honeyed trim and copper carpeting. Draco wandered into the sitting room, staring in interest at the photographs on the mantle above the small fireplace, and the photos in frames upon the wall. There were several pictures of an older man with glasses who looked remarkably like Seek, always standing beside a very pretty woman with flowing auburn hair. Several of them showed the couple proudly holding a chubby raven-haired infant between them, and Draco smiled at the sight of baby Seek. The mantle was full of pictures of a teenaged Seek standing with a tall, handsome man with long black hair falling in a sleek sheet to his elbows. He had his arm thrown around Seek in most of the pictures and was grinning brightly at the camera.
Harry laughed and Draco shrugged. "As long as it's by his side." Ron looked somewhat alarmed by the statement, but Hermione only smiled at his horrified expression.
Still chuckling, Harry shook his head. "As if Slytherins are any less wrong than the rest of humanity."
"Well," Harry began quietly, "all I really knew of Slytherin when I was first sorted was that that was the House that the man who had killed my parents had been in. And I didn't want to be connected to him in any way. I mean, I was already connected to him through my wand, you know? And that already felt like way too much, so…"
"No, Father!" Draco shouted, jumping to his own feet to stare Lucius in the eye with two-decades worth of anger pouring from him. "For once in my life, I am going to tell you what I'm thinking and you are going to listen!"
With a sigh, he finally opened his eyes, only to jump in surprise. Potter had left the settee and wandered over to the piano, standing so close to Draco that the blond's first reaction was anger at himself for not having heard the Auror approach, even if he had been playing a loud instrument at the time. But the way Potter was staring at him was making it difficult to focus on that self-directed anger—or anything at all, really, for that matter.
"Thank you for coming with me today," he said in a subdued voice, swallowing thickly and praying for his nerves to settle before the upcoming meeting. Lord, was he really about to do this?
"Bedroom?" I whisper, slipping a hand beneath his t-shirt and running my fingers lightly along the warm skin of his back.
Pansy raised both eyebrows at him. "And you really think Potter's going to just sit there and allow it? Now you're just being ridiculous, Draco."
"Aldrich Chatham," she told him, still smirking. "He was two years ahead of us, remember? They re-met a few months ago. And damn, is she lucky," Pansy sighed. "He was the tall muscly one with the dark hair."
But as the man continued to stare, one eyebrow barely raised, Draco realized he was still waiting for a response. Clearing his throat, he kept his gaze fixed firmly on the carpet as he spoke, "The same time I adjusted the wards to allow you and Weasley in. I figured I may as well give the entire Golden Trio access."
"Do you really think this is just a power outage?" Ron asked in a low voice, glancing back at Goyle and Malfoy, who were both peering anxiously around themselves.
Finally, after an eternity, the lock on the door clicked open. Everybody froze, staring at the knob with wide eyes. Hermione's back was a rigid steel bar as she stared at the door, breathing hard. She raised her wand and murmured several spells, what sounded to be a shield charm and a few wards of her own, before nodding to Ron, who took up point behind her. Harry and Neville automatically stepped up beside them, the four Gryffindors falling seamlessly into position. Hermione glanced to the three men standing beside her, nodding to them once before raising her wand and murmuring a final spell, everybody watching as the door swung open.
"There's no way anybody would be able to enter through a bedroom," Draco reminded him. "The wards will keep everybody who is not Daphne out, unless she extends an open invitation, such as now," he gestured around. "And it's impossible to enter through the balcony, regardless. The ground's wards prevent such a thing, besides the fact that whoever sent it would first have to get past the gates and the wards there. These grounds are not easily breached, I assure you."
Fighting the grimace Harry could feel threatening to break across his face at the attention, he climbed to his feet and went to meet Dean, who had left the office and was striding toward him.
"I didn't see you yesterday," Potter continued, a frown in his voice. "I looked for you after dinner."
Draco's vision began to blur as tears filled his eyes, slowly slipping down his cheeks as he looked down at the tombstone and thought of the many friends he had failed. "Do you think it's true, Harry? What they say about Slytherins? Are we forever fated to be the villains? Is it a certain sign of Darkness to be placed in Slytherin? And the culprit was not just one, but two Slytherins. Is the nation right when they say we're destined to be evil? Are we really just as heartless and unfeeling as everybody seems to believe?"
"Right," Justin frowned at him, "yeah, okay." Without another word, he turned and headed toward the door Malfoy pointed at, opening it and glancing back at Harry one last time before disappearing into the room.
, Pansy! I'm sorry I couldn't save you, I'm sorry you're not here. I would give anything for you to be here with me," he whispered, falling silent as the tears came faster and faster, choking him until he could hardly breathe through the anguish. For over an hour, he sat by her tombstone, weeping into the ground beneath him as he uttered apologies and regrets, telling her about everything that had happened and how right she had been about Daphne.
"Have either of you heard anything?" Harry wondered. "Any footsteps, voices, doors opening or closing?"
How long has he been shagging her without my knowledge? "And we both just needed a break from dancing," he continues.
? Fuck you very much, Potter! I knew I should have identified you at the Manor and been done with it!"
"What do you mean?" Draco stopped in his tracks, staring at Blaise oddly. "How would I earn back my reputation? You think I should spread rumors around the school about him crushing on me?"
"Hello all!" a voice said brightly, and Draco glanced up to find Blaise beaming down at them with a smiling Harry standing beside him. "There you two sneaky little chipmunks are! Potter and I have been searching positively everywhere for the two of you!"
Harry said nothing, simply holding him tighter, moving in closer, and Draco tried to wipe at his eyes as subtly as possible. But then Harry had to go and destroy any illusion of subtly Draco was trying to convince himself he had by grasping at Draco's hand and feeling the evidence of tears clinging to his wet fingertips.
Groaning, Harry shook his head frantically, as though he could forever shake from his brain the memory of hearing Caelix describe Snape as sexy
"And cracking first as a result of that suspicion," Harry finished. "And there's no way that only one or two of them could be involved without the others becoming aware, because of how tight-knit they all are."
"All right, Harry," Hermione said, and he could practically hear the eye roll in her words. He began to feel extremely nervous, however, as the next sound he heard was the sharp, metallic sound of scissors opening and closing.
her; she had been one of the only members of the D.A. to answer his call for help, risking her life for him on a suspicion that had been wrong, and had never blamed him or made him feel bad for nearly getting them all killed for a lie. She had always shown up when he needed her; she had never turned her back on him or ever made him feel bad about himself.
His potion that day was even worse than usual thanks to his limited focus, but he may as well have brewed nothing for the attention Slughorn gave it. Another fucking O. Why even bother showing up to the fucking class at all? It made no difference what he did, so it should make no difference if he was even there.
"Harry." The voice sounded exasperated now, and Harry shot a rude hand gesture over his shoulder, yelping when the pillow and blanket were suddenly tugged away and he was left cold and uncomfortable.
"Yeah, unfortunately," Smith muttered nearby, and Harry wanted to groan in frustration as Zabini took an automatic step in his direction.
Grinning, Dean jerked his head toward a table in the center of the room. "He's the one wearing blue."
"I don't see you like that." His words were firm and Malfoy glanced up at him. "The Mark on your arm? You were a fucking child, Malfoy, influenced into a certain way of thinking since birth, following in your father's footsteps and orders—just as I followed in Dumbledore's. I'm no longer who I was at that time and neither are you." His hand slid up Draco's neck to cup his cheek tenderly. "It's who we are now that matters. And who I am now wants you in my life."
Harry rolled his eyes. "Yes, Nott, we know, there's nothing you trust less in this world than emotion."
After entire minutes had passed, Susan Bones rose slowly to her feet. "Hannah was my best friend," she began, face already wet with tears. "She was the nicest person I've ever met. She never spoke down to anyone or ever said a single negative thing about another person. Once, when I was sick and had to stay in the Hospital Wing for three days, she went around to all the professors and got the homework assignments I had missed, then tracked down people from all of my classes we didn't share together to get their notes. She brought me all the books I would need for the essays and sat with me in the Hospital Wing for hours going over the lessons with me and making sure I understood everything I had missed." Her voice broke as a sob tore from her throat. "We would spend weeks quizzing one another before exams. We ate every single meal at school together. She was the person I sat next to on the boat our very first night of Hogwarts. I was so happy when we both got sorted into Hufflepuff. She was normally so quiet and shy, but she cheered the loudest when I went over to the table and sat next to her. She gave me a hug and told me we were meant to be friends." Susan's voice thickened as the tears fell faster, and Lisa reached out to grip Susan's hand tightly. "She was always talking about f-fate and destiny," she gave a choked laugh, "always reading romance novels and talking about what the future held in store for everybody. She believed that ev-everything always happens for a reason, but…" Susan paused to sob loudly, nearly choking on the force of her tears, "but this w-wasn't meant to happen. None of this was m-meant to happen; my best friend was not meant to be m-m-murdered like that. This was not fate; it wasn't destiny. It wasn't her d-destiny to be killed, and it wasn't my destiny to watch my b-best friend bleed to death r-r-right in front of me! I just want to understand," she whispered, collapsing back into her chair and weeping into her hands. Lisa wrapped an arm around her shoulders as she used her other hand to wipe her own tears from her face. The room fell back into silence, and Harry looked over to the Slytherins to find them grim-faced and pale, Tracey trying rather futilely to hide her red eyes.
"Oh, you should hear what Draco says about his eyes," Blaise laughed. "What was it, Draco? Something about flashing eyes like emerald summer and hair like blackest midnight?"
That night at dinner, several Slytherins and more than one Ravenclaw glanced in Draco's direction curiously, but there were no shocked gasps, no judgmental glares, no hissed threats. Even the suspicious looks he had grown used to receiving did not appear to be more than usual. Draco was finally able to release the breath he had been holding since the second they had been spotted in the library. For the moment, it didn't seem as though it had yet gotten around the school.
"Having just as much fun as everyone else, Smith," Zabini drawled sarcastically, glaring at the Hufflepuff. "What the fuck does it look like?"
Chuckling softly, Caelix nodded. "All right, Harry, I promise." His eyes seemed to glow blue in the dim lighting and Harry suddenly realized how long he had had his hand on the man. He snatched his fingers back and jammed both fists into the front pockets of his jeans, taking a step back from both Caelix and the house.
Smith turned his enraged eyes on Harry, opening his mouth to speak before he was cut off by the sound of Michael's voice. "Yeah, Smith, great idea, go ahead and goad Harry Potter. You do realize he's a trained Auror, don't you?"
"Oh," Draco said in surprise, taken aback that Seek really did want him to make a decision that affected the both of them. Would Draco ever stop being surprised at how different the man was from Fenrir? "Er, I dunno. What would you like to do?"
and make them stop printing this issue immediately! And then we need to go around and collect every single paper that managed to make it into a single person's hands. And then we need to Obliviate those people." The other three stared at him. "Well?" he asked impatiently. "What are you waiting for? We have a lot of work ahead of us, let's go! We can each take a table and start Obliviating. I'll start with Slytherin, you lot go get started on the other Houses."
"They're not a bad sort," Harry shrugged, rubbing the back of his neck. For some reason, he did not want to admit how okay he really was being around the five Slytherins.
"I know you don't want the apology," Harry panted, staring Draco directly in the eye without blinking, "But I need to say it. I really am sorry, Draco. If I could take back anything I've ever done in my entire life, it would be that day. I had no idea what that spell did and I never should have cast it." As he spoke he dropped one hand to Draco's chest, caressing the skin with gentle fingers as though proving to himself it really was whole and unmarred. The other hand still cupped Draco's cheek tenderly, one soft thumb tracing over Draco's lips in silent, featherlight patterns. "I had nightmares about it for years," his voice dropped, so low that Draco was having trouble hearing the heart-wrenching confession. "Still do, sometimes," his voice lowered even further, sounding hoarse and pained. "You always die, in every single one of them. They're always the same—I curse you and you fall and then I just stand there and watch you die. I kill you every time." His words were heavy with grief, the broken tone making the man sound so much older than he really was.
Harry felt his frustration growing with every new door they passed, every set seeming more intriguing than the last, and he wanted to yank them all open in turn to discover what lay beyond the threshold. But Malfoy had not slowed his pace and Harry felt it would be rude to begin running through his home all of a sudden, tearing open doors to peer inside before sprinting to the next one; he had no intention of making such a scene.
Harry shook his head in amusement. "You do realize that we're the last ones left in here, don't you?"
"Are you all right?" Harry demanded, peering closely at the blond. "Fuck, I knew I shouldn't have let you go off by yourself like that! I swear to god, I don't care how many business deals I lose you, you are
in here…it feels like Snape is watching, you know?" He glanced around uneasily as though expecting Snape to jump out and start deducting House points.
Hasty goodbyes were being said around him and Harry was snapped out of his woeful daze just as Ginny stood.
"Tough," was Blaise's only response. "Because I'm not going anywhere until we talk. I will follow you all over this goddamn castle if I need to, Potter. I'm telling you right now, I will be everywhere you are until you finally give in and speak with me. It would save us both a hell of a lot of time and energy if you just give in now."
Deciding to ignore the fact that that would mean that Zabini could not possibly be the killer if he had been able to have been in the Manor for so long without detection, Harry finished tugging on his clothing before turning to address Pibby. "Where's Ron?"
"Did you tell your sidekicks then?" Draco wondered, trying to fight the urge to yank Potter up against him. "About the two of us?"
His hand fell away from Malfoy's and he felt unexplainably bereft at the loss of contact. "Well, it's just—I haven't seen you on your own really at all this year. I wasn't sure any of you lot went off by yourselves anymore."
"I…" Malfoy looked utterly baffled. "I'm not sure that I understand the question. I'm not sure if there isn't anything I wouldn't be willing to do. I mean, are you looking for me to say that I wouldn't be willing to slaughter an innocent person or something?"
"YOU KILLED BLAISE!" Draco screamed, directing his anger toward Daphne and feeling the blood streaming down his arms as he twisted and writhed against the chains still holding him. "YOU KILLED PANSY! YOU FUCKING CUNT, I'LL FUCKING KILL YOU!"
Nobody said a word, the silence stretching into minutes as Harry waited for the disgust and the reprimands to begin.
"I don't care," Goyle responded, breathing heavily. "I don't fucking care. You say it wasn't fair that they died? Well, I say it wasn't fair that my best friend had to die, either. And it wasn't even enough that I lost my only friend in the entire world—no, the entire world had to make sure I was reminded of just how much he
Fortunately for everyone, it was very possible to break, considering the fact that Draco had absolutely no plans to continue the Malfoy line, no matter what his father had drilled into him from a young age—that the Malfoy line is important above all else, and its continuance is the absolute priority of any Malfoy heir.
The knocking continued. Whoever it was had already gained access to the sitting room of his chambers, which meant that the private ward on his rooms had recognized them and allowed them entrance.
"I don't know, Harry," Hermione said, biting her lip. "I really don't think that's a good idea, I really don't think you should be alone right now."
"Er, right," Potter said, a furrow appearing between his eyes, but Draco thought he could see the brunet fighting a smile. "Well, hello then, Zabini. Parkinson." He nodded to them both in turn before smiling at Draco and shooting the arm Blaise had wrapped around Draco's shoulders with another pointed look. "Well, we should probably get going, Draco. We'll all, er, have to catch up another time, I s'pose."
"You know that you would miss our conversations terribly if you and Draco ever broke up," Blaise told him. "We are your best and most favorite form of entertainment, Potter, and don't you dare try to deny it. We're the spark in your life and you fucking know it. So deal with it."
—Draco's every movement was appreciative and sensual, every caress against Harry's flesh affectionate, undemanding,
"Of course," she frowned, "that doesn't necessarily mean there is no Polyjuice in the house. There are spells to prevent objects from being summoned."
"No," Draco said in a choked voice, the desperate word sounding as though it had been wrenched forcefully from his throat. "Oh, god,
"Oh, please," Weasley snorted. "Who the hell would have ever guessed the real truth? We had a confession from the one we thought was guilty, who would have second-guessed it?"
"I still can't believe you're spending so much time with that lot," Ron shook his head. "I mean, what the hell do you even talk about with them?"
"Fen broke his whole hand," Draco corrected Pansy. The unknown man had never shown his face at another party after that night. Draco couldn't help but wonder what Wolf would do to someone who raised a violent hand to Draco. To be honest, he didn't really think he wanted to know.
"Oh my god," Hermione said in a shocked voice, and Harry tried to hurry to her side, feeling as though he was running through a pool of drying cement. Everything was moving in slow motion; why wouldn't his legs move faster?
Well, he was angry, all right. He was angry at Oliver for having made a move on him and he was angry at Draco for having foreseen that and been correct, but mostly he was angry at himself for having allowed things to progress to that.
"Draco," a deep voice drawled, and Draco's entire body froze in the bathroom doorway. Fenrir was only several feet away, lounging on the bed with his boots off. Draco shifted uncomfortably, thankful that he had already dressed in the bathroom.
"You're not the Wizengamot, you know," Harry glared, finally sitting up and beginning to get dressed, "you don't get to pass bloody verdicts on people."
"That shows what either of you two sorry dickheads knows," she sniffed. "I'm a right fucking gorgeous catch and either of you would be lucky to have me if either of you actually deserved me. Stupid arseholes."
Fuck. Draco had no idea, and he knew that he was unlikely to ever really find any of the answers he so desperately needed to the barrage of questions flooding his mind and weighing him down. It was as though a storm had blown through Draco's mind, bringing confusion down like rainwater and filling his skull until he felt drowned beneath the never-ending deluge of mixed emotions. And his fear was the anchor holding him under, keeping him trapped under the filthy water until his lungs were screaming for air, but what was the point in screaming if nobody could hear? Water filled his mouth every time he tried, and he was no longer certain he could ever fight his way free.
—but he wanted every single piece of Harry that the man was willing to offer. He wanted Harry all to himself, no matter what the rest of the world desired. They could desire Harry all they wanted, but Draco was the only one who could touch him, the only one who could kiss him, and the only one who could earn a shiver from him for the simple act of running one finger lightly down the brunet's spine.
"Are you all right?" Draco asked hesitantly, glancing at Ron, who was glaring daggers back at the blond.
"It's fine," she said stiffly, and Draco decided to take a page from Potter's book, stepping in front of her and forcing her to a halt.
The words caused Harry to freeze, and Draco wanted to cry when the man straightened, although he did not loosen his tight hold on Draco's waist.
, Harry thought vehemently, deciding that if Malfoy was going to cheat by moaning Harry's own bloody name like that instead of fighting fair by sticking to the well-known and clearly-established surnames rule that Harry had been rightly sticking to since its invention, then Harry may as well also get something out of it.
"Yeah, but I almost killed you!" Harry said, looking incredulous. "You would have died if Snape hadn't been there!" Startling Draco, Harry kissed him suddenly, seizing his face between two palms as though terrified that the blond really had died that day and the Draco before him was a figment of Potter's regretful imagination.
"Looking good today, babes," Tracey grinned, glancing up and down Pansy's body, and Draco wanted to laugh at the way Pansy blushed just the slightest bit.
"Yes, Master Draco, sir," Pibby squeaked excitedly, vanishing with another crack. Pibby, at least, was excited about the three guests staying at the Manor.
"Who else would it be though?" Ron wondered. "I mean, Smith was right. They were the only other two in the room."
"Make them all stop staring!" Draco ground out. "All of—" he flapped his hand around the large room, "
"Oh, and Blaise?" Harry's heart began to pound wildly as Draco appeared in the doorway in his pyjamas, glaring down the hallway at the figure of the retreating man. "Fuck you."
Without another word, Harry grasped Draco's hips tighter before spinning him around and throwing him to the bed. He clambered between his legs, pushing his thighs apart to make more room. Draco's eyes were wide with surprise but a soft smile curved his lips, and Harry couldn't resist reaching out to trace their shape with one finger.
"Oh," Caelix said softly, and Harry cracked one eye open to give him a sardonic stare. "Can I ask you a question, Harry? One you promise not to take offense at?"
Harry stared at him. "You know," he finally said, "I'm beginning to become a bit worried at how much you seem to think about mine and Draco's sex life. Surely there are other things in this world worth thinking about?"
"But he didn't mean to," Greg responded automatically. "He didn't know he couldn't control the fire or he never would have started it. We were his friends, he would never try to hurt us." His words sounded so sure and Draco wanted so badly to believe them, but he was just not as certain. Ever since childhood, Draco had known that Vincent had a cruel, sadistic side, one planted within him by his father and watered by abuse from the man's hand. It was of course possible that Vince had truly not known that Fiendfyre was impossible to control and did not mean to endanger the lives of his only two friends, but it was also just as likely that he had simply not cared.
"No," Parkinson finally said, shaking her head. "I would feel much safer sleeping in Draco's room again."
"All right," Draco sighed, unpeeling himself from Harry's back and climbing from the bed before turning around to face the opposite wall. His trousers were already unfastened so it was a simple thing for Draco to push them down, allowing them to fall to his ankles. Taking a deep breath, Draco pushed down the tight grey underwear he was still wearing and stepped from the tangle of fabric piled around his feet until all Harry could see was endless acres of porcelain skin, and he felt his breath catch at the sight.
"Who knew you were such a closet romantic?" Potter mused, kissing his temple lingeringly. "I love it."
Weasley frowned at her but obediently clinked glasses with everyone before tossing back the shot, and Draco wanted to laugh at the redhead's grimace if he wasn't already busy gulping down a mouthful of juice.
"It's quite all right," Draco dismissed. "But due to the…er, falling out, I'm not even sure if his mother will tell him I'm looking for him."
"They waited until we had all left that room," Malfoy continued in a whisper. "They wanted us to find him like that. They're fucking
Rolling his eyes in return, Potter stood and cocked an eyebrow. "So, let's check out these defenses you say are better than anything the Ministry can come up with."
"Sure, Malfoy," Weasley agreed, leaning back in his chair. "Same toward you, as far as Zabini goes."
and asked if I could have them. Nobody over there even believed it was really me at first," he said with a laugh. "They thought I was some pervy imposter who wanted the photos to wank over or something, I dunno. I ended up having to ask McGonagall if I could borrow her office to Floo them. And I can't even tell you how awkward it was to have to explain to her why I needed to contact the paper." He laughed again. "But they gave me all the originals and even a bunch of photos that never made it to print."
As Crabbe finally pulled the knife free and turned to face him, Harry snapped the lid off the small bottle and managed to get his finger in the correct position before Crabbe charged at him with a wild scream, brandishing the knife high above his head and slashing the weapon through the air as he ran at the Auror. Pressing down with his index finger, Harry covered his nose and mouth with one hand as he sprayed nearly half the bottle of burning liquid in the man's face. The moment Harry did, a twisted, agonized scream tore from Crabbe's mouth, his eyes clenching shut as he fell backward, the knife dropping from his hand. He scrabbled uselessly at his face, scratching at his closed eyelids as he screeched and wailed.
Malfoy stared at him for several seconds before he unexpectedly burst out laughing. "I suppose part of it was, yes," he chuckled, and Harry was relieved that he had not gotten angry. "There was always something thrillingly forbidden about reading Muggle novels. Even now," he reached out and ran one finger down a spine lovingly, "when there is no danger of being caught with an Oscar Wilde book, I still get a rush just from the act."
Fenrir's frown deepened. "And you need to go all the way out to meet him? Why? Why can't you just do it all over the phone?"
Harry nodded, pretending to understand what any of those words meant. He had no idea where Draco was going with this story, but he found himself leaning closer as he hung on Malfoy's every word.
. Harry felt a blush sear his cheeks as a matching one spilled across Draco's features at the same moment a fierce glare fixed onto his face, one that Nott seemed unaffected by.
"Oh yeah?" Harry shifted closer, pulling Draco back against his body and resting his chin on Draco's shoulder. "Will you always take anything I give you so easily, then?"
"We still have no idea where Stephen is," Harry pointed out, feeling discomfort swirl through his gut at the reminder. What if that's who he had chased through the corridor last night? What if Stephen had somehow broken into the room the Hufflepuffs were in while all three men were sleeping? What if he had Disillusioned himself before hiding away in that room all night, waiting for them to fall asleep? What if the three Hufflepuffs had inadvertently warded the real killer inside with them? It would have been so easy for him to escape the room after Zacharias had Stunned Justin and fled to find Harry.
"Well, it stops now," Harry said, sounding far more determined than Draco was sure he should feel. How could Harry make strangers stop hating Draco? "I mean, look at this article, Draco! The one on the front page doesn't say anything derogatory about you! Or about me for being with you! So maybe now that people know we're dating, they'll stop looking at you so negatively! Even Pansy and Blaise as well!"
"Thank you," Harry said unexpectedly. "For making the effort. I know that you lot still aren't necessarily getting along with one another, but I appreciate that you really are trying for me, Draco."
men, right? It just meant that Blaise came up with stupid plans that had no actual bearing on reality.
"I know," Harry agreed miserably, lowering his head. "I was going to last night, I swear I was really going to! I was going to be completely honest with Caelix, and Draco had promised that we would speak when he got back, and I was going to talk to him about it then! But then…it just—it just—it just
"No," Harry shook his head. "No, not tonight. He's asleep anyway, Pomfrey gave him a potion to help him sleep through the night. But…but I want to be there when he wakes up. I want to be the one to tell him. I
"Yeah," Harry nodded. "I mean, I'm warning you right now that I'll most likely be absolute rubbish at it." Malfoy shook his head and laughed, and Harry couldn't help but return the grin. "But I want to at least try. I mean, I'm not really sure where people actually
"Course," they responded simultaneously, turning to grin at one another, and Harry wanted to laugh. No matter how many things had changed since school, some things still refused to. It was nice to see that sort of consistency.
"Come on," Harry murmured, "We found her. Let's go find Ron and Neville now, yeah?" He removed his arm from Malfoy's grasp and slipped his fingers into it instead. The blond was pulled gently but quickly from the room, and only once they were back out in the hallway again was it that Harry heard Draco take a breath.
Glancing over, Draco watched as Potter's arm swung slightly as he walked, and he couldn't help but look down at the hand attached to it. Draco thought back to Blaise's words about holding hands with Potter in public, and he couldn't help but wonder what it would feel like to walk down a street like the one they were on holding hands with another person.
The absurd question made Draco snort. As if he could've missed it. "If only I could somehow avoid seeing it," he drawled, brushing some of the confetti drifting from the ceiling off his shoulder.
upset about it?" He felt desperate to shatter the intensity of that gaze. "You're off the team too, after all."
"Not quite," she said crisply, crossing her arms as she surveyed him. "We need to hear what happened again, Zacharias.
"I can't stand this, Draco, I can't stand knowing that you're still there. I can't stand knowing he's hurt you. I'm coming to get you right now!"
More tears fell from Harry's eyes at the reminder. He studied the floor as he answered, unwilling to look Draco in the eye. "Looks like we both lied then, huh?" Neither of them said anything for several moments.
Without warning, the lamps were suddenly doused as a dozen lit candles flickered into view, startling everyone in the room. Hermione rose from her seat and gazed around at everyone in quiet speculation. "Some of you suggested we hold a memorial service," she began softly, gaze flicking around the room, "for the three we've lost so far—Hannah, Mandy, and Terry." Heads bowed at her words, a sad, somber air settling over everything. "I think we should start with a moment of silence, and then open the floor for anyone who would like to say something. However," her eyes narrowed as she stared at everyone in turn, "this is a memorial service, so I would ask that everything said here remain respectful and free from accusation. This is not a time for confrontation. Am I understood?" Heads dipped in acknowledgment, and Hermione relaxed. "All right then. A moment's silence, and then whoever would like to start can do so."
"You mean blind fucking cowardice," Zabini corrected. "I'm not sure if I've ever met a person so ruled by fear before. He's a danger to everyone around him."
"I assure you," Draco began, his mouth opening to speak before he even knew what he intended to say, "that the Manor is extremely well-protected. You're safe here."
?! Just so we could be seen together in public? You never actually felt anything for me, Draco, did you? You never felt a single goddamn thing for me. You were never interested in dating
"I—I dunno," Harry lied. The other boy raised a pale eyebrow, both at the stammer and at the obvious lie. Who was Harry kidding—he knew exactly which student held his interest. And if he was being honest with himself, Malfoy had always held his attention. He had always noticed Malfoy, always been aware of the other boy's presence—never more so than at that moment, however.
"No," Draco shook his head, "they really do genuinely like you, Potter. They wouldn't make fun of you so much if they didn't."
"No," Harry shook his head. "You two need to stay here and keep everyone from panicking. And keep Smith from talking as much as possible. Just keep everyone calm and I'll go find the Slytherins and bring them back, all right?"
At the statement, Potter made a weird sound, a sort of groaning laugh, and Draco smiled again. "So," Potter panted, pulling back far enough to speak, "can I tell Hermione and Ron then? That we're dating?"
Zabini smirked. "I would have thought that would be obvious, Potter." Harry's eyes narrowed in suspicion; was Zabini saying that Harry should be in charge? The man continued speaking. "Other than Abbott, Brocklehurst, and Boot, whom we can all rule out as the killers for obvious reasons, the only other ones outside of ourselves that I would say are innocent are you and your two friends."
"Let's speak in the hallway," Harry suggested, feeling uneasy as he looked back at Zacharias. What had Hermione found?
Smiling softly, Draco shook his mind. "No, Harry, I don't mind. I will admit that it's a rather daunting prospect of facing the nation knowing that the only people who approve of our relationship are the two of us, but…"
Chuckling, Harry shrugged. "Your fault for trying to eat around us when we clearly have sexual favors to discuss. Lots of sexual favors."
"What?" Draco gaped as Blaise sighed loudly and tossed Pansy a Galleon from his bedside table. "The two of you bet on us?"
"We didn't find them until we were nearly back to the lounge," Hermione frowned. "I don't know how we could have missed them initially, but we found them near the staircase."
Draco shrugged his narrow shoulders helplessly. How would he have any idea what McGonagall was thinking? For all he knew, she had allowed him back in just to wait for him to mess up so she could exact swift and vicious vengeance.
"A flamingo slag?" Harry raised one eyebrow in amusement. "Um, what does that even mean? Can flamingos even
"I hope it was worth it," Harry said in a voice as low and pointed as his glare was hot and sharp, and Draco could see the hurt he was trying his best to hide. "I hope you're proud of yourself, Malfoy. I mean, you pulled it off, didn't you? Congratulations, you won." He laughed that same twisted, bitter laugh. "And all for your fucking social standing. Well," his voice broke, and Draco's vision blurred as he tried desperately to blink the tears from his eyes before they fell, "I hope you're happy with it. I just hope it didn't disgust you too badly to pretend to like me long enough to gain it back. I hope I didn't repulse you too much in the process." His eyes were as glassy as Draco's felt—hot and bright and blinding. Everything was blinding. Everything burned. Everything was shiny and blurry and harsh—the entire world felt so harsh. "You three can go to hell." And with that, Harry strode angrily past them, keeping as far away from Draco as possible in the narrow corridor.
? Were there reporters in the trees? Slytherins in the bushes? Were hidden people listening right now to their every exchange? But Malfoy started speaking and Harry stopped scanning the landscape for spies.
"It's lovely, Draco," she chimed softly, drifting forward to get a closer look at the piano. "Do you play?"
"Um, what are you—" Potter raked a hand through his hair, shooting Pansy and Blaise an uncomfortable look. "Can I—where are you—um, you, er, have a free period right now, don't you?"
Fingers reached out and clutched at the fabric of his shirt, and he looked around to see Malfoy standing directly behind him, appearing paler than normal, breathing heavily and sounding as though he was on the verge of panic.
"And what did you and Draco have in common before you two hapless fools fell headfirst into love's waiting arms?" Blaise drawled sarcastically.
Harry tore through his bag until he located the Marauder's Map, tapping it and scanning quickly for Draco's dot.
"Course you do, Cae," Harry grinned for a moment, shaking his head before the smile disappeared. "It's just…I don't know. It's just a bunch of shit that makes no sense to me. And the worst part is that I'm not even sure if I'm making too big a deal about it all or if I'm not making enough of a deal about it. I don't know if I should be more or less angry than I currently am. I don't even know if I'm angry or disappointed or hurt or who the fuck even knows."
A shadow suddenly eclipsed the dim lighting and they both jumped hastily away from one another as a voice called to them, "Are you boys finding everything all right then?" Glancing up, they found the light blocked by Slughorn's recognizable girth.
"What were they doing?" Malfoy had gone out? To the Den? He didn't seem like all that social of a person, and the Den hardly seemed like the type of pub he would frequent. Who had he been meeting? Was it a business associate, like the ones he was currently with? Or was it someone more personal?
"Breaking hearts before breakfast is even over, eh, Harry?" Ron sniggered, sitting up and wiping tears of mirth from his eyes. "Hey, at least this one wasn't thirteen."
"You have to feed me," Smith said smugly, folding his arms across his chest. "The others won't let you get away with withholding food from people just because they make you angry."
It was several moments before Harry could calm himself enough to respond. "Oh, Draco," he said fondly, a wide grin stretching his face. "Fuck, I really do love you."
"Er, yeah. Yeah, I'm here." But now that Harry was here, he wasn't actually sure if he could do this.
, willingly and voluntarily, talking about second chances and not allowing preconceptions to cloud a person's judgment of someone and how much he cared about Draco. He then went on to talk about how grateful he was to have Draco in his life as well as how glad he was to have gotten the chance to know Pansy and Blaise, whom he had described as good friends. The castle had been bursting with gossip and squeals and almost friendly glances at Draco that had made him want to claw at his own skin.
"I can try," Harry murmured, "but it's highly unlikely I'll succeed." It was even more unlikely that Harry would actually try. He had part of a name; that was a start, at least.
"Yeah, after cornering me and making escape impossible," he muttered. "The girl was nearly as bad as Theo!"
"I want you to come, Draco," Harry pulled back far enough to murmur, looking Draco directly in the eye with a gaze full of fire. "I want you to come in my mouth."
"On the other…" Draco spoke in a voice so quiet Harry had to lean forward to catch the words, "it's terrifying. Because I know you mean everything you say.
Cue the ominous music, cue the drama, cue the suspicion. All right. Let's do this thing. But before we do, look! A despondent book quote!
"Tony," a soft voice said, and suddenly, Padma was standing before Anthony, both hands on the sides of his face as she gazed at him with teary eyes. "Tony," she repeated, and Harry could see Anthony's lower lip tremble as he looked down at her.
"I'm fucking sick of this!" Draco fumed, clenching the crinkled newspaper tighter between his fists. His angry footsteps seemed to echo off the walls and ricochet off every surface of the corridor. Stupid
Sighing, Harry raised his other hand to Draco's chest, placing it directly over his heart. For several moments he said nothing, standing completely still as he felt Draco's heart race and pound beneath his fingers, reminding himself once more that Draco was okay, the man was alive and unharmed. "I hope I can."
"Because." Harry shut his eyes, praying he would not start crying again. Lord, had he not already cried enough for the rest of his lifetime? How could he still have any tears left? "Because of what I need to tell you. I need to explain some things to you, and you're not going to want to hear them. I don't want to say them. But I need to, and I need you to listen, okay? I know you won't believe me, but I'm hoping that you'll realize that I care about you and I'm only doing what's best for you."
The comment made Draco snigger as he slid his hands back up to Harry's shoulders. "Of course you are. The rock that could not be cracked. That's you, Seek."
"So," Potter continued with a soft smile, maneuvering around Draco to take the side closest to the road and the strange four-wheeled death traps still zooming past him. He nudged the blond further toward safety and Draco couldn't help but stare in surprise, feeling his insides soften at the kind, unexpected gesture. Potter really was one hundred percent gentleman, wasn't he? "I have to ask you a question."
"Ginny called me," Ron said flatly. "She called me and said that you showed up at the house with the same blond bloke who brought over the challenge from the Death Eaters."
"I'm sorry for trying to do the same to you," Blaise continued. "And you need to recognize the significance of my remorse because I don't generally feel such a thing. Other than Draco several times over the past two weeks, I'm not even sure who the last person was that I apologized to. But I am sorry, Harry. Because, despite what you might think, I really do love Draco. He's my best friend, and I never wanted to see him hurt. And despite what you might think even more, I really do consider us to be close friends, you and me. It was surprising how well you fit into our little group, in a way that very few ever have. But Pansy and I,"—Lord, he hated having to admit to people how he really felt—"we really do love you too, you git. I mean," he paused, feeling himself flush, "not in like, a bent way. Not in the same way that Draco loves you. But we love you like a mate. Like our best mate who happens to be a Gryffindor and a panda bear, except for when he's being scary-angry at us before ignoring us entirely."
"Oh, god," Harry uttered, throwing his head back and staring up at the ceiling as Malfoy began to take him into the back of his throat. A groan escaped him as Malfoy swallowed around him, throat tightening, and Harry took a second to wonder at the surrealness of the situation; he wasn't certain if he would ever get used to it. He sincerely hoped the level of surprise and thrill would never fade, no matter how many times he and Malfoy did this.
With a grim nod of agreement, Harry dropped his arms and turned to face the room. Another ball of light suddenly joined the first as Draco cast his own. Rotating in a slow circle, Harry looked carefully around. He didn't see anything—no body, no blood, no broken furniture. Nothing seemed amiss.
Caelix was silent for several moments. "Did you ever think that maybe there's a good reason the killer is going after them?"
"So what's the baggage then?" Remus said in a serious voice, dropping down onto the bench beside him.
—"I really think we should be on a bed. This couch is far too narrow for everything I want you to do to me."
Buuut I hope everyone who made it to the end enjoyed this incredibly sentimental story of teenage true love :)  Feedback is always appreciated, lovelies!
"Sorry," he shrugs. "It was an accident." If not for the presence of his significant other, I would never have believed his half-apologetic excuse, but I know Granger would never allow him to behave so callously in her company. I graciously allow the slight to pass.
Fortunately—or unfortunately, Harry couldn't decide—the need to begin spouting whatever came to mind vanished with the arrival of Ron, the redhead suddenly entering the sitting room through a different doorway than the one he and Malfoy had come through, the one that led to the drawing room.
Not bothering to hide his pleasure over the taste, Harry closed his eyes and moaned again as he ate an even larger spoonful. "Christ, Malfoy, do you eat like this every meal?" he asked, opening his eyes when there was no response. He was startled to find Malfoy staring at him oddly, grey eyes unblinking and intense, a pink flush to his cheeks. He looked to be staring at Harry in the same way that Harry had been staring at his dessert only a moment ago.
But the next second the blond had regained control and the anger had faded behind his smooth mask. "You followed me." He spoke in a tone of voice that suggested boredom but held himself far too stiffly for it to be believed.
"Not really. More like if you get sprayed in the face with it, it burns so badly you can't see anything or open your eyes, and it can take a while to wear off."
She swiped at her eyes. "Because what could either of you have done?" she whispered, sounding anguished. "We can't even protect ourselves, let alone each other."
Sighing, he pulled back his curtains to discover bright sunlight pouring into the empty room. Checking the time, he was surprised to see that breakfast had long ended and that the first class of the day was nearly over.
"No," Blaise answered, "it's a leather jacket. It's their version of dragonhide, I suppose, but made from a different animal. Apparently, Muggle girls can't resist a bloke in a leather jacket, and I'm assuming that it's the same for bent Muggle blokes as well. Try it on, let's see how it looks."
"It's just you living here?" the Auror asked in puzzled amazement, dark eyebrows shooting up to disappear beneath the thick thatch of black hair hanging low over his forehead.
The man seated across from him, however, was very different. He appeared to be only a few years older than Draco, with chocolate-colored hair and the scruffy beginnings of a beard. His eyes were hazel and nearly covered by the shaggy brown hair he was constantly shaking from his eyes, as though not quite used to the length. The man was ruggedly good-looking and for a moment Draco was surprised, but as he looked around, he realized that Wisp blended in perfectly with the other pub goers, most of whom were right around Draco's age.
Malfoy nodded. "I was careful when I hired this company. I don't like strangers coming in and out of my home."
Forcing his legs to move faster, Harry sprinted past the empty doorways and the watchful shadows, doing his best to ignore the way they all seemed to be looking at him with wide, gaping eyes. Every shadow in the corridor seemed to turn to follow him with sightless stares as he ran past, feeling the silent gazes of the portraits scrape his skin with black fingernails. He could hear the blood rushing in his ears, feel the adrenaline surging through his veins as his heart hammered in his chest. Over the ringing in his ears, he could hear wailing and sobbing up ahead.
Harry stroked Malfoy's sharp cheekbones lightly with his fingertips, marveling at the beauty he had never fully appreciated before. "Malf—Draco," he whispered, and the kisses turned more insistent.
Welcome to the fourth chapter! Otherwise affectionately known as "Harry and Draco's Fun Beachside Adventures and Their Ignoring of an Angry Ron and His Portentous Warnings of Doom!" Also known as "The Conclusion of Harry and Draco's Very First Secret Sleepover of Secrecy and Love!" :)
"I just don't trust him," he settled on finally. "I dunno what it is, but he makes me feel uneasy, you know?"
"I love him too," Harry interrupted, gazing at Draco with warm affection. "Your son and I plan on spending the rest of our lives together, Lucius, so this is something you need to get used to now if you want to have any sort of relationship with Draco in the future. Unless you want to rot away in this place all alone for the rest of your life, without a single visitor or a single person caring about you, you need to come to terms with who your son is and realize that his life is
For a moment, Harry felt frozen in shock. Not once that year had she spoken to him. She had never once spoken in his presence
"Turn around," he ordered, and Draco blinked in confusion. "Turn around, let me check you out for weapons."
"Is that not how you react to most situations in life?" Weasley said, voice heavy with sarcasm, and Draco glared.
"It's all we can do for now," she reminded him. "At least the house has plenty of food, and space and bedding certainly aren't issues."
On his way back downstairs, Draco paused at his rooms to finally tug a soft sleep shirt over his head before continuing to the first-level parlour to await Weasley and Daphne. Once there, he poured himself a full glass of brandy and took several large gulps as he processed the newest horrifying development, unsure of what to make of it. As far as he knew, the attacks had been spread out sporadically over the past four months, but it hadn't even been two weeks since Pansy had been murdered. The killer was either getting impatient or knew that the Aurors were taking this more seriously. Maybe the increased risk added a level of thrill for the culprit.
"Well, for one, you're assuming he's still alive," Hermione pointed out. "He could also be dead. But I worry even more if he's guilty."
But anyway, the next chapter will be up soon, and Draco's guilt may just start catching up with him :) Should be fun! Later, lovers!
"What, journey to the Muggle world? Go clothes shopping? Kiss in front of a million witnesses?" The second the final question passed Draco's lips, he wanted to smack himself in the head. Why had he said that? He hadn't meant to say that!
She said something he could not hear, her words muffled as she spoke to someone near her, before returning to the call. "I'll be out in just a second," she said before the line went dead, and Draco tucked his phone away with another sigh. It would be good to see Tracey. She could tell him what to do and help him with his confusion. She had always been good at helping him see things more clearly, and she was unafraid of giving her honest opinion about a subject.
AAHHH, so many questions! What are we thinking? Does this change anyone's suspicions? Has it made anyone hate Zacharias even more? Don't worry if it hasn't, he's not done yet :)
Ignoring the voice that whispered that anything involving Draco was hardly trivial, Harry nodded once more, much more firmly this time, before exiting the room. The door was pulled shut behind him before he began heading further along the corridor to Neville's office; he had a feeling that it would be a good idea to save Caelix for last. A sharp rap of knuckles against Neville's door was given permission to enter. The door was opened to reveal Neville in his chair, leafing through a folder with a frown.
Maybe his ears weren't working right. Maybe the reason Slughorn's announcement had filled him with such dread was that he had simply heard wrong.
head may just explode from being exposed to it, and I'm afraid that such a thing would be far too unfortunate to allow. So, really, for the sake of both of our heads, you need a new outfit."
With a start, he realized he was actually worrying himself over Potter's eating habits. What was it to Draco if the man ate or not? Other than the fact that his physical strength was very much Draco's business when a killer was after the blond and Potter was possibly the only thing standing between Draco and death. That was most likely all it was; Draco was far too worried about himself to be worried out of concern for Potter. Otherwise, the man could eat as little as he wanted.
Harry flushed and looked at the ceiling as Ron began spluttering in horror. "No! No, Malfoy! That's all right!" he cried, and then muttered under his breath, "Poncy fucking ferret."
"Well," Hermione said slowly, pausing to scribble something down in her notepad. "That's the thing, Zacharias. We're not entirely sure you
"It's just…" he began hesitantly, "it's someone that…someone that I never expected to get involved with, because this person and I have never gotten along in the past. I thought they hated me. And I thought I hated them. But it turns out that they want to be with me…they say they've had feelings for me for a long time. And I might have feelings for them back, but at the same time…I dunno, I'm just not sure
"Ginny, I would never do that to you," he said softly, risking taking one small step forward. "But those promises I made you back when we broke up…I was a different person before the end of the war," he frowned, wondering how best to explain it to Ginny in actual words, "and I'm a different person now. And I'm sorry, Ginny, I really, really am, but…" he took a deep breath, "but I can't force things that I don't feel. I just…don't see you that way anymore. I still care about you, but it's different now. It's not the same as it once was."
"'Course I do," he said, feeling confused. "I was there." What did the Yule Ball have to do with anything?
"Fuck," Draco swore. "He could be there for fucking hours. We're pretty much doomed to miss breakfast if he's found a mirror. I thought I had hidden all the mirrors from him. I have never met a person able to stare at themselves for as long as Blaise does. I swear that more than half his life has been spent sitting before mirrors or staring into anything even slightly reflective."
"You know, Harry, that hurts," Caelix placed a hand over his heart and pretended an affronted look. "I thought you told me all those lovely stories based off of friendship and mutual trust, not as some sort of reward system to punish bad behavior. That's just straight fucked up, that is. I expected better from you."
"You disguised him as Daphne…and then killed him?" Draco's head was swirling, his stomach churning. He did not know what to believe anymore.
"You have clearly been spending far too much time around Blaise," Draco decided, staring at the smiling brunet in disbelief.
"You shouldn't have to see this!" Harry argued. The smell of burned flesh was reminding him horribly of Crabbe's death, something he did not want Malfoy to be forced to revisit.
The blond's countenance softened, just for a moment, but it was enough time for Harry to step even closer until they were almost touching. It had been what felt like centuries since he'd last touched Draco and just being this near the man had his heart hammering fiercely and the
"Works for me, as well," Harry agreed, before making a fast decision. Draco was still leaning against the wall, and, judging from the bulge pressing into Harry's thigh, still rock hard. Harry decided to return last night's favor and suddenly dropped to his knees, smiling at Malfoy's startled gasp and the tentative hands that slid into his hair to tenderly rake his scalp.
"But…" Malfoy blushed and squirmed, "last night, in the boathouse…it was the best night of my entire life. And I wanted so badly for it to be just as monumental for you, and seeing you with that girl, I just…I just thought that…"
The three Slytherins stared at him. "Seven?" Draco asked, one eyebrow raised in disbelief. "You can't award seven, Potter. Points are always awarded on variables of five, you can't just go changing the rules like that."
"Gross," Seamus complained, eyes widening at the look Harry gave him. "Not you, mate! Just, you know, ew. I don't really fancy some hangaround with a cock putting the moves on me, you know?"
"Damn," Harry exhaled, rolling his shoulders. But no matter how much he rolled them, the tension still remained, clinging to his muscles like glue.
"YOU DON'T GET TO LEAVE!" the man roared, making Draco jump. "YOU'RE MINE, DRACO! I FUCKING OWN YOU! YOU DON'T GET TO LEAVE YOUR RING AND YOUR PROPERTY VEST BEHIND AND DISAPPEAR AND NOT EXPECT A RESPONSE FROM ME! NOW TELL ME WHERE YOU ARE RIGHT NOW, YOU LITTE SLUT!"
"More than enough…" Draco repeated, both mind and body completely numb. Blaise was still slumped against the wall, eyes glassy and vacant as they stared at Draco. Goyle was collapsed on his back on the floor, a soft smile lighting up his face and brown eyes empty as they gazed blankly up at the ceiling, forever seeing nothing. "You killed them all, Daphne. You orchestrated everything and used Greg to carry it all out. You used his own grief over Vince to carry out your vengeance for you. You made him what he became, you turned his own love and trust in you against him. And then you killed him for it."
"Killed your son…?" Harry trailed off as a horrified recognition dawned on him. "Oh my god," he whispered, finally realizing how he knew the man. "You're Crabbe's father. I remember you from the Trials. You were there that night at Hogwarts."
"They were always far too good for Wire and Morgue," Draco said in a faraway voice, and Harry wondered what he was thinking.
Draco was not quite sure why he was comparing the two men, setting them up as mirror opposites in his mind; it was not as if Potter had expressed any romantic interest in him, especially considering he was there for the sole purpose of doing his job. It was a necessity of work, nothing personal; it was not as if Potter would have been there
"We just want to know if Draco will be your first time as well," Blaise said innocently. "So answer the question and put our minds at ease. Prude or slag?"
that he was putting Draco at risk by sending him directly into the hornet's nest? Rival gangs were not allowed outside their own turf, and that included all patches, hangarounds, and property. Draco could be seriously hurt for strolling up to the clubhouse and handing them a challenge from their enemies. There was no guarantee he would come out of that clubhouse in one piece, and Fenrir had fucking
At the question, his mind automatically went to Malfoy—soft blond hair and patrician features; that impossibly posh accent that Harry used to want to punch and yet now gave him gooseflesh; those storm grey eyes that he was finding himself lost more and more in every time they locked with his own.
And the sight of Draco trying so desperately to hold himself together and be all right made Harry's chest ache and it felt like his heart would crumble to pieces watching the man attempt to keep every scrap of pain and fear hidden from view. A glance back down the hallway confirmed that Ron and Neville had indeed gone into Daphne's room and that they were alone together in the long corridor.
Her flirtatious smile widened. "I can think of a couple things," she said, flexing her biceps closer to her body and pushing her breasts together to draw even more attention to them.
"It makes us more than we were," I answer. "Let's not spoil the evening by overanalyzing it. Let's just remember that we both want to be here."
Harry grinned. "God, I can't believe we all actually spent an entire evening together and not a single hex was thrown."
, but after less than a minute of scanning the information regarding Theo's attack, he had slammed the folder shut with a pounding heart and bile rising in his throat, shoving it away from himself in disgust. As he drew in deep shuddering breaths, he knew there would be no way he would be able to look at the details of Pansy's murder and had been insanely appreciative toward Potter for not disclosing any specifics that first day.
"S-sorry," she stammered, eyes raking the hair on his forehead as though her gaze could sweep the fringe aside to uncover the scar hidden beneath. "Seamus or Dean? Erm, yeah, actually, I think they're still here." Not taking her eyes from him, she took a step backward, nearly stumbling and knocking over a large bottle full of dark liquid on the counter behind her. "Sorry," she blushed. "I'll just go get them for you."
Fuck. He should run. He should leave. He should never have gone into that fucking garage or ever tried to play detective. What the hell had he been thinking? What could he possibly do against whoever was in there? What had Draco—
"Look, Potter, I'm here to…" For the first time, Malfoy both sounded and appeared uncertain. "You aren't going to…tell anyone…are you?" His words were hesitant and there was a pink flush creeping across his sharp cheekbones. His eyes were hooded but Harry thought he saw something close to panic underneath as if this was really something Malfoy had been desperately worried about. And now that Harry was looking closely, the other boy did look exhausted. The grey eyes gazing nervously into Harry's own were framed by dark circles.
"I've come across a spell that will make a person sprout tusks similar to a walrus," Granger interrupted, and everybody turned to her in surprise. "Although, I've never found one that will cause a person to grow warthog tusks."
"Do you remember seventh year?" Neville asked, eyes shining with emotion. "When he burst into the Great Hall during dinner one day out of nowhere and started shouting about Harry, Ron, and Hermione breaking into Gringotts and escaping on a stolen dragon and half the hall started cheering? I thought the Carrows were going to explode, they were so angry."
"Anything good?" Harry wondered, drifting over to where the blond stood and placing a hand on the man's curved back.
"Hello, Professor!" Ginny greeted cheerfully, beaming up at McGonagall, and Harry could have sworn he saw the older woman's lips twitch.
, Harry thought fiercely, giving in to Draco's pleas as he drove in even harder, feeling satisfaction sweep through him with every violent slap of their bodies. "You're mine," he growled against Malfoy's lips, ducking his head to bite a bruising kiss into the skin of his throat. "You're mine, Draco."
"You came," he whispered, hopping down from the ledge and nearing Harry cautiously, as though Harry was a wild animal that he was afraid of spooking. "You really came, Harry."
The four had started out with taunts and jeers, stepping into his space and tossing him around with rough hands, passing him back and forth between the lot of them with hard shoves and nasty threats. Then he had made the mistake of trying to flee with no clear exit in sight, causing one of the boys to catch him by the hair and drag him back with a callous grin, tugging harshly and wrenching a cry from Draco's lips before the other boy sank his fist into Draco's stomach. And as Draco doubled over, gasping in pain, another boy's knee suddenly slammed up into his face, catching him across the brow and sending him flying back to land in a dazed heap on the floor, touching his forehead gingerly before attempting to scramble away.
"Draco hired a Tracker," Harry muttered into his palms, elbows resting on his knees and face buried in his hands. "One who apparently knew it was Cyril Crabbe behind the attacks. Malfoy fucking knew who was killing everyone off and he never said a word. You know the very first thing he said when everything was over? 'It really was Cyril Crabbe. Wisp was right.'" Harry laughed brokenly. "And yeah, it looks like Wisp was definitely fucking right."
Draco was much more doubtful of the truth of that overconfident statement—honestly, how would Potter know who Draco would or would not like?—but he could hardly express dislike of a man he had never met in front of what was clearly either one of his very good friends or possibly his lover.
Draco sighed. "Just—I don't know, difficult to understand. I feel like I'm just waiting for the other shoe to finally drop."
The kill list is only getting longer with every chapter! My bad. Any suspicions yet? Any predictions? Anyone catch those movie references? (I do so love a good horror film!)
"Draco!" Suddenly, Potter was standing right in front of him, startling the blond, who took an automatic step back. "God, I forgot how dramatic you are," the brunet panted, sounding winded. Good.
"Where are Wire and Morgue?" he asked the girls, hoping they would be able to stop eye-fucking each other long enough to answer the question. Were they off with Wolf, doing whatever the hell shady club business the man had been assigned?
It was the sight of Neville lurching toward him, both hands clamped over his midsection where a large red stain had soaked into the fabric covering his torso. His hands were painted crimson as he hobbled his way toward Harry, who ran forward to catch the injured man.
"Sure," Draco drawled, leaning his shoulder into Harry. "I'm certain that it'll happen any day now."
The sight made something in Harry's stomach twist sharply and he dropped his gaze, unwilling to delve into how much the sight of Malfoy's regret made him feel. Damn it, Malfoy didn't get to feel regret. Harry was the one who should be feeling regret—regret for ever allowing the prat into his life.
"You lot go in there and wait for me," he told them, waiting until they had swept into the other room before turning to Smith. "Hermione needs to speak to them," he lied, wanting to avoid another fight and another round of accusations. "She's spoken to everybody else about where they were and now she needs to talk to them. That all right with you, Smith?" he ended a bit more aggressively than he had meant to.
Raising one eyebrow, Draco stared at him for a moment before pouncing, rolling Harry onto his back and smiling dangerously before claiming Harry's mouth in a kiss.
"Draco," Harry whispered, leaning closer. The scant distance between them was erased by Draco, who leant forward and pressed his lips to Harry's with a small gasp. Harry's eyes slid shut as he cradled Draco's head, kissing him softly, so softly. It made Harry's head swim and his heart clench in his chest.
"Then it's past time you learned, isn't it?" Potter asked archly, kissing Draco's response away right before grinding down hard against him. Draco moaned, much louder than he had meant to, especially considering the fact that he had never actually meant to moan at all. Malfoy men did not
"And then it happened again," Harry finished in a quiet voice, shifting his weight between both feet uncomfortably. That was nothing more than another memory to be haunted by at this point; Harry had entire collections of them.
But Harry had meant what he said about the time limit and was fully prepared to go after the other man and barge in on whatever questionable meeting he may be involved in if he took too long. Harry would not allow any more harm to come to anybody, especially Draco, and especially now that they were friends.
After that, he had rarely seen his father, the man vanishing for long periods of time with no explanation of where he had been, and Draco would never dream to dare question the man. Then he had been thrown into Azkaban at the end of fifth year, thanks to the very man sitting before him at that moment, and Draco had not had to see his father again until his breakout with the other Death Eaters.
Returning the grin, Harry nodded and followed Dean toward the room, ignoring the awed stares of the crowd around him. No matter how many times he came into the pub, it was always the same. He was sick of not being able to go out in public like a normal person.
Feeling restless and impatient, Harry wandered further down the hall away from the other students, pacing slowly down the corridor to the staircase and peering up and down in an attempt to spot Draco. Where was he? He was planning on eating dinner, wasn't he?
"I'm okay," Draco protested, praying Fenrir wasn't in a pushy mood. "You know I don't like this sort of thing, Fen."
"No, for everything," Harry replied, then added in a hesitant voice, "And for what happened. I never—I didn't mean to pressure you or add any more stress or anything because I already know that you're dealing with a lot and I never wanted to add to that, so I'm sorry." He twisted his hands together nervously in his lap as he waited for a response, staring down at his fingers rather than at Draco. He wasn't sure what expression he would see on the other man's face and was not certain if he was ready to find out.
"Exactly," Draco said instantly. "You know that stupid Weasley is just waiting for an opportunity to do something horrible to me, and his girlfriend will of course back him up with some sort of act of physical violence." Unconsciously, Draco rubbed at his cheek, lowering his hand when he realized it was the same spot that Granger had struck him in years ago, imagining for a moment that he could still feel it smarting.
The babbling conversations began to gradually pick back up as he strode away from the doors, not stopping his pace until he found an empty classroom and ducked inside, pausing to shrug off his bag and toss it to the floor. A moment later, Malfoy entered and did the same, stopping just long enough to cast several locking and silencing spells before walking quickly to Harry and wrapping his arms around his neck. Harry's arms wound around his waist and his lips were covering Draco's before he was even aware of it. The blond melted into him, returning his kiss with a fierce passion that Harry felt down to his very toes and was glad he had taken so much extra time wanking in the shower that morning. If Malfoy shifted like that again, though, it wouldn't really matter.
"So, what does that mean?" Potter wondered, stretching out one hand to play with the ends of Draco's hair, the strands falling directly over Draco's pounding heart.
Glaring, he reached over for the half-full bottle of vodka when a sudden noise made him pause. It was the distant revving of a single engine, and Draco lowered the bottle in confusion, wondering if anyone from the club had come back. They had only been gone a quarter of an hour or so, they should not be back for at least another hour. He cocked his head, creeping over to the door to peer out at the empty yard. There was nobody there. Not a single motorcycle was left, and Draco did not see anybody approach.
"So what have you done with Cornfoot then?" Zabini spoke up, leveling Harry with a hard stare. "Tell me he's been locked up somewhere."
"Okay," Harry declared, shoving Ron's hand away and glaring even as laughter threatened to bubble up his throat, "this is too weird to continue talking about with you."
"I don't like being forced into anything," Harry said, lowering his voice. "I felt trapped into accepting a gift I didn't want and I was angry and so I'm sorry that I left like that and I'm sorry that I took the broomstick and I'm sorry for all of it because I never meant to hurt you and I never wanted any of this to happen." He dropped his gaze to the floor and scuffed his shoe nervously. "I love you, Draco."
wardrobe, Potter," Blaise smiled innocently, ignoring Draco's glare. "It's far more interesting. Plus, most of the clothing Draco wears for you is in it, sooo…mine is the better wardrobe, really."
"We'll be back soon," he said softly, placing a comforting hand on her shoulder. The instant he touched her, she reached up to cover his hand with hers, stepping even closer until she was only inches away.
to use the right one for the right class or he would go mad. God, he could be so mental about that," Michael chuckled as a tear slid down his face. "He even had quills for essays and separate quills for notes and refused to use them for anything other than what he decided they were meant for. Anthony and I used to switch them around when he wasn't looking to see if he noticed, but he always did. He always knew exactly what quill was meant to be used for what. Stephen," Michael turned to give the other man a watery smile, "do you remember that time in Transfiguration when you asked him if you could borrow one of his million quills and he almost had a mental breakdown about it? I think handing over that quill was one of the hardest things he'd ever done. But he did, because he couldn't not help people. Do you remember, Anthony, that time in third year when we were stuck outside of the common room for ages because we couldn't answer the door's stupid question? And then Terry comes along and answers it right the first try." He shook his head, smiling sadly. "We'd been out there forever trying to figure it out. And he didn't even take the mickey for how long we'd been stuck out there.
"Drinking like that on a weekday, what would your adoring fans say?" Draco tsked as he turned to address empty air. "Pibby!" With a sharp crack that made Potter wince, the house-elf appeared, wringing his hands.
"You stupid, stupid Gryffindor," Draco whispered. "I've been yours since we met." His hands began attacking the fastenings of Harry's robes and yanking his shirt untucked, sliding his hands over the bare skin underneath and attaching his mouth to Harry's neck. Harry earnestly returned the favors, tearing at Malfoy's clothing until he found warm flesh. The teen hissed and arched into the brunet's touch and then
"Yeah, I have," Harry said quietly, eyes searching Malfoy's face. "I was never under any potion, Draco. Everything I felt for you…" he laughed hollowly, raking a trembling hand through his hair, "it was all real."
"Persons under love potions," she continued in a warning voice, "have also been known to become physically violent with the individual attempting to convince them their feelings are not real; they have been known to become violent with the object of their obsession. Understand, Mr Potter, that you are placing yourself at risk by doing this."
"Just, you know…" Harry shrugged again, feeling so far past awkward it was almost comical, "gay stuff."
The sight of Draco trying almost desperately to hold back tears seemed to break something inside of Harry. His own eyes prickled in sympathy as he gently tucked the blond head against the hollow of his throat and leaned them both back against the pillows. He could feel the puffs of Draco's warm breath against his neck.
It wasn't until he had completed a particularly complicated and risky spin-dive that he glanced up and noticed that both Oliver and Finlay had landed and were talking to someone—someone whose platinum hair was visible even from that distance. Harry shot quickly to the ground, the speed of the broom making it almost seem as if he had Apparated at their side.
"Er, yeah," Potter flushed. "I mean, only if you want to. Would you want to?" He looked so ridiculously flustered and so endearingly hopeful that Draco could feel the normally thick and impenetrable walls he had constructed around himself and his own emotions crumble just a tiny bit in response.
"Draco," he said in a low, dangerous voice, eyes narrowed as he stared at Draco's hand. "Where the hell is your ring?"
As Potter chuckled and gulped at his tea—surely cold by now—Draco realized that they were having a conversation. They were exchanging words and none of them were hateful or intended to wound. They weren't threatening each other or throwing insults. Where were the two boys from Hogwarts who had hated one another so fiercely? When had they both turned into the sorts of individuals who could sit down together and be civil? If they were no longer enemies or rivals, what were they? And more importantly, what could this newfound civility and easy manner lead them to become?
"Why?" Harry asked again. "What the hell do you want?" The question sounded as though it was encased in ice, and Harry's suspicion momentarily melted away as a strange expression crossed Malfoy's face, one that almost looked like
"But that still doesn't explain why he didn't simply just kill him," she argued. "He had no problem killing Terry, after all, and Terry was his partner."
"I hardly feel imprisoned by you, Draco," Harry countered softly. Maybe speaking at the right pitch would help soothe the Slytherin, like he had seen Hagrid do with wild animals.
The door flew open to reveal a barefoot Weasley, wearing a pale blue jumper and Muggle jeans. "Is everything all right, Malfoy?" he asked sharply, glancing around, and Draco nearly wanted to laugh—a noticeably odd reaction, considering the company.
"The fuck it doesn't!" Wolf shouted, both fists clenched. "You two had better start explaining why you laid hands on my property!"
Without warning, Harry suddenly shifted his weight, rolling Draco onto his back and settling over him, smiling widely at the sight of the gorgeous blond pinned beneath his body, naked and writhing, golden hair spread out in a silky halo against the impossible white of the squashy pillow, panting softly as he stared up at Harry with heat in his eyes.
"Have you always been this moronic or was I simply blinded to your stupidity by that damn potion?" Malfoy ground out, clenching his eyes shut as he rubbed his temples. "The date that I saw the two of you leave the castle grounds for! When you skipped out of here laughing and holding hands, and then came back to the Great Hall fucking laughing and holding hands!" He opened his eyes to glare at Harry for several seconds before the angry expression faded into a look of utter misery. "And that's fine, Harry, really. I mean, it's not like I have any reason to object or anything, right? All I'm trying to say is—" he took a deep breath, closing his eyes once more before speaking, "—that I'm glad that you seem happy. That's all. Because I know that I never did. Make you happy, I mean. I tried, but…I never did. All I ever seemed able to do was make you miserable."
Squeezing out from behind his desk, he exited the empty office he shared with Ron and began heading down the hall, in no hurry to reach his destination. Several colleagues greeted him as he passed and he returned the greetings half-heartedly, unable to muster up the ability to care much, even when Neville stopped to say hello.
. Both arms were wrapped around Potter's waist as he held tight, anchoring himself securely to the man. He buried his face in Harry's warm throat as he continued to rock into the brunet, moving slower and slower as his body tensed, growing more rigid with every stroke. Muscles contracting, he groaned low in his throat as he thrust up hard, burying himself as deeply as he could inside Harry and pausing there, holding himself still as his cock exploded and emptied inside Potter's quivering body.
Harry laughed hollowly. "Something that I won't like…" he murmured, laughing again and trying to ignore the edge of hysteria to his laughter. He had already seen and heard so many things that night that he had not liked; what else could the universe possibly now hit him with?
Harry's only response to the speech was to raise both eyebrows at the blond, who turned slightly pink but added in a sulky tone, "I'm fucking good at chess."
"Blaise," Draco sobbed, unable to draw breath through the anguish wracking him, crippling him, freezing him in place, tearing out his insides as he heard Blaise's breaths slow to pained rasps. "No, Blaise, please! Please don't die! Please, you can't die! You're too stubborn to die, Blaise,
, and he could hardly show up with an Auror in tow, and that his contacts would sever all ties with him, and I wasn't about to knock him out and lock him in the cellar, or follow him around like an obsessed shadow, or anything!"
Harry felt strange, watching the scene in front of his eyes play itself out. He felt as if he should be objecting, for Draco's sake, if not anything else. After all, the man had made it more than clear that Zabini's proximity made him uncomfortable. But how could Harry interrupt them when Malfoy was obviously grieving and Zabini appeared—Harry grudgingly admitted to himself—to be helping?
"A bat, Parkinson, really? Have you ever heard the sounds a bat makes? I am not a bloody bat! If anything,
"Well," Harry attempted a grin, although it felt a bit shaky, "I personally wish we were somewhere else a bit more fun, but…" the weak grin slid off his face as he continued, "I like knowing that the two of us can actually get along. Who would have ever guessed, right?"
Pulling back, Harry broke the kiss to gaze at Draco with questioning eyes. "Does this mean you like me?"
"You lot are insane," Weasley decided, frowning as Draco gestured for Pansy to pour the blond another shot as well. "Is this every fucking Saturday for you?"
Glaring through the large bruise beginning to darken his cheek, Zacharias flushed angrily but fell silent once more.
An endless parade of doors flashed before Harry's eyes, only distinguishable by the distinct creak of the hinges as the door was opened, and the final, sharp click of the same doors slamming shut. Every single room in the house seemed emptier than the last. The only thing filling the empty rooms beyond cobwebs and cold walls were piles of dust and shadows, along with an almost haunting silence that seemed to make the very air feel frostier. Harry shivered as he shut yet another door behind him, sighing into the chilly air of the corridor and imagining he could see his breath fanning before his face. Was it really as cold as it seemed or was Harry simply imagining that the darkness of the house could not be anything but icy? They had been searching for Stephen for what felt like hours, and yet they seemed to be no closer to finding him than they had been when they started.
"A first," Harry repeated firmly. "Being with her was so different, Draco. I've never felt this way about anyone else. I love you." Harry rolled them back over and attempted to imprint the image of Draco Malfoy lying sweaty and mussed beneath him onto his every sense—staring up at him with wide eyes and dilated pupils, his breath hitched and erotic. This was a moment he knew he would always remember.
"That's not all," Harry sighed. "Zacharias followed us upstairs. He knows where Draco's bedroom is and where all the Slytherins have been hiding."
both on the Quidditch teams, so I s'pose your aim must be at least somewhat decent," Pansy said thoughtfully. "And there was that one time that Potter nearly swallowed the Snitch trying to catch it, so I suppose he really would be good at catching things in his mouth that he probably shouldn't try to catch in there."
"Tracey and Pansy are there," Draco whispered. "I can't leave without so much as a single word to them." If he was being honest with himself, Draco was scared. The very idea of leaving the clubhouse for the unknown terrified Draco, no matter how much he may have longed to do such a thing. He wasn't ready yet, goddamnit! He wasn't ready to make such a difficult, life-changing decision! He needed to be sure—absolutely, one hundred percent sure before doing such a thing. He had never been a risk-taker.
Crossing to his desk, Harry dropped into his chair and sighed heavily. "God, I've never seen him like that." Just the memory sent a sharp pang shooting through his chest. He had seen Malfoy at several different low points throughout the man's life, but his reaction to Parkinson's death had been different—more painful to watch.
"Yes, Potter, don't worry," Blaise cut in, "Draco is still a blushing virgin, saving his blushing virginity for just the right person."
Ron said nothing, staring at him in stony silence until Zacharias finally huffed and walked over to the room. Once inside, Hermione locked the door with several sharp flicks of her wand.
The statement made Harry flush even darker, feeling embarrassment spread through him from head-to-toe. God, was Ron saying that he had heard the two of them? Fucking hell, did that mean that everybody had heard them? Glancing at Draco, he found the man red-faced but smirking down at his tea.
Collapsing back, Draco smiled to himself as Harry instantly snuggled up to him, wrapping himself around the blond and sighing contentedly.
"Take off your clothes," Harry growled, reaching down to unbutton his own jeans and tug the shirt over his head.
Malfoy's cheeks colored slightly, but his voice was steady when he answered. "I am quite well, thank you. Other than a growing hunger at being denied breakfast." The words were accompanied by a pointed stare.
"Not sure," Harry told her. "I mean, he's having the time of his life, isn't he? Just look at him." He gestured to where Ron flew through the air, swinging his bat and bellowing with delight. Hermione followed Ron with a soft look before starting slightly and coughing.
"It's okay," Draco interrupted, speaking down to the floor. "It's fine. I get it. I'm sorry as well. I'll just go."
The request made Draco's eyes narrow, and he could feel a faint throbbing in his temples. Fuck, he was far too exhausted for any of this horrible situation. He was far too exhausted to play any of the mind games he was certain Harry was not actually playing. Relationships were far too treacherous and fragile to be able to navigate safely whilst feeling so weighed down with fatigue.
"You have nothing together," Draco snapped, finally giving in to the urge to flick the mushiest pea he could find at the annoying sod. And when that pea missed the annoying sod, Draco had no choice but to find the second mushiest pea he could find and mush it just a bit more before flicking
"Who the hell said I was yours?" Harry demanded, unsure if he should shove Malfoy back or if that would only escalate things.
"Where did Draco disappear to?" Harry wondered, squinting up into the bright sky and hoping that the subject change would be enough of a distraction for Zabini.
"Honestly," Draco continued, shaking his head, "the fact that you would believe me capable of thinking of my social life during a time such as this...I think I'm owed a separate apology for that alone."
"No," Draco answered, feeling distinctly uncomfortable discussing the embarrassing details of his sexual history regarding his only other partner with another—very naked and aroused—man.
Potter frowned. "They really are real, Malfoy. I would never lie to someone about something like that."
Secondly, the length of this story has been mentioned to me by quite a few of you, and I'm sorry that I am unable to answer in specifics. In all honesty, I never really know how long my stories are going to be. I never plan a set length, what I write is what I write. If anybody hasn't guessed it by now, this story is going to be a long one. If I were to guess, I would put the remaining length at somewhere around eight or nine or so chapters still to go. But who knows! It could literally be any number! I know the story is already pretty long and slightly detailed, but I swear I don't do it on purpose just to drag it out.
To his disappointment, however, Zabini relaxed the fist around his wand and leaned his weight onto his back foot to survey Harry coolly. "I'm not worried," he said finally, copying Harry's posture and folding his arms. "I still know Draco better than any other living person." His voice lowered to a smooth, velvet purr, one that made the hair on Harry's arms stand up in discomfort. "I know what he feels like beneath me, know what he sounds like screaming my name. I know what it feels like to be buried inside him, his tight body stretched so deliciously around me, know the sounds of his pleas as he begs for more. I know exactly which spots make him writhe and moan, and which make him arch his back and cry for more. I know where he likes to be bitten and exactly how hard. I know when and how forcefully to pull his hair, when to tease and when to satisfy. I know when to be rough and exactly how much pain he enjoys with his pleasure. I know how to make him come so hard he sees stars, Potter."
"Thank Merlin for small miracles," Malfoy muttered, bottling the potion and tucking the large flask away in a pocket of his robes.
"Please, Harry," Cae touched the tips of his fingers to Harry's arm before pulling away. "Just tell me. You look like someone's just died and I'm worried. So talk to me. Even if it's about Draco."
"I thought you would never speak to me again," Draco confessed, reaching out to pick up one of Harry's hands and trap it between his own. "I thought you hated me now."
Draco moaned and melted into the kiss for a moment before pulling back to stare Harry in the eye. "Fuck me, Harry," he whispered.
At the words, Draco paused. His first response was refusal—he did not want Potter to read what was obviously a personal letter. But the letter was vague in its mentionings to their previous relationship and this was concerning both Potter's job and the well-being of Draco. And Blaise's well-being too, he supposed, although he was no longer as concerned with that as he once had been.
Blaise scratched his head in thought. "I'm sure I must be up to at least a million by now. Maybe even four or five million. These two are still struggling to get out of the triple digits."
He hurried past the ghostly shadows on legs made of rubber, throwing the door open and slamming it shut behind him with a much louder bang than he had been expecting. The sound made him jump and he glanced up, gaze locking on Pansy and Tracey, who were sat together on a sofa, staring at Draco with questions brimming in their eyes.
"This does prove one thing," Neville said quietly, relaxing on his back foot. "Stephen is definitely still alive. This room was sealed recently. The only other suspects we have are Zacharias and Justin, and they've both been locked up for hours."
Checking the time and scowling, Harry hurried to a Floo, heading to Grimmauld Place to pick up any items he may need for an extended stay at the Manor. For some reason, Harry was looking forward to staying there. Maybe it had to do with the fact that there would now be people around and he wouldn't be coming home to an empty house every night, especially one as dreary as the one he was standing in.
Harry banged his head back against the wall, trying to drive out the image of Wolf's stupid, smirking face. The man thought he was so untouchable—he thought he was so strong. All he was was a predator, preying on those weaker than himself just to delude himself into thinking he was somehow the most powerful thing around.
"Why do you even care, Potter?" His voice was tight and angry. How dare the man think Draco owe him answers about everything or anything, even if he was there to save the blond's life? Potter did not get to care what happened to him, not if he was involved with someone else. "Concerned about my ungrateful life now, are you?" He sneered the words and watched in satisfaction as Harry's face twisted with rage. The man turned red and took a step closer, and Draco was suddenly worried that he was about to be punched in the face by a furious Harry Potter, something that he was not at all unfamiliar with.
"Why?" Harry asked in a voice as cold as the winter wind outside. "How the hell did you even know I was here?"
"Nobody wanted that to happen, Blaise, Jesus Christ," Draco complained, wiping his cheek in disgust.
Jogging to the broomshed, he yanked open the door and grabbed the first school broom he could find, desperate to be up in the air. When he was flying, he didn't have to think. All he had to do was
"If that's really true, then…" Draco took a deep breath, holding it in his lungs for nearly half a minute before releasing it in a loud, nervous sigh. "I would like to tell you something."
She held up one finger in warning, a sharp glare on her face. "Do not make me be sick all over you," she said in a threatening voice. "Because I absolutely will if you continue saying things like that. All over you, Blaise, and that is not an exaggeration."
"Well, something definitely happened," her smirk widened as she walked over to sink down onto Blaise's mattress instead. "Something that necessitated the removal of both of your shirts."
"…Harry…" Draco trailed off uncertainly. Should he say it back? He was pretty sure he felt it back. But did he even have the right to feel it back? Did he even have the right to say it back? What if saying it back only hurt Harry worse when the entire relationship exploded in their faces?
"But you may as well have," said Goyle in a cold voice. "It was your fault even if you didn't kill him. You may as fucking well have."
Malfoy rolled his eyes. "That's what you ask me? Really? I'm on my knees about to suck your cock and all you ask is how I got down here so quickly?"
But long after everyone else had averted their attention, Harry kept his eyes fixed on the blond. He had not been expecting Malfoy to show his face that term. Truthfully, he had not given it much thought. He had spoken at Malfoy's trial, had mentioned the Manor and how recognizable he had been—even with Hermione's Stinging Hex in effect—when Malfoy had pretended to be unable to identify him. He had also detailed the ways in which Malfoy's wand had been imperative in defeating Voldemort. Harry's testimony coupled with Malfoy's age had swayed the Wizengamot in favor of a lighter sentence, the conditions of which Harry had not bothered to pay attention to after hearing that no jail time was to be served.
"Yes, stop teasing his boyfriend." The words were mumbled into the skin of Potter's neck and Draco wasn't even sure if the others had heard him, but the sniggers stopped and Draco raised his head to look at Potter.
Blaise raised one eyebrow at him. "Well, isn't someone just a right little ray of sunshine today. Don't take your inner turmoil out on us just because we're here, Draco."
too much to talk about it, you know? Sometimes there's just too much to say, and it's simply easier to not say anything at all."
Draco sighed, pushing away from the car and taking several steps forward. "It was my fault, really," he murmured, hugging himself. "I should have known better. I should know how to handle him by now."
No Slytherin guard, no frightened students terrified into bending to his will. Just Draco and Harry. And McGonagall and Trelawney and possibly one or two others, but he didn't care about any of them. Malfoy wouldn't be able to avoid him and Harry would corner him somehow and force him to listen and if he had to use a full body-bind on him then that is what he was prepared to do. He fully intended to spend Christmas with Malfoy and give him the gift he had purchased the week after they had started seeing one another. The item had been on display in the window of a tiny shop in Hogsmeade and the rest purchased through a Muggle catalog that Hermione had found. It was currently in Harry's trunk and had been there, wrapped for weeks, purchased early out of a fear of leaving his gift to the last minute and being left with hardly anything to choose from. And now he was determined to see it delivered.
Lost in grief, Draco remained curled uncomfortably on the chilly tile until the water turned cold, then freezing. Finally, when there were no tears left, he stretched out his stiff limbs and climbed slowly to his feet, standing on trembling legs and shivering violently as he shut off the glacial water before hurriedly snatching up the fluffy white towel waiting for him and scrubbing roughly at his face with it, wanting to hide all evidence of his breakdown. It would not do well to show weakness in front of four people that Draco did not trust.
"Well, of course not," Justin responded, appearing nonplussed. "I had gone up to the second level of the main room."
A strange sinking sensation echoed through Draco's insides at the final statement. Was Harry not even expecting a present from Draco? Did he think Draco was selfish, or a bad boyfriend? Stupid unassuming Potter. Draco could be romantic if he wanted to be.
," Harry growled, reaching between them to undo the fastenings to Draco's denims right as he claimed Draco's mouth in a furious kiss, one that made Draco's head swim and his heart go into overdrive, making him feel like he had been spinning in circles for hours, leaving him disoriented and breathless and unsure of which way was up and which way was down, unsure of what up and down even were at that point, all he knew at all in the world was that there was only Harry—nothing else existed.
Until he had seen Harry Potter's fury pour free in all its wrathful glory, crackling from him like lightning. Until he had felt the scorching heat of his glare, somehow feeling both ice cold and burning hot, managing to burn Blaise and freeze him and halt him in place all at the same time. Never before had Blaise had anyone that he considered to be as close a friend as Potter ever look at him with such seething disdain before. He had never had anyone he liked and cared about ever tell him to go to hell before. It had stung, in a way that Blaise had not been expecting. And watching Draco crumple, watching him cry, watching him fall apart the way he had over the past fortnight, had torn something in Blaise. It hurt to watch. And Blaise was sick to death of seeing it. He was sick of his best friend hurting so badly.
Harry saw shadows in Malfoy's eyes and wondered if he was thinking about the same moment. "Er, you go ahead, Ron. We'll be there in a bit," he said.
"I didn't kill him, Gregory," Draco said frantically, wrenching at the chains once more. "I didn't kill Vince!"
"I didn't do it." The words fell from Justin's lips the moment the three Gryffindors entered the room he was being held in.
"It's not a magical signature I recognize or have been able to trace," he admitted, scuffing one frayed black trainer against the floor as though embarrassed by his failure.
"Son…my son…my son…" The words were haunted and spoken in a low, scratchy voice, sending chills through Harry's chest. "My son…my son…my son…my son…"
"I don't think you want us voting on the one we all think matters the least here, Smith," Michael said in a hard voice, glaring at the Hufflepuff.
Harry stared at his best friend in growing frustration. "Ron, I can't help it if that's the reality, though. I didn't ask for it to be this way."
The two men were silent for most of the meal, but would occasionally exchange casual words, mostly light banter, but with a hint of teasing that Harry would never have thought possible between them. Between the numerous courses and the relaxed conversation, Harry was feeling full and content, until finally most of the dishes had vanished and two small crystal bowls piled high with a thick pink cream appeared in front of them. As Harry took a bite, he realized—with an actual groan this time—that it was strawberry mousse, with just the barest hint of vanilla.
"No, of course not," he shrugged, still feeling uncomfortable. "We're just friends now. Really good friends, mind you, but just friends. She's my best friend, but that's all we'll ever be."
Glancing past Pany's glaring eyes and twitching lips, Draco couldn't help but search out Potter, forehead wrinkling in confusion as, once again, he had just enough time to see Potter hurriedly drop his gaze down to his own plate.
I don't even know her! What the hell did I ever do to her to make her want to start a sodding business built solely on the idea of drugging me?!"
"Oh really?" Harry asked in amusement. Had he really been wonderful? "Think about how I shag very often, do you?"
Draco felt a warm tingle in his spine. He was Potter's boyfriend. Potter wanted to protect him. Even though Potter had saved his life in the past, he had never felt as if the boy had actually defended him or consciously thought of himself as protecting the blond.
As he glanced around the room for the source of the noise, he spotted Pibby immediately and wanted to slap a palm to his forehead for not having realized sooner what the sound had been.
Harry! Oh fuck, I need you!" He needed Harry constantly, in every single way imaginable. He sometimes still had trouble believing that Harry felt the same.
Was Malfoy the only one this potion had affected? How long had Harry felt this way about the other boy? How long had Harry even been attracted to boys? But something about Malfoy felt right; it felt inevitable, as if this was what the animosity between them had been building toward all these years. Had mutual attraction really been the underlying cause of all the hatred and vicious anger between the two of them?
as an example of good company? There was an unreadable expression on Potter's face, deepening at the three words spoken reflexively by Draco and he hastened to add something, anything else. "There was also a time not too long ago that Pansy and Blaise were both practically living here. It's not as if I'm alone." But despite the declaration, Draco's voice became sad at both the remembrance and the realization that he was, in fact, very much alone. People had begun gradually leaving his life years ago; he should not have been surprised that the last two people he had trusted would do the same. Blaise had been all but moved in by the time Draco found out about his numerous indiscretions. In a fury, Draco had flung all of the man's belongings across the grounds and given him a five-second head start to collect everything before the blond had begun blasting the various properties into ash.
it made as it hit the water and sank out of sight, and he wondered what it was he was trying to prove to himself with that action.
"Some invitation thing to some class reunion thing that Malfoy is apparently throwing," Harry told her, having to fight the urge to gesture wildly. "At Malfoy Manor. Next month. It says that he invited everyone in our year and that it's for our year only. Didn't you get one?"
"I believe that Ron said they weren't the ones that something had happened to, not that nothing had happened," Hermione said quietly, and at the words, Harry felt the full attention of every person in the room snap onto her; even the air had sharpened in response.
"It's not creepy to stare at the person I'm dating," Draco huffed. "If we weren't dating, then it would be creepy. But we are dating. So hence, not creepy."
"It's different now," Harry said softly, sure that Ron was thinking of his only trip to the house when they had been seventeen. Harry had been worried as well the first time he had appeared before the intimidating main gate, certain that he would hear Hermione's screams echoing from the walls, or see the specter of Voldemort lurking deep within every shadow. But the house had not reminded him of that time at all, so full of fear and danger. The Manor no longer represented those things.
With a sigh, Draco pulled back. "Not all of my contacts have been reputable ones, I'm afraid," he admitted, ducking his head. "Blaise was a Shadow."
The look on Harry's face softened as he accepted the present, staring at it in awe for several moments before slowly opening the lid, and Draco heard the other boy's breath catch at the sight. Nestled inside the box was a heavy signet ring with a large emerald glittering up at them. The band was silver and thick, carved in sharp lines and molded into a masculine design that Draco hoped outweighed the fact that it was a bloody
The words automatically raised Harry's hackles and made him want to defend Draco, but he wasn't sure exactly why. Caelix had commented on the
"Er, see what?" Harry's heart was still hammering furiously, increasing its pace as Malfoy handed the square parchment over without a word and raised one eyebrow in expectation. The close-set handwriting on the card was immediately recognizable.
Finally, after a whole century and an entire kilometer of enormous Gryffindor cock, Harry's hips were pressed up tightly against Draco's skin, and he felt Potter shudder as he released a breathless moan, body trembling as he held himself still. "Fuck, Draco," he panted, "oh
Draco clenched the bedsheets in both hands, twisting the fabric tightly as he squirmed and shook, limbs trembling so deliciously it made Harry feel light-headed. He wasn't sure if he had ever come untouched just from sucking another bloke off before, but he felt as though it was a very real possibility at that moment.
"I'm not sure if I can explain it," she said apologetically, hesitating before continuing. "One moment, everything was normal, Crispin and I were talking, and the next everything just felt strange, as if the air was somehow…wrong."
"No," Blaise replied, folding his arms across his chest. If Harry Potter wanted a battle of wills, he was in for the fight of his damned life. The other boy was clearly underestimating Blaise's stubbornness. He obviously had no idea how many stepfathers and potential suitors of his mother's that he had worn down over the years. He was not an easily dissuaded person, nor was he one to take orders lightly.
Draco's eyes grew wide, as though suddenly realizing he had let slip more than he meant to. "Nothing," he choked, trying to laugh, but the weak laughter dried up in his throat, sticking to the walls and coming out in a rasp.
The answer surprised Draco. Had Blaise really done that for her? Had he actually wanted to comfort her? Was he with her at that moment? That seemed oddly considerate of him—almost suspiciously so.
"But why wouldn't he simply kill him?" Hermione said thoughtfully. "That's the thing that keeps irritating me about the whole situation. Why would he wipe Anthony's memories instead of simply disposing of him as he did with all the others?"
Silently, Malfoy gestured to lead the way, both men turning around and beginning to tread the path they had just come from.
"She'll be far too smitten with me to ever allow such a thing to happen," Blaise said with a careless wave of his hand.
Dean chuckled. "To be honest, that sounds a lot more interesting to me than fieldwork. Most of the lads in our year ended up becoming Aurors. But Seamus and I decided that owning a pub sounded better than spending our days chasing after hexes."
"Malfoy wasn't at dinner either," Ron added, and Harry wasn't sure if his tone was more prodding or suspicious. "Something happen between the two of you?"
Malfoy stared at him in surprise for a moment before beginning to struggle. "Get the fuck off me, Potter!" he shouted. Harry tightened his hold and pressed his body tightly against the one thrashing in his grip, using his weight to hold the flailing boy secure, refusing to allow Malfoy's propensity for dramatics to spoil things between them. Harry already knew that the Slytherin had a tendency to run from the things that upset him, and Harry would not allow the blond's need for theatrics and avoidance to prevent Harry from explaining.
"So you're saying that you four get to control the entire situation and all of our lives just because you're fucking
Malfoy nodded again, lowering his head even further until his chin was practically buried in his chest. "We both know that my feelings for you are much stronger than your feelings for me, if those feelings even exist at all. And we both know you could certainly do better than me, and that most of the school wants to be with you. And I also know that you don't actually owe me anything, least of all fidelity or any sort of promises of faithfulness, but…"
"What happened, Nott?" Ron asked, sounding as confused as Harry felt. "I thought you said she had been attacked?"
Draco stared at him for several seconds. "You fucking better be," he said quietly, eyes searching Harry's face, and Harry had to turn from the inspection before his entire body combusted.
The use of Draco's first name finally succeeded in snapping Draco's attention up to meet Potter's earnest gaze. "You don't?" he croaked, wondering why his voice was so scratchy and his eyes were so hot.
A nasty chuckle slithered toward the blond from somewhere in the darkness. "Someone has to be, might as well be me. You should be rotting behind bars in Azkaban for eternity with the rest of your disgusting excuse for a family. You should never have been allowed back at Hogwarts, Malfoy, you made a mistake by surviving. I'm just correcting it, is all."
"Fucking hell Potter, you really are quite set on taking on far more than your fair share of martyrdom, aren't you?" Draco sounded frustrated. "Listen to me," he jerked Harry's chin down to force him to meet his eye. "It. Is. Not. Your. Fault." Each word was pronounced slowly. "I know exactly what you're thinking; you're shit at hiding your emotions. So stop it right now, because I'm telling you that you did
Draco didn't want to see him, fine. Harry would find some way around that in order to speak to the blond. He headed back to the Tower and hoped fervently that his message was being delivered to Draco. Hopefully, Draco would agree to listen to Harry and allow him to somehow fix this. He
Zacharias stared at him, breathing heavily. His eyes were large and round and his mouth gaped open. "But it wasn't me," he whispered, lips barely moving. "It wasn't me."
Instantly, Potter flushed a deep crimson and shuffled his feet nervously, shooting his own stinging glare at his friend. "Shut up, Ron," he mumbled in mortification.
Harry felt as though he could spend the rest of his life kissing Draco. Draco's lips were so soft, tasted so sweet, fit so perfectly with Harry's own. Harry couldn't remember the last time he had connected so quickly and so intensely with another person. He honestly wasn't sure if he ever had before.
"What?" Draco gasped, feeling his hold on the knife loosen in surprise. "You're one of the Hallows?"
"Potter," Blaise greeted, and Draco wanted to kick him for daring to assume that he had in any way been included in Potter's
Caelix appeared doubtful. "But why would Zabini be seeking such violent retribution? Whoever is killing them off is seriously angry about something."
, but he looked up and glared at the brunet fiercely, freezing him mid-step. "Just go," Draco said sharply. "I will contact the others, I promise. But for now…" his feeble voice trailed off as the glare melted away and he slumped once more against the wall in defeat. "For now I just…I can't. I need…space. To think. Please." Trying to ignore the fact that he had just used the word
them leave," Wire added, "after Morgue is done with you, I'll carve your lungs straight out of your chest and feed them to the fucking dogs."
"He's in Azkaban," the blond whispered, shaking his head. No, Wisp was clearly mistaken. The man had been in Azkaban since the trials just after the final battle. There was no way his magical signature could have been found at the scene of Pansy's attack. That had happened just outside of Diagon Alley, for Merlin's sake! The man was an easily recognized Death Eater, he could not just go strolling around Diagon Alley without being noticed.
At the slim possibility that she might indeed know something and he might finally start getting some sort of answers, Harry's stomach tightened even further in anticipation.
"Something like that," Harry snorted softly. Silence fell like a curtain behind his words and he found himself taking half a step backward.
"I'm not a prude!" Draco snapped, uncomfortably reminded of his earlier conversation with Potter about the blond's virginity. Was he really the oldest virgin left in the whole school? Why did he go to school with so many goddamn slags? "Just because I'm not willing to suck off every bloke who even remotely glances my direction in the hopes of gaining his attention doesn't mean I'm a prude!"
The more presents Harry opened, the more his considerable pile dwindled until finally, he came to one without a card. The shiny crimson paper was torn away with curious fingers to discover a handsome leather photo album underneath, one that he opened to find a picture of his own face grinning back up at him. A tiny Ginny had her arm slung through his, nuzzling into his side as they stood leaning against one another; the next page was a picture of them locked in a fierce embrace after a victorious Quidditch match; the page after was of them sharing a kiss.
An impossible solution came to him without warning, crashing over him like a cold tidal wave and making Draco's head snap up, eyes wide with shock. "Oh my god," he breathed, dangling weakly in his chains as his knees buckled beneath him. "I had nearly forgotten…Vince's first wand…"
Draco made a soft sound in the back of his throat, feeling swept away in a pleasant haze of sensation, the feel of Harry everywhere, his touch, his smell, his warmth. The kiss deepened and all thoughts of breakfast were quickly forgotten. Who could remember to be hungry when Harry was kissing them? Who could bother to care about anything else outside of Harry Potter when the man in question was pressing his entire body so deliciously against their own? Draco wanted nothing more than to lock himself up with only Harry for company, just the two of them alone together in one room, a room with a very thick door and several, if not dozens or possibly hundreds, of locking spells in place.
"Oh! Would you like to come with me?" Luna asked happily, eyes sparkling. "I would love the company. It can get very cold and lonely out there by myself."
"This could make it stop completely though, Draco!" Blaise argued. "This is your best shot at gaining back
"Shit, Harry, maybe you really should get checked out by Pomfrey." Ron sounded concerned now, but Harry didn't want his concern. He just wanted silence. "Something is clearly wrong with you. I mean, look at yourself!"
"Yeah," Blaise said, "nobody outside of the three of us is willing to tie their names with ours, especially in this school. You're the only one so far since the war ended who's even been willing to be seen with us in public. This really is dead decent of you, Harry."
With an internal sigh, Draco finally allowed his gaze to lock onto the other man. "I have no idea how long I'll be," he said in a bored tone, as though the impending conversation was of no importance. What could Potter possibly wish to speak about?
"Well, aren't I the special one then." Potter's smile was soft, his words were warm, and Draco felt the sudden urge to kiss him again.
But Draco hadn't even finished deciding whether he wanted to speak or remain silent before Blaise began to answer for him. "Well," he said matter-of-factly, "from what I understand, Draco is no longer a virgin, Potter is great in bed and rather generous with his usage of lubricant, nobody got their dicks bitten, and Potter decided to tell Draco how much he's in love with him and Draco is now wallowing in an entire emotional river of regret. And then I'm pretty sure that's when I came in, right as the river and the wallowing began. After that I know for sure is when
Granger hesitated, appearing torn between her desire to lead a boring unadventurous life and the naked hope on Harry's face.
. You talk about him all the time and even when you're not talking about him, I can tell that you're thinking about him. Your eyes glaze over and you get this distant look on your face and it's like you completely vanish into your own thoughts of him."
"It's not your fault, Harry," Hermione whispered, hugging him again. "I know that everything hurts now and it all seems so awful and hopeless, but things will get better again, I promise. Everything will sort itself out, you'll see. Just keep telling yourself that you were as much an innocent victim in this as Malfoy was; neither of you is to blame for any of it. Neither of you is at fault."
"No," Malfoy said simply, and Harry shot him a pointed look, one the blond chose to ignore. "Boot is too smart to simply wander off alone like that; he would never have left his partner behind. Someone obviously did something to him. He's clearly already dead."
Sinking down to the cold tile of the floor, he rested his forehead against his knees and allowed himself to cry. For Pansy. For Theo. For Millicent and Tracey. For his mother and father. For Vincent. For Greg. For the fact that Blaise was there, in his home, still looking as beautiful as he had the last time Draco had seen him, when the man had all but ripped the heart from Draco's chest to leave a gaping wound behind, as well as the wrenching silence and cold nights that Blaise's absence had left in its wake.
Face burning, Draco turned away without another word and marched off into the maze of bookshelves, praying he would find better friends in the stacks, friends who knew how to bloody well be insulted when he wanted them to be.
She raised a sardonic eyebrow at him. "I can't just ignore only one of three people in the room, not including myself, Draco. That would be bad manners."
"Well, after I came out and confronted them," she inhaled deeply, "I demanded that they hand the potions over to me immediately, which they did. And I made them sit there while I summoned the potion I kept from the Hufflepuff girl the other day and tested them against each other. And, Harry…"
Taking a bigger step back, Harry began to scan the small parlor they had found them in to see who was present. From what he could tell, the only five in there were the other four Gryffindors and Padma. Where was everyone else?
"What, Harry?" Draco said innocently. "You and I both know it wasn't pity that made you put my dick in your mouth."
. He knew how he now stared at him—by looking in any direction that Draco was not in. And so Harry could not be there, going against every single rule the brunet had implemented himself ever since that disastrous day two weeks ago. And Draco didn't feel like he was asleep, so he wasn't dreaming. But there was also no way it could be real, which would mean that…
Shivering at the smooth, almost syrupy way he had murmured the words, Draco held his arms out and spun slowly in a circle, knowing that his clothing was too tight to hide anything larger than the switchblade he always carried on him.
Smith flushed at the question, marching forward angrily to hand Harry his wand without a word. Sighing, Harry checked it and handed it back.
"Yes," Draco said vaguely, deepening the light kisses to something more intense. He did not want to have to admit out loud how much the present really did mean to him. He had never been gifted a photo album before, especially from someone who meant as much to him as Harry did.
Even through the thick fog separating his brain from the rest of his body, Draco remembered that he did not trust Blaise and longed to test the bottle to make sure it was indeed a Pain Relieving Potion, but he had no idea where his wand was and was in far too much agony to think clearly enough to find it.
At that moment, Draco felt more at ease than he could remember feeling in the longest time, more than he thought should even be possible, considering the horrifying reality still awaiting him on the other side of the bedroom door. And even though he knew he should be terrified, knew that death was still coming for him, ready to violently spring out and snatch him away at any moment, as he lay in silent darkness wrapped securely in Harry's arms, Draco felt nothing but content—happy, even. And even if horror and death found him in the morning, for that one night, he felt
Draco's curiosity melted away to be replaced by a look of surprise. "You are?" he breathed, staring at Harry as though trying to pierce skin with his gaze.
"Don't!" Harry said fiercely, resting his forehead against Draco's as he held him safely in his arms. "Don't apologize for anything, Draco, please. We'll talk about everything later, I promise. But for now, let's just get you to hospital, yeah?"
"How'd you like my present?" Harry taunted, feeling the skin tighten over his knuckles as he clenched his fists tighter. "How badly did you miss your steering wheel?"
"What House do you think I would have been in?" Caelix wondered, tapping his chin with one long finger. "Had I been fortunate enough to go to Hogwarts, of course."
"I think," Harry said, heart pounding furiously, "that the thing you should really be worried about is explaining why you seem so obsessed with Draco and who he's lusting after. I feel like
"How could this many people be murdered in a house full of people and none of us heard a damn thing?" Ron asked, turning his back on the bodies.
At first, the student body had trouble accepting it. They blinked and stared and pointed and whispered and several of them even
"Draco," Pansy said coyly, eyes running up and down Potter's body, "has your boyfriend realized yet that he's still half-naked?"
, the three of us, a good plan! We were just going to ignore them all forever and hope they went away for the rest of eternity, you remember that!"
"Oh fuck!" Ron laughed even harder. "You didn't tell us that! Oi! Charlie!" He turned to yell loudly over his shoulder, and everybody turned their attention to him. "You know that truck Harry stole today from the D.E.'s?" Charlie nodded, looking amused. "It was Wolf's own fucking truck!"
"What, Malfoy?" Harry breathed, desperately needing the man to finish what he had been trying to say.
, Draco mused, twisting a silvery strand of hair around one finger in thought, that would not explain why Potter's hearing had apparently failed as well, because there Potter sat, only inches away from the blond, stiff and rigid and positively radiating fury. The man was practically shaking with it, for god's sake, his fingers trembling with suppressed rage as he gripped a quill tight enough to snap the thing in half. The Gryffindor wasn't even pretending to read the text, and despite the quill still clenched in hand—about to shatter in his grasp at any second, surely—he had yet to take a single note.
"Aaand, I take it back, Potter, we're no longer friends," Blaise sniffed. "Now wallow in your lonely heartbreak and pitiful misery."
Lighting his wand, Harry held it high and peered closely at the map, willing the dot to reveal itself. It finally did, but not where the brunet would have guessed at all.
After dinner, he opens another bottle of wine and we move to the living room, sitting side-by-side on a couch in front of the fireplace and talking, our thighs barely brushing. As my focus drifts to his thighs, I shift closer and trail my fingertips along the denim of his jeans, glancing up at his face through my eyelashes. He gazes at me calmly through half-lidded eyes, but as my touch travels higher, he reaches out to stop me, slipping his fingers into mine instead and holding tightly.
"You'll see," Zacharias said desperately, fists clenched. "You'll see when you speak to him! He's the guilty one, not me! I didn't touch Kevin! I didn't do a thing to him! I never touched that knife and I never hurt Kevin!"
"Must you agree with his lies, Potter?" Draco sighed in exasperation, shaking his head in embarrassed amusement.
But no, Harry didn't think Remus would. The man was nowhere near as quick-tempered as Ron and was certainly more careful about the things he said.
Several moments of intense heat later, he could feel himself cracking into those thousand pieces as pale fingers gripped his hips tighter. Harry stuttered out a warning, one that Malfoy ignored, stroking the skin of Harry's hip in encouragement and at the approval, Harry's back arched against the wall as he cried out and came
"Maybe…" Greg sounded hesitant once more, "Maybe you should. I mean, not now, 'cos if the killer can find me in Germany, I'm sure he can find you in France, but maybe after it's all over and we're still alive, like you said we'd be, you could go somewhere else with your mum. You seem sad here." The words were accompanied by a long glance around the room, as though he had been speaking about Draco's chambers specifically, but Draco knew that was not what he meant. "I think moving somewhere else helped me," Goyle confessed, looking down at his large hands. "It helped to get away from everything. Especially, you know…" he gulped, "after Vince died. I had to go somewhere where I wasn't always seeing him everywhere, didn't I?"
"What?" Ron sounded gobsmacked. "What do you mean you don't have house-elves? You have to have house-elves! I mean, fuck, look at your house! You used to have house-elves!"
"Sorry," he said weakly, dragging shaky fingers through his hair in embarrassment. "It just caught me off guard, you know?" He placed his elbows on his knees and rubbed his eyes with his fingers, leaning his face wearily against his palms. "Mostly I've dealt with all the shit from then, but sometimes, something like that just sneaks up on me." He glanced away from Malfoy, sure that the blond would pounce on the weakness and mock him the same way he had done for years. But the man surprised him yet again.
"You really can't figure out which of them did it?" Zabini asked, only the barest hint of accusation in his voice. "There are only two suspects."
Half-turning his head, Draco saw that Potter was facing away from him, speaking to the far wall, and the sight twisted something in Draco's chest. "I'm sorry," he said helplessly, unsure how to handle the situation. How could he navigate through a situation rife with so many feelings that he was not accustomed to dealing with? Draco was so terrible at feelings, both at having feelings and at understanding his feelings. What should he do? What could he say that would make everything better?
"Right," Draco nodded, inhaling several deep breaths. "I can do that; I can be around Muggles. I can speak to Muggles and be courteous. I'm a charming fucking bastard, damn it, I can do this." Draco would be so charming that by the end of the date, Potter would be even more in love with him than he already was.
"Can't," Harry mumbled. "How does someone relax after this morning? Another body, two suspects, a million more questions, zero answers, and still no way out of this mess. None of it—"
Poor Harry and Draco, so confused and insecure! If anyone was hoping this story would be resolved quickly with lots of smiles and happy words, I apologize. But for anyone hoping for even more drama and hurt feelings, just wait, because Caelix will be in the next chapter. With Harry. Alone in a room together. See where this might be going? Also, Goyle has arrived! The slumber party is almost complete! Just missing one more person and then the fun can really start!
"Don't start throwing potatoes at one another," Granger sighed, and Draco scowled at her. Damn it, why did she have to be so bloody observant and give away his secret weapon?
Pansy snorted loudly. "What kind of moron could bring Potter here without even fucking realizing it was Harry Potter they were bringing? I mean, that really is its own level of idiocy."
Ron shrugged as he lifted his broom. "Just make sure it's soon, yeah?" He paused in the doorway and turned back to them. "And for the love of Merlin's saggy fucking bollocks, do not ever do that to me again."
"Well, it can't be the second one," Ron frowned. "I mean, Hannah, Mandy, and Terry? Come on, there's nobody who would want to see them dead. Especially over someone like Smith or any of the Slytherins. If we're going in terms of least popular, it'd definitely be that lot at the top of the list."
"Okay," Draco said, sounding relieved. He took a deep breath before whispering, in a voice that made Harry shiver, "Thank you, Seek. I'll see you soon."
And Draco cried for himself. He cried because he was scared, he cried because he was alone. He cried because everybody in his life up to that point had somehow abandoned him, somehow left him behind. He cried because he had thought like an idiot that Blaise might actually have possibly loved him, only to find out that the man had been having affairs for
"Draco!" Harry called desperately, sprinting faster and cursing the wind for swallowing his plea before it could reach Malfoy's ears.
"Er…" Potter flushed as he raised one hand to rake through his wild hair. "Well, I'm not sure when it actually started, but…sixth year, I suppose? Maybe the end of fifth? I mean—" he hurried to continue at the sight of Draco's mouth dropping open in shock, "don't get me wrong, I did genuinely hate you. Even at the same time I was…" his blush darkened alarmingly, "even at the same time I was, you know—" he looked absolutely mortified, "attracted to you. But then…"
At the possible meaning behind those words, Draco leaned up on his elbows to look Potter in the eye. "Was that your first time doing that?" he asked cautiously. That couldn't possibly have been, not with the way the adoring public seemed to throw themselves at the man. He could have absolutely
He hurried from the library, feeling suffocated by the smothering effect of being surrounded by walls and walls of books, enclosed in a tight cage of novels all seeming to glare down at him. It gave him the claustrophobic feeling of being trapped. How did anyone breathe in that room?
"No, I most certainly did not," Draco warned, plucking up Potter's nearby wand and using it to summon his scattered clothing.
Draco glared, the expression only making Fenrir laugh harder. He pitched forward, catching himself on the bar with another guffaw.
Time passed and he was unsure how long he remained curled up in that position, only noticing how numb parts of him were starting to grow when Blaise's obnoxious seductive drawl startled him.
"This weekend," Draco agreed with a smile. "We can talk about the details tomorrow. I'm going to leave it up to you to find out the name of a good shop from Granger or someone and exact directions on how to get there, since I'm mostly just coming along to look pretty and offer my opinion—two things I'm excellent at, mind you—so I'm leaving the actual details up to you. Deal?"
He couldn't stop replaying it all in his mind, couldn't stop his brain from projecting across his closed eyelids the image of Draco's stricken face, Caelix's hurt expression. He could still feel Draco's body pressed so snugly against his own, the way it had felt; could still hear the sounds that Malfoy had made.
Hary and Nott both froze as the jerky sounds of a locked knob being tested sounded in the silent room.
Glaring a fierce grin at the brunet, Wolf jumped forward, slashing his knife through the air without caring that he barely missed one of his own brothers as Harry easily dodged the attack. He stepped to the side, forcing Wolf to adjust himself in response as he again slashed through the air, one slash after another that Harry managed to avoid, swinging the knife in movements large enough to make it seem like he was trying to slice the sky into pieces. Harry continued to duck and weave, continually changing positions and dancing backward, staying on his toes to avoid causing his legs to buckle beneath his own weight.
Harry nodded, but it was stiff and mechanical and Draco growled in annoyance. "Would you blame me for Vincent's death?" he asked suddenly, startling Harry into automatically responding.
Also, I did complete the outline for the rest of the story (with the exception of the epilogue, which I'm still deciding on) so the chapters should start coming more quickly than they were before. So stay tuned, lovers! The madness will most definitely be continuing :)
"Fuck," Harry swore. "Okay, then maybe Robards didn't get my Patronus last night. We'll both send one this time. And Hermione too. Your wards wouldn't prevent those being sent, would they?" He turned to Malfoy, watching the man's nose scrunch up in thought.
"But what if he's the one who broke his father out of Azkaban?" Draco asked in a whisper. "What if he really did somehow come back? What if Cyril and Vince are working together, and he's as equally behind these attacks as his father?"
"Maybe we could do some sort of trade," Wire suggested, running one finger along Tracey's collarbone. "We lend our girls to each other for a night. I would say we could all party together, but I really don't want to see Morgue's ugly naked arse. Not if I ever wanna be able to get hard ever again, at least."
conversations with people outside of the five of us, Potter. You clearly underestimate how much society dislikes us."
," Harry sighed, shaking his head at the dark-skinned berk seated across from him in the Great Hall.
Draco knew that expression. Blaise wanted to talk. He had not been deterred by Draco's silence and was using the time when Draco was weak and emotionally vulnerable to his advantage, the bastard.
"More like a work-related line," the brunet grinned. "Come on, I want to hear more about what you were talking about."
A sudden loud throat clearing snapped Draco's attention away from the enraged boy to his right, swinging back to land on Slughorn, and the blond was grateful for the excuse to look away. He could feel his face flooding with heat and did the only thing he could do to protect himself, immediately crumpling in on himself even more, hunching his shoulders and allowing his long hair to swing forward and curtain his face, helping to hide him from view of the others.
As he spoke, Harry drew his arm back once more, unsure if he would actually hit Smith again but enjoying the cringe of fear that jerked through the Hufflepuff's body.
. I hope you and that bitch are happy together." And with that, she turned on her heel and swept quickly from the room, not looking back as she allowed the door to slam shut behind her.
," he gestured between the two of them, "to be some casual, secret thing. I want to keep seeing you and I don't want to have to sneak around to do it."
Malfoy, and he had been so sure that he would continue to hate him forever. But every word that the other boy spoke sent fresh waves of pained torment slashing through Harry's chest, leaving him with the desire to grab Malfoy by the shoulders and shake him until he finally snapped out of it and came to his senses. Unfortunately, what with Malfoy's injuries and Harry's intense desire to cause him no further pain, shaking him roughly by the shoulders was one of the worst things Harry could have done right then.
His heart sank as he glanced down the corridor the others were strolling down, noting the way it seemed to stretch for miles before splitting into two branches and extending out of sight.
"How the fuck is that not an ultimatum?!" Harry shouted furiously. "Either I take you back or you kill yourself! It doesn't matter how you fucking word it, that's the choice you're talking about!"
The Auror glanced up to smile at Draco shyly in a way that made Draco's breath catch and the temptation to kiss the man returned full-force, but he managed to smother it with difficulty. They had just barely become friends, he was not about to push his luck by making a move on the man—no matter how beautiful his smile or how green his eyes. For now, they would have to be appreciated from a distance.
"Fuck," Ron swore in a low voice. "Harry, where the fuck did that come from? What the bloody buggering
"There have to be at least a dozen different innuendos I could make to that statement about hard things and the doing of them," he smirked, "if only I was crass and immature enough to do so."
Draco Malfoy was staring at him intensely, gaze fierce even from a distance, grey eyes boring into Harry's own sharply. The panic grew to an alarming level and he struggled for a moment with his frozen body—willing it to move, step back, drop his light hold on Ginny,
"They didn't know," she said, clasping Ron's hand tightly and seeming to prepare herself to deliver bad news; Harry's stomach tightened. "But I took them to McGonagall and as soon as McGonagall asked them who they had bought the potions from, they broke down and told her."
"Oh god, Harry," the blond whispered, and Harry silently agreed. His limbs felt strange and tingly, his entire body feeling odd. His insides felt numb and lifeless, while his skin felt as though it was crawling, as though something prickly and unpleasant was creeping across every inch of his flesh.
"I'll come see you," he finally said, sitting up. He may not be ready to leave the only home he had just yet, but he knew with certainty that he needed to see Seek. "I'll need time to think of an excuse, but Fen is injured anyway, so hopefully he'll have other things to think about."
"Of course," Draco nodded. "I mean, I really don't know anything about Muggle clothing, but I'd be more than happy to accompany you somewhere and help you pick something less hideous out. Because really, Potter, this shirt is dreadful. Your cousin clearly has no taste and you simply can't have someone else's bad taste added to your already-existent Gryffindor lack of taste. That is just too much bad taste for a single person to possess, your head may just explode from the force of it. And
Biting his lip nervously, he tucked his wand out of sight and approached Caelix at a slow pace, stopping a good distance away.
"Well," Harry squirmed uncomfortably. "I do need to speak to him alone, though, actually." As Draco's eyes flashed, the other man hurried to explain, "About us! I want to tell him about you and me. I need to explain it all to him and hopefully, he won't hate me too badly, but I feel like that's a conversation that we really should have in private." Draco remained silent and Harry continued speaking in a soft voice, "You can trust me, Draco. I swear that I would never do anything like that to you. I'm not
"Oh, er, Retention Potion," he mumbled. "I was just…curious?" Draco snorted and shook his head at the words.
"You can't hate Malfoy anymore?" Ron said slowly, sounding as though the words tasted funny on his tongue. "So Malfoy is the one you're talking about?"
"I definitely won't stop you," Harry whispered, shivering at the look in Malfoy's eyes, almost as though he didn't want to swallow just Harry's cock, but his body and his entire being, maybe even his soul, as well.
"I'm glad," Harry smiled broadly against the other boy’s lips, hot pleasure swooping through him at Malfoy’s obvious delight, but then pulled back to look him in the eye. "By the way, why
"I'm sorry," Draco sighed, flipping the blade of the knife away and tucking it back into his pocket. "I had no idea."
Green eyes shot him an icy glare. Thwarting evil was a perfectly acceptable hobby, one he had been doing practically since birth. And the evil he thwarted was never imagined. It was real and it was dangerous and it was
"I'm sorry if I've made you feel smothered," said Harry quietly, unwrapping his arms from the blond and withdrawing his touch.
"Your hair is longer," Potter suddenly blurted, flushing an even darker shade when Draco raised an eyebrow at him.
"Date not going so well, Potter?" I murmur, and am amused to see him jump as I step from the shadows of the fountain.
"Y-yes," he answered in a shaky voice, nodding frantically as Draco pulled out and slid back inside, angling for his prostate and managing to press directly into the sensitive bundle of nerves within Potter's body, making the brunet's eyelids flutter shut as his hips bucked wildly. "God, Draco,
"I didn't use the Invisibility Cloak," Harry interrupted, sounding amused. "I didn't have to. You led us there of your own free will, without any sort of prompting from either of us. We didn't even have to ask."
He raises his wand, most likely to perform the necessary preparation and lubrication spells, but I wrestle it from him and toss it away. I'm not sure of what kind of game he's playing, but I'm not about to make it easier or more enjoyable for him.
"He's right, Gregory, we don't have time for this," a voice spoke somewhere behind Draco, and Draco's eyes flew open automatically at the sound. He recognized that voice, he
"So, um," Draco began, feeling his neck prickle with sweat. "I, er, didn't wrap it." He glanced down at the plain box in sudden panic, wondering if Harry would be disappointed with the presentation of the gift. He had learned at a young age that presentation was always important—how could he have forgotten such a thing so easily? Damn it, Harry at least deserved a proper presentation for his gift! It was the very first Valentine's gift that Draco had ever given to anyone and he had already fucked it up!
"O-oh my god," Draco groaned, legs twitching on either side of Harry's head. He could feel Draco's toes curling against his back, both legs now slung over Harry's shoulders. "Jesus Christ, Seek!"
Draco felt himself slowly calming, but he knew—it was too much. The whole day had just been too much. "I can't, Harry," he whispered, breath finally evening out. "I'm can't, I'm sorry, I can't, I just need…"
