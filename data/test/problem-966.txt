The woman came over, and Draco immediately recoiled.  The place might be different, but why should the people?
Ron turned to watch Malfoy leave, watched as he stumbled, a pronounced limp making his steps appear difficult.  He had to steady himself against the wall more than once.  It was painful to witness.  He was only in a pair of pyjamas.  His naked feet looked a little blue.  It was only just February, there was still a frost in the air.  Where would he go?  Ron couldn't stop himself from thinking, dressed like that.
'Harry...'  Draco got out, his voice high and stricken.  'I...I can't...'  He couldn't move, frozen with fear.
Harry didn't blame him, not one bit.  If it had been months ago, he would be revelling in the same gossip, wanting to know everything about the boy from Slythrin who they all presumed had vanished in cowardice with his fated parents, or even dead.  It had no real consequence for any of them.
'No.  I suppose not.'  Changing the pillowcases, Harry placed them neatly at the head of the little bed.  'He hit me in the face, broke my glasses.  I had a black eye for weeks.  He was a big man, strong.'
'You don't have to do anything.'  Harry told him softly, easing him back down to the bed.  He took his place beside him, didn't even consider giving up his sure hold on Draco's waist.  'You are not ready.  Pomfrey said only to try if you can.'
Those pretty brown eyes looking at him with such hurt, such desperate longing.  Wanting, needing to be told that this was some sick joke, that Harry had not been kissing the one person she could not abide.  A member of a family she had learnt to hate.  A family who had threatened her way and her entire future.  She had every right to be angry, to be fucking furious.  Draco had come to stand for the very worst of humanity.  And there he was, her best friend, kissing him.  Wrapped around the enemy.
'There is now.'  Hagrid told him.  'I know this place isn't nice for you, that it can never be more than a bad memory, but...but it's warm here, dry.  If you ever want to just sit and chat, have a cup of tea, you are more than welcome.'
'I...I'm sorry.'  Draco knew that Filch couldn't send him back to his bed, he didn't have one any longer.  'I didn't...couldn't...'  he stood, suddenly mute, the bile rising once more.  He had nowhere to go, and this caretaker wasn't as stupid as they all liked to think.  He had sense, he had been here long enough to know when he was being lied to.  'I...'
Control, ownership. Pain and domination.  They were the only things he knew, were the only things his body had ever experienced.
There was movement in the hut, hushed voices and footsteps.  The afternoon was getting darker, the evening drawing closer.  Were they leaving him?  Was he to spend the night alone?  Draco's stomach plummeted.  He couldn't.
'Hermione, that was three days ago.  I didn't see the point.'  Harry shrugged, confused by her obvious concern.
'My uncle threw them away.'  Harry swallowed at the memory.  'They were old, he said.  Old and smelly.'
'Come on, there is something else I want to show you.'  Without pause, Harry picked up Draco's hand, leading him slowly away from the open door.
The only thing he had done wrong was not committing murder.  In any other circle that would have been applauded, but not within the company the boy was forced to keep.  He had gone blindly into the darkness, it was all he knew.  Draco Malfoy's fate was mapped out for him on the day he was conceived.
'Erm, Draco.  Why am I in your bed?'  He felt his face flood with heat.  Draco pressed so close to him.
'I'm sorry, I...I should have come sooner.'  Draco spat out, desperate to say all he wanted before the tears began.  'I...I want to...to thank you.'
But there was a man who had stayed, who had not been scared of the person he had been before, of the person he was now.  Scars and pain and nightmares had not made him leave, it had only brought him closer.
'Don't.  Don't you dare.'  Harry was the one to stop it, to stop the threat that his friend now posed towards Draco.  He pushed himself forward, making sure to shield Draco from anything that might be cast his way.  Draco wasn't to be touched, to be hurt.  Whatever the cost.
'Just needed a moment.'  Harry looked up, his face drained and sallow.  'It's been hard, hasn't it.'
It was little consolation that when he turned his heel and took a step, the noise must have startled the boy on the floor.  Ron could hear frantic scrabbling.  No doubt desperate to cover his wounded arm, terrified that someone had seen his secret.  The slight scuff of shoes on the ground, the crunch of glass as he pulled himself to his feet.
He found that he couldn't tear his eyes away from the limping form as Draco carefully picked his way across the uneven path, his footsteps slow.  It pained him to walk so far.  There was a limit to how many times a hip could be shattered and repaired before it was ruined forever.  Draco had long gone past that point.
But it had been in his nightmares.  Every night, when he closed his eyes on the day and looked into his deep imagination.  It was exactly this.
'You're not, are you.'  He heard her whisper.  'You haven't been all right for a long time.  I can see it now.'  She took her hands off him.  Her warm, caring hands.  Draco wanted to reach out, wanted to feel someone again.  It had already been so long.
'It's all right.'  Three simple words were whispered into his hair, lips moving with a careful kiss.  Harry.  It would always be Harry.  'You are safe now.  No one can hurt you.  Never again, Draco.  I swear it with my life.'
'No.'  A soft shake of his head.  'You have no idea what you give me.'  Draco's lips curving into a sad, knowing smile.  'They took all of me.  Everything.  My parents, my mind, my body. They left me with nothing.  I was nothing.'  He shivered despite the warmth.  'In...in that place I knew my life was over.  But then Hagrid found me.  I...I didn't want him too, I wanted to die.  They took it all.'
She had no need to lift her wand and send a volley of warning sparks into the charmed ceiling.  She did not need to raise her voice and demand silence.  Her booted feet, striking the cold flagstones like the staccato rhythm of gunfire, was more than enough to stop the scurrilous gossip, the excited chatter.
'You okay, Harry?'  Hermione, as observant as ever, watched as he continued to push the food around his plate.  'You look terrible.'
Here was a boy stood before him that he wanted to know, a boy he wanted to call friend.  A hope of better things, for himself at least.  A wish of friendship, glamour and recognition from the impossibility that was Harry Potter.  A name he had heard about since he slept in his cradle.
'I don't want you to go.  I don't ever want you to go.'  Draco told him softly.  It was the truth.  No matter what happened now, he needed Harry.  Even if his time with him was drawing to a close.
Not bothering to kick off his slippers or discard his dressing gown, he climbed up onto his bed, dropped the curtains to seclude himself from the rest of his friends, curled himself up into a tight ball, and began to sob.
Draco eyed him, knowing that he wouldn't be able to walk much further without help, even getting this far had taken the last of his strength.
The truth had frightened him, changed everything he thought he already knew.  Surely after that there could be nothing?  It would be better for all concerned if that great revelation was tucked safely away.  It signalled the end to his already young, fractured attempts at a romantic life.
He would never, ever, be able to stand in front of his friends and pretend that Draco wasn't his all.  That he wasn't the only thing he would ever want in his life, the only thing he could never willingly give up.  He wouldn't lie, not anymore.
Ron wanted to run.  Tuck himself away in the Gryffindor bedroom, hide under the covers of his safe little bed with his hands pressed tightly over his ears and stay right there.
Harry remained silent, he was all too aware of the eyes in the room.  He couldn't say.  It hurt that he couldn't tell his friend the reason he didn't give a damn about Quidditch was because of a tired, lonely boy that Ron continued to hate with a passion.  He wanted to be with Draco.  He didn't want the burden of playing a sport that he no longer loved, when he could be curled up in bed, book in hand, reading to someone who had become his...his everything.
'I understand.'  Draco managed a smile, sitting down opposite his fretful teacher.  'It must be difficult.'
But the book on his lap was beyond beautiful, beyond anything he had ever held.  It's simplicity held a magic all of it's own, the golden embossed letters, the thick leather cover, the smell, the touch, the gossamer thin pages.
He watched as Madam Pomfrey pushed aside his stack of books, making room on the small table for the dark wooden bowl she carried.  He tried not to look, tried so hard not to focus on the thin plume of red smoke that spiralled into the air, curling round the curtains and drifting up towards the ceiling.  It was sharp, pungent in an unpleasant way.  Eucalyptus, and something stronger, earthy.  Dark.
'How are you doing, Draco?'  Her voice holding back the emotion, her weathered fingers dabbing the heated liquid against yet another scar.
And Draco.  The Malfoy boy who was so sure of himself, even way back when he first walked through the imposing castle doors.  Bold and brash and oh so confident.  She hadn't taken to him, he was too much like his father before him.
The child was so young, and had been so innocent in the ways of the world.  It made his old heart ache to see the Malfoy boy sobbing in the corridor, not a friend to his name.
He found that the familiarity of returning to Hogwarts was a unexpected comfort.  People had died here, friends and classmates.  Harry thought it might be too difficult to go back, to see where his friends had fallen and not gotten back up.  To taste the fear of death again, to roam the halls that had seen too much blood.  But it wasn't like that.
'Sit up, Draco.'  Madam Pomfrey helped him lean against the pillows.  'You are okay.  It's only a nightmare.'
On the way that he had looked up at him after Slughorn had sloped off and Harry had closed the door firmly behind him.  All huge wet eyes, full of apprehension and hope.  Hope that Harry had meant every single word.
Hermione knew then what it meant, and in her way, she knew it had always been this way for him.  Harry wanted to please everyone, wanted to do what he saw as the right thing.  Himself be damned.  But he couldn't lie to his own wants, to his own flesh.
He had been expecting this day to come, wishing, hoping that he had more time, time to get his head around it, time to come up with a string of excuses.  But no.  The day had finally arrived.  He waited for her to speak again, closing his eyes.  His mouth as dry as old parchment.
Draco had grown to hate the memory.  There would be no grand saviour from the pages of an asinine book.  There would never be a dashing hero to scoop him off the floor and carry him to safety. He quickly discovered that his father had been right in his derision of his mother's pastime.
'Harry...  Don't.'  Draco sobbed, the anguish in Harry's words more than he could bear.  Useless to stop the tears flooding down his face.  'I...I'm sorry, no.  I...I don't t...think that.'  How could he take it back?  How could he make Harry see?  Coughing against the pain, pain that locked itself in his chest.  He wanted to vomit, wanted to scream.  Wanted to throw himself at Harry.  Didn't want to ever let go.
'Course.' He handed the leather book to the slight child, who immediately pulled it to his chest.  It was heavy, and he doubted the journey to McGonagall's office would be made any easier with the added weight.  Hell, the boy didn't look in any fit state to stand, let alone walk much further.
Her hand had been so hot against his bare shoulder, scalding.  Just for a second he allowed her that touch before getting to his feet.
Harry couldn't stop his eyes from raking up the castle walls.  Draco would be there, behind one of those windows.  Perhaps even right now looking down upon them all, seeing for himself the asked for betrayal.
Tears, an admission of cowardice.  He didn't want to fight, and he hadn't.  A cursory examination of his wand confirmed that the last spell it had produced was a simple one.  Water.  Nothing wrong with that.
On shuffling feet, he ambled around the empty hallways, thankfully dinner was still going on, and it would be a while yet before he needed to make a decision and head back to the common room, or, most likely, not bother at all.
'It's okay.'  Draco spoke, a shamed smile touching the corners of his lips.  'I k...know.  I know you were.'  He took Harry's trembling hands into his own and squeezed with what little strength remained left to him.  'No sorry.'
Realisation finally crept up on Harry.  He was with Draco.  Close to him, lying beside him.  In his bed.
'It's okay.  You are okay.'  Endless words, whispered for hours into Draco's shivery skin.  He was quiet now, mute with shock.  Harry's voice a balm for the pain, for the darkness that crept over him.  He wasn't there, he knew that now.  It had been a dream.  A dream that would never fade from his sight, a dream that would follow him, follow them both.  Forever.
The boy from the platform, the neglected child with the sweets and the white owl.  The boy he had gone through school with, argued and laughed with.  They had fought trolls and shared their secrets.  Spells and books and homework, quiet games of chess.  Embarrassing knitted jumpers and Christmas presents.  Quidditch and grief and so much more.
'You.'  The Boy Who Lived hissed, his face so close as he squeezed the air from his lungs.  'How fucking dare you.'
'No, this is something else.'  Hermione shook her head, her knowing eyes not looking away.  'I wasn't there this summer.  I stayed home.  My...my parents wanted me there, I wanted them.  It was difficult.  But I did visit the Burrow.  It...it was horrible, Neville.  I couldn't stay there.'  She glanced to the floor, ashamed by her admission.  'It felt so empty without Fred.'  Hermione paused, searching for the right words.  'It felt wrong without him.'  Swallowing heavily, fighting against the memories.  'But they had a strength together.  Determination.  None more so than Harry.  But now?  Now I look at him and I'm not so sure anymore.'
Hermione was almost about to turn from the grounds and head back inside the warm castle when a flash of black caught her eye.  She hadn't thought to look along the far wall, had figured that Harry would be sitting under a tree, or soring through the evening air on his broom.
Her voice would be angry, her words bright and full of hate.  She knew that as her hand gripped the rail that led down and down.  It would be hard not to throw blame, to look for reasons, and to demand answers.  She wouldn't be able to stop.
Draco had known, from the very moment he had first held the Chocolate Frog card that showed the face of the boy he used to hate so much.  Known from that moment on that he had fallen for Harry Potter.
'I'm too broken.'  Draco whispered, his eyes filling with tears, unable to look at the boy sitting beside him.
'Draco...  No, not today, not after last night.'  There was panic in his voice, desperation.  Not there, not now.  Just the thought of Draco inside of that place again turned Harry's stomach into knots, he couldn't keep his peace over this.  It was too much to stand.  'I'll sort something out. Please.  Not there.  I...I don't want you going in there again.'
He appeared to be gathering up all that had spilled from Draco's ruined bag.  His head bowed as he pulled trampled and spoiled parchment into his arms, he too wanted to help, that much was clear.
'It's all right, Harry.'  Neville tried to soothe, his words mirroring his gentle hands.  'You didn't do anything.  Nothing happened.'
'I wish you didn't struggle to believe me, Draco.'  This time it was Harry who rested his head against Draco's shoulder, exhausted beyond measure.  'I wouldn't say anything I didn't mean.  You know that about me, at least.  I get that this is strange, new and scary.  But I am your friend.  Please believe that.  You have to believe that.'  His voice was little more than a tired sigh, the fight draining from him.
'You cannot go on like this, you will become ill, and where would that leave you?  Where would that leave Draco?'
'It's an angel.'  Draco told him, his gaze also falling to Harry's hands.  'It...It was my mothers.'
'It was nothing.'  Hagrid waved away Draco's words, concentrating on opening cupboards, pulling out a tin, setting biscuits on a plate, anything to keep from turning to the boy who nearly died in his bed all those months ago.
'I've not been happy for a long time.'  Harry admitted, turning to face the boy in the bed, leaning against the wall.  'I...I though killing Him would be the end, would make it all go away.  But...But it didn't work that way.  I thought it would be over.'  Harry hung his head, scrubbing an angry hand over his reddened eyes.  'They died, my...my friends died.  I couldn't stop it, couldn't make it better.  It...it should have been me.  Why wasn't it me?'
Harry would gladly throw down his wand, wrap his bare hands around that corrupt throat and squeeze the very life, the very breath from that sham of a wizard.
'Erm, Professor?'  He stopped by the open door.  'I'm afraid I am slightly early.'  He hitched his fraying bag higher up his shoulder, ever mindful that the strap was close to breaking point.  He should wait in the corridors, it was only fair to the uncomfortable Potions Master.  But he was cold, needed to sit himself into a chair.
The crackers had been pulled, the food eaten and the presents opened, all saving two that remained unknown, waiting for night to fall.
'D...dreaming.'  Draco turned his head to the sound of Harry's gentle voice.  He was too afraid to open his eyes, knowing that he would only see darkness, the four walls of the Cell closing in around him.  The sound of his own screaming.  Not the soft cadence of the voice that promised him the world.
Every pair of eyes turned in her direction, every mouth closed, and every one of them, with their shrill voices and their rumors, waited in silence.
'I don't believe that.'  Draco tucked himself closer to Harry's side, sensing his sadness.  He wanted to do nothing more than comfort him, he looked that miserable.
His wet trousers clung to his thighs, the smell of his own body drifting around them in a fug of embarrassment as Harry held him, right there in the open corridor of Hogwarts.
The duo parted at the grand entrance doors.  Harry nodded briefly at his Headmistress, not even trying to attempt a smile.  He turned to head off in the direction of Gryffindor Tower.
'Don't.  Don't do this.  Don't push me away.  I can't stop all this, I can't make everyone else see who you are, what you mean to me.  I can't make anything better for you, or give you back all you have lost.  But, Draco, please, you have...  You have to...'  It was all too much.  The night closing around him, the argument with Ron, the pain in Draco's voice.  Harry couldn't bear it.  'You said it, Draco, you said the words.  Don't...don't take them back.  Not now.'
Harry's own nightmare, sobbing on the floor.  Back carved into dark stripes of rotting infection.  Shaking shoulders and a whimper.  A dying boy, trapped in a body that was no longer his own.  He would never shake that image, it would mercilessly haunt his dreams, touch his daylight.  The boy he loved lying before him.
'Take...take him to his bed.  Make him leave.'  Draco begged, unable to tear his eyes away from Harry's weary form.  'Please, you have to help him.'
'Everything okay?'  Professor McGonagall asked gently as she stepped closer, seeing how pale Draco looked, how near to sleep he was, and how tightly Harry held him close.
'I honestly don't.'  He raised his hands in supplication.  'But I've been watching him too.'  They continued to look on in silence from the corner of the crowded shop as Harry took his purchases over to the till.
She was loathed to wake him from his slumber, he looked in desperate need of a few moments more.  But the evening was drawing to a close, the Great Hall no doubt already filled with dining students and teachers alike.
'I have one of Salazar Slytherin somewhere, I'll find it for you, chuck this one in the bin.'  Disgusted, he tossed the offending card that bore his likeness onto the pile of books that still rested neatly on Draco's table.
'Go on then.'  Harry stepped closer, his eyes stinging.  He had done this to them all.  He had been the one to lie, to keep the secrets close.  He had hurt them, just as they had hurt him.
'The thought terrifies me, Draco.  That...that I may have known who...who did those...those things to you.'  Draco watched as Slughorn reached into his jacket pocket and pulled out a silver flask of what could only contain alcohol.  'I may have taught them, I might have dined with them.'  His hands shaking as he unscrewed the stopper.
But Harry had.  Right there.  The scruffy boy who knew nothing of his world, who knew nothing of a Malfoy.  Refused his hand, and dashed his dreams with a cutting retort against the rising tide of his shame.  And he had known, known that he was just a silly little boy.  He would always be that silly little boy.
Sure, he had watched, they all had.  It was part of the punishment.  Part of his Lord's fun.  Watch and learn, see what was sure to become of you should you fall out of line, should you dared to cross, to turn from the righteous path.
'No.  No sleep.'  Draco murmured.  The thought of closing his eyes was more than he could stand.  'Can't.'
'Harry!'  Ron's violent cry ripped through the cowering students and parted the crowds.  'Let him go!'  He dragged the book to his chest, held the card in his sweating hand.
'My father is not in the past, Milly. Neither is Pansy.  She was your friend, and she cannot return.'
The one thing that never changed was the fact that he would leave each and every night, and not return until morning.
'At first.'  Harry admitted.  'You think that life cannot get worse for him, and for a while it can't.  But he is found, rescued by kind people, people who will love him.'
But it would still be cold.  It would always just be the dirty floor of an open corridor.  The stone hard, the glass sharp, the eyes watching.  This was no place for two battle scarred, world weary young men to lie.
He was dropped from the arms.  Falling hard onto the chilled earth.  The man stood over him, looking down at what he had become.  Draco expected more pain, he tried to curl up, anticipating it, but nothing.  The man in black just walked away.
There were no china cups, no steaming pot full to the brim with Draco's favourite tea, no plate of tempting treats to encourage him to eat.
'Mr. Malfoy is out of danger.  I don't expect him to wake any time soon.'  She spoke to the dark haired boy kindly.
He didn't have his smile when he slid into the bed beside him.  He didn't need to lift his arm up any more for Draco to settle close beside him, his hand lacing with his.  Harry could remember the smell of his clean hair, the brush of the growing strands tickling his cheek as they sat as close as could be.
Rage boiled inside of him, listening to the quiet, heartbreaking sounds Draco was making from under the blankets.  The muffled sobs ripped through his head, burned in his chest.  It was torture for Draco to be picked up, to be carried the short distance to the castle.  But there was no other way.
'He almost passed out in Potions this morning.'  Hermione added quietly, quickly.  Breaking her promise to keep Draco's secret.  'I had to help him sit down.  I...  Harry knows, and we didn't, we wouldn't listen to him.  We got angry and hateful.  We have been thoughtless when it's likely that they both needed someone to talk to, someone to listen to them.'
He reached out for the shining glass, the thin skin of his fingertips grazing over the rough stone floor, catching, parting.  He was that careless now.  His only thought was to hold that broken bottle close to his body.  To where the voices lived.
'I very much doubt that.'  Ron spoke, somewhat apprehensive.  The hate in Harry's eyes coming back to mind.  'But let's find out, shall we.'
Draco could hear his own heartbeat pounding in his ears, drowning out all the words from Slughorn as he addressed the incoming students.  He turned too fast, staggering, almost falling, reaching out for the desk that was thankfully under his hand.  His eyes tight shut against the throbbing of his heart, his stomach churning with his half eaten toast.  He couldn't collapse here, not in front of the students who continued to file in, not in front of his teacher, the one he had made cry.  And especially not in front of Nott, he knew the boy continued to watch his every move.  Cold, calculating.
He was carried for hours by a man who didn't speak.  He knew from the feel of him that he was one of those who had liked to hurt him.  This man liked it nasty, dirty and violent.  He couldn't even struggle, his body too weak to fight.  All he could do was wait to see what fresh horror this man had conjured up for him.
'I'm not going to Hex you, Ron.  I was wrong earlier.  You were right, I haven't been telling you the truth, and I'm sorry about that.  But there is no fault here, there isn't anyone to blame.  Draco hasn't done anything wrong.'
'He is still strong, Hermione.'  Something in the tone of Neville's voice made her head turn back around, made her look Neville in the eye.
Keeping Draco warm helped.  It stilled the horror of that time, lessened the voices that only promised Draco's end.  Blankets.  A fire, and his arms.
But there had been something wrong, it had always been there, and Ron had known from the moment the Slytherin had crossed the threshold into Gryffindor.  So very fucking wrong.
'No.'  Draco was quick to halt Harrys jerky attempt to leave him.  His hands pressed into Harry's back, drawing him close again.  'Not for me.  For you.  My...my skin.  I must feel horrible to you.'
In the distance he could see the enormous dog sitting beside a white mound, his head thrown back in anguish, crying into the night air.  The moonlight that permeated the thick trees did little to disclose what the indistinct shape could possibly be.  Far too small to be an injured Unicorn or Centaur, Hagrid got closer.
'I wouldn't be so sure.'  Her smile was kind, all knowing.  'Harry was with you because he cares, Draco.  Sending him away, leaving him, will not change that.  If anything, it will make him all the more determined.  You have known him for all of your school life.  Tell me something, Draco, has he ever struck you as the kind of person who is able to walk away?  As someone who is prepared to give up anything for an easy life?'
McGonagall kept a step behind them, ever aware that should they need assistance, she would be close enough to stop a tumble or lend a helping hand should they trip.
Draco's hand was curled in, cramp locking it tightly where he held it hard against his heaving chest, where he struggled for each shallow breath, fighting against whatever hid behind his flickering eyes.  Blood, wet and bright and shining.  It seeped between his fingers, dripping thickly down over his wrist and trickling to his lap where it was quickly swallowed in the dark of his robes.
He lived for Harry's visits.  For that kind smile that still seemed embarrassed, despite all he had already done for Draco.  Washed him, cleaned up his mess, fed him.  Seen him in all his shame, in all his stark agony.
'Just knowing I have it is enough.'  Draco told her.  'I want what's best for him, and I am not that.'
'Thank you.'  Harry said, once they were out of earshot.  'I couldn't think of anything to say to them.'
'Some things have always been worth fighting for.'  Harry answered.  They were so very close, a breath all that separated them.  'You are one of them.'
And another.  And another.  Each scar so faded, each one hard to find.  But Harry did.  He found each and every one that he had forced upon Draco's body that afternoon.
The boy had to endure.  Had to be cast aside, the one they had so easily forgotten, ignored, taunted.  Accused.
She helped him off with the pyjama top, buttons too small for Draco to manage alone.  Peeling it from his shivery skin, Pomfrey suppressed a shudder at the scars that covered his body.  They were healing, but...
'You see them, Draco?  You see them dance for you?'  A sibilant voice, worming its dirty way into his veins.  Sticking to his limbs, draging him down into the Hell that had been created for him.  His dead parents whirling around the Cell.  'Join them, Draco.'  Cold fingers touching his shackled ankles, creeping ever higher.  'Look at how they want you.'
'Stay out here?  Someone would come looking for you sooner or later.  From what I recall, you tend to be rather popular!'
Harry knew he could not be one of those students who slung on a coat and walked out of the castle for a week.  Knowing that Draco would be watching from the top most window, not waving goodbye, not even daring to acknowledge each other.  He couldn't do it.
'But Draco hiding from him in a solitary room in the castle will not help matters, it will make them worse.'
'Is it true?  Did you know?'  Theo turned to him, stunned to see quick tears pooling in his eyes.  'Tell me!'
'I should have guessed that it would be you, Potter.'  Filch sighed wearily.  'Who else would be wandering the halls at this late hour.'
Should the boy open his mouth and talk of his horrors, Nott knew that it would be his ending.  He had to think fast, had to convince his only hope, his son, that the Malfoy boy was a liar, a fool, a friend that had deceived them all.
'Nothing about this is your fault.'  Harry slowly raised his head.  'It's me.  I...I don't even know what I am doing anymore, Draco.  I...I'm scared.  I'm scared all the time.'
'You gave it back to me, Harry.'  His eyes open, desperate for Harry to see, to realise.  'You gave me back what they ripped from me in that place.  You gave me back my dignity.'  His hand groped for Harry's under the blankets, gripped it as tightly as he could.  'You think you can't do this, that you are not helping.  But you are.  You have to see that, you have to know.  I...I thought I could be alone, I thought I was strong.'
Soft, scared.  At first, anyway.  Becoming so much more than Harry had ever believed possible.  The way Draco had curled his hand in his hair, the way he had pulled back, just to check, just to see if it was all right.  It all settled in Harry's chest and became everything he never realised he had missed.
'I...  I do not know what it was that Draco saw.'  McGonagall told the teary eyed boy.  'I was not quick enough.'  Another thing to add to her ever growing list of regrets.  She could well picture what horrors had visited the corridor of Hogwarts.  She had tended Draco's body, she had heard his cries.  'But...  I can only imagine.'
Standing before him, Ron could see, finally see, that there was something about the way Malfoy held himself, a heavy, gilded book clutched to his chest, almost like a shield.  There was something missing from his grey eyes, some spark of defiance that had always been there before.  The skin on his face looked paper thin, transparent.  He had been crying, that much was evident.
Milly put her hand on his arm, her fingers wrapping around his wrist, offering what little comfort she was able.  'They would have hurt you too, Greg.'  Her voice subdued, her words quiet.  'You know that they would.'  She too would have walked away.
Those words, spilling from a face that twisted with cruelty.  Made to hurt, to stick in his stomach, his lungs.  Stealing his breath.  No.  It wasn't true.  It wasn't like that.  Nott had it all wrong.  He hadn't wanted to leave with them.  They had seized his hands, forced him.  He wasn't what Nott said.
'I can assure you, Mr. Potter, we are doing no such thing.'  Professor McGonagall's voice was stern, even as her hands shook.  'We are doing all we can for Draco.  I warned you that it would not be easy on him.'
'All this time...  The boy?  His...  His Boggart.  It...  It also spoke the truth?'  She too had been cruel, thinking, always thinking the very worst of him whenever he passed through into Gryffindor Tower.  He hadn't belonged, he was only pretending.  He was a nasty, spiteful child who had no place behind her beloved wall.  And all this time the child...  She swallowed heavily, deep shame carving a path across her worn features.
Harry's scream tore through the hallway, his wand erupting in an ear-splitting spell of fire and boiling anger that had the glass shattering in the windows above and streaming to the floor in deadly shards.
'All this.  For dragging you into my mess.'  Harry could hear the break in Draco's voice, the promise of tears.  'You should go.  Go back to your friends.  Be...be happy.'
The stone floor changed to grass under his feet.  Soft underfoot and damp, the night-time dew already soaking into the slippers he wore.  Harry's slippers.  Everything that touched him belonged to Harry.  He couldn't bear the thought of anything else.
His more intimate injuries would have to heal without their aid.  He could not take any more trauma.
This was not the dreams of dark cells and creeping fingers.  Not the silent murmurings of a madman cloaked in black.  The whip was gone, the man wielding it long dead.  All of them dead.  Aunt Bella, his parents and the dance they did.  There were no shadows, not here.
'Don't.'  He warned, his voice rough, filled with angry tears.  'You won't ever know what it's like to have to sit in the back of every single classroom, just so I can't feel all those wands behind me.  Of spending all my time terrified of magic, even though I'm in a castle full of nothing but, knowing that I have nowhere else to go.'  He slammed his hands on the desk, inches from the box.  'I was good, I had a future, a life.  Now I'm nothing.  I'm meant to be a wizard!'
He should have killed the boy.  Hindsight was a marvelous, absurd thing.  There was no going back, there would be no chance again to draw his wand and cast that terrible spell overflowing with green light and ghastly words.  No chance again to wrap his hands around that tender throat and squeeze the fragile life from the body that was dying anyway.
'No.'  Draco was quick to allay Harry's fears.  'Not once.  I can't explain it, Harry.  I don't understand it.  But this,' he dipped his eyes to the cloak, his hand buried within it's folds.  'It's so warm.  It feels like you.'
His grin sly and calculating, a pressed on mask that hid the scared little boy underneath it all.  Suppressing a growing sense of a tremble, fighting against the idea that everyone would see through his transparent charade.  Because how could he be anything more?
It would happen again, and as soon as he pushed them back onto his face, he was assaulted with clouded vision once more.
Lonely was climbing into his own bed, with all the comforts the day had brought.  A full belly, a warm place to sleep, the sound of people snoring.  He had everything he had ever wanted.
Of course Harry should follow Ron, it was the right thing to do.  Years of friendship could not be torn asunder because of some cross words, some hasty actions.  Harry would make it right.  He had too.  But...But it had hurt.
'That's enough!'  Harry was there, grabbing at Ron's shoulder with considerable force.  'Leave him alone.'
Harry bolted down his lunch.  Great swallows of bread and ham, washed down with orange juice.  He would eat, he would sleep, however difficult.  He would do it all for the blond boy who had cried when he had passed out.
'She will want answers I don't have.'  Theo shook his head, his voice scratching and sore.  Potter and his hands had done a firm job.  He coughed, swallowed.  The pain was no more than he deserved.  'I have to get them.'
And then there was the Dreamless Sleep potion.  It had never failed her before.  He should have slept without worry, without the torturous dreams.  It hadn't worked. She had to return, to get Draco inside the school.  But that meant the short journey had to be taken with a fully conscious Draco.  A boy who wasn't healing properly, who could hardly bear to be touched, who had to be carried.
The holiday was over, the students set to return later that day.  All would return to the normality that was slowly killing Harry.
'Yes, you might.  You did.'  He waited as Slughorn drew deeply from the little bottle.  'But you would not have known what they were capable of.'  He waved off Slughorn's offer of the bottle, the smell of the strong contents already making him nauseous.
Its pale skin had grown thin, its limbs weak, broken.  Patches of once blond hair spattering a bloody scalp, torn fingernails and a blooded back...
'It's all so fucking horrible, so difficult, confusing.  I...I want to make you better, and I can't.  All I do is mess everything up.'
That in itself was a lie, they had so many more steps to take that she had to wonder if it was asking too much of the tortured, broken child.
We both know it was time for me to go.  I stayed too long, and for that I will forever be sorry for all the pain I have caused you.
Harry clung to the memories, the good and the terrible, blind to all that surrounded him.  Blind to all but Draco.
'When will you see that this is not good for you, Harry.'  Draco's head fell upon Harry's waiting shoulder.  'You shouldn't be here with me all the time.'
'There...there's something wrong.'  Hagrid watched over the boy, saw how his eyes moved erratically under closed lids.  Noticed how Draco appeared to be trying to move his head.  'I think he's awake.'
He felt that surprising hand suddenly tighten in his hair.  It hurt, it tried to break the nightmares.
A cough tore through his body.  He couldn't catch his breath, couldn't move.  He was going to suffocate.  Terror gripped him.  Why wouldn't they let him die?  When would this pain be over?
'I...I should go.'  Harry found his voice, faint and full of an emotion he couldn't place.  'I'm sorry, Draco.  I really am so sorry.'  He could feel the tears welling in his eyes, the sight of the desperately sad boy in the enormous bed overwhelming.  He wanted to go over to him, to bury his fingers back into his filthy hair and try to offer a little comfort.
He noticed that the blond was quick to pull his hand from where it covered Slughorn's, his pale face suddenly flaming.  So, caught in the act.  Nott's stomach lurched at the display.
'There is no one left to listen to you, my dear boy.  Anyone who ever cared about you is dead.'  A whisper of His voice.  'And it is all your fault.  Look at them, Draco.'  A freshly healed jaw squeezed tightly between brutal hands, his head wrenched around, forced to watch.  'Look at how they dance for you.'
'I'm sorry you were woken up.'  Draco told her, his hand unconsciously running over the golden letters of the book resting on his lap.  'I was going to wait until the morning before...  before I was a bother to you.'
They had witnessed the heartbreaking moments Draco dreamed about, they had seen all the nightmares of his truth, and one of them, among the staring crowds, had brought the memories to his door.  To her door.
'I'm sorry for everything I have done to you, now and before.  Every horrible word, every nasty comment.  I was so cruel to you.'  Draco could feel his tears welling.  'I'm sorry for my Father, my Mother, my entire family.  They all hurt you, I hurt you.  I hurt everyone.  There is no good in me, there never has been.  All that you have done for me...  I'm sorry.'  He swallowed thickly, stopping the sobs that begged to be set free.
'I didn't.'  Harry admitted.  'I just wish I had been able to do it sooner.  So many people died, Draco.  So many people hurt by him.  Look at what he did to you.'
He could hide underneath his sleeves, bunched up and covered under his clothes.  No one would ever know, no one need ever see.  He could easily conceal whatever ruin he made of his arm.
Harry ran towards the deafening noise.  His wand clasped tightly, a spell already forming on his lips.
'Malfoy...'  said another, looking down at the boy, limp in the arms of the Hero.  'It's...  It can't be true.'
His eyes screwed up against that all pervading darkness.  Outside, his mind chanted.  Outside.  Not there, never there again.
There would be a place in the world for him.  There had to be.  A job, perhaps, someone who would take pity on a broken Death Eater and gift him with work.
Harry wordlessly sat upon the covers of his unmade bed, his legs drawn up, his head falling to his knees as Draco pulled the heavy drapes surrounding them closed.
The man creature, his tormentor and torturer, the snake.  All his eyes would ever see in the darkness.
Draco could see Harry from the window.  Watched his feet moving slowly over the shadowed grass.  Watched as he didn't turn his head, didn't look behind.  Didn't come back.
The feel of the thin body in his arms was too terrible to think about.  His fractured bones, the blood, the little whimper of pain.  It was too much.
For weeks he had been watching his childhood friend, waiting for the opportune moment.  When the halls were silent, empty, when there was no possibility of being caught.  It had tried all of his patience, not something he was especially gifted with at the best of times.  But this was important, this needed to be put to rights.
'Harry...'  Hermione spoke gently.  'I think you should both go.  I'll...I'll talk to him.'  She nodded sadly, her palm already on Ron's shoulder.
He waited, waited an eternity for Seamus to say those four little words that would change everything.
There were letters inside, beautiful letters full of flowing script and a poetic style that was all his mother.  Her handwriting flawless, much like the woman herself.  She loved him dearly, she told him so in each and every delivery.
Fang howled.  A deep, mournful wail that rent the night air.  It sent a shudder through the normally unflappable Gamekeeper.  There was nothing to be scared of in the Forest.  Not anymore. Hagrid knew this place like the back of his hand, it held no fear for him.  But...  That wail.
He would sneak back into his bed, only emerging when the others woke, pretending that he had indeed spent the night behind his curtains.  Leaving all of the other boys none the wiser to his night-time sojourn.
He grasped it tightly, the glass already biting into his palm.  But Draco didn't notice the slow drip of blood. Over and over he twisted the glass, holding it up to the little light.  How it shone in the room, the one that felt like his Cell.
She had been there, the day Dumbledore had laid the defenseless orphan baby on the doorstep of a family who would treat him with nothing but fear and contempt.  She remembered it only too clearly.  How she had stood aside and allowed it to happen with barely a word.
She had poured over enormous tomes, flicked through paper thin books, studied scribbled notes, and rifled through aging loose parchment.  And still came up with nothing.  If Albus...  She gave herself pause.  Thinking in that way was a dark path to take, but she had to admit, if Albus had still been alive he might surely know some way to help the boy.  She herself had nothing more to give.
It was a mistake, one in which he had to see through.  The stone cold and hard and always unforgiving under his useless, shuffling feet.  It would hurt to fall, he would surely break something.  Harry would be here soon, he would find him crying on the floor, his legs twisted under him, blood on his brow.  He couldn't let that happen.  Harry would be devastated.
Harry stared down at the glass that he had allowed to cut into his hand.  Imagined Draco, his Draco, pressing it deeply into his arm.  Unable to stop as the red of life flowed down his arm, pooling at his feet.  Cutting and cutting and cutting.  Until his arm was a ruin, until that blackest image was a blood soaked mess on the floor.
He pealed off his sodden clothes, dumped them in an untidy heap on the tiled floor and snatched up a towel.
'Malfoy went last night.  Alone.'  Ron told her in whispers, the sight of a desperately sad Malfoy never far from his mind.  'He appeared after you went to bed.  We had words and he walked out, just left.'
'You look exhausted.'  Harry breathed softly, once again reaching up, touching Draco's face with gentle fingers, the soft, crinkled skin around his eyes.  'You are not sleeping.'  It wasn't a question, but still Draco found himself shaking his head.
Getting to the door, reaching out his hand, Ron looked on as Malfoy tried for the handle, his grip slipping, like he had no strength in his too thin body.  Was he always so very thin?
'McGonagall told you I was returning back to lessons today, didn't she?'  Draco sighed, was there no end to the pain he was causing him?
But so very alone.  His legs twitched under the heavy covers, pain lancing up his back and through his limbs.
'Don't touch me.'  Harry warned, ducking away from his oldest friend when Hagrid went to put his huge arm around his shoulders.  He could feel the rage of his magic coursing through his body, threatening to erupt at any provocation.  'I'm not leaving.'
As he was forced to look upon his own father.  His flesh, his blood, his dear dad, watched as he appeared before his lonely friend.
'I'm sorry, Harry.  But something happened to Draco in that Cell.  We have scant information, we have to know.'  McGonagall told him.  'Draco, please.'  She urged the blond boy to continue.
'You can't make this right, you can't understand it.'  Harry shook his head.  'I told him what happened to you.'
With a speed that belied his size, Hagrid wrenched the door open and took off to the castle at a sprint, Fang close to his heels.
Draco nodded slightly.  Whatever Potter had brought, whatever that thing was, it appeared innocuous enough.  Harry lifted up a corner of Draco's covers, his hand shaking.  This was Malfoy, his brain reminded him.  They didn't do this, they were not like this.  He ignored the thought, sliding the bottle beside Draco's trembling legs.
'I may not know what I need, but I know what I want.'  Harry spoke softly, following Draco's gaze across the castle grounds.
'I...'  Draco choked, seeing for himself that so brief flash of compassion, of shared memories and childhood.  And just as soon as it had flickered across those hard features, it was gone.  Replaced with the raw anger he had first seen.
She would be there, studious as she ever was.  The hour of the night didn't make a difference when there were exams rapidly approaching.  She was the best, she was going to be so much, determined to achieve everything she set out to do.
Casual conversations over the holidays had raised eyebrows.  The mention of the Malfoy name had shocked.  Surprise and the truth had turned over in his already confused mind.  Everything he had been told fitted in with how Malfoy was behaving.  It all made sense.  Finally.  He had to confront him, had to let Malfoy know that his secret was a secret no longer.
'Apparently not.'  Draco couldn't wipe the grin from his face, tears of laughter still shining in his eyes.
His head dropped to Harry's shoulder, tear tracks damp across his cheeks.  Shutting his eyes, his hand fell to his lap where it was quickly gathered up by the dark haired boy, their fingers instinctively finding each other.
Crying would not solve anything.  But the sight of Draco in his bed, blankets wrapped around him, shielding him from the chill of the evening, the book that meant the world to him resting on his legs, pages open, his finger on the start of a chapter, was more than he could stand.
She fell into silence as she surveyed all who stood before her.  She looked upon Ronald Weasley and Hermione, knowing they had allowed Draco to walk away.  Longbottom, clearly taking a share of the blame for keeping silent.  The bowed heads of the Slytherin students, so many had seen familiar faces in the various guises of that damned Boggart.  Corrupted families and shameful secrets.  And there was Miss Bulstrode, clutching onto her classmate, Gregory.  Whispering into his ear.  Each of them too quick to cry.
It had been Harry. Neville watched him through one eye.  Harry wouldn't know, too preoccupied in being quiet.
As wands were drawn from hidden pockets in black robes by faceless figures.  Circling, closing in on the boy on his knees.  Faces obscured, hoods pulled tight.  Elegant fingers turning, promising Hexes and agony, and so many desperate things.
'Talk to me, Harry.  Please.'  She reached out, grasping his hand in its mindless destruction, and held it tightly.
'It's a long story.'  Harry shrugged.  'I'll tell it to you one day, if you'd like?'  Pleased when Draco nodded.  'She also gave me some old books.  They were a right state, my cousin had almost destroyed them.  Pages missing, scribbled all over, the covers torn off.  Anyway, she gave them to me.  I loved those books.'  Harry said wistfully.  'I couldn't get enough of them.  Read them all cover to cover so many times that they all but fell apart in my hands.  They...they became like my friends.'  Harry blushed, surprised at himself for telling Draco something he had never spoken about to anyone before.  'I didn't have any friends when I was little, but I had them.'  He reached out and picked up the book on the top of the pile.  'When I came home for the Christmas holidays in my third year, the books were gone.'
It was a sound that pulled at Harry's heart.  Soft, choking.  A scream from an already raw throat.  It couldn't be contained, couldn't be helped.  Draco cried, his hands once again reaching out for something, someone, who wasn't there.
'We spoke about this last night, and you agreed with me, Hermione.  You said it yourself, Harry has been struggling, and we haven't been there for him.  It's our fault he was manipulated by Malfoy.  And we are the ones who can help him see that, we can be better friends.  He can forget about that git, that utter bastard.'
'No, I...I'm going to go and see Hagrid today.'  He stared at the window ledge, at where their hands lay.  He wanted that hand to reach across the scant distance, just a brush of fingers.  It would be enough.  But he wouldn't ask.
McGonagall wanted to say that she was shocked by Harry's almost question.  But it only made her sad.
'Nothing will.'  He heaved a sigh, keeping still under her careful, painful touch.  He wouldn't tell her how it burned, she was sad enough.
'You should, you will.'  Draco shook his head, he couldn't open his eyes, too ashamed at his own failure.  'It's only right that you would want more.  It's not fair of me to say no.'
Stripping him naked, Harry took his time.  Reassuring touches, quiet words of comfort.  Stopping when Draco seized his arm, when he couldn't stand it.  Sitting back on his heels and waiting for the trembling to abate, holding his hand when Draco could do nothing but cry.
'Eh, yeah.  I...I had my wand.'  Harry plucked it from his back pocket.  'See, Lumos.'  The wand tip lit up.  'I wanted the peace.'  He whirled his wand around, lighting up the dark corners of the empty corridor as if to prove his reasoning.  'There is always someone about.'
'Draco stays here.'  Harry spoke, his tone resolute.  'If he goes into that place, he won't be coming out.  You know that.  They can't help him, not with this.'
'I'm clever.'  Hermione told him, not a note of conceit in her voice.  'But I have not been kind.  I have been blind, Draco.  I was so busy watching Harry that I forgot to see anyone else.  You don't have a wand, do you?'
Harry had been convinced that the boy was dying.  He had waited for it, watching for his chest to stop moving, waiting for the pallor of death to seep into his ashen face.  To sit beside him, to watch the life slip from his tortured body...  He could never shake those thoughts, would never be rid of those feelings of utter helplessness.
'Draco, no.  You should be in bed.  You'll catch cold.'  Harry's voice resisted, but his body didn't.  Sinking willingly into the comforting embrace, his own arms rising, holding on to the fragile boy before him.
'No hospital beds.'  Harry didn't allow her the chance to finish, cutting her off before she could make any more unwanted suggestions about Draco's life.  'No more secret rooms and curtains and silencing charms.  No more magic.'  His sigh was empty, exhausted.  'It's enough, he's not hiding anymore.  It's not fair.'
'No.  It won't.  it's...It's all too horrible.  Please, Draco.  Can't...can't we just go?  I...I can't do this anymore.'
'Greyback.  It was Greyback.'  Sobbed a child, his hand reaching out for a friend, anyone who could erase that lascivious grin.
Ron hadn't looked at him before.  Not really, not since he had come to live in Gryffindor Tower.  But locking his eyes on that pale figure, barefoot and shivering, Ron realised that there was something wrong with Malfoy.  Something really wrong.
The corridors were silent, the commotion had finally moved to the Great Hall, and Professor McGonagall knew she had to be the one to take the stand before the waiting eyes and the expectant faces, and deliver an explanation that would suffice.
Whispered nonsensical words into his ear that Draco's tortured mind could not hope to comprehend.  He rocked him back and forth, careful with his body, gentle when all others had only inflicted pain.
How was anyone to know that Draco would be sitting up in his tiny bed, blankets over his shivering legs, with a hot water bottle that was undoubtedly cold by now.  Holding it tightly in case some warmth happened to slip into his chilled fingers.
'Who are you, Harry?'  Ron spoke through the tears that clogged his throat.  His eyes were drawn to the wand that now lay dormant on the flagstones.  'I thought I knew you.  After all this time, I thought I had it all figured out.  But...but you keep secrets.  And I think you lie to me.'  He was quiet as he spoke.  The sadness in him overwhelming.  'We used to be such good friends, Harry.  When did it change?  Why did it have to change?'
'I don't think so.'  She replied thoughtfully, her finger marking her place within the book as she momentarily closed it.  She couldn't stop her mind straying back to Malfoy and the encounter from Potions that morning.  'I think Malfoy is going to leave him alone.'
She had now seen his hard won life and happiness torn away by him, the nasty little Death Eater who had brought nothing but death and destruction into Hogwarts.
Unseasonably warm for late September, teachers and students alike had decided to make the most of the early autumn sunshine and venture into Hogsmeade once again.  Harry had gone along this time, knowing full well that another excuse would result in uncomfortable questions that he had no answers to.
'You must.'  Harry bit.  'You think I could do that to you, that I pity you and am only trying to make myself feel better.  You think I'm going to walk out when you are well, don't you?  That I can just forget about all of this, all of what you have been through.  Just to give myself redemption.  Is that how you see me?'  He couldn't look at the boy on the bed.  Didn't realise that Draco was crying.  'I guess you would think that.'
The talk would be rife, whatever would McGonagall be telling them all now?  Standing on the stage, spilling words before them, the hungry students ready to devour the truth, even the lies.  Just as Nott had done, just as his own friends had wanted to believe.  Could she tell them everything?  Would she dare to say it all?
All he wanted to do was defy Draco's request, pull him up in his arms, take him away from all the glares, the shocked whispers.  Run away, escape this cruelty once and for all.  Draco didn't deserve this.
'It's not your fault, Harry knows that.'  Hagrid slowly, carefully took the destroyed biscuit from Draco's shaking hands, along with the mug that was threatening to spill into his lap.
He couldn't look as the Headmistress climbed those few steps to the lectern, as she surveyed them all with a flinty glare.  Silence rained down upon them all, and the weight of his own cruelty had him pull the book he still held tighter to his chest.
'It was me.'  Theo shook off Milly's hand, her startled squeak unheard.  'I brought the Boggart to Draco.'
They fell silent, food dropping to the table, listening as the clacking steps grew in sound.  Their first thought was an obvious one.  Argus Filch, and of course Mrs Norris.  One never far from the other.
'She wouldn't ask me.  He told her I tripped up, fell down the stairs.  I know he felt bad for what he had done.  He bought me new glasses.  I think she realised.'
'How was this allowed to happen?  How did we all fail him so very badly?'  The headmistress asked her friend.  'How did we not see?'
It was not for their ears.  It was for the boy who lay with Harry Potter, the boy tucked close to his body.  Warm, comfortable, safe.  Protected.
Harry reached out, his fingers finding Draco's listless hands lying on top of the thick blankets.  Fingertips ghosting over trembling skin, bruised, cut, aching.  Draco taking comfort from the gentle touch.
'It's all right.'  Harry gentled him, his tongue flicking out and tasting Draco's salty tears against his own mouth.  'It...it doesn't have to mean anything.'  It was too soon, too much.  He needed to stop this now.  Draco wasn't ready, he might never be ready.
He had heard the stories, the tale of his whereabouts for so many months.  There was something to be said about going around the castle quietly.  A person tends to be forgotten if silent enough.
He slipped the thin piece of card out from under his stack of pillows, careful with it, lest it should crease or be damaged by his shivering fingertips.
'Does your father know what you became, Malfoy?  Your perfect mother?  Is that why they have fled?  Too ashamed to know they have raised a traitor.  A whore who fucks his way through the teachers to get what he needs?  Who's next, Malfoy?  Who are you going to drop to your knees for after Slughorn?'
'Draco?'  Harry spoke, ignoring Neville's question.  'What's wrong?  Can you tell me?'  He stepped closer, that smell growing.  A perfume of sorts, Neville was right about that. Citrus.
He knew Harry would get up on the bed, just as he had before.  He would lie beside him and take his cold hand.  Stroke his fingers and whisper words of regret, of loss.  Speak of what they had, of what they could have been.
He couldn't hold on.  The shouts and the screams fading as he closed his eyes, as he couldn't stop himself sinking into the wide nothingness that waited patiently for him.
'You need to be sitting down.'  Harry told him firmly.  'You have been on your feet for far too long, you look about ready to collapse.'
'You brought m...me back.'  Draco stuttered, exhausted beyond measure.  He buried his face into Harry's shoulder as warmth flooded his cheeks at his own words.  He felt foolish and ashamed and so much like a teenager struck down with a love potion.  But that didn't seem to matter either, because Harry held him closer still, his hands sure and tight around him, the very heat of his body bleeding into him with a sweetness Draco had never forgotten.  'You...  You always b...bring me back.'
A woman and a bowl of water.  The drops escaping over the porcelain edges.  Soon the bowl would be empty.
A few moments of the sound of a scraping chair, a shuffling forward of heavy feet, then Hagrid was encircling him in strong arms that spoke of safety, protection.  Layers of coarse clothing that smelled of cold and winter, and the promise of spring.
They had come for him, of course they had.  The beautiful dream with the emerald eyes had been snatched away, leaving only white hot pain that blazed through his body, setting alight to his bones, searing his flesh.  He tried to talk, to beg, to pleed, but the only sound that forced it's way from his throat was a weak, pathetic cry, his eyes leaking the precious water the kind voice had given him.
'Who's there?'  A voice came out of the darkness, instantly stopping whatever Draco was about to say.  'I said, who's there?'  The voice boomed, growing ever closer to where they stood.
It only took a moment.  Harry unbearably gentle wih him, guiding him, leading him to the fireplace.  He helped him down to the floor again.  His hips twisting, his breath catching at the pain racing up his spine.  He swallowed it down, didn't let Harry see.
'Thank you.'  Draco told him, beyond touched at Harry's thoughtfulness.  'But I...  My eyes, I...I can't focus on words at the m...moment.'
'Yes, just like Harry's.'  She smiled, seeing for herself the pull the wand had over Draco.  'I believe this wand will be yours.'
Draco could only nod, if he spoke now he would surely tell him everything.  Staring into the flames, he covered Harry's hands with his own.
'H...Harry?'  His broken mind supplied.  It wasn't possible.  He had watched Harry open the wooden door, stepping out into the afternoon sunlight.  'You...you left.'
'Almost done.'  Madam Pomfrey spoke gently.  'You are doing really well.'  Her hand dipped to the base of his spine, rubbing more of the horrific potion deeply into an open lash wound. 'Let me put you under, Draco, please.'  Her voice thick with emotion.
'It's...It's Harry.'  Ron stuttered, coming to stand before her desk.  'He's...he's ruined everything.'
'Do what you like to me, Ron.  I don't care anymore.  Just leave Draco alone.' Harry sighed, spreading his arms wide, ready to accept any punishment Ron deemed fit.  He was so very tired by it all.  'He hasn't done anything to me, he hasn't got me under a spell.  It's us.  We...  Draco and I are friends.  More than that...  More than anything.'
There, that one among the many.  The one with the brittle glimmer in his eyes, his face hidden behind a mask, patterns of silver curlicues and burnished ebony.  A mask Greg had seen before.
New and neat books had been replaced with dusty ripped copies that had been scribbled on throughout their tired years.  Words erased by time, words that he struggled to read with his now fractured vision.
'Everything.'  Ron finished what Hermione could not, his hand resting lightly in her hair as she sobbed.  'It was everything.'  When McGonagall turned her face to look up at the young pair standing before her, she saw pain etched in his face. 'Was it true?'  He asked, clearly battling to keep his own voice in check.  'Was that how it was for him?  Malfoy?'
'You can't.  You need to get back.  I'm okay.'  He tried to push Harry away, tried to extract himself from Harry's embrace.  He was too weak.
'Stay with me.'  Harry begged, feeling Draco drifting further away, his body slumping, his words slurring.  'Don't go.  Not where I can't follow.'
'She thought Malfoy might have done something Unforgivable to you, mate.'  Ron grinned from behind his girlfriend, dropping cumbersome bags to the floor without a care.
'It is a wand.'  She spoke after an age had passed, her voice solemn, her own hands as still as stone on the desk.
'He's been gone months.'  Harry turned to look up at his friend, shocked.  'He went with Voldemort.'
Neville found him slumped against the open trunk, the letters still in his cold clenched fist.  Tears still falling to the floor.  The boy had cried a river, his chest heaving, his entire body trembling, struggling to breath.
Harry and his hand.  Warm, gentle and understanding.  It had hurt to pull away from all of that, to stand in the common room, surrounded, but so very alone.
'You scared me.'  Draco whispered, those beautiful eyes inches from his face, Harry couldn't help but stare into them.
'He doesn't!'  He snapped at her, this time gaining the attention of one of their number with his angry words.  Neville turned to the couple, watching, listening to their exchange.  'He wouldn't.'  Ron added slowly, oblivious to Neville and his growing curiosity.
His trousers dusty, his palm stinging sharply as he curled his fingers inwards.  Anything to hide the congealing blood on his hand.  He would have to find a bathroom, clean up the mess he had made.
There was no pretty way of putting it, no other way of describing what he had done to that monster of a man.
'I'll catch you up.'  He called out, waiting until they had all rounded the corner before turning to the headmistress, his face chalk white and drained.  'Has something happened?'  Instantly worried, his stomach in knots.  'Was it another nightmare?  I was with him this morning, I knew he wasn't feeling great, but I left anyway.'  Guilt his constant companion.
'It's not cloudy tonight.'  Harry whispered, his fingers tightening on Draco's waist.  'I thought you might like to see.'
He needed to get him into bed, needed to wash him, dry him.  Get him all the water he could ever want.  Needed to help him sleep and chase away all the bad dreams.  Read, or just lay quietly with him, touch him.  Anything.
He was quiet when he returned to the room, the overflowing mug in his hands.  Watching silently as Harry picked the thin boy from the floor with too much ease.  Not saying a word as Harry set Draco down on his bed, wrapping a blanket around his shoulders.
'Come here.'  A whisper, so gentle, so full of understanding.  'You look so tired, Harry.  You have helped me to sleep, let me return the favour.'  He pulled back the covers, his hand reaching out, the space beside him small and inviting.  'Please.  I need you tonight.'
'You cannot know that.'  Harry closed his eyes, too afraid to meet Draco's gaze.  Too afraid of what he saw reflected back at him.
Who was he without magic?  A child in the dark.  A nobody, a nothing.  Being a wizard was all he knew, had been all he ever wanted.  Magic, his parents, the Manor.  All were his life, and all were gone.
Harry drew him in, pressing his forhead against Draco's, his body so very close.  It didn't matter that Draco was naked, it didn't matter that they hated each other, that the only words they had ever uttered to each other before yesterday were filled with hostility.  All that mattered was Draco, his desperation, his pain, his tears.  The way he had reached out, asking for him.
Her body locked with fear, her blood chilled as it forced its way around her veins.  Drumming loudly in her aching heart.  She couldn't move.
A soft noise from the open doorway startled him, and for the briefest second, hope flared brightly in his tight chest.
Draco felt himself flush under Harry's gaze.  Whoever would have believed that Harry Potter would shed tears over the son of a Death Eater, the son of Lucius Malfoy?  A boy who also bore the same fateful mark on his forearm as his father.  It was unthinkable.
'I burned his tea.  He yelled, I shouted back, told him I hated living with them, that I wished he was dead and not my parents.  He had a bad day at work, I guess.'  Harry shrugged at the memory.  'Anyway, I was carrying on, we were alone.  I don't think he would have dared to do it if my aunt was home.  She hated me, but she wouldn't want that.  He lashed out, I pushed him too far.'
'Is that what you think?'  Harry was shocked, struggling to find his voice.  Rage boiling inside of him.  How could Draco think this?  How could he believe that he truly was so terrible?
She had seen this boy as a babe in Hagrid's safe arms.  She had watched helpless as he was left on the doorstep of a family that could find no love in their hearts for him.  She had looked on as Harry did everything that was asked of him, without question, without pause.
'It's you.'  Draco spoke, his voice catching.  'Of c...course I kept it.'  He swallowed heavily, his throat thick, his words dry.  So cold...  So thirsty...  That darkness...  Ever and ever closer, creeping and vile, and so very cold.
He was getting stronger, he could feel it in his bones.  That itching in his limbs, the will to move his frail body.  But what then?  What was to happen once he was upright, standing on his own two feet?  Where did he go after that?  He couldn't stay here, safe in his tiny little room.  Away from prying eyes, curious questions and inquisitive students.  How would he find the answers they would surely demand?  How could he ever tell anyone what had happened to his unwilling self.  The thoughts sickened him.
'I try not to be.'  Draco admitted, his hands shaking, his heart still pounding.  'I try every single night.'
It began as a secret.  Precious few were granted access to Lucius Malfoy's only child.  The whispers grew, until everyone who passed thought the home knew that there was a once pretty child being kept to vent frustrations upon.
He had looked on in growing horror and realisation as Harry's face fell, as his eyes screwed shut, as the hand that held his fork tightened, began to shake.  And it had instantly fallen into place.
Harry stopped, he had too.  Gasping for breath, his head hanging down, his chest heaving.  What a fool he was, running from the room like an army of Dementors chased at his heals.  He hadn't stopped running until the dead of night closed around him and he found himself out in the open, the stars cold company.
He watched in silent sadness as Harry snatched up the dressing gown that hung from the back of the door.  He had listened to him, he was going.  He was even taking back his gown.  Draco's stomach ached, his eyes prickled.  Harry needed to go, now, before the world came crashing down around him and he was once again reduced to a sobbing child.  He closed his eyes against the sight of Harry leaving him.
'There is something else, isn't there?  Hermione said it, she said there was something going on with you, and she's right.  Isn't she?'
'And where do you suggest he goes?'  Slughorn frowned, leaning back in the chair and appraising Harry.
Harry was on the floor, his head buried in hands that shook without control, weeping softly, so quietly that Draco felt his heart contract.  He was trying to stay silent, all so he couldn't be heard over the sound of running water.
'I...'  Nott wheezed, and Harry understood that the boy had stopped fighting him.  He had quietly accepted his fate.  'I...I'm s...sorry.'
But...  The idea of seeking sanctuary in Hagrid's hut was now unthinkable.  Draco had been there, once.  Dying in that bloody great bed.  His blood staining the sheets, and his own hands.  The smell of desperation, of terror, hanging in the air.  Harry knew he couldn't face those memories with the taste of Draco still on his lips, the feel of him pressed so close.
'You weren't.'  Harry shook his head, his fingers tightening.  'And even if you had been, you have more right than most to be angry sometimes, all the time in fact.'
'He can't do this.'  Harry spoke up.  'Don't ask him too.'  His attention turned to Draco, shivering, crying.  'You will have to figure out how to help him without all the questions.  It's not fair to put him through it.'
'No...'  Draco murmured.  'Can't...I'll do anything.'  His head thrashed against the pillows.  'I...I'm s...s...sorry.  Please.'  His eyes screwed shut in pain, Draco was trapped in his waking nightmare.
'I...I don't think you should.'  Draco whispered, doing his utmost to hold it all together.  It was for the best that he push him away now.  It would hurt less this way.  He couldn't allow himself to get close to Potter, it was already too risky.
Draco leaned against him, putting his aching arm on Harry's outstretched legs as Harry slipped his arm around Draco's back and urged him just that little bit closer.
Harry knew he had shattered that trust the second he drew his wand against someone he called friend.  Would Draco believe he could do it to him too?  If they argued?  If they didn't agree?  The thought of causing Draco that pain would be his end.
Even the slamming of the door didn't rouse Ron from his angry strides across the floor.  He didn't look, wasn't thinking about paying attention.  Only when there was a surprised yell from Harry, only when Draco Malfoy was on the floor at his feet did he realise what had happened.
'Ron...'  Harry stuttered, shocked.  Draco tight in his embrace.  He wasn't going to let the trembing boy go.  He could already feel Draco's tears against his skin.  'Look...I...'
McGonagall was weaving in amongst them, trying to bring some semblance of structure to the milling groups, Hagrid beside her and his booming laugh.  So it was him, the gently giant once again saving him from the torture.
'He was also raped, tortured.  Left for dead.'  Harry swallowed thickly.  'By Voldemort, by Death Eaters.  By former students of Slytherin.  Professor, can you promise me, hand on heart, that it was not the fathers, or the brothers, or the uncles of the students in Slytherin who did this to him?  Can you?'
'Are you boys ready for that last staircase?'  McGonagall asked gently, breaking down the barriers between him and the hope of dreams.
He would tell the clueless boy of Chocolate Frogs and magic jelly beans, and of Dumbledore, glinting up at him from within a cardboard frame.
'Father was crying.  I'd not seen him cry before.  I...I was scared.  I wanted to tell him that I was all right.  That I wasn't hurt.  But...but I couldn't lie to him.  He could see what they had done to m...me.'  A gasp, a hard breath.  'So ashamed.'
His eyes darkened at the hand touching his.  She didn't know his father at all, she surely hated him, as did most.  Why was she spilling all these lies?  He ripped his hand away roughly, watching her face as it took on a look of mild surprise.
'Harry...'  He began, realising instantly that there were no words to say to ease the ache Harry must be feeling.  Nothing to be said that could possible help.
The figure emerged fully from the cramped cupboard with an unsteady gait, looming over his cowering son with his lips curled back, a grimace of pain and suffering writ over his features. His eyes sunken into his dark skull, his once flawless skin worn thin with decay and rot.  A flap of foetid meat carving a gaping hole in his throat, his very flesh crawling with unspeakable horror.
'It's too cold to be hanging around out here.'  He took in the sight of Draco's thin jacket, claimed from lost property, a thin, threadbare scarf wrapped uselessly around his neck.  'Come in, the kettle is almost boiled, I'll make us a brew.  How does that sound?'  The giant gently touched his shoulder, smiling through that great fuzzy beard of his.
He wandered for hours, climbing up stairs and walking into unlocked classrooms, remembering the places of fun, the places of death.  He was done with crying.  A summer spent in mourning had dried up what tears he had left.  There was only so much sobbing a person could do before the tears stopped, before the heart started to slowly mend.
He was whispered to, carried carefully through the thick trees.  A voice full of sorrow told him that it was all going to be okay, that he was going to help him.
McGonagall holding court over the dining students, Madam Pomfery in her usual chair.  Potter at the table where he belonged.  The world was as it should be.
There was no doubt in his mind that the hands he stared down at, alien and unwelcoming and oddly belonging, would so very easily have squeezed the last dying breath from Nott's unresisting body.
'I will never be able to thank you enough for all that you have done for me.  You and Professor McGonagall have both gone out of your way to look after me.  More than I ever deserved, and I shall always be eternally grateful.'  He gave her hands a weak squeeze.
'How long are you going to stand there watching me?'  Draco's voice in the quiet room broke through Harry's contemplation.
And Harry.  He stayed right where he was.  Sitting on the bed, watching Draco breathing, his hand never stopping in the steady stroke of Draco's dirty hair.
Now school had become nothing more than hiding at the back of each and every class, waiting for the teacher to declare the lesson over.  Knowing that his mind would continue to fail him, knowing that the eyes of everyone around him held curiosity and thinly veiled contempt.
'I understand all of your worries.'  McGonagall sighed, sipping carefully at her cup.  'But Draco is resolute.  He is to leave his room tonight, and resume his schooling after Halloween.  My own fear is that should we not allow him his request, he will leave.'
Stripped of his expensive clothing, thrown into the basement celler that had always remained empty under his ownership, Nott had looked on as the boy was cast down those stone steps, locked into the darkness.  He hadn't bothered to pay much thought to him.
The thought left a bitter taste in his mouth, his empty stomach turning over at the idea that Draco might be able to see where he stood, and who he stood with.
'He will kill you.'  Draco murmured, his voice fading.  Voldemort's curse rattling through his weakened body.  'He wants you.  Don't...don't let Him find you with me.  He wants to kill you.  Run.  Please, Harry.  You...you can't help me.  Leave m...me here.  I...I won't tell.'
White hot fury consumed him as he stepped through the silence, forced himself between Draco...  His own Draco, and the living nightmare.
Two chairs sat pushed closely together, one heavy with soft covers, piled high with cushions.  The other void of any comfort, the bare slatted wood clearly waiting for Harry.
It includes thoughts and descriptions of suicide.  If any of this makes you uncomfortable, please do not read this chapter.  It does not affect the rest of the story should you wish to skip this part.
'I think I do, in part.  I've come to realise that there are worst things in the world than three scared, stupid people who felt they could manipulate and frighten a little kid.  I save my hatred for more deserving things now.'  Harry pulled back the sheets he had just straightened.  'I refuse to waste any more energy on them.'
'No.  Nothing's wrong.'  He shrugged.  'Just, don't be kind, not tonight.  I...I couldn't bear it.  Please, just go.'
Draco shook, he could hear the caretaker coming closer to where he sat, to where Harry stood before him.  This was madness.  Soon the whole school would know that he was back, back and damaged and beaten.  However well meaning Harry had been in throwing his dressing gown over him, Filch was certainly no fool, he would see him.  And that's when Draco looked down at himself.
It had been a simple case of pure luck and chance that he had been passing by the staff room yesterday evening.   And such good fortune that he had caught the conversation Professor Sprout and Filch were having, just in the doorway.  Whatever had been said before he happened across them was almost at an end, but still, it was worth paying attention to.  Stepping behind a corner, Nott had listened with growing interest.
'Draco.'  Harry couldn't make his feet move.  Could hardly breath at the sight.  Draco propped up in the bed.  His face deathy pale, his eyes red rimmed and damp with tears.  He looked shocked, stunned.  Lost.  'I...I'm so sorry.'
All it would take was a twist of the handle, a step to the side, and the full force of Malfoy's ultimate humiliation would be unleashed to the school.
'I found him like that.'  Neville told him, needlessly pointing.  Malfoy exactly where he had left him.  'What's happened, Harry?'
'I know.'  Harry whispered, his free hand going to Draco's waist, tugging him gently closer as Draco's tears spilled.
It raised an unexpected smile in him.  Perhaps one day, when he was able, he would take that path once again, the dust on his shoes, the tread of his feet.
'Many, many times.'  Harry smiled, working as quickly as he could.  'I had to do the housework when I lived with my aunt and uncle.'  He told Draco, tucking the sheets tightly under the mattress.  'I guess it came in handy after all.'
'Come along, Harry.  We'll see if the House Elves can spare us some ice cream.'  Hagrid was pleased by the task given him.  His sensitive soul could not take the sight, or the sound of the boy on his bed.
She would hold his hands, press her body close to him.  And kiss him so thoroughly that it would make him think things he had no right to about the sister of his best friend.  At the time, at least.  It had all gone so wrong after that.  Long before he should have put a stop to it, long before he broke her heart.
Of course, it was Saturday.  Harry realised suddenly.  Saturday.  And a much discussed trip into Hogsmeade.  They had talked about little else in the lead up to returning to school.  And now he couldn't go.  No, not couldn't, Harry thought.  Didn't want to.  He wanted, needed, to be elsewhere.  He would have to lie.  Again.
But, the sight of that pale body lit by fleeting glimpses from the waxing moon.  All shivery and dying on that cold ground.  He couldn't do it.  Why bother to throttle him now?  The animals would discover the easy prey soon enough.  There would be nothing left of him to resemble a body, let alone the missing son of Lucius Malfoy.  He wouldn't need to dirty his hands, wouldn't need to murder.
A circle robes, of drawn wands, shapes moving ever closer, closing in around him.  Practice and pleasure.  That's what this was.  What it always would be.
They could have left.  Weeks and weeks ago he could have gotten Draco away from this accursed place and all the hateful people contained within the walls.  He shouldn't have listened so easily, he shouldn't have let Draco convince him with gentle whispers and that kiss.
The ink pooled against Harry's shoes as he pressed through the silent crowds.  Pushing against the wall of shock, the stillness.  Shattered glass and empty paper under his feet.
'Okay, yes.  Water.'  Finally he could be of some use.  There was a mug by his own bed, he could use that.  Neville drew his wand, the spell already on his lips.  He was startled by Harry's panicked, raised voice.
'...  Besides the Potions room.'  The Fat Lady was still talking, her shrill words spilling from her distressed face.  'They say, they all say, they saw the Dark Lord.  Back from the dead.'  She paused for a breath as she tugged at her dress, pulling it out of shape.  'Oh, do tell us, Minerva.  Tell us.'  She was distraught, all the portraits watching this frantic exchange bore the same expression.  Owlish eyes in old and fair faces, unblinking as they hung on her every word, waiting for whatever the Headmistress might say.  Would she damn them all back to the hellish War?
'Of course.'  Harry called out.  Draco waited for Harry to pull his hand away, to put some distance between them.  He did neither.  Instead of tugging his hand from Draco's, he got up off the wooden chair and sat on the bed, drawing Draco's hand into his lap and cradling it gently.  Like it was the most natural thing in the world.
'You need a bed, a bath.  I'm going to have to give you a full examination.  To be able to care for you, you have to be inside the castle.'
'Potter.'  McGonagall's hand on his arm jerked him back to reality.  He had been so comfortable, they both had.  Draco leaning into him, his breathing steady, the terror abating.  'It's getting late, the evening meal will be starting shortly.'
'Draco...'  Again guilt clawed in his stomach.  He was the one who had put that pain in Draco's voice.  That sorrow.
'Not magic.  Use the tap in the bathroom.'  Harry instructed, his body edging closer to Draco.  'He cannot stand wands.'
He could lie down.  It was surely still cold enough for the darkness to claim him.  And it might not take long.  A day, perhaps two.  Not so long that he would be discovered before the end if he walked far enough.  It was a big, unforgiving place after all.  He might even stumble unknowingly upon where he had previously been left to die.  Quite fitting really.
Ron couldn't keep silent any longer, sobs in his throat breaking free at the sight of the person he loved above all others.  He needed her, more than he had ever realised.  He needed her strength, her security.  And her unfailing common sense.
'I...I found him.'  Hagrid stuttered, shutting the door tightly behind them.  'In the Forest.'  He pointed a meaty finger at his bed.  'Someone left him there.  Not a stitch on him.'  Hagrid swallowed thickly.  'I...I tried to warm him up, Harry.  I...I don't want to leave him on his own, but I have to get him help.'  Hagrid broke down, great sobs rattling from his throat.  'He's dyin', Harry.'
She and Harry had not worked out.  It was as simple as that.  It was the story they both told anyone who happened to ask.  They would always remain friends, but nothing more.  Neville had believed that.  Right up until Harry kept vanishing.
'You can.  You don't have to be afraid.'  Harry closed the book, set it aside.  'Is there anything I can do?  Any way I can help?'
Heads turned around in the ensuing commotion.  Conversations fell into silence, shocked gasps at the loud profanity.
'You cannot avoid your lesson forever, Potter.'  Professor McGonagall rounded the corner, her eyes falling on Harry in the bright glow of sunlight streaming through the window where he sat in the alcove.  'Soon there will be exams, and where will that leave you?'  She joined him on the stone seat.  'I'm assuming the problem is Mr Malfoy.'
Draco lurched to his feet, desperate to escape Nott and his nasty smile.  'Y...you have it w...wrong.'
'Open your eyes, Draco.  You don't need to be scared.  I'm not going anywhere without you.'  Harry's voice so very close, his breath warm against his skin.  'You need to look.'
'That's a good lad.'  The Professor nodded at him, already allowing himself to become distracted by the students who had begun to fill the classroom.  It was easier than confronting the truth of Draco's deception.
She had glanced from her desk when he had appeared hours ago, selecting books from the shelves quietly, not paying attention to the students who also watched his progress around the stuffed cases.  The Librarian noticed that they talked behind their hands as he passed them by, grinned and turning to their partners, their voices hushed.  And she watched as the boy ignored it all, not making eye contact, not acknowledging anyone else in the room.  He steadfastly selected whatever book he needed, piling them up in his skinny arms and taking the stack over to the far most table.  As far away from anyone as was possible.
'No!  You don't get get to explain, not now.  You had your chance.  You ditched my little sister.  You ditch the team.  You didn't come home for Christmas, I never see you anymore, and now you are defending that piece of shit!'  He pointed to Draco.
No.  Draco knew from the moment he had failed to raise his wand on the Astronomy Tower he had condemned them all to Hell.  It was his fault.  His parents had died because he was weak, because he had failed.
But the tables had been pushed to the edges of the hall, a small scattering of chairs.  There was music coming from somewhere undiscovered.  Several of the younger students had already picked an area to dance in, and were doing so with unbridled glee.  Seamus was making himself known among the year eights, a bottle of Firewhisky smuggled under his jumper.  Pouring liberal splashes into glasses whenever one was raised.
Dean was going to the Weasleys this Christmas.  Neville finally telling Harry in confidence that Dean was going to propose to Ginny over the festivities.  And Harry knew he had his excuse.  In part wanting to be with Molly, Arthur, George and all, but needing to be with Draco.  Not just for the blond boy's sake, not for the chasing away of nightmares, but for his own.
Draco eyed the water longingly, knowing that should he reach out and take it off her, he would surely drop it over the newly changed bed linens.
That wand.  That object of power that was his.  McGonagall and her words, telling him, asking him.  It was his, it would only ever be his.  Only...  Only he was too stupid, too weak to reach out, too pathetic to take what was rightfully his.  He could still feel it now.  Waiting.
'There is so very little else I can do for either of you, Harry.'  Her voice tailed away as she mounted the staircase, stealing herself to deal with the fractious door of Gryffindor Tower.
Hagrid would collect Harry from the castle, would walk him to the Hut with his enormous hand on his shoulder, trying to bring him comfort, to give him strength.  Hagrid would be the one to tell him what had happened, what he had found once more in the depths of the forest.
'Mr Malfoy is adamant that he wants to attempt to live a normal life as possible.  He is a wizard, Poppy.  It is our responsibility to help Draco with his future, whatever that may hold.  Should it turn out that he is no longer able to perform magic, or indeed own a wand, then it is up to us to guide him through what would undoubtedly be a very difficult, confusing transition.  But, as it stands, neither he, nor we, know what the case will be.  I will not force him.  Draco has time.  His life with Hogwarts does not have to end when eighth year is over.  He can stay.  Indefinitely if he so wishes.'  Her sigh spoke volumes.  'I could have seen it, Poppy, I should have seen it.'
The shared bedroom was filled with the sounds of soft snoring.  Thankfully the other boys were still asleep.  Harry knew that he would not have been able to deal with any questions that would surely be thrown at him if they knew he had not been in his bed.
Harry didn't try to stop the note of frustration from creeping into his voice.  Hadn't they had this conversation before?  When would Draco finally listen to all he said?  'Why not?  I'm not going anywhere, Draco.  You have to believe that I'm not going to walk away from this.'
'Harry, could I have a word about your Transfiguration essay?'  McGonagall stopped Harry as he followed his fellow classmates from her classroom.
Harry had his arm tight around Draco's middle, the white of his grip betraying his fear.  Sheer will alone propelling them achingly slowly across the empty corridors and up the insurmountable staircases.  Often she cursed under her breath as they reached yet another one of those steep stone hills, seeing the pause Draco had to take, the breath he had to gulp before taking that first heavy footstep.
'No.'  His voice clipped, biting back a harsh retort.  The wait was agonising.  'Just...  No, I don't want Harry here.  Just do it.'
'I...I don't have anywhere else to go.'  Draco finally spoke.  'I d...don't have a home.  There is no money.  There is no one.  I...I want to stay here.'
Casting her eyes up that final flight of steps, her gaze fell on the gilded portrait of the Fat Lady.  Another hurdle to cross before the boys could be led to safety and solitude.  'You stay there, and I shall go and get the door open.'  With a pat to Harry's shoulder, she hitched her skirts and put her foot on the bottom step.
'It's rather irresponsible of McGonagall, Harry.'  Hermione spoke up.  'She should be aware of your welfare.'
'Yes.  It will.'  Professor McGonagall nodded her agreement.  She took another sip, fixing Madam Pomfrey with her steady gaze.
Then he was gone, retreating back into the classroom like nothing had happened, leaving Draco gasping for breath, his knees weak, his skin pebbled with cold dread.
It blossomed, broke and crawled down towards his wrist, deep red slicking a path across his black inked skin.
How he wished he remained in the dark.  Those words that Harry had used, each and every one more terrible than the first, echoing around his head.  He knew he would never forget them.  Why did he ask?  Why had he pushed at Harry so, forcing him to tell everything.  After all this time, why shouldn't Harry do as he pleased?
'Where have you been these last few days Harry?'  Neville cocked his head at him, not allowing Harry the luxury of escape from his gaze.  'Because I know you have not been sleeping in your bed.  So where have you been?'
'I don't care.  That's no excuse for what he's put everyone through.  He's a Death Eater!'  Ron hissed.
Harry had to reach out, had to put his shaking hand against the wall to steady himself.  His knees weak at the sight.
It had been six days since Hagrid's terrible discovery.  Six days of fear, blind terror and a burgeoning friendship that Harry was struggling to contemplate.
Things would soon fall back into their rightful place.  Harry would return to his usual life, as of course he should.  And Draco, well, he reasoned that things would be very different from now.  He wouldn't return to Slytherin, Harry had been right about that.  He couldn't.
'It's not.  You can tell me that forever, but you can't make it true, Harry.  Look at me, look at what I have become.'
'I'll be with him all night, that is if he can stand the sight of me after I have told him that the one person he has trusted, the one person who can touch him without setting off a screaming nightmare has just betrayed him.  Draco trusted me with his secret.  Do you realise how important that was to him?  And I've just broken that trust.'
They lay facing each other, the charmed hot water bottle pressed between their bodies.  Harry's fear that Draco would indeed catch a chill had driven him from his knees, had helped Draco back into bed, and had seen him once again under the blankets of the little bed.
She knew she had caught his eye as he quickly turned away from her searching gaze.  He pretended to be most interested in the book that lay upside down on his legs.
Harry walked beside Hagrid and his unbearably light burden.  Draco was well covered, his naked pain concealed beneath numerous covers.  Should anyone stumble across the pair, they would be forgiven for thinking that Hagrid only carried rags.
'Where...where did you get it?'  His voice little more than a faint whisper, his throat still desperately sore.
'No.  No indeed.'  The Lady shook her head.  'I shall see that is done.'  Her tone grave, falling into respectful as she listened to the words the headmistress spoke.
'There isn't a normal anymore.'  The headmistress put a hand on Harry's trembling shoulder.  'What has been done to Draco is abhorrent, I cannot comprehend it, I do not think I want to.'  She shook her head sadly.  'There are no answers in any of this, Harry.  The War, the deaths, the destruction.  What has happened to Draco.  There are no words that will make it better.  We just have to keep on living, trying to make the best of it.'
'Why are you always so nice to me?'  Incredulous, Draco could never begin to comprehend all that had passed between them.
It had been the look in Harry's eyes that had hurt the most.  More than the shoving to the floor, and the drawing of his wand.  There had been a look of such pure hatred radiating from the dark haired boy of his family, that the blood in Ron's veins had froze, his heart skipping a sickening beat.  It was the new memory of that look that had Ron wiping at his eyes as he walked down the empty hallways.  The Library the focus of his direction.
He would never be able to right the wrong in letting the child live, his wish of freedom slipping through his fingers.
'Go, Harry.  You have to go.'  Draco pressed his hands forward until they came into contact with Harry's chest.  He pushed at him weakly.  'Don't...  Don't let anyone see you with me.'  He could now hear what had drawn Harry's sudden attention.  Feet, heading in their direction, coupled with near silent giggling.
Tucked underneath his tower of pillows, ready to pull it from it's safe place the moment a nightmare brushed its razor sharp edges against his drowsy mind.  Harry's modest face, his almost grin, his deep green eyes...
Draco.  He was never far from his thoughts.  He so wanted to return to him, defy Draco's wishes, his words, and go back to that little room.  Pick up a book from the table and begin to read, like he had never been sent away.
But it was more than that.  Snide, sneeky comments whenever Draco walked by, dark glares and muttered hatred.  Harry wanted to scream at them all.  How was it that they could not see the pain in Draco's eyes, that deep ache in his fragile body?  Why were they all so very cruel?
Potions, poisons, spells and curses.  Steps out of top towers and drops into deep water.  He had grown up surrounded by the darkness, the murmurs of others, of acts carried out willingly by the desperate.  He was never blind to the possibility.
More movement.  So many footsteps, so many whispers and hushed voices.  They were talking about him, always talking about him.  He heard the door open, someone leaving.  But it wasn't Harry.  Harry who lay with him, holding his hand, talking to him, bringing him back.
Only Malfoy had come back.  Pale and shaking and limping and so bloody quiet.  He wouldn't look at him, those grey eyes always staring at the floors.  He wouldn't look at anyone.
'I think he won't survive, my lord.'  A moments hesitation.  A fraction of a second where this was not okay.
When you cared for them, bathed away all the fear and the terror that the night can bring.  What use was magic in a world like that?
'I didn't think.'  Harry looked down at the treasured piece of wood in his hand, hating what it now meant for Draco.  He quickly shoved it back into his pocket.  They would have to do this the Muggle way.
Ron was shoving something at him, papery and glinting in the strained sunlight.  'Look, you have to look.'  He urged, desperate as he pressed the paper closer, forcing him to look.
'I already have that.'  Harry told him, kissing Draco's cheek, his gentle kisses trailing down the side of his face.  'There is nothing I want more than this.'
One did not come without the other, it didn't happen, it was beyond wrong, it was unthinkable.  But still, there he was, George.  Without Fred.  Still looking the same, still the spitting image of his dead brother.  Minutes should be separating them, not eternal sleep.
He studiously ignored the plate of sandwiches that had been left for his tea.  Each one a perfect little triangle of bread and cheese.  A scraping of best butter.  If he turned his head towards the window, he could pretend that they were not there at all.
'They were caught kissing.'  McGonagall told her with a deep sigh.  'By Mr Weasley and Miss Granger.  Draco could hardly tell me through weeping.  It turns out that this turn of events was not well met by the pair.  Leaving Harry devastated, and ending with Draco departing Gryffindor.'
'Watch where you're going, Wesley.'  He laughed at Ron's startled expression.  All in all, it was turning out to be a good morning for the Slytherin boy.
He saw his only hope of salvation gasp his last gasp.  Cold, hard, so very dead.  The lifeless body looking up at him from yet another cruel vision, from the wet ground, from the gaping bite in his unmoving throat, his lifeblood spilling onto the unforgiving floor.
It fell open in his own shaking hands, the noise and the shouts fading into nothingness as the pages parted, just where a bookmark held its place.  Only it wasn't just a simple bookmark of paper and stitching.
No, that wasn't strictly true.  The magic still coursed through his veins, fighting to be heard over the ceaseless pain, the fear, the uncertainty.  He pushed it away, couldn't think about his destiny, his terror.  His arm throbbing.  Remorseless against the soundless beat of his empty heart.
Hagrid was right, Malfoy was close to death.  Far too close.  His grey eyes flickered and twitched under almost scarlet eyelids.  Trapped in his own personal Hell.  Harry felt helpless, there was no way to offer comfort to the broken boy, no place to touch him where it wouldn't cause him untold pain.
Harry's sob tore its way from his body, refusing to be curtailed any longer.  He felt it rip from his throat, scratching and painful.  He could do nothing but follow it down into the darkness.
'There is something exquisitely pure in the suffering of the human form, don't you think?'  The monster had returned.  That cold body close to his, watching him, drawing a sharp fingernail across his sweating stomach.
'I'm sorry.'  Hargrid murmured, his own tears held back.  He tried to hold the boy gently, tried to lessen the pain.  But it was beyond his control.
'I didn't know if you liked chocolate.  You don't have to eat it.'  A flush stole across Harry's cheeks.  'I just thought...'  He slipped back into the safety of silence, watching as Draco picked up the box with the hand that wasn't still in Harry's lap.
And Harry.  Of course Harry.  Just the name running through his head raised a smile.  Harry bloody Potter.  Of all the people.  He would read to him, dry his tears, touch him when it was all just too much.  Sleep beside him, an arm wrapped closely when the nightmares threatened.  Chased them into the night, banished them with soft words, with gentle hands and sometimes, only sometimes, a soft, hardly felt, brush of lips against his trembling, tear stained face.
And others.  All the others who waited on her next words, knowing that they would be forever changed by what she was about to say.  So many wet eyes, so much guilt.
Had McGonagall been paying closer attention, had her steps not been so labored and her eyes cast to the floor, she might have caught sight of a boy, alone now.  Huddled tightly against a wall, waiting for his chance.  A striped scarf wound around his neck, a fidget in his feet.
He had been shocked that night in the locker room, Harry sobbing on him like his heart had broken.  In all the years, and through all the struggles, Neville had never seen Harry like this before.  He hugged him, told him he would listen.  And above all, he believed him when Harry said it wasn't Ginny.
Safety was tenuous in his early years.  His home had never truly been a place he was comfortable in.  He had never known when there would be a knock at the door, a Death Eater at the breakfast table.
'Don't you ever, ever say that word again.  Not about him.  Not ever.'  His voice low, dangerous.  'You want to know where he was?  Do you really want to do this?'  Harry pushing his face close, fury flashing in his emerald eyes.  A darkness consuming him.  'He was bleeding on the floor of a filthy dungeon after being tortured and gang raped and left for dead by Voldemort and his cohorts.  That's where he was, Neville.  That's where he has always been.'
The robe was once again tied at his throat.  Harry's warm fingers safe and gentle against his skin.  Just brushing the place where hands had once wrapped themselves around him, squeezing tightly.  But this, he could get used to a touch like this.
She had wiped away a fruitless tear as she set quill to paper and addressed a letter to that same baby, now a little boy who was kept in a cupboard.  Knowing full well that she would do nothing to alter his path.
'I don't fucking care about him!'  Ron seethed, his arms rising, falling with a resounding slap against his sides.
'When have I ever wanted easy?'  Harry pressed forehead to Draco's, his fingers on his face, his eyes.  His lips.  'I only want you.'
'But what do I tell McGonagall?'  Milly pleaded with him, even despite knowing that once he had an idea in his head, he would never be swayed.  The Boggart was testament to that.  'And what about Draco?  What do we do about him?'
'You okay?'  Harry spoke now, rubbing his back, kissing his hair.  'I'm sorry, I should never have kept us on the floor for so long.'
The boy was a mess.  The once proud, haughty student debased in such a vile manner.  Beaten, violated, abandoned and left to die alone in the Forbidden Forest.
That bloody Boggart.  It had conjured up Harry's deepest, darkest fear and exposed it before the world.
'Oh, Draco.'  But there he was, warmth pressing against his back, settling the throb in his head.  Shaking hands around his waist, gently tugging him ever closer.  'Lean back, I've got you.  I won't let you fall.'
'I guarantee you that this will help.'  She held out a glass of water.  'I have put a little Dreamless Sleep potion in here.  Can you drink it for me?'  Draco turned his head, wanting the water, but not the darkness of sleep.  So thirsty.  It wasn't fair.
It had been hot, hard, almost desperate.  His hands had grasped onto clothing and held on tightly, pulled that body as close as could be, afraid what this revelation had meant.  A kiss that had terrified as much as it had excited.  This was who he was, who he had always been.
The Fat Lady let him in without a word.  Even she had decided early on that the selfish boy from Slytherin had no place here.  What did it matter that he shook?  That his head was down, that his eyes were red and puffy?  Whatever had happened this night he had brought upon himself.  Horrible child.
'Great, thank you, sir.'  Draco answered him with a lie.  Doing his utmost to stifle a yawn and the tell tale shake of his hands.  'Ready for the week.'  Avoiding eye contact with his Head of House, Draco began to set out all he would need for the lesson ahead.
'I have no doubt that each and every one of you is aware of all that occurred today, within this very castle.'  Her eyes raked through the students and teachers alike.  'I would like to tell you all that what you saw, or indeed heard about through mindless tattle is untrue.  That it was a trick, a stupid prank, an imagination of the most terrible kind.'
'I know.'  Theo blinked, willing himself not to cry.  Again.  He didn't get to be the one to cry, he didn't get to ask for pity.  'I don't need reminding of what I did, Greg.'
He could turn his head, imagine green grass and starlit skies.  Cool air washing over his skin.  Not damp bricks, crawling with mold and smelling of rot.  He could close his eyes, they would allow him that, so caught up in the moment that they forgot this was torture for him.
Protection from what only turned out to be a small group of laughing first years, their uniforms crisp, brand new shoes clacking as they made their late way to the Great Hall.  It wasn't Nott and his accusations, it wasn't the shadows that stalked his dreams.  It was perfectly normal, happy students.  But still Draco clutched to the hands that were wrapped around his.
All along Draco had been living under the dark cloud of torture, of abandonment and death.  And Harry had been the one, the only one of them all, who had cared enough to help.  And he had destroyed it, destroyed Malfoy with his selfishness.
'I do.  And it doesn't.'  Draco laced their fingers together once again, bringing Harry's hand to his mouth.  'This,' he kissed him.  'And you.  That is the only thing that matters now.'
It was morning.  Finally the light broke into his room, touching the floor, washing over the walls.  Once again he had survived the long, lonely night.  And from his high window he saw people, students gathering on the path before the entrance.  Laughing, pushing and shoving with good humour.  Saturday.  His mind supplied.  It must be Saturday again.  And once again, a trip for them all into Hogsmeade.
'No, you are not dreaming.'  Harry's hand finally fell to Draco's head.  'If you were, I'm sure you wouldn't be dreaming of me.'  He stroked Draco's filthy, matted hair away from his sweat slicked forehead.
His eyelids were too heavy.  They flickered closed against his will.  The voice in his head pressing against his skull.  Wanting him to sleep, waiting for him to relinquish his hold on this new, beautiful reality that had been granted.
'Fucking Hell, Malfoy!  Watch where you are going!'  He stood over the boy who had clattered into him.  Looking, finally looking, at the person he had sworn to ignore.  Draco held his arm, white fingers digging painfully into the dark of his robes.  He looked shocked, shaken.  His lips parted but no sound came.
Draco studied the exhausted boy who sat beside him.  Right from the dark circles around his eyes, to the way he held himself, everything spoke of his unending tiredness.  There was a slight tremor in his hands, the book threatening to fall to the floor at any given moment.  He was clearly not sleeping, spending night after night sat here, reading aloud, granting Draco a peace he thought was long out of his reach.  Harry Potter.  It never failed to amaze him.
'No.'  Firm, but with his eyes shining too brightly, Draco implored her.  'He doesn't need to know.  I'm not going to be a burden on him.  Harry has to leave eventually.  I don't want him to think that he has to stay.  That I cannot cope without him.'
'I had money, I went out the very next day and replaced the lot.'  Harry grinned.  'All brand new, leather bindings.  I spent a fortune.'  He ran his hand over the immaculate cover.  'Never told anyone I had them.'
'It doesn't feel like it.'  Draco replied, he couldn't help the anger.  How could she ever truly understand?  She wasn't the one covered in memories.  She didn't have to look into a mirror and see the darkness looking back.
Draco took the drink from her and gave it a tentative sip, ever aware of the water he had drank in Hagrid's hut.  Surely she would not slip him something?
'As I'll ever be.'  He answered. And so, against his better judgment, Harry held out his strong, steady hands, ready for Draco to take.
Hagrid laid the dying boy on his bed, tears and fury clouding his vision.  Who would do such a thing to someone?  Who would want to hurt a living person in such a way?  Hagrid had seen some horrors in his time, things that he didn't think upon, but this...  This was something else.
His mother's words, along with her sad smile, had come back to haunt him more than once in his Cell.
It would all come out in the end, Hermione knew, just as she knew she would always offer her unfailing support down whatever path his life lead him.
