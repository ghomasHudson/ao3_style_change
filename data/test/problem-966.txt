He rejoins his team as they cluster on the edge of the Quidditch grounds looking to where their team Captain is locked in altercation with a group of people a little too far down the pitch for Harry to make out clearly.
“Like you can even talk after
“Oh, you
Now, lying in bed, trying to think like Hermione, he genuinely considers getting up and writing all his feelings down, logically like she suggested. He actually gets up, sits down, stares at a piece of paper, just imagines some of his thoughts actually looking at him with visible words and gets shaky at the thought. All of a sudden the oldest and most habitual idea seems like the best one – he drags the old invisibility cloak out of the bottom of his luggage and sets out on a midnight walk around the castle.

You freaked out, didn't you?” She sighs this finally, impatient and not ready to dance around it further. Also Draco's gold dragonscale effect trousers are glinting in the sunshine so brightly it's hurting her eyes. If they don't give her a headache this conversation will.
Yes, he was thinking about that and not the game when the Snitch was released. He was wondering why music, why glam rock –

moaning, thrashing and crying in the sheets like he's in the middle of a battle. She swoops down to the bed like an owl to a branch, takes his head in her lap and rocks, holding onto him as gently as she can without ever wishing to let go. This is it, the one thing that can make her cry, that twists her heart like a handkerchief until she feels like she could burst – when her boy wakes up, jerking and shivering and looks up at her with wild eyes and whispers -
“Suspect – oh my

“I won't know anything unless I try? I
“My goodness, is that Ron and Viktor down there? I suppose I should go catch them up since they've only got this far as it is. Goodbye!”
Potter grabs the back of his neck in his free hand and kisses him; it's angry, messy and brief – just to make a point Draco supposes – he could have done the same thing just as easily as punching him and it would likely have felt just as good.
“Well, I was thinking about it”. Harry widens his eyes as he looks back at Draco – it's a gentle expression, the eyebrow raise, but Draco has come to realise that it means the exact same thing. All of a sudden they're holding hands tightly across the carriage seat. They hold hands a lot these days; Harry thinks he might still be making up for the one time he did not take that hand when it was offered to him, and Draco hopes the same thing.
“Yeah alright, you don't have to look at it like that. I
For a curious little butterfly of a second both ladies flutter on the edge of a laugh.
“You -” he says, as though it's a miracke, breathing heavily as though he has just come from the battle itself and he has, reaching to cup Draco's face with fingers just starting to to feel the relief of it - “You. I almost lost you too.”
“Because he was really,
The carriage pulls up in the driveway and swings around to let them out in the direction of the house.
“Fanatical. Misguided. Completely and utterly -”
“Yeah.”
“I didn't want anyone else to die, I hoped -”
Harry looks at him sideways, suspecting that this is in fact Malfoy for being actually quite pleased to be invited and positively Looking Forward To It. The fact that Draco then stretches out across the sofa with his head in Harry's lap as he continues to grumble also confirms this theory.

“I'd make a good emo,” Draco murmurs, preoccupied.
“May I speak with you?” It feels awkward and she knows it just comes out snooty. Still, she knew this would not be easy. What is, these days.

“Yeah,” Harry tries to copy the tone, but his voice shakes betraying him.

“Failure,” she nods stiffly.

“No he has a point though,” Hermione nods thoughtfully from her own sofa; Draco notices that she and Ron are sharing it very fairly, his lip curls into a comforting smirk, knowing Potter is well pushed up into a corner against the arm rest - “No offense, Harry, but you
he says, though he has to explain that one – kisses him on the cheek, and bounces out of bed. No bed hair for her, she wakes up gleaming and groomed. Not like him who has to groan and struggle to remember how his limbs work – although to be honest it's been easier in the last couple of years, his senses sharped, his alertness less human itself.
He tosses his scarf with unnecessary flair and stalks off back to the band. Harry doesn't care. He doesn't want to talk to him anyway and he
that. He had learnt so much more than Occulmency over the holidays – how to keeptears to himself, how to disconnect, how to start escaping himself so that all of it was happening to somebody else, so he wouldn't have to see his mother's mask of indifference when all her husband's failures were taken out on her son.

“It's not me you need to apologise to Draco, it's Blaise, you know how he feels about -”
“You're such a spoilsport.”
“Shut the

Well to be honest, that doesn't feel too weird; the top floor of the Burrow was always his and Fred's, not to mention they were bloody good beaters, if they did say so themselves – he's good with being up high.

“Well but – we all get the same common room? I mean – what about Luna? She'll be going into year seven and honestly – I don't mean to get sentimental – shut up in advance, Malfoy – but I don't want to lose any of you – even for a term.” He does not say

Monsier Draco. Good day.”
you moron!”
The funny thing was, that if the music and the make up had started out as a mask, they seemed to have rather become a part of Draco that felt more himself than he was, and if there was still a part of him hiding behind them in fear of the people he used to be, well then – who wasn't hiding behind something, and what made a lie deplorable when it created a beautiful new whole? He wonders, turning away from the mirror, what Potter hides behind. He has always had the rather uncomfortable feeling that in a world full of fakers, Potter might be the only person just trying to be himself without external artifice. He sighs. Speaking of fakers he thinks he can hear Pansy's voice in their shared lounge area ouside the bedroom. He smiles at the sound, finishes the last touches of arsenic green and old gold in the corners of his lips, turns back his collar, fixes the green pin to it and goes out to meet her.

kind of practical answer; why did Malfoy have to be so bloody difficult? The answer:
Except they're not.
“Myself -” Draco's eyes – oh dear gods, George thinks, if Harry loves him, and he suspects that Hermione might be right on that – then all of a sudden he can see why. “I don't know where I went,” he adds, so quietly George has to lean forward to hear him - “Fifth year I was there, and when I came home -” he waves a hand, “Father was in Azkaban, and I – I don't know when I went away or where I went. I thought it was going to be okay, that it might be good – being chosen for something
It feels to George as though he is watching the world come back into colour all around him, life and light coming for the first time perhaps in forever to Number 12, like firework flowers blossoming across the night sky. Litle by little he watches them all, watches Luna steadily bring them all in on the job of brightening the place up which seems to have exploded into a full on mission. He smiles to see her in action – as though the intent is merely the decorating project itself and not the clean up of the whole lot of them that he can see going on behind her apparantly oblivious intent.
“That's all you can say?” but he swallows a laugh in his throat.

to decide he wanted to make a family with Sirius, moments – not many – to know that he trusted Remus. There had never been a time when he did not love and respect Dumbledore, almost as a parent, even after he realised everything the man had put him through. One by one they had all abandoned him, just like his parents, time and again he had berated himself for putting his trust in their love, swearing this time was the last. He had only ever been able to turn his heart off when it was never wholly there for the person in the first place; Cho, Ginny – he had shied sharply away from actually falling in love, terrified that his dependence upon anyone, his need for anyone could only ever be a curse on them.
Sacrilegious maybe, but these kisses feel more like worship than anything he has ever dared, and when he raises his head from Draco's neck, he can see those pale eyes glitter in the moonlight, and when he blinks fiercely there's silver sliding down his cheeks. He always dreamt of worship. of course he did; but his eyes are big and wide with surprise all the same. He hardly moves but seems to give himself to Harry with every touch, every kiss that maps him out, and the boy who lived never thought he could cry for joy, as if like so many things it was only ever a phrase, signifying nothing, but he's close now, thinking
“Do you know your aunt Andromeda?”
“I'll say what I want, Potter.”

of a laugh.
over and over, heart and chest and senses balling into a tight fist inside him and coiling up too low down for comfort. He registers surprise in Draco's eyes, shock, a sneer, apprehension, breathlessness. He registers his breathing grow heavy and his eyes darken and drop to Harry's lips at the same fraught moment as Harry's eyes drop to his lips in time to see him moisten them with the tip of a perfect tongue and he's on those lips in a flash, kissing Draco, claiming Draco, body surging forward, pushing him fast between him and the wall, clutching and reaching for him, trying to get skin, trying to touch everything he can, starved for this, desperate, kissing like kisses will save him, feverish and urgent, and one cool soft hand grips the back of his neck like a claw, all nails, and the other one pushes at his shoulder like it's fighting with itself as to pushing him off or pulling him closer but either way Draco whimpers and kisses him back, and the whimper undoes Harry completely. It's been a thousand years and he's not in fifth year any more, he wants more, so much than ever before. He's so hard already and he can feel Draco's cock against him too and when he touches the edge of his face he has to take a step back or come already for the soft perfection of that skin.
“Gosh -” Harry trickles the liquid onto his fingers - “You're so romantic.”
“Draco. Mate. The denial. It's getting
“Did I miss anything?”
For so long now he has felt helpless in the face of destiny and other people's expectations, their ideas of him, the things they thought he had to do, the people they said he had to be – everyone it seems but Draco – Draco just hated him for his own sake, because of the idiot he had been in refusing his hand, and there is such relief in that. If he feels helpless now it is a different kind of helplessness, one that realises how much it has placed in the hands of somebody else, in making one person so much to him. He kisses Draco's head, terrified and exhilarated by how much he wants.
A fucking
“Joy,” Harry wails. “Oh look darling here's where you tried to kill me, here's where my mad Auntie tortured your best friend, and just down here are the dungeons where -”
The Saviour wank over, do we think?”
Across the field, the guitars swing into volume, and it feels to Harry a little like being electrocuted – but in the most beautifully colourful way. The chords are gold; he can almost see it on the air and when the cello sparks to life the undercurrent of sound is amber amongst the gold, so bright at first he almost doesn't notice it's Draco playing.
He turns around.
“Yeah,” George feels his lips do that almost – smile again, like they have forgotten how but are trying all the same - “You too.”
“We all have to work out who we are sooner or later.”

The way he tells it has Pansy laughing her arse off – always a jarring unpleasant sound, even to those who know and love her, and yet it can be oddly infectious at the same time; even Blaise is smirking which for Blaise is a bloody belly laugh. The way he tells it lets him almost ignore some of the more awkward aspects of what he was feeling at the time – because there's no getting away now from the sight of a damn half naked Potter, with a flushed, slightly glowing post orgasm face – or the reaction in Draco that he thinks he may have stifled quite manfully. He suspects it's a sight he'll be thinking about later, without the hiliarity with which this retelling has been imbued.
to be melodramatic? On the other hand, he suspects this is so much more than a fleeting thing, that this bright, blanketing love will not die out with adulthood, that the odds against staying with one person forever are odds he could easily defy after battling and winning against so much else.

“Infant sacrifice?”
“Ain't sleepovers supposed to be fun?” Ron moans.
“What's so funny?” Draco turns, with an inscrutable face which Harry recognises as Not Annoyed Yet but Preparing to Be - “- and if it's another intolerable reflection upon the visual representation of inbreeding I will -”
“She will be.”
“I can help you there.”
“I'm back up,” Pansy bounces into a cross legged position in front of the sofa.
“Across the – corridor. Second door down.”
“Yeah shut up, you guys. Gin you're not the quietest either.”
It's all about healing, she thinks, at the core. All of them together in this house, hurting and tearing their feelings around the walls, each of them a breath of wind in a hurricane. And here she is in the centre of that storm trying to make sense of it by writing it all down. Trying to work out a logical plan of helping.
“Just trying to be friendly, Malfoy.”
“How could – oh.” Draco blinks at him. George almost wants to laugh, Malfoy's expression so clearly gives away that it has occurred to him for the first time that he's not the only one who came out of the war damaged - “Shit. Sorry.”
“There is one thing though – one thing I would really love to know.”
Narcissa inclines her head and hides an almost-smile.
“Well -” Harry shrugs - “

“Undetectable extension charm. The peacocks were raging about it too, of course, you can probably imagine, but at least they got to live. Only victory over him my father and I ever won.” Even knowing how ridiculous it is doesn't stop him from still feeling that flash of defiant pride.
and I – don't, you know - play for a regular team either. Except for you know – literally.”
“Do not. Or I won't.”
He is just having this thought when the door actually opens and a pale, pointed face pokes out. He's paler than usual, George thinks; in fact, he doesn't look well at all. Lack of sunshine, food, interaction, hope – he supposes all of that will definitely do it, yeah. But he's dressed, that's a first. He watches him from the corner of the room in which he can't be seen – as he goes into his mother's room, stays there for maybe twenty minutes, comes out and wanders – like a ghost, it seems so aimless and yet questing at the same time – into the sitting room, doesn't notice George in the corner arm chair and sits down on the edge of the sofa looking around him as though seeing everything for the first time. Shit, if he doesn't say something soon he'll start to look like a stalker.
“Please don't -”
“Besides -” he sighs - “I don't even know there'll

“She plays for the Harpies.”
He runs.
“A moment please,” she calls, getting out of bed and slipping a dressing gown on, one of her aunt's, heavy, black and thick with embroidery. She opens the door cautiously.
“Alright Harry, come on, what's the matter?”
Just before he can leave the door Hermione bounces up, whispering something to the others and catches him -
“Oh god Ron, it's not that I don't wanna think about you wanking mate, it's just that I really don't wanna think about you wanking.”
and tainted. He wants to break his way out of his own body, smashing everything around him on the way out.

Pansy makes another moan that this time sounds like -
“Elderflower cordial?”
“You are liar. And not very good one. I am thinking you should have been in Hufflepuff -”
“Don't speak to me like that.”
“Liar.”
Hermione closes the book, mutters a charm to make the writing invisible – should anyone find it in the desk she keeps locked in the library very few people go into – and puts it away. She sits still for a long time, practising stillness like she suspects Narcissa might, wondering if it will help her brain to be quiet.

He remembers this now in view of the seemingly impossible order to come out and face this bright and terrifying, new and brilliant emerging world, a world that has every reason to reject him. A world in which he may after all

He doesn't think about where he's going, too preoccupied in actually (shut up) doing what Blaise told him and trying to work himself out. It feels like he's been in a daze ever since Potter kissed him, like he'd imagined that happening so many times already it felt like it already had, but then at the same time it changed everything – didn't it? And what was that he'd bloody said?
“Oi!” Harry yells, skidding round a corner and seeing Draco head up a staircase - “Malfoy!”

“They saved

in a hushed whisper as though it was something too intimate almost to voice.
“Yes -” Draco shakes his head in despair at Harry's scattered thought processes, and now he can see faint smears of glitter and shine on his cheeks, in the corners of his eyes, silver shimmers out of his hair when he moves his head - “You didn't.”
That Monday he Portkeys into Hogwarts by arrangement with McGonagall, who it seems has never left. She nods at him as he wanders in and then goes back to manning a full team of construction workers. The place is eerie without students and half ruined; he never heard his footfalls on the floor before. He still has that feeling like every third footstep is going to send him falling through the floor, like a step that isn't there. When he rounds the corner before the grand staircase he stops still for a moment.
“Did I fucking stutter? Yes, you heard, you must have – you were gawping up at me from under the stage like you'd never heard music before. You like it. What we do.”
As the days go by not mentioning it becomes a habit, one which weighs on him more and more until the constant awareness that there is Something going unsaid between them starts to make him angry, to make him tetchy. With Draco. Which is utterly unfair of him and he knows it, though the knowledge does not lessen the issue in the slightest. Worse, Draco keeps getting tetchy back at him and it feels almost like falling back into the old days of verbal sparring and hell, maybe Draco doesn't want nay of this, any of

“Wow. Try saying that several times quickly.”
Harry splutters and shakes his head, unable to believe it's taken him this long to get it.
“Is Monsier Malfoy awake yet?”
Since this sounds like the end of the conversation Narcissa nods minutely and makes it to the door before Fleur, blowing on her nails, says loudly -
“That –
they make you weaker – hold you back. If you don't come with me I'm going without you – and for Merlin's sake put some fucking clothes on.”
“Really?” Andromeda's voice is less challenging than before - “I thought you two were always close.”
is a nightmare, this is just Holidays With Parents.”
This past fortnight ought to feel, like a dream, he thinks; instead it just feels like the only real time he has spent since fifth year. His heart wobbles at the idea – it's been sneaking up on him over the last few days with increasingly noisy steps – that he might actually be starting to feel happy. It's terrifying.
Why? he groans to himself, head in hands. Why is Malfoy
“I don't get why you're being so shirty. I only asked you what you wanted for dinner.”
“I – um – long story.”
“Narcissa -” she says this time, half a pause and then “- Malfoy.”
“I dunno – who's Boticelli? And it's more like
Draco's words feel like a wash of pure water through his core - “God yes. I never wanted to be different, you know. I never wanted praise for living, god anything but that, especially when so many have died. This
“It's not a good enough reason,” Narcissa says, knowing his explanation wihtout him having to say it. “You have to let go of the bigotry, Lucius, because if the remnants of those old prejudices are the only things holding you up then – then you deserve to fall.”
“Lucius Abraxas Malfoy, don't you dare!” She snaps the bag closed with an emphatic click - “Use that word again and I will jinx you into next week! You know that girl? The one we allowed to be treated so badly in our own house? The one you never stopped hassling Draco about because she beat him in class? Do you know how smart she is? How hard she works? That girl is holding herself together in a hurricane, trying to fix everybody else while they crash and scream around her, utterly oblivious to the help she needs herself. I used to know someone with that much poise and self possession. Maybe talk to
Draco reaches for it, turning around slowly on the ledge, suddenly terrified of the drop that seemed so inviting before. He finds himself off balance, and reaches his hand out instead -
“Well
It was no wonder he had held back from Draco so hard. Now, watching him – even now that he is
“What? How you always hated me? How it's all been too much too fast and you can't do this any more? Fuck you Potter, I don't want to hear it,” Draco almost screeches, finally yanking his arm away and looking ready to run off at any moment, although it is not lost on Harry that he doesn't.
I'm so touched.”
“Alright, Malfoy.”
“Ahhh -” Draco raises an acerbic eyebrow accusingly at the mattress - “What a truly marvellous compromise”.
The kid makes a squeaking sound, blushes and nods furiously. Draco smiles and snorts a little before signing the text book the kid thrusts at him before standing for a moment longer.
She stops suddenly, her face momentarily betraying how hard she has shocked herself. Lucius makes a choked sound of horror and objection, but stifles it under his wife's glare.
“Um,” Harry says, usefully, blushing and awkward.
at him – that he didn't really love her, that he thought more about someone he hated than he thought about her, and he said he supposed he did and – well it wasn't pretty, that's why she didn't join us.”
“Preposterous shenanigans -” Harry nods approvingly.
“Maybe,” Draco shrugs again - “If you want me to”.
he stops, not wanting Hermione to know what
“He's the worst of the lot,” Ron sighs affectionately.
me. All of you. The way you look, the way you make me feel, the way you make me laugh, the bitter, cutting, mean loveliness of you. I want it all, alright? I can't let you run away from this, it's too much, but if you want me to go I'll go, I'll never mention this again or a single thing more, so if you're going to – do it now. Tell me to go.”
“Saving the Wizarding World?”
“Ugh are you
The memory of that panic, that fear shoots through him like a sudden nightmare, a flashback onto horror and his own sigh turns into a suddenly screamed -
Later when he breaks away, turning over from her, sinking back into bed, she gets up, saying -
“Seriously?”
“Some kind of barney with one of the bands,” Taz nods, without turning to look at him but keeping her eyes strained to try and see what's going on. Anastasia Blake, best beater he's ever met, who accidentally concussed him with a wocky Bludger the first time they ever met and only just succeeds in hiding an enormous crush on Ginny Weasley that only Harry knows about.
“You need to get up,” she says, before he can ask her what she is doing - “Dress properly, shave, for all that's decent, wash and come out of your room for a day or two, keep an eye on the children while I'm gone.”
“Draco, do you -” he feels like an idiot, like a kid, he feels like a seventeen year old boy, foolish and stumbling, god it's awful – also possibly brilliant - “Do you love me?”
“Sounds like -”
He had had not had time really to come to any conclusions about what he
“Bless her. Of course she did.” They kiss again, falling back together like one thing that should have been occupying the same space, not like two separate things at all, moving back fluidly until Draco is pressed between Harry and the stone, just like he imagined and wanted.
and I mean – they've done nothing but fight for seven years – though it occurs to me now that might have been their way of flirting – oh dear.”
“I didn't
could be there in the room, in this cottage in the South Downs where nothing terrible or evil has ever happened. He looks surprised to find nothing there, but still stares at Harry with those wide open, scared and wondering eyes that do not understand
In the corridor she closes her eyes tight shut for a second and gathers her thoughts and everything else together with one long intake of breath. At least she knows her priority now, not that it comes as any huge surprise, but yesterday she was less sure. If she needed to look after Lucius, if she needed to get a grip on the family, if she should hurry them out of this place and away from these people. Now she realises that everything she has to do requires them to stay and thankfully they have leave to do exactly that.
“Oh, you're still here.”
“Fuck me.”
“Besides it's not entirely accurate is it?” Luna smiles benignly - “He mostly fucks you and we all know it.”
“Listening – yup, yes I am, here I am, listening to you, Ron -”
“Yeah right, like I could tell him that. I think you all forget how much I used to hate him. It's all just happened so fast, I'm only seventeen, Hermione, did you remember? Cause I'd sure as hell forgotten. It's too much – I can't -”
“Well – that one -” he points with a straight arm and can feel Draco's eyes following his finger. With his spare hand he idly strokes the ever arrogant tilt of that chin; almost like tickling a cat, he can practically feel the purr in Draco's throat - “That's the saucepan thing -”
you think there's anyone in this school doesn't have a reason to jump? You think
“Pfft,” Draco snorts, though his lips twitch in a stage – ready expression. “I'm not
Lucius moves his mouth a few times. He does not look well, Luna decides. He always used to look so nice, now his hair needs brushing and he clearly does not shave too frequently. In fact he looks rather pale and thin and his hands move a little worriedly in his lap. It's sad.
“God, you know what Malfoy? Shut up,” he grins and takes his lips in a kiss before Draco can say anything more. At some point he breaks away to look at at Harry with bright, glittering, feverish eyes and says -
he thinks it like a song in his chest –
until he finds the right place where they fit perfectly –
But he does go. He takes Ron, and somehow or other Draco. Draco used to be banned from the shop on principle and so, he says, sticking his nose in the air in his old way – it's about time, don't you think? The shop is dark when they arrive, and even the three of them casting
“Yeah you do, don't you?” Draco stops sniffing him and screws his nose up - “You go straight to that Potter, don't let me keep you. Now if you'll excuse me I have a sensation to create.”
“Why are you doing this?”
But he sits in his chair and he touches his face and looks at his hands fidgeting in his lap as though constantly trying to reassure himself he does exist, that he still lives, trying to work out who he could possibly be now. The door opens and he jumps. Twice in one morning is too much.
“Here -” Harry thrusts the wand into his hand - “Just take it.”
“Fuck off. You don't know
she thinks and she tries to muster up some feeling about it, but there is very little to be had.
“I swear -” Hermione starts, but gives up. “Look. Anyway. Sex jokes and pyjamas aside are you coming to these fireworks or not? You are, that's the end of it. Harry -” she adds magnanimously -
-” he says it apologetically, just like he has always felt apologetic for being
Gentle does not last too long; he's too hungry, too desperate, he has to lean in, cover Draco's back with his body so as to stop himself scoring red finger trails through the skin, turning his head with his fingers round Draco's neck, feeling the life in his throat and kissing him hard for a minute, both of them swallowing the moans that drop from the other's lips. He might die if looks in those eyes again, trails kisses down the jawline, obsessed with the nape of Draco's neck, whispering in his ear as he thrusts into him -
Can you please do something for me and have a good long think about the two of you while I'm gone?”

“Why? Up to something we shouldn't have been, were we?”
Anyway, he doesn't get to sleep with the window open; Draco prefers it closed and he'll grumble if it's otherwise, and, as more or less per usual he gets his own way, just like he got his own way about the light they leave on in the hall all night because he
a little surprised to see Pansy in tentative conversation with Hermione while Luna teaches Viktor some sort of clapping game, Viktor watching and listening intently to try and understand it. Ron says something to him he doesn't hear over the din of chatter.
“Did I miss anything?”
“Yes – ”
“Going well?”
“That's it - “Pansy mutters - “I'm getting out of here. See you on the flipside. Gosh, it's been fun – bye now -”
part of her screaming with which she had shocked even herself, before slamming the door to her room and leaving him out in the hallway. Well, it had been worth it to hear Draco laugh anyway, even if she had heard him crying later in the room next to hers as she tried to sleep.
“How long have you

knows what it was.
“Yeah well,” George shrugs and adds the greatest compliment Harry thinks he could have had from anyone - “Fred would have said so too. C'mon you wankers, you can buy me a fire whiskey!”
There's a painful pause in which Draco's heart feels like it freezes over -
“I do not -”
Like he was one of his own family (actually they are a little related, he followed it on the tree in the tapestry just the other night as he had finished stitching Sirius and Andromeda back into the fabric) – he cannot remember a time before he heard this idiot talked about; he twists a little in bed to look and smile, this idiot who feels so ridiculously like home to him now. He remembers with a faint internal snort how he had decided when he was about five that Harry Potter was going to be his very best friend when they went to school together. He remembers his excitement at learning they would be in the same year. In his six year old head, they had been sorted into Slytherin together, been the best of friends all the way through school. He had imagined them on the same Quidditch team, sharing a cauldron at Potions, sharing a dorm room, making mischief, having fun. He had imagined it so hard it had almost happened already by the time school even started.
just imagining Draco's face if she tried, it makes him simultaneously want to laugh and die. Thankfully, she does not.
Finding himself here, landing just inside, sliding in at an angle so as not to startle Draco into falling; as it is, he starts as Harry flies by, and wobbles on the edge, a look of fear in his eyes that actually gives Harry hope. He finds himself not nearly as surprised as the others would be to find himself here, supposes he should have seen this coming since the start of term mere days ago. What does he say that doesn't sound idiotic or overdramatic? Or is not this a scenario that might be excused a touch of melodrama?
“Yes.”
“Don't,” he says - “Don't do it.”
“Oh, because obviously to know music is to know yours. I didn't even know you'd changed your name.”
He stomps off down the corridor at a walk so fast it is almost a run, looking around him for a room that nobody else is in but suddenly it seems as though there are people
“I think I always have. It was- I mean, I tried not to and I did hate you, I suppose I still do but – well – it was always you, wasn't it? It was always going to be you. You're the only one who makes me feel – like me – just me. Not a saviour. Not the chosen one. Just Harry stupid Potter and I want that. I want
he hears it again in a little hiss of evil breath, hears it even though he's hard and shivering with pleasure as Harry's cock rubs against his, as he reaches between Draco's legs with gentle, somehow sticky fingers to make him ready for it; his head is latched onto the pain of the memory even though his body sobs out in delight. He's so stupid, why is his head doing this, going to these places rather than letting him stay where it is, where everything is good, delicious and the slide of cock going into him half undoes him already with an intensity of ecstasy and he's -
“Oh pfft. I saved the saviour, didn't I?”
Draco extends a limp wrist for Pansy to help haul him to his feet.
“Bands?”
“You remember he threw me his wand in the final battle? He broke away from the others just to help me – besides isn' it enough?” he silently begs her not to probe further because he knows there is something else, he just could not quite say what it was.
“No! The other Harry Potter!”
fighting back. Besides it was a big thing for the peacocks, wasn't it? You saved them. That's twelve lives still lived because of you. It's not nothing.”
“Are you guys coming or not?” Ron calls from the door.
And here he is now, a relic in a world that does not want him and in which he cannot see a place for himself. He is ready enough to change his ideas, his viewpoints if need be, because in truth he never had any beyond what was instilled into him, what he felt he needed for maximum survival and success. Cissy has told him time and again since they came here how urgently they need to change to fit this new world, but she still has not told him how. She had said, in her sadder moments, so many times, how they have failed the children, what they owe to this generation if they even
“I swear -” Hermione starts, but gives up. “Look. Anyway. Sex jokes and pyjamas aside are you coming to these fireworks or not? You are, that's the end of it. Harry -” she adds magnanimously -
Everyone blinks for so long in surprised pleasure to hear George spontaneously speak so cheerfully about
Harry can see thunderclouds brewing in Draco's eyes and where that once provoked him into an urge to chase down the storm it now kicks into his chest with an
still have a place. But haven't the Malfoys always made a place for themselves whatever the world? If that place means doing good rather than harm he'll do it now, even if it's hard, and it will be. For them. He takes a deep breath, takes hold of that memory, gripping onto those two things, the only important things in the world – not him, it's never been about him, he can take that now, only they matter –
How do you know? Has he come downstairs already? Is he – how is he? I mean, shit Luna I don't

“Y'know -”
“I mean – I love you more than I might happily admit -” Draco babbles - “That is to say -” Harry finds himself laughing, his own laugh, without immediately recognising it, it's been too long -
“I'm not.”
She groans. She's almost certain fixing Harry and Draco are essentially one issue. But what can she do? She can't throw them in a room together and hope they'll just sort it out because she's fairly scertain that they
“Yeah – I really don't like that word?”
there is a crashing sound like lightning and the room plunges into darkness. He hears Pansy whisper
Draco repeats viciously, lip curling savagely - “If I don't have a good memory of this place I'll never be able to come back here again –
it has all finally seemed. He has to face the sheer terror of it and honestly, it breaks him into night sweats for thinking about it, frightens him worse than facing down Voldemort.
“You – weren't?”
They wander off to the benches hand in hand.
– but he is here, and this is now, and they are elsewhere and this feels wonderful, just rough enough not to break him with tenderness, and he can see Harry's eyes dark and fixated and wanting him, his hands on Draco's skin, shaking just a little for the desperation of needing him, for the sweetness of having him and he wants to be able to talk and say
looked like he might – would that have been a good thing? Would he even know what to do? Why was Malfoy so mad about him having helped them already anyway? Why did he care so much? God he was getting obsessed with a spiral of questioning, it was like sixth year all over again, only with more helplessness and stuck in a cupboard with a stupid bastard erection and sense of regret.
“So that's normal then?” Ron sounds relieved - “Thinking about a person, like bits of a person when you're – y'know – having one off the wrist -”

Draco ignores her and pretends to be asleep. She sighs and goes out quietly.
it's been so long – that nobody knows what to say except -
“It was fair -” he waves it away airily - “Hardly comparable. We were kids. It was – god, it was a million years ago.”
“Me. Any of us. I understand.”
“None taken dearie.” She looks fondly at the boys as they join the group in the square by the lion statues; she pauses just on the verge of ruffling his hair, Harry pleading at her with his eyes not to,
“Flying?” Narcissa frowns, wondering why they expected to go by broom, then she remembers about the muggle flying machines. Gods but she feels like a child, foolish and ignorant. She remembers the day she caught sight of the Grangers in Diagon Alley and wonders if it felt the same for them then. “Oh,” she nods. “Yes, of course – have you – have you used a Portkey before?”
“That's – fair enough.”
“I mean -” Percy plays with his fingers, tearing at papers he isn't holding - “It was my fault, wasn't it? That he died. Fred. That's why I couldn't come home. Why I couldn't talk to any of you. I thought the best thing I could do was try and be of use here.”

she remembers – nods and stands up - “I'll be off then. Let me know what time you want me to tell 'em when you're done?”
“Never thought I'd hear you say that.”
“His name's Teddy, he's Remus and Tonks'. He can change his hair like she can but he has kind eyes like Remus. Do you know who else has kind eyes?”
How long has it
“Your – little – sister?” he looks almost comically appalled.
thought – seriously Pans get
They look at each other for a moment, and Harry feels his lips pull in a snort at the same time as he sees the wry smirk at the corner of Draco's mouth. He wants to kiss it, he always has. He wants to grab him right now and hold him so close he could never possibly get away. He wants to seize on to his scrap of starlight with everything he has and keep it close, keep him safe. He wants guarantees that everything will always be alright, that they will be forever, that nothing bad could possibly happen to either of them again. He wants too much and he knows it.
“Um. Me actually.” Well this is a first; Harry raises a curious eyebrow – for once, Draco actually sounds

something in return.
“She's joining us later for drinks.”
“You think it was
“Shut up and turn over.”
something whispers inside him, that's what it is,
There are nights when the past crowds in too close for sleep, nights when the worst times seem to lurk on the staircase, crowding outside the bedroom door. On these nights Draco sits awake for a long time, looking at the thin strip of stars beyond the window where the curtains don't quite meet in the middle. Sometimes their little house seems very small to him and this is fine, different is good on nights like this. He could get scared of wide spaces, echoing rooms, scared that the snake still slithers outside the door, scared that death eaters walk the corridors with god knows what intent – he can still see their eyes the way they looked at him sometimes, the way that made him want to run away and hide but there was nowhere to go not even in his own house. Nights spent fearing the flick of a wrist and a whispered word that could mean pain, every wand a weapon.
“Ughh,” Harry groans, looking at Luna properly for the first time and trying to smile. Well that's something at least. “All this time I used to think
for the perhaps the first time in his life, the relief of it feels so complete.
“I need coffee. I'm glad you're here, Luna and – yes -” he holds up a hand before she can say it - “I will go and talk to Draco. Right now. I can see you won't stop until I do.”
later - ” Pansy says - “Anyway I'm not saying I'm now singing old McGonagall's praises or anything, but she said well –
“Never. Don't you let them see you care.”
“No it was – when I said – after the battle – when I realised – I realised you'd been master of the Elder wand all along and – you never even thought of it, never even reached for that power – I realised that I -”
Harry rolls his eyes -
He stops rather than say it and add to the list of things he never had. Draco frowns, a memory floating up to him like a shadow flickering in a candle flame.
Hermione rolls her eyes -
Draco reaches for him with wretchedly needy arms, shockingly afraid of his backing off now - “Kiss me. Touch me – don't stop until you want me again -”
of – just so he could remind us how lucky we were – so we could be grateful and we were, weren't we? Grateful. Pathetic, just like you said.”
f frustration -
“The green one – you know – but the song was purple – it clashed, hurt my head.”
“Oh -” Malfoy smirks, Harry realises with horror that he's been staring at his lips, shining with clear gloss and glittering with tiny silver stars, even when after he pokes the tip of his stupid bastard tongue out to lick them a little, like a cat enjoying its prey. Harry's never been easy prey and if he's a mouse at all it's the mouse who picked the fight with this pampered, spoilt cat.
more insistent now - “Look at me.”
“Fuck -” he hisses - “Want you – I need -”
Standing at the foot of the staircase, looking upwards and away from him. His heart stops, stutters, lurches. Gods it was a mistake, a mistake this whole time! He should have known. His heart had kept telling him it wasn't real, after all. He should have listened, he -
“As opposed to what? Being put up on a stage so I can just stand there and have people behold my glory?”
“I would say something regarding our mutual loss but I'm afraid I don't feel it.”
“I know Pans, alright, I
“I mean haven't you
“Think about what?”
“I know. I knew it when I said it, I wasn't trying to – look that's why – with the apology, okay?”
If it had not sounded so heartfelt, so true, Harry suspects Draco would never have scrunched up his nose so hard.
“Hogwarts. You, me, Monday. I'll see you left of the great staircase? Okay? Okay.”
“NOW!” the others swinging round from all sides to form a circle around the Malfoys and Harry, wands drawn. When they apparate out, Draco clings so tightly to Harry's hand Harry thinks it will feel like splinching if he ever lets go.
“Twice. At least.”
about winning, for all they have spent six years striving for dominance – it never could lead to anything other than mutual loss or gain. Draco rips away -
He nods. A second later they are standing in a long corridor completely windowed down the right side with portraits down the left, enormous gilt edged monstrosities all of which look like Malfoys past. Harry is not sure he has ever felt so very judged-and-found-wanting than he feels by the arrogant, supercilious faces on that wall.
“Oh.” Draco rolls his eyes - “You're so thoughtful. Gosh, I wish I was
even to make him feel better. Her arm itches. He stares at her when she reaches a hand to it and she drops it - “I'm sorry about punching you.”
“Only a little,” the woman shrugs one shoulder. “On my grandmother's side. I am Fleur Delacourt-Weasley – Bill's wife?”
“I have heard so much about you, of course -” Viktor breaks off, aware of a rudeness and turns to Pansy - “And you are Miss Pansy of course, Luna's beloved? It is a pleasure to meet you,” he holds out a hand. Pansy squeaks and goes bright red. Draco cannot help but smirk; Pansy flustered is a sight none of them have ever seen before. After an excrutiating moment in which she forgets how handshakes happen she puts her hand in Viktor's – and it hangs there limply. He smiles and shakes for them both.
I'm the one who allowed every fucker else to show what they really thought of us, and I'm the fucking coward who's not facing
Since he was a child. It feels like he has never not known the name
Draco drops his arm instantly, he's so shocked, and blinks repeatedly in a way Harry cannot help but find ridiculously funny. He's quite proud of how it's turned out to be honest, though it took several healing charms when he got home to race through the scarring process.
“Harry!” now Hermione comes striding over, Ron and Krum flanking her like soft bodyguards - “Draco! Both of you – don't you realise Wonderful Wizarding Week starts in two days now?”
Then Draco starts to sing and a lonely electric guitar vibrates through the hall. Harry does not catch the words of the song but it's purple and silver and he never heard anything so haunting and sweet, so hopeful and lonely and reaching out all at once. He's crying when it comes to an end, because of the beauty and because it has finished. Apart from the tears he never stopped staring at Draco for a single second – the way he

“Oh,” Harry sighs afresh - “Oh boy,” he states flatly.
He's between Draco's legs when it happens, on the verge of pushing inside, and Draco must have seen it in his eyes because his own grow bright with panic and he shakes his head, quick and fierce as a shiver on the pillow.
“I'll meet you there after the show.”
he thinks,
“I beg your pardon? I mean you don't know me – you don't have a clue what I've -”
“What are you thinking?” Draco says, breath warm against his chest.

“Narcissa,” the lady says.

“Just glad y'all had to put up with it too,” Pansy sniffs then goes a little quiet as she catches Hermione's eye. They go quiet for a minute, awkward; Pansy actually catches herself scuffing the grass with the toe of her shoe.

“Harry, we've already been through this a hundred times this morning, then you went through it twenty times more with Ron and a couple with Viktor and we all told you the same thing.”
positively
“Come here and hug me then, you ridiculous cow,” he rolls his eyes, holding out his arms to Pansy without otherwise budging from the sofa. Pansy hugs him with every outer appearance of all the superficiality she offered Blaise, but she sneakily puts her head on his shoulder in a gesture of tender support that would have surprised anyone who wasn't Draco.
“Wait -” Draco frowns, pulls back a little - “Wait - I was the

“Is this the part where you tell me we could have been friends this whole time?” Draco sounds – he

like Harry has not seen in years and his heart does fireworks as he pulls him close again with a savage tug. He kisses him fiercely, furiously, hating that he does this, that this isn't the first time and won't be the last, hating that his heart, his body always drag him back here on an assumption of hate that would be so much easier if it were true. It's always been a battle when they kiss and it's always been the only fight he has ever enjoyed. He needs this like breathing, needs
“Fuck off, you dick.”
“Again? I don't think I stopped.”
“No!”
“Maybe.” Harry forces himself to shrug. “Maybe

“Yeah well,” she shrugs - “Blaise may have convinced me of the need for some
Finally Draco turns, kisses him on the cheek and tugs his scarf scornfully -
“Wow.”
“That's imaginitive. Don't worry, I'm sure she wouldn't.”
“S'pretty”.
“Potter they're ganging up on us, help.”
to get it out; it looks to Harry like the way he felt every time he had that urge to break things. He can't hear all the words but there's the phrase
Hermione smiles faintly through the tears that are not there but hide behind her eyes, Narcissa can see it in the way she blinks -
“Later Potter.” Malfoy gives him a cheery little finger wave and he could swear the way he says
“That’s enough. I think we can piece it together.” Hari smirked at the exhausted look on Draco’s face. Fred and George glanced at each other, then looked back at Draco.
Lucius led the young boy out of the cupboard, absolutely furious about his treatment, and even more so when the boy winced at a few movements. Hari had been severely malnourished, and most likely beaten. After taking another glance at Hari, he could tell immediately that this was no trick, no matter how much he wanted it to be. When he had been elected to go check on Mr. Potter, he expected nothing less than Hari being the spoiled boy his father was.
“You can tell us apart.” The twins said in unison. Hari blinked.
“At the luggage compartment-”
"Stay here," Harry whispered, "and be quiet. I'll be back." Harry crawled out of the bush. A smirk appeared on his cousin's face.
"Marco, I can't. He's right. I'm a freak. You need to go home, and I need to do my chores-"
"Tix!" Hari looked up and jumped back when the house elf appeared. Tix
“When did you even meet?” Ron interrupted, confused. Draco nodded. The twins grinned widely.
“Well, Ickle Malfoy, we have the required amount of people in the compartment.” Hari scrambled away from Draco, who shot him a murderous glare. Draco huffed and sat down next to Hari, his arms folded but his posture ramrod straight. Ron settled on the other side of Hari, and the twins plopped down on the other side of the compartment.
"I'm Fred," the one on the right said.
"No problem."
"Dear Mr. Hari Potter-"
"James-" Her sentence was cut off by the door closing and immediately locking. Lily  rushed towards the door, but once she heard those words she felt paralyzed. James couldn't be that stupid. Yet she had seen the telltale green light from under the door. Her heart raced as she rushed towards Hari, stopping in front of his cradle just in time to block him from shards of the wooden door. Voldemort entered and Lily screamed. She couldn't remember when she had started crying.
Harry sighed. This might be a long day.
"You're on!"
Harry crawled through the bushes of his Aunt Petunia's garden, his friend Marco right behind him. Marco pushed him forward on accident, eager to keep moving.
"As a governor of Hogwarts, it is my duty to visit the houses of students who have read but not yet replied to their letters. Where is Mr. Potter?" Harry shut the peephole quickly and laid down, barely registering the pain of his injuries hitting the hard and moth eaten mattress. He was going to be in so much trouble. Even though it wasn't technically his prank, when the m-word was involved everything was Harry's fault. He may be allowed to eat a little so he could do harder chores, but that seemed unlikely.
"Say goodbye Hari," he said. The woman's eyes widened. She tried to protest, but thanks to his silencing spell, she couldn't even squawk. His gaze softened and shifted to Hari when he felt a tug on his hand. Hari was looking down, but Lucius could still see a hint of pink on his cheeks.
So, Hari meets a few Weasels, but I won't tell you any more than that.
"Hello Mr. Lord Malfoy sir," Harry said politely, wincing at how weak and broken his voice sounded. "It wasn't a prank?" Mr. Malfoy's eyes narrowed.
“NOTHING.” The reply didn’t make any sense, and it startled a girl who had just opened the compartment. She jumped back from the door, and Draco blushed even brighter. The girl straightened her tie.
“I’m Hermione, and a boy named Neville has lost a toad. Have any of you seen it?” She had the same glint of ambition in her eye that Hari saw in Draco when he talked about being the top of the class. Hari liked her already.
Harry's thoughts were interrupted by a knock on the door. Aunt Petunia stopped the vacuum cleaner and rushed to get it. Harry watched from the small peephole he had in the cupboard door. She opened it, but gasped in horror. Harry adjusted himself so he could see the person at the door, wondering why his Aunt Petunia would be scared by a guest.
"Hari! We've got to get on the train!" Draco didn't seem nervous. He was just his usual impatient self. It was endearing in a way.
"Ah, Mr. Lupin. Thank you for coming quickly. Please, step inside." Remus did, and without hesitation. This was the matter of his little Hari. Though, not as little anymore, he supposed.
Hari hugged his Uncle Remus tightly. The transition was going to be very difficult, especially since he had just gotten used to a few nice people, and now he had to get used to an entire castle of people, many of whom would not be as sensitive. But he could always write to Remus, and Draco would be there too. Remus broke away.
“Ickle Ronnie!”
"No need for all that ma'am business, Mr. Lupin. I am much too young for that." Remus nodded, smiling nervously, hoping he looked more confident than he felt. He could see his failure in the change of Narcissa's gaze, but as it had softened rather than hardened, he guessed his awkwardness was almost helping him.
"Harry, I can't just leave-"
"I'm hiding from my cousin," Harry said nervously. The boy nodded. Most of the school knew Dudley, his gang, and his freaky little cousin.
"Stay here and protect Hari." He kissed Lily and turned towards the door.
"Stupid, stupid boy! H-A-R-R-Y! Why can't you just be normal like Dudley?!?"
"Thanks."
"Why are you here?"
"Not here," Petunia lied. She wasn't as afraid as she seemed, then. The man's voice hardened and his tone was much more stern, almost scary.
"Correct. Is my Father here? Actually, just come inside." He held the door open for Hari, his mind swimming with all the questions he couldn't bury in his memory. Hari hesitantly stepped inside. His eyes lit up in awe, and Draco couldn't help but smile through his confusion. "Your eyes are really pretty." Draco turned red as Hari whipped his gaze to him. Why did he have to say that? And worse, why did he have to say the word 'pretty' like that? Draco could list more men and boys that would take that as an insult rather than a compliment. Hari reached up to adjust his glasses.
"Yes, yes I did. They were amazing people." Remus forced his smile to be more enthusiastic. "You look almost exactly like your father."
"Oh my gosh Harry, we need to get you to a doctor!" Harry's arms shot out to prevent his friend from running for help.
Hari was mostly able to convince Draco that they did not need a train compartment with ten other people for the impatient boy to bounce between. However, Draco conceded only because he told Hari that there must be at least three other people in the compartment. Draco was kind of desperate for company, but Hari found it endearing, so he didn't even try to bargain.
"Hey, give it back Flint!" Hari and Draco locked eyes and nodded. They took their wands out and quietly approached the compartment. They both peered around the corner, and saw a young redheaded boy reaching for his wand, which was in the hand of a much older boy who had his back to them. 'Flint' twirled the wand in his hand, just out of reach.

“So when I get them off, I want the Order to be there to apparate all three of them back here before that can happen. What do you think?
“I know -” she says and she feels herself honestly to be being about as generous as she has ever been in doing this but she gives a great sigh and does it anyway - “I know because I am feeling it too.”
it's what he's thought about for far too long and – is it really true that it wasn't just him? He moans into the kiss, from loss and wasted time as well as need. He thinks about how long he's thought about this, all those guilty wanks and constant streams of thought, thinks about an obsession that he never could categorise as love or hate since he was tiny and first heard the words

“Nice,” he raises an eyebrow. “Homely. Very child friendly.”

“Few times,” Draco shrugged.

“Aww fuck Pans, they're coming, let's get out.”
“There it is.”
“Oh my fuck, is widdle Draco running away?”
“To be honest -” George has thought about it too; he is surprised to find out how much Malfoy's thoughts could align to his own - “they don't even want us to
he adds with a hint of spite, side-eyeing Harry who suddenly finds that entire escapade a whole lot less funny than it seemed at the time.
“Not -” Harry's brain starts to catch up, but not quickly enough. He feels like he's been assaulted – by the music, by the rush of sensation, by the cloud of feelings he's been swimming in – and hasn't he been swimming in them for years? Hasn't this been coming almost since he can think?

She stomps off and leaves him with the portrait he has been trying not to look at all this time. Fred comes to the front of the frame and peers out as though it's a camera lens.
“Quite officially not.”

“Welcoming” Harry deadpans - “Subtle, you know, really. Very understated.”
He almost yells.
“Yep. Try it. If people notice we're here, they'll go feral in the press.”
“God you're really not going to say it, are you? Even now.”

He really is, more than he can say, it's not the first time the frustration has threatened to overwhelm him and he kicks whatever unfortunate article of furniture comes to hand. Hermione simply regards him calmly and takes a sip of her tea.
“Hurt me.”
“Yes,” she echoes - “But we'd like to get back to her as soon as we can – I don't suppose there's a quicker way than flying?”
“I suppose at least three years ago?”
“Oh. Oh good. S'alright then.”

“Colours? What colours?”
Potter actually sounds sorry for it. “It's mad there. The press – they're camped out in the grounds – after the war – after you all weren't there – all the wards came down and just now there's so many people there we couldn't get them up again – we tried – after the Ministry took you. People are mad. It's not fair but they are. I don't think it would be -”
“Oh,” Draco heaves an overblown sigh - “
“Fuck off, Potter.”

“Yes. And you
Harry nods because he guessed that already. Because he has carried Draco through this one a hundred times. He knows that sometimes he is the one being eaten by the snake, sometimes Draco is being eaten himself, sometimes it's his mother or his father or anyone he has ever loved – sometimes it simply happens exactly as it happened – it is just their old Muggle Studies professor who Draco never even liked. And sometimes, that is part of the whole problem – he knows this because Draco feels the need to say her name every time it's her – as though he killed her himself. Once he told Harry that he had – or at least he might as well have, it all jumbles together in Draco's head until he's the worst person that ever lived and there was a time – they both know it, when Harry would have said that was true. A time when Harry was an idiot.
But – Harry?”

“Well I don't see as that's an insult since
“Yes? How can I help you?” The voice is Hermione's, too. She wonders if everyone who has known one generation of a family first must always make these comparisons – if the children look at her and see bits of Draco in her face and voice – she wonders which bits those are.
“S'true mate,” Ron nods darkly - “Didn't need that.”
“Draco, be nice. We talked about this.”
“Argh!” Hermione yells - “You two! Milennium! Fireworks! New year! Trafalgar Square! Idiots!”

“Really?”

This time at least, when Draco stops crying, he does not seem to need the usual reassurances, and perhaps that's something at least; besides, it's been three nights since the last nightmare which might actually be a record. Small steps, Harry thinks. He just lifts his face from Harry's top, grimaces apologetically, half guiltily -

means in this context. He sees Draco drift towards the window. He's so pale, he notices suddenly, suffering aside, he's just so pale anyway, like a moonbeam, a silvery shadow falling across the floorboards – he looks so small in this house, ghostly almost. Hard to imagine him living here, growing up here,
Narcissa had said,
Pansy deflates a little, but there's a gathering of courage in this surrender.
“Not everything.” Draco leans in to kiss him with a smile like pure sunshine and there is happiness in his eyes the likes of which Harry never hoped to see again.
“I used to see Voldemort in my dreams -” Harry waves it away - “I saw you through his eyes. I saw you not wanting to do any of those things. I know what he would have done to you if you didn't. What he
“Yes. When I am alone in a strange country and my people – that is you people – are not there – often I am listening to the instruments of Bulgaria and it is comfort, you know?”

The voice sounds distant, as though calling him from far away, another time and place, only it's this one, this time, this place, not the one he put himself back in, the terrible one.
He gets a shock hearing himself voice the thought, waking up one morning to light streaming in from the newly shining windows of what has become Their Room. The other day he even heard Luna refer to it as

The books didn't like me at first because I'm not – well, you know – and in return I'm -” she realises that now is not even faintly the time to say what she's trying – possibly unsuccesfully – to help Narcissa with in return. Luckily Draco does not really seem to care.
“No!”
Fred makes a plane crashing noise in George's head –

Which is why, when he gets up early that morning and slouches heavily into the kitchen, Hermione greets him with -
“- needed all the funny you can get yeah. Do me a favour Percy?”
Draco raises a shoulder in the gesture of one who's too cool to shrug.
“Not exactly my dear – I suspect that whatever it is will always be a lot more complicated than
“That's good, 'cause you're not gonna get it. Fuck, Malfoy - I'm hard as rock and I hate you, what do you think's going to happen?” He pushes him in the chest - his hands want to linger on his skin, but he wants him pushed back against the mattress. Draco shoves back but it's ineffectual.
“Thank you Minister,” she nods. Her fingers feel awkward working the -
“I'm stuff!” he shouts up to the rest of the team, before Harry gathers him into a kiss. He's sweaty and red in the face from flying and Draco's in lilac brocade and cream lace, and Merlin knows what they look like, but he loves them, he will never stop loving the

Nobody sees her take a deep visible breath in the corridor as she closes the door behind her, nobody sees her close her eyes and gather herself together, but she has to do it outwardly sometimes, just a little. Not as much as other people perhaps; she has been practising this game since she was five and learning how to survive the world. Nobody ever sees her betray an expression if she can help it, nobody could reach into her thoughts however hard they tried. She remembers feeling the Dark Lord probing in there like he probed them all, remembers hiding even her revulsion at the attempts at invasion. She remembers most of all feeling frustration –
“She asked me if Draco was still alive; she did it when I said yes – I think by that stage she just wanted to save him.”
“I don't get it. You'll hate muggles – I mean in the shit on them from a great height sense – why would you collect their art works?”
“Oh shut up Blaise, you incredible, bitch faced twat.”
“Alright? I don't know -” for the first time her face quivers; her chin wobbles, and she glances at Hermione who scrunches back a
“Wow,” Harry says, intelligently when he finally finds a word. It's nowhere near good enough but he supposes he has to try.
“I was thinking childhood trauma-ville, you slow dumb fuck, but you do you. Look, making friends with me is a) impossible, b) you won't like me and c) probably your main concern – won't get you into Draco's pants any quicker, and I swear to shit you
“I thought you'd be mad or – hate me or -”
“I, well -” he looks a little confused. He looks like someone looks when they have been cut in half in the moments before the dead pieces fall to the floor - “I was being nice.”
“Do you want – anything – drinks – um – or I can just show you to some rooms but I mean – you're free to – I mean it's your choice,” Harry babbles, wishing he could sink into the floor boards with every word.
“No,” she shakes her head, eyes darting to Hermione's arm and back. “Nobody deserves a permanent mark that does not define them,” she says - “Trust me. I know – and some words do not need to ever be said. I will be telling my son the same thing. His father does not rule this family anymore.”
he hears Pansy murmur, and he almost smiles but he's too entranced, caught like a butterfly in a net of rainbow and silver stars.
They head towards the Quidditch pitch, hands not exactly touching, but when their steps do brush their fingers together neither actively pulls away.”
“He was here,” Draco says, Harry coming to a halt beside him on the landing, looking down into the front vestibule. He can see Draco's hand, pale against the dark wood bannister, fingers very still and stiff - “When I arrived home that summer – on the
“Worse,” Draco rolls his eyes - “That's what I pay him for after all, and to be fair why he's a better band manager than you ever were, my dear.”
He hears himself whimper when Potter's hand slides up under his shirt, warm against his skin, a hand that moves on him so savagely he can imagine it digging through his skin, reaching between his ribs and yanking out his heart and he opens his mouth and is on the verge of whispering
But he cannot ask, and god knows if Potter would even have helped. Was there ever a time when he might have? It feels like there might have been, but it is a time now hidden behind the dreadful wall of this past term and that terrible cruel summer.
“So – what are you asking my advice on?”
“Do anything for 'em though wouldn't we? Our kids, you know how it is.”
“Yeah. Right. I'm real brave. Should have been a bloody Gryffindor. What next? You're going to give me the part about how my parents will miss me? Sing me another one -”
All he seems to want to do just now is sleep. Every time he wakes up there is immediately too much to get used to – so much his head spins and he feels exhausted before ever getting out of bed. He has to remind himself where he is, what he is doing here, how he came to be here and then
Draco echoes, half wistfully - “Are we? You know –
“The – children?”
“Bella told me – and these are close to her words- that she would gladly have sacrificed any children she ever had to the service of the Dark Lord. I do not think she approved that I was not ready to sacrifice even the one that I had.”
The exhalation of breath that comes out of Narcissa has to be the shakiest she has expressed in a very long time.
Draco – on the Astronomy Tower that night – I know what you tried to do, what you couldn't do – I know why you tried and I know that you couldn't have and if I had not loved you before I think I might have loved you then, when you were your

“You – suggested the sleepover?” Harry blinks blearily from his pile of cushions, squinting at her tentatively - “In fact I said, isn't nineteen too old, and Can I bring my boyfriend, and
“All sorts,” Harry says, relieved - “like a rainbow, only one colour after the other, not all together – when I first heard you – fuck that was only yesterday -” he pauses, trying to process this, wondering how they can have come so far in such a short space of time; but then again they've waited long enough. “You were golden – I never felt – or saw anything like it – and tonight – god, you were like -” he finds himself blinking back tears – at the memory of it, at his own inability to find words beautiful enough for how Draco sounds to him. “Sorry,” he hangs his head at his failure at a sudden excrutiating rush of his own inadequacy - “I'm an idiot, sorry,” he blinks back tears rapidly, unable to look up.
him again, amused but with very little time to spare for such bluster.
“Is he always like this?” Pansy raises an eyebrow as Blaise heads out, eyeing them both suspiciously like a parent who does not believe the child's promise to sleep for one moment.
“Um thanks? It's only taken any of you what? Two years?”
“Gonna live, Fred,” he whispers to the ashes and the rubble - “Gonna live, fuck it. Gonna re-open the shop with Ron, make mum and dad laugh again. Gonna make them all laugh again. I'm gonna finish Percy's sentences for him; god knows he needs some help- he's alright, is Percy. Gonna join in shit again, not just watch. Gonna take the mickey. Gonna give them shit. Heh, Gonna get it on with Johnson maybe, think about the future, make good memories again. It's time Freddie, it's bloody well time.”

look.
“-and of course it didn't occur to you that
“So what's the plan?” he says instead, propping his broom against a stone - “Why are we here?”
He supposes he has always known he would come back here eventually, dreading and expecting it and not ready for it, needing it and wanting it and afraid of it. But he remembers, with the shadow of the newly restored castle overhead – remembers how this and only this has ever felt like any kind of home. It does feel like coming home. He supposes he had hoped something else could feel that way, like the Burrow could, like a person could, like Ginny should have, but it didn't and she didn't and he can kind of understand why Hermione came back to finish her studies, why Neville started working here as soon as he could, so as to never have to leave. He wonders why he left himself. There is comfort in this place; in its walls and its earliest memories, comfort in gripping a broom in his hand again now and Hagrid waving at him from the hut down the slope as though he was on his way to his first try-outs on the pitch.
“I – don't know what you mean.”
“Better than playing dress up.”
stupid and all I ever do is hate you, yes hate, that's it, absolutely -”” Hermione is surprised to hear herself playing along with Pansy's dubbing of the conversation. Pansy hides her own surprise with a snort before she continues.
“Hell no – you were a dick. Besides being enemies was so much more fun, wasn't it? But we weren't enemies like that – you never wanted to use me or control me, you just wanted to piss me off and call me stupid shit – and you never cared about all that
“I didn't even think of it.” Harry shakes his head.
Hermione apparates out and Harry flops onto his back in the sofa and thinks –
trying not to be a dick quite so much, whereas if Lucius is being less offensive it is not necessarily by choice.
Ron makes a fisted gesture that makes Harry wish with all his heart he had just said
“What's not fair?”
are you sat on the storage room floor?”
“You're -” he pauses because there is so much he could say that would all be true
later. On the other hand, adult now or not, both of them would still more or less always say that the other one started it.
“You know what? I
Draco likes heights; it's like being on stage, being high up, there's a sort of power in it, the only sort of power he has ever felt much of a need to seek it. Maybe because there's so much freedom in it, sicne he has associated height from such a young age with flying. There is always something of that feeling of flying in it, he thinks; close to the ledge with the wind in his face. He should have gone into Quidditch, like Potter.
live up to it;
Morbid, yeah. He thinks it started with accepting his readiness to die and never really left him. So many times over the years he has wondered if he really did rejoin the living after all. He remembers Ginny in exasperation sighing this truth at him in one of their final rows. She was ready to move on, she said, why couldn't he be too? It was a gap in their connection he could never have breached, a gap which of itself had heralded a severance of that connection. He couldn't move on, he could only keep moving.
They never remember afterwards what the fight was about, but it doesn't stop them fighting – does it ever with anyone? It is a wonder that the fights still escalate, still descend the way they do, knowing – but both forget this at the angry times – that the cause will be lost in the morning and only the ghosts of the feelings and the way in which they made up afterwards will remain. At least half of the time – they are both able to admit this these days – they seek the argument out, just for the pleasure of
“I'm here, aren't I?”
He repeats their names over and over in his head, a better three words than
“Yes.”
The worst thing about arguing with Draco, Harry has discovered after three years of marriage and eight years of school, is not the viciousness, the hurt caused, or barbs thrown. It's not how hard they can get under each other's skin or how predictably one of them – usually him -will end up wanting to punch the other. No, he's used to all this. The worst part is how hard Draco can take himself down these days, how suddenly and savagely he can turn on himself and rip himself to pieces, and that cuts at Harry like like a knife. He still remembers a kid who could never even have
he remembers, as he heads out a few minutes later – that was the band name, last he heard of it.
is about the most he has said to anyone in the four days he has been here, half babbled nightmares to his mother not counting.
“That's a first -”
“We're not – I mean – oh for fuck's sake -” Draco exhales heavily, looks up at the ceiling as if for patience, but also to stop his eyes from leaking, George knows the look - “Sometimes -” Draco whispers very fast and sudden - “Sometimes I think there

“I thought you knew me better than that,” he sneers; it slithers through his chest like a lie - “I can't
“I know, but this was funnier.”
that's what that voice is - “Not that I don't appreciate you being here, but did you come up here just to talk about babies? Also –
“Shut up Malfoy -” it comes out aggressive, almost angry, but it isn't anger, just lust, just need, just the fire rushing out of the chest and into Draco's mouth when Harry kisses him again, savage and demanding and needy. Draco's kiss back is as brutal a fight; and neither will ever win, he realises – both of them get it – almost at once in this kiss – that it never
“Hurts -” he whispers appreciatively - “Yes, hate me.”
It takes Draco so long to react, Harry is afraid for a while that he will not. When he does, he looks around the room for someone, perhaps who will stop him having to be visible.
Wow, Potter.”
he knows what it means, he leans back and slams into him savagely. This time he does run nails down his back, making marks that leap out in instant red; he's so soft, Harry hears himself hiss between his teeth – he could hurt him so easily. This is why he kept away, why he hated him, why Draco always got him

“Yes mum.”
they move without magic? The city around her – so much bigger in everything than London – and in truth, she never looked so hard at Muggle London – always knowing where to go for what she needed, it had been easy to ignore the rest of the city, not to look at the contraptions that shaped it – and then after years spent living in the country, the city had started to feel like something to avoid, but here she finds herself almost overwhelmed by the height of the buildings, the shine of metals and the flash of colours from moving screens and faster moving vehicles. It feels like being on another planet, she is almost afraid – enough for Shacklebolt to maybe sense it a little because he turns his head just enough to ask -
“That's alright, she doesn't like anyone – except those two. Sometimes me, and she's just protective that's all.”
I will torture
There is something horrifyingly healing in the way Harry touches him, something that almost makes him capable of hope – if only he did not have to be so adamant on keeping his shirt
He wonders now, as Draco trawls him patiently through room after room, some of them with everything under dust sheets, some of them arranged in so perfect a way as to prove that nobody ever uses them, all glittering candelabra, sconces, mirrors, gilt edges and ancient furniture – what Aunt Petunia would make of Malfoy Manor. He amuses himself in a room of very old, incredibly boring portraits of Malfoys past by imagining inviting her here, introducing his nearest living relatives to the in-laws. He cannot imagine whose face would be the better picture, Uncle Vernon's or Lucius Malfoy's. He snorts out loud at the image.
It would be so easy to go to him, to sink back into that bed with its memories now that tingle him delightfully and just carry on in this state of pleasure and calm broken only by passion. He swears internally –
He doesn't mean to snap, it's just the relief of actually being able to talk about it coupled with the awareness that it
“What, thank you? It's not me who never says -”
“In theory. But no, we've never met.”
“Yeah. Course. I forgot, you weren't there. Last I ever saw of our brave new head, she was sending me to the dungeons for not wanting us all to die. Like she's going to just
“Is that really reason to save them though?”
Oh great. Fan – fucking-tastic. Potter slides onto the bench beside him and holds out a flask. He ignores it. So, strop witnessed by all then, inclusing the waiting Quidditch teams, and frankly fuck them – including
Draco takes it, half in a daze, stares at it, feels the length of it in his hands for a long time, turns it around wonderingly -
“What? Fleur? Really?” Hermione frowns - “She's – well, I think she's quite difficult to like, to be honest.”
“Thanks kid,” Draco jerks his chin. “She'll be right along.”
“I should -” they both say, then stop. Harry waves a hand for Draco to go on, Draco wishes he hadn't.
“He says in a
“You just said I was too qui -”
“Shut up. But you kept being a dick, didn't you? I wanted – I don't know what I wanted -” he sighs, walks into the living room, slumps in the corner of the antique green sofa. It occurs to Draco how easily he could just fuck off now, head back to his room like he had thought he wanted to in the first place but here he is, pulled after Potter as though on a string, as though he cannot fall out of orbit or he'll just plummet through space. The cord that binds them never has been able to stretch far enough for comfort. He takes the other side of the sofa, pulling his legs up and holding himself tight around the knees.
“I was
feel like it goes that far back, like there has always been this core of him that was amused by Malfoy's humour, ennervated by his presence, tingling beneath his scornful silvery gaze.
“Do you?”
“For the purposes of handing you over to Voldemort?”
“Pans -” he sighs and this time he does turn round, leaning against the stone – Granger punched him here once, he rememebrs with sudden bizarre detachment. He sighs heavily. She leans against the nearest stone, one foot crooked up against it, waiting. She takes a cigarette case from her back trouser pocket and offers it to Draco before taking hers. He shakes his hand absently at first and then sighs again – this time at her -
“Oh, 'cause you don't have yours hanging up in a wardrobe. I'll stop wearing it when it stops annoying you.”
The girls turn and start getting Quidditch balls out as the rest of the team turn their back on the glaring glam rockers, getting into position.

The fact is that the fear of it all makes him unsure he is making the right decision in choosing to return to Hogwarts for their final year. As soon as this occurs to him he decides to talk about it to someone. He formulates a definite plan to do it just after their visit to Diagon Alley, a bit late he supposes but once again – everything has happened so fast since decisions were made. But then he looks over at Draco in Madam Malkin's, sees him smile, remembers with him that first meeting and how excited they both were – albeit at a distance to each other then that they do not have now – and he can only assume that Draco's mentioning it means he is just as excited to be going back now. He cannot bring himself to broach his uncertainties about the whole thing in the face of what looks to him like Draco's enthusiasm; he could never do anything to dampen any spark of brightness in him. So he does not mention it.
“Draco,” Narcissa sighs wearily. “Meet your Great Aunt Walburga. Can't anything be done about her?” she adds in an aside to Harry - “Auntie always was rather strident, most undignified – you couldn't take her down?”
On nights like this it feels like he might have been. Like he could not get a thing right in his life and the movement of the curtain in the breeze is the shiver of snakeskin along the floor and his left arm itches in persistent reminder of a boy who fucked up and he wants so much just to be told he got something right, just once, that he might deserve this life that still bewilders him with it's happiness and levity.
“Probably. He's not very bright.”
“You heard. Or rather -” Harry snaps - “You didn't. Because you were
“- Cissy,” she says after a brief pause for thought - “Cissy Black.”
“Do you not?” Hermione looks at him curiously as though

when nothing has changed? He knows, but it's so lame – it was seeing Katie Bell talking to Potter in the Great Hall, and the feelings crowding him like Dementors – fear of discovery, jealousy that Potter cared enough to talk to
she sighs instead - “You could have -”
“Yeah right, like I could tell him that. I think you all forget how much I used to hate him. It's all just happened so fast, I'm only seventeen, Hermione, did you remember? Cause I'd sure as hell forgotten. It's too much – I can't -” he sighs enormously - “I can't suddenly tell him he's the world to me can I? He'd do a bloody runner.”
“I, for one, support it,” Draco agrees.
he spits it out the same way Draco spat out his - “You started this. You were being a jerk. Now you want me to start listing your good qualities just so's to feel better?”
“So uh -” he looks round at them all - “Hermione told you the plan right? Does uh – anyone have any questions.”
“Right,” he says, but he still utterly fails to take the offered arm. In the end Draco has to grab his arm and slip it under his. He tries not to think about the warmth of Draco's body against his, the feel of that arm beneath his hand. He focuses only on remembering not to squeeze or stroke – even then he suspects he did something wrong, because Draco arches an eyebrow at him, flickers him the ghost of a wry grin -
hard, he had thought every day that something or other might get him killed. Above all, his mother had repeated, insistence hiding her own terror – he couldn't cry, he could never cry; when they gave him the Dark Mark he had to grit his teeth and heart, and numb his brain and pretend it didn't hurt, that he wanted this, that he was
that he's shut out from, and though that's alright, he does suddenly feel a little jealous – not of any one of them but of the soft, easy affection he cannot possibly imagine having in a romantic relationship. And why is that? A voice niggles at him –
“Oh, really?” Draco pushes his sleeve back.
“Pansy shut up, come
that arsehole – he's coming to meet him, and he
“Music is often cheering me up,” Krum nods, suddenly; Harry hadn't even been sure he was listening, so placid and quiet in conversation it's often easy to forget he's there, but he listens attentively, he knows that, especially when Hermione is talking. She turns round a little to him now with a smile that makes it impossible not to see the affection all over her face -
“Yeah?”
“My quarters then, maybe half the west wing.”
He snorts a laugh himself to hear her use the phrase but he nods -
The way Draco says it, Harry almost expects a burst of sunlight to come out of the clouds just in time to cast a golden glow across the house and surrounding parks as they approach the driveway. It doesn't, of course, not over this house.
and she's afraid, volatile as both boys are, that anything that came out of their encounter might just make things worse. It feels as though they are simultaneously avoiding each other and keeping strict tabs on each other.
“There's Viktor -”

there's a bullying first year in him still but it turns itself on himself –
“Wasn't worried, Granger.”
Harry – when you were supposed to be asleep. Things I never need to hear again.”
“Did Hermione send you to tell me to talk to Draco? Because I
“What's that?” Luna nods at the bundle in Hermione's arms.
“You do know that would have been a much more dramatic announcement if we didn't all know that already right, Malfoy?”
“Oh my, mention Saint Potter and suddenly he has a face.”
“Poetry Potter? Didn't know you had it in you.”
as he snaps at him one afternoon when trying to point this out, Harry giving him a face like he hates him again, grumping
It seems to Narcissa, when she comes back down in their wake, that the shadows maybe have lessened just a fraction, that Draco's tiny frightened, brave whisper left the room just a little lighter than it was before. She smiles.

“A drawer?”
“Fireworks!” Hermione shouts in the tone of voice that heavily implies she has said this already and probably more than once - “I told you already!” she adds - “More than once! You're coming, aren't you?”
“Yes. It was exceptional. To be chosen; but do you know something, Malfoy? I have spoken to many girls, girls who were

“I said no on both counts,” Hermione agrees. “You two are a nightmare and you do not
“Well bloody
“No Draco?” is actually the first thing he says, which warms her to him all the more.
Far from all of the Order have come. On his request Hermione had made it clear that this plan was one that might mean keeping the Malfoys some number of weeks at Grimmauld place, for which he suspects he needs at least a good few of them to stay. Luna is there of course, Molly and Arthur, Bill and Fleur, Hermione, Ron, Ginny and last of all George, trailing after his family like a shadow.
The corner of Draco's lip turns up -
“Oh,” Draco says impassively. “Yay. Muggle festivities with Granger and the weasels, I can barely contain my joy.”
“I'm – having a moment?” he attempts.
“What's that?
“Doesn't matter,” he spits eventually. “It's obvious why you wouldn't.”
“What's going on?” he frowns.
“Yeah.”

“Look Malfoy, if you wanna fight me

“Like it was all happening again. I could

“It's been a while,” Draco shrugs - “It was learn some wandless magic or nothing.”
“Georgie? Dead Georgie? That you?”
“Yes? No? I don't know? God, I don't know Hermione, okay? I just – I wanted to help them and I thought – well I thought the trial – what I said – and then bringing them here – that that would help but Malfoy's – well he's -”
of all things; her mind almost mutters
“Okay. Right.” Harry nods, gathering himself together whilst Hermione huffs over the documented evidence of Luna's brilliance - “Together then,” he looks around the room - “Together, like we should be, and if it's broom closets it's broom closets – it's only three terms.”
“Present.”
or whatever you call it?”
“That's right. Be brave, Harry Potter, you know you can be.”
“She wants to talk to you, too. Look – I don't want to be difficult -”
He knows Draco will never believe
“Of course you do,” Draco sighs, a full bodied sigh. “You always do, don't you? That's why we never get anything solved. Oh, what

“It does happen.” Narcissa wipes one finger under her eye but she keeps her other hand in Andromeda's grasp - “Look, I understand,” she says eventually. “I do not expect you to forgive me – there's so much that has happened, so much still happening – but we are not who we once were – any of us, and perhaps with time you and I could be – something like sisters again?”
It all suddenly seems quite comically familiar, like he's twelve again and just about to hear that the Slyherins have booked the pitch in advance of them to train their new seeker. Only Flint's with them now and he

He's still feeling pleasantly wrung out a minute later, stepping out of the shower and wrapping a towel round himself, feeling the warm wash of vague – if nowhere near quite enough – relief. All the same he lets out an actual shriek as the changing room door flies open and an unwelcomed pointy face peeks in, nose held even higher than usual.
Harry Potter – had refused his proffered friendship. He didn't know how it could have happened, how that was even
He gives Harry the same curious look that Pansy had and drifts off before waiting for an answer. Harry spares half a frown in wondering hat it is they're both looking at when they look at him like that – but not more than half a frown of half a moment of wondering because he cannot tear his eyes, ears or mind away from Draco, how could anyone? He's riding the sky on rainbows, bathing in changing coloured lights. It's a dream, Draco's dream and he is in it. He wonders if the colours he sees are the colours of Draco's thoughts and he's spinning at how beautiful they are and then -
“Mmhmm”
“No,” Hermione – he realises slowly – looks like she's just only now working it out herself. “
“I saw Draco rescue a spider from a leaky tap once,” Luna informs them vaguely, and slowly everyone leaves, leaving Harry awkwardly alone with Ginny, Ron and Hermione tactfully excusing themselves and hurrying into the next room.
“Not especially. My presence seems to be bothering you, and honestly that's too good to miss.”
“Someone like me? And tell me – in your opinion – what is that?”
“Yeah.” Harry stops in the corridor, students all around them - “I did. It's just – ah, I dunno Hermione - he didn't say it back, did he? For all I know, he hates me – more than ever after – after -” he makes a helpless flap of the hand and starts walking away down the corridor, Hermione trotting after him, sick of this.

“Shut up, you dickhead, yeah, everything, everything I ever wanted Draco -” his voice softens and with the softening his voice cracks, ready to break, ready to cry - “- I love you. I love you like I've never loved anything and it scares me half to death and more -” he's shaking, even Draco can see it and his eyes, watching Harry, soften too - “- because I can't lose you. Even when you drive me insane. Even when I hate you. Do you know who told me to go after you?”
“Yeah,” says Ron - “I don't get it mate – arent't we supposed to be rounding up Death Eaters, not rescuing them?”
“I've never -” but he trails off; he's always been a bit hit and miss at lying and he remembers far too suddenly that he
“Ready?”
“Keep it,” Draco hears himself say it before he realises he's doing it, but he hands it back before he can stop himself.
and the first cries he makes when Harry is completely inside him are pained, yes, but they pause long enough for him to breathe and after that – it's not even just the feeling of Harry inside him, his chest pressed into Draco's back, the tension in their limbs and the cool gritty press of the wall against his palms – it's very far from just that, it's the knowing that's it

“Shut it, Bessie.”
As an afterthought she scribbles down -
Even if he did not look like
though he would never say it – not the second part at least, never even assume it even though every line of tension in Draco's body asks to be claimed, to be made over, all the sharp lines and angles of him begging to be softened but incapable of asking it in words. Harry cannot state ownership and when his kisses reach the inner elbow of the left arm he remembers why. Draco freezes at that pause, tries to pull his arm away to hide the mark, squirming like a vampire twisting its way out of the sunlight, but he cannot – Harry has always been the stronger, and he will not let him; he carries on his kisses all the way down to the wrist, pressing determined lips that brook no objection into the helpless, upturned palm. He knows then that he is going to say it, fifteen years of unspoken truce be damned.

Fleur rolls her eyes and curls into the sofa like a Siamese cat, watching Narcissa with an unsettling smile – as though she finds her curious. Narcissa looks down at the letter in her hands -
Harry chokes back laughter and shock – he has never seen Walburga beam before, and thinking about it – he rather wishes he never had.
This is the worst thing in many ways; the part of him that really

“Well we'll catch you later,” Ron says, saving her. A little way down the hill they turn round hearing a wailing squawk of a noise, to see Pansy banging her head against a rock and Draco simultaneously patting her on the shoulder and shaking with laughter.
“Yes.” Draco stops, shoulders stiff, not turning to face her, staring out past the standing stones to the forests below - “Yes fine, alright, I freaked out. Happy now?” He drops his head and she can see the tell – tale pink steal up the back of his neck. But she's her, she doesn't care if he

“Delacour-Weasley,” Fleur nods - “It does not sound a good combination? I think? What do you think?”
Being away from all that ought to be better but it hardly is, not with the weight of his task sitting on his chest like a snake, coiled and crushing down on him so he can barely breathe. All these years wanting to be

His forehead creases ever so slightly as he opens the lid and quite lovingly touches the black and white keys with gentle fingers, the softness of which touch might have surprised anybody else. He plays a couple of notes and then haltingly a few slow opening bars, falteringly trying to rememember the pattern at the back of his mind. It starts to drift up from the keys like lanterns being let off into a night sky, and Harry finds himself smiling at the sound, like magic swelling cautiously in the room, like something over-large but very gentle trying to pad quietly through the halls, something soft and shy like the moon hiding behind a cloudy sky – a nocturne, has to be, maybe Chopin – dragging up memories of classic FM in the kitchen, Sunday afternoons at Privet Drive. It's like a spell and he is enchanted by the caster, riding on the the notes, watching those slender fingers glide across the ivory – Draco's face pale and thoughtful, half in a dream, with eyes like two bright stars and
“Get out of my way, Potter -” the butterfly is hammering at him, he is ready to hyperventilate from the feeling that he might cry, and please gods no not in front of

Malfoy fronted a wizard glam rock band; he was wondering when it had started, if he could remember the band name, what name Malfoy was going by these days if it wasn't Malfoy. He remembered, if nothing else, why he would have ditched the name, at least for all public purposes. He remembers the last time he saw Malfoy, just after the trial where he had spoken up for them, saving both Draco and his mother from Azkaban. As he recalled even Lucius had been given a suspended sentence, even that which was reduced in the end to – he forgets how many years – of house arrest. He remembers the boy he had watched in the court room; he had watched him almost the whole time, the pale, pinched and frightened face he had barely dared raise, a voice he could hardly make audible, as though he did not even believe in his own defence. He had looked shocked when sentence was not pronounced, watched Harry like a frightened gazelle when he testified on their behalf. Harry had tried to go over to them the moment court was adjourned, to say something – anything – a thank you, a hand shake, a cessation of hostilities if nothing else. He had wanted to give Malfoy his wand back, to tell him what he had realised standing on the bridge outside of Hogwarts in that melancholy, hopeful moment of telling Ron and Hermione it was Draco who'd has ownership of the Elder wand all along. So many things had come together in his head, solidifying in his heart the moment he had heard the softness with which he'd said Draco's name. He had been ready, at that moment, post trial, to confess everything, to ask Draco to offer him his hand again, just so he could take it this time.
of course, better than anyone perhaps in the entire wizarding world, she saved it after all, did she not? With a lie? But she finds herself not wanting to now. She knows what this strange young woman is talking about well enough, is just startled to hear her say it and so plainly. Her rude, abrupt manner of speech would clash with her elegant beauty if the one did not rather explain the other. Clearly this is a lady who has always felt confident enough to speak as she finds – the choice to do so is alien to Narcissa, though the confidence she greatly admires. If only she could find away to give Draco a little of
with me, were you Potter?”
“How do you know about that?” Suddenly he's wary, half rising, half ready to bolt, but Potter grabs his wrist before he can get up.
“No, you were just gonna wait until I heard you tell Granger. Coward.”
“Please.” Harry feels like he might break apart and all the broken bits would cut everyone in the house to pieces and Draco the worst. “If you're going to tell me to go, tell me -”
this to him? He's always seemed to have the natural ability to make Harry look like an utter idiot, always. He has rarely felt himself anything beyond an utter unworthy imbecile in his presence even while he despised him for his snooty, mean spirited pureblood self. He supposes he should be grateful; time was he would have given rather a lot to see him returned to the irritating little shit of the first few years at school and maybe – yes in all seriousness, perhaps he

say his looked both evil and gay.”
As everyone starts to fan off in their separate directions and he leads the family to a corridor of rooms on the second floor, he notices only that Draco is glaring at him from narrowed eyes with a cutting glance like fire on a knife, and that his lip is curled like a tongue of flame. It makes him feel curiously hopeful, nostalgic even, and something else he cannot name.
“Mine,” he finishes, swearing silently to make it true.
“I -” the whole courtroom can hear Draco's jerky breaths and something in Harry aches for him - “Yes – that – that's correct.”
“Oh pfft. I saved the saviour, didn't I?”
Harry slides down the wall, legs boneless, another small whimper escaping him.
George looks around him at the foyer, the grand starway, the place where it happened, the place where he died.
“Jesus, shut
“Look, we'll go again after lunch,” Flint sighs - “Take the rest of the morning to get a grip Potter, work it out and come back ready to play this time, not – look never mind, just sort it out okay?”
ith the drinks stand that appears in the middle of them, the house offering up its congratulations.
“Because I've been doing some research on the history of the place, and really some of the things I've been finding out are
“Yeah -” he leans back against the heavy wood table, slumping his shoulders and curling his hands protectively around a cup of tea held in front of him - “Yeah it's that – it's just – it's just

“I don't believe – no I
“Yeah I'm gonna – pretend you didn't make that comparison.”
“Alright.” Percy puts a hand on his shoulder and indicates the way he's ending off up the stairs.
“Jealous, Malfoy? Since first year.”

“What? Yes. Of course.”
“It's just gone nine, about half an hour ago but I had to eat jelly and hold a baby first – he's very uneventful but the jelly had orange bits in it, you should try some- and I'm here to help Hermione help you because she's stressed, only she's pretending she isn't because she's Hermione. Not in that order though, reverse that order, can I come in?”
The words are out of him before he can stop them. He feels like he has just thrown up all over Potter's feet. The other boy looks at him almost as though he has. His face goes through a dance of expressions that might have been funny under other circumstances.
Harry thinks, frustrated fists clenched, punching the counter top he was backed up against, unsure whether to follow or stay and dithering in the kitchen in the late afternoon sunlight.
struggling, he's just never kissed anyone so hard in his life, it feels like a battle. He remembers this – though it's been what, two years at least? He remembers it always feeling like a fight, always leaving him more satisfied than any other sensation he could imagine, or experience. He's so hungry – he had had no idea how desperate he was for this and he suspects the feeling's mutual but it is the first thing that has felt good in a long time and he kisses Potter like something feral might attack it's prey, like it's life saving, nourishing, necessary to exist. His hands are everywhere and it feels like they're pushing but they're not they're pulling closer like they could please, please inhabit the exact same space and there is a hand on the back of his neck, pinching at his skin and pulling at his hair and it makes his head spin and he's so hard, grinding it against the boy he hates in rage and urgency and need and it still feels like he could cry at any moment.
to make the choice to fight them or not and yes alright, she admitted a lot of us would have chosen the Dark Lord's side but she said she wasn't going to judge that either, not after some of the things she saw – I think she meant
Shipwrecked survivors, they cling to each other as though the other were a life raft, shaking with the waves that subside in the wreckage all around them.
“- Fred,” George finishes for him, and gods it's good to finish somebody's sentence for them.
“Don't do
be persuaded, however much he knows better than to share his worst opinions these days) Harry grits his teeth and swings his plan into action. Then, that night when Draco gets home, he picks a fight with him on purpose. Draco's always easy to bait; he's known this since first year, it's something they have in common after all, and it works like a charm.
“Oh fuck off-” He's talking more to himself than to Potter, trying to snark away the prickling feeling behind the eyes – how did he manage to hold back tears so sucessfully every time he had to over the last two years, but now he's just a sodding waterfall? Like Potter might be safe to cry in front of, where the Dark Lord wasn't? He has to remind himself otherwise quite fiercely - “Fuck off, Potter, this isn't a pity party”.
love you!” Draco blurts quickly, as afraid it seems of Harry's readiness to back off as Harry is to hear a negative answer. He had thought – from what they'd done, from the aching sweetness of this past hour's kisses, the shuddering in his chest that he had felt in Draco's own, from the brightness that may have tears in Draco's eyes when he looked at him, when they kissed, when Harry's lips pressed into his inner left arm – from the almost irrelevance of fucking – he had thought all that could have only been love but -
“Honestly not much – always made me feel a bit – I dunno – strange. Besides I've usually had a lot more to think about.”
“When you said I should be given to Voldemort. I'm sorry about how everyone else reacted. I wouldn't have – I mean – well shit – I gave myself to him half an hour later anyway, didn't I?”
Draco is still laughing as he puts the hood back up and when his back is turned Harry cannot help but smile; it feels as though a little bit of ice melts out of his chest at hearing Draco laugh and - at his expense though it may be - he finds himself wanting more than anything to make that happen again and as much as possible.
“Never you mind.”
“Blerghk -” Pansy croaks, still bizarrely angled with her forehead planted firmly in a stone. Draco looks around a little nervously.
“Wow, Potter,” in tones of faintly sarcastic deadpan that frankly impresses him - “dramatic entrance much?”
“-thank you,” Draco says stiffly, awkwardly, but with a curious quiver around the lips that suggests he means it deeply - “I won't. I hope -” he raises his head a little, pulling his chin up as though with a great effort - “I hope you – I hope it works out for you – you know.”
“Don't say it if you don't mean it, Narcissa!” Andromeda snaps.
“Only – eight years, you wanker. Does that mean -” He half smiles, a wry little twist of the mouth - “Do
really not popular these days – Black, though – that I can still get away with, also it sounds good. I should go apologise to Blaise.”
There's only one thing he can do; be the coward he always knew he was and run away. He can picture all that ice creeping out from his heart, turning him into a statue of himself and shattering apart, damaging everyone around him with the splinters. He walks briskly, not quite running, out of the house and slamming the door savagely behind him.
nice to me. Of course at other times she asks me if Death Eaters eat road kill but -”
Funny how all that time ago using Draco's first name had been just about the most affectionate gesture he could make, now using each other's second names is either a term of endearment or faux – angry flirting.
“I love you all and you have many fine qualities,” Harry sighs, but he's smiling as he waves her good night for real this time.
his own voice, in retrospect so weak, so insincere. All illusion that he had any choices in the world, any kind of power or strength, had died that night with Dumbledore. Senses, memories, all roll around inside him like a House of Horror ride that he cannot get off – he can see the voices, hear the green, taste the skitter of Dumbledore's wand across the stone. It occurs to Draco that one does not necessarily experience memory with the correct senses. None of it makes sense, and all of it is just one big sensation like threads of a spider's web closing in on him in one big prison. Why come up here? Why? Like the nightmares of that night weren't enough, reliving the sick horror of realising what he'd let into the school, thinking about what he had been sure/ not sure at all he was going to do – imagining taking a life, saying those acid green words
Do it. Hurt me. You think you could do anything to me someone's not already tried?”
“Also I've decided – the bathroom is now off limits for angst, crying or otherwise brooding. New house rule. Okay?”
By rights they should not be flying out here, in a place where muggles might see. But it's early July and the air is heady with the warm smell of cornfields, there's magic in the air, and they are both rule breakers at heart, really. More to the point, it's not like he can ever really deny this idiot anything. He can see him shining up ahead, hair bright, face wicked and alive in the moonlight, teeth white when he turns his head to grin because -
“Blaise you slut, you'd
“I wish Luna
no place for us in this new system -”
like kissing Draco is on a par with taking another breath and he
“It's a big pitch – we can't just share?”
“I can go either way,” Hermione shrugs, looking between Ron and Viktor in a way that makes Harry wonder if she's still talking about music. He feels suddenly like he needs to be elsewhere – or that he needs to give them time without him.
“You're asking me if I think Harry is – what? In love with Draco?” Hermione stands up and sits down again - “
He knows it sounds over dramatic, but it honestly feels like he
“Shut up, Potter.” Draco swings open a set of double doors into the bedroom, dominated by a gigantic green and gold draped four poster. Harry finds himself struggling to look at that bed; his stupid brain has to go
“Here here Malfoy!” Ron almost cheers - “I'm on if the rest of you are – Harry?”
“I'm Luna,” she says helpfully. “Luna Lovegood. I was in your dungeon for half a year. It wasn't very nice, but it's it's alright now. You don't have to speak to me if you don't want to. I'm looking for Harry Potter. You have a very nice wife and child. Goodbye.”
“Mind you -” he muses aloud as they trail out of the room – although
“On the other hand we don't want to be back in separate dorm rooms, in different houses, unable to spend night times with the people we love do we?” Luna offers - “Not when we've been fucking all summer.”
remember?”
“Well it's clearly somebody mate, you've gone red as a ruby – c'mon, you can tell me -”
sounds so very Hermione it hurts - “She was a queen who turned into a statue, then came back to life- I loved that play, it was so full of magic – and Hermione – she was so strong and patient and clever, I thought – that's what I'd look for in a daughter, but -” she stops. “I really don't know why I'm telling you all this.”
him. It feels as though the sofa is simultaneous incredibly long, with Potter far too far away from him for comfort, and far too small, throwing them too closely together.
“You heard me,” the girl repeats - “beautiful. Like sun and moon and they do not even know it.” She splays out her fingers, admiring the shine of varnish in the greenish light.
“Come on, get up! It's a perfect night for flying.”
"He caught me in your bushes Aunt Petunia, so he chased me out." Petunia slapped him.
Remus watched as the Malfoy boy taught Hari to fly. Even when he had hated the Malfoy family, he knew they were good on a broom, even though the boy's grip was wrong. And... Remus didn't hate the Malfoys anymore. Their rivalry was childish, and the Malfoy family seemed... Much more kind. They had been through war, and come out losing, and yet... This seemed to strengthen them, make them better people. Remus spared a quick glance at Lucius, who was watching the boys with a fond smile on his face.
“Was struggling with-”
"You really think so?" Harry asked. He had never really gotten a compliment before, and had just tended to think he was ugly. Draco nodded, a blush on his face. "Thanks. That's very nice of you." The embarrassed tensity of Draco's body seemed to melt away.
"Maybe you and Hari would like to come over again sometime," Lucius said smoothly. Remus was slightly taken aback at this. But Hari did seem to love Draco's company, and Remus would like to put their past behind them.
"Aha! You're a Weasley!"
"Of course not, why would anyone be friends with a weakling like me?" Dudley seemed satisfied with that answer. He swiftly punched Harry in the stomach.
