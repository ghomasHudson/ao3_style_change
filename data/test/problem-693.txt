They apparated outside Grimmauld Place a short while later, and climbed the stairs to the front door. Standing there, Harry grabbed Draco’s hand and raised his wand to lift the protective enchantments they’ve set in place.
‘Harry, dear, slow down please. We don’t understand half of what you’re talking about…’ Narcisa was looking somehow ashamed of herself.
- Stay out of this. – Draco didn’t even look at Harry. – Listen to me, Weasel. If I were you, I’d think long and hard about saying anything else right now. You don’t want to cross me.
‘For your information, no. It’s actually the complete opposite. Although I don’t know why you would be interested.’
‘Microwave. It’s a machine that heats up food. Sort of like an oven, but not as big. You put the food inside, set the time and it comes out warm. Well, mostly at least. Muggles have whole dinners you can put in there. You buy a tray that has for instance some meat, potatoes and peas, you heat it up in the microwave and you’ve got yourself a dinner. Most of the time it doesn’t taste very good, but if you don’t have time, it’s alright.’
Harry couldn’t sleep. At 3 a.m. he just laid there, after hours of tossing and turning, listening to Malfoy’s breathing and the sounds of owl wings swooshing behind the window. He tried to empty his mind, but it was no use, the persistent thoughts he was battling ever since the dust of the final battle has collected were back stronger than before. He never wanted this. He never wanted to be the icon, the Boy Who Lived, the Chosen One, the (he thought he heard that one somewhere, but he couldn’t place where) Two Time Survivor. He never wanted to have people gather around him, look at him as a leader. Hell, Hermione was a much better leader than he was! The only reason he was unceremoniously shoved into the role was this stupid scar on his forehead. And worse of all, he knew full well he couldn’t tell any of his friends how he felt. Ron’s assumption back in 4
There was only one line, written in a thin, slanted script Harry thought was vaguely familiar, but he couldn’t quite place where he saw it:
‘NEVILLE?!’ Harry thought he was going to faint. This cannot be happening, this has to be a bad dream… ‘But… but how?’
‘No, it doesn’t. Can you tell me what’s going on? How’s Harry? What happened?’ Questions were swirling in his mind.
‘It needs a sacrifice.’ Harry heard Draco’s voice. It was disturbing – the tone was completely flat, with no emotion in it, like he was describing the weather forecast. ‘Hand me the knife – bottom drawer of the nightstand, under the potions book.’
So when on Thursday morning Potter was (yet again!) loudly groaning in what Draco knew was the general direction of the bathroom door, to indicate that His Majesty was now ready to shove whatever t-shirt he found at the bottom of his trunk on himself, 15 minutes before breakfast, Draco has had enough. He slammed the door open angrily glaring daggers at the Saviour Of All Wizards and barked “what do you want now?”.
‘Beats me. Lucius must’ve pulled some serious strings. He got assigned to Roberts, so there’s hope he’ll fall out, but if you ask me, his father will do anything to keep him there at all costs.’
It did hurt. Draco had no idea how much time has passed since he opened that door in his room or even where he was – all he was able to focus on was that his whole body hurt like never before. Getting branded with a Dark Mark, withdrawal symptoms, getting
- I do. And I remember you trying to convince me I was trying to kill myself. And now you’re hovering over me like some bloody dementor shoving God knows what down my throat!
- That I can’t help you with. If you were a girl I’d say the trick is to be sensual and seem like every client is your first client of the day. And your looks would be a plus, this ethereal type is very popular, so you could capitalise off that. But that’s from my perspective, like I said, I don’t know what sells in the gay scene.
Weeks went by. Hufflepuffs and Ravenclaws were still ignoring Harry and his new group of friends like before, but what changed was that now Gryffindors seemed to be scared of them. Harry didn’t blame them. If he was in their position, what happened between him, Draco and Dean would be more than enough to keep his distance. But he talked to Draco and he believed him when he said he was sorry for what he did. Maybe it was naivety on his part, maybe it was love, Harry didn’t know. But the more time went by, the more Harry was sure Draco would not do that again and the fact that nobody was willing to do anything that would provoke another outburst of fury only helped.
‘Oh, yes, indeed I have! Three rather charming young boys came by last Friday. They told me You-Know-Who’s followers were rallying again and they were naturally up to no good, so they’ve taken it upon themselves to help out the elderly, since the Ministry is so far away from here.’ She told Ron excitedly. ‘But they demanded a little too much money for my taste so I declined. After all, I’m old anyway, I might die any moment now, so what use would it be to me?’
‘My suspicion is that if the confessions fall, they will be looking for other evidence to implicate you. There is still time to fight it, but I need your help – was the Manor emptied completely when the authorities confiscated our belongings? Is there
‘That’s just gross misconduct. That ranges from reprimand, to pay cuts, to demoting or having to work under a supervisor. If I was judging this, I’d go for the supervisor probably…’
- Oh, so you have no faith in your new boytoy, do you? You’re scared he’ll lose? Oh, wait, I forgot, you’re the…
‘Do you confirm that you are in fact the person who is set to be questioned today?’ Shacklebolt addressed Draco.
seriously. So seriously in fact, that Hermione, of all people, had to remind him on occasion that there is, in fact, life outside of work. ‘Malfoy!’
‘Why? What are you talking about?’ Harry had a gut feeling what Draco was going to say next, but decided to keep his fiancée’s spirits up at all costs.
- Draco… What is that? – Harry was stuttering. Draco on the other hand, seemed completely unbothered with basically being mutilated.
- Am I wrong? Am I? Tell me Hermione, do you honestly believe it’s humanely possible for Malfoy to “take care” of Harry? He’s as evil as they come! Not to mention stupid! And Harry, you should know better than that! Last year you won the war, not to mention you DIED in the process, and now you want an ex-Death Eater to control your life?! Are you completely INSANE?! – Ron was screaming and all Harry could do at this point was to hope nobody overheard. He scolded himself for not casting Muffliato at the door. He should’ve known Ron would go off like that.
Harry smiled and wrapped his arms around Draco’s waist. Once again, they were lost in the kiss – and just like two weeks before, it was full of hunger, desperation,
- Oh, I’ll fight you all right. Good practice for when I’ll be hunting down your friends. And as an added bonus, one less Death Eater to worry about later. – Ron was as tall as Draco, so when they were standing face to face with only a narrow table between them, neither was intimidating the other.
‘So what? I decided I’m going to stop fighting what happens. If he knows what I did in Muggle London, let it be.’
feeling, and not what it looked like, it wasn’t like he didn’t respect Ron enough to talk to him, he was just guarding himself and trying to cope with all that happened ever since Malfoy presumably killed himself.
of sorts, why is that?’ He didn’t sound unpleasant really, but Harry knew that starting with this might mean one of two things – either he was just simply curious, or he was sharing Ron’s suspicion that something was off.
Harry couldn’t help but laugh. ‘You don’t realize how good you have it until you think what you’d have to go through without magic, do you? I used to have to do all those things back at the Dursleys.’
- Never. Address. Him. Like. That. – Draco’s voice was cold as ice. He seemed calm, but Harry could feel his hands trembling with hatred against the school robes he was still holding Harry by.
He knew there was lust, but his other reactions didn’t fit into it at all. On the second inhale the loops his thoughts were going in straightened slightly and he began to see things more clearly. One more and he’ll be there. He closed is eyes and focused on the smoke filling his lungs. So, his wanking session in the shower not only pushed any potential erections away, but it must have diminished the lust ever so slightly, so that the need to have someone there for him was starting to resurface. That must be it, the lust was not part of the loneliness, it was just masking it. And now that he has at least partially taken care of it, the more human needs were coming back again. And that he couldn’t have happen. If the physical needs were hard to bear, the loneliness would kill him. He had a taste of it the last time when he exploded and screamed at that random couple, if it came back even stronger than that, his soul would be torn in half. So, he concluded, it was better to just leave the lust unfulfilled for now, and try to figure this all out once he was out of Potter’s apartment.
- You would do that? – Draco’s eyes filled with tears. – You would really let my mum live in your house?
- What did you tell him? – It was only now that Draco realised that he didn’t exactly want Slughorn to know it was Harry, although he didn’t know why.
- Oh, I see how it’s going to be. So I’m “Wesley” now, huh? It’s a good thing you two ended up together I suppose, you’re turning out to be just as much of a pompous, self-absorbed bastard as your – he spat – boyfriend.
Draco turned Harry around and dropped to his knees. He didn’t have any sort of plan on how to approach this, he didn’t think Harry would want to do it that soon, especially after all they’ve done already, and he was never very good at readying his partners for sex, he was far too greedy and impatient for it. He decided to try and figure it out as they went along – his hope was Harry would give him some indication as to how far he was willing to go tonight. He closed his eyes and ran his tongue along his boyfriend’s split. He heard Harry moan and mutter “fuck” under his breath. He just started circling Harry’s hole with his tongue when another moan reached his ears.
- No, no. – Draco laughed. – I’m just saying maybe you talk to Granger. Wesley doesn’t seem like the type of guy that would give solid love advice.
‘I already answered that question. I was having problems with it, it wasn’t moving forward like I wanted it to, so I decided I needed someone to bounce ideas off of.’
The door opened again, and Yasmine was just about to greet her guest in her most seductive voice, when the words got stuck in her throat. Leaning against the door frame, like nothing was wrong, was Harry bloody Potter.
want to move out. Even if all the unspoken things between them were weighing on Draco like a block of iron, at least he could glance at Harry every so often and pretend he had a chance with him. Once he was gone, there was nothing that would be connecting them anymore, because if Draco knew one thing for sure, it was that, no matter how much he would like for Potter’s offer to still be on the table, there was no chance it would be. Not after what happened between them the night of his acquittal. He sighed. Once again, life has gave him one single second of pure, undisturbed happiness, and snatched it back before he could even try to thaw that solid block of ice that occupied his chest for years now.
Harry sighed. He supposed that was pretty good given the state of affairs between him and his former best friend. He couldn’t do anything else. He thanked Ron and walked back to his own bedroom. As soon as he entered, Draco sat up.
‘Don’t have any. I don’t keep potions in the house usually, if anything happens on the job I get treated back in the office.’
‘No, it’s nothing, just my…’ He hesitated – he didn’t want to tell Draco what hurt him, but he knew it could be important for the job. ‘the scar burned for a second when I touched the wall. But it’s really nothing, it wasn’t even that painful.’
‘Minister, with all due respect, this is an asinine idea.’ Harry looked determined. ‘You cannot force him to do this! Besides, Lucius will figure out something is off! He’ll never talk and if he does, it would be only to implicate Draco – it’s not exactly a secret he’s still angry at him about the refusal to testify!’
On his side of the (still open) door Malfoy looked like someone just hit him in the face with a Bludger. What in the name of Salazar was Potter on about? What does his arse have to do with anything? And since when was Potter even paying attention to its size?!
It felt horrible. It was like someone stuck a hook in his insides and was relentlessly pulling it upward again and again and again, until there was nothing there to be thrown up. And even then, the pulling sensation didn’t stop. The world around Draco got all blurred up, all he could hear was ringing in his ears and all he was able to focus on was the fact that by that point he was puking some disgusting, yellow substance that smelled like rotten eggs. He didn’t even know how long it was before he could take one breath. Once it all somehow settled, he vaguely followed his own thought process what led him to this point – he was going to slice his own wrists open, he was too nervous and downed at least 17 ounces of Potter’s vodka. And now he had to do it all over again if he was to ever succeed in finally killing himself: because no matter how much he hated what he’s gotten himself into, that much he knew – he had to end his life tonight because it was going to be all downhill from here on.
- And unfortunately for you, your objections to my “idea” can accomplish nothing but me observing your interactions with Mr. Malfoy even more closely. Besides, it has been a week already and I am pleased to notice, neither of you have ended up in the Hospital Wing, so that serves to prove my, as you so elegantly put it, “idea” appears to have been a rather correct one.
‘Because I couldn’t seem to crack it on my own. I figured if he was a part of this the sooner we catch the rest of the group, the sooner they will identify him, so he really wasn’t doing himself any favours there. And if he was innocent, well, the faster we solve the case, the better.’
Draco sighed, got up, and took one last look in the mirror. After he talked to Mina two months ago he decided that if he really was going to do this, he was going to do this as a woman. That way he could not only say (to himself, obviously) that Draco Malfoy never did this, but also there was less of a chance anyone would recognize him. It took some time and practice, but he managed to perfect his female alter-ego: she was slightly taller than him, very thin and pale, with long silvery-blonde hair that reached her waist. Her face was not unlike Draco’s own, only her lips were fuller and she had heavy eyelids with long, black lashes. Her name was Yasmine.
- I don’t know. Point is, it was nothing compared to how I was feeling mentally and I wanted to match it. – Draco was determined to look at his feet on the bed while he spoke. Harry wrapped his arms around him and pulled him closer.
‘Yeah, and I’ll tell Kingsley what? That you’ve been taking too much space in my living room? Just shut up and go sleep in my bed.’ Potter sighed in resignation and Draco reluctantly got up to walk into the bedroom.
Harry got up and turned around. Draco was standing behind him, looking scared, tears still glistening in his eyes.
‘No, Minister, I don’t. I realize this was not enough to answer your suspicions. But… Can I stay here and you go on yourselves? I can’t handle what’s in there.’
- Some interesting choice of words there, Potter… - Malfoy looked way too pleased with himself for Harry’s taste.
So, I'm finally getting into the main plot of this thing! I wanted the first chapter to serve as a background that would at least partially explain why stuff was happenning and now we're getting into the full swing of things.
- I tried to convince myself I can’t feel anything towards you because I have to hate you, but after the last one it all just drained from me. I couldn’t pretend anymore.
She scoffed. ‘Don’t lie to me. Neville told me you wanted to talk to him. That’s why he went. And he never came back.’
- He was your friend, if you can even call it that, and you’re all nonchalant about his death?! “He paid for it”? What the bloody fuck does that even mean?!
‘Whatever. I have nothing to say to you or your Auror friends, I have done nothing wrong and I don’t know the people you’re after, so I’m no help at all.’
‘No, it’s… it’s not like that.’ There were tears in Harry’s eyes. ‘I just don’t know who he can tell about you. You ran because you thought I told people and I’m scared you’ll run again…’
- Yeah, because trying to make sure someone doesn’t die is a clear sign of being in love with them. – Draco scoffed. His friends were being even more annoying than before about it. He needed to put an end to this once and for all.
‘You know, Draco, sometimes I think we ought to have introduced some Muggle styles of parenting when you were growing up…’ Narcissa and Harry laughed. Draco looked taken aback for a second, but after a brief consideration, he joined them.
- Apparently, I have a problem with being in charge. As in, I don’t want to be. Not like all the time, sometimes I just want to be left alone… - He hesitated. – To be taken care of actually.
‘No, father. I came to help you.’ He tried to smile or sound genuine, but it wasn’t easy. ‘We have limited time, they only gave me fifteen minutes, so I’ll just go right into it, ok?’ That was a lie, but Draco decided that placing a time limit on the conversation will allow him to avoid explaining what he’s been doing for almost three years now. ‘I’ve been trying to establish myself after the war, and I’ve made some useful contacts in different places – one of them has told me recently that there might be a chance for us to overturn your and mother’s convictions…’
, Potter. We’re talking about your ridiculous notion that I’m into you. Which is not true, by the way.’ If Harry was sober, he might have been able to understand what that weird undertone in Draco’s voice was, but as of right now, his brain was swimming in too much alcohol to manage that task.
‘I don’t know yet. Seeing as we’re both up anyway, we might just as well talk.’ Potter seemed unfazed.
‘Told you, Potter, I’m smart. Frankly, I’m surprised you haven’t managed to figure this much on your own, it’s the only logical conclusion.’
‘So he says. I’ll need to question him formally, but as you can see, he’s denying everything. And if we just let him go, he’ll just fall of the grid again.’ Ron looked worried.
‘Jesus, we’re never going to get through this! Couldn’t they have at least analysed this before sending it over?’
‘Bloody fucking brilliant…’ Ron muttered under his breath ‘now we have gone through all that crap in the pensive for nothing…’ Harry had a sudden inkling that, despite his choice of words, Ron meant something different than them prodding around in some of Draco’s darkest memories being a waste of time. He smiled at his best friend and raised his wand again.
By the time Harry got back to the common room he was fuming. He all but shouted the password at the door (McGonagall decided to use a different method of protecting the 8
‘I always wanted to be an Auror.’ Harry said warily one evening, when they were all sitting in the living room drinking wine. He was afraid to admit it to both Draco and his mother – after all, the main job of an Auror was still to hunt down their former allies, so he didn’t know how his aspirations would be received. ‘But now, I don’t know. It feels like it’s not for me anymore, I’m tired of dealing with what happened and besides, you have to be somewhat of a natural born leader to do it, and…’ He looked at Draco hesitantly. Their first real conversation has been about Harry being drained by having to be a leader, and, no matter if they counted that particular time as part of them being together, it was not like it never happened.
‘What are you getting at? You’re trying to tell me I slept with a suspect on the case?!’ Harry was losing all his composure right now.
And so it seemed, that they were back to where they started from – Harry waking up in the morning, entering the living room in complete silence, and Draco getting up from the couch without a word and moving into Potter’s bedroom to sleep.
‘We both did. Don’t forget, Voldemort lived in our house, we knew everything. That’s why I refused to testify.’
‘No, Malfoy junior. We had an argument in the office and it turned physical. Turns out, the git can throw a punch. Who would’ve thought?’ Ron gestured at his face.
- Oh, if you’re sure then… But I still think it’s not a good option for you. It’s rough out there you know? I’m lucky enough to have a place to work, but most girls are just out on street corners. You’re too soft to survive this.
- It’s a poison you stupid wanker! If you dilute it enough it would just numb everything or possibly knock you out, but you can take just a couple of drops per gallon of water!
- No, he usually just sticks to being a sarcastic jerk nowadays. – Zabini said. – How he acted towards you and your friends before the war was about as severe as he would go back then, if not for the occasional scheme to set someone up for detention, but even then, there was nothing to the extent of his blowup yesterday. Especially since after last year he seemed to be more subdued.
Draco sat up. Why were there tears in his eyes all of a sudden? It was stupid. All this was, was a wasted chance at some (possibly pretty good) sex – and that was nothing to cry over. And just yesterday he was not going to let it happen anyway, so what’s the difference? It was all for the better, really, he needed the lust to cover up the loneliness, so the fact that Potter didn’t want him would only do him good. So why exactly did this realization make him cold all of a sudden? To his horror, Draco realized that there was, once again, only one word that came to mind:
They spent the next four hours in the kitchen, reading through the reports – Harry on a barstool by the island and Draco sitting on its counter, cross-legged.
‘So far I’m with you…’ Draco managed to shake the coldness off. ‘But why exactly did they end up there if there was no trigger? We established they followed events that happened.’
‘Go ahead.’ Kingsley nodded. Draco was visibly scared. He groaned in pain when the thin, silver strand of his memories connected to the tip of Ron’s wand. It seemed to take forever, like Ron was doing this on purpose, to cause as much pain as he could – and by the look on Draco’s face he was succeeding. By the end, Draco had tears in his eyes and was biting his lip not to scream.
An hour later, Harry had an entirely different set of problems on his mind – he presented his proposal of employing Draco Malfoy, as his assistant, to his boss, and he thought it was going well, until the Chief announced that before he could make a decision, he needed to talk to Ron. Harry knew that, since Ron and him were partners, Ron’s opinion of Draco might be a potential issue, but he was hoping the Chief wouldn’t directly involve him in the process. But he did, and now Harry was sitting in his office panicking – with Ron’s attitude there was no way this was going to work out. He was just starting to go through every other potential job for Draco, when the door banged open and Ron marched inside furious.
‘Draco, calm down. It’s supposed to be there. I know it’s disgusting, but that’s how Muggle train toilets work. Everything just goes through the hole onto the tracks.’
By the end of the evening, it seemed like Draco was accepted into the Weasley clan completely. They left the Burrow well fed, with a box of Molly’s cookies and an invitation for tea for Narcissa, Draco clutching not one, but two character reference letters (Arthur insisted that since everyone knew of their relationship by now, it would look better if he was to write one along with Hermione).
‘Oh, my father had nothing to do with this.’ Malfoy smiled wickedly. ‘I volunteered to be on the case. Besides, nobody else seemed willing to go against their precious Chosen One, so the Chief gladly gave this case to me. You see, I never liked you, and now at least nobody can accuse me of holding on to old grudges – after all, once you’re found guilty of murdering your own friend, you won’t be so cherished anymore…’
for all he did in his life, was to take three small steps forward and shut the door behind him. Then, it would be all over. But he couldn’t do it – he didn’t know what was keeping him in place, it was like a force from behind him that was relentlessly pulling him back any time he tried to take a step, but he had no idea where the force came from. In fact, he didn’t know where he was or how he got there, he didn’t register anything happening around him at all – there was just impenetrable darkness, deafening silence, and that one, small, barely visible point of light that was calling for him. So he tried, again and again and again, to walk towards it, to vanish into nothingness, but something was stopping him every time.
- Hi Neville, is Ron there? – Harry tried to be as calm as possible, despite his heart practically crushing his ribs.
‘Either way: it makes no difference now. If they wouldn’t have said what they said, someone else would. My father would, to be precise. And then, he would be in even more trouble. So, all in all, it’s a good thing you did it – if you hadn’t, Lucius would have said everything, would get a lesser sentence for cooperation and I would be an orphan, or dead, the minute he got out.’
Draco knew that there was a way out of this – he almost tried it once before, and he could just as well try now. But something was stopping him – something lurking on the outskirts of his memory, too far away to grasp it, but definitely there. He knew that he couldn’t reach for that razor again, that it would be a wrong thing to do. That somehow, for some unidentifiable reason, it was better to just ignore Potter completely and wait for this whole thing to pass.
‘Draco, you’re doing the dishes tonight!’ Harry joked when he opened the door. By the expression on his face, Draco didn’t find it amusing.
- I don’t even know if it’s what it is! All I know now is that I realized that my feelings for him have changed. I don’t hate him and I just want to know what it is I’m feeling. So, if you can find it in yourself to give me some advice on how to talk to him, I would appreciate it. But if not, I will just go to Hermione, she always has some sound advice. – Potter sounded defeated.
‘No, I don’t have that.’ Potter said, disappointed. ‘But I might recruit some trainee to compile a list! Merlin, this is exciting, I need to talk to Ron about this!’ He jumped to his feet. Suddenly, it occurred to Draco how close to each other they were sitting – he felt a chilly breeze lick his side where it has been pressed against Potter.
‘Maybe you’re right. But I’m still not completely convinced everyone will be as pleasant as the Weasleys.’
‘I might hate you, Draco, but not that much. I knew you were hurting and using this against you, for whatever reason, would be going way too far.’ Draco didn’t know what happened, but hearing Potter use his first name did something to him. Before he knew it, he was looking directly into Potter’s eyes with what he could only think of as gratitude painted all over his face. He vaguely registered his father’s voice in his head reminding him that he was a Malfoy and Malfoys don’t do this sort of thing.
On his end, Draco was equally as shocked, although he quickly composed himself to hide it. There was absolutely no reason to antagonise Harry right now with snarky questions. He smiled unsurely and waited for a reaction. To his relief Harry smiled back. Draco pulled back and sat, once again, at the foot of the bed, facing Harry.
- Well, it is Malfoy. But… - He decided to tell them both the whole truth. It wouldn’t be fair to force Hermione to keep secrets from her boyfriend for him, and besides, Ron might actually have some good insights, if he managed not to blow up like he often did.
‘I assure you, madame, that the Ministry has rounded up all the former Death Eaters and sent them to Azkaban. Or, at least all those who would still be alive today.’ Ron stated firmly, but there was an idea suddenly forming in his mind. ‘But I will go look for that mysterious stranger and confirm myself, you have my word for it. After all, it’s better to be safe than sorry, don’t you think? If our information was not correct and those young boys were in fact only trying to protect our community from any harm, it’s all the better for me to go and get that Death Eater locked up.’ He smiled, hoping the elderly witch would take his bait. He realized that if the snatchers were using someone as a stand-in for a Death Eater, it would most likely be a member of their group – and that seemed like his best bet to catch them.
- Don’t call him a wanker, please. It makes me uncomfortable. Besides, I don’t know if I’m falling for him. It’s not that simple.
‘Something happened.’ Draco was suddenly petrified with fear. Potter was going to tell Weasley all about his state…
we have sex though? I mean, have you thought about it? Ever?’ Was that hope or fear? Harry couldn’t decipher.
‘I was. I still am. He made a pretty convincing case for himself. And the fact that we managed to catch the rest of the group, which I’m sure is guilty, with his help, only makes me believe it more.’
. It has just been announced that Lucius Malfoy has been employed as a high-ranking official in the Department of Magical Law Enforcement.
‘What about me interests the Auror Office now?’ Malfoy was still completely unbothered by the sudden reunion as he took a hit from his clearly-not-cigarette and groaned with pleasure. ‘As you can see, I’m not bothering anyone.’
Harry knew Draco was right. He needed to talk to Hermione and the sooner he did that, the better. His discussion with Draco was eating at him for half the night. Somehow he came to terms with the fact that Malfoy was in fact right about Harry wanting to relinquish control over himself to someone, but he still wasn’t all that convinced it was normal and healthy. And on top of that there was still the question of his newfound attitude towards Draco. So far, the revelations provided only served to send his brain into more of a spin than before, not ease any of his concerns. He decided that he’ll try to talk to Hermione in private after lunch.
Draco and Harry spent their first post-Hogwarts weekend locked inside Grimmauld Place 12, blissfully ignorant to the world around them, apart from a one-time visit to a nearby café for lunch on Saturday. Sunday night, after dark, they packed their essentials, threw Harry’s invisibility cloak over them, locked the door with every protective enchantment that came to mind and went on to apparate outside the gates of Malfoy Manor. Standing there, Harry concluded that it was a rather magnificent house and it really made a lasting impression, if one was there on their own free will and not being dragged in by a hoard of snatchers, possibly being led to their death.
The room looked like it has just been cleaned for someone to come in – there was not even a speckle of dust on any of the surfaces, the large bed was covered in plum-coloured satin bedding, and the heavy, black velvet curtains were pushed aside, revealing an enormous arched window. Harry looked around: he was expecting ornate furniture and delicate materials, but to his surprise most of the walls, apart from the one behind the headboard, were bare and all of Draco’s furniture was very minimalistic, like someone just carved it out of black walnut and not even bothered to put a coat of paint on it. Only the chandelier looked expensive and almost baroque, glistening with hundreds of crystals in the light casted by their wands.
Draco closed his eyes. He felt Harry’s trembling hands pull down his sweatpants and stroking his length hesitantly.
Harry stormed off, leaving still crying Hermione with Ron. He couldn’t get his body to stop shaking. He needed air.
- I told him I didn’t know. I said I found some child I didn’t recognize barely conscious in the corridor while I was coming back from the library and I decided it was better to come see Slughorn about it than Madame Pomfrey.
His eyes fell to the nightstand beside Malfoy’s bed. In the pale moonlight he could just about decipher what was written on the cover of a book Malfoy’s been reading lately – “Practical use of advance medical potions”. He decided that anything would be better than staring at the ceiling, so he grabbed the book, whispered “Lumos” and began skimming it. He was almost halfway through the book when he discovered a chapter entitled “Anxiety and Insomnia Relief”. It peaked his interest. He read through the list of Potions carefully, although if he was honest with himself he didn’t really understand much. The only name he recognized was Draught of Peace, although he didn’t quite remember where he heard about it.
- Because I live with him, everyone but us is asleep, and if he’s found stone cold in our room, it’s going to look like I poisoned him! – His patience was running low. There was a literal life-and-death situation and his bloody supposed friends were more keen on discussing possible criminal repercussions than helping! – Guys, can either of you go now? Please? I’ll stay with Potter just to monitor what’s going on.
Ron wasn’t sure if his conclusion that he didn’t, in fact, stumble onto Malfoy’s path, made him relieved or worried – there was some hope in him that maybe if it in fact was Draco, there would be a chance for Harry to snap out of his mourning. But that wasn’t possible – the longer Ron looked at the person, the more he was sure that if he saw his left forearm (still invisible to him, buried in the tall weeds) there would be no Dark Mark there.
- I don’t know, honestly. – Harry looked down. – I’m not okay with what you two have done. You both told me I have nothing to worry about, and yet tonight proved otherwise. I can’t go on knowing that anytime we have a disagreement you may end up in his bed, you know? And not only that, but you might also return from said bed sliced in half! What is that thing on your back anyway?
It would be a perfect start to their adult life together, if not for what happened 3 days after they read the letter from Draco’s mother. They were sitting in the Great Hall at breakfast, enjoying their free time, when a large spotted owl landed in front of Draco. He took the envelope it was carrying and opened the letter. As soon as he recognized the handwriting, Draco cursed out loud. It was from his father. And judging by the length of the parchment, he wasn’t happy.
- You… more… inside… - it was almost indistinguishable between moans. Draco slipped his tongue inside, hardening rapidly. He knew that if they went on like that, with Harry begging him for more, he wouldn’t be able to control himself. He tried to shake it off, but the lust and greed was building in him too fast. Draco just hoped Harry would finish before he reached the point when he couldn’t stop himself.
‘Your drinking aside, how did I cause this? It was Shacklebolt who stuck you in here with this git.’
, Weasley. I’ve seen people crack during questioning. People who haven’t said a single word otherwise.’
It was almost nightfall when Draco was escorted through the corridors of Azkaban to his father’s cell. When the iron door shut behind him, he shivered – even without the dementors there, it was the last place he ever wanted to find himself in.
- Oh, of course, because the world revolves around your sun-sized arse! – Where the bloody hell did the arse comment came from?! He really needs to restrain himself sometimes.
So far, the day has been uneventful. Harry and Draco were stuck in the office catching up on paperwork, unbothered by anyone. Harry suspected that the news of Draco Malfoy working with him hasn’t spread yet, since Ron was on assignment with Neville since the break of dawn, and he was thankful that him and Draco were left alone – that way he could look up at the blonde from time to time, revelling in memories of last night and admiring how hot Draco looked all concentrated and intense. Harry found it weird how he never before seemed to register that the man was actually
- WHAT?! – Few birds that were still looking for worms on the ground took off startled by Draco’s scream.
- No, it’s ok. I would’ve assumed the same if I was in your place. – That was a lie, but Draco decided to pretend to not be offended. He was quickly learning that without the kindness of strangers he wasn’t going to survive. – It’s just that I, uh, came to London last night and I had no money and nowhere to go and Henry here was gracious enough to help.
The thought of house elves was like a sharp pain. All of a sudden he remembered Dobby dying in his arms not even a year prior and his eyes started to sting. God damn, this was no time for crying! He barely managed to compose himself, but as soon as he felt strong enough to walk again, the memory of empty Grimmauld Place 12 ended up in his head. He didn’t know why, but somehow it was even worse than what happened to Dobby. Maybe because he didn’t have a clue what happened to Kreacher?
‘Ok, maybe.’ Harry sighed in resignation. ‘Let’s assume for now you’re telling the truth. But how do I find those guys?’
- Yeah. – Nott chimed in. – Don’t get us wrong, he still can be an arsehole sometimes, but that’s all in good fun between us. We like insulting each other just for the heck of it, it’s just how we act, and Draco sometimes cuts a little too deep with his insults, but it’s not malicious. He just has a very dark sense of humour, even by Slytherin standards. Anyway, it’s always just little verbal jabs at each other, and it’s only between us four, he stopped bothering other people since we came back. Sit with us? It doesn’t seem like you’re exactly welcome at the Gryffindor table right now. – Harry noticed they entered the Great Hall and all eyes were on The Chosen One accompanied by a group of Slytherins. Without his boyfriend, no least.
‘Oh, well, ok. So I’ll escort Malfoy down to the courtroom, we’ll get this done, and we’ll go back to my place to wait for the rest to be dealt with. Can either of you message me when the other depositions are done at least?’ Harry gave up. There was no way they were going to let him take part in the other depositions.
Harry felt Draco kissing him slowly and gently, moving his hands down Harry’s body. He hardened at the anticipation. His breath hitched when he felt Draco’s fingers stroking him through his trousers. He bit his lower lip. Draco’s hand slowly moved inside his pants, his fingers delicately brushing his length. Harry let out a small moan. Draco curled his fingers around him.
- So last night we talked. For a long time. – He swiftly omitted the “nearly killing himself and being saved by Draco Malfoy” part. There would be time for that later. – And Draco made me realize some things about myself.
, when they were leaving Grimmauld Place), Harry was tasked with finding a conductor and purchasing the tickets. He ordered Draco and his mother to stay put in their seats and went on to look for the conductor. When he returned, he found Narcissa looking mesmerized by her surroundings, while Draco was sitting on the edge of his seat, utterly uncomfortable.
I hope you'll enjoy what I've come up with :) There is going to be more Ron, Hermione and the others later in case you wondered!
- SHUT UP! – Harry lost all control over himself. He didn’t know how, but suddenly he was being held back by Draco and Neville, while Hermione was wrestling Ron trying to keep him behind their table. – One more word, Wesley, and you’ll regret it for the rest of your life… - he didn’t like his own tone of voice. He never threatened Ron like that, but there was nothing else he could do. All he felt was pure rage. The shock of what came out of Harry’s mouth seemed to calm Ron down just enough to keep him from struggling against Hermione.
‘You said so yourself, Minister, I have to keep an eye on him until he gives us his side of the story.’
‘You’re in a hospital, you’ve been attacked by whatever was guarding the room back at the Manor – we don’t know what happened, Ron and Neville only said that you opened the door using your blood and that it looked like something possessed you – you were completely out of it, trying to go into the room. Neville had to hold you back the entire time.’
Ron knew he needed to talk to Harry as soon as possible and apologize for his behaviour – he looked up and opened his mouth to say all those things he just realized, but the door opened and Malfoy came back.
And once again, all those who considered themselves the “non-Slytherin” camp seemed to rally behind Harry. He knew it was sweet of them and they only meant to show him their support, but it was exactly what he hoped to avoid staying in London during the summer. By nightfall, he received so many pats on the back, well wishes (as if he was dying, he realized bitterly) and pieces of advice along the lines of “Don’t pay attention” and “Don’t worry about those gits” that he was thoroughly sick to his stomach. He could muster only enough energy to half-ass the remainder of his DADA homework and drag himself into the shower before collapsing onto his bed utterly discouraged with the world around him.
‘From the moment you’ve been made a Death Eater until the end of the war – for now.’ Draco calmed down slightly and reached for his wand. ‘I’m sorry, Mr. Malfoy, but the proper procedure is for someone else to extract the memories. It can more painful than usually, depending on the person that performs the spell, and I’m sorry for that, but we cannot risk any tampering with evidence. Mr. Potter, would you be willing to do it?’
‘I do, Minister. But what do we do now? Whatever else I give you is going to have the same effect – like I told you, I knew nothing about the hidden storage, so all the rest of my memories will be equally useless.’ His lips were pressed into a thin line.
‘I have to, Harry. He’ll never get off your case if I don’t do this. Me, I couldn’t care less what he thinks, but I see this is eating you alive.’ He looked back at Ron. ‘So what’s it gonna be, Weasley? You in or out?’
Ever since they came back from work, Draco couldn’t shake the feeling something was wrong. It was half past nine when he finally gathered enough courage to ask.
- Of course I do. You’re the most beautiful person I know. You don’t need to concern yourself with my needs, baby, take all the time you need.
- If someone told me I’ll be saying this even a year ago, I’d laugh… - Ron looked up from his porridge. – But I completely agree with Pansy on this one. You two are worse than my parents!
year was wondering what was going on with Potter and Malfoy. It was Friday by now, and Potter was nowhere to be found since Wednesday morning – nobody has seen him in classes or the Great Hall and the door to his room was permanently shut. Malfoy didn’t seem like he was doing well either – he was sitting in the back staring blankly at the wall during every lesson, seemingly oblivious to the world around him. Even while being yelled at by McGonagall for failing to turn in his essay on safety procedures in human transfiguration, he didn’t react.
‘I’m sure either of them would be happy to do it. They’re supportive of us, you know it. Ron has even converted Ginny to our side and believe me, that couldn’t have been easy.’
- Actually, guys, I think you’re wrong… - Pansy spoke for the first time in a while. – I’ve seen him react like that once.
Also, it's getting a little darker as we go along, so I think I'm just going to change the rating to Explicit at this point.
‘Hydrogen peroxide. It’s an antiseptic, it’s what Muggles put on cuts and scrapes so that they don’t get infected.’ He walked to the bathroom and came back holding a small, white bottle. ‘There you go. Pour some on a cloth and stick it to your lip.’ Draco did as instructed and winced.
‘Maybe…’ Harry laughed. ‘And I never said I wasn’t gay, you just assumed it because you know I’ve slept with women.’
year common room, so there was no painting to interact with) and practically blasted inside. He looked at all the people inside, glaring daggers at anyone who dared to look back at him.
. Once again, he has single-handedly managed to fuck things up for Harry. Why did he have to come tonight? It was past midnight already and he has a wife and a child, why would he decide it was a good time to fill Shacklebolt’s instruction? Harry never counted on anything happening between him and Draco, he wasn’t stupid, but if Ron hadn’t decided he needed to bring the wand back tonight, maybe Harry would have a chance to at least make those images, that were coming to his head any time he looked at Draco, a reality, just for one night. But now it was over – Draco was in the shower, clearly already regretting what had happened between them, and Harry knew there would be no other chance. They weren’t going to be living together for much longer, and once Draco was out of his apartment, no matter if he decided to take Harry up on his offer to give him keys to Grimmauld Place, it wasn’t like they were close enough to justify doing anything ever again.
- You’re breaking up with me because you LOVE ME? That’s the stupidest thing I have ever heard! – Harry knew from the moment Draco first spoke that this was what the conversation was going to be, but that didn’t stop the anger. He was too exhausted to fight it. – You can’t do this to me right now! It makes no sense!
- No, I won’t. You’re in no position to tell me what to do. – Harry thought he saw Ron chuckle bitterly behind Dean’s back. – You’re both the same sort. No wonder you ended up whatever you two are. And to think I would’ve never imagined you of all people ending up with a Death Eater! Tell me, Potter, how does it feel to look at that thing on him every night when you know what his lot did? Or is it actually a turn on for you? You like looking at it? That what gets you off faster?
‘There is nothing else… Please… I’ll do whatever…’ Through his foggy brain, Draco knew he had to do something to convince Potter to bring him the drugs, but he didn’t know what might change his stance. ‘I’ll have sex with you…’ It just came out. Draco didn’t even realize what he said before he registered Potter’s shocked expression.
- Good to know. – Draco smiled. – We both need some time to rest though, but if you want any more fun tonight, I’ll be up for it later.
‘You’re crossing the line here, mate…’ Ron’s voice sounded a little threatening. ‘Anyway, I wanted to come here and tell you we took the ‘magic in front of a Muggle’ cases from the police and we’re monitoring this ourselves, and now that I’ve done it, I’m leaving.’
Regardless of the fact that Harry Potter was now apparently both the reason (well, one of the reasons) for Draco’s failed suicide attempt, as well as the reason for him not to try it again, Draco was firm on ignoring Potter for the sake of his own (incredibly fragile, it appeared) mental stability. On his part, Harry didn’t look like he was too keen on even making conversation either.
‘So we need to wait until I start bleeding like a normal person?’ Draco was as pale as Neville at this point.
‘We think we know what’s wrong with your arm.’ Hermione was visibly shaken. ‘There is a way to fix this, but it’s
‘I told you something’s going to go down. I knew it!’ Harry was as angry as Ron now. ‘How is he anyway? Still a pompous prick?’
- Alone? Fine by me! At least I won’t have a delusional deviant as a friend! Go ahead, leave and get your new boyfriend to cut you up to get you off or something! See if I care!
- There aren’t. And I can’t go on like this, I haven’t eaten anything besides bread for days now, I can’t do it any longer.
Somehow (Harry failed to see the logic behind this particular chain reaction) it seemed that by the end of the day all was back to the state of affairs from before the War – it was once again Slytherin vs everyone else, and it seemed like the whole castle was now taking part in the division. Snide comments, that subsided since term started, were now back in full force, along with the pushing and shoving, booing after particularly vocal members of each house ensued, and Slytherins wasted no time in coming up with several degrading chants intended to let the whole student body know Harry Potter was gay for Draco Malfoy.
‘Something came for you an hour ago.’ Draco didn’t even look at him, but those the first words he spoke in nearly two weeks and Harry felt a pure, warm sensation spreading through him. He unrolled the parchment and gasped.
dangerous. And painful. And it needs assistance from someone else, which in your case poses a massive problem…’
The rest of them followed. When they gathered in Ron’s and Neville’s office, there was a pensive already on one of the desks. It was bigger than the one in Hogwarts and seemed older. Kingsley gestured for them to gather around and soon they were falling down to face Draco’s history.
It was just Malfoy’s luck that barely 30 seconds after that thought came to him, when he looked at the dorm room arrangements posted on the board in the common room, he saw “Malfoy, Draco Lucius” next to “Potter, Harry James” in big, scarlet (because, of course, she had to favour bloody Gryffindors yet again!) letters on the list. He sneered again. It was his bloody luck.
He hated feeling this way. He knew it’s not normal, he knew he should be happy all of the darkness was behind him now and he knew that he should join in on the collective sigh of relief the wizarding world breathed. But he couldn’t and didn’t. And in those rare moments he managed not to blame himself, he blamed Voldemort and his Death Eaters. And now, one of those same Death Eaters that caused his life to be what it was, was sitting there, like nothing ever happened, in his own room, in his only true home ever, every bloody night. If his hatred was even possible to qualify, he hated Malfoy most of them all – for the fact that he got out without so much as a scratch on his criminal record (“minor my ass” Harry muttered under his breath) and for the fact that the fucking wanker had the AUDACITY to show his slime-y face back.
– his brain reminded him of what Potter said. Yeah, like he was ever going to have sex again after what being Yasmine put him through. No, this was the last thing he wanted. He shook his head. It was no use opening that particular can of worms, he was feeling bad enough already. He was feeling strangely proud of his ability to compartmentalize his struggles – if he wasn’t able to put everything he ever went through into neat little boxes and shove them to the very bottom of his brain, he wouldn’t have survived this long. Especially since all he could do otherwise was to dwell on them over and over again, because there wasn’t anybody to even talk it all through with. Like a boomerang, the word
‘No. There’s no need. How I’m feeling will kill me on its own.’ Draco was forcing himself not to look at Harry.
‘Well, I suppose…’ She hesitated. ‘Frankly, Harry, I’m still not convinced about all of this, but then again, I don’t really know Draco or his mother…’
‘Mate, you know it’s not your fault. Maybe if we can’t convince you, someone with an outside perspective will?’ Ron tried to support Hermione, but it was half-hearted.
‘…but you’re afraid how would it look? You being with Draco, while is father is in Azkaban and I’ve been accused, and hunting down what was considered our side?’ Harry had to admit it, Narcissa was really a marvellous psychologist.
‘Why?’ Draco started to get scared himself – what if Harry didn’t want Weasley to know what they did the night before? What if he regretted it? ‘You don’t want him to know what we are? Or is it because of what I used to do?’
- Wait, you blacked out from pain and still wanted more? – Ron was staring at Draco like he was crazy. – Jesus, Malfoy, you’re the most masochistic person I know…
Then, at the very edge of the grounds, they all stopped and turned around to look at the castle for the last time. They were standing in complete silence, looking at their home of the last 8 years and the sea of students still pouring out of the entrance. Suddenly, Draco grabbed Harry’s hand and turned to him.
By Monday it seemed like the whole school knew Potter and Malfoy were an item. Harry didn’t mind it in itself, but what was a little unnerving, was the fact that Ron knew the specific character of their relationship and given how he reacted, he might tell everyone. And for that, Harry just wasn’t ready yet. He didn’t know how Draco felt about it though – they didn’t discuss anything yet, they spent the afternoon merging their beds together (which was a task in itself, since apparently both of them had previously focused their energy on spells useful in duelling and no energy whatsoever was invested into household-related charms). By nightfall they were both exhausted – they had to put out two separate fires, then they accidentally vanished the somehow-king-sized-now bed completely (what else they were trying to achieve after their single ones were miraculously merged, Harry didn’t seem to recall), before finally giving in (not without pouting on Draco’s part) and enlisting Hermione to help.
‘What?!’ Ron was shaking his head. ‘No, there is NO way I’m agreeing to this! She can’t be locked up somewhere with this lunatic!’
- Don’t you dare… - Harry wasn’t sure how it was possible, but Draco was even paler than usual as he stood up addressing Dean.
Upon entering the living room he saw that Malfoy was already (or still?) up, but he decided the best course of action was to ignore him – he didn’t want to say anything about last night and he sure as hell didn’t want anything else to happen between them right now. He made himself a cup of black coffee, threw four teaspoons of sugar in it and took a sip. It was atrocious – since when did he drink black coffee anyway? And since when did he use sugar at all? Somehow, irrationally, his anger at Malfoy grew. Before he could figure out where it came from, however, or before he even sobered up enough to address the question, there was a metallic jiggle at the door and Ron came into the apartment.
- no, this was just an unfortunate coincidence, it had nothing to do with the fact that it was Potter, at this point anyone would’ve had the same effect). He sighed, got up and locked himself in the bathroom. Once again, he wished he had his wand – a silencing charm would be a godsent right now. Well, he’ll just have to control himself. He could do that – it’s not like it was the first time he got himself off in Potter’s shower, and so far he managed to stay silent.
Malfoy’s ploy to get information out of his father was a success, but Ron wasn’t entirely happy – the conversation they had back in Harry’s living room was still weighing on him, and now that there were no distractions in the form of suspecting Malfoy of doing anything shady (because even Ron had to admit he had been wrong multiple times about him by this point), or just purely hating the git, he realized he had to do some self-reflecting if his friendship with Harry was to survive – and he was very much set on making sure it would. So he sat there, in the office he shared with Neville, waiting for Malfoy to return from Azkaban, and started analysing why was it that he actually had that much of a problem with Harry’s new partner. Days ago, the answer would’ve been easy – he hated him and he didn’t trust him. But now, that the suspicions have been eased and Ron actually saw where Malfoy’s behaviour came from, neither of those seemed like viable options: for one, there was no reason not to trust him, and for the other, it was hard to hate him as much as Ron used to when you knew what kind of household he grew up in. Ron really didn’t like the thought, but he had to admit that if his parents were like Malfoy’s, he too would most likely turn out a miserable, bullying arsehole. And to see his reaction to what they’ve all witnessed in the pensive made Ron believe that there were in fact some human instincts and emotions inside Malfoy, it was just that they were buried by a mountain of insufferable coping mechanisms.
‘Wizards normally don’t, but there is a chance for you if we implement Muggle technology…’ Hermione hesitated when she saw the confused expression on their faces. ‘It says in the books that the only way to reverse the damage is to replenish your blood with someone else’s. They say it’s best to use someone that loves you since this is the most positive feeling in itself and the people that love you tend to see the best in you.’
! This is a death trap! Why would they let people on a train that has holes?! We’re all going to die!’ They were lucky it was only them in the compartment, because Draco was screaming at this point.
Ok, so Ron is an arsehole clearly (at least for now, haha), because we need things to not be just susnhine and roses all the time and I'm a proud Slytherin to the core, in case that is not obvious by now.
They spent the evening in the kitchen, drinking wine and taking like they’ve all been friends for years, like the war never happened. Harry felt safe and happy, laughing along with Draco and his mother, demanding compromising stories from Draco’s childhood that made his boyfriend turn a rather alarming shade of tomato red and stomp off pretending to be mad.
For the first time in weeks, Draco woke up feeling completely serene, almost surreally so. He laid there for a while, brushing his fingers through Harry’s hair, feeling almost as if they were an actual couple. And it didn’t even matter now that they weren’t – the room was completely silent apart from the sound of Harry’s breathing, and for once he was happy just being there. He thought that if this is what his last night’s decisions led him, maybe he should just take what life throws at him instead of trying to fight it and go against it. He smiled to himself, content with his newfound outlook on life.
‘Don’t get any ideas. I may think you’re innocent and just trying to help, but Ron doesn’t trust you. Now, are we doing this?’
‘You and me, tonight. Neutral ground, let’s say Grimmauld Place, if Harry’s ok with it. It can be just us, or you can bring Longbottom and I’ll bring Harry. Veritaserum. Both of us drink it and we hammer it all out. After that, you lay off us.’
- You see, you and Hermione are the only ones that know what’s really going on between me and Draco. The rest only knows we’re together. So… - Harry hesitated. – So I would be thankful if you could just keep the details to yourself.
- It was Ron’s fault. – Harry was still looking at his (completely full, despite dinner going on for 10 minutes by then) plate.
‘Why are you going on about this? I don’t know what happened! I wasn’t there! And why does it have to be you investigating this case anyway, aren’t there more Aurors? Or is your father still hellbent on making me as miserable as possible after all the shit he’s already pulled telling everyone something happened during the war?’
- Slow down, let’s take this one by one. As for where you go, you have two options – you either find a spot on the street or knock on doors asking if they’ll take you in. They take a cut of what you earn, but it’s safer and usually you get better clients there.
‘I don’t know. I’ve started analysing my sexuality ever since you asked me and I’m growing curious.’ WHY on Earth would he say that?! Even drunk Harry thought it was a bad idea.
‘Well, that night, before Ron showed up…’ Harry was suddenly feeling embarrassed – what if Draco rejected him? ‘I thought we were going further with this. I mean, not ahead of time, it wasn’t planned, but in that moment... you know.’
- I’m sorry… I came… so fast… - It was still difficult to figure out what Harry was saying through the laboured breathing.
- No, no, it’s not that. I’m just not ready yet to explain it to everyone. After how Ron reacted, I think there would be at least several more attitudes like that and I’m still in the process of figuring all of this for myself. Are you ok with this?
- Now, don’t panic. There’s nothing between me and Theo. We were just drunk one night and it sort of happened and trust me, we both regret it. We couldn’t look at each other for weeks. And besides, that was almost two years ago. Anyway, you said you were worried about something else?
‘There is. That’s why I said we need Muggle technology. Muggles do this thing called transfusion where they put someone else’s blood in you. Of course, it’s complicated, you need to take blood types into account…’ She hesitated. ‘And we don’t know what type of outcome this would have on wizard blood since there is also magical abilities to be considered… Plus, the physiology is different, so I’m not sure if the blood type issue still applies there… And you haven’t lost any blood…’
‘WHAT?!’ Ron looked utterly shocked and Neville almost fell over. Harry’s face was a mixture of fury and horror.
- I probably shouldn’t tell you this, but she wasn’t lying for you. She lied to get back to the castle and find me, she knew the only way she was going back was if you were dead and this was a victory parade.
It was two days later when Weasley showed up in Potter’s apartment. Both of them were now sitting in the kitchen arguing in hushed voices, glancing over at Draco, who was sitting on the couch going over Potter’s paperwork for the tenth time. Even though the two ex-Gryffindors were trying to be as quiet as possible, he overheard their conversation.
If he was honest with himself, Draco would see that his attitude towards Potter has changed. The hatred he was so used to was all gone and he’d been seeing it out of sheer stubbornness. It was almost like he convinced himself he hated Potter, when in fact the more time went by since the end of the war, the more he grew to care for him. He first noticed that during the summer, Potter was nowhere to be found. It was odd at first, but deep down, beneath all the loathing he thought he felt, he slowly started to realize how it must feel like with all the unwanted attention. After all, he was experiencing the same thing, even if for entirely different reasons. And if his instinct was correct, that would mean Potter never wanted any of that “glory” and “recognition”. And that, in turn, meant that he must be deep in the pits of hell by now.
- It’s ok, I know, we talked about it. – Harry was trying very hard no keep it casual next to Nott. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Nott visibly shaken. – Continue on, please.
That same night, on the other side of the invisible boarder that ran through the Leaky Cauldron, Harry Potter was sitting in his office in the Ministry of Magic. He was reading through the Malfoy family file. He knew Lucius and Narcissa were sentenced to life in Azkaban, rightfully so, but ever since their son, Draco, was declared innocent, Harry was wondering what was going to happen to him. Everyone in the wizarding world knew the Malfoy’s blew their fortune on what was widely perceived as a suicide mission that was trying to dispute all the charges against them. That meant, Harry concluded, that Draco had nothing. Harry was turning page after page trying to find some sort of clue as to where his former arch-nemesis might be right now. Nobody has seen him since he left the Ministry right after his parents were sentenced and Harry had a gut feeling this didn’t mean any good. Bellatrix and her husband were dead, all their assets were seized, and Harry couldn’t imagine the only other family Draco had left – Tonks’ parents – would take him in. The only other place Draco might have gone was Grimmauld Place 12, since it was a Black family home, but it belonged to Harry, and there was no way anyone besides him, Ron and Hermione would be able to enter. He shook his head. Why was he stressing over this? It was not like he cared about Malfoy, after all they’ve been enemies ever since they met.
‘I don’t know. I mean, I have no idea if what I thought was real or where it came from, but I thought I was completely alone – that Harry died, and my parents, and everyone hated me. Please, Granger, tell me it wasn’t real…’ Suddenly, he was crying.
- RON! – Hermione was shocked. – You can’t say that! Obviously something happened, they’re both distraught and someone needs to do something before it’s too late! Are you sure you have tried everything?
‘Don’t ask me how it works, I have never studied engineering, so I haven’t a clue. But it does and it’s pretty fast, by Muggle standards.’
on the kitchen floor. By the time Potter woke up, he couldn’t take it anymore. He needed something, anything, to make it all go away. He briefly contemplated running away, just for the night, just to get to his stash of herbs left in Scotland to bring them back, but he realized that was not possible, not with all the protective enchantments surrounding the apartment. So, through all the pain and agony that filled his whole body, he tried to devise some other plan to just get some relief. When he saw, like through a thick fog, Potter standing above him, he knew he was a lost cause.
‘Oh, Draco…’ Harry forced Draco’s chin up. ‘If it’s just about the money, you don’t need to worry about this. I told you, I have some of my own, and we have a decent place to live in London, so we’ll manage. Maybe we won’t be able to go on lavish vacations every year, but it’s not like we’re going to be starving. And I have no problem with supporting us both, not even if it was permanent. You’ll be an excellent healer – you’ve been at the top of the class in Potions for all of Hogwarts, your N.E.W.Ts are excellent and you have one of the best charmwork I have ever seen. Honestly, you could give Hermione a run for her money and that’s all talent – I haven’t seen you practice anything since I’ve known you.’
‘Why not? The sooner you get this done, the sooner I’m out of here. And you’re clearly not smart enough to do it on your own.’
- Oh, really? Is that all? It’s pretty convenient he “understood” – Ron’s air quotes infuriated Harry – how you feel. Funny he’s the only one while none of your real friends picked up on it, isn’t it?
- But-but why? – Harry was shaken. He looked up at his boyfriend only to find him with a determined and rather cold expression. His heart sank.
- Oh God, how do I explain it if you haven’t realized this by yourself already…? – Draco was talking more to himself now than he did to Harry. – Ok, I’m just going to say this, but you have to promise me that you will not freak out and you will allow me to explain this as well as I can before you come to any rash conclusions, ok? Can you do that for me?
years again. It was all back to “Slytherin vs the rest” and people were looking up to me again, looking for me to be some sort of leader in this crusade against you and your housemates. And I started to panic and spiral again, that was the last thing I wanted coming back! I just wanted to be left alone for once, not to have “supporters”, not to even be looked at. – Harry realized he was starting to cry. He knew it was humiliating and stupid, but he couldn’t stop himself. – God, you must thing I’m a freak… Who doesn’t want to be the one in charge? Normal people look for this kind of recognition their whole lives, and I’m being handed all that and I don’t want it. Pathetic. – He couldn’t stop crying and talking.
- God… yes… I can’t… - Harry slammed his fist into the shower wall. God, that sight was irresistible. – Fuck… fuck… Draco… please… more…
- I’ve seen him. He’s in Muggle London and he’s not doing so good. He… - Harry hesitated. He didn’t know how to tell Ron exactly how bad was Malfoy’s situation without actually telling him what really happened. – he’s practically starving to death.
‘That is it, I’m quitting!’ He huffed sitting down. ‘I am quitting and there is no changing my mind!’
I'm sorry it took so long - I've been out of social isolation and back to working from the office instead from my own couch for the past week, so I'm having much less time to write and update than I used to. I'll try my best to update more regularly (although, in all fairness, that depends on how quickly the absolute tons of paperwork on my desk dissappear - and they seem to be sentient and grow on their own accord). I hope you forgive me!
- Ok, so here it goes. As far as I can tell, if I’m correct, and I’ve never been wrong before, you have several traits of a sub. – Draco’s brain was screaming “this is all wrong, you have no right to tell him, he needs to realise it for himself!”, but it was already done. There was nothing, short of Obliviating Harry, he could do now.
‘Not exactly. From what I understand, the memories aren’t stored in the blood exactly – it’s more related to the soul. So blood is just a ‘carrier’ for the soul to leak out of your body in this case. And since you didn’t actually bleed at all, your whole soul should still be inside, untouched. What came out was the traces of dark magic that form the dark mark. It kind of acts as a barrier.’
‘Because it’s Malfoy! He clearly cannot stay out of trouble and it’s rubbing off on you! You’re an Auror, Harry, you should be catching Death Eaters, not defending them! Ever since he came back you’re not yourself! You haven’t been in the office for months…’
Harry thought he understood now what Draco meant when he told him what amazing sex was supposed to feel like, but when he felt the blonde’s cock hit that one sweet spot, deep inside of him, he knew that up until this point he understood nothing. The world around him froze, there was no time or space anymore, there was nothing going on in his own brain even, besides the feeling of exploding into a million tiny pieces as he came, painting his chest and stomach in long, white arcs. Behind him, he heard Draco’s long, low moan, and felt his release filling him up, making him feel like for a fraction of a second he was back to being a whole person again, before melting into nothingness completely.
- No, I like working with you. I was just scared I won’t have anybody to work with. Pansy scares me, I’d rather avoid her.
‘I think we are.’ Narcissa stood up before Draco had a chance to object to the notion that he might want to live amongst Muggles.
‘Mr. Potter, can you hear me? Mr. Potter!’ Harry was too weak to answer. He tried to do something to indicate that he knew what was going on around him, but to no result.
Draco hovered over Harry and forced Slughorn’s antidote down his throat. It took a couple of seconds for Potter (and just like that, Draco slipped back to his old, guarded self, simply because someone else was in the room) to start coughing and wheezing.
There was a sudden rumble and everyone stood up. Draco realized that the verdict was going to be announced.
‘And what’s bad about it? Are you trying to shame me right now?’ Draco plucked the bottle from Harry’s hand and took a rather healthy gulp himself. ‘God, Potter, why do you drink this stuff? It’s disgusting!’
- Yeah, we do. And last time you brought up this conversation I ended up not eating lunch if you recall. – Ron was appalled at the memory.
‘Oh, so he actually didn’t tell you anything…’ Malfoy seemed surprised, although it was very subdued. ‘Anyway, as thankful as I am for this generous gesture, I’m completely fine where I am, so I think I’ll stay.’
‘No, Mr. Malfoy, sadly there was nothing.’ Shacklebolt shook his head. ‘On one hand it’s good, because there is no proof you’ve been involved in this, but on the other, it doesn’t completely erase my hesitation. I’m sure you understand.’
He was so wrapped up in his thoughts he came back to reality only halfway through Herbology. Apparently he was working with Pansy on repotting some plant he was in no shape to recognize, although he probably knew what it was. He looked around. Next to them Weasel was working with Potter (although for some reason Draco’s brain registered the presence of “Harry”, not “Potter”).
‘You shouldn’t have woken up yet! You were supposed to sleep at least 12 hours!’ She seemed worried, but that wasn’t what Draco was focusing on right now.
‘Didn’t even plan to. Although, now, that you gave me the idea…’ He didn’t finish that thought however, because the doors opened and a tiny wizard, that reminded Harry very much of Professor Flitwick, gestured for them to come inside. Harry gave Ron one last threatening look and sat down on the gallery while Ron took the prosecutorial stand. Draco sat on the chair in front of the high podium where the Minister for Magic was presiding over the proceedings, surrounded by about a dozen other witches and wizards. Ron’s pulpit was directly between them and Draco.
true if you think about it…’ Noticing Ron’s expression she quickly added: ‘But that doesn’t mean it’s your fault that he’s feeling some type of way about it! And drinking because of it!’
‘Fine. If you want to sit here and mope, go ahead. I, on the other hand, am fully set of getting you this job.’ With that, Harry marched over to the living room to try and find Ron and Hermione by way of Floo network.
- Well, I talked to Ron and Hermione like you said. Actually, Ron mostly, Hermione was mainly crying… - Harry hesitated.
‘Yeah, they’re still on it. And it looks like they will be for a while, because from what I’ve heard Lucius has been telling people that Skeeter might be on to something…’
