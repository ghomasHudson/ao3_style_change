"I—" Draco peeked over his shoulder, then around Harry to look upstairs, as though someone might be listening in.
Draco shrugged. "I swear on Morgana's tits, I'm not."
and have to make up reasons why it didn't have to mean anything, Draco said, "Goodbye, pet," with a tight smile, and then he was out the door, gone into the quiet night.
"Er—" Harry's eyes shot open into a mane of orange obstructing his view of the sky. Ron had gone in for the hug with gusto and held fast, even as Harry struggled out from it.
"More," Draco breathed, "please more." Harry was slow to add another finger, caught in the thrall of how hot and tight Draco felt around him. Watching as his eyelids fluttered, nearly opening but not quite. Feeling the sounds he made as vibrations against his lips, kissing him gently. Feeling inside of him, pliant and eager.
He looked down to the ground, to the dirt, as though to say
"The answer's still no, pet," Draco spoke into his lips, not bothering to kiss him as he tugged down at Harry's joggers without any preamble. "Too dangerous. Until you have a game plan for how you, being you, and me, being me, simply trot about London with nary a photo being taken, the answer will remain no. What we do, we do in secret."
"I want this," Harry rolled so that they were side by side. He gripped hard at Draco's hip to line them up. Draco gasped and blinked, close enough that his eyelashes batted against Harry’s cheek. Harry wanted him more now than ever. He wanted him again, wanted him today and tomorrow, and the day after that. It was like his very bones had come to need Draco, like his molecules were magnetized, continually seeking him out.
arrogant can you be? That it was you,
"What?" Harry realized too late that most magical people got flustered upon meeting him. Typically there was less exasperated yelling, but perhaps his companion was less than a fan.
In the same way, though, it was easy. There wasn't much room for genuine questions or answers about anything that wasn't mundane or very general or sexual. The blank spaces around what they did talk about made it very clear what they didn't—the past, their emotions, their families, their fears, their wants, and the spectre of intimacy with others.
"Alright. Let's get out of here." Harry stood and gestured for Draco to walk ahead of him, following him out the front door, not looking back to see when Noah would return and find the table abandoned.
You flop it onto his stomach instead, rub it against his in the cupped grip of your right hand. He purrs for you, heels slipping when they find the sheet and attempt to push in for purchase.
Draco asked, "Do you understand me?" and when Harry nodded, he blinked, and the tears did fall, the shame so hot that they burned tracks down his cheeks. Draco's hands were firm as he cupped his face between them, thumbs wiping the stains away.
"Oops. Happens sometimes. Comes with the territory of you know," he lowered his voice and leaned in, whispering, "magic. Can't use it to clean you up though or, you know," he looked over his shoulder at the other diners, most of whom were turning back to their conversations, unimpressed and unconcerned with Noah's wet lap, "people would notice."
I wanted, so I took what I could get."
"More," Draco said, holding Harry’s eyes with his own.
A visit to Harry's bedroom, a haircut, and boundaries are set, and crossed.
"Okay, good. Let's start with that," Harry said. He uncorked it and brought its edge carefully to his blue-tinged lips, tipping half into his mouth. Harry was careful not to wince at the sound of his ragged breathing in the small space. He glanced over at Malfoy's shower things—a sea sponge, white and blue bottles of Kiehl's products, shampoo and conditioner and lord only knew what else in bottles with Spanish labels—as the breaths came more easily. It was better, but not good enough.
, that hurt—"
Draco wished that Harry’s glare were simple. That it didn’t carry a gloss of tears. He expected the tantrum—Harry ran hot. Draco used to wonder if he carried that heat with him home. If he scared his wife with it, a temper inappropriate for a man his age and import. But the way Harry fucked Draco—the way Draco’s want coiled tighter until they met—Draco knew that Harry bottled up his too-big feelings and poured them into Draco instead.
He cupped his hands around a heart bigger than he thought it had any business being, considering the person it usually pumped blood for only ever seemed capable of loving one person at a time.
"How'd you know that I eat in the loos?" he asked, looking at Harry through some of his fringe come loose. He looked younger this way, Harry thought. The austerity of robes made him seem like he was trying to be a mini-Lucius, but he seemed smaller somehow in casual clothes. Delicate, maybe. Harry hated the things this look did to his insides.
that he knew from the look he gave him once he landed that it was more than just his flying prowess that had Draco impressed.
"Not to mention the registries," added Draco. Angelina and Hermione both sighed loudly at the remark.
"My cock—enough—for you?" Draco punctuated his words with thrusts, and Harry keened something like a response. His breaths came faster, shallower. Full, restrained, prick so hard that to be touched now would likely be painful. He was close, still, just from Draco's tongue at his entrance and his cock, long and thick, owning Harry from the inside out. He
"You can be such a spoil-sport," Ron cajoled.
"Sorry, Harry, I didn't hear you come in. Dad still refuses to wear his hearing aids," she said by way of explanation to the incredible volume of her phone conversation. "I was going to be off before you came over, only my meeting was cancelled and—"
"Of course, only—"
"Yep, real, actual talking."
They both managed smiles at the joke that wasn't a joke of Harry's life. As they turned the corner, he started talking instead about the menu and how Harry had to try the ahi tuna in smoked leek leaves, and something about non-alcoholic sake and Harry knew then that
"Enough heckling, Merlin, you lot are terrible," Draco rolled his eyes. "Anyways, I haven't seen this one myself, but I've read that it is recommended that parental guidance be used as to whether our youthful companions should watch it or not. I trust that it's not
He took Harry's proffered arm, and with a
"I'm serious," Harry said, "I don't know how the fuck I got here." He took a cooling breath, his temper rising along with the thudding between his temples. Malfoy's laugh quietened into little coughs, mercifully.
Draco nipped the right globe of Harry's arse cheek and then kissed it when Harry yelped at the surprise of teeth against his skin.
"That much is bloody obvious," Draco growled. "You can't just do that."
“It’ll need work, and so much wizarding space if I’m only to take half.”
"I want to show them that I'm yours," Harry said, “Cissy’s,” he added, quieter this time.
A lorry rumbled by, loose metal parts clanging loudly into the din. Crackling explosions went off to jeers in the park nearby, washing the room briefly in orange light. The Halloween ball seemed miles, years away now. Streamers, candlelight, and the pressure of performance. Harry rolled onto his side, pulled his hand away from Draco's. He needed to go home and find a little corner to hide out in until this passed.
“Look at you, gagging for it so beautifully. Again, then,” Draco said. He pushed back in, and Harry took him deeply, so deep that his nose nestled in the short thatch of dark blonde hair at the base as Draco held him there. Harry was glad to have his desire to inhale Draco’s scent—clean sweat and the scent of almonds that must be his soap. Draco held him so long that Harry started genuinely struggling to breathe, his body gagging out the intrusion even as his mind tried to make it work.
"You've noticed by now that I prefer to wear gloves in public. It's as much for myself as it is for my parents—long story," he pre-empted Harry's oncoming question with a look that instantly quietened him.
Harry snorted. "You're right. It is bullshit. But who’s going to tattle on me?" Draco didn’t say anything, and Harry bit the inside of his cheek.
Draco bit the inside of his lip and swallowed against a throat that felt raw. He took a breath.
"Answer the question," Harry said.
," Malfoy crowed. "What I wouldn't give for a camera right now."
find it a tad difficult to navigate, those windy roads, don’t get me
Harry played with the frayed edges of Draco's oversized jumper. He wondered why he'd ever needed clothes so big. Or was it a leftover from an ex? Or had his style simply changed at some point in the last few years. Perhaps he'd had a goth phase and had gone to raves and listened to industrial music until his ears bled. His recent past was a black hole to Harry. He had so many questions when he thought about it, but one loomed largest at the moment.
Draco eyed him through the blue haze of smoke. He looked confused and not any less angry.
"That's the truth," Harry asserted. "I was keeping your secret
An unknown number texts you at two on a Thursday, asking if you're up.
"Sit, sit," Teddy told him. "I'll pat your back."
Harry walked forwards as Draco sat up, reaching for him. Harry gasped as he made contact and pulled at his shaft with his perfectly manicured fingers. Harry tucked a long lock of his corn silk hair behind his ear, breathing out shakily as Draco slid his foreskin down over the glans and back up again, getting him hard in an instant, looking up to Harry's face to share a smile.
"Hirsute?" Draco teased.
"Malfoy," Harry tried again, slightly louder now. His voice echoed loudly, sounding peeved. He took a deep breath, mentally turning down his annoyance. Malfoy didn't flinch.
"You're lucky to have me," she told him. Harry took a deep breath, willing his hardening cock to wilt. Who was he to disagree?
, he thought,
"You Slytherins," Harry said, kissing his shoulder. "Too much
"I'll like to give descriptions anyways. Helps with my own memory." He was lying—it was because he knew that Harry didn't know the names of most flora or fauna and wanted to save him the discomfort of asking. It was sweet.
Draco snapped a saltine, chewed it as he spoke to Harry only in his mind, like a ventriloquist’s trick.
"Merlin, Potter. How is it you, you..." Draco looked at him reverently, his face dopey and soft. "You should see yourself. You look like sex incarnate.”
It would have been kinder to have never accepted dinner, or be lulled into sleeping over by the lure of a warm belly pressed to his back.
Out loud, Harry said, "Dare" but while he held Draco's eyes, flickering brightly with the reflected light of the fire, he said
"Do you hear that? Drake's told me you're famous, and you don't even know what Gatecrasher is?"
"That's a lovely gift, young man. It's our pleasure to have you," Mr Weasley said cordially.
His heart rate spiked, even though he was only touching the fawn-coloured leather of driving gloves. He wished it wouldn't do that.
"Fuck," he said, staring at his open palms. He violently wanted to scream.
Harry sank into the couch and loosened his tie. He was deadly hungry, likely to snap when he couldn't, really couldn't right then. Draco stood, approached him. When he leaned down for their usual
simply appearing when his back was turned.
"Do you remember what it was? You seemed—"
"No offence taken," Malfoy said smoothly, sitting straight once more.
"Er, yeah?"
"It's not that I don't want for him to make a full recovery, and to return to the work he loves, God willing," Jacqueline looked to the ceiling a moment.
And so on. His mind had begun to do what he'd trained since the age of eleven to do.
“That was, that was..." Draco leaned back, propped up on his elbows. "Fuck, I don't know what that was.” His cock was still hard and bobbed as he laughed too, looking down at Harry with something like affection. Harry’s heart swelled.
"I like cooking the Muggle way. I don't think hot sauces and knives and levitation charms should mix."
"If you're fishing for compliments, you'll find I'm giving them out much more freely these days," Draco added, planting a kiss on Harry's neck. "Anyway. There was a long shitty period of time, and then there were the six months where I kept trying to break up with him, and he convinced me we didn't need to."
"Should I be worried?" Harry asked as the light of the spells dissipated.
Parkinson used to send those—Malfoy’s hatred of the combination would be a nice, safe topic of conversation for their Friday check-up.
Harry couldn't help but notice the pleased looks from around the table at Draco and Teddy's banter.
"I anxiously await your review," Harry said.
No one else should have that image in their mind. It was a burden you couldn’t come back from. Especially not the moving memory, with visceral bits like sound and smell attached.
"When he took over the Manor, it was—" Draco swallowed, lost for words. "The things that happened at that table were abhorrent. It was truly disgusting, but we all had to come together for mealtimes and watch whatever fucking show The Dark Lord had deigned to bless us with." He stopped playing with his wand at last. Harry could feel his blood rushing in his veins; he was so on edge.
"What's going on," Draco asked as they landed in his darkened flat. He snapped his fingers, and the sconces along the walls flared to life with a low electric glow. He stepped away from Harry to peel off his gloves, and Harry watched, transfixed as his pale hands untied the mask from his face. They'd landed in the entranceway to his flat, but he walked quickly over to the dining area. Harry looked forlornly at the front door. He'd still never entered through it.
"I'll join you on the run, so I can join you for the shower after. You're the one who got me started on them."
Harry froze at the look. He hadn't planned for anything other than literally seeing Draco. Hadn't even figured as to whether they'd stay to watch the match or not.
"Hi darling," Draco smiled for him, putting down his drink and unfolding from the couch. He crossed over to steal Harry's lips in a kiss hello. Harry acquiesced, though his eyes never left those of the stunned man who still, through all of it, was staring right back at him.
Harry smiled. "It's marvellous." He swallowed, his heart aching all of a sudden, wanting to do Draco justice. Lying was so tiring after a while.
"I like you just the same, like this. I'm sorry I didn't see all of you before."
When Draco wakes it is to Harry's eyes, wild as a jungle’s underbelly. He touches Draco’s stomach and the bony ridge of his cheek.
"Are you calling me an unhealthy coping mechanism?" Blaise snorted again, flashing his perfect grin at him.
"I told you that I—push people away. I've been low, I've been a mess. When I left, I—"
"All I'm saying is, I’m not most people's idea of a good time," Draco finished sounding like he could care less about this designation. Harry wasn’t convinced.
“I’m trying.” Harry’s voice wasn’t his own anymore—high and strained. It was an ill-timed thing to say because by the time he said it, a switch inside him flipped and his balls drew up tightly against his body. Draco whispered into his right ear, “I fucking love you, Harry, I love you like this, come for me, pet,” his voice shaking, and that’s when he came, mouth open in a silent howl. His body shivered as his arse gripped around Draco involuntarily.
he could deal with. Useful, practical questions. Nothing too saccharine, or he’d skitter off.
"Good," Draco said, voice gravelly first thing in the morning, and then there was the brush of lips on his shoulder and then—nothing. Draco was across the room by the time Harry dared to roll over.
The cupboards in the kitchen slapped violently on their hinges, startling both men into sitting up straight as boards, eyes wide.
"As I'll ever be," he replied, practiced smile falling into place.
They sat in silence after that, a quiet so thorough that Harry noticed the ticking of a clock somewhere in the flat, tracking the seconds Malfoy spent lost in painful thought. Harry didn't want to care about how shit it had been for him to share his home with the snake-faced maniac and his army of cruel followers. Even as a teenager, a child, Malfoy had choices. Harry didn't like questioning whether he deserved the outcomes of them, though.
"This shirt is a large," he said, scrutinizing the long-worn tag, "in what world are you a size large?"
much info, and for the record, I
"And?" He asked more forcefully, closing the distance between them. If Harry leant in and tilted his jaw, they could kiss, and it could all be better, he thought. This terrible, stilted awkwardness would melt away, and they'd be left in each other's arms, exactly as they should be.
"Me? Not a bit." He rolled his shoulders, willing the tension building in them to dissipate. "I haven't a fucking clue what I'm doing most of the time. You?"
He wondered, absently, when the rush of feeling would overtake him. It was as though a bomb had gone off at Grimmauld place, and he was waiting to see if it was most appropriate to wait until the main course, or perhaps dessert before he'd politely let his friends know that everything dear to him was on fire, smouldering, and couldn't they please excuse him so he could go tend to the mess?
They walked down the block, the photographers shooting off as many shots as they could, all five of them moving at a swift pace. Harry could see their lips moving, hear their shouts as though through water—dim, muffled, unable to make out individual words.
Harry was ready to let loose a laugh, to say
"What on earth are you doing? I expected a hairball at the rate you were going."
"I'm glad you like it. It's the only pasta I can make without investing in the proper tools."
Harry didn't move from his spot, remained leaning over the edge of the car park. He craned his head up, marvelling at the rare sky of clear blue spread above them. It was bitterly cold out, but he was fresh off an hour's run, muscles warm and sweat still running from his pores, a warming charm enveloping him as though it were a mild spring day.
Malfoy pushed away from the desk and strode from the room, Harry on his heels. They turned the corner into the suite’s bedroom.
"Sorry," she said. She didn't sound it. "Just don't disappoint me, alright?"
"Malfoy, I—"
"You wouldn't dare," came Draco's retort. Anger boiled up in Harry as he realized that he had left Draco to defend both of them, and so he stood, holding the sheets bunched about his waist in a makeshift skirt.
Harry touched at his own lips, in awe. He must be dreaming.
"Hey! Yeah, sure, okay. I'll—I'll find that he gets home safe." She said something to him then, something kind, but he was already walking away, eyes peeled now for those features that were so easily found in a crowd, and the crowd was thinning, and the space wasn't so big, all told. But Draco was nowhere to be found. Making a second round of the space, Harry’s annoyance melted into worry. He had to tell himself that he was surely just missing something, perhaps Draco’d put a cap on, but on a third round, having already forced his way into the loo to check for steel-toed boots poking out from under stall doors, Harry was frustratingly confident that Draco had already flown the coop, and that feeling settled in Harry's belly like a leaden weight.
“You think that’s clever, do you?” He sighed, looking Harry over. “You think
"Yes, well. It
Steam rolled in, followed by black smoke. Next came the clatter of something fiddly and metallic meeting the slate floors, followed by silence.
The man wasn’t lying when he said he worked in the trades. His t-shirt is a canvas of paint splotches and drips. He bends over to unlace his boots while still on the carpet in the entryway, stealing glances, a roguish grin on his face.
"Don't," Harry ground out, "please." He was frustrated with Draco for suggesting that this would end before it had begun and frustrated with himself for being unable to let go for once.
The Malfoys had been spared, the lot of them, a fact that still brought Harry's blood to a boil whenever he caught Narcissa's pinched face across a crowded ballroom, or, even more brazenly, Lucius' in the halls of the Ministry of Magic. But in all the intervening years, through all those run-ins, not once had he seen the youngest of the Malfoy clan, and it was this fact that now nagged at him.
"To which I, thinking that it couldn't possibly be by any means big news, said 'And what's that?' to which you replied—do you want to do this part Hermione, or shall I?"
Instead, he was violently confronted with Malfoy’s body. He was a pale beacon in the gloom of a glass tank sat menacingly in the centre of the room. The top rim was just high enough for Harry to reach without jumping, and on the other side of the glass was Malfoy, submerged to the chin in slush. The water tinked, chips of crushed ice jostling for space. Gentle snow fell and clung in tiny mounds where it landed at the top of his pointy ears.
"You sound like you're doing me a favour," he said.
"What’s the plan, eh, Harry?" Justin brushed splinters from one shoulder, picking the larger chunks out of the wool. "Advocating for Death Eater rights? Is that going to be your next little crusade?"
"No, I don't stock it. Pity for you." Harry cursed—of course, he wouldn't have anything as banal and useful as that.
"They're just like us, y'know? A whole spectrum of personalities. Some are just as conservative as the oldest pureblood families. Some Muggles know more about the magical world than Squibs do. The ones the Ministry approved to know about these mixed clubs will, for sure. You'll be fine."
Pansy coloured as a look of horror overtook her face.
Malfoy pulled his hands back into the cuffs of his shirt and crossed his arms across his chest.
"Draco," Harry breathed, warning. "You can be very persuasive, but I'd love to feel you with three first."
"I gathered," Harry said, pretending apathy.
"You got your wand back," Harry said. He hadn't thought much of it, giving it to his solicitor with instructions to get it back to Malfoy somehow. It was something he did during the hazy part of his life, years ago. Why his brain thought now was a good time to bring it up was beyond him. "I'm glad."
"Not a clue," Harry answered. "I only noticed this week when I was taking pictures out here to send to Neville, get his opinion on how to fix things up this year, and everything I tried to lean onto it fell through. Careful, actually—" he threw an arm out to keep Draco from walking on.
"Truly," Draco said, a smile curling one side of his lips. He wore a pristine white shirt under his jacket, the first three buttons at his neck undone, revealing a tempting swatch of creamy skin. Harry thought he must be boiling in long-sleeves in weather like this, but other than the dewy cast to his skin, he appeared as composed as could be.
"Considering you're not still trying to grind me to death, there are no love potions at play here, properly brewed or otherwise."
"Champagne? Compliments of the house," she pushed a cool flute into his sweaty palm, "join us in the Wet Room at midnight for the performance."
They'd started the music up again, a minute left to the hour, and this time Harry gave himself over to looking at the faces of the kids on the sidelines.
"So," Draco started, "have you been keeping busy?"
"Yes. It's better this way. Don't want to go fucking up things at work or," he covered his face with his hands and laughed coldly, "gods, the idea of telling my mother that I'm seeing you."
Ergo, the crate. Even if he is Draco’s favourite, it doesn't mean he is good. Not by a long shot.
"Come now, you're hurting my feelings. I may be an elderly twink—"
"You two." He pulled the blanket tightly around his shoulders, their attention refocusing on him again. "You don't—it's fine, I'll figure—"
"I've really got to be going," Harry said, glancing down the street to the apparition point he was at least a quarter-hour late to. "Thanks. For putting up with me. I could use seeing more of you, I think."
“How’s the burger?” he asks, and both of Malfoy’s shoulders drop.
Harry took her continued gazing through the window as permission to do the same. The music paused as Draco and his partner ran through a phrase of movement at half speed. Then Draco did it, emphasizing where his hands went before his partner mimicked him. Harry realized with a start that it was Draco teaching her the moves. This was his dance. It came from him.
"You'll live another day, it seems." Harry grabbed Draco's plate to ladle a portion onto first. "Gnocchi and peas, with pesto chicken."
Harry slid down the wall and dropped his face into his hands while his stomach tried its best to fall through his body. The spinning was back and along with it a popping sound in his ears like there was water stuck in each one in turn. He couldn't hide how stricken he felt as he gazed up at Malfoy.
And maybe, just maybe, he went poking around for details about what Draco Malfoy had been up to the last few years. And it was entirely possible that this searching was nosy and indicative of an unhealthy obsession, but Harry was prepared if anyone were to find out. His interest was perfectly above-board—he was just curious about a former schoolmate's goings-on, a bloke he ran into at a mixed wizard-Muggle club and would probably run into again. There were only so many of the places in London, right?
Harry started to say that he could travel to Wales, it wasn't like he had anything else to do during his suddenly open days, jobless and alone, but Victoria barrelled on.
Draco wasn’t allowed to keep pets as a child.
"I'm aware," he said. "I'll get you to your door."
Harry swiped at the newly healed skin with his thumb, revelling for a second too long at how smooth it felt. He recoiled as Draco’s eyes fluttered shut at the touch, afraid of the inevitable rebuke. It was an overstep, all this touching.
"Yeah. Um, neither." Harry said. Heat rose like the tide coming in, up past his collar. He’d never spoken so frankly about sex with anyone, ever. "But I'd like to. Do. Both."
“What do we say?” Harry asks, watching where the ruddy edges of his cock disappear into the pink of his body.
"What's the matter? You've been," he fluttered a hand over his shoulder, "away, somehow. It's like you're not here with me lately."
"Well, I have, so let me help you," Draco said, softening his tone.
“All paid up for the month,” he tells Malfoy when he presses a fresh-cut key into his palm. His gaze isn’t flinty anymore. Faint lines soften the skin around eyes the colour of clay.
“Sure. Loads of times.”
Draco laughed, biting his lip the way Harry knew meant that he was thinking of him naked, or getting there.
"How," Cissy gasped as Harry dragged two fingers into and out from her, "how do I feel?"
Harry managed a half-smile but remained dutifully mad about it. He wanted to sulk, not to have a laugh.
"Yes, they're well," Harry said. "I'm going on a ski holiday with some of them, actually, later this week." Harry gulped, realizing that he'd forgotten to plan or pack or tell anyone relevant. "Once I'm back, I'd love to figure out Christmas. With you, and Teddy, I mean. I should have asked already, months ago, er, fudge—maybe you're not even planning to be here? Are you planning on being here?"
, he bargained. He'd settle for okay.
"Will do," Harry demurred. "And thanks for allowing me to cook for you while in an apron; it's ever so kind of you." He thumbed at one of the circles under Draco's eyes, thought of asking him how he'd been sleeping, and if he'd been eating, and well, and what was it that had robbed him of his light—but he didn't. He wrapped his arms around him instead and hugged him tightly, and hoped. Sometimes it was all he could do.
Draco huffed. "I'm craving prosciutto." He pulled away from Harry's grasp, wincing as he rearranged his erection into a more comfortable position within his jeans before settling into the sofa, cross-legged. "And cheese. Something crispy and astonishingly fattening."
Harry bristled. "I'm not stupid, Draco—"
"Better?" Harry croaked when Draco pulled him off by his hair. Draco couldn’t seem to think of what he could say to express what he felt, so he hauled him to his feet and kissed him instead.
"I'll do you one better," Harry muttered, pretending to be more exasperated than he felt. Draco did bring out the drama in him. He scrawled
he’d cast would hold, sleeping in a loft where any of his roommates for the weekend could have walked past or overheard.
"Seventy," he corrected.
painted in a dated burgundy colour, which had clicked shut behind them. Draco was beyond that door. "I brought him straight here. It was habit. I'm used to this floor." Harry's jaw protested all the talking he kept putting it through, and he winced through a throb of pain expanding out through his skull. He pressed a palm firmly to the wall. There. Steady, cool. Real.
Like he hadn't held his cock in his hand, pressed his cheek against his cheek and made him sigh.
"You've abandoned him with no name," hissed Ron. Harry couldn't believe the conviction he poured into those words, even as he managed to keep the volume to barely above a whisper. He gestured with the hand holding his tea, sleeves rolled up to reveal the scars he generally took pains to cover. "How could you do that?"
Draco spread his knees without hesitation, and it was on.
"I'm sorry. I don't mean to be snappish," Draco said.
But of course, he looked, and his stomach wrung itself into knots because he got lost so quickly in Draco’s eyes, didn’t he? They were altogether familiar and yet now so new to Harry. Open and alive and bursting with emotions and thoughts Draco was generally so skilled at hiding from showing on his face.
Ron snorted. "You're so weird."
“What?” Harry’s face did a weird thing. He wasn’t used to Malfoy looking directly at him that way. “Come on, you’re sucking all the fun out of it. You know I’m taking the piss.”
"It was cowardice," Harry said. Malfoy shrugged.
"Silly article," Justin said. He sipped at his own drink. Harry couldn't recognize what it had been. All he tasted was heat.
"Don't tell anyone, but he Obliviated about half the staff of the NHS to keep me in care."
Harry watched him walk off and hoped it was to a patch of green in the midday sun. He hoped and hoped and hoped.
"That time, I was prepared too. I wanted to study on the continent and pursue my Mastery of Potions like I am now. It was a valid out. I figured I could sit the war out." He removed his glasses, folding the tines and placing them on top of his gloves. His face placid. "Mum, she took forever before she said anything. And what she finally said was that I should develop my mind, on a path of my choosing. That it was a proper thing for a man to want to step out and make his own mark on the world. It was the weirdest thing—we were always talking in code, and she read between my lines, and I read between hers. Which was normal for us. She was warning me against taking the Dark Mark."
"What I want is you, Draco. If we can't go back to before, then I want to try something new. If you'll have me." He put down his wand at last and outstretched his hand, palm up on the table. It rested inches from Draco's, still curled tightly around the bulb of his wine glass.
"Yes, I said it. Frankly, I can't believe all the missed opportunities we have to make advancements to our own society by incorporating their methods, and vice versa. Also, why can't we have telly? We could vastly improve telly, don't get me started."
"Did you just growl at me?" Malfoy was apoplectic, his face a picture of utter shock. "Fucking brilliant. You sure know how to pick 'em, Draco. Merlin, I ought to
He avoided the trainee showers because the lockers just had to be alphabetically assigned,
"Can I do anything?" Harry asked.
Harry
Harry blinked hard, switching the topic the way one switched a channel. He couldn't think about Draco right now. It was time to compartmentalize to make it through the meal.
"I don't have one of those, and before you say anything, I have a valid reason. Those that my mother wishes to pay for I wouldn't touch with a ten-foot wand, and those I wish to pay for say the same about me, or I can't afford to pay them off to get over that aversion. There's nothing for it," he said. "Some of us need to learn to live with tempered dreams, Potter. That's all there is to it. The end."
"How very dare you," he said, his voice growling low and dangerous, "saying that to me right now." Harry thought that Draco's eyebrows had nowhere else to go, but he'd been wrong, his face the picture of distraught confusion. Harry pulled his hand off from Draco's mouth, a little
"You're fine company, Harry. We've known you all your life, why can't you trust us—"
and a warming charm, for want of something to do. Draco placed the perfectly folded blanket in his lap and smoothed its top, picked at the weave. He smiled at it—it really was beautiful. His magic always was.
Hermione gave a dramatic sigh. "Harry, we've been so patient, won't you please—"
Harry nodded reluctantly. He hated this distance from George—they'd never been particularly close, but this lowly simmering feud building between them felt one-sided and wholly unfair.
One falls on your cheek like a raindrop, and you could ask if it hurts but instead ask if he wants this, because it could be both. He nods, opens eyes alive as a jungle canopy and just as wet, and you tell him to make sounds to let you know if he wants more and he needed to be allowed.
"No, really, I've had a handful of drinks over the last couple of hours, I can hold my liquor. This isn't normal, I, I..."
The muscles of Draco’s jaw flexed. He adjusted his position on the bed and Harry saw the wince.
Abbott sat back, arms crossed tightly across her chest watching mutely as she assessed the situation.
Harry clasped his hands together, gathering strength. "A few other friends are coming along too—and Justin."
, Harry's brain helpfully supplied. He had to grit his teeth and banish the thought. He was sure that at any moment, Draco would catch on to his ulterior motives and tell him off.
"That was all. It wasn't more than kissing—"
"Yes," he croaked. "More."
Pincushions and promises.
“What if I want a steak,” Harry asks. “Raw?”
“There we go,” Draco whispered as he repeated the motion, drawing out, watching all the while, and then back in with a grunt.
"We don't have to talk about it," Harry interrupted. He worried his lip, looking to his bare feet. "I know better than to go asking about people's scars."
Harry sat in shock. He waited for something implausible to happen, something to reveal the entire afternoon as one long fever dream. When he pinched the back of one of his hands, Malfoy bared his teeth, his brows knitting together as the frown he so often wore settled into the lines of his face.
Her fingernails clicked like a crup's claws on hardwood over the tiny keyboard on her phone, her gaze sucked into its screen. Her manicure's pink was an excellent match to the yellow gold rings sparkling from her dainty fingers. This was the second time Harry'd repeated himself; he wouldn't be surprised if it took a third attempt to catch her attention.
But none of this is anyone's version of a wise idea, is it?" He caught the tail end of Ron's prodigious eye roll, and he and Hermione shared a smirk. "I have a chance, though. I could see it, that he wants to believe me. When he heard that first news report, it broke his heart, I think. I watched it happen. He
, specifically, but—I’d like a break." Draco’s face softened, and he shut his mouth. "I don't know what I want, and I think what I need is some time to find it. To explore."
"Couldn't have done, oh, I don't know, a silk blend, now could you have?" he said conversationally. "I'll have you know I reviewed your transfiguration work from your last visit and—"
Harry opened his mouth to respond but found that he didn't have the words to do so. Draco smiled graciously, giving the impression of a shark that has caught some likely looking prey in its sights.
To this, Malfoy crossed his arms and leaned heavily against the wall, clearly exhausted. He looked not unlike he had during the trials—gaunt, even pointier than usual. Harry could make out the mountains of his hipbones through the robe's thickness, and the way it cinched at his waist gave him a wasting look. It seemed self-evident that Harry couldn't leave him like this—he was even more shit at taking care of himself than Harry was.
"Can I play next time?" Teddy held a hand out absently for Harry to grip onto. It was somehow sticky, but Harry didn’t care, stealing glances at the eyes of his godson glued to the snitch as they followed in the rest of the Weasley clan.
Gasps went up from the table at a volume that Harry hadn't imagined. Andromeda and Molly's jaws dropped faster than the time Ginny dropped the word 'cunt' into conversation at the table.
"You do, Harry, you obviously do. You want something from me, and you're too much of a fucking coward to take it," Draco hissed.
He'd applied a gentle glamour, enough that it would take a couple of minutes for a person looking for him to realize that it was him. He looked like a cousin of himself—related, but not entirely the same.
He felt that he needed backup to tell Harry about it.
A young woman with very green hair peered up at him, eyes flicking between his scar and his eyes. He was prepared for the question—
"An opportunity," Justin said. He looked at Harry with admiration, even as one of his eyes kept cringing shut.
With a brisk nod, he turned and walked from the café, disappearing into the crowds of a new day breaking in London.
"We’ve dipped a toe into mine, and look—we’re both still here, alive and well. We'll never know if we can if we don't try."
“I believe you had some choice words for him about clandestine weekend hearings and the like,” he said, and Harry swallowed, remembered anger spiking inside him. “Only kidding. It’s so I have more time to poke around in your bathroom vanity uninterrupted, obviously."
"I've been up since half-four; it feels like I've already lived a whole day. And while I was home, I brought these—" Harry said, holding out the sunglasses for Draco to take.
"I always wanted to learn ballet," he said thoughtfully. Hermione and Ginny bit back laughs, but Harry just grinned. Neville was almost too sweet for the world, this enormous lumberjack of a man, wistful about a form of dance so elegant, it was a laugh to think of him going anywhere near it. A slow, wide smile bloomed on Draco's face.
"You know what they say," Draco started, but Harry cut him off, needed their mouths connected, fingers working the little buttons of his shirt open. The cuffs frustrated him; clothes were a nuisance anyway, and as he huffed and pulled at the sleeve the rest of Draco's clothes fell to the floor literally in stitches.
Harry reached over and brushed the softest bit of skin between his waist and hip, trying for a tickle, earning him a slap to the offending hand.
“What are you doing?” Draco asked. He stared down at where Harry was touching him.
"Is it so bad that I find you attractive?" Harry asked. He flicked Draco back and closed his eyes, concentrating on his new cleaning charm. He could tell that it had worked when his cock tingled where Draco's come was banished.
Harry realized far too late that he'd been staring at Malfoy's mouth, at the soft fullness of lips, and they stood close enough that he could see where his eyelashes were still clumped together into golden spikes. Malfoy's smile dimmed, and he turned away from Harry, grabbing the last of his things. The redness of his chafed cheeks would take a bit of work to get out; Harry wished, oddly, that he could see Malfoy again soon and know that they'd healed up properly.
Ginny nodded sagely. "Well, it'll be tough to top that, but we've got to start now if we're going to try."
"I'm only a few blocks away," Draco mumbled over his shoulder, easily keeping pace with Pansy, who looked like she was walking through honey. Harry stuck his hands in his pockets and shadowed the three of them, comfortable to follow.
, considering it's only half-nine?" Draco folded the paper up and placed it to the side, peering at his wristwatch. He was still in his work robes, open to the white shirt and charcoal grey trousers he wore most days. The watch matched his belt; prim, black leather and a silver face, unostentatious. New. Harry wondered if he'd bought it so he had one to wear on days other than Saturday; so that he'd be prepared for when Harry needed something to hold on to. The sex lately had gone fairly vanilla. Perfunctory, sometimes, even.
They held each other's eyes as they sipped. After a first bite, Draco answered.
A few minutes passed in silence until Harry’s voice broke through once more.
"Candy?" Harry asked, cocking his head.
Draco took one long drag and then Vanished the cigarette too. He really was trying to cut back. Sort of.
Harry frowned at the dust coating the windowsill and it vanished, revealing a bar of honey-coloured wood. He set the vase of flowers in his hands upon it.
thing. It was a bit much to take, all at once."
"You can't go up there," Harry said, his eyes watering.
"Promise me you won't see him anymore. I don't care about others, just not him. Promise me that, please." Draco nodded gently at Harry's utterance, and they sat with that for a while. Harry so desperately craved touching him then that he sat on his hands, sure that they'd roam his face and pull his frail form close if he left them free to their own devices.
Harry sat up, flexing his toes, one leg jiggling until Draco's hand appeared with the speed of lightning and gripped onto his thigh to still it.
"Uh, er, alright. Well then, I'll see you all in a minute."
," Ron chucked back at her, landing with an inelegant thud at Harry's feet, and dropping unceremoniously on top of him, thus starting the dogpile that always followed any annual Weasley Family Christmas Quidditch victory.
The boys catch a Quidditch match, Harry gets a pet name, and Kreacher is less than impressed.
"He didn't," Neville said to Hermione, "do anything, that is." Harry held his hand up for a hi-five with him as Ron and Hermione sat back, evidently taking Neville's word above Harry's—the wankers.
mean?"
"Oh god," Draco repeated, leaning his forehead into Harry's shoulder as the spurts slowed, shaking as his orgasm quaked through his entire body. "Oh, god, oh, god."
When he turned back and looked at him, Harry realized how bleary his eyes were. Unfocused, seeing not Harry but through him, to the overcast night. That though he didn't sway precipitously the way Pansy did, Draco was still standing there long seconds after he should have said something barbed or moved along, was alternately mumbling and silent because he was drunk.
"Yoga, huh?"
"You'll look so beautiful beneath me like that," Draco said, and Harry exhaled a long breath he hadn't known he'd been holding. His stomach was in knots, so incredibly ready to be laughed at, and yet here was Draco looking at him for all the world like he'd hung the moon.
"More," Harry screwed his eyes up, gripping his own arsecheek to hold himself wider, to take everything, every inch available, "please, more." Draco adjusted;
Harry considered the question for too long of a pause for Draco's comfort, and Draco shook his head, murmuring "I’m sorry," as he rubbed his knuckles over the back of Harry's hand.
"Those hardly count." Draco withdrew his soft touch and pierced Harry with a look. "What aren’t you telling me, now that you’re trying to change the subject to how good I look and how everyone knows it?"
"I'm not going to tell Ron and Hermione about you."
"What would you like me to do?"
Suddenly, a yelp of surprise went up from the crowd as the lights in the room dimmed. Harry's heart beat a sharp staccato. He balled up his fists until the feeling of his fingernails biting into his palms brought him back to the moment.
Harry swallowed, making tight fists so that the press of his fingernails into the fleshy parts of his hands would keep him tethered to the present.
"Pass?" Harry asked, confused.
Nothing like the dark tones of his bedroom. The linens smelled too fresh—of lavender and a hot tumble.
When Harry fetched them juice boxes and packaged sandwiches, the witch behind the counter jerked her head over towards where Draco ran zig-zags, Teddy laughing maniacally as he chased him about in their newly invented version of tag.
"Which went well,
Ron looked away, down to the shag carpet underfoot. Hermione was the one to answer.
Draco hummed, put down his own tea and leaned in close. His fingers found Harry's throat and he tipped his head back, examining with a touch soft as down where he'd applied exact pressure and force.
Harry stood so quickly his chair back slammed into the wall behind him. The hotel room wasn’t enough to contain his anger, and Draco didn’t flinch as he approached.
"Er. It would be nice to have someone to talk to about—oh, fuck it—about blokes and stuff, and I—maybe it's stupid, and maybe I'm making a huge mistake, but I feel like I can trust you now."
“You can leave now.”
He thought Narcissa would have the decency to look contrite, but all she did was straighten her cuffs and step closer to her husband. Lucius was sweating bullets—it was late for a drunk to be out in public, and he leaned heavily onto his serpentine cane. She'd need to get him home and pour him another or put him to bed soon. Doubling down on which side she was on.
He stood, brushed the dust from his seat and shoulders and looked back towards the house. The adults were nearly all inside, visible through the wide pane-glass windows of the dining room. The kids were in the garden, completely enraptured by the mini-Quodpot set, playing under the watchful albeit terrified gazes of Percy and Annabelle.
Draco didn't say anything as he slipped into the sheets beside Harry, handing him a phial of the potion they both needed. Harry necked half and watched as Draco took the other half dose, turning away from him as he pulled the duvet up to his neck.
"How long?" Draco asked.
The question took Harry off guard. He lifted his head and turned to catch Draco's eye over his shoulder. His face was pinched, almost pained.
A date, a walk, and difficult conversations.
A pang of guilt swelled in him due to the implication that he would let her down. He knew all too well that it was a well-founded one. The last year had been a rough one for him, and it was only a healthy relationship between Victoria, Gawain Robards at the Ministry and Barnabas Cuffe at the Daily Prophet that had kept some of Harry's more egregious behaviour from becoming well known to the magical public.
Rather than the standard black or jewel-toned dress robes that were the charitable class's uniform, Draco wore a motorcycle jacket of lived-in leather, a primly buttoned white shirt, and tight black jeans. The same riding gloves he’d worn to the café hugged his hands, and Harry was able to take in a silver stud earring and the ubiquitous pair of oversized black lacquer sunglasses hiding his eyes before Draco noticed.
"Yeah," Ron heaved a sigh. "He came yesterday for the vigil. Staying the week. Mum's thrilled; Dad can hardly string two words together to say to him. And he's still, well, you know. Percy."
"Ever the saviour. Next time, put some slippers on, you maniac."
The seating arrangement was an alteration of what it was every week, with Mr Weasley sat at the head of the table nearest the kitchen, so that it was his job to levitate in forgotten odds and ends. Mrs Weasley took up the far end, keeping her from standing at every opportunity and dashing away to grab this or that thing that she deemed necessary for one of the guests. Once she was sat and a glass of wine poured, it was a rule that she wasn't allowed to stand again unless it was to nip away to the loo.
He chose to ignore Draco's eyes widening at the thing in his hands.
"We're early, now that we're not walking to lunch. Why don't we fetch some overpriced tea and walk around for a bit? You look like you need it."
His thoughts didn't hiss or rankle. He sounded wounded. Scared.
Harry dragged his eyes away from the swell of his small, muscled arse up to his eyes, crinkled with amusement, one pale brow raised.
"Look at your prick; it's absolutely gorgeous, like the rest of you," Draco whispered. He spat in the palm of his free hand, wrapping the long set of his fingers around Harry’s shaft. Harry hissed, wanting to pull away. It was too much. He couldn’t handle this, he was going to embarrass himself, but he couldn’t escape, trapped now as Draco's other hand ventured lower to cup his bollocks. There was nowhere to go but through.
Then there was the smell of orange oil and almonds, and a sweaty brow under a flop of blond hair, and that pink bottom lip worried by a sharp snaggle tooth canine, and Draco's clear grey eyes round with pleased surprise.
"Wait here for me," Draco said, and then he was gone, off to the en-suite, the door clicking behind him. Harry arched his neck as far as it would go, the back of his head drawn towards his spine so that he could lose himself in the show of crackling red and carbon black of the fire behind him. He was stuck there, suspended in thought, left wondering if Draco felt the need to purge the handful of nuts he'd eaten or if his reasons for leaving the room were innocent, as innocent as whatever carnal desire he was currently planning for could be. He wished that all of the new worries zipping through his mind could be placed in the box where he'd hidden his feelings earlier but knew that they couldn't, or they'd spill over; he could see how it would happen in his mind's eye—the arm of something slippery—an octopus, perhaps, a negative thought with eight dreadful alternate endings forcing up the lid on the box until the little anxieties could creep out, like so many centipedes. A thousand hairy legs attached to the bodies of a hundred evil thoughts would come to him in a flood, and he'd be back where he was last summer, overwhelmed and useless to help anyone, blacking out on his rooftop and wishing that he'd fallen off the side in the night. And so instead he breathed and tried to lose himself in the fire.
“That’s about the size of it, yep,” Harry said grimly.
"It's okay," Draco was quiet as he slowly twirled the wax paper bracelet around his wrist. "They're Muggle medical records. There's no reason why you'd have known."
There was one more item awaiting him, and worrying his lip and drinking whisky and staring at himself in the mirror weren't miraculously making it go away.
"I'm sorry," said Harry, over and over again, until he realized it was falling on deaf ears, and he left Victoria to her full-on breakdown.
"And, er, who's this? Here? In the house?" Draco raised his eyebrows and stepped away, silent, enjoying the spectacle far too much. "Who is—you know what, nevermind. I'm Harry Potter," he said at last, finding himself. He crossed over and held a hand out, practised smile falling into place. It was second nature to be polite, so he was, holding the handshake and giving the guy time to find his words again.
Even though he was.
"But—"
Harry looked over and caught the moment when Draco stilled, and if Harry knew him any better, he’d be sure that he registered hurt in the brief narrowing of his eyes. Or derision. Perhaps he took offence to the word
"I'm getting you in shorts this summer, mark my words," Harry said at one point. A brow quirked up over the top edge of Draco's sunglasses. He smirked.
the thought floated across Harry's mind, as he subconsciously took a lick of vanilla ice cream.
"Which others?"
Draco giggled, bit his lip. The look he gave when he looked up stole Harry's breath properly away.
No. Not full. Not completely, not yet. Not until after Draco removed the fingers and his cock, which Harry was reluctant to have to let go. He didn't whine though, lay catching his breath as Draco dropped the watch into his hand. He ensured that Harry's fist was suspended out over the edge of the bed and wrapped his fingers around his.
. The pitch of your thoughts—most of the time, it's like white noise to me. When you're pleased, they're smooth. Soothing, almost. Like when I'm giving you head, I can practically hear your brain purring, and it makes me feel so good to hear it, and then I just want to make you feel even better."
"Don't be," Draco said, letting the arm drop to his side. "It's not your fault."
He removed his jacket and sent it to hang on the back of the door.
"How'd you—what? Since when—what's Victoria on about, now?"
When checking in to their hotel in Marrakesh, Harry's ears perked up when the clerk mentioned that the two rooms for their reservation were adjoining.
"Why did you go to rehab?"
"Okay, fine. I was bored, and I saw the notice of your hearing, and it was convenient to, y'know,
"Nah—the only other spot we've got left is Stoke Heath, and there was an exposé on overcrowding last year, remember? Norwich is open for overflow."
His laugh was high and thin as blood cooled on his chin, sticky where he touched to discover how low it had flowed down his throat. Harry stilled, aghast. At what he’d done. At what the score was, then.
Harry nodded at his plate, hoping he looked deep in thought, and not as though he’d been staring at Draco like a wide-eyed first year.
Then he pushed further until the crown of his cock popped inside. The movement drew a sharp inhale from Draco's lips.
"Wait, are you being serious. Did you do this like, a
"Will we need a bed tonight then, pet?" he asked, and Harry shivered at the word, and he knew then in a way he’d only guessed at before that he was a proper little deviant, the way he wanted to be Draco’s favourite plaything. "Or," he spoke slowly, "will the floor suffice?"
After all that waiting, as soon as Harry opened his mouth, he was interrupted.
"It's my plan. For gaining a stone." He was twitchy, eyes flicking to meet Harry's and then back to the chart.
he knew, but in reality, he had no clue. Had rubbed at his ankle as they'd sat on the couch that morning, and noticed the bruise running along his big toe and into the arch that should have healed weeks ago, faded but still present. Realized that he ran on that foot, and awoke through the Dreamless Sleep, and had stopped taking the tincture, but that still, somehow, everything with Draco was
“Excuse me, but
"What's all this?" Harry asked, but Draco smashed his lips together and took him by the hand, leading him over to a loveseat in the centre-back of the room. He pushed him to sit and gave a dazzling smile.
"Say what?" Harry asked, throat tight.
didn't need to be placated right now.
he told himself, when the want to ask Draco blunt questions reached a fever pitch. He swallowed the urges instead, could feel his anxiety turn the little stones of worry to bits of coal, hardening them, and in the process, making them seem more important than they probably were.
"Well, that is my name, so you'd best get used to it."
"Not taking the bait on that one," Harry outstretched a finger from around his tumbler to point at Draco. "You sound like Hermione when you say that, you know." Draco grimaced, and Harry felt absolutely vindicated in shoving him with his shoulder for it. The touch, though brief, was electric. Magic rippled with anticipation along his skin, tingling, and he wanted more of it. More of the feeling he only got when Draco was around.
"I see you've progressed from boot-cut to a straight leg tonight—congratulations on your sartorial improvement—so it's the saviour act that's getting on my nerves right this moment."
Two years into training they got drunk and it happened. A fumbled kiss.
The answer was met with scoffs, and though he didn't move at all, Harry could sense tension stilling the body next to him. He sipped his beer, counted to three before turning to check Draco's face. His jaw tensed up as he swallowed, and the vein in his temple where the tips of his hair now brushed, throbbed. Internally, Draco was low-grade freaking out.
"You're doing yourself a disservice, Draco," Hermione called from down the hall, "I've seen firsthand what that mead can do, it will be the end of us! A pint each or we'll all wake up Splinched in the morning."
Draco growled and changed the angle suddenly, rutting upwards instead of down so that he slid his thick cock between Harry's arse cheeks, ready to come into the dip of his lower back. Harry wanted the feeling desperately; he could only imagine how good it would feel, the hot, heavy come landing on his skin, and his words came out garbled.
Jessica's look was apologetic. She understood the needs of an overworked system in a way that Harry was only just getting acquainted with.
"Is that a standard sort of dream for you?" Harry asked, throwing damp covers back from his sweating body. The two of them together were too much for Draco's down duvet—they'd have to switch to something lighter if they stood a chance of sharing a bed as often as they had been lately.
Next in was Pansy around midday, armed with a spray of roses in watercolour pinks and yellows and a styrofoam Costa Coffee cup for Harry. Harry watched from a distance as she bullied a Healer trainee into taking the bouquet into Draco’s room.
"Sit," he said. "If I were on molly, I'd be liable to agree with you. This isn't the Calming Draught—don't worry. It's the day. It's this place."
"Malfoy," Harry balked when he recognized the motif of his shirt. "Are you wearing Adidas?"
"Out." Blaise dropped the arm that had been pointing and out came his wand into his palm. In an instant he had it at Pansy's throat, leaving not a centimetre's space extra lest she sink into it. "Right now, before I lose my temper."
"I cancelled," Harry swallowed, the real answer harder than he thought it would be to admit, "and I just really, really needed to see that you're okay," he stated, his voice somehow smooth and calm, even as each beat of his heart grew louder in his own ears. Draco opened his mouth to retort, and then deflated. Harry thought he must look particularly pitiful to shut him up so easily, lips smashed together in a thin line.
"Are those seven-minute, or scrambled?"
Draco motioned to follow him over into the lobby, all granite tile and large, tropical plants. He was surprised that the building didn't have a doorman, though a manager of some sort sat behind a wide desk to their left, chuckling through a phone call. He acknowledged Draco with a wave, and Draco smiled back, picking his way around a
Harry expected his face to crumple, but he went blank instead. Meaning he went inside, someplace and tried to shut Harry out.
"He isn't even offering
"I know that, you wank," Harry said. "I meant—particulars. Requests."
"Well then, that's when I'm asking if I can join you."
"There was a 'not' in front of it."
Draco settled his bottle on the ground next to him and placed his wand in his palm, raising his chin slightly towards Harry, radiating a cold, collected pride. Harry wondered what painful, questioning memories that haughty mask covered for.
Harry couldn't tell for how long he sat agog, looking up at his childhood nemesis. Malfoy stared back just as intently before dropping to crouch on his haunches, looking from one of Harry's eyes to the other and back again.
Harry keens a little, high in his throat, and that’s when Draco notices that he’s got something in there with him.
Harry huffs. “If you don’t know, I could just—”
cut through the clutter.
"I brought this, too. It topped a best-of list last year, says Seamus."
"Same as you do. We don't have to go, you know." He looked up, to all the people smartly dressed; the silk and summer weight linen suits. He didn't care for it in the least. "Let's go home. Let me take you home."
"Okay," Harry said, "oh god, Draco, I'm—fuck, I'm—"
Harry bit his lip and nodded, eyes gone misty when he picked his gaze up from the path to spot Teddy's yellow slicker, stopped now as he squatted over a newly found slug that he was trying to get to move back to the grass with some helpful prods with a twig.
Harry breathed heavily. In, out.
"Sod off!" Ron interrupted, to her bemused smile. "Tell that to my bank account; we didn't do anything this year."
"Why do you think I'm upset about that?" Harry lay back, pulled his knees to chest and held the pose. He needed a massage to release the tension he'd been carrying in his everywhere for weeks.
the kind of travel we're talking about," Ginny and Luna cheers'd one another as Neville blushed a deep red. "Travelling for sex rituals, now
. In that case—no,
"It's not like that," Draco said, frowning, waving the lit cigarette around, lecturing. "It—I was a fat baby, remember? I continued in that vein for a while, and Lucius used to tap my belly and say I'd turn out like the elder Malfoys—portly fucks. Mum would say that I'd end up skinny like the Blacks even if it meant half-cantaloupes and cottage cheese. I was lucky when puberty hit early but, I worried. They already didn't like me much—"
sign. It was mundane—well kept and subtly posh, and so thoroughly Muggle that Harry could hardly believe that this was where Draco Lucius Malfoy actually lived.
"Once he gets to the making amends part, he'll be reaching out to the people he's hurt. He's got to do that all on his own."
The tiny woman confronting him softened, though not by much. The tension with which her hands gripped her crossed arms loosened, at least.
He hands you the roll and it's already dry, warmed by a charm held in his palms, no wand required. You run a droplet to wet it again, use the flame of a lighter to dry it, light the end, inhale deeply and pass it to him.
Harry takes another sip and pushes the glass away.
"Oh, it’s magnificent now, is it?"
. I get the front page to prove that I was the bloody victim, to tell you I'm waiting, and I get a
"Just making conversation."
Draco smiled wider and dipped his head, brushing away the sweep of hair that fell over one eye. When Draco caught his eye, Harry's mouth went dry as he realized he was staring, and he immediately looked to Luna instead.
Kreacher took a step back from him and looked to the towers of silver-gilt glassware, the ensign of a
“I was careful.”
He shook it off, taking a proper swipe of Draco’s ice cream before murmuring a stasis charm at both cones.
"Yes," the word had to be forced out through his constricted throat. "More, please. I need your cock," he squeezed the words out, and that was enough, the fingers added again. Harry moaned and widened his legs, straightened up onto his elbows so he could look back at where Draco's hand disappeared into his body.
"Oh, well. That's," he sucked in his breath, "you know. It's not looking great."
"Mmm," Harry hummed. Draco cast his attention to the triangle of toast pinched between his fingers. "Finish that before you get crumbs all over. And at least try a bite of the eggs before they go cold so you can let me know what a wonderful job I did with them."
Harry pulls the finger down and out and Draco’s sudden grip of his hand surprises him.
The one Harry prodded open against his best judgement.
Draco frowned, and Harry raised his hands in defeat.
“Sure, fine, yes, whatever," Draco shrugged. "Interested?"
"Wear your old pair for the week, I don't care," came Draco's reply. "You prefer them anyway."
Harry startled back from the window, worried that he'd spoken aloud and not simply thought the words.
Harry balled his hands into fists, forcing himself to look away from Malfoy's flushed, pointed face. "As I said, I really don't care, Malfoy."
Draco ran a hand over his stubbled scalp.
“I’ve leaned into the mad-scientist look,” he’d told Pansy with a wink while she'd moaned about the unfairness of his uneven but rapidly growing lengths of hair. Harry knew the turtlenecks were to fend off the cold, his appetite shot and his body uniquely thin again. The glasses were for the migraines brought on by all sorts of things—caffeine, or lack of sleep, or was it dehydration, or simply reading for too long. Draco shut down when Harry brought it up directly, so instead he silently cast warming charms and brightened the
In all, he'd barely fallen at all, a handful of metres altogether, but the resulting incline of the hill had sent him deep into the woods from where he'd started.
“Yeah, no, I’ve got it. I’ve got a mean
“In my dreams, then,” Draco says, and he’s far away. High on whatever it is that gets him off. It’s not just the pain—he gets plenty of that without Harry’s help at all.
"Basically, a violation of terms. They were this close to hiring him—"
Draco smiled indulgently. "For a while there, I thought I'd fucked language out of you forever." He sipped his own tea, and Harry could hardly believe that he'd lain there, in the very same bed the summer previous, watching an enigmatic Draco watch him back. Of all the changes that had occurred in his life, that he and Malfoy had become Harry and Draco was easily the most wonderful and bizarre.
The moment drew out in silence for so long that Harry was afraid that Malfoy had walked away.
The pressure of him around your cock is impossible, and he takes it in silence. Holds his left hand in the meat of his right on your ribcage, not even a gasp. Where his hips dip and then flare into the curves of his arse, you pull him down while your hips thrust up, and try as you might, he doesn't cry out.
"I'm sorry," he croaked, waving a hand that dried them both. Draco gave him a confused look.
Draco let the sentence dangle, biting his lower lip, an invitation yet to be signed. Harry couldn't meet his gaze, removing his hands to rub the sofa's fabric in nervous little circles.
Harry burned with a blush that might never die down. He kept talking while Malfoy watched, indifferent.
"Yes, or spells. It's easy enough."
Harry’s vision went white. It was visceral, how much hatred that statement made him feel, and also how well things clicked into place. He could see all at once why Draco would keep someone like Noah around. Someone who could so easily find his insecurities and tweeze them from him, place them under a microscope, because his insecurities were secretly some of his favourite things to be pointed out to him. Someone not so unlike Lucius in their ability to take a trait like his chatter, which Harry saw to be wonderful, an extension of his overactive and brilliant mind, and to turn it on him, to point at it and go
"Me too," he whispered back. "Will you please tell me where in the fuck we're going and what in the fuck I have to wear to get in so I don't have to ask the hyenas?"
Harry opened his mouth to explain and then closed it as he looked Draco in the eyes. Pebble grey today, unvarnished jewels set in a well-rested face.
"That's not it."
"Oooh, that
"Glad to see you've finally shown up for your quarterly."
The grin on the man’s face slides off, and he is quick with the boots, plodding heavily down the front steps as he leaves.
"So, where's the party tonight?" Harry asked Pansy as she stuffed accessories into his bag. She gave him an arch look, the cat-eye liner on one side of her face rising dangerously high.
"Thank you, Teddy. I'll be careful." Little Teddy Lupin turned to observe if Harry was indeed being careful, which meant that Harry had to keep both eyes trained very carefully at the ground as he walked.
"You may have forgotten since your departure, but the Ministry's canteen leaves a lot to be wanted for. That, and Roger's makes the best ziti in Westminster."
"Slag for the system," Alex shot back. "Not everyone is meant to grow up to be a company shill." He looked back over to Harry, one fingertip and one eyelid an iridescent peacock blue.
"Harry, darling,
Harry had died.
“Where’s your signet?”
He steeled himself, taking to his knees. "I missed the smell of you so badly," he said to his shoes. "I jerked off wearing your scarf every night."
"First I've been inside," he hedged. "Draco and I usually have conflicting schedules. Normally right now I'd be at thera—work. I'd have work. Him too."
"She didn't want you to be a Death Eater?"
this toast gets eaten," he added, and Teddy was much more interested in finishing it when Draco intimated that he’d happily steal his remaining portion.
"Don't," he said, words clipped. "Just don't."
"Take me home and let me prove you wrong," Harry said.
Draco's voice was rough from lack of use, and he spoke with a heavy and unwieldy tongue. But he was sitting up, eyes bright as cut crystal against the cream of his skin and the chalk-white of the bandages wrapped around his forehead and the tops of his ears.
"How's that? Can I get us glasses?" Harry gestured a thumb over his shoulder, hopeful that a quick escape to the kitchen would give him the space he needed to regain his breath.
"I feel like about once a day you forget you're Harry Potter," Draco spoke to himself, and then at a greater volume that included Harry, "for fuck's sakes, you
"Alright," Draco said. He stretched long arms over Harry's shoulders, eyes flicking from his glasses to his hair, back again. It was a look of fondness.
"No, that was a friend."
Harry stared at the glass square at the foot of the bed. He slid down and poked at it from under the covers with his big toe.
. Really."
"Please stop, Ron. I'm so tired, and I can't. Not with you right now," Harry pled, but Ron wouldn't let him escape and held him tight by both shoulders.
"They've posted bloody armed guards at the doors to this ward, you know," she spat in his direction.
"If this was a cover, why'd you come over to the table then?" Harry asked.
"I didn't do anything wrong," Harry said, and it contained all the hurt he'd felt and been unable to show. It was a plea, and Draco winced, even, to hear how it sounded, this raw thing between them. "It was
"Fuck that. I love that you don't care. You've never been one to treat me like I'm someone special."
Draco looked Harry's body in its eyes and found them dazed, but that wasn't unusual, and he squared his shoulders. Harry was impressed, distantly, with the body. It had to be brave if it was going to take the next step, but it couldn't feel anything—
He pressed the button for the seventh floor as they entered the elevator and waited until the doors slid closed to push Harry into the wall. He gasped from surprise as the cold of the metal was pressed into his damp back.
"My mother calls me Ginevra, but most people call me Ginny, so we can start there," she said, then added with a threatening squint, "but my real friends get to call me Gin once we've traded embarrassments, so let's aim for that."
It wasn't a question. "Yes, ma'am," Ron said. His chest heaved but he took up the spot next to Harry and squeezed his shoulder.
Harry's face contorted at the thought. "It's working only too well, actually. I'd forgotten that I had it on."
"Oh come on, don’t be cross," Hermione chided him. "What’s there to be cross about?"
in the world. Can you get that? Can you even begin to understand that?"
"Why?"
Draco nodded again slowly. He hummed, kept hold of Harry's heavy hand with one of his own and caressed his cheek with the other, thumb rubbing the ridge of his cheekbone as their sweat cooled and their breaths slowed.
The thrashing slows but at a tug, Harry’s teeth grip retain their grip.
Draco faux-stumbled away.
It was a Firecall coming through the grate, an annoyance, but not worth getting up for. Anyone who knew him knew that he closed his Floo on weekends, with overrides in place for only his inner-circle.
He pulled off his glasses and folded the tines, placing them next to his fork and knife, then rested his elbows on the table and let his face fall forwards to rest his head in his hands. He barely heard the clatter of chair legs against the floor as the smell of coconuts and ink-thinner grew thick beside him, Hermione's arm slung over his shoulders. His breaths heaved as tears he hadn't been sure would be able to form wet his lashes into daubs of black and spilled, fat droplets staining the thighs of his jeans.
"Well, where would you go if you could?" Hermione asked. "I'm dreaming of getting away to Madrid this summer."
"I think it's good," The friction between his curiosity and his fear made the words grind slowly from him. "I think..."
Draco washed a hand over his face, the faint edge of a smile on his lips. It wasn't a happy one. "That bad for you too, huh?"
Harry had to learn of Draco’s successful lung collapse on their next visit.
“When I say so. When I choose you Draco, you’ll know.”
"This is what I get for consorting with Gryffindors."
Just because there were at least a hundred people between himself and any of the three exits on this floor didn't mean he wouldn't escape in the event of, say, an attack by neo-Death Eaters. And why should he worry about being attacked in this club in the first place? No one knew he was here yet anyway, right? Right?
Halloween day and night.
"No Mungos. It'll leak, it'll become a whole," Harry waved a hang around, the word he was looking for lost in the cavern of his brain.
"Can I kiss you here?" Draco breathed the question into the side of Harry's mouth.
Harry blinked, and when he came back to himself, Draco was there. His eyes held pain in the tension around them, but his hold on Harry's hand hadn't faltered, and he was present. Clear.
"Which ministry was that?"
"That's perfectly alright. I've read that you're attached to several young men at the moment."
"Harry."
is too obvious, and it was raining terribly that year, so I figured a twenty-four-hour gymnasium would be ideal. I looked them up in a directory and made my way over one at night. Lo and behold, I find that the gymnasium has since turned into a dance studio, and it is decidedly
"I will," Harry answered. He took him by the hand as they entered the room to await Healer Annan, gave it a squeeze just because.
, Harry thought, "—these other people who are so much more your calibre, and I’m just a spot of fun, I guess. I don’t know why you keep coming back, really, but I know that whatever you’re looking for, I'm not it."
"Ah! Smile, remember? Always be smiling, always smiling. Just take a deep breath and don't listen to a word they say to you or to me, alright? Let's—"
It slammed into Harry all at once. He had to chuckle, though it was an empty one. Justin's strange turn of phrase, an oddity among the rest of his speech, niggling at Harry like a loose tooth that he couldn't stop prodding at.
It took him ages to realize that nowhere in Draco's intricately planned schedule was
"You're not going to last ten seconds," he growled. "Deep breath for me, now," he said and then placed a kiss to his back, and then it was happening all at once.
“On your back is fine, thank you.”
“I don't have time for you to squint at it all morning," he huffed, summoning Harry's glasses and thrusting them at him, "Try with your specs on, for Merlin's sake." He helped Harry with his mug, the exasperated look Harry had been expecting making an appearance. Once Harry was ready, he pointed to the hand-drawn chart taking up a good half of the page.
"Why don't you go get ready? I've got it down here," Harry asked, and Draco squinted at him but didn't fight it, just got up and, grumbling in his own way, trudged upstairs.
tell us—what stories do you have of young Ginny here? There must be one?"
“If your girlfriends had
He was genuinely concentrating as he listened to Ginny recount a story, one arm supporting the other, holding a pint glass of soda with sliced lemon near his chin, sipping at it and nodding on occasion. He didn't interrupt, smiled graciously, and Harry recognized the way he dipped his head when she cracked a lewd joke or intimated eviscerating him if he ever did Harry wrong. Harry knew that he was tempering his verbal barbs, lofting softballs all night to play nice and cut the tension.
"Come now, boys. We can't let them ruin all our fun. Ron—aren't you going to ask me what a power bottom is?"
And Harry should have made a note to self to check in on him the next week. Should have thought of him later, written a note to Narcissa while James and Gin made a mess of the raked leaves Harry left in the yard. He should have, but Mr Barron was next, and Harry was high on the encounter, so he didn’t. Didn’t think about why Draco transfiguring pins and sticking them places he ought not to was a problem.
"Are you always up at the crack of dawn on a Sunday? Don't you ever go out?" The question was asked casually, and then, as though he remembered that he had to say something rude, Malfoy added, "You've got enough time to, what with your unemployment."
"I'd like that, I think," Harry said by way of acceptance, and they lapsed into an easy silence. Harry sat and then shuffled until he lay curled on his side, his head nestled on Draco's lap. Draco seemed pleased with the arrangement and played with his hair, smoothing it back from his forehead and detangling the snarls hidden within the loose curls. When a hummingbird crossed in front of them, its tiny body of dull brown with a full red throat, Harry wished he knew what it was.
scary for the wee ones—they've seen dragons in real life, after all."
Harry sipped his drink, unable to stomach more than a bite of the beautiful piles of food before them. His worst fears about how people really felt about Draco were coming true all around him.
Harry scanned the room for anything conspicuously missing. Looked to Draco’s fingers and found them bare.
"You like that, don't you?" He asked because he liked that Harry had to groan an answer, unable to speak with his jaw stretched open as it was. Then Draco stretched his neck long, pulling hard at a fistful of his hair as a second finger breached him, and Harry was very much in his body, full at both ends.
"Stop. I want you." The words tumbled out from someplace, sounding just like his own voice. Draco pulled his fingers free from the vice of Harry's arse.
"No, nothing like that," Harry answered, and Draco nodded, pressing the back of his hand to his mouth as though he'd almost been sick just thinking about it. Harry's heart sank, knowing then how it could unravel him, for it to get out.
"Why would you want to help me?"
“It’s so much worse that you, you—”
"It must be hard, having parents that want grandchildren," he tried. "The Weasley's seem to be in the same camp when it comes to me."
. He'd never signed a letter with that word before. He'd imagined while writing it what a release it would be to say it. To see Draco and to let the words fall from him—they felt so big, so heavy, that it would be a wonderful surrender to set them free. He still slept with Draco's t-shirt clenched in his hands and would need to burn the thing now, the bit of fabric he'd bunched up and practised saying the words into, so he'd be ready to say them aloud.
Harry wonders how long he sits in the garden on nights like these. How late he could possibly stare at a starless London sky, or at Harry and his wife and their friends, tucked away behind double-walled glass to keep the things that go bump in the night out.
from you? I—what even—"
"Ballet, mostly."
Draco huffed, turned from his side to his back, flopping long arms onto the comforter. “What is it? You clearly need to say something—out with it.”
Harry wiped his lips with the back of his hand. The rage was dissipating, and in its place, confusion began to lap at his thoughts.
Fingers found hair and just when it got to the point where it was too much—rushing to the next thing—Draco slowed again. Tugged at Harry's lips with his teeth, and played with his tongue, until finally, they parted, hearts beating at the same pace.
"Have you broken your lip today?" she asked. "It's swollen, I think. You're not allergic to anything, are you? Oh, Harry, if—"
"I'll figure something out," Draco spoke lowly, staring at his plate again. Harry wished as he often did that he had the power to control time. He wanted to go back to distract Draco from Andromeda’s comment. He wanted him to have the chance to finish the fucking cake, goddamnit. Why couldn’t anyone else see what was important, and what was not?
"And without the position at the apothecary, you can’t put in for a transfer. You’re saying you’ve been sacked."
"Shoot—I'm sorry," he said. "I know I said I'd bring them to Bagman's. We could—apologies, Susan—a pleasure to meet you, Marcus—" the couple stared in silent disbelief as he took Draco's elbow and led him over to his deserted table. "We could nip by mine after the match, and I could give them to you," Harry continued, loudly enough that anyone who'd been eavesdropping could hear.
Harry forced himself to look into Draco's face for a reaction and was glad to see that his cheeks were flushed regardless of his calm demeanour. The telltale spots of pink gave away that he was nervous, though he'd probably blame it on the heat. The thought made Harry smile.
"I won't. I'm really sorry, Draco," Harry said. His throat felt tight, even if the chances of him crying were zero. "I don't have an excuse."
Draco snorted. "Perhaps the Germans have a word for it. Oh, or perhaps a
"Forgetting for a moment the fact that nobody in our year came out while at school, it's not as though we ever got to know him. How would we know if he were whatever-sexual?" Harry hummed his ascent at this, privately glad that Hermione reined in Ron when he strayed a bit too far into essentialism for Harry's liking.
Draco's voice floated through his mind—
Draco's eyes swept over to him. "...Seamus. With tongue. For five seconds."
"Witches and wizards without family names are walking targets for Dark magic," Hermione said. Her eyes were round, shocked, and Harry realized that this really was serious. "The level of threat..." She shook her head as though to dislodge it of dangerous memories.
Draco returned, in a rush, straightening the knot of a tie of olive green and grey check.
won't be able to sort out. Can you do that for me?"
to be visited for its selection on potions; some, for their antique and rare books; rarer still, for their queer selections. They visited them all; Harry became aware that Draco travelled with an empty suitcase, shrunken down, whose explicit purpose was to be filled with shrunken versions of all the books he couldn't bear parting with.
"Used to be the war," Harry said. "People dying. Cedric, often. S—"
"Mione, you know I don't want that," Harry sighed, colouring at the thought of having one more thing with his name on it out in the world. He'd been working with her to set up an account at Gringott's for Kreacher with regular payments directly deposited into it. She'd penned an op-ed encouraging all those who still had house-elves in their service to do the same if clothes weren't an option (Kreacher had threatened to drown himself in Harry's used bathwater should he be given clothes; Harry had relented but promised to bring it up every year, just in case). Harry had also pledged a third of the Potter fortune to the cause, setting up a trust to provide transition funding for house-elves who wished to leave their lives of indentured service. Ron told Harry that when her article was accepted by the Prophet, she'd actually cried.
"I didn't invite you along," Draco volleyed back. Harry sighed, irritation showing through.
"Excuse me, I haven't been
“That fucking
Robards shifted, leaning close to Harry. The smell of his aftershave was overwhelming, like boulders smashing into a forest of pine.
telling me that he loves me isn't so patently absurd that the only logical reason for how this is reality is that I've fallen into a coma and I'm dreaming, that my life is a dream, but then I go and do something embarrassing and realize this can't be a dream, but it's also
, every other feeling in his body subservient to this one. It seemed impossible that he'd come this far since they’d first started up; could take Draco's whole fat prick into his body in short minutes.
"Obviously," he said, every bit the haughty teen Harry remembered from school. But that was cover in itself, the arrogance. This was a gift any way one considered it, and a thoughtful one at that.
"By the way, what have you done to Kreacher? He was downright
The people outside the window hurried to their destinations, coats clutched tightly across chests, heads bowed against an oncoming storm. It was a hectic backdrop, and in his state, it was enough to stir up his own feelings of dread anticipation. Something was coming—news, good or bad he couldn't tell—or someone, perhaps, and he needed this over with and to go
"Everything alright?"
Harry watched Draco for a reaction and got nothing more than a shrug. He either couldn’t or wouldn’t look Harry in the eyes, turned his beer by ninety degrees on its coaster, again and again. Noah guffawed, stomping a foot on the floor. He was certainly attractive—broad-shouldered and well-muscled, his short black hair gelled into a simple military-style flat-top. The way he sat with his legs jutting apart, taking up as much space as he liked, his voice booming above that of the other patrons set him apart. His money and incredibly American-in-London-ness was blatantly obvious.
Harry did as he was told as Draco tucked his prick away and leaned against the wall opposite from Harry, arms tightly crossed, hands holding on to his own ribcage.
Draco pinched the bridge of his nose. "Oh, that's rich. I'm not reporting you, you idiot." He looked back towards the alley, and Harry realized that behind the anger was worry. Draco cared about his job, his reputation. He cared a lot more than Harry would have given him credit for only an hour ago.
Rather than retort, Draco's lips went squiggly.
"Ah." Draco cozied closer to Harry on the bench, letting his head fall heavily on his shoulder. "The Ministry grows impatient to have its poster boy back in the field."
Firm, warm to the touch. The inside made out—it was a perfect example of Harry’s work.
Harry stammered, shocked at the vehemence in her words. "I—"
"Malfoy?" Ron squeaked.
There it was. The stare was back, this time with the addition of a subtly raised brow. A challenge—who would admit to wanting it first?
"As am I," Draco said. "I think that you believe that sharing some of the facts of your history will stop you from having to face them. To talk about them or to confront what happened. It's not much fun, your childhood."
—here, let me show you," she said, a smile tugging one of her cheeks up. He tried and failed, and she'd alter one thing—"Wait, from the side. Drink from the
"It's because he wants to protect you. He'd never burden you with more than he thought you deserve to take, and Saint Potter only deserves the best."
Draco puffed a sound, like the little sounds he made during sex—close to pleasure, possibly pain. Up close, Harry could see that he was frightened too, and he watched as that look slipped into confusion, then shame. He had been the one to startle Harry awake by shaking him violently, but as Draco clutched his hands into his chest, it was apparent that he hadn't meant to.
“Are you going to be good?”
"I know, your highness," Harry sighed. "There's dark stuff for you, and the cheap stuff for me."
"That's not what I'm saying, at all."
"What kind of cult?" he asked, at last.
Each in their own space, watching themselves in the floor to ceiling mirrors, their limbs cascading in rippling movements, punctuated with pops of a hip or knee in time with the music. Slow, slow, and then fast, bending not to prove a point but to connect from one pose to another. Sinuous. Slinky.
Harry waited until Ron's footsteps thudded down the stairs before he slipped the pillow from his head and tugged the tin close. Sure, biscuits would leave crumbs absolutely everywhere, but he was both happy and sad, and it was Christmas, and he was alone, so fuck it, he was going to eat crumbly things in bed if he wanted to.
"Make it tight now—
"Me too. I've had enough of the chairs, I think." They shared a smile, and then the healer smacked his lips, launching into his speech.
Harry thought
Draco growled at the ceiling, his head dropping back between his shoulders. "That's the
, but you know what I mean, I don't know many people who don't care about who I am or what I do or who I shag—"
"Draco, please stop." Harry crawled closer still and mimicked what he had done earlier.
"His name is Aedan Sparks, and his office is at the Inns of Court. I'm not sure where he lives, though," he added, scratching the back of his head.
"Oh," was all Harry managed, and it was with a stupefied smile that he pushed back into him with a shared groan, the feeling of Draco's thighs squeezing his body as close as he could, his long neck revealed to be sucked and licked and bitten, and it was then that Harry pushed in as deeply as he could and he came.
"Do what?" Harry asked.
"I say
Harry felt that he was being granted a look into Malfoy.
"How are your arms, pet?"
Draco kept on anyway. "The kind of ghosts that live inside you, and in the faces of strangers. They feel closer today, don't they?"
He stopped as lightning split the distant sky, and thunder made its slow roll towards them. Draco looked up, unblinking. The rain above their little island in the grass rolled off an invisible dome above them.
"How long, what?"
"That tart," Ron breathed, reading the letter over Harry's shoulder. "You know you're the only one in the department she's ever baked biscuits for, right?"
the insufferable one—"
, he thought.
until he was cry-laughing, finally pushing Harry onto the landing and slamming the door shut behind him.
The arms were back, slapping down on either side of Draco’s body.
"Steady," Draco whispered, leaning in for a lick under Harry's ear, and that was enough to drag him under to a place where everything was touch. Harry clenched his eyes shut as Draco kneaded his arsecheeks and burrowed his cock in between them. On a slow slide downwards, Harry could feel the fat cockhead slip past his hole, so sensitive that he made a little sound to feel it happen, and onwards, through the tight, wet channel of his thighs until the slide stopped when Draco's prick nudged at his sac.
He rubbed his stubbled cheek against the slippery surface of the pillowcase under him. Silk—Draco's—they’d swapped by accident. It would never do—Draco found Harry’s choice of plain cotton too rough, would wake with a sour expression and complaints about the tangles in his hair for his potions and boar bristle brush to work through.
Harry felt blessed by having a staff that didn't treat him like his shit didn't stink. On the flip-side, they, on the whole, seemed perpetually bothered by his ineptitude. Reza had once asked him if he knew how to tie his shoes. To this day, Harry wasn't sure if it was meant as a joke.
-headers.
"You do know that makes you a suit too, now you work there?"
"I'm never sure," Harry admitted as he pressed away, holding his own ribs instead. "It seemed right."
he thought,
Harry listened to the dry scrape and rub as she flipped through the parchment sheets clipped to the board at the foot of his bed. Visits to St Mungo's were scripts of sounds he could recite in his sleep. Next came the tapping of wood at the glass faces of the machines at the bedside. The rattling of pills in bottles as he got an explanation of what to take, and when. Potions in vials clinking against one another the way Christmas baubles did when as they were placed in his lap.
"You're depressed, Draco. Not the way I am, or was. I had—have, I don't know—I have grief, and anxieties, sure, but you? You've got something deep that you've lived with for a long time, in a way I don't understand, and you've done an excellent job managing, but you don't have to manage all on your own."
"I’ll cancel," Harry said quickly.
“Well done. I wish you a happy afternoon.”
After a beat, Malfoy rolled his eyes. It wasn't much, it could barely be called an eye-roll at all, but it was enough to loosen the band constricting Harry's lungs. He was somewhat successful in stifling a grin from erupting on his face because if Malfoy was rolling his eyes, he was going to be just fine. Harry might not know much about Adult Malfoy, but he'd known Child Malfoy and Teenage Malfoy and even Death Eater Malfoy. Loathe as he was to admit it, he'd watched Malfoy, and his habits—a lot—and the eye-rolling signalled a return to form.
"You what?" he whispered. "But, why?"
with some other bloke, it would count as cheating. Sure seems like sex then, doesn’t it?" The laughter quickly dried up as Draco shut the boys down handily. Hermione stared holes into the sides of Ron’s head—he was about to have a talking to all his own, once she got him alone.
"Cow," Ron whispered as the doors closed behind her. He slouched around the corner he'd been hiding behind for who knew how long.
There was a sheen of sweat on her brow, which meant she'd been practising difficult magic behind that door. Worry panged inside of him. Feelings were cracking through—he was fast losing the control that nothingness granted.
He usually managed to accomplish everything he needed to within a tight thirty-minute window and was home banishing Floo powder from the hem of his robes before the last cup of tea he’d been sipping went cold.
Black fortunes—"
Draco sighed, pinching his fingers on a paper napkin. Greasy fingers and Malfoy's didn't mix well. "I've never felt incapable of telling you to get out. You can go whenever you want, but for now, I want you here."
"Oh yeah, totally," he said, nodding as he licked errant cheese cream icing from his thumb. "I can write up a list. I've tried everything under the sun—whatever you do, do
The lines between Dream Draco and Real Draco were blurring. Dream Draco looked at him and said,
Victoria didn't much care for propriety, at least not in private. She waved him off with a brisk flick of her fingers.
Harry was off-balance at being caught checking Draco out and having noticed by said checking out that Draco looked fucking incredible in said jeans. He gulped nervously. This wasn't going well.
or get defensive, or look at him funny and make an offhand remark about his old friend paranoia cropping up. Instead, he sidestepped the insinuation completely and said, "We're going to be okay," and pulled Harry in for a hug. It stifled, he needed to
"Understood," Harry said, smirking from behind his glass of wine to hide the rise of anxiety within him.
"Oh. That's nice," Harry said faintly.
“No goodbye, nothing?"
"A reminder seems to be in order," he said. He stopped to take a sip of his drink while Harry crossed his arms and waited. He was shirtless, the better to get what he wanted.
"Alright, Mister Look Where Therapy Gets You, sure. I could take better care of myself." He sniffled, held onto the seat on either side of his lap, shoulders up by his ears. "Congratulations for noticing that I'm not doing a great job of it, would you like a biscuit?"
It was a testament to how much time they'd spent together that Draco didn't scoff or make a joke. He lay in silence, thinking loudly as he stared up at the ceiling. Eventually, he tilted to face Harry, one hand landing warmly at his waist.
," Draco batted a hand in Harry's direction, "it's my story to tell."
Harry scoffed. "Sure, I want to date."
"Well then, you'd have to clean up your mess, wouldn't you?" Draco watched, a hand lazily jerking his cock as Harry loosened the buttons to his jeans and ruched them down over his hips. He was wearing an old pair of pants, boxer-briefs, so that his cock had grown hard down one leg, poking out the bottom. He didn't bother pushing these down but rather took himself in hand from under the hem, closing his eyes and controlling his exhale at the touch. He pushed his foreskin down with his thumb, rolled it back at a leisurely pace. Having Draco tell him to do it, having him
And then what? What would that get him?
Harry closed his eyes against the shrill tone of Draco's cry. It was perhaps the hundredth time that Draco had called the elf's name in such a way over the course of the day, and it seemed as though it made no difference if they were in the same room or completely separate floors when he did it. It grated at Harry the same way.
"I know
Hermione took her turn staring at him, finally putting her fork down and leaning across the table to squint at his face.
"Okay," Harry said. He watched as his Adam's apple worked in his pale throat, breathed him in again, memorizing the moment. Time and space were difficult, were the two things Harry most wanted to share with Draco, but they'd be worth it if it meant more of him, one day, somehow.
Harry said, "Choke me please, sir. A five," he knew he’d never forget that moment. The flare of Draco’s nostrils as he exhaled, lust written purely across his face.
"Too late," Harry said flatly. "Looks like I'm carrying a torch for you for something like forever, whether you want me to or not. Please tell me what's going on. You seemed good, today. Things have seemed—good."
“Did you burn yourself?” he asks, rushing forward for a better look.
"You’ll be okay?" he asked. Draco scoffed.
He swallowed against the lump in his throat, threading their fingers together. "If I'm truthful, it never was."
He trailed off. He'd noticed Harry's puff of breath, and the slump of his shoulders at effectively being told,
Harry grits his teeth and says nothing. He’s only really upset by how thrilled he is for the visit. For the way goosebumps rise on his neck when he senses eyes on his back through the kitchen windows, eyes that ought to refract light like an animal’s.
Draco managed a crooked smile as he measured a spoonful of pain potion. He knocked it back and donned his sunglasses, a sign of a headache blooming on the horizon.
Draco pushed up to rest on his forearms. Even in the low light, the furrows on his brow were visible. “No, tell me. What’s this about presents? You didn’t go shopping in the state you’re in now, did you?”
"I want to make other people jealous," Harry said. It popped out of him, a whole truth, something he didn't have to think about to say. He
"No. It wasn't like this at all, but now, I think about how I'm another year older than they were when they died. And how I'm still here, and they're not, and how that's so unfair. I can't explain it." He shrugged. He was too tired to go into the
"Draco," Harry pulled his face up with a finger hooked gently under his chin. "Are you okay?"
"I'd like to reward you for being so good. Let's start by getting you up on the bed. You can let your hands go," he said gently, and Harry released them from their clenching of one another and gave a little moan at how good that release was.
"Listen, he may be looking, I'll give you that, but it's only because he recognizes me. That's it! I'm—don't give me that look, Ron—I'm being honest! If I were some random bloke in the bar, he wouldn't give me a second glance."
sound to drop from him. Again, again—
Harry sighed. "Look, forget I said anything."
"Draco?" Teddy asked, for what was easily the twentieth time in under ten minutes.
"Er, I—I just. You're wearing jeans."
how many orange infants I have to brew up antidotes for."
"Shit," Draco muttered, fluttering a hand out nervously. "You've only got list of four of us? I invited Pans too. Can't we make it five?"
"Not yet," Harry said, exhaling. Hermione was quick to mask her exasperation with her This Smile Is Meant To Bolster Your Confidence look. Harry recognized it as the face she made when she tried to soften the truth for him.
The cruel Draco of his dreams came to him, unbidden.
Harry filled the glass again and gulped greedily during the pause, while Malfoy sipped his coffee. They held eye contact for the duration, and it was...weird. But Harry couldn't look away; he'd never really been able to back away from any sort of competition, especially one with Malfoy. With his mouth no longer feeling as though it were coated in dust, Harry sat up properly and surveyed his surroundings more closely.
"He's terrible," Harry said, and Draco gave a one-shouldered shrug. Harry was vehement though, put down his mug and placed his palms flat on the tabletop, not wanting his anger to overpower the meaning of his words. "I'm surprised I didn't hex him tonight." Draco flicked a look at him, and Harry wasn't sure what he would do if he sneered, then. If he went not just low, but lower. If he asked
“It’s the cloak closet,” Draco sighs, flicking his eyes to the white bi-fold doors on the wall opposite the kitchen galley. “The smell’s in the paint. Can’t get it out.”
Harry pulled back a touch, waiting until he felt those eyelashes again. A tickle returned against his cheek, and then Draco did the craziest thing in the world.
"You mean a right twat," said Ron.
"I guess I'll grab a cuppa and join you." He backed up a few steps and then stopped. "Harry?"
Next, a message to Victoria. Harry had appeared suddenly in public with Draco, both of them bloody. He'd be questioned soon by Aurors, and no matter how tight the security on the ward was, the news would spread. It was a little past midnight, so there was a chance that nothing would hit the perked ears of Prophet or WWN journos before daybreak. But. There was always a chance, and Harry needed Victoria to run point. He wasn't in prime condition, and she'd see the angles he would miss.
"I think," Draco said with a final daub of his napkin at the corners of his lips, "that we ought to talk about some things. Set some ground rules." He folded his napkin into a neat square, whereas Harry had created a crumpled pile of haphazard mess. Harry swatted at the pile of garbage with his wand, banishing the lot.
"Did the—" Harry gestured vaguely, struggling to phrase his question, "did the, uh, stuff about your arm, did that get put in?"
Draco nodded, lips smashed together.
At this, Kreacher gasped, and Harry, having pretended valiantly to be busy from the corner where he was puttering around with an old phonograph and an iPod, burst out laughing.
"I appreciate that you all want to see the patient, but it's going to be a while before he's able to take visitors, or be questioned."
Quietly, saying, "Cetti's warbler."
“Crups and kneazles,” Harry supplied, and Draco threw his hands in the air.
It was only for a second before he regained composure and kept walking, but she’d noticed.
"Why does anyone do drugs," Harry lamented from the lounge floor, teeth fuzzy from lack of care. He felt low without reason or end, the minutes melting into hours that meant nothing, liminal space where sustenance held no allure. Luna poured him a capful of her secret weapon and watched him gag to swallow it, smoothing his hair back from his damp forehead as he coughed at its acrid flavour.
It was then that Harry snapped into the moment, realizing what had happened. He took off across the street to catch up with them.
"So, the Ministry pulled you in for a full hearing because you asked to wear gloves?"
"If you think it's such a dump," Draco cut Harry off, "it begs the question why the great and powerful Harry Potter thought it fit to bring Nova Newts, heiress and chief executive officer of the Nimbus Corporation, to a place that sells cones of stracciatella for a quid?"
"Well, it's a good thing that's impossible," Draco muttered. Harry rubbed at a shoulder and then stood, hand extended so that when Draco looked up and wiped away the wetness at his eyes, he could help him back onto his feet. Draco cleared his throat, and Harry backed off, peeling his grotty t-shirt from his skin and stripping out of his paint-splotched jeans, confident that if he didn't make it weird Draco would be able to forgive himself this lapse in his facade of being okay.
Draco pulled away, hands cradling Harry's face between them.
"Well, hello to you too," Harry said. Before Draco could come back at him with a cutting remark, he continued, "Okay, so morning-time didn't work for you today. But another day, it must."
"Yes, I did keep a list, because I too once held the belief that the number of people you've had sex with meant something, but then I realized that the number doesn't mean anything,
"I understand that you were drugged, and it categorically was not your fault," Victoria interrupted his thoughts, eyes flicking over him, "but these things, there's an art to them. I've got your best interests at heart; you know that, right Harry? You're not disappearing on purpose?"
Just as Harry decided to go with his gut, which always seemed to pick left, did a harangued looking witch exit from that direction. Before she had a chance to catch a look at his face, he jerked to the right, rapidly descending one staircase after another, taking the treads two at a time until the sound of more voices coming up at him slowed his speed.
his hands and stripped a pair of fresh gloves of their packaging. When he turned around, Malfoy lay back, hands crossed over the third button of his shirt.
Which was going to be problematic, considering how many times Harry had wanked to thoughts of Draco in the past week alone. Add on top of that how shit an Occlumens he was. Especially when he was flustered. Or horny. Or both.
"That’s not how this works," he yelled from the garden, "you, you—
"Thought you ballerinas didn't eat sweets, considering you never do," he said. Harry frowned, ready with a chastisement, but Draco gave a louche motion of his hand, smooth as anything.
,” Draco ground out, continuing to pump inside him. Harry sat back into his lap, wetly connected, and turned to give Draco his mouth, their teeth and tongues connecting. Draco was so deep inside him it was barely fucking anymore, more of a slow grind, and it was by his gasps into Harry's mouth that he could tell he was coming too, filling Harry up as his body was on its way down from the peak of his orgasm. Draco slowed his movements to an eventual stop, dragging in breaths once he was finished. At last, his damp forehead met the back of Harry's neck as he let his body sag from the taut position it had held.
Harry had to close his eyes and breathe out deeply through his nose to keep the next wave of nausea down. The fact that he'd just been called fit by Draco Malfoy should have been an explosive thought, but he barely had room to think it.
He smiled down at the sass on the page.
Harry raised an eyebrow, walking the length of the room down towards the kitchen, a plate of food left for him under one of Kreacher's perfect stasis charms. Eggs, bacon, orange slices. He grabbed it and a cup of tea and rejoined Draco at the table, waiting for more.
There wasn't time to spare for deep breaths or curling up in a ball and pretending that the world didn't exist because a wizard in the burgundy regalia of the Aurors looked up from the chair he sat in as they re-entered the ward.
"That's alright." Harry revelled in Draco's skin, glad to be able
Harry took to his knees and nosed at his cock through his pants until he'd stopped complaining about Simmons and started complaining about how slow things were going where Harry's mouth wrapping around his prick was concerned. Draco tried to rush things along, and in return, Harry gave him the slowest blowjob of his life. The night had ended with Draco bent over, their fingers twined together as Harry fucked him into the edge of the dining room table.
"I've never given it much thought." Draco reached out and pushed his hair back, exposing the crooked scar so that he could swipe his thumb over it, from hairline to eyebrow. He was frowning, worry tingeing his lovely features. Harry felt guilt, ardent and acidic that he was the one making Draco look like that.
A massive robins-egg blue oblong box awaited him on the kitchen table, a sight he looked forward to every year. It sat among a mountain of other mail that he cast a sour look at; some ripped open from the days previous and unanswered, some brand new, and more likely to show up every hour. The box was his special treat, so he pulled it from the pile and sat crosslegged on the floor, grinning as he hunched over it, summoning a fork with a thought.
Harry forced himself to keep breathing, swallowing the pit growing in his throat. It wasn't supposed to be like this.
"And you?" Harry asked. Malfoy shrugged. The furrow in his brow deepened as he turned his attention on sugar crystals spilt near his plate, pushing them into the pads of his long, pale fingers.
"Awe, fuck. We totally forgot," Ron started.
He nuzzled in against Draco's neck and was elated when he tipped his head back on a sigh, welcoming nips to his throat. Under the smell of his almond soap were his smell and the taste of clean skin that was impossible to describe. Harry wanted to devour him, sucked on a lovebite the way he used to love. Draco's hands roamed his shoulders and squeezed his biceps, and then one hand snaked down, blunt fingernails trailing through the wiry trail of pubic hair to grip at his shaft as he quickly hardened at his touch.
"Lucius was wrong. They were all wrong. Even Dumbledore—what he did to keep you safe, what your childhood was like—" He sighed. "What I'm trying to say is that you deserve pleasure. You've been hurt so many times in your life, but your purpose is not simply to withstand pain. Just because you're good at it doesn't make it who you are."
"I'm not going to do anything, don't worry." Harry tried for another smile, and it failed again. He might have broken his ability to give them. He took a deep breath and wiped his nose.
Harry let his head fall into his hands, trying to shake the feeling of dread off. Roger's was memories of a blistering hot summer day, and of Draco, Draco, Draco.
Malfoy stood still for a moment as the muffled sounds of the party raging inside spilled out into the night.
"No," Harry pushed the word out, a growl. "You don't."
"I like that game," Harry murmured into Draco's shoulder.
Harry started to think about all that he had seen, visions through a snakes eyes, forced Unforgiveables, the recurring characters of his nightmares. Malfoy's voice brought him back to again.
The pluck of the tip dented his skin infinitesimally, and the slide between his ribs was delicious. Draco’s thumbs were hidden inside of fists pressed deep into the mattress.
Harry shook his head, and Draco nodded. "Good. I'd suggest the Floo and charmed notes, but if you've got visitors pretty often, they might get suspicious if one comes through while they're there."
me." Draco heaved breaths, just out of Harry's range of reach.
but seeing that he'd already stopped in his sprint, she simply huffed.
"There was me, being the person you haven't had to see me be before."
"Without an advisor, I can’t hold my position at the apothecary." Draco’s voice dripped with anger.
"Because it's so tall?" Draco aligned their bodies, insinuating his thigh between Harry's legs as he kissed him. Harry's body responded with a jolt to his cock, and Harry prayed that they could make it to Draco's flat before he got fully hard, as Lycra leggings and tiny football shorts didn't leave much room to the imagination where his cock was concerned.
“You’re supposed to use that to discover what you like to do,” Draco said. He sounded hurt about it, which didn’t make any sense at all.
"Well," Draco said, taking a long, stuttering breath as Harry nipped at the inside of his thigh, teasing his way lower and lower still.
"I suppose we ought to choose where we’re going first," She looked to Harry, lips pursed. "How about Roger’s? Draco said—"
“That might be what happiness feels like, to you,” Harry sighed.  “Hold on to that.”
Draco held up a finger, and Harry hushed.
"It actually wasn't such a hassle, Molly. Grimmauld isn't unplottable anymore."
"He dances here. I've never visited."
it—just as hard as he did. It was a new thought to occur that someone he wanted might want him back every bit as badly.
"What am I supposed to do?" He growled the question at Draco, as though the affront was somehow his fault. Harry plucked a single thin serviette from the silver container on the table and held it out to him. It was like waving a red flag at a charging bull.
Harry nodded begrudgingly. Hermione looked positively chuffed as she scratched at the parchment, seemingly satisfied with the flow of ink from the quill as she began to write.
He sucked in a ragged breath and complied, a tired slump to his shoulders as he pulled his feet up to the seat of his chair and wrapped his arms around bony knees, staring at Harry over their knobby tops.
, Draco had told him when he said that, ever-pleased with how the word sounded.
he'd actually have to put into his
"You're doing it again," Draco said, "going somewhere in your mind. Go ahead, if you're going to tell me off about being me, here's your chance."
"Flattery will get you everywhere," Draco scoffed, turning to him. His gloss smelled like frosting, and Harry stole a kiss to taste it; him. "Ready?"
Draco gave a little
"Maybe a Pepper-Up Potion is called for to get you back to speed," Harry said. He looked up into Malfoy's face, which was a mistake, because even wet, perhaps especially when wet, it was a face to behold. Water glossed his lips and glued his lashes together into dark golden spikes. Sure, he looked hazy and exhausted, but under that was the austere framework, the delicate bone structure so rare and eye-catching. It was unfair that Malfoy had become so pretty since the trials. Or had he always been pretty, and Harry had simply been too busy to notice?
"Don’t apologize to me, please don’t do that. I'm not angry, but I'm also not equipped for this. Neither are you. It's high time we accepted that."
"Clever."
"I was up two stone, three years ago, so I
"Er. Surprise?"
A wave of nausea swept up within Harry, knocking the words from his mouth. He swallowed it back but couldn't break Malfoy's stare, couldn't look away from the train wreck that was his life.
"You've had eighty-seven good days, and tomorrow it’s going to be eighty-eight."
"Is that so," Andromeda said, her chin quivering with the effort to hold back a grin that was too self-satisfied for Harry's liking. He rolled his eyes at her.
Justin
. We've thought it all through for you so you can simply accept what I'm saying and relax."
The box shuddered to a jolt as the calm female voice announced his destination.
"Good. We'll be taking two children from the same hospital complex. The director was lovely."
"And?" He chanced it with a mid-sized bite. A full slice of tomato snuck into his mouth with it. That’d keep him busy while Draco spoke, hopefully for as long as it took for any of what he was saying to make sense.
"It was a very favourable article." Draco waved him off. He was grumpy about the renewed attention focused on him in the magical media, however slight.
"Because maybe that way we'll have a chance in hell of finishing before we make it to the top," he said to Draco's delight, judging by his snorted laughter.
It was so bright that Harry had to squint to see. He cupped his hands to make a cap-brim over his eyes.
“You say weeping, I say a fistula causing fluid leakage, but yes, in a nutshell.”
Draco's free hand pushed Harry's face back into the wood, holding him by his neck, not slipping as Harry knew he wanted to those few inches up and into his hair. When he took the pressure off, and Harry kept his face close to the surface, the little clouds of fog appearing and disappearing again, that was when Draco slapped Harry's left arse cheek and then held on, kneading it firmly.
"Halloween," Harry supplied, but that only drew questioning stares from both her and Luna and Harry quickly followed with a, "never mind," to keep them from prying into the details of that night and the ensuing morning.
"Not at all," Draco said. "You're doing a terrible job of it yourself, mind you. All this,
"You taste nice," he said, voice raspy.
When he opens them, the light in the further corner of the kitchen is out. His cock jumps as a flare of anger pulses through him to see the bulb darkened grey.
"Stop it, both of you stop it right now!" she yelled, eyes resolutely on Ron. "We're all running a little, um,
Harry heaved, pushing the final block to meet Draco at the front doors to his building. He stood there, pulling a foot up behind him by the opposite hand, stretching not just until his trainer was level with his arse but up, up, until it was nearly in line with his shoulder.
"Yeah?"
"Har-old!"
"Where'd you run to?" Harry kept his tone light, giving in to one of his only-somewhat-secret pleasures—sitting to piss while tired. It had the added benefit of giving him a continued vantage point to watch Draco's form through the shower curtain, only the edges of his body visible in the foggy white space.
Draco looked perfectly content; white ribbons of hair stuck to his forehead as he went a high pink—Harry had him nearly incoherent. He kept one finger inside, pulsing gently in and out as he leaned down to kiss him.
"I wish I could disappear on Victory Day, but everyone wants me to be there so when the speeches end they know who to turn to while they're clapping." He played with the dregs in his cup, grains of tea-leaves mucking up the bottom of the mug. When he looked up, Draco was staring at him. "What do you do for it?"
He stopped crunching and swallowed, ears pricked. "What do you mean? You knew about this?"
The second time Harry awoke it was to a cold and dry expanse, Draco's side of the bed still empty. He blinked into the room, the quality of light sneaking in from under the curtains unchanged, which meant that the sun hadn't yet gone down over London. Fumbling for his glasses, he noted the sound of rain against the windowpanes to his right, the shower running in the other room, down the hall.
"We'll go slow." He was good to his word and pressed, slowly, lost in wonder as he slid one finger back into the tightness already squeezing around one of Cissy's.
How was he meant to do this? Just talk to him? Like he hadn’t wanked himself raw thinking of all the various ways they could go from verbal sparring to duelling to, well, some tussling that would naturally lead to incredible sex if Harry’s cock had any say in the matter.
The silence that followed held the space for Harry to apologize. He didn't.
"There's lasagne under a stasis charm for you in the kitchen. Ask, and Kreacher will bring it up to you."
thrumming through him,
"James," Harry offered the fake name without a second thought, going for a quick handshake.
"Excuse me, it was
"No need. Sorry to ruin the mood—we can still go—out, I mean. Now that I’m all fixed up and gorgeous again.” He gave Harry a little smile, but his eyes were pleading.
"What?"
Draco didn't finish the thought, and Harry didn't ask as he started to give him the kind of head he used to only dream of. With Draco, it seemed, there was sex, and there was breakfast. Apparently, it was going to take a lot more than Harry's foolproof puppy-dog eyes to convince him that the twain should ever meet.
“Noted," the witch replied, her voice onerous, nearly bored. "While we're talking looks, Harry, what’s your type? Blink once for blonds."
Harry nodded and held his tongue.
"Fine, I'll leave you to rot next time," Harry said acidly. "Go do whatever the fuck it is you do all day. You don't owe me anything. We don't have to do—this—again," Harry waved a dismissive hand.
Harry wanted to call his bluff, but his heart raced and his own prick responded to the possibility that Draco was telling the truth.
"There. Just like that," his voice was hushed but full of emotion. "Like you liked me. Like you wanted to devour me whole. Grass-snake green. I wanted you to look at me and see through all the bluster, and know how badly I wished we could be friends and more than that, and that was impossible, clearly."
"Why bother coming then?"
Miranda shook her head, bemused by his interest. Harry didn't recognize her, but she couldn't be new‚ considering she hadn't commented on his Harry Potter-ness yet.
"To be honest, by then, I’d broken my one rule, which was no injectables. I know that the ceremony was on the grounds, and I wore black."
"Well, I'll have you know that Harry Potter gets a bit nervous in places like this," he said gently. "Where it's a little dark, and when he doesn't know the floor plan of a building, and its escape routes. Though the lack of a crowd is refreshing."
. Dark wizards and witches abounded, and the neo-Death Eater movement was gaining ground in all the important ways. It couldn’t have been easy to be a beacon of light when the world around grew ever dimmer.
Harry realized.
Draco was silent, so Harry continued on. "I won a tenner off Ron from that song."
"Sort of," Harry hedged. He couldn't walk the whole statement back now. But he could attempt some damage control. He wasn't drunk, and yet the word-vomit had come.
"I'd probably find it funnier if my entire back wasn't peeling off in one large sheet," Harry grumbled, siphoning up the mess at his feet as Ron dried the countertops. A little shove turned into a hex, and the next they knew it, they were both on the floor, breathless, slightly bruised, but laughing. A simple
"Are you alright, mate?"
of. Looking, searching for a facsimile of the blond he wanted. Examining their mouths, clicking, clicking, clicking in hopes of finding someone with a sharp little snaggletooth. Pausing videos mid-frame to judge the tone and cut and quality of their hair.
Harry gasped at the added feeling of fingertips, nails precisely long enough scratch into his scalp as Draco gripped a tuft of his hair tightly.
"There was a crack—someone was there, and Apparated away. A photographer, I bet," Harry said, and Ron scratched something down. "Likely on staff or does spec work for WWN or The Prophet, considering they had it on-air so bloody fast. No one else I could see. I checked basic diagnostics and no Dark magic was at play, at least not the common kind. But there was something he said, it—"
Draco pushed at his knee, a genuine smile on his face as he crawled up the bed to Harry, disrobing and slipping, naked, under the covers.
charm lending it a booming quality that shook the dust from the rafters. Harry groaned, stuffing another wonderful little birds nest biscuit into his mouth.
The numbers and the words meaning the same thing to him, until everything summed up neatly, just the way Draco liked it. To an infinity that was also nothing, to
"I bet that's why you fucked me through the headboard. So I wouldn't forget it." Harry opened his mouth to complain but stopped short. Draco's eyes lit up when Harry didn't scold him. He thought he was gaining the upper hand and clearly liked it.
"You could fuck me just like this," Harry gasped, the fingertip still pressing slow circles around the rim.
"Sticky fingerprints," Draco said when he read the card. "Robards knows how to woo you nearly as well as I do."
“What are you on about?” Harry threw his robe onto the bed on the left while Malfoy walked to his on the right. “You’d think someone would have noticed over the years if the Lead Potions Corporal were illiterate.”
Draco tossed the jacket to Harry, knowing full well that after years of snapping his hand out to grab the tiniest thing whizzing past him, he'd have no choice but to catch it.
tell me what to do about Draco," she hissed. "As soon as the Firecall came, I came. My son wouldn't be here if he wasn't consorting with you, and now who knows what's happened to him, pain potions are hardly doing a thing—"
"Are you going to finish that, Harry?" Luna asked. Empty plates and packets were piled beside her, previously holding warm nuts and prawn cocktail flavoured crisps. Harry pushed his unfinished plate of food towards Luna, as was their usual routine.
"You're one to talk," Draco grumbled, but Harry shushed him, and for once, he didn't argue.
"I guess so. You should tell the Weasley's to draw up another chair." He wiggled his brows mischievously. "A Malfoy is coming for dinner."
"I’m sorry this isn’t going to be easier. But we can help you convince Draco about what really happened. Can't we, Ron?"
There was a creep, too, of what was shared. The conjured mirrors that started to pop up more often during sex were quickly replaced with the real-deal, placed unassumingly along the walls in each bedroom, but often summoned so that Harry could watch. He stuttered and warmed when he brought up this newly discovered fetish during a therapy session—another new thing—though his Healer had simply gone wide-eyed and said, sagely, "Ah yes—the act of observation can be very erotic," and waited for him to continue. He had started talking about things that had previously been off-limits. His guilt, which felt limitless. His sadness, some of which he'd never admitted to himself even existed. Sex, and emotional intimacy, and in that way he almost, almost, talked about Draco too.
“Weeks ‘go,” Harry gestured with a hand, then washed it over his face. The rolling of the bed-boat worsened. “Saved all that time on Ron’s present, so I got you lots. But I can’t wrap them nice, and Kreacher’sbusy, y’know? So—I’ll ask Kreacher tomorrow.” He nodded to accentuate the point.
"Of course, my potion really works," Draco grumbled before added airily, "I dreamt that I won buckets of money at a casino."
"What are you doing?" Harry spoke into his shoulder.
"Alright," he said, "best get on that right quick. Fancy a pick-up game sometime soon? The boys would love to have you on as Seeker."
. Or maybe he'd noticed the pitch of his thoughts shifting to whatever they sounded like when he was peeved. Draco didn't frown, though—he smiled a little. Dangerously.
“I wasn’t staring,” Harry said, though when he looked in Draco’s face and away again, his eyes decided to land very unhelpfully on his crotch, where the outline of his prick was clearly hanging to the left, and then his hands, hands in leather gloves that Harry was fast developing a

“Considering you’re something of an expert on vomiting, you’re such a baby about it,” Harry chided. Draco accepted the bowl on his lap, thumbs rubbing the gold filigree rim.
, Draught of Peace," he said, trying his luck. Relief flooded his veins when a brown glass vial popped off the shelf and into his open palm.
