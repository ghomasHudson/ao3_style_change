It was neither. Mad-Eye and some other unknown people were stood outside his door. They explained nothing but insisted he pack up his trunk. While not particularly interested, he did as he was told and followed them outside. Hedwig took off into the night sky while one of the strangers took his trunk and disapperated.
"Confirm for me that Potter is your soulmate?" Pansy asked quickly. She sounded almost giddy.
Harry frowned. Creature inheritance? It made sense but he also still knew absolutely nothing about it. Where it had come from was also a mystery. He got up and walked over to the window, idly stroking Hedwig as he looked down at the street below. He knew the Leaky Cauldron was magically altered, but it still amazed him how he could be in the same spot looking down as twelve other rooms. A slight movement caught his eye across the street, barely concealed by an alleyway. He raised an eyebrow at the dog. It had clearly followed him.
"How are you still standing?" the blond asked, his voice barely above a whisper.
Draco scowled at him before flipping over his left hand to look at the words carved into it.
He rolled his eyes. Of course Sirius wanted him to bring Malfoy. He'd have a blast antagonizing the son of a deatheater. He hit his head on the stone wall behind him. The Hogwarts rumour mill didn't help with being the centre of attention. As if he needed the help in the first place. Stupid people had nothing better to do. He was just a boy who didn't die as a baby. He had no say in it. Random fluke of nature. Or magic. Now he was soulmates with the enemy. He hit his head again. Could he ever have a quiet year at Hogwarts? Would everything always be so bloody dramatic? He bashed his head for a third time. It only sort of hurt.
Draco folded the letter and crossed his arms. Harry had said he'd been abused in the half-alive place. Why would Dumbledore allow the golden boy to live with abusive muggles? Why did he have to live amongst muggles at all? Harry looked over at him.
Harry nearly jumped out of his skin, glaring at his soulmate who was casually stroking Hedwig.
Harry frowned. R.J.
"You can't Harry. We need to get you checked out."
He huffed. "Yes, it's from Lupin. He'll meet us in Hogsmeade though I am leaving the actual explaining up to you. Preferably without telling him that the ministry employee that my godfather already hates has made me carve words into my flesh. I'd really like for him to remain a wrongfully convicted criminal, not an actual one."
"No," Draco replied. "I haven't slept yet."
"You contacted the minister about Umbridge and he agreed to see you?"
"No idea. Clearly fate was drunk. We're literally pawns on opposite sides of a chess board."
"Are we supposed to sleep on the same bed?"
Hermione walked over and flopped onto the bed beside him, her eyes most definitely on the wings and not him. She reached out and tried to touch them. He shivered as if he'd walked through a ghost. That was different. He hadn't felt a thing when he'd touched them.
"Well no. I contacted the minister and asked if I could discuss an urgent matter. He's friends with my father, Harry. A man who has a lot of connections within the ministry. He was hardly going to deny meeting with me."
Weasley glanced at Harry. "You wouldn't need my wand to do that, you bloody show off. Why's the ferret here?"
As she took his hand to prove a point, she felt something in his skin. Before he could stop her, she pulled his hand closer and stared at the writing carved into his flesh. He yanked his hand back and started to walk away. She followed him and pulled him to a stop just outside the portrait hole.
Sirius huffed again. "Not actually a bloody criminal, Moony. Being blamed for the actions of a rat."
"Do we still have firewhiskey?" he asked.
"You're thinking too loudly," he grumbled. "Shh!"
"Kreacher is alone in the house, sir. He been hearing nothing from the guest room."
Harry looked up at him with an eyebrow raised. "I don't, though technically the one prediction made about me in class did happen to be true. Sirius's animagus form looked like the grim. However, that wasn't what I was thinking about. You don't have any robes, Draco. Does the potion's master provide them for you?"
"No?" Harry sighed. "Do you need me to say it? I want you." The words were so much easier than Harry had thought, a pleasure to say, in fact and so he said them again: "I want you. I want you to touch me. I'm so tired of denying it, Draco." Harry's voice caught on Malfoy's given name, a little hitch in the middle, but it made Malfoy's fingers fumble the billiard ball; he had to brace himself, both hands on the edge of the billiard table. His back was a rigid arch. His hair and the back of his neck glowed in the soft light.
Harry swirled the brandy around the glass, not knowing what to say. "I may stay with Sirius a while or I may take my own house. I do not know."
"Draco," Lucius said, frowning, "Draco, what are you…"
The tension in the air thickened.
He had never done this before and therefore tried to imitate what Draco had just done to him. He licked the tip, pushing back the foreskin to explore, making his lips a round O to cover his teeth. Draco gasped and his hips jerked forward; Harry let him. Draco pulled his head, Harry pulled Draco's hips in turn and a quick stuttering rhythm was established, Harry choking a little at times but never pulling away. He closed his eyes to focus on the scent and the heat of Draco filling his senses and when Draco's cries became more hoarse, he felt maddened by the idea of Draco filling his mouth with seed.
"She was something to see, was she not?" Harry said almost to himself.
“Yes, your beloved Ron,” Draco broke in. “The person you chose to befriend at Hogwarts instead of me.”
He followed Malfoy through the foyer into what seemed to be a parlour done in a shoddy attempt at the fashionable style for Greek Revival. The parlour was up a staircase and through a long corridor, and there were almost a dozen young men inside in various states of dishabille, sipping on green drinks and smoking fit to fill the entire room with heavy fog. Filch walked in behind them and closed the door even as the boys variously greeted Malfoy, some as "my lord" and some with mere nods. It was clear that Malfoy knew all of them.
"Of course," Sirius said. "We shall hope to hear from you very soon."
“So noted. Bailiffs, bring the Pensieve through.”
"Harry does have some very sophisticated tastes, Father," Draco chimed in.
"Of course," Harry said at once. His pulse quickened a little as he tried to imagine what conclusions Remus might have reached, what conjecture he might have heard.
Feeling at a disadvantage from his position on the floor, Harry stood, righting his clothes. "Draco, what would you have me do? I am married, I am a father, I have responsibilities and you knew all of that long before now."
then set aside in pursuit of his desire. His love may have changed over the years but he could not deny that he had owed her his duty and had failed her.
"Yes, Father," was all Draco seemed able to say.
“Lucius won’t let Draco condemn himself in court. I don’t know what they might have outside that.”
Harry sent the owl and promptly decided to pack up the things he'd had when he first came to take this hotel room. He somehow could not bear to touch any of Draco's clothes, or the numerous, impulsive things Draco bought whenever they went anywhere –a watch chain decorated with silver Muggle coins of differing sizes which had so fascinated him by their unfamiliar shapes. Pocket squares of unusual materials and colours covered the dressing table where Draco had charmed them all to take the form of animals and dance.
“I do,” Draco looked awkward. “There are some I could look to for favours, but Harry, they would expect certain things in return and I…”
Hermione tried to smile again, but this time her eyes were sad.
Ginny smiled. "I was, was I not?"
"Rosie's been letting you have quiet time?" Ron asked, amused. "That's rare."
Hermione sent him an owl the next day with a list of ingredients and a stern instruction to bring them as early in the morning as he could. Harry took a moment to imagine darting around Diagon Alley like a criminal, fearful of whom he might see around every corner and asked Dobby to go for him instead.
"No, indeed, you have always been much kinder than I."
Back in the sanctuary of their rooms, Harry took Draco’s face in his hands. “How do you feel? Now that you have broken with him?”
Harry was all at once exhausted just from standing. “Quite right. Best you go now. Thank you, Goyle.”
"Malfoy." The name fell out of Harry's mouth without his having made a conscious decision to speak.
Harry inhaled deeply at this, relief and hurt mingling. It was then, at last, that he laid his face on the table and began to weep while his wife, to whom he had caused so much hurt, did her best to console him.
Potter was staring at him now with what from anyone else he might consider a calculating look. “Well, all right, then,” he said. “But only because I wanted to do it again anyway.”
"I know that you enjoy the popular entertainments yourself, Lord Malfoy," Harry said, desperate to ease the tension somehow. "After all, who from the highest lord in the land to the meanest servant does not regard Quidditch as the finest sport ever devised?"
"Harry, don't panic," Draco said, soothing him with a touch. "He may know, he may not, but either way I would like you to sit with them, talk with them."
In two strides, Harry was across the room with his hands on Malfoy pulling him upright, pulling him bodily into a kiss. Harry's hands found their way down Malfoy's body, curving into the small of his back with a thumb tracing the line of his spine, the other hand resting on the curve of his buttocks. Harry groaned and pulled Malfoy harder against him.
Harry's heart ached when he saw the hurt pass through the blondes eyes. Draco retracted his hand and smiled apologetically "I'm sorry, instinct. Are you alright?" He asked.
He sighed and grabbed the bottle of fire whiskey from the other night, this should numb it for the rest of the night. Draco was only really a social drinker and tended to ignore or bury his problems rather than anything else but... he couldn't do that this time. Within an hour he'd drained the rest of the bottle and was sat at his desk. He was writing - somewhat ineligibly - in his journal about the whole situation, as he had been doing since his feelings blossomed all those years ago, when there was a knock on his door.
Harry sighed and sat back as he rode on the Hogwarts Express. He'd soon be back at the school he knew better than any battle ground he'd fought on. He'd only been back once since the war, just after everything had been rebuilt and Hogwarts was back to her original glory. It was almost as if the war had never happened there. Almost.
Harry clenched his fists, that struck a nerve "Fuck you Malfoy!" he yelled before slamming the door behind him and making his way back into his rooms. His chest ached, he couldn't even trust his ears anymore.
Draco's heart ached a little, Harry didn't think he was ever a bad person. Draco wasn't so sure but it did make him happy to hear. It was sad that Harry felt as if people couldn't be trusted, though Draco didn't blame him.
Draco took a deep breath and closed his eyes shaking the memories from his mind "Thank you for your statement in the trials. Without you I'd have been sent to Azkaban with my father" he said.
Harry let a sad smile spread across his face as he stared intently at the drinks in front of him, his chest tightened "To trust you" he clarified.
Draco froze in Harry's arms, it almost looked as if there was fear in his eyes "Can you let go of me?" He asked, voice merely a whisper, it didn't sound like he meant it though. No, Harry was imagining that, wishful thinking.
In all honesty Harry wanted to be done with fighting for his life, he'd been doing so for all his 25 years and for once he just wanted to settle down and live a nice quiet life of a teacher, however if the curse of the DADA professor is true he wouldn't be living such a safe and quiet life.
Draco bit his lip, he didn't have the strength to deny him. He nodded and pulled Harry in for another kiss, this one was softer. Kind and slow. If Harry needed a break then he was going to be shown how wonderful it could be. If only he was really here, if only Draco was sure he really wanted this.
Harry let a small smile spread over his lips for the first time that day, he wondered if he could catch the Slytherin off guard "That's yet to be decided" he said, revelling in the small amount of shock on Malfoy's face, before disappearing off into his rooms.
Harry hummed before slowly pulling away "You have no idea what you're getting yourself into" he whispered.
Harry stepped into the moonlight and smiled sheepishly "Sorry to disturb you" he said hiding something behind his back.
Harry was still really pissed at Draco. He only wanted to help and he had to go and act like a git as usual, on the brightside Harry's budding feelings for Draco were gone.
He didn't look back to see Malfoy's reaction as he made his way to the Grand Hall to be welcomed by headmistress Minerva McGonagall. She was to give everyone their schedules for the week before school started as well as introduce everyone to new coworkers.
Harry frowned, opening his eyes and pouting at the blonde man "I didn't mean it like that Draco. You're often brilliant I just had no idea where you were going with it" he said.
Draco shrugged, suddenly he wasn't bothered? "Maybe in passing, like if one were to contemplate the existence of mythical creatures" he said, completely calm.
(Draco's POV)
Within a few moments Harry was fast asleep, Draco scooped him into his arms and carried the slumbering Gryffindor into his bedroom "You can have my bed tonight, darling" he whispered. He gently laid Harry down, covering him with the blanket and tucked him in.
Malfoy raised an eyebrow at him "Once thought? Has your opinion on me changed?" he asked with genuine curiosity
They all died because of me. If I had been better, if I tried harder, if I trained more, they could still be alive. If I wasn't such a stupid boy and I'd listened to what people told me. If I had just died when I was supposed to.
Harry frowned and shook his head "What in Merlin's name are you talking about?" He asked, not sure what he meant by that.
He heard a hushed curse word and a few shuffling sounds before the door opened a crack, showing a rather heart breaking sight. Harry stood there robes hanging off of him haphazardly, glasses nowhere to be seen, eyes red and puffy as if he'd been crying and hair a complete mess. More than usual.
Harry chuckled and nodded in agreement "No matter what this will always be home" he said looking around. At first when he met Luna he didn't believe in these "Nargles" she'd always complain about but through the years of knowing Luna he's found things have gone missing and turned up in the strangest of places and he had to admit he did have some belief that they do exist even if there is little to no evidence.
Draco breathed raggedly "You don't know what you're doing Harry" he muttered.
It was dangerous to think like that, with no inhibitions who knew what Harry would blurt out. He moved a little closer, somewhat subconsciously, he wanted Draco's undivided attention. When the blonde looked back over he couldn't help but smile "Your eyes are pretty" he said quietly. They were like tiny silver halos in his eyes, he was far more angelic than a human should be allowed to be.
Harry seemed to hesitate for a moment before shaking his head again "It's nothing, I'll see you later Malfoy" he said before hopping back onto his broom and kicking off of the ground, propelling himself into the air and disappearing into the distance.
Draco smiled sympathetically and stood aside "Come in, I'll make some camomile tea. Feel free to light the fire and make yourself comfortable" he said.
SHUT UP HARRY
~~~~~~
Luna smiled and nodded "Dear Harry, yes I did indeed. They were in the astronomy tower could you believe it?" she asked rhetorically.
Harry blushed furiously as he made his way away from the courtyard and back to his rooms. As soon as he got in he sat on the couch and took a deep breath "What the bloody hell was that Harry?" he asked himself, shards of hysteria evident in his voice. He rubbed his hands over his face knocking his glasses askew. He fixed them and put his Marauders Map on the coffee table.
Draco raised an eyebrow at the man "What is?" He asked.
Draco blushed, that made Harry's heart race, and shook his head "You're drunk" he said.
Draco smiled at him "I hope we can become friends someday" he admitted.
Suddenly the events of yesterday evening replayed in his mind and his heart began to race "Hey" Harry said quietly. He was fiddling with the hem of his pyjama shirt and looked as if he didn't really know what he was doing.
Harry shook his head and made his way back to his rooms so he could start his lesson plans before he had to go back to the Grand Hall for training. He turned the corner with his smile still playing on his lips and almost run into Malfoy.
Luna sighed and nodded "I'm sorry I just worry" she said quietly.
Harry tore his eyes away and pushed down the worry bubbling up in his chest, leave it be Harry. Once everyone had finished eating, Minerva dismissed us to go get acquainted with our classrooms, Draco dragged his feat as he left the hall, it was like he was on auto-pilot. Harry buried the urge to go after him and walked in silence to his classroom. The quiet of the castle mocked him now, left him with nothing but his conflicting emotions and thoughts. None too soon, Harry reached the doors to his classroom, he took a breath and prepared himself.
Draco laughed dryly "I'm not exactly famous for making good decisions Potter" he said bitterly, he debated asking Harry to leave anyway but he knew it wouldn't make a difference. Draco closed his front door but stood stubbornly where he was, making no move towards his desk, Harry or the food.
Draco nodded sipping his drink, he too had missed the halls and comforting warmth of Hogwarts. Its safe to say terrible things happened to the both of them here however worse things happened elsewhere. Malfoy Manor for example, could no longer be called home to Draco after The Dark Lord tainted it with his presence.
--------
He almost held Draco Malfoy's hand.
Harry just nodded, still looking confused and retrieved the requested items from the kitchen. "I thought you needed help with the N.E.W.T.s not a guinea pig for new potion" Harry grumbled warily as he set the glasses and bowl of sugar cubes down on the table in front of Draco.
Draco nodded without hesitation "Both times, yes" he confirmed. Harry visibly relaxed a little "So everything you said last night was real?" he asked.
Draco signed "Harry" he said walking after him. Harry ignored him and walked faster. Draco frowned, jogging to catch up to him and grabbed Harry's wrist to stop him "Harry wait" he said.
Everything would be so much easier if they still hated each other. Harry woke up a little while ago, he was laying atop the covers on his bed. He'd almost been sure he'd dreamt everything from last night but it was too real, and there were still glasses and sugar cubes on the table. Draco was no where to be seen.
He looked back up at Draco and the blonde almost choked. With Harry sat there, hair all over the place, cheeks flushed and lips irresistibly pink and moist. Draco cleared his throat and looked away, taking another sip of his drink.
Harry smiled a little, if he didn't know any better he'd think that Mr Malfoy was jealous. Of course that was impossible, but the thought was too tantalising to ignore. Harry nodded and leaned against the wall "I did thank you, she's quite marvellous company. I was helping Luna look for her shoes and we had a nice conversation about Hogwarts" he said watching Draco's expression sour.
"Draco Malfoy you are strong, and good and determined. You can have whatever life you want. Fight for it, fight for what you deserve" Harry said, voice calm and gentle and genuine.
He sat next to Luna and smiled at her "Dear Luna, did you find your shoes?" he asked. Subtly watching Draco's reaction as he talked with Luna.
Luna smiled wider and twirled away "Oh this will be so very fun" she said before skipping away "See you later Harry!" she called as she left him standing in the hall smiling at his nutty friend.
Harry hummed in agreement "That it has, thank you" he said genuinely. Draco really was quite incredible when you thought about it.
Malfoy nodded and smiled his usual charming smirk "Of course Minerva, I think it's safe to say petty childhood squabbles were left behind after... After the war" he said the last part rather uncomfortably, Harry could understand that, it wasn't a fond memory for anyone.
The Hanged Man - Reversed
Draco bolted upright and rushed into the room to see Harry curled tightly around himself, he was shaking and crying.
Draco breathed raggedly "You don't know what you're doing Harry" he muttered.
"What's with the face Potter?" Malfoy asked with an amused smirk playing on his lips.
Draco raised an eyebrow at the man "What is?" He asked.
Harry walked back into the room and raised his eyebrows in surprise "We'll need some glasses and sugar cubes" Draco simply stated, sitting down on the loveseat and fiddling with some intricate looking contraption. Where in the world did that come from?
He pulled on a lighter more casual set of robes before making his way out of his rooms. Walking through this school brought back many memories for Draco. He smiled and stopped at the courtyard. He could almost see himself, Blaise and Pansy laughing together under the tree. He made his way into the courtyard and sat on the stone bench, despite the fact that it was late August it was still really warm out even after the sun went down.
Neville smiled warmly at him and absently played with Hannah's hand "Morning Harry" he greeted in his regular cheery demeanor.
She looked at him with a soft knowing smile and the flood gates opened. He collapsed onto his knees and his eyes flooded with tears. Ever since he and Ginny broke up, Ron had barely spoken to him and as much as Hermione tried to be there for him she had a baby on the way, so Luna was the only one he was able to open up to. She had a way to see straight through him.
They decided rather than let this ruin their marriage they'd work through it together and fill their want of children by working at Hogwarts and eventually maybe adoption. It was obvious to everyone how much they loved each other and made each other better, Harry both envied and respected that.
Harry took a deep breath and paced back and forth waiting for his friend to open her door. After what felt like a lifetime with nothing but his thoughts the door finally opened.
Luna hummed melodically and swung their hands together as they walked down the halls "You know, no matter what happens here, Hogwarts will still be beautiful. It just had this warm, gentle energy that welcomes you" she said distantly before pausing "Like gravy" she added.
Harry nodded slowly and hugged Draco back letting himself be held.
Harry shook his head and wrapped his arms around Draco's neck "Just give me this one evening, just one night where I don't have to be Harry Potter - the boy who lived. I just want to be Harry. Just one night" he almost begged. He finally had something worth hanging on to, even for only a night.
Harry lifted his head slowly and frowned at the Slytherin, why did that bother him so much? "What makes you think I'm joking?" He asked.
Harry nodded and smiled the same smile he wore last night "What brings you out here at this time of night?" he asked slowly, taking a few steps further into the courtyard.
Draco sighed and opened his eyes "Silence is golden" he said softly "Too bad it doesn't last very long" he said a little begrudgingly as he looked around for the source of the voice.
Draco nodded, Harry smirked then, this could be his chance to mess with the Slytherin. Oh how he loved to catch the blonde man off guard "Hell in another world we could have even been lovers" he said bluntly.
Luna smiled fondly at him "How was his reaction when you told him I was spoken for?" She asked curiously.
Draco shook his head, it was so strange. He was sleeping soundly and then there was banging on his door. He ignored it before hearing Harry unlock his door and call for him again. He climbed out of bed and found a panicked topless Harry standing in his front room.
Harry softened and nodded, the air of razor sharp broken glass around him turned to his regular sad emotional wall. "It's fine, I should deal with my PTSD better" he said quietly.
Luna smiled her usual airy smile and pressed a kiss on Harry's cheek before sitting beside him "Dear Harry, how are you this morning?" she asked placing her hand on his forearm.
"Merlin I'm so sor-" Harry's words caught in his throat when his eyes locked with the piercing blue ones he'd become addicted to.
He heard Harry take a few more steps before stopping in front of him "May I join you? Nowhere else catches the moonlight softly like the courtyard" he asked in a small voice. It wasn't a voice Draco would have imagined coming from the legendary Harry Potter but it oddly suited him quite well. It was a nice reminder that Harry is still a regular wizard with limitations.
Draco nodded a little surprised, the Harry Potter, saviour and star of Gryffindor, loved Slytherin colours. He nodded in thanks to Harry before taking a swig of the burning alcohol. Harry downed the whole double of whiskey with ease and poured himself another. Draco raised an eyebrow but didn't question him, instead he finished his glass and Harry poured him another
Draco's heart fluttered "Try not to sound so surprised Potty, I'm not completely useless" he said teasingly.
Harry scoffed again and looked at the glass in his hand "You're kidding right? What is it even supposed to do? Other than taste like liquorice candy" He asked before looking up, his head lolled a bit and his pupils dilated. "Oh.." he trailed off.
He mentally slapped himself and looked at his hands "I gotta go" he muttered before quickly walking away, towards the fields. He needed air.
Luna poured the swirling purple-ish liquid into the two glasses before holding one up.
Harry sighed again and did as he was told, he blew on the liquid to cool it down before draining the cup of its contents. Harry smiled a little, Luna had added camomile. She knew it was Harry's favourite and helped calm him.
Harry hesitated before sitting down next to Draco "That's a lot to ask y'know" he said, pulling his glasses out of his pocket and putting them on. His eyes looked a little brighter now.
Harry frowned at her "Okay now I'm kind of scared" he mumbled.
He didn't care.
Tears streamed down his face as he kissed the man before him, bittersweet was the only word he could use to describe the scene. Harry wrapped his arms around Draco's neck, that was encouraging. Harry wasn't drunk, Harry was sober, he actually wanted this.
"Greetings everyone, I'm so pleased to see you all here today" Minerva started "As you can see there have been some additions to our staff and I'm pleased to announce that, our own Mr Potter, Mr Malfoy and Miss Lovegood have joined us as professors. I'd be pleased to see you all working together and treating everyone here as family" she said looking directly at Malfoy and Harry for the last part.
Draco sighed and sat down in his chair "Good" he mumbled, putting his head in his hands.
"He apologised to me. Not just a half arsed one either, he made it very clear that he was sorry and made sure I didn't take any of the blame" Harry said resting his head on his knees "That's what happened just before you found me in the tower and did my reading" he said looking back up at his friend.
At the time, Draco hadn’t been overly interested. “Really? Good lord, Pans, for anyone in particular?”
"Do you ever wish," Harry said suddenly, "that you'd tried for the Harpies again?"
Harry arrived at the Hog's Head just after lunch, having Apparated to Hogsmeade.
“You don’t even remember, do you? Me trying to introduce myself on the train.”
Ginny smiled at him, sadly, but her shoulders straightened a little from their slump and she reached out to him. “The children love you, Harry. They’ll always love you. And you’ll always be their father.”
Harry sank down to the couch and buried his face in his hands.
He emerged from the Pensive heartsick and raging. He rounded on the real Blaise at once, reaching for his wand – but Blaise, ever-cool, had anticipated this and raised his own to Harry’s throat. However, Blaise didn’t see the fist coming; wizards often had that weakness, never anticipating actual physical violence.
"They are nothing but trouble," Harry said, holding Ginny tightly. "And tomorrow we will be rid of them."
Sirius' mouth twisted.  "Far more severe than that, Harry."  Sirius paused for a moment.  It seemed as though he was struggling to go on, emotion choking him.  "They…  They had me taken to Azkaban."
Harry swallowed hard. "He killed himself?"
"This is a different angle. Takes practice, Potter," Draco said, looking up at him.
Potter huffed out a laugh. “Don’t lie, you quoted it at me last night. All that stupid sex-god stuff.”
Harry was after Malfoy in a matter of moments, through the door he had stepped through, out into the corridor and after a moment's thought, into the billiard room.
Draco returned the kiss, but softly. "What will you do today?"
Lucius immediately snapped to attention. He had gone for purple robes that day. Positively flamboyant, Harry thought. He was probably going to have a wild party that night to celebrate his victory. “Minister, I object—”
Draco relaxed a little at that, but Harry's mind had made the next logical step. "There have been many for you, I suppose." In fact he knew; it could hardly have been more obvious.
He did not dare name the perversion that had come upon him, this curling tendril of something
Harry would have given a different answer had he fully resolved to lie to himself. "I cannot." He laughed, hollow. "I remember when I was strong enough to do whatever needed to be done but somehow you have infiltrated all my defences."
Draco was already there, sitting at a table reading the
Arthur and Molly were usually effusive in the extreme when Harry and Ginny arrived. Harry could hardly pretend at surprise that their reception on this occasion was cooler, albeit cordial.
"It is," Harry said, certain of that if he was certain of nothing else in his life.
Draco snorted. "Do you think that because I am unmarried I never hear of the topic? Quite the opposite, I assure you. Mother nags me endlessly about choosing a bride, starting a family. She and Father both wish me to marry and of course I shall have to, I suppose. But I could never love a woman, or wish to lie with her. I never did care for a single girl in the world."
Ginny seemed surprised by the question. "Not for long. He tried to charm me but it was so obviously insincere that I wonder he went to the trouble."
~o0o~
"Feed it to me," Draco said, sticking out his tongue. The sight he made was filthy, wanton and depraved, and Harry moaned, opening his mouth to let Draco's come slide from his own tongue to his lover's. Draco sucked on his tongue, pulling it into his mouth and chasing his own flavour. He moaned into Harry's mouth and writhed a little; Harry's still-hard cock ached.
Ron squeezed Harry’s shoulder. Solid as a rock, the best friend he’d ever had. “We never wanted to be anywhere else, mate. How did you forget?”
He had. He’d got blackout drunk, cornered Potter in the gents’ and…
Afterwards, after Harry was dead, Draco remembered that day. He wasn't certain until he held the wand in his hand, but when the power of it filled him he knew with certainty that he could do this, he could bring Harry back.
“Where is Draco?” Harry interrupted.
. He made an effort to be courteous to Molly even if he no longer always felt warmth towards her. He spent far more time with his children than most of the men he knew. And he missed his wife while it seemed as though she merely wanted him to cut off more and more of himself.
Charlie's arms were full of Lily, but he didn't pause a moment. "I'll just keep this one a while," he said, ignoring the tension in that kind way he had of pretending oblivion.
Draco didn’t question his luck, instead choosing to rush through the main office where the majority of Aurors sat completing paperwork and straight to Potter’s office.
"No, Sirius spoke only of our business affairs. Remus was his proxy."
. Harry knew Draco, the truth and the lies and the reasons.
Harry was not sure what to say in response. "It was Hermione who taught me to think of such things," he demurred, but Sirius shook his head.
Harry's hands felt like lead weights hanging from his body as Malfoy slowly moved his thigh back and forth just a little, just enough to force Harry to catch his breath and close his eyes. His blood was pounding, his mind was scrambled, there was nothing real or solid in the whole world except the jewel-brightness of Malfoy burning into his very soul and when Malfoy pressed a kiss to Harry's jaw Harry at last gave in and with a strangled cry, took Malfoy's head in his hands and plundered his mouth.
“Like the golden snitch?” Sirius clasped Harry’s shoulder in the same fatherly gesture people kept making to him. Perhaps he seemed increasingly in need of propping up.
He did not look behind him as he left the room. Draco made no move to follow but Harry heard the sound of furniture being destroyed as he closed the door to the suite.
"Yes," Harry said, "of course."
"Sirius would be delighted," the man himself said, appearing on the podium to join the conversation. His eyes lit on Remus with that happiness that the two friends always seemed to find in one another's company. "It has been far too long, Moony."
"There is no one road that will make us all happy," he said to himself quietly. Had he grown to be as selfish as Draco in turning away from them?
No one spoke for a while until Narcissa shifted in her chair and offered, "At one time, Draco was taking an interest in that young man, is it not so?"
"It was more difficult after school," Sirius went on.  "We could still see one another, visit, but it was harder to find places to be alone.  We wrote often because we missed each other so terribly.  I was nineteen when my parents discovered us."
. Enthroned in love," he said, a strange smile curving his lips. "Strange choice of name, as it is regarded as so austere." With this he began unwrapping the black silk from around his throat. He pulled the cravat through his fingers, wrapped it around his knuckles and looked up at Harry, who looked from Draco's fingers to his face to his throat, exposed as his collar fell open.
Grey eyes smirked at him. "But of course, Mr Potter. I remember you from school."
"Oh, fuck January." Draco was livid; Harry could barely believe that mere minutes before he'd been contented, purring and bringing Harry pleasure. The divide between them had never been as apparent, never blindsided Harry so completely. "Fuck January, fuck your family and fuck you."
Harry breathed again; Hermione had very neatly cast doubt on everything Kirke had said.
It took a few days for Harry to re-emerge from the hotel room after that night. Draco had been needy and desperate and Harry hardly less so. Their touches had taken on a new urgency, their time together binding them ever more inextricably.
“Ginny!” Harry started before collecting himself. “How nice,” he said, kissing her on the cheek. He found that he meant it; Ginny’s pragmatic toughness had always been a great comfort to him in their early years and he felt a nostalgia for it in light of everything happening with Draco now.
Draco’s memory provided him with a helpful tableau of a Bat-Bogey Hex and he shuddered. “Indeed. Well, none of my business, I know, but…”
"Wonderful," Hermione said, taking the bag of ingredients from him and unpacking them. "You bought more than will be necessary."
Weasley said something else then, something that made Draco's head hurt and his brain spin, and maybe it was a spell and maybe it was just cruelty but it made Draco angry and no one but Harry could ever best Draco when he was angry.
Harry frowned in disapproval – this was precisely the way of dealing with a servant that Hermione campaigned against. However, he had known Sirius speak to Kreacher in much the same way, and made an effort to hide his discomfort.
In the memory, Blaise only hummed and sipped his drink, his attitude as blasé as if Draco was telling him that he intended to purchase a new book. “That is ambitious indeed, Draco.”
“Do you think it will all be like this? Whispers and stray observations?”
"As you say." Harry took a long drink of his brandy. The action did not go unnoticed.
It was stupendously awkward.
He did not mention anything of the kind to Sirius. Remus, who had been married himself, he could have spoken to but Remus was not due to visit town again for many months. Harry wondered if he could bring himself to put such thoughts into writing. It had been some time since he had received a letter from Remus, now that he thought on it. He said as much to Sirius on joining him in the parlour.
"I am the Master of Death," Draco replies matter-of-factly. "And you are coming back to me."
"I'm almost finished," says Draco. His hands are shaking as he opens the phial and pours more of elixir down the body's throat.
Malfoy's eyes flickered up to Harry's face, lingering a moment before returning to his cards. "Zabini, Nott, Mr Harry Potter. Consider yourselves acquainted."
"Because I think we already know that our views are utterly dissimilar," Draco said, reaching for his cravat on the dressing table. "You believe that someone of no wizarding family, who has never studied our traditions, who had no knowledge of our culture until they were already more than halfway to being of age," Draco's fingers tugged angrily at his cravat, belying his cool tone. "We play with Muggle things perhaps but we have culture of our own – art and literature and music, families and etiquette. Is that all meaningless? Should someone who has never known these things be not only regarded as equal to the best of us but permitted to rearrange our whole society to better suit himself?"
"Good morning," Hermione said when he arrived at her home, through the Floo this time. Rose was gurgling happily in her Moses basket, and Harry smiled, warmed by the sight of her.
Harry's fists were clenched so tight he feared his knuckles might snap, but he followed.
It stood to reason then that he’d be the only one of the three to be awake at this ungodly hour. He’d either be spending time with his parents or looking after his young nephews and nieces.
Malfoy gave a huffing laugh, his eyes snapping fire. "I see. So guilt has pulled you back to the straight and narrow, is that it, Potter?"
Sirius glanced at Harry. "Not this committee, no, but he does sit on experimental charms. There is nothing to fear, Harry, provided we are able to oppose him thus."
Harry touched Draco's face, stroked his thumb over the sharp cheekbone. "I can never love you publicly," he said. "But I would not have it undone."
Draco had already pulled the one Harry thought could be Hastings into his arms, pushing back his shirt and encouraging the boy to tug his own.
Harry replaced his cup in its saucer. "I will go to the Burrow; I cannot disappoint the children, and of course I am keen to see them myself. Ginny has already written to me to ask that I go to Godric's Hollow a little in advance of the trip." He smiled. “She tells me that James has grown a whole inch!”
They had not slept well that night, nor spoken of the subject since.
"And how are you, Teddy?" Harry asked.
"Yes, Master Potter, he left a letter in the study in case you arrived before him. He was not sure what day you would be coming."
“Your witness.”
Harry frowned, trying to discern Zabini's meaning even as Nott's eyes widened.
Harry might have said something but Sirius was talking to him again, "You, on the other hand, have nothing to fear save the consequences of your own choices. The Weasleys will hardly send you to the gallows or to Azkaban!" His breath hitched on the name of the prison, the way most people's did on that of Lord Voldemort. "At the worst they will send you to Coventry or ask you to explain yourself."
Only a few days later, the rest of the world intruded once again.
“I took the liberty of ordering some luncheon already. It should materialise in a few minutes.”
Luna let out a large breath and sat back "Wow, do you know what you're gonna do?" She asked.
Harry nodded "I was trying to pretend it didn't happen but he was acting so strange and I couldn't keep from worrying. When he didn't show up for dinner I asked around the house elves. I learned something that... Honestly scared me by how much it made me fall for him" Harry admitted.
Harry's shoulders shook as he cried into Draco's shoulder "Your f-father" he whispered.
Harry closed his eyes and nodded stiffly "Yes" he said quietly.
Harry scoffed again and looked at the glass in his hand, sure it was delicious but it just tasted like a flat fizzy drink "You're kidding right? What is it even supposed to do? Other than taste like liquorice candy" He asked before looking up, his head lolled a bit and his pupils dilated. Oh this was alcohol. "Oh.." he trailed off.
Harry raised his eyebrows in slight surprise and confusion "Uhh yeah that's right" he said, blowing on the liquid in his mug to cool it.
If Draco did bring it up, Harry would simply say he was very very drunk and didn't know what he was doing. Even though he wasn't and he did. He knew exactly what he was doing. The lie would be more believable if Harry returned to being hostile around Draco so that's what he planned on doing, though that might be easier said than done. Harry really didn't want to hurt Draco.
Harry smiled at him "That's... actually quite brilliant" he said before taking a sip of his tea. He hummed in delight and closed his eyes.
Draco shook his head and silently climbed into the bed with him, he wrapped his arms around Harry and hugged him close. Harry stiffened at first but quickly relaxed and buried his head in the blondes shoulder.
Luna nodded "The reading was a little too much for you so you drank to deal with the fear of having to let someone else love you" she assumed.
Harry looked away again "Leave me alone Draco" he said almost begging.
Luna paused and looked at Harry. He frowned and looked back at her "You alright Luna?" he asked.
The Lovers - Upright
Everything felt so surreal, Draco just nodded weakly. He was expecting to take the fork from Harry but before he could lift a finger the Gryffindor loaded the fork with food and lifted it towards Draco's mouth "Open" he said simply, like this was the most natural thing in the world.
Harry smiled back, still studying the blond's features "I'm sure we can, you're not nearly as insufferable as I thought you were" he said before chuckling "you know, in another life we could have been best friends from the start" he admitted.
Harry hesitated before nodding and stepping aside so Draco could enter the front room. He walked over to where he was sat and finished the last of the scotch in his glass. "I hope you don't mind, I had a drink or two a moment ago" he said, picking up the empty bottle.
Minerva McGonagall continued to assign Luna to be the head of Ravenclaw house and Hannah Longbottom as head of Hufflepuff house. It has been a long time since Harry had seen Neville and Hannah and it was honestly good to see them together and happy especially after Hannah found out she couldn't have children because of a curse thrown at her in the war.
Harry's eyes shot open and tears poured out "I'm sorry" he said quickly.
He instantly smelled Moonwort and Lunaria Annua, he scowled at his friend "Why not just give me a straight up truth potion?" He asked rhetorically.
Harry relaxed a little and nodded "I'm fine, if that's all I must go over some notes" he said, beginning to close the door and trying to get away from his confusing feelings.
Was anyone really of sound mind any more?
After a long afternoon of teacher training Draco was glad to be free to do as he wished for the evening. While he did very much enjoy learning and it proved a helpful distraction from the embarrassment that had happened earlier, hours of learning about O.W.L.S and N.E.W.T.S was not his favourite way to spend his time. He made his way back to his rooms and slipped out of his robes which bore heavy on his shoulders by the time the sun went down. He yawned and looked around the front sitting room. He had finished his lesson plan this morning and he had replied to his letters.
Harry sighed "I'm afraid I'm not going to leave before you eat something. Drinking on an empty stomach isn't a good decision" he said, stepping into the front room and walking over towards Draco's desk.
Harry looked around frowning at the dishevelled and just woken Draco "You... You didn't hear that?" he asked, confused.
After a few hours, two strong brews of tea and a brief nap Harry finished his draft to give to Minerva tomorrow morning. He stretched and straightened his robes before making his way out of his rooms and towards the Grand Hall for training.
Draco smiled a little and nodded "I guess you're right, this drink however is more of a gift than anything else. I don't often share things so dear to me" he said turning the running water off and stirring the now dissolved sugar into the diluted drinks. Once he was satisfied he handed one of the glasses to Harry "You're going to want to sip this Potty" he said affectionately. Harry tentatively took the glass but scoffed and took a big swig. Draco cringed "First of all that was terribly uncouth, secondly you're going to regret that" he said taking a small sip from his own glass. It was as delightful as he'd remembered.
Harry fought his instinct to run and picked up his glass "Redintegro" they cheered together before swallowing the last glassful. Instantly the bitterness from the last dose was washed away by... Sweetness. So sweet it was almost painful, it made Harry's chest ache in a way he couldn't even explain.
Harry was so exhausted, he'd been dodging reporters all week. Thankfully the train to Hogwarts was so quiet it was blissful. Everyone wanted the scoop on why Harry Potter quit the most promising job in the wizarding world, for some lowly teaching job.
(Draco's POV)
Draco's eyes drifted to Harry's lips "H-how much did you have to drink earlier?" Draco stuttered, trying to find something - anything - else to think about. To distract himself from his hunger to kiss the man before him.
Harry smirked "Hell in another world we could have even been lovers" he said bluntly.
Draco smirked and raised an eyebrow at him "I could ask you the same thing" he said.
Harry nodded, looking at his feet "I uh.. couldn't sleep. I know I said I needed to think but I'm tired and don't want to do that anymore" he admitted. Finally he looked up at the blonde, he could see how exhausted he was. Not just physically either.
(Draco's POV)
Draco scoffed and brushed invisible debris off his robes "Have a nice stroll with miss Lovegood?" he asked in a mocking tone.
"So Harry, are you looking forward to teaching at Hogwarts?" he asked genuinely curious. Harry sipped his whiskey and smiled a little.
"Oh?"
~o0O0o~
"You knew I wouldn't want this," Harry said as though the words hurt him.
Nonetheless, when Ron reached out a large hand to grasp his, Harry could not help but return his friend's grin. "Harry. Good to see you, mate."
“Like the golden snitch.”
“You nearly got the whole case thrown out. I’m so glad you’re still my friend.”
Harry knew it had to be a trap, designed to make Draco uncomfortable. However, he could only agree. "I love James and Albus and Lily very dearly. I could not imagine my life if I had not become a parent."
Lucius’s eyes flared at that; Harry registered the direct hit.
"Are you now jealous?" Harry returned.
“Good?” said Charlie.
“You can search him if you want,” Ron was saying. “I promise, I’m not trying to slip him anything. I just thought seeing his dog would cheer Harry up. If things go a certain way,” Ron looked significantly at Harry, “it gives them a chance to say goodbye.”
Draco had been slowly relaxing into his chair but all at once the tension leapt back into his frame. "She is well, thank you my lord," Harry said.
Draco's fingernails had dug into Harry's shoulders as he breached the barrier but now his hands relaxed, clasping at Harry's face. "You're inside me," Draco moaned.
"Remus didn't know what had happened at first," Sirius went on.  "He was frantic but he didn't know what avenue to follow. He was certain I was not dead but could not locate me – he told me once he had never been that afraid in his life."
Draco could have tried to find Voldemort's body. Someone had to know what had happened to it that day. While the whole school and half their families besides huddled in the Great Hall counting their losses, the body had been taken to a separate chamber away from those who might be tempted to abuse it.
"I want to do it all," Harry replied at once, reckless and so very alive.
~o0o~
Ginny looked down at her hands. "Three suits me well," she said. "Three is perfect."
The boy's face fell. "Sorry, guv. Just thought…"
Terry's face went white.
"Harry, my family was one such as a man should dread seeing," Sirius said sharply. "They were racist and prejudiced and brutal and when they passed I mourned none of them."
Pale skin and pale eyes flashed before him. Harry hesitated. "Terry Boot, though I didn't have much chance to speak with him."
was upset.”
Sirius' own grin was unrepentant. "I should hope not indeed. Well, here's to you," he said, handing Harry a glass. "Third child coming soon, Harry. You're doing well."
Harry ruffled his always-messy hair. "I doubt she will be up to it, though the thought is kind." The thought was typically Sirius – well-intentioned but utterly inappropriate.
“And yet, sir, I am quite sure that I could obtain a higher price by placing the letter up for bids. But I didn’t do that – I came straight to you. On account of your reputation as a man of fairness.”
Ginny's letter was considerably more forgiving than Harry might have expected.
"No," Harry said, shaking his head. "No, that wasn't... I felt so sick afterwards. Draco, I don't want to think about you like that. The way we are, with someone else. I..." Harry forced his hands, which had clenched themselves into fists, to relax.
"Yes, all right," Terry hissed, holding out his hand to get Draco to quieten down. "I know it was a little odd and I'm sorry, but…"
Draco nodded meaningfully. "Well, our last encounter was certainly a little awkward," he said. "I wanted to talk about it."
"It began at school," Sirius said.  "Remus had always been there.  I used to look at him without knowing what it meant, feel these…"  He waved his hand, trying to find the right word before settling on, "desires."  Sirius smiled a little.  "He was beautiful, Harry.  He still is, to me."
“So that you understand. Whatever fantasy you had of a happy ending is exactly that: Draco chose you because you were out of reach but when the chips are down, he will choose himself every time. He’s not like you.”
"Good," Draco said, and he opened his legs wider for Harry to settle between. "I got myself ready for you while you were sleeping."
Malfoy's head snapped up. His eyes were narrowed. "Oh?"
"Just tell me, Terry," Draco said as quietly as he dared, "are you having an affair with Potter?"
"Well," Harry said. "Good for them. Ron wants a big family, I think."
~o0o~
"I see you trying to distract me from the cards, Blaise."
It also meant that the trial was likely to be arranged quickly, to avoid having to draw out this unusual arrangement. “So you shouldn’t have to be here too long.”
,” Draco snarled. He whirled around, his wand suddenly in his hand and shot a jet of light at the mirror, which shattered. Harry flinched from the sound. “I am sick of hearing about her. And your great betrayal and what this has cost you, always you.”
How he made it to Ron and Hermione's house he never knew.
"There is no need to worry," Draco said, face white. He sat down abruptly as though the strength had suddenly left his body.
“Er,” Potter said, “you don’t remember?”
He needn't have worried. Malfoy looked merely bored as he said, "Merely congratulating him on his accomplishments. I should join the crowd of admirers. Weasley," Malfoy said by way of conclusion, his eyes jerking towards Hermione. "Mrs Weasley. Potter." He gave them all a nod of acknowledgement and turned in a billowing swoop of robes to march away.
But Lucius was not finished. "Really, Draco, do you truly believe you can convince me to approve of this? You did not wish to marry Pansy Parkinson – such things happen, I did not insist. But you turned down another suitable young lady last week and bring a
"I imagine that latter can be the source of considerable controversy," Harry said with something of a sardonic note in his voice.
Harry wore himself out in the days that followed, watching Ginny sleep, comforting James and Albus who were too young really to understand but who knew that their mother was ill and cried for fear of it.
“I don’t know how much trouble I’m in yet,” Harry said quietly. “Are you sure that you want to put you and your wife at the centre of it?”
Harry had been buttoning up his shirt, but at that he shot Draco an amused look. “You’re making that up.”
“The Great Western Royal Hotel?”
Draco shrugged. "Necromancy." He shifted on the bed, loving the way his skin moved over Harry's, the rasp of leg and chest hair, the smooth satin of Harry's back. "Fancy an army of Inferi, do you?"
~o0O0o~
He knew this place. It was Scotland, the billiard room in that spa hotel. Draco was rolling a white ball across the table, catching it and returning it. Agitation was writ large across his body language.
~o0o~
"Will you meet me for dinner?"
Harry had questioned it, knowing Sirius' feelings on the family, and had been told, "They are too powerful to be given the cut direct, Harry. Everyone receives them despite their reputation."
Sirius swallowed.  "You have felt the presence of the Dementors, so you know.  It is as though all the happiness in the world has been stripped away, as though all the joy and life and everything good turns to ice and pain. Imagine endless days and nights of that, with no respite. Imagine your happiest memories disappearing if you try to revisit them for comfort. In the first month I went to bed at night weeping and rose in the morning wishing I were dead.  By the end of the third, I was merely waiting for the end."
Draco looked at Harry with dark, dark eyes, and stood. His own erection bobbed in front of Harry's face and Harry looked up to see the question, the dare in Draco's eyes.
Better by far if he never saw Malfoy again.
He loved Draco, but that love was threatening to undo all of him. He loved Draco to madness and had neglected all his duty. What would he become if this continued?
Harry might not even have looked at the card, might have stuffed it in a pocket or some such, but for the certainty that Lord Malfoy would do nothing without purpose. He sighed and looked down at it.
"It is far from being my intention," Harry spat out before he stalked back to the marquee.
He’d asked Fawley if there was any chance of a blanket, and been met with a polite, reluctant negative. “I’m sorry Mr Potter, sir, but we have strict instructions that you are not to receive anything in your cell except for food. Ministry orders.”
"Too regimented?" Ginny had pondered.
"Naturally," Sirius said. "With the Whitsun recess over it'll be six relentless weeks of debating and defending, and a man needs to recover from that kind of thing in his own way."
Draco dropped his eyes to the floor. “I would rather not say.”
"No."
Sirius held up his palms, "Fine, fine." He seemed a little relieved. "Well, let's see, all the preparations here are in place. Morag's a fine girl for the boys, and I have engaged a Madam Pomfrey to act as Healer."
Albus said something too but it was a more childish babble and Harry could not quite decipher it. He wondered if he would have been able, had he spent more time at home. He touched Albus’s face tenderly and pressed a kiss to the crown of his head.
"You are every inch the man squaring himself to face the gallows," Sirius told him, very little humour in his eyes.
It was probably Harry's own idea. Once, Harry had asked, "How do you create an Inferius?"
"I am a half-blood," Harry said sharply.
"I'd like it," Draco said. "Please."
"When the Queen has spoken so much of German traditions it seemed that a move to honouring same would be a good way to encourage Molly to accept Fleur's French ideas. Recognition of Europe and so forth," Arthur said, nodding.
"You are quite right," Malfoy went on as though they had been conversing. "Do you think perhaps we might find other amusement?"
Draco had, of course, considered that it might be far simpler to kill himself rather than go through all of this for the chance of bringing Harry back. Life, after all, was far from infinite and they had both lived through the consequences of one man trying to make it so.
“Excellent,” Blaise said. “Then I will accompany you there. Are you quite finished packing your things by hand?”
"Wanted to approve an experimental charm, but some of the others thought it was dark magic."
"And now they live in slums," Draco returned. "Perhaps the life of the farmer would not now seem so very hard to some?"
Harry leaned closer once more, he was now only a few inches from Draco's face "You see, I'm having a little trouble believing that" he almost whispered. His voice was low and a little gravely. It was... exhilarating to hear.
Harry grumbled in disdain and poured the next round into their two glasses. He lifted his and Luna did the same, clinking them together. "Praesens" they said before gulping down the now bitter liquid. This isn't going to be fun. If it was bitter at this stage then the cards were going to tell Harry something he didn't want to hear.
This was real!
Harry nodded in agreement along with everyone else at the table. Minerva smiled and nodded "Good, now I'd like for you all to refer to each other by first names as we are all equil now. Draco as well as our new potions professor I'd like for you to be the head of Slytherin house" she said.
"Harry?" he asked raising an eyebrow at Draco.
Fuck.
Right.
Draco sighed, Harry must have charmed the door with an identification spell "Harry please let me in" he said, meaning it literally and figuratively.
Draco smiled warmly and wiped tears from Harry's cheeks with his thumb "You don't need to be. You can't push me away because you're afraid of things going wrong. You saved me in more ways than I can count. You solely stood in front of the entire Ministry of Magic and told them I was not responsible for my crimes. You saved my mother and I from going to Azkaban" he said and pressed a soft kiss on Harry's lips "I'm not going anywhere whether you like it or not" he said softly.
"Don't believe everything you read Malfoy" Harry said coldly before walking past him and into the school. He had no intention of dragging up the past and could certainly work alongside Malfoy with ease. But that didn't mean he wanted to speak to him any longer than necessary nor did he want to talk to him about his decisions.
Draco shook his head "Because you have to be, Harry Potter - The pride of Gryffindor - could never be interested in Draco Malfoy, not even in a parallel universe" he said, as if stating a fact.
Draco smiled a genuine smile and nodded, tension easing from his frame, before correcting himself and retuning to his regular smirk. He made his way further into the room closing the door behind him and joining Harry on the sofa. Looking around it seemed that he and Harry had decorated their rooms with a very similar colour scheme.
Harry smiled a little more before nodding, he didn't seem to notice "I suppose you're right Draco I just wasn't expecting it. In answer to your question yes I am very much looking forward to teaching here. I've missed Hogwarts dearly these past 6 years despite everything that happened here" he said sitting back and presumably getting more comfortable.
Harry shrugged "Perhaps a little, but it's true and you're right. This definitely helps" he said twisting in his seat so he was facing Draco. He rested his head on the back of the sofa and smiled absently. This was very nice. Everything that had been bothering Harry seemed to be miles away, how did Draco do that? How did he just make everything better?
Harry rolled his eyes, of course, why did he even bother asking. "I know, you know it's Draco" he started, Luna simply nodded "Well first night after dinner, he came to my rooms and offered to share a drink or two" Luna's face scrunched up "If that upsets you, you're not gonna like the next parts of the story" Harry said with an eyebrow raised.
Harry shook his head and leaned forward "What are they saying to you?" He asked.
Harry's breath caught in his throat and his grip on Luna's hand tightened. No no no no no.
Draco shook his head, he wasn't. He was raw and unpredictable. Draco sighed and conjured a bottle from his room. If Harry needed to drink right now he wasn't going to do it alone and if Draco was to join him then they were going to do it in style. He transfigured one of Harry's giant books into the proper diluting apparatus.
The Gryffindor's face coloured in concern, was he worried? No Draco was just drunk "I didn't see you at dinner, everyone said you hadn't sent for any food either" he trailed off, he was holding something.
"I can't let you get hurt" he said through soft sobs.
Draco hummed softly and looked up at the sky "We all have our reasons Harry" he said softly, though his alone time was brief it was enough to loosen the knots in his muscles.
If only.
This amused Harry. Despite his new opinion of Draco, he still had a small part of him that relished in Draco's discomfort.
Draco just stood there, it probably was nothing but... He couldn't stop himself from fantasising about what could be so confusing for Harry when it came to Draco not being an arse anymore. He almost wished he could see inside of Harry's mind, if only for a moment. What would it be like? Terrifying probably.
-------
Harry smirked knowingly at Draco as he got two tumblers from the drinks cabinet "Expecting more Gryffindor colours?" he asked slightly amused.
Harry's face stayed completely neutral as he nodded a greeting and walked into the hall. Draco looked as if he was going to say something but he just looked down and silently followed Harry into the hall.
(Harry's POV)
Harry enjoyed seeing Draco's jaw clench at the use of their usual greeting. Harry nodded and put his hand on Luna's a few times and kissing her cheek every now and then as they talked and ate breakfast enjoying the small reactions from Draco. After Minerva dismissed us when we gave her our lesson plans Draco quickly and swiftly left the Grand Hall and Harry smirked triumphantly. Serves you right, prick.
Draco flinched back looking at Harry in disbelief. He didn't know words could hurt this much. He shook his head again "No, you do care. Why did you kiss me? Why were you purposefully trying to make me jealous the other day? Why play with my emotions if you didn't care?" he asked pleading for the answer he wanted.
Harry shook his head "I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I just" he began before giggling a little more and taking a deep breath "Luna is engaged! She's like a sister to me" he finished before laughing more, wiping away a tear and holding his stomach. He hadn't laughed that hard in a long time.
Harry hesitated "I'm pretty sure we're sat in your front room Draco" he said, clearly knowing that's not what the Slytherin meant.
But he did.
The night followed on just like that, pleasant conversation between coworkers and a few chuckles and smiles from Harry that made Draco almost giddy to see. After they had made their way through just over half of the bottle Draco bid Harry a goodnight and made his way back to his rooms.
Harry hesitated before sitting down next to Draco "That's a lot to ask y'know" he said, pulling his glasses out of his pocket and putting them on. He'd taken them off while he'd been crying but he needed them now.
Harry chuckled "Cute" he said instantly before blushing and shaking his head "I mean, all the anger and jealousy seemed to just deflate from him like a balloon. He was obviously embarrassed so I didn't comment on his reaction" he corrected. "That night after our training session I was still a little confused about the O.W.L.s so I went to ask Draco for help but he wasn't in his room. Which now that I think about it wasn't strange in the slightest but my paranoia got the better of me so I used the Maruders Map to find him. He was in the courtyard, sat on the stone bench" Harry sighed happily as he remembered the sight "He looked so beautiful in the moonlight" he confessed, closing his eyes.
Luna giggled softly and shook her head "Oh Harry, don't you think messing with Mr Malfoy like this is a little childish?" she asked.
Harry grumbled in disdain but slowly sat up so he could drink the tea anyway. Luna added a sugar cube to the cup before handing it over to the still scowling Gryffindor.
The ministry couldn't fight against the saviour and so even though Draco had the dark mark he and his mother were sentenced to a house arrest for a number of months which they served and then they were free. Truly and completely free for the first time ever.
Draco was the first to break it. "What are we doing?" He asked, his lack of inhibitions allowing him to seek the answers he wanted.
Harry hummed in agreement "That it has, thank you" he said genuinely.
Draco looked over at him and smiled "Yeah, okay. I'd like that" he admitted. So they sat there, sipping their tea, in comfortable silence. When they'd both finished, they put their empty mugs on the table in front of them. Draco turned to say something but found Harry slowly leaning over, he pressed a soft kiss on Draco's lips before cuddling up to his side.
His mood was somewhat diminished when he saw a relatively unwelcome and familiar face as he approached the gates of Hogwarts.
Luna nodded and pressed a kiss on Harry's cheek "It will be wonderful, if you let it be" She said before letting go of his hand and putting everything away.
What the hell did that mean? The last shot had always tasted like water before, clarity. This was too different. Harry tensed as Luna pulled the last card from the deck and placed it face up on the table. And there it was, staring back at Harry.
"I hope you don't mind, I had a drink or two a moment ago" Harry said, picking up the empty bottle.
Harry's heart began to pound as he saw the blonde Slytherin he couldn't stop thinking about standing in front of him. Draco looked very concerned, he reached out to Harry and Harry flinched away. He was terrified by how much he actually wanted Draco to touch and comfort him. "Don't touch me!" He spat, panicked.
Harry visibly shook "No" he whispered. He didn't care who, or how, or why, or when, he didn't want this. This was dangerous, scary, terrible.
Draco frowned and nodded slowly "Goodnight Harry" he said softly, trying to hide his disappointment.
Harry frowned at the remark before making his way back to his rooms. He bit his lip and paused outside of his door. He was still fired up from being angry at Draco. He decided he was going go and get some frustration out by flying for a bit. He made his way in and changed out of his nice robes and into something more suitable for flying. As he left he asked a house elf to fetch his broom for when he got to the fields.
Draco didn't bother checking the time or getting changed he shot out of bed, left his rooms and knocked on the door next to his "Harry? Is everything alright?" He asked worried.
He had gotten back to his rooms earlier this evening and wanted to talk to Draco about something they learned in training but he wasn't in his rooms, Harry felt small amounts of panic bubbling up so he decided to use the Marauders Map to find him.
(Draco's POV)
Draco nodded, rubbing his eyes sleepily, a light blush spreading across his cheeks "I'm fine Harry" he said before getting over his moment of shock and plastering his regular scowl on his face "What the bloody hell do you think you're doing breaking into my rooms at this time of night only half dressed" he asked angrily.
Harry groaned and nodded, he helped her clean up and left his friend's rooms, more than ready to sleep and put an end to this excruciatingly long day.
Harry chuckled softly and shook his head "I'll help you look for them before training today" he said.
Luna smiled at him and nodded "Thank you Harry" she said and kissed Harry's cheek again as she often did with many of her friends. It was normal to Harry now, he couldn't help but notice Draco stiffen and look away when Luna did so.
Harry smiled wider and removed Luna's hands from his face "I'm glad to hear you think something wonderful is happening" he said not really believing that anything extraordinary was going to happen to him.
Draco nodded looking back at Harry "I was expecting copious amounts of garish red and that obnoxious gold" he said with a slight sneer as he thought of the, in his opinion, hideous colours.
Draco nodded, it had been a possibility many years ago.
Harry smiled weakly "Stubborn git" he said softly.
"Over the last few years he's been buying house elves out of abusive families and promptly setting them free of servitude, no one knows how many he's freed but it's a lot. There's one that still serves him. Poldey, she was the first he liberated. I got to talk to her, she works to transition the elves into their new life of freedom, as well as serving Draco when he needs it but he makes her call herself his best friend rather than his servant" he explained giddily "He even have her a bracelet to signify their friendship!" He exclaimed.
Was any of this real? Was he actually saying this? Was he only saying this because he's intoxicated? He couldn't possibly mean it. How much had he drank before if he was this drunk now? He said his tolerance was high.
Harry flinched ever so slightly "Yes" he admitted, voice tight "I did actually want to kiss you. Did you? Both then and a few minutes ago" he returned.
Draco frowned and looked at him with genuine bewilderment "What the bloody hell is a nargle?" he asked.
Draco bit his lip, he didn't feel right leaving Harry alone in this state. "Wait, I actually... I need some help with a part of the N.E.W.Ts that I'm having trouble understanding. Would you mind helping me?" he asked, he didn't really need help with any of it but he did need to be here for Harry right now. Even if he didn't know it.
Harry hummed taking a large swig of his tea "You know what? This is really nice the way it is. Can we just stay here like this for a while?" He asked.
Draco smiled fondly at the Gryffindor curling up on his couch as he began making their tea. He really was quite adorable when he was tired, his emotional walls were a little less concrete and you could glimpse the real Harry underneath. Warm, kind, vulnerable. Everything that drew Draco in.
Draco took another step towards him "You can Harry" he said softly.
(Draco's POV)
Draco shook his head "Because you have to be, Harry Potter - The pride of Gryffindor - could never be interested in Draco Malfoy, not even in a parallel universe" he said, as if stating a fact.
"Harry?" He asked concerned, the man didn't respond. He was having a nightmare. Draco approached the bed and gently nudged the Gryffindor "Harry wake up you're having a nightmare" he said.
Draco scowled more and shook his head "Hear what Potter?" he asked irritated.
Harry flinched a little and nodded "Yes, but I promise you I was only intending on having the one bottle just to take the edge off. I wasn't going to get drunk... at least that's what I planned" he explained quickly.
Harry frowned "What?" He asked, clearly confused.
Was Harry blushing? He swallowed and placed the tray down on the blondes desk. "M-My apologies, I didn't realise what it was. I didn't read anything" he said, it didn't sound fully honest but he was probably just embarrassed to have caught Draco with a diary.
"Snape?" Harry asked, he didn't know he had his portrait painted - let alone hung in the defence against the dark arts classroom.
Minerva smiled wider and turned to Harry "And Harry as well as our new Defence Against the Dark Arts professor I'd like for you to be the head of Gryffindor house" she said. Harry nodded as a way to say he accepted the position but kept quite.
Draco smiled wider and kissed him back wrapping his arms around Harry's waist.
Draco froze for a second before kissing him back, placing one of his hands on Harry's cheek. Merlin this was perfect, this was exactly what he didn't know he wanted so much. Harry smiled against Draco's lips and moved to sit in his lap.
Draco shook with laughter "I did warn you" he said, taking another sip from his glass.
Later that night Harry woke up hearing a crashing sound from next door. He shot out of bed grabbing his wand, all his survival training shot into action as Harry raced out of his rooms and knocking on Draco's door.
Harry smiled "Goodnight Draco" he said before casting a lumos and walking back towards their rooms.
After what felt like an hour, Harry was beginning to calm down when he heard footsteps approaching. Oh god. Someone was here, he wasn't recovered enough to fight, he was vulnerable to attacks. Harry couldn't take this. Just as he began to get up and run he locked eyes with Luna.
Harry shook his head and returned to his regular hardened neutral face "Just a little strange to see the man I once thought was a spoiled brat treat something lower than him with respect" he said unlocking his door
Draco bit his lip, Merlin that was tempting. "Not even once" he said. That was a lie, Harry knew it was.
Draco smiled a little and nodded "I guess you're right, this drink however is more of a gift than anything else. I don't often share things so dear to me" he said turning the running water off and stirring the drinks before handing one of the glasses to Harry "You're going to want to sip this Potty" he said, you could feel the affection behind the nickname. Harry tentatively took the glass, maybe this wasn't the best idea but he didn't really want to think about it so he scoffed and took a big swig. Draco cringed at him "First of all that was terribly uncouth, secondly you're going to regret that" he said taking a small sip from his own glass.
Remus nodded sagely. "It's been a long day for all of us."
Draco kept his mouth shut, partly out of anxiety, partly because antagonizing the volitile little man would result in far worse than a couple of stunning spells. His heart pounded in his chest. He wanted to go home. It didn't matter that he no longer had one. It was the only place he wanted to be. Though in the moment he would have taken literally any other location. Anywhere would have been better. A bone-breaking curse was shot at his arm and he hissed in pain. He couldn't avoid the glare towards his attacker.
Apparently being close to Malfoy was enough to wake him up just a little. He opened his eyes only to see Malfoy passed out, not breathing beside him. His heart seized. He didn't care about Malfoy, wanted nothing to do with the soulmates rubbish, but seeing the other boy dead was too stark of a reminder. Pain surged through him and tears welled in his eyes. The exhaustion tried to take over, to drag him into permanent unconsciousness, but he fought against it.
He was cut off by the floo activating and Ron calling his name. This wasn't going to be good.
"Parkinson," Hermione called, startling the slytherin.
She nodded. "It's rumoured to be on the seventh floor isn't it?"
"Really, Pansy?" he drawled. "It's not bad enough that we died, you have to add to the drama."
"If it's because you have the urge to run away, it's because the wards on the house are fighting you. I can reconfigure them in the morning so they'll leave you alone."
Obviously, the house didn't offer a response aside from pushing back against his attempt at rearranging the wards. He grunted with the effort but after half an hour, the house conceded to his will. He changed into comfortable clothes before tentatively knocking on the guest bedroom door.
"Dunno. Closest I could get to waking him up after history. You were right, 'Mione. There's something wrong with him," Ron replied.
He chuckled. "Yeah. This stuff's all the original that belonged to Walburga. Only things that are different is that no cursed objects exist anymore."
Hermione rushed in and hugged him, but Harry quickly shrugged her off. He was supposed to make peace with them, but he couldn't ignore the fury in his chest long enough. Molly called them down for dinner after a while but Harry opted not to. He wasn't hungry and he didn't particularly care what the house was or why he'd been brought there.
Hedwig found him a few hours later in his grotty room in the Leaky Cauldron.
"If I could, I would," Harry replied. "Like it or not, I'll be around more than I would like to be. Goodbye Malfoy."
Draco wasn't about to disagree. He loved getting attention, but the rumours were proving to be too much. He'd started feeling guilty about doing exactly that about Harry for the last four years. When they got to Hogsmeade, they took a trip into Zonko's, Honeydukes and a couple other places before stopping by the Hog's Head.
"Not necessarily, but if it is him, explains a lot. Possibly the only person Harry would rather die than be bound to."
"You can hold hands you know."
"Harry, I mean no offense, but this place looks awful," he said.
When he and Ginny got onto the topic of Quidditch (and especially the upcoming Harpies game), it became impossible not to notice Draco's interest. Without hesitating, Ginny included him in the conversation. He was greatful that she was playing nice. Since the war, her response to people had, without a doubt, been hit or miss. It had also been impossible to gauge which option she'd choose until after the choice had been made either.
He was informed to write lines but she handed him one of her quills. His confusion vanished quickly after he began writing. The stupid quill was carving the words into his hand. He made no noise, even though it hurt like hell, and when the detention was over, he pulled his sleeve over his hand. He had not expected to run into Malfoy but his soulmate was waiting in the corridor with a foul look on his face.
"You alright?" she-weasel asked from behind him.
He was about to comment when Hermione and Ron rushed into the library. Harry jerked his hand away, hiding the evidence. Draco narrowed his eyes but didn't comment. Hermione frowned.
Draco slowly approached the kitchen, peering into the room through the slightly ajar door. Kreacher was stood on a stool so that he was at the same height as Harry. Both of them had their arms crossed tightly.
"Play nice, Ginny, or I'll remove your wand the way I did your brother's," Harry said blandly.
He looked at the floor again. Maybe he should have said something. Clearly he still had enough pride not to act like a child. That was nice to know. He thought it had all been tormented out of him.
"You honestly think any auror is going to risk arresting me? It would be terrible publicity for the ministry and they've barely regained a reputation as it is."
Draco smirked. "Because your bird was too stubborn to move when I sent my mother a letter. She tried stealing it too. Gave up trying after a while and used her to send it. I wasn't exactly at full capacity the day before yesterday."
Stupid soulmate idiocy. He hadn't intended on finding Draco. He'd just been walking the castle, using the time up until the others left the great hall. He hadn't planned on going into the bathroom. He'd just acted upon some impulse. At least he knew how to avoid him again. Clearly fate had decided to push them together to avoid the rejection process. He mentally stuck his fingers up at it. He was not going to allow some stupid ethereal power to control his life. He was done playing by the rules of other people since all it did was cause people to die or feel too much pain. He wasn't a pawn. His life had been screwed over by a prophecy as a baby and now fate wanted him to be permanently attatched to his rival. The son of his enemy. He stalked up to the Fat Lady.
"Hardly, though I am now considered an adult in the eyes of the olde laws. Or so the goblins say. Hasn't really changed much honestly."
"Ron and I will levitate him through the walls if we have to."
"What was- never mind," Draco said.
He groaned. "Tired. Staying here."
life? You're the one who was rejecting."
He shrugged. "Fine. Not dead."
"Still passed out, Pads," Lupin said gently. "Alive, but not waking up. Pomfrey says there's nothing inherantly wrong with either of them right now. Soulmates connection is clearly doing something to them though."
They talked for a while about less heavy topics and Draco barely concealed his desire to drag out when Harry would go to bed. He really did not want to be alone over night. It made him feel rather pathetic but he couldn't control the fear. It was insistant and demanding. When midight struck, Harry conceded that it was time to sleep and Draco, not having any excuse, lamented to going to bed. Once in his room, he paced. He wanted to sleep. He was utterly exhausted, but he couldn't. He was fighting the urge to run far, far away. He hated the feeling.
Once he was dressed, Hermione joined him and Ron in the dorm. He sat down heavily on his bed and tried to work out how to phrase his new reality. It was proving to not be much fun.
Draco looked like he was about to argue before closing his mouth and shaking his head slightly.
Madam Pince looked at them from her desk and frowned. "I won't be having any funny business going on in my library. I hope you understand me."
Draco was very confused. Harry sounded so... formal. There was tension in the room but he couldn't work out if it was just because Weasley had aimed his wand or if there was something else behind it too. Weasley also seemed kind of confused, and Harry, well Harry just looked drained. Wasn't Weasley his best friend? Draco placed his tea down, reminding the ginger that he was still in the room and elliciting another, harder glare. He yelped suddenly and took a step back from Draco. He looked at Harry and the golden boy had pointed the wand in his direction.
Harry pressed his temples. Could he have been vaguer? He didn't think so. He hadn't known what to say without telling him everything but that wasn't an option. Sirius would find out and go vigilante justice for him.
She-weasel looked mildly offended but didn't comment. Despite the urge to leave them to it, Draco could not deny his hunger any longer. He slowly entered the room and sat beside Harry. When he hesitated about taking any of the food, she-weasel rolled her eyes before she shoved a tray of fried rice and lemon chicken in his direction.
Potter nodded in agreement. Together, they finished the bottle of firewhiskey. Draco felt wonky and the world was spinning very quickly around them. Harry was almost giggling where he sat, repeatedly sliding off the bedpost and onto the matress. They talked about a lot of stuff that Draco didn't recall before passing out, fully expecting a hangover the next day.
The elf appeared. "How can Kreacher be serving, Master Harry?"
"I will not leave it alone. Why haven't you reported this to anyone?"
Draco smirked. "Pansy and Blaise were always... touchy people, but now it's just atrocious. I put a charm on the dorm door to stop girls coming in after I caught them going at it. There's literally nowhere safe from them."
"I've heard talking about it can help. I mean, I've never done it but then, I've hardly been able to talk to anyone who experienced half of what I did. None of them were personally exposed to the Dark Lord until the end."
The day went by in a vague sort of blur. He wrote things down and performed a few spells, but he wasn't really paying attention. People kept whispering behind his back, to his left and right and directly in front of his face. The only ones that seemed to have gotten a grip on themselves were the gryffindors and Harry had no doubt in his mind that Ron, Hermione, the twins and Ginny had something to do with it. When the evening came, he headed to his detention with the toad professor.
"You alright, Harry?" Hermione asked.
"He wants nothing to do with me and will therefore rather die. I cannot use you, alright? Move over so that I can call one of the school birds."
He opened the window and took his letter, absently stroking the owl as he read the front of it. Harry looked up at him, still frowning.
"Probably to ask whether your parents know and to work out whether you're actually willing to fight on our side. Or at the very least, hide with our side so that you don't threaten my life."
conversation just yet. He wanted to delay the reality for as long as possible. He quickly collected the things he needed for broom maintanance and paid, barely avoiding being caught by the blond he was bound to protect. He resented his inheritance for a brief minute. He just had to get bound to an idiot who thought the world revolved around him. He sighed. Of course he did. The Malfoy's he'd met were convinced the world did revolve around them. They expected everything to be done to their standard and sneered at anything that didn't fit. Of course Malfoy behaved the way he did when he had Lucius as a role model. Once safely away from the Quidditch shop, he released his wings again and finished shopping.
"For what it's worth, I really am sorry," he said.
"That is where you come in," Draco replied. "You're going to need to ask Lupin to escort us. Technically, we require an adult to enter the ministry anyway. Meeting is in a week."
"They said you'd be by," the barkeep replied. "Went on a walk down by the shrieking shack ten minutes ago."
In case it wasn't already obvious, this is kinda slowburn, but that'll only last as long as my patience
"Once a fortnight. Pretty sure he only keeps me on because he was mandated by the court. Apparently people of my disposition aren't allowed to just do nothing with their time."
It was three a.m. when the moaning started. It was quiet at first, barely audible, but it got increasing louder until it became clear that it was a scream. Hesitantly, Draco slipped out into the hallway. The sound was definitely coming from Harry's room. He padded over and knocked on the door. There was no response, but the scream got louder. He twisted the door handle and pushed it open. Harry was face up on his bed, wrapped in his duvet with sweat clinging to his face. Draco walked over and gently shook Harry's shoulders, waking him up from whatever nightmare he was having. It took several minutes before Harry responded and his first instinct was to grab his wand, aiming it at Draco's face.
"I don't suppose you've seen a man with a large black dog, by any chance?" Harry asked the barkeep.
"There a reason you're here, ferret?"
"Have they been informed?" Lupin asked.
"How are the dementors not affecting you?" the man asked.
Draco shook his head. "I don't need your pity."
He rolled his eyes, burying his face into his pillow. Why did she think it had anything to do with the summer or the Order? She was supposed to be the smart one of the group. She shoved him over and scowled at him.
. He survives. He's too stubborn to die."
"Have you got another detention with Umbridge?" Draco asked after a few minutes.
"I apologize for not knowing you, Harry. Things were complicated."
The slytherin girl looked at him with her eyebrows so high they almost disappeared into her hairline. "You died because of him and you're fine with it? Have you gone insane? Do I need to check you into St. Mungo's?"
The pureblood frowned before dropping his head back to his knees. "Thank you, Harry. For so many things."
"Guess we're sharing a bed then."
Harry looked up. Draco was curled in on himself, his eyes kind of glassy. He was haunted by demons too.
She resisted the urge to stamp her foot in frustration. Harry had been off ever since the Order brought him to Grimmauld Place. At first she just thought it was because he was mad about the lack of letters from her or Ron but it was definitely more than that. She ducked back into the common room and sat down beside Ron on the sofa. Her soulmate connection made her feel slightly lighter but she couldn't ignore that there was something wrong with Harry. Maybe she could send a letter to Professor Lupin. Maybe he'd have a better idea. Ron nudged her.
"I can see the cogs turning in your head. It's almost amusing to watch," Harry said quietly.
They went up so many stairs Draco got lost trying to work out where they were going. It wasn't until he heard Weaslebee string a very impolite sentence together that he even knew they'd found the others. Draco opened his eyes. Harry was very much being carried by the ginger and Granger was walking backwards and forwards with her eyes shut.
"Hedwig?" he said questioningly as he got up to accept the letter.
Once Draco had disappeared into the floo, Harry tried to decide on what to do. He had absolutely zero motivations to do anything. Ginny was busy for the rest of the week, he didn't particularly feel like getting a lecture from Hermione and Ron, well they'd been at arms length for a while. Mostly his doing honestly. Ron kept suggesting he go see a mind healer at St Mungo's to treat his trauma and subsequent depression. He was not in the mood for some witch or wizard to stand in front of him and tell him what he already knew. He'd been through seriously fucked up shit. His parents had been murdered, his guardians had been abusive motherfuckers, his godfather forced into hiding then soon dying, watching a friend die at the hands of a resurrected madman then being informed he was a liar for a year afterward. Not to mention anything of the horcrux hunt, being raised for slaughter and fighting a war he wanted no part in. He'd suffered a bunch. He didn't need a doctor to tell him that.
and frowned at the time. How had he slept in until midday? Usually he was up with the daylight no matter what time he'd gone to bed. He shrugged. He'd been told on multiple occasions that he didn't sleep enough anyway.
