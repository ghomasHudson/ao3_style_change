“Harry,” she laughed, “You’re overthinking again,” Her voice was slightly softer than usual, he remarked “And put that wand down, would ya? I’m no death eater!” Oops, I hadn’t realized I still had my wand pointed straight at her. I smiled, lowered my wand, and headed towards her with the intention of kissing her.
But Yaxley simply tutted, while Draco (and Harry from across the alley) stared down at the blood soaking through his shirtsleeve. Merlin, it
!” Parvati exclaimed, looking scandalized, and at the same time very, very embarrassed. “Nic and I aren’t…he isn’t…we’re not—”
But Draco didn’t care. He didn’t care if she hexed him, didn’t care about anything, and so he didn’t so much as glance her way. Rage churned within him, almost overpowering the panic and fear warring in his chest—almost, but not quite.
“Yes,” Harry insisted firmly. “Yes, I do. Like it or not, Draco, I know you a lot better than you might care to admit.” He shook his head. “I know you’re neither cruel nor vindictive nor cold-hearted. You’re not even mean, not really, not in your core. I know how you like your coffee, and that you bake when you’re stressed, and that you’d sleep until noon if I didn’t wake you up beforehand. I know that you care about people and protect those you love with a passion, that you can’t help but feel responsible for your mother even though you’re doing the best you can. That you’re just as broken and scared as the rest of us—but at the end of the day, you’re a survivor.” He looked up into those startling silver eyes and said, “I know you better than I do most people, Draco, so believe me when I say you’re
Draco finally dislodged himself from the doorway, levitating his mug into the kitchen. He sauntered over to Harry in the middle of the now-empty living room, took one look at the piled-up furniture and rolled those grey eyes. “You do realize you’re a wizard, right? As in, magic wand, levitating spells, a certain feather-light charm?”
He brushed a strand of hair from Harry’s forehead and looked at him, and before he could make the active decision to do so, his thoughts had formed words, words that promptly tumbled out of his mouth in a small, strangled whisper.
about morality. You are utterly undeserving of the Malfoy title, a disgrace to pureblood tradition. A
Before Draco could answer, though, Narcissa answered, “That’s why I came.” She hesitated, looking between Draco and Harry again. “It might be best if we all sit down for this.”
A flash of silver blond was the last thing Harry saw before his legs gave way and his vision went completely dark.
He finally tore his gaze away from the beautiful writing only to look back up into Draco’s face, whose expression was something caught between apprehension and affection. His silver eyes were already on Harry, and he was biting his lip, evidently anxious and not even trying to hide it as he usually would.
a creepy stalker, nor was he, contrary to what Pansy always said, mindlessly obsessed with Harry Potter.
“He’s fine, I’m positive,” he said, hoping his voice sounded as calm and unaffected to Granger as he meant it to. “I can’t tell you where he is exactly, whether he’s in his room or out with
“I—” began Weasley, and Draco thought the redhead might honestly put up a fight. Fucking Gryffindors. But then he paused, and, expression tortured, glanced over at Harry. Draco’s gaze followed.
Ron looked at Draco, as though only now noticing his presence, and immediately his eyebrows lifted, whether due to the Slytherin’s casual clothing (a green jumper and trousers, although the trousers were still categorically posh) or just in simple shock of seeing Draco Malfoy sitting at Harry’s kitchen counter with a mug of coffee. And Harry loved his best mate, really, he did, but now was decidedly
Draco glowered at the disbelief in Blaise’s voice at those final few words but chose to say nothing. Instead, he pinched the bridge of his nose and sighed. “But it’s curable? He won’t die?”
An especially odd flash passed across the Slytherin’s face, but then it was gone again, and all that remained was an odd tinge of red in Draco’s cheeks. “
However, before any new surges of worry or dread could fester, a door on the other side of the hallway opened up, only to reveal a tall, willowy woman in white robes, donning a tight bun and even tighter expression.
Nic nodded, already lifting his hand to throw down the green powder. But then he hesitated and said with a little lopsided smile, “Do try the beignets, though, will you? Trust me, you’ll love them.”
Draco shook his head resolutely. “No. I mean it, she doesn’t want me like that. Or any way, really. But it’s fine. I’ve long since made peace with the situation. There will be other options down the road, I’m sure.” Only he wasn’t. He’d tried it before, searching for someone who might fill the void. But each time, it had always gone up in smoke. Draco knew it was partially his own fault.
“They commissioned it,” Draco answered darkly. Harry glanced at his boyfriend, only to find his mouth set into a tight scowl.
Harry collapsed to the ground like a ragdoll, and it was as though Nic had stolen the very breath from his lungs as he laid on the cold hard cobblestone, wheezing and gasping for air, none of which quite seemed to make it to his lungs. There was a faint buzzing in his head, accompanied by a dull ache at the back of his skull.
Draco ignored them all, as though none of them, not even Harry, were there, instead gripping his book so hard his knuckles went completely white, and after a few seconds everyone looked away again, evidently confused. All except Hermione, Harry noted, who wore an especially pensive look as she regarded the Slytherin.
“Whatever it is you want,” Draco bit out, eyes unblinking as they focused on the stranger, voice cold and calm and composed, just as it ought to be, “killing me now won’t solve anything. It’ll only add to your problems, I assure you. Trust me when I say murdering an Auror is not something the Ministry takes lightly. Look, I can help you—”
The blond smiled, and it was a smile of such pure joy that Harry found his heart stumbling a beat and his own lips tugging upwards into a gigantic grin—a grin that only grew when Draco repaid the favour with a deeper, much longer kiss that had Harry’s insides writhing like a bundle of flobberworms.
Harry shook his head and batted him away half-heartedly, except he couldn’t help but laugh, and Draco was still standing in the way, effectively trapping the Gryffindor between the kitchen counter and himself. And so, whatever feeble resistance Harry might have meant to put up, it was effectively brought to an end when Draco’s lips crashed back into his, protests fading away and out of mind within a split-second.
Draco didn’t even have time to draw in a gasp before the door on the other side of the room slammed shut with a definite and resounding bang, and a blast of green erupted from the shadows.
Ginny resolutely did not look at him as she slipped in between Parvati and Lavender, brown eyes all the while fixed resolutely on the windows across the room. It was the first time, Harry realized, that she’d been in his apartment. Since their breakup almost directly after the war, at which point he hadn’t yet acquired the flat, she’d always had Quidditch practice or previous commitments or simply couldn’t make it whenever Ron and Hermione and the others had come over. Harry didn’t take offense—he couldn’t exactly see himself sitting casually in Ginny’s apartment either, laughing and talking as though everything was as it once had been—but it shocked him more than it probably should to see her here now.
And for some reason, that hurt him far more than any of Ginny’s cold glares and barbed-wire words ever could.
Harry’s eyebrows shot upwards. First smiling at Harry, then politely asking to talk to him, being nice and sincere and vulnerable—who was this person across of him and what had they done with Draco?
“I don’t—” Harry began, but was silenced when Draco surged forwards and planted a quick kiss on his lips.
“However,” said Narcissa, expression hard, “something did happen that you should know about. Lucius was threatened.”
The most mature thing Draco could do now, he knew, was speak to Robards and go from there. Except he wasn’t so sure he
“Wait, we’re outside,” Harry said, and Draco wondered not for the first nor the last time how the fuck he’d ended up in love with such a complete and utter imbecile.
Draco promptly stopped worrying about his blush. He tried to suppress his panic but failed. “My—” Fuck, why was his voice suddenly so squeaky? “What about it, Potter? We agreed, no meddling.”
Draco stilled, and his eyes went impossibly wide. He didn’t speak, he didn’t move an inch, he didn’t even breathe.
The resulting silence was so laden with tension even Harry shifted uncomfortably in his seat across the table, emerald eyes shifting nervously between the other two men. However, Draco only noted this out of the corner of his eye, for his gaze was still interlocked with that of Nic, waiting for the latter to break eye contact. After all, Draco was certainly not going to do it. Backing down now was simply out of question.
The heavy silence crept back in, and Draco still wouldn’t look at Harry, still looked so sad, so miserable, so hopeless, and Harry hated it, hated it with every fibre of his being. Just minutes before the joy on the Slytherin’s face had been near-radiant, his eyes aglow with happiness as they’d dodged each other’s hexes, laughing as though they really didn’t have a care in the world.
“So what happened to you?” he said jokingly. “You look like you took on a Hungarian Horntail and lost. Nasty buggers, those are. Can’t recommend.”
! And it didn’t matter that he’d only done so mentally, it didn’t matter that Draco hadn’t heard, that he didn’t know what traitorous,
was the kind of ending his already-complete-and-utter-shite day needed. Soaked all the way down to his underwear within a matter of seconds.
There would be, as it turned out, little ‘winning over Harry Potter’ that day. For, when Draco Apparated back to Harry’s flat, he found it just as atrociously red as it had been the day before, but much, much emptier.
Under the sheer cataclysm of relief that flooded him at that moment, making him feel light-headed and giddy, Draco felt like either laughing hysterically or just flat-out sobbing.
And therein laid the problem. The reason Draco still hadn’t knocked, the reason he felt so damn nervous.
“What’re you thinking about?” Harry asked, taking another bite of the chocolate. It was white chocolate—Harry’s guilty pleasure—and he was rather surprised Draco had accepted a piece of it in the first place. He’d expected the Slytherin to go on a tirade right along the lines of ‘gah it’s so bloody sweet I feel like my teeth are about to fall out how can you eat this Potter you utter loon’. Harry had never asked him outright, but he could just
Draco winced. “I wrote it the day after you…got cursed. Before he was killed, Yaxley told me something about my father. He didn’t specify, just said something about how my father had helped him. He made it sound as though it had something to do with the investigation, as though it were important. For all I knew he was bluffing, just trying to rile me up further. That’s why I didn’t tell you.”
thinking about someone else spending the rest of their life with Draco, dating him, kissing him, snuggling up on the couch together and falling asleep watching some old muggle film the Slytherin would no doubt make fun of at first but end up loving. He
anything. And you’re being overdramatic—as always.” He shook his head. “Look, forget I ever said anything. It doesn’t matter anyway. You’re free to do or say or feel whatever you want. Don’t let me stop you.”
Harry racked his brain for any mention of a trip to Dublin, only to come up empty. He grimaced helplessly, glancing over at Ron for help, who in turn shrugged his shoulders in a similarly knowledgeable manner.
But he needn’t have worried, for Draco finally opened his mouth then and, albeit still looking slightly dazed, said quietly, “You’re okay.”
When Malfoy’s voice sounded again, it was no more than a strangled whisper. “You think so? Genuinely?”
Blaise chuckled. “Nah, all that sounds fun. It’s how downright ridiculous you get whenever anyone so much as mentions the name Harry Potter—and don’t even get me started on what happens when you two are actually in the same room. It’s humiliating, Draco.
together, by Salazar’s beard, as though they were friends. Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy—friends. The concept was so wrong, so absurd, so utterly ridiculous, so incredible and unbelievable and heart-warming and profound, so right in so many ways. Draco had, if only for a moment, had what he’d always wanted, since that first day of First Year, when he’d held out his hand with the very same wish in mind, and been sent crashing back down to earth, to reality, where a Malfoy and a Potter couldn’t possibly be anything but enemies.
“Salazar, Pans,” Draco grumbled, and gave his wand another particularly forceful flick, adding the remaining cocoa. “Enough with the smiles. You really are positively Hufflepuff today.”
“Know what?” Draco scrunched up his nose. “And quit looking at me like that. I’m not a pureblood, remember?”
“You know what?” asked the Death Eater, an unpleasant smirk contorting his face until it looked just about as human as the red-eyed, snake-like thing Draco would often awaken to in the middle of the night, sweat-drenched and shaking at the memory of Voldemort’s monstrous features. “On second thought, I think I just might.”
Harry twisted and squirmed until finally, by some miracle, he managed to wrench his arm out of the Slytherin’s hold. He stopped dead in his tracks, forcing Draco to stop as well. The Slytherin regarded him with pursed lips, crossed arms and a glower that would have made Hermione proud. There was frustration in his eyes, definitely—not that he had any right to be frustrated, the git—but also that same tension Harry’s glimpsed before, a disquietude that sent a shiver up Harry’s spine and whispered into his mind that something’s was off, something wasn’t right.
When Weasley noticed Draco’s lingering presence, the redhead scowled. “Piss off, Ferret-Face. We’re trying to have a private discussion, in case you haven’t noticed.”
And that, eventually, finally, seemed to tear the ginger out of his momentary stupor; Ron’s face hardened with resolve, and he gave a curt nod.
“Bloody hell,” the ginger groaned across the room. “Look, I’m genuinely happy for you, Harry, but seeing my best mate snog a Malfoy is weird, okay?
There was another pause, in which Hayes just stood there, looking in between the two of them, eyebrows still raised, while Draco simply glared at him and Harry—
Yet that relief was muffled by the sheer trepidation he hadn’t been able to shake since Weasley had crashed out of the fireplace a wide-eyed, dishevelled mess, and burst out without preamble of any kind ‘Yaxley’s gone!’. A tension deep within Draco, a fear, one that had admittedly been mollified at the sight of Harry safe and sound and without so much as a scratch on him.
And then there was the whole convincing-Philomena-Craigs-not-to-hex-them-on-the-spot-business. Draco had only ever met the severe-looking shopkeeper a handful of times, when his father had brought him along after some back-to-school shopping over in Diagon. But even years later, he remembered how utterly terrifying the woman was, despite looking to be about a hundred. And Draco knew better than to think that particular impression had anything to do with the fact that he’d been a naive, easily intimidated child at the time.
Harry, had been for years, perhaps since the very beginning—so now Draco just had to makes sure it was
“Oh, by the way, Harry, speaking of wannabe Hogwarts Professors,” Parvati said then. “Nic told me you guys met at the pub the other day. I gave him your Floo, I hope you don’t mind. He said he might call you soon. Honestly, I think he rather likes you.”
Harry looked so breathtakingly gorgeous that it took all Draco’s self-control to not immediately sprint across the room and snog him senseless, until the air in his lungs ran out. Which was actually, truly, genuinely something he could
Pansy snorted, and Harry found his eyes promptly shooting back to her, so shocked by the uncharacteristically un-pureblood sound he could only gape. Sure, he’d heard Draco snort before, but that was
Draco couldn’t repress the surge of concern that struck him then, but he knew he couldn’t very well ask what was wrong, not here, not now, not with the current company. So, instead he turned his attention back on Nic, and said unhesitatingly, “Yes. Yes, we are.”
to be loving and supportive,” said Harry, looping his own arms around Draco’s neck. “It might even be a law of some sort. Just saying—if I were you, I’d try being nicer to me.”
“I’m sorry, I can’t say things aren’t that bad,” Draco whispered, and standing there, so close, the scent of his soulmate filled his nose, like sandalwood and cinnamon and something else, something citrusy, all combined into one, warm and wonderful and so very Harry. “I can’t say everything will be fine. But you’ll manage, understand?” He pulled away, just enough so that he could look his Gryffindor in the eyes. “You’ll manage just fine, because you’re Harry bloody Potter, and that’s what you do—you endure.”
And Draco might not have known whether or not this was his last day assigned as Harry’s bodyguard. He might not have known what the future held in store for them, whether all this would last, whether, when this all ended, he’d be enough to protect the man he loved.
However, Draco did not, in fact, yell at Weasley, nor did he attack him or so much as snap at the man again. Instead, Draco merely clenched his jaw—very, very hard.
He offered Hermione a smile of his own. “I’m very sorry, Hermione, but I’m afraid I must get going now. It seems I have some work to do.”
“I—” he stammered, mind a reeling mess, heart all the while stumbling over its own rhythm. “What the hell are you talking about? What did you—did something happen to Draco? Is he alright?”
Blaise’s grin didn’t waver. “Okay, fine, so maybe it wasn’t me alone. But I did help. Plus, I made sure no one saw that dreadfully conspicuous little tattoo you’ve got there—and I don’t mean the one on your left forearm.”
“Sorry, sorry,” Harry said and loosened his death-grip around his water glass. “My mind’s a million miles away. What were we talking about again?”
Draco shifted in his seat right beside Harry, practically pressed against his side, and at least had the decency to look guilty as he answered, “I, err, might have written Lucius a letter the other day.”
Draco had not planned on going to Diagon Alley that evening. As a matter of fact, his plans had consisted wholly of lying in his bed back at Malfoy Manor, curled up in his favorite silk pyjamas with the embarrassingly sappy novel his mother had gifted him for his birthday, shoveling chocolate pralines into his mouth and feeling generally sorry for himself, thank you very much.
do. And besides, it’s not like I can leave you alone here anyway.” He said it like a joke, but Harry couldn’t help but feel slightly guilty. “It’s silly, I know.”
Yaxley threw another curse at the desk, and Draco took that moment of temporary distraction to roll out from his hiding place and fire a non-verbal ‘Flipendo’ at the Death Eater. He didn’t waste time to see whether or not his spell had hit its target but judging by the enraged outcry and subsequent slam of a body hitting the adjacent wall, Draco figured it had.
Yaxley simply sat there with that slippery smile of his and watched Draco, and as much as Draco wanted to hit the man, wanted to see him bleed, he also wanted nothing more than to
At the sound of his name, Harry looked up, as did Draco—only to find a brown-haired man standing before their table, blue eyes fixed on Harry, a small, shy smile stretched across his face. Draco didn’t recognize him at first, thinking this must surely be another of the Saviour’s fans.
And it was that second kiss that first Weasley, and then seconds later Hermione walked in on, and then promptly froze dead in their tracks, eyes wide, mouths agape.
“Trying to escape?” Yaxley spat, face contorted with rage and disgust, wand pointed at Draco’s face. He tutted. “How cowardly. Just like your father in that regard, I suppose. And here I thought you wanted to be different. Little Auror Draco, just as weak now as you were four year ago.”
find that so hard to believe?” Malfoy’s lips pursed. “I do possess a shred of human decency, you know, even if it may sometimes be obscured by my pitch-black heart.” He said it with a heavy dose of sarcasm, but Harry for some reason wasn’t bothered.
When Draco hesitated, the stranger hissed in indignation, and for a split-second the pressure of the wand disappeared—except, before Draco could so much as move a muscle, two jets of green light blasted into the ground just inches away from his feet, causing the dark, rotting floorboards to shatter and spray chunks of wood in all directions.
Draco was sure his ribcage cracked a bit under that mesmerising gaze, under the concern therein, and he pushed the crushing intensity of it into another dizzying kiss.
He didn’t know how to react. Should he be glad? Should he be disappointed? On the one hand, he was silently thankful it wasn’t a
And before Yaxley could even open is mouth again, Draco flicked his wand once, and thick ropes bound themselves around Yaxley’s wrists and legs. The Death Eater gave an enraged outcry and tried to wriggle free, but in return the ropes only tightened.
many people out there like Dominic Hayes or Ginevra Weasley, just waiting for the chance to make the famous Harry Potter their own. After all, who wouldn’t want him? Who wouldn’t want the Boy Who Lived Twice, the Vanquisher of Voldemort, the Saviour of the Wizarding World?
the bowl rather than actually within. “I think I messed it up. I just can’t figure this stupid muggle device out.” The pureblood gave the mixer an especially disparaging sneer. “Bloody muggles, always have to make everything so damn complicated.”
Draco made a muffled sound somewhere between surprise and delight, and that broke the very last of Harry’s resolve. He melted into the touch, the feel of Draco’s lips on his, of the hand gently cupping his face, and slung his arms around the blond’s neck, pulling him closer, nearer, until there was no space at all left between them, until their chests were touching and Harry could feel the pounding beat of Draco’s heart to match his own.
“You’re not going to leave me here,” Harry clarified, “because I’m coming, too. You said it yourself, we’re family, and that includes you and Ginny and Mrs. Weasley and George and everyone else. I’m not going to just sit here and do nothing while Angelina’s out there giving birth and your three-year-old nephew’s alone in Diagon, scared out of his mind. So,
Harry stared at the two Healers incredulously. First they insinuated Draco had something to do with this, and now they point-blank refused to tell him what was going on. Terrific. This was why Harry loved St. Mungo’s. Each stay was a proper joy.
And when he looked back up at Draco, who was still staring down at Harry’s soulmark like it was the eighth world wonder, Harry didn’t even care he was crying. He didn’t care he must look and sound like the biggest fucking sap of all time, didn’t care that he was still bruised and battered and being hunted by some maniac killer.
They’d been in the pub now for a few hours at least, both currently nursing their third, maybe fourth, Butterbeer—Draco hadn't had this much sugar since he was
. “Come now, hiding’s no fun. Step out where I can see you, so that we might have a civilised conversation as two equally civilised adults.”
He didn’t let himself think of Harry, praying only that the Gryffindor would for once in his bloody life stay put and let Draco handle it. Because, while it was true Draco had garnered his fair share of enemies over the years, there wasn’t a doubt in his mind that Avada Kedavra had been meant for a certain lighting-scarred Boy Who Lived. If Draco had been caught in the crossfire, the hooded figure likely wouldn’t have minded much at all, but Harry was his primary target.
And before anyone could say anything else, she turned on her heel and stalked right back down the hallway, never looking back once.
Ron, too, winced ever so slightly. But then he nodded, eyes resolutely trained on his clasped hands. “Right, okay. So…Harry. Mate. Look, you should know you’re my best friend. Completely and totally, without a doubt. Honestly, you’re practically family. A brother, if you will.”
He looked and sounded almost threatening, a warning in all but words, eyes drilling into Draco’s as though daring him to refuse, to play it all off as a simple fling or dalliance.
Draco gave a chuckle, but it sounded as miserable as he looked. “I can see that. But it doesn’t matter anymore, truly. Forgive and forget and all that, right?”
No, ‘angry’ didn’t cut it. The word ‘angry’ implied something small, something fleeting, like when Harry got mad at Ron for eating the last slice of pizza or when Hermione’s constant, incessant nagging got on his nerves. ‘Angry’ was never more than a small little flame, sputtering brighter at times and fainter at others, depending on the situation at hand. ‘Angry’ was brief, controllable.
Parkinson made a sound halfway between a gag and a scoff. “One more word, Malfoy, and I’ll go after you with a kitchen knife myself.”
And before Draco could even process those words, the unmistakable tip of a wand bored itself into the back of his skull, and a deep, calm voice purred just above his ear, “Drop the wand, Malfoy.”
Draco narrowed his eyes and replied harshly, gaze interlocked with Harry’s and glinting ever so fiercely, “Frankly, Potter, I would rather eat this bloody book than give your precious Nic another chance.”
Blaise sent him an apologetic look. “And he and Ginevra found him in some dark, deserted alleyway near Knockturn Alley, lying in a puddle of his own blood.”
Harry rolled his eyes and plopped down in the chair beside Pansy, and the two of them immediately fell back into conversation, which in all likelihood consisted of Pansy criticising his wardrobe and Harry vehemently defending it. But Draco could only guess, because the thunderous pounding of his heart was so loud it drowned out all else.
Before he could ramble on, there was a flash of silver-blond and then Draco’s arms were around him. Unlike Ron’s earlier bear-hug, though, Draco’s hug was gentle, cautious, and yet no less warm, no less affectionate. More so, even, and Harry found himself momentarily unable to breathe at the sheer intensity of
And so, quietly, all the while still smiling, he slipped out the door, and left Harry to his well-deserved rest.
Fortunately, before such demeaning urges could be acted upon, Weasley turned to Hermione, eyes accusatory. “You knew, didn’t you?”
And suddenly Draco’s heart felt constricted again, as though some invisible pair of hands had reached right inside his chest and started kneading it like dough, pulling and prodding and twisting it in the most unnatural of ways.
Not even that caused a crack in Blaise’s sombre expression, and that was the exact moment Draco knew the situation—whatever it may be—was
“Don’t you ‘Head Auror Robards’ me, Harry,” she said coldly, and Harry felt like he was getting emotional whiplash here. Had Ginny’s moods been this erratic when they’d been dating? He didn’t think so.
His frown only deepened when he reached their table, especially when Pansy said gleefully, “There he is, my masterpiece! My ugly-duckling-turned-swan! What do you think, boys, doesn’t he look so much more like a Saviour?”
The stranger shook his head. “No. There are no other ways to go about it. There is only the one, and this here is it. But I wouldn’t expect the likes of you to understand.”
Harry could only gape as the blond cleared his throat again, opened his mouth, closed it again, and went as red as the wallpaper behind Harry’s head.
With one large stride he was at Harry’s side, and before the Gryffindor could so much as open his mouth to protest, Draco was clutching his forearm and dragging him out the room.
Harry ducked his head and started across the pub, and although Draco wanted to say something as the Gryffindor passed, reach out for his arm and apologize for getting carried away—he didn’t. He let Harry go, and followed him dutifully, chin high, shoulders tense, silent as they walked through the pub, out the door and into the cooler air outside.
The thought sent an inexplicable burst of warmth into his chest, and Harry found himself thinking yet again of that day at Malfoy Manor; Malfoy’s silver-grey eyes, wide and fearful and scared for once not only for himself but for his family as well. The Slytherin had studied Harry, eyes raking across his disfigured features as though they held the answers to the world, and Harry had known the moment the Malfoy heir stepped up to identify Harry that he’d recognized him. But then something had happened. Something had changed in the Slytherin’s wide-eyed gaze, if only for a millisecond, and something had flashed in his silver eyes—and he’d turned to his father and aunt and denied Harry’s identity.
And then they were full-out snogging again, just as fiercely, just as spellbindingly as they had the evening before, and it left Draco’s mind a wreck, an unsalvageable, wonderful wreck full of joy and excitement and love—so, so much love, except that was the one thing he couldn’t let Harry see, not yet, not when all of this was so new.
Harry visibly deflated and returned the hug without hesitation, a small, affectionate smile playing across his lips. “Thanks, Mione. Love you too.”
I’ve been working on this chapter for the past three weeks, and there have been so many drafts of it that I’ve honestly lost count. This particular one was made in the timespan between now and yesterday 1AM, and I’m still not entirely happy with it. But I reckon if I don’t just post this now I won’t ever, plus I need to post something today, so.
Okay, that’s all for now. Again, thank you so, so, so much for reading! You guys are literally the best!!
Draco had to hand it to the youngest Weasley—she could be quite an intimidating sight when she wanted to be. A spitfire, much like his mother and Pansy. Honestly, Draco wouldn’t be surprised if that was one of the main reasons Harry had gotten together with her in the first place; the Chosen One truly did seem to be unnaturally drawn to the dangerous.
was a lie as big as it came. Imagine if Draco hadn’t found Harry that night outside in the alley, or if he’d gotten cold feet and left him at the hospital (because, hate the notion as he might, Draco knew that had been a real possibility), thus forcing Robards to assign some other Auror to Harry’s side, some random stranger, someone who would only see it as a job, an assignment to check off the list.
Pansy’s smirk returned in full force, and she flicked a strand of raven hair over her shoulder, looking equal measures haughty and pleased. “Don’t sound so shocked, Potter. I’m full of surprises. And I think, if you’re going to share a flat with my best friend, you really ought to start calling me Pansy.”
within him that he’d been barely able to function, let alone healthily dismantle his grief. Then had come the pain, and afterwards—and only afterwards—the tears.
“What do you want, Yaxley?” he gritted out. “To kill me? Because if that’s your big goal, then I feel like you need to re-evaluate your life choices. Bit obsessive, wouldn’t you agree?”
Had Harry been smiling too much? Laughing too hard? Had Draco seen through him, realised where Harry’s traitorous mind sidled off to in the moments he found himself staring too long, the moments his mind went blank and the fluttery something in his chest grew unignorable?
Harry whirled around, grinning, wand pointed at Draco, who in turn already had his wand pointed at Harry. They both came to a screeching stop, wands drawn, eyes locked, both waiting for the other to attack first.
Malfoy wrinkled his pert nose. Harry was silently glad for the familiar sneer—the earlier panic in Malfoy’s eyes, accompanied by something else, something Harry couldn’t quite put a name to, had been
The rest of their breakfast was actually, genuinely…nice. They talked a bit more, mostly about their respective work at the DMLE, and Quidditch, of course. Draco could have started sobbing in relief when they’d managed to sit through the entire rest of the meal without a single mention of the war, the trials, Hogwarts, or, god forbid,
here?” He spat the name out as though it were an insult, which, Draco supposed, to Weasley and many other witches and wizards in Britain, it very well was.
Out of the corner of his eye, Draco could see Harry’s expression morph into one of confusion. “What letter?”
“Draco, are you—” Harry began tentatively, taking a step towards him, and there was worry lacing his tone, coating his expression, worry and concern.
And then he looked over Takeuchi’s head, at the glass wall separating him and Takeuchi from Draco and Harry. The glass wall inlaid with so many enchantments and spells it should be absolutely impossible for him to see.
The attention was nothing unusual anymore—no, although it still irked him plenty, he’d gotten used to it. But this wasn’t the usual ‘Oh look, it’s Harry Potter, the Boy Who Lived, Savior of the wizarding world’ sort of attention. It was ‘Oh look, it’s Harry Potter, I wonder who his soulmate is’. And for some reason the latter bothered him a lot more than the former.
!” Draco barked (although a ‘strangled yelp’ would likely be the more apt description), all the while hoping that Harry really was as oblivious as he’d led them all to believe this past decade and not secretly incredibly perceptive. That, and also that his face wasn’t red as a beetroot.
idea how worried we were? You can’t just do that, Harry, leave without telling anyone where you’d gone, especially not at a time like this! How is it you still can’t get into that thick, thick skull of yours that
Harry quickly blinked again, shaking himself out of his momentary daze, wondering what the bloody hell had come over him. He cleared his throat, averting his own gaze, and said, “She was wrong. What Craigs said back there, about you being a disgrace—she was wrong, simple as that. You turned on Voldemort and your father, yes. But it was the right thing to do. Their ideals were corrupt and immoral, and even though you were brought up to take them as gospel, you managed to question and ultimately abandon them. If you ask me, that’s not weakness or betrayal; that’s strength.”
“Frankly, Mr. Potter, if you went through with it, I’d be very surprised indeed. We both know you’re too
Harry was surprised once again when neither Malfoy’s snooty sneer nor haughty tone triggered the usual wave of anger. But, no. The schoolboy rivalry, the insults, the sneers, that was all strictly in the past. They were both capable, responsible adults now.
And just like that Harry was thinking about Draco again, of all the times they’d sat across from each other in the living room, the Slytherin curled up by the fireplace, reading that leather-bound book of his, always reacting annoyed when Harry interrupted him or asked him something or even just breathed too loud. Except then Harry would say something to provoke him, and Draco would slam his book shut with a sneer and launch into a volley of insults, and then Harry would respond in sort, and then after a few rounds of to-and-fro those insults would get so ridiculous one of them would inevitably crack up, and then they’d just sit there in the living room for hours on end and joke and laugh and talk, and—
Harry couldn’t believe his ears. Sure, he’d known Blaise was much cooler a bloke than Harry’d ever given him credit for during their Hogwarts days, but this was next level. This was almost like something…something a
There was only a wretched sort of misery. Misery, and sadness, and guilt, and Draco found himself stunned into silence.
“You should go to St. Mungo’s,” Jennings said, looking genuinely concerned now, which only vexed Draco further. “Maybe that maniac hit you with a curse after all, and it’s only now taking effect.”
Now, Draco was not a romantic, just so that’s clear. Yes, admittedly, he enjoyed sappy romance novels and old muggle ‘Rom-Coms’ (Pansy’s doing, suffice to say) just as much as the next person. But that was it. He was a firm realist, as all Malfoys ought to be, for it was no good dwelling on dreams and fantasies when you had an estate to run.
Harry snorted, but the relief that crashed over him was far from subtle. “I wish. Then I could’ve saved a shit-ton of money after the war.” At Malfoy’s questioning look, Harry sighed and explained, “Hermione decided I needed to see someone to talk to about my, err, problems. She said it wasn’t healthy to keep it all boxed in. I did, for a few months.” Harry rubbed the back of his neck. “Don’t get me wrong, I know therapists—err, Mind Healers—can really help people. It just didn’t work for me. Relieved me of a lot of gold, though.” Harry gave a strained laugh, suddenly uncomfortable under Malfoy’s unblinking stare.
Draco led the way into the kitchen, and at first Harry didn’t even notice the smell, too preoccupied with the unruly jumble of mush that had become his mind as of late. However, the tangy, aromatic scent of curry was not something easily ignored, and so by the time Draco had come to a stop in front of the kitchen counter, where multiple paper bags contained mountains upon mountains of stacked takeout-boxes, Harry realised just what it was he was seeing.
Blaise was standing beside him, Harry noticed, looking worried. And rightfully so—the typically so put-together blond looked absolutely horrendous. His hair was the messiest Harry had ever seen it, and his robes were actually ruined, that’s how dirty and torn they were. But that wasn’t what made Harry’s chest tighten in worry; it was the look in Draco’s eyes that did it, like someone had died, and that pain was so stark Harry could almost feel it himself.
Harry stood, fishing a handful of coins from his jean pocket and dropping them on the table. “It’s getting dark,” he said without looking at Draco. “We should go.”
. If you’re itching for a fight so badly, I kindly ask you to take it outside. But if you want to stay within these walls, you all need to calm down.” He frowned. “I understand this is stressful for everyone, but Potter will be
, to say the least. “Know is one word for it. But yes, I’m…familiar with Renaults and Co. My father used to do business with them. The owner, Philomena Craigs, is an old family friend of sorts.”
Nic nodded, and although he didn’t look particularly pleased, Harry didn’t get the impression he was incredibly angry either, so he fully counted it as a win.
Harry blinked, caught off guard, only to find Healer Preedan looking at him expectantly, while Healer Hodkinson scowled at the floor, Ron watched him nervously and Ginny stood at his side, arms crossed, frowning.
They materialised on the sidewalk outside, only to be immediately drenched by bullet-like raindrops pelleting down from the dark sky above. Within, seconds Draco found himself soaked from head to toe, dragonhide boots and hairstyle included (admittedly, the latter had been ruined hours ago, after he may or may not have suffered a nervous breakdown of sorts, but
For one afternoon, Draco had allowed himself to relax. He’d listened to Blaise’s stories of all the outlandish maladies he’d encountered so far during his apprenticeship at St. Mungo’s, let Pansy rant about the French designer she was currently apprenticing under and how horrid his temper was, followed Theo’s explanations of the invention he was currently working to perfect, and inquired about whichever magical creature Greg was busy working with over in Scotland. It had been an afternoon of catching up with friends he’d not seen for quite some time now, seeing as, after the war, they’d all made sure to stay well out of the limelight.
And—for let it be known that, contrary to public opinion, Harry Potter did still possess the most basic of self-preservation instincts—he heeded the Slytherin’s command and, careful not to so much as glance back over at Draco, with his stupid hair and stupid silver eyes, turned on his heel and fled.
Draco could only sit there in mute astonishment, both at the soulmark and the story and the fact that Yaxley was telling him this in the first place.
. It was as simple as that, and it was as hard as that. He wanted it so much it was suddenly all he could think about, all he could feel; he wanted it more than he’d ever wanted anything in his entire life, needed it more than he could ever remember needing something.
But above the sirens, Draco could hear his own heartbeat as it drummed against his ribcage, his blood rushing in his ears, droning out all else. He took one last step forwards, and then he stood just a foot away from the cloak-bundled man, so close he could reach out and yank back his hood if he so desired, finally see who it was that so adamantly wished to kill Draco’s soulmate.
And then stopped dead in his tracks when he walked in on a glaring-contest between Draco and, much to Harry’s surprise, Nic. Which is to say, Draco was sitting in his usual armchair, back ramrod straight, glowering at the brunet as though he were some deformed cross of a flobberworm and a fire slug, while Nic just stood by the fireplace, awkwardly clutching a little basket, expression caught somewhere between dislike and pure discomfort.
Robards didn’t look pleased, but his scowl had eased up slightly, and he nodded as well. “Good. Now that that’s settled, I really must be off.” He glanced at Potter. “Don’t rush the recovery, understand, Potter? You’re no use to anyone dead.” And with that, he turned on his heel, strode past Draco with a minuscule nod, and disappeared out the door.
And maybe Harry wouldn’t want him, maybe he wouldn’t love him back, maybe he’d decide their friendship wasn’t worth it after all, not when Draco wanted
On a different note: Harry is totally the stupid, oblivious imbecile we all know and love, and I'm here for it.
Hermione opened her mouth, closed it again, then opened it once more to reply, “Thank you, Malfoy. I—we appreciate you saying that.”
Draco continued to glare down at him and Harry continued to glare up, neither so much as blinking lest the other think they’d won. Except staring directly into the Slytherin’s eyes was quite a lot harder than he’d have expected, possibly due to the startling silver intensity of them, and it made Harry realise two things:
It was like a Crucio, only ten, twenty, thirty times worse, and instead of rippling through his entire body, from his head to his feet, it remained focused solely on his stomach-area, burning his skin and clawing out his intestines and ripping him to pieces second by second.
Draco started at the words, nearly dropping the steaming mug of tea currently clasped in his hands. Across the kitchen, the object of his affections regarded Draco with an amused twinkle in those green eyes of his, head all the while tilted to the side.
The dismissal was as subtle as a fist to the nose, and Harry could only gape at Draco, whose smile and gaze were focused entirely on Nic, who in turn stood there for a long moment, evidently torn between standing his ground and leaving as he’d wanted to do from the start. In the end, though, the latter won out, and he shot one last narrow-eyed look at Draco, before turning to face Harry.
Blaise immediately copied her gleeful grin. “Oh yes, so much better. Why, he looks positively dashing. I especially love the earring. Don’t you agree, Draco?”
, who Draco had left in the care of Granger and Weasley for the hour he’d be here dealing with Yaxley. To grab his soulmate and take him somewhere none of this shite could reach them, where no one could find them or hurt them or want something from them, no deranged Death Eaters, no overprotective Aurors, no press, no one at all.
When they broke apart again, Draco didn’t go far, instead settling his forehead against Harry’s and whispering with a mischievous, oh-so-Slytherin smirk, the sort that made his eyes dance and flicker like two licks of silver flame, “To be perfectly frank, so am I.”
that? Of course I was out of line! Everything we’d discussed before, the progress we made—I acted like none of it ever happened! Why aren’t you pissed?
, for Salazar’s sake! “It’s in your best interest to comply to our questions. Death threats are not going to help.”
Yaxley simply nodded, lips quirking, as though he knew something the rest of them did not and was basking in the knowledge. “Yes.”
Of course, the moment Malfoy realized that last fact, his eyes went wide and he started spluttering as though someone had hexed him, robbing him of the ability to form coherent sentences. “Bloody hell, Potter, I knew you had no taste whatsoever—that much is painfully obvious in the way you dress—but
Weasley didn’t appear at all placated, but still he shut his mouth and averted his gaze. Had he still not been so shell-shocked by Robards’ most recent verdict, Draco would have been impressed. The man wasn’t Head Auror for nothing.
The owl had obviously taken Harry’s request to heart, for less than a half hour later, it was back carrying yet another gold-sealed letter. Harry immediately hurried to get it, tearing it open and scanning its contents. And although it was clear Robards wasn’t entirely pleased with the idea either, Harry’s faith in Malfoy must have been persuading enough, for the Head Auror had ultimately agreed to the plan.
However, he forced himself to remain calm and composed, at least outwardly, and offered a stiff nod, falling into step behind Potter as he and the other two Aurors made their way down the alley to the small, dilapidated-looking shop with the silver-lettered, cherry-wood sign proclaiming in large cursive letters ‘Renaults and Co.’.
So, Harry simply said, “I never claimed you weren’t. Obviously, you are, otherwise Robards wouldn’t have assigned you to me.” He stood, and Malfoy looked up from where he’d once again fixed his gaze on the empty fireplace, eyes wary. Harry stretched out a hand. “Look, I know we’ve never really gotten along. But I’m willing to let bygones be bygones, if you are, too. I think we’ve both outgrown such childish petulance, right?”
Malfoy blinked, and instantly that detached, indecipherable mask was back as he fixed the letter with an unreadable stare. “Renaults and Co., you said?”
He’d go somewhere else. But where? Malfoy Manor was out as well, for the same reason as Harry’s flat, as were all his friend’s apartments, and—
“He’s quite nice, don’t you think, Harry?” Parvati was already continuing, oblivious to where Harry’s attention lay. “And rather handsome, too. Personally, I couldn’t like him as anything more than a friend, even without the obvious issue of gender. But Nic really seemed to like you a lot. He mentioned you might meet up at the pub sometime soon…?”
However, Harry had just turned twenty. By wizarding law, he’d been an adult for over three years now. And while he certainly didn’t mind being single, Harry at the same time couldn’t quite shake the feeling he was supposed to have
“No, really,” she said when he huffed indignantly. “You’re lucky Potter’s so bloody oblivious when it comes to love, otherwise you’d be done for. Merlin, Draco, I’ve been here for five minutes and the sheer amount of
“Anyway,” said Blaise, crossing his arms from where he still stood in the doorway, his white Healer’s robes falling open to reveal a green dress shirt with black trousers underneath. Jesus, Harry thought incredulously, were all Slytherins this…
Blaise shook his head, still grinning, but Draco didn’t miss how his left hand surreptitiously flew to his right wrist, tugging at the sleeve of his white healer robes. Instead of a name, his soulmark was still nothing but a simple
“That’s very considerate of you, Ma-…Draco.” Although evidently still surprised, Hermione’s words were warm and heartfelt.
Draco snorted and shook his head. “Salazar, Potter, relax. I’m not offended.” His face softened. “Quite the opposite, as a matter of fact. Do you really believe that? That I
Draco groaned, dramatic enough Harry just knew he’d be covering his face with both his hands right about now if Harry weren’t so firmly holding on to one. “Salazar’s balls, Potter, I don’t even know what that
Malfoy again gave a theatre-worthy sigh, but in truth Harry didn’t think the Slytherin was all that annoyed. Much more likely, he was just being his usual overdramatic self, physically unable to
Draco went very, very still—so very still, in fact, he wasn’t entirely certain he was still breathing. His chest certainly felt tight enough, and the silence engulfing the kitchen was suddenly so thick and impenetrable one could have heard a pin drop.
Harry sighed again, ignoring the way Draco’s eyes narrowed at the sound. “Of course I have hobbies. But they’re all outside, aren’t they?” He was itching to go flying again, but he doubted Draco would go for it. Christ, Harry had never thought staying inside would be so bloody
“Merlin,” said Harry, slightly breathless. “You weren’t kidding when you said we needed to hurry. Bloody hell, you’d think Yaxley was right on your heels, that’s how fast you—wait, where are you going?”
Draco barked an entirely mirthless laugh, and it echoed off the cold, bare walls of the interrogation room. “Are you, now? So you didn’t point-blank refuse to give up your accomplice yesterday, because, and I quote, it’s ‘simply too much fun watching us squirm’? Was that your evil twin who said that?
you, boy.” The Death Eater gave a particularly deranged cackle. “You’re done for, don’t you realise, you and your precious Potter both, your father ensured that when he helped me k—”
He’d just helped himself to a piece of Draco’s chocolate cake—which, it should be stressed, was absolutely delicious, despite the fact that most of it had ended up in Harry’s sink—when a crash sounded and Hermione tumbled into sight, bushy hair even more of a mess than usual. Draco gave a start, nearly dropping his book.
He marched across the room to where Harry was leaning against the wall, head in hands, and he wrapped his arms around him in a hug. Harry started, surprised, but Draco didn’t let go, and thankfully, Harry didn’t shove him away either. A second passed, and then Harry’s arms settled around Draco’s back as well.
Why remained a mystery to him. God knows he had more than enough reasons to cry, to lay curled up in his bed, curtains drawn, and sob until his eyes were sore. He used to think he’d used up all his tears in the year directly after the war, that he’d depleted his tear-stash to the point of ruin. There’d been too many lives lost, too many people irretrievably gone, too many names to mourn and faces to miss.
idea how hard it is to come up with the perfect plan?” The man chuckled, but the icy bitterness of it sent another round of goosebumps up Harry’s arms. “No, my bad, of course you wouldn’t. You’re
They both chuckled at that, and that’s when Draco remembered the stranger; he’d been part of the pack of Gryffindors that had nearly kicked down the door to Harry’s hospital room on the night of the poisoning. So, clearly, he wasn’t a stranger to Harry. Draco’s eyes turned assessing as he took in this Nic-person. He was tall and reasonably handsome, Draco supposed, with his blue eyes and curly hair and annoying fucking dimples, wearing a smile far too wide as he regarded Harry.
A flicker of something Harry couldn’t place flashed in Draco’s eyes, but then it was gone again, and the Slytherin simply grinned back. “You wish, Potter.”
do you lot think I am to believe I’d try to murder the Boy Who Lived, Vanquisher of Evil, Slayer of the Dark Lord himself—
Harry stared at the Slytherin, incredulous. “Why not? It makes sense for you to be there. If you can manage to get the owner to talk, we’ll be a hell of a lot wiser than we are now. The sooner we find out who did this, the sooner it’ll all be over, and we can both go back to our lives. Isn’t that what you want? Stop being ‘stuck with me’?”
“Well, Ginevra,” Draco said in his most cool and level tone and offered her his most toothy smile. “There’s a reason for that.”
the experience truly was. Not because Harry was the best kisser in the universe—although Draco legitimately believed this to be true; not that he’d ever
Harry was still deep in thought when, across the alleyway, something caught his attention. It was a lone, hooded figure, slipping out of the shadows coming from the direction of Knockturn Alley.
—Draco couldn’t stop thinking about it. Because, while he’d fantasized so often about being friends one day with Harry Potter, about being able to do things like this, go out to a pub and just talk and laugh and not get into a row every time either of them opened their mouths, it had always been just that—a fantasy. But now it appeared as though Draco might finally be getting his wish after all.
Potter flushed darker. “Yes, I know. I won’t be mad or anything if you don’t want to answer, it’s just… The way you were acting made it seem as though…as though…”
The other Gryffindors looked up to, and Harry was frowning slightly as he studied Draco. Draco immediately stiffened, alarmed, only to then chide himself for it. There was no way Harry would be able to see through the mask Draco had perfected over the course of most of his life; Harry, the oblivious Gryffindor who likely hadn’t even noticed his ex-girlfriend glowering at Draco as though he were the very bane of her existence. There was simply no way.
But, no—he knew why. This vulnerable, slightly self-conscious person sitting on the armchair across from Harry’s, one foot tucked under the other leg, book sprawled open across his lap—this was the real Draco. The one Harry assumed the Slytherin had either hidden away during Hogwarts for the sake of saving face, or simply hadn’t discovered yet himself. But one thing Harry knew for certain, and that was that the old Draco Malfoy, the one that had made Harry’s life a living hell, the one that had called Hermione a mudblood—he had left the picture right alongside Lucius Malfoy as the latter was carted off to Azkaban.
“Tell me what’s going on,” said Harry, but the words didn’t carry half the gentleness they usually would. No, he was still too angry at the prick for
“Draco and I are dating,” he admitted. “We weren’t when you and I had dinner on Monday, I swear. I would never…string you along or anything, I promise, but that’s why…well. That’s why we won’t be able to have that do over date after all. I’m sorry, but I’m serious about Draco and I could never do that to him, or you, for that matter. So. Yeah. That’s the truth. Sorry again.”
Harry stopped walking, and when Malfoy realized this, he, too, came to a standstill, looking nervous as he glanced from the ground to Harry and back.
Parvati pulled a grimace, shooting a glare first at Lavender, then Harry. Everyone laughed, including, Harry noted, Draco (why he noticed he really couldn’t say, it wasn’t like he was staring at the man or anything). Although the Slytherin was clearly trying to hide his smile, his lips curled up at the sides, nonetheless. It was rather endearing, actually. In a very normal, non-attractive sort of way.
Merlin and Morgana, how someone so utterly incompetent had managed to secure a spot as an Auror was beyond Draco. The only explanation he could come up with was that the instructors had taken one look at the man’s burly statute and decided brains were overrated anyway. Only now taking effect?
He said it with a hint of wry humour—but Harry couldn’t bring himself to laugh, or chuckle, or even smile. The resignation in the Slytherin’s tone, the quiet acceptance that a measly half-truce was all the two of them could ever be trusted to have…it was the last straw.
And Harry had faced many daunting situations before in his life. He’d faced an entire childhood of living with the Dursleys, faced dragons and dementors and basilisks and about a hundred different monsters that'd have a grown man cowering in fear. For Merlin's sake, he'd faced bloody
to think you were cruel, callous, as narrow-minded as the people I’d grown up despising. But then I got to know you, Draco, and I wasn’t kidding when I said earlier that you are brilliant. You are kind, you are considerate, you are caring—and, most importantly of all, you are
Instead, he studied the Slytherin closer. While his pale skin was flawless as ever, it was slightly darker underneath his eyes, and his usually neatly combed back white blond hair was loose, falling all the way down to his sharp cheekbones. Harry dimly noted he liked it better that way, but then immediately winced at how ridiculous that thought was.
.” The dreamy look on his mate’s face had Harry and Hermione trading another exasperated look. “And you know all ‘bout Ginny. My ickle baby sister, flying for the Holyhead Harpies.”
-century desk Lucius had had shipped over from the Continent, staring down at his father where he sat completely still and silent for one minute, two, three. He’d just stared at Draco overtop his reading spectacles with that same cold, unreadable expression Draco himself used so often to hide his true feelings from the world.
So, Harry put on a large smile and said in an effort to break the silence, “You mentioned you went to Ilvermorny, right? What was that like?”
need this right now, didn’t need fucking Weaselby interrogating him in a hospital corridor on top of everything else. “Well, believe it. I don’t have the patience nor the restraint to explain it to you right now,
But, right now, the Healer-in-training didn’t seem to find Draco’s comment at all amusing. As a matter of fact, his expression grew, if possible, even more grave.
“As much as I would love to berate you on the subject of blindly trusting strangers just because they’re passably attractive, Potter, I’m going to let it slide this once, for the sole reason that we do not have the time,” drawled the Slytherin. “Now stop gaping and
“So, Potter,” said Blaise, and Draco already knew by his smooth tone that whatever came next would not be in his favour. “We’re all curious—the Prophet’s been uncharacteristically sparse about further details on your soulmark, and although I imagine that’s due to the fact that you’ve practically been under house arrest this past week, I can’t help but wonder: any juicy gossip?”
A strained silence ensued, in which Harry didn’t know what to say, how to react. His friends’ concern was nothing new, and yet it still hit him like the Knight Bus at full-speed every time he had to watch them get all tight-faced and concerned about his wellbeing. Even now, with years and years having passed since Harry had last been even remotely near Privet Drive, such unconditional love and loyalty was oftentimes still a novel concept to him. Sometimes, Harry would still find himself wondering when his friends would finally come to their senses and realize he didn’t deserve any of it, didn’t deserve them, didn’t deserve their help or trust or affection—but that day had yet to come.
Harry had chosen his apartment because, for one, he liked the location, so close to the Ministry that, were the sudden urge to overtake him, he could walk there every morning in less than ten minutes. Secondly, there was a bloody brilliant Thai place just a few blocks down, the very same one Hermione and Ron had brought takeaway from the night before Harry’s birthday. And thirdly, because, with the help of Dean’s artistic ingenuity, he’d managed to decorate it in a way that looked almost exactly like the Gryffindor common room back at Hogwarts.
“Anyway,” said Harry, and blimey, he had no idea, did he, what havoc he had wreaked upon Draco’s perfectly satisfactory life. And all with a crooked smile and a pair of twinkling emerald eyes. “That’s all I wanted to say.”
If at all possible, Harry flushed even darker, and he averted his eyes, mouth twitching at the corners as though it couldn’t quite decide whether it’d rather form a frown, a grimace or a smile.
He sighed. “You know what, why not. Maybe you’ll be able to shed some light on the whole situation, because I’m bloody well swamped. It’s Draco. He and I…we had a row, to put it simply.”
was simply too long, and hadn’t Draco explicitly told Harry this was a bad idea, that Pansy and Blaise could come over another time if he was so keen on meeting them, that they could go shopping next month or the month after that, that Draco needed to accompany him if he went anywhere, that it wasn’t worth the risk—
A scowl overtook Nic’s face, and gone was the subtlety he’d so meticulously exercised moments before, now apparently so far gone in his loathing for Draco that he didn’t care anymore that Harry still sat at the table, his anger so deep-rooted that even worming himself into the Chosen One’s good graces took second place.
When she didn’t reply, however, Draco’s lips curled into the customary Malfoy-sneer. “Out with it; if you have a problem with me, then, please, by all means, do us both a favour and get it over with. But I must warn you, I haven’t got all day.”
Malfoy’s grey eyes found Harry’s, and for a long moment they simply stayed there, searching, assessing. Harry let them, not willing to break whatever delicate truce they’d created. Then, Malfoy averted his gaze again.
Harry was still unnaturally pale, and it was almost like someone had gone and dimmed his very essence, dimmed what was usually such a radiant glow until it was nothing but watery murkiness. But his eyes, his eyes had regained their usual brilliance, and at that moment they focused on Draco.
Because Harry cared quite a lot more about the blond git than he would have ever thought possible, and the idea of not being with him all day, of someone
Ron and he had arrived just moments before George and Angelina Disapparated to St. Mungo’s, and to say it had been a stressful few minutes would be an understatement of the most perverse proportions.
The shift in the air was palpable, and Harry didn’t quite know what to do or say as they stood there in awkward silence, a very respectable, appropriate distance in between them. But, for all his usual quick-witted eloquence, Draco didn’t seem to know, either.
Malfoy fell silent again, grey eyes trained resolutely downwards. With his platinum hair falling softly into his eyes, like strands of silvery silk, curled ever so slightly at the ends, he looked so utterly human and yet so utterly not, all Harry could do was stare.
“I suppose that answers my question,” the blond said with a little laugh, and the sound of it, light and smooth and as elegant as the rest of him, set something in Harry’s chest into motion, something soft and fluttery that wouldn’t stop squirming.
Harry opened his mouth as if to argue. But then he shut it. Looked down into his lap. Frowned. And finally, gaze still averted, he mumbled, “Fine. But you’re not going to like this.” He sighed. “It’s about your soulmark.”
Harry rolled his eyes at the disgruntled blond, but took one great big step towards him, ignoring how Malfoy practically fell backwards in a botched effort to get away from Harry, eyes downright panicked, (honestly, Harry knew they’d never been friends or anything, likely never would be, but he didn’t actually have the plague—why did Slytherins always have to be so over-the-top all the time?) and instead shoving the letter in Malfoy’s face. “Look. He says they’ve got a lead. Apparently, Acturin is so hard to come by, that there are only four places in London that sell it at all, one of which went out of business in the spring, while the other two haven’t had it in stock all year. That leaves a single possible supplier—Renaults and Co., over in Knockturn Alley. Robards says they’re going to go question the owner later today.”
A beat of silence ensued, and Harry found it unusually difficult to read Nic’s expression. He’d expected anger of some kind, after all, it was Nic Harry was on the date with Draco had so vociferously disapproved of. Plus, he’d never gotten the impression Nic much liked Draco, apology notwithstanding.
Harry blinked, looking equal measures surprised and relieved and…touched? Merlin’s beard, Draco didn’t have the emotional capacity to handle this.
All of a sudden, Harry found himself reminded of something Narcissa had said earlier, of the way she’d smiled sadly at her scowling son and said, ‘
Whatever it was, though, it had Draco gripping his boyfriend’s hand tighter still and pulling him down the corridor without another word, sure Harry would understand. After all, he figured, it was in everyone’s best interest that Draco not punch Dominic Hayes in the face then in there.
However, before Harry could shoot anything back, Weasley pulled away, hands all the while still gripping Harry’s forearms so strongly Draco was fairly certain that’d leave bruises.
And, under the starless dark night sky and colourful fireworks around him, he finally closed his eyes and let the shadows sweep him away.
“No,” Yaxley said and had the nerve to laugh. It was more a wheeze than anything, but it still chased goosebumps up Draco’s arms. “I don’t suppose you do. But that doesn’t matter. You have it anyway. Although I fear it won’t do you any good.”
“Blimey, Hermione, we could have just Apparated instead of walking here all the way from the Thai place.” The redhead groaned. “My feet feel like they’re about to fall off.”
Draco clenched and unclenched his fists. He really should just get it over with. Walk through those doors and listen to what Robards had to say, then work with that. After all, he could still protect Harry even if Robards took him off the case. Just because he wasn’t assigned to the Gryffindor anymore didn’t mean he actually had to remove himself from his soulmate’s life again.
Then, she nodded curtly, eyes still trained on Draco. “Right then. Come on in. He’s already asked to see you.”
“Look, Nic, it was so great meeting you again,” Harry said, forcing a small smile for the other man’s sake. “But I’m afraid Draco and I really ought to go now. This is our, what, fourth round of Butterbeer?” The Gryffindor gave an evidently strained laugh, but even then, the sound had such a calming effect Draco could practically feel his own anger simmer down inside of him.  “Any more Butterbeer and I’ll go into a sugar coma. But, hey, if you come here often, maybe we could meet up some time, before you have to go back to Hogwarts, eh?”
Harry nodded, only at the back of his mind thinking he should probably be more worried by all this. Only—some homicidal madman trying to murder Harry in the most agonizing way possible? Same old, same old. Whoever was up there, pulling the strings, really ought to come up with something a bit more creative next time.
And thirdly, as he toppled backwards, his free hand instinctively reached out to grasp on to whatever object was nearest to slow his fall. Only the nearest object wasn’t an object at all, but a Draco, and so when Harry went crashing down, Draco, whose shirt collar was now firmly fisted in Harry’s hand, went crashing down, too.
, what alternate dimension was this—and immediately looked to the floor with an especially laboured harrumph, expression tortured, like he couldn’t quite riddle out himself what the fuck had just happened.
Draco’s gaze drifted for the millionth time that night to the closed door across the hallway. Merlin, he really was so royally fucked.
Before any further bitter thoughts regarding Harry being kicked off his own case could find their way into his mind, Harry busied himself retrieving a plate from the cupboard, ladling it with what was left of the fried rice.
Hello my dear readers! I have a feeling you'll like this chapter...get ready for some teeth-rotting fluff ;)
A bed, on which the sleeping, mussy-haired form of one Harry Potter lay sprawled across the red covers, one leg dangling over the side of the bed, chest rising and falling in slow, soft breaths. The sight robbed Draco of his own breath. Even when in the company of his closest friends, Harry never stopped being alert, guarded, as though someone might come jumping out of the shadows at any moment and start wildly flinging curses. After all Harry’s been through, it was no wonder.
. Why, I have half a mind to drag you home myself and put a sticking charm on the bed if that’s what it takes to get you to get some goddamn rest for once in your
Draco glanced once more at Harry before leaving, because apparently he had about as much self-control as Ronald sodding Weasley. When he did, he was both surprised and delighted to find Harry already staring up at him, though the Gryffindor looked away again, flustered, the moment their eyes met.
The softness of the image, the pure affection swirling in those emerald green eyes—it sent a warm, serene sort of feeling through Draco, the type that reminded him of the many weekends spent outside by the Great Lake, enjoying the warm rays of sun and pleasant breeze as it gusted through his hair, laying in the grass and listening to Pansy recount the latest gossip, or Blaise rant about whichever essay they had due the next Monday.
And, just like Draco knew he would, Yaxley only smiled. “You’re looking at this all wrong, I’m afraid.”
—smiled. "What am I doing here, you mean?" He laughed, which made Harry feel a tiny bit less horrible for asking. Still, he could feel an uncomfortable blush spread up his face.
Pansy gave him her most deranged-looking smile yet. “You’re such a doll, I can see why Draco likes you.” Beside her, Draco appeared to choke on air. But Pansy was already continuing brightly, oblivious to her friend’s crisis, “We’re going out shopping on the weekend, by the way—me, Draco, Blaise, maybe a few others. Or, we’d planned to, until Draco here got himself joined at the hip with you. He can’t leave you alone, apparently, but if you were there as well…” She shrugged. “Think about it, Potter—unless that’s too much Slytherin for you to handle.” The challenge in her tone was evident, which Harry was sure was intentional.
. We’ve been out an hour already, and I’ve been neither poisoned nor assaulted. So tone down the worry, will you? Otherwise I’ll have to start thinking you
"That's my other stop I need to talk to McGonagall there is only one person Harry would allow and that's Madam Pomfrey if I can convince the headmistress this isn't a joke she'll go to the ends of the earth for Harry. I don't think the wizarding world knows what it has done to it's hero." Draco fell silent, a dark promising look in his silvery eyes.
"I do love a good bit of Telly myself, And now you no longer feel the drive to change the Wizarding world?" Gloria smiled softly.
" I always liked Altair if we are going for a Black name, I'm not well versed in mythology though to give an opinion on that matter, Altair Regulus is a nice name." Harry started dreamily perching himself on Draco's desk legs kicking out playfully.
Hermione blinked at the Malfoy Matron then glanced up at Marcus' face, the few days at the manor she had been alone with him he never did anything to show his untrustworthiness. She hardly knew the man But He had just killed a man for her, the man who used and broke her. Harry trusted Draco, Draco trusted Marcus, this was her new Mantra every time she doubted the quiet man. Her brain processed the opportunity Cissy was offering a chance for Marcus to prove to her how trustworthy he was outside of the Manor.
"Very well Lord Flint as the 'Victim's' sponsor naturally the job to fight falls to you, do you object to the challenge?" The Chief Warlock turned to Marcus.
"That is rather strange at the very least you should have at least 6 or 7 Potter properties and last I knew the Black's held 12 sounds fishy to me. I shall look into it Harry don't worry I figure out what happened. And now that I hold Proxy for you on everything I can take names and destroy those who have obviously kept you from everything that belongs to you. It may take me awhile but I will get to the bottom of this." Draco vowed.
"I do not know if I will ever be ready to be around so many people, I want to do something to help people. I may help Draco with his wolfs bane alternative cure project. Severus left behind a legacy that I wish to see fulfilled even if it's giving Draco majority credit for the brewing." Hermione laughed.
"Right the rest of you are Pureblood and have never read Shakespear. He is the most famous muggle writer, Perdita is one of the main Characters in My mother's favorite play, 'The Winter's Tale' They always wanted to name their daughter for a character from the play, Hermione is the male lead’s Mother the Queen of Sicily." Hermione sighed.
"Right I promised you a day that I would take you to all the places you never got to do in the muggle world. I promised to take you to see a movie at the cinema, when I got back from Australia. I promised to take you to Thorpe park, I can't believe I forgot, we were gonna take George get him out of his funk after Fred bugger." Hermione groaned taking a bite of her food.
Draco strode down the hall and back into the nursery where his mother was shushing a crying infant. She smiled at her son who looked so distracted since the day he brought home the small child she held and the Harry Potter the savior of the Wizarding world.
But he wasn’t the only one with a make-over over the summer. Harry himself has become taller and broader. He wasn’t the scrawny little teenage boy anymore. His hair was as unruly as ever but he wore it shorter with side cuts. The old round glasses were replaced by new hipster glasses.
In the safety of the Slytherin dorms, Draco had a little break down. He really was proud of himself for holding it in the entire day.
Harry leaned back, rubbing his eyes. He suddenly felt very tired. “Even if – and that’s a big if – I would want to get together with Malfoy, I can’t. He’s with Parkinson.”
But too soon Malfoy packed his school bag and dragged Harry into the Great Hall for dinner. They sat at the Ravenclaw table again.
“Could I see both your hands, please?” the ministry worker performed a spell over their hands and nodding to himself made a few notes. He looked up at them, beaming. “Congratulations, Mr. and Mr. Potter, you’re legally bonded. That’s the strongest marriage bonding spell, I’ve ever seen.”
“Yeah, I know. But I have to talk to her properly, she’s still my friend and I owe her an explanation.” Draco shrugged.
Harry wasn’t able to answer. Fixed on the tattoos he impulsively streched out his hand but froze in his movement when he heard an angry hiss, „
By now Draco just clutched my shirt tightly as if his life depended on it. “I was so scared you wouldn’t come back.”
Soon he noticed that the beggar liked treacle tart especially and the dish became his best practiced one.
Draco sighed deeply. Dobbys accident with the wine was a very good excuse to delay the meeting with the suitors. He regretted firing Dobby so harshly, he was a loyal and able servant. But Draco was in a very, very bad mood today. Normally his pouting was enough to get what he wanted, but his father held firm this time. So Draco needed to make a scene. He even kicked the poor servant in the stomach. Hopefully that frightened some marriage punters off.
I watched trough my eye-slids as a fuming blonde strode in my direction. Damn, an angry Draco was hot as fuck. I mean, he was angry a lot. But right now was a whole new level. Draco was livid, he was furious. I stifled a moan. Now was not a good moment to get a stiffy.
Desperately thinking, the prince had to realize that a few hours had passed and he still had no thread. Angrily he had to admit to himself that he had not succeeded in spinning.
The day was torture. Potter had such a curious nature and asked him all kinds of questions. It was hard enough to ignore him for a few hours. He couldn’t do it again, he was sure of it. But he kind of wanted for it to happen again. Maybe Potter would step out of line again, soon. Draco certainly wouldn’t try anything himself.
So Draco washed his hands and took off his apron. He put on a brown cap to hide his golden hair. Then he followed the other servants up to the banquet hall.
“Draco, darling!” Narcissa exclaimed and flung herself at her son. She kissed his cheeks, slapped him and kissed him again. “How could you elope like that! I understand, it’s romantic, but the childs wedding is a mothers dream! And you wore such a silly dress, you looked like a five year old girl. Don’t pout, darling”, Narcissa admonished and nudged his nose. “You were a very sweet bride. Promise me to have a grand anniversary party next year, that you’ll let me organize, and you will be forgiven.”
“Grandma told me, the dragon is your husband, is that true?” Teddy looked up at Harry with wide eyes.
Now he was holding Potters stupid hand, being prodded with stupid questions once again. But this time, Potter also rubbed soothing circles with his thumb onto Dracos hand. Draco couldn’t hold it anymore. “Just what do you want from me, Potter?” Draco threw his arms up in exasperation, lifting Potters left arm up, too, so they made an awkward laola-wave.
A few minutes later, Harry sat happily in Defence Against the Dark Arts holding the hand of one grumbling Malfoy. He couldn’t help the grin that split his face in half. Malfoys pouting face was really cute.
“If you think I would sit with a bunch of brutes, you are sorely mistaken, Potter”, Malfoy hissed and turned towards the Slytherin table.
When they were called to dinner, Draco overheard Bill saying to Harry “People who speak French are something else, mate. You got a good one there.” Bill clapped Harrys shoulder.
Two months later, Draco had become accustomed to life with Harry. They were both back at their jobs now, so there was less time, they could spend together. They still went on dates regularly. They held hands, pecked their cheeks and cuddled on the sofa while watching TV. But they hadn’t done more than that. It didn’t feel quite right, yet.
, because Harry had escaped death 4 times until now and his godfather Sirius almost got killed last year. He and his friends lived in constant danger when they searched for Horcruxes. He wasn’t so sure if he would survive another attack from Voldemort and thus wanted to live everyday to the fullest like it was his last. So he had Sirius ink his skin as a reminder of that.
"Harry, I know you care for him and I admire you for helping him to change. But it cannot be ruled out that his character will be spoilt forever. What if he does not change? You took responsibility for him when you married him and you can't just throw him away when he doesn't change as you want him to." Hermione was very worried.
As if I would believe him. Ron was already stuffing his mouth with pancakes, jam running down to his chin. Urgh. Looking at Malfoy was a much more appetizing sight than that.
"How is this possible?" Draco was stunned. His Potter, who could no longer be his Potter, was Gryffindor King Potter, and still his Potter.
Ron laughed. “And what are you doing in that club? Running around, hugging people? Fuck, that image is hilarious.”
What could he do? He was just a prince who had never had to do any work with his delicate hands. He had never learned a trade. How could he survive if he couldn't do anything?
"Oh, my boy. I'm sorry if it brings up bad memories. But would you bake them again? The King showed interest in food for the first time in days when he mentioned the treacle tart."
"My dear guests," said King Harry, and his deep, sensual voice sent sent a shiver down Draco’s spine. "Now I will tell you why you are my guests today. I am going to introduce you to my spouse." A murmur went through the ballroom. The king had already married? They all thought he was only just getting wedded.
“You look like you fell into a puddle of unicorn poop” Weasley said gleefully and broke out in cackling laughter.
The Slytherin slowly advanced, backing Ron up against the wall like a lion – how ironic – it’s prey. He grabbed Ron by his robes and then smashed their lips together. Letting Rons lips go with a loud popping sound, he grinned smugly.
Two mental breakdowns and a very long shower later found Draco in the hotel restaurant with his traitorous friends chatting happily with the Gryffindor trio. Draco was squeezed in between Potter and Greg. Greg took so much space, Draco had to lean into Potter who wouldn’t budge an inch, though he had enough space left to his other side.
Seamus’ face lit up. “I could show you my newest party trick! It’s not dangerous at all, I promise! At least not if the air is humid enough.”
Draco cupped her cheek. When she was pleading so desperately, who was he to deny her? “Okay, I’ll stay at Astoria’s tonight and think about it.” He kissed her forehead and was gone, before Ginny could stop him.
Draco’s cry of „No, no, Aunt Cecile! We’re not together!” was lost on her though when Potter dragged him to the dancefloor.
Well. Harry felt slightly overwhelmed. He had a lot to process. His friends thought he was gay and had the hots for Malfoy. And if Harry was honest with himself, his reactions to the Slytherin lately made a lot more sense now. He looked up at his friends and was torn between feeling grateful and betrayed. They could have told him this sooner. And not everyone at once confronting him like this.
He dragged himself into the bathroom and threw up. Suddenly an image of the party flared up in his mind. He had drunk too much, and his memories were fuzzy. Just like last year. He was snogging with Harry in a corner of the room, when Blaise interrupted them, talking shit about making another bet (
Panicking, Draco sent his Patronus to Hermione, who came rushing to the hospital. She explained she got a Patronus from Ron, that their mission went awry, when they found the targets sooner than they thought and engaged in battle. They managed to capture the culprits, but Harry was hit with something. They already were on their way to St. Mungos.
Potter put his hand on Draco’s waist and the Slytherin immediately protested. “Potter, honestly! I vividly remember your two left feet from the Yule-Ball in fourth year! I will lead, naturally.” Draco put Potter’s hand on his shoulder and grabbed Potter by the waist. “Besides, I’m taller, midget.”
Harry couldn't answer that. He just wanted to get away from the prince who owned and effectively broke his heart.
“I’m not cute!” said Harry indignantly. Ops, had he said that out loud? “I’m a burly Auror, I’ll have you know. There’s nothing cute about that.”
"Hush", the beggar held a finger to the prince's mouth. "Do you not hear? The thrush sings... Don't frighten it away..."
Lunas face lit up and she jumped at him, pulling him into a hug. She peaked around Draco and looked at Hermione expectantly. “I really really hoped, you both would join. You both have a penchant for violence and I think this club would help you all mature.”
Hermione widened her eyes and immediately scrambled to gather all her textbooks and notes she had scattered for reviewing all over the table. I helped her grabbing all the stuff while Ron stuffed another pancake hastily in his mouth.
Hermione huffed. “You can’t be serious. McGonagall established that as punishment not as a way to bully Malfoy into dating you.”
Slowly, the blond prince reconsidered this offer. He and the king had only had a brief encounter during his father's engagement attempt. And Draco was the spouse of a beggar and looked as such. Even if he met the Gryffindor King, he would surely remain unrecognized.
“Of course, you are” Draco drawled seductively and gestured inside. “Please, do come in– wait, Potter?” Draco’s eyes nearly fell out, they went so big.
The week went by fast. Harry taught Draco how to cook and they visited Teddy often. As promised, Harry took Draco on very fancy dates. But before that, Draco insisted to get Harry a whole new wardrobe, so they went shopping.
Draco could hardly believe his ears. He sat there, staring at Potter. Potter loved him? It was not a trick? Was it real?
“Nothing!” Harry held his hands up in surrender. “I just like to see you eating so enthusiastically. It’s making me happy, if you enjoy my cooking. Can you cook?”
At the end of the lesson Harry said, “It was a pleasure holding your hand, Malfoy. Till next time.” With that he turned to go, but Malfoy grabbed his arm.
Harry also had decided to act on his feelings. He was way too impatient to take his time coming to terms with his feelings. If he wanted Draco, then he wanted him right now. Maybe he should make an elaborate wooing plan, but that wasn’t his style. Being impulsive and a little reckless was more his thing. Though to not be completely unprepared he took his time strolling around to think about what he wanted to say to the blond.
Draco wanted to protest, but he felt too weak. Hermione barely managed to drag him into the waiting area when his knees buckled.
Overwhelmed, Draco chewed. The pastry really tasted phenomenal. The red head next to him stuck his hand out. “I’m sorry about mum, she is ecstatic about the marriage thing and meeting you. I’m Bill”.
“Oh. Oh, Harry!” Draco screamed, his muscles contracting, pushing me over the edge just as Draco came.
Malfoy gave her an incredulous look. Harry just shrugged, feeling oddly happy with the knowledge of Luna approving his whatever-it-was with Malfoy.
“Are you not mad at me?” Draco asked and tentatively put his arms around Astoria, who laid her head into Dracos lap.
As soon as the beggar entered the castle he was greeted by the red-haired captain who stormed him with questions.
But the beggar was not disturbed at all. He just pulled more intensely on Draco's hand, which he still held tightly. "Come along, we have no time to rest. There are now two of us and we have to earn twice as much money."
One dance became two, three. Then Draco lost count, enjoying the warmth of Potter’s hand, the solid presence of Potter’s body pressed against his own. Potter’s hand creeped slowly but surely up Draco’s shoulder to rest at his neck, caressing gently his nape.
“I live to entertain” Draco drawled and leaned over Blaise to straighten his tie. “Ready to get married?”
In a very cosy sitting area in front of the centre window sat Hermione Granger, the king's royal advisor and best friend.
Draco moaned in disappointment as he registered reality. Right, he was now married to a beggar and had spent one night in a very shabby hut. There were no servants and he now had to use his delicate hands for work himself.
Draco looked up to Harry, bitterness of the memory, but pride in his resolve clearly written in his face. Harry squeezed the hand he didn’t noticed he had taken.
“That’s not true, Draco. You’re family, now. Nothing will ever change that, not even Harry letting you down. Please, Draco, I’m sure it’s just a misunderstanding. Harry would never hurt you like that! I just know, he cares for you deeply.” Ginny pleaded with him, but it didn’t make any sense.
Draco woke up, feeling warm and protected. Coming to his senses slowly, he registered, that he was sprawled all over Harry. Well, so much for minding the others personal space. He watched Harrys peaceful sleeping face for a while, thinking of the absurdity of their situation. Carefully not to wake Harry up, Draco finally climbed out of bed and took a shower.
Malfoys buries his head in my chest, I can feel his face growing hot and can only imagine the shade of red his cheeks adopted. “Shut up, Potter, I’m trying to sleep” Malfoy says haughtily but fails to keep the fondness out of his voice.
The day was long. But one time the lamentations will end. And because the prince was so naked and the beggar had to come home soon, he looked for a way to cover his body. He found an old blanket of rough, hard cloth and dressed himself with it.
“Are you sure about this, Harry?“, asked Ronald Weasly, King Harolds best friend and supreme captain of Gryffindors knights guard.
“You what?” Dracos voice was that high pitched, the glasses at the table began to vibrate dangerously. Potter whistled appreciatively.
“I’m so sorry, Draco. I’m so selfish! You have no obligation to stay with me. If you want I–“ he swallowed heavily between hiccups, “I’ll kill myself to set you free.”
My magic swelled and then lashed out. I screamed “What the fuck, Tom? I’ll kill you, you filthy scum!” Before Voldemort could react, I was on him, intend to punch the shit out of that bastard.
“Molly Weasley killed Aunt Bellatrix! That woman isn’t afraid of anything!” Harry was now standing directly in front of Draco and petted his head. Draco would have bitten Harry, if the touch didn’t feel so good.
Harry choked on his pumpkin juice. „I…I don’t like Malfoy! Just look at him! There definitely IS something different“, the Boy-Who-Lived-Just-To-Choke-To-Death blushed fiercely.
“For being the human shield that stood between you and getting your face polished by Hermione.” Potter’s boyish smile that made his heart flutter was the only reason why Draco accepted that stupid reason and didn’t remind the Gryffindor of promising to be a gentleman for the entire night. It was basically Potter’s duty to protect Draco.
“I–I don’t know. It felt pretty good. I was happy he finally looked at me again. I want him to keep doing that. I got this warm feeling in my stomach and my–my heart fluttered when I touched him. I want to keep touching him.” Harry blushed. Figuring out his emotions was hard. There were just so many of them when it came to the blonde.
Sighing defeatedly, Draco got out of the shower and returned to the bedroom with only a towel wrapped around his hips. He got dressed and didn’t notice Harrys hungry gaze lingering on him. Draco startled violently when he looked up and met green eyes.
Taking a shaky breath, Draco suppressed the tears that threatened to escape his eyes. Then he straightened and made his eyes steely, his voice cold. “We’re getting a divorce, right now. Or I swear to Satan, I will disfigure you all beyond recognition. I’ll make it so you’ll wish to look like that toad Dolores Umbridge. So, you all better hurry back to your rooms, pack your things and meet me at the reception in fifteen minutes, ready to portkey back to England. Did I make myself clear?”
Draco sneered, but it was only half-hearted. The blush, that was rising to his ears was giving away, how happy the blonde really was, though. “No, I don’t want to remember our wedding day as the day Voldemort hugged me. And today you’re standing in the spotlight, boy wonder. I want a real wedding, where I’m the center of attention.”
The problem was that Malfoy ignored only him. The Slytherin was the same bossy brat as always to all the others. So, when Malfoy commented on Nevilles potion, Harry saw his chance to push himself into Malfoys focus and initiate a fight.
Harrys eyes widened in shock. He had just kissed the love of his life and he was sure the blond liked it, too. Hell, Draco was even so responsive. How could Draco reject him now and insult him and his mother?
When everyone except Draco was gone, Potter busied himself with making tea. He pressed a cup into the blonds hands. Draco took a sip and instantly relaxed. Then he registered the tea was exactly how he liked it and he startled. “How do you know, how I take my tea?” Draco asked, eyes narrowed in suspicion.
So, he did what he always did when Malfoy got on his nerves – he went flying. All week, Harry had trailed after the blond for the sole purpose to find out what he was up to. And how conspiratorially Malfoy just laughed with his girlfriend, he definitely was up to no good. But Harry was left unsuccessful. And he was feeling rather frustrated and somehow a little depressed after Parkinson, that bint, had pressed her breasts against Malfoys toned arm.
"Of course I do the stupid swot turned me down wouldn't willingly give me what I wanted so I took it as is my right as a pureblood I can have whatever servant's I deem fit. Have myself a pretty bushy haired sex toy." Ron laughed a monotone cruel sound.
"Ridiculous James Potter Hair to the Potter Family legacy Not have a will he was drilled like every other pureblood to have his will updated every 5 years. That is astounding I promise they will pay for keeping things from you." Draco promised eyes darker than Harry had ever seen them.
"Hush Hermione, your poor voice has been suppressed for years, you need healing and rest and recovery now speak smaller words for now. Would you like to come home with me? Before you answer you should know I am living with the Malfoy's they rescued me . Will you have a problem living there? You also have a baby nephew there with us Altair may cry will you have an issue with that?" Harry said softly and waited for her .
"I...I.. would ... love.. to stay... but I want to ... help around here..." Harry Potter broke down sobbing trying to speak between his tears. Lavender smelling perfume surrounded his small shoulders as soft arms enveloped him in a sweet loving motherly embrace.
"See Mione they live!" Harry had stood and joined her wrapping his Arm around her and squeezed. Harry kissed her temple as they watched the baby with Remus' eyes. "Teddy say Hi to Auntie Mione."
"Couldn't be around the family any more today, I'm ecstatic for Harry but I'm sad for me, I refuse to marry Charlie which is probably the first thing he will try, I could never be happy with him we'd drive the other batty within days. I'm sad because I wont get to have what you have. I will be paired with someone I don't know. I'm still suffering from PTSD, And now I'm expected to get married and have children without even having the minimum of healing. I don't even know if I'll ever be able to have a man touch me let alone sex." Hermione sighed.
"You know I don't think it's wise to ever get on that girls bad side." Harry cocked his head watching her shut them in.
"I couldn't just leave him, he was so weak , and hungry, but look at him now he's so strong and so in tune with his magic I swear he floated his bottle to him the other morning." Harry started proudly smiling down at the boy. Draco laughed softly at a low deep grumble; it was a gruff sound that reminded Harry of Sirius's bark like laughter; it made Harry feel at home and safe.
"I think that is a yes Draco dear, I'll leave it to you to calm him down. It's time for me to feed change and lay little Altair down for his nap." Cissy smiled knowingly she knew her son had always harbored feelings for the Boy-who-lived. Draco glared at his smirking mother, he carefully curled his arms around the waif-like figure of Harry Potter-Black Malfoy, or so he hoped he wanted Harry to use his name.
Marcus was a bit stunned by the sudden hug from Hermione, he was not raised in an affectionate home. But Hermione was very warm and open with her feelings if it was important to her to show her feelings then he would do whatever it took for her to feel comfortable. Hermione sobbed harder when one firm hand lay softly  on her shoulders keeping her to the shoulder she let her guilt out on…..
Hermione pulled herself up to look into the older witches eyes a bit stunned that the other witch would go so far. Hermione shuddered, shaking her head as the soft blue eyes held a softer look than a moment before.
"I Harold Charlus James Potter do swear on my magic that no harm will come to Hermione Jean Granger she is safe among these people. Lumos." Harry vowed then cast a spell the woman relaxed some.
"Wonderful can you tell me what you all remember of your captivity at the Hands of Ron." Sue asked Hermione began to tremble a tear falling from her eye.
"Ron has been arrested sweetie hes never gonna see the light of day not if I have anything to say about it. Will you allow me to cast some magic to help you?" Harry asked waiting until Hermione nodded again.
Hermione smiled at the departing witch Hermione joined her at the door once again finding A large imposing wizard standing at the door. He turned and bowed again allowing the women to step ahead of him.
"I...I... Yes I think so that was just rather shocking is all I did not know Wizards had trial by combat." Hermione's Hands shook, wringing Marcus' handkerchief between them.
"Yes Grimmauld Place here in London it was once the Black Family manse we can both take you. " Harry smiled at Susan.
"You do know Hermione well enough to know she will never stand for anyone asking her to Marry them under this stupid law just to save her from the unknown. She would not stand for us to be unhappy she has already taken off from the room." Percy stated to the rest of the room once the congratulations died down.
"I'll Call Bill and have him come look over your Wards. He's damn good, the best of the best." Arthur offered.
"We should name the boy don't you think?" Harry asked almost a full month after they had been rescued by Draco, He held the baby close, rocking him Draco looked up from the paperwork he had been perusing to look at Harry.
"I don't see why not." Hermione found herself saying it was time to move forward and learn to trust new(ish) people.
"Hermione was not big on feelings before the abuse, I think she had a hard time talking because she had no one to talk to. Draco you should find Marcus and talk to him about his feelings for Mione to see if he's serious about her." Harry smiled at his fiancé.
"I was raised to fix my problems myself. I was raised to be a strong independent woman. I was the one that looked after Ron and Harry especially during the hunt for the soul pieces, But after the three years in Ron's hell and finding my parents had moved on, It was actually quite nice to let someone else step in and care about my problems." Hermione admitted.
"You act honorably for the adopted daughter of my house Mr. Malfoy. You have my gratitude." Arthur said formally. Draco dropped his hand to look at the older wizard who was bowing to him.
"Hermione honey It's Sue Bones from Hogwarts I dosed Ron with Veritaserum earlier and found out he was holding you captive. Can you speak or has he silenced you?" Susan stepped slowly one at a time pausing to gauge her welcome. Hermione shivered more with each step , Susan backed away and turned toward the men.
Andromeda had never been so hurt in all her life she had deluded herself into thinking that Harry being of age just barely wouldn't want to raise a baby, wouldn't want Teddy would shun and turn away from the tot at the first turn. She fled with him after the war not sticking around to see the aftermath of the destruction she had caused. She saw the slight boy face pale and blink owlishly at Cissy before training green eyes to her . Everything her sister said was reflected in those eyes the years of pain in those eyes chilled her to the bone they spoke pages of torment of hate and bile this young boy suffered.
"Ok Harry close your eyes now think back to the first thing you remember, the magic will direct your memories from there we will only see important events that pertain to your mistreatment." Susan said softly tapping her wand to the table a pensive floated down from the ceiling Harry smiled at the object. It floated to a stop and hovered over the table and glowed its silvery sheen. It made a small stream of soft light that connected to Harry's temple.
"Mr. Weasley Is right I need to rescue Hermione after everything she has done for me she has always been on my side she never abandoned me I want to go rescue her.I never thought Ron would hurt her he was in love with her. Please Susan I have to go with you!"Harry babbled in a rush Arthur Weasley was stunned seeing Harry and Draco Malfoy standing together.
"Well then do what you do best I may ask for that brain of yours for research projects I have a few thousand things that could use outside perspective." Kingsley nodded.
"We will do What we can to rebuild both our standings little by little, all we can do is try and keep the other's safe. You were smart seeking help." Marcus smiled.
Thousands are outraged over the news of Harry Potter boy who is living at Malfoy Manor with what remains of the Deatheater's family. The public worries about the safety of their savior! I for one am Appalled to find that the boy who defeated the Dark Lord living in the place where so many were kept captive Potter's friends among them.
"Thank you Marcus, Draco I'm going to go lay down for a while." Hermione smiled softly at both men, handing Marcus his handkerchief and Disappeared up the stairs.
"How very Flattering Marcus, I know this is not exactly conventional. But I had hoped for one moment of my choosing." Hermione sighed.
"No he would not even talk to me in those two weeks after the Battle I assumed he was grieving his brother and did not want to discuss personal matters between us. I thought he was embarrassed by his spontaneity and did not want to formally court me until he dealt with his family's grief." Hermione added.
"And having a Black name doesn't come without a bit of scorn and ridicule, and you mother, do not have a star name you were named after a god." Draco rolled his eyes.
"But I thought that formal pure-blood trials required all current heads of sacred 28 family be present, Macus would be on his family's seat how could he be expected to escort me and Mrs. Malfoy?" Hermione asked, confused. She was further stunned when Marcus spoke up for himself; it was the first she had ever heard him speak up since her second year of Hogwarts.
The missing men entered the little sitting room stunned to see the girl holding the baby Bill took a few steps closer and knelt next to his little sister.
"That is why I asked for your help my friend. If I show a neutral front by keeping both dark and light side family's it will keep us from being a permanent target." Draco pondered.
"Yes the more eyes we have on the Manor the better, you still have many who would like to see the Malfoy family sink." Marcus stated.
"Then that is what we will Do little brother We will protect our Family, I will die before anyone touches one of ours." Marcus promised.
"Yes I acquired the taste you know I spent time in France with my grandparents, Who were very proud of their nationality.
"I don't Know Harry but we will find out everything if you want we'll go to the DMLE tomorrow and start an investigation into it. They will question your Aunt and Uncle And Cousin. Whatever you want, Harry I will Make it happen." Draco curled his arm around Harry's shoulders just holding him safe. That's what Draco would do forever: keep this man safe, would right the wrongs against him and unleash the fury of the Black Family temper on anyone who got in the way. His father had loathed his Black heritage and the traits it gave him.
"Ok boys follow me I'm gonna put you in a room where you can view each and every Weasley being questioned you will get your truth Draco is of course welcome to stay with you if you wish it." Susan gathered the file and tapped the pensive to make a copy of the memories it flew into a glass jar which she croaked and stored in her pocket .
Sue knocked on the Door to Kingsley's office a low 'enter' could be heard from within the office, Sue led them into the warmly decorated office. The Tall Wizard was dressed in royal blue robes, a lovely contrast to his skin, He was seated writing on a parchment He glanced up to see Marcus escorting Hermione into the office. Jumping to his feat Kingsley gave a great big smile at the slight girl entering his office.
"No it is not your fault the man is dead, and that he used me and my family money in such a way. I have closure from Ron's involvement. Ginny and Molly will be tried, that is all the law can do. I'm not angry Draco, I just want to move on." Harry had smiled, turning back to Altair who was rolling around on the floor.
"Then welcome Home Harry." Cissy kissed his forehead softly, rocking the poor broken thing in her arms. She would be as much mother to this boy as she was to her own son Harry needed her, needed them.
"Perseus! My Favorite Big Brother." Hermione cried into his shirt calling him her name for him, Percy cried with her shaking with emotion.
"I decide what may or may not be better for me Hermione, I'm a grown man You are what is best for me." Marcus said setting the box next to him and tilting her head up and this time he kissed her. And tried to pour all the longing and hope into it as he could, wanting to show her how much he needed her, how much he wanted her. Hermione whimpered into the kiss clinging to Marcus in desperation. Tears stung her eyes at his feverish kiss she had never been kissed so completely before nor so tenderly.
"No Draco has my trust and only has my well being in mind." Harry said sure of himself for the first time since walking into the building.
"I too am touched and proud to call you my brother Draco, Just like when we were boy's I will always guard your Weak spot." Marcus smiled back.
"It's a wonder, this is the most sneaky devious underhanded way to push your friend into Marcus' arms. You positive you were not a Slytherin?" Gloria asked half laughing.
"Tennessee Williams, I'm impressed Not many Wizards have read muggle literature. So tell me will you allow me my moment?" Hermione asked.
Draco stepped up next to Harry wrapped an arm around his shoulder gave them his best Lucius Malfoy Glare And growled.
"Yes Harry and I will Floo at once and discuss things with Kingsley." Draco tugged Harry up to his feet and led them to the secondary Floo. Narcissa sighed leaning back thinking what else could go wrong for her little family.
"It's ok out of the Weasley's the only one's who want to hurt me are Molly, Ginny, and Ron. They only ever wanted my money I never wanted to put the rest in the dog house by maintaining contact with them. If I know George he'll keep our visit to himself and maybe give us a bit of a discount." Harry gave a small smile. Draco nodded stepping out leading the way to the bright outlandish storefront Harry smiled fondly up at the store his favorite pranksters had built their dream Harry was so proud to have given them their start up coin. Harry didn't hesitate he almost rushed in pushing Altair inside. The colors were overpowering almost sickeningly so paired with the movement of charmed toys that littered the first floor. Stuffed animals waving roaring or growling per species. Harry laughed at a stuffed snake slithering around hissing angry.
"As much as we would love to come in to have Tea Garrick I'm afraid we are only here to get Harry a new wand." Draco said with a polite tip of his head .
"I never thought I could like another man after what Ron did but yes. He is quiet and sweet. Honestly I would not be put together without his constant reassurance." Hermione sighed.
"Considering the Hat wanted me in Slytherin and I convinced it to put me in Gryffindor. I'd say I'm more of a Slytherin then I let everyone think." Harry grinned and disappeared laughing madly the whole way. Gloria took that as her cue to Floo back to her office shaking her head the whole way intent on billing Lord Malfoy extra headache.
Narcissia grabbed Hermione's elbow and dragged her from the bottom floor of the courtroom, the floor was cleared of the chairs and table they had sat at.
"No actually I quite like knowing that if I turn around he's right there before the war and Ron it definitely would have." Hermione sighed.
"Kings!" Hermione beamed pulling her hand softly from Marcus' arm and stepped tentatively in the Ministers Hug. Blinking back tears she saw a streak of silver fly by her and away. Marcus' Patronus.
"Mione…Mione!" Harry yelled to get her attention. Hermione startled as Harry touched her shoulder she almost screamed. Harry held his hands up showing her his palms.
"Alright fine yes I have feelings for Hermione but she is not ready for a relationship." Marcus crossed his arms over his chest.
"Indeed dear Mother." Hermione replied as they entered the dining Hall. Harry and Draco were sitting around the table smiling and laughing, Teddy Lupin sat in a fancy high chair chewing on a Banana that lay cut up on the tray.
"I loved the twins; they could always make me smile, they frequently would comfort me when Ron would insult me and belittle me. I became quite close to them whenever I needed a good laugh. I would get sandwiched between them literally. I couldn't not go to his funeral." Hermione replied.
"Heavenly I always loved baths." He sighed lathering the soap Draco had given him and dragging it over himself the dirt and grime washing away . He soaked his hair using the bar to get the worst of the dirt and sweat out pulling the drain he stood and let Draco turn the shower on he stood getting all soap off of him. He let Draco turn off the spray and wrap a large fluffy red towel around him and help him out of the bath. Draco helped him out of the bathroom and into the clothing the elf had gotten. Draco had to shrink them a little to fit his much smaller frame but they smelled delightful and were soft on Harry's skin and even after being shrunk were a little big on him nothing like Dudley's hand-me-downs, besides these were Draco's top of the line muggle brand clothing nothing dirty and torn here. Hugging Draco's clothing to him he was content for the first time in a very long time.
"As it was uncovered here in payment of the guilt he carried I strip Ronald Billius Weasley from the Family he will not lay with his ancestors as he brought shame to their name. As instigator of his Action's Molly Abigail Weasley and Ginevra Molly Weasley are forthwith thrown out of the Weasley family as co-conspirators to the crime against Miss Granger. Any charges they face they now face without the backing of my House, I also move that Miss Granger's Testimony today be used in any trial they face in the future to spare the poor Lady from further pain. I Personally apologise for the actions of my former family members, and also offer a boon to Miss Granger should you ever need the Weasley family will stand with you." The elder Man stepped down the steppes and paused in front of Hermione and bowed to her.
'Poor Harry he must be scared to think we would abandon him, I miss my boyfriend something fierce.' Ginny Prewit added to her mother's words.
"Yes I made a choice to give them up before we hunted the bits of Voldemort's soul. I could not tear another family apart the way I tore mine, She was so beautiful. They were all so happy and carefree playing on the beach I could not take that away from Perdita." Hermione smiled sadly.
"I mean the idea does have appeal, I have been going rather nuts over the man's shoulders. I'm still rather afraid of the intimacy portion of Sex Marcus is a gentle man and would give me a memorable experience, But on the other hand the only experience I have is being Raped, and romance novels." Hermione stated blandly as if Gloria's statement had stunned her into answering.
"Ok now one rule you will never be locked in but will you allow room's locked to you until you are well enough ?" Harry asked standing up slowly.
"Glad to see you Awake Hermione, I wish this was a social call instead of a business one. Has Lord Malfoy explained what we wish for the trial." Susan Bones had walked into the sitting room and gave Hermione a soft smile.
He squared his shoulders and stood at his station outside her door while not something he had been outright told to do he did so and after the week it had become a habit one that the girl seemed to appreciate. He would continue to do so until it no longer comforted the witch.
"I see so not only where you aware of the deception and abuse but apart of it?" Susan blinked stunned.
" From what Ginny said Molly pushed her to date me to try and get me to marry her so she could have my money. I didn't want to assume nor push our relationship against the rest of your family mainly your mother. It's was better to never have you make any choice then to be hurt when you chose your family." Harry smiled bitterly wanting nothing more then to step behind Draco and hide but he was a Gryffindor and felt George deserved the truth.
"I don't feel as weak as I was and I'm a little hungry." Harry replied stunned by the display of emotion he had just seen on the tall blonde face.
"Was easy enough to trick her slipped a power restraint on her when she returned I met her under the guise of needing her help with Harry I swear that swot loved him would do anything for him even let her guard down when told he was in danger. To easy to put her somewhere safe stupid Potter didn't even know who bought his god-fathers house from him I made sure of it. " Ron laughed again
Potter’s jaw clenched visibly, and Draco could tell by his tight fists and the rigid set of his shoulders that suppressing his anger was a difficult feat. “And there was nothing else? Nothing at all?”
Also: My current plan is to try to post a new chapter every Sunday, but schoolwork is picking up at the moment, so some may be shorter than others and vice versa!
Suddenly, there was a muffled crash, and Draco whirled around towards the origin of the sound—a door on the far side of the hallway, slightly ajar.
“You know what,” he said, wrapping his arms around the Gryffindor, “I think I’ll go with option two and just continue to stare at you.”
Draco blinked, surprised, gaze snapping back up to Harry’s eyes, which were in turn already boring into his.
, that he would never forget those who could not. Those, who had given up their lives to ensure others might keep theirs.
However, sitting there at the kitchen table, across from his best friend, his wonderful, amazing best friend…well.
Harry nodded uncertainly, not knowing how else to react without running the risk of being torn to pieces by those sharp white teeth of Parkinson’s, both figuratively and not. “Err, thanks. I’ll…think about it.”
. Because he must have noticed Harry’s painful winces when Ron had thrown his arms around him, must have spotted his suppressed little yelps of pain every time he’d tried to sit up.
Draco, however, was straining his neck for any sign of Harry, the pit in his stomach growing bigger and tighter and more agitated by the second. Pansy wouldn’t leave him behind alone, would she? No, there was simply no way. But then why wasn’t he here?
He hurtled across the room, focus on the small pot of green powder sitting on the mantelpiece. But just as he reached out to grab a fistful of the stuff, a jet of purple light zipped by and hit with the wall just above his head.
“Well yes…” But for some reason the thought of Draco, quote unquote, ‘not taking it particularly well’ made Harry’s heart do all sorts of ridiculous, absurd things, made him feel oddly light-headed.
standing in front of Draco’s closed bedroom door like some sort of stalker, wanting to knock but at the same time desperately wishing he could simply turn on his heel and run far, far away, hands all the while fisted at his sides to keep himself from doing anything particularly stupid.
Draco made to let go of Harry’s hand once he’d gotten up again, lips pursed into that familiar look of poorly-suppressed exasperation. But Harry in turn only gripped the Slytherin’s hand tighter, grinning brightly, and said, “Nope. I thought you’d realised by now, Malfoy; you’re not getting rid of me that easily.”
Draco glared through the glass at the gaunt, hollow-looking figure sitting behind the iron desk, arms all the while folded tightly across his chest.
Draco groaned. “I thought you were kidding! You’re not seriously considering having Potter accompany us? A group that consists of exclusively Slytherins? Who he hated all through school?”
The She-Weasel’s brown eyes narrowed, eyes nothing but slits as she took Draco in from head to toe. He could practically see the gears turning in her head, and if his mind weren’t so very preoccupied with other, far more pressing matters, Draco might have found himself concerned.
Something twisted in Harry’s gut, something he neither could nor particularly wanted to place. So instead he said merrily, “Malfoy the Menace and Potter the Pest. Gotta admit, that has a nice ring to it, doesn’t it?” He flipped another pancake, this time throwing it up into the air and catching it again with the spatula, whooping when it landed safely back in the pan.
"You're staying here Harry, sit, don't move, I'll go start you a bath, you need one." He stated firmly then called.
"As that is the last point I hereby close this session of the Wizzengammot." The CW smashed his gavel and people started to exit. Ron's body was cleared away with no ceremony Hermione blinked up at Marcus when he rejoined the stunned witch.
Marcus led Hermione out of the courtroom to the Lift line; they waited their turn and took it straight to the Atrium, leisurely walking to the Apparition point when The voice of Sue Bones called out Hermione's Name. The duo turned to see the slight DLME witch run up to them.
"Hush dear one Marcus has excused himself from the room and will stand at the door and hex whoever tries to disturb us. You are safe, sweet girl no one in this house will ever harm you in that way." Narcissa Malfoy said softly, tenderly bringing a hand down her back.
"No more of this Mrs. Malfoy nonsense, It's Cissy!" The blond Matriarch insisted leveling Hermione with a soft motherly look. Hermione blinked at the woman but nodded softly.
"Maybe one or two for formal occasions but I think he can wear mainly muggle clothing they offer better movement for him. He'll be running around the manor soon enough getting into trouble we want him to learn stealth." Draco gave Harry a smirk reminiscent of the old Draco.
"We need to go to Weasley Wizarding Wheeze they have the best wizard toys, George and Charlie have been making them for a year and they are far superior to anything else on the market." Draco frowned at hurting Harry.
"Susan we have to get her out poor girl we need to find Harry only he can override any wards Ron has placed with just a drop of blood I should have done more for the boy he's been gone for so long." Arthur rubbed his face with a long fingers hand .
Draco gave Harry a soft smile not replying his eye's, Darkening to a deep storm cloud Grey, Draco's thoughts drifted away from Harry who watched on wanting to do something for the man who saved him who gave him a home and a reason to want to keep living.
“Yeah, don’t you want kids Parkinson?” asked Ron, which only made Parkinson laugh harder. Although I must concede his question was pretty amusing, the way he phrased his question made it seem as though the only reason one would ever be interested in a man was to get kids. When Parkinson was done laughing, she wore a determined expression and looked Ron dead in the eye before saying:
“No guy is ever gonna meet my standards Granger,” She replied, winking at Hermione. Ron and I exchanged confused glances, unsure what she meant.
As the days passed, the tension between Ron and Hermione eased, until it felt like we were back to normal, whatever that meant. My definition of normal had changed over the years. I used to think it meant being constantly at risk of being killed by the darkest - and baldest - wizard of all times. When I told this to Ron, he laughed and said we’d had the least normal childhood ever.
“Say something for Merlin's sake!” she finally snapped, throwing her hands up in exasperation. I offered her a small nod and my best smile. I desperately wanted to take her hand, possibly kiss her, anything to forget the words she had just spoken. Instead, I kept my eyes firmly on hers, not ever wanting to let her pretty face leave me.
“You okay?” I whispered to her, for not only was she late for class but had also forgotten her textbook, something Hermione never did.
“Draco convinced me to join him, he claimed that if I wasn’t there to stop him, he might end up setting the castle on fire,” she shakes her head, “Bold of him to assume I wouldn’t be the one casting the incendio.”
“Ginny,” I said, unable to hide the relief that filled my voice. She offered me a timid smile, one that looked strange on her usually confident face. Not that she was not still the most gorgeous girl in the school or anything, it’s just being timid wasn’t her style. Which led me to wonder if something was wrong, she never knocked either, heck, it was quite the opposite. She usually barged in as though this was her dorm, which in a way, it had become. Her face was still paler than normal, and even her lips had lost their rosy colour. She too was still fighting battles in her head. The war had left a toll on everyone.
“Ah.” I said eloquently, “Sorry.” To my surprise, she smiled, explaining she had been the one to end things between them. The end of the war had made her realize she’d rather maintain a platonic relationship than a romantic one. I tried not to focus on how similar her reasoning had been to Ginny’s.
“I guess MoldyWart is a pretty good name,” conceded Ron after realizing Hermione was still shooting him dirty looks. Parkinson smiled smugly, but made no further comment.
“I mean, that was ages ago! In any case, our relationship has and will always be strictly platonic.” Parkinson said, now giggling slightly. She leaned back into the sofa and put a hand around Hermione, who looked suddenly uneasy.
As if struck by lightning, Harry jumped up and ran to the kitchen as fast as he could. Shortly before the entrance he came to a halt, slithering. His heart was beating wildly with hope of seeing the man who had stolen his heart again.
Draco didn't even notice he was crying until a gentle hand wiped a tear from his cheek. He looked up and saw Luna kneeling before him with a sad, dreamy look.
on it– grew hot and burned into his finger. Mortified, Draco stared at it, remembering what a heated ring meant. Harry was in severe danger.
Sighing, Harry clapped Neville’s shoulder. “I’m really honored to be best man, Neville. I wouldn’t give that up for the world.” Neville gave Harry a tentative smile.
“The flyer says, there is a honeymoon phase. It lasts approximately two weeks in which you have to be in constant proximity of each other, so you can get used to the bond. After that you’re okay with being apart for most of the time but have to have physical contact at least two times a week. If not, the bond becomes unstable and you will feel in pain until you touch your partner again.”
As soon as the blond prince had set up his stall, the first interested people arrived. Two handsome young men in rich clothing approached the booth. However, they seemed to be more interested in Draco than in the pots. Despite shabby beggar clothes, the beauty of the prince was undisputed and attracted the attention of the people passing by.
Though at times surprisingly romantic Draco wasn’t one for much softness. “Move, Potter, I’m not a fucking princess” he demanded and tried to spur me on with his feet pushing into my lower back.
His husband seemed to be well-built. He would make a good worker, so that he could certainly make ends meet for both of them.
Instead of slowing down his pace, the man replied, "You have to earn your bread today. Soon we will be in Thrushbeards town where you will dance and sing."
But then he thought of green eyes and the beggar's scarred face flashed in his mind. He thought of the clay that formed under his fingers according to his wishes, of the beggar's laughter when he ate Draco's food, of late night conversations and light kisses. No, Draco did not want to leave. He had found his home in the small shabby hut.
Harry laid his forehead against Draco’s. He looked intently at the man he loved and asked, "How was the kiss? How was my chin? Did it not sting you?"
He rolled around in bed and noticed the unfamiliar, rough material surrounding him. His whole body was stiff and aching. Slowly he opened his eyes and looked around. Blinking, he asked, "Where am I?"
„Not again, Harry!“, Ron exclaimed. „You’re way too obsessed with the ferret, mate. If I didn’t know better, I would say you have a crush on him“, he added shaking his red head.
Potter looked like he wanted to argue but was elbowed by his colleague. “After this we’re off duty. Mind if we join the party?”
The chef and mother of the knights squad supreme captain Molly Weasly only needed a quick glance at the blond youth to give him a comforting hug. In her opinion, the young man was much too slim and looked so forlorn that it broke her heart.
Dracos smile widened. “So, care to join me on going on the most thrilling adventure? I have to go apologize to a very good friend of mine for not marrying them. And this friend just happens to be very skilled at hexing the hell out of people who’ve angered her. I’m in dire need of a human shield and you seem just the right person for the job.”
"Don't think I'll forgive all that dressing up and tricking so easily, Thrushbeard. It's a good thing you've got the rest of our lives to make it up to me now." Draco teased with a smug grin.
Harry seemed slightly disappointed. “Well, you can’t have all my firsts.” Draco teased and they entered the cinema.
I took Malfoy to Dumbledore and we crafted a plan to safe him from his Death Eater fate. Next summer he would come living with me in Grimmauld Place. He was my responsibility now. I couldn’t leave him hanging. But even if I could, I wouldn’t walk away. Because what I realized the last few weeks was that my heart twisted everytime I saw the blonde Slytherin.
“No, I’m still used to house elves” Draco admitted sheepishly. “I wanted to learn, but there wasn’t much time during Healer training.”
“Thank you, Hermione” Luna clapped enthusiastically. “Now, let’s practice. Harry, how about you start with Draco? Say something provocative at first and then rephrase it in non-violent terms. Remember to express your feelings and formulate your needs at the end.”
The blond buried his face in his husband's neck and replied "Of course I love you". Then he muttered "Stupid Potter".
Draco sulked. "If the Thrushbeard had taken me, I wouldn't have had to bother running around aimlessly."
“I know. I’m not sorry though, you’re really sexy when you’re mad at me.” I growled back, relishing in the blush that tainted Dracos cheek red.
“Come in!” I called, my voice only a few octaves higher than usual. The door creaked open, revealing the face of a girl with fiery red hair.
“Hey yourself,” she said, walking towards my bed before I could reach her. “ I need to talk to you.” Taking a seat beside her, I couldn’t help but notice the way her hands were toying with the dozen wristbands she wore, something she usually did when nervous. She let herself flop onto the bed and sigh loudly, I decided it was best to stay silent, Ginny didn’t appreciate being prompted too much.
“I’d have to be dead to allow Slytherin a chance at the cup.” With that she stood up and left the room, leaving me alone on my bed, filled with thoughts I had no desire to have.
“How about MoldyWart?” a voice behind us offers. I turn around, surprised to see a dark haired Slytherin approaching us.
The next chapter should be up this week unless the corona virus suddenly disappears or my mental health shuts!
Hermione assured me over and over again that it had never been my fault Ginny was not doing well. She said I was not to blame for Ginny’s mental health and I should stop worrying about it. Ginny was doing better because she was learning to heal the wounds the war had caused her, not because she was no longer with me. In the end, I allowed Hermione’s words to wash over me, letting myself believe it really wasn’t my fault, that I hadn’t been an awful boyfriend.
It was late at night when Pansy finally returned to her dorm, and to my suprise, I was quite disappointed when she did leave. Although she remained obnoxious, she was pretty funny, and her snarky comments addressed at Ron quickly became quite entertaining. I even found myself looking forward to her next visit - since Hermione had made Pansy promise to return. Maybe she’d even bring Malfoy along.
“At least my date didn’t believe in nargles,” She said laughing. I shot them both dark looks, but ended up laughing along with them. Parkinson too was laughing, it felt slightly odd.
“I for one, know that the third years are never going to be saying his real name out loud.” Ron said, with a spark in his eye.
Parkinson shoots Ron another glare before taking a seat. She crosses her legs, without taking notice of how high her skirt travels up her thigh, or the fact that the couch she sat on is meant for one person only, meaning she is almost seated on top of Hermione, who scoots over to the best of her abilities before warmly greeting the Slytherin girl, who in return offers her a smile before turning back to Ron, who is still glaring at her.
“Well I’m certainly not here for you,” snaps Parkinson, “or for the decoration, red and mustard looks awful together,” she adds in disgust.
“Ron said if I ever got back with Micheal Corner, he would personally make sure to send him flowers, once Ron sent him to the hospital wing.”
I stared at her, staying silent. I had noticed her growing more and more distant, often making excuses to avoid being alone with me avoiding any intimate contact, I couldn’t even remember the last time she was the one to initiate a kiss.
Right then, Draco almost wanted to hug the pea-brained git. He reached out for Harry’s hand and grinned even wider, if such a thing was even possible at this point. “Sure are.”
“I should tell you something,” said Draco finally, voice impossibly gentle yet tense at the same time, and Harry couldn’t help but squeeze his hand tighter. Draco squeezed back without hesitation, but then continued, “I probably should have told you this a long time ago. I suppose I was just too afraid. Scared how you might react. To be perfectly honest, I’m still scared how you might react. But after almost losing you today, I’ve realised…well, I
Draco didn’t stop grumbling, but let himself be pulled along, nonetheless. “And they say us Slytherins are the conniving ones.”
Harry shook his head, at which not only Seamus, but almost everyone at the table visibly deflated. Everyone except Luna, that is, who said cheerily, “Unpredictable, soulmarks are. Some of them like creating suspense, you can’t fault them for it.”
“Oh no,” he breathed in nothing more than a whisper. Both in an effort to keep his voice from trembling, and because the words—and the horrible theory that accompanied them—scared Draco more than any deranged Death Eater or his ruthlessly murderous accomplice ever could.
Harry blinked, and just like that, he was torn from his momentary daze, sobered by the flash of worry in the Slytherin’s grey eyes. He shook his head and said hastily, “What, no! No, nothing like that, everything’s fine. I was just…well…uhm…”
Harry could only stare. “I…of course, I know that, it’s just…that…but you…” He quickly gave up on words, instead simply making a helpless, entirely involuntary sound that had him cringing.
Draco snorted. “You really are lucky you’re so easy on the eyes. Because, let me tell you, love, you’re about as observant as a blind flobberworm.”
Apparently oblivious to the tension between the two Aurors and Draco, Potter said happily, “Guess what, Malfoy, Jennings here is a potions-genius, too! He spent two years apprenticing under some big-name potions Master in Germany before coming back here to become an Auror. To be honest, Malfoy, I always thought you might do that; become a potions Master, you know, like Snape. All grumpy and mysterious and anti-Gryffindor.” He chuckled. “You were certainly good enough for it.”
And suddenly Harry found his mind circling back to the same topic he’d pondered the day before yesterday, after their first kiss, when he was lying in bed and rejoicing in the knowledge that
“What the—” exclaimed Harry as he was forcefully removed from the table. He tried to yank his arm free, but to no avail. “What the hell do you think you’re doing, you bloody psychopath?!”
Instantly, both Healers started speaking again, but Harry held up a silencing hand. He still didn’t care whether or not he was being rude; they’d just insinuated Draco had done this to him—whatever the fuck
Draco gave a huff halfway between a chuckle and a breath of evident relief, and Harry was glad to see the blond’s shoulders lose some of their tension. “The emphasis, Weasley, being
It came out a lot louder and more enthusiastic than Harry’d planned, and he winced as Draco’s eyes widened ever so slightly in surprise.
He braced himself for another curse, but when a few seconds passed and none came, his gaze slowly lifted to that of his attacker.
. And, as he so often had in the past and would likely continue to do until the day he died, Draco could make an exception for the Boy Who Lived. Could, and would, if only to see that blindingly bright smile a few moments longer.
He wasn’t entirely sure what he’d expected to happen, to be honest. Harry truly did believe Malfoy had changed—after all, the war had changed them all—and although he was certainly still an arrogant, contemptuous little arsehole, it wasn’t like Harry expected to be murdered in his sleep. Err, not by Malfoy, that is.
“Honestly,” Weasley continued, sounding utterly exhausted, as though Harry and Draco had singlehandedly taken ten years off his life, “I guess I sort of did. I’m not sure why I’m even surprised right now, you were both extremely obvious about it. Bloody
The woman’s spindly fingers curled tightly around her jar of spiders as she hissed, “You went and betrayed not only the Dark Lord, but your family name and all it represents, boy, and yet you have the gall to come here and lecture
But then a single tear rolled down the side of Draco’s face, and he smiled at Harry and breathed, “I love you, too. Merlin, Harry, I love you so much, you have no idea.”
Instantly, his eyes widened as he looked down to find his feet suddenly kicking and flailing about in what Harry liked to think of as the best performance of a Dancing Feet Spell since…well,
And, just like that, Draco stiffened in his seat, any lingering amusement forgotten. A familiar cold calm settled over his features as he schooled them into perfect inscrutability. “I thought we agreed not to stick our noses in each other’s business, Potter. My soulmark does not concern you. Leave it be.”
However, much to Draco’s approval, Harry completely ignored his friend. Instead, he kissed back, not caring that his two best friends were watching, and it generated such an intense rush of joy within Draco that he threw caution to the wind and deepened the kiss.
Draco didn’t deserve Harry. No one did, no one and nothing, not him, not the Wizarding World, not the cruel, harsh reality they’d been thrust into without a bloody choice in the matter.
His head snapped back up and he fixed the Slytherin with his best replica of Hermione’s most scathing glower. “You absolute prick, Malfoy. You are
The next few moments happened in slow motion, as though the world had come to an abrupt stop, paused, and then started turning again, slowly at first, but then quicker, and quicker, and quicker, until everything was spinning, until the dark cell walls blended into one shade of black and Yaxley’s pallid, frail form was all Draco could make out in the haze.
“You’re not,” he said forcefully, embarrassment forgotten, and Draco blinked, startled by the sudden severity of Harry’s tone. “You’re not cold-hearted, and you’re not corrupt, and you’re certainly no Death-Eater, so don’t you even joke about that.”
After a few moments, Malfoy gave a terse nod, and the silence resumed as they walked, the beat of their dragon-hide boots and trainers respectively on the cobblestone below the only sound. Until, that is, Malfoy said, “My mother wanted me to see a…a Mind Healer, too. She could’ve used it herself just as badly, if not more so. But I…refused. Didn’t think it would help. After all, what good is talking about my past mistakes when nothing I say could ever possibly change them?”
“Avada Kedavra!” the man bellowed, and Draco only barely ducked the flash of green, dropping onto the cobbled stone just in time as the curse shattered another shop window behind him. Scowling, he scrambled to his feet as fast as he could and pointed his wand at the man.
Harry felt it should be said that Draco, although evidently still shocked, recovered remarkably fast, as though Slytherins falling out of your chimney out of the blue was a completely normal thing. “Don’t be ridiculous,” he drawled, and his tone reminded Harry so much of Hogwarts-Draco he had to do a double-take—only to find the blond grinning from ear to ear. “I would look perfect even if I were as big as a house. Besides, my dear—fast metabolism.”
“Look," Harry said quietly, "I’m sorry I brought up the trials. I…know that was hard for you. It’s just… I really wish I could do something for once and not have to worry about what the whole world thought of it. Ever since I left the Dursleys, it’s been this way, and, well, I know it’s a bit naïve, but I always thought once I’d fulfilled the prophecy and killed Voldemort, things would get…easier.”
Ron was wearing his scarlet Auror robes, which, as Ginny had always loved to point out (before she started avoiding Harry like the plague, of course) clashed horribly with his hair, while Hermione’s hair on the other hand looked even frizzier than normal, as though she’d only just rolled out of bed. Which, Harry thought as he took in his friends’ bleary-eyed faces, actually seemed entirely possible.
Draco still couldn’t quite wrap his mind around all that had happened. But there was exactly one thing he knew for certain: Harry Potter was calling Draco by his first name, and, moreover,
. But it was still frustrating to know his two best friends simply thought he was overreacting when tomorrow could very well change his life.
A shudder ran down Draco’s spine as his gaze took in the dark shop windows, overflowing with everything from vials in all shapes and colours to what seemed to be an actual jar of eyeballs. But it was all covered in a thick layer of dust, so much of it Draco could see it even from where he stood outside. The sight was harrowing, if only due to the fact that it looked as though absolutely nothing had changed in the many years since Draco’s first visit as a fearful First Year. That day, Lucius had said nothing more than that they’d be making a quick detour, and Draco had better not embarrass him in front of Mrs. Craigs. And then he’d dragged his eleven-year-old son into a store even most adults would be too afraid to enter.
He said it as though it was the most obvious thing in the world, all the while frowning at Draco with something similar to distrust, but less hostile and more…curious.
. Not smiling in his vague direction, nor because there were Gryffindors nearby that might elicit one of those rare moments of vulnerability from the Boy Who Lived. No—these, they were smiles meant for Draco and Draco alone, smiles he had earned, smiles he deserved.
Needless to say, Jennings noticed. His frown deepened, and he said, “You okay, mate? You’re looking awfully pale.” The man paused. “Err, paler than usual, that is.”
the man, and both those objectives seemed incredibly unmanageable with the pain numbing his brain and the Nic currently looming overhead.
Everyone wanted to know who the soulmate of The Boy Who Lived Twice was. Everyone, that is, except Draco.
!” The sheer exasperation in Draco’s tone and the huff he made promptly thereafter were enough to catch Harry completely off balance. “You don’t think it’s in the least bit odd he sent those ‘apology’ letters not to me, but to you? Or that he wouldn’t have thought to apologize to me in the first place if you hadn’t directly told him to? Or, I don’t know, the fact he was practically
The Slytherin smiled again. And then he extricated his right hand from Harry’s grip, pulling back the sleeve of his (previously) white dress shirt. He looked up into Harry’s eyes again and, without ever breaking eye contact, undid the leather band he always wore fastened around his soulmark, letting it drop onto the mattress.
But when he did, there was neither anger, nor disgust on her face, and instead a smug sort of amusement that mentally shocked him into next week.
.” Harry didn’t know why his heart was beating so fast right now, why his lungs felt so constricted, why his heart suddenly hurt so very much, like it was being squeezed to death by a pair of invisible hands. “We have each other now, right? You and me. So what does it matter what happened in the past?”
Whatever it was, though, it didn’t last very long, for at that particular moment a bolt of such intense pain thundered through his stomach that he had to double over, teeth gritted so hard it hurt, in an attempt to stifle a pained little whimper, the likes of which Draco refused to let two Weasleys and his concerned best friend/Trainee Healer hear from his lips.
However, the Gryffindor didn’t rise to the bait, and Draco was left feeling both mildly disappointed and…unnerved. Yes, definitely unnerved.
Yes, Harry was definitely blushing now, there was no doubt about it. The Gryffindor nodded. “Sounds good.”
Nic, it seemed, must have called upfront and reserved a table for them at the back of the restaurant, which was less packed than the rest of it. Plus, the view was amazing; one wall was completely made of glass, so that you could enjoy a perfect view of the city below as you ate, of the lights and buildings and cars and people, of the hustle and bustle that never ended, not even when the sun set and the moon and stars lit up the night sky instead.
Harry chuckled. “Oh, come now, they’re no sillier than Ravenclaw, Gryffindor, Slytherin and Hufflepuff. I mean,
So, Harry hadn’t spent much time considering how Malfoy must feel about this whole situation, but now that he actually thought about it, he couldn’t imagine the blond was delighted either. Did he still hate Harry as he had in school? Harry had long since stopped hating the Slytherin, and although their relationship still wasn’t near friendly, he’d always made it a point to greet Malfoy whenever they passed each other back at the office.
At his right, Harry could feel Hermione’s piercing gaze on him as well, and he turned to her with the same smile he’d very pointedly offered Ron a few moments earlier. “Yes?”
what you’re so concerned about? Merlin and Morgana, all this foreboding, and it turns out all you care about is doing your job. For a second there I thought you genuinely cared.”
“Come out, my dear boy,” Yaxley crooned again, and Draco could hear his footsteps on the wooden floor. Draco inhaled deep.
And it wasn’t Blaise’s fault Draco was feeling so restless, he knew that, rationally speaking, but that didn’t stop him from snapping, “Thank you for that truly ground-breaking piece of advice, Blaise. I’ll make sure to remember to
The latter could do nothing but stare up at the familiar hard features he’d never thought he’d have to face again, features that wrenched his thoughts deep, deep, deep under into memories Draco had long since buried and written off as past and forgotten. His mind reeled in a desperate attempt to stop panicking and
Draco didn’t answer for a long, long moment. His eyes simply roamed across Harry’s face, taking in every detail with an intensity, a hunger, as though he were seeing him for the very last time and therefore wanted to commit every line, every curve, every patch of skin to memory.
The Slytherin seemed to have come to the same realisation, for his grey eyes briefly widened. And although Draco was quick to settle them back into that familiar Malfoy-sneer, folding his arms tightly across his chest in a half-hearted attempt to hide either the chocolate stains, or the pink apron, or perhaps even both, Harry could have sworn his usually so pallid skin had reddened a shade or two.
He knew he ought to feel something at the sight of Yaxley’s broken, limp body, be that triumph or hatred or anger or sadness, however unlikely that last one was. After all, all the man had ever brought Draco was death and misfortune. Had Yaxley’s plan succeeded, Draco would currently be without a soulmate.
But this, it seemed, was not the right thing to say. Immediately, a scowl overtook Ron’s face. “Don’t give me that bullshit, Harry! You know that’s not what I meant, so don’t even try to downplay you almost dying—
. St. Mungo’s was no place for temper tantrums. “If they want to leave, they can go. But if they want to stay, that’s fine, too.”
But his throat felt constricted, and he croaked out, “Isn’t it too late for that? Hayes asked him out on a date, you should know. And he accepted.”
And it was good that he did, for when he slowly made his way around the desk and peeked behind, it was the sight of Robards’ limp, motionless body that awaited him there.
The words stung. Merlin’s beard, they stung. Not because they were another hateful, discriminatory lie deliberately phrased to hurt him, not because it was another ‘evil Death Eater’ prejudice, the sort that had hounded him since the moment Voldemort fell, regardless of whether or not he’d changed sides.
Pansy—who, in contrast to Draco, looked completely unperturbed by the question—snorted again. “Salazar, if that was your game, you should have said so earlier.” And then she did what Draco so ardently wished he could do, and confidently and without hesitation pushed up the sleeve of her dress and grinned victoriously as she held out her wrist for everyone to see.
Either Harry had just blacked out à-la-Tom-Riddle’s-diary and missed some important turning point in their conversation that’d make sense of all this, he figured, or Draco had in the last thirty seconds gone completely mental.
Draco, who, Harry realized belatedly, not only stood just the slightest bit too close, but was also still wrapped in a pale pink apron covered in chocolate stains.
Even through his fog of dislike, Draco dimly appreciated the She-Weasel’s cunning. Seems he’d underestimated her in that regard—it would be the first and the last time.
Nothing could have prepared Harry when the raven-haired head of one Pansy Parkinson came tumbling out of his fireplace, features warped in indignation as she dusted off her skin-tight, very short ruby dress, adjusting her black leather jacket and kicking the dust off her matching pair of platform boots.
“Yes, you do. You’re going to shut up now,” the blond repeated, “and you’re going to let me finish, alright? Trust me, you’ll want to hear this.”
“Shit, I’m sorry,” breathed Ron, drawing back so fast one would have thought Harry’s injuries were contagious. “You must be in pain. Harry, I’m…I’m so sorry. Really. We never should have gone to Diagon, and I never should have left you alone. I should have paid more attention, I should have—”
“No, Malfoy, it’s not different at all,” the Gryffindor said heatedly. “I’m allowed to react like this. In fact,
And what a spectacular show it was turning out to be. Draco had to bite down on his tongue and clamp his jaw shut to keep from crying out as the invisible flames spread from where Yaxley had cut him up his arm and into his chest, making it harder and harder to breathe by the second. He mentally started going through all the poisons he knew had similar effects, only his brain couldn’t quite seem to work.
“Oh God, I’m so sorry about the other day,” he said. “I owe you an apology, Nic. Because, well, you see…Draco and I…me and Draco…the two of us—”
When he saw Draco’s sour expression, Blaise’s smile morphed into a truly shit-eating grin. “Disappointed much? I know you’d rather I were someone else, say, someone with a lightning scar and horrendously ugly glasses—but must you be so obvious about it? It’s wounding, really. I save your life, and this is the thanks I get. Consider me wounded.”
But Pansy was as much a Slytherin as he was, and, after years and years of friendship, had become irritatingly immune to Draco’s remarks, so she simply rolled her long-lashed eyes. “I’m serious, Draco. I know Potter’s the most oblivious being in this world and the next, but you can’t bank on that forever. Sooner or later, he’s going to notice something, or, worse still, someone else might.” Her smirk twisted higher. “
“Harry, please. I’ll make it quick, I promise. I just—” Her voice broke, and Harry could feel a sudden burst of worry wash over him. “I just need to talk to you.”
He nodded and turned to the waitress as well. “I’ll have a Butterbeer, too, please. Extra cream, and with that delicious caramel drizzle on top if you have it.”
Thankfully, Draco nodded, giving a small, if strained, smile of his own. “Fine. But, in my defence, you seemed to be doing perfectly well by yourself. Not that I’m surprised; brute force is all you Gryffindors are good for. That, and reckless shenanigans like
He must have been alerted by Ginny’s shouting. Usually Harry would be grateful for his soulmate’s presence, if only as emotional backup, but all it took was one glance in between the Slytherin and the youngest Weasley and he knew proverbial shit was about to hit the fan. Ginny had never thought very highly of Draco, Harry knew that, and the latter barely ever concealed the particularly strong dislike he in turn harboured for her.
