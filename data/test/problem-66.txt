"Draco, what the hell." Where was her face?
By now, her wand looked like twisted plaits of hair hardened into a crooked stick. It splintered where raised, matted fibers clumped and stuck out of it. Otherwise, it looked like she’d dipped it into black lacquer and it gleamed faintly to his investigative eyes. Her magic was definitely unique, taking forms that were more interesting than aesthetically appealing.
Draco held his daughter, who smelled of a fresh bath, powder, and pancake syrup from the cake-like pinches that she tried to feed him with her fingers. “Eat-eat,” she told him.
“What! The fuck! Was that!”
It was no secret that he and Draco chose to live in non-magical neighborhoods. They had to look the part without arousing suspicion. And he had to remain in contact with Draco at all times. All he had to do was lift the face of the watch and see hexagonal-shaped cells behind it. The cells were part of a thin disc of luminescence. So far, the colors were programmed magically, to show six colors with different meanings: Green = We're safe. Yellow = Stay away. Red = Help/We're in trouble. Orange = Hide/ You're in trouble. Black = Unavailable/Sleep. Blue = We need to talk. White = All is well.
Lucius didn’t feel that he was being understood. He leaned forward.
She grabbed his arm. “Walk with me. He’s upstairs, I’ll tell you everything in order. Everything we know.”
The first stop on the Ministry Tour is Dungarvin. Harry has opted to ride the train instead of apperating. It gives him time to acclimate to the mindset of meeting new people. It gives him time to think about Draco's last minute kiss. The whole morning had been calm, with Iece eating her oatmeal and laughing at the muggle images of fairies on a cartoon channel. She sat at the table between them. When it was time to say good-bye, Harry handed her to Draco, who promptly took her to the playpen in her nursery and closed the door on her. He slumped against it, like he'd been waiting to do that all morning.
“Be as rude to me as you dare. I can take it. I know you’re scared. But don’t get rid of Harry’s baby just because life is about to get incredibly complicated over the next few months. Maybe even longer. Believe me, you’ve lived through the worst. A child is nothing to scare you off. I came here to beg you. I know you’re planning to get rid of it, or you would’ve told him already. If I admit to you that I know, then you can’t get rid of it as if it were never there. As long as you know, that I know, you won’t make any rash decisions. If I pretended not to know, you’d do something stupid and think you’ve gotten away with it. You may hate me now, but I’ve just saved you a lifetime of regret.”
In the photo, Eileen held Severus’s tiny arm back, to keep him from grabbing her tambour frame. She was breathing hard, strained. Her arm thrust the hoop out for him to notice. She shook it, demanding that he see it and nothing else. Harry was forced to squint to read what she had stitched upon it. In long dark threads, it read:
He didn’t know how to add, “But I’m not backing down, and I’m not giving you up, now that it’s come to this,” without sounding tyrannical and deserving of Draco’s scorn.
“That’s for them.”
He felt his heart and his life circling the drain. This had to be a spell. They were all against him and Prince Draco Malfoy, had to be their cruelest card. The prince looked like his his genetics were designed to provoke and ensure procreation at all costs. One could not help but find him attractive. The look he returned to Harry said that, not only did he know this, but he was utterly bored with people coming onto him all his life. That’s why no one was allowed to get too close. That’s why, in the Wizarding world, these royals did not flaunt their true status and were now using their well-kept secret of a son to secure the most potent line of magic still walking the Earth. They’d possibly bred him for exactly that purpose. He was here to honor his “family business” as much as Harry was. Duty over romance. That was the drill.
If she could see his thoughts, even the ones he wasn’t consciously thinking, then maybe he could see hers. Would she block him if he tried?
When no one had an answer, Hermione spelled it out for them. “She doesn’t. It’s very clever, really, unless of course you inadvertently teach her to associate shocks with ice – you know what I mean. Under normal circumstances, she could get an unsuspecting person to take their hands off of her. I think, with a little more training, you could get her to shock anyone who isn’t familiar and safe to her. Perhaps that’s what your elf was going for.”
He told Emerald, “Here come the demons. Don’t let them scare you, they’re nothing.”
This time, the throat aperture spit out an aborted green yolk instead of a bubble. And they heard Morell’s voice anyway, in the air around them.
“Stop chasing him, Draco. If he wants to be with you, he’ll come to you. If not, you can let him go. He doesn’t need you the way you think he does. You tried. The contract knows you tried.”
Her distrust was incredulous. “Like what?”
"Fine." It wasn't, but he wasn't about to risk his place on the team by arguing with her. On the ride over, he reminded himself that all he had to do was keep his head down, cooperate with the team, and stay out of trouble. Negative press was bad enough, he didn't need to have to defend himself to teammates who were committed to a cause that was getting families out of shelters and into real homes. He would not be accused of letting his fame eclipse his purpose. Celebrity Quidditch was supposed to be a fun way to raise money and to rebuild burned cultural bridges. He wasn't going to let any darkness in his life poison that intent.
***SPOILER***
"I don't know, look at her. When it's quiet and she's the only one you have to talk to, you just look at her and think cold, remote magic. She's going to be a total fucking princess, Harry. And not the kind that waits for rescuing in a tower. I'm sorry, but my father's magic is all over her. The best we can do is guide it. We'll make sure she's not the monster he is. But it's magic most people wouldn't be comfortable with. She makes me feel like, if magic were a thermostat, her setting has to be at a level that renders lesser magic dysfunctional. She'll thrive where others will be severely uncomfortable."
“I hit a woman. I freaked out in front of so many muggles…”
Shadows rose close to his dome of air, like giant faces peering in, but revealing no features. This went on for so long, he wondered if he was really existing in a jar, captured by Foster and toyed with until his terror was supposed to drive him mad. But he knew as he thought it, that wasn’t Foster’s style. Whatever this was, he was here for a reason.
I felt the need to give Harry a substantial family, after all the universes where he’s always the pitiful orphan. This is not meant to resemble canon even a little bit.
"I don't trust anyone in my family to take her. My father would only trick them out of custody. And even if I could convince Harry's family to take her, I'm reminded that they raised him in a cupboard, and would be even easier targets as muggles, for my father to slip away with her."
What scared Harry the most, wasn’t her hair. It was her eyes. His baby had only ever shown him luminous dark irises. Now she grinned up at him. Her eyes were grey. Silver-grey, like her true father’s.
. Harry couldn’t even look at the wizard pinning him with those glacier, soulless eyes without smelling his own blood from that night.
He felt her enter behind him, and gasped at her audacity.
They could both remember a time when that conversation would’ve turned their stomachs. But experience had forced maturity upon them. When you have no other options, you deal with it, and it becomes your path. Most young men cringe at the thought of graphic childbirth, but change their minds when their own offspring are about to be born. Ironically, the same qualities that make something a miracle, are exactly the same qualities that people have trouble allowing in their normal observation. They’ve had over two years to let disgust move on to something else. Frankly, there was too much else to worry about than bodies that accommodated their every sexual whim.
When he regained enough control to pull out of it, he turned his head and pushed a fist’s length between them. “We can’t do this. This is fake, this is nothing.”
He waited. What he heard was almost a whisper.
Draco choked on all the air that couldn’t exit his lungs fast enough. He’d held his breath, not realizing the pain collecting there. When he needed to breathe, he couldn’t. The sounds that came from his throat, terrified Lucius, who jumped up to lift him from the pillow. He pulled him forward and smacked him on his back.
“You will not touch my son.”
“Um, no. She’s sitting there staring me down. Cute baby.”
A final, resolute breath, and he dropped his hands. “What now?”
He leaned forward. “Ask me anything. You’re my motivation.”
He turned to his father and said in his lowest, most respectful tone, “Dad, you’re making my husband cry.”
“I don’t believe you.”
“That doesn’t make any sense.”
“Are you telling me, that Harry is legally and magically recognized by this estate as a legitimate member of this family?”
“I’ve come to get answers.” There was no point in making threats and wasting time. If he’d had more time, Morell might’ve been right.
In the back of his mind, he remembered the Admiral had mentioned keeping a watch on him, but would make every attempt to respect his privacy. He also knew that was bullshit. Whether the jeep was being tracked or not, privacy was no longer an option. If they questioned his desire to find more wreckage, he'd tell them the truth. Plenty of people already knew that his body was put where it was found. He wanted the truth just as much as everyone else did. He never had to mention anything else about his suspicions.
Lucius glared at James. “What the hell was that?”
Worrisome guilt knitted Draco’s brow, but he held firm. “You’re never to do that without asking us first.”
He wouldn’t be expected to hold back. He’d scream, ‘Fuck you! Get off!’ But he wouldn’t mean it. He wouldn’t have to mean it. Finally, he could let go. Every scream he’d ever suppressed, was allowed to come out then. And oh, there’d be hands that weren’t his, giving him so much squeezing slippage and lip-biting, toying strokes, that he couldn’t be held accountable for what he left on those tiles.
‘Hey look’, Ash wanted to say, ‘We’re talking like real people for a change. I’ll risk it.’
It was the furthest he had ever gotten in negotiations for a suitor. It wasn’t supposed to go this far. Harry was supposed to be disgusted by a husband who didn’t want him. A husband loyal to someone else, whose body might already be compromised. Then there were other secrets Draco wasn’t keen on his tests revealing. It would be easier to let Harry date him for eight weeks, than to tell his father that he wasn’t a virgin. He had already compromised the Malfoy name. No off spring had come of it, but that was by effort, not by chance. Now here this idiot was, practically blackmailing him to gain the right to court him. Harry was definitely smarter than Draco had given him credit for. He wanted to play hardball? That’s fine. Draco had eight weeks to figure out how to get rid of him. In the meantime, he’d try to behave himself and let Harry think he was running things.
“Are you sick?”
He'd gotten a private car for a reason. He didn't want to think of himself as a pervert, but Dr. Rankar's instructions had so far gone unfollowed. Every time the thought occurred to him, do it quick, do it now, he dismissed it as being ridiculous. But he knew it wasn't ridiculous. The desire to punch something, or to lash out, could start as small as the temptation to tell the Minister what his two-toned mustache really looked like to his constituents. It made him look like an elderly gigolo, well past his prime. He'd been edging towards blunt honesty lately. Usually, there were no degrees between that and running for the closet so that he didn't have to hold back. But he'd learned to read the signs, the twitches he ignored and the comments he held back. His body was giving him warnings that enough emotion was built up. It needed out. He could cooperate nicely or have it taken out of his hands completely.
He’d gotten what he needed out of their deal. A loyal house elf, and proof that he needed Harry just as much as Harry needed him.
“You’re gonna make me work, after showing up on my doorstep begging for my help?”
Their stunned silence gave him a moment to catch his breath. He tried to make eye contact with all of them, but especially the woman he knew to be in charge, Abria Stepanov, from the Republic of Russia.
Tom knew what he meant. It was nice to be appreciated for his work, but it came with the expectation that they were always in a mood to entertain, always “turned on” for someone else’s pleasure, or worse, someone’s camera. The next four days would be low-key, and a great chance to chill out and not care about having dick to say to anyone. They were both that kind of tired and Dan was that kind of laid back.
He opened his mouth, letting Harry inside, but his body wasn’t at peace with this decision, and it continued to make Harry fight for what he wanted. He was still angry, this proved nothing, but his legs opened to Harry’s weight and his pelvis met each thrust from Harry without him giving his consent. Suddenly they weren’t the personalities that had them fighting each other, they were two people who needed to be touched, who were starved for pleasure and the simple comfort of blocking out their pain long enough to feel this. Draco’s breath caught as Harry pushed into him, sliding the folds of their clothes until the wrinkled fabric served to conduct touch, rolling skin in ways they weren’t ready to do with their hands. Not only did Draco stop fighting it, he gripped Harry’s neck and rode the strength of being held down. Chest to chest, Harry’s grinding touched places in him that he’d forgotten about. They stopped all thought, injecting pleasure, not just from their crushed groins, but from the center of Draco’s being. Some core, some dark place. A rift tore open and white fire shot out like volcanic rock on an ocean floor. Some deep, uninhabitable place opened up inside him, releasing a light that hadn’t shown for ages. Pleasure was the closest thing to happiness, and when Harry drove it into him, he wept to feel his body respond.
“I’m not going to be gone that long. That sounds like you’re asking me to give up my daughter.”
It’s just a cup of water. Stop listening and go get it.
Her hand went to her chest. “I love a pretty dick, but the prettiest one in the world, is revolting when you’re not in the mood. Same can be said of any twat.”
Draco didn’t budge.
She reminded him, “Yeah, but you suffered at the hands of adults when you were a child, and you cursed it, but you wouldn’t take anything for what it taught you about appreciating family and standing up for yourself. This curse is going to teach her things about who people really are behind their physical attributes, about loving herself and others, that she can’t learn any other way. It’s going to be beyond anything that you and I know. I know that what they did to you was wrong, but don’t underestimate her ability to grow around it and dominate it. She doesn’t have the biases and prejudices that adults have. She hasn’t learned to fear what people think. So don’t panic. Don’t pin all your hopes on finding this man who doesn’t want to be found.”
He made an aggressive sweep of his arm, luring the magic running through the floor hologragh, down the path they had walked. He lifted it out of the floor and the contract was replaced with a celestial view of the stars. A window onto Draco’s magic. That cosmic view, another symbol, leaked out into the room until they all felt like they were standing in the depths of space.
He took a deep breath, unsure why this was starting to feel like a challenge. “I’m curious.”

“Your testimony, your friends, and a sympathetic jury, allowed a Death Eater to walk free. What would a blood test show of your daughter’s parentage?”
Draco turned back. “How do we make it stop?”
Remus shook his head. “I can’t tell you. I heard it, couldn’t see it. It’s too dark. There’s not enough clearance to see above the roof. We should head upstairs, not down. Perhaps I can crawl onto the roof.”
“He’s my husband and I’m not sure I want anyone touching him. How did you get through the storm, and what makes you qualified?”
“You chose to carry it, instead of getting rid of it. You sealed his connection to you.”
There had been dates with other people. Even sex. All ending badly. After the trials, their reputations to heroic, bachelor status, had them ready to put some healthy distance between them. Both of them knew that they were being used. Dates were mostly fodder for gossip and social ladders. If a beautiful body let them forget their troubles for one blissful night, then it was a fair trade.
Comprehension widened Ron’s eyes. “She can shock you? Are you bloody kidding me? How’d you teach her that?”
“I’ll just have to stay with her, to make sure she’s told how perfect and wonderful she is every day, instead of being made to feel her real appearance isn’t acceptable.”
She gave him a hateful look. “Magic is children. It’s us! His rules cut off his magic. They cut off his baby. They cut off our help. We gave him the best magic we had, and he went back on his promise. Now shove off, this ain’t your committee.”
“At least tell me what you’re doing in my home.”
Harry saw him lower himself and put his head in his hands.
“That’s the thing about power. People who have a great amount, aren’t the best judges of how to use it. People fear him for a reason. He’s been on the run for years.”
The event. That's what Lucius calls it. It wasn't so much born of his desire to escape the long shadows of the manor, as it was his desire to escape limitations imposed upon him. His body, now free from a prison made of stone and cold, wet and rot, pulled the silence and beauty of his home around him like a warm blanket by a glowing hearth. Monsters need comfort too, he mused.
Hairs stood on his skin as he hoisted the stranger onto clean sheets and set about examining him for injuries. For some reason, he made sure the shades were drawn, the door locked, and the curtains looking into his home had no gaps. Something about this man, and peeling back the many layers of his coat, cloak, robe, and suit, down to the undergarments beneath, told him he was treading on dangerous ground. He kept is pistol close. He thought the clothes were only dark with rain. Stains revealed the front of the man to be drenched in blood. It ran from wounds at his throat, down the length of his undergarments. Closer examination revealed enflamed lacerations at the throat and multiple punctures. He could've sworn that the throat had been sliced, only the tissue did not open beneath his prying fingers. It made the actions of the man, his ability to fight so effectively on his feet, all the more incredible.
Everyone rushed forward as Harry caught him. “Draco! What’s wrong?”
Harry looked into Jipsy’s huge eyes. “You can feel other people’s magic. That’s how you chose your contract. What does her magic feel like to you? Is it troubled? Is she in pain?”
Draco stilled. He looked startled and caught off guard. When he swallowed and looked at Harry, it was the look of defenselessness.
He has never seen so much love in one room. It unsettles the food he’s trying to keep on his stomach. It wasn’t natural.
“Wrapped herself up in them, she did. She used the softest, most beautiful materials to soothe the most broken of hearts.”
"I can’t go in with you on this one. One of us has to take care of her. I can’t keep giving you chances to get it together. Yeah, you go find Snape. She and I have a life to get on with. We’d love it if you were there, but you’re making other plans. And the more you talk, the more I’m alone with what I have to do. So no, I don’t want to hear anymore about Hogwarts. Act like her father while you’re still here, because we both know that a trial is coming, not to mention whatever fresh hell you’re about to dig up with that portrait. Just be here for her, and stop talking about anything else. That’s what I need you to do.”
“I’m coming tonight. Right now. Are you busy?”
Sammual-Payu Hastings stretched his leathery face into the grin that Ash had not seen since he was ten. He took off his hat and dabbed at his forehead like it was the heat of the day on his boat. "You watch him," he instructed his grandson. Ash turned back to Foster, whose face showed no pain, no shock, only deep concentration.
Ash sighed. "He will be held at the hotel for several days for rest and questioning. Every faction under the CIUM, will have the opportunity to get his story. That includes the Minister's people. He will be shadowed by hidden bodyguards and appear at the opening ceremonies next week. Until then, he has a lecture and something called quidditch practice two days apart in Edinburgh."
“What about you? You’re the one who gives her cheese in both hands.”
Draco brought his legs up. He rocked into himself, looking disgusted. “No matter what you do, my actions were unforgivable.”
Lucius wrinkled his nose. “Can you put on some clothes?”
“I said take it.” A deeper voice came from her. Meaner eyes narrowed up at him, like she was scolding her children.
"Well you got it. Now you have to protect it. That takes magic."
A/N:  Please review! :-)
The goblin rolled his eyes. Collin could see now that he looked to be middle-aged in appearance, but that meant nothing when it came to goblins. He had short brown hair, faded by grey, around his large ears. His pointed teeth were mostly hidden behind an disapproving tightness to his mouth, but when he looked at Collin, he revealed them. “You can’t pay me enough to work for you.” Extra wrinkles appeared to pull the weight of his face down as he glared. Prickly, bushy eyebrows made his dark pupils all the more piercing.
"All you ever asked," read Luna Lovegood from her notes, "was that we demand uncompromising quality from ourselves. You didn't let us take the easy way out. And in the end, neither did you. Rest in enchantment, Professor Severus Prince-Snape."
“He’s trying to help us. As it turns out, we’re going to need your help. As you know, Harry’s magic acted involuntarily. It knows things we don’t. It’s family magic, and you’re all his family. I’m told that we need to have a special event. A ceremony. I don’t know what it entails, but it’s fitting that you’re all still here, because we’re going to ask that you contribute your love for us, and your magic.”
To everyone’s shock, Harry’s apology had sounded sincere. He’d turned to the head of the Malfoy family, where his supplication was the most appropriate. “My apologies, Sir. I expected just another applicant I’d have to turn away. There’s no point in going through formalities and wasting everyone’s time. It’s my personal policy to let people know up front what my answer is, instead of stringing things along. If you’ll excuse me for making you wait, I would like to beg ten minutes to match my clothing to the quality of this day, and to your company.” His eyes shifted to Draco, who revealed nothing.
Perhaps muggle jail was the last torment. He wanted Harry to come home, to make him feel like he had a home to come to. He hadn’t done a very good job of that. Maybe that’s why Harry’s life was tossing him like a leaf in the wind.
That was the unspoken deal.
Lucius stood. “See here, young lady. Give that back.” But he didn’t cross the table.  She gave the water to Harry, who poured it slowly over Draco’s face, and into his hands.
“I don’t see how you can,” he said cautiously. He didn’t want to offend her. Her words rang true, but it was all a bit much to start with, and he was losing his way. “Is this why I’m here? Why you asked me into the picture? I thought you had vital information about Snape. This isn’t really about me. I’m trying to help my daughter.”
He used her hesitation to force his way through the door. He opened it onto the doctor leaning over Draco, using both hands to hold something flat in his mouth, while the rest of his body attempted to restrain him with his weight alone.
Harry shook his head against the blast of Greg’s energy. No, he had not forgotten this bastard and nothing was okay. When he pulled away, Greg retracted his hands to himself.
But his love of the image, was as much a culprit in stirring the other to move, as anything. His desire for him, affected Draco and woke him up.
Draco looked at him, not expecting such an easy acceptance. “Are you sure?  You’re doing fine now, but it could trigger you.”
Abria looked surprised, as did all the others, but oozed a malicious smile onto her face. “Unbelievable. We have a seeker, then.”
Draco refused to be cowed. “Everyone would forgive him. You may not know what shame is, but people get that it’s too much. They get that’s he’s been through enough. They’d let him go.”
“Hostile?”
That gold dawn, it wasn't coming from the sun. It was coming from Draco. A night of first touches, of lovemaking as honey-colored in amber lamplight, as the morning that greeted them. A little shy, a little nervous that they'd onl
Even now, he could hear his name being whispered. ‘Come out, Draco. Don’t hide from me. You can’t.’
Lucius went rigid and shot back, “What is your magic doing now?”
The guy was royal, beautiful, and quite possibly every bit as demanding as his assiduous gaze upon Harry implied. Both their families were in attendance, as if everyone wanted a ringside seat and bets were hedged against Harry possessing the ability to reject this one. After a year of rejecting his parent’s traditions, in the form of every pureblooded git thinking he’s entitled to Harry’s rich vein of magic, that his family could throw at him, how did they find this? He could’ve swore his own mother snickered while the Malfoys judged every twitch in his face. Their expressions dared him to find a flaw in their son.
“You better hope my father sees it that way.”
That only frustrated Harry. Seeing Iece lit up like that wasn’t okay. It had felt like pure danger. Pure warning, that something was out of control. Not her magic, but something that wasn’t supposed to get to her. He felt it, but even he couldn’t quite face it.”
The next image his brain recorded, was a man-shaped wall of black rising between him and the flames. The sight alone, provided an insulation of cold and created a barrier between his blistered skin and the mouth of hell still ravaging everything around him.
Of course he couldn’t deny Harry the right to hide his treasure from harm. He hadn’t realized the pent up emotions that now wracked Harry’s body and shook the bed. He thought that anyone who could shatter a mirror in the faces of his parents, the way Harry did, wasn’t holding back anything. But when Harry couldn’t get himself under control, he knew better. He suddenly felt very selfish for wanting to rush Harry through his pain. The instinct was to make himself feel better. He changed his mind, sidled closer to Harry, and held him through the worst of his shudders.
Harry pointed out the bright side. “He’s awake. It worked. That’s progress, right?”
He held the photograph until his arm grew tired and lowered. He listened to his vow lingering in the silence. The other portraits were watching him without daring to interrupt his thoughts. His threat didn’t make them hospitable, but they knew who he was and wasn’t concerned about the school’s safety. Just about the threat given to one master from another. They kept their curiosity to themselves, and whispered out of Harry’s earshot.
That’s all he needed to hear. Great, he hadn’t offended her elf sensibilities. Once they got clear of the bank, they apparated home. Harry entered to a quiet dawn, filling the condo with grey and gold morning light. He’d missed his window to return before midnight, but wasn’t concerned with any argument Draco wanted to start. He found him asleep next to Iece, in his and Draco’s bed. He laughed at the musical chairs game, the lengths that Draco went to, to keep from sleeping alone. He’d be lucky if their slumber continued for another thirty minutes. It was time for them to get up and here he was just crawling into bed. Didn’t matter. He climbed in behind Draco, wrapped his arms around him, and enjoyed the most satisfying thirty minutes of his life so far.
Ron pointed, drink sloshing. “See what you’ve done. The man’s disgusted beyond reason.”
Severus grimaced. “The dragons are make-believe. And not one will be slain. If you can muster up a grain of patience, you’ll see where this is headed and it’ll be over within minutes.”
She fought so hard not to use the word ‘deficiency’ that he heard it anyway. Her face pinched on the word as if it were a painful hook snagging her cheek. She tried not to show pain.
That touch pulled him closer, until he buried his head in the top of hers and inhaled until he was satisfied that a part of her was physically inside him. Her sweaty scalp was his, and she would not have to bear that sticky discomfort alone. It was his fault, after all.
“Jipsy is hoping that Sir will come to see her vault like he promised, now that Jipsy is finished. There are many treasures that you should see.”
He spoke this out loud, with only the bird to cock its head and wonder at him.
“I look like Micky Mouse. Can you refine the appearance? They should conform to my hands. Conceal them, not attract attention.”
Arthur raised his hand. “Stop. This communication is not private. I want to know why you did this, but I want you to be clear about what you’re saying. Does she or Draco have anything to do with why you attacked Lucius?”
“I can’t take you there. It’s protected by my family’s magic. Anyone who isn’t family, who disturbs the church, becomes violently ill. Let me fetch them. There’s no point in my running, I know you’ll find me. Let me earn your trust by bringing my notes to you.”
He couldn’t simply apparate out of the vault, so he let Jipsy escort him out. When it was clear, he popped in back home, landing in his and Draco’s bedroom. It was empty and gave him time to dig the ring box out of his drawer. The insignia’s gold sheen caught a bit of light and flashed at him handsomely. He tried not to think about the prestige Bicksby indicated that came with it. Either it was going to be useful or nothing at all to him. Before pressing his thumb nail into the back of the band for three seconds, one of the few pointers he remembered, he went to the door to check on Draco. When he couldn’t see him from the crack, he ventured further out into the hall. It was after midnight, and looked like he was going to be even later than he thought, before returning for good. The television was still going, lighting up an otherwise dark living room. He heard classical muggle music and followed it to Iece’s room. There, he found Draco folded under the bed tent with her. They slept with a toy radio tuned to grown up arias and historical theatre. He took a moment to charm a note, made from Iece’s coloring tablets and broken crayons.
Harry shoved the tea service aside and leaned over Banks’s desk. “And you must realize that a comment about someone’s child, is the most personal comment you could make. Leave her out of your schemes.”
When he didn’t respond, Draco thought that it was shock. He wasn’t in shock, he was coming to a decision.
They spoke at the same time. Remus, “No one can leave.”
“I’m awake.” He smiled.
He knew he hadn’t made himself understood, but that’s all he could bring himself to say. She lifted her hands and placed them on his back and shoulders, forcing him to turn his whole body to face her. When he stood straight, she held his shirt sleeves.
He rushed to amend, “I mean, it’s real to me. As far as I’m concerned, you’re mine. But it can’t be against your will. I intend to be fair to you.”
His voice trembled, but he said it, deliberately avoiding his father’s face. “I’ve already had one kid. I don’t want to have another one. That’s what I’m supposed to tell you. The ceremony will get me out of the contract.”
Back on the elevator, he told himself not to think. Those men knew their own. They might smell inexperience and fear on him, fear of losing his license, his reputation. They might reject him. He had to be serious about grabbing dick. He had to be okay with someone grabbing him. That lower level was where he could put himself to the test. Natasha hadn’t mentioned it, but then she’d been trying to provide him with a premium experience, not the gutter-most.
He hated that they discussed him and his daughter at all. But if he was going into battle, he had to know what deceptions they were employing. Draco shouldn’t have to bear it alone, just because they were his parents and he couldn’t trust Harry to remain functioning while Lucius was in the room.
After some back and forth, he caught her up on quitting the tour, Iece’s hospitalization, and his determination to find Snape. “That’s him when he was a baby. Eileen is his mother. I’m on my way back to my old school to find another picture, just so that I can talk to the final, most accurate image of him. It’s the closest thing I have to the real person. Like I said, at school, those paintings can talk. It’s part of the castle’s magic. But not this photo, and not any wizard photo I’ve come across so far. Now she’s contacting me and I can’t break through to talk to her. Her embroidery is very limited.”
A/N:  Please review :-)
Draco didn’t look convinced, but he let Harry kiss him and see him off anyway.
Harry nodded. Hope ignited in Draco’s expression. “Because this is important. I should’ve spoken up a while ago.”
When they were out of earshot from the officer, Ash mumbled, “If that’d been me, I’d be driving away with every ticket they could legally give me. And then some.”
Lucius marveled. He had only to make a preference, to see one or the other. His vision went with his focus. What an unlimited dream. His study of it became just as engaging as the revealing of the curse itself. It was as if the curse merely lay dormant beneath Harry's skin, giving the illusion that it was entirely gone. It went deeper than genetics. It had grown roots and sank them into his magic, sustaining its life within him. How positively evil. How utterly genius. An intelligent curse that could find a way to survive.
Hermione pointed out, “You said he was rather lacking and unfortunate in the looks department.”
Foster was still on Ash’s first question. He would not be rushed ahead, no matter how uncomfortable his stare was making Ash. "Then I am that. It is of no consequence to you. If you must address me, you may refer to me as Mr. Foster, as you have been doing."
"You think I'm standing on this stage because I'm some hero? No, I’m up here because of this." He pointed his wand to his head and flung the tip out towards the audience. The memory expanded between him and the lady. It was a scene of the last day of battle, and the castle lying in rubble, with dead students, teachers, and Death Eaters alike. The audience gasped. Harry's magic was projecting what he'd experienced, without a pensieve. Even security stopped in their tracks.
He stared at them, squinting through dripping lashes. “Why do you two look so different?”
“Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy, let the full spectrum of your magical and biological heritage record that you release your son, Draco, from hearth, home, and obligations, to ally his magic with Harry. That relationship will be primary in their lives and take precedence over all others. If you are in full agreement, take your place to the left of the Potters.”
“I show it, not to impress you, but to gain enough trust to let me see if I may be of help to your husband.”
The moment was like a mirage. The promise of untold quenching, overflowing indulgence. It wasn’t real. It would evaporate any second. This wasn’t who either of them had chosen to be, yet here it was. An opportunity to ditch the control for just a few sweet minutes.
He turned to Harry. “I want this, I’m sorry.”
He made himself stop thinking along these lines. It caused his mood to grow heavy, and anxiously wander to the hope of contacting Snape. A tiny thought sneaked in. If he had caught a glimpse of Snape at the train explosion, and Snape was clearly aware of him on some level. Then he didn’t want Harry to find him. He didn’t want to be known and involved publicly.
Harry awoke to singing. It was dark outside and the television emitted an ice-blue glow, flickering along the walls. He heard his daughter’s wet gibberish as she sang along. And a woman’s melodic voice. His eyes were still struggling to focus when he realized the woman was repeating Iece’s name. And their sounds were moving about the room, not just inside the television’s volume.
Harry tries to keep still.
“She’s fine. Jipsy has her. They can’t go anywhere near her.”
“Think of it as detoxifying him. He needed defenses before he met you. Now that he has married into security, his magic is being purged of all those unnecessary toxins and extraneous methodologies.”
“Language, dear. You wouldn’t want to misrepresent your upbringing with poor manners. My point is, we all ask for things in the privacy of our hearts. Call it a different name, it’s still the same thing. You must’ve asked for Harry to figure himself out. To figure his life out and finally be done with all the things haunting him. There must’ve been times when you didn’t know how to get through to him, but you wanted him to be done with his pain so badly. Every cell in your body understands what you want for your little family, and your body let you get pregnant at the worst of times because you were asking so powerfully for help with all of that. I’m a mother, I can see it because I know it. I’ve stood where you are, minus the lack of support and goodness knows what, that you’ve been living all these years.”
“Well give him our regards,” his neighbors answered collectively and pressed baskets filled with homemade dinners into his arms. “A man that hard at work, ‘ought not be disturbed then.”
Harry gives his audience a show.
Foster's instructions to him, had been very clear. "Keep your head down. Say nothing. Observe. If a witch or wizard senses your interest, they will close themselves off to you. Act as if any magic you see is no cause for concern and you will be allowed to stand in their presence. Those who are in agreement with the discretionary involvement of non-magicals, will be wearing the IA insignia. Do not trust anyone without it."
Narcissa could not hide her discomfort with such ideas.
“You were so busy making up for what you’d done to your child, that you stayed on a path that took you right to Harry’s doorstep. That child came to you and did exactly what it was meant to do. Get you to a place where you wanted nothing more than to love it. It took loss to do that, but now you know that you were simply too hard on yourself and need not ever create such horrific tactics to sober you into loving what comes from your body, or indeed, the body itself.”
“Same here, Boss. Repeat service always makes us happy. No boyish brunettes for you tonight?”
While magic could always be traced, muggle accommodations provided refuge from fame, suspicion, and a world saturated by the aftermath of war. The muggle world was an extension of the wizard wars. It was certainly affected by them. But the way muggles blamed their problems on everyday politics, lack, or just plain bad luck, made Harry look upon them affectionately, as complete innocents. Woe to those who would wake up and learn the truth. Their governments would never admit to knowing the existence of a parallel world full of witches and wizards who knew how to manipulate energy, and so could not be forced into paycheck slavery just to keep warm in the winter, or to travel from one place to another. Such a government would have to admit that dragons, elves, and unicorns were real. And god only knew what else. Aliens? Why not, bring on the motherfucking aliens.
She looked at Draco and returned to the arm of his chair.
“I almost want you to lie to me. Tell me whatever it takes to get me in that bed. I can’t do it by myself. My body, it remembers. It’s scared.”
Ginny was still laughing, but Hermione’s practical approach put a knot in Harry’s chest. It was too close to home. Luna peeped around Harry. “Is it safe to touch her now?”
“I’ll hear you out,” she said, “but do make an effort to use appropriate language, or I’ll treat you exactly the way I treat my boys. Trust me, there’s a spell I could’ve used, that makes that slap look like a warm hug.”
He made the mistake of listening to her words, of hesitating, before pulling free and kept going. With his back to her, she gave into her panic and summoned her wand.
Greg laughed, and dove for his neck. Behind him, Harry saw Thella exit her tent. Instead of being embarrassed, he knew she had heard him. In silence, her graceful hand lifted to touch an invisible object below her throat. The talisman. She was reminding him.
He felt his brain put on the breaks before even one word against it formed. Resistance stunk the air like a fart and they both laughed at the obvious silence that followed Draco’s question.
“What have you done?” Collin asked as soon as Snape jerked his wand to remove the gag. The binds on his wrists fell away. “You’ve no idea what I had to do to convince them to take me in.”
“He’s defenseless.”
“I think so.” Luna blushed. “Startled more than anything.”
“Don’t worry, dear. I couldn’t get past your wards if Harry’s welcome didn’t allow me to. This place knows that I don’t mean you any harm better than you do. As long as this is his home, I can enter. I taught him that trick.”
“No.” His mind told him not to say another word. It told him to be insulted and get rid of Greg before he could weaken his resolve any more.
When work for the Ministry provides Harry with clues of Snape’s survival, he becomes determined to find him. That pursuit puts him at odds with Draco and his daughter, yet holds the key to unlocking a happier way of life for them all. Harry will reach a point when finding Snape becomes integral, and not a choice at all. His search will take him back to Hogwarts. He will push his way into his former teacher’s life, his secrets, his past, and discover a new chance at family, love, and closure. He will not only face his own demons, but Snape’s as well, and will be shocked to find what and who lies at the center of it all. To make everything right, he will have to visit the past and cross a transformative threshold to the new beginning that he and Draco deserve.
“What’s the most expensive, quality piano they make? I don’t know anything about them. You can trust my research or you can just tell me, to make sure you get what you want. I’ll have it custom made, and for that you have to talk to me. You can have anything you want, like that wizard muggles loved so much. Gamy still has his old albums. Liberace. He had pianos made of diamonds and gold, and she said he was really a wizard. So don’t hold back. Give me something to do for you. You’re hurting, and I need to know how to make it stop. I won’t touch your body. You’re right, you’re gorgeous, and my mind can’t help but go there. It did, the minute I saw you. I’m sorry. But we have to get out of this bathroom.”
"Yes, I agree, and I don't mean to offend you. But I believe someone else might've used a very legal Privacy Clause to keep certain information from showing up. I dare to risk your offense because I need to get as much information on these ashes as I can. I want you to test any traces of magic left. Tell me, this time under oath, if these are the actual remains of Severus Snape."
Harry squinted, as if his glasses were to blame for his confusion. “Sack of Imprisonment?”
She gets tough and her message is: “As long as you know, that I know about the baby, you won’t make any rash decisions. If I pretended not to know, you’d do something stupid and think you’ve gotten away with it. You may hate me now, but I’ve just saved you a lifetime of regret.” (This is so dynastic to me! Prime time soap opera!)
Amongst his plans, he reserved a special spot for visiting Lucius in the hospital and perhaps slowing down any chance of his recovery. He touched a vial in his pocket, knowing full well why he kept it on him.
“I promised your parents I wouldn’t upset you by talking about it.”
He went to her, lifting her out of the ball she had drawn into. “Heyyy sweetie, did you do that all by yourself? That was beautiful, I’m so proud of you.”
They all heard the creature before they saw it. Its sound thundered in their chests, not their ears. That low vibration gave the impression of something that stayed close to the ground and invisible along jagged rock walls. They looked at one another when they weren’t searching the ceiling for the apparition to take shape. The low rumble drew their eyes upwards, where light and shadows took on the ambiance of an otherworldly sky. Not evening blue, but ocean green. They looked up into depths as distant as black space and watched the thing soar down to them from a great height of nebulous gasses and moonlit illumination.
“The train explosion? Was someone trying to get to me?”
As the edges of the memory spread, an image of Lavender Brown with her neck torn open, flashed for everyone to see. A second later, Fenrir's corps, fangs just visible, paired with it.
The argument had been going on for some time. Wizards were tricky. An entirely new technology had to be developed just to identify and work alongside them. They wanted to remain hidden. Black understood what it meant to be targeted by fearful muggles, who’d just assumed that anything more powerful than them, had to be dangerous. It was the witch hunts all over again. Kill them before they kill you, was still a prevalent superstition. He understood why Harry wanted to remain hidden, but too much was riding on Muggle and Wizard relations, in the political world. Europe wanted their legendary prince back, whether he wanted to be found or not.
Laughter slipped from her, even though she was trying to be serious.
“That’s what you left me with! Then calm my fears and tell me something that makes sense.”
Draco shoved him away. “I’ve been more honest than you deserve.”
She said directly to James and Remus, “Don’t go up on that roof. That creature doesn’t want to be here anymore than we want it here. It’ll leave when its job is over. The whole storm will go. I’ve called for two more helpers with food and your cousins are making sure everyone is being looked after. There’s nothing to do but wait it out.”
And what a fucking prize!
It was Harry’s idea to call in Hermione to help with “beauty stuff.”
“I’ll do my part, Draco.”
“What?” Lily gasped.
The name stood in the air between them. Harry waited for Draco to ask the obvious. When Draco didn't, he breathed easier. They both new why Severus' name was in there. It was as logical as why the name 'Malfoy' was not. Where would they be without Snape?
“I can’t help it. You don’t remember there. You won’t let me help you. Your pain is tremendous.”
“If you’re looking for answers to help her with, then yes. You’re in the right place. But just as Thella armed you with love, I’m telling you to lose that self-pity you’re clinging to. Before you can find my son, leave that right here. You’re about to enter his private world and that will get you killed.”
In the end, what Harry withheld, was torn from him in such an unnatural way, that it came with screams. Screams of defeat. His emission pummeled him so, he could no longer fight, and the orderlies did not have to use their full strength to hold him down. The physician got more than what he needed in the way of samples, and had to administer a painkiller so that Harry could uncurl and lay flat on the floor where they placed him. He’d be given an overnight hospital stay, for observation, just in case they’d hurt him.
Draco’s tone became firm. “None of you need to stay. Harry appreciates you. We both do, but I’m his closest family right now, whether anyone recognizes it or not, and I’m not going to let anything happen to him.”
"So let's do it."
Draco’s wand still trembled, ready for a fight. Evidently, he hadn’t expected it to be that easy to stop the animation. The shock of it, still felt like another hidden horcrux, having sprung on them just when their lives got quiet. It brought back that old feeling of constant fleeing and looking over their shoulders for danger.
The woman’s mouth went beak-like. She was smart enough not to argue. She grabbed her things and demanded the driver stop. She stormed off of it with her child. Remus couldn’t let it go. He made sure to take the same bus at the same time in the following days. The child haunted him. How could anyone obviously despise such a bright, beautiful little girl? He told himself he was just making sure she was okay. There were no more incidents on the bus, but he did see her again. There was something in her face. She was less talkative and he thought he saw bruises on her plump arms. That caused him to follow her. Without the woman knowing, he watched her, becoming more and more familiar with her timid smile, her want to grab everything that came close to her, and her look of abashment when her mother pinched her.
Her legs would not let her get down on the floor very easily, so she waited for the bravest among her family members to confirm. So many strange things were going on, no one knew what was harmless and what would provoke the rogue magic that appeared to be controlling their evening.
Harry felt ridiculous for being afraid, but he couldn’t take chances. And he couldn’t move with Draco as fast as he wanted. Then he remembered that the dragon was only an extension of Draco’s emotions, and he stopped trying so hard. He even let Draco tear from his arms, momentarily. The other was so bent on baiting the creature, Harry’s attack caught him off guard. He landed on his back and this time Harry crawled on top and didn’t give him a chance to speak. His kiss came hard and determined. He knew this wasn’t the time or the place, all the more reason for putting as much of himself into it as possible. He couldn’t hold back. That meant heating a cold, wet soppiness, as unsexy and unappealing as a dead fish, to peak temperature and arousal, as fast and convincing as he could. Not sex, but the demand for Draco himself. And it was a demand. He had to invest everything he had in Draco, for the other to understand why he needed to call the dragon off.
"Okay…"
Draco insisted that he sit in a chair behind Iece, not in front of her. “Don’t let her see that.”
A series of covert whispers between Greg and a hooded night-creature-person, whose jersey was too exaggerated to reveal his face, got them through a side entrance and down an unlit flight of stairs. The only light, was the wand of a fourth person Harry hadn’t known they were following until it occurred to him that a stranger was guiding them further underground. Jasper took his hand. “Hold onto me.” And Harry followed, brushing figures who blended with the dark. Apparently, there were pockets of crowds lining the tunnel structures that got them to the lowest parts of the building. The floor felt like bare concrete beneath his shoes and when it began to thud with unnerving vibration, he knew that he’d passed some ward that had made the detection of music impossible.
He found the Guardia, the division containing Harry, and left his broom on the roof while he entered. He could’ve gone to the desk. He could’ve filled out the proper paper work and waited to be assisted like everyone else. But his flight had exhilarated him and he saw no reason to hide his true wings now. He couldn’t help it if others had no magic. That wasn’t his fault and he wasn’t going to tie an arm behind his back just to make the world around him feel better while he felt restricted. He would use his full magic today. That meant releasing an explosive stunning spell that hit anyone who put their eyes on him. It traveled through the eyes. It was only effective at a distance of twenty feet, but that gave him time to walk into the facility, scramble their security cameras, step around uniformed police, and make his way along the holding cells until he found Harry on the floor. His knees were drawn, head resting on them, and his back against the wall. With his wand, Draco short circuited the keylock on the cell. Bars slid open. He stepped over the other men lying on the floor, to get to Harry. Harry hadn’t answered when Draco shouted for him because, he saw when he lifted Harry’s head, some chemical influence kept him in a stupor.
Draco has a sleep over. That wouldn't be so bad if he wasn't thirty-eight and still obsessed with Harry, much to Lucius' regret.
“Yes, you did. And I’m not budging until you tell me about it.”
Everyone took to their brooms. They saw him transform. Once in the air, Harry had something to prove and his expression lost the open appeal of someone eager to belong. It grew tight with concentration as he filtered out everything that had nothing to do with mowing down the counter team’s chasers. This was where he knew his midnight workouts, with Draco at the Ministry and Iece in her bed, would pay off. Insomnia was a bitch, and during the months when it had been at its worse, weights and jogging were the only way to leave the worrisome monologue in his head behind.
He waited a full minute for Collin’s body to seize through as much pain as it could handle, before extending his wand to keep him alive. He made sure that he did not lose consciousness.
“Then go visit your dad. I’ll stay here.”
Harry remembered the time Mr. Dursley drove Dudley and a group of his friends to the cinema. Harry had not been invited, nor did he want to be. The car was rammed by a truck speeding through a traffic light. Even though Dudley was fine, the last he saw of his friend, whom he'd given the front seat, was the sight of the entire passenger front instantly replaced by the engine of the runaway lorry. For weeks after, during his healing, Dudley would retell the horrific event, only to include Harry every single time. "Harry went through the windshield," he insisted, no matter how many times Vernon told him that Harry wasn't even in the sodding car. It took months for Dudley to work out that that was true.
Everyone quieted when the lights dimmed a little. It wasn’t necessary to lower them, but Dudley felt that what they were about to see, needed some sort of introduction. He hadn’t watched the end of it, but the ten minutes that had him stuck like glue, struck him as critical information. If ever there was a time to make an announcement, it was this. He used the speaker system through the microphone of the computer. “Ladies and gentlemen, my grandmother has given me permission to show this to you. You may all be wondering why we can’t leave and why we can’t meet the new member. I am too. But Harry’s worth the wait. And he’s actually left something on his hard drive, that you might want to see. If you would, turn your attention to the screens. With my lovely assistant, Emerald, I’m figuring out the buttons now. Bear with me. There we go. I give you, Draco Malfoy, Harry’s husband.”
The place was legally an escort service, with permits publicly displayed and registrants medically documented. It wasn’t a crime to exchange money for sex, but it was illegal to organize it. With recent laws changing, the service got tricky. No one could prove that any escort was a sure thing, and the lady or gentleman in question was certainly free to decide how far they wanted to take the evening.
“As soon as I thought that, I went years ahead of my time. I saw my son standing in our garden. Only he was much older. Seventeen. He was kneeling, holding a tiny thing, a babe. I knew it belonged to him, wrapped in a blanket. All this was just a flash, but I knew the child was his. He sat at my feet and told me that he couldn’t keep it. He begged me to take it. To take care of it. It was you. I didn’t understand at the time, but I kept tuning into him and to you, until I understood how you both fit into my work. I knew from the vision that it was important that I give into mother this one time. Let her dress me up. Let her play with her grandson. I didn’t know that taking this picture would lead me directly to you, when the day came that you’d need me.”
She closed her eyes and brought forth her last, most vivid memory of her friend. Now was the time to give herself full permission. As soon as she had him in her focus, her heart exploded with information about him. His presence pulled her in. She heard him say her name.
He told Draco, “He knows everything and he doesn’t care. He just wants to help you.”
“Come back with me! You’ll catch your death out here.”
He dared to break the silence. “If you’re sick, I’m not going to be able to think of anything else until you tell me what’s wrong.” Surely Draco could understand this. His ears were still ringing from those kicks. “Is that why you didn’t want to undergo any tests?”
The idea of working on the project with Draco, breathed warmth into the idea. It was the first time Harry considered telling his full and true story. No matter how long he fought it, it would all come out eventually. Maybe the world would be kinder to Iece, if they knew how she'd happened. Maybe that's why he was telling the old stories. One day they were going to look at her and see how different she was. Her magic was starting to show, and it wasn't easy to understand. He was saying to them, "Remember what she's been through. Of course she's different. Don't hate her. Don't fear her. Let her live, as you've found a way to live."
There was no one else in the room Harry felt comfortable giving his child to. In that moment, she was like an angel to him. From the way she coaxed his unhappy daughter out of his arms, to the way she removed her shawl and threw it over Iece’s entire body. It billowed, and Iece’s head was on her shoulder before it settled around her. Harry knew that it was a sleeping spell and he was too grateful to be upset about it. Thella seemed to know exactly what to do. She took his baby and went back to her seat in the third row. Now no one could take pictures. Now he’d be able to keep his eye on her the whole time. It didn’t make up for Draco’s behavior, but it gave him a leg to stand on. He took reassurance from her nod and turned towards the stage. As he made his way to the podium, the audience applauded his decision to stay.
“She’s perfectly fine, Harry,” she said, knowing he needed to hear it from her lips. “She’s two floors up. She’s still running a fever, but the pediatrician said that’s normal for any child reacting to magical flares. Apparently, her magic isn’t ready for too much physical change. They’re giving her fluids that act like antihistamines. Only they ignore her immune system and work on her magic. They want to keep her overnight, just to make sure the worst is passed.”
He didn’t quite know how to say it. “If you want me to come inside your world, I don’t know how.”
“Stay away from me.” He drew his wand.
“No, I agree.” She’d started to clean up her bottles and powders while Hermione swept the hair off the floor. “Now we know never to cut her hair again until her head grows into it. She looks quite monstrous.”
Draco squared to face him. “Don’t ask me to feel nothing as you go chasing another suicide mission. How many lives do you think you have? Iece is recovering and she’ll do fine with the bracelet and the medications. We’ll all adapt. You don’t have to go back to Scotland, but you will because you’re trying to bring someone back who doesn’t want to have anything to do with you. How long are you going to ask me to watch you worship a dead man? And continue leaving us behind again and again? Not to mention the risk of prison? I can forgive your actions towards my father. We all know he deserved it, but don’t ask me to dwell on your obsession with Snape. It’s only taking you further away from me and with all this media attention and constant scandal and danger to you, there’s only so much I can take and still hold myself together for her.”
“What is the point?”
That all sounded great in theory. But when Harry tried it, all those warm, good feelings that used to flood his body, vanished. Something dark and cold, that made him feel like he was forcing a frozen wheel, took their place. If he pushed the effort, that dark cold began to take form and began to feel like a person. He could practically see the shape of their shoulders, that silhouette of long blond hair, and hear that nasty, nasal inflection. Exactly the person he didn't want to see. Not only could his body not enjoy that, it made him sick. His mind added pressure and mass against his will. It breathed Lucius' breath and let it into him, where it froze Harry's insides.
“Foster said that?”
As he came to, his mind gradually made sense of bare concrete walls surrounding him. They were fitted with bars looking out into a dim room. A basement. Water pipes came down from a false ceiling and followed overhead until they disappeared into dim recesses of the room. Oil lanterns illuminated enough to reveal shelves reinforced into the bedrock, holding dusty dark jars, threadbare volumes, trays of growing things, herbs, mushroom planters, and various sizes of cauldrons and brewing accouterments. There were benches and tables topped with stacks of books and paperwork. He knew exactly whose basement he was in. And that he was so far off the beaten path of spying and medical crimes, of lies and luxury hotels, of proving his value until he could no longer convince the Organization not to put a bullet in his head, that for the first time in nearly three years, his body felt still. Not resting, but denied the ability to run. He didn’t like it. The Organization didn’t require the childishness of bullets to get rid of him, but if it came to that, better to make it look like another unfortunate muggle conflict.
As soon as he could, Sirius took his drink from him and gulped. “Celebrations, mate. The blueboods are talking their kid off the pot. Seems our Harry put the fear of God in ‘em. He came in haughtier than a pilgrim’s buckle, now he’s blushing and crying behind that door.” Sirius pointed. “Very high maintenance, Harry, if you ask me. But he’s prettier than the lot of birds chasing after you, I’ll give him that.”
Collin said, “Without the wizards involved, you’d need to override those wands with a master wand.”
There eyes met as Draco was being pushed from the room. Maybe he was trying to get out of everyone’s way, just like Harry. Maybe he was tripping, unable to move fast enough. His slender body, still in the blazer and trousers Harry remembered from that morning, spun to clear the door frame just as the foot of a bed rammed through the opening. Some six to eight staff members held it at the rails and shoved it out like a crew working the cockpit at some muggle car rally. Their haste was violent and unapologetic, and told everyone to get the hell out of their way. Two pushed, while the others held various instruments and attachments that had to keep pace.
He heard a gasp. Draco’s outrage sounded strangled and thick, as if he could barely talk through it.
“Presumably. What happened in the hotel that caused the controversial photo in the first place? No one still knows that story and Mr. Malfoy seems hellbent on keeping it hush. Can you share anything? And does any of it relate to Mr. Malfoy’s interruption tonight?”
Ash knew to keep quiet. They were in his basement, where he saw his patients. One minute, he was watching the news, trying to come up with the weekly dinner list his housekeeper, Reuse, required. The next, floorboards shook beneath him, vibrating as heavy equipment scraped across his basement and something moved around down there, knocking into tables and cabinets. He heard his steel trays crash to the floor and stacks of hanging files clattered from their shelves. Glass broke. He heard a mess, and he knew immediately that it couldn't be an animal. No raccoon, small enough to find its way inside, could be responsible for that much explosive energy and commotion. And no intruder was stupid enough to ransack his home in broad daylight with his vehicle sitting right out front. That meant he had a very special visitor.
“Word has it, he's some kind of baddass business wizard or something. A reformed Death Eater? So how'd he let that photograph happen? DMLE hit your hotel up for questioning after he showed up today. They’re saying he tripped wards right in front of muggles.”
“Good. Get on it. And have him help us get Draco to bed. Come with me, I’ll show you where that is. I plan on waiting out this night with him. Your elf can chaperon us if that makes you happy, but I will stay in the same room with him. I’m sorry that you can’t leave, but there’s an underground passage back to the guest house. Have your servant bring you whatever you need to be comfortable, I don’t know how long this will last. If what Gamy says is right, your elf may not be able to come and go at will all night. There’s a time limit.”
“If you don’t want to see this, I’m asking you to step out.”
What if it took much more than a kiss to bring this beauty back to life? He'd tried everything. He'd waited by the stone sarcophagus for three days after ravishing those lips. Breath came, but barely. He felt it when he pried the mouth open with his own, and dared to taste what was inside.
“I won’t. I promise.”
His face trembled. “You threw me away. Like garbage. I offered you love, and you rejected me. You hated me. Why do you come here now?”
“I was looking over your resume. I noticed that you graduated from the Imperial in London.”
She couldn’t let that child be scarred by Harry’s loss of control. She couldn’t let Harry, in his erratic state, fall into the hands of nonmagics who thought him dangerous. She was shaking as she withdrew her wand. No one was looking at her. All eyes were on Harry. He’d assaulted an officer. A woman. Accident or not, he would not be given fair treatment. He might not even make it to the muggle station alive. He could hardly communicate to defend his actions, let alone explain his behavior. She could see in his eyes that he didn’t even know what he was doing. When she saw the officer hit him, she made up her mind.
“You may answer with a spoken word for this, Harry.”
“I don’t have any control, you bastard! I was born into their contracts. I was given life, on the condition that I abide by their rules. They used magic to make me what they wanted me to be, before I took my first breath. They wanted their idea of the perfect child. You wouldn’t know anything about magic like that. Yours might be old, but you’ve forgotten the old ways.”
He disapparated without giving Harry anymore of an answer than that. Harry’s mouth gaped, at first in concern, then in exasperation. Then in anger. The fancily dressed people around him were getting an unexpected show. He moved, stunned, with his daughter, as cameras began flashing around him. People seemed to leap out in front of him to get the shot they wanted. It slowed his progress to the stage and he had no idea what he was going to do when he got there. They all saw what had just happened.
Greg’s curses were lost to the wind. Harry lost sight of the snitch and made a wide swoop. He noticed that the players below had mostly stopped to watch him and Greg. It wasn’t a real game, so no one was worried about losing. All interest seemed to be on his competition with Greg. He chose a spot to keep his eyes fixed on. The center hoop at the far end. He’d reached the point that he knew his eyes weren’t going to see the snitch by looking around for it. They were going to keep still until the snitch’s glittering movement distracted them.
Draco gives Harry one last chance to make the right decision.
“And he was so handsome, our parents didn’t dare turn their backs on us for the entire eight weeks. Lucky for us, we knew extension charms and we cast them under the table.” She snickered as if no one else but the two of them could hear her confession.
It was bad enough that he’d been careless to take any risks at all, but of course they were going to comfort each other. But it was worse having Mrs. Weasley guess it and threaten to tell. He couldn’t forgive himself for that.
“Your level of influence, and your love of nonmagical people, makes you an enemy to them. If you had no power, you would be quite safe. They’re only concerned with threats to their magic. They have technology and magic that lets them see future timelines. This is where I must stop and tell you how to protect yourself. Give me your hands again, we’re going to make a talisman.”
“Yeah, what’d you do?” Harry took them off to examine them.
"You can bring it. Please." Harry knew that every word out of his mouth was being monitored for contractual intention. If his statements registered a certain score, they could be deemed as binding and documented in his records.
James frowned. “Are you still drunk?”
They stayed like that until Harry was sure of Draco’s answer.
Her narrowed eyes said, as much as she cared for him, she wasn’t about to pretend she hadn’t heard that. She put her hand on his arm. “Yes. I know you don’t want to hear this, but Harry needed a reason to survive that night. Without her, he probably would not have.”
Now who’s being dramatic, he scolded himself.
“You don’t know what you’re asking.”
He didn’t call his lawyer, when they had him processed and in a holding cell. He called Reuse. His bittersweet ally. She could be difficult, but she generally took care of him. It just never went the way he planned it. He’d offer her a deal.
Narcissa looked shaken but coping.
She was proud of his sense of responsibility, but wanted him to know also, that there was no such thing as wrong, when two people were carving a path for themselves. “A marriage is what you make it, Harry. You can love anyone. That decision is less about them than it is about you. They’re simply fortunate that they reap the benefit of your affection. You are freer than you think, when it comes to deciding who you love. A contract might seem cold, but it really just simplifies the whole process.”
“Take all the time you need, Draco, mummy’s right here.”
When Lucius tried to stand, he kicked him into the pile of bins that had already scattered. They were back on the same lawn and the sight of Lucius slipping on grass and garbage, gave him the idea to open  as many bins as he could and dump all the contents on top of him, like the garbage he was. Each time Lucius tried to crawl away, apparently wounded now, he wondered what he’d have to do to actually break some bones and keep him in one place. It was beginning to dawn on him why wizards had wands. They actually needed them to do serious harm to one another. Lucius may not have been using magic by the Ministry’s definition, but he was a magical being and it worked in his favor to keep him hardy enough to take Harry’s blows.
He didn't know how to tell his therapist. He didn't know how to explain it. It was just something he did every once in a while. He never thought it would get out of hand. He never thought he'd be hospitalized or have to sit through months of therapy just because one asshole couldn't take no for an answer. And had brought friends.
“Right now, the ability to soothe yourself and to relieve your guilt, is where your focus should be. Not work. Not weddings. Not fixing anything. Simply feeling better. It is this secret ingredient, this liquid trust as it were, that frees up your magic and causes your every decision to work itself out. In your current condition, you cannot bring a child through without it.”
He looked for clues as to what Severus was picking up, in his expression. The longer the scan went on, the more unreadable it became. There were moments when it wasn’t just a scan because he stopped over a certain spot and appeared to force the vapor in. At these times, the substance flowed like mist over water, and rushed in a hazy film into Draco’s hands and abdomen. It looked like it was being sucked into him voraciously, before reaching a calm that had it floating elsewhere again.
“No, I don’t. Look, we have to go.”
“Don’t panic, Mr. Potter. I’m not going to hurt you. I just want to give you something.”
“It’s rare, but my magic sometimes escapes me and does what it wants. Or rather, it does what it knows I want. And I wanted you. Gringott’s now recognizes our contract as complete and legitimate. Legally, we’re married. But we’re not married, to me, until you grant me that privilege.”
Gold lettering. Official stamp.
Any other time, James would’ve joined his complete disregard of the situation, but Harry looked desperate to talk to him.
Harry did his best to digest this news. He scanned his body for pain, finding mostly stiffness from lying still. "But it was Snape. I saw Professor Snape. Clear as I'm seeing you. I've been in this room two days?"
He looked James up and down. “Well, maybe I get my facts mixed up from time to time, but I know when love has touched two people. It’s a gift as well as a curse. If I speak too much, do overlook my excessive need to please. I don’t know if Sev has told you, but that’s my specialty. I bring people together. Those of us who were not as fortunate to have someone assigned to love them, turn to me for divinations of a romantic nature. When I’m not healing broken hearts, I’m helping Sev. I’m sure you two must have a fairy tale marriage. Forgive me if I’ve tuned in on past frequencies that you’ve laid to rest.”
“Darling, it’s all right.” She pressed her hands to his back. As if competing for graciousness, Lily moved to Draco’s side with a glass of water. Both women looked at each other with steel in their eyes. Lily did not back down.
“You can’t kill us, we’re your wisdom. We’re eternal. Our forms will change when you need them to. Now that you are done judging yourself, we hope that you will enjoy your freedom. We never meant to make you cry. We only ever wanted you to know how much love you bring to the world. You are necessary, or you would not exist. We do not ask for payment, we have no need for it. But you wanted to give. So you gave a child, the greatest expression of magic that you could give. Then you got scared and changed your mind. That’s all. Your wishes were always supported by us, no matter how they changed.
“Your body knows what sexual indulgence feels like. It’s accustomed to it. You have some experience. Virgins tremble when they’re this close to someone who wants them. You haven’t been completely honest.”
So this was a setup. Reuse was going to hand him over to Foster? Well, that was just bullocks, wasn’t it? If this were a power struggle, she’d clearly hadn’t put her money on him. It was almost like suffering two rejections in one sitting, only… Only Foster had put up the money to bail him out. He could’ve washed his hands of Ash. He could’ve kicked Ash’s ass once he’d gotten out of jail by his own means. He cared. Even if he was only making sure Ash got home so that he could kill him, Ash had a place under his skin. Foster must have intentions, which meant that he must’ve been thinking about Ash all evening, which meant that no matter what Foster said, Ash wasn’t far from his mark.
“We don’t have time for this.”
Harry watched him set up. He could’ve transfigured everything he needed but he was probably trying not to use unnecessary magic around Iece.
He raised his voice. “If you’ve come looking for a duel, I’m sorry to disappoint you. I have no wand, as you very well know. And since I am in no doubt as to my manhood, I feel no urgency to prove it to you.”
“If we’re not talking about the train, what are we talking about?”
The more it had gone on, the more Harry realized he hadn't known what was happening or why, or who. Someone's hands were definitely on him, but they didn't feel like solid hands. He couldn't explain it. And the more he couldn't explain it, the more he knew it was wrong. It had felt too good, until it hadn't felt like his body anymore. His body became strange to him. A stranger's body. His body couldn't possibly have sensations like that. It didn't make sense until… Until it put him back at the Malfoy home and that man, that monster…
“What are you going to do?”
“Not to worry. That’s what magical, allergic reactions do. They act like chemical explosions. Like a muggle fizzy dropped into a glass of water. Her magic went off like pop-rocks, yes? I’m not the doctor looking after her, but I spoke with her, Doctor Geneva in Pediatrics. I’m told the worst of your daughter’s fizzing is over. She just needs to rest and to take inflammatory neutralizers while the last of her fizz goes flat. Yes? It really is that simple. You and Draco may want to invest in a tent for her home bed. Likely, with magic that strong, she’ll be an early bloomer. You’ll sleep better.”
He sat down on the bed. “All your parents have to do, is be willing to present themselves. I will preside over the ceremony. Any ancients who have anything to do with you, will be in attendance. You will not see them, but you will feel their effects. You see, now that you are an adult and you have a voice, you will be allowed to use it. In fact, everything that takes place, stands on the clarity you give yourself. I will give you the tools to navigate this ceremony, and therefore your life, but it’s up to you to use them. Your parents need only be present so that their arrangements for you can be augmented according to your preference.”
"As soon as she comes out, what are you going to do?"
Draco’s wand shook. His voice tightened, and he spoke through his teeth. “What do you care? You don’t even know me. I’m nothing more than a prize to you.”
He hung up and waited, deciding that a muggle walk to Harry's room should take no longer than ten minutes tops, providing the desk clerk dropped everything right then or delegated the task to someone who would. When fifteen minutes passed without a callback, Draco snatched up his phone. It rang in his hand.
“Every second you’re alive, is uncomfortable to me. I’ll bear it. I’ll put up with it. But I won’t ask my daughter to do the same. I won’t ask her to hide from you anymore. She’ll be able to go any where in the world, and not have to fear you. She won’t have to run. After all this time, today I’ve learned just how far your reach can go. And none of us can outrun it. So yeah, I couldn’t face you when it was all about me. But when it comes to her, I’ll face you, and I’ll make sure it’s the last time I do.”
Harry could hear his mother’s voice insisting that he gain trust first, ask questions later. But if Draco was sick, that presented seriously dark avenues that he needed to rule out as soon as possible. If Draco was sick, he had to get him help. His instincts sent him terrifying possibilities, all of which he had to rule out because wizards didn’t typically get sick the way muggles did. Being a pureblood, surely Draco’s magic afforded him immunity against the most alarming diseases. He tried to be content with knowing this, but he knew it was going to eat at him like acid if he didn’t get it out of the way.
Lucius Malfoy looked down his elegant nose at Harry. “If you must.”
Harry nodded, aware that he didn’t fully understand.
As Snape’s body blended into the crowd like the shadow he intended it to be, magical scans passed over him. Out of their path, he sent one more arc of intention aimed at Harry, and willed it to remain impenetrable around him for as long as it could. Skin armor. A shield no broader in range than an inch from Harry’s skin. It slipped around him as he lay face down in the grass, pushed there by officials working spells to keep the muggles distracted. The smaller it was, the harder it would be to detect, the longer it would remain in place. They could take him, but they couldn’t harm him. Not for a while anyway, and by then, he would see what could be done to orchestrate an escape, if it came to that. The fact that Arthur was there, meant that Harry would be given the opportunity to explain himself and a fair trial. He knew that Arthur would fight for this. That bought them time.
“Then admit it, you’re pissed sideways and disgusted at me beyond words. Just yell at me, already.”
She seemed her usual aloof self. Today’s ensemble was a mini dress that looked like it’d been cut from an electric-red tarp. Honestly, that fabric was meant to repel water and guide airplanes to landing strips, not have faux diamond buttons sewn up the front. At least she was wearing hosiery that let a bit of skin show through. Sheer yellow, but still he got to see something nice. Her black hair was down as well. That was a rare treat. The only time she let it drape down her shoulders was when Foster was around. Every other time, she complained that it was either too hot or so heavy that it gave her headaches, but she admitted to being too vain to cut it. “Great hair and nails are better than jewelry,” she’d bragged.
Then it dawned on him that the girls and ladies who cornered him in bathrooms and parties, were so much more experienced than him, that he amounted to nothing more than a device that didn't need batteries. The only way he could make it fun for him, was to pretend they were long-waisted and flat-chested, like Draco. That their soft thighs were actually wound with cords of muscle that flexed and released to cushion against his momentum. When this wasn't enough, he let men take him home. He was still processing those few encounters, as if something simply shut down for the time it took to let them do what they wanted to do to him. He never saw the same person twice, and the one or two times he'd actually let himself have the pleasure he wanted, caused comments to circulate. He'd heard himself referred to as a "Diamond in the rough. All power, no breaks," twice at one banquet. His reputation acquired a waiting list as well as a host of quidditch slurs.
Keeping her bound to home and schooled was not a solution to him. Would that amount to hiding her or protecting her? It would only set her back socially, and she had to be present in the world, for her life. He remembered the shy kids at Hogwarts, the really awkward ones who seemed apologetic just for existing and taking up space. Shyness is really fear, it’s just touted as something modest and cute in kids, but it really isn’t. No baby is born shy. They learn to go inside themselves. He too, learned to keep his head down, lest he attract punishment from any of the Dursely’s. It was possible that if he’d had no magic, he would’ve stayed a meek and suppressed person, raised under such conditions. He couldn’t let that happen to her. They had to find a way to protect her without hiding her. She had to grow up proud and unfazed by the curse.
“I know. I love it. Thank you. I feel so treasured by all of you. All this fuss, for me.” Draco kissed him again and nestled until his head lay on Harry’s shoulder.
She was worth negotiations. A truce. If he made peace with Harry, then Draco would forgive him. Draco would finally stop trying to make up for his father’s sins and let Harry live his life. Let his sister live her life, and stop pretending to be some nursemaid to her. He’d marry. He’d raise his own in this house, right alongside Harry. The family could be even greater than before. These were the dreams he didn’t trust, yet he roamed his grounds just to see them unfold in his mind. That’s what he’d been thinking, when an invisible fist smashed into his jaw.
Harry balked. “He’s only just started to relax. Can it wait?”
“What you see is a modified scan, with protection built in. These are cleansings and blessings, since I do not know what ancestral waters I am disturbing. He’s old blood and so is Harry. These may be charms, but there is hostility behind them. They were put here with the expectation that no one should go snooping. He may be asleep, but he still does not take kindly to the invasion of privacy. The smoke you see is a byproduct of obeisance. I am asking his soul for permission to see behind his symptoms.”
The Lucius thing looked intrigued. “Oh look. Your champion is upset. I do so love a champion. Unfortunately, Mr. Potter, his gods don’t give a fuck what you have to say. Draco must speak up for himself.”
Who he was six years ago, was someone incapable of handling such news. Not with grace, anyway. But he’d also seen James with his little empire of a son, and that didn’t look so bad. Fatherhood was no longer the Kryptonite it once was. And that old, playboy Sirius, had no child to have to reckon with. But this one, the one present and hearing the news, did. They were different people now, and the more Remus talked, the more he merely wanted to meet his daughter. Not sulk in revenge or bitterness, just meet her.
He did shake him. “What do you need it for? What! What’s it doing for you, besides poisoning you?”
To his horror, the next sound he identified, was the sound of Draco’s shoe stomping the one window in there. That window had all kinds of security wards on it, and wouldn’t break, but it sounded like Draco wasn’t letting up. If he continued, he was going to piss the house off. Those were mostly Gamy’s wards and had her temperament. She gave people a chance to do the right thing, then she struck. Draco was ten seconds from receiving an electric shock that could throw him off his feet. But if Gamy knew that he was now family, Harry couldn’t be sure if the house would retaliate at all. He couldn’t chance it. For all Draco’s heat and anger, he still struck Harry as desperately, emotionally frail. Like, not in the best of health, no matter how good the exterior package looked. He was one strained blood vessel away from having an aneurysm.
He lay back, closed his eyes and waited. “I know that’s not romantic, but we can do that later. Right now, I need you to just make it happen because I can’t. We must be down to forty minutes. I’m too nervous. I’m too unattractive. I--”
And written very long ago…”
People appeared to be amazing to her. She pointed and looked to him, when she didn’t have words for what she wanted to say. He thought he’d be facing a tantrum or two, with a two year-old surrounded by a wonderland of colorful foods, candies, toys, and options. She did whine a little at the things she couldn’t have, but whenever their cart neared another customer, she forgot being upset and stared open-mouthed at all the new differences that strangers brought into her awareness. It was as if her mind was fully registering that people came in all shapes, colors, and sizes, and you never knew what you were getting when you met someone new. He could practically see her entranced mind learning.
“I should’ve known. If anyone could find me, it’s you...”
He knew that James's son was a grown man. But that didn't make it right. He simply couldn't stop himself from reaching under Harry's blanket. This was the third night, and still the boy pretended to sleep through it all. Even if he never penetrated, he needed the skin. He needed the contact. He needed the taste.
Draco’s mouth hung open, displaying his unceasing shock in the dark, where Harry couldn’t readily see it. He didn’t know where this energy and stamina was coming from, let alone this appetite. And he didn’t know how his body found new ways of pleasing Harry and rippling such a steady stream of opiate adrenaline through his veins at the same time. It went on for hours, leaving both of them unable to deny that something different had affected them.
To be such an externally motivated couple, their marriage obviously shaped by money and magic, they looked at each other with a very intimate language. With strained eyes and unmoving lips, they spoke their concerns to one another. Harry sensed fear and regret. He felt Narcissa’s panic, and Lucius’s failure to soothe it. To be the best dressed wizards in the house, they looked the most vulnerable at the moment. Harry knew what they were thinking. They put up shields to keep the world from seeing their weaknesses, but when they looked at each other, they bared their souls. What had they done to their son?
Far from sleep, Harry almost sat up. Draco’s words electrified him. That tremor, running up his body, felt like truth. Draco hadn’t been there in the boathouse when Snape passed away in his arms. If he let his mind go there, he could still feel him. He’d had no pulse. His whole body was slack. Even the iron grit in that face, that had intimidated everyone for so many years, was let go. Being smeared with his blood, and holding his weight, had left an intimate knowing of him, that Harry could never wash off. He did die that night. And yet, Harry wasn’t the only one with evidence to the contrary. He suddenly knew what he had to do.
Oh, yeah. How to break the news gently?
“She’s going to be okay. I promise. I’ve figured something out. She was perfectly fine, my friend. Her fever spiked minutes ago. Doctor Geneva signaled for me to come and examine her magic, while I was still talking to you. Whatever happened, it didn’t happen until you awakened. I need you calm. I think she’s reacting to you. Your magic.”
Harry stiffened at Mr. Malfoy’s hands on his back. Long fingers sliding up his jacket, stunned his defenses. He tried to turn, to shrug his boss off, but the other man pressed him into the door.
He hated to be ‘that husband,’ but if he didn’t act, Draco was going to hurt himself. Talk about having a dragon by the tail. Part of him stalled, because he knew Draco was right. He’d been unable to stop himself from pushing too hard, too soon.
Outdoor furniture, what wasn’t bolted down, had already blown away. It was as dark as a summer evening, and if he’d been superstitious, he would’ve sworn that God was angry. But he wasn’t, so he slipped along wet tiles, gripping the banister to find his way while squinting through torrents of wind and water, that made him fight for every step. Now he understood what Sirius had meant. His mother was right. No one could drive in this mess.
A crack in Draco’s voice told Harry how effective the sight of his full erection straining through his shorts must be. “Bet you haven’t seen this in a while. I’m back. Maybe someone should try to kill me every night. I’m fucking over it. I wanna see yours.”
Credit: Cody Fern is the real beauty, no discredit to him.
Note:  Just a reminder, Draco has a very sad story to reveal. Be prepared to skip what makes you uncomfortable. I will still attempt to write it as beautifully as possible.
“I don’t.”
“Draco, tell them. Tell them that once it became your life, you had to make choices for you, not for them. These are bullies, not gods, you have to defend yourself.”
“Who’s there?”
In his ear, his mother whispered, “It’s over. The first time is the worst. You will never suffer this again. When he touches you now, he will be himself, and you will want his touch. He has made sure of it.”
He winced. “Don’t say it like that.”
He stood speechless. Not because he didn’t know what to say, but because he knew that Harry would never forgive him for being as phenomenally rude to her, as he wanted to be at that moment.
“She’s never experienced anything like that.”
Collin turned to Snape, eyes frantic. “Severus, I’m perfectly willing to help you. That curse was inflicted against our wills. Now that Voldemort is dead, I can tell you everything I know, but I don’t know how to undo it. You must believe me.”
His second wife had taught him that he needed something with meat on her bones, and someone happy to be in her skin, no matter how excessive that skin was. It was more flesh to hold onto, to warm against and feel enveloped by. If nothing else, Foster’s cruelty showed him how lonely he’d become. That he’d been willing to shelter a potential murderer, rather than stick it out alone, cushioned his self-loathing. Loneliness could drive a person to do anything. It wasn’t a crime to need human contact. Foster hadn’t said a word about his sexual preference, simply cursed Ash with ‘never.’
He saw banners draping the second landing, depicting the skull and snake emblem so integral to Voldemort’s fear campaign. Guests with hidden faces and formal clothes, side-stepped Ron and Hermione, who were tied on the floor and made to keep their eyes forward and open. Voldemort’s temporary throne had been arranged at the head of the table, with Draco by is side. Laughter poured with champagne, as glasses were refilled. But this background was blurred and muted compared to Lucius’s barking insults, and hands like meat hooks, that tore at Harry’s clothes.
Bicksby clapped his hands together. "That answers our question. Mr. Potter, it's regrettable that we meet under these circumstances, but I am still delighted to have met you."
Banks gave a defeated sigh, pausing before reaching inside a drawer and pulling out an envelope. “Your badge, along with pertinant information and maps of the tour grounds in each city. As you know, the train disaster made adjustments necessary.”
He put his hands to his temples and leaned against the wall.
“My new friends. The CIUM.”
She’d been glad to see Severus. He’d been treated poorly as Lily’s friend. She once tried to tell him that only truly extraordinary wizards were ridiculed unfairly, until they learned to protect themselves. There’d been no way to convince him of his potential when he was fourteen. He wouldn’t even look her in the eye back then. His long hair hid his skinny face, and kept the world from seeing the true light of it. He appeared to love Lily in place of loving himself, and it wasn’t her place to explain to him that  a woman needs more than a puppy’s loyalty. If he didn’t like himself, he didn’t have anything her daughter could depend on. But she always felt his magic and hoped he’d wake up from his self-dejection. He was harmless, yet he attracted James’s jealousy.
They had been through too much. Priorities had changed. Draco's stare impaled him, reminding him who was there when Harry had to be screamed at to push. "If you don't push right now, you're going to fuck her up really bad. Her head is soft, Harry. I see it. Dammit, wake up and push!"
“How is it for storage? It’s a fu-  It’s an exact replica of your parent’s manor.”
“Give me a clue. It’s locked inside you. What can I do to get you to tell me?”
James wasn’t laughing anymore. She gave him her evil eye. “Don’t you dare.”
Rankar said what Draco was thinking.
She took her eyes off the road to glance at him. “Plane. Books. A normal bed. Antique posts. He’s got curtains around it, like a canopy. Forest green Florentine velvet. He saw how enchanted I was by it all, that he did that thing with his wand, moved a bookcase aside, and the whole thing opened up to an overlook. Literally, you go from walking on carpet to walking on bedrock and staring out into this cavern with a waterfall. A real fucking waterfall. The water echos so loudly, he showed me he has spells to buffer the sound. But it’s really beautiful and you can just lay in bed and watch it if you wanted to. It’s lit from his living room below, and it looks like an inner world paradise.”
Chin high, lips smug. “If your patronis proves compatible, I’ll sign.”
In lieu of meddling mediwizards, who reported everything to the Ministry, he relied on potions and elf magic to keep himself discreetly diagnosed.
Draco bore the stares and the knowledge that strangers were glued to his private life. He flushed, but held up next to Harry. “Okay,” he agreed.
“The book of love is long and boring…
***THIS IS NOT A NEW CHAPTER. THERE WILL BE A NEW ONE TODAY, THOUGH.***
Harry blinked while he readjusted his impression of Jasper. He told himself the guy wasn’t doing anything wrong. People hit on him all the time. But he had to stop it right there. “I’m in a relationship.”
That Draco didn’t survive the war anymore than he did. We both died. We were both reborn.
He hesitated.
She hunched her shoulders, bracing herself for his anger. “The same magic you take to him, the same one he takes to you. Master and the forbidden one are united by blood. He may come as he pleases. Millie and servants can do nothing to stop it. Wards don’t stop it. The estate accepts the forbidden one.”
“Didn’t you set it up for me? Don’t you want this grand gesture? If you let me through, we get to have this on that side. We get to live life like we designed it. We haven’t had that before. Not like we could. Every life is a struggle. Every life, we hurt someone or kill someone. We’ve played every part. We keep hurting each other. Now we have a chance to pass our own test. What do we have to be afraid of?”
“But I left you. I jumped out the window.”
“His skin breaks open at the slightest touch. He’s gotten cold.”
Lucius could take care of himself. Snape knew this, and found it oddly curious that his attempts to defend himself were only half-hearted. Harry’s magic was stronger, but Harry could never stoop to the tricks that Lucius knew, that had won him evasion from many a stronger wizard in the past.
Her smile turned rubbery, as if she’d lost all conviction, but she tried to hold onto it. “Um, that’s not important right now. Just cooperate with the doctors and they’ll approve your release. Your daughter really needs you. I’m sure all that matters right now is getting back to her and Draco.”
The photos burned Harry’s heart.
Ron wanted to risk taking Hermione by the hand and apologizing, but all he managed was a hand on her leg. In spite of tears that she couldn’t get to stop flowing, her driving was steady and sure. She knew what she had to do and he loved that quality about her. In the end, she grabbed his hand and clung to it.
He had scampered away from Voldemort’s camp with a number of vengeful curses assailing him. A particularly nasty Tourrettes jinx appeared to muggle doctors like severe schizophrenia, and left Morell too disconnected to defend himself at times. Given enough time, it would wear off, but the doctors who performed his prefrontal leukotomy didn’t know that. When Snape thwarted the hospital’s best security to confront him, he found Morell locked in an upper tower, using a stash of bread ties, twisted into a long antennae wire, hiding mice corpses behind loose baseboards and playing with them. He’d been practicing the killing curse, utilizing what little magic could be channeled through the wiry ties. Snape walked right through the halls, having studied the layout of the building before enacting his plan to kidnap Morell. Muggle security guards and cameras were easy to distract and disable.
“Hey!” Sirius pointed. “That’s off limits. I was making fun, you’re just being mean.”
Avi held up his hands and made a show of backing off. “Take some time, then. I encourage you. Today was too much of a shock.”
her voice whispered. He saw her two-toned skin. He remembered something else she’d said.
Draco didn’t know what to think, and it showed on his face.
“Why one hour?”
“I tried to stop him.” She spoke to her husband and tried to keep her voice steady.
Though he prided himself on being a wizard, there were times such as this that he couldn't deny he was a man. Presented with such bounty, after going without for so long, what man wouldn't slip his fingers into that delicate, skin covered gateway? He made his choice. Because he had not done it in so long, he didn't dare attempt to mount Harry's body. He didn't have to. His fingers sank so hungrily into Harry's hidden parts, causing such a disturbance to sleeping waters, that his whole body awoke to its full potential. The pads of his fingers triggered Harry's reflexes, causing Harry's legs to slam closed and his lower back to arch off the mattress. Muscles that, a moment ago, were slack and unguarded, jerked into contractions that adopted the pulse of Lucius' fingers. Adopted it and met it as Harry's body trembled against the slick charge of Lucius' hand. In sleep, his body voiced its surprise as his head pushed deeper into his pillow and his arms reached to push away a phantom it could not see.
“You haven’t been with us, you don’t know what it’s like. You were always meant to be a mother. A wife. We’re men, and nobody fucking knows what this is like for us, yet you would have us turn ourselves into jokes, just to make yourself feel better. I don’t give a damn about any plant or any baby, I have enough to think about. And you haven’t proven anything.  As far as I’m concerned, you’re just an old lady desperate to feel useful. Go back to your family and meddle in their lives, why don’t you?”
It wasn’t that the noises were particularly loud, just that they were loud enough, and came from a wizard who still looked deceptively boyish, but was so powerful that his virulent passion spread from Draco’s far room, infecting the whole house with the heated seething of a man determined to make sure every ancestor hanging upon every wall, knew that he was fucking Draco Malfoy.
“For things like this, like figuring out how to contact a doctor on the outside. And where to put the guests. How to make everyone comfortable.”
He wasn't at all certain that bringing a corpse from a crash site to his home, was the right thing. But if Foster needed supportive words, he would give them. This was a side of Foster, he hadn't seen until now. He didn't know what was going on, but very fact that this man was speaking from, what looked like a state of shock, had Ash waiting to see what would come next.
Draco ignored him. He went up to the gate and knelt down. The child took a few steps back, like a timid puppy. He caught sight of pudgy feet and cute little toes. “You don’t seem angry with me.”
He sensed Grail standing behind him, patiently observing something he didn’t understand, but had sense enough to stay back.
If this was a necessary thing, done only to get a child, then it was a bonus that it connected him with who he really was again. His climbing pleasure said that it was about much more than that. It was about giving himself permission to live again. To feel, running his emotions wide open, in the safety of a man’s company. And not just any man. His husband. He held on, and met every thrust with as much appreciation as he could. He savored the strength that was almost too much for him. He forgot about the time, and their families. Harry drove him, flooring it, speeding them down a road without limits. He went, a hostage to velocity. When they crashed, they crashed together. The way it threw his body, he had to know what an orgasm really was. It was pleasure at its most violent. Even the mildest vanilla crests, were caused by eruptions deep inside the earth. His gut locked beneath Harry and didn’t let go, until he opened his eyes to the sunrise.
He folded his arms and dropped his head. What was was she up to?
He had to forgive himself for being so disgusting as to have a baby. So shameful, as to lose his masculinity in a room full of people and made to submit like a… like a woman. In front of his friends.
Lucius gripped his mattress and tried to pretend that he could block it out. If he were asleep, the whole ordeal might be lost to dream chaos, but no. He was awake and unable to escape the gravity of their conjoined magic. If he had known twenty years ago, that Harry was this powerful, he would’ve done everything in his ability to talk Voldemort out of harassing the boy. He would’ve paid to have someone kidnap him and sell him off to some human trafficker, rather than suffer this fate.
Witches cackled vengefully in the back of his mind.
He tried to keep silent for the few minutes it should’ve taken her, but her movements were extra fastidious instead of her usual practical speed. She hummed and took time to rearrange the new dark mink falling around her shoulders. At least he thought it was a mink. He honestly couldn’t pin down what creature had given its life for its plush black fur.
I realize there are things that readers don’t like, and there’s no way for me to make every reader happy. Think of it like being a guest at a feast. It’s your choice, you can skip dishes that you don’t like. You wouldn’t want someone lapping up your meal, then spending the evening complaining about that one dry dish that you didn’t get right. Be gracious, especially if you’ve made it this far. Enjoy what you can, skip over the rest. This is an enormous amount of work. It’s meant to be fun, not perfect. Not serious. Not even highly logical. Just a fun adventure where the emotional stakes are high. No matter how sophisticated we think we are, we’re just kids playing in a sandbox. So let’s play! :-)
When no one thought of a good enough reply, they all settled for sipping at the same time.
Harry’s endurance of relatives who’d had no idea of his power, and kept him in ignorance, only to rise to his fullness in the Wizarding world, helped Draco to see that life was what you made it, not what you came from.
“Harry, let’s try something. On that side, I’m really terrified. I can’t tell you what I did. It was atrocious, or at least it represents that for me. Pure shame. What if we could bring something soothing from here, over to there?”
The smile disappeared from Harry's face.
Draco answered for him. “We didn’t. Our new house elf says its standard self-defense these days, although not a common ability in children so young.”
Lucius held a box out to him. “For the child.”
Her mother pushed her hand down a little too harshly, and threatened to spank her if she continued. Remus turned his back to keep from distracting her, but his ears pricked up. She had a distinctive voice for a child so young, and he felt something about her. What he’d given up was never far from his mind, and when she’d gotten quiet, he risked another peak over his shoulder. He turned in time to see an outburst cut short by her mother’s slender fingers pinching her arm. Pink nails dug cruelly, just enough not to break the skin, and the lady held on. His wolf senses alarmed, and picked up her words, “Stop showing out! When I get you home, you’ll learn to shut it when I say so.”
“Your baby was much younger than that. We should watch out for tricks. This is literally your mind playing tricks on you. And now the committee’s gone.”
“But what’s the point?” Lucius finished, looking devastated. His eyes fell on his wife, then Harry. “They can’t do this. What about the clause?”
Instead of waiting for him to offer his hand, she took it, pumping it gently. “Finally. What brings you here, Mr. Potter?”
Harry suppressed the cynicism rising in his gut. The absurdity of expressing anything he felt, died in an impossible wasteland in his mind. He wanted to laugh at the childish assumption that he could simply talk it all out. He felt better about things, but he wasn’t sure he could trust that entirely, now that Mr. Weasley brought the real world back into the cell. How can you explain hate to someone who only understood love? How can you explain revenge, to someone who was so quick to forgive? If he opened his mouth right then, they’d just be speaking different languages. There was no way he could make him understand the level of dysfunction he’d let himself sink to. And he really didn’t want someone as kind as him, to know what that was all about anyway. Just let whatever’s going to happen, happen, he wanted to tell him. Don’t contaminate yourself trying to save me. I’ll be fine.
He looked thoughtful. “The contract. He must’ve changed it. This place looks so familiar. We’re still inside his magic, just in a safer part of it. It’s so beautiful, I hope there’s nothing bad here.”
“Then you won’t be in attendance,” Lily informed him.
Draco’s body shook with the urge to chase what he wanted. But his resigned expression admitted that Harry was right. He turned pleading eyes on his child, and said, “Okay, okay. You’re so perfect. I want you to know that. There was nothing ever wrong with you. I didn’t reject you. I don’t hate you. I was scared. You don’t know what that’s like, because you live here with so much magic. You come and go as you please. You don’t have to fear anything. There, I’d have to restrict you. I’d have to be grown up, and punish you. I’d have to make you sad. Seeing doctors, getting shots, eating healthy and making you go to bed. I’d train you to feel helpless without meaning to. Lonely. If I don’t know how to deal with those things, how can I give anything of value to you? I’d train you to hate me, to blame adults for what bothers you, then you’d know how to blame yourself, and you’d never be free again. I didn’t want to subject you to that life, to my screw ups. To my depression. So I didn’t let you through.”
He took off in complete faith that his feet would find the right tent on time. By the time he saw it looming ahead, he realized he’d forgotten to pay Thella for her service to him. That was okay. She promised to come to the show. His magic bristled. He’d pay her then. His mother had sent the Voodoo lady to him. His mother, Lily, was whispering through her love even now, that something was going to happen and he’d have need of a young woman posing as the mother of all mothers. Mama Midnight.
He put his head in his hands and raked his hands through his hair. They were both growing tired of the, you-can’t-get-inside-the-photo-till-you-learn-love, but-you-can’t-learn-love-until-you-let-go-of-your-anger loop. But he couldn’t make himself leave, not when he was so close to someone who did understand the level of love that she was talking about.
“I guess we have to act like it. It’s your magic.”
“That’s not my problem.” He yelled Lucius’s name, making her twitch. Without knowing his way, instinct and anger swept him into the hall. She followed, her slippered feet danced to keep pace with him. Her satin, lilac robe fluttered.
To Harry it was clear. Draco wasn’t used to love. Not the kind that let him cry, anyway. His regained composure threatened to break again. But he answered, “If that’s what will shut my father up, let him have it.”
Harry still leaned over Draco, watching for signs of pain in his face. He kept having to fight down the temptation to stroke his arm. White patches were beginning to form there too, and he couldn’t risk it. When he heard the knock at the door, he didn’t bother turning around. They were just going to ask him to leave again and subject Draco to some other desperate act that wasn’t going to work. That’s why he’d refuse.
Jipsy had confirmed as much to him.
Draco, however, had no delusions about ever forcing himself to work that hard to impress or to keep up. In some circles, his genetics could open doors that Harry's compact six-pack never could. His looks were a Malfoy stamp, and it came without hard work and effort. He would not be made to feel guilty for that. Nor would he do push-ups. Mankind invented hard work. There was no such edict in the fucking Universe. And if Harry had a problem with his body, then Harry needed to stay the fuck off of him and find someone else to put up with the midnight mauling that sometimes came out of nowhere.
Like something he thought he’d buried long ago, black earth caved in on an empty grave. Secrets whispered that they were still alive and he had not killed them just because he was a different person now. He came from a powerful witch and she would always be a part of him. His mother. Her jars. His magic. Harry’s magic. Harry himself. It was magic denied its first appointment to live, and it would keep on coming back in the form of children who had not been allowed their births.
Judging by the outrage hardening in Lucius’s glare, the question did not compute.
Fear and excitement held Ash to his spot. He knew Foster was going to touch him before the wizard ever reached out. In that moment, they were already connected and Ash knew that Foster was about to hurt him. Really hurt him. If he thought he could’ve survived it, he would’ve bent Foster to him with all of his weight and used the last seconds of his life to prove that he was in it for love. He would make no move to defend himself. But he knew, while they appeared equal in stature, that’s where the resemblance stopped. If Foster had a lesson to teach, he was going to.
She slapped her hands with laughter. “I made you blush!”
Harry doesn’t seem to have this ability, and only expresses as a male now, even though he still carries the curse. In reality, both their wills and psychology affect the curse. Harry can’t face his body as compromised in that way, not even a little bit. So his powerful magic is causing him to resist the female changes. He’s constantly fighting it, without realizing it. But now that Draco appears to be adapting, Harry’s hysteria over the curse is calming down. And whether he knows it or not, his indulgence in Draco’s body has been his own therapy in accepting what he can’t change.
He let his head fall back and breathed easier. The tone of her note, along with windowless blue walls, gave him a feeling of isolation. He couldn’t be sure if this wasn’t a mental hospital, the most logical place for him to be. And if that was the case, Iece would be located elsewhere. Where was Draco? Why wasn’t Draco here to tell him that Iece was fine? A sudden flare of anger had him swallowing it. Draco had to stay with the baby, of course. Since he hadn’t actually been reliable, or helpful, or useful in any way. One of them had to take care of her.
As if practicing obedience, Ash watched the bones hover over the boy's body. As his eyes adjusted, other things came into view. The outline of a eye socket sparkled faintly where the old one had been destroyed. It was a grid, a blueprint. It glistened like blue quarts in all the areas where the body had suffered injury. Clusters of fine, pin-dots, burned bright blue and swarmed around the boy's head. They grew out of his crushed arm and shaped themselves into a forearm, wrist, hand and fingers. Ash also saw them through the rib puncture. They lit up the entire inside of the abdominal wall like blue fireflies swarming inside the cavity. The brighter they glowed, the darker Foster's hovering bones became, until it was clear that the sparks were drawing their power from the bones.
Shanti encouraged him, “Why don’t you try buying him a drink? His inner diva will have to give you props for that.”
That was never mentioned in court. Harry was certain of it. A lot had been going on, he couldn't keep up with every legal tangent, every loss, and every drama the trials unearthed, but he made sure they got his account of Snape right. Which he found on the bottom of the pile.
She gave him an appreciative smile. Her slender arms wrestled the stirring as she navigated them through a maze of police vehicles, out of the division, and back onto the street.
Lucius lifted his chin. In his offense, he was slow to find an adequate response to Draco’s betrayal.
Harry might as well have said, “I just wish she wasn’t so Malfoyish.”
. It was just one, out of a list of books, that Snape had left written orders to read before leaving the cottage. In fact, He and Draco found themselves redirected back onto the property with each attempt to leave while ignoring their required reading. It turns out, they couldn't apparate or floo the baby at all, until they'd found the spell that removed the safety feature which allowed them to do so, in one of the books. They hadn't known they needed charms to protect her. Not until they found them in the books. Even from the grave, it seemed, Snape was making sure they didn't skimp on their homework.
“This isn’t my normal office, but it’ll do. Many of my colleagues, and myself, have had to modify our work areas to better manage the, uh, chaotic disruption that you saw earlier. Please forgive any disarray.”
He looked to the horizon. This was his magic. The good, the ugly, the undefinable. He closed his eyes and summoned his dragon.
He'd jumped, flat-footed, over a stone wall and chased them down, wielding a stick that shot out like a riding crop and beat the head of the gang senseless before giving him up. There was energy in those concealed arms and hidden thighs, that told Ash to be patient.
Once settled on the train, Harry did a quick visual of seeing himself making light-hearted conversation, swapping anecdotes, and generally holding his own against what his fame had done to public perception. That's how he prepared his mind for the public pace of the next two weeks. People seemed to think that just because they knew
Hermione, who had never dyed her hair and barely wore make-up, decided that Ginny’s expertise was needed. Ginny considered the adult chemicals she risked on her own hair versus the feather tenderness of Iece’s baby scalp, and brought Luna Lovegood on board for a gentler perspective.
A/N:  Please review! :-)
That explanation left him feeling a bit overwhelmed. This was unknown territory. Nothing he had ever learned at Hogwarts even suggested this was possible. Even his dealings with Tom Riddle, wasn’t quite like this. She’s dead, how could she be looking and waiting for him? Was this dark magic?
“I promise, I will personally escort you back to your room and stay on the outside of the door, if you let me buy you a drink. You’re safe now. They got the dude. You don’t need to go back to a lonely hotel room, you need to hang out with friends and celebrate. Jason and I are going to this great underground place. A rave. You can forget everything in that energy. We’ll make sure you get back safe and sound. It’s a night out you deserve, and judging by that kiss, if you tell me you’re not interested, you’re a fucking liar and I know your man isn’t taking care of you. Just a drink. Some slams on the dance floor. Out by 2:00. If you go back to your room right now, you know you’re not going to sleep. You’re in too much pain to sleep. Thrash all this frustration away against some hot, angry bodies that can take it. A rave man, ever been to one?”
Narcissa grabbed Lucius lapel. “Darling, what if we can apparate alongside Vanilli? We should try it, at least. That may get Draco to a doctor faster.”
Lucius turned to Harry, leaving his back to James. “How dare you approach my wife in such a manner?”
Harry felt his soul fall one way, and his brain another. The two could not process what was happening. The room kept pulsing from light to shadow. Every time it went dark, Thella’s face became his father’s face. The light in her eyes, became his father’s identity. It didn’t mesh. They were two substances that refused to mix.
“But you just said…”  Didn’t she just say that she was more than a memory? Was the Eileen in the picture still living out her old life? Had her spirit moved on, or hadn’t it?
At the bar, he made no preamble about sinking onto the empty seat next to Greg, whose only response was a heavy and prophetic sigh. They both knew what Harry was there for and Harry wasn’t going to pretend he wasn’t. If Greg wanted to hold a grudge and sit here all night, that was perfectly fine. Harry just wanted to be able to say he made a gesture to fix things and that was that. He didn’t care if it worked or not. It was never a good idea to force friendship. Let people come to you when and if they ever got ready. Besides, he knew how hurt pride felt and he hated it when well-meaning people tried to rush him through it. It had to spend itself.
One tries not to listen.
Their closeness to each other fanned the intended flame. Harry was the first to act, blocking Draco’s path in an upstairs corridor. Their confusion, as they looked at one another, lit not only, a panel of wall screens in the basement, but screens in other homes and screens on other continents. It was imperative that the ritual take place and was fueled by the willpower of several thousand witches with a stake in those families, and that magic.
Reuse made him realize the bottom line. He wasn’t just attracted to Foster. He was attracted to power. It excited his sexuality and what was more powerful than a wizard as sublimely contained in his shroud of mystery, than Foster? That wizard had the power to heal. Ash was a doctor, how could he not like that? That wizard had practically raised the boy from the dead. If that wasn’t power, then what was? Hell yes, he’d signed up for this. His cock knew it, even if his logical brain was still scared of what it was doing. Bring on the fucking wizard.
They held each other’s stare until laughter crashed through Harry’s awkward confession. “Sorry. I’m not creepy, but I am a man. We think like that.”
She shook her head and took a step back. Her hands gripped themselves prayerfully in front of her chin.
“Hush, don’t you dare think this is something you can fix for him. You and he are joined in life now, and your magic knows what to do. It hasn’t let you down yet. This isn’t something he’s doing by himself. You’re both involved. You’re both problem-solving with your magic. Let it do the work, and don’t let the dragon upset you. Don’t wake him. I know you want answers, and I don’t really have any. But if he’s out, it’s because the magic wants him out. There’s no telling what he’s doing from his side of things. Don’t let his sleep fool you. He’s working very hard to make things right. If he wasn’t, your magic would not be feeding his dragon to keep that hole in the sky open. You’re doing this together. The energy between you two, is just trying to restore balance, like any storm. Now get him to a guest room and get him settled. Take Mr. Malfoy with you, and let their little elf do all the work. If anyone can get a doctor in here, it’s that little creature.”
Harry shrugged, keeping his suspicion to himself. “Give it another go.”
“Your time is up. I suggest you spend the precious few breaths you have, telling me everything I want to know. I will heal you just enough to let you talk. Your fate after that, depends on what I learn.”
“Where’s Harry?” he wondered aloud.
He was addicted to the excitement, but couldn’t separate it from the fear. So he had to deal with both. And whenever he passed the 42 St/Bryant subway sign, which advertised what that space could really be good for, his mind went there. For just a moment, he was pressed against the wall so hard, sandwiched between tiles and the chest of a man twice his size. Others stood in the shadows watching. To be really good, it had to be overpowering, or he’d run. In his best fantasies, the guy’s friends held him to the wall. He didn’t know how that would work, or if it was even possible, but it let him release all kinds of anger that couldn’t break through at any other time. He didn’t know from experience, but when someone was driving a dick, with 250 pounds of man-tork up your ass, you had every right to cry without having your fucking manhood questioned. Especially when it wasn’t your fault.
The fire-bullet pushed his head back. It was more than air and illusion. He staggered. A wave of pain dropped him to one knee.
Severus regarded his book. He closed it. “I will have to speak with him. I didn’t want to tell you in front of your parents or his, but your marriage contract itemizes the very ways in which your magic interprets betrayal to you. To it, he’s keeping so many important things from his husband. His dishonesty was first on the list. The contract is still intact because the sanctity of your marriage does not feel threatened. However, these are recorded as warnings, for you to correct. No doubt, the dragon is Draco’s warning against betrayal to his investments, equally.
"No. I'm going to keep her safe. But maybe a magical nanny is what we need."
Sighing, Harry tried again. "I was raped."
He tried to listen to the rest, but his mind wasn't having it. When Avi talked about convulsions and temporal illusions as his brain hemorrhaged, Harry felt his eyes well up. He could actually have a nightmare so bad that his body had a stroke? He risked being paralyzed or even crippled because he couldn't handle what was done to him and it was all catching up? Had the goblins stressed him out that much?
Source link for the beautiful curly-haired man, Israel Duffus:
“Id’ rather die than tell you.”
He had to strike before being struck. Just grab her and run. How Hermione’s front yard had become a battleground, he didn’t know. But Draco was out of the car, yelling at them all to put down their wands and tackling him to the ground.
“Not at all. I am ready to bring in my assistant now. I require the ring and the formation of those that were present when I arrived. That formula appears to have worked, we need not change it.”
Remus appeared to digest this far better than Sirius, who looked grief-stricken. Remus gripped his shoulder. “Don’t worry. She’s still in there. We can handle this.” He knew better than anyone.
Harry shoved him away. “I’m protecting her.”
He regarded her without answering, exchanging glances with Elan.
He stammered. “I’m just as much in shock as you. I didn’t know this could happen. Best case scenario, we get Draco out of there. Worst case scenario, we open our guest house to you and try to make you and your husband as comfortable as possible so that you don’t have to leave him.”
Harry looked at his wand. “He’s already been scanned. Just layers of charms. No curses.”
The taste of sugary lime lit up her face. Her tongue, pink and small, smacked for more. To him, the taste reminded him of daiquiri ice cream, and was as close to strange magic as a muggle kid like Dudley, was likely to come, in terms of food. It has always been heaven to him, the few times they’d snuck into the kitchen to try it. The first time had been a treat at Dud’s birthday party. The next few times were stolen contraband moments that Dud’s shared with him in the cupboard under the stairs. They were some of the rare times when his cousin actually shut himself in with him, and there on his bed, they gulped bubbling sherbet while the Dursley’s were sound asleep.
The man to Avi's right spoke up. "Minister, muggles were involved. This is their rescue. This matter cannot be quarantined within the wizarding community. You must step aside. The agency was put into place to handle these matters far more effectively."
He let that sink in.
Harry didn't fall for his poker face. "How 'bout it? Is my blood magic enough for you?"
“I know that now. When the conservatory called and said you’d been admitted, that you were under investigation for attacking that man, we hired our own detectives. They were talking about sending you away for life. We needed to know what happened. Our people scanned your flat, even after it was taped off. They reported traces of magic. Traces of blood. They were able to piece together a story that your mother and I found too unbearable to speak.”
“Remember what he said about ‘now,’ Harry reminded him. Are you going to focus on what people are thinking, or are you going to focus on what you want? This isn’t about anyone outside that door. This is about your happiness, and if you’re not happy with it, it ain’t happening.”
“If you step aside, we shall see what’s hurting him.”
“No elf is going to get to know my daughter better than I do. Not until she’s five. If it’s good enough for the Pope, it’s good enough for me. And between your mom and mine, I’m lucky I have as much time with her as I do.”
“How soon can we get started?”
Draco stood over him, reading his mind. "It'll probably turn black." It sounded like an apology. "By the time she's school age, it'll go dark. That's what usually happens when the parents are…different."
Greg slapped his back. “We caught the show. We didn’t know what the hell happened to you. That was badass! I have never seen a wizard rip some shit like that out of somebody’s mind. I heard they been looking for that guy for years. It’s all over the wizard news. When you put on a show, you fucking put on a show.”
“Then I will use magic to keep that nasty mouth shut. And he cannot undo my work!”
That’s right. His baby. Back to her. That’s what all of this was about, and not mentioning her, not speaking her name, was what felt so horrible. Let’s talk about her. We have to find out what’s going on.
He tried not to be aroused by this. He really tried. But this was real life restraint, sex, voyeurism, and it was perfectly legal. Ten men could do whatever they wanted to this beautiful young man, and the law was going to let them. By the time he saw water seep out of the corners of Harry’s distressed, and squeezed tightly closed eyes, he was practically coming in his pants. The boy’s lips were so red and so angry.
James scrambled back and Lily tried not to scowl at Lucius.
"No, she's perfectly healthy. She's just extremely sensitive to movement and vibration, you might say, at certain times. Rather like humans adapting to vampirism. Until the change is complete, they get migraines from the light. But after the final phase, some of them can travel in daylight just fine. I have to know that you can handle her needs. They might be unusual. Harry and I were told that her blood would introduce new magic, and that it's unpredictable. We're in the dark, and I have to know that if anything happens, you could accept her in spite of the uncertainty."
Harry stared up at the wayward stacks of columns that structured Gringott's entrance. He had put off returning here for over a year. No longer. Gobblins were the only people he knew who specialized in Equity Magic. Their meticulous records of bloodlines, contracts, and which treasures belonged to whom, made them expert detectives when it came to tracing and reading magic. Their culture sat on secrets of discernment that rivaled any seasoned auror. They were recognized as a persecuted race and their methods were protected by law. So Harry had to be there. He had to go inside, even though it was the last thing he wanted to do. After the incident with the dragon, with Griphook, the wards knew him there. They were customized to recognize him. He could still enter, but once he did, every employee and security guard would know it.
“I really liked your dragon. I’ve never seen anything like it.”
“There’s got to be safe, gentle dyes that are healthy to use. Natural.” He bet Snape could’ve come up with something.
Draco glared. He snapped out of his indecision and started unfastening his pants. “Are you going to be so fucking nice forever? Time for a shower, would’ve been considerate. Cleaning charms don’t relax the muscles. I’m doing this, Potter. But you don’t have to act like I’m that fragile. I am, but don’t throw it back in my face.”
But watching James with Harry, changed something inside of him over the years. His decision tore at him. It made him realize that raising a kid wasn’t about heroic feats and impossible sacrifices, or even getting anything right. Maybe those issues cropped up, but James taught him that the biggest, most important part of it, was just being there everyday. Waking up to the normalness and the seemingly mundane. You can’t put a price on stability. As painful as boredom was, it was the basis for all things worth appreciating. And the amazing thing was, children weren’t boring at all. The way James fawned over the most unrecognizable crayon drawing of Harry’s, helped Remus to realize that anything special to anyone, was so, because of all the non-special, ordinary things in the world. Diapers, crying babies, and all that stuff that scared most bachelors away, slowly took on quiet fascination. Waking up to your kid, going to sleep to your kid, and just allowing them to be, as you watched and cheered them on, didn’t seem so bad. James made it look wonderful. Remus would always have to work, to pay bills and be responsible, so he wasn’t afraid of that.
"The only survivors were the ones found in Harry's car," the Admiral was telling Avi. "The passenger chart shows that his cabin was private and that his car was supposed to be relatively empty. Only one other passenger booked that car and he never showed. You've seen the injuries. Are they consistent with Harry's?"
“Harry, I can’t see.” When he wiped his eyes, blood smeared the whole of his face.
Caught off guard, Lucius blinked excessively and stuttered. “I, I’m sure he can. If it’s at all possible. There’s no telling what this storm is going to--”
He took a moment to let this sink in. “I’ll leave you to think about it. I’ll return the minute I have any news I can give you.” He left, closing the door softly.
Harry followed, not sure if he should feel guilty for receiving special treatment or not. He told himself, it was because he might be able to shed more light into the investigation. It wasn't as if he was being pampered or anything.
She took off her wig, staring at her reflection in a hotel mirror. Polyjuice wore off, revealing her height to be five inches taller, her hair to be cropped and brown, and her body to be male. He, Tally, reached for a broom and suddenly he was airborne and flying over the path of a train. A familiar train. Though no one in the tent had ever seen the snake-like locomotion from the vantage point of looking down on it, everyone knew whose eyes they were seeing it through, and which train it was. Tally flew with others. Others who looked like Death Eaters but bore no tattoos. They streaked their black-smoked apparitions across the sky. They swarmed the rear of the train. No wands ever showed themselves, but rear wheels and chassis glowed red from a concentration of heat.
Harry waited. There appeared to be more.
A sniffle. “Thank you. Love you, back.”
He hadn’t called Harry an idiot out loud, but Harry heard it. His folly cost them another ten minutes of silence as Harry figured out which road to take. There was a tremendous amount of pride on the other side of that door, and apparently it could stare suicide in the face better than it could withstand the idea of a disease. Judging from the kicks on the door, he was now persuaded to think his husband was just the dramatic type, instead of the tragic type. But he couldn’t be sure.
New York City is wet and cold, but Harry promises hot coffee at his place.
Okay, he knew this language. There was no point pretending he didn’t. Dan’s slouched posture and open legged casualness, as one foot rested abutted on its side, against his lower thigh, demanded Tom look at his crotch. All the details were muted in the dark, yet that heated center drew his attention there.
“That’s just apocalyptic talk for waking up on the wrong side of the bed. You’re cranky, you’ve got good reason to be. It’s all in the interpretation. He calls it dark energy, I call it troubled magic. Trauma. It’s nothing I haven’t told you, which is why I made the amulet for you, which you’re not wearing.”
Close enough. “Where is he?”
The man’s face emerged into the light that illuminated the table.
“I assure you, Draco’s body is as natural and unspoiled as the day he was born. He came into the world with everything he needs. Why would I corrupt what is perfect? What I worked so hard to achieve, in terms of my magical obligations and my family?”
She looked at him. “Is that true? That’s perfectly fine.”

"They're open. I'm awake, Sweety." He inhaled her and pretended that her short arms wrapped around him as tightly as he held her. Through his paper-thin hospital gown, he felt her heartbeat flutter. Inwardly, he laughed because she didn't smell like a child. She smelled like Draco. She was full of clean, adult fragrances that hinted of how closely Draco kept her by his side. It was simply more convenient to bathe the both of them at the same time. As a result, Draco's excessive toiletries and tidiness contaminated her. He'd been meaning to talk to Draco about it, but right then he realized that it was an oddity that perfectly expressed how enveloped and protected she was. Even the black satin ribbons in her white hair matched the lining of Draco's lapel. She was happy and healthy, showing no signs of allergies, so he'd let the talk go for a while longer. Besides, if they were getting a house elf, Draco wouldn't have to multi-task like that anymore.
Rankar gave a sympathetic nod. “Then you should know that the spell will wear off in about twenty minutes. The sedative will take a while longer. If we can get your daughter back to her room, Harry may actually get to rest with her.”
Without turning, Foster let his words slide, soft as shadow and just as dark, into the room. “You are safer without knowing anything about me. I am repaying my host in kind. Take the hint.”
“You have to give him credit for trying.” Ginny poured, refilling all their glasses. There was something Draco had always found annoying about her hair, the way it slipped in fine, perfect sheets around an otherwise plain and neutral face. Right then, it spilled from her shoulders with more grace than her tom-boyish body held in its entirety. Harry had loved her hair, and Draco liked to think that it was only because his mother had had the same kind. But it was more than that.
He didn’t want to be presumptuous, but it couldn’t hurt to let Draco know that they’d connected on some level. While he didn’t know all the details of what was going on in Draco’s life, he knew anguish when he felt it. And Draco had too much.
“She’s got her own built in protection, and your family is all over it. You’re the one running around getting into trouble. You’re stirring up a lot of unfavorable conditions. Your ancestral love is its most effective when you stay at their level.”
He expected the vault to be a cave of dark, hollowed out bedrock, with a stack of magical trunks, of unfathomable depths. Instead, Jipsy showed him through the cave entrance into a stately ambiance of eighteenth century architecture and décor. For starters, the room swallowed them, making Harry think this is what it would look like if the Room of Requirement modeled itself into The Bowery in New York. He’d never been there, but he’d seen pictures. Those low lights, warm rafters and soft leather chairs were reminiscent of old English homes. However, this room was a bit brighter, had much higher ceilings to accommodate dripping chandeliers, and possessed more than a touch of female charm.
“I’m sorry for bringing it up. But surely you can draw a correlation. If that curse affected him on a chromosomal level, or even triggered a mutation, he could very well have passed the ability on to her.”
“Both, sir. And the blood. Or I would have told you already. All I can do is follow her and keep her safe.”
Part of Harry wanted them to understand that his magic meant no harm. He fully intended to let Draco leave tonight and have the freedom to decide if he wanted to be with him. But he remembered the dream-like vision he shared with Draco, and also suspected that this new development had its place. What if Mr. Malfoy was right? What if he let them take Draco out of here, and there were repercussions to doing so? Drawbacks that ruined his chances forever. None of them knew what they were dealing with. Maybe he could talk her into not upsetting the balance. At least not until they knew what the hell was going on. He couldn’t just let her take Draco out of there.
Snape rushed the bed, grabbing him. “Why didn’t you tell me this earlier?”
“I’m not a fucking helpless victim. My father didn’t hurt me, he got me to see that I wasn’t a monster. He accepted my body. That was the only way he could prove it to me.”
“Before or after we tell her about the secret service men following her?”
"Oh, my god. Why don't you two just get married? If Harry signed a Parental Measure establishing you as a primary parent, the law would have to recognize three parental interests, not two."
“He was losing his mind. Maybe we did it to shut him up. He was a fool by the end. We all were. I suppose he was waiting to get his family to safety before trying to unravel the curse. All he had to do was revoke his magic. It couldn’t collapsed the curse. But maybe even he wasn’t sure of what to do even after Voldemort was dead. Draco was too adapted to the curse. I’m sure, with all that he was facing, he dared not even try.”
Foster send Ash to hell. On another planet.
When it flapped its wings, clouds stirred away. Like all patroni, it traveled on a spiral of cast energy. The fact that it started so high in the sky, spoke of the layers Draco was using to reach as far beyond himself as he could, and to harness as much of the raw materials the elements made available to him. He wasn’t just casting a patronis, he was opening a portal. And the fact that he was doing it alone, without the typical help of a coven, or at least a partner, made it all the more aggressive and shocking.
Draco’s mouth twitched. It was slack, and Harry wanted to think that amusement found its way to him at the deepest levels of sleep. That beautiful mouth. One day, it was going to happen. He’d know what it felt like. For now, he inhaled the starch of Draco’s pajamas and let that be enough. This was closer than he’d been last night. It was something.
He apparated back to his parent’s home to wrestle the cure and counter spells from Collin and Morell.
Ron stood with his parents on the other side of the sofa. At least three red-headed brothers Draco was less acquainted with, a woman he'd never seen before, and that thing they called Ginny, all looked appalled at his intrusion. But the mention of his name had them biting their tongue and hoping for an introduction.
like. You know the content can’t be tailored to make every reader happy, so you stick with what was done well, knowing full well that the writer has no control over your personal qualms. You often write yourself, so you just want the author to know you’re cheering them on. You’re the appreciation Tom shows for having shared those years with Dan. He’s thankful for everyone in the cast, but he wears a special pair of glasses to signal the feelings he will always hold for one famous wizard, and the actor who played him. This is Drarry spilling over into real life.
“Severus Snape!” Petunia stood, jaw dropping. “I haven’t seen you since you and Lily used to run off and leave me stuck playing barbies and pogo sticks all by myself. You stole my sister’s affection and now there you stand looking smarter than all the blokes she turned down.”
There was no point in telling them that Harry had absorbed the power of the Elder Wand.
For Draco’s sake, Harry didn’t respond.
“Your people want you back pretty badly. I don’t know if they’ve made up the charges or what, but your best course of action would be to come clean about your identity and get a lawyer. They’re going to take you back, either way. If you cooperate, the Governor may be able to help you legitimize your citizenship at a later date.”
He untangled himself from her. More cousins, a great uncle, two great aunts. He dodged them all and made it across the hall to the french doors where rain beat like bullets. It never dawned on him that guests would try to follow. He wrestled the doors open against the wind, sending torrents of watery gusts into the house. He couldn’t close them. People were blown back and drenched with spray from winds that were in excess of thirty miles per hour. That was the kind of wind that took sides off of houses. Harry held onto the knob, braced his footing, and charged out into the storm.
“Draco doesn’t feel well, Mom. I’m trying to talk him into taking a room upstairs, but I think he wants to go home with his family.”
“You think?”
Just for fun, I’m posting the original FB post below, along with the gif I used that day on February 29, 2020. It feels like two years ago. But beware, it has spoilers.
Delirious laughter spilled out of Draco. “Spontaneous memory. My fucking father, I don’t want to deal with it.”
Avi stepped up to him, while his assistants hung back. "It's up to me to assess if my patient is stable enough to be interviewed. It is up to the aurors waiting outside, to get his statements. And it is up to you to stay out of our way and let us do our jobs."
Her fleshy arms trapped him, and he did her the courtesy of not complaining or pulling away as she hugged him. Harry cringed, but was impressed with Draco’s patience, as this opened the door to more of his relatives slapping Draco on the back and pulling him in.
“Exactly. You’ve made it past one barrier. Now you have to make it past another. Your mind is inside the picture, but you’re not of the picture world and the stuff you’re made of, knows it. These realities are supposed to be separate for a good reason. This world can’t sustain your life, and your world can’t sustain ours. Therefore, you’re naturally prevented from merging with us. If you want to find Severus, as he is in your lifetime, you’ll need my help before you can enter his portrait.”
