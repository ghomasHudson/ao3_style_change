“Oh, so it’s like a graduation gift?” Harry asked with a frown. “What happens if I die before I gain access to the vault?”
In the end, he decided to give her the same version of events that he had given to Ginny. He also went on to tell Luna about the pressure Ginny’s family was putting on them both to get back together and live out the fairy tale ending everyone imagined for them before given a brief summary of the conversation he had had with the distraught redhead.
Harry sighed and sat down beside Remus. If there was one person he could trust with this knowledge it was Remy. He was too worried about Ron or Hermione accidentally telling someone so he let them believe he and Pansy had been lovers. Draco was Pansy’s business.
Harry rolled his eyes back. “I have to write to Remus anyway.” He walked over to the small desk in the corner of the living room and took a pen, an envelope and some paper, ignoring his aunt’s outraged gasp and his uncle’s blustering. Then he went into the kitchen to sit at the kitchen table to write his letter.
Harry watched as the Prince practically glided down the hill, everyone spread out from him, allowing him to move gracefully at his own pace. He demanded attention with his presence, and damn if Harry wasn’t going to give him some. Draco raised an eyebrow at Harry, noticing his stare.
Luna appeared next to their side and pointed off into the distance, Harry could see through the trees a giant dark grey castle just before the sky met the land. It was close, and Harry could feel the anxiety rolling off of Draco in waves. Harry took a breath and reached his hand out to Draco’s. The blonde flinched, and looked at Harry with wide eyes. Harry ran his fingers across the Prince’s knuckles and gripped lightly. He wanted to comfort Draco, no matter what. Although the Prince could be a royal asshat, he didn’t deserve this. Nobody deserved this.
“Thank you for saving me, I’m sorry this happened to you.” Harry whispered to her. She sobbed as Ron rubbed a particularly sensitive spot on her back. He whispered an apology and continued. “What did they do to her?” He asked Ron. Ron motioned for him to come over, so Harry scooted to where Ron was sitting.
“Would you believe me if I said I was tired?” She laughed again. Both Harry and Ron nodded. Harry watched and she turned her body into Ron’s embrace. She closed her eyes as she laid her head on Ron's chest, and wrapped her arms around his waist. Harry began to feel uncomfortable, as if he were intruding.
“Your story, of course.” She told him, with a tone that made him feel stupid. Like he missed something. He sighed deeply.
“He waited until my room with me while I changed,” Luna shrugged. Harry immediately felt like he was in hot water with her admission. Draco turned to look at him, and Harry cowered under his gaze.
“That was Draco Malfoy, Prince Draco Malfoy.” Hermione whispered. “He’s vile, and cruel, and his last servant committed suicide just two weeks after she was assigned to him. He loves no one, he’s never even shown interest in the princesses who visit. The only people he shows any sort of love or care for, are his parents. Every scar I have, Ron has, any of the other servants? They’re all from him. He’s a sadistic bastard, and I fear for any servant who has to care for him.”
His voice was different, it was an order but it wasn’t cold. It wasn’t void of emotion like his other orders could be, he was intrigued. Harry went to speak but Draco held up a hand.
Ron and Harry cleaned the table, while Hermione left with the Queen to organize an outfit for an outing with her sister. While Harry gathered up the plates, Ron gathered the silverware and wiped down the table.
Harry stood up and turned around, “Ah!” He gasped when he almost bumped into the annoyingly curious boy. He placed a hand over his heart and glared up at the boy. “If you would please move, Malfoy is waiting on me. I would rather not lose my head, thank you.”
Yes, I made Hedwig a horse! I know that Hedwig is a white owl but I really wanted Harry to bond with a black horse. I don't know how long it'll be before the next chapter, hopefully not another month, but a month at most. I love reading and replying your comments! They make me so happy ^^
Harry hadn’t noticed that the royals had gone quiet. Harry flicked his eyes up to their faces and blushed when he realized he’d been caught staring. Draco glared at him through squinting eyes, and Astoria seemed flustered.
Harry woke up in his room. He couldn’t remember falling asleep. He blinked slowly, vision coming to him in waves, and then a splitting pain forced its way into his head from the smallest crevices of his brain. He groaned. Luna rushed to his bedside. Hermione and Ron were with her, standing in the background.
The redhead turned to look at the girl, who nodded at him. Harry watched their silent communication and realized they knew each other, which meant the red-head must be a servant too. The redhead grabbed Harry’s arm and dragged him out of the room as Miss Granger’s shirt was ripped open.
“Leave us!” King Malfoy shouted. Harry jumped at his booming voice, and left the room with Hermione and Ron. As soon as they were outside the door, Harry let loose.
Harry nodded. “You know, I’ve always wondered about that. I mean, I’ve always known you two were friends and I always wondered why, if he was such a fanatic about blood purity, he would be friends with you.
“Right now isn’t a good time, Hermione. You see-” Harry was starting to get annoyed with Hermione. Ron was being unusually quite, just sitting there red-faced and letting Hermione do all the talking.
“Yes.” Harry hesitated for a moment and then shrugged. “Given her parents, Vi could very well end up being sorted into Slytherin. I mean, not only is Pansy in Slytherin, but Slytherin was the Sorting Hat’s first choice for me. I’ve noticed that Slytherins with Slytherin parents seem to…I don’t know, have an easier time I guess. In being a Slytherin I mean.
Pansy closed her eyes. “My parents cursed me. It is a subtle curse. I-I only have a few months left. I was lucky. Because of the way the curse works it didn’t affect Vi. But it’s gone too far. There’s nothing anyone can do now. I-” Pansy took another deep breath. “I only have a few months left. I might just barely make it to the beginning of summer break.”
Harry pulled back and blushed. He had actually not thought about how he was going to explain the situation to Remus. He cleared his throat. “Uh, I’m fine, Remus. You see…” Harry shifted from foot to foot.
Harry looked at her for a moment and then stood with Violet still in his arms. He walked around the bed and put Violet into Draco’s arms. “Here, Draco.  Get to know your goddaughter.”
“Not the way someone who has been her friend since childhood can,” Harry snapped. “Look, I’m sorry, but unless Pansy or Draco disagrees, Draco is going to be Violet’s godfather.”
When Harry returned to the suite, he frowned. He could hear Pansy and Draco arguing in furious whispers. Harry couldn’t make out what they were saying, but it was definitely an argument. Harry followed the sound to Pansy’s open bedroom door. As soon as Harry came into view, the two Slytherins stopped arguing.
“You really have thought about this quite a lot,” Severus said thoughtfully. “You have known less than twenty-four hours that you have a daughter and you have thought through all of that.” He shook his head. “You would have done well in Slytherin.”
One of the last things Harry took care of was the letter he had written for Draco to be delivered in case Harry died and Voldemort won the war. After that, he had Thornspur notarize letters he wanted delivered to the Ministry and the newspapers if he died but his side won the war. These letters made it clear that Harry considered both Severus Snape and the Malfoy family spies for the light side and his allies; he also called for them to be recognized as war heroes.
Harry took a deep breath. Hermione was right about one thing. He might as well get this over with now. “Ginny, could we talk?”
Harry sat down on the bed next to Pansy and put an arm around her shoulders. “I know just what you mean,” he whispered. “I was raised by muggle relatives who hate magic.”
Petunia’s head jerked around so fast Harry half expected her to fall over. “What? Who-? How dare you!”
“Well, Professor, I invited Ginny to the wedding, but we were running a little late and then her zipper got stuck, so…” Harry shrugged. He looked up and noticed that Draco still looked like he was ready to hex someone. He focused on the stubborn zipper again. “Ginny, you did finish your make-up and stuff, right?”
Harry was sitting on the floor between the sofa and the coffee table holding Vi in his lap, feeding her a bottle and reading from an open book on the coffee table when Draco came in.
Harry just held her and let her cry. When she finally stopped, Harry looked down to see that she had fallen asleep. He looked down at Vi and saw she was asleep too. He smiled and settled more comfortably on the sofa, letting his mind drift. He thought of what to tell Luna and how to help fix things between her and Ginny.
“If you continue to make us stand on your doorstep, I may decide to provide our audience with enough fuel for gossip for several years,” Snape said smoothly, reaching into his coat and pulling out his wand.
“I hadn’t,” Harry said with a grimace. “I did tell Remus and Pansy that I didn’t know how long I would be gone, but I didn’t expect to be gone quite this long.”
Pansy and Draco glared at each other for a moment before Pansy turned to Violet’s bed. “That would actually be great, Harry.” Pansy picked Violet up and handed her to Harry.
“Draco, you are holding my daughter, who is going to be your goddaughter. I think we’ve earned the right to call each other by our first names,” Harry said. “And am I sure about what?”
Draco just sat there and stared at Harry for a long time. A soft gurgle from the child in his arms finally drew his attention away from the Gryffindor pressed up against him. “Well,” he said softly to Violet, “at least your father doesn’t snore.” Draco settled himself more comfortably, slipping some pillows under Violet to support her weight so that his arm wouldn’t get tired.
“Actually, if you don’t mind, I would like to write the letter to Remus,” Harry said. “If you could make sure he gets it quickly?”
Harry shifted on the sofa and kept his head down as he continued. “When I was about eight or nine, there was a family that lived on Privet Drive. They had a teenaged daughter and she got pregnant. It was all Aunt Petunia could talk about for months.
Draco’s breath rushed out of him and he froze, trying not to move a single muscle as he looked at the top of Harry’s head. When Harry sighed and pushed closer to Draco, Draco thought his heart would beat out of his chest, but Harry only sighed again and stopped moving. After several long moments, Draco closed his eyes and breathed a soft sigh of relief when it seemed Harry was not going to wake.
Harry grinned. “Well yeah. Though Pansy and I agree that we want to do as much ourselves as we can, we are obviously going to need help.”
in the other. Draco told himself he had no right to feel anything but anger on his best friend’s behalf. He was furious with himself when he couldn’t stop himself from asking, “Do you still love her?”
Harry, Ron and Hermione turned to see Ginny standing next to them with her hands on her hips, frowning.
After dropping Ginny off at the Tower and then hunting down and talking to Luna, Harry headed back to the suite.
Pansy glared at him. “You are still not smiling.” Harry gave a little laugh and Vi’s eyes moved to him. “See?” Pansy asked.
“I know I’m still pretty young,” Harry said, “and I know that I’ve only been a father for a couple days, but…I always thought that’s how fathers
Remus and Harry were laughing when the door opened. Pansy came in with Violet in her arms and Draco walked in behind her. Both Slytherins stopped when they saw Remus. Harry and Remus stood.
Pansy started to cry softly. “I know. But…I just…I wanted a family. Someone who would love me,” she said softly. “My parents…they treat me like a possession, a commodity. I didn’t have the decency to be a boy so the only way I can be useful to them is by marrying into a pureblood wizard family with money and status…money and status that they would get a part of by marrying me off.”
Severus lifted an eyebrow at Harry. “You did say you were certain about marrying Miss Parkinson, did you not?”
The conversation was ended when Ginny started snuggling up to Harry. Harry sighed. “I can’t let her return to Gryffindor Tower alone like this. Is Pansy…?”
Tears fell from Pansy’s eyes, but she managed to keep from sobbing again. “It’s-we-we have a little girl,” she said giving Harry her own attempt at a smile.
“My parents didn’t even know I was pregnant at the time, but fortunately the way the spell works kept it from harming my baby,” Pansy said.
“Mrs. Weasley is a wonderful woman and she does have a lot of experience with children,” Harry said carefully, “but I don’t think Pansy would be very comfortable with her watching Vi. Pansy has met Remus when he taught here before and while the Slytherins gave him a hard time, they did acknowledge that he was a fair professor.”
Harry ran a hand over Vi’s hair, just as he had before he had left, and said, “Do you think Pansy would mind missing a couple more weeks of class?”
“Well,” Dumbledore said. “I believe I do have a suite available that will meet your needs. I will just write-”
Dumbledore’s bushy white brows rose. “Remus? I must admit I had thought you would want Molly’s help. I had been in the middle of writing the letter asking her-”
Harry wearily walked up the stairs to Gryffindor Tower. He was feeling emotionally drained after the shock of finding out about Violet and then dealing with the anger and disgust he felt over what Pansy had done.
“I’m willing to do whatever it takes to keep my daughter safe, even if that means letting people think Pansy and I were secretly lovers and even if it means marrying someone I don’t love. And, again this will probably sound cold, but it’s only going to last for a few months.”
After a good hour’s work in the library, Pansy was joined by a couple other Slytherin girls. They talked and worked on their essays together though Pansy was careful to avoid any discussion about her illness. A couple of hours passed and Pansy began to feel tired again. It took her ten minutes to get away without having to invite the other girls back to her private room and her feet dragged as she walked down the hall.
Harry shook his head again as he stepped into the suite after giving the password. The slight smile he had been wearing slipped right off his face and he stopped abruptly as he caught sight of the sofa.
As soon as Harry had Vi in the living room, Pansy’s door shut behind him and he felt a silencing charm go up. He looked down at Violet, who was blinking sleepily up at him, and said, “I wonder if your mother is telling your godfather about us. Her and me, I mean.” Harry smiled at his daughter. “Draco already knows about you. And,” Harry looked to the closed bedroom door and dropped his voice to a whisper, “I think he’s already fallen in love with you too. But let’s not tell anyone, hmm? He’s a Malfoy.” Harry opened his eyes comically wide and then he smiled when his daughter responded with a gurgle.
Ginny shook her head angrily. “Yes, Ron, I had a crush on him when I was younger, but I was never really in love with him. I mean, yes, I’ve come to love him, but not like a boyfriend. I think of him like a brother. And I really wish everyone would stop trying to force us to be together! We aren’t interested in each other, we never will be and I’m sick of people pushing us together! It’s not going to happen!”
By the time she reached the suite all she wanted was to lay down in bed. But when she walked in she stopped and stared.
Harry and Severus arrived in Little Whinging at the edge of a park between some tall shrubs and the side of a building. Severus put the glove into his pocket and stepped out into the park. Harry followed.
“Hmm, what about-” Draco broke off and looked over at Harry. Harry had fallen asleep while Draco had been distracted. Even as Draco watched Harry slowly slid sideways until his head landed on Draco’s shoulder. Draco was certain his heart stopped and he held his breath. Harry shoved his book off his lap and it fell to the floor with a muted thump. Harry rubbed his cheek against Draco’s shoulder and gave a soft sigh of contentment.
He was so tired. He just wanted to sleep. Only, when he walked into his dorm room and approached his bed, he suddenly remembered. He stared at his bed, feeling the disgust and rage building up. His face felt hot and his breathing sped up as his rage grew.
Walking down the empty corridor, Harry thought over his conversation with the Ravenclaw girl. He had never seen Luna so…
The Gryffindors were surprised to be allowed to see Draco Malfoy so vulnerable, but they supposed news that your best friend since childhood was dying would be hard on anyone. Ron and Hermione walked over and stood next to Harry.
Ginny quickly wiped away a tear. “Harry…Harry, I-I cheated on you the entire time we were together,” Ginny said in a small voice.
Harry winced again. “Okay, well, this is where the not-telling-anyone part becomes especially important. I, uh, sort of…got Pansy pregnant,” Harry said with a blush.
Harry couldn’t help but notice that bewildered was a cute look for him. He nearly fell off the bed in shock when he caught himself thinking that.
“Asleep,” Draco said. He face was emotionless as he said, “Madam Pomfrey said she could expect to have periods of lethargy and need a lot of rest.”
Harry glared. “Headmaster, I appreciate that you are trying to help and I know this may seem ungrateful, but…I would appreciate it if you didn’t make any choices concerning Violet. Any choices that need to be made that affect Vi will be made by me and Pansy.”
Because Hermione and Ron were not talking to him, Harry hadn’t shown them to his suite yet. He got lonely in the evenings and he found himself in Snape’s office of all places.
Ginny laid her head on Harry’s shoulder. “She wasn’t even angry or anything, Harry. She was hurt and sad and…” Ginny broke off and started crying silently.
Pansy started to reach for Vi when she had a sudden thought. She quickly and quietly went to her room and searched through her things. Soon she found what she was looking for and she returned to the living room. Seeing that no one had moved while she searched her room, Pansy quickly raised the camera and took a few pictures. She was glad the wizard camera didn’t require a flash as she’d seen on a muggle camera she saw once.
Harry blinked. “You mean that Lucius Malfoy is already on our side? That he’s been helping you all of these years?” Harry rolled his eyes when he saw that Snape seemed surprised that he had caught on so quickly. “It wasn’t that hard to figure out when we were talking about him before you went off on this tangent.”
“What, are you going to make me promise?” Harry asked, teasing, remembering the promises she had exacted from him and Draco the night before.
“If you’d just wait outside, I’ll be out in a minute,” Harry said, still trying to get Ginny’s zipper to cooperate.
Harry rolled his eyes. “Fine. Let me translate it into Slytherin terms. You, and your parents if you can convince them, will be reluctantly accepted by our side because you can be useful.”
“Well, Potter. Have you had so many affairs that you have trouble remembering them all?” Snape drawled.
Harry sighed. It was weird how easy it was to talk to Draco about this. Maybe it was the stressful day he had had or maybe it was the way Draco had stopped with the sneers and insults (mostly) after finding out about Vi. “Because it was expected of us. Everyone just assumed we would get together. Even now, a lot of people think we are going to get back together, get married, have kids and be together forever.” Harry grimaced. “Especially her family.”
When he and Snape finally made it to the lobby of the bank, Harry followed Snape when the man walked to a shadowy corner of the lobby.
“Pansy, you gave me a daughter. And, like you, I know just how precious a gift that is,” Harry said, stroking his daughter’s cheek again. “We may have had our differences in the past, but…if the only thing I can do for you is to help free you from your parents, I’m going to do it.”
Soon the room was in chaos. Someone rushed off to get McGonagall and Harry sighed as he heard the voices in the common room chatting excitedly. His housemates were probably going to spend half the night talking about this.
“I just…you’re a really powerful wizard, you know? Everyone at school knows that you and Draco are the most powerful wizards in the school,” Pansy said.
Harry nodded. “You see…Ron and Hermione are mad at me because they think I cheated on you. They want me to admit to you what I did and I guess they want me to suffer whatever punishment you see fit to inflict on me.”
Snape frowned at him, but changed the subject. “The Headmaster also told me you extended an invitation to the Malfoys to join the Order. He felt it was somewhat…unfair of you when you have no authority to do so.”
“Oh,” Pansy looked at her ring with new appreciation. Using a muggle symbol meant that their classmates wouldn’t find out about them. At least right away. Someone was bound to eventually find out. “Well, when a witch gets engaged she wears her hair up. She uses the clip the wizard gives her when he proposed or the engagement contract was signed. The clip has a symbol of the wizard’s family on it, announcing to everyone not only that the witch is engaged, but also who she is going to be marrying.
Harry frowned and started to ask what they were waiting for when a goblin came up to Snape and said, “Mr. Snape? This way.”
Harry hurried after him. It didn’t take Harry long at all to figure out that they were heading for the dungeons. Soon they arrived at Snape’s office. Harry followed the older man in and turned and watched as he warded the door.
Harry quickly shook his head. “No. Actually, they don’t know I’m gay. I haven’t told that many people yet.” Harry frowned. “How come you and Luna aren’t together openly? I wouldn‘t think either of you would care what others think.”
She nodded and then looked down at their baby. “You are probably the only person I would trust to keep that promise, Harry.”
Harry nodded. “And she said they have some kind of guardianship over her and the only way she can be free of them is to get married. So…” Harry shrugged uncomfortably. “It was the only thing she wanted and I could give her that. She gave me Violet and…I figure I could do that for her.”
Harry saw the look of fear and misery that flashed across the blond’s face. “You know,” Harry said, “you’re always welcome on our side.”
I will work on my other stories too. It's just between some RL stuff and my uncooperative muse, I haven't been able to focus on updating my stories. Though I do have seven chapters done of yet another story. However, I have too many WIPs posted already so I'm not posting that story until I have finished it.
Rumors were going around school about Pansy’s illness and the attack on Harry, but no one connected the two in any way. It was a small blessing in Harry’s opinion. Usually gossips would love to make up some connection to make the story even better.
Hermione gave Harry an apologetic look and Ron looked sheepish. They both walked over to Harry’s side of the bed and looked at Violet too.
Two hours later, Pansy was surprised to wake from her nap and walk into the living room and see Harry and Draco sitting next to each other with their heads together. After watching for a minute, Pansy grabbed her books from her room, wrote a quick note and snuck past them, checking on Vi on her way out. Both Harry and Draco were so focused on their discussion they never noticed her leave.
A chill ran up Harry’s spine. “You’re family? She told me what happened to her kingdom. Why wasn’t her family here?” Luna was quiet behind them, Harry didn’t dare check on her. He figured she was ignoring them, and when her speckled grey horse glided past them down the hill he got his answer. He and Draco were left alone behind her.
“What'd you trip over a log yesterday or something?” Harry chuckled, halfway out the door. Draco looked back at him, an empty look in his eyes.
“Right, okay. I see how it is. I suppose you’re right Potter, we’re not on the same level, perhaps we never will be. I’m a Prince, and you’re a slave. We should act as such, so as to not confuse the common folk.” Draco walked ahead of him. Harry’s heart dropped into his stomach, that’s not what he’d meant. He didn’t want things to return to the way they were before.
“You’re so lucky. M’lady rarely ever leaves and I love traveling,” Hermione swooned as they landed on the next floor. “I will go over what is expected of you as a servant when outside of castle grounds, and Luna will act as your guide and friend while at the Parkinson’s. Prince Malfoy will be left to woo, and you two will be left to whatever it is you’ll do.”
“Ron! Shut up! You do realize these walls are rather thin? How do you think King Lucius would take it, hearing you talk about him that way?” Hermione hissed. Harry glanced between the two of them.
Draco remained silent, and Harry turned around to look at him. The blonde wasn’t anywhere in the room. Harry furrowed his brows and grabbed the folded clothes and tucked them into the bag. He looked around, and walked out of the room. He carried the satchel out to the bag strung to the horse, where Luna was packing other things like blankets. The sky was pink with the sun beginning to set, it was getting cold.
“I don’t have to explain myself to you. I wanted to leave them, as I don’t want to be involved with everything dating a woman entails. I came out here to relax, so if you’re going to pressure me to tell you more, I’d have to ask you to leave me here. I’ll walk with Potter. Go de-stress somewhere else Luna.” Draco ordered her. She stood in front of him for only a moment, before glancing over her shoulder at Harry. He said nothing to her, and she sniffed.
Harry pulled out his wand and set his bed on fire. There was no way he was ever going to sleep in that bed again. He stood there and watched it burn, feeling a fierce satisfaction as the flames spread. The heat and smoke drove him back a few steps and he started to cough on the smoke.
Harry rubbed her shoulder soothingly and murmured nonsense words, waiting for Ginny to calm down a bit. Finally, she sat up a bit and wiped her eyes. “Ginny, let me talk to Luna. I can explain some things to her. I’m sure she’ll understand.”
He apologized to Pansy for not asking her opinion, but she seemed too relieved that he had chosen someone other than Mrs. Weasley to mind. Since she and Draco couldn’t come up with anyone else anyway, it was agreed that Remus would be a suitable babysitter especially when Harry assured them that Remus had somewhere to go on the nights of the full moon.
Apparently, the person at the door took that as permission to enter. The door swung open and Draco came in. “Potter, are you ready yet?” Draco stopped as he caught sight of Ginny, half dressed. “What the hell is going on in here?” he asked coldly.
Severus rolled his eyes at the response. “I believe I told you that you could not do so without your guardians signing the necessary paperwork?”
When Draco glared at him, Harry said, “The person Ginny was seeing broke up with her. Apparently, rumors started that Ginny and I were getting back together and when she came to the wedding people thought the two of us had gone off somewhere to ‘make-up.’ Since Ginny promised not to tell anyone about the wedding she couldn’t say where she had really been and since I was the only one who knew she was seeing…who she was seeing, she came to talk to me.”
Pansy didn’t answer. She looked down at her daughter and lifted her free hand to push her hair behind her ear.
baby. “I can’t say I’m sorry either, Pansy. I could never regret her,” he said softly, stroking a finger down Violet’s cheek.
Draco gave a little shrug and then sat up. He held Vi with one arm and reached up to run a hand through his hair. He suddenly glared at Harry as he realized the state he was in. Harry ignored the glare and settled down onto the sofa beside him.
Pansy and Ginny both looked uncertain, but Snape reached out and gently pulled Ginny’s hand towards Pansy until Pansy could see the matching gold band in the box for Harry. Harry’s band was thicker and lacked the pansies etched on Pansy’s ring, making it much more masculine. Pansy took the ring out of the box and slipped it onto the finger Harry held out for her.
Thornspur didn’t even blink at the news that Harry had a daughter. He merely began taking notes. “Your daughter’s name?”
finally. Not only to be his daughter’s godfather, something that still stunned Draco, but Harry was also spending most of his free time with Draco.
Draco kept his face expressionless as he watched Harry take Violet. His heart clenched as he saw the awe and love on the Gryffindor’s face. Harry’s touch was reverent as he stroked a finger down the little girl’s cheek.
“Perfect. Do you think you could run up and grab it and meet me out in the corridor without anyone seeing it?” Harry asked.
“I’ve always wanted a family of my own. Even when I was too little to really be thinking about that kind of thing, I would think about what kind of father I would be, about all of the things I would do for my children and how much I would care for them.”
her boyfriend. They did everything they could to keep the two of them apart. When they found out that she was pregnant, they sent her away and refused to tell her boyfriend where she was. The last I heard before they moved away was that they had sent her away to some school and the child’s father never found his baby.
Harry bit his lip to hold in the swear words on the tip of his tongue. Remus was right. Until the ceremony, there
Harry moaned and removed his hand from over his eyes. Ginny had her back to him and she was holding her dress up with one hand and her hair with the other. Harry fumbled with the zipper for a while and then said, “Here, let’s move over here to the light.”
“Oh! That’s right,” Hermione said. “I told…oh my god! Ginny!” The others looked at her in confusion as she suddenly glared fiercely at Harry. “Harry, does Ginny know about this?!”
“Harry? Why haven’t they suggested that Violet isn’t yours or something? I mean, they seemed to have accepted this pretty easily considering,” she whispered. “And aren’t they a bit shocked that their gay friend has a baby with a girl?”
The Headmaster raised his wand and performed a short spell. As he did, a blue light appeared and connected Parkinson with the baby in her arms. A red light appeared and connected Harry to the baby, which was now surrounded by a light purple aura.
“You can use Remus’ room,” Harry said, pointing to the middle room. “I’d let you use mine, but I’ll need to change when I get back.”
“Harry, you are marrying the girl because she’s dying. I can see to you agreeing to make Dra-what the hell?
Harry blushed and cleared his throat. He leaned over and whispered into Pansy’s ear, “They must know that the Headmaster or Madam Pomfrey would have used the paternity spell. And they don’t know I’m gay. I hadn’t told anyone until last night.”
Back in Snape’s office, Harry stumbled and would have fallen on his face if Snape hadn’t reached out and grabbed his arm.
“Well, let’s hope she doesn’t get my nose,” Pansy said, leaning over to look at her baby’s face. “My baby pictures look fine, but as I grew…” Pansy shrugged.
Harry looked at the older man in shock. First a compliment and now a joke?! “Are you feeling okay, Professor?”
Harry looked up at Draco in surprise at the quiet question. It had almost been a demand. Harry rubbed Ginny shoulder and answered honestly. “Yes.” Seeing Draco tense up, Harry shook his head and continued, “But I’m not
“Sure. I just need to go to Gryffindor Tower at some point to ask Ron and Hermione to come to the wedding. When’s Draco coming by?”
“I really don’t know what to do, Albus,” McGonagall said. “I don’t like to think that Harry is not safe in Gryffindor Tower, but this attack was far too close for comfort.”
“Severus, you need to go to the Parkinson’s house and get that book. I also need you to start looking into a way to prevent something like this from happening again,” Dumbledore said.
Harry sighed again. “Ron, I have every intention of surviving this bloody war.” He gave Pansy a sad, apologetic look. “And I think that Violet deserves to have someone around who can talk to her about her mother.”
“Uh, no actually. They don’t know about this yet. They were upset that I decided that Draco would be Violet’s godfather,” Harry said.
Snape snorted. “I was not joking, Potter. With you, it is a legitimate concern.” With that the man turned and left the room.
“That’s because it’s not part of the tradition, Hermione,” Ron said grudgingly, “it’s just a superstition that some families have. Only the parents and the chosen godparent are supposed to hold the baby before the ceremony. The only exception is usually the person who delivers the baby.”
“Promise me, Po-Harry. Promise me, Harry,” Pansy said, turning to him. “Promise me you’ll take care of Vi. Promise me you’ll keep her safe and love her. You have to kill that bastard and you have to survive this stupid war so you can take care of our daughter.”
“It will still be yours to bequeath as you will, which is why I listed it among your assets for this appointment,” Thornspur said.
Draco looked at her, a look of agony on his face. For a long moment, he just looked at her. And then he dropped his eyes to the little bundle in her arms.
After a bit, she finally started to calm down. When she lifted her head, Harry gently moved a hand over the baby’s hair. “So, did we have a boy or a girl?” he asked with a slight smile.
Ginny’s eyes went wide. “You-?” Harry nodded. “Is that why Ron and Hermione are so angry? Did you cheat on me with some guy?”
In his bedroom, Harry hurried to get ready. He was upset with Ron and Hermione. It was pretty sad when his ex-girlfriend, who thought he was marrying a girl he had gotten pregnant while he was going out with her, was being more supportive than his two best friends.
The first night he talked to Snape about the plans for the ceremony and for the wedding. When Harry left, Snape made a comment about having to stay up to finish grading essays so the next night Harry took his homework down to the Potions Master’s office. It was strangely peaceful. Harry got the feeling he wasn’t the only one who enjoyed the companionable silence. He turned up in Snape’s office every night after that with his homework.
and I'm still not completely happy with it. Somethings are being mentioned way too soon, but I'll just have to adjust my timeline because I'm not writing this chapter one more time! In any case, I hope you like it.
He had no idea how they had ended up like this, but he needed to get away before Harry woke. Moving slowly, Draco eased away from Harry, torn between freaking out over the situation and regretting that he could not stay and just enjoy  the feel of Harry sleeping in his arms.
“If I die, it will mean that Voldemort has probably won. In that case, if anyone can do it, then I’m sure the Malfoys will be able to hide the fact that Violet is my daughter. I’m sure it would occur to them to suggest that she is
Harry walked over and stood where is was told. He looked over at Parkinson and noticed she refused to look at him. He turned back to the Headmaster and the Potions professor.
Draco was interrupted by the entrance of Hermione and Ron. The two Gryffindors entered quietly and looked uncomfortable. They didn’t come very far into the room.
Harry shifted Vi, taking care to keep the bottle in her mouth and reached out to turn a page in the textbook on the coffee table. Hearing another frustrated sigh come from across the table, Harry looked up just in time to see Draco run a hand through his hair and glare at the book in front of him.
The next week was more of the same. Pansy watched Violet while Draco and Harry had class and took a nap when they arrived after their classes. After her nap she usually went to the library to work on homework and sometimes talk with the other Slytherin girls while Harry and Draco watched Vi. She usually returned to find Harry and Draco working on homework together or playing with Vi.
Harry had the sudden impulse to hug the man. Snape narrowed his eyes at Harry as if he could see the thought cross Harry’s mind. Harry was relieved when the impulse died. The shock of the past week must really be getting to him.
“And why ever would he do that?” Draco sneered. “It’s not like you could take care of Vi if anything happened-”
Snape nodded when Harry trailed off. “Also, I spoke with Lucius. We discussed the arrangements for the ceremony. He wants to speak with you after the ceremony before he makes a decision on the matter you asked me to speak with him about.”
“Pansy. We have a daughter together. And I think it would be a really bad idea for people to find out about the spell you used, especially if the Headmaster and Snape are so worried about it. That means we are going to have to let a lot of people think we were together at some point-at the very least as lovers,” Harry said.
Harry gave a little laugh. “Sorry. It didn’t occur to me that wizards probably have different customs. In muggle society, when a man asks a woman to marry him he gives her a diamond ring. It’s her engagement ring. When they get married, during the ceremony they put gold bands on each other’s left ring finger to symbolize their marriage. How does it work in the wizarding world?”
Harry took both of Pansy’s hands in one of his and reached out towards Ginny. She quickly opened the box and held it out to Harry. Harry reached in and pulled out a band of gold. It was delicate and feminine and had pansies etched around the band. He slipped the ring onto Pansy’s left ring finger.
“Ah, Harry, Severus,” Dumbledore greeted them. “Severus, if you could close and ward the door behind you?”
“You’ve met the Dark Lord and survived each time. Whether that was luck or power or whatever…I wanted my baby to have it. I-I knew my baby wouldn’t be safe in a world run by the Dark Lord. I never wanted anything to do with him.”
Pansy sat up straight and held her head up proudly. “Yes, Granger, he did.” She held out her hand and smiled. “Isn’t it beautiful?”
“No, she’s in the library. She said she slept quite well last night so she took a shorter nap than usual.”
Dumbledore had sent Remus out on one last assignment. Since Remus couldn’t touch Vi until after the ceremony naming Draco her godfather, there wasn’t much he could do to help Pansy and Harry at the moment and he was an important member of the Order. He would be back in time for the ceremony.
Snape was gone several minutes. Harry started wandering around looking at things. He was trying to read the faded title of a book on the corner of Snape’s desk when he heard the door open. He looked up and just stared.
Ginny gasped and blushed. Draco sneered. “You are marrying Pansy in just a few moments, Potter. You-”
“Well,” Harry said, “I guess that means it should be a little easier to convince them to join our side.”
“I’ve never heard about that and I’ve read up on the ceremony quite a bit,” Hermione said suspiciously.
The Headmaster had made an announcement about Pansy’s illness and Harry’s attack and told the other students that they would both be getting private rooms. There was very little complaining since everyone knew that the situations must be extremely serious for the Headmaster to take that action.
Draco and Harry were a tangle of arms and legs and it looked like Harry was lying half on top of Draco with his face pressed against Draco’s neck. Draco had his arms wrapped around Harry and it looked like he was not going to let go of Harry for anything.
Ginny blinked at the non sequitur. “Um, yes. After the Yule Ball, Mum made sure I brought one with me to school.”
Pansy shook her head. “I couldn’t go to a doctor or my parents would find out so I didn’t know if I was having a boy or a girl.”
That may have something to do with the fact that Draco was often in his suite and with his daughter, but even when Vi was sleeping Harry didn’t hurry him from the suite. He didn’t seem to mind that Draco was almost always around. And he never hesitated to press close or come up to Draco.
Harry followed as the goblin led Snape to a private room. When the three of them were inside the room and the door shut and warded, the goblin said, “Mr. Potter?”
“What is going on in here?” Madam Pomfrey asked, keeping her voice low. She took in the scene in one glance. Harry was sitting on the bed with Pansy and Draco while Ron and Hermione stood at the end of the bed glaring at their friend. “That’s it! Miss Granger, Mr. Weasley, you will not be allowed in this room again! You will have to wait until I’ve released Miss Parkinson and her child to see the child again.”
“What am I talking about?! I’ll tell you what I’m talking about! You only broke up with Ginny six months ago!” At Harry’s blank look, Hermione said, “Harry James Potter! It takes
“You know I never wanted to support that madman. Can you really give your loyalty to a man who would murder my baby?”
Dumbledore nodded. “Very well, Harry.” He frowned when he saw Harry yawn. “Why don’t you let me have Fawkes take you to your room? I will have the elves deliver your things by morning. Miss Parkinson and her child will be staying in the infirmary for the next week and then they will join you in the suite. By that time, I believe that Remus should be here.”
Harry slipped out of his outer robes and laid them over the back of the chair in front of Snape’s desk. Snape held out a ragged glove and Harry winced. He hated portkeys.
Harry and Ginny shuffled over to the light by Harry’s bed. A few minutes later there was a knock on Harry’s bedroom door.
Harry stepped into the Gryffindor common room and was grateful for the good weather that had most of the students outside. He saw Hermione and Ron sitting on a sofa and hurried over.
Dumbledore nodded. “I will get Harry settled in tonight. Why don’t you return to Gryffindor Tower and calm the students?”
Harry rolled his eyes. “I have plenty of experience in not telling the Headmaster things. Whatever you tell me, he won’t learn from me.”
Pansy took a deep breath. “I had never intended for you to know about-about Violet. I had thought you would hate me for it and try to take her from me. That’s why I refused to tell the Headmaster and Madam Pomfrey who was the father at first. But when Madam Pomfrey checked me over after I delivered Vi…she found something.”
He fixed his sight on the Leaky Cauldron and forced his body forwards. His mind floated off a little, escaping the pain in the only way he knew how. His body, despite the numerous injuries, had it's orders and, save passing out again, would follow through with them. He entered the tavern and, forcing himself back into his body, barely managed to speak the right words as he disappeared into green flames.
Harry gave her a small smile. “A couple of reasons I guess. It made me feel a little less guilty. I mean, I cared for you, but I wasn’t in love with you and you didn’t deserve me leading you on. It didn’t take me long to figure out we weren’t going to work out, Ginny. I probably knew even before we ever got together. Seeing you with someone else, someone you really love…it freed me to break up with you. I don’t think I was the only one relieved when it was over either.”
“Right,” Ginny said and then shook her head. “I’ll just-I just-…Right, so. I can see why you would agree to him being the godfather. You’re giving her peace of mind. Letting her know that we Gryffindors won’t corrupt her baby.” Ginny gave Harry a weak grin.
“But you’re seventeen, right?” Harry asked in confusion. “I thought wizards and witches were considered adults at seventeen.”
Harry sighed. “Ron, mate, you’re still going to be a part of Vi’s life. You are still going to be her Uncle Ron and Hermione is still going to be her Aunt Hermione.”
Harry nodded. When Remus just continued to stare at him blankly he cleared his throat again. “Uh, she had, um, my baby,” he mumbled.
Snape inclined his head. “Unless you were just talking when you said you would go against the Headmaster himself if the need arose?”
“If you can’t be quite, you won’t be allowed back in,” Harry said fiercely. The argument ended immediately. “Now, Pansy and I have not yet had a chance to talk about who we are going to name Violet’s godfather or godmother. I’m not sure about Pansy, but it is something I’ve thought about.” Harry took a deep breath. “And I think there’s really only one choice. I’m fairly sure Pansy will agree with me.”
Harry walked back into the living room with the sealed envelope in his pocket. He saw his aunt standing with her arms folded across her chest, glaring at Snape. Vernon looked suspicious.
“Because she had your baby. Harry, you are both only going to be miserable if you marry without loving each other,” Ginny said.
Remus walked over and leaned down to look at the little girl. “She’s as adorable as Harry said.” He noticed that Pansy and Draco both seemed tense, but he made no move to touch the baby. He was a pureblood and familiar with the superstition. He turned to Draco. “Harry was telling me you are going to be her godfather. Congratulations.”
“The only thing I really want now is to be free of my parents. I guess I’ll get that wish in a few months, though,” Pansy said.
Harry looked up with a smile. “Yeah, that’s the impression I got. Listen, could you watch Vi while I run to Gryffindor Tower to get Ron and Hermione?”
It was the Headmaster who answered. “No, Harry, I’m afraid not. I am familiar with this spell from the first war with Voldemort.”
Harry shrugged and turned back to his textbook. Several minutes passed, silent except for Draco’s sighs. Violet fell asleep and Harry carefully stood and put her in her bassinet set to one side of the living room. When he returned to the coffee table, he sat beside Draco rather than across from him.
Draco pushed down the turbulent emotions that had welled up within him at the sight of Harry holding Vi in one arm and
Harry looked at her a moment and then turned to the Headmaster. “Headmaster? Can I have a lemon drop?”
Harry gaped as Pansy Parkinson was revealed. She looked awful. She was sweaty and obviously exhausted. She was also…holding a baby.
“It is a muggle term,” Snape interrupted. “In a muggle wedding the man that stands up for the groom is the best man and the woman that stands for the bride is the maid or matron of honor.”
Dumbledore waved his wand over their joined hands and a golden halo briefly surrounded their hands before seeming to be absorbed into their wedding bands. “I now pronounce you man and wife. You may,” Dumbledore coughed. “You may kiss the bride.”
Snape smirked. “I take it that the Headmaster has led you to believe that I have only been spying since your mother’s death?”
Harry nodded. “When she brought Vi to me last night the first time she woke I noticed Pansy was exhausted. I figure since she gets to spend all day with Vi that she wouldn’t mind if I kept her in my room all night. Pansy could use the sleep and I could spend a little more time with Vi.”
Harry felt Pansy tense next to him. She started picking at the blanket. He looked up. Hermione had joined the ‘discussion’ on who would be named Vi’s godparent.
“Now, you are certain that this means that boy will no longer have to come back here?” Vernon asked.
Suddenly, Pansy reached out and grabbed Draco’s arm. “Draco. Draco, I want you to do something for me.”
Harry was halfheartedly casting spells at the targets in the room where he and Snape trained when the Potions Master found him. Harry and the others had been kicked out of the infirmary after promising to tell no one about Pansy or Violet so that the two could rest.
He went to his classes, but he ate his meals in the infirmary with Pansy and Draco. They talked a lot about the plans for the ceremony where Draco would be named Violet’s godfather. Harry told them about the suite and Remus’ impending arrival.
Harry handed the black box to Ginny and whispered, “Hold this for me? Just open it and hold it out when I reach for it, okay?”
Harry glared and shrugged. “I tried to tell you, but you both refused to listen to anything I had to say. You were too busy giving me the cold shoulder to come to my wedding so I had it without you.”
“So what can you two tell me about this ceremony to name a child’s godparent?” Harry asked. “I was raised by muggles so I’ve never heard of it before.”
Harry shook his head. “No. I’ll do it if it comes down to that. Nothing is more important to me than family.” Harry frowned. “And my muggle relatives don’t count.” He shook his head. “What does that have to do with convincing Lucius Malfoy to join our side, though?”
Snape turned and both his brows lifted as he caught sight of the damaged and the decimated targets at the far end of the room. He turned back to Harry.
“She would definitely make Pansy uncomfortable. Pansy only has a few months to be a mother. She doesn’t need someone coming in and trying to take that from her. Not that Mrs. Weasley would do it on purpose, but I know she wouldn’t be able to help herself from mothering Violet.
Without looking away from them, Pansy picked her camera up off the coffee table and snapped picture after picture. She paused for a moment as the moved, but they only settled more comfortably together-which involved what looked suspiciously like a great deal of snuggling. She snapped several more pictures before smiling and leaving them like that.
“And have you thought of what would happen if you didn’t manage to survive this war?” Severus asked quietly.
Ginny just stared at him for a long moment. Then she blinked. “Oh! So is that the ‘illness’ that the Headmaster was talking about?”
Draco knew plenty about family expectations. His parents didn’t even know he was gay. For as long as Draco could remember, he had known he was expected to marry Pansy. He never felt he had a choice in the matter and saw no reason to tell his family of his preference. It’s not like it would have changed anything.
Harry sighed and nodded. “And several things actually. If I’m still alive, my friends will be around my daughter because they will be around me. By making Draco Violet’s godfather he knows he will always have a place in her life. Also, I thought that knowing that might make it easier for him to switch sides. I thought it would make it clear to him that I was serious in my offer of welcoming him on my side in this war.”
There was still some tension between them, but more and more Pansy saw the looks Draco was giving Harry. Soon she was certain the tension, on Draco’s part at least, was not just a continuation of the rivalry Harry had insisted on setting aside.
Both had forgotten that the Headmaster was still in the room. They never noticed how he watched them with sad eyes and a sorrowful smile. They jumped at the sound of his voice. “Miss Parkinson, I believe you may want to tell him the rest,” Dumbledore said softly.
“Pansy,” Harry said, “given our situation, it is difficult to find vows that suit us. I can only speak honestly. I told you I had no regrets and I meant it. You have given me a beautiful daughter and I appreciate her for the priceless treasure that she is. No words can adequately describe how grateful I am for her. The best I can do is to promise to protect you and to take care of you for whatever time we have left and to always love and care for our daughter.” Harry took a deep breath and looked at Pansy steadily. “And that I promise, Pansy.”
Harry sat between Ginny and Neville at dinner. Ron and Hermione sat across from him, but said nothing to him during the meal. Ginny kept up a steady stream of chatter, going out of her way to try to make Harry laugh. Harry managed to relax, even with Ron and Hermione’s silent presence sitting across from him.
Snape raised an eyebrow. Harry just shrugged again. Snape rolled his eyes and said, “Go look anyway.”
“Do you honestly think the Dark Lord will stop to give you a chance to catch your breath, Potter?” Snape drawled mockingly.
Draco glared at his best friend and then rolled his eyes and looked down at the girl he held. “Your mother likes giving orders.”
McGonagall frowned. “But Albus, you know other students will be upset. The Slytherins especially will argue that you are showing him special treatment.”
“It seems, Severus, that Miss Parkinson has managed to hide the fact that she is-was pregnant,” Dumbledore said.
Harry nodded. “Do you think you could watch Vi for me for a while? I want to take Ginny back to the Tower and then I need to talk to someone.”
“Okay, so what’s this about?” Harry asked. With everything that was going on, Harry figured it could be any number of things. He just hoped that there wasn’t some new problem that he was going to have to deal with.
“Yeah, I’m fine,” Harry rasped. His throat was a little scratchy and his eyes were watering, but he was fine.
Ginny gave him a sad smile. “No. I was cheating on you from the first. I have no right to be upset about something like that.”
“Harry, we saw Ginny in tears after she talked with you! And after that she hasn’t been in the common room unless she’s going to her dorm room to go to sleep! We are getting worried about her and I think since you are the one who upset her you should try to-” Hermione said.
, I want it clear that I want Draco Malfoy to be my daughter’s godfather and I want the ceremony to take place without any delays.”
Pansy continued. “Well, apparently my parents decided if I wasn’t not going to be a good little piece of property,” she said bitterly, “then I was of no use to them.”
“It’s hidden in my room at my house. No one else knows about it. It was covered in dust and I don’t think it had been opened for years, probably decades, before I opened it,” Parkinson said.
“Can I hold her, Parkinson?” Hermione asked. She and Ron had gotten much closer when they had noticed that the baby was awake, though Ron was still hanging back a bit.
“Petunia? Who was at the door?” Vernon asked when Petunia walked into the living room. He stood and went red in the face as he saw Harry and Snape follow his wife into the room.
Harry frowned. “Not in a letter. I didn’t want the wrong person to find out. I just told him I needed him here and that the Headmaster agreed it would be best if he returned as soon as possible.”
, she had your baby, and you two are getting married. And despite that, you are telling me you are gay. What else is there?”
An annoyed look came to Harry’s face. “Well, I was trying to tell them, but they wouldn’t listen to anything I had to say until I had talked to you. When I kept trying to tell them, they walked away.”
“I thought my baby deserved to be with her father,” Pansy said, drawing everyone’s attention to the bundle in her arms.
Pansy smiled. “I don’t mind.” She looked back down at Violet, but her eyes kept straying to her ring. She sniffled and Harry put his arm around her shoulders again.
A few minutes passed in silence as the parents returned to watching their child sleep. Draco felt his eyes continuously being drawn back to the scene on the bed. Hermione was staring at Violet like she was studying or maybe inspecting her, but that was just Hermione. Ron was getting a little bored.
The next morning Harry, Pansy and Remus ate breakfast together at the table in the kitchen. Violet sat in a baby carrier on one end of the table. Halfway through breakfast Remus received a summons from the Headmaster and Fawkes took him to the Headmaster’s office.
Harry and Severus were briefly treated to the horse-faced woman’s attempt at a charming smile before she caught sight of Harry.
In some ways, Draco resented it. He hated the implication that what had been between him and Harry was so easy to set aside, to forget. On the other hand, he loved the easy way Harry acted around him now. And some small, stupid part of him loved the implication that Harry was choosing him over
Harry snorted. “Great. One of the few rare moments where I’m uninjured and I get to spend it in the infirmary anyway.”
Hermione and Ron’s eyes went wide and Ron’s mouth opened and closed, making him look like a fish. “You cheated on Harry? Why?” Ron asked, bewildered. “You’ve been in love with him for forever!”
Draco frowned. He shouldn’t ask, but again he couldn’t stop himself. “Then why did you date her for so long?”
“Yes,” Harry said without hesitation, despite the sudden tension he had felt from his friends. “I told you yesterday. I’ve actually put a lot of thought into this. It isn’t just a whim, Draco.”
“I had planned to talk to them today after our visit to Gringotts.” Snape raised an eyebrow and leaned back in his chair. “Have you considered the details of the letter you intend for Draco to receive in the event of your death and Voldemort’s victory?”
“You like what you see?” Draco asked him, smirking through his breath. Harry took one last sweep of the room with his eyes, and shrugged.
“Prince Malfoy, it’s Hermione, I carry a message from the Queen. If you would please open the door, I would like to discuss with you the details of the information I’ve brought.” Hermione bellowed.
Once everything was placed, he walked back out into Draco’s room in search of a bucket and rag. When he didn’t see one in sight he walked out into the hall, aware of the eyes on his back. He walked to a hall closet, and grabbed a bucket and rag, perhaps they refilled themselves magically, because the bucket was full. He looked around at the small closet for anything else he could use to clean, and when he found none, he shut the door.
“He’s more of a rescue really. My father let me keep him, he’s a rather good dog. How’s your pet, still a mangy bitch?”
“Is there anything I can help you with?” The girl shoved a bunch of potatoes into his arms and he scrambled to hold them all.
He was woken from his trance by her hand sliding over the back of his. His hand had stilled on the knife. He took a deep breath and the pang in his chest began to subside, he looked down at her and smiled. He moved his hand out from underneath her hand and continued chopping the rest of his potatoes.
The other three occupants in the room just watched the whispered exchange in disbelief. Draco glared out the window while Ron and Hermione looked uncomfortable. Ron cleared his throat.
Draco frowned and he unconsciously stroked a finger down Violet’s cheek as he considered the problem. It was the only issue left to be resolved for the ceremony to take place. Since the Headmaster knew of the situation, Draco supposed they could ask him, but Draco hated the thought of letting the old man in on the plans for such an important event. The suite Harry and Pansy were sharing was too small for the ceremony.
Harry went to the bathroom and washed his face and used his hands to drink some water from the sink. He was feeling much better by the time he heard McGonagall’s voice. Sighing again, he left the bathroom.
Pansy’s eyes widened just a bit and her mouth briefly made an ‘o’ of surprise. Then she blinked, frowned and whispered, “Well, I’m telling you now, if they have a problem with gay people they are
She also started thinking about just how good the two looked together when they were with Violet. As much as Pansy was going to miss her little girl, she felt a weight lift when she saw how well Harry and Draco worked together to take care of Vi. She could tell Harry would not let anyone keep Draco from her daughter’s life and she knew Harry would do anything for Violet.
“We were studying together. She just went up to get a book. You can talk to her when she comes back down.”
In the two and a half weeks since Violet was born, Harry had been surprisingly quick to throw away years of hostility. And it was more than just for Pansy and Violet’s sake. He wasn’t reluctant or resentful. It was as if he simply shrugged his shoulders and set aside the past.
“Don’t be, Gin. If I hadn’t seen you and Luna kissing, I might still be in denial about being gay myself.”
Harry nodded when Pansy trailed off and walked over and sat beside her on the bed, much as he had the night before.
Snape shook his head. “That’s because Lupin is from a line of pureblood wizards that have never had even the suggestion of Dark Arts about them. Albus’ prejudices have more to do with a family’s history of using Dark Arts. Lucius was under suspicion from Albus from his first day here because his grandfather was known to spout that pureblood nonsense the Dark Lord is famous for and the man was suspected of delving deeply into the Dark Arts though he was never convicted.”
“Besides, if I asked her for help now it would be difficult to set boundaries later. If I let Mrs. Weasley come in and help she’s going to think she has the job for life. I might be young to be a father, but I
“You’ll have to wait until after the ceremony, Granger, since you aren’t the one that was chosen for her godparent,” Draco said.
act. They should do anything they can for their children. Having Draco be Vi’s godfather means she will have someone around to tell her about her mother and to teach her how to be a Slytherin if that’s what she wants or needs.”
Harry shook his head. “Don’t worry about it. I’ll talk to Ginny and if she can forgive me, then those two won’t have a reason to stay angry with me.” Suddenly, he grinned.
“She heard about me disappearing yesterday with you for hours and when I couldn’t tell her what we were doing, she thought I was getting back together with you. You were right, Harry. I should have told my family sooner. Luna thinks I’m a-ashamed of her!” Ginny broke down in tears again, though she pressed her face to Harry’s shoulder to muffle her sobs.
Even before Draco finished Harry was shaking his head. “I’ll be fine. Besides I have to read the chapter for Charms.” He pulled out his textbook and set it in his lap. Instead of opening the book, Harry looked back down at Violet and stroked her hair. “Your parents will be here in a few days for the ceremony. I’m still not sure where we should have the ceremony. The dungeons are too cold and damp. Even with magic, I don’t want to risk Violet getting sick. Same problem with having the ceremony outside since the ceremony takes place at dawn. And obviously it will have to take place somewhere no one will notice or accidentally stumble upon…” Harry trailed off as he yawned again.
“My brother’s an idiot,” Ginny said as they came to a stop in front of a painting of a garden with a veiled woman sitting on a bench in one corner. Ginny only caught a glimpse of the empty living room as Harry dragged her to a bedroom.
“I have a difficult time believing that, given our history, you would suggest that I am not only quite intelligent, but also extremely powerful, much less that you would suggest I am somehow either Albus’ or the Dark Lord’s equal,” Snape said.
“I thought I’d take Vi for a while. Let you two talk freely for a bit,” Harry suggested with a shrug.
Harry grinned at the Slytherins over Ginny’s shoulder. “Yeah. Hey, Gin, you mind being my best woman?”
Harry turned back to Vi, who was still awake and looking around. Mostly she seemed to look back and forth between Harry and Draco. Harry smiled at the little girl. Pansy poked Draco in the shoulder.
“Potter, what is going on here?” Snape asked. Harry could swear there was a thread of amusement running through the man’s voice.
“If there is some advantage to having a Slytherin around when you are growing up for Slytherin students, I want to make sure that Vi has that advantage. She might not end up in Slytherin, but being a Gryffindor is pretty easy. It rather comes naturally.” Harry shrugged.
“Well, Minerva. I fear the only solution is to give Harry a private room. He will have to keep the location a secret, obviously,” Dumbledore said, “but I shouldn’t think that will be a problem for him.”
Snape ignored Harry and led the way to the infirmary. It did not escape Harry’s notice that he took a route that insured they would remain unseen.
Harry shrugged again. “I freaked out a little bit. I’m certainly never going to be able to sleep again without performing a full check of my bedroom and my bed.” Harry shuddered in disgust. “I was pretty angry for a while as you can see, but then I thought about it and I can’t really think of anything worse than slowly dying and knowing it was your parents who were the ones who killed you.”
Snape ignored his thanks and walked into the living room. The Headmaster, Remus and Pansy were waiting for them. Remus had on new dress robes and Pansy was holding Violet. Pansy was dressed in a lovely silky green dress with silver and emerald earrings. It was a nice contrast with Ginny’s vibrant red hair and pretty gold dress.
Harry wondered if the Snape he had come to know was the Snape the Slytherins knew. It would explain a lot.
“When it’s all over, I want you to be there, Draco. I want you to be there for my daughter,” Pansy said.
Draco gave a silent sigh and let go of his annoyance. How could he remain angry when Harry was stroking Violet’s hair and looking at her with that light in his eyes that always made Draco’s heart ache. It was filled with such love and that touch of awe…a familiar need blossomed in Draco’s chest. He wanted Harry to look at him with even a fraction of the warmth in his eyes when he looked at Vi.
A thoughtful look came to Harry’s face. “Actually, you’re probably more powerful. They are decades older than you and have had much, much more time to study various aspects of magic. Not to mention they never spent the time on Potions that you have…” Harry trailed off.
Pansy headed straight for the library to work on an essay for Transfiguration. She didn’t really care about her grades, it’s not like she was going to graduate in any case, but she was tired of being cooped up. As much as she loved her daughter and Draco and as nice as Harry had been, she was feeling confined and could use sometime to wander around freely.
The next day was Saturday. After breakfast, Harry went to the infirmary to see Pansy and Violet. Pansy was still in the private room and Madam Pomfrey quickly ushered him into the room before leaving to give them privacy.
“Well, until the ceremony naming you Vi’s godfather, no one else can touch her. However, all three of us have class. We can’t switch off. Someone would notice. I thought Pansy had the best excuse to miss class. You could bring her her classwork and you and I could watch Vi after classes and during the weekends to give Pansy a chance to rest.” Harry shrugged. It was the only thing he could think of to solve the dilemma.
Draco Malfoy was lying on the sofa, rumpled and fast asleep, with Harry’s sleeping little girl lying on his chest. Harry’s breath caught at the sight of Draco’s messy hair, his missing outer robes and his bare feet. Harry stared for a moment as he took in the fact that Draco wasn’t even wearing socks then he jerked his eyes up to Draco’s face. The blond’s face was so relaxed in sleep. And the way he held little Vi against his chest…!
Dumbledore nodded. “Of course,” he said solemnly. “I had been trying to think of what to do while the two of you are in class. The fewer people that know about this the better. Obviously, other students or any of the professors are not an option as they would be missed. Madam Pomfrey needs to be available to the students, so she would also not be available.”
Harry tried to give her a reassuring smile. “Sorry.” He ran a hand through his hair, trying to think of what to say to her. Finally he sighed. “Look, Ginny. I’m about to tell you something you can’t tell anyone else. Before I say anything, I need you to swear you won’t tell anyone.”
Harry continued to dodge hexes and curses and tried to use his wand to perform spells of his own. Suddenly, the training halted as Fawkes, the Headmaster’s phoenix, appeared. The bird dropped a note into Snape’s hand and then disappeared as quickly as he had appeared.
Pansy smiled and blinked back tears. She covered her mouth and muffled her teary laugh as Harry and Draco continued to trade quips while trying to change Violet’s diaper.
“After everything that’s happened they really did that?” Ginny asked breathlessly. She and Harry were nearly running.
Satisfied, Pansy sat the camera on the coffee table and then leaned down and picked up Vi. Draco frowned and moved his arm as if searching for the little girl in his sleep, but a few soft words from Pansy seemed to settle him. Pansy smiled and took Violet to her room and laid the little girl on her bed. After a quick diaper change and a bottle, she settled Vi down in the bassinet in her room.
Harry nodded. “We will be keeping Violet with us,” Harry said firmly. His stomach churned as he waited for the Headmaster’s reply.
Of course, now that there was no real malice behind their sniping at one another they found they both went further in their…teasing. To outsiders, it looked like things had suddenly gotten much, much worse between them after the lesson in which Harry saw Snape’s memories. At one point, even Dumbledore had sat them down to talk about their interactions with each other. Snape had been surprised when he noticed Harry was just as amused as he was by the lecture they received.
“Yes, Granger. Of everything that’s wrong with this picture, worry about Pansy’s jewelry,” Draco sneered.
Neville rushed to open the windows. He had just opened the last one when the other boys came into the room.
No the problem was that tomorrow was Monday and the first day Pansy was supposed to go back to class. With Harry and Draco also needing to attend their classes, what were they going to do about Vi during the day? It would be noticed if they switched off and no one else could help or Remus wouldn’t have left.
Snape sat down across from Harry as usual. He looked at the younger man and lifted an eyebrow. “I would never have expected you to accept this situation so easily, Potter. Certainly, I never expected to return to have the Headmaster ask me to help plan a wedding between you and Miss Parkinson.”
“Yes.” The goblins shuffled papers for a minute before picking one up and reading it. “It was set up by your mother, Lily Potter. You gain access to the vault upon completion of your education at Hogwarts, barring a few exceptions.”
“Um, he’s telling the truth, Professor,” Parkinson said in a small voice. “The baby is his, but, ah, we never…we never had sex.”
Draco moved forward until he was standing next to the bed next to Pansy. He leaned closer and looked at the baby. After swallowing a few times, he said, “Hey, little Vi.”
Harry stared at the old man. While he could understand why Snape, as her Head of House, would need to know this he had no idea what he was doing there. Surely the poor girl deserved better than to have a guy she hates see her like that.
Harry suppressed the semi-hysterical urge to laugh at the shock on the faces of the pureblood students. He gave Pansy’s hands a reassuring squeeze and leaned in. She hesitated for a moment and then lifted her chin and held still. Harry pressed his lips to Pansy’s in a short, chaste kiss. Pansy was blushing when he pulled back.
“No, no! I’m not insulting you. Ah, haha. You’ve taken the words from me,” Harry laughed. Draco’s frown dropped from his face and a look of shock appeared as what Harry had said sunk in. Harry blushed, and cleared his throat.
Harry walked up the hill slowly, thinking about everything that had happened. After everything Hermione and Ron had told him they made this castle seem like an awful place to live, but after talking with Luna, she chose to come here, she thought it was the safest route. He was at a crossroads, not the one back to the palace, but figuratively. Who was he supposed to believe in this situation? He just met all of them, he had no right to judge them just yet but that meant he also couldn't tell which one was telling the truth. Maybe they all were, fuck.
