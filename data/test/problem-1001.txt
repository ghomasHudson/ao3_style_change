His lord was aware of him, Barty was certain of that, but Harry Potter seemed to be in control. At least, that was what Barty thought. Surely then, there had to be a way to distinguish the two of them apart? Perhaps his lord was merely sleeping away, compelling the thoughts of the real Harry Potter into acting a certain way?
“Well, it must be all sorts of
He thought passingly as he let go of Draco’s hand to instead wrap his arm around his shoulders, pulling him into a side hug as they both continued to laugh. It began to dwindle though, fading quickly as if a timer had gone off, and he soon found himself staring blankly off towards the fireplace as Draco’s head rested on his pectoral, the both of them a vague mess of jumbled thoughts and scrambled emotions.
He quickly fell back into his mindscape, opening his eyes to find Tom staring at him with annoyance. For a moment, he just blinked, stuned that they now stood eye to eye. He had never expected to grow to be the same height as Tom, having seen him as something of a giant until realizing how small he looked next to Death. Harry smiled winningly, “I didn’t realize we were already the same height-”
speak that name in my presence. Do you understand me Theodore?” The older man towered menacingly above him, his gloved hand still held up-as if he was preparing to strike again. Their eyes met, and Theo slowly lowered his own hand, the stinging in his cheek overshadowed by the calm rage creeping up from his stomach.
“It didn’t seem like something that needed to be discussed. Why did you not ask about me and Nicolas’ relationship if you thought that we might be soulmates?”
Everything went about how one would expect it to, as the pair, while inebriated past the point of decency, still had quite a few decades of sexual escapades under their belts and knew how to get things done with impressive efficiency. The issue that was discussed prior to this situation arose when a rather flustered owl clawed its way into the study, squawking and tumbling through the air and generally making a rather large mess of itself. Narcissa was the first to notice it, as she had a rather good view of the windows and of the things that might potentially crash through them, and was startled so thoroughly by the bird that she completely forgot about wrestling her husband’s belt off his person. The man groaned at first, feeling rather strained in some very sensitive areas, but quickly came to attention as the noises of distress from the owl finally registered in his mind. Turning slightly, the couple watched as the bird wrestled itself up into a standing position, before flapping its wings a few times and jerkily nearing them. Narcissa let out a noise between annoyance and surprise, before sliding off of her husband’s lap in order to meet the razzled owl halfway and snatch the letter from its beak. The bird seemed immensely grateful towards her for taking away its burden and immediately took off again, soaring out of the window as if it hadn’t just nearly cracked the ancient glass with its efforts.
“Brilliant, thank you, Potter.” He wheezed out, barely managing it before he was back to fighting down his stomach, waging a war against his body with nothing but determination and a desire not to vomit all over his shoes. A large hand landed on his back, rubbing soothing circles into the space between his shoulder blades and wings. Draco let out a low groan, swallowing down the burning bile as the distinct sound of someone vomiting hit his ears.
They would weather whatever storm came out of this. They would do it together.
“I don’t really like parties that I don’t plan myself, and magical tents have never been very comfortable to me. I’d much rather just return home.” She replied breezily, waving an arm around through the air as if the entire thought wasn’t worth her time. He was about to try again, his confusion veering to unease before his eyes suddenly landed on her wrist, naturally following the moment of her hands as something red glimmered in the light of their wands.
“There are so very many things to do.”
He studied the trunk for a moment longer, before standing from his bed, walking steadily along the creaking floorboards only to crouch down in front of the trunk and pull it open. Staring down at the ladder stationed there, he glanced around the room that had housed him for nearly four months, before clambering down into the open space inside his trunk.
The perpetrator had him between a rock and a hard place, and there was no plausible way out. Albus had been played like a fool, the faceless murderer getting away with it while striking a decisive blow on Albus’ own forces. Was it Tom? No, the man was ingenious but didn’t have the ability to maneuver in such a way, especially if he was simply possessing Harry Potter as Albus suspected. It was possible that Tom had written to one of his death eaters, but all of the most loyal of Voldemort’s followers were rotting away in Azkaban or dead, and Albus found it unlikely that all the others who had served Tom would be so inclined to help him without physical proof that he had returned. Or… Albus’ eyes widened, a realization slowly dawning on him. Had Tom already regained his body? If he truly had Harry Potter’s body under his control, then was it at all possible for him to have done some sort of ritual to regain form?
Gabrielle : "Hm... non, tu es bien trop petit pour qu'il soit intéressé par toi"
He couldn’t help but return his gaze to where the iron shelf now laid, knowing what was beyond it had to be the ring horcrux’s mind. How that was even possible was beyond him. The only way for the door to have been removed but the connection to have remained would be if the ring somehow gained a body or form, making it the main soul and therefore giving it power over his own mind.
“I sent Persephone along ahead last night, so you don’t have to worry about her inside my room, she should already be in France if there wasn’t any bad weather. I’ll write to you both tonight if she is there, but if she isn’t I'll use Harry’s owl, Hades. You won’t be able to miss it father, if you haven’t seen the owl already. The thing’s massive, and has the most absurd eyes… but that doesn’t matter much in the end.”
“The ‘black liquid’ as you called it, is an easily manufactured mixture more commonly called the Alchemist’s Hand. It was created many thousands of years ago in Greece in order to simplify the process of alchemy, which at the time had instead entailed a great deal of chanting and runes. Alchemist’s Hand, or what I prefer to call ‘ink’ for convenience's sake, is created out of a combination of an alchemist’s own magic and one other choice ingredient.”
“I don’t care.” Tom’s words were hard, and in an instant those icy blue eyes widened in shock. “I don’t care what Harry does with it, as long as Dumbledore dies in the process. If he wishes to destroy the world, then that is his decision to make.”
I've been messing around with Daphne's aesthetic quite a bit, and while I think she could rock any other vibe if I put her in it, I just really wanted to draw a veil (lol). I said it was goth on the drawing but it's really more of a gothic cottagecore than anything. Tracey, on the other hand (since she was raised predominantly in the muggle world) wears very much what your typical 90's kid would, though I've added some casual slytherin pride to that as well. Blaise, on the other hand, was just used as my excuse to draw a turtle neck because I thought that one would look really good on him. (why did I draw Tracey and Daphne's hands like that? Like, why did you do that, past me? Were  you trying to insinuate 'gal-pal' with their friendship even though Daphne is straight? Oh well too late now.)
“I can hardly be faulted for not paying attention.” He muttered back, earning a little laugh for his troubles. She left it be though, seemingly, as she turned his attention back to Harry.
He turned a corner sharply, quickly traversing through the nonsensical halls on a straight path towards his room. Everything was packed and ready, and Luna’s father as well as his grandfather had already agreed to it over letter, so there was nothing stopping him from taking what he and Cantankerous had both agreed would be a well deserved break.
That was when the thought finally struck him, so obvious in its simplicity and yet completely and utterly impossible.
“I believe that… yes, right here.” With a rather subdued flourish, Crouch pulled a large box from beneath jars of various potions ingredients, undoing the latch to reveal a case full of expertly crafted and packaged vials of polyjuice. Harry hummed, leaning in slightly to pick one up and observe the color.
However, even then he found himself annoyed with the nonsensical nature of the estate. It didn’t help in the slightest that there were so few windows to let light in either, as Duncan had also
The chosen one, the boy prophesied to kill his lord… was no longer a threat.
The man took a sip of his tea, before setting the cup back down on the table between them. Tom watched the motion with narrowed eyes, unease trickling down his throat. “Now, I do believe that this conversation has veered off of the beaten path, so let's get back to the discussion of our own soul, hm?”
“Luna? Are you sure you’re alright?” Theo’s voice shocked her, somehow, and she visibly jolted again, before relaxing her shoulders and continuing to take deep breaths.
“The demon will force the world into a new age.”
And then a hand rested gently onto his shoulder.
I like to think that all gods and goddesses, in this story at least, have green around the exterior of their iris, and then a different color around the pupil. This is because I see green as this tie-in with not only death (the killing curse) but also life (plants? lol idk) so it is this great equalizer that signifies immortality in a way. I want to incorporate this concept into the story during this book especially, mostly because (as the title hints) Harry will be doing a lot with his creature side and all the bells and whistles that come with that.
She fidgeted, caught between long-buried memories and an itching feeling at the back of her skull that this was
“I understand, Hadrian. I simply wanted you to understand the truth-to fathom the gravity of what is expected of you before I teach you how to go about creating it.” His mentor rounded the table, and rested a frail hand on his arm. Harry looked at him for a moment, contemplative, before steeling his resolve and straightening out.
Draco rubbed at his face tiredly, picking up both of the letters and stuffing them away into his pocket. He had known for some time now-several years in fact-that his father was untrustworthy in regards to his inheritance. He had stopped questioning the man about it at this point, preferring to go to Harry or-whenever he was particularly desperate-his mother for help. This had worked well enough for the year, though he could admit that it was not an ideal situation, all this considered. It also concerned him that Harry had shown no outward signs that he was unsettled by his father’s actions, though that was understandable considering that Harry was… well, Harry. It was a bit hurtful that Draco had to learn about it through Miss. Delacour’s letter, though he couldn’t be sure that she was not over exaggerating Harry’s own feelings or just lying outright.
about the strange conversation he had found himself in, he considered the man’s words carefully, trying to figure out what would be the best thing to say without betraying his own ideals. The sound of someone walking around upstairs gave him the hope that this conversation would be cut short soon enough.
“Blimey…”
Harry swallowed again, biting the inside of his cheek again until he was certain that if he had blood of his own he would be bleeding. “That would take a lot of muggle blood.”
Side-along apparition, while having some risks, is still perfectly safe if the apparitor knows how to do it without the worry of splinching either themselves or their passenger. Attempting a side-along portkey however, where a poor individual does not actively hold onto the portkey, but instead, another individual who
“The Favorite?” He still felt out of sorts after what had happened, a feeling of betrayal washing over him as the panic and shock began to subside. His grandfather had
Perenelle’s voice was like a cold bucket of ice to his system, electrocuting every nerve in the hyper-aware state he had fallen into. He jerked again, gaze locking onto her relaxed form as she poured two cups of tea, slowly and attentively. Draco watched the gentle movements for a sparse second before his gaze fell back onto Harry, his attention focusing back onto the greatest issue on his mind as he slowly walked around the table before settling in the nearest chair, watching desperately for any more signs of panic or frustration or… hell,
Lucius Malfoy stepped out of the west wing, a glass of ludicrously expensive champagne held aloft in one hand. He stumbled, hiccuped, before letting out a burp so crass and undignified that a sewer rat would find itself taking offence. His wife, who was equally drunk and carrying the bottle from where the unnecessarily expensive champagne had been held moments prior, merely laughed, and loosened his tie.
“Was this my fault?” He whispered, staring at the large expanse of wall in front of him. It seemed that he had reached the back of the store, somehow. Theo rubbed a hand down his face, groaning into his clammy palm as he realized how far from the group he had strayed in his pondering. He couldn’t even hear the others anymore.
Tom had been standing just a second before.
Draco shuffled, and Harry stiffened as a distant, pained shreek met his ears. He reached out, gripping tightly to Draco’s shoulder to keep him in place as he made a move to let go and investigate. They needed to leave. No matter what was happening, Harry knew he valued his own life over the faceless masses of people who might be in danger just beyond the treeline.
to be in the
His caution slowly bred curiosity, slowly as the door continued to sit there silently. It seemed to call to him, in a strange way. It felt eerily familiar in a sense, as if he had seen it before out of the corner of his eye several times, but had never stared straight at it. It was… just a little too tempting for his taste.
“Oh but
“Oh, bollocks!”
He tried to keep his focus away from the display, feeling as though he had just intruded upon something.
He wondered idly, scratching an itch on his pectoral as Perenelle pointedly slurped her coffee.
He turned a corner that was more oblong than was normal, coming upon a fireplace that stood directly in the middle of that hall for no particular reason. Surprisingly, his grandfather was there to meet him, the old man’s arms crossed behind his back and a third, much smaller, trunk resting at his feet. They looked at each other for a moment as Theo set down the suitcases in his hands, before his grandfather seemed to slump slightly.
“You can certainly think of it that way, Tom, and you would be…
about it. What was it? How had Harry gotten it? Was it to do with his infamous scar, or something else? If it was to do with the scar, then how exactly was it related? Those questions had gone unanswered, of course, and eventually, she had let them sit somewhere in the back of her mind to collect dust, but now they were racing back to her attention as she gazed at the angry bolt of blood.
It was itching at her.
Yes, that was what he would do. Marvolo would write to the Knights of Walpurgis, and any of those who were still living would surely heed his call. They would return, and with them would come information of what he had missed, and then there would be nothing his memories could do to refute his own authority. He would be the true soul, he would no longer be second to Tom Riddle, be he the muggle or the wizard.
Luna trusted Harry, and while she said that it was inexplicable it was really quite calculated.
“This, Harry, is the moral dilemma that you face here.” Nicolas popped the top off of the phial, and the smell of iron immediately permeated the air. Harry stiffened slightly, hands subconsciously clenching as he urged his instincts down. Even without the need to breathe, he could still taste the metallic odor on his tongue.
Theo took a deep breath, gathering himself before he took half a step back. The door didn’t move, didn’t breathe, or reveal itself to be some sort of shape-shifting beast before attacking him with a mouth full of sharp teeth. No, it just sat there… like a door.
The tar-like substance writhed and shook, before it suddenly went limp in the container, and began to shrink. Nicolas grasped another tube of unknowable formula, which was instead clear like water, and dripped a single drop of it onto the blackened, shrinking form.
“Tom?” He whispered, almost despite himself.
“I fear Death, yes, but I also fear its master.” Tom looked up sharply, his eyes blown wide. He opened his mouth, unsure of what he would even say, before the blue-eyed man continued without pause. “I fear what will come of the world when you go through with this plan. Is it wise to give the boy even more power than he already has? He already is plotting to kill tens of thousands of muggles as it is, what else will come of his rampage once you bestow onto him this gift? Will the world be destroyed or saved for it? Can you be certain that he deserves-”
He barely made it out the door and down the stairs without tripping, using the support of the people around him and the desperate wish that they were all too deliriously excited or drunk or unfocused to pay much attention to an invisible force pushing its way through the crowd. All he could manage to focus on was the hulking figure he was following, the pitch-black hair and the commanding presence and that frighteningly familiar aura of power and supremacy. The imposing man moved through the crowd with ease, parting the waves of people with a familiar happenstance that sent a shock of thrill racing through his body. The familiar movements, the unignorable aura… the familiarity he felt did not shock him. No one but his lord could ever make him feel so terrified, astonished, and in awe all at the same time.
Harry watched as the gold glimmered in the light, intrigued by the entire process despite knowing very little about it. What was the black tar-like substance, and how did it play into ageing the metal’s spirit?
After that was, of course, Nigel. The golden child. He had taken over for their father as a politician long before she had been born and was clearly the favorite of their parents. He had made it in the world before she even had the chance to learn how to speak, and there was no conceivable way for her to ever reach his level, so she had simply never tried. He never paid her much attention when visiting the estate either, too focused on bragging to their father about the connections that he had made or what bills he had helped get passed. However, it seemed whenever he was particularly bored he would delight in making her miserable, be it by tugging on her hair or insulting her interests or just calling her a filthy little bastard that should be grateful for all that had been done to allow her to have a sizable reputation.
“He’s a coward-that bastard, he’s an utter
Tom coughed again, waving his hand in front of his face as if to remove a foul odor from his general vicinity. Harry could only assume that the air smelt far more spicy than it tasted, and couldn’t help but be happy that he couldn’t breath.
Perhaps the former then. Barty wanted to dance with glee, terribly excited to see what his father had in store for him. Perhaps he would put a quidditch poster in the room Barty was kept in? Even knowing that something new was nearby would keep him entertained for at
“Shut up, Locket. It has nothing to do with you.”
“...Yeah.”
Theo opened his eyes, gaze unfocused as it roamed the room, searching for something that might make him focus on anything but Luna and his concern for her. Strangely enough, his eyes settled onto the mason jar of honey, and he found himself watching how the sun hit the glass and refracted through the golden-brown sweetener. He focused on the bubbles trapped in the honey, how they seemed perpetually stuck-as if time had stopped for the mason jar alone, keeping those pockets of air trapped inside, never to be moved until someone came along and disturbed them. Theo took another breath, beginning to slowly calm himself down forcibly.
Harry looked fascinated, if anything, and reached out to touch it before she gently maneuvered her wrist away, entangling his long, awkward fingers with the necklace’s chain instead. “But enough of that, we’re set to leave in five… four… three…”
“Theodore, please understand when I say this, but could it be possible that you are being willfully ignorant presently?”
“Dray, I’ve already died, and the very first thing I did after my heart stopped was crawl into your bed next to you. I’m never leaving. I’m never running away.” He replied, his voice steadier than it had been all evening as it echoed through the room. And when he said it, Harry knew that it was pure, unavoidable truth.
He shook his head carefully, still watching the girl’s father as he seemed to contemplate something carefully. “No, don’t worry about it. Shall we head off?”
“I suppose they’ll be back eventually then, yeah?”
Harry let out a low sigh, rubbing at the left side of his face as he leaned forward, setting the mug back onto the table. How was he going to get out of this? “It’s… complicated. It would take an awful lot of explanation.”
Draco sputtered, “what do you mean why not? He’s the most famous quidditch star of our generation!”
Marvolo stood, turning away from the carpet as if it were nothing but an accent for the hardwood, and retraced his steps. He walked past the old, bloodied stain where Lord Riddle had lost his life, bleeding out from the gaping, bloodied stump of a leg. The man had died slowly, painfully, like a dog, though Marvolo had already been a horcrux when it did finally happen. He had not had the joy of witnessing it, sad to say. He turned the corner, eyes ghosting over the painting of fruit, now once again covered with the dusty tarp. He ignored the splattering of blood across the wall, or the stain of blackened red sunk into that faded carpet. Marvolo walked past it all, his excitement and glee from mere moments before gone as if it had never existed in the first place.
Has anyone realized that I don't know how to draw children yet? I'm so glad that I can get away with making them all look pretty grown up-ish now because I was really suffering through those first three years. Harry and Draco here are likely my very favorite drawings in the entire thing. I really enjoyed adding Draco's canonical 'pointy-ness' to the drawing while still keeping the personality that I have made for him in this story. I know that, at this point, my Harry is a completely different person than canonical Harry, but I think that that is a healthy distinction. In making an AU that strays so far away from the canon as this one, it is important to really
Harry sighed, and set the letter down. He didn’t know what about it unsettled him so much, but the way Luna wrote felt… strange. Off putting. And not in Luna’s special kind of strange. It felt raw, untempered and rushed, like she had been running through the woods being chased by rabid dogs as she wrote it out. Luna didn’t sound like herself, though many people had difficulty writing in the exact same way they spoke, so perhaps that was it?
She shook herself from the stupor just long enough to glare at Draco and his harsh interruptions, before turning her piercing eyes onto Harry. “You can't seriously expect me to allow you to just-just
“Well, speaking of Quidditch, I actually have something for you Harry.” He cut in, suddenly remembering the tickets he had shoved in his coat pocket an hour or so prior. He pulled all three of them out, handing one to Harry as he started to explain. “My father had bought them once he learned the World Cup was being held in the British Isles this year, and had bought three for just him, me, and my mother. However, both of them decided they didn’t want to go recently, so I figured that since I’m staying here the rest of the summer, you might enjoy coming along…? I know you aren’t much for Quidditch, but-”
“That’s the thing though, I think there is.”
“I’ve been associating with filth my entire life. Why not disrespect it as well?”
Albus paced through his office, muttering under his breath as the stars outside did nothing but twinkle without cause. Fawkes sang a gentle tune, which for once did not seem to do him any good as his frustration peaked. At first, when all potential werewolves seemed to be suspended as subjects, he considered that there might be another large, shape-shifting creature that was out to incriminate his pawns. Of course, there was no creature that he knew of that could do such a thing besides werewolves, at least not one that was native to Britain. He had then thought of beasts that might be tamable, and of the idea that someone had brought a magical creature over the wards somehow to sic the thing on Ginevra Weasley, but it seemed to be such a large effort for something so small.
Draco grinned, feeling affection bubble up from his chest as Harry’s voice tapered off. ”Yeah? I climbed a tree.”
“Oi!”
Fate has white around her pupil because, as descriptions state, her eyes are always cold and cruel, which I often imagined as this freezing ice-like look that I thought would be best encapsulated with white. Both her's and Death's eyes were based off of solar eclipses (loosely, as I was too lazy to pull up any photo references and just kinda went with a picture in my mind), just because I thought that it would lend the eyes to looking more unearthly and-well, godly.
“Oh but you two can’t go alone can you? You’re only fourteen after all.” Perenelle remarked, amusement and concern overlapping each other in her tone. Draco paused, not having considered very much past getting a ticket into Harry’s hands.
“Well you are being… distracting.”
“I suppose it would be fun to meet your other friends.” Luna’s calm voice broke him from the thought, and he glanced away from the smiling faces of the portraits towards the girl, who was pouring bright yellow wax out onto the letter. “I’m sure Mr. Zabini would be fun to meet, if I ignored the fight in his core.”
They both nearly let go of the chain then, as a sudden burst of green light ripped its way across the sky. Draco made a pained noise in the back of his throat as Harry watched the dark mark rise high in the sky, the familiar skull laughing with seething hatred as a long, thick snake weaved out from inside its mouth like a tongue.
One thing about muggle Paris that Harry hadn’t been expecting was the smell.
“I just… just tell me why you don’t know Luna. Just tell me why you don’t know why you trust him. Please.”
Tom didn’t answer at first. He didn’t know how to. He just stared, viciously, at those icy blue eyes and the small, sad smile that accompanied them.
Squinting harder, Theo got his face as close as he dared to the candle and the flame as close as was safe to the books without actually burning either. Despite the clear issues with the Nott library, he had still managed to spend most of his time in it as a child, reading by candlelight and the occasional sunlight whenever the weather was nice enough for him to sit outside comfortably for hours on end. That wasn’t to say that he didn’t have a problem with it, and had spent many years of his time trying to get his grandfather into any shambling sense of responsibility over the manor. It seemed, though, that the old man was intent on leaving eventual repairs on Theo’s shoulders. Or perhaps he just wanted to subtly influence where Theo spent his time, as it was all too likely that keeping the library as it was had been a continuous effort by the man to make Theo spend his time doing something more constructive to his future.
“Who’s not going mad?”
“Four…”
That seemed to be enough to make Harry look up at him, disbelief splashed across his stupid, beautiful face. “Really? You...? A tree?”
“What did you say to her?” He questioned Draco quietly, the other boy still looking a few seconds away from strangling the girl.
Nicolas laughed lightly, picking up the bottle that Harry had been observing in order to bring it into the light for observation. “I must admit, the process is rather draining, but what I can relate it to is the act of casting a spell continuously until your magical reserves have been completely expended.”
Harry didn’t have the faintest clue how to go about it.
There was nothing for him to do but write to Griphook about the Black lordship and hope for the best.
Tom realized that there was something wrong the instant that it happened, sitting up straight in his chair as an earth-shattering
“Your father, Dray. Your father wrote to me.”
Draco's brooch: https://gentlemanjoe.com/products/feather-crystal-lapel-broach
“Finished with your business?” He whispered, watching Harry’s face as the boy’s expression cracked, some sort of sick, twisted amusement shining through the boredom as he settled down on the bench. He looked like he had just done something utterly unallowed, or perhaps profoundly stupid.
He let frustration and anger overtake him for once, lashing out against the inanimate stone wall until his knuckles were scraped raw of skin and his bone showed through underneath, pale and harsh against the low candlelight. The stinging sensation was thrilling though, tantalizing in a way he couldn’t quite describe, and Harry couldn’t help but throw one last punch out towards the rough stone, feeling alive for the first time in
Lavender Brown had never been one of his favorite people, of that there was little doubt, but she did make a remarkably efficient timepiece. He should take advantage of permanent transfigurations more often.
They passed by a familiar gaggle of redheads on their way towards the train, and Draco’s complaints about his nausea ceased as they both gazed at the unnaturally subdued family, slowing in stride slightly as they observed the noticeably smaller group. Molly looked like she had lost a considerable amount of weight, and her hands shook slightly as she flattened down Ron’s jumper. Arthur was nowhere to be found, likely still hard at work at the ministry or who knows where else. Percy also seemed to have not joined them, likely also at the ministry with his father. The twins were there though, and stood a bit to the side of their mother, whispering quietly to themselves as they leaned over a small blue book. They seemed to be fairing the best out of their family, but Harry got an uneasy feeling as he passed them by, the feeling only doubling as they glanced up to look at him. Fred sent him a tight smile, but George didn’t bother, merely nodding once before returning to the book. Harry supposed they had their own way of mourning, one that didn’t involve the pranks he was paying to help them create.
“But you didn’t.”
He watched the passersby for a time, observing how people craned their necks upwards to get a good look at Harry, before quickly turning to their companions, who quickly did the same. A few people even had the gall to point at him, and one over-eager cameraman even took a photo. Draco sneered at the lot of them, trying to figure out how Harry could so easily ignore the blatancy of it all. Sure, he got his fair share of people staring at him during school, but he had been living with muggles before that and couldn’t have exactly become accustomed to it by the time first year had come around, since even then he had been particularly uninterested in the looks he got from the general student body.
He blinked a few times, finding his entire body too stiff to move as he blinked the ice off of his eyelids carefully.
“This is the question that you have for me, isn’t it. You want to know if I’m willing to go that far.” Nicolas looked stricken, his face pinched as Harry finally looked up and stared him down. “My answer is the same, if that's what you want to know. I’ll still make one, no matter the costs.”
“Please, most people just call me Harry.”
She brushed his hair down into some sense of respectability, standing up on her toes in order to kiss the crown of his head, struggling slightly as he was at least four inches taller than her now. Draco leaned down a bit so she wouldn’t strain herself at all, a feeling of pride bubbling up from his stomach as she reached
Perenelle pat his arm, a warm, strangely touching smile lighting up her face as she spoke. Harry was taken aback by the expression, not knowing just what about it had brought him so much comfort at first. In fact, it wasn’t till he had gotten into bed that night, the sun having already risen and set, that he realized just why it had offset him so much. The smile had been patent in the way that a mentor might look at their pupil, but kind in the way a family member might address their child. It wasn’t a smile given to a pupil after they do something grand, or a mother addressing something sweet that her child had done, but was strangely in the middle.
He heard his voice acknowledge the fact, but didn’t make any move to get closer to it. The Failure had long-since injured his shard of their soul to the point of permanent damage. The only reason he had not passed on was the overwhelming hatred and spite that he held inside him. He would never give in to that suicidal, pathetic little creature that used his father’s name like it was a pride. However, movement was far beyond his capabilities, especially considering the injuries that he had sustained over what he could assume was the past few months.
Through the pain, through that unimaginable suffering, an inkling of logic shone through, and Voldemort realized that he understood what was happening. Souls couldn’t be healed like bodies could, as they had very little capacity for change after being destroyed past a certain point. When you died, there was no coming back, and when your soul was ripped to shreds, the pain of putting yourself back together came with the cost of death.
“Well… we ought to get going.” He finally said, giving Perenelle and Nicolas one last, slightly desperate, glance. “I’ll write to you both as much as I can, keeping you updated on everything.”
Harry also realized that he never met his grandparents before.
Harry hummed a quick agreement, already halfway out the door as Nicolas’ question trailed behind him. The door swung shut, the voice inside muffling from behind it as he started briskly walking, traversing up the stairs to the second-floor landing as fast as he could manage.
Hell, he didn’t even sleep.
Harry stopped in place, realizing for perhaps the first time just how much he was saddling himself with. Maybe he really was going mad.
before Harry’s voice interrupted the attempt.
“You’re bleeding too? Did the horcrux attack you?”
Nicolas seemed only slightly regretful, picking up the stone once again to take it back to its proper place. “Yes, we acted as corpse removalists, to keep the streets free of disease. Perenelle also went to Britain and took blood from the dead and dying there, since the Thames was practically overflowing with corpses… Well, by the end of the nearly three decades of plague, we had more than enough blood.”
Harry watched dully as the Bulgarian Minister delivered his first English line of the day, sending Fudge into a familiar rant as the Irish team finally finished off their victory lap and entered the top box, the lot of them causing the place to go up in a tizzy again as they crowded around Fudge, who handed them the massive Quidditch World Cup trophy while leveling annoyed glares at the Bulgarian Minister.
“You alright there love?” Harry questioned, his warm voice laced with concern as he grabbed Draco firmly around the shoulders, leading him over to a vague blob that looked something like a couch. Draco made a garbled groan-like noise, far too focused on the sudden uneasiness in his stomach to articulate anything vaguely discernable.
She giggled, head in both hands as she stared, cross-eyed, at the vague brown hues of the Ravenclaw table below her. She hadn’t been feeling well at all that day, the discomfort starting very early that morning, though she hadn’t been able to discern for what reason she was feeling ill. She eventually settled on the vague thought that someone wanted her to pay attention to things, and had done her best to do so from that second onwards. Theo had noticed her odd actions that morning, if the half-frozen appearance of his soul had been any indication, though he hadn’t said anything about it and seemed to have been hoping she herself would bring it up. She hadn’t though, not feeling particularly inclined to do so, and they had gone along to the school with nary a thought and had quickly separated upon entrance to the great hall.
“Four…”
“If you hadn’t come here today, you would have failed in what you must do down the line no matter how hard you try at it, just like how that poor boy with the demon would have died on last Samhain if it weren't for the equalizer rejuvenating and… well,
Harry, halfway up in his chair and preparing for an argument, suddenly stopped and stared at her. Her expression was confused, or perhaps contemplative, but her eyes were knowing. She had played him right into her hand.
“Tom, we talked about this.”
The imperious curse was a special type of torture.
He wanted to argue. He wanted to take back the watering can and everything that he had asked, but instead, he straightened out, clutched her hand in his own, and nodded, the promise bitter and unfamiliar on his tongue.
(Lmao and yes I am absolutely making Harry as tall as Death once he's full grown, he's still got quite a bit of growing left in him.)
“I would have loved to leave tomorrow you know, maybe after a small breakfast and an anti-nausea potion.” He muttered dully, causing Harry to laugh as Perenelle tucked her wand under her arm, taking a pocket watch out of one of her many pockets and holding it up to the light. “I mean, really, would it be so much trouble-”
Tom pinched the bridge of his nose, staring blankly at the broken door as his migraine returned two-fold with the painfully loud noise. Fixing it right away was clearly not viable, but if he could find a way to keep Locket from even trying to barge in again, if only temporarily, then perhaps that would give him enough time to rest his magic and try for more extensive precautions.
Standing there silently, watching the two strangers and his lord stand there, waiting for the seconds to drag on towards an unknowable future, Barty got the forceful urge to move forward, to disrupt the chanting and take hold of his lord’s arm, to turn the man away from the two unknown people and get a first good look at his master’s face for the first time since his imprisonment. With a jolt, he started towards the trio, his steps panicked and forceful as the woman continued on, her idyllic chants broken unceremoniously by a shriek rising up behind him.
“Harry-Harry Potter, is it? Wonderful, absolutely wonderful to meet you. This is the-yes, this is Harry Potter… the boy-who-lived? You know of him, I’m sure.”
Tom’s breath on the back of his neck. It was so
Was it worth it? Did she really want to force them out into uneasy waters when they were already thriving in a tropical paradise?
“Uhm… yeah, mate?” He muttered, still blinking the sleep from his eyes as he settled into a more comfortable position. How long had he been asleep? Had Fleur and Gabrielle already left? He glanced around, finding that it was only them in the sitting room, all alone. He then looked to the windows, finding himself staring out at the pitch-black of night. Yes, it seemed like they had left, or at least should have left.
“It’s not very priceless, really, just a fun little novelty. It hadn’t been made with enough… well, ingredients. It can’t do much besides shine prettily, so Nicolas made it into a necklace for me as a fourth-anniversary gift. It was a matching set with this bracelet.” She explained, holding up her wrist, wherein sat a similarly styled bracelet with a slightly smaller stone dangling from it. “This stone is the second prototype, if you’re curious.”
Albus sighed, setting down the quill and momentarily gathering himself. He needed to have a plan before he did anything more. Tom was hardly one to be trifled with, especially if the man was newly risen and out for blood.
“So… any particular plans for the year?” He tried, receiving a genuine smile from Daphne and a rather pained grimace from Draco. Harry merely grunted.
Tom’s voice was soft and understanding as he whispered gentle promises through Harry’s mind, his tone somber as it echoed in his skull. Harry unwittingly found himself relaxing, the shards of crystalline ice weaving up his arms slowly receding.
“Precisely.”
He almost wanted to step away, run back through the woods. Not to see what was happening, but maybe to get a better picture. It had to be happening early, and it had to be for some reason he didn’t know. Was it something that he had done? It had to have been. Any changes spiderwebbed out from his own decisions.
He knew that Remus Lupin was innocent, which of course raised the thought of who the hell had been bold enough to not only enter his school, but kill a girl in one of the most gruesome ways imaginable, before fleeing off into the night, all without the wards giving him even a blip of concern for the intruder. Any werewolf in Britain was a potential perpetrator, though Albus felt that the only one fearless enough to even attempt such a thing would be Fenrir Greyback. The only issue with that being that the man was last spotted mere hours prior to the attack in southern England near the town of Newquay, which had to be about as far from Scotland one could get without being in the ocean. Sure, the bastard could have taken the floo to Hogsmeade, as it was the closest place within miles of Hogwarts, but it seemed doubtful that he could manage to get through without anyone seeing him or the private floo alarms alerting
“What do you reckon that was about?” He whispered, squinting slightly at the man’s retreating back as Draco snorted.
It didn’t mean he pitied the thing though. Far from it, really.
Inescapable situations oftentimes call for horrible sacrifices. The limb must be cut off to preserve the whole.
Nicolas closed his mouth, before opening it again. “It is made almost exclusively of Alchemist’s Hand, though it has been compressed to the point of being in the form of a large gem. It is, at its most basic, an incredibly refined and dense form of Alchemist’s Hand.”
You can assign the name of one thing to something else entirely, and that does not diminish the existence of both.”
Shouts of protest rose up around her, though Luna forced it all away from her tiny bubble of focus. This was horribly,
“I’ll help you in every way I can, no matter what happens, alright? I promise, Dray.” He whispered, his calcified heart in his throat as Draco’s eyes widened. He couldn’t discern what was his own emotions and what were Draco’s. He couldn’t even sort out what he was doing from what Draco was thinking. This had to be the soulbond, right? Harry took a shuddering breath, feeling it in Draco’s lungs as the other boy copied the movement. It felt like he was in two places at once, living two lives at the same time. Maybe he was. The line between them seemed to be blurring more and more by the day.
When he didn’t reply, or maybe when continued to avert his eyes and stare blankly at a darkened stain in the tabletop, Draco sighed heavily and leaned forward, head in one hand.
Oh yes, the possibilities were utterly
It was quiet for a moment, before Death let out a very noticeable snort. Marvolo looked up with fury, intent on punishing the entity for such blatant disrespect, but found that it had already disappeared, leaving him alone in the enclosed shack of his namesake’s making. He stood, fiery eyes glancing slowly around the room as he forced any emotion besides hate away, finding any feelings of confusion or happiness to be unnecessary in his goals. Straightening, Marvolo walked steadily from the shack, his cool hands brushing slowly down his bloodied shirt to press out any wrinkles. The first thing to do was get a better understanding of the current world that he now found himself in. The Failure had often regaled him with stories of past victories and the painful defeat that eventually followed them all, mocking him in a way with memories that he had never been privy to. However, in that mocking and shame he had inadvertently been gifted very important information, and was now well aware of several important players in his game.
is expecting you to take up the title! You can't just-”
“-and he was just brilliant, did you see that Wronski Feint he pulled at the beginning there? I would never have been able to manage it, but Krum did it so effortlessly!” Draco gushed, his arms waving widely as they followed the darkened form of Perenelle through the tents as lanterns were quickly lit all around them, casting faint glows onto Draco’s face and revealing the wide grin on display there. Harry watched the expression fondly, smiling as the shorter boy changed focus towards the end of the match, hip-hopping from one thought to another like a jackrabbit.
“Campsite? Whyever would we be camping?” She teased, causing him to share a confused look with Draco, who seemed equally lost.
Harry bit his lip, suddenly feeling a sense of foreboding. He still didn’t understand why the girl’s letter made him feel so unsettled, so unnerved, but that feeling shouldn’t stop him from ever picking up another envelope again, right? It wasn’t like Luna would write to him twice after all, especially since he had yet to respond to the first one. It was probably from one of his other friends, or maybe a random person. It was his birthday, after all, it was hardly odd to get things for his birthday, right?
Harry blinked, before his head snapped to Perenelle, accusation in his tone as he clutched the small stone protectively to his chest. “This is the portkey?”
“I know you want to talk about it,” he whispered, Draco’s heartbeat racing through his finger and along the nerves of his arm.
“Then her family will have to manage.”
Draco looked between his two companions, letting go of the chain as his eyebrows furrowed. Perenelle nodded along to Harry’s words, also letting go of the chain as the awkwardly tall boy fiddled with it.
I did a piece with a lot of fire in it for an art scholastic this year, so not only have I had a lot of practice with drawing dramatic fire but actually enjoy doing it now. I think that it's likely pretty obvious now that I really like height differences (like...
That overarching feeling of confusion seemed to follow him through the rest of the day like a thick cloud of smog, not dissipating in the slightest once Perenelle and Fleur returned and created a buffer between Gabrielle and Draco, who seemed to have it out for each other in the worst way possible. Perhaps worst of all, Nicolas, who he would have usually turned to as a last resort when the environment around him became too illogical, seemed to be caught up in his own head as well, sitting slouched in his chair with a brooding air about him. If Harry didn’t know any better, he would have thought the immortal man was pouting, but it seemed more realistic to assume that he was just thinking very hard about something, as he had been doing for the past week ever since he had taken a trip to Beauxbatons the week prior.
Unless, of course, Death itself was the thing to put you together again.
Harry stared into those silver eyes, wide with a panic that he could feel in every unbelievable, improbable way.
Harry stared out into his empty bedroom, listening with detached interest as his pocket watch—a familiar piece, made of silver and engraved with lavenders—ticked steadily onwards towards a predestined time. He watched the paint on the wall, eyes unfocused and mind elsewhere as the ticking slowly drove him mad.
and as he opened his eyes to gaze upon infinity, he could think of nothing other than absolution.
“Draco I… I don’t know how to say-”
Draco’s expression was confused, his face slightly illuminated by the light from the two wands as he glanced between the pair of them. Perenelle backtracked slightly, her face coming into view out of the darkness. She seemed amused.
"Et tu es bien trop jeune et... femelle pour qu'il te voie d'une façon romantique, donc on dirait que j'ai de bien meilleurs chances, non?" Hissed Draco, clearly mocking the little girl, just going off the tone. Gabrielle made an affronted gasp, before lurching away from both of them and storming off, her little fists shaking with anger. Harry watched her go with a mix of confusion and relief, happy that the altercation was over and done with, regardless of the fact that he hadn’t the faintest clue what it was even about.
Luna had reached the bottom of the steps, and entered the room cautiously just as he finished. Xenophilius sat back in his chair as she did, a troubled look on his face as his eyes immediately began to lose the sharpness in them. Luna didn’t seem to have seen him initially, but as she turned to look from her father’s troubled features she caught sight of him and grinned broadly. He smiled at her gently as her grin only widened and she skipped around the clutter and furniture to hug him tightly around the middle.
Weird question, but does anyone actually read the summaries? I put an unnecessary amount of time into them sometimes, so I just want to know if that effort is recognized at all. Either way, you should totally read them (or continue to read them) not only are they most of the time very indicative of important parts of each chapter, but I sometimes try to make them funny too.
He reached up to rub his face contemplatively, but recoiled once he realized that there was still glitter covering his fingers and palm. Groaning, he reached for his wand again, muttering another scourgify with slight aggression. Most of the glitter vanished off of him and his desk, only a few pieces remaining on the letter and under his fingernails. Leaning back, Harry rubbed his face with both hands before groaning again. Just what was it about the letter that made him feel so strange? Luna almost sounded… scared. Theo wasn’t capable of hurting her, at least Harry didn’t think so, so it had to be something else. Maybe she had some sort of vision? Theo always got a tad off kilter after a vision, though that still didn’t explain why she wrote to him of all people. Maybe he had been involved in the vision? It certainly wouldn’t have been the first time.
He had always wished desperately to keep Harry safe, because the woman that had died for his creation had given up her life in the pursuit of that very wish.
out between clenched teeth forcing itself to the surface. Xenophilius’ smile widened, and he motioned Theo over to one of the well worn couches as he himself took a seat.
He took a small sip of his water again, thanking Perenelle as she levitated a plate of breakfast over to him. She seemed nice enough-she absolutely adored potions, which was a subject he felt that he needed personal growth in, so Harry was feeling rather tempted to ask for advice or even lessons from her alongside his efforts with Nicolas.
“Blast it all.” He had very little knowledge of this modern age, and while he was aware of himself growing more knowledgeable and powerful through the years, he had not personally been privy to any of the knowledge or memories that the younger horcruxes had formed. If he had managed to get the diadem on his side things might be different, but the horcrux inhibiting it was more of an obsessive scholar than a tyrant, his need for societal power temporarily having been abated through his search of physical and magical power. It was a damning step backwards, especially considering that it was very likely that the Failure was that much closer to absorbing the diadem horcrux and getting that much closer to achieving his self-sacrificial goals. If the Failure managed to get to the diadem, then it was only so much more time till he overpowered the maniacal locket and then he would be able to easily absorb the cup. Where would that leave Marvolo? Mostly likely in a stalemate in which he was both outgunned and the underdog. No, he needed to keep a low profile, keeping to the shadows as he formed a better idea of what resources he had available. Then, when he had every piece on the board exactly where he wanted it, only then would he strike.
Dropping his hands, Harry picked up the letter again and reread it. Maybe he should just write back to her, asking if she was alright. It seemed like the simplest way to go. Sighing, he reached towards the stack of parchment on the edge of his desk, brushed off some of the fly-away glitter that had landed on it, and reached for his quill. If Luna was scared about something, then he had every right to question her about it, he had every right to know.
are painfully obvious, Hadrian. No one person could desire someone as strongly as you desire Draco Malfoy unless that person was so deeply entwined with their lover that their very souls merged together. Don’t try to deny that.”
The booklet was then placed on the table between them, displaying the title that had been previously obscured by the horcrux's hand. ‘The Will to Survive’ was what it read, the serif font mocking Tom from where he sat in a suddenly uncomfortable chair. He gazed at the booklet as if it had personally offended him, the bright blue letters gleaming in the light of a nearby candle.
Harry didn’t question the quiet until his foot landed on a fallen twig, snapping it and breaking him from the daydream. He looked up and around, stopping in place suddenly as he realized that there were trees all around them. Since when were they walking through the forest?
“I can’t stand to see you like this, love.” He whispered, gripping a tight hold on his senses as Draco seemed to get lost in his own.
Tom blinked, a sudden thought creeping into his mind as he turned to glance at the locket for what felt like the millionth time. He bit at the inside of his cheek, contemplative as he watched the creature writhe pitifully in its bonds. Surely the chair and chains wouldn’t disappear if they traveled from his mind to Locket’s, would they? Nothing from his mind ever disappeared if it was taken to Harry’s, and sat there until one of them brought it back. Though, they did have a unique living arrangement. It could easily be different for him and his soul shards.
familiar. It was
“Well, she certainly wrote this into existence. That, at least, is obvious.” He was doubtful about any other people that could have done it, as Lucius no longer had a horcrux in his possession and all other means of giving him new life were either very near impossible or so improbable that he ignored them on principle. In the end though, he supposed it didn’t matter. He could sit there and contemplate what had happened until even Harry showed signs of age, but that would get him nowhere. The end result of the ring gaining physical form was not made null and void by an impossible and unknown cause.
“The philosopher's stone, of course.”
The greatest comfort he had found in France, however, was the Flamels themselves. Perenelle was utterly brilliant, and while she had a certain tendency to blabber on and interrupt what he was saying whenever she wished to speak, her refreshing assurity and confidence, as well as her tendency to feverishly bake all manner of pastries that she would then shove his way, caused Harry to find himself horribly attached to her. Every morning started early for the pair of them, as they slowly and serenely sipped coffee or tea while eating a large breakfast on the back patio. Around mid-morning Nicolas would finally emerge from his bedroom, and Harry would then be swept off for a day of research and good company until they would depart late into the night. Nicolas himself was just as charming and delightful as his wife, though the man was noticeably more formal and had a world-weary look about him that Harry could strangely relate to. It seemed that the effect of immortality on the couple had emerged in very different ways, and Harry couldn’t help but wonder what age and time would do to him. For some reason, he didn’t think he would be like either of the Flamels, though it was hard to tell when he was so young. However, the thought did follow him through the month of July, creeping through his mind as his 14th birthday got closer and closer.
Harry pushed off of the desk, the now crumpled letter still in his hand as he whipped around and swung viciously towards the nearest wall, hearing a satisfying
“You know, portkeys used to be rather wretched for me. I don’t know what changed, but I’m certainly not complaining.”
Blaise quirked a brow, not so much surprised as he was curious. Of course Harry had seen death, but it had only just occurred to him that Harry had barely been one when the attack on Godric's Hollow happened. Did he remember so early on in his life, or was there some other instance that made him able to see the strange horses? And, really, what exactly was it with Harry and death-related creatures? First the dementor backed down to his command in their third year, and now the thestrals were going mad at the sight of him as well?
“You are Harry Potter! You are, aren’t you? You have the scar and everyzing!” He blinked, glancing up to Fleur with a slightly panicked look as Gabrielle didn’t wait for his answer before leaping forward to hug him around the thigh, as she barely came up to his pelvis.
Sudden fury raced through him, searingly cold and painful and
‘Tom is right.’
“You live like this?”
It was quiet for several moments, Theo’s unregulated and jerky breathing being the only noise.
The woman had scared her, far more than Luna had been scared before. It felt like there was a threat hanging over her head now, ever present and cruel as it mocked her with an invisible timer counting down to her punishment for not doing as she was told. She took one final breath, filling her lungs slowly as the morning sun arched a slow path across her painted walls. It was easy to write a simple letter, she had written dozens in the past year alone, all she had to do was ask how Harry was and what he was up to. Maybe she could even tell him to write to Theo as well, if only to see if the two would try and reconnect. Yes, that sounded perfectly reasonable, perfectly simple; there was no reason to be afraid in the face of a task so simple.
Draco took a deep, shaky breath, before exhaling with a laugh and a few traitorous tears. Harry seemed to be having fun, which was certainly a good thing. Though Draco wished he could be there to actually see it, instead of just reading the likely extremely filtered version through the other boy’s letters. He could readily admit that the loneliness had gripped him many weeks ago and had refused to let go, and that he was suffering through it, if only just. Draco could admit, if only to himself, that he had been fantasizing about what it must be like there as a way of coping, and had been spending hours contemplating what Harry might be doing throughout the days. Draco had been allowing himself an unnecessarily large amount of time to contemplate what Harry must look like down in the alchemy lab that he had described in his past letters, with his arms free of their usual long sleeves and the heat from melting metals causing sweat to drip from his brow. He couldn’t still be wearing that leather jacket, could he? Certainly not in the sweltering weather and certainly not around a burning furnace. Does he wear that one white muggle ‘tank top’ with the thin straps that were sure to show his shoulders and curve of his spine through the thin material? Or does he forgo a shirt altogether? Does he wear those black slacks that he always insisted on or something lighter? What was he wearing to bed-?
The iron door came into sight, infinitely bothersome and hilariously infallible as he swung around the corner, his hand gripping around the handle and
“What did he say.”
“I guess I am, since I still don’t know what I did to make you so angry.”
“Well, I suppose that answers that then, don’t you think?”
were you?” Blaise taunted, hopping over Harry’s legs as he neared his blushing friend.
Harry jumped at the sudden voice, turning to find Draco standing in the doorway, an expression too elaborate for him to figure out painted across his face. Their eyes met, and Harry felt his shoulders stiffen as Draco seemed to dissect every inch of his face as if carefully observing some great puzzle. What was he looking for?
“Oh dear... and this is why I always take the floo, boys. Portkeys are much more disorienting.” She breathed, seeming mostly recovered from the bout of nausea as she pulled out her wand and, with one swift movement, lit the handkerchief on fire. Draco watched the cinders fall distantly, only being brought out of the nausea-induced haze by Harry’s firm hand on his shoulder, guiding him towards the treeline where he finally noticed there were magical tents set up all along, spanning back into a massive field. Voices filtered over towards him as they slowly, steadily, walked towards the beginning of the tents. Draco could start to see people milling about, either in strange muggle attire that Harry kept giggling at, or typical quidditch regalia. As they started trekking through the walls of tents, and as the noise started getting louder and louder as they got closer and closer to the stadium, more and more people appeared out of the woodwork, the outfits getting more ridiculous the further in they went.
“I do wish we could reconnect, Nicolas. I am deeply regretful for how I have treated you in the past.”
“This year…”
loud. Everything. Every little sensation felt
The man with icy blue eyes leaned back in his chair, his dark hair falling into those unsettling eyes as he regarded Tom with a patient look. Tom didn’t reply verbally, instead just sitting there, waiting. The blue-eyed man seemed satisfied with his answer, and continued.
“Three…”
Harry looked so tired, and defeated, and-
“Harry Potter? Well yes, I suppose it could be.”
Marvolo grinned, slowly beginning to laugh as the sun set on Riddle Manor, and the sounds of night slowly converged onto him. He had cast the killing curse without so much as a blip from the ministry, so surly summoning an inkwell and quill would not be too terribly difficult, yes? What was summoned paper in the face of eternal rest? An owl would hardly be an issue either, so easy to force into compliance with the right incentives.
Harry’s arms around him were firm and steady, and absolutely necessary as he pulled Draco up from where they had both fallen to the floor. Draco stumbled slightly at the sudden motion, lurching as a sudden bout of nausea washed over him. His vision span, and as his stomach curled his hand slought out Harry’s own, finally finding and gripping it tightly as he attempted with scrambling limbs to right himself.
Harry was… big. He had always been fantastically tall, sure, but now he looked less like a long piece of string and more like a massive oak tree. He wasn’t colossal in body mass by any means, still having that slender build that seemed to fit him so perfectly, but his shoulders were… broad, very broad, and his entire face seemed to have filled out slightly, taking the angular look he had been so synonymous with and doubling its effect. The large-ness of him seemed to be merely elevated by his height, which was still, for lack of a better term, utterly ridiculous.
Harry’s eyebrows furrowed, “is that why you’re here a week early? No one ever thought to tell Nicolas exactly why you needed to come sooner you know, we were all rather curious. Do you need a place to stay over the hols? What even happened?”
Voices quickly came back over him again, arguably louder than before, but he was gloriously saved from it all, held back and away from his senses by his mind as it worked furiously to hide away from the unfamiliar scenery. He couldn’t focus on anything. His ears were dulling, the voices and noises falling away into low, muffled background noise. His eyes stayed unfocused and indistinct and he couldn’t help but watch with idle enjoyment as blurs of quidditch players flew past. His eyes were focused on the vague place in front of him, not the players, but he could still make sense of what they were doing. It was strange, he could tell. The scope of his vision—the way that his eyes were taking in the world around him—it felt unfamiliar to how he had been allowed to see for the past decade. It felt almost... fallible.
Immediately it became apparent that had
Seemingly sensing his gaze, the boy turned to look at him, face lit by candlelight and green eyes narrowed with blatant revulsion. Barty stumbled slightly, taken by surprise by the unfamiliar expression as it became unmistakable to him. Those eyes… they were similar,
Due to a nerve related back issue, as well as the amount of school work that I am currently dealing with (and will likely continue to deal with till I graduate high school in June) I have decided that I will need another week to wrap up How Fate Intended and officially move onto making chapters for Creature of Winter. However, after that week I believe that, again, only until I graduate, chapters will have to be written and posted once (or maybe twice) a week instead of every other day. The normal chapter upload speed will resume after that when my schedule is completely freed up.
“I… uhm… ‘ello.” He muttered, gaping like a fish as the old lady grabbed him around the wrist and pulled him forcefully through the door, her unnaturally purple eyes lighting up with glee as the red door swung shut behind them.
green eyes, glowing with anger and a tantalizingly familiar curiosity.
The spell broken, Harry gazed out into the empty hallway, rocked to his core and seconds away from destroying either a wall or himself. The air was impossibly still, dead as a corpse and rotting just the same. His hands shook as he slowly lowered himself to the floor, his fingers clumsily seeking out stability as he eased himself down onto the cold stone, finding frost and sleet and shards of glass-like ice waiting for him there.
a sentient creature, it couldn’t want anything from him besides dinner, right? Seers weren’t exactly difficult to find outside of Britain after all. It was hardly going to want him for his abilities.
“Why the hell not?”
“And now I...I just want to know if I’m alive or not. It feels so horrible not being able to tell.”
Luna ignored the cheers that accompanied the announcement as she watched the not-Moody’s soul. She had sorted out why it was so excited, which was rather brilliant of her, but not how it related to the body the soul seemed to be inhabiting. Hadn’t Mad-Eye Moody been living a rather pleasant life in retirement ever since the war? There wouldn’t be much reason for him to keep his soul and magic constrained for that time.
“Oh, so you admit that you’ve done something?”
“You’re utterly mad, Potter.”
There was a pause, “Hadrian Potter? You mean to say that
want them all to leave me
“Harry, we’re going to be late to the train if you keep standing there like a lump of wood.”
The smile widened, and the dimness that had come with Tom’s aggression was replaced by a light not unlike the reflection of the sun’s rays off of ice. Tom felt that Harry belonged in those eyes.
The elderly man wearing the insulting drab jumped slightly in surprise, before turning around to face him. “Nicolas? My, what a wonderful surprise this is! What are you doing here, my friend?”
free of guilt, blue eyes.” Tom threw the booklet away, masking his anger with cool indifference as the thin paper fluttered through the air for a moment before settling down on the cold tile floor a few feet away. The diadem horcrux eyed it with discomfort, as if seeing something so precious just laying there on the floor bothered him deeply.
“She would be incredibly bored.” The diadem horcrux finished the thought for him, the man’s smile very nearly breaking his face in two. “Very good Tom, very good. I must admit that I have only heard of Fate through you, but your argument is extremely compelling, and very likely. If she was half the monster you make her out to be, the destruction of our universe would come to her as a great annoyance, not a delight.”
“Of course, but that does not answer my question, Tom.”
Climbing down from his perch, Draco’s mind swam with thoughts of these mysterious books that Miss. Delacour was offering to him, and the questions that he might finally get answered inside of them. Would it be a wasted effort to try and meet with the woman when he was in France? Harry likely wouldn’t find issue with it, but Draco was loath to attempt to leave his soulmate’s side during the short few days that he would have him. Would such a meeting even be worth it? He didn’t know, though perhaps if he wrote the woman a letter asking his questions he would be able to see if she was genuine or just full of herself. Harry certainly seemed to trust her, which gave him a positive outlook on any future correspondence between them, and her letter was-while rather blunt and to the point-very effective and pleasant enough.
Red over red over red.
“Oh of course Nicolas, do not think so little of me, please.” She admonished lightly, waving her hand through the air as if waving away his words, a habit she adopted from Perenelle over the years. He huffed out a laugh, raising his own hands in assent.
“Oh not at all! I’m just writing a letter.” She chirped, immediately looking back down to add a dash of blue to an empty space on the parchment. Theo raised an eyebrow, momentarily forgetting what he had come up to do as she began humming a tune again. Luna had never written to him of course, since she seemed to prefer speaking in person and they hadn’t spent much time apart in the week or so he had been home for the summer, but surely she didn’t write all of her letters like... that?
Harry nodded sharply, “yes. I, ah, I’m still waking up. About that tea…?”
She laughed then, cheery and wonderful and so kind that it made his chest physically ache. Merlin, he would miss this woman. “Won’t your muggle family get rather upset if we stole you away like that? They haven’t seen you for about a year now, you know.”
“How did you even find that much blood… oh.” Nicolas and Perenelle were born at the cusp of the thirteen hundreds, just in time for the bubonic plague. “You took it from the bodies during the Black Death, didn’t you.”
his magic. Poor lad really shouldn’t have expended his core so egregiously, though I suppose it couldn’t be helped.”
Besides, necromancy was its own magic, and he didn’t want to risk mixing it up with the untainted blood of muggles if he did end up using it. Perhaps that was a good enough reason to avoid the magic’s use.
“Oh, bloody fucking shi-”
Draco felt like the world was crashing down around him.
Or perhaps it returned to its master. He supposed it didn't really matter much in the end.
“I didn’t want it to go like this, Dray. You understand that right?” He mumbled, eyes trained on the vague outline of Draco’s loafers. “When I first got the letter, I was going to go straight to you, but…”
No, cold wasn’t the right word to describe the emotions racing through them both. They were hard, stiff, unyielding feelings, bogged down by shock and fear to the point that all Harry could do was take the brunt of it so Draco could actually
Nicolas bit the inside of his cheek to stop the sarcastic quip that was threatening to bubble up from his throat. “I am here to see Olympe on her request. I suppose you are here for the same reason?”
Theo felt unease slowly creep up from his chest at the woman’s words, starting to connect the dots between the events of the past year and her admissions as they came spilling out of her mouth. He glanced down to the smooth stones laid out on the desk, and reached for a honey-colored one, feeling compelled towards a familiar shade as absurdity rained down around him.
the time to patronize me. You know my reasons all too well, you bloody hypocrite.” He finally bit out, turning on his heel as the words hung heavy in the still air for a moment. He sighed, falling back onto the wall across from the blasted door and slowly sliding down it. Calm. He just needed to stay calm. He needed to get a grip on his emotions before he
He mused, skipping up the stairs quickly as Luna’s voice started to become audible. He faltered for a moment, straining his ears to hear what she was saying without any luck. He stood cautiously for a moment, before starting towards the room with near-silent footfalls. Nearing the door, he slowed to a stop outside of it, knocking cautiously as he realized that the noises he was hearing was the girl
“Right… uhm… Harry! Flint graduated last year, and I heard that after the Firebolts came out and you bought a load of them for the Quidditch team he named you as his preferred successor. So, how do you feel about taking up the King position?” He tried again, perking up as he got a genuine reaction out of his friend. Harry blinked at him slowly for a moment, sluggish, and Blaise was pleased to watch as the usually sharp boy’s mind sludged tiredly towards an answer. He could practically
He leaned back in his chair, watching as she quickly rounded the table and sat down across from him, expression gentle and eyes knowing. Harry brushed a hand down his face, picking up frozen tears on his way down. He let out a huff of a laugh, eyes gazing around the room for something to focus on other than her kind, wonderful, understanding face.
“Oh sure, and I suppose those wrinkles on your face are from old age as well?”
Death's eyes are really important to the story, so I spent quite a bit of time on them in order to do them justice. I think that, while kinder than Fate, Death is not exactly partial towards humans, and is actually completely
“Good… yes, very good. I suppose you should get a move on now, yes?” She muttered, almost to herself. Draco spared a glance at his father to see the man’s reaction, noting a tense jaw and furrowed brows. He didn’t know if that meant his father was upset with his mother’s actions or just thinking-it was just too difficult to discern.
“You’re shallow, Theodore Nott! Extremely, foolishly shallow!”
(See the end of the chapter for
He closed his eyes, breathing in a deep breath to try and steady himself and sort the thoughts running rampant through his mind. An icy chill encompassed both of his hands, snaking up and wrapping around his wrists as well. He peaked an eye open, watching as Harry rubbed a soothing circle into the palm of his sweaty hand with the pad of his thumb. Draco’s eyes followed the movement, observing his soulmate’s long, cold hands as they moved slowly, like a glacier, and in tandem with his heartbeat.
She laughed, almost reminiscent, as she picked up one of the almond croissants she had baked the day before, off of the plate of other confections she had insisted on for breakfast. He watched her take a bite of it before his attention was taken back by the slowly rising sun, it seemed to have just barely started to peak over the distant hills, though it was too early to tell.
of my head?”
Was she going to be able to ignore the itch?
August fell away in a blaze of glory.
Diadem horcrux: Thomas. Nickname(s): the blue-eyed man, the man with icy blue eyes, blue eyes
They stared at each other for a moment, before Harry slowly nodded, somber. Nicolas smiled tightly, before immediately turning back around to his notes as if nothing had been said at all. “You’re free to go. Please come back in an hour to check on the potion with me. You did place it by the window, yes?”
Harry sighed deeply, filling his empty chest cavity with air as he glanced out to Draco from behind his hand. His soulmate. His angel. Draco had promised time and time again to always stick by him, no matter what happened, and Harry had promised the same. Come the new year, he would carry Draco through the hardship and the backlash the best he could, if only to prove to himself that he wasn’t a monster, at least not yet.
He sighed, adding in the last of the Anjelica herb as his visibility dropped lower still, forcing him to wave his hand around in the air to try and clear it. Realizing the effort was ineffective, and further acknowledging that any exterior magic that he might use to try and clear the air would potentially ruin the potion, Harry allowed himself to groan tiredly before focusing on the color of the smoke around him, finding with relief that it seemed to be the correct hue.
He looked again to Nicolas, who seemed to be waiting for his response. Sighing, Harry rubbed a hand down his face, no doubt smearing some sort of soot or more likely ink across his cheek. “I’m sure whatever you’re going to ask me is morals related, to which I say: save your breath.”
“Try to survive without me, then.” He replied instead, his voice a bit more strained than he would have liked. Draco’s hand settled at his elbow, the shorter boy silently guiding him towards the fireplace as he started to blather on. “I’ll be sure to be as miserable during morning meals as possible—in solidarity with you.”
Albus doubted that Harry Potter, even being the bright boy he was, would be able to manage bringing Voldemort back to life on school grounds without Albus finding out in some way. No, he doubted that the boy was even aware that Tom had risen, though it seemed likely that he was somewhat aware of the man taking residence inside his mind. Albus frowned angrily, settling down behind his desk with a thump. If not for those hex bags, he would have been able to remember exactly how Harry Potter had been acting after the death, but he couldn’t recall even glancing the boy’s way. He would have to observe the child for some time before coming to a conclusion on the extent of his bodily autonomy, though considering how Tom operated Albus doubted that the boy had much control over himself.
the fact that the wendigo is supposed to be slathered in blood, so I bit the bullet and found a tutorial online (and then found myself really enjoying the drawing after figuring it out). I guess this is just a lesson on testing your boundaries and doing what you wouldn't have done before just because you were scared it wouldn't work out well.
“Why would you trust him if you didn’t know why you trust him?”
Lest his rather short attention span be squandered by examining a piece of lint in the carpet, Narcissa made quick work of the rest of her skirts, revealing the rest of her copious amounts of legs to her utterly enraptured husband from where he laid, sprawled quite pathetically, across his own office’s floor. Crawling forward, she took his champagne-soaked blazer in both hands and settled happily into his lap, tugging off the imposing piece of fabric as he made an admirable attempt to remove her corset.
“I’ll get to that soon enough Harry. Do be patient.” Nicolas pulled away from the main table in the middle of the room to receive a large pitcher of water, which he used to fill up the empty glass. “Now, back to my question for you Harry. Please be honest.” The man then reached for his wand, and without hesitation he whipped it forward and shouted something in what Harry could only assume was Greek. Almost immediately there was a shift in the air, and Nicolas’ frail body lurched as a vaguely copper-y stream of magic was seemingly ripped from his wand and entered the glass of water. Harry held back his instincts to help, instead standing back and watching as the water inside of the glass started to darken and cloud until it had the vague coloring of silt. Only then did Nicolas break the connection, and Harry started forward to help him as he staggered.
Well, not really, but Harry wished it had. He wished that a lot of things had happened during the month of August, to be perfectly honest with himself. He wished that he had sorted through all of the loose ends and had tied them off, leaving a few dangling issues to be dealt with during the school year but nothing glaringly obvious or particularly time-consuming. He wished that he had been able to finish a letter to Lucius Malfoy, instead of breaking five quills and spilling ink over the parchment, ruining the entire thing before giving up, only to start the entire process over the next day. He wished he had been able to get an actual, genuine reply from Griphook, who had sent him nothing but paperwork over paperwork over more bloody paperwork that all had to be signed and sent back to Gringotts in order to give Draco the Black lordship without having to speak on the issue with his magical guardian, all in a reasonable amount of time and without tugging out the majority of his hair. He wished that he had been able to do a lot of things over the month of August, but the truth of the matter was woefully lacking in anything but a big heaping mess of delirious nonsense.
There was a mix of admiration and terror on Crouch’s face as Harry climbed the ladder—a certain fearful loyalty that Harry was positive had been born from his little melt-down the week prior. He grimaced slightly as he clambered out of the trunk, brushing himself off tiredly as the trunk’s lid slid shut behind him. He didn’t
A shift in the air made him whoop, and he opened his eyes wider, feeling more than seeing as he started to slow down. Feeling the sudden stop seconds before it happened, Harry kicked a leg out, feeling it plant onto solid ground seconds later. He pushed forward instinctively, the purple flames quickly falling away as a familiar, bustling platform crowded his vision. Platform 9¾ was
Fleur : "Je déteste vous déranger Madame Perenelle, mais j'ai toujours eu un amour pour les potions et-"
Harry spoke to empty air, staring blankly at the large expanse of wall across from him. The basement was confined. At least, that was the best way he could describe it. It weaved in the way that an anthill did, and likely felt just as compressed, with winding halls that were both too short and too narrow for him to comfortably maneuver through. He honestly didn’t know why it was called a basement and not a dungeon or, hell, maybe just a tunnel system, but assumed there were reasons that Nicolas and Perenelle had settled on ages prior. It could be for tax purposes, for all he knew. Regardless of the reason behind the name, he didn’t enjoy spending time down in weaving, tomb-like halls. And, honestly, if it weren’t for his current, particularly pressing issue, he would surely be up in the study with Draco, pouring over legal documents and law books as he had been before the damned Quidditch World Cup threw a Barty Crouch shaped wrench into all his plans.
“Inexplicably. Why do you ask?”
Heeeey... so I got food poisoning (salmonella) early last week, which is why I didn't update (I was too busy vomiting up my intestines) but I'm all better now and officially terrified of eggs. Anyway, I felt bad about all that, so I decided to change some things and take something from the next chapter to put into this one, as well as add some more depth to make the chapter longer and more interesting.
Harry stared out the window, watching as a few hummingbirds zipped to and fro from one flower to the next, sucking up all the nectar they possibly could from the garden. The sun was just barely rising from above the treeline, and the sounds of morning and life were slowly overtaking the whispers of the night. Harry watched it all with growing detachment, eyes trained on the hummingbirds as they whizzed from one flower to the next.
That familiar nickname, however, was not a comfort, considering how close Tom’s voice was to his ear.
Harry winced, reaching out to take the outstretched hand in a companionable shake. He had seen himself growing steadily over the past few weeks after eating Ginny, to the point that he had been magically lengthening his pants each day so his ankles wouldn’t show through. He was a tad bit scared to get out a tape measure and see if Sirius’ guess held any water, but nodded sheepishly anyway.
“How am I being ignorant!”
to his maneuvering. Besides, while Albus had certainly made his disgust of Greyback clear over the years, there was no real reason for the werewolf to go to such lengths to kill one little girl and frame Lupin, especially considering his tendency to ‘turn them young’. So there
He laughed, following behind Tom as the man led him down to the chamber. “So what’s the issue then?”
because you are a natural-born leader and it would be a
The warm summer air hung low around him, falling like silk over his shoulders. It was strangely comforting, like the gentle brush of curtains across his cheeks. It almost felt like the world was breathing soft puffs of warm air towards him, the magic in the air breathing out sluggish sighs as it wound sweetly towards slumber.
Which meant that it was dangerous.
“Come along then, you academic nuthouse. Perenelle went this way.”
“The child of darkness will snuff out the candle of deceit.”
“Don’t give me that look, Greengrass. You and Blaise are far more obscene than this.”
Trigger warning: physical and mental child abuse, off-screen verbal assault of a minor
“Harry,
“Alright, everyone settle down.” Her frown deepened at the headmaster’s voice, and she glanced idly in his direction as a hush fell over the crowd of students. “As you all can see, Alastor Moody here—a very dear friend of mine—is joining our staff for this year. Please give him a warm welcome, for he will be your Defense Against the Dark Arts professor from this moment onwards!”
“Hadrian, if all goes well.”
“Oh Theo you’re here! Daddy didn’t give you too much trouble, did he?”
That had been precisely twelve minutes prior to the present, and now Harry was sat at the messy dining room table, tangled in two thick blankets and with a near-scalding cup of tea in his hand, as the two immortals stared at him with identical looks of scholarly fascination painted across their faces. He took a slow sip, savoring the subtle taste as Pernelle’s finger began to tap impatiently against the table. Neither of them had been considerate enough to explain how or why they had been in his room so early in the morning, but Harry could only assume that Nicolas had been wanting to start on the work for the day earlier than normal, and had decided to wake him. Either way, they had found him in a rather compromising position, that being ice cold and without a pulse. He wondered if they had noticed he wasn’t breathing first, then moved to touch him only to see how cold he was. Harry was certain that their first, and likely only, reaction was to use the elixir of life, which was clearly ineffective in the very least.
“You don’t remember that at all, do you?” A sudden voice piped up from his left, and he turned to glance forlornly at Daphne, who hugged his arm in response. “Don’t you ever wonder about your poor memory, love?”
how could anyone
His feet hit the dry earth below the tree, and Draco took a moment to readjust his too-short trouser legs before setting off towards the manor, his mind awash with new possibilities and exciting notions. As he walked, his hand found the brooch in his pocket, and squeezed it tightly.
“Finally connected the dots, Potter?”
the soul stayed in the place of the lost limb before realizing slowly that it was no longer there, and thus receded back into the rest of the body. The man hobbling down the walk had to have lost his leg mere minutes ago, for his soul to still be acting like he had two of them!
“Well… I suppose we ought to keep an eye out then.” He finally replied, eliciting a morose hum from Daphne, who seemed all too ready to start unraveling this new mystery of the year. She left it be though, at least for the time being, though he kept catching her sending Harry quizzical glances through the entire carriage ride. He didn’t think Harry was even paying attention to her though, too busy quietly whispering with Draco about something or another.
"Regarde ce garçon Fleur, il est si grand!" A young voice piped up from the door, and Harry was broken from the thought of Draco in skinny jeans as he registered a familiar name.
“Uh-huh. Piss off.”
around the Greengrass estate. Whispers that did
Theo froze stiff as the purple pouch was set in front of him, unassuming and utterly mind-shattering. He looked from it to the old crone and back again, before taking a sharp breath and reaching for the small pouch of coins strapped to his belt.
Harry pushed his way down the uneven steps, not taking much care in being gentle as people tried to elbow past him. Draco was blathering excitedly about the match as they descended, occasionally throwing a very enthusiastic elbow at the passing person whenever they got just a bit too close for his liking. It was a chaotic affair, and the noise was much,
that Lupin was innocent, but all other attempts to come up with a reasonable explanation for the death resulted in such an absurd thought train that any other explanation was utterly absurd. It was an inescapable scenario for him, in which no matter what he said, there were only two options: either Lupin be convicted for a murder that he did not commit, or for Albus officially come forward and explain why Lupin had to be innocent. Even worse, since he himself was the one who had freed Lupin that morning, if he were to try and do the second choice, it was all too likely that people would start to doubt if he was not somehow directly involved in the death as well.
Ten thousand men. And then hundreds after that every few centuries for the rest of time.
Tom.” The locket hissed, its reptilian eyes glaring hatefully at him as it craned its neck in an odd angle, staring up at him from the floor. “I’m speaking with Tommy, my baaaaby brother.
“Oh this is just ridiculous. Hadrian, you need to explain yourself
to say about the spicy magic and general carnage that had happened so early in the morning.
She smiled, closing her eyes and sinking further into the mossy earth underneath her as the sun warmed her cheeks and bare legs. It was delightfully hot out today, and they had dressed up in swim wear that Theo had regarded as ‘obscene’ and had taken off to the little pond. Luna was dressed in a lovely little blue and pink one piece swimsuit that she had seen in a muggle shop while in Clovelly, and a pair of bleached out bermuda jean shorts that some random muggle girl on the beach had gifted her. They were about three sizes too large and the edges were all frayed so that strings of fabric tickled her legs, but they looked far too fun for her to resist wearing now that it was nice and hot out.
“But it doesn’t make sense! It makes, quite literally, the least amount of sense out of
He wondered what was going to come of the next year, beyond the same old delirious madness he had grown used to.
“Theo’s already left me. The rest are sure to follow if I keep letting things slip.” He murmured, the tired admission feeling more like a forced confession as the weight of memories and passing time pressed down onto his back.
“Merlin, those things are ghastly.”
“Oh merlin.”
It had been an idea that he had brought up months before-during yule, or at least sometime near it-and it had taken months of patent prodding over letters and long winded reasonings for his grandfather to eventually agree that it might be healthy for him to spend the summer in a place with a little more life to it. Of course, it had taken quite a bit longer for Theo to convince him that the Lovegood household would be the most lively place for him to go, but the man had eventually allowed it on the condition that Theo stay the first week at home first. He still thought that the old man wasn’t happy about the arrangement, as he had been rather frosty towards Theo over the past week, but he didn’t care. They had already decided and made the proper plans after all, and nothing that his grandfather ever said would manage to change his mind.
“I’m Tom, you loathsome regret.”
“Dray, are you alright?” Harry interrupted, his brows furrowed as Draco continued to write silently. The blond boy’s expression didn’t waver past a tightening of his jaw.
Daphne had originally been concerned that he might get homesick at some point, or might just miss the Italian sun, but he seemed to be having the time of his life. His schedule seemed incredibly erratic though, which concerned her somewhat. He would wake up at any time between five in the morning and two in the afternoon, so there was no telling if he would be awake before her or would sleep through lunch, and each day he spent as much time outside or exploring the estare as physically possible. She knew that he had been confined to his bedroom for months the previous summer, and his mother had made his life hell over the yule holidays as well, so she could only theorize that he was trying to allow himself as much freedom as physically possible while he still had the means to do so.
that it is different with the characters. I think that, in cases like this at least, if you try to keep close enough to the source material in an effort to stay true to the characters, what you're doing is not really
Harry’s eye twitched. Violently.
Draco : "Et tu es bien trop jeune et... femelle pour qu'il te voie d'une façon romantique, donc on dirait que j'ai de bien meilleurs chances, non?"
“So you have then? Good good, I was certain you had, but my daughter was unsure. Of course, my dear moon had yet to see Her, so that is no surprise.”
“But enough of that! I have many more plants that need watering, and my back has grown weak in my old age.”
He creaked open the door slowly, peeking his head in to find her sprawled out across the floor, a piece of parchment and at least four jars of half-empty glitter surrounding her. The parchment was, while already nearly drenched in ink from the large loopy lettering of Luna’s handwriting, further weighed down by a substantial amount of glitter. The girl glanced up at him, her face sparkling with different colors of glitter and likely just a smattering of glue.
“I… um.”
but just like how it was with Luna, it was not something that he himself could see.
“Dray, I think you need to explain-”
There was a pause. For a moment even Blaise was caught off guard, before he was swiftly snatched back up by utter delight.
“... but I did, didn’t I?”
The bloody ponce had the gall to snort at him! Draco bit the inside of his cheek, and as Perenelle bent over to grab one of the many pastries lining the table between them, turned slightly and swiftly kicked Harry in the leg. The taller boy jerked in surprise, before laughing and whacking him in the arm in retaliation. Draco swatted the arm away, annoyed and embarrassed and incredibly fed up with himself.
“Enough of that Narcissa, let the boy go.” His father’s gruff voice spoke from behind them, and Draco couldn’t help but jump slightly as a large hand came down onto his shoulder and he was firmly pulled away from his mother's warm embrace. He glanced up at Lord Malfoy’s face, trying to discern the emotion there. They were… infinitesimal, if they even existed. He looked away quickly, suddenly feeling inadequate.
Blinking away the tears, he finally got a good look at the door as Tom started to speak. “Because the horcrux and I have the same magic, taking down the physical and magical wards that I place on the door is easy enough for it. That’s why I need your help.” He took the hand off Harry’s shoulder, using it to rub the water out of his own eyes as he continued. “If we combine our efforts it will be much easier to keep him out for long stretches, and we might even manage a permanent solution if given enough time.”
“You won’t ever leave, right Harry? Not even if you'd die if you stay?” Draco whispered, sounding so small and fragile that it nearly made Harry break down again. Instead, he steadied himself, pulling Draco closer somehow as he rested his chin on the other boy’s messy blond head. They had both been reduced to something less than themselves that day. The least he could do was stay steady as Draco fell through the cracks of his own mind.
It had been built at a time that wizards tended to take themselves very seriously, and took that pompousness and attempted to incorporate it into their family homes. Because of that, the late Duncan Nott-who had been tasked with designing and building the family home-had decided to take several rather unnecessary liberties. The man had decided to ‘honor’ his family by building the home in twisting and nonsensical patterns not unlike a, well, knot. Some tried to argue that he had done this to attempt to confuse invading forces, just as how the founders of Hogwarts had done, but everyone who lived in Nott Manor knew the truth.
Theo went still, watching with narrowed eyes as the man sped around the house as if looking for something. “Who is ‘Her’?”
Draco didn’t even bother raising an eyebrow as Harry stormed into the room, the tall boy looking incensed past the point of reason as he stormed across the room before stiffly sitting down, perched at the edge of the couch next to Draco as if he would jump back up again at any moment, his lithe fingers angrily working along the folds of some medical tape as he furiously bandaged his knuckles with it. Draco did raise an eyebrow at that, however, setting aside the book he had been reading—one of the tomes that Fleur had gifted him on Harry’s birthday—before regarding his soulmate with a quizzical expression.
“Yeah, for you!”
She scoffed at him, pointing at a nearby plate of toast with a firm expression. “That burnt piece of toast right there is more of a lady than I am, Mr. Potter. Do watch your tongue.”
“Hum?”
has proved that a soul and therefore a consciousness can be split into several smaller pieces, and your son’s inner demon has proved that one consciousness can be melded with another to create something entirely new. This is proven through his new lack of human consciousness. That is to say, the consciousness that made Hadrian James Potter a human, has been changed in a way that is fully irreversible. His consciousness does not align with that of society, and considering his most recent decision to willingly slaughter thousands of innocent people, I would wager that the change goes even further than that. Perhaps his new consciousness is, in itself, against mortality. Perhaps, instead of simply being an Other in terms of society, Hadrian is an Other in terms of the laws of nature itself. Does that make sense, Tom?”
that proved that belief correct? Had he done a single thing to prove his worth?
“This is your fear of death, then?” That was what the booklet detailed, at least. It was the fear-fueled ramblings of a soul that desperately wished to continue living despite the non-life that it existed in. The horcrux across from him clenched the tea cup in his hands tighter at Tom’s words, his face twisting from the infuriating calm that had been there through the entirety of their conversation into something more emotional. Something angry.
"Je veux aller lui parler Fleur! S'il te plaît?" There. He heard the name clear as day. Harry cursed under his breath as he connected the dots and began scrambling to set the pile of clothes down in the least ridiculous manner possible.
Theo shook his head, reaching cautiously for the red and brown spotted quill as Blaise watched over his shoulder. “But it’s more than that. These are extremely expensive and of high quality, and I only have so much money for the summer. I need to make sure what I get is really what I want.”
“Bring it off the heat and let it settle, and leave the window open for ventilation.”
“Merlin, that was worse than the first time!” Draco shouted over the noise, his face appearing a little pale as he grabbed Harry's elbow for support. Harry laughed brazenly, brushing some soot from his shoulder as they began pushing their way through the crowd.
“I know.”
Barty took a long, deep breath in, savoring the feeling of being alone in his mind as the song of crickets grated against his eardrums. He would survive this. His lord was angry, yes, but not cruel, at least not yet. He would withstand the night in the basement happily, and then everything would be fixed in the morning. His lord would fix everything, and the man’s unknown companions would soon find him trustworthy as well. All would be as it is supposed to be. Barty was sure of it.
Two brothers discuss the detrimental nature of gossip as plans are made for an uncertain future that, for Theodore Nott, is far blurrier than it has ever been.
It was all completely absurd, and in a bout of rebelliousness, Draco decided that he loved it.
All the muttering from the other students suddenly ceased as the man spoke, gruff and intimidating and Luna nearly jumped up with fury. That was
Draco nodded in agreement, knowing that if he was able to find a broom fast enough he likely would as well. “Do you fly often? I’m on the Slytherin Quidditch team so it’s a passion of mine.”
“Yes, alright, I did. How funny. Now, do me a lovely favor and sod off!”
Dressing quickly, he was out the bedroom door and down the stairs in a sparse few minutes, speed-walking through the memorabilia-ridden halls of the Flamel estate as the soulbond continued to throb and pulse with agitation. His pace quickened as he practically
“Well of course you think that way honey! You are, after all, being willfully ignorant.”
She could ignore the itch for now, while they were at her home and safe. She could ignore it while they were sitting out in this little patch of field where the garden meets the forest beyond, sunbathing and relaxing and living in the way that they deserved to do.
had to be happening to him.
A lightning bolt scar.
“Very good Draconis, I wish you well in France.”
The fact was driving him
Harry laughed, confusion lacing his tone. “What? Dray, are you… alright? Was that too much too soon?”
“Not before the Quidditch world cup, I would wager.” Said Tom, his voice edging towards amused as he spoke from… behind him-?
“Oh that is
The blond boy sighed, leaning back in his seat and crossing his arms again. Harry didn’t know what to say, caught halfway between panic and frustration as Draco’s words sank in. It was an impossible scenario, one sticking him between Draco’s feelings and Draco’s right to know everything that entailed him and his future. Harry took a deep breath in, and then another one, before giving up. It still did nothing for him.
Malfoy manor felt colder than usual, especially for such a hot summer day. It seemed like the striking Lady Malfoy was feeling the shift in atmosphere as well, as she seemed hesitant to let the men of the house leave for the extended periods of time that they had planned for. Draco forced himself not to swat her hand away, knowing that it would be difficult for her to be in such a large house without him or his father as company. Really, it was rather poor luck that Harry’s birthday had lined up perfectly with the week-long Arenbelum Convention in Amsterdam that his father was set to speak at, and even worse now that Draco was leaving a week early for France, leaving his mother without any human comfort for an entire week more than planned. Draco was certain that it had been a long time since his mother had ever been left to her own company for so long, especially considering that Draco wouldn’t be back to the manor till as late as Yule.
Next chapter will have a Barry POV because of course it will.
Harry would be able to tell her who the Woman is.
He whispered to himself, half focused on the fascinating discovery and half concerned for Harry and his apparent anger. It was the taller boy’s birthday after all, what was there to be angry about? Many things, he supposed, but not so early in the morning. Draco sighed, forcing his gaze away from the bolts of red as the green and gold seemed to throb, the anger dissipating and being suddenly replaced with… sadness? Frustration? Draco scrunched up his nose, trying to settle on an emotion that he could comprehend with a surprising lack of luck. It seemed that, most plainly, Harry was feeling so many different things at once that the boy himself likely couldn’t even sort one feeling from the other.
He nodded, handing her the glass before sitting back down. She took a slow sip, contemplating the news. “I had no idea you were familiar with the boy. I know you and Perenelle are private people, Nicolas, but wouldn’t that knowledge becoming public do very well for your image?”
Harry didn’t quite know what to say to that, and continued to stare blankly at the immortal as she giggled with undisguised mirth. If his heart had stopped, then why did he still have his magic? He didn’t want to say her logic was flawed, but it seemed that his general existence seemed to betray her belief instead of solidifying it.
And Harry was the one being told. Not Draco, not the Flamels themselves, but Harry. Just him.
Draco froze, feeling his father’s grip tighten further as the man’s gaze bore into the side of his head. What could his father possibly need to talk to Harry about? Did he somehow find out about their... relationship? Draco felt perspiration spread across the back of his neck, a cool sweat breaking out as his father’s gaze seemed to sharpen and gain intensity every second that he did not answer.
A huge thank you to my translators Dacraun and idontevenknowyou for their amazing help with this! (you two are the best)
“I never said that I did-”
to her.
be his friend. And Blaise had realized that as long as he could say that, Harry’s personal secrets didn’t matter a whole bunch. The boy clearly had a good reason for keeping them, and Blaise was completely understanding of why that might be. They all deserved to keep personal things, well,
“International floo is wretched at best, Hadrian, let the boy take a seat.” A cheery woman’s voice echoed through the room, rattling his skull painfully as it forced its way through his ears. Draco raised his hands up and pressed the heels of them into his eyes, hissing with pain as stars danced across his vision and vague colors danced behind his retinas. He was pushed down onto a reclined surface by Harry’s hands, held steady there as he was forced to lay back onto his wings. He shifted so it wasn’t terribly uncomfortable before sighing, muttering a likely indiscernible explanation about the blasted purple floo powder that had surely been the cause for his current state.
“I understand that Harry. But, please, humor me.”

“He shouldn’t be my problem to deal with, Tom.”
He sighed, leaning back till his head hit the cushion of his chair. It always seemed to be about his image. What would be good and what would be bad. Couldn’t he just be left in peace to work?
He jerked, caught off guard by the sudden voice as the short boy beside his lord spoke up, peeking out from behind his lord and leveling an accusatory glare his way. Barty blinked at the shadowed figure, trying to piece together an understanding of the child’s relationship with his lord, or perhaps his lord’s vessel? It seemed unlikely that a Malfoy would bother with Harry Potter, though perhaps harboring his lord’s soul made the boy more appealing to the family.
“Hadrian, do you remember what we were speaking of just last week? About soul mates and immortality?” Perenelle’s voice was soothing, and so incredibly loud in the silent room that he nearly jumped in surprise at the sound of it. Her’s were the hands holding his own, steady and firm despite how he knew she must be pained by the temperature of his skin. Gathering himself, Harry nodded, swallowing down the tears as they threatened to erupt.
Draco made movement to stand, but was stopped short suddenly by a hand on his arm. All three of them turned to Harry, the tall boy blinking blearily from his spot on the bench as he rubbed at his eyes. He seemed only half-awake, and looked as though they had personally offended him by speaking. Draco seemed to observe the tall boy’s expression, before he scoffed, loudly. Sending a glare Blaise’s way, he gently removed Harry’s hand from his arm and summoned his book back from Blaise’s side of the compartment, glaring pointedly in the Italian’s direction before settling his rump back down onto the compartment seat. The tall boy beside him blinked owlishly at the motion, before closing his eyes again and resting his head back on its perch.
He felt eyes on him.
“It isn’t fair! It just isn’t

“Our own...
“Hadrian, just because muggles do not have magic of their own, does not mean that they can not live without it. A magical human does not die if they lose their magic, just as a muggle can exist without it. Just because a ‘soul’ is thought to be someone’s life force, does not mean that it is actually someone’s
“But did I not just-”
“-and you will write to us, won't you?”
“I’d love to go, Dray. Thank you.” Harry interrupted him, taking one of the tickets with a smile that seemed almost bemused. They locked eyes for a moment, and the bewilderment almost immediately softened to something else, something familiar, and gentle. Draco waited for a moment, before sticking out his tongue.
“Albus.”
it’s not like that! Besides, didn’t you spend the entire bloody summer break at Greengrass manor? You are in no position to be treating me this way.” Draco hissed, a triumphant expression creeping its way across his face as Daphne blushed prettily. Blaise rolled his eyes, caught between admiring the bashfulness on Daphne’s face or continuing to tease the life out of his friend.
Harry didn’t think that either of the Flamels could be hypocritical on the basis of murder, considering where their own immortality came from, but there was so much more to his situation that he wasn’t completely sure they would even believe. How would he be able to explain how he had come into his creature inheritance in the first place, especially when Nicolas had done such an intensive deep-dive into the Peverell family in order to research the Deathly Hallows? He would, in the very least, have to tell the pair that he was already the Master of Death, though there was no possible way for him to explain how he had come into contact with all three of the Hallows in order to meet Death in the first place, especially since he hadn’t even considered retrieving the resurrection stone for another few years, and Nicolas was under the assumption that neither of them knew where the hallows were located. And if he did manage to get around all of that without a single mention of time travel, then how would he explain the creature inheritance in the first place?
It was obvious to her now that Ginny had not been his first.
“Yes… so, I’ll be off now.” He stated, wincing slightly at the terseness to his voice. This was hardly a good way to cap off his time with his parents, though neither of them seemed terribly invested in changing the atmosphere into anything but unbearably tense.
when Blaise had sent along with a few vials of particularly potent dreamless sleep potion as well.
They seemed to be in agreement, at least that's what Tom thought. He had found through the years that the diadem horcrux was rather difficult for him to read, even though he remembered being that man himself. Perhaps it was the eyes, or the calmness that spoke of many decades of introspection, but Tom simply couldn’t see himself in the man that he shared so many conversations with. In the younger horcruxes he could easily see a relation, like the diary and Marvolo, but not the diadem. Never the diadem. He saw none of himself in that man besides for the slight curve of his lip when smiling or the particular way he took his tea. Everything else was foreign, and Tom doubted that his understanding would stop being that way after he reabsorbed the soul shard.
Blaise sighed, slouching further in his seat as the trolley witch tried to get the door open for the third time that evening. In all honesty, he did have quite a few questions for Harry—quite a few more than one should usually have for a friend—and while at first, it had made him incredibly upset to think that Harry didn’t trust him enough to know everything about himself, Blaise had realized something over the summer that he hadn’t even considered before: Harry does trust him. Maybe not with deep, personal secrets, but Harry had trusted him enough to ask him to send a bloody
“The gods think I need… help?” He questioned quietly, his eyes finally leaving the crowded wonders of the room to look at her again. Her eyes really were an unnatural purple. It felt like he was looking at something completely inhuman. Theo bit the inside of his cheek, realizing that he most definitely was. At least, if she truly did correspond with the gods. Her gaze glimmered unnaturally for a moment, and Theo got the sudden feeling that she knew exactly what he was thinking.
Harry could understand that there was a bit of a security breach being had inside Tom’s head, but still couldn’t quite understand how it had happened or why the man was so insistent on it being because of his horcrux gaining a body. Really, the man was terrible at explaining things to him, it would be so much easier for the both of them if he was honest. It would certainly help their communication skills.
The locket tried to yank away from his hand, whimpering like a wounded dog as he spoke. Tom’s grin widened as he basked in the sweet silence, his migraine finally receding slightly as he reached around the thing with his hand and grasped the back of the chair, lifting it back up into a sitting position with one swift movement. The locket’s eyes were wide and slightly panicked, and its mouth was wondrously, gloriously shut.
“Hadrian, if all goes well.”
He nodded, “and now it’s like this.”
Harry watched Draco’s face closely.
He murmured, turning to look at his ‘brother’ with gentle eyes. “Now come along, it’s time for you to go back to your vessel.”
“It’s quite alright dear. But I would like to speak with you extensively in the morning, if you wouldn’t mind?” The woman—Perenelle, he thought she had been called—replied, patting his still-numb arm gently as she led him forward.
“Merlin, this is dull. When is Theo getting here?”
She grit her teeth through the discomfort, rubbing at her eyes furiously for a sparse second longer before whipping her head up, eyes wide as saucers as she searched out that familiar, horrific sight of Harry’s soul. She found it easily, the mass of writhing colors and brilliant shapes. It washed over her, gentle and foreboding and impossible. Comforting and vast and knowing.
“Evening chap, are you Viktor Krum? It’s a pleasure.”
resonated through his mindscape. Hissing in pain, Tom threw his hands over his ears as the noise threatened to burst his head like a balloon. For several moments all he could do was sit there and let out puffs of air through his teeth, the dull noiselessness in his head slowly tapering off as it was replaced by a sharp ringing that niggled the back of his head. Stumbling out of his chair, Tom threw a hand out as the other one was left pressed into an ear, arm waving wildly for something to stabilize him as the ringing echoed through his skull and his eyes refused to open.
He glanced down at the unassuming thing, brushing a thumb down the blank, yellow-colored wax seal keeping it bound. Luna had never written to him before, not in his first life and certainly not in the second, so it had been rather strange to suddenly receive a letter from her. So strange in fact, that he had set it down and forgotten all about it for several days, swept up in the final preparations for his birthday and the other day-to-day leasures that he had been relishing in. Now though, he was waiting for the clock to strike midnight, and had nothing to do besides either read the bloody thing or a book.
No sane human, no matter how angry they were-no matter what sort of inheritances they had that might change them biologically-would be able to do that to someone else and live with themselves afterward. He wouldn’t excuse Harry for mutilating that poor girl to the point that the body was nothing but torn meat and bones, and he wouldn’t be backing down from his position, no matter what Luna or anyone else had to say on the matter.
“I suppose you don’t want to see him till September?” She stated, finally standing from the ground with her unsealed letter in hand. He watched as she got out a candle and wax melt, and began to warm up some wax to use as a seal.
A few people have asked this (which is way more than I honestly ever expected), but I am absolutely fine with fanart in any form as long as the artist shows me what they made, be it through a link in the comments or something personalized like an insta dm!
He hissed, anger expelling outwards like a burst of cold air. Ice crystallized the water particles around him as he hissed and spit and fought down the urge to rip his
“Marvolo. I want to be named Marvolo.”
She nodded once, taking only a moment to observe his shocked-still soul, before swiveling around on her heel and determinately walking the opposite direction. She cared deeply for him, she really did, but if he just wanted to see things a certain way and not admit that there is deeper truth underneath, then she was hardly going to sit around and agree with him.
Autocorrect very nearly killed me when it changed 'whacking' to wanking in the first scene. I hope you all realize how relieved I was when I saw that in editing and fixed it.
He only got a sparse second to look at the twisting, writhing mass of emerald green, before a hook was looped around his navel and the rising sounds of panicked screaming fell away in a blaze of light.
He scrambled up to his feet again, glancing furiously around the winding tunnel. “I’m not hallucinating this, Riddle. Why are you
“Right then.” Brushing his slightly stained shirt down, Draco took a moment to glare at his visible ankles, annoyed that the expanding charms on his clothing worked so slowly that they were practically ineffective when faced with a massive growth spurt like the one he was experiencing. Draco was happy that he was finally growing, sure, but considering that it was likely one of those massive growth spurts that everyone experienced at this age, and that Harry had been complaining about bumping his head into door frames in his letters, Draco was doubtful that he would look much taller standing next to anyone. Well, maybe he might look taller around the girls, but Theo was sure to have grown just as much if not more than him, so Draco was doubtful that this sudden growth would save him from the other boy’s teasing.
But… despite his battle with morality, he missed his friend. He missed Harry, and his quiet, amused expressions. He missed Draco and his… less quiet ones. He missed being forcibly corralled around by Draco without a second thought, pulled along to activities with such fervor that he could be comfortable pretending that he didn’t want to go. He missed how Harry understood him so effortlessly, how they understood
There was a flash of annoyance in those icy blue eyes, likely due to Tom’s disagreeing attitude. They stared at each other blankly for a nearly infinitesimal moment, before the blue-eyed man shook his head. “Just because he has no mortal consciousness does not mean he has no consciousness altogether, Tom. Do gods not show love? You’ve met at least one, as you’ve said many times before. Do gods not feel things for each other? Hadrian’s soulmate is connected to him with a string of pure soul matter, and the pair would quite literally shatter if one were to pass on. As Hadrian likely sees it, the Malfoy heir is not on the level of measly humans. He is Other, just as Hadrian is, and for that he needs to be cherished and kept safe. It is quite likely that the reason Hadrian wishes to make the Malfoy heir immortal is a mix of his own self-preservation and a subconscious desire to make his other half also an Other. He knows logically that Draco Malfoy is mortal and therefore not Other, and that knowledge is uncomfortable to him, so he wishes to change that fact for his own peace of mind.”
them?” He sputtered, trying to recall when
“Theodore, you know that everything I do for you is to benefit your future.”
Evening light streamed through the windows as he sprinted past them, acting as a strange nexus point between the past and present. In the present, it was just barely sunset, with the sky awash with glorious shades of reds and yellows and deep oranges. In the past, however, as he had rushed past those massive windows, the entire corridor had been bleeding with red streaks of light. But not in the present. No, Marvolo took sour notice of that discrepancy as he ducked around a corner, perfectly replicating the bombarda that he had cast at Lord Riddle’s legs. A piece of the floor imploded on itself in the present, but in the past Lord Riddle’s left leg had done the same, splattering bone fragments and gore all across his son’s ankles as the man screamed. Tom Riddle senior had not even glanced behind him, too focused on escape to care that he had just lost another of his parents, rendering him orphaned in a sense.
He sighed, before taking hold of it.
“Harry, let me read the letter.”
Harry looked down into his teacup, swirling the lukewarm liquid around as the leaves clumped up at the bottom. He stopped the movement, watching the whirlpool-like movement through the tea continued without his interference, before slowly crawling to a stop. The leaves swirled around indecipherably for a moment, before settling back to the bottom of the cup, motionless. Harry watched distantly as they settled, contemplating the last year of his life with steadily growing cynicism. He felt as if every action he had made embodied one of those tea leaves, and it was churning away in one big teacup, being thrown about a stormy sea.
Stiffening his spine, Draco cut a path through the palpable atmosphere towards the large fireplace, passing first his mother and then his father. Neither of them moved, as if moving would shatter the reality they currently lived in, and the inaction only drove Draco further forwards. If they wanted him gone so bloody bad, then he would go. Nearing the fireplace, he quickly set down one of his trunks, reaching for the internationally-specified floo powder balanced on the mantle as he began to compulsively speak.
“I love you.” He whispered, suddenly feeling like it was the only thing to say. Harry’s thumb didn’t stop the steady movements, though his one free hand squeezed Draco’s own.
Something about the way it moved was off-putting to him. It was… separate from the whole, if that was even possible. It felt incredibly different from the rest of Harry, in the most innate sense. It was
There was something different about it.
going mad. Maybe combining with his creature had been a bad idea, though it was hardly like he meant to do it. Maybe it was affecting his psyche negatively? Or maybe the combination of his argument with Theo, his birthday, Luna and Lord Malfoy’s letters, the apprenticeship with Nicolas, and everything in-between was finally getting to him.
“Focus on the most pressing concerns, Albus, and everything else will follow.” He reminded himself, straightening back up in his chair with a sigh. First, he would come to a decision on what to do about Lupin, now that the man was safely locked away in a safehouse where the ministry would not find him. If he decided to throw Lupin to the wolves, he would simply bring the man to the ministry with the pretext that he had hunted him down, feeling partially responsible for both the man’s crimes and his peculiar escape from law enforcement. If he decided to side with the man, then there would be much deliberation over what had to be done, but such a thing would take even more time to consider. The next thing to do would be to write to not only Hermione Granger, but to Madam Maxime as well, and open up a discussion between the two over Miss. Granger’s potential return to Hogwarts for a year. Perhaps he would argue that the girl had far too many friends still at Hogwarts, and forcing her away from them so suddenly would be unhealthy and cruel. If that didn’t work, he would go to Nicolas and try to save their withering friendship and ask the man for help.
Harry's horcrux ie. the OG: Tom Riddle. Repeat nickname(s) (there are a lot of one-offs): Riddle, Tom, and dad
amount of portraits, wall hangings, and indiscernible strips of pinned-up parchment hung along the walls. He hadn’t a clue what to focus on, his eyes darting between a perfectly respectable landscape painting and a large note written on parchment that said to buy more pig lard. Both of which seemed to be at least a century old, going by the style of the landscape and the age of the parchment. The furniture wasn’t much better, looking like an on-theme hodgepodge of different centuries all crammed together. There was what looked like a Greek chamber pot in the corner holding a bouquet of flowers, which was sitting right next to a victorian-esque side table, to name a particularly egregious assault to his eyes. Despite the strangeness of it all however, Draco couldn’t help but take it all in with awe, knowing that the people who lived in this house had collected all of the things there without a single thought towards how absurd it looked, simply using whatever was most convenient and popular at the time.
“Dray!”
of all people must have seen death. It was an absurd notion to him. It was a well-known fact that the Malfoys had sheltered their son far too strictly for him to have ever randomly come upon something like that.
Harry glared at the door, annoyed with the man behind it and the entire situation that had led him to this point. He hadn’t wanted to speak with Tom for at
“What is it?” He questioned quietly, watching as the sun refracted unnaturally through the stone. Her smile widened, as she handed the chain back to him.
Harry let out a sigh, closing his eyes as he pulled away from her warm embrace. “Thank you. I think… I think that I need to take some time after today just to think about things. A lot is going on right now that I don’t understand and need to start making sense of.”
Updated list of each soul shard that we have met, as well as their names:
Haha hello! It's me! I'm back! And graduated from high school literally two days ago! Finishing up my high school career was wayyyyy harder than I expected, which was why I went onto something of a 3 week hiatus there. But don't worry, I'm back to the normal schedule now and wont stray from it!!
More sobs broke out, this time from the Hufflepuff table. Luna also ignored them, eyes still pinned to the Slytherin table. Harry seemed to know something about that death as well, though she couldn’t help but turn away from him and towards another, less familiar soul. Blaise Zabini’s clouds of blue were in turmoil, spinning about like a tornado as the writhing green tendrils gripped them suddenly, spitting and hissing in a nearly serpentine way. Luna rather thought that the green of his soul was pleased with itself.
itching at the surface, just a bit too fuzzy for her to quite figure out. She rubbed at the itch in her eyes, muttering at the feeling as buzzing overtook her ears. She needed to figure it out—she needed to sort one thing from the next and figure out what the Woman was trying to
“Right… well, thank you very much.” His voice betrayed the confusion he felt, though Harry seemed to be the only one to take any note of it, now very obviously fighting not to laugh as Draco gave him a confused look. Perenelle, however, waved her hand flippantly again, now in his direction, as she stood from her chair.
“However,” the man continued, his grin veering on maniacal as Tom felt his own cool unease settle deep inside him. “I have very little sympathy for your plight. I think it is quite obvious to you now that, despite my deep concerns, I have every intention of melding with you today. This intention does not, however, negate the fact that I am deeply concerned for what will come of the universe that we live in once Hadrian receives your gift. We will not be there to see it, after all, and all we have of that time is theoreticals. If you can prove to me that, despite what he has become after becoming one with his Demon, he will continue on the right path.”
She hummed, looking down at him through the thin sheen of her sun hat’s veil. He was reclined out on the dry summer grass, his head resting on her lap right next to the small book that she had been pretending to read for the past few hours. His eyes were closed, an almost serene smile across his lips showing that he was either having a particularly pleasant dream or was planning something mischievous. Daphne couldn’t help but smile at the expression, remembering what he had been like before he killed that muggleborn months ago. He had taken an almost instantaneous turn after that day, and while she could tell that he still held a great deal of guilt surrounding the murder that he had committed, there was a skip to his step and an ease to his gait that made her absolutely certain that what he did was the right thing. Not all lives were created equal, and Daphne was sure that that muggleborn boy’s life didn’t hold a candle to Blaise’s.
“Inconvenient? Wouldn’t the pros outweigh the cons?”
“This is what we’ll do.”
A subtle twitch of the eye. Hands tightening around the already crumpled paper.
Harry fidgeted with his too-long fingers, swiping his thumb over a hangnail that he hadn’t yanked out yet as he watched Draco’s eyes reach the bottom, pause, before skating up to the top again. Was he reading it a second time? His foot tapping got noticeably faster, and Harry couldn’t help but feel the weight of the entire situation bearing down on his shoulders. Was this why Tom hadn’t wanted him to say anything until a better time? No, he would have had a better reason than something as arbitrary as nerves.
Throwing his own trunk roughly into the overhead next to Draco’s, he settled besides the boy and closed his eyes, yawning loudly as he eased back into the plush cushions.
Harry nodded silently, turning back to the potion as Nicolas’ form darted across the room. “And after that?”
misplacing my emotions, Luna would tell me so.”
“And that isn’t the least bit suspicious to you? You’re aren’t concerned that Luna, a person who could manage to over-explain every conceivable subject, just refuses to discuss something?” Theo snapped back, sparing the older man a quick glance to see what he was looking at, following his line of sight to the honey jar. Deciding the man was momentarily blind once more, he turned away and sped up his pacing.
“Gabrielle, give the poor boy space.” Fleur’s voice was overlaid in the same accent as her sister, though her’s was noticeably less strong. Harry thanked her quietly as she pulled the tiny girl off him.
French Translation:
“That’s completely different. For one, I didn’t go there just to spy on Daphne from the bushes like you.”
Nothing.
“Harry was doomed to this fate from the beginning. You know that.” His reply was spoken through gritted teeth, and the man tisked at him.
Harry would be able to tell her what had happened in the dreams she didn’t remember.
“By Hecate’s torch, who on earth is that?”
Glancing out the window, he watched as rays of sunlight streamed in through lace curtains and bathed the entire room in gold. It was a beautiful day, by the looks of things.
“It's alright. Pleasure to meet you, Miss…?”
I hope that this schedule will allow for me to write (because honestly the last three weeks have been awful I hate not writing 6,000 word long chapters each afternoon) and for me to keep my sanity in the progress.
“You poor boy. The lives you have lived have not been kind to you. Perhaps… perhaps I was wrong in stating that our souls are not ours to keep. Hadrian, yours is a soul that has lived through hardships I could only bear to hear of from your own mouth. If you truly believe I would turn you away for being so brave as to confide them in me, then I have not embodied my own character properly. You will always have a place here, Hadrian, of that I am certain.”
“There is no conceivable way of knowing.”
Harry would be able to explain why she didn’t remember them.
Barty let the thoughts of torture fall away, listening as Winky hopped off of the seat next to him and greeted the man of the house. If Barty could move his eyes, he might have been able to see her do so, but his gaze was forever locked onto his right pointer finger, all else being blurry as his eye was ever focused on that damned overgrown nail.
His eyes ripped open, and as the familiar, long, wonderfully freezing hands reached around to grip his shoulders, Draco found his vision crowded by brilliantly shining green.
“Erm.”
Theo looked closer at Luna’s father, watching as his eyes shifted and glanced around the room. He seemed to be looking at
“Fleur Delacour. It is a pleasure to meet you as well, mister Potter. I apologize for my sister, she gets rather excitable.” She replied, punctuating her words with a pointed look to the little girl, who pouted. He smiled again, stepping back another foot as Gabrielle attempted to lunge forward to hug him again. Touchy would be a more accurate word, in his personal opinion, but he was hardly going to tell the two of them that.
Draco had already put his trunks away in the overhead compartment when he entered, and was now sitting sternly near the window, aggressively reading through one of the course books for the coming year. Harry tried to recall when they had gone out for school supplies. It had to have been in the last week, though he couldn’t quite remember what day. Oh well, it hardly mattered.
Maneuvering around downed stacks of books and a particularly worn looking painting, the woman inside huffing at him disapprovingly, he turned a corner, quickly came upon Perenelle as she twirled through the second floor’s main hallway. He stopped short, watching as she weaved through the hall, humming gently under her breath as she watered the masses of hallway plants, stepping to and fro from the overgrown beasts that had likely been there for longer than he had been alive. Harry immediately felt himself calm, letting out a tired sigh as he brushed a spindly hand through his hair, likely making it all stick up on end more than normal.
With that, the door was opened and shut with a resounding thunk, and Harry was left to the fumes he couldn’t smell and the potion no one but him could brew. After realizing the true extent of Harry’s immortality, the Flamels had gleefully tasked him with brewing all manner of dangerous and otherwise lethal potions that had never been made prior, as no one had ever survived the brewing process long enough to see if the potions even worked as intended. Of course, the first two potions they asked him to brew had simply blown up in his face, singing of his eyebrows and making Harry wonder if it was so much trouble to give him a bloody mask to wear, if only to protect his poor hair from any explosions. However, this one seemed
The familiar red of his lord’s eyes nearly drowned out all else, eternal and damning. Barty stared, he stared for as long as he would dare and as long as he could manage. But then, as if a wire had been cut, his instincts finally caught up with him, and he quickly ducked his head, searing embarrassment screaming through his veins like poison. A shiver raced down his spine as the monarch before him hummed, seemingly amused, before the red upon red eyes suddenly left him, leaving a hollow feeling in their wake. And, just as suddenly as it happened, the grace of movement left, and Barty watched with agonizing excitement as Harry Potter’s particular gait returned. Barty stared at the boy’s back, eyes blown wide, his thoughts caught between the bounds of his duty and the creeping fascination that was slowly snaking up from the back of his mind.
Harry shifted from one foot to another, feeling slightly on edge as the time ticked down. In the first timeline, the Death Eaters had attacked late into the night, when most people had already gone to sleep. That time was hours away, so why did he feel nervous?
Harry Potter isn't certain that the questions should even be asked.
The darkened form seemed to melt and flake away at the same time upon contact with the clear liquid, and as it did flakes of a golden metal began to take their place. Copper to gold appeared to be much easier than lead to gold, as though the ease in which something was changed was completely dependent on the age gap between the substance that you wished to change and the substance that you wished to change it into.
Its eyes bulged as it lunged forward at him, its unnaturally pale face going red as the chain around its neck tightened. “Ooooohh reeeeeally? But you’re Thomas somewhere in there too, aren’t you? And you’re Tommy as well. Poor, sweet little Tommy, you took him young, didn’t you Tom? Why is Voldemort’s shard of the soul any different from theirs? When Marvolo takes me, he can call himself Locket too, since that’s what he’ll be. Me and him and me and him and-”
“Have you considered, dear Favorite, that you are misplacing emotions onto my daughter? Yes yes, that is very possible, you know.” The man remarked, his eyes still pinned onto the jar of honey. Theo didn’t notice the look, or the expression of sharp focus on Xenophilius' face. Instead, he just scoffed, crossing his arms as he began to tap out a jerky beat on his left shoulder.
It was quiet for a moment. Harry didn’t think that even the air around him was moving, it was so still.
Gabrielle: "Hm... no, you are far too short for him to like you."
He caught nothing of her expression, spare for a wide, happy smile, before he turned quickly around and stepped forward, his vision swiftly overtaken by purple.
Harry gazed around the room that had been his home for four months, and sighed tiredly.
“Hello Mr. Lovegood, I’m so very sorry for dropping in an hour earlier than agreed.” His voice came out muffled due to his cheek still being pressed into the floor, but the man didn’t seem to mind, as he simply took the trunk from where it had landed on his back and placed it onto the floor where it belonged.
The diadem horcrux looked at him warily, his eyes dimming in what Tom thought might be unease, or perhaps it was just a trick of the light. “Do you truly care that little for humanity?”
“Yes. Yes I’m fine Theo, it was just a nightmare.”
Grabbing a hold of Draco’s arm, Harry caught Perenelle’s eye without trouble, as the woman had been reading a book calmly through the entire thing. He swiftly motioned towards the exit with his chin before starting towards it, not waiting for even a moment as Perenelle put her book away to wherever she had been keeping it, likely a charmed pocket or something equally frivolous, and followed along after them.
a young man’s voice! But that soul couldn’t
“Distracting?”
It was without the sulking Black that he turned back to the two, apologizing for cutting the rather disjointed conversation short. “My godfather is... rather lacking when it comes to manners, I’m very sorry Miss. Delacour.”
“Well, we might have to cut you off at the knees, just so that your head doesn’t disappear into the clouds.” Harry nodded again, mostly just because he didn’t have much to say in response, before kicking off the wall and settling in step with his godfather. They were, hilariously, dressed rather similarly, though Harry’s normal leather jacket was a tad more form fitting than Sirius’ and had far more decals to it.
“Focus on the task at hand, if you would.”
“When do you suppose he lost his leg?”
“It's alright Pans. I’m used to it, you know?” Pansy frowned as Tracey stretched, her leg kicking out as she stepped up onto a fallen tree. They were far out in the woods at this point, and had come across a rather shallow creek that they needed to cross. Tracey had apparently decided to take her chances with the fallen log, which looked about as stable as a piece of twine.
Draco sighed, “the hard truth.”
He groaned at Tom’s blatant topic change, rubbing a long hand down his face with frustration. “I
like height differences), which probably stems from my own personal preferences.
Tom rubbed his face, mind swirling with thoughts and memories that he had brushed off as unimportant for over a decade. Even his very first action in Harry’s head had shown this instinct that he had been created around, when his very first decision as a soul inside his mortal enemy’s head was to destroy the hate wards around number four Privet Drive.
“The Anjelica, it-” there was another sudden cough, which dissolved very quickly into a pained coughing fit, and Harry chanced a quick look over his shoulder to see Nicolas waving his wand around in the air outside, seeming as though he was trying to clear it as best he could. “-it needs to be added slowly, so as to not make the potion explode.”
“Yeah yeah, real funny. Are you done?”
Theo sighed, waving Blaise’s letter around haphazardly through the air as Luna carefully picked up the glitter-soaked letter and folded it up, where it was then unceremoniously shoved into an unassuming envelope. “Blaise-one of my friends that you haven’t met yet-invited me to go school shopping with him, Daphne Greengrass, and Tracey Davis, and said you’re welcome to come along. Do you want to? You’re father...
Heavy footfalls began moving about the entryway of the house.

Albus stopped, remembering how one of his most valuable assets still at a schooling age was now transferring to Beauxbatons in France. He bit his lip, contemplative. Hermione Granger did not seem in the least bit excited about going to France for schooling, so perhaps it was possible to have her return, if only for the next school year, with the students coming for the Triwizard Tournament. He would have to broach the subject with the girl herself, and would certainly have to plant the idea in Headmistress Maxime’s mind, but if he perhaps had an alumni of Beauxbatons there to assist in the endeavor she would be more inclined to agree.
The answer to that question seemed to be a resounding no, as Nicolas suddenly stood from his seat and rounded the table towards him. “Hadrian, you must understand the severity of this situation. Neither of us are knowledgeable in any way for a consciousness to persist after death, and you seem so unsurprised by your own existence that… that you must ‘ave been fully aware of it prior to today. You
The time that he did get to spend time with Draco, however, was typically spent in the adjacent potions laboratory, where both of them would talk about anything they wanted as Perenelle pretended they were being productive. And they were... on occasion. Harry had none of the materials necessary to recreate his golden potion in the lab, sure, but he got quite a few good ideas from a supportive Perenelle on what he should try once he got back to Hogwarts, and had been writing out ideas for more extensive experiments. Her general consensus on the potion, based entirely on his description of it, seemed to be quite similar to his own, that being that the potion was some sort of psychological attacker that induces psychosis, though it was really quite hard to tell the exact effects without using it on a human. Perenelle cautioned him against the thought severely, positing that a potion like that should only be used when necessary, and never for the pursuit of knowledge. He agreed with her from a moral standpoint, but the thought stuck with him. Was there someone in his general vicinity that he would enjoy watching go mad? Certainly, but could he handle the fallout? That second question seemed to effectively hold him back from contemplating the first any further.
“Are you worried that history will repeat itself?” She questioned softly, observing as he sparingly watered a cactus of an indeterminate species. Harry huffed a laugh, moving on to a pot of spider lilies as his nerves began to calm more and more.
and that the two met in a public place where Harry could easily escape if his father had ill intentions. Surely Harry would be able to at least hold off any sort of assault if that were the case, right? If he was capable of mutilating a child without remorse, surely he wouldn’t be too troubled with defending himself against Draco’s father, right? Especially if the man aimed to kill.
The one downside, it seemed, of subtly pushing Harry to close the door, was that he had no way of opening it back up again if it was locked from the opposite direction.
“How exactly is that the only explanation?” Harry rather thought that there could be a considerably larger amount of explanations to explain any amount of issues Tom may have with his creepy wall of doors, many of them explaining whatever the issue is much better than a horcrux randomly coming upon a body to inhibit.
anything that could bring relief. He didn’t know what he was searching for, if it was in his own mind or outside of it, but he tried to reach out—find some sort of comfort or peace away from the agony clouding his every thought.
Ten thousand men.
He grunted, pulling himself up onto an appropriately sized branch before gripping onto the trunk of the tree, hoping desperately that he was no longer in danger of falling now that he was not dangling by his fingertips twenty feet up into the air.
dilute. If he had children, the same painful, excruciating experience he was currently going through would be felt by them. It was as much of a guarantee as he could possibly have.
He questioned, hand still raised and prepared to knock. He wasn’t going to listen to Tom for whatever stupid reason he had for denying Draco this knowledge. He wouldn’t do it.
Tom left it there, frothing at the mouth and sobbing hysterically, in the middle of its own twisted, insane little soul.
Albus stopped, hand halfway raised to begin stroking his beard when the epiphany struck. The attack was so illogical, when one stepped back and considered it. It almost seemed as though the attacker didn’t have a single motive besides killing someone. It was as if things had just…
“It is not made of minerals, to be the most blunt. No, the philosophers stone is-”
She opened her mouth, closed it, and then opened it again. “What should we have for lunch?”
very differently from what Harry was usually feeling as well. As Draco stared at Harry’s side of the soulbond, of the rosary, he was acutely aware of it pulsing violently with… something. Anger? Confusion? He couldn’t truly grasp what the emotions were, but what he could understand was that the bolts of red were not feeling the same thing.
Draco deserved to know.
Wormtail was dead and Bellatrix was rotting in Azkaban, so the two most notable people who had either the means or ability to bring him back were out of commission. There was always Barty Crouch, who based on Harry’s memories had not died in Azkaban, but he hadn’t given the young man knowledge of where the ring was being kept, so that was also extremely unlikely. He doubted this was any sort of ploy by Dumbledore as well. The man was old and batty but he was, sadly, not suicidal. Tom also doubted that there could have been any sort of godly intervention, even if this was exactly something that Fate would cook up in that twisted little mind of her’s.
Lavender Brown being turned into a pocket watch is first mentioned in chapter 52 of How Fate Intended. The chapter is titled "Shattering"
They sat in silence for a moment, as Daphne seemed to mull over Harry’s words and Draco admired the tall boy with wide doe eyes. Blaise was caught between admiring Harry himself—though in a slightly less romantic way—and questioning who would be King now that the most obvious contender was out of the running. Perhaps one of the older years would step up? It seemed doubtful to him, really. They had all seemed rather content to hand over the King seat to Harry when the previous school year had ended, so there wasn’t a single doubt in his mind that the entirety of Slytherin house would be up in a tizzy once Harry revealed that he wouldn’t be taking the title.
There was a laugh, though Tom didn’t see the man’s mouth move. “I already have a name, my dear Tom Riddle, and you have known it this entire time. I suppose you had forgotten sometime along the way? That is of no matter, I will remind you soon enough.”
Harry followed the small movements, paring them together with where his soulmate’s eyes were on the paper to try and figure out what part of the letter had made him react that way. There were many parts that could have done it. Harry didn’t know which ones he would prefer to be the culprit.
Well, Harry wasn’t a moron in the intellectual sense, but he was just stupid enough in everything else to not question a mysterious, red door if he came upon it.
Harry grumbled for a moment, before falling silent.
“I can see you are confused, yes?” He nodded, eyebrows furrowed in thought as Nicolas set the jar back down next to its now identical counterpart. “I understand how you would be, but I assure you that that is no ordinary blood. In fact, it is now quite dangerous to attempt to find in this day and age.”
“True alchemy, the original branch and the type of alchemy that I will teach you, is rooted in a complex spiritual concept of separation between spirit and self. True alchemy’s concepts revolve around simple parameters of physical and spiritual immaturity in comparison to far more refined and therefore perfect maturity. The concepts state that, as everything in this world holds magic and therefore has a
Theo’s footsteps were audible, if faint. They were just barely distinctive between each creak of the squeaky floorboard, and were punctuated occasionally by his own muffled voice as well. Luna focused onto the creaking, and the footsteps, and the murmuring of voices downstairs, breathing deeply as her heartbeat slowed and her shoulders relaxed. She willed the vision out of her mind, keeping the knowledge it entailed and nothing more. She pushed the thoughts of hair made from fire and eyes of icy green, pushed away thoughts of hands forged in the heart of an ice god away from her mind, until all there was was the creaking of the loose floorboard and the faint voices and those steady footfalls.
“The future is only known by Fate in full, and she would never share her knowledge with me-with us. But that doesn’t matter, does it, because if the universe was destroyed by Harry she would have failed, yes? Fate wouldn’t allow Harry, even if he is the Master of Death, to destroy the entire universe. Do you truly expect me to believe that a goddess, no matter how utterly sadistic and wretched, would ever wish the universe gone?”
it must have to do with Marvolo, hm? Don’t you think he would like to know? Like to know like to know like to knowww~!” The locket sang, pulling at its restraints pitifully as he glared from across the room. “Now come on, Thomas, tell me. Tell me tell me tell me tell-”
“Well, that’s peculiar.” Narcissa had an unreadable look on her face as she read the back of the letter, before handing it off to her inebriated husband. Lucius muttered indistinctly as he took it, ripping the envelope open without even glancing at the name or address. In fact, once he had wrangled the letter out, he threw the envelope into a random direction with insouciance, declaring it irrelevant entirely as he settled in to quickly skim the letter. It was quiet for a moment, before Lucius paused abruptly, as if personifying a lump of wood, before shooting up into a more respectful sitting position and reading the letter again, his inebriation being won over by pure shock. Narcissa watched him with concern for a moment, but as her husband began onto his third reading of the letter she stood and made her way over to the thrown envelope, reading the back of it again to make sure that she had not been fooled.

is sort out my livelihood.” Draco hissed, ripping out of Harry’s hold and immediately returning to his writing. Harry recoiled slightly, about to reach forward again before something in Draco’s posture stopped him. Closing his eyes briefly, Harry bit the inside of his cheek before leaning forward again, resting his forehead on Draco’s shoulder as the shorter boy continued to write.
