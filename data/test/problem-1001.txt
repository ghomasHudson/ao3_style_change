It was the last day of Umbridge’s trial. She’d got twenty-five years in Azkaban with chance of parole after eighteen.
Just then three bushy headed figures emerged through arrivals door number three, cutting any discussions about the merits of Muggle verses Wizard composition off in its tracks.
“I’d have done it too Harry. If I could have kept them safe, I’d have done it” Dean didn’t look over, he didn’t so much as blink. He just stared into the shadows, his voice like flint and his eyes burning out of his skull.
After a second she stepped back and looked straight into Hermione’s glittering eyes. “I am so proud of you, do you hear me.” She gave Hermione a little shake “So proud”.
“WHAT WAS THAT?” came the horse, overly loud voice of Mrs Granger. The trio whipped around, drawing their wands as one. They had forgotten they weren’t alone.
It had been Bellatrix’s work in the end. There had been evidence of the cruciatus curse as well as a sickening amount of mundane torture. Truly the worst of it though had been the spelled rope holding them to their chairs. Trapping the young wizards family as that mad witch had burned their house around them. Dean hadn’t even known until he and Seamus had apparated onto the scene the morning after the final battle. He hadn’t spoken for two weeks after, unable to process what had happened.
“Oh its all about how you are single handedly paying for the remembrance statue at Hogwarts, what a great and noble deed it is, the amount of money your putting into the restorations and how Hogwarts would never open again if it wasn’t for your direct influence, its all rather splendid. Although I personally preferred the one with the photo of you and Ron looking at condemns in that Muggle shop, I’ve never seen Mum’s face go quite that shade of beetroot before”.
“You can bet Lucius is already spilling every secret in his gut just for the chance to not get kissed” Neville said with a sour expression.
Harry, Ron and Hermione took the sofa opposite, sitting close together as they had so often over the last two years. Drawing strength from each other’s presence.
“You lost some of my trust, when I realized what you had done… I am not going to lie, it scared me, it scared me that someone could just lift a stick and change who I was and the fact that that someone was my own daughter that was the scariest part of all.” He looked past Hermione at the French windows for a second before he looked directly back into his daughter’s eyes. “So I cannot say you haven’t lost some trust. But you have most definitely not lost my respect. To have been able to face the things you have, to have made the decisions you have had to. Those are incredible achievements and I am more proud of you than I ever thought possible… Maybe we can work on that trust again? Now that we are back and we know who our daughter really is?” By the time he had finished this he was standing in front of Hermione with his hands clasped firmly around her shoulders.
Only ninety seconds or so after the whole madness had started it was over, the room fell quiet again and Harry found himself looking round a fully furnished house.
The funerals were over now, there were no more memories to be sheared, no more stories to be told only corpses rotting in the dirt and grief stricken families left to carry on the lives that could have been filled with so many others.
“Have they never heard of reading?” Ron asked sounding worryingly serious, as if he might have to stride straight up to the next Muggle he saw and ask if they were actually literate.
At first he didn’t think anything had happened. But then the green liquid in the globe started to glow, brighter and brighter until it was practically pulsing with light. It rose into the air an inch or so above Harry’s hand and the two golden rings started to spin erratically around it. For the briefest moment Harry had the strangest feeling as he stared at the floating object, it felt almost as if he was looking into a mirror. The feeling only lasted a second however as the next thing he knew the ball had sped off towards the house. It paused for a second as the front door opened of its own accord, allowing it in, and then it was gone.
That was when he heard the laughing coming from the end of the corridor he was facing away from. A second later two wizards in the robes of ministry guards walked past him.
As Harry made his way down the rickety flight of stairs that made up the backbone of the Burrow, Harry could hear the soft breathing of many people. In truth Harry had never seen the Burrow so full. Not only were all the Weasleys back under its winding rafters, but so too were many other people from the war. Most were other members from Harry’s own School year. Old members of Dumbledore’s Army, Child veterans of a war they had never wished to fight, a macabre inheritance none of them had been prepared to receive.
Hermione’s home was far tidier than the Burrow ever was, but it did not shear the spartan, clinical feeling that presided over Privet Drive. Instead a comfortable quiet atmosphere seemed to pervade the rooms. Books seemed to line nearly every wall and soft lamps lit up antique furniture. The most notable difference from any other Muggle home Harry had ever seen was the apparent lack of a television. Harry didn’t think he’d ever met anyone that had grown up in the Muggle world who didn’t own one, but now he came to think of it, not once could he recall Hermione ever mentioning a favourite TV program. The only thing she ever really talked about enjoying outside of spending time with friends was books.
Once inside they found they all had plenty of room to stretch out without getting in anyone else’s space. If the Grangers found this notable in any way they made no sign of it other than Mrs Granger slightly raising her eyebrows when both Mr Granger and Ron sat opposite each other without even brushing toes, which was no small thing considering that both men were well over six feet tall.
Mrs Granger soon went to make some tea, stepping over Ron’s small pile of sick on the kitchen floor. She headed towards the sink picking up a cloth to clean up the mess when Ron jumped to his feet.
“Miss Granger, Mr Weasley, an honor to meet you.” Ramshorn said to the pair, giving them both a brisk nod that was silently returned by the young couple.
“That’s ridiculous, yes I gave some money to Hogwarts for the repairs, but I’m not the only one who has and I didn’t even give them that much!” it was true Harry had given some money to Hogwarts but it was all old Black money and he thought he might as well use it for some good.
They waited. Several tense minutes went by as the Simularéé presumably went through every room in Hermione’s childhood home. They all listened in silence, straining to hear the tell tail sounds of a jinx or hex springing into action. Nothing. Not a sound came from the house. Finally Ramshorn let out an audible sigh and turned to Harry. She was about to open her mouth to say something when the front door banged open once more causing the iron haired Auror to visibly jump; she gave the Simularéé a rather accusatory look for shocking her.
Soon Mrs Weasley came bustling over. Floating in front of her large trays of bacon, fried eggs, sausages and a saucepan of baked beans. The rest of the former DA helped with the preparation of other meals, but Mrs Weasley insisted that breakfast was her domain alone. Harry thought it was probably her way of feeling like life was normal. She and the whole Weasley family were coping very well with Fred’s death. But that didn’t stop Harry from seeing Mrs Weasley eyes start to water before she began chopping the onions for dinner. Nor from noticing that Ginny spent more time on her broom, circling high over the Burrow’s roof, than she did on the ground.
“Mornin’ Dad, Perc, have a good day at work” he called to them as they made their way out the door and past the wards before apparateing away. “So… you ready Harry?” Ron asked looking over at him with an excited gleam in his eyes.
Rapwinder whirled to face the court, dark arched brows raising as he peered down his nose at those assembled for the trial. “The Prosecution will be pressing for the highest of charges available at this time. Life imprisonment, with no parole or visitation rights.”
Ron helped Harry out of the lift and into the surprisingly run of the mill corridor. Whilst most of the Ministry Harry had seen before held some kind of magical or at least eccentric feel, this corridor seamed nothing more than a rather nice, if slightly old-fashioned office block. Ron led Harry and Hermione down the stretch of parquet flooring and cream walls until they reached a large wooden door with a plaque on indicating that this was Mr Weasley’s new office.
Harry took a deep breath, opened his mouth and explained about what he’d seen the day before in the Ministry, about his conversation with Dean and how Draco had refused to identify him at the Manor. It all tumbled out quickly; after all he still wasn’t entirely sure how he felt about everything. Was he even right to be raising these points at all? “I mean he’s a twat that hurt people, nearly killed Katie and Ron. He’s bigoted and stuck up but in the end he just seemed scared and confused and all he was doing was trying to survive and keep those he loved safe. Can any of us say we wouldn’t of done the same?”
In front of him, on the opposite side of the road was a modest looking red-bricked house. It looked like nothing more than any average ex-council house, sitting on a normal muggle estate.
“Yes Magical Law Enforcement are checking your home and area for anything untoward. The final step will be when we arrive, to check to see if any of us might trigger something that has been hidden by conventional scrying methods”.
Harry frowned at Andromeda daring her to disagree. Andromeda stared back for what seemed like minutes as she took in all he’d said.
Harry looked at his friend and offered her a weak smile “Ditto” he said, unable to come up with anything better.
Mr Weasley”. Harry replied attempting to get the image of two wizards holding desperately onto an epilator as it attempted to violently throw them off, their robes flapping around them as the machine flailed madly.
Avicultus Rapwinder unfolded himself from his seat on the lowest row of benches before turning to face the Wizengamot and those called in as witnesses. A thin curved smile formed on his lips before he addressed the court. “Minister, High Mugwumps, members of the Gamot.” He said in a thin sticky voice that was quiet but still audible from the backbenches where Harry and his friends were sitting. It had the effect of making the listener lean forward so as to not miss what was being said. Suddenly Harry was reminded of a rather large spider pulling at its web, inching a trapped fly closer and closer to its demise. Rapwinder Harry decided was not a man who would play any kind of fair game if a dirty one were available.
Mr and Mrs Granger had many Questions after that. They wanted to know what had happened after the war, if they really were truly safe and what some of they more terrifying images they had seen in the glass of their conservatory doors had been.
Hermione’s expression shifted to a relieved smile as soon as her eyes landed on the two boys. Giving a small wave she murmured something to her parents and they started to head over.
Reporters from every newspaper in the wizarding world seemed to be trying to get their exclusive with Harry at the same time. It had been like this since the start of the trials but today was even worse, one unlucky wizard in a maroon deerstalker was pushed so hard from behind he fell head first onto the lifts floor, he wasn’t even given the chance to stand up as three other journalists climbed on top of him in order to ask their questions.
Outside on the street the three looked around at each other, Harry couldn’t quite believe how much had happened since they had entered the Grangers home that morning. The day was almost over, eaten away by the long conversations and reconciliations that had taken place. Harry was exhausted, and he couldn’t imagine how Hermione felt.
Mr Granger had stood up at some point during Hemione’s retelling of the war, he was staring off into space a look on his face that was almost completely impossible to read.
“Stop” he said again. “I can’t let you do this Hermione. If they have to know… I’m sorry, but if you’re not going to tell them… I will.”
Hermione was crying now, tears covering her cheeks in a near perfect mirror of her mother, it would have been an uncanny resemblance if it weren’t such a dreadful sight.
Harry tiptoed past them and into the Kitchen to find Mr Weasley and Percy already at the table, two steaming mugs of tea in front of them.
Harry sat staring at Luna a little dumfounded, he’d never really thought of it like that before. Had Draco really had a choice? Would Harry of really fought to beat Voldemort if his family were held hostage? An image of a scared shaking Draco appeared in his head.
As he turned on the spot apperating away from the small council house Harry couldn’t help but think about Andromeda. How easy it had become to talk to her about his worries. She was as friendly and straight talking as Tonks had always been but she also managed to understand and support Harry in a way that couldn’t help but remind him of Sirius. Funny Harry thought, how he always seemed to become so close with descendants of the Blacks, especially considering that families normal views.
After an age of silent contemplation she took a breath and appeared to shake herself, pulling together all her thoughts before addressing Harry once again.
Harry walked across the road and through the small gate next to the black rubbish bins. The gentle brush of the house’s wards as they recognised him the only sign that anyone other than muggles lived at this unassuming home.
“We were all young when the war started Luna” Harry said heatedly. “Doesn’t mean we all became Death Eaters and let murderers into a school full of children.”
“Forget Shunpike, he’s obviously gunna be let off” Ron said. “What about the Malfoy’s they have a tendency slime their way out of most things.”
“A guard or two taken justice into their own hands no doubt” Hermione replied her mouth twisted in distaste. “I’ve already talked to Kingsley about prisoner treatment, but unless the inmate makes a formal complaint it’s being entirely over looked.”
An hour later, after lots of games with Teddy and maybe one too many slices of banana bread Harry said his goodbyes, headed out of the oddly muggle looking house and back across the road.
That night Harry dreamed of a scared boy, trapped in his own home with a madman. A dark and terrible figure who tortured him, forced him to torcher others, threatened his family and his life. He dreamed of a boy who would do anything to protect his family but couldn’t in the end kill, a broken boy, covered in blood on a bathroom floor.
Harry smiled apologetically, wiggling his fingers at Teddy. He still felt very awkward referring to adults so informally. Other adults, he corrected himself. The Dursley’s had been very strict about how he talked to adults growing up, first names were for equals and friends, he was neither, if he had to speak at all he should at least be respectful. Uncle Vernon had always been very clear on that.
Harry recognised them immediately as the breed used for official Ministry communications. He looked over his fried eggs at the regal bird that sat in front of him with a slight feeling of dread. What in the world would cause the Ministry to contact everyone at the Burrow individually? Harry untied the scroll proffered to him. Turning over the parchment, Harry broke the bronze coloured seal and began to read.
him, he could barley breath when he got back. Don’t think Malfoy actually knew he’d done it until after.”
Luna gave Harry a sad smile. “You lead children on a rescue mission into the Ministry the year before Harry. You didn’t ask us to come, but we were there. That put us all in danger, yet none of us blame you because you thought you needed to save your godfather. You didn’t have a choice. Draco had to open that cabinet and let Bellatrix and the rest of them through, if he hadn’t Voldemort would have killed him and his parents. Didn’t you see how ill Draco looked all of that year; he was almost grey by Easter. I don’t think he had any more choice than you did, he may have had less.”
Andromeda sighed as she pored two cups of tea before meeting Harry’s eyes, her jaw setting in a hard line.
Harry woke the next morning certain of one thing. He could not stand by and let Draco Malfoy suffer for the mistakes he’d made and the decisions he’d made to protect those he’d loved.
“I’m afraid I still don’t understand” Mrs Granger said, looking around the car in confusion. “Why would these Death Eaters want to attack us, we have nothing really to do with your world other than Hermione. The closest we’ve come to magic is buying schoolbooks in Diagon Ally at the start of each year, what could we have that would be so important to them?”
"Alright then, well lets get on with this. Miss Granger if you would like to go next?” said Ramshorn.
“Well I think it’s about time the trials started” Hermione said “The Ministry really needs to get a move on or else half the Death Eaters will have been held without sentence for longer than the legal limit”
Gobhar jumped at the globe as it left the building, snatching it straight out of the air. He examined it, turning it this way and that, his nose practically pressed up to the glass. After a few seconds he looked up beaming at the small group gathered curiously around him.
He looked around; everyone was staring at him now. The looks ranged from pure shock on the faces of Ron and Hermione to down right venom on from Mrs Granger.
“Oh I see, well I’m sure we won’t have to wait long for a reply. How did the sentencing go?” The Weasley patriarch inquired, his eyes turning serious.
As soon as his hair touched the purple potion inside the sphere it gave a shudder and turned bright green. It was, Harry noted, the exact shade the pollyjuice potion had turned the night the Order had come to take him away from Privet Drive for the last time. The night George had lost his ear and Moody and Hedwig had been killed. Closing his eyes Harry took in a sharp breath pushing down those painful memories, it wouldn’t do to start having a panic attack now in the middle of the street. When he opened them again he saw Ron and Hermione looking at him, the expression on their faces told him quite plainly that they were remembering the same fateful night.
“We’re ok Mr Weasley” Hermione said. “We just couldn’t get past the reporters when we left Umbridge’s trial. I’ve just messaged Kingsley to ask if we can Floo to the Burrow from here.”
A black Ministry car was waiting for them just outside the airports entrance as they exited the building.
Humming softly Andromeda took the bottle from the air, tested it on her wrist and started feeding Teddy. As soon as the bottle was within his grasp Teddy latched onto it with a single-minded determination.
“Hermione played a huge roll in the war effort, quite frankly without her and Ron here” Harry gestured to his closest friend “we wouldn’t of won. That on top of her friendship with me put her in a very dangerous position. The Death Eaters would of been keeping an eye on your house incase any of us showed up looking for help, the spells we are looking for would of most likely of been meant for one of us.” Harry finished looking at the two Granger parents who had gone an ashen shade of grey. Harry looked quickly at Hermione and realized too late that he may have said entirely the wrong thing. His friend’s eyes were glistening with tears as she looked at her Mum and Dad sitting on the seat next to her.
Harry hadn’t slept well; once again plagued by nightmares of lost friends. He was trying desperately to wake himself up before Mrs Weasley found a job she needed doing, or worse noticed the state he was in and tried to ask him what the matter was. Harry didn’t think he could bare the look that would cross her face if he told her the truth.
There had been so many funerals but some stood out more than others in Harry’s mind. Colin Creevy’s funeral; Dennis Creevy standing at the front of the congregation holding his mothers hand, his head held high as her body shook, racked with harsh, dry sobs. Remus and Tonks being buried under a willow tree on the brightest, warmest day of the year, birds singing in the trees and a gentle breeze carrying the scent of early summer flowers. Harry had nearly fallen apart when Teddy started laughing at a butterfly that landed on Andromeda’s shoulder. A sound so sweet and full of joy, the knowledge that the boy who made it would never know his own Mother. Would grow up with the emptiness of a loss he couldn’t even remember happening. Then there had been Fred’s, just remembering it seemed to suck the life right out of Harry’s chest, there had been no grief on that day, no tears or wishful memories. It had just been numb, a cold, empty, broken day. Filled with a nothingness so pervasive it was a thing all of its own.
It had started with just a few, Dean and Seamus coming over for dinner a few days after the battle and falling asleep on the sofa, Seamus not able to stand going back to a home that had been too separate from the war to really understand the terrors he’d gone through and Dean not having anywhere to go at all. Later Neville and Luna had started staying, taking comfort in the presence of others, not feeling safe without large numbers of people around after their experiences over those dark months. Soon more and more people had come trickling in.
“This is a Simularéé, basically it acts as a giant biological lie. We simply pair it to a person and it mimics their physical and astral signature. All we then have to do is send it into the house and if it comes out un-damaged and not tampered with at all the house is safe for that person.” Gobhar finished beaming around at the group, obviously very pleased with himself for explaining such a piece of magical machinery so well in the presence of two Muggles.
Harry, Ron and Hermione attempted to answer all they asked. Explaining what they could and offering the best suggestions they were able to, to those they could not.
Harry and Ron appeared behind a large notice board advertising a new Children’s book by an up and coming author. They were standing just outside Heathrow airport’s main entrance. Ron looked around in wide-eyed amazement at the gigantic building before them. He wore an expression of shocked awe that only grew as they entered the cavernous space. Grey paneled walls rose up to high metallic arches and large glass windows. The number of Muggles milling about was quite a shock to Harry after the months he had spent solely in the company of wizards. Not to mention the fact he was still getting used to large crowds after his time on the run with only his two best friends for company.
“Thank you for explaining to us what was going on last year Harry” Mr Granger said. “At least we know what was happening in the country and what this whole war business was about. It hasn’t escaped me however that you have not really told us what you and my daughter were up to whilst you were looking for these
She told them about sixth year and how they had discovered Horcruxes. She told them of the Battle of the Astronomy Tower, of Dumbledor’s death and Snapes betrayal. Then she told them of how she had decided she needed to protect them. Until Voldemort had been defeated she would never be safe and neither would they.
“So” Mr Granger said as they pulled out of the airports car park and onto the main road. “What are these tests you need to run my house? And why am I not allowed back into my own home before they have been completed.”
Dean looked away from Harry, into the shadows. “Um I think I want to sleep now, would you mind if we called it a night?”
“I’m going to defend Draco at his trial” Harry blurted out, more than a little shocked that he’d said it as he hadn’t even known he’d been thinking about it.
He still didn’t like the fact he had so much political power, it felt wrong to him that he could make a casual comment to someone in an office and it could affect the very way laws were carried out or how people’s lives were lived. If he was honest it sacred him and he didn’t want it, but if he could use it to stop people like Umbridge or Fudge from hurting people or to prevent miscarriages of justice like had happened to Sirius from happening again, then he could swallow his discomfort for a while.
“I must admit I’m amazed after everything you all saw, all those horrible things… I can’t quite understand why any of you would still want to use magic at all” She carried on, still staring at the wand held in Ron’s hand.
“If you’d told us what to expect we could of prepared ourselves. You could of put up some defenses and we could of looked after you” Mr Granger roared.
“Ron? Oh hello Harry, Hermione, what are you three doing here? Is something the matter”? Mr Weasley looked momentarily alarmed; people were still very quick to fear the worst so soon after the war. Harry couldn’t blame them really, who could. After all they had all spent the last year in constant fear that disaster was only moments away.
She told them about fifth year. About Dumbledore’s Army and what really happened in the Department of Mysteries. How it had been there, as she and her friends fought for their lives, that she had realized Voldemort and his followers would stop at nothing to get what they wanted, even if that meant killing her or her family. That had been when she had decided she couldn’t risk telling her parents about the war.
“You might see it that way Harry, but many people will think it’s an incredibly generous thing to have done.” Percy went on “We’ve not had many truly good people in the public eye for a long time and seeing you being the
“He spent the whole night crying, nightmare made him piss himself didn’t think I noticed the worm.” The one guard spat in obvious disgust.
In all honesty Harry couldn’t find it within him to find any humour in the situation, he’d been in the stand four out of the six days Umbridge had been on trial and was absolutely exhausted.  Four days of watching, analysing and explaining his own memories to a group of strangers had taken a lot of his energy. Matters hadn’t been helped by the number of Wizengemot Bench Members who had been unconvinced that one of their own could have done so much damage even before the war, they had still seemed dubious even after seeing the numerous accounts of Umbridge torturing students in her short tenure at Hogwarts. Harry suspected that the Benchers who had sided with the toad were in fact more scared of what she would do them if they didn’t, Umbridge had held a lot of power and discovered a lot of secrets over the last year after all.
I’d undress as though I were alone. Like you weren’t watching me with your hungry eyes, travelling down my spine, over the curve of my arse and down my legs. You’d watch me take off my robes and my leathers, taking forever because I neatly fold everything before I put it down. You’d quickly look away, as soon as I turned around naked, and came over to the showers.
When we dived into the water, bubbles and foam sprayed everywhere. It felt brilliantly warm, and we met in the middle where the pool is almost too deep to stand properly. You were one inch too short to stand comfortably, love, and I couldn’t help a grin.
You were so trusting, Draco and you let me take your hand without question or even a single word. The two of us skittered over the flagstones, our heels beating a rhythm on the stones, ignoring friends who called out to us, and the chimes of the bell warning us that nighttime curfew would begin shortly.
“I’m coming,” you told me, your voice rough and low, and almost straight away you were spilling down my throat, salty-sour and hotter than Fiendfyre.
Very well. Here it goes. Which classes next week are you looking forward to the least? Did your Mind Healer creep you out as well? How did you spend your summer?
Oh, Draco. There had not yet been a time when I was happier for the restraint magic of my betrothal ring, for I know, beyond a single shadow of a doubt, that I would have been guilty of some tremendous and very conscious act of violence. I held onto your hand tight as I could and tried my hardest to centre myself. Even so, I still felt the undercurrent of it, the tremble of power in the pit of my belly.
A blush crept up his cheeks when he reread the paragraphs. “And… Do you think she really means me with that?”
You’re one of us now, an honorary Lion whether you like that or don’t. They’re a demanding gang too, not prone to easily accepting people into their ranks, so I reckon you must have impressed them.
And I’m not sure just what to feel about it all. Mother is alive, she seems to have accepted the fact that nothing will tear you and I apart, he gave you such an arcane gift in the minds of a true Black courtship heirloom. But she also risked everything that’s dear to me – you and she. And some of the things she said to you… Also, the future she envisioned for me. A life of quiet solitude? Run from my history? I won’t ever be able to run from my past.
I jolly well hope that none of them are passable Legilimens. I'm pretty sure they're not. Actually, I think a couple of my closest chums might be onto me. One of them observed that “I’ve got it bad,” while another asked “whom the lucky witch might be?” All I did was laugh. I told them I was happy because my Mufflemumps had finally started to shift. My bossy friend gave me a suspicious look – they aren’t an easy person to trick! – but luckily the subject soon moved on to other things.
Everybody else that we expected to have issues with us – Ron; Ginny, Hermione and even Theo – all of them have been accepting, and even kind. Pansy was your mate for years – Merlin, I thought you’d bond with her, once upon a time – so let’s not worry that she is going to hate or reject you. More likely she will be overjoyed to hear from you! You and she have a long history that none of her new Italian crowd will have, and I dare say that she’ll surprise you.
She looked at me for a beat too long, with her pursed lips and all, and then she said, “That, Mr Malfoy, is awfully hard to miss. Or why else would two capable students revise the Fairy Cakes to Fairies Charm for the entirety of my lesson.”
Ron lifted his face to the rest of us. His face was scarlet, and I knew it wasn’t all the alcohol. Neville nodded, suspiciously red-eyed. “Let’s hope,” he said, lifting the bottle of Firewhisky that had just come into his possession and sloshing it for a toast.
Alright, well, nothing is de facto done yet. But there’s a chance that this will be our future. It’s only nine months ago that I thought that I had no such thing. And then it’s only been this August that my probation had been meticulously read to me and that I, again, doubted to have much of an auspicious prospect in life.
You were waiting, my darling, and so engrossed in a deep and meaningful discussion with Hermione that you barely noticed we’d arrived at your side. I couldn’t keep my hands away from you, of course. You looked so shiny and handsome as you stood there. I couldn’t believe that this was my life, and that I was the one lucky enough to call you my intended.
Your cheeks and chest looked flushed, but I grinned at your words, running my hand up the length of your cock, resting heavy against your stomach. I gripped tight around your base, drawing the most desperate of moans from your lips. “We can’t risk that, can we? Not if you seek to bury your phallus inside of me tonight.”
I nodded convincingly, and let the MH believe that was the cause of my upset and disquiet. It felt easier, somehow. I couldn’t bear for him to dismiss our experience as a mindless teenage pash, when for me it was anything but. The two of us had quite a decent hour actually, sitting in the warmth of McGonagall’s office.
Anyway, I broke our kiss and told her that we were better apart. Better as friends. Her pride seemed terribly hurt and she ran off in the opposite direction. I expect my name is going to be mud for the foreseeable future, which means all of her family (with whom I’m close) and most of our friends won't be speaking to me. Suffice to say, our non-Ball is looking more and more desirable.
Just when we wanted to open the Quibbler that Hermione had dropped, an owl arrived to send us two copies of our own. It felt good to see us in that picture – the same one they had used in the
You know, when we went for a walk to see Andi’s neighbours, I feared that it would be awkward for you. I mean, she wanted to show your Order of Merlin around, and you’re usually not too keen on that. But apparently you had met the neighbours before, and it was only a bit weird to actually get the order out so that everyone could have a look. You shrugged it away though, busied yourself with fussing over Teddy in his pushchair, and stealing a quick kiss from my lips.
He showed me everything he got his hands on, and at first, I felt a bit insecure of what to do or say. But then I just named the things Teddy showed me and shared my incredibly vast knowledge of the local fauna. Oh, and can you believe it, love? When I said “flower” Teddy pointed to the patch of narcissi! And then I said “Harry” and he pointed to you.
Goodness, but I couldn’t help my body trembling as you helped me into a position laying on my side, across the bedcovers. With a small wave of your wand, you Accio’ed lube and closed the privacy curtains around the sides of your bed.
My heart is racing with your suggestion. Yes, I want to meet you. I’m not sure where or when, but I do. I want to kiss you and touch you.
I did get one Dreadful, sadly, but when I add that it was in History of Magic perhaps you won't scoff too much. I know for a fact that telling you that won’t give you too much of a clue to my identity. Half my bloody class got D’s. I mean, you'd have to be some sort of cerebral Ravenclaw genius to have followed Binn’s tedious lectures. Did you ever just fade off into the ether halfway through your lesson, and then not return?
Luna is a terrific, genuine person and somebody that I’m proud to call a friend. Indeed, there were times during the last few years that I felt closer to Luna than I did even Ron or Hermione. The circumstance of us both losing parents meant that we had a connection that very few other Hogwarts students could comprehend.
The arsehole didn’t give me a chance to reply. Having fired his parting shot, Robards walked out of the door, slamming it behind him.
You sniffed at that, but you didn’t let me go. “I’ve never known anything like this before,” you protested, “never known happiness like I’ve found in these four walls, and I wouldn’t survive without you.”
I knew that you’d spiralled, Draco, my love, that you lay there and let your worst nightmare grow and take form. “No,” I retorted. “No. Don’t say these things,” I said. “You haven’t sullied anything, Draco. You’ve made my life wonderful; made it shine.”
It was quite the shock, wasn’t it, when that owl delivered its missive this morning? There we were, you and I, sitting at the breakfast table with our fingers entwined when that gigantic Great Grey swooped down with a large roll of silver-edged parchment tied to her leg. Well, of course my heart sank at the sight. I know the sight of a Ministry owl, and I knew I wasn’t mistaken.
She gave me all the normal mumbo-jumbo talk about how I've lost my loved ones, and how I'm suffering from post-traumatic stress, but what she basically said was not to pressure you. She reminded me that you might be feeling love-bombed. Is that right? Sometimes I can be much. Hermione said that I needed to give you time, and so I did. I’ve let you be, but I can’t, not anymore.
It’s so bloody daft! If I were him, I’d die a little bit of embarrassment every time I thought about it. Yes, I get what you’re saying: Harry was a hero. I won’t deny you that much. But really, what choice did he have? When it all came down to it, the light-side HAD lost the Battle of Hogwarts. A few teachers, a few teenagers and the (admittedly very valiant) remnants of the Order of the Phoenix hadn’t a chance against Voldemort and his followers! There wasn’t anybody else coming, was there? The Ministry was taken and the Auror Department alongside it.
I’d better go. I’m already late for breakfast and if I missed the watery coffee and the lumpy porridge then I’ll be beyond devastated (sarcasm) although I will admit that my belly is grumbling.
Darling, I can’t wait to see you. Ron and I have a free period now and so have you. Perhaps, I’ll see you in a minute, my beautiful darling. Either way, I had better go. Ron looked a bit nervous this morning and I don’t want to leave him waiting.
That seemed to cheer you up a little. “I don’t want a dozen solid-gold cauldrons,” you said, giving me a tiny smile. “They’d melt, quick as a hex, you daft-head. And a whole fleet of owls might be a tad excessive. At least it might be, yet.”
I held you close, feeling the shudder of your head and shoulders as they pressed into the crook of my neck.
Mm. I have to admit that apart from the time that I spend talking to you, I think this Charms lesson has to be one of my favourite parts of the week. It’s a pleasant, peaceful hour away from the hustle and bustle of the school and all the politics and pressure that comes with it.
Oh, my love. I wish I could hold you right now. And kiss you. I’d kiss that pretty mouth so slow and deep that you’d sigh and moan into my mouth. I’m the luckiest wizard alive to know what that would sound like. And I could never grow tired of your low hum.
Make of this what you wish. I think she meant that I’m smiling more and that I try to speak my mind when I’m around her. Sounds like she’s already fond of you, doesn’t it? Gods, I love you so much.
But Merlin, I’d love to hide away in bed. Alone, or better even: with you. We’d wrap our arms around each other and just nap for a while.
I’ll be honest with you. There were times over the last few years where I’d have given my back teeth for that future. Nowadays, though? That vision has lost its lustrous veneer.
It would have been so easy to marry her. It’d have been as easy as breathing. I don’t know why magic folks get betrothed so young. Did you know it isn’t quite the same for the Muggle couples? They get to know their lovers, sometimes for years before they decide to get married, if they even wed at all. Seems a bit more civilised, somehow.
“Your wish is my command,” I murmured, wrapping my arms around your waist and pulling you up so that our faces were only inches away from each other. I could see the tiny droplets of water on your jaw, and your hair, darkened by the water, seemed to glow gold. “Shower, yes. Kreacher, no. Reckon I’ve got it.”
I was hoping for a bed, and a cliché fire and rug, so that your thoughts could be turned in a more erotic direction – your sharp jaw, and your plump lips looked especially ripe for kissing today – but when we entered, I was to be (only slightly) disappointed. Your will to instruct me was greater than my wish to seduce you.
Draco, it was masterful. I couldn’t feel any tenseness in your magic nor any strain. It didn’t seem to be any harder for you than breathing.
I have genuinely no idea how Muggles get anywhere at all because it sounds utterly unreliable. If I understood that correctly: there are trains, but not like the Hogwarts Express which travels only between London and Hogsmeade for students (and sometimes teachers) for the hols, and start of term or like the Express from London to Lille to Paris which travels once a day. Instead, there are hundreds and thousands of trains that stop every hour, sometimes even every ten minutes or so, at the very same train station. How?
Sorry again that it took me so long to reply. Didn’t mean to stall it or anything; this week just went by in a rush. Could you do me a favour and answer in two or three days’ time if you can make it for our Ball? Mustn’t be long, it’s just the only thing I’m looking forward to at the moment. I’ll even tell you my favourite travel destination next time. I know you’re into my stories.
I have witnessed wixen being taken hostage and interrogated by Snatchers several times, and I’m so glad that they didn’t get you and your friends. Fuck, I shouldn’t have said anything like this, it brings up horrible memories, probably for both of us. I’m sorry, love.
My darling, yes, I’m reading this in my free period, and still feeling very warm and full of love after the Equinox. Our first real one as a couple.
Apparently, Hermione had caught wind of an arising gardening problem at the Burrow. It sounded like she owls with Ron’s mother, who was sure that only spraying some infested plants during the new moon would help. But Hermione had insisted that the pest control would be toxic not only for the insects but for the fairies and all kinds of insects that are worth keeping as well. So she ordered a non-toxic variant and sent it to Ron’s mother.
I was tired back then, tired to my very bones, and I did everything that the Minister for Magic wanted from me. I told his Aurors everything. I told them the story of my time on the run, my years fighting with the DA and all that I saw during the Battle of Hogwarts.
Anyhow. It was a great idea to get out of the school for a short while. Students staring at us like we grew a second head isn’t exactly how I fancy spending my lunch break. It’s almost hilarious how quickly the grapevine spreads in Hogwarts, love. I think my favourite story is this one:
Merlin, I’m demanding today. Are you tired of me yet? I shall hope not, for by the end of this week I will try to make this up to you by taking you on a fantastic date. And let me assure you that planning surprises without having any money at all proves a rather good challenge for my creativity.
But first of all, I have to repeat how eminently scrumptious you looked in your suit today. Excuse my lack of a flattering description, but you looked so darn sexy, Harry. Before we left to Side-Along to Whitby this morning, I had to concentrate all my thoughts and energy on easing down my “excitement” about the view of my fiancé.
You laughed and pulled me down on the ground with you when the charm expired. When we lay there, our chests pressed so close against each other, I felt your untamed magic, Harry. It rushed through me with so much power that, I think, I might have sighed into your kiss.
My darling. Your eyes were dark and aroused, and had I only have wanted to, I think our learning could have been thrown aside then. I was tempted – sorely tempted – to kiss you, but I didn’t. Learning this skill felt important for both of us.
Alright, I shall try not to get too much of a sentimental, self-pitying prick right now. I’m in a perfect mood. One which I’d rather maintain. So read the rest of my reply very conversationally and light-heartedly, please. Because I’m sure you won’t like the first topic.
It’s funny, I suppose. Here I am, writing in my diary while the rest of the eighth years go about their daily lives around me in the common room. Some are playing Wizard Chess, reading or just chatting with their friends. None of them have any clue of the excited turmoil inside my heart. As for the timing of this meeting: I’m going to insist that we wait until New Year. I would have said let’s meet today – meet now! – but I can’t in good faith ask for that, not after reading your last letter.
Also, thanks for your thoughts on primary education. I shall read all about the education system for Muggles and then report back to you.
I said your name, several times, as you pushed inside of me. You hushed me, telling me that I ought to tell you if anything hurts. But all I could think was that I needed you closer. And you moved in slow, languorous pulls and pushes, holding my head and never taking your eyes off my face.
You were full of stories about Whitby; the ruins on the cliff face, the cobbled streets and the cold, stony beach, and how much you were looking forward to seeing your mother and showing me the guest house where she lived. I must have looked a bit edgy, darling, because you wrapped your arms around my waist, and held me snug.
At some point I noticed that he never looked into my face. In fact, he wasn’t even looking directly at me. What Dean was looking at, was right between us. He was looking where my arm looped around your shoulders and how your hand rested on my thigh, and how we were sitting so close to one another, not even a handbreadth apart.
But don’t imagine me melancholically staring out the window and sobbing into your jumpers (that I wear) all day; I’m a busy man. Right after you left, George Firecalled me about a bath supplement he wants to make. He had some ideas on the effect he wants: suds changing colours after the mood of the one in the tub. But he said that it acts weird when two people are in the tub together. Do you have any idea who he tested that with? When I asked, he grinned all slick and smug, but didn’t say a word.
Truth be told, I’m obsessed now with this poem. And with the fact that you Charmed it into our diary. It actually answers a question which I meant to ask you tonight, but I’ll tell you later. Only saying so much: your goosebumps suggest that you might have a type. He's even got a tongue like a honeycomb for your sweet tooth.
So, I have a few minutes, Draco. I’ve set three or four practice snitches for these youngsters to chase. What they don’t know is that I’ve charmed the snitches with a very weak Notice-Me-Not spell so I can concentrate properly on you. A rather Slytherin move. It’s times like this that I reckon that blasted hat oughtn’t have listened to my preferences as seriously as it did.
I don’t tell you often enough, but you’re a great listener. You’re never pushy and you don’t try to change people to your own beliefs (which are profound enough to wish everyone was just a tad more like you in my opinion) but rather help them individually. You’re going to be a great Mind Healer, I’m sure of it. I so dearly hope that the exams will be in your favour so you can choose how to approach this dream. You’ll have me by your side, no matter what you do. Always. If I could, I’d break into McGonagall’s office and change all the exam questions to the ones I’m sure that you could answer completely free from any error. But I know how little you’d appreciate that, love.
Our conversation got me thinking about the two of us as well; how entirely supportive you’ve been of my plans to become a Mind Healer, and perhaps even take the accelerated course. What you said to me last night meant a lot, how you would help me work out all the tricky bits that I didn’t understand, and how you’d stay up with me all night if need be.
“Not only that, but the fact that the dorm is mixed house is going to be enough to cause a light disaster in the first couple of months. Let alone the fact that we won’t even be with the same people we’ve shared dorms with for literally all of our high school lives. We’re going to have to room with new people – and what’s
But times had changed since then, and things were going to be different now. He could only hope it would sill work out alright. Being trans was the one secret he had managed to keep from the wizarding world, and he intended to keep it for as long as possible. He hoped whoever was in the dorms this time would respect that too.
Five metres could not have felt more like a mountain climb. As soon as he got onto the train, he collapsed into the first empty compartment he saw. He practically flung himself onto the seat, and finally mopped up the cold sweat that had broken out on his forehead with his sleeve.
“It’s mostly the fact that they all recommend seeing a therapist if you have issues that aren’t alleviated by the methods they give. And that’s great and all – but what therapist isn’t going to look at me like a maniac if I walk in and talk about how being the saviour of the wizarding world is weighing me down? They’ll sooner ship me off to the looney bin.”
I’m going to blame part of that directly on you. You’ve nudged open the door to my horizons with all your talk of Rome, Saint-Tropez and Cuenca, my friend, and now I can’t help but want to push it open far wider, and step through it, just as soon as possible. I flicked back to the start of our diary earlier and I glanced at something that I’d written.
Breakfast time ended not long afterwards, and Ron and Hermione left for their lessons. We found a little alcove behind a tapestry, and we kissed, my darling love. I wanted to show you all my adoration and how much you were loved. I wanted to show you that you weren’t anything like those gossip peddlers had painted you.
I’m so pleased that Seamus sought you out and that he confessed to you about his feelings. But Salazar, it broke my heart to read that they never even talked about what they had (or hopefully will have) – that it felt like it would end the enchantment.
Oh, bloody hell. What a fucking fantastic evening. Sweet Circe and all the deities. Draco, I’ve had the best time. We’ll be watching memories of tonight in our Pensieve when we’re a hundred and two, my dear. I’m ebullient. I’m grinning from ear to ear. Right now, I’m at the top of the world, and all that’s down to you. My boyfriend, my intended: the person that I happen to love.
Not only have I written you a poem, but I’ve sat in the library, with an actual French dictionary, and translated it word for word.
I’ll try to take care of him, maybe try to wash him in his bed. He’ll be scandalised by one of his masters deigning to something like that, but there’s simply no way that we leave him to feel more poorly than he already does, right?
It’s only an hour until the Harpies versus Montrose game will be broadcasted. I’ll be there in a few, hoping my beloved will pick me up before the Fat Lady has chewed my ears off.
-, and Auror-, and Ministry-based bosh this year, I’m still awed by what we have found in each other’s company. We’re truly lucky and talking to Seamus yesterday only confirmed that.
As for The Boy Who Lived, I think you might be onto something! I’ve not heard that he’s a Beater for the other team, but there hasn’t been anyone on the scene since Ginny Weasley, has there? Not the merest hint or rumour. They were supposed to be the Wizarding world’s happy ending, but the
I found a sandwich and some biscuits that will go just perfectly with my whisky. Did some of your sweets survive until now?
I’m an adult, I’m in love and I need you Draco, I simply cannot wait any longer. My mind is fizzing with want and I’m palming my hard length though my school trousers. Lovemaking might not be on the cards tonight, but there isn’t any magic on the earth that’s fierce enough to stop me from turning those earlier desires you enjoyed into reality.
A minute after Robards had finished insulting us, Atkinson and Waters returned with Narcissa between them.
With a secure grip, you raised my hips, and I saw in your face that you started to let go now. That you started to let your attentive care fly away once you knew I wasn't hurting. “Fuck, but you’re tight, Draco. Do I make you feel good?” you asked, your voice a low rumble right by my ear.
Gods. I’m so bloody nervous about tomorrow. Is it terribly obvious from my rambling? Not about us. I’m not even slightly nervous about us, my darling. I’m nervous about this ceremony, Draco. Merlin’s sodding bollocks! I actually felt okay about it back in December when McGonagall made the announcement. You remember? You were watching me, weren’t you? The whole of the Great Hall exploded in a cacophony of cheers, but I was struck wordless. I decided not to think too much about it, figuring that I had plenty of time.
Second, but equally (if not more) important: how did your night cutting down your use of Dreamless Sleep go, Draco? I’m going to hope it went well, for you didn’t write to me in the small hours. I know you’re a wise, intelligent wizard, and you don’t need me fussing over you like a mother hen, but don’t just stop all in one go, will you love?
Kreacher says that most of the letters are very encouraging, and wish us happy, fruitful lives. A good number of them are also very keen that I make an honest wizard of you and are dead set that we bond as soon as we can. (Perhaps some of those were quilled by Narcissa and Andromeda, love. I think that might be entirely possible.)
I felt the revulsion that thrummed through your body, darling, and the feeling of your life and future being ripped asunder with every touch of his wand.
Don’t you worry. I shall do no such thing as to reassure you that you, or any child for that matter, didn’t deserve something like that. I think it’s very reasonable what you said about re-victimisation and if there’s one thing, I can understand above all, it’s that you don’t want nor need pity. I won’t even ask you about your parents, who you haven’t really mentioned yet. I’m sure you’ll let me know about them someday.
First of all, you don’t deserve people talking to you like that. I know that it hurts you when people are talking about the school’s infamous Death Eater on the loose like those two wankers were. Smythe and Jefferson, that’s the shorter bloke’s name, and a handful of others talk to me like that all the time, but they should at least show some respect while talking to you.
But fuck, watching your words appear on the blank pages was pure pleasure. I couldn’t stop imagining replacing your hands with mine. In my mind’s eye I shoved my hands underneath your unbuttoned shirt, over your chest and then under you back, to just hold you for a moment or so. Your rough hands must feel brilliant on my skin. I want them on my sides or on my back right now, to feel them everywhere on my body. We’d hold each other now. I hope you’d like that. I’d like that.
In my mind I pictured diving right in, but when I saw cock, my hands just went up and I started to stroke him a few times. I remember that I had this odd thought: that’s the first time I’m touching a dick. Which is ridiculous when you have one of your own. But let me tell you that it feels absolutely different to touch someone else’s. You might know how to move your wrist and just how much pressure might feel good. But it’s so, so different.
I drink champagne from the right glasses, and dance with you to classical music, and I laugh. I laugh, and I know that this isn’t going to just end. You’re entirely right. We don’t need a mansion, because my home is you, and if we’re together then I know everything will be alright. Perhaps I’ll say something on these lines when we make our bonding promise.
And I loved reading what you had to say after. Maybe it’s the afterglow but I didn’t think it sappy at all. I’ve got to admit that wanking somewhat simultaneously to each other’s words and talking so sincerely right after felt very intimate. Which might be something that I am a virgin with. Maybe you can tell from the poems that I shoved into your face, but I’m not as opposed to romance as I’d like to make myself believe sometimes.
First, I’ll let you enjoy a moment of mirth at the fact that I’ve been set to polish balls as a punishment(!) and then I’ll tell you why I’m writing in our diaries while I’m supposed to be working. Draco, our Divination professor is blotto! Part of me is actually appalled – Dumbledore’s choices of professors were erratic at best and literally life-endangering at their worst – and part of me is relieved by her drunkenness. It has given me a free pass to get out of here a little faster. The odd bird has been sipping from a flask of coffee that smells distinctly like Firewhisky ever since I arrived and, only a few minutes ago, fell into a deep slumber in her chair.
They are also cold-blooded. In contrast to the self-sufficient dragons, they only thrive from the heat they gain from external sources.
By the way, I don’t mind you being chatty or writing on my page. I hope you’re not some sort of compulsive stickler for orderliness and regularity. Would really be a shame if the next page were to be spoiled with just one word or something atrocious like that.
They’ve known each other years, the pair of them, but their love has only bloomed in recent months, and they are understandably very wrapped up in each other. The two are love’s young dream, and I feel like a bit of a gooseberry whenever I’m in their company.
Speaking of support, I’m happy that we help each other out as much as we do. I’d do anything for you, Harry. One thing I’m doing rather for myself, though, is working on my enterprise of setting up a home-lab for potions.
You were a bit terse, and I sensed your reluctance to get to the busy Portkey Office, but you didn’t even complain for one second. This said, I want to encourage you to just bloody shout at me when I’m ridiculously demanding. I promise you that I won’t break, not when you’re the one telling me off. I trust you, and I’ll listen to you, Harry.
I know it isn’t those wanker idiots Smythe and Jefferson giving you a hard time, because I’ve been keeping an eye on the pair on my map as well. Trust me, love. If the pair of them deign to touch even a hair on your head, I wouldn’t be able to hold myself back. I’d hex the pair into the middle of the fucking ocean. I’d get myself expelled and it’d be worth every moment of the disgrace. I’ll never, ever, forgive myself for letting them beat you in the bathroom that time – I don’t have any excuses – but I can promise that nobody will ever, ever hurt you again.
I know, I know… You’re shaking your head and calling me impudent. I’m planning again, aren't I? I know that you're right when you say that living together is a big decision. I suppose that comes across as jovial in my letters but I'm in earnest. I think we'd be able to rub along well together.
I shrugged. “You couldn’t have known that I’d come,” I answered eventually. “The terms of both yours and Draco’s probation forbid the pair of you to be in contact without a third party.” I held my palms up, showing her that I was stumped by her words. “How did you know I’d come here?”
You sensed that I fretted about doing something you wouldn’t like, but my nervousness fell away once we moved together, Harry. And you gave yourself to me so beautifully and pliantly. I’m so glad that you felt loved and precious because you absolutely are. But Circe, it turns me on so much – the thought that you want me. That you want us to melt together like we do.
“It won’t be very fancy, I’m afraid,” you said in warning when you glanced at me with a little smirk while searching for your kitchen utensils and the groceries that Kreacher had delivered here for us. “Just some scrambled eggs and toast, love.”
I’m not looking forward to any subject particularly. Like I said before, I’m not a wordy swot like some of the prats here at Hogwarts. I suppose I’m looking forward to getting back out on my broomstick. That might be the only part of this year that feels even remotely bearable. Everything seems different when you’re in the sky. What about you? Did you ever take to Quidditch?
Your hair. Every time I see your hair, I want to run my fingers through it. Merlin, I even fantasise about the texture. And you always wear a part of your fringe above the scar and I’d love to brush it off and tell you that you needn’t hide. Remember that, when we didn’t know it was you and I yet, that we’d been talking about taking a bath together and I’d wash your hair? This would be perfect. I’d massage your scalp and take all the time in the world to make your hair look sleek and pretty. Not less messy though. I love messy on you.
Draco, my suggestion about coming out as a couple is this. I don’t think that we need to make a big announcement, or, as Ron and Hemione suggested, charm our names in ten-foot letters on the side of the castle. I suggest we let nature take its course and, if that means taking your hand as we walk through the corridors or brushing your lips with my own when we meet in the mornings then so be it.
Fuck, Harry. I’m so sorry. You only have to think about this shit because of me. And you only had to listen to that Auror because of me. What he said about Edward’s mother, my cousin… I’m feeling so guilty for all of this. Not for Nymphadora – what the Auror said is a huge pile of dragon dung. But I feel so guilty that you have to listen to such crap because of me. This idiot had no right to speak to you like that. You’re anything but a joke. What an uncouth brute with this arrogant, flippant manner of his, speaking to Harry sodding Potter. I bet we could bloody charge him for that.
Did you like it, Harry? Please be frank with me. You were so quiet, huddled beside me. I feel a bit sappy for talking about ancestors in the night sky, talking to you about astronomy and the House of Black naming traditions like I was your grandfather.
The great Harry Potter was so hurt by the scandalous lecherousness of his boyfriend, as truthfully disclosed in the
Do you think that I should get mine cut too, love? I’ve been too caught up in us, and schoolwork, and thinking about the future to think about such things. Soon I’ll be able to pull my hair up and secure it with one of Hermione’s stretchy bands, and then Ron will, I think, spontaneously combust.
That tricky Slytherin reputation that precedes you really is accurate, isn’t it love? Not that it’s a criticism. Not at all. It’s just that of all the places that I’d expected you to kiss me again, the ingredients annex in the potion lab wasn’t where I’d pictured. You’re quite the dark Thestral aren’t you? I’d never imagined that you’d be such a risk taker, but I like that side of you. I’m going to court that mischievous part of you and bring it into full bloom.
had offered them. Perhaps I’m fussing a little, but perhaps it might be wise to ask your mother to be cautious? The idea of Rita Skeeter making further Galleons on the back of your family makes me want to spit curses, though I’m sure that Narcissa has it all in hand, Draco. Like I’ve said before, she isn’t a person to suffer fools easily.
But I’d have enough of watching after a while. I’d say something lame, “Like what you see, Potter?” but you’d think it’s the hottest thing you’ve ever heard. You wouldn’t know what to say to something like that. It doesn’t sound like a question. Rather like a dare.
He didn’t seem to think that I’d been taking things as seriously as I ought to have been. He scoffed when I said that I’d been attending Quidditch matches, practicing duelling and suchlike. Honestly, you’d think that they wanted to keep me wrapped in a Statis Charm for the rest of my days.
The last thing I’ll say before I finish this very long – and very rambling letter – is that I don’t think I’d be too scared off if you wanted to elaborate on your embarrassingly inexperienced blowjob. Only if you wanted to, of course. There are certain parts of my anatomy that are perking up at the mere thought of having that particular conversation.
Do you know, ‘Mione actually dated Krum for a couple of months after the Triwizard Tournament? Bloody hell. I don't think she had the first clue he was actually one of the most famous Quidditch players in the world! They broke up – couldn’t do the whole long-distance thing – but they still write occasionally.
Unfortunately, I killed the mood when we cleared the table together. I’m sorry, love, but it didn’t quite leave my mind. I couldn’t let such a rare occasion of you mentioning your childhood slip away without trying to understand you better. So lacking a good question, I suggested, “At least cooking for the Dursleys meant some eggs for you too, I suppose.”
“Narcissa,” I hissed, my voice louder than I'd have liked it. “Bloody hell. How can you put us in this position? The Ministry seized the Manor and your vaults alongside it. What we’re discussing is entirely illegal! Neither you nor Draco are supposed to hold any reserves of gold that the Aurors aren't aware of. To give Draco this money puts him in an impossible position! You, of all people, must know that he needs to keep his nose clean and to stay out of every kind of trouble. I won’t allow you to put him at risk of Azkaban, not even for a day-”
. That will be completely fine, for it’s exactly who I want to be. But if anything, all this media nonsense usually just needs time to abate.
I’d never admit to this to anyone else but you, mon ami, but do you remember just how breath-takingly beautiful Hermione Granger looked that night of the Yule Ball?! Another serious case of ugly duckling. Merlin and Morgana, but I would definitely have taken her place next to Krum. Okay, I’m starting to recognise a pattern here. Am I easily impressed with blokes who play Quidditch? Are my crushes as simple as that?
Luna just got here - now there are three people sitting at my sick-bed. How come I have three amazing friends to look after me? How did that happen?
Okay, first – you probably thought as much, but I’ll tell you either way – earlier today I was nervous. Immensely. You have no idea how often my hand reached into my satchel, brushing our diary as I thought about writing to you about chickening out. I’m so glad I didn’t.
It didn’t seem necessary to me, to be honest. It seemed punitive and a little bit too close to petty revenge. I mean, these weren’t Death Eaters. It was their wives, their parents and even their kids that were being punished.
I have no idea about Muggles. But wixen are usually head over heels when it comes to procreation. It does have its merits to have children whilst still young, I suppose. I must admit that I’ve never really thought about another way. The only thing I know is that Muggles sometimes withdraw their bond, is that true?
“Want me to hex you, Malfoy?” you asked with a grin, and I actually laughed out loud because you haven’t used my last name in quite some time.
You and I, we compliment each other. While you are my tether, I show you that you needn’t be afraid to live a little. Waste things, own things – if anyone deserves it, it’s you. I see the way you look at art and listen closely when music is playing. You’re starving for more of these experiences. You do enjoy the beautiful things in life, Harry, you just never had a chance to indulge in this pleasure. Not with your upbringing and not even at Hogwarts.
Do you know what else this means? It means that you, Draco Malfoy are related to my godson. You’re his cousin! Congratulations on your lovely new relation. Edward is the grandson of Andromeda Black Tonks, who, according to that very same tapestry, is actually your aunty. Her name usually gets abbreviated to Andi by her pals, so I didn’t make the connection before now, because hers is one of the faces that Walburga burnt out of the embroidery.
Best for last: This blowjob gets you quite excited, doesn’t it? I’ll gladly keep you on the edge, though. I will talk about it in all detail. But only with some Firewhisky and the bliss of your unrendered opinions in the form of a more fluid conversation in the night of our non-Ball. From what you said about ex-lovers, Shakespeare, and your anatomy, I daresay that you are about to like what you’ll hear.
I’d like to fucking sue them, Draco. I’d like to take them to the Wizengamot, and extract an apology from their grasping, lying mouths. Zabini too. That money-grabbing, slandering creep! I thought his family was supposed to be loaded? I thought he’d fled abroad after the war? I don’t have the first clue why Blaise told all these lies to the world but make my words: if I ever see him on Diagon, I won’t use my wand on him. I’ll use my fucking fists, you see if I don’t. I’ll give that cad the hiding of his life.
When you suddenly broke the kiss, stopping me with a hand on my chest and worrying your lip, I first thought that I might have missed a problem in my plan. You looked so worried suddenly and opened and closed your mouth without actually speaking your mind, which is not very typical of you, love.
So, as you can see, I’m very happy with the article. It sticks to the truth and leaves out only the details that we didn’t want to share with the public. And apart from that, it’s perfect PR. Did I ever mention that I had a summer class on how to give interviews? I’m well prepared for our lives as lovers, husbands. Fathers.
If I’m being completely honest, I missed her. I admit only to you, mon ange, that I haven’t been thinking of Pansy much this year, but then again – there was a lot to think of, even without her. And not being able to contact her didn’t exactly make it very fruitful to dwell on memories of our friendship.
My face, of course, flushed the most incredible puce colour (in glee, I assure you, not embarrassment) and I tried to wrestle the quill back out of her hand. My friend, however, is incredibly persistent.
Tell me, did Ron dodge his girlfriend on the day of the Spring Equinox out of fear of being ‘too fertile’? I’d say I think it hilarious, but then again – he does have a point, seeing what a huge family he has. Did you know that every number of scions that exceeds three is considered indecent amongst The Sacred Twenty-Eight?
The grandparents on my mum’s side were Muggle, so I’m definitely not Sacred Twenty-Eight material. In the old parlance I expect you’d call me mixed blood, though that hasn’t ever impinged on my ability to cast spells. I’m a pretty powerful wizard, even though I still stand by my claim that I’m not the most bookish person.
One thing I’m not sure about yet, is whether I want this business to have a name that we would yet have to come up with or whether I’d rather use my name. I can see the merits of both options, love. Not using my real name for the business might save us some newspaper headlines. On the other hand, newspaper headlines are what might get this thing started in the first place. The thing is, though, that I’m not looking to become a millionaire from selling nifty little potions – our names officially attached to it might be a bit much.
Nowadays, nasty, acerbic remarks seem always to be waiting to spill from my tongue. Only minutes ago, I said cold, untrue things to my best friend, things they didn’t deserve, simply because they mentioned that I’m struggling in several – truthfully, in most – of my school subjects.
Your magic is profound, Draco. It’s arcane and deep, a glorious cavernous lake yet so achingly gentle too. It was beautiful. I don’t know what it means to be a person’s soulmate, but tonight I’m sure that our magic connected - fused together – in some intrinsic, fundamental way. Perhaps I’m talking nonsense and I’m nothing but an eighteen-year-old boy whose come is still sticky on his belly.
I paused, surprised that all these replies were leaving my lips. I hadn’t thought that the last few weeks had affected me as severely as it had. Don’t think that I have regrets, Draco. I don’t. Not a single one. If I had a Time-Turner I’d still have fallen for you; still kissed you in front of the world. You’re my point of true north, love. The fixed point in the centre of my universe.
See you in a few, my Harry. If you ask nicely, your boyfriend, the great numerologist, will foretell the results of this Sunday’s Gryffindor versus Slytherin match. By the way, are we still on for it? I’ll come in your obnoxiously cosy Gryffindor jumper and you in my pristine Slytherin attire? I know that Finch-Fletchley only ran his big mouth on us, but I want to see his face when we actually do it. And I also know that I’m making you wear the losing colours, but that’s something I’m very willing to use my big mouth for in order to make up for it.
Talk to me soon. I’ll keep my diary in my robe pocket. As soon as I feel the heat of it, I’ll read your words.
Oh Draco, I’m buzzing and happy with all the potential that our lives together hold. I’m even more excited about tonight. I have my practical clothes ready for flying, and my broomstick.
Of course, Ron couldn’t help but tease me about wizard bonding ceremonies, and as soon as Flitwick had set the work, he, and a couple of the other lads came over to where I was sat to rag me about what a fancy chap like you might expect from your special day.
But there’s no need to sugar-coat anything, not here. Let us continue with the brutal honesty we have always treated this diary with.
Okay, okay. No more talk about the subject of lovemaking…  Mm, yes. I’m excited about that part of the day as well. I think that’s a wonderful idea, darling. We finish our diary, and then we eat supper, and then you make love to me?
You must – again – excuse my lack of questions, my beautiful boy. I’m just so overwhelmed with all the impressions I had today, travelling all the way to London in a train full of students, none of who were you, to the Ministry for an unpleasant conversation, and then halfway back up north where my Mother and a stunning coastal town were awaiting.
Harry? Thanks for being there for me this morning. I knew that you tried to make me feel more at ease.
But once we both recovered from convulsing in laughter, I thought I’d rather try to show you. I will admit now that I didn’t have a clue whether this would work or not, but I tried anyway. “House magic does things like this, of course,” I said, (hopefully) summoning my impressive air of competence and authority and concentrated my eyes on the fireplace.
“You had to endure this. And I want to understand, Draco. Everything. You don’t have to cope with this on your own.”
The Ministry chap grudgingly congratulated me on my Order of Merlin, and then he stepped back into the Floo. As soon as he was gone, the Headteacher turned her attention onto me. She told me to enjoy the ceremony, and that despite what I might believe, I did deserve the honour being bestowed upon me.
And that’s where everything went wrong, didn’t it? That was when I must have cocked everything up. Just as you were beginning to take off your shirt you froze, a look of abject horror and awfulness blanching your face. All the warm erotic pleasure in your grey eyes seemed to vanish and you left me.
This morning I realised how the students don’t give a damn anymore about me sitting with you Gryffindors. They just sort of expect me to cross the Great Hall over to your table.
The moment I said his friend's name, Dean cursed and ran his hand over his head. "Fuck, am I obvious? Christ, I'm… It's not what it looks like! We're…"
Please don’t think that you’ll have to provide for me financially. Also, please don’t think that you have to prove yourself a suitable husband for my mother – or me! I just want you to be you. We will live together, and we will pull in one direction as a team, you and I. If I’d desire to reobtain my accustomed posh lifestyle, I ought to seek out a profession that delivers accordingly.
We can talk about it more when we meet in the Great Hall. I’m not rushing into anything immediately after Hogwarts though, and besides I imagine it is too late to apply for the apprenticeships at St Mungo’s this late in the year. Ron and Hermione both owled away their respective applications to the Ministry of Magic months ago.
You probably don’t need me to tell you, especially since you’ve given me the same advice – but you don’t need a plan for post-N.E.W.T.s yet. It’s very common in my family to travel the Continent for one or two years after school. The longer you look back, the longer my ancestors took to start a career or anything like that, really. I don’t know if this would be an option for you. But not rushing into an apprenticeship right after this blasted year won’t make you a hopeless case.
Draco, my love. If only you could have seen how sensual you looked, owning your pleasure and letting yourself be spoilt.
Even the merest thoughts about your delightful pucker are quite enough to get me hard once again, and I’m not sure I could wring another orgasm out of myself quite yet. I already wanked myself stupid twice last night, dreaming about the sight of the shower spray cascading across your skin – don’t worry, my Silencing Spells were immaculate! – but my poor penis is feeling a little sore today. It’s a shame we can’t be together tonight. Such a wonderful suitor as yourself would surely volunteer to kiss it better.
Spending hours on end in bed together is such a bliss. I completely lose track of time, just talking to you about every subject under the sun, carding my fingers through your hair, waking your prick from its lazy slumber in between talks and orgasms.
And, likely as not, it’ll take me weeks and weeks to even make a mark on those gigantic and mile-thick walls that you’ve built around yourself, but that’s absolutely alright. I’m patient, and I can be very persistent when it suits me. We’re both of us stuck here in this castle with nowhere else to go. I’m every bit the obnoxious Gryffindor that you’ve always opined, and I simply reek of determination. You’ll be so sick of my invites that you’ll accompany me simply to shut me up.
I’m going to tell you that, face to face, in a little booth at the back of The Three Broomsticks. “I love you,” I’ll say, and I’ll take your hand, knotting our fingers together tightly. “I love you," I'll say, "and you’re never going to have to be alone, not ever again.”
I wouldn’t know what I’d do without you. Especially now that I have you. I do love you so, darling. You’re so stuck with me now, Harry. I won’t ever leave your side.
Atkinson and Waters aren’t due to Floo in for another hour, but I’ve a sneaking suspicion that the two of them might arrive early, and furthermore, that delightful Head Auror Robards might tag along, just to see if everything is to his liking. You’ve been uncharacteristically quiet for the last hour or two, apprehensive about the interview to come, and I can't abide that you're worried. I love you so much.
I love you, Draco, and I couldn’t love a Death Eater. You’re not a Death Eater. You’re a child that suffered more than you ever ought to have. Lucius should have loved you and looked after you, and that, my darling, I’m not sure that I can ever forgive. You disparage me for my lack of self-assurance but Draco, it is you that deserves presents, smiles and love.
If Narcissa decided that she didn’t want to be found, then she’ll have found a way to hide. Remember how brave she is? I wouldn’t be alive today if she wasn’t prepared to take a risk. She told a barefaced lie to Voldemort in front of all of his followers, just to get back to your side, love. She’s a survivor.
How was your walk? Or your week. Been monologuing for a whole page without doing so much as asking a few simple questions. Then again, you don’t seem to be the kind of wizard who stresses about cultivating pleasantries.
Do you remember how we began our letters, back at the start of the year? Neither of us wanted to be back here and the only memories we could share were bad, difficult ones? Maybe I am getting better. Your letters are helping me start to remember why I used to call Hogwarts my ‘home’. I know! You must be rolling your eyes. What a childish, naïve comment. So twee and yet so true. Hogwarts was the only place where I’d ever felt truly happy or safe.
Before we had our brunch, Mother excused herself for a minute and we had a moment to ourselves. “Draco,” you said, taking my hand and kissing my knuckles. “How come our mundane life sounds so fancy when you talk about it?”
You’ve unmanned me, do you know that? Made me see all the possibilities that sharing a life with you might hold.
I didn’t let you utter one more word, for I didn’t have words to thank you. Harry Potter, I love you. You seriously make the greatest gifts. You have no idea how much both of them mean to me. Our first time will be superb, I promise you that. Sweet Circe, we will love it. Have you been talking to Lulu? Because she told me only last week that real lube is so much better than the conjured one. (Yes, we actually spoke about sex.)
Anyway, I nipped into the boy’s lavatories on the way – and this is a pretty shameful admission – I saw somebody getting roughed up from the doorway. The bullies weren't using magic, as the spells would too easily be traced, I suspect.
Edward was named for her husband – Ted Tonks – and sometimes Andi shortens the baby’s name to Teddy when she speaks to him. I don’t know if it’ll stick as a nickname though. It might. It depends on what Edward responds to, when he begins to talk. I knew I felt close to you in Whatstandwell, Draco, and it turns out I was staying with your kin. It’s true what they say about the wizarding world, isn’t it? Everybody truly is related to everybody else.
I’ve loved people that aren’t with us anymore – not naming names or giving details about who they were – and that line gave me real comfort. Somebody said something to me once, years ago now, about love being the most powerful magic that there was in the world, and I think this Shakespeare wizard understood that only too well.
And we will be there for Teddy if my aunt allows me to be there with you. Harry, the resemblance between your godson and yourself didn’t escape me. Growing up without his mum and dad won’t be easy, but I promise you that it won’t be anything like it must have been for you, love. He won’t know abuse, scorn, hunger and neglect. And neither will he ever think that we will only love him when he meets our expectations and fulfils a future he didn’t choose. We will always be there for Teddy. We will love him unconditionally.
Then, once I was eleven Dumbledore took on their mantle, and he raised me to die. Our lovely, jovial old Headmaster raised me like a pig for slaughter. He knew full well that a part of Voldemort’s mangled soul had been left within me when the wizard tried to murder me for the first time, and he knew that one day he’d return.
Well, this did not go as I had expected. He answered, “Fine, I’m good,” and while nodding, his eyes started watering up. I must admit that I panicked a little. But I dragged him out of the common room because no one wants a bloody scene like this.
Also, you’re true to your words so far – to your resolution to elicit a genuine smile on my face every time we meet. Your presence summons those lines next to my eyes you’ve mentioned. Every time. That’s what I feel, at least. I hope my facial expressions catch up to my emotions. You must see that it can be such an onerous task to arrange my patrician features into an expression as common as a smile.
“And I’m sorry for that,” he said, “because I can see what the two of you have is truly real. Sadly, the public fascination with the pair of you will be one that endures, I believe. Draco’s public persona, combined with yourself makes for a very compelling storyline, and that the two of you fell in love? That’s like something from a fairy-tale or a romance novel, and so people will be interested. That’s human nature. This is my advice to the pair of you: let other people’s opinions be. The only thing that you can change is yourselves. Focus on the things that you can influence: your relationship, your friends, studying and exercising. Otherwise, the pair of you’ll be on a hiding to nothing. Try and focus on the bigger picture, Harry. Getting your N.E.W.T.S and figuring out what shape your life next year will take. In life, everything has a funny way of working out.”
I’m going to tell you everything in the hope that you won’t be judgmental. I think that I might have treated more than one person appallingly today and I’d like to hear your opinion. Don't gild the lily. If you think I've been a git then I want to know.
Apparently “if we charmed each other’s name in ten-foot letters on the side of the castle wall we’d be less subtle than we are right now.” I don’t care. They’ve been snogging each other’s faces off for months now and nobody here bats an eyelid. I only want the same for us.
Before you told me about your chat with Seamus, you were quite a kinky git. Praising me for my magical ability and suddenly writing about Legilimency and cock sucking in one paragraph. I was very glad to have been so properly robed up in favour of hiding my enthusiasm about your idea.
If you don’t mind me saying, you sound like a bit of an egghead. Please, don’t throw our diary away in disgust. I promise you it isn’t an insult. I was always a bit jealous of the wixen here at school that got all the top marks and made even the most intricate magic look effortless.
Instead of saying anything, I wrapped my arms around you then, pressed kisses all over your face and into your messy hair, until you caught my mouth with your own and kissed me in earnest. Once we restarted the fire, cuddling and kissing on the settee, you quickly felt at ease again, didn’t you?
The actual snake you’re talking about is your father, the man who raised you in his own psychopathic image. Don’t forget that I know Lucius. I’ve dueled him with and been at the sharp end of his threats. Lucius isn’t some obscure idea to me, Draco. The man has tried to have me killed, on more than one occasion. I wrote once, right here in this diary, that Lucius ought to have held you closer than he ever did his riches or his reputation, but he didn’t, did he Draco? You never came first.
But Circe, I hope that I’ll be feeling more at ease once you’ve taken inventory of that vault. Just now, I’m feeling like a prize idiot and a petulant child all at once that I complained about Mother’s meddling. I’m not sure whether I can bring myself to admit that to her, though thank her I will.
I haven’t seen the little mite since last summer and I have missed him immensely. You know how children are. They change and grow with every day that passes. I have to rush off – lessons – but I will tell all the details as soon as I get a half a minute to myself.
“Oh yes,” he said, his eyes narrowing. “Lucius Abraxas Malfoy. The pair of us visited that upstanding gentleman only yesterday. Azkaban isn’t suiting him very well, is it now? Emaciated, greasy-haired and half-insane was my impression, but of course, you wouldn’t know that, would you Mr Malfoy? We've checked the records. You haven’t been in contact, or visited, and neither has Mrs Malfoy. A deliberate ploy by the pair of you? A ruse to throw off the authorities? Tell me the truth: have the three of you engaged in secret communications?”
You know what happened on my descent into the dungeons? Some bloody Third-Year or something shouted, ‘Death Eater faggot’, then ran off with their friends like the coward that they are. I passed one of the seven year Gryffindor birds that never quits stalking you and she gave me the nastiest of looks, stepped in my way, and said “You’ll see, Malfoy. He will suss you. Your sad puppy face might speak right to his protective instinct but he’s not as oblivious as you think.”
Seamus has confessed to me that he’s gay, which is, in my opinion, the most fantastic state of affairs – no, I’m not going to mention penises, lube or friction here, though you know that’s what I’m thinking of – but isn’t in Seamus’s opinion. Now, I’m not such an oblivious wanker that I didn’t realise he was getting a dig in with the ‘couple of the year’ comment (although he was entirely bloody correct!) so perhaps you and I falling in love has changed things for Dean and he? Added an extra pressure that they didn’t have before? Merlin, do you think they broke up and seeing our happiness has made them change their minds? Do you have any ideas?
We lay in bed, face to face, you naked and I still clad in my trousers, my hands in your hair and yours palming my cock through the fabric. I love the feeling of that, Harry. Not that I wouldn’t love to be touched without anything on, but that sensation of your fingers feeling up the bulge through the soft material – it does something for me. Fuck, I just came out of the shower, but writing this down gives me a semi.
If you could see me right now as we’re probably both sat in our respective beds, you’d see my signature smirk that “is capable of seducing even the purest of hearts”. And you might wonder why I keep on citing stuff about my “diabolically smart looks”.
From what I’ve been told by my pure and half-blood friends, houses such as the one you grew up in were enclaves where magic was practiced without restriction? Did you learn spells at your mother’s knee? Was the relationship between the pair of you very formal or did she tuck you in at night? Sing you lullabies? I’m sorry – these must sound like odd and intrusive questions – but you know now what my own childhood experiences were. You’ll excuse me for living vicariously through you.
The greatest indulgence of all, however, was, without a doubt, the dozen Sugar Quills that I had put on stasis and Reducio’d by the shopkeeper for eating later. I plan to taunt and vex you with those sweet treats each time we revise together in the common room. I’ll tease and tickle the sweet with my lips and tongue, and make you all hard and ready for me, Draco Malfoy. You see if I don’t.
Bloody hell, it was so good. Each single one of your thrusts surged a new wave of pleasure somewhere below my prick. knowing that you’d take good care of me. Circe, one’s mind can go all directions while having sex, isn’t that true? I wanted to be open and pliable for you, love, wanted you to have your way with me. I felt vulnerable, but in the best way possible. The feeling, though, isn’t that different from taking you. It’s about sharing something, isn’t it?
He agreed, and we were quiet for a moment after that. Ron said, “Harry said that you’ll marry in September, on the day of the Equinox?” and I told him a bit about our plans. I also mentioned that you will apply for university or an apprenticeship next year and that I’ll set up a small business from home.
Just to make sure – I’m not talking about the practices using actual blood sacrifice and ritual impregnation and such. But I’m sure that you thought as much. I’m talking only about things that are usually enjoyable for every attendee. No blood, no rape, no chastisement, or any of the sort. These are the kind of traditions that should stay in the past for good. Oh Merlin, I could tell you horror stories about things I’ve read in long-forgotten tomes found in our family library.
. He was right, of course. I’d read the words Death Eater in your letter and every other thought had left my head.
My aunt hated that she was related to a witch, and her jealousy over the fact had curdled into something ugly and bitter. I was a constant reminder to Petunia of her sister, both in my temperament and my looks, and she loathed entirely as a result.
“Mr Potter!” came the furious voice of our professor, as I helped Seamus to his feet. “I’m appalled. Utterly appalled, one would think that a wizard of your pedigree would know better than to fling potentially fatal magic around in the classroom. Furthermore, I am dismayed that you would even have acquaintance with such a spell! Such advanced magic is the preserve of members of the DMLE alone!” She shook her head at me and gave Seamus a once-over. “Considering that Mr Finnegan’s vital organs are all still exactly where they belong, it seems that your reckless lack of care hasn’t rendered today a disaster of epic proportions! If – and this is a big if! – you can be trusted, then please take Seamus to the Hospital Wing. We cannot afford to be too careful in cases of accidental magic.”
Circe. Listen to me. Was I the one who accused you of being a master of angsty teenage catastrophe? Perhaps that title rightly belongs to me. I just can’t understand, precisely, where things went so badly wrong three days ago.
You know I want you and I hope my randy words last night didn’t spark these insecurities – they were just words and fantasies. Forget about them. If we’re with each other – really with each other – we will only do what we both want. Only what feels good. Merlin, I’d even be happy just to kiss and hold you all night if that’s what you’d like to do. Because I love you just the way you are. And just like you accept me – you haven’t even mentioned in your words last night that I covered my Dark Mark with a bandage, which I’m so thankful for – I will accept you.
Well, part of me wanted to walk out immediately. I didn’t, of course. I wouldn’t have done such a thing. Fury, sadness and exhaustion rolled through my middle, and I’m afraid that my reply was sharper than I might have wanted.
But anyhow, back to the letter. I’m proud of the part about Theo. We found all the details that will hopefully allow for some nostalgia to arise in Pansy. I was impressed to learn how much Hermione had to do with him. I mean – it’s not that surprising considering how studious those two are. Not even House superstitions can bar Hermione and Theo from solving numerical sequences and translating dead languages, isn’t that the truth?
might not be the wisest idea, and 2) those robes are terribly infused with memories of the night that came after it, and I’m not sure that your Whitby relations would be too impressed were I to have my wicked way with you in their Lounge, which I might be minded to. Bloody hell, but I’m feeling randy just thinking about it.
I’m pleased to read how excited you really were when I came over to sit next to you yesterday evening. Of course I was only there to enjoy this fabulous food the elves left for you. I thought it only fair that you share some of it. I smelled the Toad in The Hole all across the hall – it’s one of the dishes I only ever learnt to love once I became a student. Food back home was quite different to say the least.
What I mean to say is that both Dean and Seamus can be very lucky, one on the run and the other staying in Hogwarts as a half-blood. I can only imagine how much harder all the fear and uncertainty about each other’s whereabouts must have made their already inconclusive relationship.
We, as a society, seem desperate to lavish love on The Boy Who Lived. We have already given him the Order of Merlin, the highest honour that Britain can bestow.
In case you wonder – yes, I’m still hiccupping. Last time this happened, I was trying to explain to Mother under tears that Pansy was a mate and having her sleep in my bedchamber wasn’t inappropriate at all. I was twelve years old or so and I cried and vented and hiccupped just as pathetically as you just had to witness.
What a brilliant afternoon, Draco. I genuinely enjoyed myself. It really was a great idea of yours to go out and have a little exploration around Islington. It is, after all, where we are going to be living and building our lives.
Of course, the other Gryffindors have given me quite a teasing about the sight and have called us love’s young dream. Poor Ron has taken the sight to heart a little and is worried now that the love that he and Hermione share is somehow not as momentous.
Okay. Give me a sec; let me just Aguamenti a glass of water. I’m going to go through those worries of yours, and try and put them into a bit of perspective.
Maybe you’re one of those neat, precise wizards that always looks pristine wherever and whatever they’ve been up to, and your orgasm hasn’t left you messy and pink-cheeked. Not me, I’m afraid. I seem to have been born with muddle and disarray built into my DNA. I’m entirely sure that my recent pleasure would be wholly evident from a simple glance at my face.
Don’t hold back on my behalf though. I do know that you’re going about this very gently and kindly whenever we see each other in person. And I’m glad you do, because – just like brushing your arm, absolutely accidentally of course! – it feels good to test things out.
How on Gaia’s green earth am I supposed to learn when my fiancé is so exceedingly brilliant and lovely?
Merlin, but I’ve never heard such a lot of besotted – yes, besotted, Draco Malfoy - and no, stop kissing me there… Okay, don’t stop kissing me there… Alright, intrigued. Is that more acceptable? Fascinated. Yes? We agree? You’re fascinated by Teddy Lupin?
We took a turn around the greenhouses while she spilled out her heart. Turns out, she’s had a few regrets over the swift split that we had during the summer.
It took my breath away. You have this air about you, Harry. When you speak up, everyone listens closely, compelled by your powerful aura, and moved by your sincerity.
Well, supposedly they are concerned about me. Apparently, I’ve been spending too long cooped up and I need some fresh air. It’s September, in bloody Scotland! The air won’t be fresh. It’ll be bloody glacial.
Please don’t feel guilt or remorse about the course that your father and you decided to take. We can’t go back and change the things that we have done, not without changing the future we have now.
And in courtship we couldn’t meet tête-à-tête for quite some time, for we’d need a chaperone with us. Doesn’t it sound dreadful, love? I’m sure, whoever would end up being our chaperone, it’d be awfully embarrassing for them because another pair of eyes couldn’t stop me from tasting your eager prick sooner rather than later. I hope you didn’t expect that until you’d read that line, darling.
Merlin. I just went to get a cup of tea. When I returned – and reread what I’ve just written – I had to bite back an actual smile. I’m not sounding quite as bitter today, am I?
Oh Draco, I could tell that asking this question had cost him a lot of effort. He was red in the face, even in that shadowy corner of the Library, and his voice was hushed, like he couldn’t bear for anyone to hear us.
Only seven more days and I’ll finally know what you look like. Already I know the most important thing about you: I know your heart.
And you also ought to add that while my eggs were perfectly palatable, the ones you prepared yesterday were absolute perfection. Piquant, fluffy, a bit creamy in parts – délicieux. You ought to try making an omelette, love. I hadn’t had one in ages, and I used to order them for brunch all the time. Sometimes they were served with spinach and mushroom – we often went to Gloria for brunch during the hols – do you know it? It’s way past the Ministry at Sevensterre Walk. Don’t worry, you hardly missed anything if not, it’s just a poncy wizarding shopping arcade, way posher than Diagon.
Harry! I had no idea you’ve been in the Prefect’s Bathroom before. Hogwarts truly used to be your home, wasn’t it? There’s practically not a single corner of this castle you haven’t seen.
Apropos of nothing, Blaise will come visit next week. Pansy planned a soirée at Parkinson Hall and invited me to join Blaise, Theo and her, but it’s the exact day you’re coming home, Harry. You can imagine how hard Pansy rolled her eyes at me when I told her no. She declared me an utter fool for love, but I’d hardly enjoy myself when I know that I could be spending the time with you on the settee, listening to records and your thoughts about your first practical experiences as a Mind Healer-in-Training. I’d be fidgety and wouldn’t find it in myself to listen. I’d be a perfectly useless guest there.
In your eyes I saw that you understood what I meant. “But Draco, she’s only scared for your future. You make your own decisions, but Narcissa won’t stop meddling all of a sudden. Not after everything that happened.”
Please excuse my emotive prattle. I feel like I’m going mad, but in other ways than I’m familiar with. I want to laugh and cry at the same time, I want to possess what we have just for my own heart and, at the same time, shout about us from the top of my lungs. If I were allowed magic outside of school grounds, I’d take my wand now and I’m sure I’d encounter the corporeal form of my Patronus for the first time.
Thank you for your brilliant letter. I don’t mind admitting that I’m glad I know where you’re staying and that you’re safe.
Love, can I confess a little thing, while we’re talking about last night? I didn’t have any idea that you could make yourself cum from putting your prick between another person’s thighs. Hardly the sex god you described in your entry, Draco darling.
