“Do you—?”
Potter was very close now, only an arm’s length away, so as a last resort, Draco sat back on the ledge, pressing himself as far away from Potter as he feasibly could. Potter remained undeterred, his gaze fixed steadily now somewhere below Draco’s neck. Belatedly, Draco realized that, by sitting on the ledge, the top part of his chest was no longer submerged beneath the potion-tinted water. His skin prickled, itching at the sensation of being exposed and yet knowing it was too late to hide.
“Neither of you took notes in class?” Granger demanded, glaring between the two of them. Weasley and Potter both shook their heads, at least having the decency to look sheepish about it.
Weasley’s expression turned mutinous. He opened his mouth as if to say something, but before he could Granger grabbed his hand, pulling him towards the door. “We’ll see you at dinner, Harry,” she called over her shoulder, dragging Weasley away even as he cast Draco one last mistrustful glare. Draco watched them leave with a scowl, waiting to ensure they were really gone before returning his attention to Potter, who was watching him expectantly.
“I was just going to say, maybe we could walk around a bit, or something?  Since we’re already here.”
“Oh, so you can be friends with Potter now and I can’t?” Pansy pouted.
Also, just a quick note - I haven't added a separate tag for disordered eating because in Draco's case his lack of appetite is a symptom of PTSD. That being said, it's something that will continue to be referenced in future chapters much in the same way it has been already. I wanted to mention it just in case it's triggering for anyone, and if anyone feels strongly that it should be tagged separately please let me know!
Draco’s eyes flickered over to the boy who had sat quiet as Pansy worried over him. Draco had not dared look over until that moment, afraid that the explicit content of his dreams would be written all over his face for the Gryffindor to see, and perhaps even more afraid that, if he looked at Potter just then, the outrageous fantasies concocted in his sleep would begin to feel like real desires.
When Granger dropped the teetering tower of books she was carrying one day in the library and Draco helped her pick them up. When Weasley held open a door for Pansy, looking surprised even at himself. When they all sat around the fire in the common room once again, not talking this time but not shying away from the proximity either.
“I thought it might’ve been too late.”
He directed himself towards the dark-haired girl waving at him from the Slytherin table, taking care to choose the seat across from her with his back to the rest of the hall, avoiding the temptation to look in the direction of the Gryffindors. As usual, he wasn’t particularly hungry, now less than ever with the mix of adrenaline and anxiety still coursing through his body, but Pansy was already shoving a plate of food across the table to him. Unwilling to argue and even less willing to explain the reason his stomach was in knots, Draco picked at his green beans as Pansy recounted how Millicent had accidentally turned Justin Finch-Fletchley’s toad into a cactus while practicing nonverbal cross-species switching spells for Transfiguration class tomorrow, leading the Hufflepuff to turn her hair into snakes in retaliation. Grateful for the distraction, Draco threw himself into the story, joining Pansy in speculating wildly about whether Millicent had a crush on Finch-Fletchley and actually transfigured his pet to get his attention.
?” Draco’s eyes widened. “You mean, in our second year, all those stories about you and the Chamber of Secrets…?”
When he pulled back, Potter chased after him, tilting his head to deepen the kiss. The first brush of their tongues was unlike anything Draco had ever felt, his whole body alight with it. He was sure that kissing had never been like this before, not even close. If it had been, maybe he would have kissed more people. This was addictive, headier than firewhiskey and the burn far more pleasant, a searing heat low in his stomach that seemed to grow in intensity the tighter that Potter gripped him.
They could hear more students in the hall now, laughter echoing. Objectively, Draco knew that they must be nearby, perhaps just outside the door, but it felt like they were a world away. Right then, the only thing that mattered was the warmth of Potter’s breath on his lips and the firm grip of his hand, bringing Draco closer and closer to the edge.
“I heard that he and the Weasley girl broke up this summer.”
But the reality was this: he was eighteen years old and standing in front of Potter, chafing against every thorn-covered vine tying them together, and Draco couldn’t do it.
“Oi! I was using that!” he insisted, although it was possible that he and Pansy had different ideas of what “using” meant. True, he hadn’t taken a single bite of the pie on his plate, but he
“Potter?”
Potter dripped a small amount of the Wormwood Essence into the cauldron. “I remember a few things.”
“So, what did you want to talk about?”
Draco’s brow furrowed. “What does that have to do with anything?”
“I’m getting tired of asking why you’re always here, Potter.” Draco did not look up as he spoke, hoping that his cold tone would be enough to mask his embarrassment.
“We’re still friends.”
When he returned, Potter was just as Draco had left him, although his gaze was now fixed on the slow swirl of the potion as he stirred. Draco resumed his position on the floor, laying out the variety of potions ingredients they now had at their disposal. Potter’s question had rattled him, but the strong, familiar odour of the supply cupboard—an odd mix of verbena, armadillo bile, and the pungent scent of pickled bat spleens—had helped him refocus.
By the time Draco’s tossing and turning had finally lulled into a fitful sleep, Blaise’s apathetic voice was telling him he had missed breakfast and was going to be late to class.
“Perhaps not,” he conceded, mulling over his words before he spoke. He hadn’t imagined Potter would pry this far into his motivations. How much of the truth did Draco have to give before he was convinced? “If you must know, I don’t have a lot of opportunities open to me anymore. The prestige is nice in itself, of course. But if I were to win…” He hesitated only a moment, then ploughed on, “I might actually have a chance of being hired after I leave here.”
“Well we got here on time, didn’t we?” Draco insisted, hoping the relief he felt wasn’t visible on his face.
“I like you, Malfoy.” Draco blinked, caught off guard by the honest admission. “I know that’s probably pretty obvious already, but I wanted to tell you, just in case. I like you, and…” He pushed a wet lock of hair off of Draco’s forehead, the touch easy, delicate. “I hope we can go on another date, sometime.”
As if in response to his unspoken need, Potter’s hand moved towards Draco’s belt, stopping at the buckle. His fingers were so close to where Draco wanted them, only a few centimetres and a bit of fabric in the way, an easy barrier to cross. Draco waited for them to tug on his belt, to remove the remaining obstacles, but instead he felt them move away, Potter’s hand settling back on Draco’s waist.
Draco winced as he rolled up the leg of his trousers. The skin underneath was raw and red, and it was beginning to blister in places. Draco had expected as much; the potion had been just below boiling when it spilled. But as he looked closer, any thought to the pain disappeared.
“I was carrying it while I waited to be called in. I think they knew it wasn’t mine. They almost stopped me.”
Things shifted slightly after that. The change wasn’t dramatic, or instantaneous. Time went on as it had before, the days filled with a repeating pattern of classes, studying, potion experiments, and hidden kisses. And somewhere in the routine of it all, there were small moments in which the difference could be felt.
In hindsight, he should’ve known better than to think he could ever deceive Pansy.
They met at the main gates late that Saturday morning, the clouds overhead heavy with the promise of rain. They’d both wrapped scarves around their necks against the brisk autumn air, Potter’s striped in Gryffindor colours, a bright flash of red and gold, Draco’s a pale grey, the same colour as the overcast sky.
The incredible presumptuousness of this statement annoyed Draco only slightly less than the fact that what Potter said was true, at least in part. It wasn’t the prestige of the thing that Draco cared about most, not exactly.
“What am
“You know what I mean.”
“That’s not— we’re not—” Draco floundered. He wasn’t sure how to answer without denying it outright. Pansy wasn’t wrong, exactly, and she’d never believe such a blatant lie. Better to keep it simple and just stick to the main point. “We’re not going to sit with them. You don’t even like them, especially not Granger and Weasley.”
“She’d probably want to know.”
Weasley was the first to notice them. His eyes widened, clearly caught off guard by their presence, and then just as quickly narrowed again, heavy with suspicion. Granger looked up from her parchment a second later, staring at them in surprise for only the briefest of moments before glancing over at Potter. The dark-haired boy still seemed unaware of the two Slytherins, too occupied with the notes he was scribbling on the sheaf of parchment spread across his lap.
Luckily, Draco didn’t have to worry about following through on any half-baked threats; this time, it was obvious to both of them that the potion was working. After ten minutes of soaking in the solution, the scar on their test skin had smoothed into a narrow line, and after twenty minutes, it had disappeared altogether.
“I still think you should’ve just gone with Theo Nott. He’s a bit of a tosser but at least you’d have nice-looking children.” Blaise began to serve himself toast, throwing a few slices onto Draco’s empty plate as he did.
“It’s not like that.” There was anger in Potter’s voice now. Or was it frustration? As Draco watched, Potter sidestepped past his friend, moving right in Draco’s direction. Judging from the set of his jaw, he wasn’t happy with the way the conversation was going. “We’re not kids anymore, Ron. Things have changed. And if I’m able to—”
“Mr. Malfoy?” He could feel Professor Hayward looking at him, along with the rest of the class. He didn’t take his eyes off Potter.
Rage seethed beneath his skin, and Draco had to press his nails into his palms to keep his hands from trembling with it.
They were both breathing heavily. Draco could see the rise and fall of Potter’s chest, fast and irregular. A chill hung in the air and Draco wasn’t sure if it was real or imagined, the fading ghost of memory.
Halfway to the Great Hall, Draco stopped, slumping to the floor with his back against the wall. He knew what he had to do now, although the thought made him nauseous. What other choice did he have?
“You will?”
“What is that from?” Draco was finding it hard to look away from Potter’s exposed forearm, even as he began to roll his sleeve back down.
Draco spared a glance at the picture of an unsmiling, square-jawed young man wearing heavy bloodred robes. “He’s certainly not the worst-looking one she’s found.”
Draco wrapped his hand around the one that was trying to push him away, pressing it against his face as he took Potter as deep as he could without choking, not breaking his rhythm. For just a second, his eyes flickered up to Potter’s face, meeting his gaze just before Potter gave one last moan, throwing his head back against the wall as he came.
At the sound of his shout, Madam Pomfrey was out the door of her office in an instant.  Immediately, Potter pulled away, stepping back from the bed as the matron rushed over.
They lapsed into silence as they perused. In an unspoken agreement, Draco started on one side of the shop – ingredients beginning with letters A through L lining the shelves – while Potter took the other.
Draco wanted to retort. Instead, he took a deep breath, steeling himself.
Gingerly, he set down his bag on the marble tiles, pulling out several stoppered glass bottles filled with dark liquid. They’d brewed the potion ahead of time, dividing a full cauldron’s worth between four large vials. In any other circumstance, that amount of potion would be excessive, but Draco had worried that the size of the tub would dilute it too much, rendering it less effective. Never one to be unprepared, he had even brought his potion kit and a handful of the necessary ingredients just in case they needed more, although he hoped that what they already had would suffice. The potion took over an hour to brew, and with the nervous knots still twisting in his gut, Draco wasn’t keen to prolong the evening.
Draco spoke quietly, hoping maybe Granger and Weasley would be too wrapped up in their disgustingly couple-y giggling to hear. But Potter heard; those green eyes fixed on him, unsettling as ever.
Pansy snorted softly. “Yeah, no shit.”
This was not the answer Draco had expected. “Your potions skills improved because you had help from Snape’s old textbook?” he scoffed. “Potter, you do realize that you had Snape actually teaching you for five years before that, right?”
Potter sighed, resting his chin on one hand and drumming his fingers on the edge of the table as they waited. It took all of Draco’s willpower to stop himself from stilling Potter’s restless hand with his own.
“Mr. Malfoy, since you have more experience with Occlumency,” Professor Hayward was saying, her words sounding oddly distant, “I think it would make sense for Mr. Potter to attempt to break into your thoughts, while you try to defend against him.”
Dear Salazar, did Draco really have to spell it out for him? “I need your name, Potter,” Draco snapped, unable to smother his irritation at the Gryffindor’s obtuseness, though he knew anger would not serve him well just then.
“Don’t say that.”
The change wasn’t dramatic, or instantaneous. Time went on as it had before, the days filled with a repeating pattern of classes, studying, potion experiments, and hidden kisses. And somewhere in the routine of it all, there were small moments in which the difference could be felt.
Draco felt his cheeks warm. “Well, that’s easy for you to say, isn’t it? You’re not the one being stared at by some pervert while you strip.”
Draco closed his eyes, overcome with his own foolishness. For a moment, he had dared to forget who he was, and how everyone saw him. He had dared to believe that his skill and intelligence were all that mattered, had dared to hope that possibilities like these were still open to him. Slughorn was right; it was obvious, so painfully obvious that Draco hated himself for not seeing it.
“That was different,” Potter muttered. Draco rolled his eyes.
“After dinner,” he conceded.
he told himself.
“I’m very pleased that most have you have made such substantial progress,” Slughorn announced, circling back to the front of the room. “If brewed properly, your potions should age well over the next few days and be ready by our next meeting. If not…”
“I just did, alright?” Potter evaded, sounding more defensive than Draco thought he had any right to be. “Now, what kind of potion are we making?”
“Potter.”
“Obviously,” Draco replied, although that wasn’t really what meant he had meant. In fairness to other students, the eighth years weren’t allowed to participate on their House teams, so neither Draco nor Potter were playing that year. But the Slytherin team had been gutted even beyond that. Across all years, a large number of Slytherins had chosen not to return to Hogwarts, in some cases because their families had had ties to the Dark Lord and in other cases because their families worried about how they might be treated, regardless of their actual allegiances in the war.
“I do.” Draco glanced down the now empty corridor. “We’re going to be late to Transfiguration if we don’t hurry. I’ll meet you in the Potions classroom after last period?”
Still—
Three days was more than enough. Draco was done with avoiding and being avoided by Potter. It was silly and childish and by Merlin, he was not about to let all of the stress and confusion Potter had caused him be for nothing just because of a few awkward moments. And if Potter decided that he didn’t want to be associated with a Death Eater anymore now that it was all over the
The first tinge of anxiety had only just begun to set in when he heard Potter moan, a quiet sound that Draco felt like a jolt of heat straight to his core. He repeated the action that had provoked the noise – pressing the tip of his tongue against the underside of Potter’s cock as he pulled back, catching slightly on the head – and was immediately rewarded with another groan. It was restrained, as if Potter was trying to hold the sound back and hadn’t quite succeeded, but it was more than enough to ease Draco’s concern. Despite his inexperience, Potter seemed to be enjoying it.
Determined not to have another conversation like the one that had left him so confused the other night, Draco murmured his thanks to the Potions Professor and left the room quickly, hurrying to get to the Great Hall where he knew Pansy would be waiting for him at dinner. Unfortunately, he didn’t move fast enough.
“Malfoy…” Draco looked up as Potter stepped closer, his breath hitching as he felt his knees brush against the bare skin of Potter’s legs underwater. A flash of heat coursed through him, his mind suddenly racing at the thought of what other exposed parts he might brush against.
?” he repeated in disbelief. “Your idea of a nice coming out moment involved the phrase ‘yeah, no shit’?”
Some students headed towards their dorms while others broke off into groups, chatting and taking up places in the chairs around the room. Even Blaise and Pansy had quickly gone to claim seats by the fire with another Slytherin, Millicent Bulstrode, and were now beckoning him over. Goyle, loyal bloke that he was, had stuck by Draco’s side without question, though he was beginning to edge towards the others, his eyes flickering uncertainly between them and Draco. No one else, it seemed, had any reservations about this new setup. No one except Draco.
“That’s the rumour, anyway.” She was watching him very closely in that way she had that made Draco nervous, as if his thoughts were spelled out across his face for her to read. He pushed himself roughly up into a sitting position, turning his back to her.
“So, are you going to tell me what got your knickers in such a twist?”
“What the bloody hell do you know about babies, Potter?” Draco’s scoff was only slightly muffled as he pulled his jumper over his head. “Got a little Chosen One running around out there?”
“She’s not?”
“It’s not the worst reaction.”
There was still no sign of the owner, or any other employee for that matter, which was something of a relief. It was easier to focus when he didn’t feel like he was being watched. In the past, he might not have given it a second thought, but nowadays, the eyes that followed him were too often filled with disgust and hate. He was also all too conscious of Potter’s presence, of what people would think seeing them together, although it was ultimately unavoidable. They’d have to cross paths with someone at some point, someone who would raise an eyebrow at the pair of them together, maybe worse. But for now, he was content to be left alone, without their every interaction being scrutinized.
Draco had hoped that, after a while, he might get used to Potter’s uncanny stare. But the weight of the green eyes was heavy as ever, seeming to follow him even after they parted ways each evening. Some nights, it would trail Draco all the way back to his dormitory where he would lie awake, wrapped up in green. More than once, looking up at the emerald fabric of his canopy, he found his hands slipping under his pyjama bottoms, stroking himself with an unexplained desperation until the green exploded into stars. He found he slept much better those nights.
It occurred to Draco as he was pulling off his tie that maybe, just maybe, Pansy thought
Draco let out a breath he hadn’t realized he’d been holding. McGonagall had started speaking, but it took Draco another long moment before he could focus on what she was saying. That infuriating green stare had gotten under his skin, a particular talent of Potter’s.
“Now, I know it’s not much time, but I’ll need to submit your names and a brief explanation of the subject of your project by next week. Do you think you can come up with an idea by then of what kind of potion you’d like to develop?”
“Then it would have been well deserved, wouldn’t it?” Draco kept his tone light, although it felt like anything but a joke.
The silence between them stretched like a rubber band, tense and quivering, ready to either snap or break. Potter seemed caught in some sort of internal conflict, chewing on his bottom lip as he watched Draco, turmoil in his eyes. After a long moment, the Gryffindor pushed away from his side of the bath, moving slowly through the water towards Draco.
He scowled and turned away, doing his best to pay attention as Slughorn described the dreadfully tricky process of brewing the Wolfsbane Potion.
“I just got tired of those same silly furnishings, it’s like we’re still first years,” Draco muttered, focused on the precise movement of his knife as he started dicing his aconite root. What else was he supposed to tell Blaise? That the green had reminded him too much of Potter’s eyes and he couldn’t stand it? It sounded mad even to Draco, and he was certain that Blaise would misunderstand. His friends liked to read too much into everything Draco did recently.
The potion had become more viscous with the addition of the Murtlap tentacles, although it was still too liquid to be able to easily apply as a topical solution without making a mess. Later, once they managed to get the potion to work properly, they could worry about making it into a more usable consistency, like an ointment. For now, Draco just used his wand to transfer a small amount of the potion to his skin, not minding that some of it ended up dripping down his chest.
“Mr. Malfoy,” she began, clasping her hands behind her back as she came to stand at the end of his bed, “It is good to see you looking alert. How are you feeling?”
“Pansy…” he warned, trying to convey with his eyes what he couldn’t say out loud. What did she think she was playing at? Potter sat up in his chair, watching with interest as Pansy patted Draco’s hand and gave him a quick kiss on the cheek, pointedly ignoring his threatening glower.
He didn’t have to look to know the expression of disbelief on Pansy’s face.
“We could—”
– but just as they had before, the words stuck in his throat. And maybe, in the end, it was better to just show him anyway.
Potter’s hand began to move, startling Draco. He knew that this was much too risky to continue; they hadn’t even locked the door when they’d come into the classroom. They needed to end this now, before anyone else wandered in. It was foolish to keep going, and yet when he met Potter’s eyes, he could not seem to summon the words to stop him.
It was ridiculous to even consider it, absolute lunacy. But some wild urge drove him, and, forgetting his injuries, he attempted to use both of his arms to support himself as he moved to close the distance between them. Draco could almost feel the heat of Potter’s breath on his lips when his left arm collapsed under him, and he cried out as he fell back against the bed, pain lancing through his ribs.
But the Irish idiot didn’t seem keen to let it go. “How many curses will it take for you to realize that no one wants you here, Malfoy?” Finnigan jeered.
Upon hearing his own name, Draco could no longer resist. As quietly as he could, he got up and moved over to the bookcase that stood between him and the subjects of his eavesdropping. He briefly considered casting a nonverbal Disillusionment Charm over himself, just in case, but decided against it. Even if he were caught, which he doubted he would be, he had a good enough chance at plausible deniability. It wasn’t as if the Gryffindors had a monopoly on using the library, and he had been there first anyway.
He silenced that voice quickly. It wasn’t a date, he had absolutely no reason to believe it was, and he certainly had no reason to worry about what Potter thought of his response to a silly question.
“How do you think the Slytherin team will do in the first match?”
With one last deep breath, he shoved down the uneasy flutter in his stomach and headed over to where Potter was waiting for him just past the statue of Boris the Bewildered. Oddly enough, Potter looked almost as nervous as Draco felt; he couldn’t seem to stop running his hand over his hair, as if caught in some futile quest to smooth it down. The characteristic gesture nearly made Draco smile, but he quickly suppressed the urge.
Nevertheless, he approached Slughorn’s desk with apprehension, keeping his eyes fixed forward even as he felt Potter step up beside him, unpleasantly close to his side.
“It worked,” Potter agreed with a grin. His hands were warm where they rested on Draco’s waist, the pressure steadying. “I think this calls for celebration.”
The kiss was cold and sweet with rainwater. Draco wrapped his arms around Potter, holding tight against him as the thunder rumbled overhead. It wasn’t as passionate as their last kiss, far less fire in the way that Potter nipped at his lip and chased his tongue, but Draco liked it all the more for it. It was an unhurried kiss, light and breathless, soft at its edges.
“I wasn’t—”
“Yes, let’s go.” He grabbed hold of Pansy’s arm and all but dragged her towards the door, sparing only the briefest of glances over his shoulder at the dark-haired Gryffindor.
Draco threw himself down beside Blaise in a huff. Though he tried not to, he couldn’t help stealing a quick glance in Potter’s direction. The Gryffindor trio had their heads together at a table on the opposite side of the room, whispering and gesturing in a way that Draco was sure meant they were talking about him.
The change in Draco’s demeanour must have been more noticeable than he thought, because as they reached the third floor, Potter asked, voice hesitant, “Is something wrong?”
Weasley’s brow furrowed, clearly disbelieving, but at that moment Granger stepped in.
“Yes, that’s all,” Draco waved him away dismissively. “Go stuff your face, as usual.”
Draco’s breath caught in his throat as Potter reached towards him, his fingers hovering near Draco’s collarbone. Potter seemed to hesitate then, swallowing hard as he stared at his own hand extended between them.
“It might even be our best so far.” The cheerfulness in Potter’s tone was baffling. If the potion reacted that poorly with healthy skin tissue, it had almost no promise on scar tissue, but somehow Potter still seemed to view it as a success. Draco had never allowed himself to indulge in that kind of foolish optimism, and yet somehow, at Potter’s words, he felt his spirits lifting. Relative to their previous tests, Potter did have a point: maybe this attempt wasn’t ideal, but it also wasn’t nearly as bad as many of the others.
The realization was enough to spur Draco back into motion. He pulled Potter’s lips roughly against his own, using his hold on Potter’s shirt to move them further away from the desks. He guided them blindly, tripping a bit over his own feet before he felt his back hit the wall, inadvertently biting Potter’s lip as the other stumbled against him. Liking the sensation, Draco did it again, this time a quick, deliberate pressure of his teeth against Potter’s bottom lip before he soothed over the spot with his tongue.
Draco shifted slightly away from Potter’s intent gaze, angling his shoulder so that he wouldn’t feel quite so exposed as he undid first one button, then two, his actions uncharacteristically clumsy. It wasn’t until he reached the last button that he chanced a glance at Potter, who was watching him with an odd expression on his face.
Blaise prodded at the flames beneath his cauldron with his wand until they reached the low, steady level that Draco had already achieved.
Draco’s stomach dropped, and he wished more than anything that he could take the question back. “Oh.”
Draco drew back the curtain. With Madam Pomfrey gone, there was no need for privacy; Pansy had seen him in various stages of undress too many times to count.
“—he was published a few years later, as I’m sure you know, and I like to think that—”
He thought then of another green, a truly abhorrent colour: the green of a pair of eyes behind rounded glasses, the same ones that had fixated on him from across the Great Hall.
Potter’s face was calm, but his irises blazed, emotions glittering like sparks. He would be so very easy to read.
“Oh, er.” Potter instinctively pulled the parchment he was holding closer to himself, as if to hide it. For the first time, Draco noticed that there was also a book open on Potter’s lap, which seemed to be serving a dual purpose as a writing surface while Potter took notes. Upon closer inspection, the page of the book that wasn’t covered by Potter’s notes did appear to be a list of instructions for a potion, complete with tiny sketches of the ingredients. “It’s not for class. It’s just… some research.”
It was all Potter’s fault, he concluded, shaking himself out of his daze and heading across the hall to the showers. It was Potter’s fault that he had felt so weird and unsettled since coming back to Hogwarts, Potter’s fault that Pansy had started insinuating crazy things, Potter’s fault that he was now doubting his own sanity.
Sitting in that courtroom, head bowed and hands trembling, Draco had been sure that he would never see sunlight again. The sky had been clear and blue the day of the trial; he had soaked in every second of it as they brought him from Azkaban, where they had kept all of the Death Eaters awaiting trial after the battle at Hogwarts. Those few blissful minutes of warmth, he had thought, would surely be his last. They would hear of his cruelty and his failures, they would see his cowardice, and they would throw him straight back to that tiny stone cell. It would have been no more than he deserved.
He didn’t have to look up to know that Potter was still watching him. Where else would he be looking? There was nothing else, not right now; no distance beyond or between, just them and their ragged breaths and rapid hearts – Draco’s much too loud, too obvious. He could feel it racing as his fingers ran along the edge of Potter’s briefs – only a hint of teasing – before hooking over the elastic and pulling it down. He licked his lips and swallowed once, heavily, and then his mouth was around Potter’s cock.
“Don’t,” he said before Potter could speak, hating how quiet his voice was, how it wavered. “You don’t have to—”
“You could leave,” Draco muttered, tapping the first vial with his wand to uncork it. The response came like a reflex to him, and he didn’t think much of it until he saw Potter lean back from the table and reach for his bag as if he really was about to go. At once, Draco wished he could take it back. Despite how on-edge the Gryffindor made him feel and how hard Draco had fought against him being there, Draco didn’t really want him to leave. It had simply never occurred to him that if he pushed too hard, Potter might actually give up.
“I already asked.” He spoke through gritted teeth. “It has to be you.”
“Get away from me, Potter!” He struck out with his right arm this time, shoving the other boy roughly back. “Don’t touch me!”
He didn’t know if Potter replied; he wasn’t listening anymore. A wild idea was buzzing in his head, loud and insistent and outrageous enough to drown out all else, even his annoyance at Pansy.
“If those are too heavy for you, maybe we should just go back to the dorms,” he suggested, watching with amusement as she attempted to cram the books into her own bag.
“Sorry, sir,” he mumbled. For the first time, he seemed intent on avoiding Draco’s gaze.
“Well… thanks.” Another word Draco was unaccustomed to saying to Potter, but this one at least felt a little less painful. “I’ll tell Slughorn tomorrow. Or, actually…” He remembered Slughorn’s words from earlier, cautioning him not to pressure Potter into something he didn’t want to do. “Could you tell him that you changed your mind?”
doing me favours. I don’t get it.” He raked his hands back through his hair, a rare gesture for him given how fussy he was about his appearance. “I don’t get
Pansy raised one perfectly arched eyebrow as she smoothed her Charms notes on the arm of the sofa, a feigned disinterest so well-crafted that Draco might have admired it, if he weren’t so apprehensive about whatever was about to come out of her mouth.
“Your scars.” The water rippled around them as Potter stopped just in front of Draco’s knees. Draco gripped the edge of the seat beneath him, bracing himself, although for what exactly he couldn’t say. “The ones we’re testing the potion on, they’re… they’re from…”
They stood there like two people stupefied, caught in mutual shock and wordless understanding. Draco didn’t have to ask what Potter was doing there; on some level, he knew. But the silence was too much, and after seconds that seemed to last years, he finally dared to break it.
Draco blinked, face growing warm when he realized that he had been so wrapped up in his own thoughts that he had missed Potter’s question.
“I’ll do it.”
Draco shoved his things into his bag, halfway to the door when Slughorn’s voice called after him.
This… well. Draco didn’t know what this was. It was still clumsy at times, frantic at others. They were teenagers still, but adults too. The facts of it were perhaps not so different, but somehow it was a world apart, incomparable in every way. Draco suspected that Potter was not nearly as inexperienced, so he knew it probably wasn’t the same for him, not quite so breathtaking in every sense of the word.
It was lucky, Draco thought with a sort of dark, private humour, that both he and Potter were used to late nights with little sleep. They took full advantage of the later curfew that the eighth years were afforded, even daring to push past it on occasion when they got absorbed in their work. It was something of a precarious balance, working on the potion while also trying to keep up with the regular workload of their classes in preparation for their N.E.W.T.s at the end of the school year.
“Could I talk to you for a minute?”
By a combination of sheer luck and some desperate clutching at the banister, he managed to stay upright, barely regaining his footing before he was off again. He could hear Blaise’s footsteps pounding behind him but he didn’t bother to pause and let the other boy catch up.
But Madam Pomfrey put up a fight, and it was only after making both him and Pansy swear that he would return the minute he felt anything amiss that she officially released him, although she was still shaking her head as she left him to change.
“Why?” Draco pushed away from the desk, turning to face Potter fully. The distance between them was no longer quite so careful, both of them toeing an invisible line. Draco wasn’t sure what would happen if they crossed it, and he didn’t know which possibility he was most afraid of.
His fingers were steady as he tugged down Potter’s trousers, just enough to expose where he was straining against the material of his underwear. They remained steady as he touched Potter through the fabric, brushing featherlight against the hard heat, rubbing softly over the small wet spot near the tip. Potter’s breathing hitched and Draco could see his palms pressed back flat against the wall, like he was clinging to it for support.
“We’re supposed to write 12 inches on conjuring complex vertebrates
Up to that point, the shop had seemed empty of anyone else, but as soon as Draco approached the counter, someone appeared so quickly it was almost as if out of thin air. Startled, Draco took a step backward, nearly treading on Potter’s foot in the process. The shopkeeper – a squat, bearded old man in olive-coloured robes – squinted between them, lips pressed in a thin line. Maybe Draco was just being paranoid, but he felt sure the man recognized them, although he said nothing as he accepted the coins that Draco handed him, and he disappeared from sight once more almost as soon as Draco turned away.
“It doesn’t matter if it was five seconds or five hours, the potion is still ruined!”
, I will personally… Oh.” The threat faded on his tongue when he saw Potter’s grin. Of course, the Gryffindor was just messing with him. Draco scowled, shoving his stool back from the table. “You’re not nearly as funny as you think you are, you know.”
He might never have understood the real depth of Potter’s pretence had he not gotten up late one night to go to the bathroom, long after everyone else was asleep. He didn’t notice Potter right away; after the darkness of his dormitory, the light of the bathroom was almost blinding, and he was halfway to the toilets before the reflection in the mirror caught his eye.
That evening, Draco holed himself up in the library after dinner in an effort to give Potter some space, since it seemed his strategy of trying to force the Gryffindor into conversation wasn’t working. Isolating himself with a stack of books also seemed like a good way to refocus his attention on what mattered most: the potion. They had recently discovered that the addition of Bubotuber pus, while promising in its healing properties, seemed to react poorly with the Shrake spine over time, resulting in several shattered vials and a deeply unpleasant smell that, try as he might, Draco had not been able to remove from his best pair of dragonhide gloves.
Pansy glared. “You said you’d meet me in the Great Hall for dinner and you never showed up,” she accused, folding her arms across her chest. “What do you call that?”
“He asked for my help and I said yes. It’s not a big deal.”
Draco looked up. Potter’s expression was thoughtful as he examined the patch of skin.
“I am also happy to welcome back those students who have returned for an eighth year in order to complete their N.E.W.T.s.”
“Don’t worry, Pans.” He reached across the table to grab her hand, giving it a reassuring squeeze. “If your mum disinherits you, you can come live with me, alright? And, hell, I’ll marry you if it comes to it, although I don’t think that would be any less of a disaster, honestly.”
Potter squinted at him. “Why not just do it yourself then, or get someone else? I don’t know what Slughorn was on about, honestly,” he said, shaking his head. “I’m really not that good at Potions. I’m sure he’d change his mind if you asked.”
They fixed their clothes quickly enough after that, cleaning the mess with a simple spell. Draco gathered his bookbag in silence, much more aware now of the sounds from the hallway. He wouldn’t have known what to say even if he wanted to, and for once, Potter didn’t press. Reality seeped back in between them, the icy edges of it pushing them apart, and for an instant Draco couldn’t help but wonder if they had ever really closed the distance at all.
Draco paused in his writing to look across the table at Potter, who was staring at him with his brow furrowed. Not for the first time, Draco wondered just how thick Potter could really be.
“Everyone thinks that, Potter. Don’t be naïve.”
Looking out over the undisturbed surface of the lake, the cool air smelling pleasantly of damp grass, Draco felt the chaos in his mind begin to settle. After a restless night, he had gotten up while it was still dark and slipped out of the castle with his broom in hand, knowing that no one else would be awake at such an early hour on a Saturday morning. He had flown laps around the Quidditch pitch until the sun finally began to creep over the horizon, streaking the empty stands with the golden hues of morning light.
, it’s feminine. But if you’re really so bothered, I can take my shrill voice elsewhere.” She looked over at Potter, who had so far showed no signs of leaving, a wicked glint in her eyes. “I’m sure you and
Pansy pouted. “C’mon, Draco, I know you didn’t eat lunch.”
“Ah, Mr. Malfoy.” The timely arrival of Madam Pomfrey came as a tremendous relief.  “I am glad to see you awake, although I cannot say I’m surprised, what with all this noise,” the matronly witch admonished as she motioned Pansy out of her way with an impatient gesture. She leaned over the bed to examine Draco’s left side, which for the first time he noticed was rather heavily bandaged. “Ms. Parkinson, Mr. Potter, you both should know better than to raise your voices here, of all places. Next time, take your bickering outside.”
Pansy pursed her lips and levelled him with a glare. She looked rather like his mother when she did that, which was enough to make him yield.
“Yes.” Draco looked away from the sugary display, not even slightly tempted by it. “I don’t like sweets much.”
Pansy, still admiring her own pink lace-trimmed gloves, turned to Draco. “Shall we get dinner?”
?” he scoffed, incredulous. Potter, if it were possible, looked even more shocked.
Potter’s brow furrowed slightly. “You know, I never really thought about it before,” he said thoughtfully, glancing between the cauldron and the vials. “I’ve had so many injuries that were healed with magic that never left any scar. And then, others…”
“Yeah. Yeah, okay.”
“That he’s
Potter cleared his throat. “Did you find anything?”
Draco shrugged. “I’m not hungry.”
Draco clenched his hands into fists at his side as Finnigan stepped towards him. He should have seen this coming, should have known that even the smallest of sparks could light Finnigan’s quick temper, and yet he hadn’t been able to help his subtle provocation. But Draco could not afford to get into any sort of trouble, no matter who started it, and so even as Finnigan drew closer, wand pointed straight at his chest, Draco made no move to defend himself. No matter that every fibre of his being screamed at him to draw his wand and fight, Draco stood still, teeth gritted.
Yet, there was something about the way Potter had asked – the forced casualness of his tone, as if he was trying too hard to make it sound like an offhand suggestion – and the way he was fidgeting in his seat now, inexplicably tense, that made Draco wonder if it didn’t seem almost like Potter was asking him on a
How cruel Potter was, Draco thought, to provoke him with those suggestive words and that heated look—that impossible look, as if he might have actually
It was the moment of truth. Seconds ticked by while Potter chewed his lip. “Er…”
Draco couldn’t take it anymore. He got enough of this shit from Pansy. Who did Potter think he was, criticizing Draco for how he was coping?
Goyle and Draco both laughed but Pansy seemed unamused. “I’m glad this is all such a great joke to you guys,” she snapped, snatching the photo back from Goyle and crumpling it in her fist. “It’s not like it’s my life or anything.”
Draco’s stomach dropped. Slughorn must have overheard them in the corridor before class. Draco fell back, grimacing in reply to Blaise’s curious expression as the other boy brushed past him out the door. A few feet away, Potter was waving a dismissive hand at his own friends, who seemed inclined to linger.
“I didn’t, really. I just...” Potter hesitated. “I just knew I wasn’t going to let them take you back to Azkaban. You never should have been there.”
“I’ll take a look at this later,” he patted the recipe they had given him along with the sample of the potion, which Draco had spent the previous night writing out in precise, painstaking detail. “I’ll see if there are any tweaks we can make, just to put the finishing touches on it. But I’m sure there won’t be much to change.” He gazed fondly between them, absently patting at the potion recipe again, as if it were a prized pet. “I had faith in you two. Brilliant, the both of you. I knew you could do it.”
“What are you on about?” Despite his annoyance, Draco made no move to shake off Potter’s hand. At this point it seemed like pig-headed Potter probably wouldn’t let him leave without a fight, anyway. “Not two days ago you told me—”
For a long moment, Potter just stared at him. The intensity of his gaze was such that Draco thought he might as well be standing there naked for how exposed he felt. “Why does this matter so much to you? This competition?”
Draco’s eyes flickered to the infamous scar on Potter’s forehead, wondering what other injuries had left permanent marks on his body.
“As I suspected,” she murmured, tucking her wand back into the pocket of her robes.
“Tomorrow, Potter,” he called out. “Don’t be late.”
“Well,” Potter’s grip shifted, hands slipping beneath the open fabric of Draco’s shirt. “I think since you’ve already gone to the trouble of undoing all these buttons, you might as well just take this off. That seems to me like a good place to start.”
“And they just
Frankly, Draco was surprised that it had taken this long. The way gossip spread around this school, he guessed that the rumours about the incident must be somewhere between fantastically embellished and astronomically inaccurate at this point. The article in the
“Well, before you were hexed, I sort of got the impression you wanted to talk to me, or yell at me, or something.” A small smiled played on Potter’s lips. “You weren’t going to attack me, were you? I would hate to think I lied to Professor McGonagall.”
Potions theory is fascinating to me and I spent wayyy too much time researching potion ingredients for this chapter…
Only months ago, “appropriate punishment” would have meant the Cruciatus Curse, administered either by the Carrows themselves or by a student under duress. A student like him, threatened with his own torture and that of his family. Bile rose in his throat as he remembered standing over a boy of no more than fourteen—perhaps even a third year Hufflepuff like Miranda McKinnon—and raising his wand, hand shaking as Amycus Carrow hissed in his ear all the things that could happen to Draco’s mother if he didn’t obey. He remembered the screams.
“Come on, let’s go, then.”
Though it was still mid-afternoon, the heavy clouds made it seem much later, all traces of sunlight obscured. The breeze from earlier had died down and the air felt weighted in its stillness, charged in the almost electric sort of way it always did just before a storm.
Benches scraped against the stone floors as students rose to leave. Draco and his friends stayed seated, as did the other eighth years. McGonagall waited until the last of the younger students had filed out of the Great Hall before she swept between the tables and gestured them all over to the doors.
“No, that wasn’t the case,” Potter cut him off. “Malfoy wasn’t going to attack me.”
He snatched his wand from the bedside table. One simple spell later and all of the décor in the room had turned a muted shade of aubergine. The effect was quite ugly, but Draco sat back, satisfied. Aubergine he could live with.
The words sprang into his mind unbidden, the phrase he had repeated over and over in his dream. He flushed as the images he had tried to suppress returned, all of which involved the black-haired boy currently sitting beside him, albeit in much more compromising positions. As much as he wanted to tear his gaze away, he could not help but stare at the breadth of Potter’s shoulders, the exposed skin of his neck, the curve of his mouth…
This response only seemed to amuse Potter more.
“Well, that’s too bad,” Potter replied smoothly. “I suppose I should go tell Slughorn, then, that I’ve decided not to participate after all.” He smiled even as Draco’s face twisted with fury. He had Draco now, and he knew it.
began to sound like
“You’re just lucky the spell stuck to your own wardrobe,” Blaise said, changing Draco’s tie back to its proper colours with an indolent wave of his wand before pulling on his dragonhide gloves. Aconite, Slughorn had reminded them, was highly toxic and better not to handle directly. “That colour is revolting, it makes you look even more peaky than usual.”
Draco thought uselessly.
It was all exceedingly normal. Still a bit awkward, sure, but Draco was starting to think that maybe that was just him. Sitting alone in the Potions classroom with Potter that evening, it was difficult not to let his thoughts stray. Even the most innocuous exchange left Draco’s mouth a little dry, remembering the roughness in Potter’s voice when he’d said Draco’s name, just before he came.
Draco, curious as to what Potter could possibly be doing, gave a nod, watching as Potter pushed up the sleeve of his shirt and then dipped the spoon into the potion. Draco moved closer, having to lean around the cauldron to see what Potter was doing. With his forearm now exposed, Draco could see a large circular scar just below his elbow, pale against his skin. Intrigued, he watched as Potter carefully dripped a small amount of the potion onto the scar, the rose-coloured liquid absorbing the moment it made contact with his skin. They were both silent, waiting, and as they watched, the colour of the scar shifted just a shade closer to Potter’s regular skin tone, and the edges of the mark seemed to blur a little. It was an almost imperceptible change, but it was something.
Draco found this to be a very odd response. “Potter? Why would I be talking to Potter half-dressed?”
, which at least meant he was now free to return to his earlier pursuit: trying to look at Potter while pretending he wasn’t looking at Potter.
Draco wasn’t sure if he should be offended by that or not. “Maybe I just wasn’t interested in you.”
Pansy sighed. They both knew the food was not the issue, but at that moment, Blaise leaned across the table to ask her something, saving Draco from further scrutiny. Uninterested in whatever banal topic his friends had launched into discussing, Draco let his gaze wander.
“Yeah.” Potter bit his lip, looking towards the painting on the wall where the long-haired mermaid dozed peacefully on her rock. “I figured that out after I came here. I never would’ve gotten it without Cedric.” His voice sounded far away then, eyes clouded, as if he were seeing something other than the marble walls around him.
Draco felt the scrape of teeth as their lips clashed, searching for a rhythm, and this was new, mostly, but it didn’t feel strange. Draco’s right hand was fisted in the fabric of Potter’s shirt, and when he mirrored the gesture with his left, soft dark hair tangling between his fingers, Potter let out a quiet groan and broke away from the kiss, moving only far enough to put a few centimetres of distance between their lips.
“I suppose.”
that Potter finally had to drag him out of the store, teasing him all the while. They wandered briefly through Dervish and Banges, Draco trying his best to ignore the sidelong glances of the curious shop assistant, then lingered over the newest Firebolt model at the Quidditch supply shop, discussing the design improvements in reverent tones.
“That’s good to know,” he replied slowly. “Because I don’t hate you either.”
McGonagall paused, anticipating the cheers that arose. Draco knew better than to think the enthusiasm extended to him. Nearly everyone had turned to look towards the Gryffindor table, and shouts of “Harry! Harry!” rang across the hall.
“What’s that?”
“Well, I wouldn’t have had to if you would just—”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Ron?”
Draco did remember then. He closed his eyes, thinking back to that flash of blue light with a growing sense of unease. He recalled the excruciating pain, much sharper then than it was now, but the memory that caused him the most distress was of a dark-haired figure leaning over him as he lay on the stone floor, saying his name over and over again. Someone with round glasses and very green eyes.
After two months of work filled with late nights and countless experiments, they had finally succeeded.
“What do you mean?” A handful of other students were already in the corridor. He and Blaise had managed to arrive just a few minutes before the bell. “You’re the one who said we were going to be late!”
“What is that supposed to mean?” Draco demanded, his rage building.
Draco stuffed another book into his bag, which was now straining at the seams. “I’m not hungry.”
He pushed down the wave of nausea that had almost threatened to overcome him, looking at McGonagall with a steady gaze as he said, “I don’t want her to be punished. The McKinnon girl, I mean. It was just a mistake.”
Draco knew better than to try and avoid Potter. They shared half their classes, not to mention a common room, and they still had a potion to finish. Avoidance was a short-lived strategy at best. Still—
“I don’t even know who all is on the team this year, to be honest,” Draco said. “Even if we have some new players that are strong on their own, they probably haven’t had enough time practicing together to play well as a team.”
He was pleased to feel the way Potter shivered when his fingers dared to sneak under the hem of the Gryffindor’s shirt, skating over the soft skin of his abdomen. But the tables were quickly turned on him, Draco gasping as Potter’s knee pressed between his legs. His head fell back against the wall, overwhelmed by the hard line of Potter’s arousal resting against his own, and Potter took the opportunity to trail his lips down Draco’s neck. His thumb traced the line of Draco’s jaw and settled over the rabbit-fast beat of his pulse, keeping Draco’s head tilted so that he could kiss all the way down to Draco’s collarbone, leaving a bite at the juncture of his shoulder and neck before tracing a teasing path back up with the tip of his tongue.
Maybe it sounded like an admission of more than it was, and maybe he meant it as more, and maybe Potter understood what he meant regardless, because he smiled then, soft and bright.
It felt like a lifetime ago that they were in that bathroom, so different than the one they were in now. A lifetime ago that he was the boy full of rage and fear, bleeding on the floor.
The quiet exertion of flying had done him some good. By the time he came to sit near the edge of the Black Lake, arms wrapped around his knees as he watched the sky over the water fade into a pale, cloudless blue, his thoughts were no longer racing, the breath in his lungs no longer constricted by the weight of anxiety.
“Back off, Potter,” Draco commanded, shoving at Potter’s bony knee. They were sitting quite close together, having both gravitated toward the cauldron as they worked. Although it hadn’t bothered Draco until then, he now found everything about Potter’s presence a source of irritation.
Draco glanced down at where their hands were caught between their bodies, as if that might clarify the issue, but it proved unhelpful. The sight of Potter pressed against him was distractingly arousing, but not at all enlightening. When he looked up again, Potter was watching him.
“Do you want to go to Hogsmeade with me?”
“Come on, out with it, Malfoy.” Draco could not focus on what Potter was saying. At the sound of his name, all he could think of was what it would feel like whispered against his skin. “What is it?”
“Do you miss it?”
“Mr. Potter?” Draco could see the way Potter tensed at Professor Hayward’s question before he raised his head to look at her. “Do you have experience with Occlumency? Or Legilimency, perhaps?”
And yet here Potter was, asking when they could get back to work. Perhaps the situation was not so dire as Draco had thought.
Instantly, Draco’s mind was flooded with images. There was no resistance. The memories were not his own, the angles of them entirely foreign, but there was something familiar about the scenes that flashed through his mind one after another. He was in the Great Hall, looking across the room to where a head of white-blond hair was slumped over the Slytherin table, avoiding meeting anyone’s eyes; he was in the Charms classroom, the words
at you.”
Draco reached across the divide between them, grabbing the front of Potter’s robes and pulling him forward. He wasn’t ready for words, not just yet, but he could make Potter understand another way. Before he could second-guess himself, Draco brought his free hand up to Potter’s neck, fingers pressing firmly against the warmth of his skin as he used the grip to bring their lips together.
Their eyes met in the mirror, the icy grey gaze softened with sleep and confusion and the vivid green frozen wide in surprise and something close to fear. His glasses were askew. For a moment, Draco wondered if Potter had been crying; his face was flushed and his cheeks looked damp. But then he noticed the wet strands of hair sticking to his forehead and decided it was much more likely that Potter had just splashed his face with water from the sink before slumping to the floor.
Potter, on the other hand, was looking resolutely down at his hands, avoiding meeting anyone’s gaze. Unfortunately for him, the stares of his classmates were all too telling.
When Slughorn finally came around to check on their progress, Draco was sticky with sweat and teary-eyed from the bitter fumes that filled the room, but he was satisfied.  Slughorn’s approving nod only served to confirm what Draco already knew: his potion was flawless. The mist on the surface was a pale silver, perfectly primed to begin the ageing process. It was far better than Blaise’s potion with its dark grey vapours, and whoever’s potion had filled the room with a strange orange fog was so far off base that Draco would have failed them on their N.E.W.T. right then and there if it were up to him.
“Of a different persuasion.” She raised her eyebrows suggestively.
Potter shook his head slightly, a small crease forming between his eyebrows. “Dead.”
“No.”
While Potter was occupied, Draco quickly rid himself of the rest of his clothes, only relaxing a little once he was submerged up to his chest in the warm, cloudy water, deep enough to cover the faded scars across his chest, the ones he hoped Potter hadn’t gotten too good of a look at. A moment later, there was a small splash as Potter slid into the water, mercifully choosing to stay towards the opposite end of the tub from Draco. Although it was quite large, more a small pool than a bathtub, the scant meters between their bare bodies still felt far too close. It was just for twenty minutes, he reminded himself, only twenty minutes to let the potion do its work and then this whole insane evening could be over.
“Ah, well.” Potter’s expression grew sheepish. “I sort of had some help that year.”
he thought with no small amount of venom.
about it or anything. “We’re behind as it is. We should get to work as soon as possible.”
“The Quidditch match?” Draco asked, a bit dumbly, because what else would Potter be talking about?
“You’re a wizard, Potter,” he said. The eaves overhead didn’t quite meet, and cold rain fell through the gap, forming a thin curtain between them, blurring Potter’s features. But even still, Draco could see the green of his eyes. “There are spells for that, you know.”
Whatever progress they might have made towards civility vanished with the sudden coldness in Draco’s voice. Potter shook his head, his expression almost disappointed as he muttered a perfunctory “Whatever, Malfoy,” and moved to leave.
Draco hadn’t known exactly what to expect the next time he saw Potter. He had assumed it would be awkward, at the very least. Maybe Potter would regret what had happened, or maybe he would expect something of Draco now, something Draco wasn’t sure he could give him. Maybe Potter would kiss him in front of everyone. Maybe they would never touch again. Maybe the memory of what had happened in the classroom would sit like fallen fruit between them, easy to ignore at first but festering grotesquely with time.
“Due to the exigent circumstances of the last year, we have had to make some adjustments to our classes,” McGonagall was explaining. “Exigent circumstances” was a nice way of putting it; they had hardly received any real education last year under the brutal tutelage of the Carrows, and the battle that destroyed the castle had also cancelled all end-of-year exams.
(See the end of the chapter for
Then again, she was hardly the worst teacher they’d had for the subject.
“You know,” Potter dipped a tentative finger in the water, then lifted it to drip a few droplets onto the inside of his wrist, right at the base of his hand. “Like how you test milk for babies after you heat it up, to see if it’s too warm?”
Potter stepped forward through the screen of rain, droplets spattering his glasses, pressing closer until they stood together under the same eave.
Right. The potion. The whole reason they were there. Definitely not the time to be thinking about Potter’s lips or his hands or any of his other highly appealing body parts. “I’m not entirely sure, to be honest.”
He waited until he felt Potter’s body relax before pulling back, letting the Gryffindor’s hand fall limply away from his face. He swallowed once, then a few more times, his throat thick with the way Potter tasted, unfamiliar but not entirely unpleasant. He wiped the back of his hand against his mouth as he stood; his knees were sore, he realized, almost as much as his jaw.
“And it was mostly an accident, anyway,” Draco added with a dismissive shrug. “You heard McGonagall—she just thought she was defending you. As if the Chosen One needs a thirteen-year-old girl to protect him.”
He was hugging his mother while she cried, telling her everything would be alright, even though he knew it was a lie; he was bringing food to the prisoners in the cellar, careful not to make a sound lest his aunt find out that he had disobeyed; he was on the marble floor of the manor beneath a merciless white hand, the agony of the Cruciatus Curse unbearable, the price of his family’s failure; he was curled up against the cold stone wall of a cell, silence all around him, no longer afraid, only empty, empty—
“I want to be here,” Potter had replied, folding his arms on the table where Draco was working and resting his chin on his forearms.
Potter blinked. From the look on his face, he still didn’t get it. “What does that have to do with…?”
“She would,” Potter insisted, either unaware or uncaring of the perilous line he was treading. “And Teddy, he’s great, you’d—”
“I didn’t say you had to make a race out of it!”
For Draco, the prospect of having his research included in one of the most prestigious academic publications in the wizarding world, of potentially having a potion of his own invention seen and evaluated and maybe even
Oddly enough, Potter grinned. “Thank Merlin for that,” he answered. What that cryptic response meant, Draco hadn’t the faintest idea. “So was that all you needed? Because I’m starving, and I don’t want to miss dinner.”
Perhaps Draco should have known then what was happening. But even after all these years, Draco still liked to pretend that he could keep a secret from Pansy if he really wanted, and so by the time he realized what she was up to, it was already too late.
been using his fork to slowly pick it apart into smaller and smaller pieces until it resembled little more than a crumbled mess. In his opinion, that counted as an entirely valid use, but it seemed Pansy thought otherwise.
Draco nodded, the contents clinking as he shifted the bag’s weight against his hip. “You got the password?”
Potter raised an eyebrow. “How do you know I want to be an Auror?”
“Yeah, alright.” He pretended to be very interested in his quill, avoiding Potter’s eyes. “That could be useful.”
As Madam Pomfrey bustled about mixing a dose of pain potion into his goblet of water, Draco studied Potter. The Gryffindor’s expression was neutral, arms held carefully behind his back as if they had never so much as reached towards Draco’s bed, but his appearance of composure was betrayed by the colour in his cheeks and the lingering heat in his eyes. Draco only tore his gaze away when Madam Pomfrey forced the goblet into his hand, watching to make sure he downed every last drop.
Draco didn’t know what to say to that, so he just pulled Potter towards him, the press of their lips marked by the lingering spice of firewhisky and the exhilaration of success. “First,” he smiled as he broke away from the kiss, Potter chasing after him, “I have to make some notes, so that we don’t forget everything and have to go back through this whole trial-and-error process all over again.” He gave Potter one last kiss before he stepped away, Potter reluctantly letting go of his waist. “Then we can celebrate.”
or anything, it was just… well, I sort of helped Cedric on the first task, and he was returning the favour, giving me a hint. The clue in the egg was actually a song, but it was in Mermish, which is why it sounded like screeching unless—”
Potter looked away. “My uncle. I lived with him and my aunt.”
Draco stared. Potter’s voice was clear and firm, leaving no room for doubt. McGonagall nodded, content with this assurance, but Draco found himself irked. How could Potter be so sure that Draco wouldn’t have attacked him? Draco had done it before, after all.
When Pansy just smiled, brushing off his silent pleas, Draco turned to Potter, hoping to convey to the Gryffindor that this was not his idea in the slightest and to please, please help them get out of this situation as soon as possible. Unfortunately, it was hard to know whether Potter actually understood anything of what he was trying to express. The Gryffindor still looked hopelessly confused by the whole situation, which was very unhelpful, albeit kind of endearing.
“I don’t think it’s so bad.”
“What the bloody hell was that?” he demanded, breathing hard.
Yet, there were moments — when their eyes met, or their fingers interlocked, or their heartbeats matched in the same rhythm — where he couldn’t help but think that they both felt it, something inexplicably
Just a note to say that I have updated the final chapter count! How I have it planned out right now, there will be two more chapters plus an epilogue.
“You don’t remember?” Pansy asked, eyebrows furrowing as she leaned forward to take his hand once more. His fingers still felt numb. “You were hexed, in the Great Hall. Remember?”
The insipid giggling faded. Weasley and Granger had definitely heard him this time.
Pansy’s gaze was fixed on something in the newspaper that he couldn’t see, her lips pressed tightly together in a way Draco knew could mean nothing good.
“Just a bit.” Pansy glanced over his shoulder, then added, “You also might want to be fully dressed before you talk to Potter.”
Several students murmured in surprise. Draco glanced over at Pansy, who wiggled her eyebrows.
Draco’s chest constricted painfully as he looked at the space where his friend’s bed should have been. The room felt wrong without it. What was the point of making the new dormitories look familiar when everyone knew that nothing was the same? It was ridiculous, really.
Pansy finally glanced up. “Oh, sorry, was that insensitive?” She arranged her features into something that might have been an attempt at looking supportive, but mostly just looked like she had smelled something foul. “What I meant to say was – wow, I’m so surprised, thank you for trusting me. I hope you know that I love you no matter what.”
Draco made a noise in his throat somewhere between a laugh and scoff. “Ah, right, when you killed it, of course." He shook his head in disbelief. How Potter could describe such wild things with such intense modesty was beyond him. Up until now, he had never really believed the stories about Potter saving the school from the monster in the Chamber of Secrets at the end of their second year. Back then it had seemed insane. A 12-year-old slaying a near-mythical monster—who would have believed that? But now, given all of Potter’s feats, him besting a Basilisk didn’t seem so implausible.
Somehow, she managed to fit one book into her bag, but when she continued to struggle with the others, Draco gave in and went to take back the remaining books from her arms.
(See the end of the chapter for
Some things had shifted, but others stayed the same. Draco continued to not tell Potter how he felt about him; they continued to keep the exact nature of their relationship secret; and they continued to struggle with the last piece of their potion. As the days ticked by, the odds of finding that key final step seemed increasingly bleak. Draco didn’t want to lose hope, but it was hard not to feel discouraged when they were so close and yet couldn’t seem to get past this one last obstacle.
“Oh, I forgot,” Potter was still grinning, “You know her pretty well, don’t you?”
a new, much gentler voice echoed in his mind.
He didn’t move, even as he felt the burn of Potter’s fingers like a brand against him. He didn’t move as Potter traced one of the long, thin lines of scar across Draco’s chest and down towards his ribs, his touch featherlight, uncertain. He didn’t move as those fingers brushed over his sternum, unable to tear his gaze away from the sight of Potter’s tan skin against the pallor of his own. As Potter followed the diagonal lines of scar tissue, Draco followed the curve of Potter’s hand, captivated by the bitten fingernails and calloused palm and heat, heat,
Draco pushed away that line of thought before he let it go any further. It didn’t matter why they broke up, and why should it? Potter’s personal life was of no concern to him.
“I’ve never gotten far enough to test it on myself before,” he lied, thinking fast. Perhaps he couldn’t test the potion in his usual way, but the Mark on his arm wasn’t the only scar he had. There was only one problem. “I guess I’ll have to now. The only thing is…” He glanced at the shallow bowl they had used to soak the piece of synthetic skin. “We’re going to need a much bigger basin.”
Potter’s chair was set close to the bed, and although he was leaned back in his seat now, Draco wondered if maybe he had propped his arms on the bed while Draco slept, or if he had even reached out to touch Draco’s hand, as Pansy did. The thought made his stomach twist. He avoided Potter’s eyes, hoping that maybe, if he forced himself to focus on something else, he could dispel the indecent images that plagued him. But staring at Potter’s hands, clasped loosely in his lap, proved to be no better—Draco could not stop picturing how the Potter of his dreams had used those wicked fingers to torment him into bliss.
“I would like to express my deepest gratitude to our sixth years in particular for their flexibility and determination. I know you all studied very hard over the summer in order to take your O.W.L. exams before the beginning of term, and I was very pleased with all of your results.”
“Mr. Malfoy, Mr. Potter, could I speak to you both for a moment?”
smell.”
Draco hadn’t expected Potter to join him. After the usual Halloween feast, one of the Gryffindors had brought out a couple bottles of firewhisky back in the common room. When Draco had slipped away, too wary of the combined weight of his classmates’ dislike and too distracted thinking about the potion to join in the revelry, Potter had been busy laughing with his friends, face flushed with alcohol. Draco hadn’t wanted to take him away from that. He had thought that he’d just work alone for a little while, test out a few more recipes until the chaos in the common room calmed.
Curious, Draco took hold of Potter’s hand and pushed it back down towards his belt, pressing Potter’s fingers against the buckle once more. But even with the encouragement, Potter’s fingers remained still, making no move to undress him.
“Unless you opened it underwater,” Draco finished, understanding.
“That sounds fine to me,” Potter said, not even attempting to conceal his satisfied grin.
“What—
He looked around. Each desk had a small pile of grey fabric on it; between the Professor’s expectant expression and Pansy’s not-so-subtle whisper, Draco was able to put it together. Charms was not his specialty, but he had a general affinity for nonverbal magic, so it couldn’t be too difficult. With a tiny nod of confirmation from Pansy, he flicked his wand through the quick series of motions necessary for multipart spell-casting, managing to assemble the wool swatches into a respectably sturdy pair of gloves.
Draco was quick to cut him off. “You should do nothing. You’ll just make things worse.” He waited for Potter to meet his eyes, emphasizing each word as he spoke, “Just leave it. It’s not a big deal. Okay?”
He forced air into his lungs, pressing his nails into the heel of his hand as he focused on the sound of Goyle’s breathing, the rustle of sheets as Blaise rolled over in his sleep. Gradually, his heart rate began to slow and his muscles relaxed. Once he felt like he could breathe again, he pushed back the covers, knowing he wouldn’t be able to get back to sleep any time soon.
“You’re no fun, you know that?” Pansy grabbed his arm, ignoring his protests as she began to pull him towards the fireplace. Draco always forgot how strong she was until moments like these, when she was dragging him somewhere against his will. “How do you ever expect to make new friends if you don’t loosen up a little?”
The key final ingredient, and it was something he had never even considered, something he never would have found without Potter.
“Will you test it on yourself, then?” Potter asked. “Is that what you’ve done before?”
He discarded the memory of the prefects’ bathroom with ease and began to sift through the images arrayed before him, skimming over their edges like the pages of book. Potter had left his thoughts entirely unguarded in his attempt to confront Draco, and it was all too simple to press deeper, past the memories that Potter had inexpertly thrust to the forefront of his mind.
Potter nodded. When Draco continued to stare at him, he added, “It sort of bit me when I killed it.”
working, if you would just wait a little longer.”
“Well… good.” Draco was quickly growing uncomfortable again under Potter’s aggressively green gaze. He reached for his book bag, searching through it briefly before pulling out a thick stack of parchment, each page filled with the neat, elegant script of his handwriting. “I’ve been working with a combination of Shrake spine and unicorn hair, for the purifying properties…”
Though he tried to suppress it, he couldn’t quite help the noise he made when Potter’s hand finally wrapped around him. He knew that the angle must be somewhat awkward with how close they were standing, but he didn’t want to put any more space between them, not even to let Potter move his wrist more freely. It didn’t matter, anyway. The motion was still good, fantastic, even. Without thinking, he found himself moving to meet Potter’s hand, chasing after his release.
“Don’t you dare go writing to her behind my back,” he warned, knowing all too well what she was considering. When Pansy didn’t answer, he continued to glare at her until she finally gave a sigh of resignation.
would reflect positively on him. It would hopefully be enough to keep St. Mungo’s from discarding his application to the Healer Training Program outright, and that’s what really mattered. Still, the unpleasant feeling lingered.
Pansy sifted through her bookbag for a moment before pulling out a rather crumpled letter. When she held it out to him, Draco could see that it was sealed with the Malfoy family crest.
Draco’s back was starting to cramp from the awkward way he had to bend over in order to see anything through the gap in the books, but he wasn’t about to move now.
“But—”
Draco was not prepared for this response. He had been expecting Potter to ask what was in it for him, to take advantage of his obvious position of power over Draco in that moment. He hadn’t expected
his bleary mind supplied, reluctantly letting go of the lingering visions of bare skin and frantic kissing from his dreams in order to focus on the two people who sat on opposite sides of his bed, paying him no attention as they quarrelled.
Or had it?  Now that he thought about it, no girl had ever made him feel like that, and it wasn’t even as if Vaisey’s inelegant kissing technique and clumsy handjob had been particularly mind-blowing. But it was only a one-off thing during one of the worst periods of his life; surely that was not the thing to judge by. And he was certain there was no way Pansy could know about that, anyway. He had been pretty convincing when he warned Vaisey what would happen if he told anyone, and he doubted that weak-willed boy would have blabbed. But why, then, would she think Draco swung the other way? Was he reading too much into this?
He attempted to grip Pansy’s hand, which was still wrapped around his own, but the petrified muscles in his side prevented him from doing anything more than twitching his fingers. Pansy smirked and pulled her hand away.

As always, thank you for all of your comments ♡ I love hearing what people think of the story so far!
, that told him he was no one, nothing — quieted, pushed far enough away that for a few hours, he could pretend he didn’t hear them at all.
As Draco fled, another thought came to him, along with a sick, hopeless coil of dismay that crowded in amongst all the other emotions tangled in his chest: the potion had not worked. After everything, they were right back where they started.
“What are you grinning about?” Draco snapped. “Even that little Hufflepuff girl thought I was going to curse you!”
Finished with the buttons, Potter let his shirt slip to the floor, and Draco had to swallow hard to keep down the odd sort of whimper that threatened to leave his throat. There was suddenly so much bare skin on display, unexpected and unasked for –
“Too scandalous for dinner in the Great Hall?” he joked, balancing the books on his hip as he started to do up the rest of the buttons.
“But you said yourself, you don’t hate him anymore,” she pointed out. “Which, by the way, when did you stop hating Potter?”
“Don’t be,” Draco murmured. “I deserved it.”
Even if their potion was selected, would it really have anything to do with his own merit? If he thought about it rationally, he supposed that it wouldn’t be the worst thing. Regardless of the politics behind it, the fact that he was accepted for publication in
That stopped Draco in his tracks. “What do you mean, you changed your mind?” They were standing quite close, Draco couldn’t help noticing, with Potter’s hand resting just above his elbow. Even through his robes, Draco could feel the warmth of his grip.
At some point, Potter’s hand came up to rest against Draco’s head, the touch so soft that Draco didn’t notice it at first. Even as Draco began to move faster, Potter’s every other breath a gasp, his fingers against Draco’s hair were gentle.
Potter’s eyebrows drew together in confusion. “How much bigger?”
Draco sat up, tearing his eyes away from the dreadful green of the canopy to stare instead at his best friend’s profile as she continued to flip through the pages of the magazine. “What does that mean?”
“He can’t tonight,” Pansy interjected, stepping forward to place a protective hand on Draco’s arm. “He still needs to eat dinner, and he promised Madam Pomfrey he’d spend the night resting.”
He glanced at Potter. The other boy was biting his lip, looking similarly uncertain.
“It’s advanced magic, Occlumency and Legilimency, but you’re by far the most advanced students I’ve ever taught.” She looked around at the eighth years, still smiling. Draco wished she would stop. “Of course, we’ll just stick to learning the theory, because any sort of practical application is, by its nature, rather invasive, and I don’t want to force anyone to give up their privacy in that way.”
“Malfoy—?”
After a cursory glance to make sure Professor Hayward’s attention was elsewhere, Draco ducked down to grab the piece of parchment still nudging itself against his shoe. He unfolded it in his lap, careful not to be too obvious about what he was doing. It was only one sentence, the messy writing familiar.
“…just thought I saw something, never mind. Where’s Hermione got to anyway?”
“I remember when I saw you that day.” Draco’s heart stuttered. “You looked...”
“Well,” Draco mused, leaning over to examine the golden taps nearest him. “Not necessarily, I suppose. If it really were just plain soap bubbles, probably not, because that’s still a neutral base. But from what I recall, most of these taps are actually charmed in some way or another, or have some sort of bath potion mixed in, and anything magical like that could mess ours up.” He traced his finger along the curved neck of one of the taps, which was decorated with a single purple jewel. It was hard to tell which ones might be enchanted, since they didn’t exactly come with clear markings. “You would think someone would have bothered to label these things better. How did you even know that one was just plain water?”
He looked up at the Gryffindor, eyes wide. “I never thought I’d say this to you Potter, but I think you might be a genius.”
Finnigan flushed red, an angry vein standing out on his neck as his jaw tightened.  “Oh yeah?” He plunged his hand into the pocket of his robes, drawing his wand. “Want to test that theory, Death Eater?”
“Please, with your obsessive need to save everyone you see, what else would you do?” Draco rolled his eyes. “Besides, it was all over the papers this summer that Kingsley Shacklebolt offered you a position in the training program. Merlin knows why you even came back here at all.”
“Mr. Potter, I should remind you, is a skilled potion-maker himself,” Slughorn added, as if reading Draco’s thoughts. “I do believe that together you could have created something great. But I will not force him into participating if he’s unwilling. I should hope you won’t either.”
“Why don’t you go spend a few weeks in Azkaban and see what it does for your appetite?” With one swift movement, he snatched the stirring rod out of Potter’s slack hand; the potion had begun to froth and was dangerously close to boiling over. “My personal habits are none of your concern,” he snarled. “And in case you haven’t noticed, you look like shit too. When was the last time you slept?”
Fortunately, Draco did not have to endure it for long. As Professor McGonagall — now Headmistress McGonagall — stood to give the customary start of term speech, Potter’s attention shifted towards the staff table.
In the few hours Draco was able to sleep, he dreamt of the fire. The burning room in which his friends screamed was a familiar setting for his nightmares, but this time he did not dream of the terror on Crabbe’s face as the flames engulfed him or the scorch of ash in his throat as he realized he was about to die. Instead, he dreamt of a hand reaching through the shimmering heat, promising Draco safety.
Potter waited until they were gone before stepping closer, his voice low. “For one thing, you never even drew your wand,” he pointed out. “But I also know you wouldn’t do anything to risk getting expelled, even if Seamus was the one who started it.”
He opened his mouth, hoping the right words would come to him, but in the end nothing did, and the door closing as Potter left was the loudest sound between them that night.
Draco didn’t look around as he heard the door to the Potions room creak open.
A large sofa and a pair of armchairs were grouped around the crackling warmth of the fire, which looked particularly inviting given the dreary rain that had been pattering against the windows all day. One of the armchairs and the far side of the sofa were currently occupied by a group of three students, all of whom appeared to be busy studying. They were angled away from Pansy and Draco, but he could see a head of bright ginger hair bowed over a book on the sofa, a bushy-haired brunette leaning back against the redhead’s legs, diligently scribbling away on a piece of parchment.
But then a miraculous thing had happened: Potter had appeared. He had defended Draco, spinning events from the previous year in such a way that Draco had almost wanted to speak up, to argue with him, because how could Draco ever deserve forgiveness? And yet that’s how Potter had made him seem — redeemable.
It was only when he was in the quiet darkness of his dormitory and halfway under the spell of sleep that Draco returned to the stairwell and Potter’s low voice, allowing himself to imagine a different ending to their conversation, one where he hadn’t stepped away.
“What?” Draco asked, unsure what to do with the unbearable softness in Potter’s gaze.
She brushed past him, reaching the door just before Potter. The dark-haired boy stepped back to let her pass, turning slightly towards Draco as he did.
They stood there like two people stupefied, caught in mutual shock and wordless understanding. Draco didn’t have to ask what Potter was doing there; on some level, he knew. But the silence was too much, and after seconds that seemed to last years, he finally dared to break it.
– trying to focus on removing his own clothes so they could get back to the real matter at hand of testing the potion.
Draco bit his lip, holding in the words ready on his tongue. Wasn’t he trying to avoid any unnecessary interaction with Potter? His usual logic said he should stay silent, but lately that logic seemed to be holding less and less sway over his decisions.
Draco nodded, somewhat chagrined, and shoved the green gloves out of sight. Though he kept his eyes averted, he imagined he could feel Potter watching him even after most of the class had turned to focus on their own piles of fabric.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco had an answer ready for this argument as well. “I’ll do most of the work.”
He jerked his hand away as if burned, water splashing between them as he concealed his arm once more. But Potter had already seen, he was sure of it. Rationally, of course, he knew that Potter was aware of his Mark. It wasn’t exactly a secret, not to him or anyone else at the school. But Draco couldn’t help the visceral shame he felt; the knowledge of how despicable it was – of how despicable
“No.” Potter’s voice was firm. Then, as if remembering that he was speaking to a professor, he quickly clarified, “Er, I mean, if it’s alright with Malfoy, I think he should use Legilimency against me. I’d prefer to defend.”
playing at?” Potter took a step forward, eyes flashing. Neither of them had lowered their wands. “You’re the one that started digging through my memories, you had no right—”
He knew avoidance wouldn’t last him long, perhaps not even a few hours more.  Still—
Potter was leaning heavily against the wall, eyes closed and cheeks flushed. As the Gryffindor tried to catch his breath, Draco found himself fixated on the details he knew he would not soon forget: the faint sheen of sweat on Potter’s neck; the curve of his bottom lip, reddened from the too-hard bite of teeth; the artful tangle of his hair, messy even on the best of days, made somehow much more beautiful by the knowledge that it was Draco’s hands that had tousled it. The images engraved themselves in his mind, etching into places both seen and unseen, promising to linger equally in his waking thoughts and his dreams.
Draco couldn’t tell if he felt more confused or exasperated. Potter had been so adamant before that he didn’t want the extra workload, that he was much too occupied with everything else in his very busy life. Why the bloody hell did he suddenly want to be involved?
“You know what?” Draco reached for his quill. “I think you might actually be right.”
But if Potter had a problem with the frequency of their meetings, he didn’t show it. He followed all of Draco’s directions without protest, and after that first meeting, he never showed up even a minute late. Their conversations were simple and mostly focused on their work – there was no hint of the suggestiveness from the stairwell, which Draco was beginning to think he had imagined altogether – but at the least their interactions no longer felt so awkward or forced.
“Pitiful?” Draco’s voice was brittle.
22 hours and 43 minutes ago – once he was back in the safety of his room, his clothes and skin damp, his heart still pounding from his desperate sprint through the halls and from the arousal still lingering in his body – a singular thought had begun to take over his mind. As the events in the prefects’ bathroom replayed in his head, over and over and over again, the thought only grew harder to ignore. His denials no longer worked; his refusals were beaten back; his wilful obliviousness had been so thoroughly shattered that there was no spell that could save it. The thought had entrenched itself, taking root in his very soul. Or maybe it had always been there, somewhere, buried beneath stiff layers of veneer.
“What do you think you’re playing at, Potter?” Draco snarled. His hands were clenched into fists, knuckles white.
Back outside the shop, Draco hesitated. They had come to Hogsmeade for the specific purpose of visiting the apothecary –
the cruel voice in the back of Draco’s mind jeered.
Yes, it had been too late, for so many things. But that had nothing to do with Potter. Draco’s expression hardened. “I don’t need a saviour,” he spat. “I didn’t need one then, either.”
“Are these seats taken?” Pansy asked, gesturing at the open end of the sofa and the empty armchair beside them.
This seemed like a particularly odd question to Draco, and he wasn’t so sure she was talking about potion-making anymore. But Potter seemed to understand her, whatever she meant. The lingering confusion had cleared from his expression, his eyes now intent as he stared back at Pansy.
have plenty to talk about anyway.”
“But nothing. Anyone who has a problem with it can come talk to me.”
Pansy plopped down next to him, kicking off her shoes and curling her feet up beneath her. “Alright, explain. And don’t leave out the details.”
Draco checked his watch. “Two more minutes, at least.”
“Poorly,” he answered honestly. “We’ve lost most of our best players.”
“I thought it should be obvious, Mr. Malfoy.” Slughorn readjusted the quill in his hand, having nearly dropped it in his surprise, and reached for a stack of parchment.
“It’s a scar-fading solution.” He turned down the flame with a tap of his wand and gestured for Potter to stop stirring. “It works best on scars resulting from non-magical injuries, but it can be effective on some kinds of magically-caused scars as well. The problem is, it can’t heal or vanish scars caused by dark magic.” He indicated the other vials on the table. “These are all similar solutions. Different formulas, same limitations.”
Potter crossed the room to where Pansy and Draco stood. “I ran into Slughorn at dinner,” he explained, bending down to pick up the books that Draco had dropped. “He told me that he finished the Mandrake draught earlier this afternoon and had just left it with Madam Pomfrey. I figured that meant you were probably being discharged about now.”
“Are you alright, Mr. Malfoy? More pain potion, perhaps?”
Draco glanced up just as Pansy snatched the fork from his hand, looking exasperated.
They leaned in at the same time, Potter balancing his hand against the wall beside Draco’s head. “Maybe I was.”
The first press of Potter’s lips was soft, still hesitant despite the boldness of the gesture. He tasted sweet, somehow, almost like treacle, and without thinking, Draco felt himself leaning forward, seeking more.
“Why should I care about that?” he asked, stomach squirming uncomfortably.
potion?”
“Er, alright, I guess.” Potter looked over at his friends somewhat helplessly as he stood, wand in hand.
“You know what I mean, don’t act like—”
“Alright, mate, whatever you say,” Weasley replied, clapping him on the shoulder. Then, with a quick glance towards Granger, he lowered his voice as he added, “But this thing with Malfoy… come off it, you really think he’s not up to anything?”
?” Pansy hissed, nose wrinkled in dislike. Her nails were digging unpleasantly into his skin.
Draco’s hands stilled. Leave it to Potter to ask the questions he least expected, and least wanted. He knew there was no good reason for him not to answer, but it was a moment before he was able to find the rights words.
Draco frowned. Granted, he had never exactly been in a real relationship before, but the idea of staying friends with someone after breaking up seemed just plain ridiculous. “How?”
“In any case, Ms. McKinnon attempted a spell well above her years,” McGonagall continued. “It was not as strong of a curse as it could have been, fortunately, but the results were also much less predictable. We believe she was attempting a kind of petrifying curse, meant to stop you from moving. However…” She looked over at Madam Pomfrey, lips pursed.
Mercifully, Pansy released him, although the look of concern on her face remained. “You’re in pain?” she fretted, taking hold of his left hand, which rested limply against the bedcovers. It was odd, Draco noticed, but he could not quite feel his fingers as she interlaced them with hers. “Should I get Madam Pomfrey?”
“Aren’t you coming?”
After passing through a short corridor, they found themselves in a spacious, warmly lit room furnished with an assortment of armchairs and two very large, plush sofas. The walls were lined with bookshelves, broken up only by a massive crackling fireplace. It was much cosier than the Slytherin common room, Draco thought, but they had obviously made an effort to not make it seem partial to any one house. The colours were mostly neutral, aside from a jumble of bright blue, green, red, and yellow pillows piled on the sofa and a large flag emblazoned with the Hogwarts crest that hung over the mantel.
Draco sat back on his bed, spreading his hands against the green silk of his duvet. Someone—Blaise, probably—had changed everything back to its original colour. “We just talked,” he answered. “I… sort of needed his help with something.”
Draco swallowed hard, determined to keep his voice steady. “I understand, sir.” He turned away. “Thank you for trying.”
“You’ll need Potions if you want to be an Auror.”
Draco took a deep breath before he spoke. “It’s not a problem,” he said, as much to reassure himself as to convince Potter. “We’ll just try soaking it in the potion instead. That should work.”
“So what is this?” Potter asked, dark hair falling across his forehead as he leaned over the cauldron to examine the potion he was stirring.
“What are you talking about?” Blaise put a hand over his heart in mock outrage. “I loved that guy! Remember all those lovely letters he used to send?” Blaise adopted a simpering voice. “’Oh Pansy, my dearest, I simply cannot wait another minute until we are together! I long for the day I can take your precious and definitely-still-intact virginity!’”
“Keep stirring,” he instructed, heading towards the supply cupboard. He wasn’t sure what he was looking for, exactly, but it gave him an excuse to escape Potter’s scrutiny, if only for a minute.
“Come now, Weasel, that’s not very nice. Aren’t we all such good friends now, living together like one House?” he sneered. “Green is just such a
my girlfriend.” He shuddered at the thought. They had shared a brief flirtation when they were younger, sure, but that had mostly been a product of convenience and their family’s expectations rather than out of any real romantic interest. Nowadays, Draco thought of Pansy more like a sister.
Abruptly, Draco stood.
“Pericles likes me better than you.”
Draco scowled. “I seriously considered it.”
Potter was watching him very closely. “Why?”
“I don’t want you to apologize.”
Fortunately, Blaise wasn’t the interrogative type, and neither Pansy nor Goyle had continued on to N.E.W.T.-level Potions, which meant Draco was saved from any further prying about his desperate sprint to class.
we’re supposed to practice before next class! How were you expecting to do that without any notes?”
Draco sucked in a sharp breath. The stairwell seemed much smaller all of a sudden, and much warmer. They were still standing just a hair too close, and maybe he was going mad but Draco was pretty sure Potter wasn’t talking about Pansy. The thought gave him a thrill that was somewhere between excitement and panic. His thoughts were beginning to race too fast for him to control, and his heightened awareness of their proximity—
him. He quickly looked away, hoping in vain that Potter wouldn’t see the incriminating heat rising on his cheeks.
Draco swallowed hard, his voice faltering. “Why?”
“It smells like vinegar and wet leaves.”
He was almost finished scribbling down the details of the Mandrake root’s effects when Potter spoke up.
“What qualities does your new House value, Malfoy?” Weasley goaded. “Being a prat?”
With one last dirty look, Finnigan turned back to his friends, all of whom were watching Draco with wide eyes. Draco could feel Potter’s gaze on him too, but as soon as Finnigan moved away, Draco turned his back. If Potter thought Draco was going to thank him for his intervention, he had another thing coming. Although Potter might have prevented a fight, Draco wasn’t so sure that this outcome was any better. Aside from the fact that he detested being the object of Potter’s ridiculous saviour complex, the last thing he needed was to have more attention on him, and Potter was doing nothing to help the gossip.
In truth, Draco didn’t know; that bit of domestic knowledge was entirely new to him, having never spent much time around young children if he could avoid it. He was generally of the opinion that babies were much too loud and dirty and needy to be anything more than a nuisance. He had never taken Potter for the kind of person who loved babies, either, but he wasn’t certain why the revelation surprised him so much. It wasn’t as if he kept a catalogue of all of Potter’s interests or anything.
“Still?” Draco reached for the letter Pansy had tossed aside onto a plate of bacon, quickly scanning its contents. “Merlin’s balls, you would think she’d have run out of options by now. How many eligible pureblood bachelors in Britain can there be?”
Draco swatted Potter’s hand away from the piece of synthetic skin that rested on the table between them, although he could understand the Gryffindor’s impatience. After Potter had vanished the remnants of the potion that had spilled over Draco’s legs last week, they’d had to start from scratch, and replicating the exact mishap that had somehow led to a moment of success turned out to be much more complex than either of them anticipated. It had taken them nearly three days of work to find the right timing and temperature, and finally,
Potter stood suddenly, the chair scraping against the floor as it was shoved back.
’s first edition of the new year. However, Slughorn had requested that they show him an initial version of their potion towards the beginning of November, so that he could review their work and make suggestions for improvement, if necessary. With Halloween already fast approaching, their days were quickly running out.
“I thought you two might be interested in submitting. It’s fairly competitive, I’ll tell you now, but you’re two of the brightest Potions students Hogwarts has, and I think you have a good chance.”
The voices were quite annoying. How dare they interrupt him when he was so pleasantly occupied? Slowly, Draco blinked his eyes open, struggling in his drowsy state to try and make sense of his surroundings. The long, high-ceilinged room was lined with narrow beds dressed in clean white sheets, all of which were empty except for the one Draco currently occupied. Even with the late afternoon sunlight streaming through the windows, the place had a cold, sterile feeling about it.
Through the fog of sleep, the sharp, incongruous voice cut across Draco’s fantasy like a knife.
“I just know how you can be a bit…” Weasley hesitated.  “Well, y’know… obsessive, when it comes to Malfoy.”
Draco brought his right hand up to examine the aching area of his ribcage, ignoring the pain as he pressed his fingers gingerly along his side. Even through the stiffness of the bandages, he could tell that the skin underneath was hard as stone. At least this explained the numbness in his left arm—the muscles all the way up to his shoulder were completely paralyzed.
The word—so unfamiliar on Draco’s tongue—fell between them with an unnatural weight. Potter’s eyes went wide, mouth hanging open in a comical expression of disbelief.
But of course, he wasn’t so lucky.
If Draco hadn’t known better, he could’ve sworn Potter was even enjoying himself. He’d catch the Gryffindor smiling sometimes as he chopped up ginger root or measured out nettles or whatever else Draco had instructed him to do that day. And Draco had been very motivated to keep him busy, because every moment that Potter’s hands were free—and even sometimes when he probably should have been paying attention to the toxic ingredient or sharp knife he was holding—he occupied himself with watching Draco.
“No,” he said, turning back to Pansy in sudden understanding. “No, whatever you’re thinking right now, just stop. We are not going over there, not a chance.”
Though it was still mad enough to warrant a less blasé attitude, Draco thought.
The door cracked open before the word had even faded from Potter’s lips. Draco followed the Gryffindor in, clutching his bag close to his side to keep from jostling it too much.
“Fine,” Finnigan muttered, glaring at Draco with barely stifled rage. “Fine.”
The corridor was quiet, most students still in class. He wasn’t surprised by the sound of footsteps behind, nor did he need to turn to know who it was. He was surprised, though, by the hand on his arm, the touch far too gentle.
“So…” Potter’s voice caught up to Draco on the stairs. Resigned, Draco slowed his pace, but didn’t stop. “What ideas do you have, for the potion?”
Draco frowned, immediately searching out Potter’s dark head a row over, unsurprised to find a pair of green eyes already watching him. Perhaps it was just habit, too many years of antagonism conditioning him, or perhaps it was some other self-defence instinct that drove him, but Draco didn’t hesitate before crumpling the note in his fist, scowling at Potter before he looked away.
“Gods, no. But my mother cares about bloodlines, not fidelity.” Pansy resumed her place on the floor, flipping back through the pages of Witch Weekly to find where she had left off. “I’ll have a semi-regular fling with some gorgeous half-blood who looks just enough like you that my mum won’t question why our children don’t have the Malfoy eyes, and you can have an affair with a fit Quidditch player. Everybody wins.”
“Are you…?” Potter began, then seemed to think better of it and changed course. “Does this happen a lot?”
“Yeah, from Ginny.” Potter turned to face the nondescript door to his left, addressing it as he said, “
good friends now.”
Potter shifted in his seat. “I don’t have a problem with it, exactly. I would just, ah, rather not test it on myself, is all.”
Draco huffed. “That wasn’t what I meant.”
He made a point of meeting Potter’s steady gaze. Potter didn’t flinch, but Draco knew he got the message.
The way she said it, like she was implying something else, made Draco squirm. But there was no way she could know. Was there?
“Well, it should,” Draco muttered as he slit open the wax seal and scanned his mother’s letter. He knew he probably should have written to her sooner to tell her about the potions competition, and about working with Potter, but he had hardly expected it to make the papers. And then, well…
the small, bitter voice in the back of his mind whispered,
Potter raised an eyebrow. “Isn’t this what you wanted?” Draco’s eyes widened, already stammering a denial. “Weren’t you complaining about being the only one that had to undress?”
“But you said yourself, you don’t hate him anymore,” Pansy pointed out. “Which, by the way, when did you stop hating Potter?”
“Let me just buy this and we can get out of here,” Draco said. “Save your poor delicate nose from the
Draco’s fingers tightened against the desk. “We don’t have to talk about it.”
hexing him, for all he knew. That, at least, would make sense — much more sense than Potter smiling at him, or wanting to help him, or telling him that his ideas were amazing. Whatever game Potter was playing, it was messing with Draco’s head, and he didn't know how much more he could take.
Realizing that Draco hadn’t pushed him away, Potter became more assured, lips pressing against Draco more firmly. His free hand came up to cradle the back of Draco’s neck, the gentle touch enough to make Draco shiver, even despite the heat. As he returned the kiss with more fervor, Draco’s mind grew curiously blank, filled with nothing except the overwhelming taste of all the things he had for too long pretended he didn’t crave.
“Of course.” He blinked. The canopy above him seemed different, somehow, although he couldn’t quite put his finger on what it was. The fabric was still the same, the colour unchanged, and yet… “I know you like to think you’re so mysterious, but it hardly takes a genius to know your type.”
Draco felt a flash of panic. This was a completely different scenario than he had imagined when he stormed across the Great Hall, intent on confronting Potter. In that moment, he had felt like the one in control. But now, lying prone in a hospital bed after Potter had come to his aid in front of half the school like the storybook hero everyone imagined him to be, Draco felt wholly unprepared.
The next day, when Potter refused to meet his eyes, Draco focused on his hands. Did Potter dream about the fire too? Or was it something else, something much worse, that left him huddled cold and alone on the bathroom floor?
And yet…
“I am aware that we brewed it in sixth year,” Draco replied, trying not to gape. “But I was
The heat of the bath felt suffocating. Or maybe it was the heat inside him, pressing against his lungs to the point of pain. He could see the movement of Potter’s throat as he swallowed, and the way his eyelashes fluttered as he leaned in. He was so close now, close enough to see every detail, even through the steam rising off the water in a shimmering haze, clouding the room, clouding their judgement. Everything around them was misted shades of marble and gilt, the water soaking them in tones of crumbling ash, but the colour that Potter kissed him was entirely green.
“You don’t know what I want.”
“You’re late.”
Unless it wasn’t a game. Maybe Potter was just trying to move forward, and Draco was the one clinging to the past. Maybe it was okay for things with Potter to change; everything else in his life had, so why not this? He could be friends with Potter, if that’s what the other wanted, or at the very least he could try and be less of an ass. He’d done much more difficult things than that in his life, so why did it seem like such a challenge? What was he so afraid of?
Potter looked up at him, startled, then glanced down at where Draco’s fingers encircled his wrist. Draco quickly let go, bothered by the slight contact, even though less than a week ago he’d been touching Potter in far less innocent places.
Draco could not help feeling that maybe he had been tricked, but Pansy was now reaching for her copy of the

Potter smiled. “Yeah, that sounds great.”
Halfway out the door, Potter stopped to glance back over his shoulder.
“He, er, may have intimated that I shouldn’t bother you about it any more.”
of your scars.” Despite everything, Draco still managed a hint of a sneer.
“I tried to tell you earlier,” Blaise said with a small shrug, his eyes sparkling with amusement.
“I’m quite sure, Harry,” Slughorn replied with a fond smile. “I think the two of you should work together. The theme this year is ‘recovery and reconstruction.’ The idea is to invent your own potion — something related to the theme, however you want to interpret it — and then you will submit a sample accompanied by a written explanation of the process and its effects and interactions and so forth,” he explained, one hand gesturing in time with his words as he spoke. “So, what do you think?”
“I, um—” Potter cleared his throat. Draco followed the movement of his Adam’s apple as he swallowed with an unusual fascination. “Yeah, I’ll do it. Okay.”
He did, but Draco wasn’t sure what exactly Potter was after.  “Yes,” he answered honestly. “Not as much after the first week. But I expect it will pick up again, now that everyone thinks I’ve coerced their Saviour into joining a potions competition against his will.”
Sorry if it feels like not a lot happens in this chapter, the next scene was originally going to be a part of this chapter but I haven't finished it yet and I wanted to post an update just so everyone would know the story hasn't been abandoned or anything. I figured short was better than nothing!
Potter said nothing, only leaned forward slightly, hands pressing into the sheets. He was close enough now that Draco could smell the warm, woodsy scent of his cologne, and he realized that it would be all too simple, if he wanted, to push himself up, just a little bit, and meet Potter’s lips with his own.
Everything about Potter was gentle as he pulled away, from the way his eyes traced the lines of Draco’s face to the small smile that curled his lips.
Eventually, they ended up at Honeydukes, toffee-scented warmth enveloping them as they escaped the cold wind outside. Rather than looking at the sweets, Draco chose to watch Potter browse, unexpectedly endeared by the simple, innocent joy in the Gryffindor’s eyes as he gazed at the colourful jars of Jelly Slugs and Fizzing Whizzbees, seeming much younger than Draco was used to.
“That’s fine.” He doodled absently on the parchment in front of him, his hands moving without thinking. His mind had latched unhelpfully onto the word
saying that we can’t go sit over there right now.”
“Potter.” He looked over at the dark-haired boy, whose brow was furrowed as he stared down at Draco’s leg. “You are the luckiest fucking idiot I have ever met.”
“Yeah, sure.” Potter smiled, leaning forward to rest his elbows on the table. “So, with these potions – you want to try and make a better one, that can actually heal scars from dark magic?”
, they had something to show for it.
There, across from the sinks, sat a figure, hunched with his back against the wall and arms wrapped tightly around his knees. The dark, messy hair was unmistakably Potter’s, and yet Draco could hardly believe that was who he was seeing. The man in the reflection – curled into himself like he wanted nothing more than to disappear – looked almost like a child.
“I thought you two broke up.” The nonchalance of the statement was poorly feigned.
There was a moment of silence, Draco lost in thoughts of ingredient combinations. Then—
Slowly, Potter seemed to pull himself together. He loosened the tight clasp of his hands around his knees and pushed himself up from the floor, straightening his glasses as he stood. Draco had been watching him in the mirror the whole while, eyes fixed on Potter’s reflection, but as Potter turned, he raised his gaze to meet Draco’s head-on. There was something defiant in his expression, as if daring Draco to mock him. But for the first time, Draco saw the fragility behind those green eyes, and all he really wanted to do was reach out to the other boy, to touch him or hold him or just let him know that he understood what it was like to wake up at night from the horror of the nightmares only to face the even worse reality of the memories.
“I suppose…”
Potter still looked conflicted, but he nodded. “If you say so.”
Draco stayed in the Charms classroom long after Potter had left, sitting on a desk and staring off into space as he went over their last exchange in his mind again and again. After everything that had happened between them, he never would have believed that he and Potter could have such a benign interaction, let alone one where Potter smiled at him with such unambiguous sincerity. And he definitely never would have believed he would feel so flustered about it.
“Don’t get too worked up about it, you know how the
“Which dream was it this time?” Granger’s voice was gentle, but Draco wanted to hex her; he certainly would have if any of his friends dared ask him that question. Didn’t she know it was better to never bring it up, to never even think about the nightmares beyond those few minutes when you first woke up and couldn’t remember what was real and what was not?
He was in the prefects’ bathroom, steam thick in the air as he moved through the murky water. He was tracing his fingers along pale lines of scar. He was leaning in—
“Potter?”
Potter raised an eyebrow at him. It was rare for Draco to curse more than once in a whole conversation, let alone in one sentence. Maybe—just maybe—he was getting a bit too worked up.
Draco’s fingers tightened reflexively around his wand. “They don’t allow prisoners to use magic.” His mouth felt very dry. “How did you convince them?”
“Not bad, not bad!” Finnigan appraised, already making himself at home on the sofa. As other students moved forward to explore the room, Draco stayed back, hands shoved deep in his pockets.
Pansy and Potter both nodded, looking appropriately chagrined, but Madam Pomfrey was now too busy muttering a series of spells over Draco’s bandaged ribs to notice. At first, the pain seemed to worsen as a powerful burning sensation spread up to his shoulder and down his arm, and Draco had to bite his tongue to keep from crying out. But after a few moments, the pain began to dull, replaced by a mild prickling sensation. Madam Pomfrey stepped back, her lips thin.
“Yes,” he replied. “Sometimes. When I was younger, I wanted to be a professional Quidditch player. I loved competing. But now…” He shrugged. “I don’t know. I’m not sure it would be the same. I still fly, though. I don’t think I could ever stop flying.”
“What is it, Pans?” he repeated, dread beginning to coil in his stomach. They had caught Blaise and Goyle’s attention now, but as Goyle leaned over to see what Pansy was reading, she quickly tried to shove the paper out of sight.
Draco realized; it was pity in his face that Draco had seen earlier.
fault, how dare I—”
Gripping Potter’s hips, Draco reversed their positions with one quick motion, pressing Potter’s back against the wall. He was unsure about so many things in his life, about who he was and about what his future held. Doubt was a constant companion for him.
— he had barely taken two steps before he was met with Weasley’s belligerent glare. Not keen on picking a fight and being late to class for a second time that day, Draco let them go.
The mattress dipped under Pansy’s weight, her arm coming to wrap around him as she curled into his side.
“What are you doing?” Draco grumbled, having nearly stumbled into her when she abruptly came to a stop in front of him. “Aren’t we going to the library?”
Draco held out one of the glass bottles that he had taken from the supply cupboard, waiting until Potter took it.
Potter stepped forward, jaw set. “We have to talk about something.”
work. But at that point, it would be so prohibitively impractical that what even would be the point?”
Draco slung his bookbag over his shoulder and grabbed the three volumes he hadn’t managed to fit in with the others, thrusting them into Pansy’s surprised hands.
“No,” Potter shook his head. “It would mess up the potion, wouldn’t it?”
you to marry any of these imbeciles,” Draco soothed.
Draco glanced briefly over the side of the bed. “A fit Quidditch player, huh?”
“The Headmistress is right,” Madam Pomfrey agreed, shooting pointed looks at the two students sitting on either side of Draco’s bed. “Rest is the best medicine. I will give you all another few minutes, but then Mr. Malfoy needs his sleep.”
“I’m sorry.” Potter’s fingers pressed softly against his chest, and the scars he had left patterned there. It felt like a lifetime ago that they were in that bathroom, so different than the one they were in now. A lifetime ago that he was the boy full of rage and fear, bleeding on the floor.
“No,” Draco answered automatically, forcing his expression into a practiced neutrality. “No, everything’s fine.”
Draco looked up in surprise. The question was a little bit rushed, the words tripping all over themselves, and Draco was intrigued to find that the Gryffindor suddenly looked quite nervous.
“As if.” Pansy brushed his comment off with a wave of her hand. “Anyone with even a passing attraction to women is interested in me. Anyone with taste, at least.”
“It’s nothing, don’t worry about it,” she answered, not meeting Draco’s eyes.
“You weren’t here last year, and I’m not sure how much you know, but things were… pretty bad.” He stared at the scrawl of his own handwriting with unseeing eyes. He could feel Potter watching him, but he didn’t look up. “I don’t think she deserved any punishment, not if she had to live through that already.”
“Basilisk,” Potter answered simply, as if it were the most normal thing in the world to have been bitten by one of the world’s rarest and most deadly creatures.
The logic seemed straightforward enough, but another twenty minutes and three applications later, the skin still remained resolutely scarred.
He glanced over his shoulder, wondering if Potter had grown bored of this yet. They had both gravitated slowly towards the back of the shop and were now much closer than Draco had expected, only a couple of the larger barrels of ingredients between them. Potter was staring curiously down into one of the containers, hand on the rim of it, his fingers only centimetres away from the greenish, fungus-like contents.
“Well, I think I might have some answers for you. First of all, you should know what we have identified the person who attacked you—it was a third year Hufflepuff, named Miranda McKinnon. Do you know her?”
“Oh, erm,” Potter said, tightening his clutch around the bottle for a moment before hesitantly offering it to Draco. “Murtlap tentacles. I don’t know if it’ll work, I just saw it and thought, I dunno, it might do something.”
“Oh.” The shift in Potter’s demeanour was palpable, all the tension fading from his posture with that one syllable, the airy sound of it both surprised and relieved. “Okay. Great. How about this weekend, then?”
They just had to wait a little bit longer.
Draco could feel that both Pansy and Potter were staring at him, but he did not look away from the Headmistress.
“It’s the most prestigious potions publication in all of Europe.” It was a silly question, Draco thought. But then again, Potter had been raised by Muggles, and he’d clearly never had much interest in any kind of academic achievement. Perhaps he simply didn’t understand. “You should consider it an honour to even be offered the chance. I, for one, don’t want to waste it.”
Draco leaned back, staring up at the bed’s canopy. A moment later, he felt Pansy lay down beside him so that they were shoulder to shoulder. It was the same familiar position in which they had spent countless hours in his old Slytherin dormitory, sometimes laughing and sharing secrets and sometimes, when everything seemed too awful for words, just laying there in silence.
“What does he
– and he couldn’t help the way his eyes mapped the lines of Potter’s shoulders and chest, the muscles toned by Quidditch, the narrow lines of his waist, the way he looked healthy and strong and achingly
Draco fell back onto his four-poster, weighed down with the memories he had tried so hard to shut away. He could still see the courtroom in his mind, with its dark stone walls and looming benches. He could feel the chill, both the physical cold and the icy wave of hatred emanating from every person in the room as they looked down on him, sneering at the proud Malfoy family brought so low.
“Draco.” Pansy’s voice was suddenly very close to his ear, her fuchsia nails pressing into his wrist. “Potter is
“Oh, I almost forgot…”
Draco snorted, folding his jumper with precise movements, pressing firmly to smooth the creases. “I doubt that.”
fine that he could sense the defensiveness in his tone.
“Get some rest, Mr. Malfoy,” McGonagall advised. “I will inform your Professors of your absence for the next few days.” With a nod towards Pansy and Potter, McGonagall took her leave.
They were sitting cross-legged on the floor of the potions room with the cauldron set up between them, which was Potter’s idea of taking it easy. Draco had never expected him to take Pansy’s directive so seriously, but Potter had been adamant. The suggestion had seemed silly, at first—how was sitting on the floor really that different from sitting at the table? But Potter had argued that when they worked at the table, Draco never actually sat still; he always ended up on his feet after a few minutes, pacing up and down the room every time he got frustrated, which was often.
Draco made a noise of disgust. The beloved Saviour was red in the face and ducking his head, but Draco knew he was lapping it up. Potter thrived on being the centre of attention.
“Pans?”
“Isn’t it obvious?” More fabric was tossed aside, although Draco didn’t dare look around to see what it was. “I’m joining you. It’s only fair, right?”
“It’s fine,” he said with a small smile before turning his attention back to Pansy. “Ron’s not wrong, actually. I’m sure this won’t come as a big surprise, but I really struggled with Potions when Snape was teaching it. I was so miserable in that class that I was just determined to always hate it. But I guess that meant I never really gave it a fair chance as a subject.” He shrugged. “Things are different now, though. There’s no reason to keep hating it anymore.”
by the brightest minds in potion-making was impossible to resist. Even if it meant having to put up with Potter as a partner, he could not let this chance slip through his fingers. But would Potter feel the same?
“Well, Snape croaked, for one thing,” Weasley muttered before Potter could answer, earning him a sharp jab in the shin from Granger. “What? It’s true!”
—suddenly threatened to overwhelm him. He swallowed and stepped back, holding the stair railing to keep himself steady, and mustered an approximation of a sneer.
had just broadcast to the world that the Chosen One was spending his time with a known Death Eater and Draco had half expected Potter to say he wanted to put as much distance as possible between them from now on, or at the very least to mock him for his humiliating mistake. Draco could not even begin to comprehend why Potter had continued to visit him in the Hospital Wing; his only possible explanation was that maybe Potter wanted to tell him off to his face and was just waiting for the right moment to do it.
For the second time that evening, Draco found himself asking, voice slightly choked, “What are you doing, Potter?”
“Maybe I am.”
Unfortunately, that feeling hadn’t lasted long. The snide remarks he had ignored on the train began to multiply somewhere around the Great Hall, becoming louder and more conspicuous by the minute. He couldn’t decide what was worse: the blatant shouts from the other tables or the bitter whispers from his fellow Slytherins. Hated by some for his allegiance in the war, despised by others for not being loyal enough, and always, always criticized for his lenient sentencing — there was no direction to turn that didn’t meet with hostility and loathing. It was enough to turn anyone off their food, really.
Briefly, he worried that it was going to be all too obvious that this was his first time. He wasn’t sure if he was doing it right, and he didn’t know if Potter would tell him if he wasn’t. It had seemed intuitive enough, the way to move, the pressure to use, but it wasn’t quite as simple as he might’ve hoped. He tried to pace himself, but it was hard to remember to continue to breathe, harder still to try not to choke.
Potter stepped forward, jaw set. “We have to talk about something.”
Draco extracted himself from her too-tight grip, not bothering to answer what he could only assume was a rhetorical question. How in Merlin’s name was he supposed to know what Potter wanted?
Potter frowned and looked away. “Like I said this morning, I’m not really interested, Malfoy. I don’t even like Potions.”
He broke away from the kiss, breathing heavily as he raised his hand to press against Potter’s chest, intent on forestelling him from coming any nearer. Potter’s eyes blinked open slowly, somewhat dazed. His expression morphed into one of confusion as he glanced down at Draco’s hand against him, holding him back. Draco followed his glance, heat curling low in his stomach at the look and feel of Potter’s wet, flushed skin under his touch, quickly followed by an icy stab of horror as he realized that, in his distraction, he’d lifted his left hand, blatantly baring the dark brand on the inside of his forearm.
He fell back against his pillows, huffing. “No.” The green of the canopy had not gotten any less vibrant in the last five minutes, but it did look a shade less hostile. “But you could stand to be a bit more supportive.”
“I couldn’t get him to leave,” Pansy explained, shooting Potter a harassed look. Potter opened his mouth as if to respond, but no sound came out, and a moment later he closed it, never taking his eyes off of Draco.
He glanced over at Potter. The Gryffindor was watching him, eyebrows furrowed ever so slightly, looking at Draco with the same expression he always wore when he asked a question like this – something personal, something that instinctively made Draco want to hide or to lie for fear of being seen, understood,
“You have been assigned dormitories with your same housemates, but you all will have a shared common space, which I will show you to now.”
All of that disgusting honesty, and Potter was still going to say no. The prat couldn’t even bother to make up a reason.
He shrugged, his whole demeanour uncertain, like he was waiting for Draco to tell him it was a stupid idea and there was no way it would be helpful. Except it wasn’t a stupid idea, not at all. In fact, it was such a good idea that Draco was in the midst of a small internal crisis, trying to decide it was acceptable to kiss Potter square on the mouth right there in the middle of the shop.
The first time that Draco had looked in a mirror after the battle at Hogwarts had been the day of his trial. He’d returned to the family manor that same night upon his conditional release, exchanging Azkaban for three months of house arrest. Though he had stood in the same bathroom that he’d used since childhood, everything had felt alien to him, from the white marble floors to the serpentine taps of the sink to the gaunt white face reflected in the mirror. Draco remembered looking at that skeletal stranger with the dirty, overgrown hair and the flat grey eyes and wondering how much farther he could whittle himself down before the skin cracked and revealed that he had been hollow all along.
There was no one else in the shop to overhear them, not even the owner, who Draco assumed must be somewhere in the back room. Still, something about the weighted silence of the place made him want to whisper.
Potter flushed red. Draco’s sneer turned into a derisive laugh.
Draco’s eyes narrowed. They never worked in the common room; it was much too loud, for one thing, not to mention that it was almost always occupied by a minimum of two people who hated them, and who didn’t mind reminding them of that fact.
Draco looked down. The familiar lines of the scars were already permanently altered, the pattern broken where the potion had mended the beginning of one of the marks. He remembered thinking, back in his sixth year after the wounds had healed, that he would have those scars forever.
Draco flushed, his fingers clumsy as he quickly tried to do up the rest of the buttons.
“Careful.” Draco stepped around the barrels separating them, gently taking hold of Potter’s wrist and pulling his hand back. “Even dead, Bundimun secretions can be quite dangerous.”
“Oi, mate, I think Potter’s coming over to talk to you.” Draco barely felt Blaise’s nudge against his shoulder. He had already looked up, eyes finding Potter’s in an instant. The Gryffindor was still halfway across the Great Hall, but there was no mistaking where his intent gaze was fixed. Draco’s stomach swooped, the part of him that still burned with remembered touches wanting nothing more than to see Potter, to speak to him, to be close to him again.
He applied it to only a small section of one of the scars, just where it began up near his collarbone. The potion burned as it touched his skin, dark tendrils of smoke curling away from his body like the smouldering remnants of a fire. The smoke was darker
“What exactly do you think our alternative is?” he asked slowly, as if he were speaking to a child. “We’re trying to fix scars from
Potter blinked, shaking his head as if to clear his thoughts. “No... no it wasn't that.” He smiled then, laughing a bit. “It was because of Moaning Myrtle, actually. That time I came here in fourth year, she, uh, decided to join me. Didn’t seem to understand why I might not want her there.”
“Then why do you look so upset?”
“Alright.” Draco looked away, pretending to write down another note on the potion just to have something to do, anything to keep himself from dwelling too long on the grief he had seen in Potter’s eyes. “We’ll make do, I suppose.”
Draco was not in the habit of angering professors, or of losing his House points. If nothing else, he had always been a good student, never the kind to cause such a disruption in class. If he were still fourteen years old, if he were still proud and studious and desperately seeking approval, if he were standing in front of a different person, someone with tidier hair or duller eyes or less history tangled between them, Draco might have been able to do it. He might have been able to grit out an apology and seethe in silence at the back of the room for the remainder of the lesson, his fury quietly contained.
Slughorn looked thrilled. “Wonderful!” He clapped his hands together. “And you, Harry, what do you say?”
of our returning students will be treated most graciously.”
Draco nodded, sensing where this was headed. The anxiety twisting in his stomach eased, replaced by a cautious feeling of hope.
This announcement was met with a chorus of triumphant shouts from the sixth years and a smattering of general applause across the room. McGonagall’s soft smile as she looked out at the students over her spectacles reminded Draco forcibly of Dumbledore, and he found he had to clench his hands together in his lap to keep them from shaking.
The whole reason he had asked for Potter’s help in the first place had been to balance out the weight of his own name, but he had been so focused on the possibility of their entry being discounted even with Potter as his partner that he hadn’t stopped to consider the opposite, that their entry in the competition might be unduly favoured because of who Potter was.
“Well, we shall see on Wednesday! Off you get to lunch then!”
He dropped his gaze back to his plate, studying his toast, half-eaten and unappealing.
Potter shrugged, rubbing at the back of his neck. It wasn’t a bad idea, far from it. Draco had been running low on inspiration for a while now, feeling like he was scraping the bottom of the barrel mentally to come up with ways to make this potion work. Maybe a visit to the apothecary was exactly what he needed to stimulate a new stroke of brilliance.
“What are you doing?” The rain was loud, thunder rumbling somewhere in the distance, but they were standing so close that Draco hardly had to raise his voice to be heard.
Okay I know it's been ACTUAL ages since I've updated and I am deeply sorry for that, I was dealing with some health things and then the pandemic happened and long story short I've had to prioritize some other things in my life for a while. But this story lives in my head all the time, it is planned out and I have no intention of leaving it unfinished!
He knew if he looked at Potter then, it would be too obvious how much he really meant it. If they were alone, maybe he would have let their eyes meet, would have allowed Potter to see the truth there, the vulnerability. But for now, he just watched Potter out of the corner of his eye, catching only a flash of the small, pleased smile that flickered across his lips.
“Anyway, I do have one theory, I’m just not sure how helpful it is.” He sifted through the pile of notes spread out on the table between them, searching for the most recent draft of their potion formula, the one they had tested in the prefects’ bathroom to unsatisfactory results. “I think maybe, with enough time and repeated use, our current potion
Slughorn beamed when they handed him a small, stoppered bottle of their potion a few days later, the gold buttons of his waistcoat straining as he puffed out his chest, proud and exuberant.
“What do I look like, a house elf?” she demanded, arms wobbling under the weight of the texts. One of the drawbacks of Draco’s penchant for advanced potions theory was that the books tended to be on the heavier side.
“I changed my mind.”
“Are you sure this is safe?” Potter twisted the tap until the water stopped flowing, frowning at the murky surface below.
Surely Potter, more than anyone, knew the burden that a scar could be; surely he must understand the weight of being forever marked with a relic of misfortune and suffering, the pain of being permanently branded with a reminder of the past. What kind of person wouldn’t want to be free of that?
That was the question, wasn’t it? What did he want? To just pretend nothing had ever happened, to act as if nothing had changed? It was the easier choice, certainly. Enmity was something Draco understood, the texture of it well-worn and familiar. Anger and hate, those were things he knew. Leaving that behind was like shedding his skin. He feared that without it, he would be too raw, and more than that, that he would be unrecognizable. But then again, maybe the person he recognized was no longer the person he wanted to be.
“Er.” Weasley and Granger both looked over at Potter, who was still busy staring at Draco, a silent question in his eyes that Draco knew he wouldn’t be able to answer in front of their friends. When Potter gave no response, Granger turned back to Pansy and Draco. Draco hoped wildly that one of them would just say no, the seats were actually taken, and there was no way they could possibly sit there.
Contrary to what Draco had always believed, it turned out that Potter was not a total disaster when it came to Potions. In fact, although Draco would never say it to his face, he was actually pretty useful to have around. With Potter helping prepare ingredients and taking notes, testing out formulas was much more efficient than when Draco worked alone. Even though Draco could have easily written up a very basic project proposal to submit, Slughorn had given them a whole week before they needed to let him know what they planned to do, and in that time, Draco was determined to have some preliminary results to show. With Potter’s name on the project, Draco wasn’t too worried about being outright barred from entering the contest, but just to be safe he wanted to make sure their project looked promising.
He could see that Potter wanted to say more, saw the way his lips parted to argue, but something seemed to make him pause. It took Draco a minute to realize that Potter’s eyes were fixed on his fingers, poised to undo the buttons of his shirt. Draco had undressed without hesitation until then, distracted by their conversation. But now, the nerves from earlier returned tenfold, prickling along his skin and focusing at his throat, where Potter’s eyes were glued and where his own fingers were now fumbling, as if they had suddenly forgotten how buttons worked.
Desperate for something to latch onto, he thought of Halloween night. Potter showing up, face reddened with alcohol. Adding the Murtlap tentacles to the potion and watching it change colour. The scars on his chest fading, disappearing beneath wisps of grey smoke. Laughing with his arms around Potter.
Although the question was directed at them both, Draco knew both Slughorn and Potter were looking to him for an answer. “Yes, Professor, that shouldn’t be a problem,” Draco replied. “I have some ideas already.”
Draco is the king of being in denial but things will pick up soon, I promise.
— was ever present in Draco’s mind, the very thought of it enough to make his heart race. Draco had yet to respond in kind, and it didn’t seem like Potter expected him to, which Draco was grateful for. Most of the time, he wasn’t sure what he felt, or if he was even allowed to feel those things. Did he like Potter? It was a strange thought. Not as shocking as it once would’ve been, but not entirely comfortable either.
He trailed off, frowning at the bottle. It was one of the few things he had come across that seemed worth trying but he still wasn’t convinced it would work. He looked back at Potter, noticing for the first time that the Gryffindor was holding something in his hand too, a round blue bottle.
“Billywig.” Hardly a second passed after McGonagall spoke before the bust nodded its head once and the door swung inwards.
Being ignored by Potter, Draco quickly realized, was somehow even more frustrating than the constant, inexplicable attention that he had come to expect. The green eyes did not so much as blink in his direction at dinner that night, much to his annoyance, and yet when Pansy demanded to know what had Draco in such a mood, he couldn’t bring himself to tell her what had happened. He rarely kept secrets from Pansy, but this didn’t feel like his secret to share, no matter how much he might want her advice. If the situation were reversed and he had found out Potter had told Granger and Weasley about it, he would have felt utterly humiliated. Maybe they had been enemies once, but Draco owed Potter too much to do that to him now.
Potter, squashed between his many friends on one of the sofas, glanced around when he heard Draco’s name. Draco forced himself not to look over.
Pansy heaved a sigh. “Yes, well, count me lucky that at least my arranged marriage won’t be to a
“Well, you figured correctly.” Draco held out his hands for the books, but Potter made no move to return them.
half-witted idea—”
“We still care about each other,” Potter shrugged. “Her brother is my best friend, and the Weasleys are pretty much my family. She’s always going to be a part of my life. And it’s not like we broke up because we hated each other or anything.”
“After the war…” Potter crouched down, fiddling with one of the many golden faucets surrounding the massive sunken tub. “Things changed, I guess. It just wasn’t the same between us anymore.”
“Why Mandrake root?”
Draco felt he was going to be sick. He was out of options; there was only one thing left to do, his very last resort. When he spoke, all he could see was green.
Seamus Finnigan’s voice, already twice as loud and twice as annoying as a normal person’s, silenced all conversation as he raised it to address Draco. A hush fell over the eighth years who stood grouped around the classroom door, awaiting the arrival of Professor Flitwick.
” Draco spluttered, gaping in shock at the Gryffindor inexplicably undressing right in front of his eyes.
“If you can’t apologise and act civilly towards one another for the remainder of the lesson, then you can go explain to your Heads of House why both Slytherin and Gryffindor have suddenly lost fifty points.”
Potter’s eyebrows knitted together. “But, didn’t you tell Parkinson you would meet—?”
“Can’t tell you boys how thrilled I am you’ll be competing! I think we have a great shot, I really do,” Slughorn beamed, leaning across his desk towards them as he spoke. “I’ve submitted students’ names before, of course, and I remember when Damocles Belby…”
Draco started at him blankly, uncomprehending. It made no sense – he didn’t want to get rid of any of his scars? How could that be? Surely Potter, more than anyone, knew the burden that a scar could be; surely he must understand the weight of being forever marked with a relic of misfortune and suffering, the pain of being permanently branded with a reminder of the past. What kind of person wouldn’t want to be free of that?
Just as he suspected, he found Potter waiting for him outside of the classroom. Without a word, Draco turned and headed to a small alcove down the hall where they stood less of a chance of being overheard, knowing Potter would follow.
He was satisfied to see that he had managed to wipe the smirk from Potter’s lips. “I’m the pathetic one?” Potter bit back, eyes flashing. “Tell me, Malfoy, do you eavesdrop on everyone, or is it just me that you get off spying on?
They’d reached the main street almost without Draco even noticing. Without the bustle of students, the village was much quieter than he was used to seeing it, almost subdued. Or perhaps the residents had decided to preemptively take shelter, sensing the oncoming rain. Draco steered them towards the apothecary, the dingy glass of its windows and faded sign a familiar sight.
Draco’s muttered rebuttal about not needing any new friends fell on deaf ears. They were already approaching the fireplace, Pansy’s grip on his arm almost painful as she hauled him to a stop at the far end of the sofa from the Gryffindor trio.
Pansy gripped Draco’s sleeve. “Ignore it,” she muttered, shooting Finnigan a dark look.
The wall-to-wall shelves were crowded with bottles and jars of varying sizes, shapes, and colours, everything sorted alphabetically by ingredient name. Larger bundles of flowers, branches, and herbs hung from the ceiling, identifiable by the small, parchment-coloured labels that floated in the air just beneath them. Massive barrels filled with everything from glittering beetle eyes to slimy mounds of frog hearts covered most of the floor space, which was stained with a number of dark, unidentifiable splotches where it was visible.
“You will find your things already in your dormitories, which are down that hallway,” McGonagall gestured. “As you are all adults, you will be given a bit more leeway than you have been allowed in the past — a later curfew, and open leave to go to Hogsmeade. However,” she interrupted Thomas and Finnigan’s shouts of glee, “I expect that you will all conduct yourselves as
Draco gave no response, too occupied with his haphazard attempt to pack his bag while still keeping one eye on Potter.
Every few minutes, Draco would pause on a particular ingredient, fingers tracing absently over a label or the curve of a bottle while his mind worked, trying to recall its properties, its every possible magical use, its interactions with other ingredients. Would Diricawl feathers alter the effect of the Shrake spines? Was Crup bile safe to use in topical solutions? Were caiman teeth really any different than alligator teeth, and could they be used the same way?
He felt the bed shift as Pansy sat up. “I just thought you might be interested to know.”
“Fine, fine, not tonight.” He shook his head in exasperation. Between her and Madam Pomfrey, you would think he was still eleven years old. Turning his attention back to Potter, he said, “I have some correspondence I need to take care of anyway.” Pansy's expression had reminded him of his mother’s letter, and he knew it was probably best to respond soon before she began to worry too much.
“No what?” Potter frowned.
“You have a godson?”
Draco’s meticulous control wavered, all of the thoughts and emotions he had been trying to suppress flooding back into his mind. He had been so sure that he would be the one put on the defensive, and now Potter was… freely offering up his own thoughts? What was he after?
He shook away the thoughts, not wanting to let them sour his mood. “Come on, we should probably head back before it starts to rain.”
Weasley didn’t seem keen to let the subject drop. “Alright, sure, let’s say he is. I just don’t see why you have to be involved with it.” Draco tried to get a better angle, but Weasley’s back filled his view. All he could see of Potter was the edge of his right shoulder and a few particularly wild locks of hair.
“How did you survive the venom?”
“Mandrake root.” Draco held out a handful of the gnarled objects for Potter to examine before tipping a portion of them into the cauldron. At first, nothing happened, but after three stirs, the potion fizzed and darkened to a rich chestnut colour.
“I heard you the first ten times,” Draco snapped, resisting the urge to chuck the piece of synthetic skin across the room. “And I told you already, it
He started from the beginning, with the meeting with Slughorn that morning after Potions class. Pansy was quiet as he talked, only turning her head to look at him when he reached the end, hesitantly describing the surreal moment less than an hour ago in the Charms classroom when Potter had smiled and said he didn’t hate him.
There was hardly a foot of unused space in the shop, which made it somewhat difficult to navigate. Though everything was meticulously labelled, the narrow cursive lettering and dim light made deciphering many of the labels a challenge. The air was also much closer and warmer than outside, adding to the cramped, claustrophobic feeling of the place.
But unlike Draco, Potter didn’t tell his friends to shove it.
“Why?” Draco pushed away from the desk, turning to face Potter fully. The distance between them was no longer quite so careful, both of them toeing an invisible line. Draco wasn’t sure what would happen if they crossed it, and he didn’t know which possibility he was most afraid of.  “Why do we have to talk about anything? Why can’t we just—”
Draco squinted. “Wasn’t that also the year that your potions skills underwent a rather miraculous transformation?”
He could not afford to make any mistakes this year, that much had been made clear to him. Draco still didn’t know who or what had managed to convince the Board of Governors that he should be allowed to return to Hogwarts; he was sure that if some of them had had their way he never would have stepped foot in the school again. But in the end he had been granted permission to finish his education, albeit with the none-too-subtle warning that if he even stepped one toe out of line, it was all over for him. Being late to class might not have been exactly what they meant, but Draco wasn’t about to test it.
He grabbed a pile of his books from the bedside table and attempted to pack them on top of his pyjamas, but in his boredom over the past few days, he’d demanded that Pansy bring him so many that there was simply no way for all of them to fit.
, Draco’s brain supplied unhelpfully,
They spent the rest of the lesson in near silence as the students struggled with the dual challenge of nonverbal magic and concurrent charm casting. When the bell finally rang, there was a collective sigh of relief.
He could hear Potter’s bare feet behind him, shifting around. “You’re right, I don’t want to.” There was more shifting. Draco cast a tentative eye over his shoulder, just quick enough to see Potter with his wand in his hand, pointed at a what looked like an oval-shaped scar right over his heart. “
Most days, he and Pansy did their homework together, finding a secluded table in the back of the library and claiming it as their own for a few hours. Somewhere out of the way, somewhere quiet. It was what they had always done, ever since their very first year. So it was highly unusual when Pansy paused halfway across the eight-year common room one night while on their way to the library, her eyes fixed on a group of students sitting near the fireplace.
aware that you ever bothered to remember anything from Potions class.”
Add that to the fact that the
“Five minutes late is still late,” Draco answered, realizing as he said it that he sounded exactly like his mother. He looked up briefly to see Potter roll his eyes. He continued to fuss around with his potions equipment, arranging everything just so while Potter watched in an interested sort of way, leaning his elbows on the table. Draco didn’t know how he could look so relaxed; after their last conversation, even a quick glance from him was enough to make Draco tense up. He hadn’t even been able to tell Potter directly about where to meet him that evening, choosing instead to send him a note during Transfiguration telling him the time and the place.
“Granger and Weasley aren’t so bad.” Pansy shrugged. “The past is the past, right? Why shouldn’t we be friends with them?”
The corner of Draco’s mouth quirked, his expression almost fond. “Myrtle’s never had a great grasp on the concept of privacy.”
“I was more than happy to drop the subject myself, to be honest. I’ve never understood why Draco likes it so much,” Pansy said, pulling her Charms homework out of her bag. To anyone who didn’t know her, she was the picture of nonchalance. But Draco knew better. Wherever Pansy was going with this line of conversation, it was calculated. “I’m surprised that you seem so interested in it though. I wasn’t under the impression that it was exactly your favourite subject.”
He hoped it was Potter.
“It’s not working.”
“Did you come here just to watch me undress?” Draco asked, the coolness in his voice belying the way his heart had begun to pound as pushed his shirt off his shoulders. The question seemed to do the trick – Potter turned his gaze away from Draco’s bare torso, cheeks red.
Pansy pouted. “My voice isn’t
Though shorter than Draco when they were on equal footing, Potter seemed to tower now as he stood over the bed. His hands had come to rest against the sheets only centimetres from where Draco’s arm lay, and there was something dangerous in his gaze that sent a thrill down Draco’s spine.
Something tapped softly against the side of Draco’s ankle, nearly making him jump. He glanced under the desk, spotting a folded piece of parchment wriggling by his foot like a small animal. He looked over to where his friends were sitting to his left, making a quick assessment. Pansy appeared to be half-asleep, and Blaise, inexplicably, seemed like he might actually be paying attention to what the teacher was saying; Goyle, Draco knew, could never have managed to successfully charm a note to walk itself over to someone.
Potter raised an eyebrow. “And here I was thinking you had the answer for everything.”
“I know.” Potter held his hands up in a conciliatory gesture. “But sometimes it takes a Silencing Charm to shut Seamus up, and I know you weren’t about to do that.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Blaise furrowed his brow. “Friends. Right.” He looked unconvinced. “So, what, does that mean the two of you are best mates with the Gryffindors now?”
(See the end of the chapter for
A slow grin crept across Potter’s face. “That’s a terrible excuse, and you know it. Just admit it, Malfoy, you miss working with me, don’t you?”
“That is quite a relief.” Everyone’s immense relief was beginning to get on Draco’s nerves, seeing as no one had yet bothered to explain why they were all so concerned in the first place. How bad could this curse have been, exactly? “I’m sure you have a few questions.”
The silence wasn’t entirely unpleasant at first, but it grew more cumbersome as the minutes passed, pressing into the spaces around and between them. Draco was busy wracking his brain for something to say when Potter spoke up.
Draco spun around, the books slipping from his arms and hitting the floor with a dull thud. Any hope he might have had that Pansy was joking quickly evaporated. There, indeed, was Potter, standing near the doors of the Hospital Wing and watching them both with mild amusement. As Draco turned, Potter’s eyes flickered down, lingering on the pale skin of Draco’s exposed collarbones.
“I think we should add Wormwood Essence.” Potter lifted his head. His eyes were glazed, as if Draco had pulled him out of a reverie. “No more than four drops.”
Shaking slightly, he pulled himself out of the bath, modesty forgotten as he grabbed at his clothes, not bothering to dry off as he threw them on as fast as he could. He tried not to glance back to where Potter still stood in the bath, utterly silent, perhaps from shock, perhaps from something worse, something like disappointment.
Draco didn’t bother to consider the possibility that the Murtlap tentacles might not work. If this failed, they wouldn’t have enough time to come up with another alternative. At this point, it was their only hope.
“Yeah.” The smile came easily to him now when he looked at Potter, the green of his eyes, the kiss-stained colour of his lips. “Will you help?”
“You have a real talent for Potions, Mr. Malfoy,” Slughorn continued, looking at him with that same sad glimmer in his eyes.
“The first time I came here was in fourth year, actually, during the Triwizard Tournament.”
“Are we going to use more synthetic skin?”
Finally alone in the now empty Charms classroom, Draco realized he had not considered how to actually broach the subject.
It was for that reason – and that reason only – that he insisted he and Potter meet almost every night after class to continue working. Draco certainly wasn’t going to let Potter slack off after the Gryffindor had so stubbornly insisted that he be involved.
Potter huffed out something like a laugh. “I see you took that advice to heart.”
He lined the vials up on the table and lit a low fire under the cauldron. Potter was quiet for a moment, and then asked, “What should I do, then?”
The words rushed out in a furious burst. “Because they don’t accept submissions from Death Eaters, alright?”
Draco stood, reaching for the collar of his jumper. “Of course it’s safe. You saw before, it didn’t hurt the synthetic skin at all. And I tested a bit on my hand earlier, it’s completely harmless.” Potter didn’t reply, but Draco could tell he wasn’t convinced. He sighed. “If you’re really so worried…” He gestured at the water with a dismissive wave. “See for yourself, test it on your wrist or something.”
“There isn’t a problem.”
“Do you?” he asked, though he was pretty sure he already knew the answer.
There was no reason to linger, but they did anyway, hesitating at the door. Just before they parted ways – Potter going to catch up with his friends, Draco returning to the Defence Against the Dark Arts classroom to apologise to Professor Hayward – Potter reached out for his hand. Their palms pressed together, brief and warm, and then he was gone.
“Why do you think it didn’t work?” Potter repeated.
They grouped around her in a loose semicircle, numbering about two dozen in total. Draco was careful to stand as far away from Potter as possible.
Potter turned.
“That’s ENOUGH.” Draco didn’t realize just how close he and Potter were standing – how he could practically feel the heat of Potter’s anger, their wands crossed between them – until Professor Hayward’s spell forced them apart. He stumbled back two steps before regaining his footing, reluctantly lowering his wand.
“No, I will not let you help.” Draco pulled his arm out of Potter’s grasp, which had grown lax. He supposed he could have left then, with Potter no longer holding him in place, or at least he could have put some space between them, seeing how they were standing barely a step apart in the narrow stairwell. But he did neither, only reaching to rub absently at the place on his arm where Potter’s hand had been.
As he began to relate the successes and failures of his experiments, spreading his notes out beside the cauldron, he felt the awkwardness slowly start to ease. If he didn’t think too hard about who was sitting across from him, listening to his every rambling word, it wasn’t so terrible to have someone there. After months in the forced solitude of Malfoy Manor, brewing by himself in his study, Draco had forgotten how nice it was to not be alone.
That green… why did he suddenly detest that green?
Potter just laughed, the sound echoing off the stone walls of the potions classroom as Draco went to the store cupboard in search of a bowl. Potter was still grinning to himself when Draco returned, although he at least managed to stay quiet as Draco went about filling the shallow bowl with potion and carefully placing the skin in it to soak.
Draco held up the ingredients he’d collected, all of the bottles small enough to fit in one hand. “A few possibilities,” he said, the glass clinking as he adjusted his grip. “I think the dittany leaves could be useful. I’ve tried using essence of dittany before, of course, but maybe with the whole leaves…”
“I didn’t think they were going to let me give it to you that day, you know.”
Robbed of the ability to further pulverize his food, Draco shoved his plate away, appetite long gone.
“Er, right.” He cleared his throat. “I wanted to ask if maybe you’d reconsider. About the potions competition.” No use beating around the bush about it, it wasn’t as if Potter expected friendly banter.
“Yeah, and then what?” Draco folded up the letter, tucking it away in his bookbag along with his neatly folded pyjamas. “She’d be forcing me come home the very next day.”
“I guess I’ve lost my taste for them,” Draco answered with a shrug. It was the easiest answer, even if it wasn’t necessarily the whole truth. He’d always had a sweet tooth as a child, but now he couldn’t think of the last time he had actually craved the cakes or candies he used to love. Did he still like sweets? He wasn’t sure anymore.
Draco’s heart thudded as Potter’s eyes flickered to him, making it clear exactly what the research was for. He’d had no idea that Potter was doing research for their potion on his own.
“No, I really don’t.” Draco cursed silently to himself. With the way the Weasel was leaning forward, it was almost impossible now to see Potter’s expression. “I think he’s just… trying to move on. Like we all are.”
Draco lashed out blindly with his wand, shattering through the incessant stream of memories. The present seeped slowly back in, the unwanted images still lingering on the edges of his vision even as the classroom came into focus around him. He was standing in the same place at the front of the room, although Potter was now several paces further away, pushed back by the force of Draco’s shield charm.
But before Finnigan could even open his mouth, his path was blocked.
Draco was too much of a coward to tell Potter the full truth: that it felt like a sick kind of hypocrisy to punish a student for hurting him when he had never been punished for hurting so many of them.
“If you say so.” He leaned over the potion, expecting to see some effect from the Wormwood Essence, but so far, it looked as if nothing had changed. He frowned and reached for his wand. He had read once that, in rare cases, plant essences had the potential to raise the boiling point of a potion; perhaps that was the problem.
