Draco smirked. “I'm not particular. Anything you want. I mean think about it, I've already tried to let people harm me, so if you want to do that, it's not like I'm going to care. On the other hand, if you want to do things such as kiss me some more, I MIGHT find it interesting enough to look forward to.” He shrugged. “I guess we'll just have to see.”
Draco was utterly shocked the next morning for several reasons. For one, he'd actually slept through the night. For two, Harry was still in his arms – and they were snuggled up like cherished lovers. Finally, two house elves were staring at him expectantly – one of which was his father's old elf Dobby.
Before anyone could do anything other than laugh, a stern voice boomed out from nowhere. “KIDS! Where in the bloody hell are you?! It's quiet!”
Then all hell broke loose when Bella entered the room and immediately tried to summon the Dark Lord, only to spot a sword and scream orders that NO ONE could summon him until they knew exactly how and why the sword was there rather than in her vault.
Only that went all pear-shaped when Umbridge returned to her office with her Inquisitorial Squad in tow. Millicent Bulstrode had Hermione pinned to the wall, and Draco was smirking even as he repeatedly tossed Harry's wand in the air like a baton – catching it effortlessly. If Harry had had even a second to do so, he would have glared at Draco for – once again – acting like a bastard so effortlessly that Harry had to wonder if it was really an act. After all...
Draco turned around abruptly so that he was thoroughly tangled with Harry and holding him like a precious treasure. “You mean that?”
Draco shrugged. “I'll allow the spot right above it, but I have a lover and I'm not looking to get off with anyone else.”
The long months at school were not exactly pleasant. In fact Draco was now thoroughly disgusted with himself. With Voldemort in charge via Snape, he'd made some rather disturbing changes.
But Harry wasn't having it. “Merlin, Draco! You look terrible! Please tell me what you're doing; I'd rather help you than watch you continue to suffer like this!”
“Wait, you want me to make Harry *sing* what's on his mind?” Ron asked incredulously, deciding that Blaise had definitely lost the plot.
Since this would make both of them happy, Draco didn't object to being ordered around. That said, just to be a shit, he decided to follow orders in the most teasing way possible. He licked Harry's shaft, pressed little kisses along its rigid length, sucked lightly on his bollocks, and used a hand to slowly pump him without actually trying to get him off.
Harry hummed in sympathy, rubbing Draco's back. “Alright, I'll back off for now, but please consider telling me in the future. Who knows, maybe I'll come up with a way to help you and still manage to stop Voldemort from getting his way.”
He was at the stairs by this point, and the acoustics in the entire grand staircase were so good that he couldn't help but take advantage of them as he lightly jogged down the stairs a bit before magically sliding the rest of the way down the ornate banister.
Dolohov both nodded and shrugged. “Well, yes. Dumbledore IS dead. However, young Malfoy here, despite leading the mission rather well, seemed to falter at the last moment, and so, Snape burst onto the tower and cast the curse before any of us could really do anything to stop him. To be honest, I didn't think he had it in him, and so, it didn't really occur to me to intervene.”
Draco stood toward the back in relative safety since he was in charge and he was basically overseeing the battle. It would be up to him to stop the Death Eaters from disobeying any direct orders from the Dark Lord, otherwise he was more or less expected to just let them get on with it. Which he did, despite being repulsed by Greyback's methods – which left at least one body to step over – until he heard something that sounded like someone landing on the tower.
Draco gave a half shrug. “I have someone I want to be with more than anything, and I'm NOT going to give him up just because my parents would never accept it.”
Draco had to be seen as doing everything he could to stop Harry, even so, he was profoundly grateful that he knew how to cast spells nonverbally. In fact, he was rather good at it by this point. So, while aiming at Harry with what hopefully looked like deadly intent, he simply cast a harmless spell. It was actually a cheering charm, but Harry had other spells to dodge and threw himself to the floor and rolled to the safety of behind the sofa.
The next night he got the usual hello, followed by something new he couldn't read, and so, he decided to just ignore the writing. For a year or so, he kept his sleeves firmly down and never even dared to look at his arm when he was in the shower.
“Wha...?” Harry had to turn this information over in his mind a bit before it made sense. “You... You want to BE with me?”
! And... Draco wouldn't even know it was him anyway. Sighing, Harry pointed at Ron's ample cleavage.
At this point, one of the many people waiting to lick a drop or 10 of potion managed to get to the front of the line and point to Draco. He gave Draco a smoky grin and said: “I want to lick my drops off your shaft.”
Narcissa looked to her husband, who forced a tiny and just barely polite smile. After taking a sip of wine, Lucius deigned to reply. “We've decided to name you as one of our Heirs – with all the privilege that entails.”
Harry hummed in understanding and held his breath as he mentally prepared for the second half of his dare. When it happened, it was hot and acrid, but not enough to make him gag. In fact, it was sort of salty with a hint of something undefinable that Harry inexplicably liked. He kept sucking and swallowing until every last drop was gone. Then he probed the puffy little slit with his tongue in a search for more.
Harry and Draco got out of bed reluctantly. Both held hands without even realizing it until they were out of bed (they'd slipped off the end rather than one of the sides), then their hands gently slipped apart like a caress. Draco promptly cast dressing spells that had his clothes flying onto him in an instant.
“Mmmhmm!” The woman purred in agreement. The Potion Seller counted out exactly 12 drops, and then everyone watched in fascination as Blaise got to work slowly licking them off.
Draco snorted in amusement. “My only relationship so far has been a girl I don't really like in that way, so it's not exactly like I'm an expert or anything. All I know is that – aside from some general experimenting in school – I NEED to be in a relationship before I do the things I want to do with you.”
Harry pulled back to look Draco in the eye. Draco gulped nervously because it was a seriously look. Almost... deadly...
With a surprising amount of concentration – considering that he really thought he'd dwell on his problems – Harry shaped and molded the clay into a rather nice pot. The size and shape of it would make for a lovely flower pot – and since he was making so many of them in an attempt to keep his mind quiet, he might just have to give the lot of them to Neville for his flower shop.
Draco took the drink warily and sniffed it. Apparently finding the drink acceptable, he took a sip. His face had an appraising look on it for a moment before he took another sip. Then he gave her a tiny smile.
But was interrupted by Dumbledore, who sound a hundred times more furious than Harry had ever heard him. “YOU DARE MOLEST A MINOR!!!”
Draco was strangely at peace. He knew he was dying, and just like he'd hoped, it was at the hands of a respected enemy. Someone who even the Dark Lord could not fault him for losing to. He would die an honorable death, and best of all, all his struggles were now over.
that Harry didn't even notice because he was so caught up in all that pale skin and that devilish smirk and those smoky eyes and that disheveled hair and MMM! The whole bloody package!
A week later, after serving detention with Professor McGonagall, Draco was surprised to see something on his arm when he was changing into his pajamas. Something that sent an undesired thrill through him.
The woman gave Blaise an appraising look. “Hmm... I like what I see. Alright then, my lover, show me what you got.” She reclined across Draco's lap and spread her legs wide – shifting her skirt out of the way – so that the Potion Seller could apply the drop.
That said, something had been bugging him for a while now. When Bella led all the Death Eaters out on a mission to cause mayhem, and the Dark Lord was off looking for something, Draco decided to take a tiny risk. He joined his mother for tea, casting privacy spells around them the moment the elves had served them and been dismissed.
Harry and Ron scrutinized a picture she held up. It was of a man they'd never seen before. He had rather plain brown hair and dark eyes, and more than likely wouldn't be noticed if he was standing next to a person, he was that unremarkable.
The next time Harry got a close up view of Draco was when their teams were scheduled to play against each other. Slytherin had taken every unfair advantage it could get, and Harry stared at Draco suspiciously. Draco stood on his side of the initial team gathering, his white-blond hair gleaming in the sunlight, which also highlighted his crown-shaped badge that said: Weasley is our King.
With a sigh, he and Ron took a swig and hastily set the flasks down on the counter so that they could fall to their hands and knees and try not to cry from the hot searing pain. When they were finally done and could breathe again, they looked at each other. With a gasp of shock, Harry realized that Ron was now a petite and
Draco gave him a flat look for a moment before shrugging. He didn't want to start a fight now for anything short of an actual life or death reason to argue. Both boys simply held each other in silence for so long that they accidentally fell asleep. Luckily, Peeves started making a racket just down the corridor that woke them up.
“Oi, listen, STOP obsessing over Malfoy!” Ron advised in amusement. “HE'S not the reason we're here tonight! He just so happens to be getting pissed with his mates. WE need to keep an eye out for that bloke AND the potion.”
Harry shrugged. “Well I'd agree if he left it at that. Instead, he transfigured a bunch of desks into a bed, tied me to it, and tickled me all over with his tongue.” Harry blushed and looked away. “I was naked...” he added in a soft mutter he wasn't sure if he wanted them to hear or not.
Trying hard not to get his hopes up, Draco closed his eyes again and let Harry do whatever he wanted, which was surprisingly nothing more than kissing for the rest of the night. The passage of time and the alcohol eventually teamed up to put them to sleep, but it happened to be the best sleep Draco could ever remember having.
When he rushed into the first class of the day, it was to find everyone staring at him with mischievous grins.
As planned, Draco opened the door and stepped out by himself – already holding his Hand of Glory – and saw that his suspicion was right. Some of the more interfering students were loitering in the hall as if waiting for him. Not deterred in the slightest, Draco tossed out some Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder, then led his people through it by the light his Hand of Glory provided him alone.
With a small smile, Harry awarded Gryffindor the promised points for winning the challenge. Now all he had to do was review all the footage and determine each student's score – and thus, grade.
Draco chuckled and gestured to Blaise. “That's what you want HIM for! He's really good at it – or so I hear. AND he's got a shaft that makes licking potion off it REALLY worthwhile.”
There was silence as all three of them couldn't help but wonder if Harry would accept that as final, or if he'd try to argue.
break cover. Doing so at this point could fail him from the entire course! Still, Harry had to wonder if Draco chose these songs because he honestly felt this way, or if he just liked them. This one sounded so... real...
Since Harry's wand was presumably across the room with his clothes, Draco picked his up (he had discarded it on the cushion after getting naked) and handed it to Harry to borrow for a moment. “Here,” he said as he rolled onto his back. “Let me teach you all the necessary spells.”
– which was a love song. When she sang the chorus: “I love you, even when I'm sleeping, when I close my eyes, you're everywhere!” The chatter indicated that people were wondering if she was singing to anyone in particular.
Miraculously, Harry managed to avoid the Dursleys for several weeks. But then... Vernon came in to Harry's room to complain about Hedwig. “THAT RUDDY OWL –” Vernon stopped abruptly when he saw Harry sitting on his bed. The two of them stared at each other for a long moment. Then, as if unable to stop himself, Vernon slowly, jerkily, walked over to Harry.
Draco cast his school robes aside but left all the rest of his clothes on. He then rolled up his sleeves, exposing his smooth and creamy arms up to his elbows. After that, he slowly climbed onto the bed with Harry, his eyes roaming all over in clear indecision as to where to start.
“Eat up mate!” Ron insisted. “Say... why were you late anyway? I thought you had an excellent Alarm Charm set so that you WOULDN'T be late.”
Even so, he couldn't help but watch as the waitress returned to the counter, carefully selected something that would hopefully appeal to Draco – a nice India Pale Ale that Harry rather liked – and then poured it in a tall mug. She took a quick look around and subtly turned so that her back was blocking Draco's view if he should happen to be looking at her, but Harry could still see her side clearly enough to see her hands. She made a very tiny movement that Harry almost missed, pulling a vial out of her cleavage and emptying it into the mug.
Harry shook his head. “No, not AFTER. We both know that changing into others can hurt if the clothes are too tight.”
He paused the actual song for a few minutes so that he could lose himself in some vocalization, but then repeated the Chorus.
“Thanks anyway, but I'm off the market,” Draco informed everyone with an amused laugh. “But that said, I suppose I can sing another song.”
Sighing, Harry carefully got them both dressed, casting a lightening spell on Draco so he could dress him like a child. After they were both dressed and had all their belongings, Harry lifted Draco over his shoulder – thankful that the lightening spell made this possible – and then carried him all the way to the entrance to the Slytherin common room.
“Sadly,” Draco confirmed. “The girl I think I might marry is still in Hogwarts until the end of this year.” Which seeing as how the school year had only just begun, was basically the entire year.
Sure, Draco would be punished most severely, but he'd also have hope that Harry was out there and could eventually do something to defeat the Dark Lord. At this point, there was no illusion any longer that Draco had any sort of future should Voldemort remain in power. At best, he'd be free in name only, so long as he followed the Lord's every command – likely as an enforcer, as he was being groomed to be.
Blaise gripped the microphone as he waited for the music to reach the right beat. Part of his magi-laptop karaoke program was a spell to project the lyrics at the perfect spot for the singer to see them if needed. Bouncing just a little bit, Blaise sang a song called
James (the younger) nudged her with his elbow. “No use in chickening out now. We summoned them to answer questions, and that means answering questions in return.”
Harry gasped from uncontrollable laughter, rolling around in an attempt to escape, but Snape was surprisingly able to keep up with him. He was too weak to jump to his feet and run away – considering that he was still suffering from all the attacks on him over the past hour – but that didn't mean he just took it in silence.
Harry placed the clay on the wheel and tapped it to center it. He'd taken Ginny's advice on attempting to relax by taking a class to make a simple pot, even though he hadn't thought for a moment that it would help. She'd suggested that he learn a hobby to occupy his mind, and he'd scoffed, assuming that there wasn't a hobby on Earth relaxing enough to stop him from thinking about how he'd ruined his life by quitting his promising career as an Auror.
When Draco got close, he stopped rather abruptly to give himself a minute to delay the inevitable, and also, run his fingers down Harry's spine again. Harry moaned and arched his back before instinctively grinding his arse into Draco. He really got into it, clenching and unclenching his groin muscles as if trying to milk Draco.
Everyone else looked astonished bordering on downright gobsmacked. Ron and Hermione were even gaping at him. Suddenly, Terry burst out with: “Bloody hell! If I'd known that
Draco threw a handful of mini bombs at Harry's face. “You arsehole!” He threw another handful just as the first handful hit Harry, taking him by surprise and stinging more than anything. “You bastard! Fucking prick! Wanker!” With each insult, he tossed more of the bombs at Harry, now aiming for other places as Harry was trying to dodge them.
When Draco pulled back enough to work open Harry's trousers too, that's when he noticed the hesitation in Harry's eyes. “Something the matter?”
“That's perfect,” Harry proclaimed, claimed yet one more kiss, and then Apparated away – thanking his lucky stars that he'd gotten dressed BEFORE waking Draco.
Harry had no way of knowing that Draco was suddenly a nervous wreck, thinking about all the things that could have gone wrong. No, all Harry knew was that he had a surprisingly excellent night's sleep.
“Oh won't you stay with me? 'Cuz you're all I need, this IS love, it's clear to see, so darling, stay with me!”
Or he was, until Draco caught him coming up out of the dungeons. Harry had no idea how long he'd been caught in Snape's memories, but judging by the look on Draco's face, it was more than the hour the fuzzy spell lasted. Hermione told him later that she'd run across Snape and been told he'd been let go early, and so, hadn't bothered to come looking for him – assuming he'd gone to bed.
Harry privately thought that Draco looked adorable while only half dressed and sporting a messy case of bedhead. Suppressing a grin, he focused on the bacon and eggs he was cooking. When they were getting close to done, he made some toast to go with them.
“If it helps, I'll tell her you had no choice in the matter,” Harry assured him. “But to be fair, she DID say that she knows you might occasionally have to do things as an Auror she might not like, so I think she'll understand.”
Draco savored the armful of Harry for a long moment before pushing him away. “Listen, this thing between us doesn't seem to be working. We don't talk unless we're arguing about something. The only time we seem to get along is when we're shagging, and as much as I'd rather give up my soul than give up you, I think that you would be happier with someone else.”
Wait, no. This was an impetuous Gryffindor. A rough and blunt Gryffindor with no subtlety. If he wanted another weekend, he'd just say so. He'd have sent an owl of invitation. He
Draco stood up and brought his dishes to the sink, vanishing the last of the food off his plate as he did so. Then – before he could change his mind, he headed toward the fire and took a pinch of floo powder from the pot.
Taking a breath to shake off his negative thoughts, he dipped his hands in the bucket of water and made sure they were nice and wet. Then he placed them on the clay and started the wheel spinning fast. With a slight but firm forward push, Harry shaped the clay into a bit of a column before flattening it – sort of ensuring that the clay was nice and mixed with no air pockets. Once it was ready, he pressed his thumbs into the center, and then with a finger and his other hand for support, opened up a well going to about a half inch from the bottom.
The conversation went on, but Draco had already lost interest in it. He felt SO close to fixing this bloody buggering cabinet. Except that when he sent an object transfigured into a bird through as a test, it returned dead. In other words, he'd failed once again. With a mopey sigh, he lay down on a dusty OLD divan and took a nap.
This inexplicably interested Harry, who got a rather disconcertingly good look at the sight as he waited for Draco to shift to a comfortable laying position, and then covered him with the blanket. Then Harry sat there staring at him for several long moments wondering why the sight of Draco in his bed made him feel uneasy. It was suddenly stiflingly warm in the room and his heart felt like he was supposed to be running away from some serious danger.
Tearing at his hair and seriously wondering if he would be able to find a way to murder Peeves for putting him through this, Draco shook his head, desperately trying to NOT sing anything else, but it burst forth anyway.
The next thing he knew, a feeling in his arm made him sit up with the certainty that his mark was burning him, only it wasn't. Instead, there was writing.
Determined not to think about him, Harry vowed to spend the entire summer forgetting every tender moment the two of them had ever had.
Draco sighed impatiently and waved that away. “NOT for the club! I already know what to wear there.”
“I DON'T WANT TO BE FRIENDS! I WANT TO BLOODY MA–AH!!!” Draco had both hands over his mouth this time.
She was silent as she chewed on her bottom lip in thought for a long moment. “Well... I suppose... no. You said he seemed to have a bit of control. He dragged you to someplace private, and then used gentle methods that you actually enjoyed. I'd say – like the example I used of Cho kissing you – I'd say that if he licked and shagged you, it's because he wanted to.”
A few days later, Harry was laying under the window out in the yard so that he could listen to the news without his Aunt and Uncle seeing him. To his relief, nothing important or suspicious that could be Voldemort's fault happened. Unfortunately, a loud banging like someone Apparating caught his aunt and uncle's attention, making him jump up to protect himself, bang his head excruciatingly on the open window, and enrage his uncle to the point that Vernon tried to strangle him.
But then Harry realized that he was going to die and see Sirius again, and that made him so happy and full of love, that Voldemort couldn't bear it. He left Harry completely – startled to find that half the employees of the Ministry had just arrived. He magically grabbed Bellatrix and vanished. Dumbledore promised to answer Harry's questions in just a half an hour before handing him a golden head (from the statue protecting him) which was a Portkey that he created (illegally) on the spot.
The waitress looked ready to roll her eyes. “That's our most popular ale, I assure you, it's not swill.”
And THEN – when they were trying to learn Apparation for the first time – Harry had managed to sneak up on him when he was arguing with Vince. Of his two henchmen, Vince was the one more likely to question Draco, which seriously irked him.
The next time he saw Draco was on the Hogwarts' Express, and he was still so angry at the slimy git that he felt justified hexing him and his henchmen unconscious, and then leaving them laying there – definitely worse for the hexes – for the rest of the trip. In fact, his last sight of Draco was still unconscious as everyone else disembarked. For all he cared, the bastard could lay there forever.
Harry chuckled softly, looking Draco up and down as he leaned against the door of the ballroom. “At first, I woke up when you slipped out of bed, and I thought maybe you were just going to get breakfast, but then I heard you talking to someone, so I followed to find out who. As it turns out, you were singing to yourself, and I was amazed at how good you sounded. So I followed you, quite enjoying the sight of you in your pants while dancing around. But then I realized WHAT it was that you were actually saying.”
About 10 minutes later, Ron and Hermione were astonished to see Harry walk into the common room. He'd pulled his cloak off to give the password, and then promptly forgot that he didn't want anyone to see him at the moment. He was still lost in a highly dreamy remembrance of what had happened.
This gave Harry an opening to advance his real mission. “Oh? Malfoy managed to be nice to someone? That's unexpected. Tell me, when did you two meet?”
Back in the Room, Draco already had all the things he needed to implement the plan. After all, he'd had almost all year to fine tune and refine it, and he'd been carrying the supplies with him so that he couldn't be caught off guard should things finally work out. Thus, once the Dark Lord had summoned everyone via his Marks (which Draco hissed as his burned unbearably for a few moments) and they had come through the cabinet, Draco was ready to lead them.
Harry shook his head and let out a heavy sigh. “Nothing. It's just... my dad... He might've actually been an arrogant arsehole after all.”
On the other hand, despite the fact that Draco had started out playing the field – with Harry's knowledge and acceptance – he'd ended up... not... Probably from the moment Draco first brought Harry back here to the Manor, he'd just not been interested in anyone else. And he honestly couldn't figure out why!
Inside an old and rather dingy house, Harry was beyond happy to see and hug Molly, who promptly tried to tickle him (as Moody had unthinkingly taken off the Disillusionment just then). Thankfully, everyone else was already headed off to a meeting and weren't looking at him.
“No,” Draco replied even as he finished up his slash and rinsed off with the bidet. He turned to face Harry. “We tried that in Hogwarts and came to the realization that we made a
His body was now shaking from the effort of suppressing his magically bound urge to drag Draco away and do as dared. Ron was clearly wondering what Harry had been dared to do – since Harry probably looked about ready to vomit – and patted him on the back in commiseration. Unfortunately, this unbalanced Harry and made him lose his grip on the table.
“Sorry ladies, looks like you're going to have to pick another person to sit on,” Draco informed them with a smirk. He got up and walked over to the stage before anyone could stop him. Meanwhile, Blaise actually held up his hands in a gesture asking everyone to wait a moment.
With infinite tenderness, Harry pulled Draco onto the bed, settling them both so that – despite being fully dressed – they could actually fall asleep in each other's arms. This was when Draco surprised Harry with a soft kiss.
iiin my skiiiiin, these woounds they wiill not heaaal, feeear is how I faaall, confuusing whaat is reaaaaaaal...”
Harry raised a brow curiously. Normally he didn't go to the Leaky – or anywhere in public really – without at least one of his friends to chase off overeager fans, but tonight, Ron and Hermione had a special dinner planned, Neville was on a date with Hannah, Dean and Seamus were having a night in, and even Luna and Ginny were off doing other things. Thus...
“Oh won't you stay with me, 'cuz you're all I need, this ain't love it's clear to see, but darling, stay with me!”
She rolled her eyes. “Just that you sing it with us all the time. I want you to stretch your repertoire a bit, yeah?”
No one knew quite how to react. Slowly, as the couple resumed their shocking kissing, the other patrons started to clap and offer soft congratulations. They felt that it had to be a good sign for a Malfoy to choose a muggleborn as his bride.
Harry did his best to ignore him, but God damn! WHY did his Soulmate have to be such an infuriating, foul, nasty bastard jerk arsehole sonovabitch?! ARGH!!!
Ron patted Seamus on the back sympathetically even as Harry quickly stepped around him and grabbed his pajamas out of his trunk so that he could get dressed and crawl into the privacy of his bed before anyone else showed up.
They all got busy eating and Ron ACTUALLY managed to forget his illicit pact until Peeves decided that everyone had eaten enough and started howling near the enchanted ceiling – which was in the process of displaying a gorgeous sunset.
Draco wanted to laugh and give Harry a few more kisses, but they couldn't risk anyone seeing them now that the door was open. Besides, Harry was already under his cloak and – presumably – rushing back to his dorm. Happy for the moment at least, Draco swaggered back to his own dorm, crawled into bed, and passed out with a stupid smile still on his face.
Harry sighed in frustration. “Madam Pomfrey says that she's tried everything she could to break this curse. Bill has too. And they both say that because it was some sort of accidental jumble, nothing breaks it. It must have a very specific countercurse, but only the person who cast it would know what it is, and since it seems to have been an accident, THEY might not even know it either.”
Harry paused a moment to think this over. If he was honest, he'd actually REALLY liked kissing Draco. Smiling a bit shyly, despite being alone in his bed with the curtains shut, he shrugged.
During the meeting, the Dark Lord had humiliated the entire family, inviting the other Death Eaters to laugh at them. He ordered Lucius to hand over his wand – which he reluctantly did – and then taunted Bellatrix with the news that her niece (Nymphadora Tonks) had married Remus Lupin. He'd finished the whole thing off by asking Draco if he planned to babysit the cubs.
“Something wrong Potter?” Draco asked with a smug smirk. He could clearly afford to buy his own drinks, but it amused him to be a pest. He'd probably generously offer to buy a round in a minute anyway.
Harry tried it and it only took three attempts before his clothes did what they were supposed to. Harry rewarded Draco with a kiss. “What's the other spell again?”
Before anyone could respond, the woman Blaise was licking let out a high pitch squeal and pushed him away. “Alright enough! I can't TAKE any more!” She was panting heavily and someone handed her a shot of Firewhiskey to wet her throat and calm her breathing. A moment later, she kissed Draco. “Thanks for the suggestion, luv! You were right.”
For better or for worse, Dumbledore took the blame for Harry and left the school via Phoenix magic. Thus, Harry was left wondering about many things. Such as how much blame Cho had for her friend snitching. And more importantly, just exactly HOW mad was he at Draco?!
Draco very quickly informed the man that he'd worked out a plan to fix up a vanishing cabinet that was connected – he was reasonably certain – to the one in the shop. The more Draco talked at first, the more into his explanation he got, even using his hands to illustrate his point. Mr. Borgin went from looking a little interested to strangely resentful. Maybe even a little afraid.
Occasionally, a bloke would try to get in Draco's way and try to entice him to dance, but Draco would simply give that man an icy glare until he got the point and moved out of the way. Based off the muttering of the crowd when Draco was in the club, the gorgeous blond was very popular and in demand, but he was also cold and not someone any of them wanted to get to know or try dating.
Harry groaned and hung his head in shame. No one had time for anything other than paying attention to their instructor until they finally had a break for lunch. Harry was so exhausted in general that he rested his head on the table before even opening the lunch Kreacher had packed for him and practically fell asleep.
But rather than warm up in the slightest, Slughorn simply moved on, murmuring: “Yes. I was sorry to hear that he died, although of course it wasn't unexpected. Dragon pox at his age...”
Of course, Draco couldn't just NOT taunt Harry too: “Hey, Potter, how's your scar feeling? Sure you don't need a lie-down? It must be, what? A whole week since you were in the hospital wing; that's a record for you, isn't it?”
If Draco could have cast a spell to have the floor swallow him whole, he would have! He was mortified that Harry had witness the whole thing! He was honestly too gobsmacked to even be snarky!
Lily and Pearl stood by to each toss a different potion onto a large pile of spell ingredients, which was meant (among other things) to activate a brief portal. The moment they tossed the potions – the glass bottles shattering the contents over the spell ingredients – a small explosion caused a bright flash that blinded them all for a moment. When they had the ability to look again, a glowing lavender oval floated before them.
Draco decided to look up at the ceiling on the off chance that more truths he'd quite like to avoid telling came out. “I look inside myself and see my heart is black, I see my red door I must have it painted black, Maybe then I'll fade away and not have to face the facts, it's not easy facin' up when your whole world is black – Only when I start to think about it, I HATE everything about you, why do I love you?”
Lily2 took over the explanation. “It was a spell we found in a book rumored to be written by Merlin himself.”
damn near shagging right on the dance floor. This had the rest of the crowd cheering them on and trying their best to copy them.
Snape quickly and repeatedly cast a spell that seemed to stop Draco from actually dying, followed by fixing him up, followed by returning him to his body. Even so, Draco was still about half out of it. He couldn't even protest when Snape lifted him up and helped him toward the door, saying something like: “You need the hospital.”
Happy to discover naked flesh under his hands, Harry caressed everything. He also pressed lots of tiny kisses to places like Draco's neck and shoulders. Soft moaning encouraged him to leave little bruises until Draco almost looked like he'd been pummeled by a hailstorm.
Pansy immediately went to the loo to double check her appearance. Draco took advantage of this by having a quick word with Blaise. By the time Pansy returned, Draco had ordered a round of drinks and joined Greg at the table that had been reserved for the Slytherins.
“Well I guess I'm dancing then,” Ron grumbled, NOT relishing the idea of singing, especially when he had no idea what this girl he was Polyjuiced into was capable of and was wearing next to nothing in this place that was as hot as an oven.
Draco kept his eyes on her so that he wasn't tempted to look over at the person he was actually singing this song to. Especially with lyrics like: “Help me! Tear down my reason. Help me! It's your sex I can smell. Help me! You make me perfect. Help me become somebody else!”
Harry forced a tiny smile, laughed, and flapped his hand dismissively. “That's what I have you for!”
Draco was a bit torn between being relieved that he hadn't been sent out to lead a rampage on more or less innocent people, and being upset that he was being kept rather close to the Dark Lord's side. That said, it seemed as if Voldemort had taken a bit of a liking to him, personally teaching him things and expecting him to perform the duties of his right hand man. For example, when Dolohov and Rowle returned to report that they'd had Harry Potter and his two friends practically in their grasp, only to be defeated leading to their escape. Draco was responsible for performing the Cruciatus Curse on them to the Dark Lord's satisfaction.
“If you want your chair back, you're going to have to buy me a few drops of Lust,” Harry stated, unable to stop himself from challenging Draco after all.
She sighed in disappointment. “Well then, I think I'll go dance for a bit before I make any irrevocable decisions.”
That said, he was so incredulous and angry at Hermione for coming up with such a reckless plan that nearly got them killed, that he was actually yelling at her when Ron showed up with Neville, Ginny, and Luna. Which despite making Harry extremely frustrated at first, turned out to be a good thing since Luna was the one to remind them that Thestrals were perfect for their current needs.
Harry was ready to start shouting obscenities at him again, but since Draco turned his attention to unbuttoning his shirt, Harry quickly shut his mouth and enjoyed the show. After the third button, Draco had an odd frown cross his face and muttered to himself: “Why am I bloody doing it by hand???”
The next time Harry saw Draco was at the End of Term Feast. Dumbledore was talking about Cedric's death, and Draco didn't look sad in the slightest. In fact, he didn't even seem to be paying attention! This pissed Harry off so much that if it had just been the two of them, there'd have been hexes and punches flying in equal measure.
“You once tried to cast the Cruciatus Curse on me,” Harry pointed out, then mentally smacked himself for bringing up the night he nearly murdered Draco.
Harry waited to see if the vial had contained a poison or other potion. He happened to have a Bezoar on him, so he was confident that Draco wouldn't die, and also, Auror or not, he'd promptly arrest her in that instance. But after several long and tense moments, in which Draco looked almost pleased as he drained his mug, there was no sigh of poison, so Harry relaxed.
Ginger smacked both their rears after the three of them accepted their drinks – which Harry and Ron spiked with a dose of Polyjuice. “I don't care if you can't dance to save your lives, drink up and get your arses out there!”
faithful – in a way, a sort of convoluted way, but still. On the other hand, his definition of body shots was NOTHING like Harry had imagined!
Draco let out a heavy sigh. “Look, I hope you know I have nothing against you, but if I'm required to marry you, I probably won't visit you more often than strictly necessary to create those Heirs we're supposed to have.”
Ron snorted in amusement. “You mean HERMIONE learnt! The two of us were as lost as ever and she basically did all of the work herself.”
They ALL finished up the summoning with: “Hear us – oh ancestors – and take form so that you can temporarily visit us!”
They'd only been dating about 10 months, but already the relationship seemed to be dying. It had started out as a passionate blaze, but now...
“Horny?” The woman asked with a smirk. “Enjoy!” She bade as she smacked Ron on the arse and turned to sell some drops to others.
They were somewhat interesting to learn as theories: “If your enemies are determined to murder you, you could always try to deter them by exploding their eyeballs or peeling their flesh right off their bones.” But Draco was actually sort of glad that the Dark Lord – and thus the Carrows – focused almost exclusively on using the Cruciatus Curse. It meant that as horrible as it was to torture his fellow students with it, he wasn't required to cast spells to boil them in oil or permanently break their legs.
Getting to his knees, Harry began at the bottom and worked his way up, licking every drop as slowly as possible to savor the experience. Once he got to Draco's belly button, he shifted his eyes to Draco's and...
After a moment, Draco pulled back so that he could concentrate on finding a pace and angle that pleased Harry. Harry gasped, surprised all over again by how good this felt. “Go ahead, pound into me!”
“Good to know,” Harry murmured as he squinted into the flask and prepared to down a gulp. He had already stripped off, even discarding his pants since they were his favorite and he didn't want to risk ruining them.
The orbs shimmered and grew much bigger and fainter for a moment before seeming to melt into actual people. Physically real people who could touch and be touched. Not to mention talk and be asked questions.
Then Harry flung his arms around Draco and Draco gasped out a small sob of longing and relief and sheer need. He pulled Harry into him and held him so tight that Harry almost couldn't breathe. Lucius – and about 99 percent of those in the hall – was goggling at them in shock and astonishment.
Hermione shook her head. “NO, because I don't really want our kids to know all the kinky details of our night.”
Half of Draco wanted to insist that they keep each other busy all night, but the other half needed all the sleep he could get so he could concentrate on his cabinet shaped problem. “Yeah... I should too, since I don't have a handy cloak to hide me, and I'm probably way past even the Prefect's curfew.”
All too soon, he was back at Bella's side. Suddenly, the chandelier came crashing down on them and Draco felt justified in protecting himself rather than try to prevent Harry from escaping. It was sheer chaos with Harry grabbing the three wands (including Draco's) out of his hands, his mother trying to pull him to some semblance of safety, their old house elf Dobby disarming his mother, Harry shouting for his weasel to take Granger and go, and then...
Harry chuckled. “It's a proper flat, it's just that I didn't need a lot of space and am actually used to cramped living quarters, so...” he shrugged. “Why get a bigger place?”
Meanwhile, when Harry could drag his eyes off Draco for five or so seconds, he managed to glance over at Blaise and Pansy, who were
Blaise immediately grinned in his most seductive way. “Well now! In that case, how would you like to go on holiday with me for a month on my Island in the Maldives.”
“NO I DON'T WANT TO BE YOUR FRIEND! I WANT-!” Once again, Draco managed to slap a hand over his mouth and stop himself from blurting out shameful secrets. He turned away and gave another rather feeble attempt at escaping Harry's grasp.
Now curious himself, Draco tilted his head back in a gesture prompting Harry to finish his sentence. “And then what?”
Not too far in, just far enough not to be seen, Harry stopped and gestured to a grass and leaf covered area that looked relatively soft. “Here?”
Narcissa looked close to tears again. She stroked his face repeatedly. “Oh love... You shouldn't have to... It's not right... Soulmates should be together – or at the very least, be able to tell the world that they're Soulmates and clearly need to teach each other things.”
JUST when he and Snape were about to hex each other – er, practice Occlumency (in a strangely combative manner) – Draco burst into Snape's office.
Harry was shocked to see that Draco looked not just panicked or frantic, but genuinely close to crying. He let go of Draco's arm and blew out a heavy sigh. “I'm sorry, Malfoy. I just... you bloody baffle me, you know? Even now that the war is over and I KNOW you're not trying to help a madman take over the world, I can't seem to get you out of my head.”
Draco held out his hand and waited patiently. Harry hesitated, and then placed his hand in Draco's who tugged him into his arms and held him tight. “Is there anything I can do to help you feel better?”
“WHAT?!” Draco roared incredulously even as Harry scratched his head in confusion and questioned: “What?”
Harry glared at them. “Oh you got away with plenty! I'm STILL shocked that Minerva didn't expel the lot of you!”
“Listen one and all, tonight I have a special treat for you! A one of a kind fight – a LYRICAL battle!” He cried out in a singsong voice as he rolled and swayed through the air. “For this battle, two unlucky students have been cursed to sing nothing but the truth and will have to fight it out in song. So sit back, me hearties, and enjoy my treat. I promise you a musical delight!”
Harry smirked at him, thinking that it wouldn't be bad to be the bottom partner again, since this had been seriously brilliant. Then he sighed a bit morosely. “We should probably get to our dorms before...”
Draco chuckled softly, understanding that Harry was referring to tickling in the exact same way he'd tickled him before. He lifted Harry's face until they were looking in each other's eyes. “Love to.”
Even so, he far preferred it if Harry won. As he sat there in relative safety, he held his head in his hands and tried his best to come up with clever plans to help Harry as best he could without a wand. When the Dark Lord called a temporary cease to the battle, Draco was so relieved that he slumped over and inadvertently took a nap.
“That's true...” Harry whispered as he thought this over. “I'm... not adverse, but... I... I really think that we should both think this over before jumping into anything.”
The next evening, Harry was locked in his room so the Dursleys could leave for a bit, only to be shocked when nearly a dozen people showed up to escort him to a safe place. At first, it was dark, but then a witch named Tonks used a Lumos. Harry rushed to shake hands with Lupin, who frowned in confusion when his other hand immediately tried to tickle Harry's side. The other witches and wizards crowded in with outstretched hands until Moody Disillusioned him and that seemed to curb their enthusiasm.
Without warning, he cast a Petrificus Totalus where he thought Harry must be hiding if he was there. Sure enough, a body crashed onto the floor with a loud thunk and Harry was revealed in a comical hunched up position. The sight of Harry made Draco smile.
The moment the water was the perfect temperature and Harry stepped under it, Ron entered the room. “Are you okay? And don't worry, I spelled myself so that I won't attack you with tickles.”
Harry was a bit alarmed by the fact that it was difficult to breathe. He was also rather disgusted that liquid kept dribbling into his mouth from something that felt like a smooth pair of lips. To his relief, it didn't smell or taste like what he thought pee would.
“I only do that to get you to pay attention to me,” Draco informed him before looking rather shocked. He then seemed like he was trying hard to take it back but couldn't.
Minerva smirked at him and then turned her attention back to Harry. “Do you have a plan for if your children abandon their Houses and work together to win?”
Draco's legs started to shake and he had to grip the shelf behind his hips in order to remain upright. “Merlin, fuck! Salazar! Potter, if you don't stop, I'm going to – to –” he was cut short by a groan of sheer pleasure. His bollocks tightened as a feeling like electricity went up his spine. His toes even curled!
Harry was now squealing with helpless laughter and trying his best to roll under his bed, only he was at the one angle that made that difficult unless he rolled away and flattened out first.
Meanwhile, Harry looked like the article was written about someone else, and the weasel looked remarkably close to being jealous – considering that he was pounding his pestle into the work table rather than the mortar full of scarab beetles. After Snape told them off, Harry finally thought to look at Draco, who was so upset by this point that he simply HAD to show his anger. So he tapped on his badge in the spot that would make it read POTTER STINKS!
“Peeves!” McGonagall cried out sternly, but he stuck his tongue out at her and blew a raspberry before flying out of the Hall – just far enough that she likely wouldn't chase him.
Blaise sighed as if trying to gather up and maintain the patience of a saint. “Look Weasley, it's harmless. It'll only last until they feel better. Don't you want your best friend to feel better?”
They wrestled and grappled around on the cushion for so long that it was a miracle that someone didn't come looking for them after all. Eventually, they were both so turned on and ready that Harry grabbed Draco by the back of his neck and glared at him fiercely.
Meanwhile, Wormtail had been sent to the dungeon to investigate a strange sound, and had called a report up the stairs that nothing was wrong.
Miraculously, they did as they were told. Perhaps they understood that Draco didn't really have a choice in the matter. Or maybe Harry just didn't want to force his hand at the moment. Either way, Draco was able march into the dungeon and drag Griphook away.
Within minutes, Blaise announced that it was time to begin. He loaded the first song and called Pansy up to sing it. She grinned smugly – having put her name down to be first after the last Karaoke night had been such a success. She got up on stage and sang
Before he could say a word or take a breath, he was up and marching to the front of the room where Draco sat with his brethren. Almost certain that his face was making the same expression it would make if he was in front of a firing squad, Harry grabbed Draco firmly by his arm and yanked him off his stool. THANK MERLIN that he had enough control to drag him to the storage cupboard.
Thus, Snape was getting frustrated by Harry's lack of progress and taunting him. “You're such a bloody moron, Potter! You can't even stop me from seeing your worst memories and giving me ammunition to use against you! You were doing better when I unwillingly tickled you!”
It was chaos in the house for around a half an hour with Dudley vomiting, the Dursleys all accusing him of attacking Dudley, an owl arriving to expel him from Hogwarts followed by another to tell him that it will be taken care of and not to leave the house, another telling him not to leave the house, one telling him that he was not quite expelled yet and had a hearing instead, and finally a howler that shamed Petunia into standing up to her husband when he tried to evict Harry from their house.
“Well I suppose – since you're being so insistent – I can stay where I am for a while,” Draco drawled, trying to sound uninterested in this turn of events, except he was so turned on that his expression probably gave him away.
This time when Draco tickled Harry's neck with his tongue, it actually made Harry laugh. Soft closed mouth giggles that made his chest and stomach move but not to the point where he was squirming or trying to get away. Draco alternated the tickling with unexpected bite to the nape of Harry's neck. At the same time, his hand drew long lines down Harry's spine.
Then – before Draco could even wrap his head around what had happened, despite staring at the falling body in horror – Snape grabbed Draco by the back of the neck and insisted that he run away before the other side caught onto what had happened and tried to stop them. Sure enough, by some miracle, the so called good side thought they were on the run from the Death Eaters, and the Death Eaters themselves knew that Draco was in charge, and so, no one at all attempted to stop them from running away.
Greg – or at least he thought it was Greg, he wasn't sure which girl was which, to be honest – giggled despite his deep wish not to call attention to himself, then blushed when Harry turned to look at him. Draco took advantage of the momentary distraction to push past Harry and rush off to a nearby hiding place to wait for Harry to move along. Soon enough, he was safely ensconced in the Room of Hidden Things, once again trying everything he could think of to fix this bloody aggravating cabinet.
But no! He now had an owl! And she was real enough that she could land on him, put dead mice on his chest, and try to nibble on his fingers. Good thing he wasn't afraid of mice or spiders, having been raised in a cupboard.
The moment Bella was satisfied the sword was a fake and called the Dark Lord, she offered Granger to Greyback. This triggered a somehow miraculously free weasel to spring forth from the door leading down to the dungeon. He then managed to shock everyone in the room by disarming Bella, her wand being caught by Harry, who promptly stunned Lucius.
Which meant that he had to confer with the Karaoke Master for a few minutes until they decided on a song for him to sing. As that was happening, some general upbeat dance music was played and shenanigans resume as they had been. Suddenly, an expectant hush fell over the club.
“Very little!” Pansy purred with a knowing grin even as she held up a pair of leather trousers that would look sexy as fuck on Draco.
“Good news, my lovelies! It's time for Karaoke to start! And remember, if you're not singing, you're dancing! House rules! Anyone NOT following the rules will be heckled relentlessly, insulted thoroughly, and even evicted with extreme melodrama!”
At this point, Snape himself must have managed to win his duel, because he arrived, also panting. He immediately dropped to one knee before Voldemort. “It's done, my Lord. As I have told you for many years, Dumbledore's trust for me would be his undoing.”
“What?” Harry blurted out in surprise, taking a better look at those fashion models. “Oh...” Sure enough, he recognized Blaise Zabini, Pansy Parkinson, Theo Nott, and the other girl whose name he couldn't remember off hand. There was also another girl he didn't recognize and...
Harry chuckled. “Well, if I had my druthers, you'd have met your justice in the Final Battle, but since you didn't, I would prefer it if you lived out a natural life. What I'm ACTUALLY saying is that I don't need to be named as one of your Heirs; I have plenty of my own money, thank you very much.”
When the song was over, after a lengthy outro that Pansy danced him through, she took the microphone and
He gave her a faint smile that still probably looked at least a little drunk. “Well, so there was a person – I don't want to say who – who came across me shortly after the fuzzy spell wore off. He seemed to have a bit of self control in that he didn't immediately hold out his hands and try to tickle me in the corridor. On the other hand, he – despite being rather confused by why he wanted to tickle me – cast a Petrificus Totalus on me, then levitated me to a nearby classroom.”
be Veritaserum since I can't seem to stop telling the truth!” Draco was sounding a bit frantic now. He leaned back a little as if trying to pull free from Harry's grasp, but not very strenuously.
“Where did you go, Malfoy? Look, I didn't realize that you would get mad, or I would have just told you what happened myself. I'm sorry! I'm such an idiot at times. Will you come back here so that we can talk?”
Harry spun to face him and crossed his arms over his chest. “You'll WHAT?” He asked in a tone of definite challenge.
Harry groaned and tore at his hair as he paced. Eventually he decided to just forget this whole dilemma and focus on the bloody egg. So, taking Cedric's advice, he lugged it off to the Prefects' bathroom to take a bath with it.
Draco huffed a soft laugh. “There's no need to be so nervous, Potter. I'm not expecting you to be some sort of chivalrous knight and save me yet again.”
With a grin, Blaise held out his hand. “Alright, if this goes all pear-shaped, meet me in the Three Broomsticks.”
? I'm so scared that I'll never, get put back together, keep breaking me in, and this is how we will end, with you and me... bent.”
Draco took these signs in stride, quickly moving his mouth to cover Harry's shaft and give it a good suck.
That led to a conversation about Cho's feelings until Ron discovered that Hermione was writing to Viktor Krum, and THAT provoked some blessed silence as Ron stewed for a bit. Then they went to their dorms. Harry drifted off utterly confused about Cho and girls in general. He sincerely wished that they taught a class on how to understand how a girl's brain worked.
All of the adults were laughing now, especially Padfoot, who lightly backhanded Prongs across the chest. “MERLIN! Not even WE managed to slip so much innuendo into a single conversation!”
The cries of grief were so deafening that Draco might have been able to join in without notice, but he couldn't risk it. His best bet now was to wait until the right moment presented itself. A moment in which he could rejoin his parents and encourage them to... Maybe they could all escape? Find a different country where they could build a nice nest to hide in, warded to the teeth so they'd never be found.
With a sigh of profound relief, Draco felt weak in the knees and flopped down next to Harry before he fell off his feet. “Look, we both know very well why we can NEVER tell ANYONE about this! Not even your weasel or little-miss-know-it-all.”
The other Unforgivable Curses were harder to justify learning, but Draco could still think of a few reasonable cases. Perhaps a child was about to run off a cliff because they weren't looking where they were running. A quick Imperio followed by a command to stop might be far more effective than any sort of warning. Even a precisely cast Cruciatus Curse could be welcome, if used by someone trusted on someone who enjoyed pain and wanted it in small doses.
Over their shoulders, each saw a sudden flare of golden red light. Narcissa let out a rich laugh because her husband was once again wide eyed and gobsmacked. She almost sounded like she was purring when she announced: “And now that you have fully decided that your Bond is Romantic rather than Platonic, and accepted it as what you both truly desire, the bond has activated to it's fullest. But as to that, I can't say a word. You'll have to figure it out on your own.”
The woman grinned at them becomingly. “This here is a weak lust potion. A single drop of it – which only costs a Galleon – makes you a little horny and in the mood to grope your dance partner. It's much the same as a few shots of Firewhiskey in that aspect, but it's quicker and doesn't make you drunk, so it's possible to actually dance all night if you want.”
the Slytherins – even if they didn't normally like them – it seemed easiest to start with them. So, as an unknown woman got on stage to croon a soulful song - “
Since Draco seemed too tired to do much more than moan and occasionally caress Harry in return, Harry decided to keep things simple. He pulled back just enough to conjure a bunch of oil into his hand, and then used it to wank both of their shafts together. This seemed exactly perfect to Draco at the moment, and he responded by holding onto Harry and kissing him.
The prospect had Draco sick to his stomach, and he couldn't eat even when given food. He wanted to just... curl up and go to sleep and never wake up. He wanted to... well...
Even so, between official meetings to discuss plans and lessons in both Occlumency and Legilimency from his aunt, Draco had a surprising amount of time on his hands. Between his frustration and boredom, he was tempted to write to Harry via their bond, but two things stopped him. One: He was still irate at Harry. And two: He absolutely did NOT want to risk anyone finding out about the bond and using it against him. Specifically the Dark Lord.
For so many reasons, Harry was rather depressed. So depressed that he'd just left the Hospital Wing because his friends had started talking about the shattered prophecy. He walked along the corridor leading away from it slowly, looking out the windows as he passed them by.
No one responded for a long pause, and then Ron nudged Harry, clearly dreading being forced to be first if no one volunteered. Harry was actually sort of used to being volunteered to do things like this – such as that time in Care of Magical Creatures which ended up with him riding Buckbeak. He sighed.
Now tempted to bite his nails, Draco had to remind himself to breathe. Slowly, he realized that he was digging his nails into his face. Also, his friends were giving him strange looks. To cover his blunder, he beckoned to the nearest snack seller and bought something for everyone in Slytherin.
Madam Pomfrey – who had somehow been immune to the curse – quickly scanned Harry and discovered that he had some sort of garbled curse on him that she couldn't untangle and get rid of. The best she could do was cast a spell to curb the effects of it on Ron and Hermione, and then promise to research ways to break the curse by the time he returned in the fall.. Needless to say, Harry was allowed to ride his broom with only Dumbledore as an escort back to Privet Drive that year.
When everything was said and done, the massive battle that ensued as the Sixth Year students closed in on the exit to the Maze got rather heated, and not exactly, erm... sporting. The flag changed hands so often that it was difficult to keep track of which House was winning. Even the students had trouble keeping track as often a student would accidentally steal it from one of their own Housemates.
Draco turned on them with a look like he was going to hex them both into oblivion. “NO HE DIDN'T HEX ME! HE'S A BLOODY CHEATER! KISSING PARVATI PATIL IN FRONT OF ***EVERYONE*** IN DIAGON ALLEY!!! I SHOULD BEAT HIM TO A BLOODY PULP AND THEN TURN HIM INTO AN INFERIUS SO THAT I CAN TORTURE HIM EVERY DAY FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE!”
Draco looked angrier than Harry had ever seen him. He felt a kind of detached satisfaction at the sight of the pale, pointed face contorted with rage.
Time seemed to stop as Draco and Harry's eyes met. Draco and his mother were standing there passively, both privately hoping this escape attempt succeeded even if it meant severe punishment for their family. Harry was concerned for the goblin and house elf he was holding onto, even so, as their eyes stared into each other for the briefest moment, they both seemed to be saying the same thing.
Harry felt a bit numb as Dumbledore eventually took over and got all the details out of Barty Crouch Jr. - who had been Polyjuicing into Professor Moody all year. Harry was allowed to recuperate in the Hospital Wing until it was time to return to the Dursleys. Especially once Ron and Hermione showed up to visit him and...
Draco felt a strange sensation, it was like something hot ripped through him, but at the same time, so much was going on with him not being able to breathe and blood gushing from him, that he couldn't really feel it. It just felt like something had pressed into his chest and was suffocating him. He fell to the water soaked floor and clutched his chest uselessly, trying to get it to work again.
Draco harrumphed and pulled Harry close for a nice long kiss. Sighing happily, Harry relaxed into it, deciding not to think about anything else at all for the rest of the night. Sensing that something was different, Draco decided to push his luck. He slowly slid a hand down Harry's chest, and this time, Harry let him unbuckle his belt.
“Come on, it can't be THAT bad, Malfoy. If you just want to be my friend, I can accept that. I think it might actually be time for us to put our differences aside and be friends.”
Hermione giggled. “I think it's a rare person with the confidence to swagger across a club and simply let a person know with a look that they're it for the night.”
Which meant that after his last DADA meeting right before school let out for the three week Christmas break, when Cho pointed out the mistletoe and then kissed him, Harry didn't feel any sort of guilt. In fact, he was more than half convinced that he and Draco had the other – NOT romantic – form of Soulmate Bond. Thus, there was nothing to feel guilty about.
“Draco...” Harry murmured softly, kissing the back of his neck. “I told you last night that I don't know what to think about ANY of this... I... All I can promise you is that I don't want to use you. I only have about 15 minutes each night when I get home before exhaustion overwhelms me and I pass out. And then on the weekends, I spend as much time with my friends and chosen family as possible. I don't know if I CAN date you... but... If you want to try it... If you want to take those 15 minutes I have each night and spend them kissing... If you want to hold me when I'm sleeping... I... I think I'd really like that...”
It was now Harry who looked rather thin and malnourished. In fact, dye his hair white-blond and give him a few extra inches of height, and he could be Draco from a year ago. Unbearably urged to comfort his Soulmate, Draco had to push away all tenderness and try to remain as emotionless as possible.
at Draco. To win one over on him by doing the same – or worse actually. Still... this was a bit embarrassing to do in
” And: “PLEASE!!!” The potion MUST be having an effect on him, because he was now a little fuzzy and actually WANTED to dance. He bounced in place as the line – that he and Ron were inadvertently standing in – slowly got shorter.
All of a sudden, Harry stood up on a bench and took a good look around the Great Hall. When he spotted Draco, he squared his shoulders and jumped off the bench so that he could march over. A hush fell again as people wondered if there was going to be one last bit of fighting after all.
Draco immediately looked contrite, even wincing sheepishly as he turned to Amanda – who he had almost forgotten about in his fervor to best Harry. “So sorry, luv! I didn't intend to make you feel badly.”
The first course was served and the first sips of the excellent wine were taken before Narcissa gave into the near glare her son was giving her. “Oh alright!” She turned to Harry and gave him a bright smile. “Harry, as we stated in our invitation, we invited you here tonight in order to settle our debts to you.”
