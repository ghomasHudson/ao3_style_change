Harry had decided that he wasn't too hungry anymore. He knew the break up with Ginny was the best for both of them, but he couldn't help feeling sad about it. It sort of feels like the end of an era. She was right though, they were just clinging on to something comfortable after dealing with all the loss that they had.
Well that was exhausting... how could he not have known that one of his closest friends had a crush on him? Blaise could do so much better than Draco... why in Merlin's name would he... well it just didn't make sense. He really hoped that he hadn't lost Blaise... he's lost so much already...
"Being an areshole is not a Slytherin trait." Blaise said, rising from his seat to meet Goyle in height. "In case you need to be reminded of them, Slytherins are ambitious, shrewd, cunning, strong leaders, and achievement-oriented. And, yes, we do tend to have highly developed senses of self-preservation. But, nowhere in the entire Wizarding World does it say that you're an arse if you're in Slytherin. That's a Goyle thing, I'm afraid." Blaise said.
"How do you-!?" He cut himself off from screaming too loud... "How do you know about Ginny and I?" He said again, quieter.
"As if we didn't know that." Pansy said, rolling her eyes.
"Hermione, I think I left my History of Magic book back in Sluggy's room." He kissed her on the cheek and ran off.
"Harry! Hello?" Hermione was waving her hand in front of his face. He flushed Gryffindor scarlet and looked up.
"Yep. Fine. I'm tired, please don't make out in here I'm going to bed. 'Night." He made his way towards his bed.
Let me know what you think and leave a Kudos if you want the next chapter!
"Draco." He looked up at Harry with a bit of ... was it fear?
"There is no 'apparently' about it, Potter. You were definitely very drunk." Draco gave him a soft smile.
"A bit... but...I don't mind it." And Draco pulled him in for a more passionate kiss. He pushed him against the wall and his mouth traveled down to his neck, sucking there to leave a purple hickey.
“Of course. Don’t be silly Potter. I wouldn’t do that to you.”
Knock, knock, knock.
"Am I off my rocker? Did my girlfriend just walk in with Draco Malfoy and sit with him? I imagined it, right?" Ron asked Harry.
"I'm sure we will only have to scrub her office or something. I can't see McGonagall making us do a bunch of hard labor." Harry said, putting his arm around Ron.
"Okay, okay! He showed me his memories and I saw what happened..."
"Oi! You two!" Ron and Hermione looked up from each other to Harry.
"Don't know to what you're referring to 'Mione." He said.
"That's something you're going to have to ask Draco..." Harry swallowed hard.
"Uh... it's been about 2 months. I was upset after breaking up with Harry, he comforted me, we kissed, I felt bad because Harry and I had just broken up, I cried, he comforted me again, then he officially asked me out and I said yes." Ginny thought for a moment, making sure she'd answered all the questions.
"Why so tense, Potter? Never seen two people kiss before?" Draco replied sneering.
Harry
"Oh, come on. 'The Savior' has nothing to say?" Pansy said with humor in her voice.
"Well, I suppose it's fairly new... but let me talk to him first, okay?"
"I don't think so. I think that's natural. You're not always going to fancy the same person forever, I mean, we're young. And you're not- I mean... your friend's not a bad person if they don't marry this girl... or guy." There was an awkward silence before Harry answered.
"Are Ron and Ginny still talking?" Harry asked her.
"... Yes..."
"What does that even mean?"
They left their 'make out room' and walked in to everyone hollering and cat calling. They just laughed and rolled their eyes.
"We're... friends." Draco said
"I know a charm that can add tattoos on your skin... and they move! Like this", she rolled up her sleeve to reveal a beautiful bird. It fluttered when she caressed her arm. It was incredible. "it won't be able to make the Dark Mark disappear... but I can make it prettier!" Luna said enthusiastically.
"I-uh-well... sometimes I like to walk around when I want to avoid people..."
"I just wanted to see you before we left... two weeks is a long time..." Harry was getting choked up. What more could he do to embarrass himself in front of Draco?
Blaise just looked at him, his face clearly saying,
Harry made his way downstairs and was immediately greeted by Hermione.
anyway, hope you enjoyed it! leave a kudos and a comment about what you'd like to see in the next chapter.
A few of the Slytherins looked shocked, some touched and some... well had no apparent facial expressions.
Draco nodded and Pansy started talking about whatever piece of gossip she had heard that morning.
"I want to be alone, 'Mione. Please, not now."
"It's simple really, Malfoy. You can't piss me off if you're asleep." Draco laughed.
"I know, it's a bit sudden. It's not like it's been going on long, obviously. She never cheated on Potter or anything but we sort of connected over a... shared...interest? I can't tell you all the details yet." He looked kind of troubled, as if he wanted to tell Draco but just... couldn't.
"What's going on, Harry?" Hermione started, "you've been acting strange all morning."
(See the end of the chapter for
They mustered enough cups for all the eighth years and filled them up.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco's face burned a bright red.
No, no, no. Draco was much more comfortable when he knew that it was never going to happen. He frankly didn't want to be around anyone anymore.
"I love you too." Harry responded, a grin so wide it almost split his face. "Do you think we should get going back to the castle?"
"I see you two are friends again." Hermione said walking into the common room.
"How long have we been together?" He joked, and kissed her on the cheek. Harry looked at them longingly...
"Yes, but you're just a huge ignoramus and you don't let anyone else talk."
Harry and Draco were still looking at each other and they both took a sip at the same time.
As he was leaving the common room, Granger and Weasley were entering.
"She's right you know. You are going to get hurt. Potter's a good bloke, but by what you're telling us he thinks it's a hook up. In your heart, it's not. So it's a lose-lose situation here Draco." Draco just looked at his best friend and sighed.
"I don't know... I-I'm I just came to meet Ron and 'Mione." Harry said.
"Spend a lot of time looking at
"Would you like me to kiss you again?" Blaise smirked.
"About... Ginny..." He stage whispered. Blaise's eyes almost popped out of his head.
"Uh-I-erm..." Harry looked so cute when he was disheveled.
"Formality, but I love you."
"So, are you ever going to tell me what's going on with you?" Ginny asked Harry while they were sitting outside.
"What's your deal, Malfoy?" He asked.
"You and Malfoy!" Ron whisper shouted.
"I don't... I don't have family..."
"Was he upset?"
"Harry?" He whipped around to see Ginny in a towel standing by the door of her bathroom.
"Oh my God, fine! 1 in 15, I guess."
"Oh, uh- sorry... go ahead."
"I understand. I really do. Your tattoo is beautiful."
"So... what is this then, a friends with benefits situation?" Draco asked him.
"Will you two just bloody shag already? I'm getting bored of this. Shag. Then we can all move on with our lives." Pansy and Blaise exchanged a look that said
(See the end of the chapter for
He went to Potions a good deal later than class started. He walked in and the class turned their attention from Slughorn to Harry.
"You don't think Ron actually cares do you? He was just caught off guard? Because he didn't really care when I told him about Draco and I thought he'd freak out." Harry asked her, concerned.
"There's rumors all over the school that you and Potter are a thing."
"You've always been incredible. By all rights you should hate him-hate me for loving him. He was terrible to you..."
"You guys really think I could do it?" Harry asked.
"Is this what growing up means?" Ron asked Harry. "How is this possible? It's us? We even beat 'Mione down here? Are we forgetting something?"
"I mean, I think it's pretty ridiculous but since McGonagall wants us to, I guess we have to," Gregory Goyle said as he was piling sausage into his mouth, "what do you think Draco?"
"I understand Headmistress McGonagall... but Draco? Ron? Blaise? They didn't do anything. It was all me. If you're going to punish anyone, punish me."
"I think I heard them over here. Harry loves it out here so it would... BLOODY FUCK-I OH MY GODS" The two kissing boys heard a voice that belonged to Ron and pulled apart as quickly as possible. Harry pulled his pants up and he and Draco stood up as casually as they could.
Blaise went up to the bar and Draco followed. He needed to talk to him about Ginny... maybe it wasn't the best plan, but he was too drunk to care.
Harry needed to find Draco. It was the only thing that would solve his memory issues and Hermione's strange behavior.
"Draco where are you-" he didn't hear anymore that Blaise said because the back of Potter's head was extremely hypnotic.
"Lying?" Pansy suggested. Draco gave her a look.
"It's not because maybe you...like someone else?" Draco's face heated up instantly and Pansy smirked at him. "You do!"
"I'm not letting you sit here and feel sorry for yourself," He put his hands on either side of Harry's head and was holding himself up above him, "Sorry, not happening. You're my brother and I love you and I'm sorry you're hurting but there will be other boys. Or whoever you want to date. There will be other people. I know it sucks, but you can't punish yourself." He got off Harry and pulled him up from the bed, so they were sitting side by side.
"You wanna explain to me what that was about?" Ron asked, slightly slurring his words.
"I'm good. See ya, Pans." He said.
"Well, for example, I'd say something like 'Harry, What Are The Odds that you'll kiss Hermione's armpit' and you would say 1 in 15, and then I would count down 3,2,1 and we would both say a number in that range of 15. If we say the same number you'd have to kiss Hermione's armpit, but if we don't you're in the clear. The highest range you can go is 15. The lowest is 5. Who's in?"
, he can't spend the rest of his life in there, but it's only been 2 days since he broke things off with Draco, give him a break.
"Do you really not know by now?" Harry breathed. His breath was hot on Draco's face and he was pretty sure that he was going to pass out from his need to kiss Harry.
his boyfriend... he didn't like Harry that way- it was just physical, that's all. And Harry was fine with it. He was totally and completely- positively,
"Are... hooking up..." Harry continued weakly. "Well. Whatever, you already know! I love him. I love him and I'm so stupid for it." Harry's head fell from Hermione's shoulder to her lap. He just continued to lay there while she quietly read to herself.
"Gin? You in there? I'm kind of worried about you. Gin?" No answer. "Ginny, seriously are you asleep still or something? Ginny!"
“I-I'm not..." Draco said weakly. " Just...Pans, we’ve been over this. If I tell him... that I feel...
... He thought.
"Yes, Gr-Hermione?" He felt rather odd saying that but sort of happy when he saw Hermione genuinely smile up at him.
"I-uh... forgot my...quill in the potions classroom... I'll catch up later, yeah?"
"Sorry... sorry... I just...you thought I liked the waitress? Draco, I can assure you there's only one blonde that I'm interested in and he's not a bimbo." Harry looked slightly shocked at himself after he said that but stood confidently.
"No, Malfoy!," Ah, the blush Draco had been waiting for. "Gods, I'm sorry I didn't know what you were doing... I saw you walk here and I didn't-"
"Blaise... uh... I know." Draco said, lamely. Blaise looked at him confused.
"Yeah, we never thought you'd be the one to deflower The Chosen One!" Dean said, laughing.
wow special thanks to one of my super amazing and beautiful friends, Alexa, for editing this chapter for me because it was a mess. so, you can thank her for the correct grammar and wording. love you Alexa!!! <3
"Right... but I wanted to talk to you about Draco." Harry's heart fell into his stomach. Had Ron told her?
"So what's up mate? What did Bill want?" Ron asked as Harry sat down next to him.
"I'd check her dorm if I were you."
"Well, I do." and he pulled her in for an intimate kiss.
Draco couldn't argue anymore as he was pulled towards the common room.
"What about Blaise here?" Draco asked, averting the subject from himself. "Got anyone special?" He smirked.
"Hermione's right. I mean, just think of everything you did with the DA in fifth year! You were basically a professor right then and there. Have a bit of faith in yourself, mate." Ron added.
"You have the fucking nerve to tell me I'm not being a good friend!? Fuck you, Malfoy! I mean, how dare you! I have spent all bloody day hearing about your," she lowered her voice a bit for the next few words, bless her, "goddamn love for Harry Fucking Potter. And I did not complain once, and you say that!?" People had started to stare, but Pansy didn't care. "You don't even know anything that's going on in my life because you don't even care to ask! You wouldn't know if I was seeing someone, if I got a good grade in potions or if I bloody sucked Slughorn's cock! Why? Because nothing that I do would ever compare to the Great Draco Malfoy! Well, you know what? I'm sick of this pity party and I'm sick of you right now. Find me when you're done being a git!" And she stormed out of the common room, passing right by Blaise with a, "Don't follow me!"
"And by normal, we mean embarrassingly goo-goo over Potter again." Pansy said, smirking. "So, Weasley. When do we start?"
"Did you catch that?" Pansy asked her friends as she was attempting to move Draco to the bench by the Great Hall.
Once Harry got to the Gryffidor common room he saw Parvati sitting scribbling something down on some parchment.
"As soon as possible. Tomorrow evening?"
"Ha! Your rescue... man I guess I do have an annoying hero complex, huh?" Harry laughed.
(See the end of the chapter for
"We need to talk." Harry said, seriously.
"Dang, first question and already friendships are getting ruined." Pansy laughed a little. "I'll go next. Never Have I Ever... thought about anyone in this room while I was.. you know..." She wiggled her eyebrows suggestively. Everyone groaned at the fact that Pansy wasn't able to just say what she meant, but they all got it.
"Well it's not like you want an actual relationship, right? Just a fool around?" Harry asked him.
"Well... look... don't uh-don't tell anyone or anything but I well...."
They strategically sat away from Potter so that Draco could talk about him.
"It's his little sister Harry. I'm sure he will get on board eventually."
"What's up, Draco?" Harry asked when they were alone. Draco didn't really know what to say, so he grabbed Harry by the waist and kissed him softly. "Thank you... for... coming to my rescue." Draco said, blushing even more furiously.
"About each other...?" Harry started, mostly to himself. Then bolded by Draco's reaction, he stepped forward and caressed his cheek. "You're-you... you're crazy about me?" Harry asked, soft, almost scared to ruin this moment by speaking too loudly.
"Soon. I told him I want to tell Harry and Ron before we 'publicly' announce it."
Yet again I would like to thank my friend Alexa for editing this for me!!! Love you!! <3
"Did you guys hear me? Weasley and Harry broke up!" All Draco was asking for was a little more emotion. He expected Pansy to be jumping up and down with him.
"McGonagall is evil for making us get up this early on a Sunday! It's like torture or something!" Ron said.
Hermione kissed Ron and then headed up to her dorm. Draco was about to go to his room when Ron stepped in front of him.
"Ok, so are you in or what?" Ron asked.
"Hi. Wanna sit?" Draco said, patting the seat next to him on the couch. Harry accepted the invitation and sat down next to him. There was comfortable silence until Harry said,
"Draco Malfoy, Harry's boyfriend. Much better, you're right." Draco said, and Harry leaned in to kiss him.
"Harry, it's just a game, it's not like you'd be cheating on her."
... it changes everything. It ruins everything. After we leave Hogwarts, I’ll be heartbroken and cry for a few months and I’ll be fine.” Draco said. It was only partly a lie. Mainly because he knew there’d be no getting over Harry. How can anyone even come close?
"That's weird... I'm kind of worried about her."
"I wasn't planning on it, Ron. I know how it feels to be outed. I would never do that to anyone. You have nothing to worry about; Harry's life is his own."
When Susan and Pansy said the same number Harry's heart dropped and he couldn't have told you why.
"There's a card." He started, picking it up and opening it. "So you two can stop being twats," he read, "we set this up for you. You're welcome, by the way. Also, get your heads out of your arses, you're both crazy about each other." Draco finished reading with a slight blush to his cheeks.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Eh, not too great actually. Ginny... just broke up... with me..." Draco perked up.
"How do you know? I mean, really? What kind of indications have you gotten from him? He  continues to hook up with you, he thinks you're attractive and he wears your hickeys like trophies! That sounds to me as if he
Wait a second... what in the...
"Draco." Harry said, simply.
"McGonagall's office... the pensieve. I'll just show you the memory." Harry took a sharp inhale of breath. He thought he might die of embarrassment because he knew that Draco was about to show him was going to be
this morning. He swallowed hard.
"Yes, what? Oh... Blaise. Hey. Hi. How uh-how are you doing?" Blaise laughed.
Harry sighed, she made a good point. He really wasn't a huge fan of this idea, but...."Okay, what the hell. Let's get some cups."
- fine with it... if anyone asked. He headed to his dorm where he'd hoped Ron would be- luckily he could kill two birds with one stone since Hermione was in there as well. Also luckily- they weren't making out like last time he walked in on them, they were just studying.
They practically ran to the Eighth Year common room and when they got in there pretty much everyone, minus a few, were there waiting to leave.
Draco
"Fine, fine. Tell me in your own time." She sighed dramatically.
"I just do. Life balances itself out. Something incredible will come from this heartbreak, I just know it." Draco didn't know what to say to that, so he just hugged Blaise tighter until they both fell asleep like that, in each other's arms.
"And you lot dare to call yourselves Slytherins." Greg scoffed.
"I think we have completely different feelings for each other and I don’t want either of us to get hurt and this is killing me but I have thought a lot about it and I think it’s in the best interest for both of us if we end this now.” Harry said in one breath.
"We are all," he gestured in the direction of where he just left, "going to Hogsmeade tonight. And, it wouldn't be a proper outing without all of our friends, now would it Pansy?"
"Sorry... But I'm sure Draco can survive a little bit without your lips." Harry chuckled and then Blaise just smirked at him.
Blaise shot up from his seat and about jumped over the table to attack Goyle. What Blaise didn't see was Harry Potter doing the same exact thing. The next thing Goyle knew Harry 'Hero' Potter was punching Greg in the face. Goyle punched back, and that's when Ron showed up holding Harry back as Harry punched him again, with all his might, hitting Goyle hard enough to knock him out.
Harry looked at the two of them incredulously, "And when did this pot smoking take place that I didn't know about?" Hermione looked sort of guilty, but Harry was only kidding, really.
"Yes, of course... just an unlikely pair." Harry joked. "It's not a problem, right Ron?" Harry kneed him.
"Thanks guys... that means a lot to me. I'm going to go tell Gin, she actually mentioned that she thought I'd be a good professor... she'll get a good laugh at being right." He laughed and wandered off to find Ginny.
Hermione and Ron made their way to the common room to wait for Harry and about 30 minutes later they heard the door open and it was him.
He looked at the clock hanging on the wall. Only 2 minutes had passed.
"Blaise and I never dated... but yes I agree that it's utterly crazy."
"See you tonight, Malfoy. Midnight." And Harry left. Draco just stood there in utter confusion.
"Make out...face?"
"Ow! You're right that does hurt. So, do we look mischievous enough?"
"Anytime, I'll be here for you- uh you know, if you want me to."
"You've seen the Dark Lord, right? Been in his presence?"
"I would love to give you the full run down, but if you don't find Ron and explain, he may die of a stroke." Harry laughed.
The next morning Draco was talking to Pansy about
"Right, have some
His lips were amazing. He had never been kissed like that. Ginny was a great kisser, but there was something about Draco's kiss that still had his lips tingling. He had kissed one other boy, Seamus. It was before him and Dean got together and Harry was confused and drunk and Seamus was confused and drunk and well... put two and two together. He just could not stop thinking about goddamn Draco Malfoy.
Draco
, look. "Guys, Ginny is still one of my closest friends. I love her. Just because we didn't work out doesn't mean we aren't cool with each other." Everyone seemed satisfied with that answer and went back to talking about what they would do in Hogsmeade. Luckily there were many Hufflepuffs and Ravenclaws already sitting by them so they heard about the outing as well.
"Harry... You- I mean... do you not remember what happened last night?" She looked at him distraughtly.
"What can we do for you Longbottom?" Pansy asked.
"Everything's...just a bit fuzzy..."
"Harry didn't tell me, Draco. You did. Just now." Luna said, like it was the simplest thing in the world.
"Well, that's what you want right? Just do it."
. Draco thought.
"C'mon! I was only kidding!" And he pulled her down on the bed.
"I just wanted to check on you, you seemed off after class..."
"Uh, I actually haven't seen her this morning and I got up pretty much before everyone." She replied, curiously.
"Okay- Okay, I'm up. Give me 15 minutes and we'll head to McGonagall's classroom."
"Oh... is- is that so?" Harry struggled to get the words out with the sudden attack on his neck.
"Tell you that you liked Potter? I thought you knew... I was waiting for you to tell me!"
"You see, for about a year and a half the Dark Lord lived at my house. Meaning he was there every day. He tortured people in front of my eyes and if I made an effort to stop he would kill my mother and then me... so sure, everyone has a choice. And I made the choice to protect my mother. I got this," Draco pulled up his sleeve to reveal the Dark Mark, "so my mother wouldn't die, so that I wouldn't die." He rolled his sleeve down and gripped the Firewhiskey from Ron and took a long swig.
"Just curious, is all..."
"We couldn't! It's your turn, Harry."
After all the 8th years were gathered, Hermione stood up and announced herself.
"Goodnight, Hermione."
"Are you dense? He has a girlfriend and he-"
"I'm just... sorry. This is so embarrassing." Draco put his face in his hands. "I guess I just can't believe this is actually happening." He said, a bit muffled by his hands. Harry grabbed his hands and took them in his, causing Draco to look up at him.
Hermione cut him off. "Ron!" He looked up at her, shocked. "Draco, Pansy and a good amount of Slytherins ended up coming to help us during the battle. And for those who didn't... some of the Death Eaters were their parents, families, Ron! How would you feel going up against your family in war."
"I can't think about this right now... let's just go meet the lads, yeah?"
"You really are so amazing. I'm sorry Ginny, I really am."
"It definitely feels right at this exact moment..."
"Oh...?"
"Having Potions first thing in the morning is like a crime, don't ya think?" Ron asked him. Harry thought about it. A few months ago he wouldn't have said
"Did you just see Potter or something... you seem distracted?" He smirked. "'Course you did. Just checking on you. Haven't seen you too much lately and you practically ran out of potions with the Gryffindors." Blaise smiled cheekily.
"McGonagall wants to meet with me?" Draco was surprised. He didn't think McGonagall would want him involved, of all people.
"What the bloody hell are you going on about? A rose? We're talking about Harry and Malfoy here!" Ginny said
"HARRY! It's fine, really. I understand."
... but a risky game to play.
"Pansy- the first night... when he... you know-"
The room was nothing extravagant, it looked like a bedroom. Draco made his way to the bed and Harry suddenly felt very weird being here. He made his way to the door but, predictably, he stumbled and fell to ground- the invisibility cloak falling off of him as well.
"Harry, I get it, but you have to leave this room. You can't spend the rest of your life in here." Ron had a point. But on the other hand, Harry could be very happy here. The house elves could bring him food, he has clothes, a bathroom... why not live here? Hogwarts was the only place that ever really felt like home anyways besides the Weasley's.
Just as Harry was leaning in to kiss him, someone entered the washroom and the two boys pulled apart quickly.
"Yep." Pansy looked pretty pleased with her eavesdropping skills. Draco however felt like he was going to upchuck all over his friend. This was all way too much to take in right now. First, he finally admits that he likes... Potter... and now there's that slight chance that, if he ever broke up with Ginny... not likely considering they're in love... that he had a shot.
Draco looked up. He couldn't talk to one of Harry's best friends about this... no way...
"I don't have much to go by... but you're... I... you're just..." Draco tried but couldn't get the words out.
"You're dating Zabini!? Why are two of the most important people in my life falling for Slytherins!?" He turned and walked inside, leaving them looking at each other.
Ron looked surprised but then stepped out of the way. "Good. Glad we're on the same page then."
Draco looked at him for a moment, just staring at Harry. He was taking in all of his features. His strong jawbone and wild mess of black hair...some strands were sticking up and some fell in his face but he still managed to look fucking perfect...Harry cleared his throat awkwardly and Draco realized he must have been staring. He blushed but it was barley noticeable, and he tried to remain cool and collected.
"I can completely understand if you want to break up with me because of that kiss, but it was just a dare type of thing! I swear! They aren't true and-!"
But, I guess after dinner Blaise didn't care anymore.
"Not everyone else, some people yes. But not your friends... your family."
"I mean, for someone so intelligent... you don't know? You can't tell? I'm- I'm mad for you, Draco." Harry said, looking down embarrassedly. Draco lifted Harry's chin up so he was now looking in his eyes.
"I can help you with that if you want." Luna said simply. So much for her not seeing it. Still, Draco was curious as to what she meant.
"I'm sure you'll find out soon anyway... Here, I'll mess you up now." Blaise did the same thing Harry did.
Of course, it had to be Harry. Of all the 8th years it had to be him. Harry looked at him as he was walking and all Draco could do was wave awkwardly and blush.
"Well, took you long enough to tell us." Blaise said.
"Apologize for ya know... everything."
"I don't! I know that you would support me if I decided I wanted to-... call him 'Draco'... I just... was being a prat and I'm sorry." They both knew this was one of those situations where they were saying one thing but talking about something completely different.
since it was evidently obvious as to
They made their way to the Hogs Head and ordered their drinks. They were all talking and getting along wonderfully, which is surprising... because since when had anyone ever seen a group of Gryffindors and Slytherins getting along?
"I don't know! He- he treats me like I'm-like I'm... I don't know... like I'm not broken..." This is such a hard conversation to have while drunk, Harry decided.
"What?"
"What Are The Odds that you'll kiss that person?"
They stayed like that for a few seconds until they heard someone clear their throat. He then heard Pansy's voice, "Uh... sorry to interrupt... but..."
"Sorry," Blaise started, embarrassed, "but you have no idea how long I have wanted to do that." Draco blushed and just sort of stared at him.
"I would say pretty well considering I heard Granger and Weasley talking not so quietly about how 'I wish Harry wasn't bloody dating...' uh ... what's her name? Jenny?"
"All right, mate. No need to bite my head off, I'm your friend here." Ron said, holding his hands up.
"All right, I'm sorry but I'm coming in." and Harry opened the door and Ginny was not on her bed.
"Well... we tried to deny them, of course, but there were already so many crazy things being said... people didn't really believe us." Blaise said, awkwardly. Blaise is a pretty go with the flow person and takes a lot to make him feel uncomfortable... but I suppose it would be weird hearing stories about a guy who you have a crush on with some guy he has a crush on. ...And now Draco was hating himself again for the whole 'Blaise' situation.
Ron looked at her. At this beautiful, intelligent, brave woman staring at him like he was everything. Telling
After a few awkward seconds, Ginny said, "So... Malfoy? Right? That's who Ron was talking about..." Harry stared at her for a moment and then looked down.
This is now part 3, and the final part, of The Bonding Thing! It's a fairly short chapter but I wanted to finish this part of the story up!
"Just do it, Draco. I mean what are the odds you say the same number."
"Uh, right. Well, that doesn't explain why you followed me in here." Draco started again.
Now, Harry would tell you that it is very hard to shock him. After all, he spent most of his childhood in a war so there was really nothing that anyone could do to surprise him at this point. Or, so he thought.
"Alright, dueling stances you two. Good Miss Parkinson, good! Yes, Ron! Good hit, Pansy. Control your wand Mr. Weasley. Don't second guess yourselves." It went on for a few more minutes and then Ron hit Pansy with a 'Stupefy' and won.
"Fine," Draco laughed, "
"Are...?" Hermione asked, smirk present.
"Do you actually care, or is it just a formality?" She asked, smiling.
"You are way too intelligent to be so stupid Harry Potter." Hermione said.
"Oh, I'm sure I can." Harry said smirking. They kissed again for a long time and it was beginning to get heated. Harry began to pull away, kissing Draco's lips softly twice before totally pulling back.
"Duh, it was obvious. What did you say after he told you?"
"Shove off, Zabini" was all Harry could say as he tried to figure out if Blaise could see the blush that he felt blossoming on his cheeks.
also... i know this chapter is really short :/ but i wanted to get the "break up" out of the way so that i can move onto happier things (:
"Save it, Malfoy. I get it. We're attracted to each other; it'd be a shame to waste it just because we don't have feelings for each other, right?" Harry said, bluntly. Draco was stunned, and... hurt. Harry really didn't have feelings for him at all? He just wanted to shag?
"Too right, you are." She said. "I can't believe you said I wasn't a good friend. I listened to your shit all day."
"Very much so. I mean you know I was a virgin before you."
"No! I would have punched Goyle if Harry hadn't." Blaise said.
"I would wait for him to come to you. He's obviously confused. And even though he said that to Blaise, he does still have a girlfriend."
"'Mione, it's okay. I'll be perfectly fine. I promise. But, we should head out. We could probably make the first round of breakfast for once." Harry said, picking up his bag and heading out the common room door. He really was fine, surprisingly. He was too happy for his friends to worry about being alone at the Weasley's... but he wouldn't be alone. He has Ginny... and well, all of them really. His family.
"Yeah, but he flipped a switch! He went from calling him 'Malfoy' and hating him to having a crush on him and calling him 'Draco'. Weird!"
"Oh... I see." They stood there staring at each other awkwardly.
he didn't know how to say... but goodbye was the prominent one at the moment. He made eye contact with him and pointed towards the doors.
"I-... Gods. Okay. Let's eat then."
As he was walking up towards the room he realized that if Draco is already using the room...would he be allowed to come in? Maybe if he told the room that he
"Always, Gin. You know that."
"Go on, we'll catch up." Draco said, ignoring the blush blooming on his cheeks.
"I sort of didn't need to say anything... he could tell that I didn't feel the same way..."
Draco grabbed the bottle and took a sip. "I'll start. Something that bothers me is that I am being blamed for things that people from the other houses don't understand." He made a point to try and not look at Ron, but he glanced over and made eye contact with him, which infuriated Ron.
A door emerged from the wall and Harry sneaked in behind him before the door closed.
"Oh-yeah, no of course... not a problem..."
"Nothing to spill. Essentially what Pansy said. That's it. Nothing else. He doesn't want an actual relationship." Draco said.
(See the end of the chapter for
"They broke up!" As he said this he was almost completely out of breath so it came out more like "Thhh...eeee...eeyyyyy ..... brrrr-oooke..... u-up...." He had his hands on his knees trying to control his breathing.
"HARRY POT-" Draco flew his hand over her mouth and quickly looked around the room to make sure no one was around to hear Pansy's outburst.
once again... they are stupid boys
When the applause died down Harry said "Thank you, Draco... that was-that meant... just, thank you." Draco gave him a smile because he knew if he spoke he would sound very choked up.
"You see Mister Potter? Your friends were trying to be just as violent as you, hm? Anyway, you all will get started on your detention tomorrow. 7 a.m. in my classroom." Once Draco had time to think without being reprimanded, he remembered that they leave for holiday on Monday.
"What sounds good?" Ron asked as he and Hermione took their seats at the table.
"It's not like you don't want to be with Potter..." Pansy said ignorantly.
"Took you two long enough, what caused your late arrival?" Blaise asked, smirking.
"Friends." Draco finished, accidently looking directly at Harry. He has been 'accidently' looking at Harry a bit too much lately.
"Uh, nope. I think you you lot covered it." He did a little fake cough to hide the fact that his voice was stuttering a bit.
She also got a rendition of
"That sounds fine to me." Ron said. "I love me a good meal and some good alcohol."
Draco Malfoy he was- well... it was very...
"Hermione!" Draco called.
The scene started faded and Harry pulled his head out and looked up at Draco. "I- I'm so sorry... that's so horrible and embarrassing. I can't believe I said that to Ron and... to just... kiss you like that without your consent... I-I'm so sorry."
"Thanks, Ron." Harry said, gratefully accepting his best friends gift. "Since when are you so worried about being late to Slughorn's class?" He asked, hopping out of bed.
"Don't take this the wrong way but... how did this happen? You just confessed to me the other week about your feelings... well I guess it's been about a month or so... but you know what I mean. And now you are hooking up with Ginny Weasley? I'm not mad... just confused and worried for you..." Draco trailed off.
"Potter, Malfoy. May I ask what this intrusion is about?" McGonagall asked calmly.
"Uh right, yes I'm sure, Draco. Your eye is clean...and free of...things..." Harry mentally punched himself  for his inability to remain cool and collected like Draco.
"Oh gods, you started this Pansy just remember." Draco said.
"Everyone looks at me with these sad eyes... like they feel sorry for me. And, I understand why... but I hate it. Draco just- he just... looks at me. And the way he looks at me... I don't have words for how it makes me feel. I don't, okay? I can't put into words, why him, but... I really like him, Ron... I-I'm sorry. It's just how I feel." Ron was quiet for a long time just staring at Harry.
"You mean he didn't tell you?" Harry asked.
"Then I guess I haven't made it as painfully obvious as I thought I had," He chuckled,"... but I like you... and I have for a-a while and-and when you came out to all of us the other week... I don't know I just r-really wanted to know what i-it would be like to k-ki-kiss you." Blaise stuttered.
"Sorry, love. I woke up late. Couldn't sleep last night and then had a right awful nightmare when I finally did." She leaned into the hug and nuzzled her head into Harry's neck. "I missed you."
"But why would-" Draco was cut off by Ron gripping him and Draco on the back and ushering them back to the booth.
"Why not?" Luna said simply. "Do you have other people you would like to sit by you other than me?" She added. She wasn't being rude, Draco could tell. It was a genuine question and...
"Anything you want!"
“Draco, c’mon you’re killing yourself. Don’t you realize that the longer you let this go on without being honest the worse you’ll get hurt?” There was a look of desperation in Pansy’s eyes. Perhaps
All of a sudden it hit Draco like a smack in the face. No way, Draco thought, he's dating a Gryffindor? It would explain why he's being so secretive about it, especially if he or she is younger.
hope you enjoyed! next chapter won't be up for a few days, still working on it! leave a kudos and a comment!
He thought to himself. Ah! The Quidditch pitch!
"Pansy!" Draco exclaimed.
"Shut it, you know what way...
"Hmm? Friends? Never heard of them..." He kissed Harry again. They rubbed together to create unbelievable friction and Draco was on fire with want. He wanted Harry and that thought excited him and terrified him at the same time.
He's drunk
"I-uh... I sort of followed you the other night and saw you... please don't be mad. I just knew you were keeping something from me." Draco slurred. He was too drunk for this.
"Mister Malfoy... I am well aware when holidays start in my own school." She said, a certain look in her eyes. "I will see you boys tomorrow morning." She walked into the infirmary with a swish of her cloak.
And, it's not like Draco doesn't enjoy the company. To be frank, he likes it a lot. He likes that Luna just sits there in silence and she doesn't ask any questions and just lets him be. But, why? Because Longbottom and all of her friends are home for the Holidays? Because she feels sorry for Draco? He decided to finally ask on a random Tuesday during lunch.
"Ok, ok... sorry. I just don't know what to say."
anywho enjoy!
After that whole ordeal the day went on fairly normal up until after dinner. Harry didn't particularly want to see anyone and not for any reason just because he felt like being alone. He went up the his dorm grabbed the cloak and Marauder's map and went on his way.
"No one is as shocked as we are babe." Ron said. "So we're staying at mine for week one and yours for week two- right?" Ron asked her.
"I-just... I'm not feeling well."
"And... that's my cue to go have a pint with Seamus and Dean. Meet up with us later, yeah?" Ron asked them both.
Blaise spoke, "I'll go. Never Have I Ever ... smoked pot." A good amount of people took drinks, including Ron and Hermione!
already know," he pointed to Hermione, "but... I'm sort of seeing Draco? It's not serious and we are just um... well, you know- hooking up. No relationship- he doesn't like me that way... but yeah." Harry looked up from, the very interesting, ground to see Ron and Hermione's faces. Hermione was smiling to herself and Ron had an unreadable expression.
"Nope, I saw it with my own eyes."
"Don't be. So... who is it?" Harry froze.
"Wake up Malfoy- detention." Blaise said in Draco's ear at the ungodly hour of 6:30 a.m.
ok so some characters stayed at hogwarts for winter holidays and draco is one of them. that's all, enjoy(: --- (also i completely make up a spell... ok now that's all!)
"How about giving me some flowers then?"
"What... why!?" Draco was more confused than he had every been.
"I can't tell him that I want
"I mean I think he about had an aneurysm trying to figure out how it's possible... but yeah... overall he just wants me to be happy and you make me happy." Harry froze. How could he be so stupid to say that right to his face... how humiliating.
"I'm fine. I just don't think this bonding thing is such a bad idea. Everyone is aware of each other's existence but we're all just tip-toeing around one another. Maybe if we-" Suddenly Draco wasn't talking anymore and Blaise's mouth was on his and he didn't even have time to protest since Blaise sort of shoved him onto the bench that was next to him.
Draco looked up from his Firewhiskey and looked at Seamus. "Nothing... why do you ask."
"No, of course not." Hermione answered and finished eating her sandwich.
from the relationship! He clearly doesn't feel the same way! It would ruin everything!" Draco about screamed.
"Harry and Draco are together." She said simply. Ron rolled his eyes.
"For my sake, definitely a good thing. I-You're-I mean..."
Draco was finding this all rather annoying. So it was obvious to Blaise and Pansy, and probably Goyle that he was bloody infatuated with Potter but nobody thought to tell him!? How rude.
"What's going on, Harry? You've been distracted a lot lately." Hermione asked, concerned.
He realized that was the first dreamless sleep he had in a long time.
"How about... just Harry."
"Malfoy! They're just kidding. Harry's a right awful liar. Could have never fooled us." Draco still looked unsure but kept eating his toast despite that. Ginny walked in the Great hall and about 10 seconds later Blaise did. Really discreet guys, Draco mocked in his head. Although, if they walked in snogging he wasn't sure too many people would grasp it even then.
"Yeah..."
"Harry, you don't give yourself enough credit. You are excellent in Defense. Yes, when you were battling Voldemort you didn't use advanced spells and hit him where it hurt... but, you pick up defense spells quicker than anyone I know. You created a Corporeal Patronus when you were 13 for crying out loud. Sure, you have some things you need to learn... but McGonagall wouldn't have asked you to do this if she didn't think you could." Hermione said.
Harry laughed a little and waved back. "Hey there."
. Harry heard the door open and footsteps.
"Oh, dear. You've got it bad... don't you, Mr. Potter?" Harry blushed, then scowled at Madame Pomfrey.
He looked up at Draco with a look of sad understanding. "You, uh- you don't like me.. that way. Right?" Blaise looked down at his lap.
remember they are just friends obviously like just friends. only friends.
She smiled at him. "See you." She turned to walk upstairs.
And, that worked! The room opened up and there Draco was, sleeping on the bed.
"You okay, mate," Greg asked, "you look like you've seen a ghost, and well, you ran off earlier."
Draco
"Hey... can I speak to you two about something?" Harry asked, fidgeting with his hands. Hermione looked up, putting on a confused face, but lightly smirking.
"Good job Draco, real know-it-all, you are." Blaise laughed.
"Mr. Potter? Is everything alright?" Madame Pomfrey asked.
hah they are sooooooooooooooooooooo (not) just friends
"-and he told me he liked me... like... like..... well you know has a crush on me and-"
"'What's in a name? That which we call a rose, by any other word would smell as sweet'..." Hermione said... sort of laughing to herself.
"Whatever about, Harry?" She said, smirk very evident in her feign smile.
Pansy and Draco locked eyes with each other while everyone did collective "Ooh"s.
Harry wasn't exactly sure why he felt so weird about it, especially considering that those were two people he thought he couldn't care less about. I mean it's not like he had a crush on either of them. Sure, Blaise had good features, a strong jaw-line, and was perfectly handsome. Draco has those prying grey eyes and thick blonde hair... and his lips were very plump and firm looking... it intrigued Harry, for a sum total of 7 seconds, what it would be like to kiss Draco Malfoy, until he laughed at himself for thinking such a ridiculous thought.
Three hours, 25 drinks and a few shots later everyone, yes including Hermione, were fairly drunk. Not tripping over themselves, can't talk or see straight drunk... but drunk nonetheless.
"None of your bloody business, Potter!" he snapped.
did i mention they're JUST friends????
"It's so weird that Harry likes him so much, considering their rivalry and hatred since they met."
Wait- did he just call Malfoy- Draco? That was significantly weird.
"Harry it's-"
Ron cleared his throat. "Right... well... anyway..." And they didn't say much as they made their way to the common room.
"Gin! What is it? You can tell me anything? I could never hate you or judge you."
, Draco thought.
Feeling content with his apology he decided it was time to head up to the Room of Requirement. He had taken it to sleeping there almost every night to save his roommates from the screams of his nightmares. Ever since Voldemort had taken it upon himself to stay at Malfoy Manor, Draco had nightmares of the horrible gruesome things he witnessed. After the war, one of the worst nightmares is hearing that Harry was dead, everyone's only shot at beating the Dark Lord, and in his nightmares Harry didn't wake up.
"We never stopped, don't be so dramatic 'Mione." Ron said getting up to kiss her on the cheek.
He looked questionly at Ron who gave him a nod of approval and then agreed. They started down to the Great Hall and Draco realized he hadn't even changed his clothes, how embarrassing! At least he was too tired to care too much.
"Well... how did they explain to you how your parents died without telling you that you're a wizard? I mean... every child in the Wizarding World knew your story before they could talk."
"Nice hickeys, Potter." Blaise said. Draco was tempted to turn around and slap Blaise but again, that would be obvious...
He perked up at the sound of his name, he hadn't really been paying attention. No, he was busy watching Harry Potter, but of course he would never admit to that.
"Uh... class is over, mate." Ron told him.
"C'mon Bill! You always pick me!" Ron yelled.
Potions came along and for once, Harry wasn't dreading it completely. Sure, he still was terrible at it, but he knew he'd see Draco... and for some reason that was comforting instead of the past annoyance. To be honest, he's been avoiding Draco for these past few weeks. Maybe not avoiding... but definitely not looking for him. It was time for him to just face his fears, I mean that's what Gryffindors do, right?
"Then why did you break it off with me?" Draco asked desperately. "Why did you- you said we had different feelings for each other... I-."
Harry showed up promptly, sitting in his usual spot. Ron was close behind and sat next to him. He and Ron couldn't believe their eyes when Draco and Hermione walked in together, laughing and smiling.
"C'mon 'Boy Who Lived', we want to hear about something that bothers you." Blaise smirked.
"If that's how you feel talk to him about it! I'm bloody sick of hearing you whinge." Pansy yelled.
So, Draco kind of wanted to talk to Pansy without Millicent there... but he was trying this whole 'nice guy' thing out, so he couldn't just send her off like he would have in the past.
He walked out of the Great Hall and started heading towards the Gryffidor common room, maybe she was just running a little late. He went around the bend and stopped dead in his tracks.
Draco silently begged Blaise not to say anything, but he should have known better. "Spend a lot of time looking at Draco's neck, do you?" Blaise, why why why did you have to respond. All Draco wanted to do was crawl in a hole and die.
"Filch... uh he... yeah we saw Filch and went around a different way. Took way longer." Harry said.
some misunderstandings occur
"Hey, Parvati. Seen Ginny anywhere?"
"Oh, I'm sure 'The Chosen One', Mr. Famous, can afford to miss class..."
For now at least.
"Dinner sounds good. Shall we?" He asked, standing up and offering his arm.
"But, if you like him... you have to
"I mean it's a little crazy... but it makes sense. I think he'll be brilliant." Ginny said when she and Hermione were talking later that night. "When Harry told me I was glad. It seems like we are starting to be friends again... like before we started dating. It's been weird for a while, as expected, but we've taken time apart and I think we can start renewing our friendship."
"Good... I'm, uh, glad we can agree on something. You were, most definitely, a prat." Harry smiled a big smile and he and Ron just fell into their normal steps, talking about nothing and everything. He was finally starting to feel like himself again. There was just one more problem... what the hell is he going to do about Draco?
"I already told you it's no one! I just ... I'm-"
"I don't know just yet... I know I really like her- uh..."
"Alright, everyone knows how to play, right?" Seamus started. "Someone says 'Never Have I Ever... blah blah blah... and if you have done it, you have to drink." Everyone collectively nodded, understanding the simple rules of this... dangerous game.
"Draco- mmm, seriously... we need... we have to, oh!" Harry tried, but he wanted to stay there as much as Draco did.
"Thank you... I agree. It's very nice." Hermione said.
"Harry... I- what is all this?" Draco asked, seemingly as confused as him. A small, stupid, part of him had hoped that when he saw Draco walk in that it was he who planned it,
Draco was confused as to why Ron looked so horrified but then realized that he wasn't supposed to know that Harry was bisexual and placed a fake surprised look on his face. Although, he wasn't positive about Harry's sexuality so it's nice to have it confirmed. Hermione gave Draco a knowing look and then nudged him on the arm.
"Wow... cutting right to the chase, are we? I-I... I don't know... I think I really like him."
"You're right. I will get it out of you eventually... I... I love you, Harry. Thanks for being a friend."
Draco was ready for this ruddy day to just be over already. He skipped lunch, not really wanting to deal with anyone and when classes were done made his way to the 8th year common room. He saw Pansy sitting on the couch talking to Millicent Bulstrode about something he probably wouldn't have any interest in.
"So Harry," Seamus started, "have a morning snog with Ginny?" The Gryffindors chuckled and awaited Harry's response.
"He said that?"
"We're not sure. He's been off for a few weeks..." Hermione gave him a look that said I know exactly what's wrong but I think Ron's head would explode if he knew.
Harry
"What's up, mate?" Ron replied, a bit confused by Harry's outburst.
Luna, as if reading Draco's mind, said "I am friends with the kitchen Elves. I'm sure they would make us some dinner if we missed it", taking a seat next to him she picked up a clover from the grass and began picking off the leaves.
"Well, why didn't you tell me!?"
Hermione said something and Draco looked unsure, but then followed Hermione to the table behind Ron and Harry.
What's wrong with him? Blaise is so amazing and just look at how attractive he is! This is ridiculous. A boy as wonderful and gorgeous as Blaise likes him and he, for some unknown reason, doesn't like him back. Blaise must have felt Draco's eyes on him and looked up into his own. He gave Draco a genuine smile and went back to his conversation with Pansy.
"I've heard that, yeah." Harry said, he couldn't stop smiling.
"And what about you? Do you believe he's changed?" Hermione paused for a moment, thinking about her response.
Thought Harry. He was contemplating all day whether or not to tell Ron and Hermione (even though he's certain she already knows) about his... relationship with Draco. He didn't even really know what to call it because Draco was most definitely
“I know… I don’t care. I need to see him. He’s like… I just…”
"What were you doing wandering around the halls after hours?" Draco wasn't being mean at this point, he was genuinely curious... was Harry following him?
"Very well done! It was perfectly executed. Congratulations, Mr. Weasley, and Miss. Parkinson- very worthy opponent. I don't have anything else for you all; have the rest of the class to do as you please." Bill waved, walked by the trio and winked. "Mr. Potter may I speak with you please?" Harry looked at Hermione and Ron and shrugged and followed Bill out the door.
"Ron."
"I think you're incredible. Not many people have the capability to change. You became the person you wanted to be despite of your family's values. You helped so many other students learn to change to. I mean look at us. You hated me and now we're... er... friends..." Harry trailed off, noticeably embarrassed. There aren't many people Draco would go out on a limb for, but Harry Potter isn't just a person.
"Well, it got him to leave didn't it? Now, talk." She said seriously.
late." Harry rebutted.
At breakfast he saw Draco sitting with his friends. He wanted to say goodbye... but he didn't really know how. Truthfully he wanted to say
"Well, anyway, why are you getting ready to sleep in here?"
Merlin, his lips.
"Yeah that's what all Gryffindor's do..." Ron said.
"Wha-?"
"He'll tell you when he's ready. Maybe he feels weird since him and Ginny broke up, you know?"
"I'm sure you mean Professor Weasley, Ronald?" Bill laughed. Ron rolled his eyes and went in front of the class.
There were collective "Ohh's" and Ahh's" and Draco's stomach dropped.
For some reason Harry's eyes darted to Draco who was already looking at him. He wasn't gonna drink... he's never... okay maybe once but not by choice! He was the first face that popped in his head. All of a sudden he was thinking about blonde hair and Draco's face appeared underneath...
Blaise gave a sad laugh "If you don't know yet, you will." Blaise got up and kissed Draco's cheek. "See you in Potions, okay?"
"I- no! It's just particularly annoying that every aspect of you is bloody perfect! God I mean you're not just perfect in everything else but of course your cock has to be perfect too... perfect..."
He managed to look up from his embarrassment to Harry's face. He was glad he did because Harry was blushing profusely. He smiled to himself.
. Pansy and Blaise are home. Hermione is with Ron's family... and Harry. Well, Harry is with his family as well so...
His eyes. His hair...
"Right... and.... How do you feel about him?"
xx liv
"Obviously."
"I-I'm sorry... I guess I don't understand why you kissed me..."
"Just profess your love for him while you're at it." Pansy whispered so only Draco could hear. He just ignored her and looked over at Harry, who was also blushing.
"We were studying together this morning... actually, most mornings for the past few weeks, and I invited Draco to sit with us over here. That's fine with you guys, right?" Hermione said.
Hermione was looking at him questionably. It's now or never she thought, just ask him.
"Ow! Watch the lips, Potter! I'd really like to keep those if you don't mind." And Harry moved his thumb away.
"I- did... Did Harry tell you?" Draco asked incredulously. "I can't believe that..."
"Uh-I-erm..." Harry mumbled intelligently.
"Look a bit worn out Blaise, long night?" Draco asked, innocently. The rest of the table took notice of how red he got and snickered.
"What do you mean 'no shit'?"
Then when he heard Draco talking about what he had been through... all he wanted to do was just give him a hug and tell him everything was going to be okay.
"I'm not hungry." Draco pouted, but as if on cue, his stomach growled loudly. Blaise just smirked at him.
There was a clatter of "It's not a big deal"s and "Just do it"s.
the next chapter may bit a bit short like this one... i'm not sure yet. i want it in harry's pov, but i also might add pansy's... hmm... idk let me know what you think!
“Do what to me?” Harry asked, finally making eye contact with Draco.
"Sounds brilliant." Hermione replied enthusiastically.
"Uh...I guess d) is the only one that would make sense. It was sort of all of the above."
"That's great Ginny. I'm glad. I think you two work better as friends." Hermione said.
Blaise held him with both his arms. "I don't know Dray. I do know that Harry is not the world. You're still you without him in it. And I know it's terrible right now and you feel like you'll never feel happy again. But I promise you that you won't feel like this forever." Draco just cried more, and Blaise let him.
Draco
Draco followed her out of the Great Hall. "Luna!" He called after her.
“Harry!” Draco called. Harry turned and looked at Draco with a very odd expression. “Hi Draco… I-um. We need to talk. Can we go somewhere alone?” Draco felt like he was going to be sick.
xx liv
But, when he turned the corner and saw Blaise Zabini
"I'm too drunk for this right now, Harry. We'll talk tomorrow." And Ron went back to the booth. Harry swallowed his need to cry and followed him.
Things have been weird at Hogwarts this Holiday. I mean, it's Hogwarts so it's always a bit odd. Draco likes staying here, going home is a last resort. Hogwarts is the only constant in his life quite honestly and he loves it- except; why the hell does Luna Lovegood sit by him at every single meal? Every one without fail Luna is right there sitting next to Draco.
"I'm a noble man, Potter... can't have you corrupting me." Draco said, licking his lips.
"And you're a liar, Malfoy." He said, rising from his seat, 2 down from Draco.
"Everybody has hardships. You can't judge people based on them. You may have had a lot of material items, but you were never emotionally supported and that's something all kids need... I never had that either. I grew up with my awful aunt and uncle and my horrible cousin, Dudley. Though, he has apologized to me and we correspond here and there now..."
Harry looked at him and laughed. "They can wait till tomorrow." He said. "Kissing you can't." They made their way to Harry and Ron's room and locked the door. Telling their friends can wait until tomorrow most definitely,
"What do you mean, Gin? I'm good." Harry replied nervously. How could he talk about all this with Ginny... of all people.
They sat in a semi-comfortable silence for a while.
He rushed his shower just to make it on time, he was sure he looked horrid- but he didn't sleep really at all last night. None of them did, they were all out until god knows when.
"Ok, 3,2,1..." Blaise said 5 and Susan said 9.
"Oh. Thanks. I'm-I-I-I'm okay... thanks... I already said that...uh-...sorry..." Wow, Harry way to go...slick.
"My pleasure." Blaise replied smugly.
"Yes, of course love." Ron turned back around as Slughorn came in the room and began class.
"Yeah... sure." He watched Draco walk away, looked down the table at Harry and waited. Approximately 8 seconds after Draco left Harry got up and walked out of the Great Hall.
He touched his lips with his fingers and watched Draco walk away. He was frozen, couldn't move or say anything. He heard Hermione's voice through his slight paralysis.
Harry was left sitting there, smiling wickedly as he watched him hurry away.
"Did I tell you I loved you today?" Ron asked while he took her hand in his own.
Draco
"Me and ... what? Why? What are people saying?" Harry's stomach was doing back-flips and he felt like he was going to be sick.
When it came time for potions he made his way to Slughorn's room and sat at his usual seat with Greg next to him.
“I’m sorry. But I do want us to still be friends.” Ah… the dreaded F word. Friends? How could he be friends with Harry after he had him the way he did? After he kissed his skin and kissed his lips and well… you know. Harry took his virginity for crying out loud! How could he know exactly how Harry kisses, how he tastes, and not be able to do anything about it? It would kill him.
"No, Blaise. It's fine. Just, will you two drop it? Leave it be. Everything's fine and this is our last year, so it's fine. We will never have to see each other again and it's fine." Draco realized that he had said fine a few too many times but... he couldn't bring himself to care too much.
Malfoy looks perfect as always.
Second, Draco was the first to share at 'The Bonding Thing'.
Ginny and Harry whipped their heads around to see him starring in shock.
When they arrived Draco sat on the couch next to Pansy and Blaise started off back out of the room.
"What do you even see in the git!?"
He looked in the mirror and splashed some water on his face. Relax, he told himself, Potter is allowed to do whatever he wants... he doesn't owe you anything.
"Uh... well, Neville... that sounds brilliant. We will, well most of us, will be there." Pansy said.
"Blaise...I-"
"You were up as late as me!" He whispered.
I mean, what are the chances that Harry actually liked him? He'd say slim to none.
"Go talk to him, Draco. You're going to regret it if you don't." Blaise said. He was right... he needed to find Harry.
"So," Draco started. "What's going on in your life? Did you really suck Sluggy's cock?" Draco said, smirking. She pushed him in the shoulder and told him all about this cute 7th year Slytherin named Wendy.
"You're infuriating, I love you too. What's going on?"
"So I wanted to meet up because I have to talk to you about-" Draco started, but was abruptly cut off by Pansy.
{This chapter is going to go in between Harry and Draco's perspectives. It will include their friends' opinions and little things like that as well. It will never be in first person though. Enjoy!}
with his eyes. Blaise just smiled, as if saying
"Uh-right..." And he started for the stairs.
Draco was more confused than ever. "Me and Potter...? What in god's name are you on about?"
Draco went to his room to grab a book and went back out to the common room. He sat in a chair directly next to where Blaise was and started reading.
"It's so weird you all call him 'Draco' now. I don't think I could ever do it." Ginny laughed. "But, I guess that's Harry's doing, huh?"
She turned around, "Yes?" She questioned.
"Why were you aunt and uncle so awful?"
"You guys didn't go on with the game?"
late. Nevertheless, you look
"Well there's sort of a rumor going around about you and... well..."
"Because that was getting quite... aggressive and we should eat dinner and maybe drink some wine... and then..." Harry pulled Draco down to sit on the pillows, Draco almost in Harry's lap. "then we can continue this... and perhaps a little more." Draco swallowed hard.
"Well... no. But, that doesn't mean anything!" He exclaimed.
Draco looked at her incredulously. "What am I going to do about it? Nothing! What do you mean!? He has a bloody girlfriend anyway... hello, boy plus girlfriend equals... he's straight!" He didn't quite know how to finish his outburst but he figured Pansy got the message.
"All right, sounds good lads. Cheers."
"Well, technically 1 in 15..." He whispered back to her.
About one and a half months later
"Yes!" They said in unison.
"Uh- Ron. You and me?" Blaise asked, giving Ron a look.
"Ok, Harry. Just... whatever you say." Another sigh. "I just want you to be happy."
"I'm not too hungry, but that would be lovely." Draco said, smiling. He took off his sweater, because he was hot, but instantly regretted it after being reminded of what was on his forearm. He rushed to cover it up hoping that Luna wouldn't notice. Obviously she knew he had it... but just... just...
"Just friends? " Pansy answered, disbelievingly.
Harry absolutely had no problem with gay couples, that's for sure. Harry is bisexual so why would he? It's just out of all the people in the world to be kissing each other he would have never guessed Blaise Zabini and Draco Malfoy... ever.
"Uh... 1 in 15... I don't do too well with lots of alcohol at once."
"Harry said he wanted to stop seeing me." Draco said, trying to keep his cool. "He said that he thinks we have very different feelings for each other and that it would be in both of our best interests if we stopped it now. I just... I don't know what to do, Blaise. I love him. I'm in love with him." He couldn't hold in the tears anymore and he broke down and cried into Blaise's chest. "What do I do?" he asked in a choked sob.
"Fuck off, Blaise." He said simply. Draco could practically hear his smirk.
"Thank you, Hermione. You're a good...friend." His lips twitched into a smile as he said the last word. She looked up and smiled.
"Oh, I always am, Potter"
"Blaise kissed me today... well we made out-"
Draco's head shot up so fast he nearly fell out of his chair.
, as she said that.
"Yes! Friends, just friends. Nothing more, nothing less."
Everyone just sort of looked up at him in surprise because... that's who he was... everyone knew Harry as those names. What was so bad about that?
Harry couldn't stop thinking about Draco.
The day went on as it normally did and it was time for lunch. Harry was starving considering he had a piece of toast and bacon for breakfast, so he made his way down to the Great Hall swiftly.
"It's Blaise, Draco. He'll be fine. Out of curiosity, why don't you feel the same way?"
"About what?" Harry asked innocently.
"Question two, what's your favorite memory as a child?"
' Or something strongly similar to that so, I'm right."
"Harry? Ow! Merlin, my head." He said, rubbing his temples. Harry laughed softly and handed him the hangover potion.
Draco tried hard to hide his blush. "Well, luckily I didn't ask Finnigan... and of course I'm not. Don't be ridiculous." He took another drink.
Harry sure knew how to shut up a room. Hermione grabbed his hand halfway through his speech and hadn't let go yet. No one had any idea what to say to that, and everyone sat in an awkward silence for a few moments.
"Oh my fucking god...  Where's Ginny? Has she heard about it?" Harry looked around to see if he could spot her but she was already walking towards him. Shit, he thought.
the bloke?" Ron asked. Harry could have say,
"Unfortunately, I don't have the same curfew as you all, but I would love to come until curfew hits." Luna said. "May we invite Ginny as well? It'd be nice to include her."
"I'm not so sure about that 'Mione. You just saw him run off." Harry answered, sadly.
"Nope, just got out! Wanna be late to class?" She wiggled her eyebrows suggestively.
"Drunk you definitely does." Hermione said, smirking.
"Well... I'm here to talk about last night." Harry said, hoping his anxiety wasn't clear in his voice. Draco looked up at him meeting Harry's eyes with fear.
"No!" Harry said abruptly. Then he realized it might sound like he's being a git... It's not like he wants to exclude him but his mind is going crazy about Draco. "I mean... no way can we pass up on that awesome... bonding experience..." Everyone looked as confused as Harry felt but decided it best to move on.
"'Mione, please drop it. I'm fine." He got up abruptly and headed out the Great Hall.
"I mean, sad, but he said we were still friends."
"Headmistress, Goyle started the whole thing. He was saying disgusting stuff about my friends!" Harry said.
"I'll tell you eventually..." Harry finally said. Hermione paused for a moment.
"Ah, Mister Potter, so glad you could join us. 10 points from Gryffindor for being late and disrupting my class." Slughorn looked around the room, eyeing who had an available seat next to them. Draco was tempted to push Goyle out of his seat so Potter would have to sit by him... but that would seem a little obvious. "Take a seat next to Mister Zabini please."
"Normal?" She asked, giving him a once over. "Nice hickey." She smirked. Harry's eyes shot out of his head and he lifted his hand to his neck.
"Look, Blaise, I-"
"Right... goodnight then."  and Harry grabbed his things and left.
"I take it you're not going to tell me?"
"Sorry... well... should I talk to him about the... you know, the kiss?"
"Just relax, I mean Harry's probably freaking out right now." Pansy said as they were leaving.
“Oh.” Was all Draco could bring himself to say.
"Right! I do... if you want..."
The  next day Harry woke up with one of the worst hangovers of his entire life and there was a good chunk of the night before missing.
"I'm not... not any more... that's one of the things I wanted to talk to you about. I've been contemplating it all day and I've come to the conclusion that I kind of... a little bit... sort of like... don't freak out," Draco said this last part as a whisper, "Harry Potter."
"That's what we're calling it. Really?" Ron asked his girlfriend dubiously.
"What was that about?" Ron asked her, as Harry went off to 'Do charms homework'.
"Shut it! Get to it Harry, I'm serious."
"Never. I know I'll always need you. So, friends?"
"I'm not going to kiss you. We're not going to make out. I could never do that to-... well... you know it's just fine."
"You know, we should probably just go straight to The Great Hall. I think it's about lunch time." Draco took his hand, not knowing that the small motion of holding his hand was everything.
"I was just making sure you weren't uh- up to no good or something." God dammit why did Harry have to be so fucking cute.
"Brilliant." Blaise and Draco said at the same time.
"Er, yeah. Just in case something like this ever happened... and I'm pretty sure Hermione already knew anyway."
"I know. I always want to talk back and tell him he isn't the boss of me... but he is here." Ron said.
"I know. And I won't spend the rest of my life in here. Maybe just the rest of this week. Or the month. You can get my assignments for me, right?"
until I finally got off my high horse and we talked about it. I'm not saying you have to tell the bloke you
His head was pounding and he felt severely nauseous... how much did he drink last night? He looked over to Ron's bed and didn't see him lying there.
"Draco what's wr-"
"You remember last night!?" Ron asked shocked. "Hermione and I had to practically carry you to bed." Harry chuckled.
"Thanks..."
"You look good walking away from me." He smirked wickedly at him, and Harry blushed.
"You're right. I actually created it. It took some time and reading up on all the logistics. But, I had a lot of scars from the war- as everyone does. I didn't like them. They were a reminder of things I didn't enjoy. So I thought I should put something on my body that I do enjoy." Luna said it so matter-of-fact. It made Draco jealous that he couldn't be so honest.
the shenanigans continue...
"Harry! C'mon! I woke you up an hour ago before I went to breakfast! We're gonna be late to Potions!" Harry shot up in his bed. He vaguely remembered Ron waking him up before, but he was so tired. Maybe if he hadn't stayed out with a certain blonde Slytherin until 4 AM... but, that's beside the point. "C'mon, Potter. I grabbed you some bacon and toast but we gotta move it."
"What-what do you mean? I...the last thing I really remember was coming back from the toilet with Ron..."
, that’s what he’d be. He realized that when Harry suggested the friends with benefits, and he knows it now more than ever. Whatever Harry needs, he’ll be.
"Harry?" He turned around to see Draco standing next to his bed.
"As Cecilia Ahern once said, 'There's a fine line between love and hate.' They're that line."
When Harry woke up the next morning, a Saturday - thank Merlin, he was surprised to find that Ron wasn't in his bed. Then he thought about it and he was most likely off with Hermione somewhere and he was just fine be left out of details on that one. He went down to the Great Hall for breakfast and sat down next to Dean, who was across from Seamus. Neville and Luna were also sitting next to them.
"It's okay. I just really had wished that I was wrong and just being jealous... but you've always liked him."
"Blaise does have a point. Harry is the one who broke it off." Pansy said, folding her arms. "How can we be sure he won't do it again?"
"I'm in. Those two have been so bloody stupid it's making me sick." Pansy replied.
, Harry silently begged.
"You really think I don't know you, huh?" She laughed. "Fine, you'll tell me someday. I actually have something to tell you. I understand if you freak out and get mad but just think about me and how I always make good decisions and I always think my choices through so I really know-" Ginny hadn't taken a breath once in her whole speech, so Harry stopped her.
Maybe Harry could be alright with just shagging. Friends with benefits. He could do that...
"Well, that's what all of us were wondering as well. I suppose it had something to do with whatever you and Ronald talked about in the washroom." She looked at him pointedly.
"Hey, Draco. Everyone's wondering where you are. You've been in here for a while." Harry said, sounding concerned.
“I… I don’t think we should see each other anymore.” Harry said, looking down at his lap. On the inside Draco was screaming
"...and I can't believe I actually did it, I mean how much of an idiot am I? Why didn't I just kiss you, Pansy? I mean at least then people would know it wasn't true and no one would talk about it again. I am the biggest idiot on the face of the planet. I mean what must Harry be thinking right now? I can't even-" Draco had been rambling for a good 10 minutes, ever since they had woke up, to Pansy and Blaise. After Draco grabbed Blaise and dragged them to their room Pansy followed very quickly after, and ended up just spending the night in their dorm.
xx liv
"Aw, Weasley how sweet." Draco joked.
"Yep. I think she's right, too." Draco swallowed hard and looked up at him.
"I won't say anything, Draco. I promise. Your secret is safe with me." She looked at him, warmly.  A look passed between the two of them and Draco knew in that moment that they were... friends... and it was a significantly good feeling.
"-and I.... wait what?"
Harry was flabbergasted. "0 in a million ! I have a girlfriend! No way!"
"3,2,1..." In unison they both said 12.
"You kind of did... and you have every right to do that if you weren't happy. But... you were. You are bloody in love with that bloke and you've been miserable since you broke up with him."
"Nope. If you apologize to me we are no longer best friends."
"You took Muggle Studies, right? Romeo and Juliet?" Ginny looked at her, as if telling her to explain. "Romeo and Juliet came from rivaling families. Nobody thought they would work together because they were just too different. Juliet said that; meaning that no matter what you call a rose, it will still smell like a rose- so, what's in a name?"
And, because of fate, or the universe, or something unknown; Draco was in the common room as Harry was walking down the steps from the dormitory.
"Harry!? Malfoy!?" The boys whipped their heads around to see Ron looking at them in shock.
"Ok, Ok, I get it. I'm a dunce." Draco said pouting and flopping on his bed.
"We're Ok. If Ginny is happy and Blaise is good to her, that's all I care about."
He decided to go to his favorite chair in the 8th year common room and finish up his book. He sat in his chair, located right in between the fireplace and a small table. He opened his book and began to read, but only read the first few sentences before he was disturbed by someone coming in the door.
. He also talked about
When they got to her office McGonagall was waiting for them, and waiting to give them their punishment.
Draco wasn't going to get enraged, that would only make things worse. "Ron, can I ask you a question?"
They jumped apart from each other and both blushed, looking down. "I'll, uh-see you in Potions, Draco." and Harry went off.
"Where are we going?" Harry asked.
Draco reached down to Harry's lap and felt the hard member there. That fact only made him want Harry even more. He undid his pants and motioned for Harry to pull them down. He happily contended and followed his instructions.
"Probably just get some dinner and go to Hogshead, yeah?" Dean asked.
For some reason, Draco blushed at that. It was just the idea that his friend, who also had a crush on him, sitting next to Harry freaking Potter who he ... well we've been over this... Oh, who was he kidding? He liked Potter, god dammit. It suddenly made all the sense in the world why he was always so jealous of Ginny...He's an idiot.
"Will you tell me what I can't remember if I do?"
"I don't know, just wondering. Draco is his best friend so I was curious."
"Mmm, you read my mind, let's go." Draco grabbed his hand and Harry draped the cloak over the two of them making them disappear. Neither were aware of just how much their hearts raced at that simple action of holding hands.
"Well, no. But, pretty much... kind of? Anyway, he doesn't have to. I know he doesn't feel the same way."
"Do you really think this is going to work?" Hermione asked him.
Someone had to say something and since it wasn't Ron or Hermione, Draco decided to.
"I brought you dinner because I'm not letting you starve yourself. Here." Blaise said, handing him a plate full of food. Draco sat up in his bed and crossed his arms.
"Pansy..." Harry trailed off. What was he supposed to say?
Harry's hand started trembling and he didn't know why. He spoke in a quiet voice. "I never wanted to be a hero. I never asked for any of this to happen to me. For my parents to be murdered, for countless lives to be lost because of me! Yeah, I'm The ruddy Chosen One, but I'm also the reason that this whole fucking war started in the first place. I'm the reason everyone died. I-I'm," Harry choked back tears, "I'm the reason my parents are dead. And every time someone calls me one of those names... it just reminds me of all the lives I couldn't save."
"Well!? Are you just being a freak and watching me sleep? One of your weird fantasies, Potter?" Draco smirked, hoping to make Potter blush at the insinuation.
"Of course you don't. Should I ask Draco?" She glanced down the table at him for dramatic effect.
Everyone laughed, but Ron continued.
"We have to confront him about this! Why did he never say anything?"
"Well D-Malfoy, you don't need to be embarrassed I think most people who fought in the war get nightmares... I know I do."
By the time they got back to the common room, and Draco had said
"Why so tense, Potter?" Draco started. He had to admit, he loved the way Harry's face looked right now, blushing and glowing. "Never seen two people kiss before?"
"Right. '...dating Ginny, and he would find some other girl or guy to date'!"
"Harry that was hours before we left the pub... you really don't remember anything after that?"
He couldn't control the next words that came out of his mouth, even if he had been sober. "I doubt anyone really cares. Besides, you looked like you were having a good time with that blonde bimbo out there so go back to your fun. I wouldn't want to keep you." The words just shot out of his mouth like venom. Harry looked taken aback. He stared at Draco for a minute and then started laughing. The git started laughing!
"I think about 3 minutes." They just sort of stood there awkwardly.
"Thanks, Blaise... that really helped... I've just felt so-"
"I'm sitting here complaining about getting the world handed to me... you didn't even know your parents."
"And what way is that?" Blaise asked, smirking. Draco turned red.
"Right... goodnight then." and Harry grabbed his things and left.
"Pansy picked you."
"Brilliant. Ornaturique!" Draco had his eyes closed and then looked down at his arm. The Dark Mark was ugly, and horrible and reminded him of all that he hated about himself. But, after Voldemort died, it faded. It was now just a light grey, but still clearly there. What Luna did- made it actually look... pretty. There were multi-coloured flowers all around and over the Dark Mark with vines connecting them all. It was beautiful, Draco thought. He had never seen anything so beautiful. He could where a short sleeved shirt without feeling like he'd throw up. He could be... intimate with Harry without fear that he'll see it and be revolted... it was... well how many times can someone say beautiful before it looses it's meaning? Draco actually felt like tearing up a bit.
"Sorry... I'm sorry. I think I just need some air, Ok? Don't wait up." Harry grabbed his invisibility cloak and walked out the door.
"Ronald, do you ever look around you or do you just wait for me to tell you things?"
Everyone was talking and laughing, waiting for Blaise and Harry to emerge from their make out session to continue the game.
"This is crazy! You and Potter's exes are dating?"
"Oh, alright. What were you thinking?"
"Sorry, Pro- Headmistress. We were wondering if we could use your pensieve? We have some... um... memories we need to work out." Harry said as he looked awkwardly in Draco's direction.
"Who's up for a game of 'Never Have I Ever''" Draco heard Blaise say. He did a 90 degree turn to where Blaise was, smirking. Regretfully, everyone thought it would be a great idea. But, Draco thought it just might be the worst idea Blaise ever had.
"A night in Hogsmeade, you in?" Seamus asked them.
" Pansy retorted. Blaise chuckled and Draco gave her the evil eye.
He looked at Draco, and the look that Harry was giving him made Draco's insides melt. He stared at Draco for what seemed an eternity until he finally spoke.
"Uh-no one... Pansy is just-"
"You make me happy too." Draco said, and pulled Harry in for a kiss. It seemed like everything was still. The only people who existed were the two of them. And that's all that mattered to Harry in that moment, that perfect moment... Then Draco pulled away and looked at Harry with a smile.
After Potions the Gryffindors had History of Magic so they all started towards that classroom.
"Yes!" He about screamed. "Er... um... I mean yeah, that would be amazing...."
"No they're not. Harry told me they aren't, so I believe him."
Pansy and Draco shared a look and then laughed a little before Draco kissed her. How long was it supposed to be, 10 seconds? Harry couldn't even believe Susan picked this one, he should have known the quieter ones would cause the most problems. I mean, really? The second round and people are already kissing each other and hasn't it been 10 seconds already!?
"So many things. Some people were saying that you guys have been secretly dating for years or that you're running away together after school. Just, so many things... I have been trying to tell people that none of it is true, but there was already so much damage and I..."
Damnit, Weasley! Draco thought. I was just getting to the bottom of it.
... you know... sexually." Draco leaned in, and placed a kiss on Harry's neck.
a conversation leads to two people really JUST being friends... but, for how long will that last? why did they break it off? are their feelings reciprocated? will they ever just tell each other HOW THEY FEEL? i guess we'll find out soon (;
"I'm shocked by you two... and also very proud." She said as she went in to kiss Ron.
"Harry..." Hermione continued.
"Well... you two are together aren't you? I saw you... ya know... making out the-the other day." Harry looked down at his feet while Blaise just laughed.
"Ginny."
"Okay lovebirds! Times up!" They heard Pansy's voice yell.
"He... we went to McGonagall's office and she looked really serious. I asked what was wrong and she smiled and said that her and Bill wanted to talk to me about something. Basically McGonagall said that if I do well on my N.E.W.T.S. and keep my grades up the rest of the year... she's offering me a job as the DADA professor next year."
"Yes, Ronald, that's what we're calling it. 'The Bonding Thing'. Since people like you are so against it, we have to make it seem all taboo."
"Alright Shakespeare... relax. I know. I guess it's just a bit weird because... well, there may be a fine line between love and hate... but I am nowhere near that line. I hated him as kids. I guess I don't hate him now. But, I'll definitely need some convincing to see if he's good enough for Harry."
Hermione and Ron looked at each other and back to Harry.
"Who would've thought, Ron Weasley helping to reconnect his best friend and his worst enemy." Hermione said, jokingly.
"I'm going to find Ginny. See you in Potions."
He smiled to himself as they said the same number. Got him, he thought. Harry looked around to find where Draco was headed and then felt hands cup his cheeks, and turned to see Draco leaning in to him.
Eventually everyone got to say what they wanted and began talking about this or that among themselves. Some people were starting to feel a little fuzzy from the Firewhiskey, and Hermione cleared her throat. "Harry, do you want to add anything?" Harry cringed. He was so close.
"Oh, uh-uh- nothing... just daydreaming I guess." she shrugged and he thanked God that he was off the hook. Ginny got up and continued "I gotta head to Defense, some students want to practice before class, I'll see you guys." and she kissed Harry's cheek.

"So, say... hypothetically... that I- my friend was in a relationship. A long one, about 2 years... but then, all of a sudden and out of nowhere... they start to kind of maybe fancy someone else... sort of... would that make me- them a bad person?" He was staring at his feet but at the last part of his speech he looked up at Blaise.
... Harry wanted to say. But, instead, he just laid down in bed and stared at the ceiling, wishing that the boy he loved... loved him too.
"Who are you and what have you done with Hermione Granger?" Harry asked.
"Oh...I'm good. Great, even. Just a fucking idiot, but that's not news."
"I suppose it has something to do with the fact that you kissed him at The Bonding Thing, and that neither of you were at breakfast..." Millie said sheepishly.
"7 shots!? What the hell was I thinking?" He said, mostly to himself.
"Pansy I-"
Nothing made sense... he was into Draco just a few weeks ago and now he was having secret trysts with the girl Weasley? He had to talk to Blaise about this tomorrow. He made his way back to his own common room only to have Pansy shouting at him for being a complete and utter git for leaving in the middle of her story.
announced that if he unlocked the door Draco would attack him and asked him to sleep in Ginny's room tonight.
"It's okay, it was for the best, I think."
Pansy didn't look satisfied. Draco sighed.
"Headmistress... winter holidays start-"
Hermione and Ron shared a look and they both silently agreed that he was not fine.
"It's too late now. But I'll get up. Take me to Hogsmeade later? Tell 'Mione too. I'm going to take a shower, Ok?"
tell Ron, Ok? You have to promise me." Ginny said, seriously.
"I can't help it, Ron! It's not something that you can just flip in your mind. It's subconscious! I can't control how I feel about someone!"
"So, how... did this happen?" She asked.
Draco's breath got hitched in his throat and he suddenly forgot that you need to breathe in order to continue living. "Someone else?"
"Hmm would ya look at that?" Pansy said the smirk lighting her whole face. "I think I just saw Harry take a swig of Firewhiskey at that one." Luckily she spoke so only Blaise and maybe Greg were listening.
"No, Malfoy! Gods, I'm sorry I didn't know what you were doing... I saw you walk in here and I didn't-"
"I don't know..." Blaise said.
"No... I've never... obviously, that's why I didn't drink. Moving on..." Harry said looking down from Ron's eyes.
"Ron, what exactly are people saying?"
After what seemed like hours of teaching Luna how to play, they played a few rounds of one on one. Soon enough the sun started to set and that meant that dinner was either soon or they were missing it. He sat down to catch his breath for a moment.
"What's wrong with him?" Draco asked as Ron, Hermione and himself watched Harry sprint out of the classroom.
"Harry?" Ginny started, "What are you looking at?" she asked her boyfriend curiously.
"You can start by telling me the truth about Draco."
Draco looked at him for a moment, just staring at Harry. Harry started feeling fairly uncomfortable so he shifted awkwardly and cleared his throat, breaking Draco from his gaze.
"Like I said, ask Draco. I doubt he would forget." Harry didn't know if it was the hangover or what, but he swore he saw a flicker of a smirk when Hermione said that. Of course, that could have been his own paranoia.
"So it's a girl!" Pansy exclaimed. "Who is it, Blaise?"
"Thank God! I thought you'd gone missing," he hugged her, "when you weren't at breakfast I got worried."
Harry gave Draco a look he couldn't decipher and ordered another round of drinks.
"Uh, hello... well, McGonagall thought that we should all meet up and well bond a little so we have a better understanding of each other. I was thinking we could just go around and talk about things that maybe bother us..." Everyone just looked up at her, no one wanted to be the first to say anything. She pulled out a bottle of Firewhiskey from her purse, took a swig and set it down on the table. Everyone chuckled and suddenly the mood was different.
"What you were saying before, how it's weird that Harry calls him Draco instead of Malfoy now. 'What's in a name?' Who cares what he's calling him- it won't change how he feels about him."
Harry
That's weird. You see, up until yesterday the only thoughts Harry had about Draco Malfoy were homicidal... okay, so yeah he thought he was hot... and during the war things did change kind of... but not like this...Now everything was different and he couldn't explain why, just that it felt normal. Like this was the way he was supposed to feel all along.
"Harry...  everything you are is incredible. I would still think you're incredible even if you weren't The Boy Who Lived. That's not what I see in you. I like your heart. How you take everything people say and feel it in your heart, in your soul. I like your mind, how you think about things different than anyone else I've ever known. I like your face. I like how you smile, how you laugh. Do you need me to go on? I can. I like your scars because they show how strong you are. I like your-" Harry cut him off.
"I think I'll like it better when a few words are changed... but I suppose it's much to early to think about that." Harry said, grasping the sides of Draco's face, one hand cascading through Draco's hair. Draco was trying to suppress his maddening blush, but couldn't.
"Ron... if my life made sense, I wouldn't be sitting here talking to you about how I'm in love with-" Harry froze, terrified of what he was just about to say. "How I'm... just..." It was no use. Ron knew him well enough... he probably knew without Harry accidentally admitting it. He was irrefutably in love with Draco Malfoy. Fuck.
Draco just wanted to know why Pansy hated him this much.
"You're okay with me cheating on your sister!?"
xx liv
"Pansy, please get your head out of your arse, I have no desire to look at Potter any more than I have to. What are you lot talking about?" Draco sneered in response.
... Draco rolled his eyes.
"Gin...I do love you..."
"Because he doesn't! He doesn't and I just know it, okay?" Harry exclaimed.
"We're good. You're my friend. I'll just find another girl or guy to pine desperately for..." he laughed, "See ya."
was and he
Blaise squeezed him tighter. "I'm not. You know why? I found Ginny and she's everything to me. I loved you, and I still do but in a very different way. I was hurt, and I felt terrible but I am so happy now with Ginny. Maybe this is what you needed to finally get over this 8 year crush on Potter. I love you Draco, I can't stand to see you like this. I know that everything's going to be ok."
"I do! He's incredible! He's such a gentleman... he's so cute and smart! He's funny! Literally he's the entire package and more." She gushed.
He looked next to him and realized Ron was staring at Harry too. He didn't drink though. Seamus must have noticed that as well because he said, "Harry, you and Ginny haven't-" He stopped abruptly when Harry threw a glare at him. He blushed and looked up at Ron.
"C'mon Pansy, if he's not ready don't make him."
i have an author's note where it starts and ends, it's literally a couple of lines!
"I know... too bad it took us so long to realize that. But, I wouldn't trade it for anything... Hermione?" Ginny asked.
"Stop it!" He was blushing furiously, but laughing so Draco knew it was okay.
"Why not indeed. Lead the way Draco."
Harry felt like he was supposed to tell Molly and Arthur... but how do you just say that. 'Hey... remember that right awful git Draco Malfoy? He made fun of your family and everything you do? Him? Yeah I'm in love with him.' Somehow he didn't think that would go over well. He walked back in the burrow and saw Hermione sitting on the couch reading. Harry plopped down next to her.
"To be honest with you, I never hated you. I hated that you hated me... but I always had feelings for you... you know. Like a crush. I've always had those kind of... feelings..." Draco had never felt more exposed than in that moment. He'd never been so open with... anyone.
"Hey guys... how's everything?" Hermione asked the siblings. Ron smiled at Hermione and sat next to her, the side Harry wasn't on, and kissed her cheek.
After lunch the day went on as normal. They had Charms, History of Magic and then Defense Against the Dark Arts. In DADA they took their usual places.
"I- yeah. We've had sex. But, only once. We decided it was too soon for that and we just... do other things..." Harry groaned internally, and probably externally, about this terribly, horrific and embarrassing conversation.
Draco
"Uh-Draco, wait! Go on ahead Ron. I'll be fine, just a second."
"Why? Maybe because I've had to sit with my best friend for 2 days, wiping his tears and holding him as he cried into my arms. I'm sorry, but I've never seen Draco more hurt than how I've seen him the past few days. How can we even be sure that Potter has real feelings for him?" Blaise said, looking expectantly at Ron and Hermione.
"I'm working on it, I really am." Hermione opened her mouth to reply but she saw Ron and Ginny walking over to them.
"He didn't even care Ron. I thought that maybe he'd be a little hurt by what happened, but he remained totally stone cold. I mean I thought that he'd at least be a little sad. But maybe I wasn't even that good at sex. So, I guess he's not missing out on anything since he didn't have real feelings for me, not even sexual!" Harry couldn't help but laugh. The man he loved not loving him back, like he was in a movie. Or a sad character in one of the muggle novels Aunt Petunia had lying around where the character loses the love of their life.
"Thank you, as I was saying. What Are The Odds that you'll have a little 7 minutes in heaven with... hmm.....Blaise?"
The next morning Harry and Ron were both up and packed (with what they needed for the break) at a reasonable hour. They didn't have to be thrown out of bed by Hermione, and they were two of the first people in the common room.
." Blaise mocked.
"The proper 'best friend response' would be much more encouraging."
"Yeah of course." He grabbed her arm and they went outside the Great Hall.
"Harry don't you want to-"
"Well... if you want. We can meet up later in the common room." Harry smirked. Draco had a bad feeling about this... but considering Harry was like his kryptonite, he regrettably agreed.
"I'm-! You didn't know either!" Harry exclaimed. "You're just as dense as me about all this."
"Yeah, cause you look so much better. There's no time. We are going to be so late. We'll just sneak up to our dorms and ... fix ourselves and meet back in the common room, Ok?"
"Good, keep it that way. I've gotta run... I've got to do extra credit... see you later."
"My pleasure."
He hadn't realized that he'd been grimacing until Seamus Finnigan said something.
"It's a game!"
"And I love you. But, I think we both knew that this wasn't going to last. We were just trying to hold on to what we knew before the war... but we changed so much. I think I've known for a while that you have been slipping away, but I just wanted to cling on to my childhood, even though it's gone."
"Okay... remember that you said that... I'm dating... Blaise. Zabini... Blaise Zabini and I are dating and we have been for a while..." Ginny closed her eyes, scared of what Harry's reaction would be and Harry was going to open his mouth to say
Draco thought.
"Should we invite the rest of the eighth years? You know; Blaise, Pansy, Gregory, Millie, Theo, Daphne, Draco...?" Hermione said, not looking at Harry.
Draco rubbed his temple. The look on Harry's face had him spewing out his secrets faster than he had time to think. It's really not at all fair how much power he had over Draco. "Well...if you-uh... if you must know... I-well... Potter, I swear to Merlin if you repeat this to anyone I'll hex your balls off," No way he would ever think of doing that, "but I have nightmares... really bad ones where I end up screaming most nights... and well I'm not allowed to use spells outside of class on my probation... so I can't use a silencing charm..." He trailed off awkwardly hoping Harry would just leave, it was embarrassing enough that he was some coward, but Harry is a bloody hero... the hero...
"Bloody hell... sorry I'm just a bit... uh... distracted, I guess." Harry said, looking down. Draco was still there and he definitely couldn't talk about why he was distracted while the distractment was right there.
"Hermione Granger... I did not expect that from you... I agree though. I think it's needed. And I don't think it's childish at all. When should we plan this for?"
This day was not going at all how Harry had originally thought. First, Draco apologized to him, then they shared this intimate hug... moment... thing... and now every time he looked at Draco he got this weird feeling in the pit of his stomach.
"He doesn't feel the same way Ron... this is all physical to him. If I tell him I want more... he'll laugh in my face." Harry said, defeated.
"Harry... I... I'm not breaking up with you because of that kiss. But, these past few months I have felt you slipping away from me. I've tried to deny it because, I love you so much, but I really think that you and I worked so much better when we were friends-more like brother and sister, you know? I just think that we should break up, it's for the best. Don't you think?" Harry just stared at her for a minute. He loved Ginny, he really did. But everything she said was true. He loved her more like a friend, they just weren't compatible as more than that.
"What do you mean 'You can help'? How?" Draco asked, honestly interested.
"Being honest?" She finished for him. Hermione was giggling and Draco was glaring at both of them.
"You're so strong, you know that?" Hermione said putting her hands on either side of his face. "I love you so much. So much more than I ever thought I could love another person. You are everything."
some fun antics with the crew (;
"So, how did it go, then?" Pansy asked Draco.
"Fine, but we're not finished with this conversation." She huffed, and got up to leave.
Hello again! In this chapter it's the day from the last chapter and everything that happened but from Draco's POV. Also, I have included pretty much the whole lot of Slytherins and people from Harry's year because we need some involvement with students and I think their last year was pretty awful so a lot would come back anyway.
"I don't know you don't like everyone who likes you and-"
. Yeah." Blaise laughed to himself. "Wish I could get extra credit for snogging."
"Alright well the first topic is family. Question one: How would you describe your home growing up? a) cheerful. b) moderate. c) bad/nonsupporting. d) other- explain." Harry started.
They made there way up to Harry’s dorm alone and sat down on his bed. “Harry what’s going on? You’re making me a bit nervous.”
A few more people spoke and Harry was very determined to not talk at 'The Bonding Thing'. He didn't know what to say. Harry had lost more people than you can count on one hand. But, so had everyone. Harry fought in a war. But, so had everyone. Sure, he was The Chosen One, but that didn't make him any better than anyone else. People knew his story, it was in ever article for months...
"Ok. Ok, I believe you. I think they're both being stupid. But, it's been awful seeing Draco like that the past few days. I'll be glad when he's back to normal." Blaise said.
Draco was sure his face was almost as red as Harry's and wasn't sure why... he knew if he opened his mouth he would probably stutter and Malfoy's don't stutter.
"C'mon, Zabini! Tell us!" Ron prompted
"I felt a bit better and wanted to see all of you." He made eye contact with Draco, blushed a bit, and sat next to Hermione.
"I know... but it'll be over before you know it. I promise." He kissed Harry sweetly, but quickly pulled away. "You're so...I'll miss you." Draco said.
"About quarter till 8. We were just going to head to breakfast, would you like to join us?" Hermione said.
"Would you have rather I said you instead of Blaise?"
"Sounds great," Blaise's eyes wondered around the room. "Susan." She looked up, surprised. "What Are The Odds that you'll chug the rest of your Firewhiskey?" Some people chuckled and she looked kind of mortified.
"Is that a blush I see? Why, because I said you're hot? You are. You're hot, you're hot, you're hot, you're hot, you're-" Harry put his hand over his mouth.
I wanted to set up these two boys' kiss... or almost kiss (;  Next chapter will be Harry trying to put pieces together.
McGonagall looked between the two boys, slightly amused. "I'll allow it. I have to go talk to Professor Slughorn. Make it quick." And she left them alone with the pensieve.
"Potter!" Oh jeez what was wrong with him? Did he really just follow Harry out of the Great Hall like a lost puppy? How embarrassing. He put his hands over his face while Harry turned around obviously confused by his flare-up of idiocy.
"Ok, I promise. What's going on?"
"I love you too." Draco replied. "I've never... it's so easy to say to you. I love you. I love you." Draco continued.
"Yeah?"
"Bloody fine... go find your golden boy." He said, the tone offended Hermione because she said,
After making his out of the way trek to the common room, he was surprised to find a lot of the 8th years already there sitting all together around the fireplace. It truly was an odd sight, seeing Ravenclaws, Hufflepuffs, Gryffindors, and Slytherins all together, not fighting, just sitting there talking amicably.
"Nothing to lie about Pans. We were flirting. That's all we've been doing for months. Since he and She- Weas... Ginny... broke up." Draco looked over at Blaise, saying an
"We all get them... Harry's are just... extremely vivid. Having Voldemort inside his head all the time..."
"I was miserable with him too... because I... having him almost fully... but not really? I- I couldn't do that anymore. It was killing me slowly."
"That's!-That's not what I meant! Uh... Never Have I Ever... had sex." He said small. He was still blushing as he heard a few surprised mummers and then a good amount of the students took a drink, he was only really paying attention to Harry though.
"You're... you... you love him?" Ron asked, after what seemed like an eternity of silence.
because no matter who he ended up with it would always be in the public eye- especially Draco.
"It could have been worse..." Harry said, chuckling. "I mean, it could have been McGonagall... imagine..." Harry shivered.
Harry, embarrassingly, walked over to where Blaise was seated past his friends who all gave him knowing smirks. All except Ron who just sort of turned his head and didn't look at him.
"UGH!" Draco dropped his head onto Pansy's shoulder. "What's wrong with me!? Blaise is amazing. I have no room to turn anyone down. I'm a right bloody wanker and-"
"Ron? Can you say something?" Harry felt like he was about to cry.
Draco honestly couldn't give two shits, "Weasley. Hello, Granger. And, goodbye."
"I'm sure whatever I did is worse, so no judgement from me. I promise." Draco smiled and tapped his forehead with his wand bringing the memory out in a clear airy substance. He dropped it into the pensieve and Harry pushed his head down into it, silently praying that he would still have some dignity intact after watching it.
She smiled and sat down across from him, pulling books out of her bag. For the rest of the morning they sat in comfortable silence reading and enjoying this blossoming friendship.
"Harry you really don't know how beautiful you are do you? You're lovely. I mean... I don't know why you wouldn't believe me. Coming from me it should mean the most."
"I, well McGonagall really, but I wanted to meet with you about this whole bonding thing..."
Draco paused for a second trying to collect himself. "It was like he had just killed all of us anyway. But even if you had died, Neville was right. Your heart beats for us, and you are the reason that everyone who is in this room is alive. But, you're not the reason anyone is dead. That is because a disgusting man thought that power was more important than love and honor. To me, personally, you're everything that I needed during that time." He felt Blaise and Pansy's knowing smirks at that, but he didn't care, "I was in a house with Death Eaters torturing people.
"Pans...," he started slowly with his hands in surrender, "I'm sorry." She crossed her arms.
"I just mean the three of us have never really gotten along with anyone except ourselves... it's nice to have other..." Pansy trailed off.
He went all over the castle looking for Draco since he wasn't in the common room. He checked the Great Hall- nothing. He checked the library- nothing. He checked the locker rooms- nothing! Then, it hit him. Draco had taken it to sleeping in the Room of Requirement every night... perhaps he was still asleep. He made sure he had the other hangover potion Hermione gave him and made his way.
"So that's true? His connection with The D-...Voldemort?"
"But, you see, I'm ready to go. Plus, I don't know if I can afford to be late." He said coyly.
Draco watched Harry as he walked away and was then brought back to reality when Pansy punched his shoulder.
"Wh-... I... C'mon, Potter."
"What kind of tattoos?
"I guess you could say that. I just can't believe that people are so bloody stupid to think that Potter and me are having some sort of sordid affair. I mean, people are thick ... idiots ...and ...and..." Draco was trying very hard to convince himself that the idea of Potter being his boyfriend was ridiculous, but honestly whenever he thought about it he just felt giddy inside.
"I understand... I mean... not really, but I understand what you're saying. It must have been difficult growing up with that toxic mindset."
"All right you crazy kids. Hurry though, we don't want to be late for our social gathering, would we Ronald?"
"They never told me I was a wizard. I found out when Hagrid showed up at my doorstep on my eleventh birthday. They never loved me or treated me right... they thought I was a freak."
"You're going to get your heart broken. You are so not just a casual shagging type of bloke. You are a high maintenance, prissy, rich annoying bloke who needs to be pampered. So... you deserve more than this. AND," Pansy continued before he cut her off, "that is all I am going to say on this matter, because I will combust from your stupidity if I don't walk away right now." And she turned on her heels and walked out of the dorm. After about a minute of silence Blaise finally spoke.
Draco smiled and then sat down next to him on the bed. "No need to apologize to me. So you're alright?"
"You Gryffindors aren't too bad, you know?" Pansy noted.
"Potter!?" Draco questioned, as he stood up from the bed. "What in Merlin's name are you bloody doing here!?"
Shit, Harry realized, shit shit shit. He almost kissed Draco! And... Ron saw. Shit.
"Well, that's what you want right? Just do it."
"But...you do...fancy him, that is?" She asked, her voice as small as she felt. She has good insights and can pretty much figure anything out... no matter the topic.
"I mean, it was very embarrassing on his part." Blaise added, unhelpfully.
"I'm in love with you too... you... stupid Gryffindor... I can't believe you didn't realize it." Draco finally said. Harry's world stopped.
"Maybe everyone could meet up in the common room and everyone could sort of take turns talking about the different prejudices on their house and ... uh well... you know." Hermione looked down at her feet. "I know it's silly and rather childish, but I think it's needed. And, I thought maybe... without McGonagall knowing of course... we could sneak some Firewhiskey in." She smirked to herself.
"Yes, I know as you so eloquently reminded me and the entire common room. I do appreciate you lowering your voice when you said... what was it,
Ron sat up, "Never Have I Ever kissed a bloke." Hermione giggled a little and took a drink as well as most of the girls and a few boys, including Harry. Draco knew he had no right to feel jealous, but he couldn't help it. What boy had he kissed, and why couldn't it have been him???
"Oh, that doesn't work on me, Malfoy. I know you're lying, but fine. Don't tell me. I'll find out soon enough. You'll slip up and I'll catch you." She rolled her eyes. "I'm going to the library, Blaise?"
"What about... Draco?"
"Well, I suppose 7 shots of Firewhiskey will do that to you." Hermione sent him a disapproving look.
"I followed Blaise all the way to the Gryffindor common room and he waited for about 5 minutes until Ginny Weasley... as in Potter's ex girlfriend... walked out and he grabbed her hand and swooped her off."
"Harry, forget about the history... what do you want now?"
"Good idea, I don't know how Ron would take that hearing it from someone else." Hermione thought to herself. "Do you think Draco knows?"
"Sort of, I am friends with him. It's weird to refer to your friends by their last names."
"Potter!? What in Merlin's name are you bloody doing here!?" Draco shouldn't sound so angry, because he frankly liked Harry's presence. It was just the fact that he was in utter shock.
Harry was freaking out right now.
"I'm fine... but I'm not so sure you're going to be..."
But, that made Draco feel kind of sad. It's not that Luna isn't a nice girl- she shouldn't be a last resort.
"Ron, I told you what Draco said to me. He was serious. Just drop your hatred for them already, we're not children anymore. We fought in a war together."
Ron looked at him with bewilderment. "Sure, Malfoy."
"Good, I'm glad we're on the same page then." Harry turned on his heels and walked away.
Draco was, of course, freaking out because what did he do? Was the hug weird? Of course it was what was he thinking? Well, he was thinking that Harry looked really cute and ... UGH. Were him and Harry not cool like he thought they were?
"Of course..."
"Apologize for...?" Harry looked so genuinely confused, and Draco couldn't blame him. His sudden outburst of an apology was news to him as well.
So all Draco wanted was to shag... that sucked to hear. He didn't even want a relationship, just wanted to hook up.
"The whole bloody part!" She exclaimed.
guys they are just friends !!!!!1111!!!!!111!!!!!!!
They stayed there for roughly 10 more minutes, neither one of them was counting. When they were done, Harry pulled his pants back up and Draco did the same, performing a cleaning charm.
"What the hell?" he said to himself.
"Is it... about the rumors?" Hermione asked sheepishly.
look from Hermione. "We weren't late!" Ron hissed. Hermione just rolled her eyes. Ron took his place by her and Harry went to his seat next to Draco.
And, Draco was right; Harry was flying on his broom.
"Want to go to the Pitch?" Draco asked him
"Oh-yes. I just have a headache and I'm really not feeling well. Any chance I could lay down?
"...Still lost on how this ties in to Harry and Malfoy..." Ginny said.
"Yeah, sure. I'm going to go to bed..." He heard her muttering something like 'all these blasted Gryffindors' as she headed up the steps. He smiled and headed to his favorite seat and where he left his book on the table next to it.
Harry
"Me too, I was about to anyway." Ron added.
I loved writing this chapter. Also, the soulmate thing between Ron and Harry- so pure. Friendships are so important and my best friend is definitely my soulmate so... just love that for them, so cute.
"Uhm, you're welcome! People were about to start leaving for classes now and I'm not sure what people would say if they walked out and saw what I just did!" Draco blushed and rubbed his forehead.
"Blaise, can I ask your advice on something?"
"I would say the same to you, but it looks like you've marked Draco more than he did you." Again, Draco blushed. Harry just addressed him by his first name... he's never done that... Even though they're not technically 'enemies' anymore they have never called each other 'Draco' and 'Harry'... not out loud at least.
"Uh-... you! You know... and your girlfriend. Yeah..." Harry looked at him disbelievingly, but then shrugged.
Draco looked back up and Seamus had already moved on to something else, but he made eye contact with Hermione, who had a look in her eyes he couldn't really decipher.
"I thought... I didn't... I'm so in love with you." Harry said. "Gods I'm in love with you. Like crazy love. The kind of love that doesn't even make sense. That kind... I'm in love with you and it just... I was being... I was trying to protect my heart I guess because I knew you didn't-." Suddenly Draco's lips were on his and all the words that Harry was about to say were swallowed by this kiss, but Harry couldn't have cared less. The feeling of Draco's lips on his again was all he's ever need. They broke apart and Harry looked at Draco waiting for some sort of explanation.
"Yes?"
"Yeah?"
"Are you sure you want to see this?" Draco asked when McGonagall had left, "Because, honestly, it's um... a little embarrassing for both of us and you probably just don't want to remember anyway, you know what I mean? I think you're better off just not knowing and-" Draco had been rambling and Harry cut him off.
He looked at Draco, not with pity, but with a mutual understanding. Harry knew about nightmares alright. He used to use silencing charms too until one morning when Ron was calling for Harry and pulled his curtains open only to find Harry in the midst of one screaming silently. Ron made Harry promise to never use them again.
"Harry! Perfect timing, we are talking about going to Hogsmeade later for a good time! You in?" Harry thought about it and decided that it sounded perfect. It was just what he needed to get his mind off of Draco for a night.
"Today we are going to be doing friendship exercises between the houses and between each other. You may choose your partner... but a Gryffindor must be with a Slytherin, a Slytherin with a Gryffindor. I will give you a list of questions, topics- things to talk about. You have 2 hours. You must write me a nice little report about what you learned about your partner and give it to me when you arrive back from holidays. Any questions? No, wonderful."
"Good, then." Hermione stated firmly. "Ron we're still going to Hogsmeade tonight, yes?"
Everyone sat silently for a second and Hermione looked quite pleased with herself. Ron looked at her like she had 3 heads, but eventually looked at her with loving eyes and kissed her on the cheek.
"Of course we can invite Ginny." Harry said. Everyone looked at him strangely, a
"I'll miss you too."
But, on the outside he stayed calm… as calm as he could… and simply said, “Oh… why?”
"Will you two just bloody shag already? I'm getting bored of this. Shag. Then we can all move on with our lives." Pansy joined.
"Which part?"
"Well... uh-wow... I wasn't expecting this, like ever." He chuckled. "Thank you, Mal-Draco... that means a lot to me. I forgive you... I would like to apologize to you as well. I wasn't exactly an angel either." He locked eyes with Draco and it seemed like time stopped. Maybe he was crazy, but he swore that Harry was looking at him with the same sort of longing that Draco was looking at Harry with.
"I-I'm-I'm fine! I just don't feel too great. And, I have a headache... I'm gonna go to Pomfrey." It wasn't exactly a lie... he did have a headache... but it was manageable. Ron and Hermione gave each other a knowing look but didn't protest as Harry practically ran out of the room.
"Okay, okay... I get it. I understand that you don't feel like that, but you have to admit that's why everyone else is drawn to me."
"I just want you to know... that-well... I should have never treated you and Weas-Ron the way I did... and I'm-I'm so sorry and ashamed. I am a prejudiced, awful human being." Draco looked regretfully at Hermione as he said this.
"We are going to be late and our friends are going to kill us." Harry said, a bit let down.
"I don't know why he won't just tell me what's wrong. I have been begging him to for days but all I get is 'I'm fine, Ron'. He's clearly not fine."
"Harry!" He looked to see Ron heading over to him with a look of sheer terror on his face.
When he turned around he saw Draco standing there. He was looking so beautiful. Perhaps beautiful isn't a word to be used for men, Harry thinks that's dumb... because he's never seen someone as beautiful as Draco Malfoy.
"You knew!?"
"Uh... yeah..."
disclaimer: there is (VERY MINIMAL) adult-y content in this chapter. like MINIMAL. like idk if i should even be making a disclaimer but i don't want anyone to be uncomfortable (:
"Harry James Potter this is not funny!" She practically yelled.
"We should get back to the booth. Everyone's probably wondering where we are."
"Oh... well... I'm not too sure you want to hear it," Draco laughed, "you were quite insane." Harry blushed.
"You look like you're about ready to kill someone. If you asked me I'd say you were jealous of what's going on in there." He laughed along with a few others.
"How do you know you ruined everything? You don't know what Harry's thinking. What if he ... liked it?"
"You look fucked. Literally." Draco said, making Harry turn bright red.
When they got to her office Draco looked expectantly at Harry.. as if Harry had the password...
He couldn't quite believe this was real. He kept looking around, trying to find the joke... the prank. He isn't this lucky. He's not this fortunate. He doesn't deserve this wonderful man sitting next to him, smiling with that- he certainly doesn't deserve that smile.
The rest of the day went as it usually did, but Draco noticed that Harry seemed to be a bit on edge in Potions. Whenever he made he slightest eye contact with Harry he could see it in his eyes that he freaked out and then would just, very pointedly not look at him.
alsoooo i have hermione's pov in this chapter because i thought it would be fun, let me know if you like that or if i should stick to harry and draco's.
"Yes, yes, I'm fine. It's nothing like that. I just... I have something to tell you but you
"What about Bill?" Hermione asked. She was shocked, Bill is a great teacher.
This was going to be a long night.
"Who wants to start?" Seamus said.
"No, not to me anyway." Draco lighted punched his shoulder.
"What's going on? Are you okay?"
"Nothing is going on, Blaise." Draco said when he felt his friend's eyes on him.
"Uh, yeah? What's up, Malfoy?"
(See the end of the chapter for
"Yeah... wait... you don't think there's someone else he likes, do you? Do you think he would feel weird talking to me about it because of Ginny. Or maybe it's a bloke and that's why he-" Ron stopped so suddenly that it halted Hermione and Draco.
"I understand, it's fine."
"Okay, okay 'O, brother of mine', I don't need to see you make out with your girlfriend." Ginny said while throwing a piece of bacon at his face. Ron picked up the bacon and ate it. There was a comfortable silence for a while.
"Uh-... 1 in 15, I guess..."
"Hmm... I don't know..."
Luna looked up at him, not showing any kind of anger or frustration, so that was good at least.
"Here you go, Mr. Potter! Mr. Malfoy, what are you doing here? Get to class. You can see Mr. Potter during the regular visiting hours, off you go! Shoo!"
"What? Why?" Ron questioned.
"But you're my best friend, and I love you. Draco has apologized to me and we're friends now. I don't want to be someone who holds grudges anymore. It’s... it’s childish...and if you're happy then so am I." Hermione said, eyes shining with determination. "I've never seen you happier than when you talk about him or you're in the same room as him or when he's mentioned. You... you're in love with him and he's in love with you too if you would just open your eyes."
She laughed, kindly, and just said "Talk to ya later, Pans" as she walked away.
"No... Draco and I aren't... well, we were making out... but we aren't together. I like him, but he has the hots for someone else." Harry looked up.
, Ok?" Draco said, blushing even harder.
and he knew Pansy was right. But he was too weak to stop seeing Harry… he couldn’t be the one to end it.
"You don't know how he feels about you. Ask him." Ron said after a long pause.
" He breathed out as if he had said that all in one breath and Harry just looked at him in awe.
"No...sleep, goodnight." He replied, rolling over in his bed.
"Well, that was awkward. Thanks a lot Seamus." Harry looked back to see Ron sprinting away.
"I-we... I apologized... and then I hugged him and he hugged me back and it was... nothing. Calm down."
As Ron was drunkenly telling them something that he thought was hilarious, Draco noticed a blonde waitress talking to Potter. She was gorgeous... and clearly flirting with him. Something started boiling inside of him and he wriggled out of Ron's grasp and made his way to the washroom.
"You too Draco." Harry gave him one last kiss before they made their way back into The Great Hall.
Draco was fuming. Blaise and Harry were currently in the other room making out because Pansy decided that would be a fun thing to do. Everyone was laughing and just thought it was so funny. How could people be laughing when Blaise was in the next room making out with Harry freaking Potter!? Blaise. His best friend. Making out. With Harry Potter. Draco was going to be sick. Fuck 'The Bonding Thing'!
"That's amazing Gin, I really am happy for you. Are you guys going to tell people?"
"Alright... well this was ... Uh, effective... But, it's late so we better head to bed. Goodnight everyone..." And Ron and Hermione led a non moving Harry up to his and Ron's room.
"How about Miss. Parkinson and... Mr. Weasley?" Bill said a hint of a smirk on his face.
"Do that to who?"
"Okay, okay... back to Malfoy then!"
He saw the blush.
Harry
Draco rubbed his temple. "Well...if you-uh... if you must know... I-well... Potter, I swear to Merlin if you repeat this to anyone I'll hex your balls off, but I have nightmares... really bad ones were I end up screaming most nights... and well I'm not allowed to use spells outside of class on my probation... so I can't use a silencing charm..." Draco didn't know how to continue and now it was Harry's turn to stare.
"Thank you, Hermione... I don't deserve it, but thank you." She let go of his hands, flashed him another smile and headed towards the stairs again.
"Pans, I think you'll forgive me when out when I tell you what I found out." He smirked and her expression changed.
Draco thought. He supposed so, but he can't help by being confused about how right this all feels. They arrived back to the castle and made their way to the 8th year common room to find Pansy, Blaise, Hermione and Ron all passed out on the couches and chairs, most likely waiting up to question them about their night.
"Blaise what the fu-!?" A hand went over Draco's mouth.
"It's been two years, if he isn't on board yet I don't know if he will be" Harry walked past his friends and hurried to History of Magic.
"I don't think there was much to change. I think he worshiped his father as a child, as most children do, and thought that he was right. Once he started thinking for himself he understood pretty quickly that it's not right. He called Ron and myself- and you, horrible things. He did bad things. We all have. I think that I am grown enough to look at things objectively. War makes people do shitty things." Harry just looked at her in awe. He wanted to say something meaningful to her but he's never had a way with words.
"Of course that's what I want..."
"You're both right of course, but I can't stop. I just... can't. I don't have it in me. Once the end of the year hits we will be forced to break it off so it'll just wait till then. Or when he breaks it off with me- whichever comes first." Draco rolled over on his side away from Blaise, but didn't miss the sad, smile Blaise gave him before he got up and went to the loo.
"Not at all. My favorite memory is when my mother read to me. It's not one particular day or time, but it's something I'll never forget. My parents, as you know, aren't the most affectionate. But, my mother could be. When she isn't trying to look brave or tough in front of my father she is the most affectionate person I know. It's silly but sometimes I wish that she would still read to me... but she's probably just disappointed in who I am. I'm a disappointment."
"And why did you stop kissing me, may I ask?" Draco said, pouting slightly. Draco was too adorable for his own good sometimes.
"Sorry, mate, I'm with Hermione and Draco on this one," Harry said to his best friend as he looked at Ginny, unbelieving that Ron was so against it, "I think it'll be a good idea. This house against house crap is really dumb." Harry looked back towards him and Hermione. He wasn't just saying this to get points with Hermione, he really thought the whole 'house prejudice' stuff was bullshit.
"Oh really?" Draco started. "Blaise and Pansy told me to meet them here."
"And what about 'The Chosen One's Girlfriend? Famous by default?" He joked.
"I love you... you know that?"
"He is. They're good for each other. And, anyway... they're 'not dating'."
Draco had fallen asleep in the common room and woke up confused as hell. His neck hurt and he had no idea what time it was. He looked over and Hermione was sitting on the couch with Ron as they were having a conversation.
"I-I...it's..." Harry's face was as red as Ginny's hair and he just kept stuttering over his words.
that he was everything to her.
"It's not like it means anything... it's just wanking, we've all done it." People joined in Harry's coercing and Pansy leaned over to Draco.
"The feeling of knowing you can't have the person you want." Blaise looked up to Draco as he said that.
Hahahahahahah cliffhangers sorry (; By the way, What Are The Odds is an American game, I've never played it but my friend told me about it and it seemed really fun so I included it. I hope you enjoyed this chapter! Let me know what you'd like to see in the next ones! (:
"Oh shut up, if you're starting a pity party I'm uninviting myself." Pansy knocked his head off her shoulder.
"Y-yeah... yes I know. I- so was I." Harry managed to get out.
"What do you mean?" Harry said.  Hermione said nothing. "Hermione?"
"I'll see you guys in the common room... or at lunch. Whichever comes first." Blaise said, walking away. He wasn't facing them anymore but Draco could feel the smirk radiating off of him.
"Good point there. What time is it?" He asked.
a big shocker coming your way- harry is oblivious. i KNOW you're surprised lol.
He couldn't have kept a calm face if he wanted to. There was no way. No way. He couldn't do that, he would be humiliated.
"No... but, thank you for proving my point." She said as she took a bite of her sandwich. He blushed profusely and sunk down in his chair.
Draco looked incredulous and then scoffed to cover his bewilderment, "Yes, well you fought and you're our war hero, The bloody Chosen One, Mr. Pretentious that we all know and love, but I'm nothing but a bloody coward." he saw Harry blush again and that made him smile a bit and Harry opened his mouth to protest something but Draco continued before he could ,"Off you go now, Potter." He wanted Harry to stay more than anything.
"I like you, as well. Funny how people surprise you, isn't it?" She asked.
"Right. Harry... are you going to be okay without us there?" Hermione asked him. "I feel terrible. You are welcome to come too."
"You said perfect about a hundred times just now... and I am not perfect... I- oh... oh...oh!"
"What's up, Draco?" Pansy asked, her voice spiked with interest.
?" Draco smiled. "I really am sorry. You're an amazing friend, you're practically family. I don't even deserve you. You're right... I've been a right awful friend to you. I'll be better, I promise." He said, reaching his arms out to hug her. She complied and went in for a deep hug, her head resting at his shoulder as she was engulfed by his arms. When they pulled apart she kissed him on the cheek and sat on the desk opposite of him.
"House Unity and whatever, McGonagall wants all of the 8th year students to have a 'bonding night' so that includes all the Gryffindorks." Pansy looked pleased with herself for the pun.
"What a proper gentleman. Harry is quite lucky." Luna said, as if it wasn't a secret.
"I think that's a good idea, Hermione." Neville said. He walked over to the Slytherins and sat down next to Pansy.
He was expecting his friends to be surprised or shocked in some way, but really they just looked at one another and shrugged like this was old news.
Hermione and Ron blushed. Ron grabbed her hand and said, "I reckon that she's the best thing that's ever happened to me and I'd be lucky if I had her forever." Hermione kissed him chastely on the lips after that. "I love you" She whispered to him. "Love you more" He answered.
"No more remarks about me, Drakey?" Blaise cooed, quietly so only Draco could hear his taunts. "Saviour got your tongue? Hmm...well, I guess you wish?" Draco kicked him under the table and muttered a 'shut up' before indulging in his eggs.
Somehow he ended up in the library and he wasn't exactly sure how or why but he didn't care at this point. He sat down at an empty table and put his face in his hands. Some time later he heard footsteps but didn't care enough to see who it was.
"I see."
"I- thank you." Draco said dumbly.
"I wanted to talk to about something... more so... about what I want... I guess... with you... I'm not making sense... I-"
"Malfoy, this is about you. Spill."
"Seriously? Wow, you're amazing." Harry leaned in to kiss her, but she backed away quickly. He looked at her confused.
"I... yes. I like him. But, like I said... it's nothing serious." Harry responded.
him- but at least tell him you like him more than just," Ron made a face, "
"Oh, fuck off Goyle. You're pathetic. Yeah, I was a right dickhead. But, I apologized and I am making up for it. People can change... at least if you want to. But, clearly you're just a weak, pathetic excuse for a Slytherin." Draco got up and turned to leave when Goyle grabbed his shoulder to turn him and punched him square in the face.
"I didn't dump him..."
"Like you're one to talk, Zabini."
Harry looked over at his two best friends sitting across from him at the table. Hermione was practically in Ron's lap. They were happy, in love, and stealing kisses off of each other continuously. Hermione was reading a book that Harry didn't care enough to learn the title, and Ron was eating his breakfast.
"Of course I have, Malfoy. I just don't particularly want to think about your's or Zabini's mouth." Harry replied, impressed with himself that he didn't stutter at all.
"I think it's a great idea," Hermione chimed in, "We have been in the same year, some classes together for 8 years and I hardly know any of you. Even some in my own house."
Classes were finally over and he could head to the common room and just relax- oh shit he forgot... The Bonding Thing. Well, so much for relaxing... He decided he didn't want to be in the common just yet and took the long way back.
Harry blushed and looked awkwardly at Ron who was definitely
"Wow, thanks Parkinson." Ron said, in good humour because he and Harry and Hermione were all laughing.
"That was my opener." Ron joked. It made Harry smile because clearly his friend didn't completely hate him... maybe. They walked over to the couch by the fireplace and sat down.
"You know me so well."
"That our friends were right... and we'll never hear the end of it." Draco said, pulling Harry closer to him in his arms. Harry pulled back slightly, just enough so he could look at Draco.
Draco scoffed, "Yes, well you fought and you're our war hero, The bloody Chosen One, Mr. Pretentious that we all know and love, but I'm nothing but a bloody coward." Harry flushed at the word 'love', and was about to open his mouth to protest the whole 'coward' thing when Draco cut him off. "Off you go now, Potter."
"Fine." He replied shortly.
"Who are you interested in, Malfoy?" Ron asked.
Did this mean Draco liked him ??? Draco kissed him. Him!!!  Draco Malfoy kissed him, Harry Potter.
"Something wrong, love?" Harry asked him.
"Of course."
"Yes, but I wasn't late to potions class."
No. No, Draco. Don't get your hopes up yet. You've been pining for years, (even though you didn't realize it...) so just keep your hopes down until you know for sure.
"Wh-what? Who are you talking about?" Draco looked like he was going to throw up.
When they pulled apart it seemed like the fastest kiss, but most meaningful and slow kiss he ever had. They looked at each other before Draco got up, grabbed Blaise and went up to what he can only assume to be their dorm room.
What are you up to Blaise? Draco was thinking as he followed him out of the room. He kept quiet as he followed him all the way to the... Gryffindor common room??? What the hell is Blaise doing going to -
"Sounds good to me Blaise... so that means Harry and Draco. Wow... who could guess." Ron replied.
"Sure, we have 2 minutes to spare. What's up?"
"Yeah, Blaise said he found out, but was keeping it secret for us. Why do you ask?"
"Ha-oh Hello, Draco! I was looking for Harry I can't find him...are you alright?"
"I think we'll pass. How much longer do we have?"
"Don't worry, you only fell asleep for about 20 minutes. Ron and Ginny are still talking. I haven't heard any screaming or curses though, so that's a good sign."
He ended up going to the Room of Requirement. He started towards the wall, that would soon show a door, but stopped when he saw Draco Malfoy heading the same way. Draco is a prefect so I guess it's normal for him to be out after hours, but why was he going to the Room of Requirement?
"It was- fine. Normal."
Damn Potter for being so cute, Draco thought. He really wasn't going to make this easy on him was he?
"Hermione- don't start, Ok? I know it in my heart so just... leave it be." Harry said quickly, before she could say anything else.
"Would it be okay if I wrote you?" Draco asked, looking down at his lap.
"Yes, we fought in a war! The bloody Slytherins were who we were fighting in the-"
"Uh, okay. Never Have I Ever ... um.... I don't know...I'm not- ...very good at this game..." Draco said lamely.
"...Or he was hoping you'd have a pair of balls and say '
"Wha-"
"Inter.....interesting...uh... that's cool... uh, that's good. Uh, I'm gonna go and find Blaise he was gonna lend me a ... a... a- thing... so I gotta go. It was... uh, good... talking to you, I'll see you around? Okay, bye." And he got up and practically ran out of the common room.
"You okay there?" Pansy asked him with a smirk on her face.
"What... about it?" Draco asked.
"Understandable."
"Save it. You're shagging Potter, right?" She said. Draco gave her a glare, but shook his head for yes.
at lunch... and
"He didn't sleep well? Nightmares?" Ron looked at him confused for a moment before nodding.
"Alright... just don't think differently about me after you see it. Everyone was really drunk..." Draco said, while blushing.
"Shut it... yes. But, you are not off the hook about telling me all about Malfoy... I mean, Draco. How the hell did this happen?"
, and his family. His family includes Harry.
Their lips touched and people were 'Whoo Hoo-ing' but Harry couldn't hear them, he was lost in Draco's mouth. His lips felt exactly like he imagined, though nothing like he ever dreamed of. His tongue swept over Harry's bottom lip, asking for entrance. Without thinking, simply because he couldn't think, he opened his mouth to allow him to enter.
"I shouldn't have kept it from you..."
"Why do you sit by me everyday?" Draco blurts out, startling Luna from the paper she was reading, no doubt.
Harry came in close to when class was starting as usual, and of course followed shortly by Draco.
"We uh- we didn't want to risk it. Anyway, I need to go change and I'm sure Harry does too, so be back in a jiffy." They both rushed upstairs. Draco put on one of his nicest outfits, gelled his hair back, and hoped he didn't look as fucked as he did 5 minutes ago.
"You may not have blood family, but you have a family that you've chosen, and who've chosen you too. In a way, that's better. You're not just stuck with people that you share blood with- you were chosen, and not in an almighty way... in a love way."
“Love, you’re being a bit too obvious that you’re waiting for someone to walk through the common room door…” Pansy said to Draco as they were sitting in front of the fireplace. Draco knew this, and, quite honestly? He didn’t care. These two weeks without Harry have been terrible. Yes, he wrote to him and Harry wrote back, but it just wasn’t the same as being able to hold him… to kiss him. Was he being dramatic? Definitely, but he didn’t care. He just wanted to see Harry.
"Harry!" Hermione's voice broke him out of his thoughts.
"Right. See you... uh, back at the table..." Draco walked past Ron and out the washroom without looking back.
"I- don't have words. I will just- um... Minnie found us and told us that she's letting us go early... so you're free to go... or come. Like... come with us not- you know... I'm gonna go. I'll see you Harry. Malfoy. Bye!" Ron practically ran in the direction of the school.
They walked back, hand in hand, and both couldn't stop smiling. They just talked the whole way back, about everything... nothing... just anything that happened to pop into their heads.
"Your boyfriend? Hm... I quite like how it sounds." Draco said, grinning madly. "Me, Draco Malfoy, the Golden Boy's boyfriend."
"Why don't... why don't I just show you?" Draco grabbed Harry's hand, muttered a cleansing spell over himself and led Harry out of the Room of Requirement.
"Didn't look like nothing." Pansy said while making her way towards the potions classroom. Draco heard her, but she wasn't trying to be quiet anyway.
"I can live with that." She said. She kissed him on the cheek, handed him an extra hangover potion, and left the common room.
I'm an awful human being
, he thought. But, what was the point in lying and digging himself in a deeper hole.
." Harry finished shyly.
"Okay, 3,2,1" The number 15 radiated through the room, as it came out of both of their mouths.
Draco watched him leave, and went back over to the bed and laid down. It took awhile to fall asleep but once he did he slept wonderfully.
But he also didn't understand what he was talking about. Draco could say with utmost confidence that he didn't have a crush on anyone... maybe...
"I am not doubting your story, Mister Potter. However, Goyle is laying in a hospital bed because of your behavior. I will have a strong talking with Mister Goyle when he regains consciousness, but that still does not condone punching another student! Am I understood?"
just tell each other how you feel already you idiots!!!
. "So... what does this mean then?"
... How stupid was Harry for thinking that they could possibly have a relationship.
"Malfoy we are going to be late if you don't haul ass to the showers. You don't want Potter to see you with un-gelled hair..." He did a dramatic gasp and hit Draco with a pillow. "Get up!"
"Hello, Draco." Harry said, very formally. It struck a nerve through Draco but he decided to ignore it.
"Hey 'Mione." He greeted and rested his head on her shoulder. "What're you reading?"
"Where are you going? We just got here." Draco asked, confusion obvious on his face.
"Do you think he hates me? Well, of course he hates me, he already did anyway. He probably hates me even more. We were just starting to get along finally and then I ruined it all-"
"Oh-hey...uh...what are you doing here?"
"I-I don't know..." Draco started.
"Easy. My eleventh birthday. That's when everything changed, that's when... when my life felt like it mattered... it probably sounds dumb to you, right?" Harry was looking down at his lap, seemingly very self-conscious about himself.
Harry
"Thanks for that... so... what are you doing here?" Draco said, looking down at his own lap.
"Right now. Go tell Draco you're taking him out tonight. Do not take no for an answer. Tell Draco to meet you at 6pm, and you two meet 'Mione and I at Hogshead by 5pm." Blaise and Pansy nodded and walked off to carry out their part of Mission Harry and Draco are Idiots.
"Why would Filch care it's not even close to curfew." Hermione asked, a humorous look in her eyes.
"This is... Ok... well obviously something's going on." Harry said.
"You know what? I forgot my wallet in my room, I'll be right back." He headed up to the boys dorms and stopped in his tracks when he heard a familiar voice.
"I can't believe this." was all Draco could say.
"Uh, right. Well, that doesn't explain why you followed me in here." Draco tried not to sound too rumpled.
"Oh, I-uh... Don't worry. I won't say anything to Harry. And, it's not like I care... I'm gay."
their friends are tired of seeing them be so oblivious and so hurt.
"Oh... gods... what must Ha-Potter.... be thinking... oh fuck fuck fuck....." Draco's head was spinning. This is a disaster. I mean he wouldn't mind it if him and Potter had a thing... but if people were going to be talking about him he would prefer it to be true.
"Um... Draco?" Harry said quietly. Nothing. "Draco?" He said a little louder this time. Draco shot up from his pillow and looked confusedly around the room.
"It was awful. You should have seen his face, I felt terrible for him." Draco replied.
"She knew holidays started on Monday... but gave us 3 weeks detention?" Draco asked, confused.
"Harry!" Draco called. He seemed to have jumped, but looked down and saw Draco. He flew down and landed.
"You... you told them that we're d...oing- hooking up?" Harry's face fell, but he hoped Draco didn't notice. It really is just about hooking up for him isn't it? How can this be everything to him and nothing to Draco?
But, there was no point in lying to Hermione- she knew, he could tell she knew. Of course Ron and Harry had that previous conversation about Harry liking Draco... but it was vague. For Harry to be outwardly admitting it... well, it probably took Ron a bit by surprise.
" Uh... yeah..." He replied as he felt his cheeks heat up again.
"Bill said that he was 'keeping the spot warm for me' and really wants to teach Charms, since Professor Flitwick is just going to direct the choir. He said that he thinks I would be the best DADA professor Hogwarts has ever had and McGonagall agreed. I don't know about all that...I mean I hit Voldemort with a couple Stupefy's and Expelliarmus's..." Harry said.
. He also wasn't sure if you could call it kissing since they were kind of swallowing each other.
"Uh... 1 in 15..."
"Harry, are you alright?" Harry looked up at Hermione and did a faint smile.
"What are you going to do about it?"
"Alright, Headmistress we will see you in 2 hours, Au Revior!" Blaise said, grabbing Ron and escorting him out of the room.
"How could it be cheerful and nonsupporting at the same time?" Harry asked, confused.
"The rules of the game, Harry..."
"I missed you too, Gin." And he pulled her in for a short, but loving kiss. "Sorry, were you getting ready to shower?"
There was awkward silence for what seemed like an eternity and then Ron, of all people, started clapping. This triggered everyone else to begin and eventually it was just an eruption of applause. Draco blushed profusely.
Draco
Forgot his quill? Yeah, right. Draco thought. Blaise had never kept a secret from him, and he'd be damned if he thought he was going to start now. Draco got up, ignoring Pansy's protests and promptly followed Blaise out of the common room.
"Oh what? You can't enjoy love because you are too busy ogling over You -Know -Who... And not Voldemort everyone!" Pansy laughed while Draco blushed madly.
"Sure, why not?" He smiled.
“Deprive you of my friendship.” Draco smirked, his signature Malfoy smirk attempting to hide the hurt he felt. Harry smiled a genuine smile at him that made Draco’s heart jump.
"I am and he is." Ginny said simply. And that was that.
"I-am I... it's nothing you haven't seen before... is something wrong?"
"-Like him?" Ron finished for him, "Malfoy, Harry? Really? I mean, you really know how to pick them. First, my sister. Then, the person who made our lives hell for 7 years. Nice job!"
' Or something
He followed her to a deserted classroom and had to pretty much run to keep up with her angry walking.
Hermione knew that Harry and Draco were together. She didn't know in what sense of the word... but she knew. How? Well, for one- there's usually nothing she doesn't know. Two, she observes. The excessive flirting, the hickey's they forget to glamour, the sneaking off. Ron? Well, he's not that observant; but that's why he has Hermione.
"What's so bad about being a bloody hero, mate?" Seamus piped up.
