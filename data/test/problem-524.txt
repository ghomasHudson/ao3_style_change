The moment he steps inside, calmness floods his mind, and he thinks he understands what Potter was saying. He hasn’t returned here since the time they fought, and that time he didn’t have the luxury of relaxing and letting the energy in the room soothe him.
“No,” Malfoy says. “Pansy’s been nagging at me to come to one of these things for months, actually. She keeps complaining about missing me, and if I want to visit with her, that means visiting with Ginevra as well—who isn’t so bad, actually—but with Ginevra comes you and Granger and your whole slew of friends.” He lets out a sigh. “Anyway, what I’m trying to say is I think Pansy would be rather angry if you and I got smashed and started a duel later on, you know?”
The jealousy that rises like bile in his stomach feels almost like a friend now. Harry shakes his head rapidly. “I don’t think I want to know who it is,” he says. “It hurts too much.”
Harry told him about Will, about the ex-boyfriend he proposed to. On the Amortentia, it makes Draco incredibly jealous, but even off the potion he can admit that the other man was stupid for leaving. Harry is an incredibly attentive lover, he’s come to find out. He used to think him oblivious and simple-minded, back in school, but it turns out that when Harry cares about you—well, he doesn’t miss things, that’s for sure.
“I have, one time before you came in. There are loads of things, I could—I could put a cock ring on you, or blindfold you, or make you fuck yourself with a dildo while I watch—”
It takes a few minutes before Draco finally turns his head to look at him. For the first time, Harry realizes that it looks like Draco’s been crying, and his heart pulses in sympathy.
Instead, Harry sits down a few feet away from him, leaning backwards, his hands pressing into the plush carpet. “How’d you know it was me?”
Draco cuts him off with a kiss, the softest one they’ve ever shared. “Let me pretend to love you,” he says, “Just for now.”
As much as he wants Potter to love him, he’s not a fool enough to think that he’s more important than the war itself. But that doesn’t stop him from ignoring the lurch of guilt and curling his arms around Potter anyway.
What he didn’t plan on was this: discussing logistics with Potter in a shitty Muggle motel room and arguing their way into a petty disagreement on how best to extract Teddy without the Dark Lord noticing.
The rest of his day is exceedingly normal, if by normal he means being bored to tears while attempting to skim more texts about Death. He thought this would be cathartic, thought it would give him
Then somehow they’re rutting against each other, thoroughly snogging, the sound of their panting filling the room. “Can you... you know—like this?” Harry asks, gasping.
Potter’s eyes had been wide, his hand pressed to the front of his jeans, his expression one of undeniable lust. It’s not dissimilar to a daydream Draco had once—well, okay, several times—of Potter watching him wank, his eyes wide behind his glasses, getting so turned on that he couldn’t help but touch himself too.
arse instead of the other way around, and we’ve never talked about that—I could’ve told you to do any number of things with what’s in the cupboard over there—have you ever looked inside?”
“Merlin, Potter,” Draco mutters, a near growl, and it’s all Harry can do to stay upright as he presses Draco against the cold metal of the fridge and kisses him again, Draco’s arm curling around him, his hand sliding warm up the back of Harry’s shirt—
“But you could change your mind. And then I’d just be holding you down,” Draco tells him, shaking his head. “It wouldn’t work.”
The other man shudders. Or maybe it’s just that Harry’s shaking, because he wants it so badly it burns, and fuck, something must be wrong with him. He shouldn’t think this is so hot, but he
The level of pain drops again—it’s now back in debilitating headache territory, as opposed to tempting Draco to rip his brain out as it was a few moments ago.
“I owe you the truth,” Draco says, anxiety nipping at his brain as the potion kicks in. His hands are shaking.
It occurs to Harry that deep in the back of his mind, he wishes Malfoy cared as much about him as he does his ex-wife.
Potter rasps the tip of his tongue against Draco’s arsehole, and then he does it again, again, making Draco clench and squirm. Except then Potter finally,
Harry swallows, then leans forward, resting his head against Draco’s chest. “I know, but… I don’t want to go.”
“Because,” Draco says, sliding his knuckles down Harry’s bare waist, making him shudder—“I feel very—you know. About you. And also we’re still naked and touching and I think I would like to have sex again, and it’s not her I want to be thinking about when we do.”
“Potter, I can practically hear you thinking,” Malfoy says, jolting Harry out of his thoughts. “Go to
Potter looks speculative as he gazes down at him—as if he’s about to say something important—but all too soon that look fades. “Never mind,” Potter says easily, and Draco lets out a breath he wasn’t aware he was holding. “Thanks, Malfoy,” Potter says, waving the file in the air. “I owe you one.”
It’s stronger somehow, without the Amortentia. Maybe because Harry knows it’s truly himself wanting this, instead of just the potion telling him to. Maybe it’s because for once he can finally remember their whole history while they’re kissing, can remember it and
But that’s a lie, isn’t it? He thinks of the last time he was here, remembers having his body up against Potter’s and wanting something more, wanting
“Fuck,” Harry says after, and Malfoy groans and flips them over, rutting into Harry’s hip until he comes too, sobbing out a gasp in Harry’s ear.
He pulls the dildo out and sets it outside the shower. Then he stands in the spray and shuts his eyes, willing the water to wash away this terrible, all-consuming need to touch Potter.
“Ye-es,” Draco says again, his voice cracking with want, and reaches out to grab his wand and hand it to Potter.
“Oh, it will, don’t worry,” Malfoy says, rubbing the head of his cock back and forth against Harry’s arsehole, making him groan. “You’re going to look so good on my cock, Potter,” he murmurs—and the near reverence in his voice shows that this isn’t just some sort of game, or a fucked up power play. It means Harry can close his eyes and bask in the fact that Malfoy wants this just as much as Harry does.
around Harry’s neck, fuck—all of Harry’s senses suddenly zero down to three things: that sudden feeling of dizzy breathlessness in his head, Malfoy’s hand like fire on his skin as he wanks his cock, and the perfectly timed thrusting of Malfoy’s cock inside of him, oh,
Harry quelled his laughter. “I assume it’s dinner time?” he asked. Draco nodded affirmatively, still scowling, though in an obviously lighthearted manner. “May I be dismissed, Professor Langley?”
Harry swallows sharply. “After the second time,” he says. “After the second time, I stopped taking it.”
And of course she was right. He hadn’t been planning on telling anyone for exactly those reasons. Plus because it was Malfoy, but that was a whole different bottle of bat spleens.
) of his school memories weren’t the best. His nightmares were tainted with the deaths of his allies and the bloodshed of his foes.
The memory skips ahead, and then they’re in Draco’s bedroom, watching as Draco and Potter snog each other silly as their bodies hit the mattress. Potter’s on top, kissing Draco, moving further down to suck at Draco’s neck, and fuck if that isn’t sexy—it’s basically like watching porn of themselves, isn’t it?
,” he chokes out, and before he can even start moving forward, Malfoy is on him, embracing him, pulling him to a chest warmer than he’d ever imagined and enveloping him in the smell of lemons and charcoal and musk. It’s only amplified by the fact that the Amortentia in the fountain now smells like Malfoy too, meaning it’s all around him, dizzying Harry as he runs his hands over Malfoy’s back so he can pull him closer.
Malfoy flinches as if the question hurts him, and Harry briefly regrets asking. He knows that feeling all too well—everyone always asks him way too many questions, about Voldemort and his magic and the war, and Harry sure as hell doesn’t know how to answer.
After some time, he falls asleep again. He wakes up mid-afternoon with Mother sitting next to him, face pensive, stroking his hair. “Draco,” she says, and this time he knows he can’t avoid her questions. He looks up at her and waits. Eventually, she sighs. “Are you going to tell me what is going on between you and Mr. Potter?”
“Somehow I doubt that Malfoy ‘being aggravating’ is what put that expression on your face just now,” she shook her head. “You like him, don’t you?”
“I used to think so too,” Harry says. “It took a lot of practice, and I couldn’t have done it without George’s help, either. He knows a ton more about charms theory than I do.”
After that, he tries his best to distract himself from the fact that Potter’s in his house, putting the kettle on and then hiding in the kitchen until it’s done. When he brings the teacups to the sitting room, Potter is sitting in Draco’s usual spot on the sofa.
“We—we can’t,” Draco says—he’s already reduced to gasping for breath and he hasn’t even touched himself yet.
He looks away. “The portrait,” he says instead, heart pounding in his chest. “I’ll... I’ll do it. But—you have to tell me why you’re really asking.”
“Are you sure?” Malfoy asks him, and his voice is steady but his posture betrays his nervousness, the way he's sitting a bit hunched over on the edge of the bed next to Harry. They're in the Room of Requirement, mended over the summer for all intents and purposes, though if Harry thinks about it hard enough he can still smell the faint scent of fire. Tonight, the room has made itself small and cozy, with a bed and a nightstand and a curious cupboard that neither of them has dared to venture into.
“That’s fine,” Malfoy says, voice lacking the sharpness that Harry is used to hearing. Then Malfoy takes out his wand and uncorks the Amortentia, casting a measuring spell that Harry vaguely remembers from Potions class. Two servings neatly aliquot themselves into the waiting shot glasses, filling them nearly to the top, and Harry takes one, staring down at it dubiously.
Fuck. Harry doesn’t know what to do, what to say. It’s awkward, and Harry hadn’t wanted it to be awkward. He wanted to be easy and warm and fun, like the kissing has been, like talking to Draco always is.
, he was not Confunded, and this was definitely not just a pity fuck, and, “I love you, Draco, can’t you fucking see it? I
—he remembers how it felt like the world was ending when Will left. It’s not like that anymore, thank Merlin. And it’ll be okay for Malfoy too—right?
“Hm?” Harry asks. He looks up at Malfoy, guilt swimming in his veins, but is surprised to find vulnerability in Malfoy’s eyes.
“I’m not taking the Amortentia. We’ll just—we’ll just talk,” Harry tells him, but it’s getting harder and harder to believe, especially as he Side-Alongs Malfoy to his flat, shoving past him into the kitchen to put the kettle on.
He’s not expecting Harry to blanch, face so pale he nearly looks like a ghost. “I, er, yeah—the, er, sometimes the steam from the kettle sets off the Fire Alarm Charms, so I like to Vanish it before…”
“I’m afraid I won’t be able to control it,” Draco says, regret in his expression. “Not when I’m... otherwise occupied. And I don’t want to hurt you.”
“Well,” says Four, then chuckles a bit. “I suppose you may be right about you being an unhelpful arse.”
“Sorry,” Malfoy mutters, looking away and taking another drag of his cigarette. Harry doesn’t think he really means the apology, and it puts him a little on edge. “I was caught off guard.”
Harry swallows, because what wants to come out is stupid and revealing and he’s going to say it anyway. “I think I just have a thing for you.”
The fake-Draco in his room is bed-stricken for many days, and then he starts sitting up and eating and occasionally staring at Harry. Harry stares back. He’s not afraid of his demons anymore.
Nodding, Harry tries and fails to resist a shudder. He should tell Hermione that Draco left him. But he doesn’t want to. It hurts too much.
It’s the mark of a magically binding contract, he knows. The Unspeakable Oath isn’t an Unbreakable Vow, or at least there’s no death penalty. But no one has mentioned what exactly happens to those who break it, and Harry’s terribly sure he doesn’t want to find out.
“I want to,” Potter says. Then he makes a face. “I hate this. I’m probably about to say things that I—” He closes his eyes. “Fuck. That I don’t want you to know. But… I want you to know the truth.”
“But I could, Draco. I love being here with you. I love flying with you and swimming with you and watching you be picky about your tea. I’ll never go home again—I don’t want to. There’s nothing left for me there.”
Harry moans and nods, pliant in his hands, shifting his hips until he’s just right. Then he feels the first firm press of Malfoy’s cock against his arsehole and groans, hissing as he presses down and it slips in the first few inches, bottoming out, panting, Malfoy thick in him,
“Neither did I, but here we are,” Draco says. “Now, if you don’t mind, I quite like this job. If you can’t handle it, maybe it would be best if you went to talk to Neville and turned it down after all.”
?’ Malfoy thinks then, and Harry obeys, climbing on top of him to straddle his legs, already growing hard with anticipation. They kiss again, open-mouthed, Malfoy's tongue slick against Harry's own.
Hermione gives him a grateful smile. “Thank you,” she says sincerely. “I suppose I will go to bed, then. Could we meet tomorrow evening?”
Married. It wasn’t the most surprising thing in the world, but it was still a slight shock to actually hear the words from Ron’s mouth. His two best friends in the world were getting married. Another new beginning, another couple his age making their dreams a reality. He swallowed down a sudden and potent thrum of loneliness, hugging them both at once.
“And you do realize that you two will have to remain here over the summer for training in a largely empty castle? Do you think you will be able to refrain from seriously maiming each other?”
Malfoy’s lips thin. “I have a problem with one of your charms,” he says, slipping his hand into the pocket of his robes. Harry notes with interest that the St. Mungo’s insignia is etched onto Malfoy’s right breast pocket—he must work with Hermione then, although the robes aren’t the horrid lime green color like Healers wear. Instead, they’re a much nicer shade of pale blue, but Harry doesn’t have time to think on what profession that might indicate before Malfoy pulls out a silver hairbrush.
had two Unspeakables in the department who have taken the Amortentia together—this is a first for us! That means we have a lot we can learn about its effects…”
“They’re catching on,” Draco says, desperation filling his lungs. What he’s really saying is that Greyback’s pack has caught up to Teddy again, or else he’d never be meeting Potter out of schedule like this, but what he wishes Potter could hear is that he wants Potter to save him—whether from the Dark Lord or from himself, he’s not sure.
Sometimes he thinks he hears Draco’s voice, in corners and behind doors, but he looks in the corners and opens the doors and Draco is nowhere.
Draco frowns, because he thought that Ron knew about the bond, but also Molly and Arthur are within earshot so it’s not like he can correct him. “I suppose it’s rather unexpected.”
“Well, it has a note with your name on it,” Draco says, and indeed, there’s a piece of parchment sticking out of the top.
He won’t have to hate himself every time the potion fades away, hate himself for spilling his secrets to someone who used to be his worst enemy.
Hermione lets out a despairing sigh. “God, first Neville and Blaise, and now you—this is awful,” she says, looking stricken. “If only I had found the cure for this damned thing weeks ago!”
Malfoy—hates him. And to be honest, even though he wouldn’t say he hates him back any longer, that doesn’t mean Harry always
Vaguely, he thinks about the fact that he smells Harry in the Amortentia now, whenever he opens the vial. And why wouldn’t he? Harry is important to him, so fucking important—
Harry resists the urge to growl in annoyance as a cold drop of water drips from his hair down his back. He’d neglected to towel off appropriately before heading off on his crusade for justice from Malfoy. “That’s not the point!” he says, skirting around the fact that his Transfiguration is bollocks and he can’t actually remember ever learning a hair-cleaning charm. “The point is that it was
When Potter shrugs, Draco can feel it. “You barely say anything, and when you do, it’s always just—I dunno. Pleasantries. Like you’re hiding anything that’s actually you.”
He sighed and decided that the only thing to do was to try to steer the conversation away from Malfoy. “So exactly why are we discussing my lack of a love life?”
Swallowing down that bizarre thought, he turned to look at Malfoy, who was wiping the blood off of his lip. “So… can we have a go at not having a go at each other, you think?” he murmured, half-joking and half not.
Peace, though uneasy after the war, had settled snugly around the Wizarding world. Of course the Ministry would want to hold an enormous, ridiculously unnecessary event on the anniversary of the final battle to show everyone just how “good” life was. The triviality left an acrid taste in Harry’s mouth. He didn’t approve of it, especially when the event was outwardly all about him. But then, no one ever really listened to Harry (except concerning stupid acronyms, apparently).
,” Malfoy says in the most insincere voice possible, and Harry braces himself against the anger that wants to erupt from his chest.
cock, long and hard and beautiful, and the way Potter groans when Draco digs his fingers into his hips and sucks him down is enough fodder to wank to for months.
“I’m glad,” Malfoy murmurs, a small smile on his face, and maybe Harry’s wrong. Maybe Malfoy just doesn’t want to hurt his feelings or something.
Malfoy scoffs. “I haven’t spoken to my old school friends in years.” He makes an odd face, one Harry can’t begin to interpret.
‘Do you promise?’ Draco thinks. But the parchment cannot answer. He should bin it, but against his better judgement he puts it in his pocket instead.
“I wasn’t looking at you,” Draco lies, shrinking the new books they’ve just bought on Muggle exotic plants and wiping the smile off of his face.
Harry frowns at him. “No, that’s not—that’s not true. I’d notice if you were gone, and—and I wouldn’t be glad.”
Harry closes his eyes. He’s trapped. If he takes it, he has to go through it all again, the rush of feeling and the warmth and Malfoy in his arms—and the heartbreak of watching Malfoy leave after, of having it tear him to pieces all over again.
. Draco nearly chokes with want and need and the desperate love that wants to claw its way out of him, and he presses back against Potter wantonly, gasping.
Malfoy chuckles. “Fine, if you’re going to make me say it—yes. I want to shag you.” He sighs. “But I can’t, unfortunately. You see why now, right?”
,” Malfoy bursts out, looking pained. “I—I can’t use this with anyone outside of the department, obviously, and I just—I just need to forget—”
“Oh, I—yes, okay,” Potter says, looking surprised as Draco is. His face goes all flushed then, as he turns and briefly disappears into the hallway, and somewhere in the back of his mind, Draco thinks that his obvious embarrassment is endearing.
Even though he’s spent a longer portion of his life than he’d like to admit literally doing just that.
“Thanks, ‘Mione,” Harry says, and means it. “I’m, er, going to the kitchens. Didn’t eat enough during dinner.” It’s only a partial lie—he often doesn’t have much of an appetite, depending on how stuck in the past he is that day. It’s just that he was never planning on going to the kitchens.
“He won’t,” Harry says immediately. “It’d be too easy for him to get caught anyhow, especially now that you know about—well, er. Us.” God, are they an
Harry hates immediately knowing that he’d jump at the chance to do so. “Maybe,” he says instead, casting a discreet Tempus. He’s surprised to realize that it’s nearly two in the morning, and he grimaces, downing the rest of his drink. “I really should go.”
Harry groaned internally, stopping mid-stride and turning around. He had been so close to turning the far corner of the hallway when he first saw her, but he’d apparently been too late. This was the second person in as many days that he had run into late at night while wandering the corridors. Damn it, he knew he should have brought the invisibility cloak, but he had forgotten to pack it. He was sure it was sitting smugly in his wardrobe, laughing at him for not remembering.
Malfoy smirks at him then, which Harry resents. “Upon reflecting, I’ve decided it’s much more fun to rile you up like this than by insulting you,” Malfoy says matter-of-factly.
talk during sex. If I’d known doing this would make you this vocal, I’d have suggested it ages ago.”
“So chivalrous,” Draco says, snorting. But then he stands, tugging Harry up as well. “I suppose if I must.”
Hermione sighs, rolling her eyes in a way Harry’d like to categorize as fond. “I’ll help you, all right?” she says. “But I’m going to start on my own research first.”
“Don’t get your robes all knotted up about it. Just have him Owl me beforehand next time, if you could.”
Briefly, he thinks about what she said to him earlier—that he’s using her as some sort of crutch. That he’s doing everything he can to avoid thinking about the war.
Harry stops talking, clicks his mouth shut, and Draco gets the sense that something is very, very wrong.
.’ And sure, maybe they’re being a little childish, but they’re also currently undergoing the excruciating embarrassment of having to hold hands while they talk to her in order to avoid immense pain, so Draco can’t really find it in himself to care at the moment.
“No!” both Malfoy and Harry say simultaneously, and Hermione looks a bit hurt. “It’s not—thank you, Granger, but it’s... I don’t want to show anyone at this stage,” Malfoy covers quickly.
Harry sucks in a breath, watching as Malfoy wriggles out of his trousers and pants. “Well, since you’ve asked…” he says, and after a moment of thought he picks up his wand, spelling the buttons of Malfoy’s shirt open too. Malfoy gasps, his chest suddenly bare—Harry can just make out the faint scar lines on his chest.
Draco pulls Harry’s body closer, tracing his hands over Harry's chest, and finally lets himself want him.
Draco squints at the mirror for a brief moment, and then he scowls, throwing the scroll to the ground and mentally cursing the fake bloody sentience that goes into these things. “Fine,” he says. “But one perverted comment and I’m Silencing you for good.”
” He raises his wand, casting a Summoning spell, and Harry doesn’t realize what he’s doing until he sees the vial of Amortentia come flying into the room.
Malfoy looks surprised. “How very Slytherin of you, Potter. Yes, it probably would.” His eyes narrow the slightest bit. “But I’m not interested.”
“Funny, I seem to remember that you didn’t really like rules all that much,” Malfoy mutters, smirking.
After that he hurriedly finishes washing himself, bolting out of the shower to towel himself dry. He can’t even
,” Malfoy scoffs, leaning back and tossing one arm carelessly over the back of the booth. “Why don’t I trust you? Besides the fact that you spent half your time at school trying to get me in trouble? I’ve heard about you lately. Always conveniently working jobs down Knockturn, snooping around where you don’t belong. Just like you always were in school, aren’t you? What, are you some undercover Auror?”
“Harry—are you sure?” Hermione asks, grabbing his arm as Harry starts walking toward Malfoy’s table at dinner. They’d stopped sitting with Malfoy up to this point at Harry’s request, and Hermione hadn’t asked for an explanation, but Harry knows she was worried all the same.
“Draco, could you hand me that—that thing over there? You know, the tool with the, erm, the scoopy end—”
Malfoy shrugs. “Potions researchers don’t get notified about these sorts of things. Our group has to hear everything through the gossip mill.”
“I might’ve kept every article with your picture in it,” Draco admits, the edges of his lips quirking.
“I never got to swim in pools when I was younger,” Harry explains. “I had lessons when I was in primary school, but you know the Dursleys.” He pulls a face and pitches his voice into a sing-song-y tone. “They didn’t want me ‘
Scanning the label, he quickly finds the spell to dismantle the packaging and mumbles it out loud, freeing the mirror from its confines. It’s a handsome thing, all intricately carved wood and dark varnish, a bit taller than Draco is, and sturdy—he’s sure Blaise wasn’t at all lying when he implied the thing was expensive.
to answer Potter, wants him to know that it’s his own bloody fault for acting like he cared, because then at least maybe Potter will understand.
Bitterness rubs at him, clenching at his throat, and he swallows the strong medicine of it down. Just one more thing to go wrong in his life, he supposes—like failing at joining the Aurors, or neglecting to go back to Hogwarts, or getting turned down when he proposed to his ex-boyfriend. All of those things got fucked up somehow. What’s one more on top of the pile?
Draco gave a hard swallow. “Don’t answer that. Just… I want you, all right? And… I won’t go away, if we have sex. I… promise,” he said slowly, earnestly. He bit his lip and pulled the blankets off of himself, shifting closer so that their bodies were almost touching.
But Malfoy… he didn’t deserve Azkaban. Harry believed that from the bottom of his heart. Malfoy was like him, was just a lost boy searching for the key to make his life mean something again.
For a split second, Malfoy looks pained, and it catches Harry off guard. “You always have a choice, Potter.”
“I knew it,” Potter says. “I knew you were up to something.” But his eyes don’t go hard like before, and he doesn’t reach for his wand.
Something uncomfortable twists in his stomach, and he shoves that thought as far away as he can get it.
“Wait, no!” Malfoy stops him, already sounding desperate. “It’s just—I suspect that would only make it worse.”
Malfoy’s in the middle of another tirade when Harry scoots close enough to knock their knees together.
Harry can’t wait anymore. He slides his hands into Draco’s hair and kisses him, hot and needy, pulling Draco as close as humanly possible, and oh,
Draco sighs into Potter’s mouth, feeling heady and warm—and suddenly it occurs to him that this could actually end up okay.
Draco’s breath is ragged as he nods. “Fuck, please,” he says, and then Potter grins at him, nudging for Draco to turn around.
“Uh… hello,” Harry says, setting down his wand and the Muggle digital clock he’d been trying to fiddle with. “Is the hairbrush working all right?”
Then Potter finally takes him into his mouth, steadying Draco’s cock with one hand and leaning on the other arm as he sucks him down wetly again, again, and Draco is going to fucking die because this can’t be real. Fuck, he hadn’t even known that Potter was into
“No one. Just some girl,” he lied in more ways than one because Malfoy was not a girl, nor had he ever been simply ‘no one’ to Harry.
Potter groans softly, adding another finger without Draco even asking, and then he moves his attention away from Draco’s prostate, stretching him out in earnest now. Draco’s thankful for that—he’d been nearly ready to come, and he doesn’t want to do that until Potter’s cock is in him. He thinks he’s earned at least that much.
“I mean,” Draco says, flipping his wrist over so that the faint remnants of his Mark are showing. “This isn’t exactly a glowing letter of recommendation.”
A while later, after they've long since lapsed into silence, Harry aims a small, tired smile at Four and says, “Thanks for this.”
“Depends on the hex,” Malfoy answers. “Stunners don’t work that well. Bedroom spells, on the other hand...” His smirk widens.
“Fine. I once vanished your pants when you were showering in the Quidditch locker room,” Draco says, hiding a smirk.
“Maybe,” Potter says, sounding rueful. Then he sighs, dropping his arms from around Draco to stretch.
attempting to murder the Headmaster that year,” Draco says quietly, shivering at Harry’s touch. “And I tried to Crucio you.”
them? Draco still feels a bit sulky knowing that their mutual attraction had been so bloody obvious to everyone around them and yet so invisible to each other.
“Playing dumb, are we now?” Malfoy says, leaning forward, looking highly unimpressed. “Of course I have a fucking shop, Potter. It’s right below my flat, I’m not going to believe you didn’t
It’s occurred to him that this may possibly be her revenge on him for losing all the prophecies years ago. He wouldn’t put it past her.
“Good,” Draco says, leaning so that he can rest his head on Harry’s shoulder. Immediately he feels calm, peaceful in a way he hasn’t been able to feel for weeks. Somewhere in the back of his head, he knows that it’s really, terribly unhealthy to be relying on the potion like this. Especially with someone like Potter.
you,” Malfoy says, and it must be an aftereffect of the potion that makes the words hurt just a little.
, Potter’s pushing his tongue into Draco, and Draco’s so ready that his body barely even resists the intrusion as Potter licks into him again, again, fucking him open, face pressed to Draco’s arse.
But as clever as Hermione is, there are some cases she hasn’t been able to crack. Like Neville’s parents, tortured into madness. She tried and tried for the longest time to coax them back to health, until Neville sat down with her and told her that it was all right, that she could stop trying now, that she should focus on patients with more hopeful outlooks than Alice and Frank Longbottom.
“I’m not very good with words,” Potter says, pressing his mouth against Draco’s cheek, his jaw, his neck, his ear. “And I’m absolute shit at figuring out how I’m feeling.”
. Alarmed, he finishes putting his clothes on, mentally testing the Manor wards—but nothing is out of place, as it would be if someone were trying to encroach on them.
It’s nice to actually be able to talk to someone about what he’s been doing, especially someone who’s taken all the same Unspeakable coursework. It’s nice to feel connected to someone in a way he’s not sure he has since Will left.
Malfoy catches at Harry’s sleeve as they walk out of the Department of Mysteries one night, causing Harry to turn. “Potter,” Malfoy says, and Harry immediately knows what he wants.
” Malfoy says, and the word sounds salacious on his lips. “You mean to say that the great Harry Potter has never given his arse to anyone? Tch—somehow I find that hard to believe.”
Harry shakes his head. “No, not just that—the company, I suppose, and… I dunno, I like talking to you.”
Potter just might be the single most fucking important person to him in this world, and Draco’s gone and ruined it.
Harry doesn’t need to be asked twice. He shudders and kisses Draco once more. Then he pushes Draco to the bed, casting a spell to enlarge it, and climbs on, pressing Draco to the mattress and kissing him until he gasps.
It’s more fervent this time on both sides, Draco crowding him against the wall and licking into his mouth, Harry clutching at Draco’s back and pulling him in tighter. Draco tastes sweet, like alcohol and honey—and then Harry can’t think anymore because Draco bites at Harry’s lip, and Harry can feel the points of his teeth and oh God, oh
He presses Harry up against the wall and kisses him senseless, slipping his tongue into Harry’s mouth and biting at his lips as Harry clutches at him and moans. “Draco,” Harry says, feeling himself harden almost immediately. “Fuck.”
Draco sighs, batting Harry’s hand away as he slides out of bed. He already misses the touch, but there’s nothing to be done about it, is there?
“Mr. Malfoy?” a young Mediwitch gets his attention from behind him, one he remembers from when Astoria was admitted.
“Oh, calm down, Potter,” Malfoy says, his breath ragged. “Don’t worry. I still h-hate you the most.”
’ and he can do nothing but look away, his breath hitching, getting stuck in his throat, and he knows he’s about to fall apart completely but he can at least wait until Potter leaves—
Even under the dim bar lighting, disrupted every so often by the colorful lights from the dance floor, Harry can see Malfoy’s eyes flash at his proximity. “I am,” Malfoy says. “Miss me?”
Potter looks nervous at that, and Draco wonders why until Potter inhales shakily and asks, “Could y-you maybe, er, come c-closer?”
“Easy, easy does it… Good. Now once more, Harry.” Harry’s mentor, Professor Langley, allowed him a moment to relax his shield charm and catch his breath before sending another barrage of curses at him.
But instead, Malfoy sighs, smiling softly at him. “You’ve been apologizing a lot today,” Malfoy says, reaching a hand up to stroke Harry’s face. It makes Harry feel all warm for a moment. “You don’t have to say sorry anymore. I’m sure I have much more to apologize for than you do.”
“Yeah, fuck,” Potter mumbles in his ear, reaching down to hold one of Draco’s hands—and why is he doing
And then he turns and walks swiftly away, as fast as he can without actually running, his heart thumping painfully, his throat burning.
“Sorry,” Potter says, then again, “Sorry.” Then Potter looks at him, eyes green and desperate, and Draco’s saved from falling once more.
to avoid Malfoy, because Malfoy’s been doing a great job at disappearing completely wherever Harry is, even going to bed so early that Harry only ever sees the outside of his closed bed-curtains at night.
“Don’t say that!” Harry lashes out. He gets up, striding over to the water and jumping in, then purposefully swimming over to the other side. The conversation had set something inside him aflame, and he doesn’t like it one bit.
“I swear there was another torch around here…” Hughes says to himself. “Ah, well, I expect you’ll find it at some point.” He holds out his arm. “Afraid we’ve only got one desk to spare. I’ll bring another chair over.”
“Not now,” he bites out, because he needs to take a fucking shower. He can’t get the scent of Potter out of his nose.
Draco whips around to look at the mirror, but the mirror only shows what’s there in the room, mercifully not breathing a word.
He has to stop himself from gasping audibly when Malfoy drops to his knees, fumbling with the man’s belt, undoing the fastener on his trousers. Harry takes another step, but then, oh fuck—his foot hits a loose rock, and too late he realizes he should’ve cast a Notice-Me-Not as it skitters down the path.
Except then Potter gets up, heading toward the door. “I’ll be back in a second,” he says, leaving Draco blinking as the door shuts behind him.
that they had amazing sex, even if it was just after a drunken party—and maybe it wasn’t quite so amazing for Potter, but Draco’s pretty damn sure he at least enjoyed himself.
“Oh, don’t tell me,” Draco says, deflating as he runs through the possibilities. He’s had enough education on the ways of wizarding society to know how this one goes, but he can’t help but hope that maybe he’ll be wrong.
“I kind of thought we almost were friends,” he says after a pause. “Back in our eighth year, you know?”
“Harry… it’s okay, Harry,” Draco murmured in his ear. “I’m not hurt. It’s okay. I’m not scared anymore, Harry…”
“Will you go to sleep now?” Malfoy asks, sounding just as tired and annoyed as when he walked into the room—but there’s something else now, just the tiniest hint of fondness.
So he sits down at the table, and Mother smiles at him, somehow no sadness to be found. She’s always been better at hiding her emotions than he has.
“Not the worst?” Draco tries, and Harry appreciates him trying to be positive about it but the whole thing is making him so acutely anxious that he doesn’t think he can do the same.
“I’m just fucking lonely,” Malfoy says, a sour expression on his face. “And now I’ve gone and admitted it. Isn’t that fucking pitiful? Almost as pitiful as you are.”
So Potter would Apparate them to his flat, and Draco would spell their clothes off and get inside him as quickly as he could—he could have him on the sofa, or even up against the wall, Merlin. Or—or maybe Potter would fuck him instead, and Draco would—fuck, Draco would fucking love that, having Potter’s cock in him.
“Oh, before I forget,” Adams says, causing them all to look upward again. “Unspeakable Jones has very recently returned home to deal with an unforeseen family emergency. She is in charge of overseeing Apprentices in the Time department, so unfortunately Time will not be an option for this rotation.”
“I’m a bit jealous you’ve been productive,” Malfoy admits eventually. “I haven’t been able to really research anything since Astoria left—everything simply falls out of my brain. I was trying to read about her condition, you know, but.” He sighs, looking briefly dejected, and on impulse, Harry leans closer and kisses his jaw.
“Okay, Potter says, pressing the words into his temple. “You can tell me things, but… but only if you really want to.”
Harry nearly wants to ask if he’ll see him later, after tonight, but Malfoy’s already walking away, and Harry shoves the words back down inside him along with the jealousy balled up in his chest.
That night, he thought about Quirrel. No one really knew what kind of person he had been; his relatives had all died prior to Harry’s first year. Even though Harry had tried, he had never been able to learn anything more of Quirrel’s story, nor of what he could have been like if Voldemort hadn’t tainted him. He was dead now, thanks to Harry.
Resolving to deal with it in the morning, he nods off on the couch, his heart filled to the brim with longing.
“Okay,” Potter says, licking his lips, and then he crouches down and goes right back to eating out Draco’s arse.
Draco wonders if he’d be in love with Potter if Potter hadn’t admitted that. Probably. It was a long time coming.
started it by saying he’d sleep with Harry in the first place, the words that made Harry so utterly unable to think about anything else, anyone else but Draco.
Draco laughs. “Ah. Well…” A casual shrug, a brush of fingers against blond hair, nearly down to Draco’s shoulders now, and the grin that never fails to set his heart beating faster. “You want to swim, then?”
Not for the first time, Draco wonders if Potter has some sort of Seers ability after all. “I’m sorry,” he says quietly. “I nearly thought about it before bed. I should’ve checked.”
Really, should have expected this. His luck is always shit, after all. Part of him wants to object, or scream, or punch something, anything to put a stop to the sudden panic churning in his gut—but instead he simply turns away.
“Even if that were always true, it doesn’t mean I’m not scared,” Harry tells him, and he cares so much about him in that moment that his chest goes tight. “You’re so important to me,” he says then, instead of saying something mad like
Harry smiles at him then, squeezing his hand. And Malfoy smiles back, his gaze growing softer—God, this feels so nice.
“I’m afraid I haven’t had much time to research my topic,” Harry says, feeling breathless as he sits down in the chair opposite McGonagall in her office. “I only just sort of figured it out.”
,” Potter groans out, and Draco can’t meet his eyes so he just focuses on trying to make Potter feel as good as he can. “Fuck, please, Draco—”
He can’t let Malfoy know that, though. He doesn’t want to make himself vulnerable again, only to be let down—not if Malfoy isn’t even interested. So instead of saying some rubbish that would only give his thoughts away, Harry simply Summons one of the Easy-Shrink chairs from the shelves and taps it with his wand so that it grows to its regular size. “What did you want to talk about?” he asks, levitating the chair so it sits near his own stool.
Malfoy fixes him with a thoughtful look. “But you don’t want me to tell you to fuck off,” he says, crossing his ankle over the other knee. “Do you?”
Except there is, apparently. “You two are idiots,” the mirror says. “Why don’t you just fuck in the shower?”
Draco rolls to the side, landing next to him, and then they’re both staring up at the ceiling. “Well,” he says quietly.
“Yes, yes it did,” Hermione says, snapping out of the starry-eyed gaze she’d been aiming at Ron. “It made it really easy to figure out what was going on since I’d already taken a sample from you. All I had to do was compare them, and that took a while because I didn’t have a spell for it, so I had to do it manually—but it worked,” she says again, grinning. “Then I just had to perfect a spell to target that specific part of the DNA, and that was it.”
Potter makes a strange noise, and Draco opens his eyes again to see him shrug. “I dunno,” Potter says. “I’ve, um. Never done this? I mean, I’ve read about it, but…”
Draco nods, closing his eyes. “I really fucking hope so,” he says, and starts walking again. “If it happens again, I should go to the hospital.”
“I wouldn’t have thought you wanted to,” Draco says, and his voice threatens to crack, making him feel hideously vulnerable all of a sudden.
“No, Hermione,” Ginny says. “Please don’t blame yourself. It’s not your fault.” She wrinkles her nose. “And despite the shite that’s in the Prophet, it’s not some other Muggleborn’s curse either, right?”
Which goes to show how worrying it is that Harry hasn’t seen Hermione look so stressed about a case since she’d worked with the Longbottoms.
“No,” Draco says, looking at him desperately. “Please understand, Potter. That’s not it. It’s just—I can’t mate. I can’t. Even if that means losing—losing you, f-fuck.” He buries his face in his knees, shaking.
“Did you…” Malfoy sucks in a breath, eyes bright as they meet Harry’s again. “When you were watching, did you touch yourself?”
He fights down the panic that threatens to rise in his chest. More than anything, he doesn’t want to let anyone down, least of all Hermione and Ron, and they both think he’s going into the Aurors after school. Hence the books Hermione gave him with so much hope in her eyes.
Quietly, he walks down the hallway and listens to make sure the shower is running before he pushes the bathroom door open. He checks quickly that Ron isn’t around and then he goes in, heading past the shower to grab his clothing from the counter—
been ‘just Potter’ to him. Draco’s thought about Potter every single day since they first met, in one way or another, and it’s only grown worse as he’s gotten older.
“Thank fucking Merlin,” Harry says, relief pulsing in his blood, and then Draco raises an eyebrow and kisses him again, tightening his grip on Harry’s wrists. Harry groans, then again, louder, when Draco bends down further and starts mouthing at his ear, then down to his jawline. “I—
it so, so badly. “Add another,” he gasps out, watching Malfoy’s finger sliding in and out of himself.
Ron reaches over and rubs her back. “There, there, ‘Mione. I’m sure you’ll get it,” he says reassuringly.
But then Potter kisses him, crowding him backwards until Draco’s knees hit the bed, biting at his lip until Draco’s gasping with want, and he forgets that thought entirely.
“But,” Draco continues, “It’s... it’s not worth fucking up one of the only good relationships I have left.”
“We can’t just go home,” Potter says. “I don’t know about you, but I don’t fancy seeing what happens when we Apparate to completely different locations.”
Sometime later, when he’s back in bed with the weight of all the covers over top of him, there’s a knock on his door.
Malfoy sucks in a breath, looking away, and suddenly Harry gets the feeling that he’s about to say something that Harry won’t like.
But Malfoy’s obviously not going to answer, so he holds his tongue and turns to rest his elbows on the worktable, unable to stop himself from feeling a little crushed.
Hermione notices, of course she does. Harry tells her it’s nothing, even though she must have an inkling that something happened, since they’re not sitting with Malfoy at dinner any longer.
“You think?” Potter says. “It’s just. I, er, used to sleep in a cupboard? When I was really small, I mean. But it’s not a big deal,” he tacks on hurriedly as Draco tenses next to him.
“Potter…” Draco sighs, and it feels like a protest even though he’s not sure what he should be protesting anymore. Feeling so fucking vulnerable, maybe. He kind of hates it, except that it’s Potter, and if he can’t be vulnerable with Potter then he can’t be vulnerable with
Draco glances over at their shop Floo, and then he clears his throat, thinking that he has to be mental to be doing this. “Would you... would you like to come to mine for a bit? Just for a cup of tea?”
“All right there, Unspeakable Malfoy?” asks Unspeakable Ford as he passes Draco’s cubicle. He’s the head of the Time department, though in Draco’s opinion he doesn’t always act like it. At times he seems far too skittish about his decisions, which tends to exasperate Draco, as he prefers a much firmer hand in a leader.
They lapse into brief silence, and as the sudden surprise wears off, Draco has the clarity to fully appreciate that Potter is
It wouldn’t be trusting Malfoy enough to give him control over everything. It wouldn’t be feeling so fucking drawn to him that sometimes it burns.
Harry swallows. “This might be rude, but, erm. She mentioned at one point that you two weren’t really—a couple, I suppose?”
He expects Hermione to try to convince him otherwise, to ask him if he’s sure, because this is a big decision. He knows that. But instead, Hermione just nods. “Okay,” she says, and pats the seat next to her.
“Next time, you’ll do your paperwork on time,” Draco chastens, but he allows himself to give Potter a small smile just before Potter turns to leave.
Potter packs quickly, opting to let go of Draco despite the increase in pain in both of their heads. By the time he’s done, the slide of Potter’s hand into Draco’s feels like a breath of fresh air, and Draco sighs. Even if this whole thing is over someday, he’s going to end up with some weird Pavlovian response to Potter by the end of it, isn’t he?
Harry stands next to Draco, looking out the window of the hospital room. For some reason, neither the location nor his companion strikes him as strange in the moment, and he looks to the man next to him, tracing over the blond hair and pointy features that he’s—somehow?—come to know so well.
Draco bursts into a fit of laughter then, and fuck. He looks so—happy. Draco’s never seen his own face so free and full of joy.
“I—I don’t know,” Malfoy says, giving him a strange look. “I haven’t thought about it. Are you going to keep calling me Malfoy?”
Harry sighs. He stares down at a few droplets of unknown liquid on the table and thinks of his friends, his family—and then he thinks about working too much so they can’t see how bloody unhappy he is, of crawling into bed alone in his empty flat, thinking he’d give anything for something more. “I suppose you’re right.”
cold!” he shouts, making a futile effort to clamber back out. Recognizing that his efforts are in vain, he sullenly turns back to Malfoy, who happens to be laughing his head off. “You said it wasn’t!”
Draco’s face crumples briefly, and he has to fight hard to keep his tears at bay. It hurts too much to consider that she may, in fact, be right. “It doesn’t matter anyway,” he says, and then the worst of the truths—“He’s not here.”
“Thank you, Headmistress,” Harry breathed, leaping off the couch to follow her and pulling Draco with him.
His footsteps clicked in the silence. The portraits were all sleepy and muted; the walls and corridors seemed hollow, starkly contrasting with the thriving fullness of daytime. Everything was quiet now. The echoes had gone to bed.
Potter looks like he’s about to shout at him, brow tight, hands clenched into fists. But then something strange happens—he stops.
Malfoy hasn’t noticed him yet, and Harry comes to a standstill several paces back, unsure what to say. He’s not really sure he wants to say anything at all. He’s tired from the job—building a complex and rather nasty set of wards for a new potions shop where the owner refused to let Harry out of his sight, which makes Harry certain he’s hiding some sort of not-at-all-legal activity—and really he just wants to go home and pass out in his bed.
him that he’s maybe starting to get hard right now. He resists the urge to adjust himself in his pajama pants, grateful their hips aren’t closer together.
“Good,” Draco says, something predatory in his eyes as he slowly fucks into him with his finger, twisting his hand and making Harry groan.
“I never said that last part,” Harry protests, a little stung because it’s not true and also, for all intents and purposes, he
“Potter, Potter, Potter,” Malfoy says, tsking, and Harry can just imagine him shaking his head. “You know you can’t say things like that to a
Malfoy rubs at his eyes, silent for a moment, and then he stares out into the grounds. “The painting isn’t really for my capstone project.”
that they could somehow be friends, hoping that maybe Malfoy had changed, that there could be something—
“…I lied,” Malfoy said, and Harry’s stomach jumped. Definitely rampant hormones. “I’d rather talk to you than talk to no one,” he mumbled, pulling his arms around himself. “Just, not in front of other people.”
“Is it, um. Safe to do this here?” Harry asks, feeling his cheeks heat. He looks around the hospital room, suddenly worried that a Mediwitch will walk right in while they’re—indisposed.
But he doesn’t need dreams of the blue of the pool anymore—Draco is real and in front of him, and Harry is happy.
“I’m not sure,” Harry says truthfully. He’s not going to say the idea of—of dating, or something, hasn’t crossed his mind. But it’s
He escapes the table quickly after that. He has no desire to sit through small talk with Father, even if it means leaving Mother’s side.
He swallows nervously, pushing open the doors anyway and heading straight to what looks like the reception desk. He wonders if he should’ve Glamoured himself, but by then it’s too late, as the woman standing behind the desk has already spotted him.
Malfoy laughs, hitting it again, again, and Harry’s very nearly sobbing as Malfoy’s cock drives into him. “That’s it, Potter. You’re not going to forget this, are you? That Draco Malfoy was the one to take your arse for the very first time? I bet you’ll think of this later, when you’re fucking some other poor loser who comes in five seconds because he’s inside the great Harry Potter’s arse.” Malfoy pauses to give a particularly vigorous thrust, making Harry cry out incoherently. “And having this memory is going to annoy the hell out of you for the rest of your life, mark my words, Potter. You know why? Because—” He slows his movements so that he can start punctuating his words with thrusts, pulling back slowly and ramming in—“I can guarantee you—that this will be—one of the best fucks—of your entire life!”
“Harry, you have to!” a memory shines through. And then another, and another, and everything comes flooding back, every thought and every emotion and the face that he loves, tainted with absolute terror—no no no no, Draco, no!
Draco swallows and nods. “Yes,” he says, barely a whisper, and Potter rewards him by giving another long, slow lick up his arse crack, leaving Draco twitching in his wake.
It turns out he doesn’t even need to ask what Potter’s doing because Potter makes that very clear when he shifts to lie down on his stomach, spreads Draco even further open, and licks a slow, hot swathe across Draco’s hole.
“I thought you might,” Harry says, and kisses him. He’s taken his shirt off at some point, so Draco gladly runs his hands over the muscles on his back, moaning and pulling him closer.
“Oh Draco... Remind me to thank Ginny,” Harry says, and then he smiles brighter than he has for a long while.
Harry bats his hand away and undoes Draco’s zip himself, wrestling the trousers down Draco’s hips and then hooking a finger into his pants as well. “Potentially.”
me you’d gone shopping?” Draco asks, taking a seat next to her bed, trying to calm his own racing heart. “You could’ve told me what you needed!”
Draco looks up immediately from where he’s sitting in the sparse hospital bed, eyes wide. “Potter! What are you doing here?”
“You’ve been in love, haven’t you?” Malfoy asks, his eyes flashing. “Now imagine that feeling, except about three times stronger. We
“Take some deep breaths?” Draco suggests, and Potter closes his eyes and shivers a sigh through his nose.
It’s incredibly awkward as they climb in under the covers; the bed isn’t tiny but it’s not large either, and Harry can feel the chill coming off Malfoy’s skin even inches away.
“Um. I, er. Yes?” he manages to say, his voice coming out rather strangled because God, Malfoy’s getting straight to the point now, isn’t he?
Draco stops, looking up at him, leaving Harry’s neck cool and wet. “Probably you’re going to think that’s a bad idea in the morning.”
“Y-yeah, that’s fine,” Draco says, bucking his hips upward and making Harry moan. Draco feels around and picks up his wand, and then he casts a Lubrication Spell, and
Harry lets out an exasperated sigh, grudgingly following Malfoy down the hallway. Oddly, he kind of wants to laugh despite his horror at the situation, if only because he knows what Malfoy’s about to find—
He’s surprised, albeit relieved, that Malfoy hasn’t realized he didn’t dose himself. He feels like he’s been stiff from the beginning, which Malfoy definitely
It’s taken Draco a long time to understand just why Potter prefers to do most of this the Muggle way. To be fair, there are certain plants such as the tree he now has to plant that are too delicate to have magic such as a
Harry huffs a sigh, thinking privately that he would rather Malfoy just leave and be done with this all. But he shrugs and says, “It’ll be ten sickles then,” and watches as Malfoy digs around in a different pocket, pulling out a pouch of coins and rifling through it.
“Don’t worry,” Astoria says. “He can’t see us. The transparency spell is set to only go one way—for now, that is.”
Harry looks at him then, at the slight shimmer in his work robes that brings out the silver in his eyes, at the way his lips look so soft, at the way Malfoy’s holding onto his hand just a second longer than Harry would’ve expected. And Malfoy is staring back at him just as intently.
“Well,” Harry says, thinking. “It really started with Molly Weasley, I suppose. After we graduated, I was only in the DMLE for about a year before I quit, and after that I was mostly just lying about, not really doing much of anything. I thought about trying to start a broom line, but I never could get the hang of flying charms—they require a good amount of patience, see. Anyway, I never noticed how much energy regular household upkeep charms can take out of you until I was talking to Mrs. Weasley about it one night after dinner at the Burrow.”
Well, Draco thinks, stretching bitterly. At least Potter’s saved him several hours of dreading his own death.
Malfoy Vanishes their now empty food containers and stands, looking like he doesn’t quite know what to do with that statement. “We’ll see, Potter,” he says finally, sounding faintly amused, and Harry bids him farewell with a tiny spark of hope in his chest.
Harry gasps as Malfoy wraps his fingers around the plug, forcing himself to relax so that Malfoy can pull it out properly.
Which is something Harry truly, desperately doesn’t think he can bear. Draco’s been the high point of his life in the last few weeks, especially with this illness creeping in and destroying their lives—the high point of the past few years, quite honestly, trumping even the success of his shop. Being with Draco is incomparable to anything else.
“No,” Draco tells him, feeling a bit pitiful himself. “That’s more than I’ve got on my calendar, so.”
He tries his best to act normal as he sets the mugs down on the coffee table, ignoring the way his legs brush against Potter’s knees as he sits down on the opposite side of the sofa. He’s careful to leave a cushion’s worth of space between them, as if the invisible barrier between them can somehow make this easier.
“Forgive me if I say I don’t think you could override the Auror department, even if you wanted to,” Malfoy looked unoptimistic.
Malfoy’s closer even still as Harry raises his arms and lets Malfoy pull his shirt off, the cool night air blowing against his skin. He shivers, and Malfoy picks up his wand and casts a warming charm, and then a Notice-Me-Not, and he’s still so close as he reaches for Harry’s trousers—
, Potter. Not everything is an innuendo,” Malfoy grumbles, and Harry lets out a laugh at the pink in Malfoy’s cheeks. “Are you twelve? Do I need to Silence you?”
“Just a moment,” Malfoy says, and then after several seconds he lets out a long sigh. “Okay,” he says, and starts to slowly ride him.
Harry lets out a low whistle. “How did Lu—your Father, I mean—how’d he take it?” Too late, he realizes that Lucius might be a sore topic for Malfoy, and his suspicion is confirmed when Malfoy recoils. “Er, sorry! Sorry, you don’t have to answer that.”
“Thanks, Potter,” Draco says, sincere for once. Somehow, they’ve come a very long way in a very short amount of time. “I suppose…” He swallows. “I suppose if there’s anything you need from me, I could make an attempt.”
Fears. What was he scared of? He thought back to earlier in the night, when Ron had nicked a piece of his treacle tart without asking. “I’m terrified of not having enough food,” he blurted out, then almost groaned aloud at his own awkwardness.
Harry lets out an unexpected chuckle at the thought, although there’s a very small part of him that wonders what would actually happen if they got smashed, if they would fight or if they would maybe kiss instead. But God, no, that wouldn’t happen, would it? Malfoy barely wants anything to do with him.
In return, Potter reaches over and squeezes his hand from across the table, and Draco can’t fight a pleased flush.
Draco’s breath hitches just the slightest bit. “It would be too—intimate,” he says quietly. “You meant too much to me, back then, and I can’t let myself start to feel—” He cuts off, shaking his head. “Because I can’t be with you, long-term. You know I can’t.”
“Even before that,” Draco admits. “You were famous, you know. I had posters of you in my room—well, drawings of you, as no one really knew what you looked like until you came to Hogwarts. But…” He shrugs. “I didn’t have very many friends when I was young. Greg and—and Vince were around, but not often, and Pansy and I didn’t grow close until Hogwarts. So for the longest time, I had an imaginary friend that I played with when my parents weren’t watching. I’d pretend to fly brooms with you, and have tea—it was ridiculous, I know,” he says, shaking his head.
” Harry says, his hips bucking against the slickness of Draco’s fingers, and it takes him a moment to find his voice again after that. Fuck, that feels so good. He finally manages to open his mouth and say, “Draco, Draco, stop,” because he’s about ten seconds from coming and he would rather be fucking Draco when he does.
“I completely understand,” Hermione says, toying with her sandwich wrapper. “But… to be clear. Are you his mate?”
Against his better judgement, Harry follows him, because he’s so thoroughly fucked that it’s not like it can make things
But then there are nights like last night, where Potter is all sparkling eyes and warm looks as his eyes trace over Draco’s body, and fuck—
, he missed magic, he thinks as he picks up his wand and casts locking and silencing charms at the door. Then he stalks toward Potter, catching him in another kiss, a trembling hand on his chest.
The moment they leave Ginny’s room, a worried-looking older woman in a lab coat rushes up to Hermione. “Healer Granger,” she says, and then drops her voice to a whisper, but Harry’s near enough that he can hear it anyway. “You’ve got to come quickly. We’ve just had some new patients admitted who say they think they caught the disease at some sort of wizarding convention earlier this week, and there were hundreds of people attending—we may be about to have a lot more patients on our hands.”
“It’s wrong because—” Draco scrubs a hand through his hair, the thin strands messy on the pillowcase. “Because at any time, you could
, this thing he wants and hates and craves so much that he’d slowly, finally worked up the courage to ask Malfoy for it.
Potter’s mouth is soft and pliant against Draco’s, the simple touch sending sparks down his throat and warming him down to his toes, but soon enough the kiss grows deeper, Potter’s tongue slipping into his mouth and twisting against Draco’s own. Draco’s thrown wildly off-balance, because this
Harry looks a bit surprised at that. “No, no, not that,” he says. But then he seems to reconsider it. “Well… maybe a bit.”
“Of course it doesn’t,” Malfoy says, then raises his wand and Vanishes it with a tight slash. “Portraits move. This wasn’t a portrait—it was a mistake.”
Malfoy puts his forehead in one hand, letting out an exasperated sigh. “Salazar, he’s wasting his life away! Pitiful!”
Potter falls in pace with him, laughing, and Draco is all at once struck with how handsome he is, sunlight striking his tan skin, the sparkle in his eyes as he grins at Draco.
Draco is scared, Harry realizes. It makes sense. The whole point of this in the first place was because Draco wanted to hide from all of his feelings—and here he is, trying to chase them away with the Amortentia.
He’s too overly aware of the fact that Malfoy’s body is so close to his. It doesn’t help that they’re facing one another, and—and maybe it’s because of his stupid overreaction after their argument earlier, but he can’t help but find himself wanting to touch Malfoy. And not in a platonic way either.
There’s a terrifying half week where Draco doesn’t talk to him, doesn’t invite him over, and Harry’s so scared of having some sort of
,” Malfoy says. “Yes, of course I remember.” He sighs, hard, through his nose. “This isn’t—this isn’t easy for me, okay? I remember, and it was—it was awful afterward, but. But I couldn’t think of anything else while I was on it, I didn’t
Malfoy nods tightly and turns toward the door, and Harry quickly leaves, hoping not to be caught listening. But Malfoy catches up to him on the way to the department anyway.
Malfoy’s not in the painting classroom when Harry arrives that night, nor does he appear for the twenty minutes Harry stands waiting, and Harry feels a surge of panic.
“Want to make you feel good,” Potter says, and then he casts some sort of spell that makes the lube go warm and Draco chokes.
Hermione sees him and strides over to hug him. “Oh, Harry, it’s awful,” she says. “And—oh, Malfoy? Um, hello,” she adds, aiming a surprised look at Harry.
,” Harry groans out. He’s going light-headed, he thinks, and all he can feel is pleasure, hot in his body as he tries to focus on stroking himself. Then Draco moans against his neck, suckling again in a way that stings sharply, and all of a sudden Harry’s gone—he comes hard, body spasming beneath the press of Draco’s hips, his body, his mouth. “Draco, Draco,” he cries out, the only word he can think as he goes so light-headed he sees stars.
“Here,” Harry says, shoving the extra Butterbeer toward him before he can take it back. Malfoy gives him a look that’s two parts confusion and one part fear. “Oh, Merlin’s sake—I’m not poisoning you or anything, okay? I told Hermione I was going to the kitchens, and she wanted one, so I... took extra.”
Potter’s eyes narrow, as if he doesn’t trust Draco’s sudden change in tone. To be fair, it’s a mask. Despite all of Potter’s shortcomings, his instincts have always been good. “Your place,” Potter says. “But we have to go to mine so I can get some of my things.”
But as he turns to escape, he hears it again, the low sound of Draco’s voice, and Harry’s breath hitches involuntarily.
Draco looks up at him, a faint smile on his lips, and then he swats at Harry’s arse. “Don’t break character,” he mumbles, as if he hadn’t been the one to do it first, and Harry laughs and turns back around.
He means to go and sit on the bed when Potter leaves, but he can’t bring himself to move, melancholy finally overtaking him. All he can do is shut his eyes and hope that Potter hasn’t already started to regret this.
“Oh?” she pried. “What was that about Malfoy then, Harry? You’ve never wasted an opportunity to complain about him before,” she pointed out.
Then he positions his cock and pushes slowly inside him, and Harry loses all ability to speak, clutching at Draco’s sides and squeezing his eyes shut. Fuck, Draco is inside him, oh God—“Fuck,” he says aloud, nearly a whimper. “You feel good.”
Draco fucks him, in their cold and colorless room where the leak in the ceiling has only gotten worse. It’s a last breath of happiness, a last memory of what could have been. Harry knows it’s ending.
matter,” she says stubbornly, and now her eyes are fierce. “Because for the first time in literally all of the time we’ve been married, my husband came home and said he had sex with someone. And you
“Good,” Draco says, low and husky, and he finds his wand and Summons lube from a drawer across the room.
Draco is miserable as he climbs into bed, miserable because he misses Potter, because he is tired of fighting him, because he is anxious and terrified of his own death.
They stand there for another moment, and then Malfoy holds out his hand. “Well,” he says, and Harry reaches up to shake it, looking confused. “That’s that, then,” Malfoy says, his eyes slowly growing guarded. “I suppose I won’t need your help anymore.”
It’s not necessarily going well—they still bicker fairly frequently, though it’s nothing like before—but it’s at least not going poorly, until one night a month and a half in, when Draco receives an owl that makes his stomach drop.
“The rest of the Healers are working on curing everyone,” Hermione says, beaming. “I got sent home because I’ve been at the hospital for—well, ever since Draco was cured, actually. But Neville let me test my solution on him, and Gin and Blaise were right after that. They’re safe.”
, fuck—he claws at Potter’s back on accident, but Potter groans and snaps his hips sharply against Draco’s—and Merlin, that’s
Then, very slowly, Potter leans in, tilting his head to the side, and presses his lips to Draco’s neck.
“Feels good,” Harry mumbles, letting his eyes drift shut, drifting his hands down to tug at Malfoy’s hips.
him to magically return his feelings—hell, it’s enough that Potter is even open to going on a date with him. But that could just as easily be infatuation of some sort, and no matter what, Potter’s always going to know that Draco’s in love with him.
“No,” Malfoy says, his expression growing pinched. “They took my order wrong and accidentally gave me too much, and I wasn’t too far from Diagon, so I thought I’d bring it by.” Harry can’t tell if it’s an excuse or not, but either way, he can’t help feeling pleased. “If you don’t want it, I can leave, of course,” Malfoy adds, turning toward the door.
“Time is eleven forty-two,” Moore says, scribbling on a piece of paper with her quill. “Orb is”—she casts a quick Measuring Charm—“eight and a half-inches across, completely spherical, and not lighted from within.”
“Let’s go to mine?” Draco says, voice coming out all husky, still scared that Potter might change his mind.
“Hm,” Malfoy says, taking a sip of his drink. “No wonder you haven’t been in the papers. You haven’t been doing
Potter gives him a look that speaks of laughter, sucking him down as far as he can, pulling off to cough slightly but immediately trying again.
Harry files that bit of information away in the section for useless trivia in his mind, then sighs, actually considering Malfoy’s request. “Why should I let you? Paint me, I mean?”
Harry turned a corner a bit too quickly and immediately smashed into something warm and tall. His throat constricting in fear, he had to hurriedly clamp his mouth shut to keep a scream from escaping--it was only when he remembered that he was awake that he could relax (
But he still has his own decision to make. He takes a deep breath and lifts his quill, scrawling onto the first blank line:
Potter, on his part, hasn’t interrupted the moment, but Draco can tell he’s starting to get antsy. It’s only then that Draco realizes a dull pain in his head has returned, and he sighs and reluctantly grabs for Potter’s hand again.
“The constellation,” Harry explains, cheeks feeling flushed, though that could well be because of the cold that permeates his charm every now and then.
Harry thinks he has to be terribly unlucky to have chosen the two dullest departments of all time for his first two rotations.
Draco’s suddenly paralyzed because that would mean—that would mean Potter dislikes him so much that he doesn’t even fucking want to remember, and—
Harry waits for him to continue, but after several seconds he doesn’t, so Harry says, “What? Go on.”
“Probably,” Draco admits, feeling guilty for it in this moment, even though Harry’s the one that’s done wrong, isn’t he?
They married only a couple years after the company opened its doors. The wedding was the first Harry had been to of friends his age, which would have been eye-opening enough even if it wasn’t coincidentally when Ginny first hooked up with Pansy—which Harry only knows because he’d been unlucky enough to walk in on them, God.
“No,” Harry says, hiding the slow smile growing on his face. “Hermione’s the one who’s always right.”
Draco fucking melts. He moans unabashedly, reaching up to wrap his arms around Potter’s shoulders, and they’re still moving with the beat but mostly Draco’s pressing his hips up against Potter’s, repeatedly gasping as Potter starts nipping at his neck and collarbone, liquid fire burning in Draco’s groin. It’s so much more than he could have dreamed of, and Draco soaks it in, mind going faintly fuzzy in disbelief, and then his knees buckle and Potter’s basically holding him up, fuck. Potter pulls back, steadying him, and Draco feels a wave of disappointment at the loss before Potter leans forward and puts his lips to Draco’s ear and says, “Wanna go?”
), but the thought of returning and completing his NEWTs was repulsive. Not to mention that he’d already forgotten most of the knowledge he would have needed--the only things he'd retained will were the skills that had been necessary for survival in the fight against Voldemort.
“No,” Harry huffs. Malfoy doesn’t need to know his secrets, especially as they pertain to him. “I just thought it would be nice if it were more private.”
Harry slides his hands up to cup Draco’s face, gasping against his lips, but he’s surprised to find tears against his fingers.
The moment his fingers touch Malfoy’s shoulder, memories assault him—taking the Oath, standing side-by-side, back when he only knew Malfoy as Trainee Four—supporting each other. Steadying each other.
“Hey,” Potter says, and Draco had been about to ask what the fuck Potter’s doing in his bed, but Potter’s tone takes his breath away.
” Malfoy groans, hand flying to his face as he stares at Harry in shock for a moment. And then he bursts out toward Harry to retaliate, and all of a sudden they’re wrestling, grabbing at each other’s shoulders, fighting for control. Harry moves for his wand but Malfoy sees what he’s doing and reaches for
But he takes the lead anyway as they pull on their pants and leave the bedroom, walking over to Draco’s study. He pulls his Pensieve out of the cupboard, setting it on his desk, and gestures for Potter to step forward.
“I still don’t understand why the fuck we have to share a room,” Malfoy fumed, unshrinking another box and tearing it open angrily. Harry resisted the urge to roll his eyes.
Harry reciprocates when he finally catches his breath, mouthing at Draco’s cock until he’s begging Harry to suck him—and he does, moving in languid strokes, pulling back when Draco gets close, to his extreme annoyance.
Already, an idea is forming in his head as he thinks about the spell, one that makes him smile as he puts his coat on and heads to the shop.
“What… oh,” Harry says. Fuck. And now he’s the one flushing, hurriedly rescuing his towel from where it’d started slipping down as he turns and flees back to the bathroom. Then he breathes a sigh of relief as he steps back into the warm shower, thankful that Malfoy didn’t end up seeing anything of consequence.
“You make this so hard,” Potter says, and it almost sounds like he’s crying. Draco’s too much of a coward to check, or to ask what he’s on about now.
“It’s okay, Potter,” Draco says. He doesn’t look okay. But still, he brings a hand up to stroke Harry’s back. “I believe in Hermione. Don’t you?”
“Hold on,” he says, the slip of paper crinkling in his hand as he stares at her, confused. “Er, just—why bother?”
“And I’m fucking useless without you,” Malfoy says, sounding pained, and Harry can feel his breath heaving. “You can be you without me, but I... I can’t be me without you.”
“Yeah, yes, of course,” Harry says, shifting so he can wrap his hand around Malfoy’s still-slick cock. The moment he strokes him, Malfoy groans loudly, tightening around Harry even further. “
Draco’s heart threatens to break, even as he draws closer and closer to orgasm. “You’re lying,” he chokes out, hand stuttering on his cock.
Harry’s relieved too as he watches Ron go. He’s worried enough as it is about Ginny and Neville and Blaise, and he couldn’t bear to add Ron to that list.
This is what he’d forgotten earlier: Shrivelfigs are harmless in nearly all circumstances, and they keep a large stock of them at the warehouse, as they’re popular for home-based potioneers. Except earlier that morning, they’d received a shipment of Flaring Rubyflowers, a pretty specimen that releases pleasant sparks of magic when touched.
But he can’t let Potter know how he’s feeling at any cost, so Draco makes sure his expression doesn’t betray anything before forcing himself to close his eyes, giving in to the feeling of Potter’s fingers inside him.
Draco sucks in a breath. “I’m so sorry,” he says. “I never wanted you to know. I’m sorry I lied, but I really, really didn’t want to tell you—and it seems it didn’t fucking matter anyway because I’ve already managed to hurt you, haven’t I?"
“I just didn’t want it to be awkward, with Ron,” Harry says, shrugging. “Dunno what he would say to me having you over.”
“What the hell are you doing?” he says, even though part of him knows exactly what’s happening—he learned about vampires at Hogwarts just like everyone else. He knows how they attract their prey: by making themselves irresistible, luring them in, leaving them helpless to escape.
Draco raises his wand and Summons his own clothes. They fly across the room just as they’re supposed to, and he pulls them on as Harry finishes dressing, looking bewildered. Then he Summons the bracelet too, strapping it on his wrist, and Harry feels the faint trickle of Allure-induced lust that’s been flowing beneath his skin finally drop away.
Draco grins, sliding his fingers ever so slowly down Harry’s stomach as Harry’s cock hardens. “And what if I don’t?” he says, skimming his hand through the thatch of hair between Harry’s hips. “You’ll just have to be very, very quiet, won’t you?”
“You—you used my name,” Harry says, swallowing against the thickness in his throat. Yes, Draco’d done it once before, but it’d been during almost-sex, so it was different.
It’s better and worse than when Will left him all at once. Better, because he knows it was never real in the first place, and worse—
He wonders, too, what it would be like to hear his own name from Malfoy’s mouth. Then he wants to laugh, because he’s sure Malfoy would rather die than say something like that aloud.
“What is it?” Harry asks, his heart aching with every beat as he looks at the man he loves. Draco looks so small on the hospital bed, small and alone and—and Harry doesn’t want to leave him.
“Agreed,” Draco says, crossing his arms around himself. “I don’t dislike you,” he admits finally, heart fluttering as he looks up at Potter. “But I don’t trust you either.”
They hold each other, and time ticks on, without regard to the two of them standing trembling before the dawn. In a few short hours, Draco will—
And then, just as past-Draco turns to look at the bar so he can make an excuse about wanting to go get a drink, past-Potter leans in to kiss him.
,’ he remembers Draco saying. Then he thinks of how nice it’s been, to be just friends with Draco—how
“Look at you—look at how much of a slut you are for this. I bet you’re going to come find me later, in a few months when you can’t stop thinking about how bloody
Harry shakes his head, sighing. “I don’t really have anything I want to do after Hogwarts.” Not anymore. The war’s taken care of that.
Harry’s struck with the thought that it’s rather funny that Malfoy’s still calling him ‘Potter’—and for that matter, Harry’s still calling him Malfoy, isn’t he? He laughs, deep from his belly, pulling Malfoy closer still. “Draco,” he says, liking the sound of it in his mouth, “Draco.”
“You’re… wrong,” he forces the words out through his aching throat. Unconsciousness is already spiraling in the back of his mind, and he’s grateful.
“Because I’m your friend, and you just said you’re bollocks at romance, which I can help with. And I know you don’t talk to Ron about this kind of thing because you’re both incapable of having an honest conversation about feelings with each other, and you hate going to Hermione because you know she’ll tell you to just do the most sensible thing and confront whoever it is.”
Excellent, even. Malfoy’s lips had been soft and insistent, his hands hot on Harry’s back, sliding up his shirt—and Harry had completely fucking melted. He was seriously considering leaving the party and just taking Malfoy to bed with him—except that five minutes in, Malfoy froze as if he’d been shocked, disentangled himself from Harry’s grasp, and fled.
Potter’s desk lamp shatters. Draco hasn’t let his magic slip like that in years, but he doesn’t fucking
“Are you saying you’d trust my word over that of your precious Aurors, Potter? Please,” Malfoy glared at him.
Harry is immediately and forcefully reminded just exactly how powerful of a witch Hermione is, and thinks to himself not for the first time that he’s very glad she’s on his side. Most of the time.
Draco lets out a sigh that’s barely audible. “Fuck,” he says, and the hand on his cock momentarily stills. “You’re—Merlin.”
“Yes! That!” Potter exclaims, hands deep in the dirt, beaming as if Draco has just explained to him the meaning of life.
“I regretted not being there to know how you felt about it, mostly,” Draco admits. “I… I didn’t think…” He can’t finish the sentence, emotion building in his lungs, so he ends up just shaking his head.
“I think I’d rather you be betrothed,” he says, and Malfoy lets out a rueful laugh. Then they’re both silent for a moment as Harry stares blankly at the floor.
Heart in his throat, he raises the shot glass anyway, tipping the liquid in it toward his mouth. But this time, his wand under the table, he wordlessly casts a Vanishing Spell.
Harry’s not sure how it happened exactly. All he knows is that Malfoy’s mouth is on his, warm and soft, and Harry
After several moments of snogging he finally remembers, and he Apparates them into his living room mid-kiss, the crack barely audible against the heavy beating of his heart. “Fuck,” he says, grinning at the sight of Draco in his flat. “I’m so glad you’re here.”
“You two know that, and I know that, but the Ministry doesn’t seem to care. We’ve tried to reason with them, but they won’t listen, and… I’m terribly sorry, but there are Aurors on the way here to apprehend Mr. Malfoy as we speak.” She looked down, mouth tightened into a thin line. “I will continue to say anything I can in your defense, Mr. Malfoy. You’ve been an excellent trainee, and neither of you have shown any signs of trouble this summer. There’s not a doubt in my mind that you were not the orchestrator of this monstrosity, but the Aurors will be hard to convince.”
Harry reaches out without thinking and finds Draco’s hand, squeezing it in a way he hopes is at least a little comforting. Hermione looks down and sees, her eyebrows lifting, and Harry knows she wants to ask about it. But right now Harry’s more concerned about Draco, because Draco’s growing paler by the second.
“Sure,” Potter says, grinning, and he’s about to say something more when there’s another loud clang around them. Slowly, the lift starts moving again, and Potter’s face lights up. “Oh!”
He knows seeking Malfoy out is probably dangerous and ill-advised—Hermione and Ron would certainly say so. He doesn’t tell them about it for precisely that reason, even though several questions burn in his throat the next time he joins them for dinner—
“We’re—we’re always pushing against each other, aren’t we?” Draco says quietly. “It’s different than doing it to someone else—though obviously that’s awful too. But it was terrifying to have you be so... compliant. That’s not... that’s not how we are.”
Finally, Draco pushes the door open. He’s dressed already, in a pair of clothes Harry suspected he’s Transfigured to fit from Harry’s drawer, and he comes and sits on the bed beside Harry.
He’s even lonelier still when he closes his eyes and immediately thinks of Potter’s face, of Potter laughing, going to hold him, kissing him.
their mate, then there are some rather uncomfortable consequences, or so it’s said.” Malfoy makes a face. “It’s barbaric, really. Even for full-blooded Veela, I imagine it’s quite annoying to be biologically required to mate.”
But his body could somehow still move, and before he knew it he was spelling water wordlessly in Draco’s direction.
“There’s no evidence to support that all,” Hermione says, shaking her head. “It’s just a trick of fate.”
“You can,” Harry says, and now Malfoy is the one trembling in his arms, until Harry opens his mouth and adds, “But that doesn’t mean I want you to.”
That sounds lovely, doesn't it? Vaguely, Harry braces himself, because usually this is where his own willpower kicks in, tells him no, no, we're not doing this.
He nearly starts crying again as he finishes packing, because what if—what if he never sees her again? What if she doesn’t
“Okay,” Potter says back, a smile forming on his lips. But then it fades. “If you did still hate me—after the last week and a half I’d understand.”
Harry turns to see a small gaggle of first years all huddled together, centered around two girls playing Exploding Snap. They’re all in tiny robes bearing the Hogwarts crest, no House colors in sight.
Malfoy… Draco… tugged his arms around himself as if he were scared. But when he turned to Harry in the next moment, a small smile was visible on his face.
Draco gives a tight shake of his head and starts leading them to the kitchen. There, they watch Nimsy prepare dinner, and Potter is thankfully silent.
By the time Malfoy walks into Harry’s workroom the next day, Harry’s annoyance has cooled enough that the curiosity and wonder he’s starting to feel about Malfoy have vastly overridden it.
“Potter,” Draco says, wiping at his own face, squeezing his eyes shut. “Please don’t let her be alone,” he chokes out, even though this is a ridiculous thing to ask.
The more time he spends with Potter, the more likely it is that someone will figure out that Draco is head over heels for the speccy, sun-tanned, hard-working, obnoxiously beautiful git.
It’s not as bad as Harry was expecting, especially with the extra alcohol in him. Actually, it’s far better than he was expecting, because as soon as they reach an empty space on the dance floor Malfoy pulls him in so close their hips are nearly touching.
“No, no, I’m interested,” Malfoy says, jabbing his wand toward the canvas. He runs his other hand through his hair, and Harry bites back another rush of attraction, hurriedly focusing on the floor.
“Thanks,” Harry says, smiling. “Anyway, how are you doing, with work and all? I know it’s been stressful.”
“Hullo,” Malfoy says, stepping through the curtain. “Your shop assistant seems to think there’s something incredibly funny about me.”
“So you should... you should stop,” Malfoy says, looking mortified, and then he buries his face in his hands.
“Potter,” Draco pulls away to complain, but it comes out as more of a whine and even then Draco leans back in and kisses him again anyway. Harry shivers and backs Draco into the nearest surface, which happens to be the fridge, taking care this time to suck at Draco’s lip, heart speeding at the way Draco moans in response and slips his tongue into Harry’s mouth.
And even if it’s not… even if it’s not, Draco isn’t even the same person off the Amortentia, not really. He’s too jaded, too cruel, too broken up for a relationship, he—
Harry chases him. He can’t help it; he keeps coming back, long after it would have been wise to stop.
Ron caught hold of his soon-to-be-wife’s hand, sharing a smile with her before addressing Harry again. “Harry, I hope you’ll be my best man? Since you’re my best mate, you know,” he added, seemingly trying to hide his nerves with a lighthearted tone of voice.
Potter sits there, and sometimes he reads, but other times the boredom radiates off of him in waves so strong Draco can feel it secondhand. Sometimes he folds his notebook paper into messy origami and then Vanishes it with a huff of resignation, sometimes he stares idly up at the ceiling for minutes on end. Draco aims dark glares at him whenever possible, but either Potter doesn’t see him or is just plain ignoring his obvious displeasure.
Has Potter ever smiled at him before? Draco can’t remember. He feels suddenly awkward, and he tightens his mouth, looking back out the window. “It’s not a big deal,” he mumbles.
Malfoy swallows audibly. “If I didn’t know better—I might think you were... thinking untoward things.”
Okay, okay, he’s being melodramatic. Unspeakable rotations only last two months, and realistically Astoria will be fine, at least according to her Healer. But then again, her Healer also said a few months ago that Astoria’s coughing fits shouldn’t get worse, and they have, so obviously they can’t predict everything, now can they?
“None of that, now,” Malfoy says, and then he casts an unintelligible spell that kicks Harry’s legs apart, forcing him into a wide stance. It’s not an uncomfortable way to stand, but fucking
Harry forbids himself from daydreaming about Malfoy while Malfoy is painting. Mostly because the fifth time Malfoy paints him, Harry gets a hard-on in the middle of it and has excuse himself to the loo to avoid Malfoy seeing.
He especially hates the way Potter goes to him immediately, eyes wide, and pulls Draco into his arms—hates how comforting it feels to press his face into Potter’s neck, hates how he never wants it to end, and Merlin, this shouldn’t be
“I’m not! I mean, er, I’m perfectly fine.” His ineloquence would be the death of him, really. She frowned at his stammer, setting a hand on her slim hip.
“Repeat after me,” the stern-sounding Unspeakable in front of him says. The Identity-Masking Charms shimmer over her face, distorting the very air in front of her, and it only adds to the eerieness of the moment.
“Eager for lunch, are you?” Draco asks, raising an eyebrow, one hand resting in the pocket of his form-fitting St. Mungo’s robes. God, he looks good. He always does.
The defogging charm is starting to wear off on the glass. Harry watches as the condensation starts to cover Draco, spreading toward the middle, and Draco stares back all the way until Harry can no longer see his face.
They chat for a few minutes more, idle chatter over the weather and work and other things of no consequence. Halfway through their conversation, Harry looks down and realizes that Malfoy’s hand is on the table, close enough to touch if he wanted to. Harry wonders what would happen if he was to try and hold it. Probably Malfoy would pull away, but…
Harry sighs out a breath as he pulls away, smiling at Draco, heart fluttering in his chest (still, after all this time) when Draco smiles back. “I’m glad we’re not like that anymore—fighting every day, literally at each other’s throats whenever we got the chance.”
“We’re going out,” Harry tells Hughes as they walk past. He’s not even sure if Hughes hears him, as the old man doesn’t look up, seeming completely absorbed in his manuscript. Ah well. Harry tried.
Draco didn’t respond, so Harry crept closer. Slowly, slowly, he climbed into the bed and laid down next to him, squeezing his eyes shut.
Right. Harry jerks his gaze away, because again Malfoy hasn’t taken the bait. Harry hates it. Fighting with Malfoy is much easier to understand than the sheer indifference Malfoy has on his face. If Harry had any sense he would leave right now and cut his losses; despite the lust thrumming in Harry’s veins, it’s obvious Malfoy doesn’t want him here, doesn’t feel the same.
“Hmph.” Malfoy crosses his arms, but he looks caught off guard, as if the world beneath him has shifted.
“I know,” Harry says, and then he drops his hand from Draco’s wrist. “I won’t leave you,” he says again. “Promise.”
Draco looks at him, at the green of his eyes, and feels himself flush with warmth. “Thank you,” he says.
“Sometimes I like to go out on my own,” Astoria says obstinately. “I’m your wife, not your captive, you know.”
How Harry wishes he could return to those days, when the greatest question was what house he would end up in and whether or not it would be the same as Ron’s. But now his fondest memories are all tinged with sadness at the edges, reminding him of other memories, worse ones, the ones that are bloodstained and jarring. Even though he’s been around Hogwarts a fair amount, especially this past summer while helping to rebuild, there are still times when he looks at the stone floors and can’t shake the memories of screaming, of fire. Of adrenaline and fear being the only thing keeping him standing as spells are flung all around him.
Draco’s pupils flare. “Fuck,” he says, flushing. And then he looks away. “I want that with you,” he blurts out. “All of it.”
Eventually, Malfoy shakes his head. “I did,” he says then. “But it wasn’t... I felt terrible, for liking it.”
Even after close to six months, Draco still isn’t quite used to waking up with Harry in his bed. It’s always somewhat of a surprise, to blink his eyes open and feel Harry’s hands on him—and Harry’s hands are
But it felt okay to be talking to someone now. Maybe he should nap before socializing—he even felt more eloquent. Not sounding like an idiot was something he could get used to again.
“No,” Draco says quickly. “I was just—a bit surprised.” He wiggles his fingers, and Potter thankfully lets go of his hand—it really was starting to hurt—and then Draco slides his arm around Potter’s shoulders, hoping that it comes across as natural. “Okay?”
And now he sees Potter smiling, and he wants to wrap himself in it like a warm blanket and lie there forever.
“But,” Harry says, and he can’t think of a way to finish the sentence, his lungs squeezing tight in his chest.
Unspoken is the fact that even Diagon Alley itself is emptier now, its cobbled streets never to be walked again by those who had fallen in the war. Harry swallows hard and tells himself, for the millionth time, that it’s not his fault.
And then Draco swallows and nods, letting his wings unfurl from behind him in a whirlwind of feathers. Harry stares up at him, at his reddened lips and flushed chest, at his thickened erection, at the immense white wings that are now curling around his shoulders.
“Oh,” Harry says. It’s honestly quite astute of her to ask him personally, as it means no rules are actually being broken. “Yeah,” he says, “I am.”
He takes another sip of whisky, the heat of it pleasant in his throat, and then very carefully sets his glass down on the end table. “Isn’t it your turn?”
“You better fucking come,” Malfoy mutters, probably because he just wants to get it over with. Harry wants to retort, but then Malfoy twists his hand in the most perfect way and then Harry
“Um…” Oh God—“Draco.” He swallowed, the name feeling sticky and wonderful in his throat. “I… that could work.”
But before he can even think of some sort of way to make that happen, Malfoy let's go, pulling away and turning back toward the table. “Come on, Potter,” he says, already walking away.
“I’m gonna—I’m not gonna last,” Harry says, and now Draco’s making these little whimpers on every thrust that threaten to tear Harry apart.
And then Draco raises his hips and snaps them back down again, fucking himself onto Harry, a trembling smile slowly appearing on his face.
Hermione goes through about three different facial expressions before settling on resigned amusement. “Oh, Harry,” she says, and then she steps forward and starts walking to Malfoy’s table.
. “It’s just, I see you around all the time at work,” Harry continues, “and it’s been fucking killing me because I don’t know how to bloody
Still… he thought about the times where Draco had touched him, like the time last week when Draco had cast a fully flaring Incendio and had proceeded to hug him, and he had felt as if he were on fire with the intensity of his emotions. And then back to the kiss, where this had started, where he had begun to think of Draco in that way at all. It would be worth it, to feel like that, to accept the love that Draco was offering and bask in it forever.
“Good,” Harry says, smiling, and then he’s pulling back and pressing into Draco so slowly he could cry, drawing the moment out, making it so perfect he can’t stand it.
rather sound like something he would’ve done back at Hogwarts, after all. “So the question is,” Malfoy continues, “What sort of punishment shall I give you? Any suggestions?”
When he pulls away, Draco looks slightly dazed. “You are eager, aren’t you?” Draco says, cheeks faintly pink.
my choice of topic—but I was going to do it anyway. Learn to paint, I mean.” Malfoy closes his eyes. “My mother is dying.”
Harry wants to ask what he means, but for some reason the rawness in Malfoy’s expression stops him. In the end he only holds him closer.
It makes Draco think that maybe the end of their marriage wasn’t the worst thing in the world. He’s always wanted her happiness, after all.
Harry swallows, grabbing a glass from where he keeps them on the windowsill and filling it with an Aguamenti to stall for time. “Well, er. Mostly just what Draco told me, I guess. They have wings, and can use Allure, and—and they have mates.”
was rude of you!” the mirror bursts out, sounding haughty as ever as it interrupts him. “Not you, Potter—” Harry snorts at that—“But
“Oh?” Malfoy says, looking pleased in an almost predatory way, and Harry’s breath hitches. “Do elaborate.”
“No, don’t slow down, it’s fine,” Harry says, clenching his teeth until the pulse of pain fades. “Just—letting you know.”
“Well,” Malfoy says, eyes flaring, “Excuse me if I’m having trouble believing that my old school rival wants to get off with me for the hell of it.”
Malfoy looks a bit like he wants to laugh. But then his lips curl into a tired smile. “I told you to stop being nice to me,” he says, looking away. “But... but thank you.”
“There wasn’t anything between us,” Draco hurries to say. “We were good friends, and we fooled around for a while, but it was never serious.”
They fall apart anyway. Draco comes first, spurting sticky between them, and the sight is so hot that Harry wants to die. Instead he comes too, moments later, bucking his hips up against Draco’s body.
Harry opens his eyes, tracing them over Draco’s sharp features. His hair has only started growing back after the fire incident, back when he had to cut it shorter than usual to fix the damage.
, is it? You said it didn’t bother you that I don’t want to date anyone right now, and I know we haven’t talked alone for months, but if you lied to me, Harry Potter—!”
Slowly, he opens his mouth, watching as Potter’s eyes blink open, his chest heaving. Draco clears the despair from his throat, his own lip trembling. “I—I love you,” he says, the words tearing out of him, feeling like he’s dangling at the edge of a precipice.
“W-what?” Draco says. He’s sitting there, frozen, mouth agape as tears trickle down his face. “Potter, no… no. You said—you said you d-didn’t, you always said that you weren’t—in love.”
“If you don’t want to, I’ll drop it,” Harry says immediately, the spark of hope in his chest thoroughly doused.
He’ll be alone, and he won’t have anything to occupy himself with, and—and this is what she meant, isn’t it? When she said it was a bad thing that he’d become obsessed with her illness?
“No,” Draco cuts him off, shaking his head tightly. “It’s—that’s. It’s fine. The physical stuff. I… If you must know, I probably would have fucked you sober.”
Truthfully, Harry wasn’t sure what had inspired him to make the suggestion. He had never been planning on taking the DADA position at all, no matter how many times McGonagall had hinted. He didn’t want to teach; he wanted to be left alone. So why did he feel like he wanted this more than anything? It was all Malfoy’s fault, bloody Malfoy and his stupid fears and grudges and Mark.
He’s a fool to assume Potter even cares for him anyway. For all he knows, Potter has dismissed him completely—a lost cause, just someone else he couldn’t save.
Malfoy takes him to a seedy little bar right at the edge of Muggle London, the kind that makes Harry wish he’d thought to Glamour himself beforehand. It’s just starting to sink in that he’s really here, really with Draco fucking Malfoy in a bar, about to order drinks for the both of them.
Potter had looked up, then, and hadn’t even realized that Draco was staring at him—instead, he’d fucking smiled as he said hello, and Draco couldn’t even bring himself say anything back. He was too busy choking on Potter’s kindness, too busy being mortified at the fact that his cock was already twitching with interest.
Harry nods, though he doesn’t think he’ll be taking Ron up on that offer any time soon, standing and heading to his bedroom.
“It means you can’t do magic anymore, Potter,” Pansy says dryly. “And it’s not just casting spells, at least if the damage is bad enough. I’ve heard stories of people who can’t even see magical creatures any longer, or who get caught by Muggle-repelling charms just like a Muggle would.”
“Not for you,” Potter tells him, and then before Draco can object, Potter takes the vial and tips a few drops into his own mouth.
“I’ll take that as a yes,” Hermione says, passing him a glass to spell dry. She always insists on washing things the Muggle way, claiming that spells don’t clean them nearly well enough, but evidently Hot-Air Charms work fine enough for her. “Harry… is he the one?”
“Don’t—don’t touch me,” Draco says, but he’s pressing his face into Harry’s chest anyway because this is the last time, right? The last time he’ll ever feel like this?
The Trainee next to him knocks into him, and Harry shakily reaches out a hand to steady them, becoming dimly aware that it’s Trainee Four. Harry’s again grateful for him—his biggest ally and support through all of this—as even now, their heads screaming in pain, Trainee Four reaches out and steadies Harry in return.
“Spread your legs further,” Harry tells him, and Malfoy complies, meaning Harry can see the exact moment Malfoy begins to push a finger in, his whole body stilling. “God,” Harry sighs. “You’re so bloody hot.”
“Robertson’s an egotistical arsehole on a good day,” Potter mutters. “All bark and no bite, as they say.”
“Unfortunately, that’s how it looks like it’s turning out,” Hermione says, eyes morose. “And we have no idea how much of the population it’s already affected.”
Harry’s heart feels like it’s stopped inside his chest. Logically, he knows that it’s still beating, because he’s not dead yet, but the pain is so—much.
But Malfoy only eyes him silently for a moment, stretching, cracking his neck. “Now if you’ll excuse me, I’d like to go back to waiting for my next shag...?”
“Fuck,” Harry groans, and presses back, and then they’re kissing again, rutting against each other, and it’s so good that Harry can’t even think—fuck, they were supposed to be doing something else, but this has to be
Draco’s heart pulses in his chest. Fuck. Wordlessly, he shifts closer, until his shoulder is pressed against Potter’s. “That okay?”
he has, all because of his stupid pride, and it’s so idiotic because this entire month he’s missed Potter so much he could barely breathe. How did he not
Draco lifts his head. “Are you going to fuck me or not?” he asks, his voice coming out coated in rust. “I don’t have all night.”
The truth strikes him like lightning, like the scar across Potter’s skin. He’s gone and done the worst possible thing and started caring about him.
No. Harry’s not going to think about that right now, because every time he thinks about it his face heats, and he does
“I regret to say that solely because he is the last known Death Eater that is neither dead nor incarcerated, the Auror force has slated Mr. Malfoy as the culprit.” She sighed. “You two picked the wrong day to go to Diagon, it seems.”
It’s cold at the lake nowadays. Harry has to renew the warming charms much more frequently than he used to, and Malfoy’s cushioning charms have to be especially strong, but Harry doesn’t mind. It’s enough just to be there with Malfoy, not touching, barely speaking.
They’ve never talked about the times after, finding excuses to shout at one another, about wide eyes and stubborn mouths as they shucked their clothes in this very room, about the sounds Malfoy makes as they both come apart.
Harry swallows sharply. It does hurt, to hear Draco dismiss his desires—both of their desires—just like that. “Why is it wrong, really? If we both want it?”
, really, except that nothing in this damned dusty hellhole is helping get any closer to figuring out Astoria’s curse.
Hermione hangs her head. “We’ve got him under quarantine,” she says, and Harry can see Draco tense up even out of the corner of his eye. “He admitted himself to the hospital before he even started showing symptoms. He’s worried sick as it is about Neville, let alone about spreading it to everyone else.”
He swallows around the lump that’s rapidly forming in his throat. “I’m fine,” he says, and really, he should tell him to keep going, should just completely ignore Potter because Draco doesn’t even know how to feel about him right now, if he’s being honest—no, he should just kick Potter out entirely, because Potter
So he pulls away, sitting up, and Potter’s arms fall to his sides. He looks almost like he wants to say something, but then he seems to think better of it.
Even the pool is running cold. It feels like there’s less furniture in the house, too, and Harry thinks he’s going crazy.
“Yes,” Draco says, and leans in to kiss him softly, a warm melding of mouths that leaves Harry feeling dizzy and breathless afterwards. “It was.”
They crawl into bed, strange enough because it’s the guest room and even more so because Potter’s here, but regardless everything is going fine and well until Draco realizes that holding Potter’s hand means he can’t get into his preferred sleep position.
“I couldn’t forget,” Harry says, his face going just a bit red. “Even back then I—fuck, I hate Veritaserum—even back then… I was attracted to you. I just didn’t know it was
Draco blushes, bright and pink. “Don’t expect me to say it back,” he mumbles, but then he kisses Harry anyway, and Harry’s pulse is thrumming in his throat as he finally manages to unfasten Draco’s robes. “Let me,” Draco breathes, casting some sort of spell that neatly deposits his own clothing, save for pants, on a nearby chair.
Harry’s more than glad that Ron’s fast asleep on the couch when he hears the knock on the door that evening. He opens it to find Malfoy dressed in a set of black casual robes, still more tightly fitted than they have any right to be.
Potter takes his tea wrong (five sugars is far too many) and refuses to eat his eggs scrambled and hovers over Draco while he does anything and everything—and yes, that part is mostly because they’re stuck together, but Draco can feel Potter’s eyes on him constantly. Potter’s always judging, he thinks, judging the things he says or doesn’t say, judging the way he cooks and styles his hair and does up his shoelaces.
Or, no, it’s not blank, he realizes, as he walks over to pick it up. His eyes widen as he reads what it says, once, then over again.
Harry cuts him off with a firm kiss, laughing, and Draco responds easily, so easily. Harry basks in the warmth of it, of fragile love and of Draco, here and real beside him.
they’ve had going on. It’s been more than just being friends, and he thinks they both know it—and Harry’s liked it. A lot.
God, the voice is just right. The words are just right. He’s changed his mind; whoever is doing this is acting like Draco just to torture him, and now he’s going to go insane with this Draco being so close to the real one—
Harry’s eyes flick down to Draco’s mouth. Then he shuts his eyes so he can’t stare anymore, because staring at him will make Harry want to kiss him again. “I just—”
Not that Draco wasn’t doing the same thing. In essence he was just lonely too—he needed that connection to bear his breakup with Astoria.
—you just talked about how you felt back at Hogwarts.” He lets out a sigh, his voice softening as he looks away. “And anyway, I thought that all changed after we snogged at the end of eighth year. You—you always avoided me after that.”
He doesn’t, but it’s a close thing, shared breath warm and heady between them. He’d forgotten how green Potter’s eyes are, but there’s no way he’ll ever forget now, as Potter glares back at him but doesn’t even try to get away.
After a moment of indecision, Harry pulls out a chair and sits down with him. Then he aims his wand at the kettle sitting on the stove, Levitating it so it can fill itself from the faucet, then setting it back on the stove to boil.
Draco shrugs. “I’m just as fond of you as I was earlier today,” he says, cheeks going pink. “Possibly a little more, even. But I don’t think that’s because we’ve mated.”
Instead he walks to his own room and begins angrily Summoning all of his belongings. He Transfigures a couple of spare mugs into boxes, shrinking all of his things and haphazardly packing them away.
But he manages to survive long enough to Side-Along them to his flat, Potter’s body warm and firm against him.
Harry nearly objects, but then Draco starts pulling Harry’s shirt off, and Harry remembers. Right. They’re going to fuck.
Malfoy snorts. “It’s all right, Potter. As I said before, despite the fact that you always seem to wear robes that are a few sizes too large and that your hair is an atrocious mess—I do think you’re attractive.” For a moment, his playful façade fades away, and it sounds an awful lot like he’s being sincere.
“Okay,” Draco says, suddenly nervous, even as Potter helps him out of the rest of his clothes, even as Potter spreads him out on top of the sheets, on his hands and knees, face pressed into the pillow. Potter murmurs a lubrication spell, and it occurs to Draco that he’s never done this with someone else before—and maybe he should tell Potter that, but then Potter’s fingers are slick at his arse and he can’t speak.
Draco slid his hand away, and Harry felt the loss deep in his skin. “I don’t… I don’t really have anything that compares,” Draco admitted. “Except, well, feelings, I guess. And you don’t really want to hear about those.”
A just-barely-not-shirtless man jostles against Potter, pushing him forward, and suddenly their bodies are colliding and Potter’s warm against Draco, like every fantasy he’s ever had but
” Draco exclaims, his hips bucking, nearly choking Harry. But Draco’s cock feels so good in his mouth, a soft, heavy weight, musky and tasting of Draco, and he wants more, he wants it all.
“Did you read anything useful?” Hermione asks, taking the Butterbeer he hands her, and he nearly chokes. He’d forgotten he told her he was going to be studying.
Draco whines then, pressing his hand against the base of his cock. He’s close already. He hasn’t wanked in a week and the dream with Potter left him randy and wanting—fuck, he could probably stroke himself off in merely a few seconds, but.
“Anyway, don’t try to worm your way out of the subject,” Astoria says. “Are you sure it’s all right? Shall I cancel the Bentley’s appointment?”
Draco rolls his eyes. “There are charms for that, Harry.” He stretches, his long, lean arms flexing and bending above his head.
Draco is still vibrating with fury as he stalks into his own bedroom, spelling his clothes into the laundry because they’ve touched Potter and he needs them
“I didn’t used to,” Potter says. “It took time before I really felt comfortable hugging my friends all the time, even. I…” He looks away briefly, and when he looks back, there’s something contemplative in his eyes. “I wasn’t touched very much as a child.”
“All good, Seb?” Harry says a week later, as he walks into the shop on his way back from lunch with Ron. The shop is empty, as it usually is during the post-lunchtime lull when Harry takes his break.
“Oh,” Draco says, feeling acutely embarrassed—but it’s okay, at least. Harry isn’t disgusted by him.
Harry nearly leaves. He doesn't want to see it, not at all—he doesn’t want to see Draco touching someone else.
The worst part is that there’s a part of Harry that still wants—something. Wants Malfoy to at least mention what happened back then, to acknowledge that they’d once been—not friends, but more than acquaintances, he thinks. But as much as Harry wants him to fucking say something, Malfoy doesn’t breathe a word of it, instead avoiding Harry like a Spattergroit epidemic and barely speaking when they do meet.
Or—men’s quarters, he supposes. They’re well above legal age now, the few of them that have returned for their eighth year. It strikes Harry as strange. He doesn’t feel old enough to be considered an adult.
A knock on the door halted them in their discourse. Draco popped his head in, then opened the door all the way upon seeing the contents of the classroom.
that, both because it makes him vulnerable and because he knows Potter would laugh his arse off if he ever found out.
He can feel Draco relax. “Okay,” Draco says, and then he leans into Harry, shifting on the couch so that they’re closer.
They fall silent for a moment. Draco’s wand is still on the nightstand. If he opens his eyes, he can see it; he’s almost close enough to reach out and grab it, but he doesn’t.
“You do too,” Potter says, snorting. “I feel like when it comes to routines we’re about as incompatible as it gets.”
Harry wants to respond, but his mind is still stuck on the fact that Malfoy’s admitted his mate is a man. As in, there’s some man out there who’s perfect for Malfoy, someone who’s probably tall and handsome and has good vision and can buy Malfoy anything he wants—God.
Harry shudders a gasp, kissing back, brushing his lips against Malfoy’s again and again and stifling a moan—Merlin,
Malfoy looks startled, like the doe Harry once caught grazing in Hagrid’s vegetable garden. “Well,” he says slowly. “There’s also the fact that I can’t be friends with you because you won’t listen to me at all times, and I am obviously always right, so. There’s that.” He lifts his wand and starts painting again.
“God,” Harry mumbles, and when he lifts his head to look at Draco, his eyes have gone half-lidded with lust. “We shouldn’t.”
Harry smiles at him softly. “I am yours,” he says. But then, slowly, the smile falls from his face. “Do you—do you regret it? Mating with me?”
Draco rolls his eyes. “How many times do I have to say yes before you’ll believe me?” he asks, and Harry laughs.
He’s glad to be done with the department, he thinks. Thank God they don’t have to do presentations on their work—Ron said that was his least favorite feature of Auror training, and Harry thinks he’d have to agree.
But Salazar help him, he’s also feeling morbidly curious as well as the slightest bit vindictive. And Potter offered, didn’t he?
Harry rolls his eyes, laughing. “I didn’t like us much back then, obviously. We… we’ve had a lot of shit to work through. Like when I cut you open,” he says, a twinge of remorse pinging in his throat even now.
“I know this may sound harsh,” Draco says, “But worrying about it isn’t going to help you at all. If you really want to fix this, you can’t let your emotions or stress get in the way.”
Malfoy walks in, looking distressed, his hair rumpled. “I changed my mind,” he says, pulling the potion vial from his pocket. “I need you tonight.”
“I won’t,” Potter says. When Draco looks up, he’s beaming, which does very strange things to the butterflies in Draco’s stomach. “Anyway, we’ll be holding hands most of the time anyway. I doubt people will think to ask much.”
“F-fine,” Draco says, and he can feel himself flushing, which makes him want to get irritable because now he’s
He sits there and closes his eyes and wishes more than anything that Draco would come and hold him. He doesn’t, of course. Draco doesn’t want to be with him any longer.
“Aguamenti,” Harry cast, directing the small stream of water to the burning match. The flame fizzled quickly. “See, that really wasn’t bad, was it?”
Harry really doesn’t want to admit that he’s sulky about it. But apparently he broods enough that Esther raises an eyebrow at him as he putters around the shop, shoving wares back into their places. “Did you get dumped, Mr. Potter?”
He has only seconds to orient himself before Malfoy comes around the corner, an empty glass in hand. His dress shirt has thin black stripes on it this time, and the cuffs are rolled up to his elbows, exposing his forearms. Harry’s eyes catch immediately on his Dark Mark, faded but still visible, and when he looks back at Malfoy’s face he knows Malfoy’s noticed.
The hospital bed is much too cramped, but it’s not so bad, lying side by side with Harry’s head pillowed on Draco’s shoulder. Harry thinks that any place at all with Draco in it would probably be markedly improved, but especially right now they’re alone and warm and it’s perfect.
“Touch your cock,” Harry tells him, Summoning the lube from his bedroom and tossing the bottle over.
“Look at me?” Potter says, voice steady as he rolls his hips, pressing into Draco, stomach brushing against Draco’s cock with every pass. Draco has no choice but to look at him, to stare up into Potter’s eyes as Potter grins down at him, even as Draco lets out a surprised sob.
“Honestly? It’s probably a good idea,” Draco says. “Especially with how fast this thing is spreading. If I weren’t trying to help cure it, I’d have half a mind to stop going in too.”
“I’ve only had one Healer in,” Draco says. “We should be fine.” Even so, he picks up his wand, aiming a locking spell at the door—except it doesn’t work, and he swears. “Fuck, I keep forgetting that my magic isn’t working,” he says, briefly looking dismayed. “You better do it.”
“Of course,” Harry says, even though it’s kind of a lie. It’s fine. It’s not like this is even an issue anymore, seeing as Malfoy clearly hasn’t cared enough to try and contact him.
Draco swivels around to look at him, forcing himself not to react as he takes in Potter, real and in the flesh, leaning his arms on the low wall of Draco’s cubicle. He knows the report Potter’s talking about—it’d been last month’s most exciting case by far. “I finished that weeks ago,” he mutters. “You mean you
“If a bit of an idiot,” Malfoy tacks on, as if to cover for his moment of weakness, and Harry snorts.
“Fire,” Malfoy said after a while. A multitude of memories flashed through Harry’s mind: the Room of Requirement, hands clutching at his back, the acrid smell of smoke.
Hughes shrugs one shoulder as if moving both is too much effort—which it may well be, considering how old he looks. “Most young Unspeakables want something more… exciting.”
Draco dreads those visits more than anything. He feels sick for days afterwards, but it’s not bad enough that he wants anyone to see the effect they have on him, not even his friends. He’s stronger than that.
Draco wants to argue, but there’s a little piece inside of him that’s starting to realize that maybe she’s right. He thinks back over the past few years. Sometimes he barely sleeps when he thinks he’s onto something that could help her, even though it never really pans out. He threw himself into the Unspeakable program without a second thought when one of the Curse Breakers said it might be worth a shot, even though it’s well known as one of the most grueling programs in the Ministry.
“Lots of reasons,” Malfoy says, stopping and facing Harry. “One, I’m not given a choice in the matter. I swore the moment Voldemort died that I was never going to let someone control me like that again.” He pauses, shaking his head. “I know having a mate is different, and it’s supposed to be a good thing, but thinking about it just makes me feel—awful. And two…” He licks his lips nervously, and Harry has a sudden desire to reach out and comfort him. He doesn’t, of course, but the urge only intensifies when Malfoy continues. “It’s only a one-way bond,” Malfoy mumbles, looking more than a little distressed.
“Thank fuck,” Draco says, letting out a relieved sigh, and they disentangle themselves and stand. He misses touching Potter already.
More than anything, Draco doesn’t want to be trapped in that place with all the awful memories of things he’s said, things he’s done. All the times he’s fucked up. He thinks it might kill him, a slow, painful death, under assault of his very own life.
“I swear that never will I reveal the contents of my work to those unauthorized, unless under penalty of law,” the witch continues, and Harry, in trance, repeats the words with the other Trainees.
Harry feels warm. He’s still tipsy, and the thought of Draco in nothing but his pants and a thin t-shirt is making him flush. “Yeah. It’s okay,” he says.
“I feel alone.” They stared at each other tentatively, vulnerable. Draco shifted his arms, taking a shaky breath.
Despite the fact that he’s got him pinned down, Draco’s expression grows more serious. “I do like you,” he says in nearly a whisper.
He hadn’t imagined that it would be so soft, that Potter would slant their mouths together so gently, so carefully. He hadn’t imagined it would wreck him so, to have Potter’s hands at his waist, tugging him closer. He hadn’t imagined that it would be everything he’d wanted and more.
Potter flashes a grin at him as he walks off. Draco lets out a shaky breath, puts his face in his hands and wants and wants and wants.
A few minutes later, Harry’s cleared some of the clutter from his work table, and they’ve opened up their cartons of curry. Malfoy’s sitting in the same Easy-Shrink chair he’d been in yesterday—Harry hadn’t bothered to shrink it back again, and maybe he secretly wanted Malfoy to come back. At this point he doesn’t even know.
“Need you,” Draco mumbles against Potter’s mouth, and Potter nods, pulling away briefly to slick up his own cock. Then he’s back on Draco, kissing him dizzy, nipping lightly at his bottom lip as he positions his cock against Draco’s entrance.
“I’m not sure,” George says, frowning. “Thankfully I’ve got enough saved up that I’ll still be able to pay my employees and all, but I bet the smaller shop owners are out of luck.”
“Would you mind lending me your notes?” Potter asks, just as Draco figured he would. Not that he truly minds doing small favors for Potter—not if it gets Potter to smile at him like this.
,” Potter moans, eyelids fluttering, and Draco wants to cry as he pulls himself forward, pressing back onto the dildo again.
Harry stares, entranced, tracing the line of stars with his eyes. Malfoy’s—Draco’s—stars. But then he turns to thank him for it and sees that suddenly, Malfoy looks terribly lonely. “Are you all right?” Harry asks, alarmed.
Was this what burning alive would feel like? Sadness and heat and Draco’s hand around his cock? Because Harry felt like he was on fire, and every touch left a searing trail on his skin. But it was good, so good, and all he could do was let himself burn. “Mmph, Draco—” he gasped at the feeling of warm lips on his neck.
Harry shudders, embarrassment rising in his chest—but paired with the illicit feeling of being bound against the wall, held open and fingered by his “rival”, it’s just the right combination of feeling humiliated and feeling desperately, desperately turned on.
Ron shoves his hands in his pockets. “I figured we may as well be civil, since you’re dating—er. Shagging Harry.”
He breathes in, breathes out, and closes his mouth against the scream that wants to come out. Instead he takes another deep breath and slowly leans down to open his trunk, which has already appeared at the foot of his bed.
The flames dancing in the fireplace caught the corner of his eye, and he looked over, jumping when the flames suddenly turned green.
Harry catches a glimpse of Malfoy’s bright blond head as he passes by briefly a few stacks over, and anxiety stirs inside Harry—but beneath all of that anxiety is a strange glimmer of longing.
Astoria gives an exasperated sigh. “Look,” she says, and stares him down. “I’m going to die, Draco. I’m going to die, maybe sooner, maybe later, and what would you do if I died right now?”
Harry stares at the space in front of them, unremarkable except for being a tad bit dusty. “What’s supposed to—”
involve painting decide to flash through his brain, and he flushes brightly, oh Merlin—he sure hopes Malfoy can’t see.
Draco looks at the large box again, feeling a dull thud of abject horror as he reads the gaudily colored label.
,” Draco says, even though it’s a lie—Bentley’s is discreet and their employees are stunningly good in bed, much better than fucking someone in a grimy club loo.
“Well, firstly just in general,” Draco says, and Harry snorts. “But mostly for wanting... this. And wanting—me.”
” on his lips. He pulls frantically at Malfoy’s cock, and Malfoy comes soon after, gasping, tightening on Harry’s softening cock, coating Harry’s hand in slick wetness.
Sometime later, though exactly how long Harry’s lost track, Malfoy pulls out of him and casts his hand clean. “Turn over,” Malfoy says, and Harry does, lying flat on his back with a breath of relief as his muscles relax. Malfoy climbs over him and kisses him soundly, and then he pulls away, hovering over him. “You’re mad, you know?”
“Fuck,” Potter says, then shoots Draco a suspicious look. “Why aren’t you complaining more, anyway?”
“No doubt everyone would be angry if we fought,” Harry says, forcing a small smile onto his face even though most of the humor has left him. “’Cept maybe Ron. He’d probably join in.”
“Oh,” Draco says, a sudden thrill running through his spine. “Right.” Mirror-Potter never comes before Draco’s ready, of course, but this is
Draco sucks in a large breath and stares at the crumbling remnants of the building. The whole south side is gone, decimated by the fire that the Magical Flame and Explosion division of the DMLE is still putting out, and even in the moonlight he can see that many of the plants inside are charred and dead. He can’t imagine the smoke is good for the rest, either.
Draco leans into him, feeling a strange mixture of happiness and embarrassment and worry—but stronger than anything, love. “I think I might have too.”
Now that these awful feelings have made themselves evident, it’s the worst kind of torture to be literally sharing a desk with Potter. Draco can hear his every movement, Draco can hear him
, tired of pretending to be the Saviour of the Wizarding World and living up to all these expectations when all he wants is to lie down at the Burrow and nap. But he can’t, not with reporters finding him every time he sets foot into public, not with friends and acquaintances owling at any opportunity, and sometimes it’s too much, too much for his brain which has become oh-so-fragile, ready to crumple at any moment—
It’s just that something is off, something he can’t quite put his finger on, even as he slips his hand into Draco’s pants, even as he circles his fist around Draco’s cock and Draco’s eyes flutter shut with pleasure. Maybe it’s because they’re both terrified, he thinks, slicking Draco with his own pre-come as he strokes him, watching as Draco shudders and holds back moans and doesn’t quite meet his eyes.
“And you honestly think that’ll work for the whole summer, much less the school year?” Malfoy huffed.
At least Potter doesn’t seem surprised by his choice of clubs, giving a small nod next to him. “I went there once,” Potter says. “Was a bit, er, overwhelming by myself, though.”
At least there were no nightmares last night—just thoughts of this new, strange Malfoy, who doesn’t want to kill him or punch him or even sling insults at him like he once did; one who somehow actually wants to talk to Harry.
,” he says—it rips out of his throat, really—and suddenly they’re a mess of limbs and clothes and hands skating over skin. Draco’s never been more glad as they undress that his Mark faded so much after the war—and Potter’s already seen it more than once during Auror training, as he has with the faint scars that crisscross over Draco’s bared chest. It’s fine. It’s fine, and Potter
Draco can feel his defenses start to rise. All right, sure, he was a brat in school. But he likes to think he’s grown past that at this point, so why can’t Potter do the same? “I stopped complaining about things at about the same time my father forced me to get this,” he says, and drops Potter’s hand so he can yank up his left sleeve.
, okay,” he hears Malfoy say, and then Malfoy’s hands are spreading him open and Malfoy’s tongue is swiping hot against his arsehole.
Draco’s lip trembles. “Harry,” he breathes, and Harry nods above him, eyes wide, somehow looking just how Draco feels—scared and hopeful and happy all at the same time.
He can’t help himself from letting out a long, low whine, as Potter’s finger circles his arsehole once again.
“Hold the lift!” Potter calls, and Draco thankfully has a brief moment to collect himself before Potter comes running around the corner, dashing into the lift with him. “Thanks,” Potter says, cheeks pink from the brief exertion.
“So,” Ron says after dinner, where they’re sitting out in the backyard under a warming charm. “You two, huh?”
He’s not good at letting people in, Mother always said. Even as a child. He thought he’d let Astoria in, felt good about it even, but it seems he didn’t do such a good job of that either. And now there’s Potter…
“I’ll be careful,” Draco says then, his voice low in a way Harry’s never heard it before, and Harry only has time to think that oh God, this is actually
He never expected for the end of his sham of a marriage to hurt this much—mostly because he never expected it to end,
Heart in his throat, Harry obeys—he can’t really back out now, can he? So he follows the orb as it hovers through the air, walking down a hallway lit by torches, then up a set of stairs and finally down another hallway. At last the orb pauses in front of one of the doors lining the hall, and when Harry stands in front of it, the orb vanishes.
He’s a good liar and an even better Occlumens—probably the only two things that have kept him alive through three years of being an entirely unenthused fraud of a Death Eater.
So Malfoy wanted Time, then. Interesting. Harry has no interest in dealing with Time—it seems far too complicated, and after seeing the immense potential for chaos when Hermione took him back in time during their third year at school, he’s absolutely certain he wants nothing to do with it.
Harry’s throat goes dry as the plug presses all the way in, stretching him in all the right ways, and he nods, incapable of speech.
“You can. Harry, you don’t even…” Draco’s crying now, sobbing, knuckles white around the bars of his cell. “You could get away with it. They let you bring your wand in without even asking, didn’t they? Just say you were getting rid of the last living Death Eater, and they’ll pardon you. They’ll fucking applaud. So just do it!”
“Morning,” she says, and then, with a rueful smile, “You wouldn’t happen to have any hangover potion about, would you?”
“Whatever, Potter,” Draco says, and watches him leave, his chest burning. He has no idea why Potter even wants to come back. It’ll only serve to torture him, Potter real and in front of him, close enough to touch but still not close enough.
“Potter—” Draco says, a choked off sound, and he reaches over and jerks at Harry’s pants. Harry pauses just long enough to wriggle them off, heart in his throat as Draco does the same, and then Draco rolls on top of him, finally meeting his eyes. “This is... all right for you too, right?” Draco asks.
He has to look away. He doesn’t want to see Malfoy’s expression when he says what he should have said in the pub—what he’s wanted to say ever since they kissed.
“What? Why?” Malfoy scoffs, his brow wrinkling. “Everyone loves you, Potter. You saved the whole fucking wizarding world.”
He missed holding Harry, kissing him, missed it so fucking much that sometimes it hurt just to be sitting next to him at work—because he couldn’t
Harry takes the book, opening it to where the parchment is, and sees it’s most definitely Hermione’s handwriting.
“I wish you would just take care of yourself before Malfoy,” Hermione says, but she drops his arm anyway.
They scowled at each other, both breathing heavily from all the shouting. It was Harry who gave into the urge to shove Malfoy. Soon they were rolling on the floor, unbridled anger filling Harry with the urge to embed his knuckles in Malfoy’s face. But Malfoy’s stupid limbs were too sharp, and Harry kept getting elbowed in the gut until he finally relented and rolled away.
If he looks out the open door to their office suite, he can just barely make out the outline of the glittering Amortentia fountain. He knows now that the magical signature of anyone who takes it is immediately recorded upon ingestion—it’s necessary, after all, for such a dangerous potion to be well supervised. He’s surprised that they hadn’t gotten in trouble for taking it so often, though he supposes that what Adams said at the beginning is certainly true—the Unspeakables are a greedy lot, taking any chance they can get to further their research.
The announcer voice chimes on a second later. “Attention. Unfortunately, there has been an error in lift services, and maintenance has been notified. Please wait patiently while our maintenance wizards repair the problem. Thank you.”
“Even when I left,” Malfoy says, pressing the words into the skin in front of Harry’s ear. “Every time I left, I wanted to stay.”
The pasta timer goes off with a sharp beeping sound, making them both jump. Harry pulls away, breathing heavily, and lets out a frustrated sigh. “Er.”
Draco jumps a foot into the air, looking around in blind panic because he’s sure Potter isn’t back yet—and, oh. The mirror. “Merlin, Fuck
Harry nods again, feeling shaky with lust and exertion and the continuing aftershocks of his orgasm. Malfoy undoes his bonds, one by one—first Harry’s left leg, then his right, and finally his wrists—
Draco snorts. “Even when I was a snobby little arsehole and you were a boy with terrible hair and a penchant for saving people? No, strike that—your hair’s still terrible.”
Of course, Harry’s stomach also decides to start fluttering madly the moment Malfoy looks at him. Almost as if Harry has some sort of crush on Malfoy.
Malfoy gives a hollow laugh. “It’s fine. You had nothing good to say about him. It was enough that you spoke at both Mother’s and my trials.” He shakes his head, a wry smile on his lips. “I suppose I never thanked you for that.”
, I’m not an undercover Auror. I quit the Aurors during training because my entire life was going to shit and they told me they were going to hold me back from graduating because I wasn’t ‘enough of a team player.’ So thanks for assuming I’m only here to fuck with you, feels brilliant. Cheers.” He slams his glass down on the table.
Malfoy had heard him approach, apparently, because he narrowed his eyes at Harry for a moment. He then blinked, turning back to the water and not acknowledging him further. Harry decided that it was a good enough invitation to sit down a few feet away.
“There are other things too,” Harry points out, and he can feel himself flushing. For some reason this is even more embarrassing than admitting he wants to shag Malfoy, but he says it anyway. “We held hands. I thought that was nice.”
Does he want it badly enough? Even though it’s probably more than a bit fucked up—and even knowing Draco might throw him out of the room anyway?
,” he says, and he hadn’t meant to say Draco’s name but it slipped out on its own as his hips buck wildly. He spills all over his hand, looking back up just in time to see Draco tilt his head back and moan—
“I decline to answer that,” he says, not looking back, and she laughs, thankfully letting him off the hook.
that Harry thinks he’d rather die than say aloud. But if the small smile on Malfoy’s face is any indication, he understands exactly what Harry means.
“Because I didn’t think you were taking this seriously,” Malfoy tells him, eyes cautious. “To be honest, I’m still not sure. You—you had the same look in your eye that everyone else does at first, when they find out I’m a vampire. Like you were only there for the danger of it.” His lips twist. “That’s all anyone wants from me anymore.”
It’ll be better even though he crawls into his bed at his flat, nearly in tears at the thought that soon he won’t love Harry any longer, at the thought of not feeling happy again until the next time he takes the potion, and Merlin,
“I know,” Draco says, and there are tears streaming down his cheeks. “But,” he continues, scrubbing at his eyes, thinking of Mother’s words. “Isn’t i-it... Don’t you think it’s better to have had this than to not?”
Potter nods once. He doesn’t speak again as he leaves the room, every step a crack in Draco’s heart, and Draco has the slightest suspicion it’s because he’s already crying.
“Maybe it’s just a fluke,” Draco says, staring at his wand. “Or maybe one of the potions they’re giving me is actually working.”
“Loads of people go to this school,” Harry points out. “You could ask any of them. Ask a first year. They don’t know you.”
Malfoy holding him, warm and secure. Malfoy leaning over him, warmth in his eyes, pressing into Harry like a lover. Malfoy, saying his name in ways that make Harry’s heart flip, even now.
But what else is he supposed to do when he can barely walk out in public without getting called a Death Eater? Everything reminds him of the war, even now, everything and everyone except Astoria.
“That’s a load of tripe and you know it, Potter. I’m sure this is just so they can monitor us, and the minute we start fighting, they’ll kick me out of here—“
“It was rather fascinating, actually. We were talking all about ancient rituals—oh,” she says, looking at Malfoy all of a sudden. “How come you’re not taking it anymore? You were always quite good.”
Potter aims a glare at him. “Okay, yeah, a bit, but.” He shrugs helplessly. “Anyway, I didn’t want to say no to you, but I also really didn’t want to take the potion, so I just… didn’t.”
racing through his veins and pooling in his groin. He’s so fucking hard he feels like he could come immediately—if Malfoy would just touch his cock.
Draco squints at him. “What the fuck, Potter?” They’ve been skipping all the partnered questions, opting to work on their surveys in silence. But Draco can’t help it—he’s curious.
Wandering the halls of Hogwarts had always been comforting when he couldn’t sleep. Tonight was no different. The flickering light of the torches battled with the darkness of the outside world—no moon was shining tonight, though the sky was free of clouds. Others thought it creepy. Harry thought it soothing. The darkness of the corridors felt like home, and even the shadows felt safer than being trapped in his bed.
“Hang on, hang on,” Ron interjects, and they both turn back to look at him. “Before you two start—flirting, or whatever, blimey, this is weird—have you seen ‘Mione around?”
“They do too,” Malfoy says. “Word travels fast, and it’s not like it’s a secret—you’re the savior, and I’m scum of the earth. Obviously.” He scoffs, possibly at himself, and turns to walk away. “You know what? Forget it, Potter. This was a stupid idea anyway.”
Harry’s hope deflates, punctured by an invisible knife. Of course Draco wouldn’t be here. He’s sick anyhow.
“Fuck me,” Draco says, and it comes out all dumb and soft—but the way Potter’s face lights up makes it worth it.
It’s from Draco, he realizes, and he wonders if Draco’s angry at him for taking so long to come by and visit.
Harry could feel the shudder that ran through Draco’s body. They were so close, and Harry wanted… he wanted…
“Fuck,” Potter mumbles, adjusting his position as he presses inside him, again and again, and then—“Yeah. I know.”
“It is,” Hermione agrees. “It’s incredibly hard to catch, too—there aren’t symptoms until the magical core damage has already started, but you’re contagious for days beforehand. And—” She cuts off, shaking her head with a morose expression. “And no one has any idea how to stop it.”
It’s some minutes later, when they’ve cleaned themselves up a bit and are lying side by side, that he says, “For the record, I still think you’re mad, Potter.”
“You can’t sleep either,” Harry says, and Malfoy pauses in the middle of yet another portrait. The paintings are slowly getting better, even Malfoy can admit at this point, but it’s still going to take time before his portraits look like the ones dotted all over the Hogwarts walls.
Draco nods curtly, not trusting himself to say anything as the lift starts to move. Tonight will definitely be a mirror night, he thinks. No doubt about it.
Draco still doesn’t really feel like talking right now, so he shrugs. Thankfully Potter shuts up and just stands there beside him, which suits Draco just fine, because he can nearly ignore Potter if he stops making noise.
He hears Draco behind him, following him, of course. It’s not long before Draco’s arms are trying to encircle him, but he pushes them away. “Go away,” he mutters, and he’s usually stronger than Draco, but somehow Draco has gotten a hold of him and locked him tightly in an embrace.
“What’s in this for you, anyway?” Harry asks, quiet in the still room, asks even though he’s almost certain Malfoy will lie.
Draco can’t look at Potter anymore. “It is nice,” he says, fiddling with the end of his fork. “But that doesn’t mean we’re in a relationship.”
After that, he uses the mirror more nights than not, despite the fact that every single fucking time he feels guilt rise in him like a sickness. Still, he can’t help returning to the mirror night after night. Work is taxing—tensions are high because they’re due for evaluations soon—and he’s so bloody tired of trying to hide his expression whenever Potter is near him. This helps to take the edge off, at least for brief moments in the safety of his room, and he’s come to crave it nearly as much as he craves seeing Potter in real life.
“I could definitely see that,” Potter says. Then he squeezes Draco’s hand. “I hope you don’t mind too much now, then.”
Malfoy snorts. “Figures,” he says. “Something that barely registers for you was so—important to me. Back then, at least.”
Smiling back weakly, Draco says, “Dire times, Potter.” Then he gives both Harry and Ron a nod and grasps a handful of powder on the mantle, throwing it into the fire before he goes.
Then he leans down and kisses Harry, slides a hand down Harry’s stomach, and takes his cock in hand.
“Oh,” Harry says, but he can’t find it in himself to be angry anymore. It’s all leeched away, tempered by the hunch of Malfoy’s shoulders and the tremble in his jaw.
“This used to be my grandfather’s sister’s home. Her son, who inherited it, ended up marrying a Muggle, and they lived here before they were disowned,” he shrugs. “At least, that was what I was told. Anyway, this stuff is disgusting, you can have it.”
“Okay,” Harry says, and then racks his brain. “Sometimes I imagine you just—climbing on top of me, and having your way with me, and it being fine, and feeling—fuck. Really good.”
Either way, he rarely has time to bother wanking, let alone fantasize about having a shag. At least, that’s what he tells himself. The truth of the matter is that he’s always fucking terrified of catching himself fantasizing about Potter in ways that he shouldn’t be—it’s too intoxicating, and more than anything, he doesn’t want to somehow delude himself into thinking that Potter could actually
“My wife… she didn’t have a chance! I could never have gotten to her in time… If only I were a bit closer, maybe I could have gotten her out of the way,” he moans, tears leaking down his face as he speaks to the reporter. “I was hit in the arm by debris from the blast,” he motions to a large bandage on his shoulder. “But I would give anything… anything, to have my Marie back…”
“Yeah. Okay,” Harry said, and then he shut his eyes because Draco’s fingers were trailing down his stomach…
He returns with another whiskey, and he’s barely sat down when Malfoy immediately starts in with, “Honestly, Potter, I didn’t even know you were into men.”
Harry comes. He climbs onto the bed to straddle Malfoy and kisses him, and he hates that it really does feel like the last time, like all of their walls are down, all the barriers they had in place to keep this from meaning too much suddenly gone.
Harry’s still secretly hoping that Draco can be convinced to bite him while they fuck. “You can top,” he says, and the slow leer of a smile that appears then on Draco’s face makes Harry’s mouth go dry.
, he begins, and then stares at the parchment for five solid minutes. He nearly Vanishes it. He doesn’t even know where to start.
And one emotion, love, did swell above the buzzing in Harry’s ears, protecting him from the awful truth of what he was about to do. “I’ll n-never forget you,” he said, trembling, wetness dripping from his eyes and nose. He felt like he was drowning.
Harry throws his textbook down in exasperation. “I still don't understand this bloody chapter,” he groans, rubbing a hand over his face and flicking his eyes toward the other man in the room—his study partner. “And I've made you stay late again too. Probably for nothing, since I'm going to fail the exam anyway at this point.”
He walks into the Ministry Atrium, heading toward the nearest Floo, when he feels a hand on his shoulder.
“Even if I told you I wanted to keep going?” Malfoy asks. Then he leans forward, lowering his voice. “Even if I begged?”
. “Fuck, fuck,” he groans, pressing up into Draco’s touch, and Draco seems to like that because he shudders in turn, pressing his hips so his cock aligns with Harry’s leg. “We should—if we do this for long I’ll, oh God,
He’s the one avoiding Malfoy now, turning corners so as not to run into him in the halls and timing his bedtime to when he knows Malfoy won’t be there. Dimly, he becomes aware that Malfoy’s probably avoiding him back, but thinking about that hurts even worse so he stops.
Most of all, he hates Potter for reminding Draco of just how much he wants him, for awakening again the yearning that’s lived for years between his ribs.
Instead, he looks relieved, and that hurts more than Harry expected to because—because Malfoy doesn’t
It’s four in the morning, and Harry’s just woken from a nightmare. Then he steps out to use the loo and promptly realizes that Malfoy’s bed is empty. He’s not usually out of bed at this hour.
Of course, sometimes the fantasies sneak up on him unawares—like in the middle of the night, in dreams where he’s helpless to stop them, Potter’s face and hands and body filling his mind, trapping him in with phantom touches and the ghost of Potter’s laughter.
“So don’t yell at me for it,” Harry says, but there’s no bite to the words as they leave his mouth. He thinks he’s less sad about getting reprimanded than he is about the thought of never getting to kiss Draco again.
Which is probably true, Harry concedes. But he’s still bracing himself for an argument, so he’s surprised when Ron relents, simply shrugging and says, “No, I s’pose not.”
In another time, it might have annoyed Harry, if he hadn’t had those same exact thoughts many times over. It occurs to Harry then that he’s not angry Malfoy’s here anymore, not at all.
“We’ll fight if we’re together, you know.” Draco says. “I expect we’ll row something fierce. Doesn’t that count as hurting me?”
It’s the most elegant of all the rooms and by far the most beautiful, all done in white wood, the doors accented with delicate archways. The large Amortentia fountain in the center fills the main chamber with the smell of the most wondrous things, treacle and broomsticks and Ron and Hermione’s flat, and Harry takes a deep breath in and holds it until he thinks his lungs might give out. He exhales, looking around once more, eyes skating over the works of art that are lining the walls, ones said to encapsulate loving moments throughout history.
“…Harry. Say something,” Draco spoke softly, his voice cracking. Harry looked at him, into his eyes—he looked as terrified as Harry felt, and vulnerable—
Hermione beams, rushing over to hug him. “Oh Harry, I’m so happy for you,” she says. Then she turns to Draco, raising an eyebrow. “I still have half a mind to hex you, you know.”
, Potter—that’s… fuck,” he groans, throwing himself into the fantasy. “I’ve—I’ve wanted this for so long.”
“Don’t forget that we hated each other for half of our lives,” Draco says, and Harry lets out a watery laugh.
He loses himself in the rhythm of casting charms, doing several batches of items at once, then testing each one in turn and putting them on their proper shelves. His usual charms go quickly, as he knows them by heart at this point, but once he reaches the dwindling stock of automated children’s toothbrushes that he spelled onto his to-do list half a week ago, he has to lug out his big binder full of charms recipes.
“Draco,” Neville says, then stops, shaking his head. “You know what? I’m not even going to try to argue about this with you. It’s my company, and I’m going to turn around and pretend this whole fight never happened, and you two are going to clean up in here and come to some sort of agreement by the time I get back. Yeah?”
“Mm,” Harry nods, still reeling from the intensity of Draco’s smile. They start to strip down to their pants and Draco finishes first, running forward and jumping into the pool as soon as he’s done. Harry moves to follow, but stops near the edge, suddenly uncertain.
He doesn’t want to think about what the Dark Lord would say if he knew he was baiting Potter with information. He doesn’t plan on letting him find out.
Draco has spent his whole life reading between his Mother’s somber words. ‘He still thinks he was in the right,’ she is saying. ‘He is blind to everything that would say otherwise, including us.’
Harry stops moving, and then he pulls his fingers out, leaving Draco empty and wanting. “Draco. You don’t have to be.”
He walks out of his room, moving quickly now. Nothing is amiss in the dining room or the large kitchen—the stove and oven are both off. He looks through the entryway, but there’s nothing of interest in there, and the rest of the Manor he doesn’t even bother checking. He’d blocked off all of the other rooms years ago so he didn’t have to think about the horrors they once held.
Startled, Harry opens his mouth to say something, anything, but he’s too slow—Malfoy steps right through the curtain and is gone.
Blaise, oddly enough, wasn’t surprised to hear about his relationship with Harry. None of his friends were, and neither Granger nor Weasley were all that surprised on Harry’s end either, it seems. Which—why the fuck did no one
More than ever, Harry appreciates Ginny’s resilience as they both hug her again. He’s known her to hold out through almost anything, whether it be war or heartbreak or the death of a brother.
“Sorry,” Harry says quickly, and Draco shakes his head. “I know, I know, you tell me not to apologize, but—I feel bad for asking you things you don’t want to say.”
“Well how would you like it if people did the opposite? If everyone you had ever known avoided you, and sneered at you, and sent you Howlers? I would love to be you, Potter, everyone would love to be you—“
Somehow, they’ve made it an entire year in their weird, sometimes dysfunctional relationship, one where they quarrel at least half as often as they fuck. Draco sometimes still wonders what the hell he’s doing dating Potter, of all people, especially when he’s angry with him.
“Wait,” Harry gasps out, because he’s growing hard, and Malfoy looks terrified and intense all at once as he leans closer and brushes his knuckles against Harry’s erection.
She only gives him one vial of Dreamless Sleep, enough for two doses. “It can be addictive if you take it too often. This is not a permanent solution,” she tells him sternly, nightcap tilting to one side as she yawns. “But... for just this once, I’ll give it to you.”
Malfoy lowered his wand, but the nervousness at his edges didn’t cease. “Of course not,” he muttered. “Are we going to get on with whatever flobberworm-brained plan you’ve come up with or not, Potter?”
“How the hell do you have a telly here? These things don’t work around magic,” Harry frowns, a little jealous.
He pauses, chewing on the end of his quill—a disgusting habit, he knows, but he’s never been able to curb it—while he considers whether or not to tell her about Potter.
“It seems you two are unaware of what happened today, so I’ll tell you. This afternoon, there was a magical bombing just outside the Leaky Cauldron,” she said gravely.
Draco makes a face. “Some nurse came and told them they have to leave, that there’s no use sitting here when they can’t even visit. She only stopped bothering me when I showed her my Mungo’s ID.”
“Oh,” Harry says, alarmed. He doesn’t think he could ever intentionally cause someone that much pain, even if he weren’t really in love with them—which he supposes is exactly what Malfoy is getting at. “God, I didn’t even think of that.”
Blaise, Pansy, and Millie all snort out loud at that. Draco glares at them. He’d always known Greg was his only true friend, because only
?” Harry says, now utterly confused. Out of all the things he could have expected to hear from Malfoy after two weeks of silence, this is certainly the least of them.
He’s astonished to see Father walk into the room at the tail end of breakfast, face grim, looking somehow as if he has aged ten years since Draco saw him last. “Draco,” he says with a nod of hello.
And she did. It’s been over seven years since they left Hogwarts, and already she’s been awarded multiple (additional) Order of Merlins for her services to the wizarding world.
“That’s precisely why I’m annoyed. You have the ability to have a normal, regular, possibly grand life and you’re squandering it.” Malfoy scoffs. “You’re the fucking Chosen One.”
They don’t hate each other anymore, Harry thinks, and he wonders exactly when that happened. Malfoy still seems suspicious of him, but that had faded away as the night went on, and anyway it’s not like they’re at each other’s throats anymore.
Draco doesn’t even dodge. He just lets the punch hit him, savoring the sudden pain of Potter’s knuckles against his mouth, the taste of blood. Maybe if he lets Potter beat him up, he won’t feel so fucking
Again, Harry stopped him. “Why were you in France?” His tone was more accusatory than he meant it to be, and he realized the mistake only after he had spoken.
“All right, the Recupersanguis is used to counter certain nasty curses that attempt to remove blood forcibly from the body. It can be the difference between life and death when handling a cursed artifact, so pay attention.” He stood sideways, so that Langley could see his wand motions. He then demonstrated the movement several times, drawing the wand into a circle followed by a sharp jab. “Make sure that the ‘cup’ part of the spell happens when your wand is at the top of the circle, and that the ‘guis´ precisely lines up with the jab.”
“What if I don’t want to?” Draco asks, and really he’s just being contrary at this point. “You get to see your friends all the time.”
Harry had not officially graduated that day, but even so, he felt a page slowly rip from the book that was his life. He couldn’t go back now, not with all of the younger students there that practically worshipped him, not without all of his friends. McGonagall had recently started hinting that she wanted him to take the Defense Against the Dark Arts teaching position, but even that seemed so foreign as to be terrifying. He hadn’t even taken his NEWTs in the subject—how could he be expected to teach it to others?
