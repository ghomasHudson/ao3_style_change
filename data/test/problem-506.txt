“Thanks. I’ll see you tomorrow, Ron.”
Harry straightened up and admired his work. Malfoy, Mr. Only-Sleeps-An-Hour-A-Night, was comfortable and warm, and he had been asleep for at least twenty minutes that Harry knew of, so perhaps this would be the night Malfoy would break the record.
Harry shrugged. "He's been through a lot. Things change. To be honest, I don't think he ever really wanted to go as Dark as he did. I reckon that was more his dad."
Harry felt his face flush. "No, no, no, it's not that! I know how they're made, I just...all I meant by that was how could gay couples use this potion? You said the donors have to add reproductive DNA, right? Which, by normal means, wouldn't make a baby."
"It's been fine," Draco said, trying to sound confident in his vague answer.
Malfoy reaches over, runs a hand up and down Teddy’s back. “Everything’s alright, little one. No one’s angry with you.”
Draco began to gather his scattered things, hoping maybe he was hallucinating the Lovegood girl. He had to be. Who in their right mind would willingly and so kindly speak to someone who had locked them up in a cellar for months?
"Be that as it may," she said slowly after a moment, "like you, Mr. Malfoy was forced into several impossible situations with terrible choices, many of which I am certain he has regretted since the moment he made them."
"Well, good riddance, I say," Ron murmured.
Harry watched her turn and storm from the bar. He was supposed to follow her, he was sure of it. Harry lifted a hand and waved to Aberforth.
Again, Harry looked over at Malfoy, who was diligently taking notes.
Draco felt eyes on him and looked up to find Josh glaring daggers at him from across the Hall.
“Uh, Draco. And me.”
"Draco, honey?" His mother's voice calling softly to him shook Draco from his musings. "Dinner is ready...if you'd like to eat."
After almost six weeks of of Teddy’s general inhabitance, the bedroom has transformed. On the walls now hang a multitude of toddler art; smeared paintings, scribbled drawing, attempts at cut-out shapes, and one memorable clay sculpture that sits atop a floating shelf. The bed is now adorned in basic sheets for Teddy’s naps, and the bookshelf is steadily filling, both with a fair amount of children’s books that Draco can't keep himself from buying and a couple baskets of assorted toys. There’s life in the room now, a life and space that’s all Teddy’s.
"I'm talking to you, you bastard!" Josh hollered.
Harry groaned softly, saying, "Technically, it's the reception. You're already married."
It was fascinating.
Grinding his teeth and not feeling terribly hungry himself anymore, Harry shovels the rest of his own food into his mouth, swallows bitterly before leaving the table. He goes about the kitchen, cleaning the day’s messes as he watches Teddy from the corner of his eye. Practically sitting backwards in his chair, he’s squirming angrily, shooting glares at his food every so often. Harry looks at the clock. Bath time is still easily an hour away. Surely Teddy will eat just to be rid of the job and play?
Harry blinked. "What?"
At Slughorn's words, the class was in motion. Hermione was the first to the cauldrons, followed by the table of Ravenclaws, then the Hufflepuffs. Ron remained in his seat and shared a panicked look with Harry from across the room. There was no way two hours was enough time to not only figure out what the poisons were, but to concoct three separate antidotes correctly.
"How did you find out?"
“Er...” How long can he and Malfoy possibly continue to see each other twice a day, five days a week until they inevitably draw their wands and land them both in trouble? “We hadn’t really discussed an exact timeline.”
"Not as loud, I'll give you, but I bet he's still the same spoiled, conniving piece of work he's always been."
"Morning, morning," he said. "We've been doing a lot of notes lately, hmm? I think it's time we did something a bit more practical, what do you all think?"
At the door, there was a sudden knock.
She made an impatient sound. "Could you please tell Ronald over here that sometimes, people
"Because I'm Harry fucking Potter." And because he couldn't believe he had actually said that, Harry giggled.
whispering. His voice carries over the speaker’s story, and Harry feels hundreds of eyes crash like boulders all over him.
Draco had done a rather good job of avoiding Potter since walking out on him the morning after waking in Gryffindor Tower. They only had two lessons together, and Professors Slughorn and Sprout made his job far easier by spending the week lecturing and assigning tests. He didn't look at Potter, didn't answer him, and practically ran from him when the bells rang.
"You might not see it, but you are worthy of forgiveness."
“He ate well enough today," Draco says. "Don’t push it. Otherwise, we’ll just end up with a meltdown.”
And look how things ended up regardless.
Harry ground his teeth. "That was entirely different."
"Oh," Harry said. He chuckled once. "Makes sense."
Harry launches himself out of the blankets, sends them flying as he leaps to his feet and raises his hands, turning toward the voice.
Harry lets the door swing shut to face Malfoy directly.
Fresh shrieks wash over him as Teddy’s sobs regain volume. Tears are streaming down his chubby cheeks and his body quakes with each hiccup. Harry hugs him hard.
It wasn't just the timing and the weather and his friends' pleas that had Harry leaving the relative privacy of the castle that Saturday. The day before, Harry had bumped into Luna, who mentioned that Malfoy was also planning to visit Hogsmeade, something he apparently hadn't done all year, either.
A sheepish grin spread across Harry's face. "Just trying to make conversation. If you just helped me, I wouldn't have to sound like an idiot all the time."
"Today's the day!"
"Yeah, just..." Harry trailed off, eyes drifting back over to where Malfoy had disappeared into the storeroom.
Keeping his finger where it was, Harry took his other hand from Draco's waist and move it between them, making sure to drag the fingers across Draco's stomach teasingly. He heard Draco's breath hitch slightly, then he wrapped his hand around Draco's cock and gave it a gentle tug.
“Er...not tonight, Teddy.”
He didn't need to hear anything more.
But, scarce as the customers were compared to the norm, Draco still felt eyes on him as he followed Potter into the pub. Potter was removing his hat, scarf, and mittens as he walked, but Draco kept his on, not wanting to draw even more attention to himself.
Harry leans down closer to Teddy so he can be heard. “You’re getting a bath in five minutes, so get it out now. I’ll be back.”
"You're just trying to save me," Draco croaked after some time. "Aren't you? Just some pathetic former Death Eater queer that can't even stop himself from being blown up by a couple of kids. The perfect project."
“Wh- no, not like that,” Harry stutters, eyes on Ms. Dribble shuffling into the kitchen area. “Not
“And do you think I was just acquitted of my crimes, Potter? You want to know what I’ve had to do every week for the past eighteen months and for the next year and a half as well?” A slightly manic, a very manic, definitely forced laugh punctures the air between them. “You’ll fucking love it; I have to go to a healer that is attempting to undo nearly two decades of what he’s trying to tell me is child abuse that landed me in all this shit in the first place!
Draco snapped back to the present. "What?"
A series of emotions flush Harry as he watches Malfoy, watches as his face tenses and crumples simultaneously, his body just as opposing in on itself. There’s uncertain guilt in Harry's middle for not being more concerned about how Malfoy was managing after losing everything, frustration that the git didn’t just ask for help in the first place, and sudden panic at the realization that Hermione's crazy idea was even more on the mark than she could have known.
No, Harry still loved Draco and didn't see that changing anytime soon. He was just at a horrible, complete, and total loss as to what he could do.
Draco felt lost. He was pretty sure that they sun had already set, hadn't it?
“Oh, Draco told you?”
Draco's head snapped up. "What do you mean, like my mother?"
"That's awfully gross, you know."
"Wow," Draco said, admiring the gold band now on his finger. "Engaged. Never thought I'd do it."
Malfoy shot him a confused look.
Gritting his teeth, Harry all but sprints the remaining distance and Disapparates.
The old Auror looks up, frown etching deeper the wrinkles in his face as he lowers the parchment, eyeing Harry. “Well,” he begins slowly, “those in Azkaban for...well, it’s the Death Eaters and their sympathizers that are causing much of the trouble. Those that were imprisoned before the dementors’ leave know there is a weakness in the system now, and those that arrived after are only giving strength to the revolts. It’s making the containment of these parties more difficult than I think many imagined.” When no one else speaks, Planters returns to his scroll. “So, to begin, we will...”
His mother nodded. "I know. But this is too good an opportunity for you, Draco." She smiled sadly. "A fresh start, a way to complete your education properly so that you have all the tools you'll need to make your way through this new world."
Damn. Already,
"I was here, too, Josh," Neville said. "You don't think I remember? But you know what I remember? That he sucked at what the Carrows had him do! He didn't want to do it anymore than any of us would've!"
His surprise must have shown, because Potter asks, “Did you forget I’m training to be an Auror?”
A strange sadness took hold of Draco, pulling at his heart as painfully as though it were trying to rip the organ through his ribcage. He wasn't necessarily responsible for Teddy being so terribly orphaned, but guilt swam through Draco's veins as the little boy babbled and made to crawl into his lap.
"No, ma'am," he said quickly.
It’s clear Hermione tries to keep her eyes from rolling, but she fails. “It’ll make Harry’s life easier if they can get along. What, do you want Harry to be miserable and drawing his wand everyday for the next year so you don’t have to hear Draco’s name?”
“Potter, I swear to-”
“Ah-wee?”
"It isn't, but I can respect your need for privacy."
"Ha ha," Harry said, pulling Draco up by the arm. "Now get your clothes off, I can't seem to figure them out."
“Harry! Hey, Harry!”
“You were right about the park.”
"I didn't know where else to take you. But I couldn't just leave you there."
At one point, he had needed to use the lavatory, and one his way back, Draco had been found by a group of students that he barely recognized. They had spewed insults and threats, which he had silently let wash over him, but his passiveness only seemed to infuriate them. The next thing Draco knew, he had been on the floor and was being pummeled as though by muggles in an alley, then abandoned when his nose began to bleed.
"You're better off looking for some little first year boy that actually likes girls."
"Trying to have a conscience now?" she hissed dangerously. Though speaking softer than before, Pansy's voice easily carried across the room. "Wormed your way out of trouble with the law, now you're just going to sit here and force yourself on us all? No one wants you here, least of all any of us," she said, gesturing to the crowded common room. "You should just get out before something awful happens to you."
"I know if we turned them in, Professor McGonagall would see that you were never treated like that again. At least at Hogwarts."
Draco looked over and found Harry taking slow, long blinks. He obviously wasn't much of a morning person.
“And...and if I’m deemed unfit...?”
"Right."
Malfoy froze, hands full of scraps and eyes falling to the ground. "I...I don't know what you mean."
Potter let his hand fall, and the chill that took its place extended into Draco's chest as a feeling he didn't want to describe settled within. They looked at one another for a few seconds before Potter stepped around Draco and descended the stairs, disappearing into the darkness of the castle.
"You heard me." And Draco shot a well-placed Tickling Charm at the boy, harmless but obnoxious. Insane cackles echoed around Draco as he passed the doubled-over boy and his friend, climbing the final staircase to the entrance hall.
“I just don’t think he’s doing much growing right now,” Draco says with a shrug. “He’ll eat more when he’s going through a growth spurt.”
“Excellent. So, as far as length, renewability, this contract will expire on...” Mr. Cook glances down the scroll, reading toward the bottom. “...at 11:59 in the evening on Friday, the first of June, 2001.”
“One night isn’t going to ruin him,” Harry says as he starts the bath. Teddy lifts his head at the sound.
Their Clamor Beta snapped its quill in half with a soft crack, then erupted into loud, furious cries. It couldn't move from it's pot, but the fury in its wails and the straining of its roots make it very clear that, if it could, the little shrub would gladly wrap its branches around their throats. Harry dove into his bag in search of something else to give it.
"Er...I'll just get the ingredients, then, shall I?"
"That's a relief," said a voice behind them. "Because Ron looks like he's only a quarter hour to blacking out."
Harry kissed his way back to Draco's mouth, licking his way into those lips. Draco moaned on Harry's tongue and pushed himself off the wall, guiding Harry backward toward the bed. The backs of Harry's legs hit the soft mattress, but he stayed firm when Draco made to push him over.
He was trying, but nothing was happening. It was as though the past several months had never happened. Draco was sitting beside Harry in Herbology, trying to gulp down any air his lungs would allow, shaking, fighting the urge to bolt from the room the entire lesson. The only difference was that this time, Harry's hand rested on his knee, gently stroking it in a vain and private effort to comfort him.
"I didn't know you liked to read."
"That doesn't mean anything!"
"Uh...have you?" Draco immediately regretted asking. There was no possible way that this was the right time or place to have asked that particular question.
Draco’s head spins as he blindly reaches out and wraps his arms around the bundle in his lap;
“So...” Harry clears his throat, tries not to grin when Draco opens his eyes to glare at him. “Er, how did toilet training go?”
He groaned, throwing the blankets from his body as he stood up, giving up hope on sleep for the time being as his legs began to ache. Draco pulled on his discarded pants and threw on his cloak.
“I’m not even properly astounded that you can’t count,” Draco scoffs. “And Teddy doesn’t know those witches. Between the
Draco couldn't help but chuckle at that.
Both Care-Seekers nod. Mr. Cook stands then, and Harry hastily follows suit. The rise is clumsy with Teddy still glued to him, and Harry strains not to look as out of sorts as he feels.
That was the tipping point, and Draco dove in headfirst, didn’t look back. He was embraced by Teddy and, bizarrely, Andromeda, and he became something of a bewildered nanny in the year that followed. He took care of Teddy, played with him, fed him, changed him, sang him lullabies. It feels as if Teddy is his own, something that Draco would do absolutely anything for in order to keep safe. There’s nothing Draco wouldn't do for Teddy.
“Well, while Kara takes the tour,” Mr. Cook says mildly, “I can check in with you two. First and foremost, how are you doing, Teddy?”
The warming spring air of late April slaps Draco in the face as he frantically escapes-
Harry’s jaw locks. His knees stop bouncing so visibly. “That’s just a butterknife, it’s not even sharp.”
There was, however, a distinctly warm and meaty smell drifting from the kitchen as he passed, causing Draco to stop.
Harry reaches Teddy first, scooping him into a hug as Malfoy shuts the water off. Hugging Teddy tightly, Harry stands, shushing. “I’m sorry, Teddy.”
As if to emphasize her point, Karen fell back into her armchair and kicked her feet up onto the armrest. A few onlookers laughed, and quiet conversations began to replace the sticky silence. Pansy continued to glare at Draco, her face much too close to his despite there being easily three feet of space between them. He could only breathe in her perfume for a few more moments before having to finally turn his face away.
You stole the sun from-
The terror in Draco's eyes squashed out the confusion in Harry's heart, and he closed the door behind him before dropping onto the living room floor with a grin.
The warm September winds were pushed aside as the chill of October swept over the Hogwarts grounds, Halloween on the horizon. Harry walked along the empty corridor the Saturday before the Halloween Feast, holding back a shiver.
There’s a ringing in Harry’s ears, drenched in electric horror. “B-but what-”
"Yeah, but I was never asked to write any new laws." Harry shook his head, smiling. "You're really something, Hermione."
Harry lifted up slightly to make room for his hands as they reached between himself and Draco, frantically undoing their pants and yanking at the fabric.
“No.”
"I'm not sure I know what you mean," Potter answered coolly, eyes narrowing.
Teddy’s head shoots, eyes huge. “Home?”
"As accurate a summation as that is," she said, fixing him with a stern look, "I was more meaning your maturity in regards to Mr. Malfoy."
How to answer? While it wouldn’t be lying to say that they definitely haven’t tried to kill one another, it would definitely be foolishly bold to say they were practically friends, something that would likely make the Care-Seekers leap with joy. Yet, as Draco runs his fingers through Teddy’s hair once, thinking on the past couple months, he realizes that maybe there won’t have to be as much lying as he anticipated.
She peeks at the notes Mr. Cook is perusing, nodding at something there. “Well, the flat is in excellent shape, and the location is perfect for wanting to be outdoors with a magical child. Lots of space buffer you have out there. When is your lease up, Mr. Malfoy?”
Harry's heart hurt at the self-loathing in Draco's voice. He pulled back to look Draco in the eye, wanting to make sure he did this right. Tears still covered Draco's cheeks, and Harry brought his hands up to cup Draco's face, his thumbs swiping across the skin there to wipe away the tears.
*I want to say this first: I don't believe in spanking. I was spanked as a kid and sure, I turned out fine or whatever, but times change and my husband and I have found success in other methods so far and don't do it. But the Harry Potter world's characters were children in the 80s and 90s and it was more common then. Please don't attack me for it being mentioned in here
Slughorn grinned. "You see, I'm glad you asked that, Miss Granger, as it leads into the twist for today's lesson!"
"It smells amazing, Mum."
It came somewhat late in the evening, just as Draco was closing up his shift at the apothecary. Ministry owls have always been obvious, being so well cared for, so efficient, so direct. Unsure what the Ministry could have possibly wanted from him, it was with great unease that Draco initially untied the scroll from the barn owl’s leg.
“And you mentioned that he’s sleeping better?”
“What are you doing, Potter?”
away from me!”
"Is there any logic to what keeps them happy?" Harry asked. He was looking across the greenhouse at Weasley and Granger, who were having a whispered conversation across their own, rather content, Clamor Beta.
“What’s this about? I...I hadn’t heard of this department before today.”
Teddy immediately falls back on his heels, clapping with delight. “Again, again!”
“Yeah, he goes back to sleep fairly fast when he does wake now, so it’s more-”
Potter scoffs, just lightly enough to be ignored as a breath.
A rather knowing smile twists Ms. Dribble’s thin lips. “As, ah...chivalrous as that may be, Mr. Malfoy, I must stand firm. These cases are never easy, and there is always more than one person that feels to be on the losing end in the beginning. But keep in mind that Mr. Potter and Teddy will be checked on periodically. Should Jameson or I catch any whiff of unsuitability, there will be interventions.”
And to think he wanted this.
The world spun very slowly as Draco became more aware of the bed and the blankets that wrapped around him, and it was then that he realized his robes had been removed. He laid there in what felt like pajamas of some sort, which was a little odd. He must have been overwhelmed enough to think that he'd sleep long enough to warrant a full change of clothes.
“Oh, ‘arry, you worry too much,” she says, flipping her hair slightly. “Leetle Teddy was fine, as ‘e was all week. Now, ‘aven’t you an appointment zis afternoon?”
For perhaps the fourth time in all Draco’s time knowing him, Teddy obeys the first time. He skips into the room, favorite stuffed elephant in hand, and directly up to Draco, smiling all the way. “Hi, Daco.”
Potter looks exhausted. Deep, dark bags hang under dull, glazed eyes. His lips are unreasonably chapped, his hair has a greasy sheen to it, and Potter’s clothes are so wrinkled that Draco’s tempted to ask if he purposely wears them that way.
“Teddy?”
Draco inched around her. "I can't take the risk of that not being true."
"But how the hell would being with me put his mum in danger?" Harry grumbled, stabbing at the stems with a renewed venom.
Carraway.
Hand tight on his letter, Draco made his way carefully to the Slytherin common room.
Draco suppresses a chuckle.
But just below Malfoy’s eyes is the back of Teddy’s head, a mop of hair that has returned to its original color. Resolve grows in Harry from the sight, and he nods. He doesn’t have to fall into the abyss. He can climb, levitate, ease into it.
That has a nice ring to it.
"Oh, Mr. Potter, what excellent timing!" Madam Pomfrey cooed. "Come in, come in, I just about to discharge Mr. Malfoy here. I'd like you to see him to his common room, please."
"Here," Potter said when they were dressed, offering Draco the cloak. He pulled it over his head and was surprised at the clarity of vision through the fabric. "Just...stick close to me."
"What's wrong?" Potter asked. "You're...you're not breathing right."
"You must be missing Draco as much as he's missing you. You both look downright awful these days."
“Maybe because you were a Death Eater at the time?”
"By kindly requesting you a private meal so you could actually eat something."
“Well, Jameson, the flat’s not in ruins.”
Potter cleared his throat. "They've gone now, but it used to happen a lot. Hermione noticed and said they're called panic attacks. She'd have to explain what they are exactly, but she...she gave me some tips to help...move them along." He swallowed. "I...er...did it help?"
The baby giggled and tried to take a step toward Draco, but Teddy's feet didn't plant correctly and he slumped onto his bottom with a soft thump. Teddy just giggled again, grabbing at his toes.
Suppressing a groan, Harry threw on his robes and splashed some water on his face before making his way toward the dungeons. He had missed breakfast, but he hadn't eaten breakfast in so long that it hardly mattered. He was cutting it close enough to the start of the lesson already, but he was sure he wouldn't be late today.
Fire Whiskey literally burned with every swallow, but the pain was something beautiful to Harry. It made him feel, as cliche as he knew that sounded. He snorted into his half-empty glass. He really was being quite pathetic.
"You don't
"Because it's cold as hell."
Whispering, Teddy asks, “Why?”
"Ah."
His mother could have seen Harry holding Draco's hand as they entered the house; instead, she had her head turned and missed it.
With an understanding grin, Chase says, “My business if entirely with you, Draco. The only thing that would make me even think of interfering with Teddy’s situation is if you gave me reason to believe he were in danger. And I can assure you that having a tight budget in this economy is no cause for alarm.”
“Come on, it was for a few hours. It doesn’t matter.”
It was so much more pleasurable than when Pansy had more or less drooled into his mouth. Harry's tongue glided gently across Draco's as though asking permission to continue, and it didn't take long for Draco to catch on and begin a desperate battle for dominance. Draco breathed in through his nose deeply, breathing every bit of Harry he could, his heart aching for it.
Hermione just looked at him.
Even the tosser who killed Voldemort had to pass the prerequisites.”
"I was going to wait for you to come out on your own," she said, shooting him a glare. "But you were taking forever. I have a letter for you."
"That's creepy."
It only took about ten stairs before Harry tripped on his cloak.
"It goes on inside for nearly a full page," Hermione continued crossly. "It talks about how there's no possible way you two could be friends on your own and how the only explanation is that Draco's using Dark Magic to 'bewitch' you, a term that was squashed out nearly a century ago for being too offensive."
"And begin!"
"You want to hear the weirdest thing I've ever been called?" he asked.
Potter’s mouth opens and closes a couple of times. Draco can practically hear the rusty gears turning at half speed.
“The point I’m making, Harry,” Mr. Cook sighs, “is that you are only halfway through the extensive and strenuous program. You are more often at the Ministry than at home right now, and when you are home you are likely exhausted. This will only make caring for a child that much more challenging.”
Harry groaned and pulled back. "How the devil are your robes tied on you?"
Harry sat down across from Ron. "It looks delicious, Mrs. Weasley."
Hours later, Harry is hardly actually reading his textbook. He’s too busy checking the time.
“‘m touched, P-P-P-arry.” Draco giggles. “Worry ‘bout me of’en?”
So much could have gone wrong. But rather than the bad Malfoy luck as of late, Draco had the best Christmas he'd had in years. He smiled foolishly to himself as he tossed beneath the cover, tangling himself against the cold that never seemed to seep from the manor. And Harry had told him, for a third time, that he loved him as they had said their goodbyes outside Andromeda's door. The women had been busied with making their own plans for the new year, and Harry had leaned into Draco's side and whispered it in his ear.
"You alright today?" Harry asked quietly as the other students began talking and moving.
Draco always knew Potter had no class. But the towering buildings cluttered together barely a kilometer from the Ministry’s main entrance...Draco scrunches his nose at the fading red brick and stained concrete before him. A building marked with a cracked sign that reads ‘COMPLEX E’ is in front of him. Draco takes to the wide stairs, sincerely concerned at the lack of handrails.
They’re drifting into an argument. Harry can feel it as surely as he can feel Teddy’s eyes on him. There’s a lot of appeal in pressing forward in the nettling at Draco. It’s almost habitual, and yet Harry just shrugs as he takes another bite, tosses aside his ready-made, snarky remark that easily would have thrown them both into a spiral of bickering for the evening.
He knows
“Evening.”
It was a fascinating dream, Draco thought as the breeze stilled around him. Somewhere, a clock struck four in the morning, but he didn't move.
“That’s just because you’re not the one up on display,” Harry mutters.
Draco growls, bumping into Harry for the fifth time in ten minutes. “You’re not helping, so just sit down.”
He had a crush on Malfoy.
“No, you selfish prick, I said Monday.”
With a groan and a savage stab at his own food, Harry snaps, “You’re not leaving the table until you eat.”
"What?" Harry asked, defensive.
“Well,” Malfoy says presently, pulling Harry from his thoughts, “go on, get out of here. I’ll see you Monday, Teddy.”
Banging filled the bathroom suddenly. Draco leapt back from the sink, looking around.
when that moment comes. Thankfully, the flat is smoke-free an entire thirty seconds before Draco Apparates into the living room.
"Well, I hardly think-"
“You want me to prove just how inaccurate that is, Potter? Or can your overly-inflated ego handle it?”
Draco tried to keep the foolish smile off his face as he entered the Great Hall. But upon entering, he felt it melt away on its own as dozens of heads whipped around to stare. Furious whispering broke out as Draco made his way to the Slytherin table. Nothing necessarily new, but there was a certain feeling of escalation in the glares and whispers. The renewed anger there was remarkably off-putting.
Malfoy shrugged again, less wary and more understanding. "Sometimes...sometimes people just can't let go."
The following morning, after a sleepless night tossing and turning in his bed, Harry was determined to make Draco talk to him in Potions. They were partners. He had to talk to Harry.
She sighed, fixing him with a pitying look. "It's hard to truly blame Josh for his prejudices, Harry. His actions were absolutely revolting, but the reasoning behind them is easy to understand."
"Hey, Luna," he said as he drew nearer. "How are you?"
"Still love you, you know," he had said with a smile.
"Why're your curtains so stiff?" Weasley asked. "I can't open them."
Draco’s face falls flat.
The silence that engulfs the living room is only second in volume to the moment after the Dark Lord’s final death. Draco stands there in the tension, distinctly unraveled. A beat passes before Potter’s wand officially drops completely. Draco is breathing heavy. All he can do is return the stare Potter is giving him, both of them blank and a little shell-shocked.
“What’re you doing here?”
A bit bewildered but pleased all the same, Harry twisted his finger, again hitting that spot deep inside Draco and eliciting another strangled cry of pleasure from his lover's lips. Draco's cock in Harry's hand twitched, and Harry decided to take things a step further.
"What?"
"I'd kick him and tell him to get up," Harry said without thinking. When Hermione just raised her brows at him for it, Harry groaned. "We are not having this conversation. I do not have a crush or whatever on Malfoy. I am not gay."
"Well, it wasn't as if I expected Malfoy to be parading around, calling us all mudbloods and blood traitors again. I mean, the Ministry obviously had their reasons for allowing him to return to Hogwarts-" Harry's chest tightened slightly and he looked away. "-but if what those sixth years said was all true, Malfoy's let himself be a punching bag all year. Doesn't lift a finger to defend himself, doesn't call out, doesn't tell the teachers, almost as if-"
“Now get outta my bar. I know you got an early day tomorrow.” Draco reaches for his pocket, but Tom waves a hand at him. “Nah, tonight’s on the house. Get out.”
"You don't have to worry, you know."
Teddy actively enjoying sprinting to the toilet in the mornings, Draco’s noticed how there aren’t any extra pants in the laundry, how the nappies haven’t dwindled any.
“Otay.”
For a moment, it appears as if Teddy understands. He nods, looking thoughtful, and Hermione sits back. Harry is about to do the same, relieved sigh readily inhaled, when it happens.
“Did you get out of bed to sleep with...Harry?”
“Oh my word, you are a lost cause.”
“Ni’ ni’, Daco.”
Days crept by where simply seeing Ginny had hurt him. Talking to her was a challenge Harry hadn't yet overcome. Something enormous had shifted between them. So much had changed. They had each lost so much, and Harry had his own inner demons that only multiplied in their year apart. Less than a week had passed when Harry knew that he no longer loved Ginny the way she loved him.
“It’s not my job to look soft, Mum.”
"Okay, so slicing him up for not answering you, that makes sense," Neville said, dark sarcasm in his voice.
Despite his untouched love for his mother, Draco still couldn't bring himself to face her for more than a few minutes at a time since they returned home and especially since his father's murder. Draco couldn't fake the sorrow that so gripped his mother, even for her. She didn't deserve to grieve alone, yet Draco couldn't provide that company for her. Even after all she had done for him. It tore at him every time he escaped her.
"I seriously doubt that."
Teddy nods his head against Draco’s chest. A minuscule amount of tension in Draco leaves him. He exhales, kisses at Teddy’s head, then offers the boy out to Potter.
“I dare say it’s cheaper.” Draco drinks his wine. It’s slithers down his throat, calming the Firewhiskey residue there. When he’s swallowed half his glass, Draco sets it back down. “I fear that this will be my forever. I can’t...I can’t be a miserable potions shop worker the rest of my life.”
"You telling me to be quiet?"
Maybe this could work out.
Being mature was way worse.
"Uh...well, actually," he began, turning to face her again and leaning back against the counter, "I have made some...unusual friends."
"Draco?"
It was Monday, and the seventh years were having an unusually lax Herbology lesson. The only objective for the hour was to keep the Clamor Betas, a rather angry shrub that growled loudly when left alone in their childhood, entertained. Professor Sprout's stock left the class breaking into pairs and spreading out around the greenhouse to try different methods of keeping the little shrubs happy. In the commotion that the grumpy Clamor Betas were causing, it made easy for private conversation.
"Oh...yeah. Saw him last night."
Fucking livid. But for reasons only a toddler could have, Teddy likes Potter. “Yes,” Draco says evenly. “But...but not anymore. Everything is fine now.”
"Well, that's it."
Something in Harry's eyes must have deterred whatever question Ron had been about to ask, for he simply shrugged and said, "Alright. See you, then."
"I saw the burns."
With a frustrated sigh, Draco collapses onto his large new sofa, easily twice the size of a typical loveseat, and breathes in its new-fabric smell. Nearly everything in Draco’s new flat smells new, with a hint of cardboard and paper and plastic. Quite different from the refreshing scents of polished familiarity of Malfoy Manor, hardly a scent at all.
Harry dropped his head onto the bar with a loud thud.
"Mmmm..." Malfoy didn't wake, but he shifted over to give Harry more room.
"Really? That's...that's good. How, uh, is she?" Draco knew little about his mother's sister that married a muggleborn. Little outside who all she had lost in the war, which was everyone - her husband, her daughter, her son-in-law...
"I wasn't aware that my choice of friends was up for debate."
Nothing happened.
"Ha ha. Very witty."
"But...why would anyone choose to have a baby that way?" Harry asked. "It sounds so complicated."
"H-Harry."
“Sure.”
"Malfoy?" he asked, doubtful. "Draco Malfoy, Death-Eater-at-sixteen Malfoy? Tried-to-kill-Dumbledore-himself Malfoy? 'Alright'?"
Feeling a bit embarrassed but determined all the same, Harry turned to ask Hermione her opinion.
"Here we are!" Andromeda relieved Teddy from Harry's arms, popping a bottle in the little mouth and silencing the screams. "Last bottle until I can get to the store, Teddy, so drink it up."
"Mmm?"
“Hey, Ted-”
He had intended to accept.
“Not like that,” Harry chuckles. “I meant...I don’t want us having a row twice a day being the only real example he has of how people treat each other. We ought to make more of an effort to be nice.”
Harry Potter loved him.
Harry looks up at Draco, finds him cleaning the carpet with his wand and muttering murderously under his breath. Not wanting to catch the bad end of
It was the longest two minutes Draco had endured in some time. No one spoke, Weasley's bewildered stare morphing into a confused glare that still jumped between Draco and Potter. Draco swallowed dryly and took a deep breath. He clasped his hands together to keep from shaking. When his inhales began to silently stutter, Draco felt a hand rest on his knee under the table.
Frowning, Draco looks back up, finds Potter determinedly not looking at him. Teddy glances between the two a few times. His eyes are still wide, lips still drawn tight. There’s tension all over his tiny body. Much as Draco wants to rush across the space and embrace Teddy with all he has, he stays still. He’s not about to force Teddy to do something that adds to his fright and upset.
Draco hadn't lifted his eyes from the table during the Sorting Ceremony. His left eye wanted to water, but no tears came. He figured that even his physical body knew that he deserved the black eye that was now forming. It wasn't as though the ambush on the train had been much of a surprise. The train had been particularly full, seeing as there was essentially an extra year's worth of students attending that year, leaving Draco with little choice but to find a compartment that already had people in it. He at least had chosen one filled with Slytherins. Pansy had been among them, and though Draco grimaced with embarrassment at the memory of their last time seeing one another, he had slithered into the seat beside her. Thankfully, she had said nothing to him, and Draco had harbored the hope that he could go the entire train ride ignored.
With a flick of his wand, Draco starts up the radio in the corner. A witch’s full-bodied voice filters into the flat, taking away the mounting of Draco’s anxieties but not the foundation. She sings over a bright melody that’s modern yet reserved, a mark of music created in the wake of the war; hopeful but still in mourning.
"It lasts all day?"
Harry glanced at his paper, pleased to see the red E circled across the top. At least he wouldn't have to worry about adding that to his pile of 'study more' concepts.
Despite the emotions it evoked and the memories it stirred, Harry had made the time to see Teddy Lupin no less than five times after the war and before returning to Hogwarts. A part of Harry had wanted to take the child and raise him on his own as Sirius had wanted to after Harry had been orphaned, but Hermione had reasonably reminded Harry that Andromeda was far more qualified for the job. It hadn't been what he wanted to hear, but it had been what was best for Teddy.
"I too can change!" Ron started heatedly.
“I know I’m the last person you wanted to be watching Teddy,” Malfoy begins. His voice is the calmest Harry has ever heard it, at least when directed at him. Not a trace of malice or arrogance. “But the fact is that we’re both here and we’re legally tied for Teddy’s sake...at least for the time being. But a lot happens in a year with children, and I don’t want- I don’t think it’s ideal for Teddy to think that how we treat each other is...is...”
But Draco’s face is twisted in a shock that looks strange, irritated. His nose is wrinkled at the bridge, lips curled, eyes wide though his brows are dipped severely. “Were you...were you starved as a child?”
Fleur purses her lips, although the energy is more exasperated than angry. “‘e found zis button on ze floor and tried to geeve it to Victoire. When I told ‘im ‘no,’ ‘e tried to z’row it at ‘er, and zen ‘e started ‘itting.”
Something flickers in Hermione’s eyes, something that reminds Harry of someone older, someone wiser than surely a twenty-year-old should be. She fixes Harry with a look that blazes though it’s soft, and she shrugs.
"Oh, sorry," he said as he inched around her. "Just a good night's rest is all."
The boy drew his wand, aiming it at Draco's face.
Harry brought a hand to his chest in mock-offense. "Hermione Granger, I have listened to every word you have ever said."
"Draco Malfoy, you stop right there."
He stopped by a passing window. Pinpricks in the sky flew over what Harry knew was the Quidditch pitch. Ron and Ginny were out there now, practicing with the rest of the Gryffindor team.
"Thank you, honey."
"Andromeda's quite lovely, and Teddy's just delightful. Hardly cries, it seems. You...you ought to meet him, you know. He is your second cousin."
Copper hit his tongue, and Draco realized that he had been biting his lip. The Lovegood girl gave him a final smile and walked back toward the staircase that led to the upper levels, leaving him alone and desperately confused.
It doesn’t even burn anymore.
“Again!”
"The worst bit is," Draco said quietly, "my mother doesn't even blame me for not being upset over his death. Somehow, that feels even more wrong than my not being sad."
Malfoy stood still, hand cradled in Harry's, as the blood was removed. The shaking didn't stop as Harry dropped Malfoy's left hand and moved onto the right one to continue Vanishing the blood. When he had cleared it all away, Harry didn't let go and kept his eyes trained on their hands.
“This is going to be a disaster.”
Draco swallowed, wishing they'd just get on with whatever they were going to do. But it seemed that Gryffindors liked to play with their food.
Harry didn't ask what he meant. "You sure? I...fuck-I don't-"
Harry nearly jumped out of his skin at Hermione's voice in his ear. The portrait hole closed, and Harry realized that he had nearly run smack into Hermione as she had made to enter the common room. She looked exhausted.
And so, after a rather subdued day with Teddy and practically bolting from Potter once he was back at the flat, Draco stormed into Healer Chase’s office and gave the fool exactly what he’s been begging for these past couple months. Spiraling into a human version of a shit-storm, Draco screamed and sobbed irately about his father’s death, his mother’s death, Andromeda’s death,
“I didn’t know you played the guitar,” Harry says.
Pulling his eyes away from the baby, Draco turned to face his aunt and tried to smile. Her voice didn't completely match her words, but Draco could only assume that as early as a few months ago, Andromeda hadn't cared or even known that he existed. He extended his hand.
Even Draco could hear the foolishness in his words, feel the obvious escape in them. But his mother tactfully smiled and nodded at him, giving his arm a gentle pat. "Good night, honey. I will see you when you are more awake."
Sighing dramatically, Draco obliged, leaving Harry to watch. He really was beautiful, Harry thought as Draco dressed. It was a shame that it would be a little less than two weeks before he could see him once the holidays started.
The voice sounded familiar, but he couldn't quite place it. It sounded terribly far away, yet as though filtering into his consciousness directly at his ear at the same time.
The letter didn't do Draco's torrent of emotion any justice, but he didn't want to waste anymore time than he already had by not reaching out to her the moment he had seen the article more than a week previous. Rolling the parchment as he ran, Draco hurried to the Owlery.
“Tire.”
at him? It’s a very long silence otherwise, and Draco just drifts in the abyss of how his body is moving though he’s laid out on his bed, sure he’s about to really fall asleep. The nothingness sounds nice.
Easily the first to arrive in the dungeons, Harry slammed his bag onto his desk and threw himself into the chair, breathing hard.
Fire Whiskey made the drinker honest, and Harry found himself mumbling, "I should just be expelled. I've caused enough trouble at Hogwarts to last a century, at least. I don't know why Dumbledore didn't do away with me in my first year. Wait," Harry rubbed at his eyes. "No, I know why. Needed me, didn't he?"
“It’s absolute horse shit,” Draco mutters at the countertop.
But it wasn't the response Josh apparently wanted, and his nostrils flared as his eyes grew murderous. He thrust his wand directly in Draco's face.
"Well, let's eat, shall we?" Mr. Weasley said. "Everything looks delicious, Molly, and I have no doubt that it tastes just as superb."
Trying to sound casual, Harry finds himself saying, “Of course. Whatever’s best for Teddy. When shall we do this?”
All stirring ceased at Slughorn's words, and he grinned.
Draco's stomach churned at the word printed there, set directly above an enlarged photo. It was initially hard to make out, as it was obviously taken from quite a distance, but the photo was of Draco and Harry, hand in hand, walking through the snow and wind toward a tiny store. Both were smiling and laughing together, entering the store only to return with bags full of what Draco knew to be baby formula.
Pushing his lips together, Draco’s mind whirlwinds, updrafts collecting and racing his thoughts. If he’s not under any sort of restraints as far as the law is concerned, then-
“Any concerns there?”
“Okay, let’s...where did you put it?” Harry asks, already finding his feet. He’s not really expecting an answer from Teddy. Giving the room a quick scan, he doesn’t immediately see the dull blue blanket that Teddy’s taken a strong liking to in the past month. “I don’t think we even went to the bedroom since we’ve been home, so if...oh no.”
The Cruciatus Curse didn’t hurt as much as this.
"Yeah, she is."
Nothing more in his way, Harry slipped his hand completely under the thin fabric that separated him from Draco and quickly wrapped his hand firmly around the stiff cock within.
Malfoy was easily taking up most of the bed, leaving Harry to perch awkwardly on the very edge. It was incredibly uncomfortable. Harry only lasted a minute before he nudged Malfoy's side.
Draco broke the kiss first, pulling back just an inch to whisper, "I love you."
Harry didn't believe him, but at that time, Professor Slughorn approached their desk with a wide grin.
He hadn't felt much more panic since his last attack. The attack that Harry had come to help him.
An enormous surge of affection for Hermione rushed over Harry, and he let his shoulders relax as they walked. He wondered if and hoped that Draco was still beside them.
"Harry, dear!" Andromeda cried, flinging open the kitchen door and sweeping into the room. She stooped over and wrapped Harry and Teddy into a tight hug, kissing each of Harry's cheeks. "You're a bit early! Wasn't expecting you for another hour, at least!"
Harry frowned. "What do you mean?"
“I agree. I’m willing to make it work if you are.” Malfoy’s eyes lift from the stones at their feet, eyes meeting Harry’s. Fierce but tired, the surrounding skin wrinkled from worries unknown, those pale eyes bear into Harry with a vague challenge, a hint of a plea. Harry feels as though on the edge of an impossibly high ledge, very close to free-falling into the abyss.
An irate sort of energy is bubbling in the acids of Harry’s stomach as he watches Draco disappear into his bedroom, turning into fumes that he pushes through his nose. His mind is racing, chasing thoughts and plans and ideas and schemes, every possible avenue he could take in order to shove Draco’s stupid toilet training obsession up his nose. Harry glances at Teddy when he hears a little giggle, watches as Teddy flips through a picture book on the floor for a few moments.
Luna looked up then and caught Harry staring.
And while it isn’t the most genuine birthday wish Harry has ever received, as he sneaks glances at Teddy, contentedly slurping at his yogurt without a worry in the world, and Draco, who seems to be sitting a little less rigidly, Harry thinks that it’s not the most unpleasant one, at least.
Gliding like a fairy herself, Luna wandered away, leaving Harry alone with Malfoy.
“Why’d you even buy him a muggle book in the first place?” Draco asks. He grits his teeth just so, just enough to keep any real accusation from his voice.
"Ohhh no," Harry muttered, bringing the wrists together and holding them fast with only one of his hands. It was lucky in that sense that Draco was so thin. "Your turn."
"Don't...don't listen to what anyone says." Harry's voice was soft and, though Draco tried not to hear it, sad. "Don't worry about them. These kinds of articles come up and they're complete rubbish. It blows over. Don't let it-"
“Oh, fuck off,” Harry growls as he flops back onto the crouch. “Your parents probably treated you the same way you’re trying to treat Teddy and you can’t see why it’s so completely fucked up.”
"It's in your and Harry's best interests."
"Right," Potter said weakly. "Right. Well...I'll...I'll meet you and Hermione there, okay?"
Taking the vial from Hermione's hand, Harry stepped up to the desk with her as she found a ladle within the desk. She carefully dropped it into the very center of the cauldron, poking through the thickening gray liquid inside, then began to stir anti-clockwise while counting out loud.
I had to update my tags! I was skimming through this chapter as I've been doing to make sure the formatting is transferring correctly and realized that this chapter contains a particularly dark moment that could be disturbing for some. Should suicidal thoughts trigger you, please stop reading when the chapter switches to Draco's POV, and you can resume toward the bottom third where I've bolded the word SEVERAL. I'm sorry for any inconvenience to readers that were not wanting or expecting to read a story with such material. After this chapter, however, there is nothing else as graphic in that way.
Harry didn't have a response to that.
Malfoy nods. “Or even right. I’ve...” He smiles wryly. “I’ve come to realize this past year and a half just the kind of long-term impacts childhood experience can have on adult choices. I don’t want the negative of that for Teddy.”
Ron shrugged, but Hermione smiled knowingly at Harry before slipping her hand into Ron's and allowing herself to be led away. Shoving his hands deeper into his pockets, Harry made his way over to the bookshop.
“I yike the couch,” Teddy says, patting at the cushions fondly.
"Why'd you tell Luna to follow me?"
The constant sneer that seems to linger perpetually in those overcast eyes fades at the question. Malfoy nods. “I do believe we are, if you are as committed as you claim.”
The dungeon classroom was soon filled with the hissing of several potions brewing with the misty fog to match. Harry and Malfoy's own potion didn't seem to be doing a lot of steaming, but it had turned the deep blue that the recipe described as the near-end point as the clocked ticked closer to the bell. When a particularly loud bubbling erupted from the Ravenclaw table, Harry leaned in closer to Malfoy, who was carefully stirring.
This is going to be a lot harder than he thought.
It had been the first Saturday of term, and Ginny had finally caught Harry alone. He had been waiting under a large tree on the grounds for Ron and Hermione to return from retrieving Ron's bag in the common room so that the three of them could begin their Transfiguration homework. Harry had been going through his notes, wanting to impress Hermione by starting without her, when he heard a nearby door slam.
"It's not just me." Malfoy's eyes lost their angry edge the moment the words left his mouth, which stayed open slightly as though forgotten in his confusion. He took a small step back, looking vaguely alarmed.
“Is...”
Harry Potter loved him, and he wasn't giving up on Draco.
"So, what's happened?" Hermione asked. "Not like what happened before, right? I mean, he hasn't been hurt, has he?"
uncharacteristic, the understanding in Draco’s voice. “I have to think that raising a magical child in the heart of a predominately muggle city is probably just challenging. Was the other child hurt badly?”
Hermione sighed. "Yes, then, I suppose technically. I'm just saying that...I don't think this has as much to do with you as you think."
Harry wasn't melodramatic enough to say that it had been the worst day of his life after Draco left him in the greenhouse, but Harry was melodramatic enough to try and chase after him.
Harry slid his hands into Draco's robes, pulling at the undershirt that was tucked into the pants below.
Harry's head slammed into the wood of the door, sending parks throughout his vision, though he had trouble caring. His lips were frantic and wet, eagerly kissing Draco's as he was pressed bodily into the door. Draco's hands were in his hair, on his neck, grabbing at his dress robes, never staying in one place long while Harry's were firmly wrapped in the dress robes at Draco's waist. Their tongues fought within their sealed lips and their hearts raced together.
"The lesson-"
"Remember to hold it a bit after you breathe in," Harry murmured.
“That’s what I’m getting at!”
More psychotherapy nonsense, Harry thinks. “Maybe it’s just best to let Teddy be a kid,” he retorts.
They were both still wearing their mittens, but a pleasant warmth still flowed through Harry at the contact. "Relax, I was only messing around. It's your first time here, then? Looking for something specific?"
“Just give it a rest, then,” Harry says, chuckling at the completely deranged look in Draco’s eyes. “It’s only been a couple days. Maybe he’s just not ready.”
"Wh-what?" he sputtered.
“What?” Draco asks, bewildered. “What in Merlin’s name has you so worried?”
“I look forward to seeing Teddy Monday, then.” He Conjures a slip of paper, his new flat’s address, and sends it floating through the space between them. “A little before eight?”
"No. He's been avoiding me."
"Hush up, hush up!" Professor Sprout called as she slammed the door shut behind her. "It's the new year, and your N.E.W.T.s are coming up in a few months! It's time we did some reviewing of the past six years, hm? We'll be spending only a week or two covering the basics of what we've handled thus far, so strap in! For now, find a seat and pull out a quill and parchment. I haven't a board in here, so you better write fast!"
"Come along, Potter."
“Yeah, Teddy, I think your blanket got left at Malfoy’s.”
“-and a little out of nowhere, but I do believe it worth considering. Truth be told, there are likely other complexes out there, maybe a full house you could buy, and the Care-Seekers will still find you to be suitable.”
Mr. Cook steps forward, crouches to Teddy’s level. “How have you been?”
Fingers tangled in Draco's hair and threw him face first into the stone floor.
A laugh bubbled up from Harry's chest, crinkling the skin around those gorgeous eyes. "Much as I agree, I'd rather hear it from you when we're both sober."
Professor McGonagall's brows shot to her hairline. Harry wondered if he had said something offensive but found that he couldn't remember.
Harry clenches harder, clenches everywhere, seeking some sort of miracle in self-control as he takes a deep breath through his teeth.
"Mmm," Harry hummed, trying to keep his eyes open. He thought they might be in the corridor that held the Fat Lady. Sweet bed, so close.
“See,” Harry says after the first bite, “they’re amazing. All your whining was pointless, and I mean that as a compliment. I think.”
This was the first fic that I ever turned into a complete story, as well as the first fic I ever posted back in early 2017 on another site, so Deserved sits very close to my heart. I've always had folders and folders of half-baked ideas and cobbled-together scenes that never quite lined up right, but something about this idea sparked that writer's craze and I wrote the whole thing over the course of a week. I haven't looked at it since I posted it, and because I'm lazy, I'm just copying and pasting it instead of continuing to proof-read. So any mistakes are a few years old and I am sorry you have to look at them :| Try to enjoy otherwise :)
Mr. Cook looks up in surprise as Mr. Dribble makes her way to stand beside him. “Finished already? You usually take a touch longer.”
That brought out a smile. Harry's chest flared. Victory.
A hand crept under Draco's shirt at his waist, trailing up his side and onto his chest. Harry's fingers were like lightning on Draco's skin. He quickly found his way under Harry's shirt, grabbing at the skin of his back and pulling him closer. But Harry pulled his body away slightly, causing a whimper at Draco's mouth, though when Harry's hand on his chest began to trickle down his front, deep satisfaction mixed with anticipation overtook Draco's disappointment. Harry's finger tickled the skin below Draco's belly button, then cautiously hooked into the waistband of Draco's pants.
"I, uh...used a minor cutting spell on his face and front...just...just to make sure he was listening. He wasn't saying anything."
“I guess. Give me a minute...” And with Teddy under his arm like a rolled up carpet, Harry slips into the nearby bedroom. He plops Teddy onto the bed and crouches in front of him. “Teddy, what in the world is going on with you? You never hit!”
Harry had been so absorbed in what his hands were doing that Draco's tongue caught him off guard. The hand on and in Draco's arse twitched slightly, crooking his finger and bumping against something deep within that had Draco yelping into his mouth.
“I see.” Ms. Dribble smiles then, though Harry feels it’s somehow a touch threatening. He attempts to return the gesture but mostly just purses his lips nervously. Not quite how he wants to give his farewell.
"Are you gay?"
“I am! And I heard you have a rough day-” Teddy nods vigorously. “-so what do you say you and I go to the park?”
Did Potter just
Several people shouted out, all of their words lost in the chaos.
"Shut up."
"I...er...I just..." Potter licked his lips, looking toward the curtain. "I just wanted some privacy."
"I..." Draco swallowed again. "I asked Mr. and Mrs. Weasley for their blessing before I even bought the ring. I...I wanted to make sure it was okay before I...before I asked you to marry me."
“Huh?”
Harry’s brows rise as Planters speaks, surprised. The Ministry has always taken ages doing anything it already knows how to do. To set in motion a brand new program on the scale that it must have to be for refurbishing Azkaban with specially-trained guards...Harry would have expected another year or more before hearing of any substantial change.
Hermione gave a self-satisfied smirk. "Oh, yes. I think they overheard my name through Rita Skeeter, though it didn't work out the way she had probably thought it would. Instead, I helped write some of the new rules for publishing there and helped draft a few laws that will hopefully be in effect in the next few months about honesty in the press."
Teddy’s door opens a few seconds later. Harry sits up in mild surprise as Malfoy carefully pulls the door shut behind him.
"What happened to his
"Here we are," Malfoy said, dropping the book back onto the desk. He bent over, searching the text for something. "Catalysts are right here."
"I, uhm...I was just looking," Draco said breathlessly, looking at the table.
With a final slide down the length of Harry's cock, Draco pulled back with a quiet pop and looked up at Harry from his knees. That sight alone could do Harry in, and he was sure Draco and his sly smirk knew it.
Malfoy ends the moment of suspension. “I wasn’t going to mention it. I thought you would use it against me to take Teddy away for good.”
"Right...I was just trying to make conversation."
!" Harry heard her call, and his heart sank.
And without a glance back in Harry’s direction, Malfoy- no,
"Well, even so."
Had she? Draco didn't remember hearing her. Maybe he was hungrier than he thought.
“None,” Draco snickers.
"Draco, stop reading that rubbish," Harry whispered. He wasn't taking any better notes than Draco was, though he had gone as far as to pull out the right materials. "It's just a bunch of gossip. Nothing to worry over."
is, Harry knows it’s Hermione that has a more solid head on her shoulders. After nearly a decade of being in constant awe of her, he’s learned to take her seriously when she gets so riled up about a suggestion. Whenever Hermione has what is seen as a crazy idea, there’s a very good chance that it’s actually the right course of action.
Harry crashed his lips onto Draco's, kicking the pants pooled at his feet and his shoes off as he forced Draco against the wall behind him. He nibbled at Draco's lips, drawing out a whimper.
"Of course," Karen said proudly. "Someone has to make sure you eat!"
"You really have to stop trying to save everyone, Potter."
Andromeda answered. It was rather shocking just how much she really looked like Bellatrix, though Draco could tell that her features were softer, her body less sharp and angular, eyes kinder under lighter hair. She opened the door and smiled a thin smile at them both, eyes drifting between them as she stepped to the side to let them indoors.
At that, Draco laughed. The beautiful, uninhibited contentedness within it yanked at Harry's chest, and he dove in to capture Draco's lips once more.
Teddy doesn’t say anything, and after a few moments go by, Draco wonders if perhaps the two have fallen asleep. He’s turning toward his bed when he hears Teddy’s whisper.
“About as well as expected,” Draco answers smoothly. “There have been a few bumps, mostly in the beginning. But now that we’ve all settled on a routine that works, life has been fairly bland, to be honest.”
"Looking for anything in particular?"
“Daco!”
The air was ripped from Harry's chest.
They dressed in silence after Potter unFroze the curtains, hardly looking at one another. Draco felt distinctly disheveled as he put on the same clothes he wore the day before, but oddly enough, he felt very...rested. More rested than he had in ages. Months, at the very least, maybe even years. It was as though in one night, the exhaustion that Draco had just considered part of his personality at that point had been cut in half.
The name sounded strange on his tongue but Draco fought not to let it show.
"Oi, took you two long enough!"
Even the furniture was cozy. Slightly oversized and mismatched, the browns and reds and oranges gave the living room an aching warmth that was only increased by the slew of baby toys and contraptions that littered the area rug. Amidst the homey chaos, almost hidden among the brightly colored toys, was a baby.
Harry rolled his eyes. "Whatever. I bet you'll be bugging me in the afterlife, too."
Draco had intended to accept Dumbledore's offer, make that decision for his family, keep them safe from the evil that resided in their own home. But Draco had hesitated, and those precious seconds had cost Dumbledore his life and Draco the last shreds of his innocence.
Not under these circumstances, but Draco was wanting to move out and on his own. He wanted his own flat, his own space, find his own new way in the revitalized world. But when his father was incarcerated, it felt harsh to leave his mother alone in the manor; and when his father was killed in Azkaban, the dream seemed to flatten into nonexistence in a blink. It wasn’t long after, however, that Draco’s mother and Andromeda rekindled what was left of their slaughtered relationship in shared grief, in deep-seeded hopes for making things right. Although Draco felt it was a touch forced, Andromeda and Teddy revived some of his selfish desire to finally venture out on his own. His mother would have company without ever having to leave the manor she loved so very much.
"But you saw him last night?" Hermione persisted.
"Only my second," Hermione said, unfazed. "But I'm wanting to make sure I'm prepared for my first Arithmancy lesson tomorrow. There are a few concepts I'd like to ask Professor Vector about once we've begun."
A small smile tugged at his lips.
They ate quietly for a few minutes before Draco asked, "So...how have you been? What have you been doing all this time? Your letters didn't really say."
“It’s in the boy’s best interest; a little more than a solid year of such consistency with two people he knows and trusts.”
There is a very suspended several seconds once Potter shifts Teddy more comfortably onto his hip. Teddy curls into the contact deeper, and Potter’s eyes linger on Draco for far too long. It’s when Potter opens his mouth as if to say something that Draco decides it’s gone on long enough. He turns on his heel and strides into his kitchen with purpose, leaving Potter to Disapparate away with Teddy alone.
Harry and Draco both snapped their heads round to Mrs. Weasley. Harry's heart skipped a beat. Surely she hadn't just said that in front of Draco.
"Alright, everyone have their new partners?" Slughorn asked. The class murmured, assenting, and he pressed on. "Excellent! Now, we finished up the differences between categories of brews before the holiday, yes? Yes, I think we rather did alright there. Only one or two didn't make an O on that final assessment before the break. I think you all caught on quite well.
Teddy nods. “Lank.”
Huffing, Teddy swings a kick at the tub’s basin, falls to his bottom, and then officially dissolves into furious tears. He throws his entire body to the floor and rolls with all his limbs flailing, mouth open wide to continue screaming in the tiny bathroom.
"My, you're cranky."
“No.”
It was slow. It started with tripping over scattered toys throughout the manor and irritably returning them to the boy or Andromeda, with listening to the wails from his bedroom after Teddy took his first spill down the staircase, with annoyance at the disruption to the quiet sort of dismal existence Draco was expecting after the war. And from it, from the ashes of utter and all-encompassing self-loathing and crippling, raging nothingness, Draco found himself watching Teddy. From open doorways, from corners of various rooms, across the table at meals his mother forced him to attend, Draco found himself watching Teddy as he stumbled about the manor, giddily adventurous and loud; so different from the child his mother had said Draco once was. Teddy took on the world as if there were no risks, trust shimmering in the depths of oversized eyes that changed color with the boy's mood. Andromeda never shouted at Teddy, something that baffled Draco at first. She could be sharp, absolutely firm, and strict, but typically Teddy was regarded with gentle love, playful guidance.
Draco narrowed his eyes. "Are you just seeking my friendship because he told you not to?"
They returned the cauldron to its position along the classroom's edge and quickly left, careful to lock the door behind them.
Draco smiles, turns to find Teddy’s hair a wild mess and his pajamas twisted, rubbing at his eyes in the kitchen doorway.
“Er...” Harry looks to Hermione for help. She runs an anxious hand through her hair once, then leans down as well.
Laughing, Harry moves towards Ron’s old bedroom window, looking down on the garden, where Ron and Hermione’s wedding will be taking place in less than an hour. It’s almost identical to Bill and Fleur’s decor, at least from what Harry can remember, except that Hermione specifically requested the event be free of canopies. Something about wanting to see the setting sunlight, the summer stars.
"I'm sure you don't sometimes," she said mildly. "But I hope you're not worried about being entertaining on my account. We needn't even talk if you'd prefer. I'd just like some company, Harry's request or not."
Harry laughed, allowing Draco to pull him by the arm onto his feet. "I bet I can get half our year to attest to the fact that you did, in fact, swagger."
Taking the bag to sling over his shoulder, Potter snickers.
Malfoy's grin fell. "I don't need to be a bother and drink away her stores. I'm doing alright."
“Wanna stay!”
Wiping the coffee from his lip, Draco struggled to find his voice. "What do you mean, Potter asked you to keep an eye on me?"
," Ginny hissed. But before Harry could retort, she had turned and stormed off.
Harry’s eyes fly open. Teddy is passed out on his chest. The clock above the balcony doors reads 5:02.
“Things are just going to take some getting used to. Potter and I aren’t used to being around each other all the time yet and we...we...”
"I just..." Harry hiccuped. "I just was finally happy again. I...I wasn't ready to let it go."
Harry’s grin is smug enough to kill. “Not a single one.”
Potter's jaw clenched as his cheeks flushed. "You're talking about Luna? Without asking Luna to keep an eye on you, you probably would have been attacked more than you already have!"
“Isn’t Teddy a bit young to toilet train?”
"N-no!" Harry half-shouted, mortified. How had the conversation ended up here so quickly? "No, I'm not...I'm not having sex with Malfoy! Just because you and Ron-"
“Your...?” Harry’s brows draw together. It’s another aspect he wasn’t quite prepared for when taking in Teddy, the constant translating from toddler gibberish to actual English. “You lank? Your...your la- blanket?”
wet yourself?”
"Huh?"
Finally reaching the top of the tower, Harry stepped around the small bend that opened to the whole surface. Sure enough, Malfoy was there, staring out over the grounds, sitting on the ledge.
"Oftentimes, Mr. Potter, people forget themselves when they believe their loved ones are in danger," she said gently. "I can think of a few times when you acted rashly, thinking someone you loved was in trouble."
“Yeah, she watched him every day but Thursday because she had an appointment with her healer about the baby. So my friend’s mom, Mrs. Wea- er, I mean, Molly Weasley, watched him that day.”
Draco's legs dangled off the Astronomy Tower. He had remembered his cloak this time, something he had been apt to forget as sleep deprivation crushed his brain. The winds were still harsh. Draco was still cold.
The Astronomy Tower was the spot where things were going to change no matter what for Draco, but he mostly dwelled on the fact that it was the spot where things could have changed for the better. He had been supposed to kill the famed Albus Dumbledore. A frightened sixteen-year-old boy with nothing more than a quivering wand had been expected to murder the greatest wizard of their time in cold blood. Draco had been mostly ready to do it, too. He had spent the better part of a full year resigning himself to his task, sick at the very thought despite his outward cavalier attitude for others to see.
The Hogwarts Express had been a downright nightmare. An all-day, high-energy, inescapable nightmare. At first, Harry and Ron had been able to find a compartment with Hermione without incident. Neville, Dean, and Seamus had joined them shortly after the train left the station, which was a pleasant surprise. But past that...Harry shuddered, causing Hermione to raise her eyebrows at him from across the carriage.
Facing away from Malfoy, Harry can’t be too sure how his comment is received in the quiet that follows. He isn’t even sure if he cares. Even when Malfoy’s bedroom door latches a minute later, Harry can only care to try and settle himself. What is Malfoy’s
Harry laughed, turning to gaze at the man beside him. It was breathtaking, how beautiful Draco was.
Draco, who had been staring at the floor, world mildly spinning, snapped his eyes to hers. "What?"
Harry rolled his eyes at Draco's confusion. "I've gone through a lot of crap, most of it ruining my reputation. Didn't particularly care then, and I certainly don't give a damn now." He quirked his brow and grinned. "I killed Voldemort, remember? I think I'm entitled to be friends with whomever I'd like."
"You should have let me!"
Mr. Weasley shrugged. "I suppose we're all just doing the best we can. It's hard, to say the least. Weeding out the bad seeds from before the war has been the top priority, along with making sure that the new features of Azkaban are in order. To be honest, it's hard to admit how much we leaned on the dementors to handle the day ins and day outs of the prisoners."
The muscles in Draco's chest were far too tight. He couldn't move his chest enough to draw a full breath even if he hadn't already been struggling. Fear tickled at his consciousness, whispering in his ear that if he died right then and there, he'd be dying completely alone. No one would bat an eye at the sight. Many would probably cheer.
“I think Teddy is just stubborn-”
Definitely not. Draco closed his eyes briefly, pinching the bridge of his nose.
“Harry, I swear I will hex you into next week if you don’t
Damn, he’s missed this, Harry thinks as the time slips away. The simplicity of his friendship with Ron and Hermione hasn’t changed though they three have immensely. As it was with Ginny, things could have twisted in the aftermath of Voldemort’s defeat. Even something as common as being cut from the group after Ron and Hermione began dating could have ended everything, yet here they are. Having their friendship evolve from the innocence of being eleven and not quite knowing which Hogwarts steps to skip to the reluctant hardened heroes of their world, it means everything to Harry. It’s invaluable, what Ron and Hermione have always been, what they continue to be as life becomes more mundane; it’s laughably easy now. There aren’t any mysteries to solve, dark wizards to best, even classes to pass or homework to do, and yet they still work like the gears of a reliable clock, seamless, oiled, never-ending. Since having Teddy, Harry hasn’t spent as much time with Ron and Hermione as he would have liked, and as the afternoon teases into the evening, the comfort of their relationship warms him more than the alcohol.
Draco sighed, setting his quill down to rub at his temples. Karen had picked up on the changes in Draco's life, apparently, and had taken it upon herself to snap him back into what she had deemed his 'top form.' What it really was, though, was Karen catching Draco when he was trying to do his homework, this time in the library, and violently whispering at his elbow and keeping him from actually accomplishing anything.
Aberforth hadn't left his post in Hogsmeade after everything that had happened, something that had initially surprised Harry when he had found out. But it made sense, really. Aberforth was kind of a coward, and now that the danger was gone, he would have wanted to return to the familiarity of his dusty old bar and depressing flat so he could continue to mourn Arianna and hate Albus in peace.
Damn. Harry wants to smack himself, realizing just how scathing he became in a matter of seconds. Making sure his tone is in check first, he starts again. “Look-”
“Ready to go?” Potter asks Teddy.
her kindness.
He’s doing nothing but continuing the cycle with Teddy, he shouted at Chase after thirty straight minutes of raving like a lunatic. In the very heavy, very dense, very horrible pause following, Draco collapsed onto the sofa beneath the magical window, exhausted.
Grinning like idiots, Harry and Weasley stared at each other a moment before bursting into a fit of laughter. Weasley gave Harry a brotherly shove and straightened up, offering a hand out to Draco. Something about the gesture was immensely hilarious, and Draco cackled as he shook Weasley's hand.
"Did Josh say something to you?" Karen asked, her eyes following Draco's.
“Damn it, Potter, will you just-”
But as he entered the hall and Luna left him for the Ravenclaw table, Harry felt his chest constricting. All eyes had swiveled to him, adoring and awestruck, and several shouts of love and support washed over him like a bucket of frigid water. Harry struggled to breathe as he let Hermione grab his wrist and steer him over to the Gryffindor table, shoving him into a seat and dropping into the one next to him. Neville fell into the chair on his other side and offered an encouraging smile.
Hermione withdrew the ladle. Together, she and Harry watched the potion slow, returning to its gentle simmer within seconds.
Perhaps it was best that he hadn't said 'I love you' back.
He had stayed long enough. Draco made to leave again, but a warm hand grabbed his elbow, stopping him. The touch made him flinch, a recent corridor even playing all too vividly in his mind and making his shoulder throb.
"Look, if you knew anything about me, you wouldn't be sitting next to me, let alone talking to me."
Harry shot Ron a glare, who shrugged.
“He has to be hungry. There’s no way he just isn’t hungry after lunch every day. There’s no way. He’s going to starve.”
"Oh, my dear." Mrs. Weasley gave Ginny's cheek a swift peck before sitting down beside Ron.
“There you go, then!” Glancing at the clock above Draco’s head, Chase checks at his wristwatch. “That’s all our time for today, lucky for you. I will see you same time, same place, next week...”
"Still a git, mind you," Harry continued, and Draco saw a smile playing at his lips. "But definitely not evil. Besides, things were obviously different this year. Took barely a day to see that."
It’s a far cry from the spacious manor to which Teddy is accustomed.
A soft thud tickles at his eardrum, interrupts his drifting.
“Then you can sit here until you do, or until bath time.”
"Uh...this is the Slytherin table."
"It wasn't."
It was a damned dandelion.
“Daco to’d me!” Teddy shimmies, wanting down, then grabs Harry by the hand and starts pulling him toward the kitchen. “Make en’ca’cas!”
“Teddy, you do not spit on the table!” Draco says, voice slightly raised. “Use your napkin and clean that up.”
. You remember that? You came into my Dark Arts class. You were supposed to show us how, remember?"
He was sure that she was right, but it didn't stop Harry's heart from aching the rest of the lesson and it didn't stop him from immediately turning to go talk to Draco when the bell rang. He swung his bag over his shoulder and hurried over, but Draco caught his eye and ran before Harry could reach him. Harry made to follow, but Ron caught him by the bag.
Luna dropped beside Harry as one of the sixth years mumbled an answer. Her already wide eyes seemed to grow even wider upon seeing Malfoy's face.
"I basically did. You have to answer first."
Healer Chase was rather tactful, Draco thinks as he downs yet another Firewhiskey. Eyes focused more on his notes than Draco, Chase gave a rather neutral, calm address of the skeletonized basics of severe loss, varying degrees of grief, a few simple reminders on handling suppressed emotions that have finally surfaced. Most of it was lost on Draco. The remaining of it has been long forgotten under yet another mouthful of alcohol.
“Alright,” Draco says.
“The point I’m making, you washed up fool, is that you’re sending Teddy mixed signals. I was sure you’d be bested by a lot of things, but even I never imagined that a two-year-old would have been one of them.” Turning on his heel, Draco storms away, nose in the air.
“Think I’m...I’m lost in the undergrowth,
Draco rubbed his eyes.
Harry’s mind immediately starts to wander, thinking of what the unprepared Ministry staff must be struggling to handle behind Azkaban’s new walls. It was just how Lucius Malfoy was murdered, riots in the prison led by those most devoted to Voldemort.
“Teddy?” Harry calls. “Teddy, what are you doing?”
"I wish I had seen who did it."
“That’ll just make it hurt more.”
Harry’s heart is full all the while, swollen with happiness.
Potter rubs a finger pad into his eyes as he drops into the chair next to Teddy, ruffles his hair. “Hm? No. Teddy found me about...I think it was about three or four?”
Just great.
“Look who you’re talking to, old man.”
“You know, we really ought to be more consistent with him. We’re giving him two completely different sets of expectations.”
The look in her eyes already answered the question for him. "Of course not, no."
Though they had enjoyed countless memorable snogging sessions in varying states of undress, Harry and Draco still hadn't cross the line into active, skin-to-skin touching below the waist. Not that Harry hadn't wanted to with every fiber of his being. But as Draco hadn't stepped any closer to the line, Harry hadn't, either.
"Why do you get to make the rules?"
“He’s actually right about the age.”
He watched her disappear down the corridor and onto a staircase, then looked around. They seemed quite alone.
Teddy whines and draws his knees further up between his and Malfoy’s chests.
"I'm sure he'll be okay," Hermione said. Harry looked over at her and she, too, was watching Draco sadly. "It can't be fun now, but all these rumors about him and his mum...well, that's all they are. Just rumors made up and started to try and hurt them."
"Oh, Harry, it's really quite obvious if you know anything at all about love." Luna's smile brightened at Harry's silence, as though he had somehow given her the perfect response. She hooked her arm in his and began to drag him down the corridor. "Come, let's go to dinner. You shouldn't skip too many meals, you know."
"Oh, Ginny, they wouldn't have left. Ron and Harry have been friends for nearly a decade! Besides, Harry hasn't gone back on a promise yet."
ruin his life.”
A small girl beside him, a true first year no older than eleven by the looks of her, sniffled. Despite having died inside long ago, Draco's heart ached at the sound. He glanced over at her. Immensely tiny with a head of tight brown curls, the girl looked downright miserable. No matter what Professor McGonagall could say, all the younger students knew that Slytherin was the bad House, the House that produced more evil witches and wizards than any other, the House that the Dark Lord himself was sorted into while at Hogwarts, the House that didn't stay to defend the castle, the House that was now being eyed with suspicion.
His room couldn't come fast enough, and as Draco gathered his things to take the bath he did truly want to take, he fought to breathe normally through his constricting chest. His mother was right, of course. To no longer be Harry's enemy was one thing, a good thing. To become too friendly with him, to take things as far as he already had with Harry was another thing entirely. Hope for it not to completely blow up in his face was wishful thinking at best. As the large bath filled with steaming water, Draco glared sadly at himself in the mirror.
"Goodnight, Harry."
Draco, at the counter with his back to them, looks over his shoulder. “When I told him it was your birthday, he wanted to make a cake, and I am too traumatized by the last time to try again, so one thing led to another, and Teddy picked enchiladas.” He turns back to the stove. “I’m not entirely sure this is quite right, though.”
And Draco has never suffered such guilt.
“I say yuv you!” Teddy half-shouts.
No, Draco had never hated his mother for the events of the past. She had always been far stronger and braver than his father could have ever hoped to be. More than once, even before all the Darkness had penetrated their home, Draco had wondered what on earth she ever saw in his father. Regardless of how his father had treated him, causing more than one argument Draco overheard, she had stayed and remained unwaveringly loyal to Lucius Malfoy.
When the clock strikes four and he’s free, all Harry wants to do is crash onto the couch and pretend he doesn’t exist for a few minutes. The desire vanishes the moment he Apparates into the living room, replaced with bewildered curiosity.
"Didn't you wear a cloak?"
Draco breathed a laugh. "Somehow, I don't think that's all that's on your mind."
“Well,” Ms. Dribble plows on, “since you’ll likely be legally free of one another once Mr. Potter graduates, it might be better in the long term to simply stay put if the arrangement is working alright. I suspect, Mr. Potter, that you’ll be wanting your own space when that time comes and you have more means for proper child care, hm?”
And without another word, yet another person left Draco. He stood there, bag halfway packed and Madam Pince wheezing on his neck, feeling renewed guilt and misery. Karen was just a child trying to do right by someone she thought of as a friend. He hadn't meant to hurt her feelings so deeply. Draco sighed, feeling incredibly old as he left the library. Maybe he could finish his homework in the dormitory.
It was pure ecstasy, this pleasure and safety Harry felt with Draco. He had felt it before being able to kiss Draco as he wanted, but now that they had leapt off the precipice that had separated them the past several weeks, Harry was falling fast.
“Water?”
“What matters?”
After Harry failed to put Teddy down for bed in underwear two nights in a row, Draco was so obnoxiously insistent that Harry do so that he...well, he did so. But for all Draco’s pushing the toilet training this week, it appears as if Harry will be the one changing the sheets in the middle of the night. Probably because Draco’s horrendous and Teddy’s scared of him. Clearly he’s unhinged, Harry thinks groggily, sitting up. Not wanting Teddy to think Harry’s annoyed with
The group was shivering violently despite their layers, and everyone nodded in agreement, inching toward the nearby Three Broomsticks Pub.
Draco looks up at the clock as he signs out of his shift, carefully writing the time: 9:28pm. Sundays are particularly slow for the apothecary, leaving Draco plenty of time for the more tedious work that Lloyd can find him. Instead of kicking back with a book as he’s seen Lloyd do on several occasions, Draco whittles away his twelve hours counting the eyes of gnats by hand, rotating the perishable ingredients, dusting the decades-old boxes of back-stocked scales, and other such mind-numbing tasks. When he first started working under Lloyd, Draco despised the menial work. Recently, it’s been nice not to think about anything in particular for hours on end. He’s found that it leaves him more refreshed for the week.
“Otay, Ah-wee.” And Teddy promptly sits, begins sifting his fingers through the grass.
Now, Draco is constantly breathing in a department store. That, too, is nauseating.
"Well, I thought it was just her at first, but when I thought about kissing another girl, any other girl, the, uh...feeling didn't go away."
"I am not too young to understand."
“Of course you would think an independent toddler is better than loving one.”
The applause died away, and Professor McGonagall cleared her throat, again commanding quiet. "Now, before we can begin our feast, I must discuss something of the utmost importance with each and every one of you sitting in this Hall tonight."
“Wow, I...” Harry blinks. “Well, thank you.”
Wow, was she livid.
"What's it to you?" Draco asked, meaning to sound sneering but only coming across as wary.
“En’ci’yada!”
"Dandelions?" Draco asked, sidetracked. "Lovegood, it's almost November."
“He’s been really, er...shy.”
"Sorry," Karen said. "I'm just curious."
“Yes, Potter."
fancy listening to the taunts about abysmal cooking (which Harry’s is
She sat beside him, placing two plates on the island.
"I'd rather not," Ron was groaning.
"I've made enough mistakes of my own without bringing him into this."
Hurt flickered through the blind pleasure that had taken Harry hold. But even in his haze, he could hear Draco's own hesitation at his suggestion. Harry didn't want to push Draco, though, and he let his hand fall from Draco's hair and came back around his waist.
Only a twinge of shame flickers in his chest when he looks up at the multitude of tall buildings before him. After Potter left him in the atrium, Draco promptly scrapped his original plan of reclaiming Teddy without breaking a single rule. Years of experience made Draco’s hunt for Potter’s address take less than an hour in the all-but-deserted Wizarding Resources Department.
“But...but...Ha-wee yuv Daco?”
“The Ministry dispatched the appropriate response teams immediately, though upon arrival it was clear that the inhabitants, a Ms. Narcissa Malfoy and Ms. Andromeda Tonks, did not survive the blast.”
It felt good not to be afraid. He was done. Done with the overwhelming and overriding fear that had consumed him for years, done with letting his insecurities and his past define him and guide him. Draco was
Harry dropped his forehead onto the cool sink, panting. His hands were a mess, but at least their clothes hadn't been sacrificed in the name of love.
Regardless, the reception is easily more enjoyable. The men are able to undo the topmost clasps of their dress robes for easier breathing, and there’s food and drink to accompany the mingling that surrounds a frenzied dance floor. Although Teddy behaved well during the ceremony, Harry can tell that Fleur is ready for a break and relieves her. It has him spending most of the reception working to keep Teddy entertained and out from underfoot, keeping him close as Harry catches up with a few friends from Hogwarts and various Weasley relatives, including a second cousin of Ron’s that is frighteningly forward. She seems nice enough, but her hands are bold, roaming Harry’s chest the entire time they talk. It’s only when Teddy accidentally sets her shoes alight that Harry has an excuse to be rid of her.
“I’m going to win,” Draco seethes.
“Yes.”
Draco could fly with the ecstasy. Instead, he settles for arriving at the Ministry right at eleven o’clock, trying not to look too eager through his open contentedness.
"You...you left this in Ancient Runes," she said. "When you didn't come back, I thought something might have happened. But some Slytherins I asked saw you writing a letter and said you'd probably be here."
"Neither am I. But you're littler and stronger than I am. You need to eat."
Harry glances back. Ginny, looking exasperated on Mrs. Weasley’s right, is two rows directly behind him. She does look quite nice. All the sun from playing professional Quidditch has given her a permanently sun-kissed look, something she wears well. But when Ginny catches his eye and grins, Harry’s reminded that things are different between them now. Much as they both wanted to rekindle the romance from sixth year, neither Harry nor Ginny were able to make it work. The affection had lost its sensuality, morphed into something far closer to that of siblings. It just wasn’t the same.
Draco stumbled to his feet. His head rushed at the movement, and he slumped against the wall. Resigned and horrified, Draco finally looked at the small blond that stood beside him.
“What?”
"We...well, we talked a bit," Ron said, looking uncomfortable. Harry's stomach churned in anticipation and his heart was already beginning to sink when Ron finally grimaced and took a deep breath. "Look, he...I'm sorry, Harry. He said that he just can't do this to his mum. He said that it's over."
"Er...not sure," Harry slurred, teeth beginning to chatter. "Can't remember, Professor."
Granger's hand flew into the air. "Then why are we adding it, Professor?"
The complete constipation taking hold of Potter’s face as he grabs the paper is too much. Draco laughs.
“Er...what? You don’t have any?”
"But again, why would people choose that? Isn't...wouldn't making a baby the normal way just be way easier?"
Startled, Teddy's lip stuck out and his eyes screwed shut. Softly, he began to cry.
Harry sighed. "You were acquitted. Why do you insist on punishing yourself like this?"
"I knew it!" Professor Carraway called from above them.
you idiot.”
Ron rolled his eyes, but his smile fell slightly when they came back round to Harry. "Honest, though, Harry. I wouldn't have picked Malfoy for you to decide to go gay for-"
Harry was pretty sure that the feather in his hand was just the feather of a regular parrot, but he didn't say so.
"No, it isn't," Hermione said, coming over as some of the quiet faded back into conversation, newspaper in hand and Weasley at her back. "But here's what everyone's talking about."
"Malfoy?" The voice said again. "You awake?"
But that second voice, that sweet milk chocolate in Draco’s ears, isn’t deterred by the first voice’s alarm. “Daco back!”
Hermione was biting her lip, tears forming in her eyes. Harry gently grabbed her arm, bringing them to a stop in the empty corridor.
"When did you get to be so snarky?"
But no more.
“Again! Pease!”
“You-”
Being so late and walking off the high of what had happened in the broom closet, when Draco and Harry crept into the Gryffindor seventh year dormitory they had both been exhausted. They hadn't exchanged a word, silently stripping down to undershirts and changing into pajama pants, Harry wordlessly offering a pair to Draco, before climbing into the bed. Harry had taken the time to Freeze the curtains again, though Draco had sleepily wondered if it was necessary. He didn't know the details of what had happened in the Three Broomsticks after he had left, but Draco was sure that Harry and Weasley had a rather nasty row. It didn't seem likely that Weasley would bother them as he had before.
“Tired.”
"As much fun as last lesson was," Slughorn said to the class at large, "today will be bookwork, I'm afraid. So, quills, parchment, and textbooks out, please!" The class scrambled as they complied. "We will be diving into the more detailed work of ingredient properties, uses, dangers, and origins. To aide in this, you will each compose an essay for me on the 12 categories of major potions ingredients, to be turned in next Tuesday. It should be no less than six feet in length."
Malfoy’s eyes meet Harry’s. “The only thing is that my lease is through December.”
“...and Draco?”
Cold dread slammed into Draco's stomach, sloshing the little bit of stew that sat there. He knew that voice.
Hermione fixed him with a bemused look. "Right. You sound awfully certain."
Potter’s mouth falls open at that.
The week has not been kind to him.
"Well, then," he said, leaning up to kiss Draco. "I hate you."
“Because I’m off work!”
"I've been wondering," Josh asked, voice right above Draco. "How'd you manage to stay out of Azkaban? More Dark Magic? Nah, that can't be right. If I remember anything from last year, it was how much of a piss poor wizard you are. Couldn't even properly carry out your own Dark spells." He barked out a single laugh. Draco forced himself to look up. "You may not remember me, but I remember you. The Carrows were having all the
slide?”
“Which is what I was meaning,” Chase says with a courteous nod. “You’ve been impressively good with your money almost from the start of your employment. I have many other clients that still struggle with how to manage their money. All that aside, you ought to ask Harry Potter for some help.”
in Teddy’s voice. He reaches his arms out for Malfoy, who hurries forward and brings Teddy into his arms, embraces him tightly. Harry struggles against a grimace of annoyance at the comfort he wishes he could have given Teddy.
Three in the morning was far less late than it used to be. Draco had always grown up a morning person. He had always fallen asleep with the sun and woke with it. It was only when he began working tirelessly to repair the Vanishing Cabinet in his sixth year that time began to turn into a relative concept for him. Falling asleep became harder, staying asleep even worse. Now, three in the morning was practically his mid-morning.
Draco moaned.
“‘Might be surprised later,’” he seethes under his breath as he exits the department and makes for the lifts. “As if the egomaniac would ever ask anyone for help...he’ll run Teddy into the ground before he asks the Weasley nest for help, let alone me...”
A strangled chuckle came from Malfoy's throat, causing both he and Harry to look at each other in mild alarm. Harry grinned, realizing the Malfoy actually tried to laugh at him, but Malfoy just frowned and made his way up to the cauldrons to collect a sample of each poison. When he returned, Harry had his textbook propped open to the chapter that outlined poisons.
"I didn't sick anyone on you, you git!" Only a few feet separated them, but Potter took a step closer as his voice rose to match Draco's. "And whether you like it or not, I do worry! And it's a damn good thing I did, too, or else you would've died on the floor Friday!"
"That has to be the most cliche thing I think I've ever heard you say."
“Have you gone absolutely mad?” Harry squeaks. “Do you really hate me that much that I accidentally kicked your cat last weekend?”
Draco nodded and glared at the ground as he rose from the bed.
“My lease expires at the end of this month,” he begins, slowly, haltingly. Malfoy raises his eyes back to Harry’s, brows furrowing in confusion. “I could...we could find a flat big enough for the three of us. Take some pressure off us both.”
"What?"
"Someone else, then."
She narrowed her eyes. "I'm not asking. Eat something. You haven't eaten in nearly two days. Now get to it, go on."
“It won’t be long before there’s a break out, mark my words,” Ron says darkly. “Maybe Malfoy trying to toilet train Teddy early isn’t entirely mental. Not compared to the nutters that sign up to guard Azkaban of their own free will.”
Malfoy scoffs. “If I were, it would be absolutely none of your concern.”
“Malfoy and I just need time to get used to each other.”
“Teddy, it’s nearly dinnertime anyway, we’re not-”
"Well, I haven't exactly mentioned it. I had entirely forgotten that you were related to him, though."
Draco wonders if he’ll be embarrassed tomorrow. Likely.
He stopped to look at her. Hermione bit her lip but looked determined all the same.
"Of course you have a bloody invisibility cloak," Draco said, rolling his head back as he thought on all the times Potter had appeared somewhere seemingly impossible, how Potter always knew things he shouldn't.
It was his mother's handwriting.
"Weasley and Granger."
“Don’t get used to it.”
"I didn't particularly care."
"No one wants the old Draco back."
"Treat our Harry well, mind you," Weasley wheezed through his laughter.
Harry rocked back hard, slamming his arse against Draco's hips and nearly knocking them both off balance.
“Teddy, Ms. Dribble asked you something.”
The pause is deliberate, Draco knows. Chase is waiting, watching with neutral eyes and a faint smile. Heat fills Draco’s ears.
Harry groaned. He was still quite unsteady, leaning hard on the railings of each staircase, and he thought longingly of his bed that was so very far away.
But as Harry's heavy breathing slowed down and a yawn shook his body, he realized he had a dilemma he hadn't thought about when he made the decision to carry Malfoy's unconscious body across the castle and back to his bed.
"It's an invisibility cloak," Potter answered with a grin. "It was my dad's. You can wear this and walk beside me, and I'll lead you out. Fool proof."
Then again, after all Draco had done and said, he deserved it.
"This isn't your first time attacking Draco, is it?" she asked pointedly.
"You've got to be joking," Neville said.
Her face fell, and Draco felt a sharp pang of guilt at the sight.
"Come on, Mr. Potter, Mr. Malfoy!" Professor Sprout called over the noise. "Let's calm that Beta down! Too much stress will spoil the sap!"
Harry ran a hand through his hair, looking uncomfortable. "Er...not...not anything with a guy." He flushed, and Draco looked away, only regretting his question even more. "But even with...with a girl, it never got far. No...er...actual sex, at least."
"Alright then."
“Er...concerns?”
Draco hadn't a clue how long they sat there, he and Potter. Time didn't behave when Draco had these episodes. But as no other student passed by in the time it took him to finally calm down, Draco could only assume that less time had passed then he thought.
A slimy smile befell Slughorn's face. "Oh, I think that maybe a little extra credit added to your Potions N.E.W.T. score will be enough encouragement for you all."
"Why not the poisons chapter?"
“Boo tra-nong.”
"And her son, Draco?"
Too wound up and too lost in his panic to care, Draco felt himself relax marginally at the sound of Harry's voice in his ear, breathing in stuttered bits of air that contained
“That’s wonderful to hear. And Teddy? How has he handled the adjustment?”
He heard her scoff. "You're pathetic. I never thought you'd grow up to be a fucking poof."
Ms. Dribble shrugs. “You’re not wrong.”
“I don’t know,” Harry says with a shrug. “It’s easier now. Honestly, I think calling him something different’s helped. We still don’t agree on much, but we haven’t been at each other’s throats in weeks. We're able to just...talk now. It's always about Teddy, but I can't really imagine what else I'd talk to the bloke about.”
The bell rang as he passed the Great Hall. Draco swore, spinning and taking a different route that would be less crowded with students making their way to lunch. Tears burned at his eyes as he stepped into the frigid wind, finally reaching the Owlery. He quickly found the only horned owl and sent it off with his letter. Only then did Draco finally succumb to the tears.
"I'm asking."
“Not yet,” Draco says lowly, bordering a growl. “I’ve quite enough going on what with you and Teddy and now Potter without getting
"What am I doing to you?"
were you thinking?"
“Oh, yes, Harry, you’re absolutely right,” Draco says sarcastically. “I couldn’t have figured that out myself, definitely not. No, I just let him wander the flat all day expecting him to tell me when he was ready on day one of toilet training. Thank Merlin’s soiled underpants you’re here to set me right. Where would anyone be without The Boy Who Knows All to help us-”
With everything his little legs have, Teddy leaps to his feet and bolts for the door. And as much as he would love to watch Draco chase a soiled toddler around before he leaves for work, Harry steps in Teddy’s way and grabs his arm. He immediately turns to goo, sinking to the floor and thrashing like a wild animal.
“Is that what that smell is?”
"Eh, you're an adult now," Aberforth had growled after Harry just stared at him for a long time once ordering. "You want to drown your sorrows, be my guest."
Draco did, and it was pure, lust-driven euphoria when the last of their clothing was gone and Harry could feel every inch of Draco's body against his. He groaned, pulling Draco into him as he kissed those lips once more, forcing himself to slow down and kiss with more love than lust. Their lips melded together as their bodies twisted more onto their sides, legs wrapping around the other's as Harry poured his heart into their embrace.
Approaching footsteps echoed in the far end of the corridor, and Malfoy started as though burned. With a last puzzled look at Harry, Malfoy turned and strode off, leaving Harry standing alone.
"Do you need me to go grab you something?" Harry asked. He wasn't obligated by any means to provide for Teddy, but he still wanted to help where he could.
Draco's gasping words drew Harry out of his blissful haze, blinking as he pulled his head back just enough to look in the other's eyes. "What?"
Exhaustion met Harry when he woke early Sunday morning. The sun had barely breached the horizon, and he knew that, though breakfast was likely ready to be served, the hospital wing wouldn't be prepared for visitors yet. He yawned and rubbed his face, then dressed sluggishly.
"So today, as an opener, I'd like you all to concoct as best a sample of a simple Bliss Potion. Make sure you are brewing the Bliss Potion rather than the Biiss Potion, a rather nastily effective exfoliator." Slughorn chuckled. "We'll be testing your potions next week, and I shudder to think of what would happen to one who drinks an Exfoliating Potion."
"Back from the past."
"Surely you didn't."
"Well, you don't have to
A huge smile spread across Harry's face. "Alright then."
“Well, sure, but-”
Draco stands, hurries for the door.
“And it's not like I'm suggesting you move in with him directly, even if that'd save you even more time and money and effort, and could be beneficial in it's own way."
The witch sitting there is a girl named Gemma. Devastatingly beautiful and hopelessly peasant, she was the year under Draco at Hogwarts but in Ravenclaw; she knows exactly who Draco is. But since the day they met, she has been nothing short of optimistically kind.
Even without the potion, Draco was sure that he was truly happy in that moment.
Draco's hands slid up Harry's front, finally finding and working the buttons there. A smirk crossed Harry's lips. Careful not to break their kiss, he pulled one of his hands from Draco's back and reached around him to the doorknob at his hip, locking it.
“I was actually going to tell you that maybe you have a point about Teddy learning to sleep on his own.”
The Gryffindor common room was so...
“Fancy a quick birthday drink? Hermione said she’d duck out a bit early to join if I could convince you.”
It was like the size of a match.”
"Look," Harry said, cutting across Hermione as she opened her mouth to retort. "Let's not get into it here, okay? The lesson is about to start."
“Then Teddy be removed from your care and placed up for adoption, where the process would begin again.”
“Oh, I’ve noticed. But today’s different,” Malfoy says, crossing his arms. “You have somewhere to be, haven’t you?”
Draco was pretty certain that his nose was broken after falling spectacularly down an entire flight of stairs. Well, it had less to do with falling as it had to do with the badly aimed Disarming Spell that hit him square in the back as he made his way down toward the dungeons. Studying that morning had gone surprisingly well for all his differing deprivations, but Draco's reputation found him within moments of the library door shutting quietly behind him.
"Ohh f-fuck," Harry moaned softly. Finally giving up on whatever his hands had been trying to do, he rested his hands on Draco's head, gently wrapping them in the hair there.
“Excellent, excellent.” Mr. Cook lowers his attention to the parchment in his lap, reading through his notes. Draco chances a glance at Harry, who gives a grateful nod. “And how have you two been getting along?”
Instead, he saw Harry Potter.
Harry blinks in surprise. “Uh...thanks, Teddy. How’d you know it’s my birthday?”
Neville dropped into the empty seat beside Harry, interrupting his thoughts.
Harry poured as much as he could into the kiss. He tried to tell Draco with his lips that he deserved every ounce of kindness he found, deserved every chance he was given, deserved
"Friends?" Draco scoffed. "I was far too much of a spoiled brat to have been anyone's friend back then."
Time seemed to crawl by as the class brewed their antidotes. With ten minutes remaining, Slughorn swept the room, inspecting their work and giving out marks. When the bell rang, Malfoy cleared his throat, calling Harry's attention.
Draco didn't like the sound of that. A twist usually ended badly.
"Oooh, getting some of that Malfoy swagger back?"
He can’t.
He’s changed dramatically from the squished mess that rolled around in the photos Lupin once showed Harry, Ron, and Hermione. Now a thick-set little toddler with large brown eyes and sandy brown hair, Teddy is fast becoming his own little person, growing rapidly. Harry pulls Teddy into his chest, breathes him in.
Weasley snorted. "That why you broke up with Ginny?"
As the party unraveled into the night, Harry found he couldn't keep the grin off his face. Not to take away from Ron and Hermione's night, neither he nor Draco brought up their new engagement, but it didn't matter. Harry was in love with his life. The road had been rough, the journey a damned nightmare at times, but Harry felt that he had finally reached the destination he had always sought. He wondered what adventures the future could hold for him, for Draco and Ron and Hermione. Whatever they turned out to be, Harry was confident that they could handle it so long as they had one another.
Mr. Cook raises a hand. “Although of legal age, you are still only nineteen; quite young to be taking on a toddler. In addition, if I’m to believe the general gossip, you are not married or in any sort of long-term relationship-”
"Sorry," Draco said, taking a seat at the island in the center of the large kitchen. "Just distracted by something was all. Did...did you cook all this? It smells wonderful."
It wasn't even just homework that Draco's bed ruined for him. Nightmares of his mother's face in Azkaban kept him awake enough, but the mere feel of his bed beneath him brought images and sensations too wonderful not to be painful. Between the two, Draco's sleep had reached an all-time low, rendering him useless in his lessons and the perfect target for anyone that still hated him.
“And I can prove all those concerns to be a waste of time,” Harry snaps before he can think better of it.
"Draco, please," Harry moaned after a minute. The heat of his climax was building deep in his abdomen, and Harry wasn't ready to be done.
“Maybe.”
"You and I both know Malfoy's not out to do anymore harm. That much is obvious if you spend five minutes with him and aren't completely thick. But most people
“Is that right?” Mr. Cook asks.
Draco shakes his head again before dropping it into his hands, elbows propped on the counter.
Draco shook himself, taking a controlled and deep breath, and burst through the doors.
Harry fucking Potter.
“That’s his bed. My bed is here.”
Bloody hell, he
Laughter sneaks up on Draco, tumbles out of him without warning. Obnoxious as he can undoubtedly be, Healer Chase can also be cruelly honest at times, something that puts Draco at ease in bizarre ways that Chase probably studies outside of their sessions together.
“Forgive me for not being frightened of the Chosen One in his underwear.”
Signing a contract with Potter, a legally binding document to get along for the sake of Teddy, is his best bet at making such a future his reality.
Harry smirked. Sweet victory.
Besides, Harry thought as the last of the first years found their seats and the Sorting Hat was put away, everything Malfoy did likely came down to wanting to please his family or keep them safe, something that Harry could only vaguely understand.
change, even if
The rest of the hour is a blur. The kitchen is such a disaster that Harry decides to leave it for last, instead tackling the living area and bedroom to make sure everything is put where it belongs or mostly so and cleaned as best he can. With only twenty minutes left to do so, Harry returns to the kitchen to set the dishes to wash themselves while he tidies up the clutter by hand.
"Don't call me that, and don't come back here."
More applause, though Draco couldn't tell if Professor Flitwick stood or not.
“NO!”
"An accident," Hermione repeated in disbelief, voice unusually high. "You never should have used such a spell anywhere near him, anywhere near any person! Especially not in some four-on-one..." she stuttered, looking for the word. "...street brawl!"
“I...I hadn’t yet thought about moving.”
"I know." Potter's face was serious, all traces of teasing gone. For a few seconds, Draco simply stood there and stared back at him, unsure of what to say. But when he realized that he was beginning to lean on his toes, chest leading him forward ever so slightly, Draco shook himself, stepped around Potter, and left without another word.
"I didn't realize you two were so close. I mean, I remember you liked him a lot as a teacher, but I didn't know you saw him much after he left."
Another hand gripped Draco's free arm, guiding him to sit down. The panic subsided ever so slightly, like the tide pulling out for a momentary lapse, and Draco lifted his eyes to Potter's.
Ron.”
"I'm feeling perfectly fine," he said after a couple more minutes of it. "Really. May I go now?"
“I-” Potter blinks once, twice, three times, brows knitting together. “What the hell, of course you did! All that talk about muggleborns before Voldemort’s return and after-”
Instead of answering, Harry pushed back onto Draco's cock, but Draco quickly took over, grabbing at Harry's hips and thrusting into him repeatedly without stopping. Harry grabbed at the nearby sink for support as he bent forward, hand dropping to his own swollen cock to start pumping in time with Draco's thrusts. It was fast and it was ecstasy, and it was only a few more minutes of furious fucking and stifling moans until Harry found himself trying to catch his release as he climaxed. His muscles contracted around Draco's cock, and it was barely a second more until Draco was gasping, too, his hips stuttering with his own orgasm.
"This year, we have several new staffing developments. As I have taken over as headmistress-" More applause. "-Professor Wilkinson from London will be taking over Transfiguration, and Professor Vector of the Arithmancy department will be the new Gryffindor Head of House."
"No, not really."
Rolling his eyes to find the clock, Draco just notes at the time. He needs to shower and ready for work. He doesn’t have time to figure out what Potter’s fixation with force-feeding children is, nor does he care to. With a sigh loud enough to convey just how above Potter he truly is, Draco leaves the kitchen to actually accomplish something today.
Harry gulps, nods.
Potter led Draco over to the table that Weasley and Granger were sharing. A nearby table held half a dozen other Gryffindors that Draco knew to be friendly with Potter, and he was glad that they seemed too distracted by their own conversations to look over just then. Potter dropped into the seat beside Weasley, leaving Draco to sit down between Potter and Granger.
His mother hadn't offered details, and Draco hadn't asked. But savagely, he knew his father deserved every second of whatever it was.
“And completely stupid-”
“Just- agh, come outside. Keep your voice down.” Potter points to a set of glass doors and leads the way through them and onto what might be called a balcony. Once Potter pulls the door nearly shut but for a fraction to listen for Teddy, he turns to face Draco with a dramatic sigh.
"I think he's sinking back into a depression," Hermione said when she saw where Harry's eyes were. "How have you been doing lately?"
Draco hums grimly.
"I didn't know you were Teddy's godfather," Draco said once they had left the pathway and turned onto the lane.
Teddy climbs onto the couch, crashing into Harry’s lap. “No seep.”
"Yeah, well," Ron grinned up at her, eyes adoring. "Missed you."
Harry held his breath as she stepped onto the tower, not seeing them as she focused on the scene before her. It was absolutely mad, but Draco's plan looked as though it just might work. Draco nodded to the staircase and they tiptoed over, around the corner, and onto the stairs.
That has to be the strangest part about the whole ordeal, seeing Malfoy interacting with Teddy. Three weeks later, Harry still can’t quite wrap his head around how genuine Malfoy can smile, how the kindness transforms his sickly appearance into something almost human. It’s not natural.
"This is a new year at Hogwarts, but it is also a new era for our world. This is a time of peace, unity, and kindness. It is never easy to move on from the tragic pasts we now all hold. It does not do to forget those times, but we ought to use those memories to chart our paths into a better and brighter future. Every witch and wizard here is living in the aftermath of a deadly war that cost us all something. Old habit die hard. But I must impress upon you all that while you are within the walls of this castle, blind prejudice and hate are not going to be tolerated. Each and every individual here has the same right to be here. Any disrespect or violence guided by these prejudices will be dealt with most severely."
Hermione nodded. "He's been avoiding you, hasn't he?"
"Then help me."
Again.
A collective groan followed these words, but Slughorn either didn't hear it or paid it no mind. He immediately dived into his lecture, wand waving as he added bulleted points to the board. Before long, only the scratching quills and Slughorn's oily voice filled the classroom.
"No, no, no, I'm sorry," Harry laughed. "I'm just laughing because..."
From here, I like to think that the story drifts into 'we're actually going somewhere' territory :D
Malfoy, however, seemed relaxed.
Switching off the tap, Draco braced himself on the sink and let his head hit the mirror. His neck was tired from holding it up for so long. He wondered if he could be so lucky as to just die of starvation right then and there in the bathroom. It would save his mother the trouble of seeing the horribly twisted version his body would become after a leap off the Astronomy Tower.
“I’d say that’s a fair assessment.”
But he was weak, and the unconsciousness won.
A nearby bench splinters along the backing.
"Well, it's just..." Hermione laughed lightly. "I'm just surprised you haven't thought about it. I mean...okay, some couples can't have children because one or the other might not be physically capable because of cancers or mutations in their genes, right?"
"Yes. Yes, of course I'll marry you."
"I had just been about to leave when you came into the room with Malfoy in your arms," she said pointedly. "And when Ron had told me the next morning that you had your curtains Frozen, I just...I kind of assumed..."
“Can’t choose our past. Just our present. Sometimes our future.”
"Oi! Malfoy!"
You stole the sun from-”
sooOoOo, now that you've powered through some of what might've felt like filler, I hope the 'okay now're really actually starting to see each other differently' uphill is worth it. I still stand by thinking that how Harry and Draco interact with Teddy is crucial in how they end up developing from teenagers-with-issues-and-attitudes into more. So thanks to those who are sticking it out; sorry to those who are finding this droning
"Mmm," Draco hummed as he watched Harry pull on his shoes. Without asking, Harry found an extra shirt of Draco's and slipped it over his head.
“I lived across the hall from him and Andromeda for a full year, you complete idiot.”
“Not quite like Draco,” she whispers. “Draco’s still around; you see him everyday. We’re remembering those who have...have gone forever. Like...like your Mamie and Aunt Narcissa.”
Of all the books Potter has for Teddy (although it’s far more likely that the vast amount is due to Granger), Draco hates this one the most. It’s a basic children’s book on shapes and colors, which is boring enough as so without also being a muggle publication. The colors don’t flow through all the shades, the shapes don’t dance around and shift, and the words don’t work around the page like they do on the wizarding picture books Teddy has. But this absolute abomination is the boy’s favorite, it seems, and Draco is so near to fainting with sheer boredom. He flips the little board book back to its front, opens to the first page, begins to read.
"What happened?"
"If you two partner together, you're going to fail. Between Draco and me, you two stand a better chance. So go, Ron! Slughorn's bound to start the lesson soon."
Harry laughed, resuming his rocking on Draco's cock.
The Care-Seekers made sure to schedule the appointment for a time when Draco and Harry could both be present, a little off-putting but understandable. Although having the meeting so late will throw off Teddy’s nightly routine, which always results in significantly less sleep for everyone, Draco’s glad the Care-Seekers were willing to accommodate around his psychotherapy rather than insisting he take off work. That would have been more of a headache for all the Ministry requirements of him. Theoretically, it was supposed to make everything all the easier.
"A bit grouchy? I'm-"
It was a little past midnight, and Harry was roaming the castle instead of sleeping again. Drained as he was, he couldn't stop the onslaught of thoughts, memories, and emotions that came for him when the sun went down. Ron had mostly apologized for breakfast, though Harry was fairly certain the apology had been delivered only at Hermione's insistence.
He chuckled when Draco rolled his eyes.
"Fu-uck," Draco hissed.
“Diamond.”
“And why not? He’s not going to eat it just to be difficult.”
It’s Teddy.
"Shh...breathe."
"Trick stair on the staircase," he said stiffly. "I...I wasn't paying attention."
But as nausea began to take hold of him, the world spinning faster, Draco could hear sounds that definitely did not belong in his quiet and very private dormitory. The sounds came more into focus, the vague booming turning into approaching footfalls, gentle rumbles becoming soft voices. Everything sounded too loud, and Draco's nausea increased.
Harry opened his mouth to reply, but Slughorn chose that moment to begin the lesson.
"Look, I know...I know things have been a huge mess for both of us in the past, but let's stop living in it. Can you stop punishing yourself for what's happened and start moving forward?" Harry swallowed. "With...with me?"
"Draco," he said, trying not to sound nervous. "She just gets like that sometimes. She doesn't mean anything by it. She's probably just been drinking herself and-"
Harry broke into a run.
"Oh, Draco."
"I was here that night, you know."
Draco clenches his teeth, breathing slowly through his nose. It’s not exactly a sensitive subject, not after all the years he’s known he could never achieve his childhood dream career, but he still doesn’t like to be reminded of it. He shakes his head, taking a long drink before answering. “It doesn’t matter. I can’t do it now anyway.” Sensing that Harry is about to press further, Draco shifts the conversations, asks, “Are you prepared for the interview with the Care-Seekers tomorrow?”
