A month later, Karaoke Night has been made official. EVERYONE wants to participate, even a mildly reluctant Draco.
Draco was at his wit's end! Not only had the book he was waiting on NOT arrived, but he was now receiving impatient letters from the Dark Lord – which were in code of course – threatening dire consequences if he didn't complete his task soon. Unless that book contained a miracle that fixed that Salazar damned cabinet, he was done. There was nothing more he could do.
Harry had been more or less ignoring the Karaoke, but suddenly a rather heavy beat started, and a trio of girls banged their heads until it was time for them to sing. The reason this caught Harry's attention was because they were singing in Japanese and the only part he could understand was when they said: “
As you might suspect by now, I very often visualize Harry and or Draco singing just about everything I hear, lol ^_^
Harry shook his head. “No, I'm not going to give the bitch the satisfaction of knowing that she got to me. Besides, after writing enough lines to satisfy her for the night, the fuzzy spell had worn off, so when she told me to let her look at my hand, she looked right at me and got hit by the full effect of the curse. She tickled me until I chucked up all over her, so, I got her back and good!”
Ron raised a brow in amusement. A glance over at Ginger showed that she'd gotten closer to them so that she could watch the show – which was actually so that she could verify in her report that they did in fact do as ordered and take the potion. Taking a deep breath, Harry licked the nine drops of Lust Potion off Ron's cleavage, making Ron moan in surprise.
Draco didn't know what to say to that. Thankfully, before he had to decide, a stag Patronus ran into the room. They all stared at him in surprise for a moment.
Draco was not the only one suddenly staring at Harry in shock. Harry was now the one fervently wishing that the table would absorb him and put an end to his misery.
Months passed. Harry had a horrifying vision in which he was a giant snake that bit Arthur Weasley. After making a fuss until everyone believed him – thereby saving Arthur's life – Harry spent the entire Christmas hols at Grimmauld place with Sirius and the Weasleys. Just before it was time to go back, Snape showed up with unpleasant news.
Both elves popped into the room looking like they'd quite like to murder each other. “Master/Sir called?”
“Every breath you take, every move you make, every bond you break, every step you take, I'll be watching you.” Harry blushed as well, feeling like a creepy stalker despite the fact that he knew it was a very famous song – that he HADN'T written. Incongruously, at the same time, he couldn't help but look Draco in the eyes as if making an actual vow to dog his every step.
But what could Harry do? It was just one more thing that made his life seem weird. It's not like he had any friends he could ask what normal was.
Harry kissed Draco again and they got lost in it for several long moments, until it occurred to Harry to wonder why his Alarm Charm hadn't gone off yet, and THAT reminded him that he had preemptively turned it off when he woke up so that it wouldn't wake Draco. “FUCK! I'm probably late!” Harry wailed in dismay before stealing another quick kiss. “I've gotta go! See you tomorrow night?”
“You let me violate you... you let me desecrate you... you let me penetrate you... you let me complicate you... Help me! I broke apart my insides... Help me! I've got no soul to sell... Help me! The only thing that works for me... help me get away from myself, I wanna fuck you like an animal... I wanna feel you from the inside... I wanna fuck you like an animal... my whole existence is flawed... you get me
As he was being licked, Harry had a chance to look over at Draco, who was now sitting in his original chair, reclining a bit with his shirt unbuttoned and a random woman from The Club licking potion drops off his well groomed chest. Pressing his lips together, Harry had to fight the urge to go over there and shout until the whole bloody Club went home. Standing up, Harry turned to Ron.
Thankfully, something important occurred to the Dark Lord fairly quickly, and so, he took off and let them all recover. Greyback was allowed to leave, but Bellatrix insisted that Draco take her to the four he'd turned into small boulders so that she could vent her rage and frustration on them. Before he could go to bed that night, Draco was forced to help dig graves for the four of them and Wormtail – as it had turned out that he was dead: possibly murdered by Harry.
Draco's plan actually relied on them holding the area at the bottom of the stairs to the Astronomy Tower and as much of the corridor as possible, so that they could get the job done and have a relatively secure exit route. Unfortunately, a bit of a fierce battle broke out as the Death Eaters tried to protect their plan and the others tried to protect the school from them.
Harry was REALLY into it now, but Draco couldn't help but frown. He wasn't certain if the song was originally sung by a man or a woman, thus the lyrics about a boy COULD just be the woman who originally sang it, but coming from Harry, it made Draco pause. WAS Harry intentionally trying to say something? Such as he liked some boy???
And with that, they went their separate ways, both strangely looking forward to returning to school next fall.
“He's more or less fine. Certainly no worse off than if he'd gotten drunk off his arse,” the Mediwitch pronounced after a thorough examination. She then pointed at Ron – both of them had long since changed back. “And that one is in even better condition. Barely even tipsy at this point. The potion is probably designed to wear off quickly so that people will keep buying more drops.”
Draco shook his head. “I'm not trying to ask details. I found a book in our library that gave me all the information I think there is on it. Except, well...”
Unfortunately, neither of them could ever actually say that out loud. And then Harry was gone. Draco stood there, numb and not even caring that he was bleeding from the shards of crystal that had cut him up. Humming very very softly in sympathy, Narcissa rubbed his back while no one was looking. And then...
Back at Number 4 Privet Drive, Harry trudged to his room, grateful that the Dursleys weren't home at the moment. He flopped on his bed and tried his best to NOT think about what had happened. Voldemort had been resurrected. Cedric had died. Life was definitely going to get worse!
Draco nodded. “I always wondered what it would be like to have hair that did whatever it wanted and just not care how it looked.”
Draco couldn't help it, he was bloody impressed! And relieved. So relieved that he broke his promise to himself.
Ron sniggered a bit, and then held up Harry's wrist and drew a line right across his pulse points. The woman grinned at him knowingly as she placed the drop in the exact center. Ron licked up the potion, his tongue surprising Harry with how erotic that felt.
Harry sighed in relief, since his brain had had about a second to wonder what would happen once Draco looked at him properly again. Then he felt extremely self conscious. Torn between looking at Draco and not, Harry decided to keep his face buried in the bed.
“Alright my lovelies!” The Entertainer called out, regaining their attention. “Our first song of the night is about to begin, BUT it's now officially after 10 PM and YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS!!!”
Draco couldn't help but wince at the sound of the name, not even despite the fact that he was more or less expecting it, since it was well known that Dumbledore was too cocky to fear saying the name.
“Aw, come on now, don't make a big deal just because it's my turn,” Harry begged with a becoming pout.
Hermione quirked a brow at him. “Was your dare to tell someone a truth you don't *think* they already know?”
Sometime in January, Harry found a book in the girls' bathroom that had upset Moaning Myrtle, and too curious to just leave well enough alone, he kept it. After a horrifying Valentine's day, Harry finally figured out the secret to the diary.
“It's a pain in the arse, if I'm honest. It takes a LOT of work to keep it just so,” Draco admitted in a murmured, feeling slightly better about the conversation now. He took his bottle of wine back and poured some in a glass like a civilized person.
“Harry! You bloody fucking idiot! HOW is getting married going to solve anything if you're not happy with the way things are?!” Draco demanded, getting angry now himself.
Harry was not pleased to find himself sticking to the disturbing theme of the last song. “Well I'm not paralyzed but I seem to be struck by you, I wanna make you move because you're standing still.”
Ron gave this a lot of thought, and as much as the thought of singing his own feelings made him sick, he could sort of see how Blaise had a point. Harry HAD been a moody and downright prickly arsehole lately. If this had a chance of succeeding, it might actually be worth it. He looked to the ceiling for guidance, and then sighed.
Draco snorted in amusement. “I'm under the influence of a bloody TRUTH potion! It can't make me do anything I don't want to except for tell the truth!”
But this didn't deter Vernon. He reached out with both hands and tickled Harry anywhere he could reach as Harry rolled around on his bed. When Harry fell off his bed to land at Vernon's feet, the large man squatted with great difficulty so that he could continue the torturous wiggling of his fingers all over Harry's body. Not even his denims and thick cotton tee shirt provided much defense.
There was a deafening silence for a long moment as everyone held their breaths to see what had happened. Sheer chaos returned as the whole hall broke into tumultuous cheers. Everyone swarmed Harry trying to hug or at least touch some part of him. Even Draco managed to squeeze in and catch his hand for a moment before slipping away and finally going to his parents, who were standing together in a corner and both looked like they were about to faint from the relief of the Dark Lord dying. When they saw him coming, they let out sobs of even greater relief and held their arms open for him.
Looking ready to breathe fire again, Draco cast his Patronus. “Tell Potter: What's there to talk about? Clearly, we had vastly different definitions of what was going on.”
Pansy's part came first. “You're the light, you're the night, you're the color of my blood, you're the cure, you're the pain, you're the only thing I wanna touch, never knew that it could mean so much, so much...”
Draco bristled until Harry ran a hand down his spine and pressed a kiss to his shoulder. “Hmm... I think this conversation would best be conducted outside. Ladies, what do you think? Bonfire?”
Harry barely had a moment to wonder what Draco would think about this turn of events before Ginger was leading them to the nearest Apparation point. She promptly Side-Alonged them both to the place on Knockturn Alley that they were investigating.
Harry wasn't quite sure how – as he was panting and heaving in recovery – but Dumbledore got Harry out of the way and magicked a golden statue to protect him. As Harry calmed down a bit, although his head still hurt quite a lot, he managed to pull down his shirt and put on his pants and trousers.
To emphasize his point that this was absolutely not allowed, the Dark Lord murdered her with an Avada Kedavra, and then fed her to his enormous pet snake. Despite expecting that both of these things might happen, Draco was startled enough by it happening literally right above and in front of him, that he fell out of his chair.
Harry decided the time was right to regain control of the conversation. “Yeah, but what if I don't need any of that? I already have two vaults full of gold, and I can't imagine needing to inherit anything several decades from now.”
Very dimly, Draco was aware of Harry chasing after them. Of Harry racing through the battlefield casting spells left and right as no one was quite quick enough to register his unexpected presence in time to truly stop or delay him by more than a couple of seconds.
At first, Draco decided that his best bet was to not look at Harry at all and pretend that he had no idea who the boy was. However, his plan was immediately foiled because everyone was eager to have him confirm Harry's identity. Lucky for him, everyone was so focused on Harry's face that they weren't looking at Draco's. Draco felt a moment of concern – which probably showed on his face – over how distressingly abused Harry looked.
This had a rather unexpected effect: Draco stopped. He pulled back slightly to look at Harry, who turned his head to look him in the eye. The two stared at each other for a long moment.
“Where's the fun in that?!” Terry asked with a snort. “It should be things like: I dare you to strip off and streak across the Quidditch Pitch!”
Even so, the thought that Harry was trying to get someone in particular to date him had Draco feeling nauseous and rather ill. He almost couldn't concentrate when Daphne and Theo went up to sing a heated mashup of
An eternity might have passed in a cloud of bliss, but suddenly, a voice yanked them from their euphoria. “HARRY!! Where ARE you?! You're going to miss dinner!”
Draco was torn between being relieved and upset when he alone was allowed to leave the house arrest they'd all been placed under. Even Bella, who hadn't been physically punished, was still in hot water and confined to the Manor. The fact of the matter was that Draco alone had a way in which he could still be useful, and that was going back to school and torturing as many rebellious students as he could. Knowing that his family would suffer if he didn't, he cast aside all of his emotions and really threw himself into the task.
Not wanting to hurt his beloved – even though he'd lied about it to Harry's face – Draco scrunched up his face and threw himself into a course of action that would seal his fate one way or the other. “Cruci–”
Upon arriving in his ancestral home, Draco dropped to his knees in relief. There – on his hands and knees – he panted and heaved and really thought he was going to throw up for so many reasons, until his mother stroked his back soothingly with one hand even as she cast cooling spells over him with the other.
Harry was inexplicably fascinated to see that Ernie and Padma were still at it, and Terry was positively SEETHING as he watched them. Clearly, he had been hoping for that dare. Harry also had to guess that Ron's dare had been written be Ernie – as only a Hufflepuff – or maybe a girl in general – would have come up with such fluffy dare.
Through an act of INSANE luck, Harry – once he yanked his wand up and broke the weird golden bond between them – managed to run over to Cedric – dodging spells left and right – until he dove onto Cedric's body and – just as Voldemort was ONCE AGAIN about to cast the Killing Curse – summoned the cup and was gone.
“But you didn't seem to be happy with me anymore, so I thought maybe I should just wait until,” he sighed and shook his head. “I dunno, I made you happy again.” Harry held Draco tighter and rested his head on Draco's chest. “But then you said you were going home, and that word made my heart hurt. I want you to think of HERE as your home! I don't want you to ever leave!”
A soft sound like a laugh emerged from under the covers. “Breakfast in bed, Potter? Aren't I the lucky one?”
“That's not the problem!” Draco protested as he sat down after all. Harry unconsciously kept a grip on his arm. “The
Draco smiled at him. “Then please just leave me alone and let me get on with it. At this point, I'm almost certainly going to fail, but at least I'll know that I gave it my very best.”
Harry kissed his husband, holding his hand now that they were together. “Hunter did pretty well in the first exam. I'm probably going to give him an E.
This managed to cheer Harry up slightly. He smiled at Draco a bit wryly. “I suppose you would know...”
Lily1 giggled at the look on her husband's face. “I do believe she said that her father is our son.”
Long and surprisingly gentle fingers tickled Harry's tight pucker, making Harry jump from being startled. He also gasped out a protest, but it was incoherent and more of a grunt than an actual word.
Draco groaned as the hot splash on his hands triggered his own orgasm. The two of them leaned together while recovering for a few minutes. Then Harry suddenly pulled back and gave Draco a quick kiss.
Staying in front of them and threatening to kill Mundungus Fletcher the entire way – even after he popped up and then popped off to tell Dumbledore what had happened – she escorted them back to Number 4 Privet Drive. By that point, Harry was bursting with questions for her, but she ran off before he could ask them.
Official meetings were held frequently and all of the Malfoys – Lucius had been freed from prison as a reward for Draco's good service – felt like unwelcome guests in their own home. One meeting in particular, a little over halfway through July, upset Draco more than he cared to admit, although probably everyone already knew it.
JUST when it looked like another Slytherin was setting herself up to be right in the exit to summon the flag and win the challenge, Sai shouted out a summoning spell for his broom, jumped on it as it arrived, flew after the flag, grabbed it, cast an anti-summoning spell on it, and flew it out of the Maze.
Snape ignored him and cast a spell to grab Harry and levitate him over to the rack – and then secure him to it.
Pearl sighed and shook her head. “This is going to take a while, and we have no idea how long they'll be here for.”
“If I had one, yes!” Harry insisted, still glaring at Draco. “And YOU should stop acting like such a bloody prick! Or don't you realize that you just insulted the sort of people your fiancée comes from? How do you suppose she feels to hear what you think of them?”
But he didn't dare write because he couldn't guarantee that even at a time when Draco was likely in bed sleeping, he was alone and able to receive a message from Harry without being caught. He could only assume that Draco felt the same, for he never messaged either.
Which was how Harry found himself – at perhaps the late age of 21 – walking into a muggle club that catered to the LBGTQ crowd. He was looking for his first sexual encounter with a bloke and had no idea how to go about attracting one. His only real experience with sex was with Ginny and she hadn't needed any sort of chatting up. Basically, from the first moment he had kissed her, she was pretty much his.
Lucius and Narcissa were alerted when Draco came home, and after giving him a few minutes to rant, decided to pop into the Crystal Room and see if they could help solve whatever Draco was having a problem with.
Then it was Draco's turn: “Feels so good being bad, there's no way I'm turning back, now that pain is my pleasure, nothing can measure.”
With surprising gentleness, Snape scooped Draco into his arms and carefully carried him through the entrance door. The entrance must either recognize nonverbal passwords, or else the Head of House never needed to use one, since Snape had said nothing. Harry was disappointed because he was hoping to use the password to sneak in later on to check on (or perhaps spy on) Draco as necessary. Sighing in relief that Draco was being taken care of, Harry jogged back to Slughorn's party just long enough to find out that Hermione had already left.
Lucius held up a hand. “Not so fast. We've invited a guest, and unless he's even more atrocious than I think he is, he should be arriving any moment now.”
Draco didn't answer for a moment because he was too busy sucking on Harry's nipples to moans of encouragement. “Hmm? Oh, the writing squeezes itself close to my wrist so that I can read it.”
After that, Umbridge quite got into it. Using both hands, she wiggled her fingers everywhere, trying to find his most ticklish spots and make him squeal as loudly as possible. She tried under his chin, his armpits, his stomach, his sides, even his buttocks!
Draco licked the drop as requested, and then turned to smirk at Astoria's sister. “Does that mean you don't actually plan to marry him, Daphne?”
Still very confused, Draco found himself singing again. “It's no surprise to me I am my own worst enemy, 'cuz every now and then I kick the living shit out of me!” He blushed lightly and glanced over to the Head Table, hoping no one docked him points for lyrics that were beyond his control. “When you see my face, hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell, when you walk my way, hope it gives you hell, hope it gives you hell!”
Behind him, amidst peals of laughter, Draco emerged from the niche under an ugly dragon shaped vase. “Trip Jinx, Potter!”
Harry caressed his forearm tenderly before forcing himself to try to get some sleep. He needed it after all.
Amanda was obviously torn on how to react. She quickly set aside her misgivings (and the star-struck staring at Harry) and gave Draco a reassuring smile. “I know you meant no harm, luv. I remember how courteous you were to my parents when you met them.”
Both elves looked at him and Draco tangled up naked on the bed with an expression like this was the worst thing that could have possibly happened. That said, both promised to follow orders – Dobby genuinely sounded happy to be of service, but Kreacher was as gloomy as ever, probably only agreeing without protest because it meant being of service to Draco.
“Ah, well, good for you,” Draco replied, happy that she was happy. Then he gestured to the table. “Shall we be seated?”
And with that set, Draco spent the next five minutes using a special powder that covered his Dark Mark with a dragon tattoo that couldn't be simply wiped away. Nor could it be ended – like a glamour – with a Finite Incantatum. It could only be removed by a special remover, thus even if Harry tried to wash his arm (or they snuck off to the Prefect's bathroom for an interesting bath), the tattoo would remain.
Harry tilted his head to the side as he – usually not the most observant of blokes – couldn't help but notice that Draco had sang a variation of the same declaration of love. Could it be true???
“So... er, can any of you tell me why you come here to do these shots?” He asked. “I mean if you just want to get each other off, why not do so at one of your houses. Also, do you really
To help him get over his nerves, Ron ordered a couple rounds of Brewdog Punk IPA to work their way through until Harry gathered up his nerve. Harry was an Auror, for Merlin's sake! Being confident was literally in his job description!
Anthony Goldstein waved a hand as if he thought he was an expert on the subject. “A dare should never be anything YOU PERSONALLY do not want to do.”
The two of them were content to silently cuddle as they recovered from their glorious orgasms. Draco was holding Harry to him with his right arm, which he was laying on, and Harry absently ran his fingers up and down Draco's left arm. Suddenly, he noticed something that made him sit up rather abruptly.
Even more slowly, Harry felt a frown grow deeper across his face. Sure, this potentially COULD teach Draco an important lesson, but was it really right to just let some witch ruin his life like this for nothing more than a tiny bit of revenge over a slight?
It was at that moment that Snape burst onto the scene, and after a little pathetic begging from Dumbledore, simply cast the Unforgivable Killing Curse. He was so clearly in command (being the Dark Lord's favorite minion, more or less) that not even Greyback nor Dolohov tried to protest.
“Yeah?” Harry prompted, feeling profoundly relieved that Draco wasn't already tired of the fact that Harry hadn't even had time to shag him yet.
Draco rolled his eyes so hard that his head followed along. “Oh come now, I'm of age, surely even YOU aren't so old that you can't figure that out on your own.”
“Harry, I know you just stood up to go to the loo, but come sing your song first,” Luna half commanded half suggested in a dreamy tone.
Harry couldn't decide whether to chuckle or moan in pleasure. The tickling was simultaneously annoying and... good. He closed his eyes and surrendered to the feel of being shagged for the first time.
Blaise chuckled a little malevolently. “You and I both know that they love to hate each other, but they've been trying to leave each other alone this year. I think if they could just have a nice little battle, they'd feel so much better.”
Harry stared at the barren stone wall in indecision, wondering how to actually get Draco to his dorm without a valid password. A whispered “Pureblood” proved that the password had definitely changed since Second Year. Sighing, Harry paced back and forth in indecision. If there had been a portrait or statue guarding the entrance, he could have asked for help, but he doubted that the magical stone wall could respond to anything other than the password.
See, on the one hand, if it WAS Cedric and he KNEW that they could talk to each other via their arms, then why had he gone to the trouble of finding him and telling him IN PERSON about the egg? Also, since no one would know anyway, why wouldn't he just TELL him what the secret of the egg was?
Harry quickly moved on to assure everyone that he'd overpowered Draco weeks ago and was now using Draco's own wand, which somehow made him the true master of the Elder Wand.
Ernie Macmillan paled and shook a little as he stood up and walked over to Padma. Then he gave her something that looked a cross between a smile and a grimace. “Hi...” he greeted before leaning over and kissing her quite thoroughly.
Draco tilted his head to the side as he studied Harry's face. No matter how much he looked, Harry seemed serious. Intensely serious.
Chuckling, Harry set about licking just about every part of Draco's body. He eventually settled between Draco's legs so that he could rim him and work him open. Draco did his best to relax and simply enjoy the pleasure, but Harry soon made that impossible, making him thrash back and forth and
Draco gently forced Harry to turn his head to the side so that he had access to his neck. Once again using his tongue, he flicked a very light path all along where Harry's neck met his shoulder. When Draco unexpectedly latched on and sucked rather strongly, Harry didn't even care that Draco's other hand's fingers were now making a sort of light galloping motion on his belly. The tiny shocks of tickling – that normally made Harry shriek with laughter and try to get away – simply exacerbated that problem with his breathing. He moaned and it sounded... like he wanted more...
“Like the fact that I'm arse over tits in love with you,” Draco stated before he realized what he was saying, and then gasped as it hit him. Ready to murder himself, he stepped away so that he'd have room to Apparate.
It was confusing! On the one hand, there was nothing serious between them. It was just shagging. Harry always left in the morning – usually while Draco was still sleeping. Or more accurately, just waking up enough for a kiss and a mumbled word goodbye.
The very air itself seemed to thicken with anticipation, until finally, Draco moved into position on top of Harry. They moved together slowly for a long time, Draco sliding rather smoothly in and out of Harry even as Harry met him thrust for thrust. Neither were in a rush – perhaps because they knew their time together like this was quickly coming to an end. In practically no time at all, school would be over for the summer, and strangely both had this irrational fear that next year would not be so easy for them to meet as lovers.
Harry looked up and noticed Draco watching him. He smiled a little, reaching out and taking hold of Draco's hand. “This is really good! Thank you for feeding me; I hadn't had a chance to eat lunch and was bloody starving!”
Harry smirked at him. “I wish we had the time to practice these spells several,” but he didn't get to finish his sentence since Draco had grinned, chuckled, and pulled him close for a lingering kiss.
Anthony and Ernie both shrugged and decided to play while Michael Corner – the other Ravenclaw – declined. This left Nott and his fellow Slytherin undecided for a long moment before shaking their heads.
Draco waved that away. “That has nothing to do with you. I've just been busy trying to get my arse in better shape.”
Their kiss deepened and seemed like it was going to continue all day, except that Ron and Hermione walked past them, pulling Harry's mind out of the fog. Keeping his cloak over him, Harry pulled free from Draco and ran flat out so that he'd get to the Great Hall before his friends did.
“Maybe to a Slytherin, but I'm a Gryffindor, remember?” Harry reminded him before stealing a kiss while Draco's eyes were still closed.
Before Draco could do more than return the kiss and grope Harry's arse in appreciation, a blaring noise interrupted them.
When September passed and October was in bloom, the Vanishing Cabinet was proving to be so difficult to fix that Draco decided he had to give himself a break and try something else. So, he sent an owl to Borgin and Burkes ordering a cursed opal necklace. It was delivered to him at Hogsmeade and he promptly took it to the Three Broomsticks so that he could Imperius someone into delivering it for him.
Harry had just descended the last marble step into the entrance hall when Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle emerged from a door on the right that Harry knew led down to the Slytherin common room. Harry stopped dead; so did Draco and the others. For a few moments, the only sounds were the shouts, laughter, and splashes of students playing in the Black Lake drifting into the hall from the grounds through the open front doors.
With a sigh to exhale any negative emotions, Harry continued. “Since the majority of the other Professors are currently occupied giving their Final Exams, I've recruited a lot of your parents to help me monitor the Maze. That means that EVERYTHING will be watched and recorded. I strongly advise you to NOT do ANYTHING that your parents will punish you for – so, for example, DON'T punch or fight each other, and probably best not to try to sneak in a quick shag either.”
She growled at him softly. “If you think there are, you're imagining things!” Then she grabbed the comb and ran it through his hair a moment, muttering under her breath. “I should just get a shaver.”
Harry stopped just in front of the door to look back at him. “What would be the point? They're all hand me downs from my cousin, and so, WAY too big for me. They don't stay up and make me look like I'm wearing a diaper with the way they bunch up in my trousers.”
Pansy: “What are you waiting for? So love me like you do, love love me like you do, love me like you do, love love me like you do, touch me like you do, touch touch me like you do...” At this point, they were looking at each other and about to dance a simple yet sexy waltz. They sang the next line together: “What are you waiting for?!”
“First of all,” Blaise stated as he pulled Ron into the privacy of the alcove with him. “I'm not asking you to betray a trust, so just listen to what I have to say. If I'm right, there's a certain someone who's been a brooding and moody bastard all of Eighth Year. Someone who's thoroughly annoyed us all because he SHOULD be a smug and triumphant bastard, but he's not.”
Gryffindors!” She handed them each a flask as promised. “And sorry, but I have to supervise the transformation in case something goes wrong.”
Still extremely suspicious, Ron tilted his head to the side and peered at Blaise. “Yeah? What's that?”
“Oh, just that you haven't come over for poker, or shopping, or just to drink and chat since... hmm... the night I dared you to sing at the Leaky,” she pointed out.
Still... It seemed like this would be the perfect incentive for Harry to leave Draco alone. Draco covered his face with his pillow and pretended to be sleeping so that no one who came in to visit him would disturb him. Nor see the strange dampness on Draco's pillow.
Also every night for that week, at some point – usually right about 9 o'clock – Draco Malfoy would show up, scan the crowd (never seeming to notice Harry), and pick a target. It was never the same bloke twice, which angered Harry and he couldn't even understand why. Once a target was in sight, Draco walked up to that man and gave him a smoldering grin followed by a look of challenge, and without fail, that person would immediately follow him out of the club.
Sighing, Draco nearly decided to Apparate right back home, but since the Gryffindor table and the Slytherin table were on complete opposite sides of the pub, it wasn't a hardship to avoid Harry if he just stayed where they were.
“See as much as that does make sense, I'm actually rather surprised that you want to DATE me,” Harry stated. “If you said that you want to have me in every way possible, at your beck and call day and night, but otherwise I should stay out of your way and leave you alone – THAT I would believe. Dating me... You DO know that I'm hopeless at relationships, right?”
“Right. Blaise, I need you help with a fashion emergency,” Draco explained, rather than go on a tirade about their cheeky attitude.
This time, Draco took advantage of Harry's lethargy by pressing tiny kisses to his neck. Eventually, Harry moaned softly, pulling back just enough to give Draco some light kisses. Unfortunately, it was Draco who needed to rush off before he missed his official Prefect's curfew.
He stopped short in the classroom door and pulled his cloak off, panting heavily. Draco took one look at him and held out his arms. “What's wrong?”
To his disappointment, after about two minutes, rather than answers to his questions, all he got was an even bigger red octagon. Sighing, Draco decided to wait and try again tomorrow.
The voices hadn't penetrated the thick fog of lust until that point. Draco and Harry pulled back and whipped their heads to look at Draco's parents in apprehension – nearly terror on Draco's part.
“And if there's ANYONE other than Potter that can give it to you,” Lucius added, praying that he had someone in mind.
The good news was that when the article was published, Cho seemed to like him again. But judging by the dark look Draco gave him, the hate between them was back on again, and possibly even deeper than ever. Harry sighed a bit sadly, wondering if he was making the right choice.
After a quick kiss goodbye, Harry summoned all his belongings and held them in his arms as he snuck back to his dorm under his cloak. A glance back showed that Draco had managed to get his trousers back on and was working on the buttons of his shirt even as he deftly avoided catching Peeves' attention.
Ron ran a hand through his hair and blew out a sigh. “Yeah, she is pretty ride or die. She DID get us out of Gringott's by stealing a dragon. Hopefully getting an eyeful of some other naked woman's body won't upset her too bad.” At this point, he was trying to figure out how to hook up his bra, which thankfully had a front closure.
Harry got another good look at him. “What happened to you? You look like you just got dragged across the entire grounds of the castle.”
Elated, Harry threw his arms around Draco and gave him a rather passionate kiss. More than willing to take advantage of Harry's goodwill, Draco grabbed Harry's hips and held him close as their snogging rapidly lit a fire in both of them. Both had too much pride to admit it, but they had missed this; this tenderness they could only show each other when no one else was looking.
“And I just – look, if I didn't say anything at all, you'd never even know, but... I... I WANT you to know that I'm trying here, that I'll be up front with you and so you can trust me.”
Harry frowned. “I have no idea why, but all of the other students seem to be looking towards our kids to lead them – no matter the House. It's a bit frustrating as it makes me wonder if they think that only our kids have a chance of winning this challenge. Also, it sort of makes me feel like none of the other students are benefiting from this exam.”
One day, something happened that made Harry sigh in relief. In class, they read a story about a pair of boy girl twins meeting an imaginary friend and going with him into an imaginary world that was full of adventures.
Draco tried to leap to his mother's defense, but ended up tripping over the overly long unhemmed robe he was having fitted, which made the weasel laugh much louder than necessary. “Don't you talk to my mother like that, Potter!”
Harry sighed in frustration, running a hand through his hair, highly tempted to just yank it all out. “Look, I don't think you should be alone at the moment, so even though my flat is tiny – probably cramped compared to what you're used to – I'm going to tuck you into my bed and let you sleep until you're feeling better. I'll hex you to sleep if I have to!”
That night, Draco fell into his bed in exhaustion. He wanted nothing more than to pass out and never wake up. To his surprise, there was a very faint tickling on his arm.
This left four Ravenclaws, four Slytherins, Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Ernie Macmillan on their own. Ron was the last to get his potion to the brewing stage, and when he did, Terry boot smirked at him from the Ravenclaw table.
Utterly relieved, Narcissa turned the conversation to other things to occupy the time until dinner. After a mere half an hour, it came out that Narcissa not only loved to garden (which Harry dabbled with a little whenever Neville stopped by for a visit), but that she knew a bit about making pottery.
It was Draco. He wanted Draco's arms around him. He wanted the simple and platonic cuddling they'd almost never had a chance to do. More, he wanted Draco inside him making him feel bliss.
Hermione glared and growled at him. “If you DID dare that, YOU'D get expelled when the person completing the dare is brought in and forced to confess to why he or she broke so may rules so egregiously!”
“Been here long, Potter?” Draco asked as he blatantly stole Harry's ale and downed at least half of it in one gulp.
She pulled open one of his eyelids, then slid her hand inside his shirt to check his heartbeat. Finding a fairly rapid one, she very quietly asked directly in his ear: “Is Draco alive? Is he in the castle?”
They ate their breakfast and drank their tea, not saying much of anything until Harry had to rush off to his Auror training. Harry gave him a quick kiss before running toward the floo.
Harry hummed and purred as his breathing slowly calmed down. He also stroked Draco's spine up and down, loving how silky that creamy skin felt. He eventually had an urge to kiss Draco again, but the only thing he could reach at the moment was his shoulder.
Ron didn't have a chance to find out because Draco was finally done flirting his way onto the stage, and the music was starting for his song. All of his friends basically stopped paying attention to anything else.
Draco smirked. “Just enough time to get dressed and have a cup of tea.” But the elves returned just then and it was apparent that they both assumed that tea meant a full service – which amounted to a small breakfast with not just tea, but also croissants with butter and a variety of jams.
“He was just humoring me,” he told himself firmly. Why else would they do nothing but kiss? If Harry had seriously wanted to claim him, they'd have shagged until they passed out.
About halfway through the dance, the Entertainer jumped up and wrapped her legs around Draco's waist so that she could lean back and really grind into him. After a few seconds, he pulled her up into his chest and gave her a kiss that immediately made Harry see red.
That night, Harry took off his shirt – since it was hot and stuffy in his cupboard anyway – and stared at his arm as he waited for his imaginary friend to say something.
Daisy nodded and pointed at her dad's name. “Yep, my dad's Dudley, Harry's cousin, making you my Great Aunt.”
Except this time, he was just a bit cranky from his Mark hurting, and Madam Malkin kept unknowingly pricking his Mark with her pins. “Watch where you're sticking that pin, will you?!” He yelled after the third time, immediately walking over to a full length mirror simply to get out of her grasp.
Narcissa pulled him into a tight hug. “Oh love. I want you to know I'll support you no matter what, but perhaps you should spend some time thinking about what it is you actually want.”
Harry gasped in shock when Draco replaced his fingers with his tongue. He licked a path from Harry's bellybutton on up to his left nipple. The motion of his tongue was fluttery light and left a faint, moist trail that Draco gently blew on.
As Theo sang, a man – THE man – emerged from a back room holding up a large bottle of potion for everyone to see. He poured some into six smaller bottles so that six gorgeous women could walk around The Club and sell drops to anyone that wanted some.
But Draco didn't even hear him. He was currently so preoccupied that he went straight into the shower for his dorm and turned it on until it was two degrees short of scalding. Then he stood there – fully dressed in his pajamas – letting the soothing hot water rain down on him.
Draco smirked at him devilishly. “If you insist.” He proved he was serious by casting all the necessary spells to be absolutely sure that Harry wouldn't be hurt. He sank into Harry with a blissful sigh.
“Why am I so emotional? This is not a good look, gain some self control! And deep down, I know this never works, but you can lay with me so it doesn't hurt.”
Even better, when he was done and back in his rather messy room, it was to find his mattress flipped over – the strong smell of cleaner suggesting it had been washed first – and was now covered in crisp and fresh smelling sheets. Sighing in relief, Harry climbed into bed and... obsessed over why in the bloody hell his friends were ignoring him.
Harry looked up slightly to see her holding out a comb in her left hand even as the scissors in her right hand were open and ready to cut. He reached up and grabbed the comb, holding it up like she ordered. About two minutes later, something caught his eye, making him stare as words formed on his arm. Despite pausing for a moment to move which strands were being cut, his Aunt said and did nothing to indicate that she saw them.
hit the floor, let the bodies hit the floor, let the bodies hit the floor, let the bodies hit the –” He pointed at the woman in charge of the Karaoke machine. The chosen song was started which made a distinctive tinging from the symbols of a drum set ring out twice. “FLOOOOORRR!!!!”
Sighing in defeat, Harry wondered if he could get away with punching Draco (or maybe just slapping him) every time he acted up in public. AND THEN making it up to him by snogging the bloody daylights out of him. Rather than say anything, he simply grabbed Draco and stole a demanding kiss.
Sounds indicated that people were now fighting on the actual stairway, thus getting closer than ever.
Harry had no idea why he was so chuffed to hear that. He could only assume that if he HAD to do something like this, he'd hate to be terrible at it. That would just make the mortification all the worse when he was done and Draco strutted out of the room to complain that not only had Harry molested and mouth raped him, but that he was so bad at it that Draco couldn't even enjoy it. Or something like that.
In fact, Draco seemed to be fading rather quickly now. Nearly panicking, Harry summoned a bezoar and filled the time it took to come flying to him by casting spells to deal with the drugs and alcohol. For a few seconds after the bezoar was shoved in his mouth, Harry was certain that it wasn't working, and then Draco's eyes cleared up and he seemed lucid.
When Harry was laying face down on the ground after surrendering himself to Voldemort and being hit with the Unforgivable Killing Curse... After going to a sort of limbo and having a shockingly forthcoming conversation with Dumbledore, he cracked his eyes open ever so slightly to see Narcissa bending down over him to see if he was dead.
Remus looked at his dad and scratched an itch on his cheek. “Erm, well...” He pointed back and forth between his sister and himself. “As Hufflepuff Prefects, we ALSO have permanent permission on file to access the restricted section as much as we want.”
Draco Apparated directly to the Crystal Room in Malfoy Manor so that he could take his anger out on every shard of crystal there. He roared and shattered things by hand – by throwing them – and also by casting spells to blast or otherwise destroy things. All the while, he muttered things like: “How dare that Harry buggering Potter!”
Honestly, that was not so surprising since Hufflepuffs were excellent finders. The problem came about when Hunter and the Ravenclaws made it to the center of the Maze, realized that the flag wasn't there, and did their absolute best to steal it from Hufflepuff. The other two Houses weren't far behind.
After that, neither of them wrote again for a long time. The next time words appeared – after Easter break and nearing the end of the year – Harry felt a chill down to his bone.
Draco smiled at him softly. “Glad I could help, and actually, I feel like you've made a good start on apologizing to me for my dad.”
Sure enough, the article was accompanied by a picture of Harry and Parvati looking at each other like they knew a happy secret which slowly changed to them kissing. The kiss started out chaste enough, but quickly grew heated until they were clinging to each other and giving it their all. For some reason, this picture turned red, which made Draco realize that the entire room had gone red.
That said, lots of magic produced green light in various shades, so just seeing the color wasn't necessarily an indication of what spell it was, but still, one would be motivated to avoid it.
Ron quickly cast the spell to negate the urge to tickle Harry. “Sorry there, Seamus. Didn't expect anyone else to be in here yet, or I'd have come out first and spelled everyone.”
That same thing that made Harry's brain go offline whenever he saw Draco took over, making him grab the Slytherin prat and pull him close for a demanding kiss. Relieved, Draco pushed Harry into the nearest stall, giving them a bit of privacy should any other boys happen to come into the bathroom. After that, they snogged for so long that they probably missed a class. Harry could only pray that it wasn't Umbridge's – who would give him detention even if he claimed to be laying on the bathroom floor vomiting up his guts.
oooo ooo oooo ooo, Breathe it in and breathe it out and pass it on, it's almost out. We're sooo creative so much more, we're high above but on the floor, it's not a habit it's cool, I feel alive if you don't have it you're on the other siiide.” – Harry and Ron wandered over to the group that was clearly taking a break from dancing in order to do a bunch of potion drops.
“Well now, Astoria, you seem to be getting into the spirit of things for your first time here,” Draco drawled with a smoky grin as he gestured for a gorgeous woman with long and riotously curly black hair to administer the drop.
He was so mad at Draco again that he sought him out as soon as possible – once again after Curfew and under his cloak. This time Draco wasn't quite so scared to be yanked off his feet and thrown into an empty classroom.
Harry stared at his arm with a frown. He couldn't recall the last time his imaginary friend even wrote to him. Did he FINALLY grow up enough to stop having an imaginary friend?
Already gasping and trying to escape, Harry was grateful that Hedwig swooped over and drove them away before landing on his shoulder. Finally – FINALLY – it was time to vent his anger! He yelled and shouted at them so much that they wouldn't quite look at him, and also seemed to lose all desire to tickle him. Which made Hermione remember that Madam Pomfrey had taught her the spell to curb the effects of the curse on them. She also made a mental note to cast it on everyone in Grimmauld place.
For some reason, a good look at his hands made Draco smirk in amusement. “So... what you're saying is that you
Narcissa laughed softly. “Your father purposely wrote the time on the invitation for ten minutes earlier than intended, so that our guest would hopefully be on time.”
It's alright, Draco,” Snape assured him, lowering his wand. “Potter is here for a little Remedial Potions.”
Harry grinned at him. “On it!” They might well have succumbed to the urge to kiss had Ron not made a loud noise of confusion followed by nearby yells and shouts as a duel emerged from down the corridor.
“Feels like you're makin' a mess! You're hell on wheels in a black vest... you drove me to the fire... and left me there to burn... every little thing you do is tragic, all my life, oh was magic, beautiful boy, I can't breathe, I got a disease, deep inside me, makes me, feel uneasy baby, I can't live without you, tell me what am I supposed to do about it? Keep your distance from me, don't pay no attention to me, I got a disease, and well I think that I'm sick, but leave me be while my world is coming down on me, you taste like honey, Honey, tell me can I be your honey? Be, be strong, keep telling myself that it won't take long 'til, I'm free of my disease...”
Narcissa looked perilously close to tears as she swept Draco's normally gorgeous but currently matted hair out of his face. “Oh Draco...” she whispered emotionally.
Imagining the look on his father's face made Draco happy enough to cast the Patronus that Harry had been trying to teach him. He was delighted to see that it was a dragon. Being a Patronus that represented some aspect of him, it was only about the size of a Manta Ray, but that was fine by Draco. Perfect in fact.
“I look like you!” Harry blurted out in bafflement, scratching his head. “Aren't I SUPPOSED to look like someone no one knows?”
Rather abruptly, Harry pushed Draco's jacket and shirt to the floor and shifted to circle his left nipple with his tongue. Draco gasped in surprise at how good that felt and tangled his fingers in Harry's hair.
Harry stopped listening again, since it sounded like she was going to go on and on for quite some time. So... maybe his friend wasn't so imaginary after all.
Blaise finally managed to get some of the men to take a turn. To be honest, it didn't matter how straight a bloke was, Blaise could talk just about everyone into just about everything. Thus – after a good two hours – nearly everyone had had a turn.
Harry did not need telling twice. He grabbed Draco's hand and dragged him out to find a bit of privacy. Thankfully, Crabbe and Goyle were already sent off by McGonagall to bring her stuff to her office. Thus, when they reached the Forbidden Forest, Harry only looked around enough to make sure that no one else was looked ready to follow them. Despite being watched curiously, no one dared come close enough to the Forbidden Forest to see what they were up to.
“Yeah, and even though I'm not under the influence of Veritaserum, I hope you understand that I'm not lying,” Harry said before taking a swig of his Brewdog IPA. “I reckon I just spent so many years dwelling on you that I noticed that you didn't really want Voldemort to win the war, and once I realized that, I could see so clearly that you were trapped in a horrible situation. To this day, I'm obsessed with knowing whether you're doing better and wondering if you found happiness.”
Unfortunately, Draco remembered that their OWLs were right around the corner, and that he really needed to study a bit more before bed. So, he slipped out of Harry, strangely reluctant to do so, despite having gone at least half soft already. Then he sat back on his knees and took a good look at Harry.
Draco was normally very well mannered at dinner, but he was so flustered by Harry's unexpected presence that he couldn't restrain himself for long. Narcissa barely had a chance to finish her introductions – “I'm certain I have no need to introduce our son to you, since you were in the same year, but allow me to introduce his bride-to-be Amanda.” – before Draco was blurting out: “Why in the bloody hell is
Harry obeyed, hoping that he would be told to go back to his dorm. Upon inspection, Umbridge looked a little disappointed. “Barely made an impression. No matter...”
Draco nodded rather fervently in agreement. Harry considered pulling Draco's legs off him and changing positions anyway, just to be a shit. Also, to see what Draco would do while tied up and helpless. Shout and snarl, probably, which could be highly entertaining.
All the anger that Draco'd still had inside him even a moment ago died completely. “Erm... Is that a proposal?”
“Alright, as you were told, you're doing a special training mission,” Ginger began. “It's NOT intended to turn into any sort of dramatic wand fight or sting operation. Hell! We're probably not even going to make any arrests. All we're doing is gathering information. See, there's a place in Knockturn Alley that sells a particular potion. We're not certain if it should be illegal or not. As far as we can tell, it's just a weak lust potion, and everyone in the place is theoretically consenting, so all we really need to determine is if anyone is given this potion against their will – like it gets slipped in their drink or something – OR if the effects are so much stronger than we've heard that it's definitely illegal. And also, see this picture?”
When he woke up in the morning, he was free from the alcohol AND the Veritaserum, wearing only his pants while Harry clutched him like a teddybear in his sleep. For a good two full minutes, Draco was happier than he'd ever been in his life, but then reality reinserted itself.
Harry was giving Hermione a pleading look, but she could only shrug as she had no idea how to stop things – having already tried a couple of spells to end active magic, which failed.
Draco was silent as he thought this over for a few long minutes. Eventually he sighed. “Look, you know everything now – everything related to my feelings for you anyway. It's not like I can make the things I said not true. So really, it's not ME that has to make any sort of decision. Either date me, or let me go home.”
Pansy joined him for a little dance during the pause in the singing. Then waited so she could dance with him again during then next – longer – break.
The ale flashed white gold for a split second, and Harry pinched his chin and squinted his eyes in thought as he tried to remember which potion was indicated by white gold...
But Harry didn't back down and Narcissa smiled unpleasantly at him. “I see that being Dumbledore's favorite has given you a false sense of security, Harry Potter. But Dumbledore won't always be there to protect you.”
“Ah, I see,” Ginger murmured. “In any case, warning, the hairs really were collected from random muggles, and so – aside from the fact that they were verified to be human – I have no idea who you'll become or what you'll look like.”
Happily enough, shopping with his mother was always a good experience. She had been raised in a wealthy family just like his father had, and so they were both of the opinion that Draco could have pretty much anything he wanted – with only a few exceptions. So even though they had given him his own vault, when she took him shopping, all he had to do was say he wanted something, and she would buy it for him. All in all, it was rather satisfying.
Then he tilted his head toward the trays that had been set on separate desks. Grabbing his wand, he magicked the desks so that they were right next to each other. The boys sat and busied themselves eating and just basically enjoying the quiet time together.
“Oi, Weasley, look what I have!” He held up a packet containing several slips of paper. The packet was labeled Magical Dares.
to be sung, Draco clearly did not give a fuck as he sang it – to the actual music with no changes – in an almost operatic tone of voice. A male opera singer, meaning not a soprano or even a mezzo, but not quite a full tenor either. Harry wasn't sure what the range he was singing in was called, but it was bloody fucking
When they were done with their showers, they wrapped towels around their waists and left the bathroom in a quest to get their pajamas on. Unfortunately, as they emerged from the bathroom attached to the dorm, Seamus was just about to enter it. As a result, he literally bumped into Harry and stumbled back a few steps. His face was already wearing a look that suggested he was wondering where to tickle Harry first, and his hand was already reaching out to do so.
Draco gave him a look of profound sadness. “I'm so sorry about that. I was desperate and felt like I was running out of options. Hurting you at that point in time could have helped my parents...”
Draco hadn't relished the idea of entering the Forbidden Forest without some guarantee of safety, but since they weren't too far in and it was unlikely that anything that lived in the forest would come this close to the castle, he looked around and decided that the place would work just fine. Especially if fixed up a bit. He transfigured the grass and leaves into a large plush cushion for them to lay on.
Those he set to float around the room at equal distances from each other. Lastly, he cast a spell on all of them that would also 'pipe' the music from his magi-laptop. Ready in a surprisingly short amount of time, Blaise took a few minutes to explain the concept to the curious crowd.
“Blimey! Is this REALLY all there is to this shirt?!” Ron asked in dismay as he realized that his scanty shirt didn't really cover much of anything.
Lucius searched her eyes for answers and she smiled at him. Smiling very faintly in return, he patted Draco – who was currently resting his head on Harry's shoulder – on the back. “I had no idea, son. Congratulations.”
Sighing, Draco finally admitted to himself that he was too scared to think about what it might mean if they DID get into a relationship, so, he got dressed and Apparated home long before Harry got off work. Then he spent nearly the entire next month hiding in his room playing his piano and singing and dancing as much as he liked.
Grinning at her, Draco lifted her onto her feet and smacked her arse. “Now go the bloody hell away and attempt to dance with those wobbly legs!”
Draco felt betrayed! Just moments before, he'd pulled Vince out of the way of a stunning spell. And yet, Vince ran off and left both him and an unconscious Greg to fend for themselves. He did his best to pull Greg to safety, but there was NO safety!
Harry chuckled as he finished up the explanation. “We're going to do this in two distinct stages. The first stage will be the Fourth Years. They'll be able to work their way through the Maze at their own pace, and once a team has successfully brought me the flag, a few things will be added to bring the Challenge up the the Sixth Years level, not to mention, the Flag will be reexamined for tampering and placed back in the center of the Maze. Any questions?”
Harry was furious again! Every time he flew past Draco, Draco was singing the stupid song that went with the badge: “Weasley was born in a bin, he always lets the Quaffle in, that's why Slytherins all sing, Weasley is our King!”
Draco pressed his lips together and tried to resist the potion urging him to blurt out the truth. He even closed his eyes so that the truth couldn't be read in them.
Harry, grasping his wand desperately, rolled onto his back so that he could try to expel Voldemort's wand from his hand – and thereby end the tickling. Weirdly, in addition to using his wand to tickle Harry, Voldemort was now also using the toes of his bare foot.
It didn't take long for them to reach their climax. Draco was so pent up that he went first, and that sudden hot addition to their lubrication made Harry shiver in bliss, and then pump out what felt like an ocean. Sighing in a mixture of relief and happiness, the two gave each other a couple more small kisses before curling up and falling asleep.
Wormtail released Harry, who wobbled unsteadily on his injured leg even as the Death Eaters closed in so that he couldn't escape. By this point, Voldemort had actually turned to look around his circle again, scrutinizing his Death Eaters before turning to face Harry once more. As he did, he spoke: “You have been taught how to duel, Harry Potter?”
When they were done and had collapsed into a pile of boneless meat, Draco took the opportunity to snuggle with Harry. He held him close and stroked a hand up and down Harry's arm. He even hummed very very softly.
Thus, he was utterly grateful to Hermione for having an alarm charm set to go off every hour so that she could pop in from her Prefect duties in order to keep him nice and fuzzy looking. All in all, things were going well, even though Ron gad to cast spells on himself and the other boys in the dorm each morning to curb the urge to tickle him – at least until Harry got dressed and Hermione was able to spell him again.
On the one hand, Draco may have tried to subtly help Harry by letting the others escape, but on the other hand...
Harry nodded, feeling that since Draco had been forced to admit to a few truths he really didn't want to, it was only fair to admit to a few of his own. “Yeah, over a year, and there never really was a lot to begin with.”
It was now May! If he didn't do the job soon, he wouldn't JUST vex the Dark Lord, he'd literally run out of time! In all possible ways!
This unsurprisingly provoked a loud cheer that circled around the place at least twice before dying down. As the waitresses were busy grabbing bottles and glasses for everyone, a woman whose job was to entertain the guests got up on the bar and grabbed all their attention by swaying her body suggestively.
Harry was awkward and sheepish, rubbing the back of his neck. “Er... I might have, it's just that I don't have enough time to answer all of my fan mail. I get so much of it that I have a hard time
Beyond desperate, and now laughing so hard that he was coughing – a sort of hack up his lungs cough – Harry took a deep breath and shouted “EXPELLIARMUS!!!”
“Yeah alright,” Harry agreed, sort of thankful that he wouldn't have to immediately tell everyone should his dare happen to be something like: grope the arse of the person on your left. He could just do it and get it over with, and then apologize profusely. He stuck his hand in the cauldron and swirled it around a few times. One slip seemed to stick to his hand, practically refusing to be let go of, so Harry shrugged and pulled it out of the cauldron.
Draco squinted and wracked his brains to see if he could figure out WHO was usually so habitually late that they counted on it. Before he could come up with an answer, an elf popped into the room with the LAST person he would have ever expected.
Lucius did not appreciate that and gave him a look clearly stating as much. “Fine. Setting that aside, this is THAT POTTER BRAT that we're talking about. Why in the bloody hell would you make any sort of commitment to him???”
Harry certainly couldn't argue that at the moment. Draco gave him a quick smooch. Then he frowned a bit.
The two of them danced for a couple of hours before helping each other pick out and put on the perfect clothes. Once ready – and looking rather a lot like high class fashion models – they Apparated to the Leaky Cauldron.
Instead, he was bent over a sink, wondering whether he'd actually vomit. Worse, he was once again crying pathetically in front of the ghost girl – just because she was sympathetic. Even so, she wasn't the best at comfort.
Harry closed his eyes and raised up just a little to meet Draco for a soft kiss that got fairly possessive rather quickly. As they kissed, a flash of light burst from Harry that swirled around them for a dozen seconds before zooming up into the air and vanishing.
Harry inhaled a gasp of shock as he received his very first kiss. Not knowing what to do, he closed his eyes and gently placed his hands on Draco's chest. He had no experience to compare it to, but this kiss was... powerful! Almost electric. Moaning, he opened his mouth.
warned Harry that no matter how into it he got, he wouldn't be going home with anyone else. Thus, trying not to look like he was going to murder everyone in The Club, he watched as Draco unzipped his sexy as fuck, tight and shiny black leather trousers. Those long fingers folded the flaps back to give clear access to the agreed upon part, but was careful not to show anything he didn't want touched or licked.
After making several more pots, he had enough to fire – once the clay had a bit of time to dry so that the moisture didn't cause cracking. Calling it a day, Harry went to the kitchen, absently scratching his bum as he went, not noticing that he left a clay smudge on his naked flesh. In his kitchen, he just barely remembered to wash his hands before frying up a simple dish of potatoes, sausage, and eggs.
Thus, Harry kissed Draco. It was a soft kiss with no expectations. At first, Draco seemed to sort of pause – as if he was not entirely sure if it was actually happening or not. Then he made a sound of disbelief and pulled back so slightly that their lips didn't even separate. Next, he tilted his head in curiosity, making a speculative noise. Finally, he softened his mouth and leaned forward just enough to make it clear he was returning the kiss.
Harry stared them all down seriously for a long moment. “I am well aware that as your Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, I have taught you all a LOT of unpleasant spells. For example, I've taught you what the Unforgivable Killing Curse is. Just because I've taught you what it is, DOESN'T mean that it's acceptable to use it in this exam. Don't even joke about it!”
A woman was now standing in front of Draco. She was topless and wearing a ruffly blue skirt that reached her knees. She gave Draco a flirty grin.
Draco rolled his eyes. “Because you did a rather shoddy job and the upholstery from the chair you used is still clearly visible in random places.”
Suddenly, Draco Malfoy stood up, looking rather confused, but unable to stop himself from standing on the Slytherin table. A moment later, Harry Potter did the same, standing on the Gryffindor table and looking extremely baffled.
Lucius smirked mischievously at his son. “It's simple, really. Mr. Potter will be given a small vault – as you were – and added to the list of Malfoy Heirs. In 60 or 80 years when the time comes for me to pass on, he'll be entitled to the younger Heir's portion of our fortune, with the larger part going to you. And if you should happen to have no Heirs of your own, he and his Heirs will be the next in line to receive your portion.”
The next song was sung by all the girls from Slytherin currently in the pub. It was in a different language except for the repeated title lyric:
But as he sat here, he realized that he didn't want to do that. If Harry won, he wanted to be a part of it, no matter how small. Even just a bystander. On the other hand, if the Dark Lord won, he could claim that he'd been in the castle trying his best to capture Harry, and Greg would be able to verify that they had indeed stayed behind to do just that. No one would need to know that he had changed his allegiance so completely.
Sighing, he stood up and walked out of his room. He knew that Harry would leave while he was gone, probably with a note wondering why Draco hadn't woken him up and kissed him goodbye before leaving his room to do whatever. But the truth was that Draco didn't want to wake Harry up nor be there when he left.
They were barely three steps into The Club when Harry gasped in shock. He and Ron were looking around with wide eyes.
Draco instinctively tried to hide his arm from view, but instantly realized that the action itself basically shouted that it was true. With a sigh, he gave in and held his arm out for Harry to see. Harry unexpectedly sat down (collapsed?) with a sigh.
Ron sighed wearily. “Don't laugh... It's stupid really, but... I was trying to practice for the Keeper tryouts. There! Go on, laugh!”
Harry was hesitant to accept a kiss considering where Draco's mouth just was, but when there didn't seem to be a weird taste, gave in. He relaxed for about half a second before he realized that Draco was now pressing into him very intimately.
The man got defensive but tried to act like nothing was wrong. “Just giving a Death Eater things to celebrate getting off scot free.”
feeling. I actually recommend taking 10 drops. That's just enough to give you a pleasantly fuzzy horniness that you can enjoy without wanting to shag every person in this Club.”
Draco looked over his shoulder at Harry with a dark glare. “I'd rather murder myself than be a werewolf!”
He raised his wand to cast a Finite Incantatum, only for there to come a loud bang as the door that to his office had burst open to reveal Draco Malfoy rushing in. He stopped short, his sentence cutting itself off in surprise and shock.
Rose sighed and rubbed her temples, feeling that it didn't matter what she thought since she was clearly in the minority and would lose a vote anyway. “Fine... If we're going to do this, then let's do this.”
“Who said it wasn't love?” An unexpected voice startled him so much that he dropped his favorite guitar.
Harry was concerned. Normally when he was in the Leaky, he was the center of attention. People would near hound him until he shook their hands and let them thank him. He had more or less gotten used to it, even though he really didn't like it.
Draco laughed softly. “No. I already told you, Potter, that most of this has been in my wank bank for a while. I just... I don't think I would have ever seriously thought about giving it a go had your curse not made the impulse impossible to resist.”
Harry beckoned a beautiful blonde woman over. “My, erm, girlfriend and I have never been here before. What's this potion and how much does it cost?”
The door opened, prompting Narcissa to sit up and glamour them both perfect as Pansy rushed across the ward towards them. “Oh Draco!” She cried as she flung her arms around him. “When I heard what happened! That bloody arsehole! Do you know what his punishment is? It's nothing! A slap on the wrist! He has detention with Professor Snape until the end of the year! Of all the–”
it was all this licking that got people horny and ready to shag each other within an inch of their lives.
Draco did not know how to take this news, looking baffled and – to Harry's extreme dislike – seemed to be on the verge of asking if he could help.
“Exactly. What I really need your help with is TOMORROW night. I'm going to be spending the night somewhere and I need to find something to wear that says: I'm from a good family and worth your attention and respect, but please bloody shag me!”
Laughing, and promising not to tattle on James2 to Draco for swearing, Prongs, Padfoot, and Moony answered that question with every detail. Teddy and a couple of the others were ALSO listening in intently, all of them lamenting the fact that they had promised not to pull any more pranks.
Chuckling, Ron continued. “Whereas that man over there is being very friendly and flirting with everyone.”
Harry growled in frustration. The words had originally started by appearing at random when he couldn't even read them, but now they appeared every night without fail. He'd copied them down once to ask his teacher what they said, and she had smiled and told him: “Hello, anyone there?”
“Nobody's wearing much...” Ron whispered. To be honest, he was the youngest of so many sons that he'd seen more than his fair share of male nudity. Thus that didn't really bother him, it's just that he wasn't sure if he had what it took to fit in with this crowd.
When they were getting ready to leave the train, Greg pulled down his trunk to get his robes, and Draco thought he heard a gasp of pain from the rack. It seemed Harry really did sneak into their compartment. When everyone else was leaving, he told Pansy (who was trying to wait for him) to leave too because he needed to check something. Then he shut the curtain on the door window and made a show of looking through his trunk.
Draco rubbed the back of his neck and looked away, suddenly feeling extremely guilty. “That's not, erm...” He cleared his throat. “Well, I think I should probably go reassure Potter before he comes here to make a scene.”
Still, it was vastly better than being the Dark Lord's top enforcer. Or maybe personal enforcer since the technical top enforcer was frequently sent out to enforce things on the public in general. Draco was doubly glad since Bellatrix had somehow wormed her way into their Lord's good graces and was nauseatingly his lover... and there had been hints that someone as young and practically still innocent as Draco would make a good toy for their amusement.
Harry laughed and gave his husband a kiss. “Oh no! That's the bare minimum requirement to PASS the test. They have to do a hell of a lot more to impress me to get an E or an O.”
Dumbledore was occasionally sliding bit by bit down the wall he was leaning against. “As a matter of fact, I did,” he said. “I was sure it was you.”
“I just knew, Pansy luv, that you'd bet or dare or otherwise coerce me onto stage at some point so that I could sing one of your insipid love songs, so I decided to be proactive and get on the list before you could try anything.”
Draco looked down, pinching his chin as he thought this over. Somewhere in the back of his mind, he wondered why he couldn't remember meeting his fiancée before he proposed to her. Surely if he had such strong feeling for her, he'd remember at least seeing her around the castle.
Ron shook his head in amusement, but otherwise left him to sleep. In fact, Ron had more important things to focus on now that he was going home to his girlfriend.
He furtively rushed to Knockturn Alley, looking over his shoulder several times to make sure his mother wasn't following him. Thankfully, he made it to Borgin and Burkes without his mother catching him. Mr. Borgin wasn't exactly happy to see him, but since Draco's family had spent a lot in his shop, he did his best to seem eager to help.
She tilted her head side to side to admit that he had a point, let out a delicate sigh, and dropped the subject by taking a sip of her wine.
Draco sat watching the lake with everyone else. This part was actually pretty boring. That said, the people in charge of the event FINALLY got around to telling everyone what was going on. It seems that each Champion had someone important to them – apparently their MOST important person – taken hostage. Their task was simple: rescue the person before time ran out.
Draco cautiously took a good look around his room in case a fellow Death Eater – or his Aunt – was sitting in a chair waiting for him to return. Seeing no one, and now suffering from paranoia that someone was lurking in his room under a Disillusion Charm, Draco relaxed just enough to summon his self inking quill.
Several minutes passed like this before Harry pulled back just enough to kiss Draco. That kiss led to another, which led to another, until they were laying on the plush cushions, completely naked and stroking each other everywhere. Draco took a long time working Harry open, his hands doing a thorough job even as they both kept on kissing.

The Dark Lord arrived and was NOT happy to find that they'd HAD Harry Potter, but that he'd once again escaped. Everyone in the room except for Bellatrix by sheer grace of being pregnant with the Dark Lord's child was subjected to a few moments of sizzling hot torture. The good news, in Draco's opinion, was that Greyback was included in this fierce displeasure, and thus, was not given Draco as had been promised should he need punishing.
Harry harrumphed and turned his attention back to Narcissa. “So what's all this rot the invitation is going on about?”
That said, Vince had gotten too big for his britches – in a manner of speaking – and tried to take control and kill the entire Golden Trio. It was all Draco could do to remind him that Harry was not to be killed by ANYONE but their Lord. But it seemed like Vince had gone mad with the prospect of power and rewards, because he kept trying to kill until he cast of an out of control Fiendfyre Curse.
“Alright, as you heard, the rules state that I may place the drop anywhere on your lover's body so that you can lick it off them. You COULD just have it dropped into your mouth, but in order to avoid the risk of any sort of cross contamination, we have to administer the drop far enough above your mouth that the dropper never even gets close. IF the drop of potion should happen to miss, you still have to pay and we DON'T replace it. With that in mind,
Snape sighed unhappily, slowly turning to look back at Harry. “Very well, very well – Potter, we shall resume this lesson tomorrow evening instead.”
After that, Draco decided that with how little the two of them stopped being mad at each other long enough to get together (mostly Harry), he'd be a little bolder than he probably would have been otherwise. He distracted Harry with kisses as his fingers unbuttoned Harry's shirt. When it was halfway open, Draco shifted to kiss a path down Harry's chest. Actually, he took the time to suck a bunch of little bruises all over Harry's chest – in places that wouldn't be seen when he was dressed.
“Blimey mate, you're that famous bloke!” Ron blurted out, and then frowned when it occurred to him that his voice sounded very wrong. Both of them jumped to their feet and practically leapt on the counter in their haste to see what they looked like. “I'M A BLOODY GIRL!!!”
“Technically, we met in Hogwarts,” Amanda answered with a sweet smile. “I was a year above the two of you, in Ravenclaw. We'd actually studied as a group on occasion.”
Harry was impressed even as he was dismayed that – once again – the flag was brought to him via a determined student working alone – as opposed to as a team. That said, the rest of the Gryffindors HAD tackled as many other students as they could so that none of them could intercept or impede Sai. So... mission accomplished?
“Then fucking MARRY ME!!!” Harry roared angrily. “As THAT'S the only way I'm ever going to be any happier than I already am right now!”
Draco immediately forgot everything, including his well-reasoned argument about them not being the type who kissed except for occasionally when caught up in shagging. Instead, he wrapped his arms around Harry and gave the kiss his all. It very quickly approached the urge to throw each other to the floor and shag each other dirty rotten.
“Er, thanks,” Draco mumbled before resuming his course. Once out in the corridor, he took a look at the paper in his hand.
Draco hung his head for a moment, giving in because he knew that she'd just keep using deadlier and deadlier ammunition if he resisted. “Yeah, alright, you bloody cow! See if I buy you anything for Christmas!”
Then Harry stood up straight. “But you said that for NOW, you're single. That means that you have no reason NOT to go back to mine for the night.”
Harry yawned and wished he could sleep, but his head was too full of worries such as: Does being able to talk to snakes automatically make him a bad person? Is he REALLY the many times great grandson of Salazar Slytherin? Who in the bloody hell would he even ask???
Feeling like his toes were going to curl right up his legs and into his arse if Harry didn't stop, Draco yanked him to his feet and stared at him with wide eyes for a long moment, trying to think of
Life was fairly tense all around. The Dark Lord had officially named Malfoy Manor his headquarters and moved in. He had insisted that the wards on the front gate – at the very least – be keyed to the Dark Mark, so that Death Eaters of the Inner Circle could come and go as they pleased. Although no one quite dared to do so without official business.
The expression on Borgin's face turned to pure fear. Draco felt it might be best to state the obvious. “Tell anyone, and there will be retribution. You know Fenrir Greyback? He's a family friend. He'll be dropping in from time to time to make sure you're giving the problem your full attention.”
“Because...” Draco shifted so that he was facing away from Harry, who promptly spooned up behind him. He sighed morosely, only able to admit the truth because he already had. “My heart already belongs to you. I don't want you to use it like a tool to control me. If you don't want to date me, please just tell me now and let me go home. I promise I'll never bother you again.”
Narcissa smiled at him. “Can we assume that your reaction to his cheating means that you're serious about him?”
With a look like he'd rather suffer the Cruciatus Curse, Lucius sighed, nodded in acceptance, and walked away, his wife glowing from parental pride as she followed him. Meanwhile, having forgotten all about the elder Malfoys, Draco Apparated Harry back to his bed as previously suggested, and stayed there for the rest of time. Mostly.
Happily, Umbridge's first day as Headmistress was spent chasing glorious fireworks all over the school. However, the next day, when Harry was on his way to Occlumency lessons with Snape, he ran across Cho, who tried to apologize to him for her friend, but only succeeded in making him madder than he could recall being – and he'd been mad a lot!
Hermione shook her head and hugged him. “Not at all. You can love whomever you want. I just meant that WE were vastly unprepared to pop in to find the two of you naked and curled up so sweetly.”
At the end of her song, she turned to Blaise. “Forgive me if I am wrong, but I have a strong feeling that Harry is next.”
Harry glared right back at him, adding a pointing finger. “All I'm saying is that you shouldn't just throw your parents away so easily!”
However, Madam Malkin took offense and rushed over. “I don't think there's any need for language like that!” Then she saw that Harry and his weasel had drawn their wands – probably tempted to hex Draco's mouth shut. “And I don't want wands drawn in my shop either!”
Ron rolled his eyes. “A gay dance club – or even just a pub – where Harry can take a good look around and see if anyone interests him,” he clarified.
“Starving!” Draco exclaimed honestly. They'd kept each other up late and worn each other out last night, and so, Draco currently felt like he hadn't eaten in days.
Narcissa reached over and took his hand. “Harry, set aside the fact that you defeated the Dark Lord and freed our family from a horrible fate – of our own making, I agree. The far more important thing is that our son told us how you saved him from dying in a Fiendfyre. As he is the most precious thing to us,
Draco stood there in silence, feeling a bit dead inside. Once again, he'd thought he'd finally succeeded, only to fail. At this point, he was running out of everything – options, choices, things to try, books to use – and his only hope was an extremely rare book on Advanced Magical Furniture Repair. It had taken some time to be tracked down, but now it was on it's way to Draco from some obscure location.
