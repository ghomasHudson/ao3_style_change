He raised one single eyebrow in question.
"We'll figure this out, Draco. Blaise is calling around to see what he can find."
Pansy was shaking her head, "Believe me, he does. He does want you, Potter. What do you mean he pushes you away? How does he do it?"
Harry groaned, stepping closer. "Draco, seriously? I know. I think I have known for a while, but I fully know now and it doesn't change anything. Knowing what you are and knowing what I am to you doesn't change
Harry pulled at Draco's hands, dropping them quickly with a gasp as a shock ran through Harry's entire body, stronger than any shock he has felt yet. His eyes were wide as he looked between his hands and Draco's. Harry felt curiosity pulling his hands back to Draco's instantly, needing to feel the feeling again.
Draco nodded softly to Thomas before raising his arm again, whispering the soft incantation.
"It would be very rare that they both would hear it. If that was the case, we simply would choose who ever seems the strongest to do the spell, leaving the other to sacrifice. If neither hear it, than all hope of a beautiful future will be forgotten."
They walked down to what looked like a bus stop in silence. Draco's mind couldn't shake away the weirdness he felt reading the pamphlets. He thought back to the tree and to what his cab driver, Forest, he remembered, told him. If what Forest had said was true, if the tree acted like that towards Draco, he had a creepy suspicion that it wasn't a coincidence he and Harry were here.
"No!" Harry turned back towards Draco, "I'm not leaving him!"
Hampton quickly strolled over to him, taking his damp coat, "Here, Uncle, let me help you."
His arms still held Draco's shoulders tightly.
"Well, not exactly." Harry admitted.
Hermione's face fell, "How? They most likely don’t have anything to use to floo."
He closed his eyes and leaned against the trunk, enjoying the soft autumn breeze and setting sun.
Draco rubbing the back of his neck, looking at anything but the black-haired boy in front of him, "No, I.. I'm not. I'm not."
. I brought them to Professor-"
The Ministry still barely recognizes their work - often giving the credit to the solved cases to their own official Departments, but Draco's team couldn't care less about credit as long as the animals were safe and well taken care of.
"Do you think.." Granger hesitated. "From the reports it says that he has no ounce of wizardry or witch in him but what about muggle? His DNA was clearly not wizard nor witch, so do you think it’s possible he could be a muggle caught up in magic?"
Luna smiled at him, "Well, this is my house."
With a questioning hum, Draco began taking small, tentative steps towards the caged cat. The panther's eyes tracked every movement of Draco's body, ears laying back further upon his head and sharp, glistening teeth baring with a low growl. Draco stopped when he was only a few feet away from the cage and slowly lowered himself to a squat.
"Alright, Granger?" Draco asked from where he stood in-between the couch and the coffee table.
Mitch nodded, "Yes, Sir."
Looking up at the stars that shined bright, even with the hotel's lighting, he couldn't wait to get back home. He missed his friends, his house, even Kreacher a little bit. He doesn't regret coming here because he did get a few days to be normal and he also made a friend. A friend who he hoped would be in his life for a long, long while.
Harry watched the various groups of students bounce around the courtyard with excitement for the first Hogsmead trip of the year. He had told Hermione and Malfoy to meet him right at the entrance. He was beginning to get extremely nervous as he waited for his friend and his.. new friend? He had yet to tell Hermione about Malfoy joining them. Every time he mentioned him or even spoke to him, Hermione would freeze up and clamp her jaw shut. This weekend, Harry was hoping, that maybe if he got them to hang out together they would figure out how much they had in common, because they did have
for over a full month now and Draco has made barely any progress with the bloody beast. After the incident that first night he was here, the panther had turned a cold shoulder on everyone who tries to interact with him. He saves his coldest shoulders for his double daily visits with Draco however. No matter what Draco tries, the cat sits up in the trees, not moving a single muscle. He occasionally will look at Draco, always with the same cold, blank expression but mostly he looks out into the tiny pond that had been added to the room. Draco would be worried that the cat has fallen into a deep depression, but when no one is in the room the cat eats normally, plays in the water and among the trees and bushes, and even sometimes plays with the Big Cat toys Thomas had purchased two weeks prior.
Harry nodded limply. Ron, taking pity on him, came over to offer him a hand so as to spare him from the indignity of looking at Draco again.
“There is,” Harry cut in. “But it’s painfully cliché.” He raised his eyebrow and his eyes flashed down to Draco’s lips. Draco flushed.
“H-how do you mean?” He could hear his own voice tremble.
Harry frowns, his discomfort dissipating. “Yeah, in the supply closet. But we just use Sticking Charms— don’t you?”
“Yes, the bloody hair!” Harry’s had his fair share of existential crises in his life. He’s well acquainted with the feeling, and this one is going near the top of the list.
The more time they spent together, the better Draco came to like Riven. He was blunt and occasionally sardonic, but simultaneously tender. He listened to Draco’s complaining with a commendable amount of patience and snorted at Draco’s wild enthusiasm. They saw eye to eye in most cases of dissent, yet Draco’s growing respect for Riven lended his arguments a measure of credibility that Draco rarely encountered in his opponents.
Draco can’t look away from him. “What?” he breathes. He must have heard wrong. “Potter, you—you don’t like me.” That’s the only thing Draco can focus on. A certainty he’s built all of his pain on.
“Granger!” He rolled his eyes but kept his tone polite. “Do watch where you’re going.”
“Oh.” That made Harry feel strangely sad. “Do you like that sort of thing, then?”
“Hey, Pansy. I’ll have the—”
He worries for a second about sounding too pushy, then he worries about sounding desperate, then he realizes in horror that he’s used the word “arse” in a conversation with Draco in
Draco sneezes. Harry takes that as a yes.
“Behind it, you oaf,” Malfoy said happily, bounding up from his spot on the bench and nearly tipping over into Harry’s chest. Harry righted him with a hand on his shoulder and Malfoy grinned at him.
When Riven returned at dawn on the fourth day Draco met him outside. He reminded himself that he should have been happy in the moments of his impending engagement. He smiled but could not make himself meet Riven’s earnest gaze.
“Can you recommend anything good? I’ve rewatched all my usual stuff far too many times.”
“What?” Draco hesitated. Riven bowed his head. Then his hands were taking Draco’s, holding them tightly, as hot as they always were.
Harry pushed past a group of tourists and opened the door to Starbucks, sighing in delight at the burst of hot air. He loved London weather— where Ron dubbed it depressingly drab, Harry preferred terms like calming or meditative— but the winters were undeniably too fucking cold. A horrid drizzle had just started, and while the day was perfect for sitting by the fire with a cup of tea, he'd instead been walking down Southbank for twenty minutes. To make matters worse, he’d forgotten his gloves that morning in his rush to get to work. Harry's hands were numb from the wrists down. He kept glancing at them to reassure himself that his fingers were still there, because he certainly couldn’t feel them.
“Did you— er, what was your impression of him?”
“Would you like to continue your order…”
“Yes,” Draco hummed. “You wanted the hottest thing in here, and I can’t very well give you yourself.”
The tinsel (for that was what it was) came away from the wall, showering them all with charmed baubles. Harry fell squarely into the tree, Draco landing on top of him, and Ron fell to his knees, shaking with near-silent laughter. Savage was cackling as she leaned against the proper wall beside them. Harry cursed her for her good aim.
“I want to forgive you,” Draco said slowly. “But I couldn’t even say what I’m angry about. I have more questions than you’re probably able to answer.”
“Hold the door!” Harry called out, and Draco turned in surprise. But he did press a hand to the closing doors, leaving a gap wide enough to walk through. Harry jogged the final few steps, intending to do just that, when he stepped on the loose lace of his shoe.
“No, that’s not necessary...” Lily said. “Perhaps you could help us find a magical piece? We’re looking for protection and healing charms.”
Harry still doubted Ron would really risk their partnership over something so petty, but he’d seen him do some truly questionable things in their three years on the Auror force, and he had no interest in having to work with a rookie for the foreseeable future.
Which would have all been fairly romantic, and potentially salvageable, had Harry not snapped his glasses in half against Draco’s chin.
Nobody tried to stop him as he swept up the stairs to the dormitories, but knowing eyes all turned on Harry once a door slammed shut above them.
“Surely not!” he said indignantly. “That’s an awful reason. The awning is shit anyway—look, my trousers are all wet.”
Draco pretends to mull that over while he lets the rush of happiness wash through him. It never fails to happen every time he hears Harry call their house ‘home’. “Not a chance, not without Mother there to plan it. We both hate weeding too much.”
“You are?”
“Harry,” Harry forced out. He was rewarded with a crooked but charming smile.
“Malfoy’s going—”
“I’ll wait,” Harry said quickly. Draco smiled again. He seemed to deliberate for a moment before leaning over the counter and pressing a quick kiss to Harry’s cold cheek. It was over so fast he barely had time to process the feeling of warm lips on his frozen skin, but the spot burned long after Draco retreated.
The string on Harry’s hood snapped with a sharp pop. Draco desperately waited for the customary retort but one wasn’t forthcoming.
“Occasionally.”
“Right then,” Ron said. “Time to wage war on this potion you’ve brewed us, love.”
“I’m marrying an idiot,” Draco whispers. He’s never been so happy.
When they broke apart, Draco’s knees were weak. Harry’s eyes were blown wide, only a thin sliver of that deep green ringing his dark pupils. His lips were wet and his cheeks flushed, and Draco barely had time to feel embarrassed by his own appearance.
It’s Draco, of course, but a startled laugh bubbles out of Harry before he can stop it. In one hand he’s clutching a plate with a monstrous amount of sugar cookies piled on it and with the other he’s struggling to hold onto an equally massive and complaining calico.
Malfoy shrugged against his shoulder. “It’s quiet. It was cheap at the time.” He smirked at Harry. “I could catch the bus out to Soho five days a week if it pleased me.”
“If it weren’t for your blasted reputation,
“Coffee is nice,” Hermione agreed. “I wish
“I— yes, I suppose that I… might,” Draco finished lamely. His hands were still tangled in Harry’s collar and he seemed suddenly unable to meet his eyes. Harry laughed, and kissed his nose. Then he kissed his forehead and his cheeks and his lips. And when Draco kissed back, Harry forgot today and yesterday and the people watching.
As it turned out, among the extension charms in Draco’s lab were several dozen skillfully set protection spells. What this meant was that each jar, box, and satchel was mercifully intact. That didn’t spare every surface from potion splatter, or Harry from an earful.
“Er, hello,” Harry stuttered. “Great party, isn’t it?”
“You’re harassing
“I can think of a few items on our menu,” Draco murmured against his lips. “Maybe some Darjeeling? Or that abominable chocolate you're so fond of?”
“— I know,” she rolled her eyes. “Make that joke again and I'll string you up by the bollocks. He’s in the back.”
He could scarcely believe himself, could barely piece together what was happening, and he clutched Draco closer by the waist, desperate to hold him. As if that might prove he were more real.
“We’re going to be so sappy,” he finally declared after pulling back. “I’m going to cuddle you in the common room, and hold your hand in the halls, and take you out and snog you wherever and whenever we choose and if anyone—”
(there being the Janus Thickey Ward). Harry’s Malfoy-stalking tendencies occupy their own corner of his mind however, and certainly don’t apply to the here and now.
“Alright, Harry.” A weight slid off his shoulders at the comfortable name. “Why did you reveal yourself as Riven?”
“Sit down, darling,” Pansy tells him, pushing him onto a stone bench. Draco’s joints ache when he does. He winces and Pansy catches it, throwing him a worried frown.
“Where’s the fun in that, Potter?” Malfoy said skeptically, just before the bus jolted forward and Harry had to put a hand up to catch Malfoy’s arse as he fell a couple steps down the steep stairs.
, the hours ticking by to the rhythm of Harry’s mounting headache, and still Draco’s mumbling about fucking
Blaise frowned. “Why would Draco get an unfinished soulmark?”
“Happy Birthday, Draco. Make a wish.”
Draco’s still chanting. It’s a simple little two note tune, and he wiggles as he hums it, his speech slurred with sleep.
Ron was still gasping and choking, but Harry was hardly listening. His mouth seemed to have finally slowed to the pace his brain was at, or his brain must have caught up with his mouth, because he was finally speechless. Draco pushed up on an arm to lean over him. When he reached out to brush his hand across Harry’s cheek, Harry let him, feeling a soft tickle of warmth glowing on his skin. Draco’s grey eyes lit up.
“Wha—I was meant to finish that!” Harry said. He hadn’t been looking forward to it, but he did feel terrible about being the cause of it in the first place.
“I’d love to,” Harry looks far too happy just for pears. “I’ll bring you some oranges.”
Harry lay on his back by the fire, the carpet under him prickling lightly at his arms. He ran a hand through his damp hair and absentmindedly shook off the wetness clinging to his skin. The soft scratch of Hermione’s quill sounded from his right, and he snorted every few moments as Seamus or Ron cracked some obscene joke about the new Defense Professor.
“How’s your mother?” Harry finally asked. Draco startled at the thoughtful question.
“I mean— of course, yes...” Draco chanced a glance at Harry’s face, but it had grown dark enough that he could barely make out the gleam of his eyes. “A couple times. If I liked them, and they liked me, I’d clearly give it some thought. I know Pansy’s obsessed with the idea so it must be either madness or genius.”
“Too bad, you already thanked me.” Ron plucked a final twig out and ruffled Harry’s hair for good measure, before hopping up to sit next to him on the desk. He held out the plate of pies, and Harry took one morosely.
“Yeah.”
“Mm, freezing. Think you could hook me up with something hot?”
Harry spent a little longer that morning fiddling with his hair, and trimmed his beard up tighter around his face. He wondered for the first time if Draco preferred clean-shaven partners. But Harry liked himself this way—he thought he looked older, and a little less like the photos the Prophet liked to circulate of him in his school years.
“Hey, lover,” Harry leaned over Draco, draping his arms around his neck.
“Merlin, ok, my handwriting is going to be absolutely rubbish right now,” Harry muttered shakily as he dipped a quill in the ink.
Harry felt Draco’s laugh against his cheek more than he heard it. Draco stood, turning in Harry’s loose embrace so he could slip his arms into his coat and pull him closer.
“I appreciate your visit,” Draco said as Riven untied his horse. “It isn’t a short way to come.”
“What?” Harry said cautiously. Images of Draco being fired, lying injured in the hospital, getting kidnapped flashed through his mind. He knew it couldn’t possibly be that bad, but the worry was there.
, Blaise mouthed at him when he turned. Pansy’s eyes were darting between the money and a distant point that Draco was sure was Riven’s retreating arse. He just shook his head to show Blaise he was equally shocked. Good for business, indeed.
“Maybe they haven’t registered at all?” Hannah suggested kindly.
“You’d like for him to make a move.” Blaise raised an eyebrow.
“See you in ten,” he waved. Harry had the presence of mind to step out of the way for the new group of customers filing in through the door and go find a seat by the windows. As he sat, periodically glancing up to watch Draco faff about with Pansy or fill orders, he thought perhaps the cold wasn’t so bad. Then when grey eyes met his over the counter, and Draco offered him a small smile, Harry thought he’d never been warmer.
“My friend got married.”
the Slytherins, perish the thought. The two nights Draco was sick in the infirmary during November had been the longest since camping with Hermione and Ron. He ended up sneaking out under his cloak to visit him, and the solid tongue lashing Draco gave him for risking getting in trouble had been worth it when he saw the delight in his eyes.
“Well, ah, excuse me, Potter,” Draco muttered a bit awkwardly. “This is me. I’ll just—” he sidestepped out of the lift, and Harry didn’t even have the shameful pleasure of watching him walk away, because the doors clanged decidedly shut after him.
Wedding plans for Riven’s birthday were arranged at frightening speed. When Draco hinted at a wish for more time, Queen Lily brushed him off with a smile and a mention of tradition. His world was a whirlwind of anticipation and arrangement. Draco felt hollowed out every moment of it.
“Draco,” he repeats, and Draco has to actively stop himself from saying anything. “You’ve been in my life from the moment it became real. You’ve made my life hard, you’ve made my life easy, and now you make my life worth living.” Harry’s voice goes thick suddenly. “You’re beautiful, and high maintenance, and obsessed with the strangest bloody things. You’re unbelievably funny and so very smart. You make me want to be home every day. You make me happy not knowing where the future takes me, so long as it’s somewhere with you. I love you— every day, every night, every moment I’m alive I love you. I love you always.”
“Worse every minute I’m in your presence.” Harry just chuckled, a thick, molten sound that warmed Draco in strange places. “I suppose you’ve heard by now that the queen and prince are official patrons of my family’s establishment. Seems we aren’t useless tinkerers after all.”
“That’s not it!” Draco hissed for the third time. He didn’t mean to be so caustic, but Riven was digging into an unhealed wound. “You don’t understand, that’s not what I— I can’t talk to you about this.”
The choice was made for him when Draco shrugged stiffly and reached for the hem of his clothes. Harry braced himself, leaning forward unconsciously. Draco didn’t make a fuss out of it, pulling his shirt up and pushing his joggers down a bit with the sort of indifference Harry had long since learned to be wary or.
Certainly not when he’d come so close—one misunderstanding away. Draco was worth more to him than that.
“Me too.” Minus the running.
, Ronald?” Hermione hissed. A splotch of ink was spreading across her half-finished essay and she looked perfectly livid.
“Thank you,” he managed. He couldn’t even offer them the box before they had turned away, the necklace still hanging from Riven’s hand.
“What has you so skittish?” Draco smiled. “Rough day?”
,” Draco continued, “there might be a possibility of sharing said jacket?”
“Just in terms of the general idea. Surely someone must have caught your eye at some point. Have you ever considered it?”
“May I kiss you?” He asked sweetly. How could Harry say no?
“Hurry up already!”
A staggering explosion went off inside the lab, sending several of the paintings on Draco’s wall crashing to the floor. The net burned red for a moment, then dissipated.
“Hi,” the vision mumbled. Pansy snickered and Harry felt his own cheeks grow hot.
He didn’t have to actually ask him out, Harry told himself as he walked. Just some light flirting would do. Surely he was capable of that—he’d gotten five pairs of knickers in the mail last Valentine’s Day. Clearly, he must have some general public appeal. Hopefully.
Malfoy gives him a slow once-over. “That’s an awful lot of shiny buckles for a casual visit.” He runs his tongue over his bottom lip. His mouth is painted cherry red today, and Harry tries not to think about smudging the rouge with his thumb (or his teeth).
“Fuck, Potter,” Draco cried out, a hand coming up to cup his face. At least Harry thought that’s what he was doing. He couldn't really tell, because his glasses had tumbled in two sad pieces to the floor, and everything was suddenly rather blurry.
“Good morning?” Harry hedged.
“So,” Harry finally said. “Why Hackney?”
“Are you done?” He asked quietly.
Draco closed his eyes.
The potion was still simmering, only there was something angry about the bubbles now. Something smoky. Something—
Harry thinks
, Harry thinks. He lunges towards the door as if that will somehow delete the message, then he stops to stare at it on his phone for a moment. He’s overreacting.
“Er,” Harry’s just taken a bite and he stops with half the cookie in his mouth. He swallows and looks around. “...no? I’m a neat person.”
“Three days is perfect,” Riven murmured. Draco thought he looked beautiful then, with the evening light reflecting off the snow to cloud his face in shadow, and the steam of his breath floating over his cheeks. He wanted to tell Riven that, and explain why he was hurting. Explain why his heart still called for green eyes and full lips pulled up in a smirk.
Unfortunately, the area behind him happened to be one of those places just large enough for a Christmas tree. Harry felt its needles prickle his back a second before he lost his balance and sank into its branches with a panicked cry.
“Yes,” Draco chokes out, and he realizes in mortification that his cheeks are wet despite his best efforts.
Harry really has no idea why he’s arguing. This is Malfoy— pink-haired, blushing Malfoy— handing himself over on a silver-trimmed platter, and he mentally slaps himself for putting up any sort of resistance.
“Pans— what!” The man yelped.
posted a notice in their honorary obituaries.
“Death is but another path, one that we all must take.” He’d read that, in a Muggle book no less. He’d thought the quote peaceful at the time. He couldn’t bring the same comfort to everyone else though— not the Weasleys, not Teddy, not the woman crying quietly on a bench or the First Year having his broken arm mended. They’d have to wait and heal, and Harry knew it wasn’t his place to fix it. And for once, he didn’t want to.
“Then there was the festival, and my mother contacted me and dragged me out to find that stupid necklace, and I met you again under a new name. I knew I had to return home soon; you weren’t showing any signs of interest in me that I could see, and you’d already met me as the prince.” He paused as if to center himself.
He didn’t see Harry again that week. Narcissa began manning the stall with him just in time for the end of the festival, and after that she no longer needed Draco’s help with selling. He was left either at home or in the meadows, sitting among wildflowers and braiding glowing jewels into threads of silver and gold.
With each successive failure, Harry grew both more determined and more dejected. He refused to confront the depth of his feelings, despite the growing worry that they were almost certainly unrequited. Ron periodically reminded him that he wouldn’t get a substantive answer unless he properly
He loved Harry.
Harry doesn’t seem to agree with the scary part, though. He smiles at Draco’s comments often enough that Draco’s actually starting to believe he’s somewhat funny. There’s not a lot of room for conversation with the TV on, but where Draco usually watches expressionlessly, Harry’s face is completely uncontrolled and the only way he can describe it is beautiful. Cliché, but what can one do? Draco’s hooked, watching every reaction, clinging to the way Harry bites his lip and his forehead crinkles in concern every time someone on screen is in danger. Draco has completely stopped watching for the last ten minutes, so he wouldn’t know who’s fighting now.
“Oh! I almost forgot.” Potter–
“Godric, no,” Harry laughed. “You’re an average person, you prat.”
It’s not a date, though. He’s pretty sure. He’d like it to be— love it to be, wishes it to be, would readily agree for it to be— but Harry’s hot and his age and lives across the hall, and the odds of him being single and remotely interested on top of that are depressingly low. Draco doesn’t have that kind of luck. He’s aware that he’s not unattractive, but he’s been told he has too much of a resting bitch face. In a bout of insecurity he’d once asked Theo whether he’d ever hit on Draco if they didn’t know one another. Theo’s answer was along the lines of “I’d notice you but you’d scare the shit out of me, so no.”
, you are weird. I can't explain how, but I can feel it that you aren't who you say, er, who you are pretending to be, I guess?" He inched closer, near close enough to reach an arm out and touch. "I have someone coming to see you in a few days. She is selflessly helping me with this so I need you on your best behavior, got it Léon?"
close he would push me away. I have been trying to get him to talk for the past week, but he continued to ignore me and now he.. oh god." A rush of despair hit his chest, causing him to topple over.
Lost in his thoughts, Harry barely managed to look up as a man came dashing around the bush he was passing. Harry tried to steady them both but tripped over his own feet and landed directly on the man's chest.
Draco would be attending the island on his own for just the weekend. His assistant, Mitch, would be flying to visit her family for a weekend off. Even though Draco is nervous to adventure this place on his own, he is relieved to have some time for himself and his music. It wasn’t often he was left alone, often times choosing to be with the people he trusted - Mitch, Maggie, his manager, or a friend or two he has made along the way.
Harry blushed, rubbing the hand that Draco had been holding, "You have no idea."
Harry swallowed thickly, "Hi, George was it?"
Draco nodded, pushing open the door. Three men stood at the entrance watching the pair walk in with somber faces.
"Yeah," Harry answered in thought.
Draco leaned away from his chest to look at him better. "All you want is what, love?"
Draco opened his mouth to speak when another bolt of lightening struck, closer this time. Looking at each other with worried eyes, they made their way back to the shore.
He turned his eyes up to meet Draco's, "We are in danger. There is this ritual or something and we have to be a part of it. He was trying to warn me but he couldn't really tell me a whole lot because people were walking towards the door and he couldn't get caught telling me."
having been trained by the
Draco laid back looking up towards the cloudy sky. "Did you know your parents? Sometimes, not often but on occasion, I would wish I had different ones. Especially during- well,
"Yeah," he believed he said, he was in too much shock to know for sure.
They glanced at each other, then walked out the hall. Harry walked out with them.
He tried a few healing spells but to no avail. The tried them again, and again, only resulting in Draco continuing to get colder and colder.
Praying no one way in there, he quickly opened the door and slid in.
Fleur spoke up, "I think that would be for the best."
Harry paused as what he said rang in his ears, he didn’t speak, waiting  to see if Draco would make any innuendos. He never did.
Harry nodded and followed him out the bathroom.
After freshening up, Draco made his way to the floor of the bar. He ordered himself a drink and began to look around. Most people made their way to the dance floor that was created in the middle of the room, all the tables that were there had been pushed off to the sides.
He suddenly realized that Harry wasn't the only one looking at him. He looked in between Harry and Draco before keeping his eyes on Draco, placing his body slightly in front of Harry, "Hi, you are Draco Malfoy right?" Draco nodded, "Well you sounded amazing, really. I heard you were staying here till for a few more days?" -another nod- "Well, if you are interested this Sunday is a founding families reunion and we would love to have you perform."
They said their goodbyes and headed their seperate ways.
Malfoy flipped the sink next to Harry on. The water ran down Malfoy's pale, slender fingers and palm, and Harry was enraptured as the blurry hands began gently rubbing soap over them.
, he thought,
"You mean the
He would whisper in the library.
Harry looked at the man through the review mirror, "Yes sir, it is so gorgeous here."
"I don't think your necklace likes me."
"But yet, you are telling me?"
As Malfoy began speaking, Harry drowned out his voice. Instead he began looking over his former enemy. Last he had seen of Draco Malfoy was a week after the trails had finally ended.
His assistant's lips quirked up even higher, "Down the way.. he has a bit of a temper. They had to put him in complete holding."
Harry raised an eyebrow, "Oh Merlin,
He picked up the phone as he put his things away. "Merlin, Pans. Wait till I tell you what.. no, no,
Harry chuckled, "I don't think I have ever heard that before."
A knock on the door sounded with a soft “
"Ham, you out did yourself with this one."
"Yeah, but, um," Harry turned towards the door, "'Mione, I was hoping-"
entertained'. After he stopped showing me I had no way to learn. I clearly couldn't ask my parents." He scoffed, "I never had the chance to really practice again until after graduation. I was planning on getting my own place with the little money I had secretly saved up but somehow the Ministry seemed to even get there hands on that. So, I moved in with Blaise's older brother for the summer. While he isn't a musician, he does have decent knowledge on guitar and a little bit on piano. So, pretty much the whole summer I spent practicing and learning. I also began writing towards the end of the summer. It helped a lot to cope." As they got to the entrance of the beach he faced Harry, "Sorry, I probably just put such a damper on the day."
After class, he and Draco walked down to the lake, where Hermione and Pansy were already discussing their plans for the upcoming Hogsmead weekend.
"Yes, Harry, you are correct. Don't worry I'm a friend not a foe." He stopped next to the table in the middle of the room, "I am curious about you two, though. My uncle doesn't get much business these days. Ever actually. See people often have a..
Harry walked over, standing right behind Draco, "Yeah I'm starting to think this isn't just any old muggle shop."
situation alone. Instead of commenting on it he said: "Well, what ever the Weasel did I hope you can leave it away from me and can stay focused on the tasks at hand."
Draco rubbed the back of his neck, "Thanks, for walking me."
He was just passing by what he thought was an empty class room, when he felt the pull of warmth, pulling him towards the closed door. He stopped, taking a moment to feel the familiar warmth that he has missed over the past week, and then he pressed his ear to the door.
After a pregnant pause, Harry spoke words that he never in his wildest dream thought he would ever tell Draco Malfoy, "It wasn't your fault."
The man smacked his lips together, "Well, well, young man, I have something that I believe can help you find your way." With furled eyebrows, Harry leaned forward as the man pulled out a small red box. He opened it and pulled out a piece of paper along with a small slightly heart shaped necklace with a hunter green stone. He handed Harry the paper and held up the necklace, "This is what is known as
Harry walked towards her, "What?"
Parkinson's eyes got wide, "Oh no. I'm going to have to move to the states. Or Austria. Or Canada. I'd take a bullet for him, but I don't know if I can take a lifetime of talking about
Looking around he remark how the island is beautiful and how people probably do travel here often enough, but it barely can pass as a reasonable place to live, let alone a paradise island or hot vacation spot. The only thing he couldn't figure out is why his manager had brought him here. How did she know about this place? How did Harry even know of this place?
Maggie Talent, who was subbing in while her husband was out of town spoke up, "When I took Lillian and Drake to the park today the pale one was there walking up to Ol' Hollower. It seemed to feel his power. There was this wind that flew around the tree as the boy got close to it. It was extremely powerful."
She nodded. "Okay, I should be free Thursday, does that day work for you?” Draco nodded. “Good. Why don't we start looking into the list and see what else we can find."
He quickly got rid of their potion and grabbed his and Malfoy's things. Hermione was standing next to the exit door with a curious look on her face.
Harry leaned down and began pressing kisses against Draco’s fair skin. He started on his forehead, moving to his brows then his cheeks then his eyes and across his nose and finally stopping at his bruising lips.
Harry looked around the room and realized they were the only two still in it.
"Are you sure, Darling? You look a little pale."
Harry narrowed his eyes. "Intentions? My only intentions right now are to make sure he is okay. Not sure if you heard but the last I saw of him he was laying in a pool of his own blood."
As the waitress came around for their orders, the chair besides Draco pulled away from the table.
"My son is in a private room, Mister Potter. He is resting."
Harry shook his head, "No, I am not trying to trick you. You seem to want to be friendly so I just thought maybe we can do
"What's going on?" He commanded as soon as he stepped out of his office door.
In one of the moments where he was able to pull his eyes away from the blond who was distractingly rubbing the end of his quill against his lips, he felt a slight pressure of a hand against his thigh.
Harry took a deep breath and asked the question that has been on his mind for
Harry looked at him dumbly, if possible he seemed to get even redder, "I am so done with you."
Harry looked at him, his brows furling, "Why?"
"Complete holding?" Draco asked as he followed the man towards the door at the end of the cages. "He is powerful?"
As the bathroom door squeaked open, Harry pulled his feet closer, wrapping his arms around himself as visions that he spent years in therapy over flash in his mind.
Hampton waited a moment for his uncle to continue. When he didn't, Hampton questioned, "What else will we lose?"
The replacement drummer for tonight stood in the door way, the usual one had gotten catch in a ditch and broke his foot. Draco couldn't help but look the drummer up and down. He looked... delicious. He had his long brown hair, so dark it was almost black, in a bun. His cool olive skin made the green in his deep blue eyes pop drastically, the grey long sleeve shirt that was rolled up to his elbows showed off his muscled arms.
His former therapist, as well as his mother, seem to believe his selflessness towards creatures thrives from Draco thinking his life isn't worth anything, therefore he is willing to put it on the line for other creatures. But Draco knows the true reasons on why of what he does what he does. When standing before a dangerous animal, when all of his adrenaline is pumping through his system, his mind stops. It blanks on every aspect of life besides the will to survive as well as the will to help and understand the challenging beast in front of him. Being in the presence of dangerous, often times finicky, creatures, is the only time Draco truly feels alive. No war, no past, no broken engagements, no estranged friends, no thoughts, no other worries pass through his mind when face to face with a creature. All he sees and feels and thinks about is the creature in front of him and how he can form his mind and body to allow the creatures to relax and to let Draco in to provide help. It's the thrill of an often deadly challenge.
The last thing Draco noticed before the darkness over came him, was a hard chest and tightly wound arms around him.
Harry stares at him for a moment as his mind caught up to the words, "Oh, um.. yeah sure." Harry looked back towards the stage but it was empty.
Draco looked towards to where the noise came from, "I wish that storm would just get here and get out. It's starting to really freak me out how it is just creeping very, very slowly around the island."
There was a slight thickness in Malfoy's voice that Harry was sure wasn't there the day before.
Harry's breath hitched as time seemed to stop. The voices of the crowd slowly disappeared until all Harry could hear was his own blood pumping through his veins. Harry has seen Malfoy's eyes many times before. Stared into them so intently while in a fight that he could make out the dark blue colors that flowed through the grey.
"Harry, you are shaking the table." Hermione muttered around her spoon of brussels sprouts.
He luckily could remember the night, but that also means he not so luckily remembers the embarrassing moments he had with Draco outside the bar.
Draco tried to swallow but his mouth had gone completely dry. The only thought he could conjure was of his hopes and prayers the only thing straight about this
"Why does this shit always have to happen to me? And you? I think who ever designed our lives were a bit touched in the head."
The meal time slowly came to a close as the moon started rising higher. The professors handed out the students parchments and ushered them to their designated rooms.
Parkinson was the one to break the silence, "Do you love him?" she whispered.
The blonde girl walked a step behind him, "I'm sorry Mist- Malfoy."
Harry ran his thumb over the back of Draco's hand, “Sirens? What do you mean by sirens?”
George shrugged as he pulled out a sucker from the bucket sitting on top of the counter.
Harry sniffed as tears continued to flow down his cheeks, “What’s wrong with him?”
She walked out, pausing right after she stepped through the threshold. "Oh, and Draco?"
"How? -doesn't -we wouldn't be able to do an- I just want to be normal."
The boy's face paled, his body began shaking. "I'm not- I don't.." He trailed off.
Draco slowly lifted a hand towards the light. Only when he was mere millimetres away from contact did the panther growl out. Draco gently placed his hands back to his side. "Alright, I won't touch." He took a few paces towards the cat, confidence radiating off of his body. "I won't touch as long as you give me my friends back. You are powerful, kitten, but so am I."
Harry was surprised to hear a light chuckle escape Malfoy. A quiet silence fell upon them. Harry, looking out over the lake, Malfoy, sitting up on a branch staring down at his book, not collecting any of the information it was providing, both deep in their minds.
Turning around he was shocked to see the drummer, Kyle.
"Watch me." He challenged, out loud.
As the final song came to a close, the audience erupted into the biggest cheer he has heard to date. He gave them a big smile and waved as he exited the stage. He was starting to walk towards his dressing room when a hand on his wrist stopped him.
"  fell out.
"Are you here to hurt me?" The little boy asked in a small, trembling voice.
The next few hours flew by as they chatted and snacked on the variety of snacks laying about.
"Alright." Draco agreed. He paused as he saw her playing with her wedding ring, a sign he has learned meant she was either hiding something or worried about something. "What is it, Granger?"
"It's okay, Léon. We'll figure this out."
, but simply because it was a stupid ass name. And also maybe, just a tiny bit because it was Weasley.
The cat turned away, laying down on his boulder, facing the wall behind it, effectively turning his back on Draco and the others.
The function to create words completely slipped away from Draco. He dumbly stared at the man in front of him.
Seeing the soft smirk gracing Malfoy's face and the bright eyes that danced with humor, he couldn't help but smirk back, "That is very true."
When they walked into the small store, it was vacant once again. The door that the old man had went through when he left was no longer there.
"It was nothing."
The men stood silent as Marcus flipped through the papers. After a moment he nodded to his lackeys and walked towards the exit.
He walked up and down a few shelves before he caught a glimpse of blue hair walking pass the row Harry was down. Harry quickly strolled over to the end of the isle, looking around the shelves, spotting the familiar face of his roommate.
“Please,” Harry sobbed, “come back to me,
Harry shook his head, "I don't-"
True to word, Granger wasn't able to meet with Draco until Monday evening. Draco had spent the remainder of the week and most of the weekend being ignored by the black panther and reading book after book. When he was done with the books he had in his possession, he began analyzing all of them just to be certain he didn't miss anything important.
Hermione smiled at him, "Oh, no reason,
The boy looked up towards Draco, eyes shinning with un-shed tears. Suddenly, the foggy edges of the scene became clearer, and Draco could properly smell the stink of the dark cage, could hear the sound of water running through pipes, fully see the fear in every inch of the boy.
They coexistence among themselves and the others in their shared space. The only verbal interactions (ones with actual words, not just noises) Harry has received has been during his study sessions with Hermione, where all they talked about was school work, or on the rare occasion where he and Ginny cross paths and talk about either Quidditch or the other parts of the Weasley clan. Even the other boys in his dorm stayed to themselves. Many of them out with their significant others that had also returned or, in Neville's case, out in the green houses.
That's why he decided to come here. To get away from his past, his friends' worried looks, the constant questions. He just wanted to get away from it all, to relax, to just be anything he wants without any repercussions. But clearly the universe had something completely different in mind for him. He really hated the universe.
"Oh, I thought about Maledictus when I was looking through my animgi books but there was way too many holes in the theory. None of it really added up, especially seeing as Léon is male. There was also no indication that he was one from the tests we took.” Draco let out a deep sigh. “That's what is so weird about all of this is that there seems to be no indication that the panther is anything but a panther."
Harry fell back against the bed, "I just wanted to get away. To get away from everything and yet here I am stuck in a horrible situation, a whole world away. I honestly think the universe just fucking hates me."
Harry took his last sip of coffee, "Yeah, I went down there the second day I was here but didn't really look at all the stores. Plus, there was this very interesting store I would like to go back to." He placed his cup on the table, "Actually, before we live I need to run up and grab something from my room real quick."
Pushing his plate away he leaned closer to Harry, "Who says I want to be friendly?"
his thought moaned.
Draco shrugged. "Some people say it's childhood trauma, I say it's because even after all these year, watching Gryffindors squirm and lose their tempers is still one of my favorite pass-times."
Harry grabbed Draco's hand with his free one, lacing there fingers together, "I was thinking."
a creature.
Malfoy turned, shocked at how much worry seemed to ring through Harry's words, "Yeah, I am.. just.. rough life, you know?"
his thoughts whispered,
Léon's eyes brightened a hair at the endearment that Draco has found himself extremely fond of for the large feline, letting out a hesitant chirp.
Harry bit his lip so hard it began to bleed, tears silently fell down his cheeks. After the war, he felt at peace; for the first time in his life nothing was trying to kill him, nothing was set out for his destruction. He felt normal for once. That was until he stepped out into the real world, once most of the ceremonies and funerals were over, everyone, it seemed, to have many thoughts, opinions, emotions on how things went or should have gone, and they were afraid to tell Harry. Seeing how he missed his last year of schooling, when Professor McGonagall offered him to go to school to finish up, he jumped at the opportunity; he was offered a job as an Aurora, but unlike Ron, Harry refused it. He felt he has sacrificed his life enough and fought enough battles to last a lifetime. The school year went by fairly quickly; Harry only really went to class, studied, and had mental breakdowns every time he saw a scar that they couldn't remove from the school's bricks. So, with a busy schedule, it went by fast. Once Harry had graduated, he decided to take a gap year before settling down for anything permanent. Only, this 'gap year' quickly became a year of isolation, depression, anxiety, worried looks from friends and strangers alike and lots of therapy. After a thrilling 14 months, Harry finally felt comfortable enough to began slowly leaving his home.
"No."
Draco held his breath. Mitch had found out about Draco's magic one night when they were really drunk. He had hoped she wouldn't have remembered it by morning, but when morning came she wouldn't drop the topic. So reluctantly he explained to her who he was and why he only uses magic for only small things. Draco let out his breath and pulled her into a hug. His eyes were tearing up as he said he promised.
Harry jerked awake the night between Wednesday and Thursday. He wasn't sure what awoke him but his racing heart and clammy hands indicated a nightmare; so did the deep depression that weighed down over his chest. He tried to think back on the dream, trying to remember what it was about, but couldn't grasp anything but loud screams.
Draco nodded, "Yeah, but if felt off. Kind of like who ever did this wasn't used to working with dark magic. It seemed extremely choppy."
Daphne groaned, "She had to work late. I swear the Ministry thinks it's their bloody job to keep their employees away from their families."
Harry kept his eyes closed, feeling the warmth get a little warmer, the tingles get a little stronger.
Harry nodded, pointing down the walkway, "Almost to the very end. The owner was really strange too. He seemed to pop out of no wheres. He also gave me this," He pulled out the necklace, "he said something about it 'helping me find my way' or some shit."
to push the want away. He felt physically sick at having to just ignore the boy. He tried speaking to him Tuesday night and Draco nearly blew up the empty hallway's walls. After that, Harry decided that he wasn't going to help unless Draco came to him.
Forest blanched at the question, "Oh, um, no-no, sir. No dark magic can be found here. Legend says that when the people of the town first settled here that some source gave them an oak tree to allow beauty to roam all of the land."
"Léon.." Draco sang. The panther's ear twitched. "I have your favorite snack. Fresh rabbits from Joe's farm."
"Merlin, Harry, no they are not. They are still wizards and witches that want what Voldermort wanted. And the start of that is for you to be dead."
Draco walked closer, he recognized most of the ingredients as ingredients that he often would see Snape working with at the Manor. They weren’t just any potions ingredients, they were ingredients that were used for many dark potions.
"I'll get the stuff." Harry mumbled before walking to the cabinet.
"Well, since we will be seeing you often, the least we can do to show Draco we approve is call each other by our given names? Eh,
Draco's brows furrowed, "Um, alright, I'll sit with you at the Gryffindor's table."
Harry spun so quickly his neck began to throb. He and the boy have had a small truce since rooming together and have had a few small not-exactly-conversations over the first week of school, but they have never, not once, actually hung out, nor held an
"How was your chat with the snakes?"
"Don't worry," Luna said, "You can find peace anywhere you go, Ginerva."
"You can do wandless magic."
Draco willed his flush to go away, "What happened last night?"
how different the man here is.
It was a pleasant surprise to Harry to see these faces. It made him feel special, in a way, knowing that he was one of the rare few who saw this side of Malfoy.
Ginny and Harry stood to follow, Harry pausing when Hermione stayed on the couch. She had a far look on her face as she rubbed at her forearm, the same forearm that had the offensive word
*****
Hermione looked down towards the table with a solemn expression. She took a moment to gather her courage before facing Harry head on. "You like him don't you?"
"Aren't I always safe?"
Draco looked back down at Harry's hand, his eyes traveled past it as morning sunlight bounced off of the necklace that had been forgotten. He bent down towards it, hovering his hand over it.
Draco Malfoy smiled as the crowd cheered. He placed one hand on his mic while the other one softly held his guitar, "Thank you! Thank you very much." He waved as he walked off of the stage.
The bell for dinner rang out, causing everyone to groan.
Harry looked at the boy, "You don't have to pay for mine. I'm sure they can split it up-"
George turned, heading back to the counter, "Or something. Many of the women who have lived here were witches but there isn't many of them left, you see."
"Gave you something?"
He dragged his last bag to the door, "Now are you going to drive me or shall I call a taxi?"
The walls in the dorm, much like the common room, were light tan bricked. Dark wood poster-beds lined in a circle against the wall, each one was completed with a tan duvet, three pillows, and a chest at the foot of the bed. Next to all the beds were a darker wooden wardrobe on one side and a nightstand on the other.
Kyle looked at the floor and then back up at Draco, "I just wanted to tell you that you sounded amazing tonight."
"Really?" Hermione practically squeaked.
Harry walked over to where Draco was standing holding a jar with what looked like hawk talons, "Yeah I'm starting to think this isn't just any old muggle shop."
"So late?" Malfoy laughed, "I think you mean early? It's nearly four, Harry."
Hampton stood up, walking over to his cousin, "Yes, I do know what that means. But I also have faith in Uncle. He may be a little spacey and kinda dim-witted but he loves this place and wouldn't give over Hunulaya's most precious item if he didn't have a reason. Please, he will be here any minute now. Just breath."
Kenneth Trade removed his glasses, rubbing at his eyes he said, "Well we need to find someone with the strength.. whether either of these boys can help I'm not sure. But we all can tell the strength that they both have. Hopefully it will be enough."
Harry smiled back, heart fluttering as he stepped into the elevator, "Morning, Draco."
he can't help but be curious about this new life the boy is living.
Draco put a hand on Potter's wrist before he could dig out his wallet, "Harry, I don't mind. I want to pay for yours."
Draco smiled softly, "I kind of had the same reaction when I saw you too."
Harry ran a hand through his hair, "I'm starting to feel the same. Look I somewhat lied earlier, there was something weird that happened but I kind of brushed it off as just an accident, seeing what just happened in the car, I'm not so sure if it was one anymore. The store I told you about this morning it had a snitch in it. The shop was extremely run down, with weird books and such but I just chopped it off as a muggle accidentally finding something magical."
Deep brown fearful eyes looked up at Draco. Draco reached out a hand towards the owner -
Harry heard a sniffle. "But, Fleur, how can I control myself? When I'm near him, when he touches me, it's like the Veela wants to take over. I have to fight it to stay calm but it keeps getting stronger. I'm afraid I might hurt him if it comes out.. I can't hurt him. Not after.. everything. I can't-" He broke off with what sounded like a sob.
Harry nodded, "Yeah. That and other things you said. All the rubbish about mudbloods, everything you said about Hogwarts and your family line. It just made me realized how much I missed out on. And I was angry."
They spoke softly as they made small talk on the way down to breakfast, both of them too afraid that if they spoke any louder this spell that has been wrapped around them would be broken.
Draco slowly turned his head back towards the panther's. The panther snores turned to deep breathes and whimpers as his eyes began moving  frantically behind his eyelids. The paw on Draco's arm flinched away, only to grab onto his thin shirt again, as if grasping for help.
Harry was confused by this. Dumbledore would have protected them, the Order as well, if they would have just asked, right?
"Harry, I refuse to let you commit something so suicidal like this."
"Oh really? You had a panic attack in the bathroom of a random bar too?" The thumb of the hand that still softly held Draco's shoulders began absentmindedly stroking Draco's collar bone.
He dragged his bags into the lobby and checked himself in. As he was heading towards the elevator he saw a mop of hair that he hoped he'd never see again. He threw himself behind a wall and took another peek at the person waiting for the elevator. With that crazy black hair and the soft features, which were missing of the usual glasses, there was no way to deny it. It was Harry Potter.
Draco moved to go up to the car but Harry grabbed the sleeve of his plain grey shirt, "What are you not telling me?"
Whether his heart was racing from nearly falling out the chair or from Draco's hands, Harry wasn't sure. But he did know that it sped up twice the normal amount when Draco whispered the word love.
She pushed a curly piece of hair that fell out of her eccentric-looking bun, quickly changing the subject to be back on task. "I have a lot of books in my office and at home on various creatures, I have looked through most of my office books, but not the home books as of yet. There is a lot of material, I believe it would be easiest if we did research together. Not only would we get through the information faster but we could also bounce ideas off of each other."
"Not sure." Hampton answered, "I believe his name is Drago Malfoy or something."
"I have to go, Léon. It'll be meal time soon and I promise I would handle today's shift." Draco released the rabbits that still hung around his waist, dropping them unceremoniously into the extra metal bowl besides Léon's water dish. "I'll see you tomorrow kitty."
He has had many revelations over the years, but this one hits him like a rocket every time. Multiple nights has he sat on stage, guitar in hand, in awe at this incredible life.
"Hungry already?" Malfoy joked, an uncharacteristic smile playing on his lips.
The flames and electricity that always accompanied the blue-haired boy licked furiously around Harry's body as they two boys looked into each others' eyes.
They sat in silence for a minute thinking.
Draco ran his thumb on the smooth skin that sat just under Harry's red button up, feeling deliciously soft skin, "Yes, I think that's a wonderful idea."
After the show, Harry felt too high-strung to go back to the hotel just yet. He walked a little bit down the beach and sat in the sand with his feet in the wake of the waves. He closed his eyes and let the sound of the waves and smell of the ocean take over him. With every second he began to become more and more relaxed, thoughts of Malfoy pushed far away from his mind.
"You said he was.. how old?" Pansy asked as she placed another biscuit on her napkin.
"Listen, kitty, I know you are scared, I understand the feeling of being trapped and feeling like you have no control, believe me I do, but I also know that acts of anger won't help you get what you truly want. And I know what you truly want is to be free again, correct? I know I have said it a lot since you came here, but we - me and my team, your hostages Maybelle and David included; are here to help you. The chain you wore wasn't just for our protection but also your own. You have strong magic inside you."
Later on Monday night, Draco stumbled into his office of the
After a bit of a debate, they finally decided that their first stop would be the beach. Breaking only for a few minutes to go change, they soon were walking down the street to the beach entrance.
Draco Malfoy is here.
Harry shrugged, "I mean the weirdest thing has been that we somehow got placed here together. Why?"
A loud bang echoed around the room, Draco's eyes falling on the stream of light that broadened as a door was opened and two men walked in. The lights in the room filtered on as the men walked closer to the cage.
The elevator doors opened revealing a just as nervous looking Draco. When their eyes met, all thoughts of anxiety flew away.
After accidentally falling back asleep for the third time, Harry finally forced himself out of bed. The dorm room was empty, seeing as all of his roommates were more than likely eating a hearty, well-balanced breakfast in the Great Hall. His stomach rumbled thinking about it. He quickly threw his clothes on, grabbed a half eaten chocolate bar from the night before, and rushed out the room.
"Who was the guy you were with last night?" By accident, his voiced laced with jealousy. If Harry heard it, he didn't say anything about it.
Draco shrugged, "I don't know, Daph. Why did you?"
Harry nodded, turning towards his essay, slightly leaning to the side to avoid touching Malfoy. "If the ingredients in the blended poison are the same of the separate poisons, why wouldn't you be able to use the separate antidotes from each poison? The ingredients didn't change so shouldn't it work the same?"
He hadn't told anyone, only vaguely mentioning the show of powers in the reports, choosing to leave out the near death experience.
"Ditto."
Draco laughed, softly, "A bit? I don't think they even have a head. They seem to be just putting random shit out and hoping for the best."
The foot steps continued walking until Harry heard a stall door shut. He glanced at himself in the mirror, realizing all of his surroundings were fuzzy. He turned towards the bathroom door, wishing he could just
Narcissa turned towards Harry. Seeing her for the first time since her trail. He swallowed thickly. "Mister Potter, Miss Granger."
Harry's look of confusion morphed into one of annoyance, "Yes, this bloody essay will be the death of me. Slughorn seems adamant on murdering me this semester just to make a point about sixth year."
"No, no, the tree's magic and banshee song doesn't work that way. The tree responds to anything it sees as a threat. Which is why no one is to go too close to it. Even if Young Draco wasn't close to her, she more than likely felt his power and tried to push him away."
He decided, just for now, to leave this little
"Not sure how much you know, but girls aren't really my forte." He smirked.
The rest of the evening went by in idle chatting and catching up, like it did every monthly dinner. It wasn't until much later in the night, when Draco was saying his final goodbyes that his work's emergency bracelet began buzzing on his wrist. He cursed softly, throwing out goodbyes and dashing out of the restaurant. An alleyway was found beside the building and he jumped into it
When it was clear that George had no intention on continuing the conversation, Draco began to look around again as Harry walked to the counter.
As Malfoy said his good nights and began closing his set, his eyes collided with Harry's.
Harry leaned his head against the cold window, speaking softly, "The fact that I'm in love Draco Malfoy."
Draco shrugged. “I don’t see why not. Not sure how much you will get out of him. He has basically shunned all humans.”
Draco thanked the man and grabbed his bags. Checking his watch he realized he still had six hours until his showing at 8.
Draco rolled his eyes as he stopped at his dressing room. He accidentally misses one show a year and a half ago and his manager
Harry walked towards them, smiling.
Sliding to the side to let a family through, he walked through the exit of the small airport. As per usual, he planned this trip solely on a whim without thinking about where he would stay once he got here. He looked down at the map that he had printed out before leaving. The only hotel was roughly about seven miles down the road.
The other issues of this case - the investigation of where he came from and what he really is mainly; where at a complete standstill. The past month and few weeks, he has looked over every possible book he could get his hands on about rare creatures and magical beings but all for nothing. Every book he came across in both the local library and the few left over books that he was able to save from the Manor held nothing of importance. It was as if this creature was a brand new creature to this world. If the creature even
Plopping down on the couch placed in the center of the room, he closed his eyes. Ever since the war ended two and a half years ago, a lot in Draco's life had changed. His father was sentenced to life in Azkaban, his mother moved to France alone, and Draco began putting every thought and emotion onto paper. He picked up playing the piano and guitar by Blaise's older brother, while rooming with him over the summer after graduation. He was able to get out of the Magic world on his own, which he was extremely proud of. He worked his ass off to get signed with a management company, and after annoying multiple different companies consistently, someone finally decided to give him a chance and he couldn’t be more grateful.
He chatted away with his old friends, catching up about life after the war. Every now and then he would look towards his blue-haired roommate. When the boy wasn't doing anything suspicious, which was pretty much all of breakfast but Harry had to keep looking just to make sure, Harry would look around the room. No matter how many times he searched, he never saw the familiar face of Fleur.
He jerked back, nearly falling out of this chair. A smooth, slim hand grabbed his thigh tighter, as another one pushed at his back, righting him back into the chair.
Mr. Gallings shop? How the hell did he even see it?"
She shrugged, "Gotta stick with what you love, darling." A smirk slowly fell onto her face as she adjusted her computer, "Speaking about what you love.."
Draco grunted, "That's all you could think of to say?"
Harry looked at his best friend with a sheepish grin, "Well, I thought it would be okay if Malfoy came with us to Hogsmead. We are meeting Ron so I figured you would want some time alone with him for a while and I didn't really fancy being alone."
He stared at the boy out the window. He only now realized that if him and Draco did ever become anything, he would have to explain it to his friends. He felt his stomach turn as he thought about having that conversation.
Draco stood up, taking a step closer to the cat. "It's weird.. I mean,
Draco put a hand up before she could start her rambling again. "Granger, really, what's going on? You look horrible."
Draco looked around at the view before them. They had chosen to sit outside on the hotel's patio to eat. The weather, like normal, was breath taking. It was a little warm with a light breeze, the sky was a bright blue with a few clouds floating a head. The only flaw you could find, was the dark clouds that sat along the north and part of the west side of the island.
He startled as Draco picked up his hand, threading their fingers together, "I think they were making fun of you, love."
Harry felt the slight pull of getting lost into he depth of the other boy's eyes, the sparks coming from where he was touching Draco traveling up and down his body.
The group chatted on the side of the busy streets of Diagon Alley as passersby trudged past.
"Yes I am, Harry. When.. when I get close.. there is this
Draco looked at them confused, saving it to question later, he leaned back into the seat, "It has been really good, Forest. I'm actually happy to have caught you. I kind of have more questions about the island, if you wouldn't mind."
He nodded weakly. "It was just so.. different, Pans. I've had visions before, memories before, but I was there in that room.. that cage with him."
The feelings he felt towards Draco were, and are, much stronger than he has felt towards anybody - and he had no clue how to handle feelings this strong.
He loved that his friends cared and appreciated them wanting to keep him safe. He understood why they were so adamant on keeping him closer. When someone you care about has had their life threatened every year since you have known them, one comes to want to protect that person. He feels the same things about them.  But it's been almost 3 years since the war has ended, it was time to let loose at least some of the fear. They all still have the nightmares and never venture far from their wands, but life has been good. They all have new exciting lives. Ron is with George running the shop, Hermione is climbing her way towards being the Minister of Magic, and they have a gorgeous one year old daughter.
Draco went to step in front of Harry, but Harry quickly pulled him back, curious on what Ham wanted, "It's okay. I'll meet you back stage, okay?"
Malfoy's face while in public still often times looks as if he just bit into the sourest of lemons; but in the small confinements of his room, or tucked away behind the rows of books at the library, or even out by the lake when not too many were around, Harry learned that Malfoy had many wonderfully pleasant faces. Ones that when you saw them made one believe in the world again; ones that could light up even the darkest of rooms.
Draco nodded slowly, leaning forward, "Yes, as you have told me, but who was the source? Why did they give the people the tree?"
Harry stared up at the boy, who was determinedly looking Harry in the eyes. Before Harry could stop his tongue, a soft "
A big wave rose up behind Harry, pushing him forwards, nearly underwater again. Draco laughed as he help Harry back up, "You might want to look into getting a new pair of glasses. Whatever has been helping you see clearly is starting to wear off."
The room was pitch black upon first entry. Even the hole in the wall that Draco slipped through was only shinning a dim light into the misty darkness of the enchanted room.
Harry tried very hard to not look at the soft, pale skin that showed as his shirt went up. He was failing miserably.
Harry stood up, crossing his arms. "When.. when we.. Anytime we would get
The door opened and Drummer boy stuck his head through the door, “Draco? Are you ready?”
Draco chuckled. "You're lucky you're cute and I'm hard-headed, Léon. That wasn't very nice what you did."
Traveling has been the best decision he believes he has ever made. Being away from people who don't know his past has been a blessing. To them, Draco Malfoy isn't a guy that was on the wrong side of the war, he wasn't a kid that made extreme stupid decisions, he wasn't a person who never made their own choices and always followed what
Draco smiled one of his sweet smiles up at Harry. Turning back towards the conversation the others were having.
Pansy pushed her bottom lip out into a pout, "Do we have to? Isn't it good enough that we aren't killing him?"
As Draco began helping them walk up the small steps, he turned towards the black panther one more time.
Little did they know, a few streets over, sat almost every member of the founding families, mapping out what exactly tomorrow night will bring.
But this Malfoy's eyes seemed so different from that Malfoy's. This Malfoy's eyes where bright and seemed kind and genuine. Harry couldn't look away. He opened his mouth as if to say something to the boy.
Harry nearly broke his neck, turning so fast to look at Draco.
Hampton looked from the door to Harry, and back again, "I'm sorry, I have to go."
"My friends?" He requested.
Draco Malfoy closed his eyes and pinched the bridge of his nose, "No,
Maybelle looked around herself with confusion before her eyes settled on Draco. "What.."
Draco chuckled, "Leave Lils alone, she is doing her best. Where is she anyways?"
Harry still wasn't sure exactly what Draco and Fleur were talking about, but with the research him and Hermione had conducted over that weekend and the single word
Draco lowered his body to the ground, sitting with his legs crossed, placing his wand in his lap. "You must have been tired. You slept for a good twelve hours." The panther's ear twitched again, stare not wavering. "You have very intense eyes, you know." Draco paused for a moment, giving the cat a chance for action. When the panther didn't move a muscle, he continued. "I brought you some food and water. They are in those dishes over there." At this, the panther's nose twitched slightly. "I wasn't sure exactly what you liked so I arranged for a little bit of everything we have on hand. There is deer, antelope, fish and eggs."
"Oh, adamant? Big word there, Potter." Malfoy leaned over, pulling the essay closer to him. "Let's take a look, shall we?"
Harry didn't know why he was hiding, exactly, seeing as he was already basically covered by not only his pants but also by the canopy on his four-poster bed that was closed all around except for the part right in front of him. Thinking of himself as ridiculous, he decided to lift his head out of the covers. He froze, however, when he heard a voice he hadn't heard in a long time.
distinctive potions ingredients.
his mind taunted him.
“It’s gonna be okay, we’re gonna be okay.” He whispered brokenly to the man.
Draco stared dumbly at him, "How about this: we each switch a half of our bagel. That way if one is poisoned we both die from it."
"Oh, sorry," the thing laying on him said.
"Hey, you have your own." Harry exclaimed with a smile.
When a sob sounded in Draco's mind, he flew his office door open.
*** ABANDONED BOOK ***
Draco gripped his wand tightly and cautiously stepped further into the room. He sent out a soft whistle call. "Here, kitty."
"He is very protective over you."
"When I came to the boardwalk the first time, he was my taxi driver. He tried to do some small talk about the land, but before the conversation could go elsewhere Hermione called me and we talked the rest of the way there."
Draco's mouth made a 'oh' shape, before turning into the biggest grin Harry has ever seen, "Are you asking me on a date, darling?"
"Yes you do, Malfoy."
with the Potter talk. Only this time, it will be good things and you damn well know how he gets when he talks about things he is, err, passionate about."
"Draco, you do realize the time, dear?" Pansy drawled through the flames.
Draco shook his head quickly, "No, Potter, you don't get it.These ingredients are-"
"Nope it’s not." The man leaned a tan elbow onto the bar, "Names Hampton. But you can call me Ham. You are?"
Draco sat up, "Yes I am. Pans I'll talk to you later, thanks for no help."
He lifted the hand closer to his face, running his thumb over the soft skin, admiring his work. He suddenly felt a strong urge to lift the hand to up his lips, but quickly shoved that thought away.
Harry tried to hide his embarrassment to Ron's statement with a cough. "Yeah," He pulled his legs into criss-cross position, "But Pansy's right, his swing could really use some work."
Realization dawned on the old man's face, "Georgie, do sit, I believe you don't seem to have the

"We do. The question is what will you give us in return?"
"This is fucking ridiculous." Harry heard Dean Thomas, another eighth year that came back, say.
personal things that even his closest friends don't dare to ask him.
Draco hesitated, until Harry kissed his nose and then his blushing cheek, whispering a quick "I'll be fine" in his ear.
They walked in silence for the majority of the walk. It was a reminiscent feeling, walking down the dark hallways of the castle. Harry soon found himself lounging for the nights before the war started, the nights where he, usually along with Ron, snuck around the castle looking for things to get into. The upsetting feelings Harry felt when he first woke up came crashing back into him. He unconsciously leaned towards Malfoy, seeking the warmth and electricity that the boy always seems to give him.
Quickly showering and brushing his teeth, Harry crashed onto the bed and didn't wake up till the next morning.
Draco's eyes got big as he realized what the cat was doing. He quickly drew his wand, but a shock went right through his wand hand and he had no choice but to sit watching his only chance for a painless fall fall down to the bushes below.
"Hello," He whispered softly. "I know you are scared, but don't worry, we will get you out of here and running free in no time." Draco slid one foot closer, leaning his body towards the cage. At this angle he was able to see that along with the charmed chains around the cat's body, a thicker bronze chain wrapped tightly around the cat's muscular neck. He recognized it instantly as the binding chains they use to limit a creatures' magical powers. "Thomas, you said he is powerful in more ways than one.. what exactly did you mean by that?"
Harry shrugged, "Why else would you be in a tree?"
Ron smirked around his cracker, "I bet Harry would know, wouldn't ya?"
… hi… how y’all doing..?
Draco jumped as a voice spoke behind them. A man stood tall, leaning back against the counter behind him slightly.
Hampton cast his eyes down, "Yes, I am."
An hour later, he wiped his hands on his khaki pants, and made sure his buttons on his light blue button up were all clipped before walking into La Crow.
, Harry thought, "I've told you I just can't. It's too dangerous."
Liceat mihi, aliud quo nemo intrare possit, liceat mihi ad centrum : Allow me where no one else can enter, allow me to the center
Wind laced with magic began throwing itself around Draco, almost like it was trying to strangle him the moment he was within feet of the tree; it was as if the wind that once blew softly against his skin suddenly switched to throwing itself sharply right at Draco's throat.
Draco glanced at the cages around him, "The creature? Where is he?"
Without looking away from the boys across from him, their uncle whispered, "We could lose our gifts."
"Pansy I will hang up on you if you don't shut your pig face up."
"-with that, it should be simple." Malfoy turned towards Harry, clearly waiting for an answer.
After a minute Hampton cleared his throat, glancing around the room nervously, "Listen, I don't have too much time to explain, I could get in some deep shit just for talking to you about any of this but I have to let you know.. there is a reason you two were brought here."
"Forest, this is my friend Harry, he is here just on a little vacation."
