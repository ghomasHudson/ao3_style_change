I sniggered. “If you insist, my little whore.” I pulled out the finger and spat on my hand, using it to lubricate my other fingers before inserting 3 more fingers into him, causing him to yell, partly in surprise but mostly from pleasure, I think. “You like it, don't you?” I used my other hand to slap his arse hard, twice.
About Jean? Jean is great. I like him and his hands, but not sexually. In Merlin's name! Absolutely not sexually. What am I, some poor boy with daddy issues? No! Never! My father will hear about this! How freaking dare you?? Jean… I love Jean, ok? He makes my hair even better. (and my hair is almost perfect, so it means a lot)
I pulled out my cock, which was nearly fully erect at this point. “Suck,” I ordered, immediately pushing my cock past Draco's petite lips. He nearly choked but gathered his bearings quick enough and started sucking. "Ahhh... Just like a bitch in heat." He tried saying something, but I acted fast, grabbing onto his hair and pulling him forward, causing him to nearly gag on my cock. “I didn't ask for your opinion slut… just do your job.” I tightened my fingers in Draco's hair as I continued to speak, “You like it, don't you? Of course you do, like the bitch that you are.” Draco looked up at me with his big, gray eyes that were filled with lust … fuck. Amazing. “You love this, and I have you all to myself,” I moaned as I started to fuck his mouth. He whimpered prettily around my cock, sounding exactly like a little girl- so sexy. “I can't hold on anymore.” I told him, mere seconds before pulling out my cock and coming all over his face. “Ahhh…” I moaned. “That was brilliant, you are such a good sucker.” I slapped him in the face and gathered some of the come on his cheeks, coating my fingers with them and bringing them to his lips. “Lick it, you little whore.” He opened his mouth and obediently licked every last drop off my fingers. I gazed at him in awe as he crossed every challenge I threw at him- he is so beautiful like that. Achingly so.
So- so… I end up sneaking out carefully, and I can’t believe I’m saying this, but- ahhh I can't! I dry my hair with a spell, OK? I’m sure you're happy now. I dry one of the eight wonders of the world- with a- with a freaking- s-s-sp-spell. I am forced to dry my hair! With this! Because of Potter and his atrocious actions! I truly hate him now. I won't tell him (although I long to), ‘cause I have to disappear before the twat finishes showering, but if I could- it would totally happen. You are so dead Potter. Sooo dead. ‘Cause if you caused any permanent damage to my hair, I’ll kill you.
I started to dress up really slowly. I didn't actually put on any underwear until much later. His eyes immediately dropped to my big dick, staring at it for a long time... After a couple more minutes, I looked him dead in the eye and held his gaze for almost… ten seconds, until he lifted his head to look back at me with terrified eyes... A few seconds later, he completely turned away, like the scared chicken he was, pffftt.
I packed my books and pencil case along with my quill as fast as I could, slung my bag over my shoulder and ran at top speed to the showers. Now, where was this fool, I thought to myself as I glanced around the sinks. Aha, there he was. With his hands buried in the front of his pants, I could tell that his body language was blatantly mortified, but equally excited at the same time.
I'm Draco Lucius Malfoy, and I'm a well-groomed heterosexual who takes care of his hair and loves Nutella. And yes, also writing a diary. That's pretty nice actually, unless you have stupid friends who push their noses everywhere---- never mind. I will cast better spells and it won't happen again.
“Are you ready?” I demanded, and saw him nod quickly. I held my dick in my hand and lubricated it from the excess spit on my hand before slowly pushing it in Malfoy’s arse. He moaned and gasped at the sensation of my cock splitting him open. I didn’t want to hear his petty whines so I told him to shut up, which he did. I was thinking of trying this with other people, but in a flash I realized that it would be a waste of orgasm. Only Malfoy’s body- I am almost sure of- is the best.
“Now, there are two rules that I expect you to remember by heart. One, you must call me sir at all times.” I’m aware that it's not the best word, but… he needs to know that he is now owned. That he is completely and totally mine. “And secondly, if you ever need to stop, your safe word will be… Snape.” Yeah, Snape will totally… snap me out of my reverie. Just thinking about him- ugh no! I’m stopping now! Gross. Fuck. Where was I? “Don't say it unless you absolutely can't take it anymore,” I added. “That’s all, understand bitch??” I affirmed after a long pause, causing him to jump up in panic.
He gasped, and his voice shook when he answered me, “Y-Yes sir… it's so- so good, I l-like it” he cried out. I could tell that he wanted more still, but I wasn't here to please this snarky bottom. Absolutely not. I moved my fingers inside him with a punishing pace and pushed them deeper as I heard his continuous moans. “Ahhh… ohhh…” his groans echoed throughout the empty bathroom.
after a really long time, the first chapter is finally ready! I'm sorry you had to wait about... 3 fricking weeks, but here it is. love you.
I mean- no. This is the last time I will see anything of the sort because- because I hate this. If he keeps going- no! I won't let him. I will make a complaint about sexual harassment! What does he think- I’m straighter than a flag pole!
I pulled out slowly while giving his beautiful ass a hard squeeze. He only yelped in response. “You made two mistakes today, slut.” I said coldly. “First, you talked without permission.” I turned around and gave him a hard look.  His chin trembled as I spoke, and a tangled knot formed in my stomach as I watched him. Shit.
So, after running around Hogwarts, getting rid of some extra calories and unwanted fats, and causing my lovely, precious hair to get all sweaty, I trod down to the Quidditch pitch, watching the Gryffindor team practising out of the corner of my eye to calm my erratic heartbeat (they are so gross and bad… And I really don’t want to lose my calm over a simple glance at Potter. My heart doesn't jump. I'm completely calm.) I hurriedly dash into the showers before they end up spotting me.
Halfway through dressing, he turns his head and looks. Looks straight at me with those piercing green eyes! I glare right back at him, unexpectedly frozen in the moment! What else could I do? What do people do when an insolent arsehole like Potter looks at them like this? Look away! Yes, I will look away. That is exactly what normal people would do. Look. Away.
He starts throwing clothes on, but for some reason, it seems to be happening in slow-motion!! I could have sworn that it was the longest foreplay in the world, the tease, but it’s freaking not! This is the most I’ll ever get to see of him! *cue dramatic gay noises*
Before leaving, I pause to see what he could have possibly wanted to do with my locker. I gasp horrifically when I spot it. There, in big, bold, block letters, written across my locker, with what seems to be… melted wax (from his broomstick polishing kit, no doubt), and- and shaving cream… glaring back at me is this exact sentence: “Malfoy is a horny bottom.”
I spent the rest of the hour enduring his steely gaze that I could feel boring into the back of my skull, and when it was finally over I didn't even bother standing up. Snape always LOVES making me stay after class, no doubt to give me another lecture on my imbecility, so I just… wait. Quietly. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw Malfoy hastily shoving his books into his bag, almost tripping over the stool in his attempt to get away, and smiled to myself. I think Snape became a tad muddled because of Malfoy’s unexplainable behaviour, which is why he suddenly decided to dismiss me without his usual dramatics, but I didn't care and was just glad to get out of that dingy dungeon.
Hmmm… Where have I been? Oh yes! I'm not gay. I'm a tough and strong straight, everyone's in love with me, I'm an amazing athlete, and Potter is ugly.
I snuck up behind him and whispered in a lower, sexier voice- “So you actually came.” He froze, and I almost started laughing. “I hope you understand what we’ll be doing now,” I stated boldly, and he just nodded minutely. “Such a good boy…” I purred, and I swear the moment he heard that he started trembling. What a little whore.
His poor puppy dog face was the last thing I needed to see, and that’s what caused me to ultimately snap. “I said, get the fuck out!”
hmm... first of all, its not my nativ language, and I wont ruin your eyes in the actual chapters. so after all the houers its takes me to translate, I ask help from someone with life, and the edit takes time too.
And Potter? Potter is the most disgusting person I've ever known. First, his hair is terrible. like it's not enough, he is also proud of this. do you understand?? Be proud of such a bad thing?! He enjoyed messing it up, making it look like he had just come off the broom. “Like his father,” Papa says, trying to make me shut up. But I just- I can't! so arrogant! It's killing me.
“What- a- good- freaking- bitch!” I punctured each word with a hard thrust and slapped his ass a couple of times before saying- “Now you’ll take all my spunk- deep into your little hole.”
Now, contrary to what you might believe, this was NOT an ordinary shower. The filthy half-blood starts to masturbate, or- or at least starts doing something very similar, and I have to stand there and bear witness to the moans, the groans… fuck I want to join him in the shower. To be able to look at him! To- to do something- not a blowjob! I don't want to suck anything! Ewww… I don’t want his come on my face- of course not. Why would you think that?? Ughh- gross.
Instead, I had to improvise and use what I had- a lot of wax, the kind that I used to polish my broom, and shaving cream. I don't think he even uses any of those products… Why would he? He would never let his precious, delicate hands get dirty, let alone have the courage to be an actual man…
“Whatever you’re about to say, think carefully and choose your next words wisely,” I snapped, causing him to shut his mouth and press his lips together tightly. After a moment, he slowly nodded. “Clever boy.” I murmured softly while carding my hands through his hair. It seemed to calm him a little.
So I tear my gaze away from him and stare at the mirror instead. After several minutes, his lower half, especially one very important organ- is finally covered. He walks towards the exit, but stops abruptly in front of the lockers. Specifically, my Quidditch locker.
That was when his locker caught my eye. His big, shining, spotless locker. Oooohhh… that would be a good idea to capture his attention. At first, I tried breaking it open. What could be more humiliating, and yet so conspicuous for him if not all his expensive materials, spread out to form a degrading, truthful sentence? Unfortunately, this idiot used too many locking spells to seal his locker. Of course. Why didn't I listen when he was talking about the new charms that his father had taught him over the summer?
I write a diary, ‘cause I am so, sooo! tangled and arrogant soul. my soul is tortured, you see? Got stuck with all these inferior people… It's exhausting.
Hmm… what's next? Oh. I am pretty sure I made myself clear with all the dom thingy. I. NEVER. WILL. BE. A. SUB!!! (and gay! I am so straight it hurts. (but it's actually better. everything better than me being gay. because i am not! it's a lie!))
The lesson began with a roll call. Snape, as usual, made a snide remark at me and praised the great bottom, all in one breath. How fun. Then, this shithole in the disguise of a man started writing down instructions on how to concoct a Swelling Solution on the board, but no. Instead of putting up with this mundane nonsense, I tore a piece of parchment and hastily scribbled down a note to my bitch that said- 'After class. Gryffindor's bathroom. Come alone.’ and slyly turned around, dropping it on his desk while making sure that no one else noticed. I grinned mischievously at him before turning back, knowing that this was gonna be great.
I dug my fingers into his skin at his hips, pulling his body closer. I saw the marks that were being left, like my own personal brand on his skin. After thrusting once, twice, thrice, I buried myself deep in his hole as I came with a shout.
‘Now- your second mistake is that you said ‘we’. There is no we. You are mine, for my use and pleasure only. You are nothing.’ I almost said that last part. Almost. But I saw the look in his eyes, I saw how he had responded when I stroked his hair. I felt the knots getting more tangled in the pits of my stomach. I couldn’t do it. He was so submissive and desperate, and although I mock him, even though I hate him, I could NOT do it.
hmm... I know this is not a good bdsm relationship, this is not a good relationship at all, but it will become better. I swear.
I became more and more aggressive, until I was thrusting as fast as I could. He moaned and whimpered under me, so delicate- so needy. I reached around and grabbed ahold of his dick as I started pumping it to the speed of my thrusts. I could feel his dick pulsing and heard his heart beating loudly as I felt the pre-cum flowing through my fingers. In that moment, I knew he was mine.
Harry sat on the floor across from him and began drinking his own coffee, black—since he was pretty sure Malfoy had just used all his sugar in a single cup of coffee.
Draco propped himself up on one arm to drink some of his own. After a few long sips, he was feeling better, the headache fading, his stomach settling. He felt almost comfortable.
Harry leaned back in his chair, watching Draco fiddle with the stove knobs, muttering about inconsistent heating every time Harry heckled him over how long it was taking.
“Thanks, Malfoy.” Potter gave him a bemused half-smile. “I hope you accept Chinese food as payment for maintenance, cause that’s what I’ve got.”
Harry looked down at the parchment he’d crumpled in his hands. It wasn’t like he was exactly in a position to be giving advice. The only way he knew to make his thoughts go away was drinking. “Well, is there anything I can do to help? Besides...that?”
Please leave a comment if you liked, and/or tell me what your personal take on Draco's character is. I think he's really interesting. Then again, I'm a sucker for the conflicted, morally gray characters. I love what the HP series did with Harry & Draco and Dumbledore & Snape in books five, six, and seven. The way Harry looks at his mentors, peers, and enemies shifts so much in the last three books. Rowling's so good at creating character foils and subtle theming, ugh. I want to write like that someday.
Precisely a minute before ten, there was a soft knock on the door. Harry leapt off the couch and then hesitated, working up his nerve. He took a deep breath, and swung the door open.
An alternate title for this chapter is "Harry finally gets fed up with Draco's shit," haha. I didn't want Harry to be too much of a jerk though. I'm not going to lie, that argument was hard to write, I rewrote it more than once. Tell me what you thought?
“Great. Thanks.” Draco watched as the elf hobbled back to his storeroom, and leaned to the side to peak in. It was a treasure trove of dark, cursed objects, rugs and chandeliers and crystal balls and strange, whispering mirrors. Draco could not begin to guess how Kreacher had accrued such a collection of unholy odds and ends, but at the moment he just wanted a damn power cell so he could get the hell out of this basement.
When Harry’s vision stopped swirling, he made out Ron, sitting on the couch with a can of Budweiser in his hand.
Harry picked his brain, recalling all the messy conversations he’d had with Draco. “I’ve been trying, but...I don’t think anything I say helps. He doesn’t want to hear any of it. Half the time he just gets angry, and I guess I can’t blame him.”
“What if I did?” Draco asked, thinking of the small one he’d made next to the bed, the searing pain from earlier this afternoon still throbbing ominously in the back of his mind.
“Well, like you said, we’re going to be living under the same roof. I made a request of you, to not talk trash about the people I care about. Do you want to make one of me?”
Potter looked up at the hand for a moment, eyes widening. Then he clasped it, and allowed Draco to haul him to his feet.
He handed the chains to Kreacher. Kreacher surveyed them, turning them over in his tiny hands, and muttering things that Draco couldn’t quite make out. Then the elf reached, quick as a snake, and wrapped his bony fingers around Draco’s wrist.
He opened the door to a very odd sight indeed. Two Aurors, dressed in their ministry robes, holding a tattered looking man between them. Harry was reminded of Sirius Black, if Sirius had been in the habit of bleaching his hair Marilyn Monroe blond.
? Draco felt his stomach turn over for the hundredth time that day. At least he’d thought quickly enough to twist Potter’s motives, whatever they were, into taking him into custody. What curse would Potter start with first?
“Oh, sorry, I was too busy being tortured to visit the barber,” Malfoy said, taking another sip of coffee.
“I’m not an expert, but I think most people remember being a child and feel nostalgic, not...try to convince themselves it could have been worse.” Not that Draco’s childhood had exactly been idyllic, but...was anyone’s?
throbbing fiercely. But looking at the wand in Potter’s hand, Draco’s nerve left him. He didn’t care how bad his injuries were, he didn’t want his captor pointing a wand at him and casting spells.
Draco looked back up at him. “Alright. Have at it, then.” He tilted his head back, and Potter leaned closer again, raising his wand and narrowing his eyes.
P.S. I forgot to mention, I've broken 20,000 words on this fic! that's the most I've ever written of a single story, and definitely the most I've written in such a short amount of time, I'm really proud. Thank you guys for all the support and encouragement!
Potter gave him a tired half smile, and went to take a sip of coffee, before realizing his cup was empty. He set it back down with a sigh.
Harry sighed in exasperation, setting a completed sandwich on a plate and shoving it towards Malfoy. “Well, it’s all I have, at the moment. Do you want it, or not?”
He needed some way to pay Potter back, some kind of peace offering. And as Draco got out of the bath, shivering, to get dressed, the perfect idea struck him.
“Then die wondering.” And with that, Draco climbed the stairs to his room, picked his way through the broken glass, and curled up on his bed. Unable to resist the sobs anymore, he let them wrack him, like waves on the shore.
Kreacher shook his head. “No, no, the lowlife thinks he’ll escape, but no, not from these. The rats may crawl into the gutters but you, you’re stuck in a trap. You’ll have to gnaw off your own tail, filthy little rodent--”
“I don’t do anything I can’t do well.” Malfoy gave him a confident, smirking smile, looking, for a moment, like his old self.
Pfftttt! Me? Writing a diary? Come on. Only big, whiny bottoms like Malfoy do this. Walks around with his slender nose raised in the air- “I’m Draco Malfoy! I have a rich father and I’m totally straight!” Does he actually think anyone believes him? He is the gayest person that I have ever laid my eyes on… and I know a LOT of people! I may want to fuck him, but I’m straight! I swear!
I love Jean. I love him with all my heart and hair. touch me, Jean. do me as you wish. I am all yours.
I listen to the metal rattling, not daring to move a muscle, and when the door finally closes behind him- well, then I run.
I thought maybe- maybe I could taunt him by saying something, or... no. It had to be captivating. He had to see just how much of a little bitch he really is.
Instead, I pulled the shower curtain around me and started showering, with him still in the cubicle on my right. I couldn't resist teasing him and started moaning, and occasionally sighing, letting the idiot’s imagination run wild with the dirty things that I could possibly be doing. I heard his sharp intake of breath and a nasty grin crept onto my face at the thought of getting under his skin. What a bratty bottom. I continued my mundane shower until- shit. My dick started getting hard. Because of him! The nasty loser… so what option did I have? To actually masturbate - next to him - I couldn't do it. I'm straight, which straight would even think of masturbating to thoughts of that filthy Malfoy? But- in this situation- thinking of his big, fat, round arse- I just decided to go ahead and do it. So I ended up masturbating. To depraved thoughts of Malfoy, in a doggystyle position, all spread out for me to use like the freaking bitch he is.
Ohh god- ohhh god! what did they write - it's not- it's not true! I swear this- all of this- this is not true! i’m not! i’m absuluty not gay. Of course not! Why would i? And even if i was (which I'm not! I. Am. Straight.), even if I was, I would have been the top. The fucker.
HARRY FRICKING POTTER. The one who stars in all my fantasies -when I kill him! Or mercilessly mock him! Or.. or- I hate this cursed diary. Always putting words in my mouth------- so he comes out. WITHOUT A BLOODY TOWEL! And his half hard dick is huge and amazingly still erect after doing Merlin knows what in the showers! And his divine arse is mouthwatering in the craziest possible way, and... why do you keep putting words in my mouth? I am a very staunch straight, who hates Gryffindors like him. Or boys. Of any kind. I hate boys. And his ridiculous, messy hair? Come on. How can anybody like such a wildly unkempt yet such an effortless- enoughhhhh!
I have to disappear- go anywhere, just not here. But my hair... I have to dry it out first- what will I do??
After I was done dressing, I pondered for a minute, thinking- I couldn’t end it now. It was like a guilty pleasure for him- staring at me, thinking that there would be no consequences… I had to do something.
I fell in love with my hair. ohh… it was a long time ago. I will give you the permission to touch it only if you are a dom. my dom. my aggressive and sexy dom, that will actually choke me if i’ll try to resist.
I'll try to aploed more often... but what do you think? shold I spleat the chapters and publish the moment I have kind of enogh words, or make long chapters?
I didn’t bother wrapping a towel around myself. He could, and actually saw, my whole amazing body, and reacted by making an unintelligible noise at the back of his throat. This little whore actually had the audacity to whimper at the sight of me. Well bitch, enjoy it while you can. When I end up fucking you, you will scream and cry until your throat becomes hoarse.
So I left him there, with my first… “gift” for today. I exited the locker room, smirking to myself, and continued on with the rest of my day. On to my first class of the day, which so happened to be Defense Against the Dark Arts- pshhh like I even need to learn this, come on! DADA? Seriously? Like... didn't I save the magical world 3 times ALREADY? And judging by the way things are going, I’ll probably save it again before the school year ends. Oh joy, and then there was Potions. A lesson just brimming with fun and enjoyment! Yay me. Another class with filthy Malfoy, no doubt. But no, today will be fun. Because today is the day where I absolutely freak Malfoy out.
“Have you prepared yourself?” I asked him… calmly this time. Way more calmly. He silently nodded. “Such a little whore,” I laughed as he turned beet red. “Take off your clothes,” I added, which he managed to do at a remarkable speed- in 5 seconds flat, there he was, standing naked before my very eyes. “You’re my horny bitch, aren't you? And you just LOVE it.” His cock was hard, and so was mine. “On your knees pet. NOW!'' My command got him so excited, causing him to almost fall over as he scrambled to get down on his knees.
“That’s not very descriptive.” Neville frowned. Harry giggled a bit to himself. He found out last year that Ron was a lightweight, but now he was assuming that no one else really knew about that.
"When I was a kid," Draco said. "I never talked to other kids and I always had imaginary friends and I kept
The first students started pouring in and Harry remained silent. If they wanted to notice him, they would. Some of the children put their bags away in their cubbies; some ran to greet Ms. Claire. It was a matter of seconds before the first kid saw Harry. Their eyes lit up, and Harry briefly worried that this kid recognized him from the wizarding world.
Harry turned and walked away. He ignored the people calling his name, remarking upon his bravery. He took his assigned seat to the right of McGonagall. Hardly anyone had sat down at the speakers’ table yet. He stared down at his cup as it almost instantly filled with coffee. He took a sip.
He decided to at least take some more of his Dreamless Sleep Potion. Even if he couldn’t fix his brain, he’d still be able to have his other internal organs function. He took double the recommended dosage, turned off his alarm, and attempted to sleep again.
Harry wanted to go to one so badly. She pointed out that, even if he didn't want to be an auror, he could still have any job in the wizarding community. However, Harry didn't want to stay in the wizarding community. Ever since he left auror training, he hadn't been able to escape the wizarding press whenever he went to
He went outside to the back porch—half-hoping for solitude. Yet, when he saw the dim glow of a lit cigarette, he knew that he wouldn’t be alone.
Harry shrugged. "Not really. I dunno. I think I'm just looking for some excitement. I think this might be the place. It just feels…
Friday night, as soon as he got home, he got out his pen and paper (most of the wizarding world had abandoned quill and parchment after the war):
“Merci, Harry. You didn’t have to do this. Really though, I appreciate it. I hope you have a wonderful first day, but don’t work yourself too much!” she yelled after him as he left.
“Wait, weren’t you just berating your therapist because it was ‘bizarre’ to question your sexuality?”
“We’ve discovered something magnificent about Teddy,” Andromeda told Draco and Narcissa. “When he wants a certain person to hold im he changes his hair color to match theirs!”
to pick something that leads him here?” he muttered under his breath. He facepalmed when Potter sat down next to him. He cleared his throat, attempting to send a message for Potter to
"Good evening, Harry. Please, come in," Headmistress McGonagall greeted him, interrupting his thoughts.
Harry enjoyed auror training, he did, but he still did not feel like it was “fulfilling” him as Luna and Hermione swore good careers were supposed to. He often shrugged it off and contributed the feelings to nerves about being an adult. Since the war, Harry had moved in with Andromeda to take care of his godchild. He was not yet ready to live alone, and he certainly was not ready to care for Teddy alone. In the summer after the war and before starting auror training, Harry had spent his time mainly with press and with his friends and Andromeda. The renovations to Hogwarts meant that everyone wanted to know what the “Wizarding Savior” thought of the new school and the adjustments to sorting and if Harry wanted an “8th year” available to the young war veterans like himself and Ron and Hermione. Of course, the Death Eater trials also brought much unwanted press coverage to Harry. Would he be testifying? What did he want each of the Death Eaters’ sentences to be? Did he pity them?
of July, and he finally felt like things were going to be better someday. He felt like a weight been lifted off his chest. He still felt overwhelmingly sad, of course. He still had those dumb nightmares and nights where he just couldn’t get to sleep, but he was slowly getting better.
Harry noticed that Malfoy was very expressive and that he frequently spoke with his hands and utilized finger quotes.
He arrived at the Ministry of Magic and went straight to the floor of Probational Matters. He sat in the waiting room for roughly ten minutes before the secretary called him back into Maxeltroph Dousselsnorf’s office. The office was very industrial looking with only a desk, two chairs, and a cabinet. Dousselsnorf himself had a large frame, deeply recessed eyes, a big, bushy moustache, furrowed eyebrows, and a potbelly. His bald head would glint every so often as the ceiling light reflected off of it. Draco sighed deeply before sitting down.
They stood around awkwardly for a few minutes until Malfoy spoke up, “Our...uh...English class is halfway over.”
“I may not practice a certain religion, but having a ‘pure-blooded’ relative from Kenya is supposed to be really important. I only wish I knew more about my heritage,” Harry said, swallowing some broccoli.
“Yes, my dear Draco. I can do hair. I’m rather good at it. Last year, I did my own dreads.” Fab informed him, wiping the tears from her eyes.
.          Malfoy reached his right hand up carefully, and he gently pried Teddy’s fingers off of his white-blond hair. Teddy let out a loud whine. Andromeda stepped back from Malfoy so that the toddler wouldn’t get any more ideas of the same sort.
.          Draco offered his hand, and the officer took it. The blond got up and left. He checked his watch: it was 4PM. He was surprised that the appointment took so long. He walked down the hallway, passing the lift, and he made his way towards the designated apparation section of the floor.
Harry grabbed Andromeda’s arm, and all three of them apparated to his flat. When they arrived, Harry could see that his flat was much messier than he previously thought. The loosely-covered disapproval plastered Andromeda’s face. Harry didn’t see how she hadn’t gotten used to this yet; after all, she’d raised Tonks.
their relationship was about. They had written each other often and had even developed inside jokes. As far as Harry knew, this made them at least friends. Yet also as far as Harry knew, friends didn’t really kiss. So was this thing with Draco platonic or romantic or something else all together?
"So many people hate me, and the worst part is that I can understand why. So many people died in the war…and so many others have lived, but with scars. It was partially my fault and I know it."
At 2:40, the door started to sing. Harry wasn't sure why Andromeda charmed it to sing only for Halloween and Christmas, but he supposed that it didn't matter that much. He let Narcissa in and the door stopped its "Jingle Bells" solo.
Harry woke up to the high-pitched beeping of his alarm clock. It was 6 AM, and he was intending to leave in an hour. He got up, made his bed, got dressed, made coffee, and woke Teddy up. He poured some milk and cheerios into a bowl, cut up a banana, and began to feed his godson. When Teddy was done, Harry woke Andromeda and said his goodbyes.

“Surprise me!” Potter replied. He slammed some money down on the counter. “Keep the tip!” He seemed to not know he was yelling.
“Three,” they said together, “Rock, paper, scissors, shoot!” Sally laughed as she looked at Draco’s continued fist.
"I doubt it. Although, I did hear that there was this 3D printer being introduced to hospitals…I'll show you an article about it. It's like magic." Harry winked at the blond.
Harry rolled his eyes. “How many times have people asked me that in the past several years? You hear one speech, you hear ‘em all.” He took another sip of his coffee.
The party was scheduled for 3 PM in order to ensure gift-opening and socializing. With only five hours left, Andromeda and Harry were in a rush.
Harry learned over to pull his backpack towards him from the other end of the couch, and then dug in the smallest pocket, eventually excavating some sugar packets from the diner down the street. He tossed them to Malfoy.
“Yes, but he said they were impossible to escape. I think he was telling the truth, he seems to say everything he’s thinking out loud.”
Finally, Harry's finally decided he needs to call Hermione, finally. We'll see how that plays out in the next one, haha
“It used to be related to blood magic,” Draco cut in. “But I think the Ministry has related it to something else, something else to bind people. I was thinking about the fact that I can’t leave Potter’s property, and I realized that back in the old days, wizarding families like mine, or the Blacks, would mark their territory with blood magic, to prevent trespassers. But now, I mean, Potter got the House of Black in a will from his godfather, so how does the curse know?”
Ron opened his mouth, and then shut it again, hesitating. “Friends like Harry are hard to come by,” he said hoarsely.
What if this really were all in his head? What if it was still that night before he’d left for Potter’s house, when he’d been lying on his back, stomach hollowed out with hunger, thoughts racing?
Malfoy gave him a small, grim smile. “Then you know how to make it work. It takes a lot of hate, to want to see a person suffer that much. Not just anger--hate. Anger is simpler, it’s a flash in the pan, but hatred...hatred is more complex. It has a flavor to it, ages like a fine wine.”
Draco couldn’t remember the last time someone had helped him calm down from an episode like that. His memory had gaps in it, but he was fairly certain no one ever had. Draco could normally control himself well enough not to break down like that unless he was alone. Until Azkaban, at least. But no one there had been inclined to comfort him.
“It’s been a long time since someone’s…” Draco trailed off, rubbed his eyes with his fingers. “Thanks,” he muttered.
“Relax,” Potter interrupted him, holding up his palms. “Do you see me reaching for my wand? I’m just saying, maybe that’s what bothers you. Giving me permission.”
“I’ll just take the one,” Ron replied. He stood and stepped forward, dropping to a seat on the floor in front of the fire. “It’s fine, Harry. Now stop looking so guilty.”
“I can’t,” Harry said, shaking his head. “How can they pretend to be any better than Death Eaters, if that’s how they act when the tables are turned?”
“Promise me you won’t send me back to Azkaban. Please.” The ‘please’ slipped out without his permission, but it was honest.
Malfoy swallowed. “I’m not gay, Potter.” He met Harry’s eyes again after a moment, a cocky grin on his face. “Although I’m sure you wish.”
“People don’t have to be ‘better’ or ‘worse’ than anyone else, you know,” Harry said. “People just kinda...are.”
That was the part that baffled him the most. The food, the rest, the requests to heal him...He could almost chalk that up to Potter wanting to keep him alive, for the time being. But it was the little things that stuck in his head, like the offer of a drink, or the sugar for his coffee, or not invading his privacy by reading his personal file.
“Mr. Potter,” the Auror on the left said, a tall, skinny man with dark hair. “We’ve come on direct orders from the ministry, to deliver prisoner #6583-9K into your custody, as agreed.” He held up a remarkably official-seeming document with a flourish.
The fire was dying to embers, and Harry had just added another log to it with a muttered spell to be sure it lighted, when he heard a creak from the stairs.
Malfoy was running his fingers through his hair, seemingly trying to untangle it. He paused, and looked up. “Well…I’d take a glass of water, if you…if you don’t mind.”
But it wasn’t okay, he wasn’t safe, he was never going to escape--the shakes in his fingers, the nightmares, none of it was going away, ever. He’d never be through paying. Fragmented memories came back to him in small details: icy, slimy stone beneath his bare feet, that moldy, fetid stench in his nose, an Auror shoving a wand in his face, “You’ve got nowhere to go,” three cold walls behind him, bars in front of him, iron, shadow, stone, rot.
And it was getting late, and Draco really didn’t want to miss Hermione’s call. So, with one last weary glance around the room, he headed downstairs.
“I brought dinner,” he said, setting a plastic bag that smelled like food down on the table.  He pulled his coat off and looked up at Draco in surprise. “Is that...did you get the heater working?”
” Harry gritted out despite himself, resisting the urge to straighten his loose-fitting nightshirt, which he now realized was hanging off one shoulder.
“That’s awful,” Harry said, shocked by Malfoy’s quick dismissal of his own suffering. He remembered what it felt like to be locked away and starving. He pushed the memories down again. “You couldn’t have slept much, either.”
“So when the Aurors showed up I signed him over to my name and now I can put him under the Imperius Curse with a snap of my fingers, hell, I can torture him, I can kill him just as easily--”
Draco hesitated, studying the floor, knowing he was in dangerous waters. Hermione had custody of his mother, and he was speaking to her husband, who for all intents and purposes had control over Draco’s mother as well. He couldn’t afford to make Ron any angrier than he already was.
Draco stared up at the bright green eyes looking back at his, at the face creased with worry, the lips moving soundlessly. It was the last thing he saw before his vision faded black.
It was a mental jigsaw puzzle, the way Potter was treating him. Draco had been turning it over and over in his mind, but no matter how he moved the pieces around, he couldn’t make them fit. Every time he arrived at the conclusion that Potter was just being nice, the rest of him would retort,
After that worrying statement, Harry had half a mind to check the room for sharp objects, but he decided Malfoy deserved to be alone by now. So instead, he shot a flippant “Sweet dreams,” over his shoulder, and shut the door behind him. Goddamn, he was terrible at this.
“You asked me, before,” Potter began, sounding thoughtful, “Why I assumed my friends wouldn’t forgive me. So let me ask you something. Why do you assume people only interact with you as a way of ‘getting something’?”
Draco finally succeeded in tugging his arm back. He cradled it. His wrist was burning furiously; Kreacher had wrapped his fingers over Draco’s raw skin when he’d grabbed him.
(Read the ending notes if you want a sort-of content warning. It's a story about PTSD so I kind of assume we're all on board for in-depth depictions of it)
“You’re taking care of yourself though, right?” Harry said. He knew how Hermione could get when she was focused on something. “When was the last time you ate?”
Walking gingerly back into the bedroom, trying not to trail blood on the floor, Draco dug through the drawers of the dresser and found a couple pairs of musty socks to slip on his feet. The last thing he wanted to do at the moment was face Potter—not only was he still mortified after everything that had happened today, but the pain he’d felt from simply grabbing Potter’s wrist too hard was still fresh in his mind. Potter could make him feel that again, for as long as he liked, and it would be terrifyingly easy. He wouldn’t even need to put any effort behind it, not like a Cruciatus Curse. The runes would do all the work for him.
Harry ran a hand through his hair, feeling exhausted. He could only imagine how Malfoy must feel. “You should get some rest.”
He thought of when Potter had taken the chains off him, his first day in the House of Black. He’d stared straight back at Potter and his raised wand, still as stone. Had he really gone that soft in just a few days?
Harry wondered if Draco were having trouble sleeping, too. He didn’t think it was an accident, that Draco had ended up spending the last couple nights in the living room. But after their conversation in the kitchen, Draco had seemed like he wanted some space.
She stopped before she got to it, and turned back to give Harry a tight hug. “Be sure you actually do call me this time, you git.”
“I think this curse is related to something older. And I think the Ministry tampered with it a good amount. I doubt it would be that simple.”
Draco was clearly aware of what he’d done, of the side he’d chosen, the beliefs he’d held and the effects they’d had. And from what Harry remembered of their drunken conversation two nights ago, Draco hated himself for it.
They both spun; Malfoy was standing in the doorway. He stepped into the room, inclined his head to Hermione. “Miss Granger. I believe I heard from the stairs that you have custody of my mother?”
Harry signed on the small line that had appeared at the bottom, and handed the parchment over. The Auror handed him a leather briefcase, thanked him for his time, and then they were gone, the thickset Auror giving Malfoy one last glare over his shoulder. Harry understood the sentiment.
A more genuine smile spread onto his mother’s face, but her eyes were still tinged with worry. “Alright. Things are going wonderfully over here, too, Hermione is a treasure, and the Weasleys are all very lovely.” She turned to Potter. “And Harry, Ginny’s playing in a tournament at the moment, but she wanted me to tell you she missed you.”
Harry took the opportunity to wink at him, and Malfoy looked away, blushing harder. It was fun, making Malfoy flustered for once. He was a hard man to catch off guard.
Harry hesitated, biting his tongue. Part of him wanted to retort that Malfoy was only coming after him like this because he was ashamed of how he’d behaved earlier, of his involuntary reaction to even the slightest touch. But it seemed too cruel of a thing to point out.
The three of them grew quiet as they reached their apartment complex. Noise was something that bothered Gonzalo more than anything, especially after 9PM and before 7AM. They said their goodbyes and went in their respective doors. Draco went to the kitchen to grab a few Triscuit crackers and an Ambien. He set his alarm to 3PM and lay down on the mattress. He had work that night at 11PM.
His journey to the University of Manchester was an uneventful one. He apparated to Muggle Manchester and took the public transit from there. Using muggle transportation was always easiest for him because it meant no Rita Skeeter nor any of the other hundreds of buzzing wizard reporters.
Harry’s plan worked for the first half of the lecture. It felt like the longest hour of his life, but it only got more nerve-racking when Harry sniffed the air and caught a whiff of his own BO.
“Well,” he responded. “I was always very intrigued with wizarding history because of Professor Binns at Hog-“ Harry practically choked on his drink. Draco turned to him in alarm and asked, “Oh my God, are you okay?”
His speech was predictable. It felt like some cookie cutter bullshit from another green-eyed teen picked for a random prophecy to save the world as it was known. It was about death and sorrow and forgiveness and hope and ghosts. Maybe he’d spent too much time reading YA dystopian novels in the past year. Nevertheless, everyone congratulated him. “It was great, Harry!” “Wow, you really have a way with words!” “That was beautiful!” “It made me cry—it was so great!” He didn’t know how to tell them that he bullshitted it.
Ginny and Harry had tried to work it out after the war, but neither of them were really into it. Things had just changed too much. Harry’s therapist said that that was fine and that he needed to work on himself first.
He got out his syllabus and pens and waited as more students poured in. Within ten minutes, nearly all of the seats were filled. There were a few seats still empty, of course: some in the middle and a few in the back near him. Draco smiled, happy that he had probably earned a table all to himself. The professor motioned for the people in the back to close the doors. A girl across the aisle from Draco got up to close their respective door, but she paused when another student ran in.
Friendship--part of Draco was starved for it, and part of him felt sick at the thought. He didn’t think he was made out of the right stuff, to be a friend. And as much as he wanted it, he knew he didn’t deserve it. Especially not a friendship like Harry’s.
Draco considered. The marks from the chains around his wrists, ankles, and neck still burned, as well as the cuts from that arse-face Auror’s wand on his chest, and none of them were getting any better without magic. And his foot
But then Malfoy broke the silence himself. “You know, back in third year, I never really understood what bothered you so much. About the Dementors, I mean.” Malfoy took a deep breath, scrubbed a hand over his face with a sharp wince. “But now I get it,” he continued. “Let’s just say, if they want to torture me, they have plenty of memories to choose from now.”
Ron sounded hurt. It was understandable. Draco remembered what Potter had said, that night in the office.
He started pouring pancakes, his face a mask of concentration, his brow furrowed and his teeth sunk into his pink bottom lip.
certain he wasn’t--Draco’s own powerlessness still sent shivers down his spine. Every time Potter so much as reached for his wand, Draco braced for the worst, every muscle tense and his mind scrambling in all directions. He wasn’t sure he could willingly allow Potter to raise it at him, or stay still long enough for Potter to heal him.
“Don’t get me wrong, I hate you,” Potter continued. “But I’m not the type of guy to…break someone’s damn nose when they can’t defend themselves.”
Harry corked the liquor reluctantly and cracked his knuckles, staring down at his hands. It was time to admit he was out of his depth.
Harry winced internally at the slight jab. He did feel guilty about that, but at the moment, they both had more important concerns.
Malfoy blinked at him, his cheeks taking on a slight tinge of pink. “Well. Who knew. The Boy Who Lived goes both ways.”
The knock came again, more insistent this time. Draco rose unsteadily and walked to the door, peering through the peephole. He saw ginger hair and a freckled face staring back at him. Ron Weasley, holding an armful of books.
In all seriousness, y'all have sat through a lot of fighting in this fic, so here's some of that hurt/comfort shit we all love.
“There’s certain prisoners that everyone wants, everyone’s clamoring for the higher-up Death Eaters, for instance.” Hermione curled a braid around her finger as she spoke, her face a mixture of exasperation and disgust. She looked like she’d gotten used to both emotions in the past few months. “And now, they’re letting people who ‘donate’ to the program pick who they want--the higher the donation, the higher up in line you go, of course.” She gave Harry a cynical half-smile, looking tired. “It’s monetary nepotism at its finest.”
Ron swallowed, hard. “I’m not trying to beat you up over it, I’m just saying, you know the feeling.”
Potter spun. “Ron?” He ran up to the living room, and Draco followed him. The orange head of a Weasley was coming to a spinning stop in the fireplace.
But surely, after this morning, whatever strange notion of goodwill had prompted Potter to gift him with it was gone, and he’d want it returned to him.
Kreacher’s expression twisted into one of distaste. “Kreacher belongs to the House of Black. The House of Black belongs to...
I’m really excited to post this one, it’s one of the scenes that inspired the whole fic. As a result, I did that thing where I obsess over editing and I'm still not satisfied, so I'm crossing my fingers and posting it. Hope you enjoy <3
Potter finally leaned back, satisfied, and then raised his wand one more time to tap Draco on his nose, muttering a short spell.
They sat there in silence for a moment before Harry spoke again. “You had friends back in school, though...Crabbe and Goyle...” Harry tried to remember who else he’d seen Draco with at Hogwarts.
Harry to take custody of him? Surely being the prisoner of his most hated rival would be worse than a stint in prison?
Harry looked up at the legs of the desk in Hermione’s office. It had taken him a minute to work up the nerve to give her a floo call, and even now he was considering hanging up before she noticed him.
Harry rose and took the stairs to the kitchen. He came back with a glass of water, and handed it over to Draco.
“It’s my turn to ask you a question, isn’t it?” Malfoy said, sawing off another bite of pancake with the side of his fork. “If there were a room with a hundred dicks on the wall, how many would you choke on?”
“One more thing,” Harry said hurriedly. “The curse, that keeps people imprisoned, have you any idea yet how to break it?”
He found them, tucked under a book on curses he’d been reading last night, and scrambled up from the floor.
It was late, when Malfoy finally came downstairs. Harry was in his usual spot on the floor, the familiar weight of a bottle in his hands.
He even suspected, in the darker parts of his thoughts, that Potter was simply waiting for his moment, waiting for Draco to heal a bit, before he really started having fun. But then why the little kindnesses, here and there? The ones that seemed almost inconsequential, but that Draco couldn’t get out of his head?
“Alright,” Potter replied. “Fair enough.” He set his food down on the table. “What about you? Do you have any requests?”
Draco woke on the couch, his head pounding and his stomach turning. He sat up groggily, and pressed the back of his hand against his mouth, willing himself not to throw up. Potter was sleeping on the floor beside him, head on his arm, still wearing his glasses. His hair had fallen back off his forehead, and Draco could clearly see his scar, jagged as lightning.
“Coming from someone who smells like a wet dumpster,” Harry replied, knowing it was a bit of a cheap shot. Malfoy had been in prison, he could hardly be blamed for his lack of hygiene.
Draco pulled the blanket back around his shoulders and ate his own food, while Potter sipped the remains of his coffee in silence. Draco’s eyes fell on the marks around Potter’s wrist. They’d finally darkened to a deep violet. Draco felt a stab of guilt, knowing he was responsible. The curse had certainly punished him for it, viciously, but that hadn’t been Potter’s idea. Potter hadn’t even brought the incident up, since it happened.
Hermione was looking at Malfoy, studying him. Then she rounded on Harry. “You haven’t even healed him yet, Harry? Or given him a change of clothes?”
“Told you,” Malfoy said, smiling. It was nice, seeing him looking something other than ashamed of himself.
“That’s a terribly cruel thing to say about yourself,” Draco said, wondering who had made Potter believe it, as he clearly did.
“Would you?” Harry said, honestly curious. He knew Malfoy was a Slytherin, and he’d been a bully back in school. But when the chips were down and Harry had been a prisoner at Malfoy’s family home, he hadn’t identified them to the Death Eaters. To Harry, that counted for a lot.
Harry looked down at the parchment in his hands. None of this was his fault, really, but he still felt miserably guilty.
“Don’t say that,” Harry said. It wasn’t the first time Malfoy had tossed out some dismal remark like that, but every time it disturbed Harry a little more.
“That’s sure what it seems like. Like he's gotten used to be treated...so awfully, and now I don't think he even wants to change. He definitely doesn't want to accept my help.” Harry shook his head. “You should have seen him though, today...I can’t imagine the way he feels being...
“Could I at least…fix your nose? I know a spell.” This time, at least, he remembered to state his intentions before pulling out his wand and sticking it in Malfoy’s face.
“And if I showed up on your doorstep five years later,” Harry asked, “Looking like I’d been to hell and back? What would you do then?”
Draco sat, his whole body tense, waiting for a stronger reaction. “I understand why you would, but please don’t send me back there. I’ll stop, I promise. You can use Legilimency, if you don’t believe me.” Draco’s hands were shaking harder than normal. He folded them in his lap.
He woke to the sound of the door opening. Potter stepped in, looking soaked through, his overgrown hair sticking to his forehead and his glasses covered in rain drops.
Potter just stared back at him, and finally tucked the bloody rag into a pocket of the almost equally filthy jumper. “Come on,” he said, turned, and began walking away.
it. Like I never had before. I could feel exactly how much he hated me, exactly how much pain he was in. And it was…” Malfoy shook his head. “It was the thing that finally broke me, I guess.”
Draco watched Potter as he worked, feeling that bubble of emotion rising in his throat again, a sort of ache that had nothing to do with the bruises. Getting to know Potter made him wonder if he’d ever had a real friend in his life. Or if maybe, this was something different, something rarer, that people didn’t find very often. He pushed the thought away as soon as he had it. It was just the bizarre intimacy of this moment, he decided, having an enemy’s wand pointed at his throat and feeling strangely calm.
Potter sighed. “Well, my friend Hermione managed to pass an order with the Ministry freeing all the house elves, but Kreacher’s lived here for god knows how long, and he didn’t want to leave. I didn’t have the heart to force him out, so now he lives in the basement, comes and goes as he pleases. Steals my liquor, occasionally, but that’s the only time he ever bothers me.”
Draco looked down at the glowing circle of light emanating from the wand raised between them. “You’ve done enough, honestly.”
Harry really didn’t know what to expect from Ron. He’d been mostly jokes, on their floo call before, but Harry knew how adept he was at hiding his feelings behind his sense of humor. Harry didn’t feel he had a right to call Ron at all, especially to ask about this. Still, if Hermione wanted Harry to call him that badly… She knew Ron far better than he did, these days. And Harry knew he’d never hear the end of it if he didn’t.
“Wait, wait,” said Reynolds, holding up a hand. “We just wanted to ask you a few follow-up questions, if you don’t mind?”
Finally, thank you to everyone who's still reading, it means a lot <3 I've been getting back into writing after a long hiatus and this fic is getting me back into the habit of writing every day. I've been really enjoying it.
“Really, Hermione, it was my fault,” Draco threw in, not wanting to drive a wedge between them, and a little uncomfortable at having the subject discussed. Thankfully, Potter still hadn’t brought up what had been happening when the curse had struck Draco, whether through absentmindedness or tact, Draco didn’t know, but he didn’t want his mother hearing about it. She’d just worry, and she looked like she was doing enough of that already.
Draco gave him a disparaging look as he rose, and headed for the stairs. He climbed them slowly, his limbs feeling heavy. He clutched the banister with one hand, and scrubbed the other over his face, trying to wipe away his thoughts. Sharp, minute details were stuck in his brain like shards of glass, the sickly, fetid smell of Azkaban, the wood grain of the table in Malfoy Manor’s dining room, the sound of hazy, echoing screams, the twisted features of dying faces. He felt a sob rising in his chest, and swallowed it.
I'm trying to update consistently, I swear, but if my inspiration just isn't there it won't be very fun to read, you know?
Harry looked at the fire, watching the flames spread over the fresh log. “Dementors. Snakes. Godric’s Hollow—where my parents lived, in the snow. Hogwarts, but it’s empty. A...a graveyard.” He shivered, remembering that night, the ghosts of his mother and father, Cedric’s corpse, Voldemort’s shrivelled body. He ran a hand over the scar on his forehead. “I used to dream about Voldemort, about what he saw, what he felt. Sometimes the nightmares are...sort of like that.”
It took Draco a moment to understand what Kreacher was talking about. “What...the runes? You know them?”
“That’s very sweet, Potter,” Malfoy said, in a tired attempt at his mocking drawl. “Did you read that in a Muggle birthday card?”
Harry sighed, looking down at his wet knees. “You’re not a killer, Draco. I saw you, on the tower, with Dumbledore. Even though you thought you’d be killed, you weren’t going to kill him. You were lowering your wand.”
“Yes, I do.” Hermione’s voice had turned slightly officious, the way it did when she’d made up her mind about something. “He could use a call from you. And I really
“Draco did some reading,” Potter said. “He gathered it was related to the curse on house elves, too, but he reckons the ministry tampered with it.”
“I’m a bit of a sorry excuse for one,” Potter said, reaching up to push his glasses up his nose before seeming to realize he wasn’t wearing them.
They both leaned down to stare at Potter’s hand. Sure enough, a small, white rune was etched into Potter’s skin. Potter removed his fingers from Draco’s arm, and the rune disappeared.
Potter took his glasses off to scrub a hand over his face, and squinted up at Draco. “Going to give me a lecture about my ‘potion problem?’”
Draco swallowed, hard, and finally spat out the truth. “I was researching the runes. Looking for a way to break the curse.”
Hermione was talking to Potter; Draco began listening again. She seemed to be giving Potter an earful about being more careful with the curse.
“Her name’s Hermione, and watch how you talk about her.” Harry’s fingers were gripping his glass a little too tightly.
“I am tired.” Malfoy closed the book in his lap and leaned his bruised face into his hand. “But sleep doesn’t help much.”
Draco’s eyes were wet; he wiped them roughly on the sleeve of the jumper. Potter, thankfully, had the tact not to look at him.
Draco held his breath. He hadn’t thought that his behavior might be considered, and that Potter would be the one judging it. He was pretty sure he’d earned a Troll grade for ‘behavior,’ especially after the temper tantrum he’d thrown yesterday. And besides that, all he’d done so far was do his damndest to piss Potter off. And pissing people off was, unfortunately, one of his best skills.
The elf considered for a moment, uncharacteristically silent. “Kreacher would like to see the chains.”
He took a shaky breath, cracked his knuckles, and threw powder into the fire, watching the flames shift to emerald. “The Burrow,” he said, leaning forward.
“Because I have some semblance of self-control. And you’ve been in prison for years, you’ve clearly been tortured, I’m not going to go out of my way to hurt you just ‘cause I’m mad.”
“I’ll guess, and buy you a belt,” Potter said, downing the last of his coffee and heading for the stairs.
There had to be something more. And as much as Harry despised him…Malfoy had been in that hell for what…almost five years now? For crimes he’d committed as a scared, foolish teenager. Malfoy was never a great person—he was a selfish, bullying little wannabe neo-Nazi, in Harry’s opinion—but he didn’t deserve this.
“I was talking about the Auror, actually,” said Harry. “But now that you mention it, yeah, I am a little bitter about you stomping on my face.”
“Now, look at your right hand,” Hermione continued. “On your palm. Do you see it? It should look like a tiny, white scar.”
Harry accepted it but didn’t drink, cradling the cold glass in his palm. “I can’t imagine how bad the nightmares must get, after Azkaban.”
Draco stood up smoothly and made his way towards Daphne. He pulled her up, making sure that he did not take her broken arm. He smirked at her.
And now it was five to midnight and he stared at the door. He did not know exactly how the entrance worked but he supposed that Potter would show him after all. It was odd to wait for his nemesis. The boy had ignored him the whole day and Draco did not know how he felt about being in close quarters with him in less than four minutes. What if Draco insulted him, he insulted Draco back and they would end up killing each other in that room? It would solve a few problems, Draco thought. He wouldn’t have to worry about the Greengrass’. And he wouldn’t have to think about what his father was up to in the silence of his home. And, of course, what the Dark Lord would do if his father failed to accomplish his task.
She bit her lip and stared at him a few seconds before she sniffed delicately. If Draco were concerned, he would have seen tears in her eyes and how she shrunk under his gaze. But he was not concerned, of course.
Daphne flinched. “Maybe?” She looked up at him scared. Her eyes were wide, and he could see her taking out her wand in defence.
Draco nodded. “Yeah, so seriously, you should think about why anyone would want to be your friend. I certainly don’t.”
Daphne shook her head. “Not yet. But Astoria has heard from her dear friend Cho Chang that there will be a meeting this Saturday. And she is going.”
As soon as the lecture was finished, he followed his friends back towards the castle. While they walked, he made sure that their talk was solely focused on the stupidity that Hagrid made as a professor. He should never have been appointed, thought Draco.
“It’s called A Never-ending Dream,” explained Daphne. “It’s the only song that I have on my little walking man, but it sounds great, doesn’t it?”
Potter deflated. “That’s why I made the defence group. We need to learn these spells. Voldemort is back, and the stupid ministry is not doing anything.”
When they were in a relatively silent corner of the dark corridors, she finally stopped. Her eyes were bright, and her hair mussed. Her hands were balled into firsts and she stared at him in horror.
Another moment had been the day his father had taken him to Azkaban for business. He had been ten years old and after begging and begging, his father finally relented and took him to the dark prison at the end of the world. Draco had not been able to say a word from Azkaban and had not been able to leave the bed for a week. His parents hadn’t been happy with that development.
Draco ignored his friends and looked over towards the Gryffindor table. As soon as he looked over, he could see Potter’s startling green eyes on him already. When he saw Draco looking back, he cocked one eyebrow in obvious question.
Draco’s eyes darkened. Indeed, Theo’s father hadn’t been nice to Theo. After all the times Draco had been at Nott’s house, he knew that Mr Nott was no one he ever wanted to be around again. Maybe he wouldn’t have to.
Daphne shrugged and danced a bit on the spot. “Don’t know. I didn’t really have time to ask, you know? We had to keep it quiet when Astoria gave it to me on my birthday. No time to ask about the name or to get more songs on the little thing.”
“Draco,” warned Daphne. “You will do it; don’t you dare try to get out of it. And what the hell are you doing in my pocket?”
The third instance brings him to the fourth incident. They hadn’t been back to Hogwarts for more than a week and he and Blaise had gone to the dormitory for some time alone. It had been a pleasant evening, full of moans and breathy compliments when the door had opened to reveal a shocked Daphne Greengrass. The young girl had shrieked loudly and promptly slammed the door shut behind her.
He started to twirl her around a bit, singing louder and trying to look as weird as possible. He lost his ear bud a few times but ignored it when he swung her around and took her hands, swinging them between their bodies.
Talking with Umbridge went better than Draco expected. He only had to say a few words to her, and she started to make sure that some spy would be at the inn at the same time. It was a very encouraging, earning Umbridge’s favour and fucking up Potter’s plan to make a defence group happen. Furthermore, Daphne played her part very well. She insulted Pansy on Friday the whole day, mocking her style and her parents. Draco was sure that the next day, his best friend would explode. She was already on the bridge of hexing Daphne into splinters, maybe Draco didn’t even have to break Daphne’s arm.
When he looked at Daphne, he could see how muddy and dishelved she looked. Quickly, he pulled out his wand and spelled away the dirt and mud from his clothes, then repeated it on her clothes. That, of course, did not stop the murmurs in the hall. Draco ignored it and looked at his shoes.
Daphne laughed. “Yes, you have a heart of gold. You saved me. But, oh saviour, that will only stop her from the initial meeting. What about afterwards?”
Blaise just snored. “You’re panicking for the both of us, I’d say. So, you take care of her, I am going to take care of this.” His hands went under his underpants and he let out a loud moan.
Well, he supposed that Potter would not stop about this topic. He would have to distract him from that scene that he had caused at breakfast, and that fast. Maybe if he had bigger things to worry about, the annoying git would not think about the issue closely. So, he did what any self-respecting Slytherin would do. Turned the tables.
She stood up and walked towards the other end of the table, ignoring the looks she got from Draco’s friends. It was not common for her to argue with her sister, and even less for her to walk away.
How on earth had that boy survived fifteen years? His lying ability was so bad that he had to stop himself from slamming his head on the table. Goddamn it.
Daphne punched his arm. “Don’t be crass, asshole. I just want to be alone, and it is cold outside to I figured no one would be here at this hour and weather.”
Sadly, the whole attention was on the couple of girls. Teachers walked towards them, trying to break up the fight. He could see McGonagall next to them, demanding quiet. She wasn’t the only one focused on the fight. He heard the students form other houses cheering them on, screaming fight, fight, fight. But when Goyle set his own Plate on fire, Draco used the moment of diversion to murmur the incarnation and breaking Daphne’s arm for good. Her scream filled the hall and she punched Pansy with her left arm right in the nose.
Potter smirked. “I’m not so sure. See, we have the better seeker on our side, don’t you agree, Malfoy? And I must say, the one in Slytherin is kink of an asshole.”
The girl recked her chin. “Well, then she can fume for all I care. I will join this DA. I have even put my name down already, see?”
“But still, do you really think that I can protect her? What am I supposed to do? Follow her around and make sure she doesn’t get a papercut? Maybe I should prepare her tea, so she doesn’t burn her tongue in the morning. Or I could punch any guy in the face that looks at her? What should it be, darling?”
She laughed outright. “My dramatics. Fuck, Malfoy, you are the drama queen here. And furthermore, what do you think will happen if someone finds out she has joined that stupid group? I don’t think that will go over well. Mommy and father will find out and then we are doomed, Astoria and I.”
And Daphne did. They screamed as loud as they dared, ignoring the heavy rain that started falling onto them, just hopping in the rain, and destroying his whole attire. But there was nothing he could do now, was there? They were already ruined.
He took her hand. “What if I do not tell your father you have a walking man but in exchange, I don’t have to do anything with Potter?”
When finally Saturday morning rolled around, Draco was in a good mood. Even Crabbe and Goyle picked up on his good mood and grinned the whole way to breakfast. Draco even promised to look over their homework. It was an honour, of course.
The rest of the day flew by and it felt like no time at all until he stood in front of the entrance to the room of hidden things. It had been no problem at all to lose Pansy. The girl had never been very motivated about her prefect duties. Draco had sometimes made the rounds alone and this night had been no difference. He had told her to stay inside and get some sleep. Which she had done.
Draco had taken a risk shacking up with a fellow Slytherin. It had been born out of desperation, rebellion, and sexual frustration. Draco had supposed that Zabini would not be someone who would spill their secret to anyone, as it would be as disastrous for him as for Draco himself.
Potter coughed behind him. “I don’t think you can talk to her like that, Malfoy.” When Draco turned his head, he stared at him accusingly. “If she wants to join the DA, it is her business. You can’t stop her.”
But Daphne? She did not have anything to lose. Her family wasn’t involved with the Dark Lord, her sister was safe in Hogwarts and she did not have any secrets that might destroy her family’s reputation. Draco had enquired Pansy at dinner after new gossip about the blonde witch, but his friend had only shrugged. It was maddening, to be in a situation where he could not weasel himself out of lightly, how used to it he may be.
Astoria shrugged. “Slytherin pride?” Her voice was nervous and hopeful. She obviously did not expect him to find her signing up to her obvious death. It was very frustrating.
When Daphne heard about his promise, she was not happy. They were outside again, freezing in the rapidly dropping temperature and staring at each other. This time, he had pulled her aside, making sure no one saw them sneaking into the bitter cold.
She pointed to his shoes. Of course, she was right. He hated that his beautiful dragon boots were destroyed. He would have to talk to his parents at once. Maybe they would finally speak to him again and send new shoes.
She snorted and followed him towards the dungeons. “Really? Then why are you outside in this weather? You know as well as I do that it destroys shoes! Look at them! They are completely muddy.”
Draco held his breath for a few seconds. “And what should stop me from reporting you to Umbridge right now?”
She, of course, would love that. After the huge fight with Pansy, Draco had sided with the darkhaired witch, which in turn had frustrated Daphne greatly. Afterwards, she had made a few snide comments towards Draco, always showing that she would love to punch him in his face. Well, he had insulted Astoria in front of Daphne, so he had it coming.
Draco grit his teeth. “I don’t think it is any of your business what I read or study. Do know your place, darling.”
“Oh, you don’t know?” Blaise smiled even wider. “Well, what a shame. Your new friend doesn’t trust you enough to tell you all her secrets. Pity.” He patted his cheek and started to walk towards the bathroom.
Draco lost count of how long they stood there, hugging each other, and listening to the cries of Daphne. When she slowly started to pull away, he smiled awkwardly at her.
Draco glared at her. “Why do you want to protect her so much, anyway? She is in Hogwarts, its as safe as a place can be.”
“I’ll see you in the common room later.” The traitor next to him kissed him on the cheek and started to walk away from him towards the Slytherin common room.
Draco did not know. But he suspected that he was on a very wrong and dangerous path. And that scared him.
There are a few moments in Draco Malfoy’s life in which he would say that he did not know what he should say. One of them was, of course, when Granger had punched him in his face in third year. He had been so gobsmacked that he did what any boy did when he got punched by a fuzzy gorilla: He ran away.
Draco was stunned for a few seconds. When Theo entered the room, he decided to ask him about the new development.
Additionally to that, his little talk with Daphne had been seen by various Slyterhins. It made the rest of his friend group anxious as well, not being sure what exactly happened between someone in the circles of the Dark Lord and a girl that had nothing to do with it. Pansy had already asked why he hung out with someone who wasn’t in their group.
“What on earth happened here?” The Professor looked at them furiously. “I will not tolerate this behaviour. All of you, detention. I’m sure Professor Snape wants to speak with you at once.”
He stood up and wanted to go towards the door, but Potters arm on his chest stopped him. The green-eyed git stood right in front of him, slightly pissed off.
“I wanted to know where Astoria was”, said Daphne. Her eyes darted around, and her cheeks flushed slightly at the obvious display. Draco had spoken loud enough to attract attention, and even though Daphne was quite popular, she probably did not want him to speak to her so publicly. Oh, well. “She has been spending time with Nott recently, and I was wondering whether she was in his dorm. I do apologise about interrupting your reading.”
He was glad for Pansy. The witch was his best friend since he could remember, even if their friendship was more convenience than anything else. Her parents and his were close and they had brought her to the manor more than once. He also knew that if he ever needed dirt on someone, she would possibly know. It was a good dynamic, he guessed. While Draco also loved drama and gossip, she always had something to say to him. They did not talk about personal problems or feelings, none of the Slytherins did, in fact.
Astoria gasped loudly. “Oh my god,” she whispered. “You have spent more and more time with her lately, haven’t you? She set you up to this!”
When he sat down next to Astoria, the golden trio looked even more furious. He ignored them and looked at the younger Slytherin next to him.
“No, thank you,” sniffed Draco. He held his head high and took her arm. Even if he was not happy about being outside, he still was a gentleman. Sometimes. “You couldn’t afford them, darling.”
Finally, she looked up. Her eyes were full of tears and Daphne took a step towards him and hugged him tightly. Surprised, he hugged her back and listened when she started crying in his shirt, making horrible sounds. And destroying his shirt, as well. He really should start wearing the worst clothes that he possessed when he was near Daphne. It would stop the huge waste of shirts and shoes.
When Draco turned around rather dramatically, his shoe was stuck in the mud. His foot plopped out with a loud plop. Were it not for him holding onto Daphne, he possibly would have fallen straight on his face. She caught him and started laughing loudly while he cursed loudly.
Draco heard small snickers behind him and pulled his wand. He already had a good spell on the tip of his tongue, ready to blast that bastard to smithereens, when suddenly he heard Hagrid’s booming voice behind him.
Daphne smiled. “Of course. But I must go to Professor Snape’s office now. Could you please stay behind? I don’t want to spend the day alone.”
The rest of the day, Draco was slightly giddy. He did not entertain the thought to bully his favourite Gryffindors and almost sulk on the way to dinner. Pansy, bless her, rambled on about one topic or another, never quite stopping and looking at her best friend closely. She had just heard rumours about some Ravenclaw shagging a Hufflepuff, and Draco was glad not to be at the end of her wand. His other friends, Theo, Crabbe and Goyle spoke to each other in silent whispers, not really listening to Pansy.
Draco stared across the clearing. Weasel and Granger seemed as discombobulated as he was, while the rest of the class looked like they might die on the spot. Draco felt that silent confusion. He was just as caought off guard as all his peers. Potter did not seem to care.
Potter breathed frustrated. “That’s what I want to know from you, asshole.” He murmured the last word, but Draco heard him clearly. Right back atcha.
He pushed the questions away and concentrated on studying, Quidditch and the Inquisitor Squad. He did not yet know where exactly they held their super-secret meetings, but he suspected the room of hidden things. But under the possible circumstance that Astoria did get into the Army, he did not want to give possible information away to Umbridge. Instead, he sneaked around, watched Astoria, and tried to ignore both Potter and Pansy. He had managed to avoid both, but he knew that sooner or later Daphne would push him towards Potter or Potter would magically turn up somewhere he was and annoy the shit out of him again.
Daphne looked up at him. “Oh, I didn’t see you there, Draco! I thought you were still occupied with reading.” She slammed her book shut and turned around. Her smile looked fake.
They slowly made their way back inside the castle. It was getting dark outside and the moment they sat foot inside the castle, Draco could feel all eyes on them.
Draco stared at her, hoping she would just hurry the fuck up. He didn’t like to be kept waiting like that.
This was the fourth moment that he was shocked. This girl had the perfect opportunity to ask everything off Draco, and she decided to spend her free spell on protecting her sister? It was an odd thing to do, asking to protect someone. Draco would never have used some opportunity like this in that way. Maybe he would have waited and sat on the free shot, not really using it until he really needed it. Or, he supposed, he would have used it to humiliate the other person, laughing at their expense and trying to keep the upper hand.
The young lady stared at Draco. “Nothing much.” She hesitated, opened, and closed her mouth a few times, shrugging her shoulders and smiling awkwardly.
But of course, things couldn’t stay good for long. When the evening rolled around, he got cornered by an angry Potter. He had found Draco on his own in the library, making notes for the upcoming OWLs. He had just started to go through his notes for Transfiguration when Potter sat down in front of him. He held his wand.
It had been rather obvious to Draco that his father was over his head with whatever the Dark Lord had asked of him. He had seen the panicked and nervous look in his eyes, the poorly concealed terror and worry for Draco himself. So what would happen if he failed his task? Draco would war the brunt of his failure.
Daphne stood up as well. “I believe I will go to the library and start some light reading.” She stared Draco down, making sure he understood her message. Then she took big steps out of the room.
“Do you want to listen to your music?”, he asked. His hand felt around in her coat until he pulled out the small walking man and handed her one of the buds. She took them with shaking fingers and put it in her ear, him following her lead. When he fingered with the walking man, he heard the voice again in his ear. It was nice. Daphne next to him fell onto him again. He held her and started to dance a bit to the music.
And suddenly he understood why Astoria took the risk and joined the DA. It wasn’t out of spite. She was trying to protect herself and her sister, making sure to learn as many defensive spells as possible. He had to admire her braveness. And maybe, just maybe, Astoria and Daphne both could join the Order of The Phoenix. They would be safe with Dumbledore, right?
“Potter,” said Draco. “How do I owe this displeasure? I’m sure you realise that I am not one of your unfortunate friends?”
Draco flinched when Potter said the name of the Dark Lord. Then he put his hand on Potter’s shoulder, awkwardly trying to console him.
Daphne stared at him the whole day. It got so bad that even Crabbe and Goyle noticed the looks and stared back at her. Draco ignored the silent pissing contest, but Pansy made it difficult. When they left the potions classroom, she took his arm and asked him quietly what exactly Daphne wanted. Draco made up some story about stealing her homework (It was believable, as he sometimes took notes from his peers) and she nodded. It would keep her quiet for now, but Draco knew that the display had been seen by other students. He hoped his father would not hear about it.
Madame Pomphrey was not happy. She chastised them. And when they finally were able to leave, Astoria was in front of the Hospital wing.
The rain started to fall harder. Draco put up his wand and changed it into an umbrella, standing closer to Daphne and putting one of his cold hands into her coat. It was just too cold outside.
Zabini and Draco had continued their trysts more secretly. Draco did not want to make a deal with any other people in the castle that might find him in a compromising position. Therefore, he always locked the door and made sure no one would walk in, surprisingly. Zabini had just laughed about his security measures.
“Well, maybe you shouldn’t worry about me allegedly breaking her arm. Worry about your little defence study group instead.” He looked at him intensely. Hopefully, his little brain would understand the hidden meaning.
She smoothed down his robes and looked anywhere than his eyes, keeping herself busy by fixing his tie and cufflinks. “This summer, my father had a rather unwelcome guest. It was Theo’s father, you know? The old man, I guess you have met him over the years.”
“Wait,” interrupted Potter. He was frowning at Draco. “Is Daphne the girl whose arm you broke a few weeks ago?”
Draco took a deep breath and looked at his friends. They didn’t seem to have heard the conversation between Daphne and her sister. He was glad. Draco stood up as well, excusing himself to his confused friends and followed Daphne towards the library.
“Malfoy,” he said. “This wont work if you don’t trust me. I trust you not to go to Umbridge, but I need some trust in return. So, tell me, how do you know about the detention?”
His father had not spoken to him for quite a while now. After he had been summoned by the Dark Lord, he had started to disappear for more and more days. One time, Draco had seen the Dark Lord in his kitchen. It was not a pleasant memory, but he knew that his father was working for him again. If he did not manage to make the Dark Lord happy, his family was doomed. And that scared Draco shitless.
Draco opened and closed his mouth for a few seconds. Salazar, how did he end up in this situation? And how was he supposed to explain it to Daphne?
Draco rolled his eyes and took a deep breath. “I don’t think that joining some stupid group counts as life threatening. So do keep your dramatics to a minimum if you will.”
Draco sat down in front of her, taking the small teacup to sip and smile at his Professor. He did not exactly like her teaching methods, but if she acted against Potter, he was fine with whatever she did. It was his prerogative.
He wanted to stick out this tongue, but they were still surrounded by his peers and he did not fancy to more attention than he had right now. He could see Granger and Weasel staring at him, whispering furiously and Draco breathed deeply. Better make a quick escape before Potter did another stunt. That would be even worse.
Draco rolled his eyes. “Yes, well. The incoming storm would put a damper on any extracurricular activities outside, don’t you think?” He pointed his finger into the sky. And really, the dark rain clouds had been above the castle for some time now, draining every light out of the castle and turning it into a sad, wet, and muddy area. He understood why they were the only ones outside. His shoes were already ruined.
When October rolls around, he has already forgotten about the agreement. The OWLs, being a prefect and being part of the Inquisitory Squad is hard enough, he does not have enough time trying to take care of her. The rest of his time is spent on annoying the Gryffindors and dodging points from other houses, laughing at their faces and having tea weekly with his dear Mrs Umbridge.
“Of course,” shrugged Draco. “How else could we be able to talk? I don’t believe I could sit in a room that represented Gryffindor colours.”
“Until the war is over”, answered Greengrass. Her eyes were forceful, and Draco’s heart sank. How long would this war go on for? He supposed that it might go on forever, until the Dark Lord finally deemed himself ready and killed the git-who-would-not-die.
Draco’s mouth opened. “So, you don’t have to wait until they finally play a song again? That’s- “He fell silent. That’s brilliant. But he couldn’t really say that, right?
Draco didn’t know what to do. He had thought that Potter would love being the saviour of the wizarding world. But this right now confused him: did he not like the attention? Draco knew himself that he would love to be as important as Potter. It would be a dream come true: people staring at him in awe, following his direction without hesitation and waiting on his every whim. But Potter didn’t seem to think the same. His eyes were still downcast but Draco could not stop thinking that this outburst was genuine.
Potter laughed awkwardly. “What? What study group? There is no studying going on. Nevertheless, in a group. Do you have a concussion? What are you on about?”
“So,” said Potter. He had walked up to him, completely unconcerned and grinned rather annoyingly towards Draco. They were outside and waited for Hagrid to start the class. Draco stood next to Zabini and Nott, who both stared at Potter like he was one of Hagrid’s ugly beast. Not that that wasn’t true.
“Oh, Daphne!” said Astoria giving Draco a confused frown. “I was so worried about you! Are you alright?”
Draco smirked towards Potter, who had rather slumped down in his seat, gauging his reaction. He scowled at Draco. “Well, did you have to do that?”
When Daphne joined their table, she did not look at Draco at all. Since their little talk outside, she had been a bit distant and awkward. He supposed he would have been to, if he had cried all over her and told her all his family secret. Not that he thought it would be kept secret any longer.
“Well, the ministry is stupid. And I am sure our peers learn adequately in your lessons. So try to focus on them and on their progress. It wont do you any good to get angry at the ministry. It doesn’t change the situation, does it?”
“Who could that be?” Harry said. He didn’t think Ron or Hermione would come over without calling or sending an owl, and neither of them usually rang the doorbell. They still remembered when the painting would scream every time.
Draco played the scenario out in his head. He was fairly certain Potter was right. Sure, Draco would be afraid, but showing fear, showing weakness, usually just made whatever was coming worse, like running from a dog. So Draco had learned how to subdue it, how to hide inside himself, to project nothing but confidence. It still took effort, but it was fairly reflexive, by now.
“Yes, Potter’s been perfectly decent, things are lovely--honestly,” he added, sensing his mother’s disbelief behind her polite smile.
Potter just smiled and shook his head, getting up to refill Draco’s cup, and dumped a few sugars into it before setting it back down in front of him.
“You’re right, I don’t know why you would care...how I feel, I just...I know I owe you an apology,” Draco finished, unused to stumbling over his words.
Draco couldn’t see Potter’s face, standing behind him, but he heard him scoff, and could guess what his expression was like.
“I’d hate to see dirty,” Malfoy muttered, but his eyes were already fixed on the dusty bed like a long-lost lover. He began to walk towards it.
“Cause you know whatever game you played against me…” Draco forced a smirking smile onto his face. “You wouldn’t win.”
Draco nodded, feeling grateful to Hermione once again, and exceedingly sorry he’d ever called her a Mudblood. She was an angel.
Draco’s thoughts strayed back to his meeting with Hermione. She had seemed sincere, and Draco couldn’t honestly picture her being truly cruel. The one thing that had terrified him the most in this situation had been not knowing where his mother was, but she was safe. Merlin, she was
Draco stretched and rose, startling Potter out of his reverie, and gently tugged the coffee mug from Potter’s hands. “Want a refill?” he asked.
Hermione gave Potter a soft, sad smile, and then her head disappeared again, replaced by Ron’s freckled face. “Yeah, you wanker, call us, alright? Or better yet, drag your arse over here in person.”
Harry looked up at his friend. He caught a bitter glint in Ron’s eyes. “I’m sorry,” Harry said, feeling hollow.
“I don’t know what this mess is, but it’s nothing I want anything to do with.” He began to shut the door, but the other Auror, this one heavyset and ginger, stuck his foot into the doorjamb.
Malfoy took a bite of toast and chewed slowly before answering. “I think it’s clear even to someone as thick as you, you don’t need my consent to do anything. But if you work magic on me without it—“ Malfoy locked eyes with him, his gaze suddenly cold as gunmetal. “Consider any civility between us officially ended. For good.”
“Well, you do still have a horde of cursed objects of dubious origins downstairs, guarded by an alcoholic house elf with no idea what year it is...”
I'm in the middle of some relationshit right now, every grocery store looks like the apocalypse swept through, and this fic is such a nice distraction. I've actually written a little ahead for once, so expect another update soon. Love you all <3
down. Like I should have tried harder, been a better friend. But I guess you can’t help someone who doesn’t want to be helped.”
Sometimes you just don't know until you start writing what kind of tone a story is going to have, so sorry for the switch <3
“She ended the call on you, didn’t she?” Ron smiled fondly at Harry’s nod. “That sounds like my wife.”
“Wouldn’t say no to some toast,” Potter conceded, and Draco headed down the stairs to the kitchen to make him some.
“I don’t think he meant to ignore you,” Draco continued. “I think he just assumes everyone’s better off without him.”
Harry set the parchment down on the desk, cracked his knuckles, considering. He wanted to tell Malfoy he didn’t think he was that awful of a person, through and through. Even back then, he’d recognized Malfoy as a scared teenager, stuck in a bad situation. Just like Harry had been. But in the end, all Harry came out with was, “Sorry, I’m...bad at this.”
been curious, yesterday. “Last night, I was all the way passed out, after drinking that much, wasn’t I?”
