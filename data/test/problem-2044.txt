He woke from the dream with a feeling of peace and contentment flowing through him. For a few minutes, it managed to resist the confusion and disbelief that crept in against it, the more Harry thought about what had just happened.
Harry smiled at her, knowing there was nothing simple about what she'd just said. There was weeks of work in that research alone. She waved him off as if reading his thoughts. 'It’s nothing. The Librarian did most of it anyway. He has quite the interest in the Hallows, it turns out.'
and Harry suddenly, irrationally, wants to tell him to wear his own face. He pulls his own glamour down with a sharp gesture. He's feeling tight under his skin, like he can't remember all of who he is. Wearing someone else's face does nothing to help with that.
'Oh, I get sufficient stimulation, child,' Lucius said, a half-smile on his face. 'You need not worry about your dear old papa's mental faculties. I have many things to occupy my day.'
Four hours have passed by the time Malfoy stirs and wakes. Harry has been growing steadily more tense as each minute ticks by. He hasn't been this close to a full moon without his potion since the disastrous time he'd decided he hated it more than the thought of shifting. He'd ripped his house apart in his frenzy to escape and to hunt. Only the wards he'd forced Ron to build into Grimmauld had kept him from killing that night.
', to coat his hands in a much more effective form of Muggle rubber gloves. He hears Draco do the same, then he starts unlocking the cabinets one by one and sifting through their contents.
'I'll have a steak,' Harry says and he can feel Davies' mockery. He wants to rip his fucking throat out. Malfoy just nods and turns to the waiter, firing off their order in clearly fluent French.
'Mr Green has some information on one of your cases. He was a bit concerned about coming in alone, so I said I'd come with him. Can we use one of the rooms?'
With a sigh, Draco turned from his reflection and stepped towards the Floo, throwing a pinch of powder in.
Ladon's lips twitched for a moment, as though he wanted to sneer, but he caught his response, only saying, 'Let us cut to the chase, Head Auror. Though I highly doubt you have the authority to look into anything I do, I would like this
In answer Blaise rubbed lightly at Draco's back and Draco leaned against him, trying to hold himself together in the face of his spiraling despair.
. He didn't think he'd ever been looked at that way before. He wondered what would have happened if he'd stayed … wondered if Ladon would have pulled him into his lap, hands moving lower … Harry felt a rush of heat to his cock and he cursed at himself. This - this wasn't right.
'Harry,' Ron said, and Harry looked down at Ron's hand as Ron shook his arm gently. 'Where's Ginny?'
'Enough!' he said, and his voice was almost a shout, echoing around the chamber. He glared at Aoife and then at Conor. He even turned his look to Luna, who just gazed back at him placidly. 'You all need to stop and someone needs to tell me what the hell is happening and why it's happening to me.'
Harry tenses at Teddy's name and shakes his head against the words. Teddy's not gone. He can't be gone. Teddy is his Godson. He's Harry's responsibility. Harry would never let anything happen to him. Malfoy squeezes the back of his neck again. 'I need you to trust me, Harry.' He takes a step closer and leans in so their foreheads are pressed together. Harry takes in a deep, shaking breath, trying to focus on Malfoy's words.
'You're burning up,' Malfoy murmurs, but he doesn't act on Harry's request, instead he starts casting. Harry almost moans in relief as the Cooling Charm flows over him. He hears Malfoy move away, then the sound of running water. A moment later he's back with a wet cloth. It's cold where it touches him, and Harry almost doesn't mind the pain as Malfoy cleans around his wound with it.
The snow had spread through the entire Ministry, just like the other weather patterns had. Harry saw people everywhere he went, scrambling for coats and warming charms, putting files inside drawers and sweeping small drifts of snow off their desks. Harry went back to his office first and pulled on a woollen jumper then picked up his heavy black oilskin. He slipped it on and pulled the collar up, then cast the warming charm again.
He'd sunk so easily into that space, into the place where he could let go of everything and just focus on feeling - where he could let Ladon make the decisions and the choices and all he had to do was be good.
Harry tried not to focus on the fact that by the time he'd gone to bed, there had been no owl from Draco in return. When he woke the next morning, he had to stop himself from watching the window, looking for the tap of a beak.
He didn't bother transfiguring his robes. They were used to seeing him in all sorts of getup. He was pretty sure at this point they thought he was some sort of fantasy cosplay weirdo.
'So are you going to give me any details, or do you literally want me to just loom behind you for the night?' Harry asks, unable to stop the sarcasm bleeding into his voice.
The Junior Auror who'd brought the boxes in - Evan? No Euan. Euan Abercrombie - looked up. 'Smith asked me to tell you that yes, there are a lot of similarities so far. These photos are all static too. They're sorted into two piles. That's how we found them.'
Draco cleared his throat and pointed to the letter again. 'Over a two year period, my father received a large amount of correspondence that is signed off by someone called
Now he barely hesitated before slicking the fingers of his other hand as well and sliding them down between his arse cheeks. He pushed firmly against that spot behind his balls and slid them upwards, gasping as he felt the drag over his hole. He fisted his cock again, slowly, sliding his fingers up and down, imagining it was Ladon doing it. Teasing him. Preparing him. The thought made him clench,  pre-come dribbling from his cock.
'Do you know Rose's mama has an otter for a Paternus?' he asked, eyes wide and curious. 'And her papa has a dog, a small one.'
'I'm going to bring you to the edge again and again,' he whispered in Harry's ear, breath hot on his throat. 'But I'm not going to let you fall until I give you permission.' Harry whimpered at the words - at the image they raised. He could already feel himself surrendering to what was about to happen, and he embraced the sensation.
'You're brave and strong and you have a ridiculously noble streak that makes you do the right thing even if it's going to get you killed. Your wolf is those things as well, if you let him be.'
Harry watched her, slightly stunned at the speed at which she was speaking. Her words were almost merging into each other in a continuous stream. She seemed not to have noticed him and Luna at all. Instead, her eyes were inching sideways, back to the endlessly scrolling images, and Harry could see her fingers twitching, as though she needed to be touching her keys again, manipulating the stories she was seeing.
He imagines Malfoy spread out on his bed, hand on his cock, slowly rubbing it. He can hear the slight squelching sounds that tell him Malfoy has a fist full of lube and the thought makes his own cock harden slightly. He reaches down to cup himself, not moving his hand, just letting the weight of it sit there as he listens to Malfoy's movements.
'Besides, like you said, your charges for skipping parole have passed the convictions limit. There's nothing the Ministry could do to you anyway.' Harry spreads his hands, looking Malfoy in the eye, taking in the faint tension around his mouth.
'There is absolutely nothing funny about you luring me here under false pretences,' I say, as though he's the whore and I'm some innocent he's trying to lead astray.
Plus Ron was here. And he liked working with Ron. Mostly. Except lately, ever since Robards had started whispering things like 'Team Leader' and 'Career Progression' in his ear.
He can't think about that now. The whole thing is too overwhelming. He finishes off the last of his food, wiping the back of his hand across his mouth. Draco looks across and there's faint amusement on his face as he puts another forkful of his own half-finished meal to his mouth.
'Yes,' Draco answered absently, not taking his eyes off the glass. He was growing more and more certain by the moment that Harry was behind the one-way glass - that Harry was watching as one of his interrogators attempted to get Draco to admit to something he hadn't done. The idea sent a wave of cold fury through him and Draco felt himself slip completely into the mindset he drew on when he dommed.
Harry looked up at his best mate, Auror uniform impeccably buttoned, shoulders square and strong. Ron had filled out in the last few years. He was the very poster-boy of Auror training. Literally; they'd removed Harry from the posters two years ago. Harry resisted glancing down at his own appearance. He knew how he looked beside Ron.
'I don't see people outside of the club. That's-' Ladon took a breath. 'That's a rule I'm not going to break.'
He took a sip of wine and then reached into the pocket of his jeans, pulling out a duplicate of the picture of Malfoy and Scorpius, unfolding it and sliding it across the table.
Suddenly he craved release from all of it. He'd been putting off seeing Ladon again, because of how things had played out the last time they'd been together. But now … now awkwardness be damned. Harry wanted to forget.
'I - Ginny,' he said, lowering his voice. 'I don't know.  Things are changing, I think.' He took a deep breath. 'I've been seeing someone. To - to work through a few things.'
'That position is not possible, Harry. But I could tie another, if you want the ropes.' He thought about the dragonfly sleeve - the beautiful pattern it made against a man's back as it pulled his arms behind him. He imagined seeing that on Harry's skin, decided he would choose a light rope, to contrast better. He was already getting lost in the idea of it when Harry nodded.
The bird ruffled its feathers before turning away from him and launching itself back out the window. Harry closed and locked the shutters behind it. Then he concentrated, feeling for his wards, and closing the loophole that recognised owls and granted them entry.
'We fight together, now, the world over, for the survival of humanity,' the President continued, his voice commanding. 'Magic, and those who wield it, will be exterminated.'
Harry moved over beside him, looking down at the piles of paperwork on his desk. Draco glanced up at him from his chair and then gestured at the papers.
The DeathKeeper could have just been a nutter. That was a very real possibility. Some of the stuff she was talking about was crazy. The balance between life and death. Normal people didn't control that. Life was just something that happened until death cut it short. There was no balance to it. There was no fairness. If there was, James would be alive.
'Draco's angry - furious. I think - I don't think he has any control over the what the weather does.'
'C'mon,' he said, turning away from Potter and gesturing with his head towards the back door. He held his breath for the count of five as he walked away, and then let it out silently as he heard footsteps trailing behind him. Potter liked to follow Charlie's lead. Draco had seen shadows of it in the memories.
He merely nodded instead, as though it was of no consequence. He turned back around to note that they were headed to the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, rather than the Courtrooms. He couldn't decide how he felt about that. The only time he'd been in the Courtrooms was twelve years earlier when he, his mother and father were sentenced for their involvement in the war. It wasn't a space he had fond memories of - he mostly remembered being terrified he was going to be sent to Azkaban.
Harry stepped in and out during the day for meetings and briefings, but Draco was always there when he returned, the boxes moving, one by one, to the other side of the room. There was a pile of papers on Draco's desk, things he'd removed from the boxes, but it was slim and when Harry queried him about it, Draco merely shook his head, stating it was nothing worth talking about yet. Just a possibility.
His ten minute surveillance circuit tells him that he could easily break into the house, but there's nothing subtle he's going to be able to do about overhearing Malfoy's business. He resigns himself to that fact and moves off to one side to sit on the fence rail near Malfoy's flash car. He looks out over the green fields and lets his mind roam, sifting through the pieces of information he has so far, turning them over like they're puzzle pieces, checking if any of them fit together yet.
He drew the second of the crossed swords, mirroring the first in every way. He could feel something shifting in the air, drawing tight. Malfoy's eyes went wide, darting from side to side. Harry could see him begin to struggle, twitching against the hold of the spell. His face, for a moment, was that of Draco, eyes desperate and pleading, and then he was gone, submerged by the creature inside of him.
'Oh, dear boy,' she said, reaching forward and gathering him into another embrace. Harry struggled to hold back the emotion swirling within him. He couldn't cry. He didn't deserve to cry over this. If anyone should be crying, it was Molly.
He thought about it for a second. 'I might see what Andromeda and Teddy are doing, actually,' he mused.
Harry snorted. 'So the letter says, Blah, Blah, we lost a lot of power after the war, Blah, Blah, we want it back, Blah, Blah, the Auror's is one of the few Departments we haven't yet infiltrated?'
Harry rubs his thumb gently across Draco's cheek again and waits. He'll wait forever, to get this right.
'The shrink at Janus Thickey tell you that, did they?' Harry sneered, not willing to accept it. James' death couldn't be his fault. It couldn't. Someone else had caused this. He knew they had.
'What the fuck is that?' Harry asked, anger in his face as he pointed his wand at the woman's chest, the skin now bared to reveal the same sign he'd seen displayed in the sky that morning. 'Are you a Preservation member?'
Draco looked at him, a hundred questions running through his mind, but he settled on the only one that mattered.
He woke three hours later, jerking upright in his bed, scream ringing from his throat and heart pounding in his chest. He sat forward, resting his arms on his knees and sucked in air, trying to push the dream from his mind.
It spread through him, pooling in his groin. He was aware again that he was all but naked in front of a man who was dark and dangerous and beautiful in the way that a predator was. He could feel his heartbeat speed up at the realisation that he found Ladon beautiful. He didn’t want this to be about sex - this wasn’t about sex - but he had to admit to himself that the touch and the edge to Ladon’s actions had their own dark appeal.
'Walter has tea every day in a café opposite where my charge works,' Harry continues, ignoring the way Malfoy is looking between them, as though trying to read their lips. He won't be able to, the spell is good for that too. 'I've seen a few people hanging about, but I need to know if it's a coincidence or a pattern. I reckon Walter can tell me, but I can't get him to stay in the present long enough to get it out of him.'
Harry opened his mouth to argue but Malfoy turned away from him, not looking back as he said, 'You got what you came for. Now get out.'
'Wait,' Pansy said, swiveling around in her seat to look at him. 'You went to the aquarium … with Weasley and Granger … at Potter's invitation.'
Scorpius was still looking up at him, his gaze changing from curious to anxious. Draco realised he hadn't answered the boy. He needed to focus, to stop the spiralling thoughts.
Malfoy took a step back, hands raised as if that somehow meant he was defenceless. 'I'm sorry,' he said, voice soft. 'I just wanted to pay my respects.'
Banks' eyes flick to Malfoy, who is clutching his hands together as though he's anxious to be standing in the Auror Headquarters. Harry takes a deep breath in, subtly. Malfoy doesn't
Draco rubbed a hand over his face and up into his hair, mussing up the styled look. Harry watched the path of his hand, and then pulled his eyes back down as Draco began to speak.
The moment seemed frozen in time. The music was pounding and all around them bodies were moving and writhing, but the two of them were still. Then Malfoy's eyes flicked down to his mouth, just for an instant, and Harry felt want throb through him. Slowly, deliberately, he moved closer. Not as close as they had been before, but close enough that he could feel Malfoy's body against his, hot and hard.
'Promise me,' Harry says. 'I heard everything you said. Just don't make contact with Davies without me there? Owl me if you need to see him. I'll come immediately. But don't go alone.' He's aware that his voice is almost pleading, but he can't help himself. Everything in him screams against the idea of Malfoy seeing the werewolf again.
He forces himself to hold off. He doesn't want this to be over. He wants to do this for the rest of his life. Neither of them can stop touching, tasting. Draco's hands are all over him, pulling at his clothes, scratching down his skin, urging him faster and harder. Harry shoves him against the wall with every thrust and his shirt is hanging off his shoulders now. Draco looks so absolutely, totally
Harry huffed in frustration at himself and rolled onto his back, the thought of Ladon's absence killing the growing arousal. What did he expect. The man ran a club. He'd been doing
Malfoy grunted, but didn't say anything more. Harry narrowed his eyes slightly before forcing a smile onto Edgar's face.
kill the host, but only after you've applied the seal. If you trap the Horseman inside the body and kill the body, you'll stop its ability to re-form. You'll take it out of play for the rest of the cycle.' Their face had a vicious satisfaction as they said that.
Malfoy leans forward and Harry doesn't need to be able to smell the anticipation on him. 'Full market share under your procurement avenues for the French market?' he asks. 'Cross-border imports with shared client bases?'
Gods but he was weary of the farce. He wanted to be with Harry as himself, as all of himself. He was sick of playing this double game.
'You go out clubbing when you're sick, do you?' Ron's voice was sharp, and suddenly Harry had had enough.
Harry closed the folders in front of him and checked the time. They'd left Lucius Malfoy for a few days. They knew exactly where he was, after all, and from everything Harry had seen regarding the restrictions on his house, magic and movement, the idea that he could be involved was incredibly slim. Still, Draco had put him on the list, and there must be some reason behind that, even if it was just to distance himself from his past and the prejudices of his father.
Draco shrugged, uncomfortable under her scrutiny. 'He - well, he knows Samael is a front … but he never really asked who I actually was …' He trailed off, aware that the excuse was flimsy. Harry hadn’t asked because the man he'd had all his dealings with - Samael Ladon - had given no indication that he knew Harry personally. That he, in fact, was the last person Harry Potter should ever trust, or be vulnerable in front of or reveal every single one of his deepest darkest fears and pains to.
Her confirmation sent his mind reeling, connections beginning to form faster than thought, as the threads of his research and the images from his dreams began to come together, finally forming into a picture he could understand.
The scene shimmered around them like smoke and faded as Harry fought against Malfoy watching him like this.
Harry's dad stepped forward, strong arms wrapping around him and bringing him close for a hug. Harry hugged him back, despite feeling he was getting a touch old for this. Then his dad clapped him on the back.
Harry curses as he realises there must be Silencing Charms on the house and there's not going to be a single thing he can get out of listening in.
Malfoy leaned over, eyes flicking over the pages, before he glanced away, dismissing them. Harry opened his mouth to argue with him - to make him see the danger.
'I've messed up,' he mumbled. 'I've done something stupid.' He glanced sideways again to see Hermione looking at his borrowed shirt, then back at his face, a question in her eyes. He nodded slightly and her face fell, as though he'd just confirmed her fears.
He shook his head. It was only Daniela's words about them that was making him think they were something more significant than a bunch of racist arseholes on a power trip. He couldn't create some worldwide conspiracy out of a chance conversation. That sort of thinking was exactly what Ron and Hermione had been so concerned about before he left. He remembered the sting of their pity and disappointment. He remembered Hermione's careful words about Mind Healers and rest time. They thought he was mad. They thought James' death had sent him off his rocker, had sent him chasing ghosts around the world.
, Harry remembered, wondering just when Malfoy had gotten out, and why the hell his mug was on the case board. He focussed in on the details, forcing his eyes away from the photo. Robards had changed the board to show a dingy bar, which Malfoy apparently ran now, as well as three headshots of people who had last been seen there. He ran his eyes over a list of substances, all legal, though some questionable, sold in Malfoy's bar. 'Dreaming Darkly.' Harry rolled his eyes; what a pretentious fucking name.
Harry leans back, knowing he needs to sell it. Merlin, but he hates the lie his life has become. Archer is right though. He
'You're welcome to come with me,' Hermione said. 'I was going into work for a few hours anyway. I'll meet you at the Ministry in thirty minutes?' She looked him up and down, a faint grin on her face. 'Once you've had a chance to … freshen up.'
'I won't take too much of your valuable time,' Draco said, unable to help the hint of disdain that crept into his tone. His father's eyes flashed slightly in response and Draco felt that tiny spark of satisfaction that riling his father still gave him, albeit, all wrapped in guilt and bitterness.
Harry nodded. He could imagine the scenario. He'd played a similar game against Ravenclaw in third year. But he'd long ago learned that comparing pro-league Holyhead Harpies games to Hogwarts Quidditch days glory didn't go down well.
Ladon's hand was slick and he moved it slowly up and down Harry's shaft, pulling his foreskin back and rubbing a thumb across the head of his cock with every stroke. Harry jerked and fucked up into it, unable to stop himself, animal need taking over. It felt so good. It - he needed it. Needed more. Faster. It was too much at the same time. Too sensitive. His whole body was tense, muscles locked as the intensity of the touch flooded over him.
Draco had read about what happened to Potter's husband—crushed to death by a dragon six months ago. It was all over the papers for weeks. Potter had disappeared after the funeral and his spectacular breakdown at the cemetery. There hadn't been a single sighting or interview since. That hadn't stopped the reporting, of course. The most popular theory was that Potter had abandoned the cottage where he'd lived in marital bliss and was holed up in the old Black house instead, though it was under a
Harry spent two days thinking and planning before he visited his London post box. He half-thought Ron might jump out of the shadows, but he opened it unmolested. He'd expected a letter back from Conor, but it was Aoife who had written to him. He wasn't surprised to see she wrote the way she spoke. It was pages and pages of information in a quick, scribbled hand. He skimmed it quickly.
Ron stopped, kicking at the ground. 'I know - I just - it shocked me, seeing you like that, you know? I mean, you never - What's wrong?
. It was apt, he thought dimly. They'd spent their whole lives saying that to each other, one way or another. He huffed out a laugh that sounded more like a sob. Harry meant it this time. Meant it in a way that he never had before. Draco had seen the cold certainty in his eyes. Harry would never forgive him for what he'd done.
Harry thought about it, sorely tempted. But Ron and Hermione hardly ever got to go out together, and they would have already made arrangements for the kids.
He shivered slightly, focusing back on Ladon's movements as he took the rope across her front again, over her breasts. Harry saw that her nipples were hardening and her breathing was coming quicker now. He bit his lip and watched the path of the rope as Ladon pushed her hands further up behind herself so her palms met and faced the ceiling, as though in a backward prayer.
'I could send you flying,' Malfoy said, as he turned to the door. 'Quidditch World Champion Harry Potter could be how you spend your day.' His voice was pleasant, but underneath it there was an edge of sharp mockery that Harry shied away from.
He could hear the telly in the other room and glanced around, hoping Ginny had left dinner out for him. His shoulders slumped when he couldn't see anything and he grabbed a slightly stale muffin from the tray beside the sink.
Pansy raised an eyebrow as though reading his thoughts and daring him. At that moment Scorpius realised he wasn't being chased anymore and whipped his head around, spotting Draco with a high pitched squeal of, 'Papa!'
He pushed that thought away. Ladon - Release - that would never be a path he could take again. Instead he thought of the only other place he could go when he wanted to escape. Wrapping his arms around himself, Harry Apparated from his house.
Harry hummed in agreement, though something about Malfoy's answer made him think there was more to it. He decided not to press. It was nice, sitting here together. Nice to be developing this strange, tentative sort of friendship.
He stood at the Apparition point around the corner from Ron and Hermione's cottage for a long moment, struggling to get himself under control. He wiped his hand over his mouth, the sensation of Ladon's lips against his, tongue twining with his, still strong. He closed his eyes for a moment, savouring it, remembering the passion in it. He didn't think he'd
Hallbrook laughs, as though Malfoy's just said something hilarious. Malfoy doesn't respond to the sound. He merely indicates he's going to reach into a pocket inside his waistcoat.
'Red or black?' Pansy said and Draco pushed himself up onto his elbows to see her standing in front of her closet wearing only a pair of skimpy lace knickers, with two dresses held up to her chest. He eyed them both, knowing from experience he couldn't get away with a flippant answer.
He deliberately doesn't think about the fact that he'll be seeing Malfoy when he's sleepy and ready for bed, or that he will smell like Malfoy after a day or two of living in such close proximity to him. These are things he will have to put up with to be able to do his job.
Harry looks sideways at Malfoy, who passes the driver some folded notes before opening his door and stepping out.
'I was the owner of this place, for a little while,' Malfoy says casually, as he looks at fabrics, running his fingers over them, then discarding them.
Hermione's mouth worked for a moment, soundlessly, and then she stepped forward, face lined with a desperate concern. 'You can't stop
scum.' Some of the things he'd read in the papers or in his letters from home had made him feel sick. Some days he felt like he was back at the breakfast table in the Great Hall, opening up the
He trailed off at the resigned look on her face. 'You know there's no point. They'll write what they write and …' She shrugged. 'You'd think I'd be used to it, after all these years, wouldn't you?'
Mr and Mrs Avery were hardly worth Blaise's time - they were still recovering from the post-war reparations owed by their family - but one never knew when the right relationship could come in handy. Draco watched a moment longer as Blaise sought out Mrs Fawley, detouring to collect a glass of the honeyed mead she was so partial too. As he touched her arm gently, Draco marveled again at what the full charm of Blaise Zabini could do to an unsuspecting woman - or man, he reflected bitterly, before pushing the thought away. Mrs Fawley was already far more relaxed, and her face was losing the hunted look she'd sported moments earlier.
Harry rolled his eyes slightly as he nodded yes. She scrunched her nose up at him, but said, 'You know I worry. Especially since you're alone now. These current cases, I can't imagine you're sleeping much?'
Draco smiles but it's a bleak one. 'I don't really want to be Draco Malfoy,' he says. Before Harry can respond to that—can even consider how to respond—Draco continues.
'Are you alright?' Harry asked softly, and Draco jerked his head up, with a startled sound, looking back at Harry.
Malfoy turns his head so that his cheek is pressed against Harry's, but the arousal fades from his scent, the sharpness of anger replacing it as he growls low in Harry's ear. 'Do I know the spells Aurors use to hunt wolves for sport? I'll give you one fucking guess.'
Harry left off kissing Draco's neck, pushing himself up onto one elbow and looking down on the spot with pleasure.
Draco just shook his head, the churning thoughts and fears rising back in him now that his son was safe and his immediate distraction was gone.
'That's a shame,' he said, 'I always did love watching you on a broom.' As the words left his mouth, Draco had a disconcerting moment where he felt like he could have said them from his own perspective. He shook it off. Staying in character was the number one rule Rosa had drilled into him: from the moment you take the Polyjuice to the moment it wears off, never deviate from the understanding that you
The meeting had spilled well into the afternoon and by the time Harry left it - having been told twice more that his 'narrow minded approach' was not 'forward thinking' - he was about ready to curse the next person who looked at him sideways.
Harry tightened his grip and focussed on down. That was all he had to do, get down and get through this.
Harry barely refrained from pointing out that the Ministry had basically been infiltrated by Death Eaters at that point and that they'd held the doors wide open for Voldemort to waltz on in whenever he pleased.
Harry turned the shower off and dressed slowly, climbing into bed with a tumult of thoughts swirling through his mind. He lay awake in the dark for a long time - in the bed that he shared with his wife of ten years. It was Christmas in a week. It was Christmas and he was about to ruin everything.
Ginny waved her hand as if to say it didn't matter and looked back over at the dumbbells, shifting from foot to foot.
His mate stands and for the first time Wolf smells his fear. He points at the tunnels and begins jabbering again, pulling at Wolf's arm. He pushes the man back against the wall and takes up a position in the middle of the room.
They're sitting in bed one day, a few months later, when the paper comes. It's a rare Sunday morning when Harry's not on a shift. Draco's been around the past week, almost to the point where Harry's considering asking him if everything is okay. They've been living together for the past five months and he doesn't think he's had Draco home four days in a row in that entire time.
'Scorpius is staying with Pansy's parents' on Tuesday night. Did you want to come around for dinner?' Draco asked, looking strangely nervous as he asked. Harry looked at him, wondering about the offer, and about the nervousness. He found it strange that Draco had specified Scorpius wouldn't be there. Then he thought further about it, pushing away the fog in his mind. Was Draco asking him around … as a date?
Harry raises his hand to his face as he breathes in the scent of Malfoy on his skin and thinks about the imprint of teeth on his neck. He'd clearly wanted to fuck Malfoy—had attempted to, by the looks of it. And Malfoy had wanted it, or been turned on by it. So why had he resisted?
'Good boy,' Ladon replied and Harry felt that same shiver of warmth at the words - the approval behind them.
Malfoy just shrugs, seemingly unaffected by the fact that he's trapped underground with a werewolf about to turn. Harry needs to make him see sense. Needs him to listen. To be safe.
'Denied,' Marchbanks said, voice implacable. 'Leading is acceptable while under Veritaserum. Mr. Malfoy can only answer in statements that are true.'
Harry slashed his hand to cut Malfoy off and the fireplace flared bright and hot as his magic surged around them again. Malfoy's eyes flicked to it for a moment and then he took a step backwards, toward the room his son was in.
Malfoy's hands pull him closer for just a second—just long enough for Harry to picture how it would feel to lick and bite his way down Malfoy's body—then he yelps as a Stinging Jinx hits him on the arse. He pulls back and looks down at Malfoy.
But to Harry the sounds are crystal clear and after the second time it happens, it hits Harry what Malfoy is doing. He's edging himself, and the thought sends a surge of arousal through him that has pre come dribbling from his cock. Harry slides his thumb through it, the sharp scent of sex in the air driving his need higher. He lifts a knee to tent the blankets and starts touching himself in time with Malfoy's movements, drawing out the sweet torture in the same way.
he about to cut things off between them? The thought of it made his heartbeat pound in his chest, and his breathing came faster as he reacted to the shock of the idea. Harry couldn't leave him. Draco had only just gotten him. After all these years of bitter wanting, he finally had something bright and good. He finally had Harry all to himself. He couldn't loose that. Not so soon.
Potter moaned again and licked at Draco's mouth, seeking entry. His kiss was sloppy in its need, but Draco couldn't help but respond. He had Harry Potter in his arms, heavy in his lap. He'd wanted this for more years than he could remember. He could admit to himself, in this moment, that he'd wanted this even through all the anger and hate that had followed the war.
Harry shook his head. He didn’t want to deal with anything else right now. Didn’t want to take in another thought - another change. He felt like he was going to burst out of his skin, his magic sparking all over him, its reaction with Ladon's making him feel feverish and reckless.
Harry took another drag and closed his eyes as he felt the edge of his grief, his constant awareness of it, begin to dull. It never went away, never, but when he smoked, he came the closest to feeling like he might survive it, one day.
'Fuck,' Harry rasped. 'Fuck, Charlie.' A sob escaped Harry's throat and he clenched his eyes shut as he slammed himself down on Draco's cock one last time before he started to come, the hot splashes of his release coating Draco's stomach.
It happened again and again. Harry tried analysing the cloak. It had never had that power before. But not long after he took it off, he got a crawling feeling on the back of his neck, like something was watching him. It made him realise just how long he'd been living with that feeling without even noticing it. He'd put the cloak straight back on and changed positions immediately.
. He never had been any good at tracking Apparition. He stared at the place Malfoy had disappeared from a moment longer, before he cursed to himself again and turned away. There was no point trying to guess where he'd gone to now. Harry would just have to track him that night. Nine o'clock, he'd said. At the Plaza.
Clearly they've been made, and Harry can't help but feel a trace of guilt that this is his fault—that Davies has sent someone after them because of the way Harry reacted at the meeting the day before. But he doesn't have time for those sorts of thoughts.
. I can't imagine anything worse ever happening, but no one caused it. It was an accident.' Ron placed a gentle hand on Harry's arm. 'You know this, I know you do.'
'You do that, pet,' Dahlia said with a sharp-toothed grin. 'He's booked up for the next month, but you do that.'
. He may or may not have remembered Malfoy taking his fair share of sweets every time the Hogwarts elves served it up. Pheo slid out of his shirt and onto the ledge. Harry turned his attention to her as she inspected the items one by one. She curled around to hiss at Harry.
Ladon pushed the tip of it against his stomach and Harry felt a sharp flare of pain in response. He sucked in his breath as the feeling shuddered through him. He felt his arousal spike again in reaction to the touch. He tried to push it away … and at the same time he wanted to feel it again.
'No,' he says, making his voice definite. 'I'll heal. I'm fine. No hospitals.' He can't afford to be checked into Mungos. They'll know what he is the moment they run the first set of tests on him. He'll be fine.
Draco - Malfoy, he reminded himself, shaking his head - was leaning against the wall at the foot of his alcove, arms crossed as he watched Harry wake up. Harry shook his head, trying to clear the grogginess away. He could have sworn, for a second, that the face of the boy he'd just flown with smiled out at him, young and happy.
Malfoy's scowled again and his cheeks tinged with the faintest of red. Harry felt a confused swirl of emotion in response to it. Was Malfoy
She turned to face them, leaning against the counter and bringing her mug up to her lips, blowing lightly as she arched an eyebrow at them both.
He needs to find out Malfoy's aim in meeting Davies, he knows. He needs to understand the talk of a market. Harry looks again over the farm, trying to see if there are any details that give away a connection to Malfoy's business in the strip club the night before. To his eye, everything looks exactly as it should, and that, coupled with the strength of the wards around the house, makes him more suspicious than ever.
'What have they conned you into today?' he asked with a smile. His dad looked up at him, but rather than speaking, he just trumpeted his trunk. Archie let out a high-pitched squeal of laughter.
He glared up at the circle, cut through by a diamond and two triangles. He had no idea what the image meant but just the sight of it set rage simmering inside him. He turned his head away and kept riding. This was not his fight. He had a job to do and there was nothing he could help with here.
'Thank you for seeing me, sir. I hope I can be of some help. I don't know if it was important, what I saw. It's hard for me to remember, these days, you see. But Mr Potter here said it could be, so of course I was happy to come in.'
Harry closed his eyes and let out a shuddering breath. He put his drink down on the table with a thunk, opened his eyes and reached for Draco.
'The letters were screened extensively for the first five years or so,' he said, striving to make his voice professional - authoritative. Draco frowned slightly and Harry wondered what he was thinking. He continued speaking. 'Nothing changed though, nothing happened. In the end I assume his threat level was downgraded. I'm pretty sure it's one of the Junior Auror jobs nowadays. I don’t think it's been given much attention for years.'
Harry shook his head. He didn’t want to wear it. He felt stifled by it. The costume was already too much. 'Don’t worry about it. It didn’t cover my scar anyway, so it's not like there would have been much point.'
War was inside him. Harry reminded himself of that. Malfoy looked normal, but that didn't mean anything. He brought the image of the Seal to his mind as he prepared to cast, touching the newly tattooed design running down the centre of his chest, from his collarbone to his navel. The Seal of Scattering was second from the top and Harry felt it warm under his fingertips as he called on it.
He'd spoken at the Malfoys' trials. Not Lucius, but the other two. He'd appeared in the gallery - listened to the accusations and rebuttals. Draco Malfoy had watched him intensely through the whole thing. When Harry stood to speak about Malfoy Manor, about the Forest and about the hesitation all throughout the last years of the war, Malfoy had stared at him with a kind of shocked curiosity.
he did this,' Ron said grimly. 'We have his magical signature on file from his trial. It matches every single one of the deaths.'
Instead he concentrated, thinking of the tracing spell he'd put on Malfoy's wand the night before. Malfoy was still in the same place, in his suite at The Plaza. Harry felt another pang of guilt as he sat down to wait, focusing on the spell so that he would know when Malfoy moved. He tried to push the feeling to one side. Mac was right. He couldn't help anyone if he got caught up in the struggles below.
'Yes?' he said, aiming for professional politeness. The hint of a smirk on Malfoy's face told him he may have missed it slightly.
I take two steps forward and grab the glass out of his hand. He gestures to the armchair opposite him, and I hesitate only a moment before sitting. This whole thing is putting me on edge. I need to push the right buttons to finish it, but I have no idea what to expect from him. There's no universe in which I had imagined I might ever sit down with Potter for a drink and a chat after he saw me working one night.
The shower is only a foot away now, through one thin wall, and Harry can hear Malfoy even more easily. His movements are slow and his breath hitches on every third stroke. Harry wonders if he has a certain technique he likes to use, the way Harry likes to tease himself sometimes, dragging his nails up his shaft and pinching his foreskin lightly.
. The thought of being away, cut off, for five weeks makes the anxiety rise higher. His heart beats harder in his chest and he feels something shrink inside him, whimpering faintly. He needs to ground himself more frequently than that. Needs to be around his… people.
about it - about men - it's just … there'd never been a time when he could see where the thoughts went. He'd returned from the war to Ginny's welcoming arms eleven years ago, and that had been that.
Harry shuddered and pushed his way out of bed. He didn't want the lights off again. He didn't want to lie in the darkness and remember any part of that. He considered heading into the living room and flicking the telly on, but he felt too jittery. Instead he looked across at his case wall. The sight of something purposeful - meaningful - helped him to feel settled. He looked over it, grounding himself, then he dressed, disillusioned it, and wrote himself the notes again, explaining what he should and shouldn't know and what to do when he returned. Then he turned his wand on himself, blanking his memories after the bar, replacing them with sleep and a driving need just to see his family and live his dreams again.
Malfoy paused at the bar. 'Do you want Dreamless to put you under?' he asked, gesturing at the shelves. 'Or something else?'
'Most of the others hated it and used to block it off with curtaining spells. I loved it.' He let his shirt fall to the ground and dropped his hands to his belt, fumbling it with his trembling fingers. He wanted to turn and look at Harry, but he thought that if he did, he might lose his courage after all.
. What is he thinking? Malfoy can never know about him. He pushes all of that away and focuses on Malfoy's reflection.
No, Malfoy being in proximity to Harry is ludicrous, unless, of course, Malfoy is an investigative journalist. Unless the story of just why Harry Potter had suddenly quit the Aurors to live the life of a reclusive bodyguard operating under a glamour was one that any paper in Britain would kill to publish.
He was reviewing the case board for the Bright crash when Ron came in. They still hadn't figured out why he'd done it, but they were confident it was an isolated attack. The
At those words, Malfoy's face hardens and he looks at Harry. 'You can't tell anyone, Potter. Ever.' His words are slow and deliberate and Harry has no doubt he means what he says. 'I'll
'Something needs to jolt him out of it,' Hermione yelled. 'Something strong enough to change his mood.'
Talking jobs had been the only thing stopping him from drinking himself right into a box alongside James, he knew. At least when he was studying a curse, trying to figure out the best way to rip it apart before it got him first, he could make his brain stop, just for a second. And maybe, yes, he was taking more risks than he had in recent years. Maybe he was acting a little like he had back before he and Ginny had hooked up again. Before they'd found out about James. But so what. He was trying. He was doing the best he fucking could.
Harry rushed forward as the room stabilised, throwing his arms around Draco. He felt Draco embrace him hard in turn and he buried his face in Draco's neck, breathing in the scent of him. He could feel the emotion surging in him, months of pain and regret, anger and fear. He felt tears rise in his eyes and he let them fall, gasping into Draco's skin. Draco just held him tighter, shushing him gently. Slowly, inch by inch, Harry could feel the loss begin to bleed away.
'Your only other choice, the one that I would recommend, is that you keep it a secret and cut all contact with him. You remove yourself - both your selves - from his life completely.'
Harry stifles a growl and begins to pace. He can't help it now. The wolf needs to run, to stretch its legs. It wants to hunt in the caves and the forest above.
'Good,' he said, going to collect the case, 'let's see how you go with a whole flock of snitches then, shall we?'
'The way he touched me made it clear he would, next time he saw me,' Malfoy says, and his eyes take a on a distant look before he snaps back to the present.
'What was that?' Harry asks, taking another deep breath and then stepping more quickly so he's walking at Malfoy's side.
Her eyes linger on the exposed skin from the v of his shirt and Harry feels like clicking his fingers in her face. He clears his throat and her eyes jerk up to his.
Harry Apparates inside the wards of the Weasley's front garden. It's late, after eleven, and he wants to go straight up to his room—Ron's old room—which smells of home and comfort and family. All he needs right now is to bury himself under blankets and lick his wounds. He needs to forget the moon exists, forget Malfoy exists, and forget the madness that is his life now.
The group moved in a more or less orderly fashion out the front doors and onto the street, where they milled around in front of a large double-decker bus. Harry eyed it, wondering if it had any magical relationship to the Knight Bus, but it seemed to be perfectly Muggle. He could see many of the parents wondering the same thing, as they climbed aboard and nothing moved or shifted around them.
In the end, there was no choice at all. Draco shifted Scorpius to one side and held out his hand, leaving it hanging in the air, an echo of the many times they'd tried to form this bond between them.
This is a very intense time to be writing this story, so I hope you will forgive me the gap between posting.
Harry looks at the manila folder on the desk in front of him. He feels an itch under his skin—the same itch that he gets whenever he contemplates sitting inside Grimmauld Place with nothing to occupy his mind or his body. It makes him think of booze and darkness. If he doesn't take the job, he'll piss Archer off. And if he pisses Archer off, he might not get another job. He'll figure something out. Five weeks can be managed. He has his potion for when the time comes, after all.
. He doesn't know how to deal with the surge of emotion rising in him. Draco wouldn't want anything to do with him now—if he ever had. Harry had almost assaulted him the night before. He's a monster. Despite what Draco says, Harry knows Draco wouldn't have been able to stop him.
wandless, the fucker. The motion makes my pulse race. From fear, mainly. I've been locked inside a room with a john more than once, and Potter is no ordinary john. I drop my hand to brush against the can of mace in my pocket, knowing as I do that this time, it won't help me. I choose not to examine the part of my reaction that's not fear. That part can fuck right off.
'She's right,' Blaise said at his back. 'Potter's a Gryffindor. They love to fight and chase and to have big in-your-face declarations of love.'
Harry pauses, he can't help himself. He at least owes it to Draco to listen to what he has to say, doesn't he? But when Draco speaks, he takes a totally different approach, as though the kiss had never happened.
The doors slammed open at his raised hand and a man in Dahlia's customary place looked up in surprise, which turned to alarm as he took in Harry's brooding form, the tension in his face - the air of power that flickered around him. Harry strode to the desk, putting both hands on it and glaring down.
I let my breath out in an unsteady rush and Potter's eyes flick to my mouth for just an instant, just long enough that I know he's registered that he had an effect on me. Prick. I'm better than this. I decide exactly how my body responds. I decide who gets what from me.
Malfoy seemed resigned to seeing him when he turned up at the bar, but he took Harry's money all the same.
'This doesn't change anything,' Harry said, looking at the case again, that same hint of curiosity at its contents tickling at him.
'You have a Dark Mark,' Harry said, wondering as it came out of his mouth what he was trying to do with that statement. Malfoy was hardly likely to take Edgar into his confidence after twenty seconds of conversation. He felt his anger growing, but it was directed at himself this time. He tried to push it away. He could do this. He knew he could. The only reason he hadn't got any breaks was because Robards was a twat and was holding him back. He could do this.
His photo had been on the Criminals at Large board in the Auror Wing for years after that, until he'd finally been declared a cold case. Harry had had to look into that sneering, arrogant fucking face every day for
'And once, in the distance, I saw the merfolk come to play with the squid...' Draco stopped speaking as he realised what that process must have been. The spawning cycle.
He looked back at the array of leather straps, at Ladon's confident stance as he watched Harry, running the flogger through his fingers, again and again as though he had all the time in the world.
'I thought you wanted to question me about the attacks?' Malfoy said, looking down his nose at Murphy, ignoring the rest, as though they were worth even less of his attention.
again. It's six hours until moonrise. They'd spent at least an hour walking down here the day before.
Harry is surprised to see, when they land, that they're back in Grimmauld Place. They hadn't discussed where they would spend the night, but Harry had assumed Draco would take them to another of his safe houses.
He didn't even have to tell Harry to strip, he was doing it as soon as the door had closed, piling his clothes neatly on the chair. This room was bare but for a cupboard on the wall and a myriad of hooks at all heights and angles. The floor here was carpeted - Draco used magic to get it truly clean - but he preferred the surface when he had people kneeling or lying before him.
He sighed and began to sing softly - one of the songs his mother had taught him, so long ago. The thought of her put a faint echo of loss on his thoughts, turning them melancholy. He knew he was dropping from the high - dropping badly - but couldn't give himself a reason to stop.
He pushes himself to his hind legs as he steps into the cavern, lit up by the light of a stick. The one he hunts stands in the middle, stick by his side. He doesn't smell of rank fear the way he should. His gaze is steady, silver eyes shining in the darkness. He is wary, ready to fight, but he holds still. He watches.
'At least let me wrap it,' Malfoy says as Harry stands beside the Land Rover, steeling himself to climb into it.
He pushed away from the wall, shaking his head to ground himself. He needed to get closer, to see Malfoy's face, to hear what he was talking about. He wouldn't be able to exclude him from the list by looking at the back of his head.
Then Harry came home from work one day, tense and tight-lipped. When Draco questioned him, he refused to say anything, going to bed early and feigning sleep when Draco joined him. The next morning, before he left for work, he asked Draco to go out with him that night, with no other details than that he would be home late, and Draco should be ready at 10pm. It was a strange request, even from Harry.
'Actually I … want to formally apologise for my actions towards both of you in the past,' he said. 'I should have done it before now. I treated you both really badly and you have no reason to help me now. So I'm sorry, and thank you.'
He gestured to a golden sphere on the table to their right and Harry recognised it immediately. It was a Time-Turner, far larger and more ornamental than the one Hermione had used in school.
'You can't put your life on hold, Harry. Leave from work is a good idea, but you'll have to face that again soon. Taking some space from being around your friends and family can be healthy too, but you're already re-establishing and strengthening those connections. You're already seeing that you draw strength and support from others. If this is a connection you want in your life, you need to pursue it to make it happen.'
'You went to a shop,' War continued, and Harry could do nothing but listen, desperate to know, at last what had happened. 'It was an antiques shop, a new one. Draco's shop, it turns out, though he operates it under a different name,' War said, watching Harry's face, clearly enjoying his reactions.
'You won't tell anyone,' Malfoy repeated. 'Or I'll spread your pathetic, fucked-up life as far as I possibly can, and do as much damage as I can with it.'
Draco sniggered and then looked contrite, as though he shouldn't be laughing at Harry's friend in front of him. Harry laughed too. It
It had taken Draco a full day to create an undetectable portal between the door to his Simulacrum studio and an empty field in countryside Dartmoor. He'd set up Muggle repellent charms and glamoured the site to look exactly the same as the field behind Potter and Charlie's house. He knew it was exactly the same because he'd spent two hours outside Potter's currently-abandoned house, combing over the field and examining it from all angles. It was lucky that the
Harry watched the place Malfoy had disappeared from and thought about how all of his memories and all of Malfoy's actions kept pointing him back to the same place.
Harry laughed. 'That's magic use in a Muggle area,' he said, affecting a serious tone. 'And in front of the Head Auror, no less.'
'Merry Christmas,' he says in return, interrupting the spiralling flow of my thoughts. His smile widens as he bites into the toastie.
Malfoy's bar wasn't hard to find. He'd placed it on the border between magical and Muggle London. Harry wondered, as he climbed out of the taxi, throwing the driver twice what his trip had been worth, whether Malfoy's clients came from both worlds as well. Those who had disappeared - those they knew of - were all wizards. The idea that Malfoy could be using his bar to lure Muggles to their death - to keep the same Death Eater ideology alive - sent a wave of hot anger through him.
'I just want you back,' Harry said, and in his voice Draco heard an ocean of grief so deep he knew he could drown in it. 'I kill everyone I love and I never get them back.'
He measured the next length of rope and looped it again, creating another knot a few finger widths down. He pulled the excess into two large loops, and slid Harry's hands into them, one by one. Draco slid the rope up his arms, until it pulled tight against Harry's biceps, then he looped it again and again, creating the knots and pulling the ties up on Harry's arms.
Harry's eyes widened and he felt his heart ratchet in his chest. He looked up and met Malfoy's silver eyes, seeing something reflected in them that he couldn't quite name.
They station one Auror at each of the estates that have previously been used as auction sites. Ron argues vehemently against Harry going in alongside Markwell to whichever site is chosen on the day. Harry tells him flat out that is how it's happening or the whole thing is off. If he'd had hackles he would have raised them, and he welcomes his wolf to the forefront of his mind as he stares Ron down.
The thought made him frown and he glanced around the room, checking to make sure he had everything. His next stop was his room, where he gathered the few changes of clothes he took on every trip. His invisibility cloak. The more extensive potions kit he took for long range field first aid.
Draco stepped up to Harry's side, putting a hand on his arm. 'It will only be an issue if you fight against it. Basically, Maggie will use a spell to pull the excess energy from the time continuum out of you and into the turner.'
The echo of his pain at being told that pulled at him but Harry concentrated on the feel of Ladon's arms around him and the sound of Ladon's heartbeat under his cheek. Speaking seemed easy - easier now than it ever had. He didn’t let himself wonder why that was - why he’d barely talked to anyone about this. Ron and Hermione knew … but sympathy from people with their own children was bitter comfort.
on the wall that reads two am. Harry takes a step forward, but Draco shakes his head again in a clear indication Harry should stay where he is. Harry frowns as he watches Draco leave the room but then Banks asks him a question and he turns his attention back to the list of names in front of him.
Blake clicked a few more buttons and a bio came up. 'He's President Johnson's Senior Military Advisor,' Blake said. 'Why?'
'The Aurors said it was an accident,' she said when she opened them. Harry met her gaze and deep within it he saw an echo of his own certainty, that something was wrong in the world and only he knew what it was.
It's been far too long since he got laid, clearly. Twelve months, maybe longer. But since the incident he hasn't even tried to pull. Hasn't touched anyone intimately. Has barely even touched himself that way.
Draco stopped for a moment, pushing away the old guilt and regret. Then he took a deep, steadying breath and reached for another bottle.
As he felt the drowsiness begin to take over, Malfoy came to sit on the edge of the bed and Harry felt a soft touch down the side of his face.
, came Pheo's hiss from inside his shirt. But it was quiet and sluggish. Harry frowned, his anger at Malfoy not abating. He was about to start hunting for him when Hermione and Ron came pushing through his office door.
Harry, according to Hermione, was that bait. He didn't know if he quite believed her, until he started catching glimpses of flapping black robes from the corner of his eye again. Malfoy was still hanging around Magic Reversal. Trying to sabotage their ongoing attempts to fix the weather? Harry thought again about what Hermione had said about
Harry opens the file. It's the fifth he's received since he started at PROtego a few months ago. This one is like all the others. A headshot, the particulars of the person he's assigned to, and a description of what they've come to PROtego looking for. Harry scans it quickly.
Ron winced for a moment, but he didn't let up on his stern expression. 'I still need to ask you some questions.'
'I know,' Draco said with another sigh. 'You could add intelligent. He's incredibly good at keeping information about himself hidden.'
Malfoy breaks his gaze as he pulls his phone out and checks something. His cheeks have darkened slightly and Harry can hear his heartbeat. It's slightly faster than normal. Harry would attribute it to the short climb but Malfoy had been fine when he jumped.
Malfoy cocked his head to one side, considering. 'Strange. Daphne's never mentioned anything that happened on a trip that could be remotely significant enough to cause one of the Muggles they deal with to want to attack the group. If it had come from a wizard, I could almost believe it.'
Ladon - Draco - cast a Patronus, sending it to Pansy's parents, telling them he wouldn't be collecting Scorpius until morning. Then he reached out. There was a crack and a sickening lurch, and they were standing somewhere altogether different. Harry looked around the familiar space of Draco's living room. Draco turned and flicked his wand and the lights brightened, the fire flaring back to life. Harry's gaze was caught by the strange hesitancy on Ladon's face and he took a step closer.
There was a long pause, and Harry expected a sneer or a taunt, but when Malfoy spoke his voice was respectful - measured. 'I'm sorry to hear that. It - there's no hope of getting back together?'
What did any of this have to do with the figure on the horse? Were they even connected? The only thing he had to go on was the words of the DeathKeeper.
I freeze, shock slamming through me as I take him in—shaggy black hair, bright green eyes, that coiled energy as though, even sitting, he's ready to unleash hell on the nearest perp... on people like me.
'He's gone. Someone took him. At seven. Over two hours ago. They thought it was me -' he said, gesturing to Mr. and Mrs. Parkinson. Malfoy's mouth twisted into a hard line as he glared at Harry. 'But I was busy wasting everyone's time to satisfy
Something unreadable passed across Ladon's face at Harry's response and his eyes narrowed, as though it hadn't been what he expected.
'Gods, Harry. You feel amazing,' Draco groaned. He felt his climax approaching with a strength that threatened to drown him. 'Better than I ever—'
The Plaza wasn't warded, but Harry could tell that a number of the security staff were Wizards, just by watching them. He didn't bother trying to make his way up to Malfoy's room. He knew it would have protections he couldn't breach by himself. Instead he stood against the wall in a place which would give him a clear view of the door, and settled in to watch.
Wolf whines again and then the stick is out and his mate is touching him. The world blurs and twists.
Harry shrugged, feeling uncomfortable. He'd only ever talked to Ron and Hermione about this - and Ginny knew some of it, but not the full extent. But Malfoy had seen what he'd done, and he hadn’t told anyone. 'I haven't for a long time. I carry it more for appearances than anything. So I don't draw more attention …' he let his voice trail off, remembering how Malfoy had accused him for years of chasing attention and fame. But Malfoy showed no indication of revisiting those days, instead he watched Harry intently.
'If you think you're capable of doing this job, then I will require absolute discretion while I complete my business in London,' he says. 'One of the reasons I work with your company, such as it is, is that I know I will have no questions asked of me, or tales told of me afterwards. I trust that remains true?'
They'd had teams searching the Muggle man's lorry and house for further clues about his identity and motives. They'd duplicated both crime scenes and then left the Muggle Police a copy that didn't include photos of witches and wizards who existed on none of their databases.
'To combat your enemies, you need to bring every possible force at your disposal to bear. You and I both know this. What harm is there, in gaining something you want, to help confirm that choice in your mind?'
It wasn't the House's fault that most of his worst memories lived here – that no matter the rooms it redecorated, the fires it lit, the windows it opened, all he could smell was death and all he could feel was darkness.
'Harry,' he groaned between kisses. 'Fuck. Harry. Wanted you.' He returned his attention to Harry's mouth, teasing his swollen lips with his teeth. 'Wanted this. So long.'
They both look around the room, re-locking all of the cabinets and checking everything is as they left it, then Harry pulls the cloak around himself again.
Harry felt the power of that cry echo through his bones. It surged through him, urging him to fight, to overpower, to dominate and take his place as king. He could feel the way the call hit the crowd, the sound of the cries around him turning immediately, becoming dark and vicious.
do you think you're doing? Does the Statute of Secrecy not actually apply to the famous Harry Potter?'
Malfoy's face darkened as though he'd just picked the thought out of Harry's mind, and Harry realised with a start he probably had. He wondered if his shields were up.
It was from Jonas Fauster, one of the men he'd used to freelance for occasionally. It listed a few jobs and what they were paying. Harry scanned down the list quickly. He was about to put it aside when he noticed one based in Sedlec, an hour from where he was. His eyes flicked over the details.
'Who watches me?' Harry said, not wanting to entertain the idea, but needing to know at the same time.
Draco hissed a sharp breath. He reached one hand out as though to touch Harry, but he dropped it, almost as though forcing himself not to.
'I also … died,' he said, glancing at Malfoy to see how he would take the news. Malfoy sucked in a breath and his eyes jerked to Harry's, shock in them morphing into understanding, as though he'd just had long-held thoughts confirmed.
He was at the doorway before a final thought occurred to him, and he looked back, searching for any indication of who the club catered to. 'Is this - I'm quite well known in … some circles. Is this a W-' He couldn't quite bringing himself to say the word, but Dahlia seemed to understand, her eyes widening in the first hint of surprise he'd seen from her.
- was what he'd been missing, and the thought sent grief flooding through him. He wished he were more aware in the dreams - more able to direct his actions. He would have held his kids close, breathed them in and told them he loved them and that he would never let them go.
He's still sitting at the table, wearing charcoal trousers and a light blue shirt. Harry takes in the way his waistcoat hugs his body before he rolls his eyes at the pretentiousness of wearing a fucking
He moved closer again, pressing harder against his aching cock, rubbing himself through his trousers as he reached out to run his hand down Harry's back, over the lean, defined muscles. His hand passed through Harry's body, the wisps of memory breaking and reforming around his touch, but even that imaginary stroke had him rubbing harder at himself.
The moment he considered it, he knew that was where he wanted to be. Before he had a chance to think twice about it, he had stuck his head in the Floo and was calling Draco's name.
many times before,' Conor said. 'They're part of a cycle of life and death, chaos and stagnation. We can stop them again. We just need to understand where they will be next. We think War has manifested in an agent—there is a lot of activity in America, in the New York region, in particular, that is out of the ordinary. But we haven't managed to link it to an individual and we haven't sighted Plague at all yet.'
Harry was standing in the middle of Central Park, on a broad, paved walkway, with huge trees to either side, their branches reaching toward the sky.
He throws his leather jacket over the back of the couch, kicks his boots off near the door, and enters his bedroom, collecting his toiletry bag from his rucksack and the towel from his bed.
A quick shower and a change of clothes later and he felt semi-human, if in need of something to eat. He felt lightheaded and knew it was because of the way he'd been abusing his body lately. He tidied the room with a quick flick of his wand and headed downstairs, stealing an egg muffin from the bain-marie on his way back out the door. This, at least, didn't make him want to gag, and he was able to finish it quickly.
'From what we understand,' Jeffries was saying, 'there's another layer within the bar - something we're not seeing. The number of patrons who move in and out of the space is not equivalent to the number we see frequenting the public bar space.'
Harry looked into Draco Malfoy's eyes, then he screwed up his courage, uncorked the bottle and swallowed its contents down. He felt the milky taste wash over his tongue and the effects spread through his body almost instantly. His head sagged forward and Malfoy caught him, murmuring quiet words as he laid Harry back on the stretcher, arranging his arms and legs comfortably. Harry spared another thought for how strange it was to have Malfoy touching him with something that wasn't a fist, or a boot.
Harry moves over to the windows and sits in his favourite chair. He has a view out over the water from it, and watching the sun rise is something he has a new appreciation for, after spending the last few weeks with Malfoy. Harry's never been an early riser, but somehow having someone in his space and the sounds and scents of drinks being brewed in the background makes the practice more appealing.
Harry looked up as a scuff of carpet indicated Draco was entering the room. He had Harry's collar held in one hand and a coil of rope in the other, and the look on his face was hot and full of wanting. His eyes raked over Harry's body as though he owned it … until he reached Harry's face, and their eyes met, and suddenly Harry could see a hint of uncertainty. He realised that this was new for Draco too - this was the first time he had done this with Harry knowing him, and wanting him, for himself.
He jumped down, moving across the bodies, trying to keep his footing so he didn't have to touch them with his hands.
Veritas is a legend in the Ministry. A ghost. Five of the biggest cases they'd cracked in the last decade had been due to investigations undertaken and released to the press by a person known only as Veritas—
He whirled, embarrassed to have been caught unaware, and took in the sight of the man who had just entered the room. Samael Ladon looked to be in his late thirties, a few inches taller than Harry was, with jet black hair and high, aristocratic cheekbones. He was dressed in a modification of a sharp Muggle suit, buttoned to the neck, and he exuded class and power. But it was his eyes that caught Harry's attention. They were a hard, icy blue, and they were fixed unwaveringly on him.
'So the weather went haywire a few days ago because no one's looking after it?' Harry asked, not sure what the problem was. They just needed to put another PRAT onto the spell, surely.
He felt shock jolt through him when Malfoy turned back to the empty room, eyes casting about it. As he watched, Malfoys posture and expression seemed to change, as though he were shedding a skin. Suddenly Malfoy's eyes were too bright, his smile too wide. He slowly cocked his head to one side in a movement that made Harry think of a raptor hunting. There was nothing human about it. Abruptly, Harry knew he was looking into the face of War.
'Have you heard the latest?' he asks, as he reaches for a piece of toast. Harry wants to growl at him. This is food his mate provided for him. Instead he reminds his wolf that Ron is their second and that Harry's food is pack food. The wolf subsides with a discontented snap of his jaws.
'I gather from your lower score for humiliation that you're not interested in words like slut and whore either?'
Harry shook himself, trying to focus. He'd been all over the place since he'd seen Malfoy's head shot the day before. Something about Malfoy's eyes just wouldn't leave his mind. He wished for a moment he'd dug a joint out before he took the taxi, just to settle his nerves. It had been a long time since he'd been in the field, since the early days where active cases had been destroyed by rushing fans wanting a piece of the Saviour - since he'd misjudged his Polyjuice and transformed part way through a raid, leaving Jeffries undefended to take a hex that had him in Mungo's for months. Harry took a deep breath, shaking his head and focussing on what he could see, trying to ground himself.
'That's it. Another?' Malfoy's voice and face are calm. There's not a hint of mockery or censure in his voice. Instead, he's focused intently on Harry's face. Harry looks at him, needing to see the real him.
Somehow Harry could feel the moment Malfoy understood the situation - his satisfaction, laced with annoyance, as he realised Harry had acted alone, that no one knew where he was.
Draco opens his mouth to make an undoubtedly cutting remark, but then he takes in Harry's appearance, naked except for the towel slung low around his hips. His eyes flick over Harry's body in a quick appraisal which he can't hide.
At Harry's sharp look, Draco stopped. 'Seriously, Potter - still? It made sense because Muggles were hunting magical folk and murdering them, and so sharing the secret of your magic with a Muggle was a probable death sentence. That's why. Not …' Draco took a deep breath.
He looked up as his empty plate shifted in front of him, to see Draco levitating the dishes into the sink.
Draco spent a sleepless night trying to think about what he wanted to do with the information he now knew. He had to make Potter pay, didn't he? He'd dreamt of bringing Potter down into the dirt alongside him for years.
Harry nods, but then continues, needing to make sure Malfoy understands his full point. 'Davies, though, it's not because he's a were,' Harry says and Malfoy's face darkens again. 'It's not,' Harry insists. 'He's dangerous and he wants you.'
'Why do you do this?' Harry asked, shuffling forward so he was sitting on the edge of the bed. He had been thinking about it on and off, since the first time he'd walked through the door. Just what was the appeal of spooling out dreams and memories and fantasies in people's heads.
His back is so hot. It feels like lines of fire are radiating out from it. Malfoy's magic is cool on his skin, soothing. He looks over his shoulder to see Malfoy looking down at his back with an expression of concern. He speaks the spell again and Harry closes his eyes as he feels the same wash of coolness over his skin.
talks about can't be the real story. Childhood sweetheart. Dashing Auror. Ministry Darling. Is that why you did it all - to give the rest of the wizarding world a fairy tale? The happy ending that everyone wanted after the war - if Harry Potter could have it, so could they? Is that what it was?'
Luna blinked, her only reaction to his anger. 'Of course. We all would. It's something Ron and Hermione asked of us when you disappeared. If you made contact with anyone, we were to let them know, straight away.'
'Proceed,' she said, and Harry wished again that they could just dose him up and ask him straight out if he planned the whole thing. But there was no way Marchbanks would allow such a flagrant challenge to the law in her courtroom.
Harry sighed, pushed his glasses up and rubbed a tired hand over his eyes as he reached for the item at the top of the pile. He pulled it onto his desk with a thud and glanced at the title.
He brought his hands up to Draco's arse, cupping it, pulling his cheeks apart as he thought about how he was inside Draco, how his cock was sliding in and out of him.
Harry shrugs, affecting nonchalance. 'I'm being paid to be here. I may as well make myself useful. Maybe I could lift some heavy things for you?' He makes himself smirk, though he wants to throw Malfoy into a wall. Being around him is infuriating.
Draco's posture slumped at this. Any feelings Harry may have been developing would be long gone now, burned away by his rage at Draco's betrayal. Blaise reached out to put a comforting hand on Draco's arm, squeezing lightly.
Harry moaned at the feeling, unable to stop himself from jerking forward. Malfoy's mouth was relentless, bringing him to the edge harder and faster than he ever had in his life. Within a minute he was crying out and spilling down Malfoy's throat.
He turned up at their house that evening. Pansy had known where it was - the things she knew sometimes disturbed him. He'd left Scorpius sleeping soundly; the two of them were still staying at Parkinson Estate. Getting his wards repaired was turning out to be a more complex process than he'd expected.
What was he doing? What had he done? He washed the evidence down the drain, trying to ignore the bliss still shivering through him.
'I was … connected to Voldemort for a long time.' He reached up, tracing his fingers down the scar that started at his hairline and ran in jagged lines down his forehead, over his eye and down onto his cheek. The old scar was a familiar thin ridge of pain and loss.
When they come downstairs only Banks and Ron are there. Ron stands, crossing the room to Harry and gripping him in a hard hug. 'Thank Merlin, you're alright. We saw the man you killed, and then you disappeared. I had no idea if you were hurt.' He glances at Banks and then back at Harry, and the look on his face turns knowing.
'I've been told to come looking for Blake Williams, your Gatherer. I was sent by Conor Gibbons, from Skellig Michael, in Ireland.'
Pimms ran through their schedule for the day, reminded everyone that they wouldn't be using magic, and that any wands seen in use on the trip would be removed. She also stated that they should keep conversation about differences between the magical and Muggle worlds to a minimum until they returned from the trip. Then she turned to Harry with a bright smile.
'You forgot your silencing charm?' Malfoy said, his voice a murmur in the night, his hand still on his cock.
Ron had dropped out of the Auror program post-graduation, and somehow the Department had never got around to revoking his access. He often stopped by to chat and cast his eye over some case or other. Harry privately thought he would make a great investigator, and sometimes he thought Ron's visits had less to do with him and more to do with the idea that, just for a moment, he could be a part of this life.
Instead he pushed the cloak off, his heart beating hard in his chest. He felt sick at seeing them, a scared tension twisting its way through him. It was overlaid by longing. A part of him wanted to go to them, to lean on them and be told everything would be okay, that they would work it out together.
'So what now?' Harry asks, thinking about what they'd needed from Davies. 'If Davies is off the table, how do we get to Mother?'
'On the bed,' Draco said. Harry turned immediately, feeling the ropes bite into his skin as he bent his leg, leaning forward to climb onto the bed.
That rationalisation sounded like Hermione again and Harry pushed it away with frustration. He was so tired. It was a struggle to make his thoughts connect.
Harry glanced behind him, taking in the range of implements on the bench. There was a spiked wheel, a range of straps of different materials, two thick candles, and an unfamiliar device that looked Muggle. Then Harry's eye caught on the collar, and held. He sucked in a breath and shook his head mutely.
Harry shook his head at the thought, gasping for breath, unable to see, unable to think of anything except the needs of his body.
'So what are we hunting?' Draco asked, looking far more excited than Harry had thought he would be. Harry pulled his attention back to the present and passed the memo over.
Draco looks at Harry, surprise crossing his face, then he tilts his body away from the door slightly, as though he doesn't want Davies to know they're talking about him.
He leaned back until he was sitting with his knees drawn up to his chest. He wrapped his arms around them and looked at his parents' names, tracing them with his eyes.
Then Scorpius looked up and saw Harry standing at the edge of the path ahead. He abruptly went quiet, letting Draco's arm go slack as he stepped in closer to his father.
Harry followed her, smoothing his hands down over his shirt and trying not to feel like he was in school and headed for a detention.
'You want to know everything about me? You want to make sure the former Death Eater isn't still up to no good? Fine!' Malfoy spat, his voice rising. Harry could feel something changing in the air as Malfoy spoke, a sense of something gathering. He'd fucked up somehow. Harry put his hands out, trying to calm Malfoy down. Malfoy paid no attention to him and Harry heard a rumble in the distance. He couldn't tell if it was coming from the building below them or the air around them. The snowflakes hung around them, suspended as though they were waiting for something.
Harry seemed to understand Draco's concern, and he smiled slightly. After a second, his expression twisted into something a little more knowing and sour.
Draco opened his mouth to protest. It wasn't about sex - yes he found Potter attractive. Yes, that was a rare thing for him, but what he'd experienced had been so much deeper than … and then he stopped and he thought about what she'd said.
'Is there... anyone else, from your old job, school, someone like that, that you could reconnect with?' He looked down at Harry's shoulder, stroking a finger along it, so he didn't have to meet Harry's eyes as he gathered all of his courage and let the next words out of his mouth.
A part of Harry, the part of him that took time to sit and examine a curse from all angles before acting, sat in the back of his mind, warning him that he needed to wait, that now was not the time. If he followed her, he could find out more, could get her alone, could force the answers from her—the reason James had been killed.
He shouldn't have done what he did, he knew. But the guy was an absolute twat. Harry couldn't just stand by as he talked about killing a bunch of people, like it was nothing. He remembered his own feelings after he'd killed the woman hosting Conquest. He'd been so muddied beforehand, so tangled in his own mind and his thoughts of what was needed. He knew, now, that the Horseman had been influencing him, and wondered if it was the same for Rick. Was he under the spell of War already? Was that why he was so willing to kill without worrying about the consequences?
The man behind him was still going, pumping in and out. Harry had a mind to tell him to fuck off, but instead he just growled a, 'hurry up' over his shoulder, bracing his hands against the wall.
'Azkaban.' There was a cold satisfaction in his tone. 'Pending trial, but that will be an in-and-out. Convicted Death Eater who couldn't keep his nose clean. He'll get life this time.'
Harry grit his teeth together. Now was not the time for a battle of wills. He needed to calmly and rationally present his points. He needed to speak to his counterparts in the other ICW Auror equivalents and garner support on a cross-country plane to object to this -
Harry just watches him and after a moment, Malfoy turns around, his door shutting behind him with a finality that echoes through the rest of the apartment.
'Hey babe,' Draco said, his voice coming out in Charlie Weasley's smooth rumble. He'd practiced mimicking the tone and depth until he got it exactly right, just like he'd meticulously chosen the cargos, heavy boots and tight black t-shirt from the dressing rooms to match Charlie's style. Draco had always had an eye for detail. It was one of the few things Rosa had praised him for as she trained him to be anyone but himself.
He's standing by the coffee machine, dressed and pressed for the day, as usual. A mug of tea sits, steaming gently, on the end of the table. Harry can smell that it's steeped perfectly to his liking, and is full of sugar.
Immediately Harry heard a soft whine and the two ropes hanging from the ceiling began to draw up, spreading apart as they were wound in. The woman's legs were drawn off the ground as the ropes above her drew tight. Ladon knelt again, running his hands over all the knots, as though checking their placement, checking her skin. He supported her, as she rose slowly into the air. Her head was the last to leave the ground and her eyes fluttered open for a second as it did so. Harry felt lost in the look of absolute bliss he saw reflected within their depth. Then she closed them again and hung, suspended upside down, a metre above the ground, spinning - ever so slowly - in front of the captivated audience.
He spent the next two nights free of nightmares as well, wrapped up in his cloak. He still didn't believe he was hiding from Death in it. He
Harry had been initially aghast at the way the paper was inciting anti-Muggle feelings, but he was hopeful that people would know better than to be taken in by such hype. Surely their own personal experience would trump the scaremongering the paper was putting out.
Ginny gave him a small smile. 'That sounds good. Thank you. I was thinking of going tomorrow. Christmas is Monday and, well … we can't pretend through that.'
He lifted himself onto his knees, and it was only as he reached behind himself and grabbed Draco's cock with the same slippery fist that Draco understood what was happening. He tensed and Harry hushed him.
He did want to be there, if only to remember it for Teddy, so he could share the memory when the boy was older. Harry sighed and tilted his drink up, feeling the familiar burn of the firewhisky as it slid down his throat. He placed the now empty glass on the table beside him and was looking through the crowd for one of the many house elves circulating in their smart service robes when he heard a familiar booming voice behind him. He closed his eyes for a moment and breathed out a long, slow breath, and then plastered the smile back onto his face and turned.
'I think we should let Davies assume I've been scared off,' Malfoy continues. 'We'd both be better off in different identities as we scout these sites over the next few days, so we don't tip anyone off if we're seen.'
he'd found the place and decided to go in. He drained the last of his tea as he narrowed his eyes, years of work as an Auror in the field helping him to tease out the threads of what didn’t feel right. He remembered the shivering tingle of sensation across his skin as he'd finally approached the building. He remembered the woman at the door - Delia? No, a flower … Dahlia - saying that the club was a Muggle one but that they were familiar with wizards. The more he thought back on the whole encounter, the more he convinced himself something had drawn him there. Some sort of magic was being used to lure unsuspecting people to that Club.
Draco's gaze was back on Harry. 'So Harry is the first to become master of all three Hallows?' he confirmed, face troubled, and Hermione nodded, her own face becoming grave.
'Like this?' Draco asked, his voice a half moan as his own cock skated against the ropes on Harry's stomach.
'Get out,' Malfoy said. 'I'll owl you your wand. By the time you get home I will have made copies of your worst memories, addressed them to your family, your boss and the papers and set plans that they should be released if I'm arrested.'
He drops Malfoy's hand and spins around, growling into the darkness as he raises his hands, ready for an attack.
He pulls his wand from his pocket and raises it to his temple. His grip on it is shaky—his fingers don't want to respond to him. The word "Stupefy" is on his lips, but he can't speak it, can't even think it with enough intent to make the magic work.
'Hello, Edgar,' he muttered, grimacing as his voice came out in the familiar rasping croak. Harry had a feeling Edgar was on his way to an early death from lung cancer. But that wasn't his problem. The man was assigned to Harry's twelve hour potion and he looked just the part to attend a seedy bar late at night.
'Where's your bread?' I ask, forcing myself to look him in the eye, as though nothing about this situation is absolutely insane.
Harry sits in bed with the possibility of a new future in front of him and Draco holds him as he cries.
Sometimes he wondered how much of that was real, and how much of that was the Estates keeping up appearances, as generations of magical owners had trained them to do. In the absence of those owners they carried on, expending their magical energy to preserve themselves beautifully for families who would never return. Harry sipped his whisky and thought of the wild tangle of his own garden at Grimmauld Place. He wondered what the state of that house said about its owners, past and present. Ginny had given up on it years ago. She'd never had much of a green thumb, but Harry found the untamed jumble of life suited his moods some days.
Harry felt the words hit him like blows as he imagined the life Malfoy's words described. He opened his mouth - to say what, he didn't know, but before he could speak, Malfoy had levelled his wand and Harry found himself standing outside of the bar, the only noise around him the harsh buzzing of the neon sign over his head. He didn't bother trying the door. He knew it would be locked.
'More than that though. You're different,' he said, reaching out to take Draco's hand. 'You're fun to be around and funny, and you're caring and I - I just like being with you.'
Harry wracked his brain. There was literally no one he could ask. Suddenly how alone Draco was really hit home for Harry, and he felt even worse about jumping to conclusions and pushing him away instead of reaching out to help him.
'Git,' he said, before he leaned in to kiss Draco again. If he couldn't tell him he was sorry, he could show him.
'My name is Scorpius Hyperion Malfoy,' he said, a hint of a lisp in his voice. 'And I am four. Pleased to meet you.'
He turned his head to look over his shoulder. 'Do I have the right to alert someone to my whereabouts?' he asked of the tall woman with the team leader stripes.
Harry's mood darkens as he thinks of all the times in their past that Malfoy's deliberately acted to make Harry's life harder. Sure, they seem to be getting on okay now, but that doesn't mean Malfoy won't take the opportunity to land a scoop. The prejudices against werewolves might not be law, but they're the next best thing. Even he—the wizarding world's darling boy—won't survive being outed as a wolf.
'We assume Conquest will be choosing a new host nearby soon, though we haven't seen any signs yet. We've been watching each of these people constantly for the last few months,' Blake continued, not noticing Harry's moment of recognition. 'But we need you and Rick to get closer to them. You'll be drawn to them if they're hosting War. You won't be able to help yourselves. So far, we've only been able to get near four of them to cross them off the list. This cycle, we're almost certain that War's placed itself inside a high-profile agent. All of these people have magical protection as well, even though half of them are No-Majs. Rick's been having a lot of trouble.'
'I'm not fucking him!' Draco objected, ignoring the spark of desire that leapt through him at the thought. It had been so long since he'd been interested in anyone that way … not since Astoria had passed, and that had been three long years. The thought of her brought that same painful ache back, and he felt unaccountably guilty for even considering Potter in the same light.
'You might want to talk to Ron, too,' she called over her shoulder, voice bitter. 'He made up some shitty excuse for you. I couldn't think of one.'
Harry shrugged, sensing Ladon was wavering. He didn't know why he wanted this so much, only that he did. 'I'd still know,' he whispered.
Harry's eyes fly wide and he feels anger burn into life as a name flashes into his consciousness. Every single behaviour he's just seen exhibited clicks into place and he feels his anger turn to fury.
As he thought that, his eye caught on Malfoy and he watched him for a moment, impressed again by the ease with which he worked the room. He seemed to be totally in his element. Harry wondered how that felt, for that public confidence to come so easily. To
His eyes dropped to Draco's mouth and suddenly, Draco realised what was going to happen. Potter was going to kiss him. He needed to stop this. He couldn't... It was Potter. He—
The sight of it stirs the same guilt he always feels; for not being able to stop the deaths, and for the possibility he might contribute to them.
—only responded to Draco with hate and violence. It had happened too many times now for him to continue to fool himself that it could be any other way. He was an idiot.
It was as he wondered whether Ginny's nails would leave marks that he came with a cry, hips stuttering as he ground into her one last time. He rested his head on her shoulder, panting for breath and she stilled beneath him.
'Why are you here?' he asked, after a long moment. Harry stopped, staring across at him, the question catching him off guard. Why
At those words the man relaxed, lowering his wand slightly, though he didn't put it away. He simply nodded and said, 'Follow me.'
'I used to lie in bed at night and flash coloured lights into the water, to see what I could attract.' He toed off his shoes and opened his trousers, pulling them down and taking his pants with them. Harry made a soft noise of appreciation behind him.
Harry fought the urge to groan as he fired the bike up, kicking the stand and sending it rumbling into the street. He rode slowly, obeying the city speed limits and enjoying the way the huge machine rumbled between his thighs and how Draco felt pressed against his back. Draco's hands moved over him slowly, not in any deliberate attempt to get him worked up, just in a leisurely exploration that was somehow far more arousing. He loved how well Draco knew his body now.
'So how do you stop them?' Harry asked, interrupting the flow of her words. He needed specifics, not all this mumbo jumbo. He needed to know how this linked to James.
Harry laughed and wiped his face with his arm before doing up his button in an awkward single-handed grip and heading down the stairs.
Harry just stared at her for a moment, shell-shocked by the questions. He looked around at the half-dozen people staring at him with hungry gazes and belatedly recognised them as reporters from all of the popular papers and magazines.
Harry led him swiftly through the department to a set of rooms at the back. He waved his wand over one of the doors and it clicked open. The room was dark. Harry gestured inside and Draco stepped hesitantly across the threshold. Harry slipped in behind him, and Draco heard him muttering a series of wards, locking spells, and silencing charms. He knew the strength of Harry's magic. No one would be coming through that door unless Harry permitted it.
He breathed hard for a moment, thinking of the other eight vials he'd been sent. He gave Harry one last glance. He was standing straight now with Charlie behind him, arms wrapped around him as he murmured soothing words into Harry's ear. Draco couldn't identify the emotion that twisted in his chest at the sight. He frowned and then pulled himself back out of the memory.
'Did you know your son and grandson have been targeted?' he asked. It was one of Murphy's later questions, but Harry wanted to see Malfoy's response. He wanted to see if he could jolt him into any feeling strong enough that it would register over the gloom of their surroundings.
, a part of him protested, but Harry pushed it far down, his mind filled with images of them, with the perfect world they'd inhabited together.
'You're sick,' he spat, throwing the band at Malfoy's feet. 'You're a twisted fuck, and what you did to me -' he paused, unable to find the words for the magnitude of emotions raging through him.
'He hid from you,' War went on, 'and watched you as you pulled the curse apart. Later he touched himself. While you went home to find your child in a pool of blood, Draco was wanking himself to the scent of you, lingering in his shop.'
'Sometimes I think about ripping it all out and starting again,' Malfoy continued, still watching Harry in that queer way. 'But it was hers. It's what's left of her. Do you know how it is, Mr. Potter, to hold something as a monument to someone who has passed?'
'I wasn't trying to pry, but I came by a few days ago, and you were gone again. I've been worried about you,' he said, his voice sounding defensive. 'We all have. And well, there was a disturbance in your room, and I was afraid maybe something -' he paused, clearing his throat and for just a second, Harry remembered the dark days, the days after the war, after he'd died, where he'd been lost in his head and unable to find the way out.
'The clockwork factory is Muggle-run, but wizard-owned. We identified traces of magical signature on the bomb remnants, and it matches a scan taken from a previous owner of the factory. He's now deceased, but we believe the parts and technology still present at the site may have been used to assemble the device.'
Malfoy comes out of the bathroom a few minutes later and he's fully dressed, his shirt buttoned up to his neck. Harry looks at his collar, wondering if the teeth marks are still there, under the shirt, or if Malfoy healed them.
'You can't keep judging a whole race based on the actions of a few,' Draco says from behind him, voice soft, but implacable. 'It's killing you, the way you hate yourself.'
, Javier had sent him to a date with the Wizengamot. Harry supposed he should have kept his temper, but he'd been on a knife edge for too long and it was getting harder and harder to pretend he was fine.
Harry glances up from where he's sitting on the other side of the table. He's been trying to keep his distance. It doesn't help in the slightest. He's dreamed of Draco the last two nights and woken sticky and frustrated, yearning for someone who's two doors down, but may as well be a world away. He
Draco looked at Harry, kneeling on the floor before him, collared and blindfolded, and he took a deep breath, calming himself. This all felt like it was happening so fast, like they were rushing forward and he would just have to blink to miss it.
He didn't expect to find anyone from this department who could actually tell him anything interesting - the techs in the ASS had been annoyingly tight-lipped - but he figured that if he lingered long enough, he might catch sight of some clue, some slip of the tongue, that told him where to look.
The words crime scene ripped through Harry's mind, dread following them. He had to get inside. He needed to know what Malfoy knew.
'Are you a wizard or not?' Draco said, the edge of teasing scorn in his voice making Harry want to grab his cock and strip it hard until he came. He grit his teeth and looked around the room again, spotting the corner of the bathroom sink.
Just like that, Harry felt his tension break. This was Malfoy - who had pushed Harry's buttons better than anyone throughout his school days. This was Ladon - who knew exactly what Harry needed ... this was Draco - who, one way or another, had entwined his life with Harry's since they were eleven years old.
Draco stared after him, his mind whirling with everything he'd just seen and heard. He could still taste Harry in his mouth, still feel Harry's hands on his body.
'The destination is Rothwell Estate,' Ron's voice says, issuing from the terrier in front of them. 'Apparition point is just outside the front gates. I'm bringing all Aurors into previously agreed covert positions. Signal remains as discussed. Ensure you have your coin with you.'
Harry forces himself not to react to the questions. They're the same ones the papers blew up with for months—still print every time he's seen outside of his house, which is rarely.
Harry doesn't push him, content to watch him, mentally cataloguing the names, faces and locations he comes across. Against his better judgement, he finds himself becoming more and more intrigued by the life he sees spooling out before him. For the most part, Malfoy doesn't let Harry get anywhere near the people he's meeting with, but Harry's an Auror, and a werewolf to boot. He's getting plenty of info from each of the meetings. He just can't seem to find the connection between them all.
'Of course, Catalyst,' Conor said, stepping closely and raising his hand as though he was soothing a skittish horse.
'I'm going to bind your chest first,' Draco said, pushing to his feet and unspooling the rope, measuring it out. 'Then down your arms, and across your thighs. Your movement won't be restricted, but you will feel the ropes dig into your skin. If anything starts to tingle or you lose sensation, you need to tell me immediately, okay?'
Draco looked over his shoulder with a laugh, and there was something deep and knowing in his eyes. 'You'll always be Potter,' he said, as he wrenched his broom around and down, chasing a speck of gold far below.
and realising to his shock that it was three am. He moved to the shadow of a nearby alley and turned on the spot, disapparating with a familiar hooking sensation.
Harry felt his anger spark again in response to Malfoy's dismissive tone and he shook himself mentally. He had a job to do. He was here to find out what the hell Malfoy was up to. Here, if he was honest with himself, to prove he could do this work. And he didn't need a whole team breathing down his neck to prove that to. He could do this by himself. He'd always worked best alone.
He looked at Ginny, opposite him in the kitchen they'd shared for the last ten years. He remembered a hundred lazy weekend breakfasts, romantic candlelit dinners, celebrating success and sadness as each of them moved jobs, got accolades … were told children wouldn't be a part of their life. There was so much between them - so many memories.
'Come by tonight,' Malfoy said, reaching into his jacket pocket and pulling a piece of paper and a pen out and scribbling something down. 'There are a few things I want to show you that I think will help you make up your mind.'
Harry let the familiar creature in, feeding him a treat from the jar he'd taken to keeping beside the window. Then he took the package off the owl's leg, eyes widening as he unrolled the sheets of paper.
He glanced at it periodically before he sighed and pulled another ream of paperwork towards himself. Tomorrow was the 31st. He knew the weekend would be a write off, so he needed to get as much done now as he could.
'Barclay will make contact on Sunday night. That seems to be the most highly frequented time.' Jeffries looked around the room at the assembled Aurors. 'Any questions?'
Harry smiled, placing Draco's tea on the side table and sitting at the other end of the couch. Without a word, Draco stretched his long legs out, putting his feet in Harry's lap. Harry put his hands on them, looking expectantly at Draco.
'Veritas,' Malfoy says, hands twitching and half raising as though he wants to grab Harry's fingers and pry them away. But he doesn't.
But a moment later, Malfoy's movements start again, just as slow as before. Within a few minutes, he's worked himself back up into a panting, twisting mess on the sheets, the sounds still so quiet that Harry doubts someone with normal hearing would be able to catch them if they were standing outside Malfoy's room with an ear pressed to the door.
But there was something about the man that called to him. Blake had said that would happen if he came into contact with one of the Horsemen. Was it what was happening now? It felt like the same need Harry had always felt around Malfoy; the need to know what he was doing. The need to know
Harry could feel his own arousal building and he tried to hold it off. He wanted Draco to get there first. He wanted to see him come undone, see him totally open himself up. Everything about him was intoxicating as he got lost in what they were doing. Harry moved his fist faster, gritting his teeth against his need to come, but then Draco stiffened against him, crying out and Harry felt the hot splash of his release against his skin. The thought of it - Draco marking him that way - and the sight of him, head thrown back and face transformed by pleasure, tipped Harry over the edge. He felt his own orgasm hit and he cried out as he slowed his movements, spending himself over Draco's stomach.
Malfoy looked every inch like someone who had been born to money. He looked like a weapon; something that was beautiful from afar, but if you came too close, would cut you to pieces. For just a moment, Harry had a memory of sitting on the back porch of Grimmauld Place, with a Draco who was dressed in a pair of Harry's joggers and a t-shirt that was far too loose on him, picking chips out of a wrapper with his fingers. His hair had been soft then, ruffled from Harry's hands in it, gripping him to pull him closer.
Last to fade was the image of the figure standing in the corner of the room, cloaked all in black. It had been there and not there at the same time. His mind couldn't seem to focus on the details of it, but he could remember the feel of it. Cold. Triumphant. Malevolent. He knew, without a doubt, that the thing had been smiling as it watched his son die.
'I did beat him at Quidditch,' Harry confided conspiratorially, glancing across at Malfoy to see his eyes flick up from Harry's chest, a strange look in them that Harry couldn't identify.
Malfoy tilted his head in appraisal, a tiny, pleased-looking smile creeping across his face, and then twitched his wand one more time. A cool metal mask, which felt like a second skin, settled across Harry's eyes and flowed down one cheek - covering his scar.
Draco took a breath and began. 'Alright. So as I understand the situation, the Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement is spearheading a case for reduction in Auror funding more broadly, but particularly in the number of active patrol members?'
Draco jerked his head around, pushing himself up onto his elbow to look at her. He wiped the wetness from his cheeks and sniffed.
The men and women around him were silent, each turning their gaze to the looming building as they considered the task ahead of them.
'… and then Ginny apparently charmed the suits of armour to issue bat bogey hexes. And Snape copped one, right in the face. Can you imagine it?' Ron snorted and Harry pictured it, bats flying uncontrollably from Snape's pointy face.
'Do you like to watch?' Malfoy asked, glancing across at him, and there was a teasing glint in his eye. Harry wondered how much he'd had to drink … wondered if he was flirting.
Draco closed his eyes for a moment and took a deep breath. 'I'm not saying I don't want to,' he said, looking away from Harry. 'I just - we've only been talking for a week, let alone, this,' he said, gesturing between them. 'It's just  - I don't want you to regret this.'
It was strange, to see this man standing before him, to know he had a whole other life, but to also know he was Draco.
'Do you think Weasley will buy it?' Malfoy asks and Harry has to think back over the last few minutes of conversation he'd been half taking in.
He doesn't stop to consider whether this is a good idea. Whether the wolf wants it, or the bracelet, or whether this is something he wants. He can't. Feeling is what he needs, not thinking. Just forgetting and letting his mind go still for a moment. Malfoy owes him that, doesn't he? All of this is his fault, in one way or another.
Malfoy's other hand is already in his pocket and too later Harry realises his hand must be on his wand as he feels a hook to his guts and Malfoy whirls them into Apparition.
He brought a hand slowly up to his face and realised the blindfold was still draped loosely over his eyes. He opened them and squinted against the cracks of light peering in around the corners of it. Then he slipped it slowly from his face, mourning slightly at the acknowledgement that the scene was done. His fingers traced over the collar that was still wrapped around his neck and he drew some comfort from its presence - he was still Ladon’s.
Walter Green is a wrinkled man in his seventies who wears cardigans and is balding on top. His face is friendly and he looks like exactly the sort of concerned resident Harry would expect to come to him with information about something suspicious. Harry drops his own glamour and glances in the mirror to check he looks the way he should before he gets out of the car.
Malfoy steps up beside him on the sidewalk and touches his arm lightly to allow him to pass through the wards. Once they're through he strides to the door as fast as Walter's body will let him, unlocking it and walking inside. Harry follows him, looking around, breathing in deeply as he tries to catch a hint of anything out of the ordinary.
Harry frowns and opens his mouth to argue. They should keep moving. Staying in one place raises the chance of someone following their trail.
He opens his eyes to his mate and they watch each other in the semi-darkness, as they both wait for the moon to fade from the sky.
'I told her about the collar,' Harry said. 'And how it cuts off the magic. She wants to talk to you about it - where you got it from, how it works, that sort of thing.'
'What are you doing here?' Harry asked, unable to help the suspicion colouring his voice. Malfoy had been the one creeping around for the past few days. He was certain of it.
Draco looked around and his eyes flicked over their small group before catching on Harry. Harry found himself unable to look away, taking in the details of Draco's appearance, drinking him in after a few days apart.
Harry frowned, feeling anger stir through him. He didn't know why Malfoy was having a go at him. They'd been chatting perfectly happily a moment ago. 'You told me to come, you prat.'
- to be missing from the official Recognition of the Human Status of Werewolves and the launch of the Werewolf Rights Act. And he didn't want to let Hermione down either. He spotted her across the room, dominating the conversation of half a dozen Department Heads, Ron at her side, glowing with pride.
She looked at him a moment longer, concern written across her face, but then sighed. 'If you're sure. But make sure you come by. Or send your Patronus if you need us.'
'I didn't mean for this to happen,' Harry murmured into Hermione's hair. She tightened her grip on him and her embrace made him feel - just for a moment - that things might be okay.
Ladon shook his head sharply, eyes back on the leather band, and then he reached out to run a finger along it, grazing Harry's skin lightly as he did so. Harry shivered under the touch.
He pushed his fingers back in, two this time, groaning at the feeling and cursing at the awkward angle.
Harry looked into Ron's concerned eyes and mustered a smile. He remembered Ron doing the right thing - always the right thing, where Hermione was concerned. Then he frowned. No, that had been the game. A dream, not a memory. Gods, but he was tired. 'I know.'
He pulled a few things out, and then there was the beep and hum of machines and a small bowl of spaghetti carbonara was sitting in front of him.
He'd had another three by the time she came downstairs, and the sight of her almost took his breath away, stirring feelings he'd thought long-forgotten. She wore a full-length gown, gold in colour and decorated all over with intricate beading and embroidery. A white lace ruff framed her shoulders and ran up behind her neck, drawing attention to her hair, which was twisted into delicate spirals of vibrant red. Her mask was simple; delicate gold wiring framing her eyes and sweeping up into her hair.
'I have a surprise for you,' Draco said, intercepting Potter before he could sit back on the couch where they'd spent the first visit.
When Harry drifted slowly back into awareness, he could hear singing. A gentle melody. A sound that made him feel safe. Protected. It took a while before he realised it was coming from the man laying beside him - the man he was curled around and half on top of. It took longer before he realised that man was Ladon. He lay quietly, feeling as though he was floating, letting the soft words drift over him - he couldn’t understand them, but they were beautiful.
He rounded the corner and hurried towards the public entrance. He didn't pay attention to the people milling around the phone booth until they turned to him almost as one, rushing forward.
Harry watched him, taking a large swallow of his scotch and another drag on his smoke before he spoke.
The bar looked even more pathetic up close. The neon sign buzzed and flicked intermittently. The rest of the street was dark and quiet around it, and Harry couldn't hear the thumping of bass he was used to from venues this late at night. He glanced around, seeing no signs of surveillance on the place. That was what Jeffries had said: they hadn't wanted to tip Malfoy off that the raid a few days before had been anything more than a standard stock check.
Harry couldn't help the huff of laughter that came at these words - at the fact that it was Malfoy saying them. He winced and rubbed at his temples as his headache throbbed in response.
'This club is full of Muggles, Potter. I'd appreciate if you'd stop lighting up the ceiling like a fucking Christmas tree.'
wordlessly. He watched for the tell tale glow of magic being revealed and made a soft noise of satisfaction when he saw the barest glimmer across the page. He reached absently for a piece of toast as he moved to the next spell, the modified healing diagnostic that the Auror Department had started to use during the War to identify common types of magic embedded in objects.
Malfoy scowled at him. 'Well that's a bloody obvious suspicion, Potter. The lunatic had pictures of those children all through his house.
'I need to start coming here for dinner,' he said. 'Cooking for one is rubbish and the canteen food is worse.'
Harry huffs, knowing Malfoy isn't going to let it go. He'd made his decision before lunch. He can't be around Davies any other way and he knows it. His weakness—his
Ladon's eyes dropped, running up Harry's body again, as he palmed himself through his pants, shuddering in a breath. 'Okay' he rasped, picking up Harry's shirt and transfiguring it with a whispered word. 'Okay,' he said again.
She reached out, laying a hand on his arm. 'You should try to rest. Based on the last time you depleted your magic, the Healers weren't expecting you to wake until late today.'
'You want another, love?' Draco asked, and Harry knew he was getting it all twisted in his head. Draco didn't call him love - Draco would never call him love. But Ladon had - and Harry wanted that - wanted that from Draco with an intensity that stunned him. He'd thought it was just attraction - attraction that had the potential to make a growing friendship messy. But now he realised he'd been lying to himself. He wanted more than that with Draco. He wondered if he could have it.
'No,' Malfoy muses. 'You're not.' He seems to make up his mind and reaches into his pocket to pull out a bundle of tiny papers. He taps them with his wand and they unshrink.
Once they were clear of the city Harry gunned the engine, opening the throttle and enjoying the feeling of the wind whipping against him. Draco always complained that it ruined his hair, but Harry had the sneaking suspicion it reminded him of flying and that he really didn't mind at all. Harry glanced around them, seeing no traffic and then hit the disillusionment charm. The air turned slightly hazy around them and Harry grinned in anticipation.
to be over as quickly as possible and for you to leave my premises with just as much haste. Yes, I use magic to attract people - Muggle and wizard - to my Club. It is a completely legal modification of a siren spell. The same that most wizarding establishments use to attract their clientele. It's harmless.'
Draco flushed slightly, despite himself. 'It's worked up until now,' he said. Granger opened her mouth to reply, but Weasley interrupted them.
Bill holds him tight and Harry lets himself relax into the embrace, letting the familiar sound of Bill's heartbeat relax him slightly.
Hermione just looked at him, her eyes sympathetic. 'It's the only thing I can think of that makes sense,' she said.
Harry Floo'd to the Three Broomsticks, casting a Notice-Me-Not as he stepped from the fireplace. He'd been using them more and more lately. The press were rabid for an update about his divorce. The papers had been splashed with it, despite the fact only their official statement had been released. Even if it wasn't for that, Hogsmeade on a school visit was one place he was guaranteed to be mobbed by people. They learned about him in school these days. It was enough to make him sick.
He waited a long moment, staring at Malfoy and feeling his magic crackling around them. He pulled the power of it around himself, letting it soothe the hurt.
Malfoy was dancing now, and Harry remembered watching him dance at the Yule Ball, all those years ago. He'd hated Malfoy then, for how easy he made it look. For how seamlessly he fit in, with his Pureblood manners and what was clearly years of familiarity with the dances. Now … now he watched Malfoy and wasn’t sure what he thought. Malfoy was a better dancer now than he had been then. He'd grown into his gangly limbs, filled out into a lean, well-built man.
Ladon slipped the tip of the vibrator inside him, just enough to stretch him a little, to put pressure on him. Harry's whole focus narrowed to that sensation, the slight movements as the vibration teased at him. Ladon slipped it in and out just a fraction. Just enough.
'Pat-ro-nus,' Draco corrected gently and Harry had to smile as a memory of Hermione in first year flashed into his mind for a moment.
'A child smuggling ring,' Malfoy says, lip curling. 'Squib kids. That's why the bastards haven't been caught. The kids aren't on anyone's radar.'
He walked to the bedside table, where charm that amplified his gut instinct was wiggling with glee, and waved his wand to slide the drawer out. It was empty and he frowned, glancing down at his charm, which was showing no sign of losing interest. Harry looked at it for a long moment before something occurred to him. He returned his attention to the drawer and thought about another charm Malfoy had taught him, so many years ago, when they'd been wine drunk and maudlin, talking of the war.
James couldn't go in the ground. He needed to be here. In bed. In Harry's arms. He needed to be smiling up with his nonsense sounds and his chubby, gasping hands.
'At least people do see me, Father,' Draco said, forcing his tone to stay mild. He had no interest in giving his father the satisfaction of knowing anything he said had an impact. 'I wonder sometimes if people even know you're still here. I certainly don't hear mention of you when I go about my day.'
His cock ached, hanging heavy between his legs, dripping onto the floor. He sucked against the intrusion in his mouth, pulling his arms, desperate to release a hand and try and get some relief. But the squid just tightened its grip, the tentacles never still, slithering over his skin.
Memories flashed all around him, like a school of fish. They darted this way and that, as though trying to escape him, but Harry was very, very good at this now. He focussed on what he wanted to know.
He began to look at Malfoy in much the same way that he looked at a challenge with one of his creatures. He refused to examine too closely why he was suddenly driven to do the very things his therapist had been encouraging him to do repeatedly when he was seeing her -
He was woken the next morning by a tapping at his window. He raised his head groggily and checked the time. It was already seven. He needed to get up if he had any hope of getting to work on time. He pushed the covers back and stumbled over to the window, opening it for the insistent bird. It held its leg out and Harry took the letter automatically, turning it over and absently Accio-ing his glasses from his bedside table.
He pushed her gently again, so she was laying flat on the floor, arms still bound up tight behind herself. He ran his hand down one leg and then the other, bending them backwards so her feet were resting against her bare arse. Then he set to work with the ropes again. He wrapped her left leg, pulling the strands up to encircle her bent leg, crossing them over her thigh to the calf resting above it and then back down. He looped out towards her knee twice, and then came back in.
Harry looked away as Andrews shed more clothing, stumbling slightly as he divested himself of his pants. He could hear the touch of skin and the wet slickness of mouths moving together. Then there was a moan and Harry knew it wasn't Malfoy. It didn't sound like him.
Harry feels something in himself relax in relief, and then the rest of the questions come. 'The team? The perps? How many did you bag?'
Malfoy just shifts lanes again, pushing the car even harder. 'I have charms up,' he says. 'The car projects a few seconds worth of Obliviation, constantly.'
He shrunk the pile of papers and books down and then pointed his wand downstairs. 'Accio Mokeskin Pouch.' It came flying into his hand and he opened the neck of it, sliding his research inside. He kept a range of things in it, things he'd collected on his travels; charms, amulets, wards. Trinkets some of them, all holding a memory of something different. Something better. He hadn't added anything to the bag since James was born. Hadn't been outside the country since James was born.
Testing the wards and the Weasley family's possible remaining links to the site with an afternoon of flying had been too much of a risk to take. Recreating the scene was much safer. He'd had to cancel appointments with two other clients to get the site set up in time, but it was worth it as Potter pulled him close for a quick hug and whispered, 'Thank you,' into his ear.
He bit his lip to stop the sobs that wanted to rise in his throat. Instead he buried himself in Blaise's chest.
Draco closed his eyes at Harry's words and let out a shuddering breath. When he opened them again, they shone with a film of tears he didn't allow to fall.
Malfoy turns to Harry immediately. 'What the fuck was that?' His voice contains none of the fear Harry might have expected from most people. He's already turned his attention away from Harry and is on the way to his would-be killer.
Malfoy sniffed, turning to look out the window, 'Yes, well. Some of us were raised with proper manners.'
Harry liked their time on the roof the most. It wasn't that the weather was better outside - it had been a gorgeous, balmy temperature inside for days now - Harry could tell that Malfoy was more comfortable when he wasn't around other people. He tended to get more tense when they were on their walks through the building, as though he were waiting for something to happen. His tension blended with the simmering undercurrent of discomfort Harry always felt when inside a building he couldn't Apparate from. Normally he could ignore it, but his awareness of Malfoy's anxiety pricked at him, putting him even on edge.
Harry came back to himself as he looked down at the drawer again, remembering that moment in a new light. Was Malfoy connected to Death too? Had that been what he was doing, all those years ago, when he put things elsewhere? Harry's earlier thought came back to him. Was Malfoy a Catalyst, too? Was he mixed up in all of this? Or had his appearance in the news footage been a coincidence?
Rose and Scorpius rushed from exhibit to exhibit, marveling at rays gliding overhead, sticking their hands into the interactive rook pool displays and talking about pirates when they passed the shipwreck. Harry found himself with a smile on his face all morning, seeing things with fresh eyes through the lens of the kids' excitement.
Harry scanned him subtly, trying to get a hint of Malfoy's true feelings. Surface-level intentions that were almost impossible for someone to hide, and which so often gave away an understanding of whether they should dig deeper. But all he could feel was the grief and darkness of the house. It was pervasive. It felt alone. Abandoned. He cursed the fact that they had to see Malfoy here, of all places.
