“And you?” said Lucius, turning his piercing gaze to the man that was a head taller than him. Never let it be said that he wasn’t intimidating. “If you provide an adequate answer, I may still pay you, even if you did not fulfil the conditions I set.”
Madam Pomfrey sighed, ”stay here, I’m going to ask Albus if this is true, if it is then you’ll be moved… why I wasn’t informed is beyond me.” The last words came out with sheer annoyance, “I’ll be right back, try not to break anything or leave, and I’m warning you Potter, if you’re lying there will be strife.”
Of course, he was thrown off the rock not even ten seconds later by what appeared to be a spell that looked like a fireball of cherry blossom leaves.
He placed the letter on the table, vastly aware that he would get in trouble if a certain someone walked in and saw that, he didn’t care at the moment, a large smile on his face and his eyes filled with excitement. He finished his breakfast and placed the plate in the sink, ignoring the house-elves that demanded they do it because it was there job and they didn’t want to upset there Master, he chuckled softly and left the room and let the house-elves bicker amongst themselves.
Professor Snape walked into the Charms classroom, his dark eyes narrowing at the students that were chatting idly about the next spells they would do. He wanted to sneer at the fact that none of them were listening to the professor as he was explaining something that would help the students in the future. “I am here to collect Mr. Potter,” he said as a girl almost screamed when he appeared behind her.
“The Gryffindor and Slytherin team aren’t sacrificing our points” Harry called out, Dumbledore gave a nod.
“We have no idea, but it was directed at Draco, Harry Potter is a Parseltongue” Pansy said before looking back at her food, “he can talk to snakes.”
“It’ll be alright, Harry,” soothed Molly softly, not sure if the boy was even conscious to hear her words, but she felt as if she had to say them. She had hoped that Ron would use his head and keep everyone out, but she was sure that Arthur would have actually ran, which wasn’t common unless something big was going on.
“Actually, Weasley, the information is in the Restricted Section in the library,” said Harry. “I’m sure your friend Granger has read up on it in detail, she has a tendency to read everything with her know-it-all attitude. No matter what’s being discussed, she’ll put her piece in, no matter how unwanted and unneeded it is.”
Harry bottled his potion, silently laughing at the pathetic Gryffindors who seemed to think that blowing out airs of breath and watching their breath instead of focusing on the potion was a good way to pass the time, which meant he was far from surprised when most melted cauldrons and got demolished by Professor Snape as he verbally reduced them to nothing. When he left the dungeons at the end of Potions, he found a large fir tree blocking the corridor ahead. Two enormous feet sticking out at the bottom and a loud puffing sound told them that the resident oaf was behind it. He stood back with Draco and watched as Ronald Weasley decided that he would offer some help.
Lily’s left hand instantly went to her forehead, in a fainting gesture. “You knew that I was there, didn’t you?”
“You’re not the same height as Draco,” said Eleanor. “Not exactly a bad thing, though. Everyone’s a different height. Like, I’m taller than Lewis.”
,” hissed Nagini, dropping her head back onto the log and easily slipping back into a peaceful sleep.
“Oh, yes,” said Peeves, a slight smirk reappearing on his face. “Poor thing almost had a heart attack when she saw
Harry, with Cedric and Ernie trailing behind him, walked towards the hill and easily climbed the small bump in the ground and smiled at his mother, who hovered nearby, watching as Daniel stumbled around. He paused near Mr Weasley and grinned as he caught sight of Ronald huffing, trying to catch his breath.
“Y-Yes, I g-guess we should g-go back n-now.” Harry sobbed, he wiped his eyes on his shirt and forced a smile.
“No matter,” said Atieno with a raised hand. “These scrolls are very, very interesting, if I may say so.”
“That is as likely as stepping into Gringotts and getting a purifying ritual done,” said Atieno, snorting. “Impossible and is complete nonsense. A bonding contract does not exist and the only thing goblins will purify you of is your life. They are intelligent beings, child, they know who their master is and they know who their potential master will be in generations. They are far more intelligent than man, it is the ritual holding them back and keeping them so stupid.”
Harry soon had compiled everything about the two and their obviously quiet life and he decided to just filter it away in case he ever needed it, who knew how useful this could be in the future if he was ever in the Muggle world and needed something.
“You don’t understand that they’re more advanced than us – no one does,” muttered Harry, shoving aside his plate. “Voldemort – don’t flinch – had the wrong idea. Attacking Muggles and exposing ourselves with warfare would only serve to kill us off. They outnumber us, outgun us, and they have us beat in technology. We still use torches whereas they can light an entire building with a flick of a switch.”
“I didn’t think you’d be here, Harry,” said Neville. “I could have sworn you’d be with Malfoy and the rest of them.”
“-been better using the laughing hex, Mister Zabini,” Harry continued for Draco, “Rictusempra needs to be cast loudly, while ‘Titillando’ can be said in a soft whisper. If you went with the latter you could have won the bet, I’m amazed you used a spell I am very familiar with, having used it almost every year myself.”
“If I say it myself, Neville, I’ve always been able to charm the people I needed. So Ginny poured out her soul to me, and her soul happened to be exactly what I wanted. I grew stronger and stronger on a diet of her deepest fears, her darkest secrets. I grew powerful, far more powerful than little Miss. Weasley. Powerful enough to start feeding Miss. Weasley a few of my secrets, to start pouring a little of my soul back into her…” Tom continued to speak, more to himself than anyone else in the room. Of course, he stopped the moment someone dared to interrupt his musings.
One of the more common theories is that Ekrizdis was tied directly to his creations, which allowed him to gain their powers – immortality. He sacrificed his ability to produce children to create them – or so he claimed. He referred to the Dementors as his ‘children’ in various texts, scribbles, and the one speech he gave. Ekrizdis also claimed that the Dementors were not actually immortal and required substance from their creator to regain their life. If this is true, it means that Ekrizdis is in fact still alive.
Professor Snape paused in his thinking of an ideal insult to use against the man and pondered the question. “I have no idea,” he said, his tone lacking the usual bite and bitterness that it held. “My best guess is that it’s magical and that’s as far as I know.”
Harry nodded and watched as Adrian made a noise of happiness and picked up the jam. “Well,” he whispered, glancing towards the shabby professor. “There’s only one thing we can do to uncover this plot.”
“I have a letter for Draco; I’ll just give him it and then leave.” Harry walked towards Draco and dropped the note on his lap.
Neville sent Hermione a confused glance. He hadn’t ever heard Hermione speak like that before. “Ron?” he asked when he noticed his best friend spluttering at the door.
“Would you like some help?” asked Harry softly, not wanting to use to high of a tone in case she hurled something at him.
“Well you see, Susan,” said Harry, picking up from where he left off previously. “I was sitting in the Slytherin common room with Tracey Davis, Pansy Parkinson and two second-year Slytherins who needn’t be mentioned at the present and we came across something odd – yes, odd describes it best – and we instantly decided to think up a way to fix this issue.”
“I learned something today, something that surprised me,” said Harry, making Pansy flinch. “I learned that my good friend here, Tracey, has been neglected and ignored in her own dormitory due to her apparent status as a half-blood.”
He caught a few conversations that were about none other than Neville Longbottom, the Boy-Who-Lived. It was astonishing that people could come up with unique stories to tell their friends regarding a twelve-year-old boy. Nothing was justified about it either.
“A team game where the game is decided by one person,” said Rosier. “Interesting concept, but witches and wizards
“Don’t lie to me, I know you came in here to suck a dick, I heard another voice.” Ron glared around the room.
“I’m Cedric,” said Cedric, standing as tall as he could. “And my surname isn’t Doggery – quit laughing, Ernie – it’s Diggory.”
Harry had drawn his wand, knowing that everyone now watched the scene with rapt intent. It was now that he would prove himself worthy of beating Longbottom, the incompetent wizard. He stared at Longbottom, watching as the boy twirled his wand nervously. ‘Good, he’s scared,’ he thought bitterly, ‘and so he should be.’
Harry lunged forwards, unblinking, hoping to drive his small sword into the crook of the goblin’s neck. He didn’t think it would work, but he believed Tom would never lead him astray, nor would the voice intentionally hurt him in any aspect. He pushed every bit of strength he had left in his body into that one slash with the sword, the blade glowing green as it soared through the air, clipping the neck of the goblin.
“Just his usual moans and whining,” Neville said, glancing down at Harry, “some things were audible, mostly calling out to Draco, but then it became nonsense and he fell back asleep.” Neville looked at Draco, “Malfoy, if you want you can sleep in the spare bed next to Harry? No one will really bother you and it’ll give us some time to prepare for Snape’s assignment, and he’ll have someone here in case he wakes up.” Neville looked at Draco, who was clearly tired, looked like he was running on ten minutes of sleep.
“Not bad for my first attempt at the spell. I must admit, that is a lie, but only because my first attempt was when I was eight and I vanished my vegetables when mother looked away,” said Harry, smirking at the memory. He threw his hands up at the look he got. “Accidental magic! No one wants to eat their vegetables.”
The first thing he realised that was considered to be off with his morning wakeup was the fact that Nagini wasn’t on the bed or in the immediate area and that concerned him.
“I mean, he just said that it was due to an event taking place that would be starting in October,” said Jude. “Something that would last the entire school year.”
He blinked and shuddered as he felt exhaustion leaking from the man. He knew it couldn’t be the case, the man just looked so tired that it was almost contagious. He looked down at the wand before looking back up at Robin, who had shifted onto his knees.
He made note that it was impossible to have more than one form, no matter how powerful or patient you are. Your Animagus form was much like the reflection of your soul and you couldn’t have two souls.
“Did Harry do anything odd in the store?” asked Mr. Weasley. “Did he touch anything or be drawn to anything at all?”
Severus snapped his eyes to Harry, “I see, and where were you? You caused quite the scare vanishing like that.”
Ron froze, his mind going at a faster speed than the fastest broom ever made. He was sure that Hermione would scold him and then smile, stating that Muggles used a different term and that he would have known that if he took Muggle Studies like he had joked about. He imagined Neville shaking his head with a smile, saying that he was always quick to jump in front of things for his friends.
cases of swearing, but I will never allow such profanity! Get up, get dressed, and get in the kitchen and help your father with breakfast!”
“Understandable,” said Harry. “Just call me Harry, then. I’m used to adults avoiding contractions, trying to sound posh or experienced in the art of words.”
“Yes, just don’t tattle in there, place him on a bed and then leave and hurry back to your rooms, curfew is almost in effect.” The prefect still surprised, watched them both carefully as they casually opened the doors.
Harry rubbed his forehead in a massaging pattern. “No, it’s not English, obviously. Believe it or not, but I’m not a walking encyclopaedia,” he said with a sneer. “I know a little bit of Latin, but that’s it.”
“I know what history says,” said Harry, interrupting the girl. “It says that Salazar was a dark, evil man who couldn’t get his own way with allowing Muggleborn students into the school and left in a hissy fit when Godric Gryffindor disagreed with him.”
James agreed with what had been said, his eyes burning slightly as he thought about the neglected creatures that the Minister was far too afraid of. All manner of them now had to walk through Diagon Alley, which lacked the safety of Knockturn Alley. The Auror part of him thought that it was a good idea, perhaps implemented poorly, but his more rational, every day side found it appalling. He was torn between how to feel about something that could provide so much more security than any other method but stripped freedom and safety of certain races and creatures.
“What do you think I tried to do?” snapped Harry. “Do you think I just picked up my wand, aimed it at Lupin, and cast the Killing Curse? The Minister and I used – you know what? Who cares? The spell I used was going to trap the thing in a silver cage, it got messed up and went the wrong way. Such is magic. The blame is on him. Why was he out of his assigned room that had been coated in silver? That’s his sole condition for working, that’s what the Ministry declared and he went against it and now I am suffering because of his carelessness.”
The Slytherins walked into the Great, holding their chins up high. Some looked back and noticed the headmaster casting something on the door.
Draco had finished his bath, and was now walking towards the Great Hall, which he saw various amounts of commotion as he waltzed past a group of kids, shoving them as he fixed his robe. He debated going to give Harry the potion now, but decided that it’d be wiser to see his condition first. He turned around to head towards the infirmary, shoving the same group of kids before he saw Neville Longbottom upside down and hanging from the stairs, he couldn’t help but laugh as he walked towards the infirmary, ‘I’ll ask around about that later,’ he thought to himself and continued along towards Harry.
“Uh,” said Ernie, pausing for a moment, his eyes darting around, looking at the walls and people. “That it was run by, erm, a decent wizard.”
“That w-was e-excellent w-work, Mr. P-Potter, ten p-points to S-Slytherin for t-that perfect L-Lumos,” he said in a praising tone. “We w-will now s-study on c-curing werewolf b-bites.”
Lily broke down into tears, unsure of what she should say or do. “Three days, James,” she said. “Three days and we haven’t found him yet.”
He walked towards the bathroom with an armful of fresh clothes, some toiletries, and a towel. He entered the room, noticing that one stall had a wet floor, which meant someone had showered, and another had Draco standing in it, neatening his hair.
Narcissa stepped into his study and rested her hand on his shoulder, “you seem distressed Lucius, and do you want to talk about it?”
“Mr. Longbottom and Mr. Weasley came up to me a while ago and claimed that Mr. Potter made her cry in the library,” said Minerva, leaning forwards slightly, her hand wrapped around the warm cup. “That was the day that Miss. Granger began to with draw into herself.”
“What do you mean it ‘was’,” said Harry, sitting upright. “I’ve never seen anyone else bypass the Trace. I’ve seen many people complain about it being a nuisance and that they
The goblin grunted and slammed his small fist against the wooden gate. “‘Ve got a gro’p of w’z’rds w’th me, s’ op’n up.”
Professor Snape thrust the parchment which had names and dates of anyone who attempted to enter it. “You are the only person since I began here to breach my wards and steal from me, Mr. Potter! Since I know no one has taught you any advanced spells to breach wards, you must have used another way to enter my storeroom. I want to know how!”
“It’s not our concern, Ron, just focus on finding them,” snapped Hermione, but couldn’t push the question from her mind, why indeed was Harry so mean to people when he appeared to be so intelligent?
Harry quickly wrote on a piece of parchment and sneakily handed it over towards Draco, pushing it across the tabletop.
He allowed Lupin to dispel the Boggart and gave a nod, indicating that he was satisfied with the Boggart and what he had seen. He stood back and allowed Lupin to begin teaching Longbottom, taking notes.
After a long and relaxing shower, which made him more tired than awake, he stepped out and noticed Draco digging around on his trunk, his arm full of books. He shook his head and sat down on the foot on his bed, shaking his head as Draco grunted, almost dropping the books.
“My first-born was magically powerful, more so than my wife and I combined. He helped set up the wards around the property, not hiding it, but making anyone who wanted to harm us or steal our research turn away, unsure of what they actually wanted from us. Amazing piece of magic.
“He told me that he experiences pain quite often due to Quidditch,” said Harry, thinking. “Maybe he’s felt the pain and simply ignored it. He must have quite the pain threshold to be able to do what he does and not give up. I mean, at the World Cup, he took a Bludger to the face and didn’t even flinch.”
“No one had high hopes for him,” said Draco. “Why do you think James and Lily just have no idea what to do with him? They were told by every healer, every Potions Master, besides Professor Snape, that their son would die before his tenth birthday. If they were lucky. He proved them all wrong, of course, but it came at a cost that he didn’t really know.”
“Welcome, once again, to the Slytherin Duelling Pit,” said Professor Snape, scowling at the group of students that refused to remain quiet. He rose his hand and silence them. “This room is not a joke and you should not be repeating
Harry and Neville were the only pair that didn’t make a grab for their wands. Neither wanted to give away anything on a practice duel.
“I can assure you that your blood will be irrelevant in a few years,” said Draco. “People won’t care and the next generation will repeat the same insults and same sneers and the cycle will continue.”
Some last minute studying would do him good. It would take the edge off his mind and cause him to actually think and plan.
“It should be very old and rather enormous, the cover will be black and have an alchemy symbol on the cover.” Hermione explained and glanced around the library. She was about to say something when Ron groaned about something, she gave him a curious glance. “What?”
It was Snape who broke the ward, he rushed out and cast a stunner on Harry from behind, the spell hit and Harry stood there, completely unfazed. Snape’s wand flicked out of his hand and landed next to Harry. Harry slowly picked it up and held it firmly, everyone stood still.
“No Harry, it’s more so that your eyes remind him of a mistake he made.” Albus lifted a sweet for him, “lemon sweet?”
“I cannot object to you having a pet snake,” said Lily. “Just look after it and make sure you keep it occupied. I don’t want to wake up one morning and see the snake in the middle of the floor.”
“Yes,” said the voice with a sigh. “You appeared on my doorstep, or better known as Death’s doorstep.”
Harry grinned and shook his head, signalling the end of the very short conversation, knowing that they would get in trouble sooner rather than later. Something was telling him that the man was displeased and at the end of a tether.
“This is me eating relaxed,” replied Harry, his tone was soft and calm, not wanting to spook or startle the Muggles. “This is how I was raised to eat, by Lucius and Narcissa. In fact, I’m sure the former would be sending me subtle glares about how I’m acting at the dinner table.”
“Salazar Slytherin didn’t want to share with Helga Hufflepuff, I dare assume,” said Harry. “He created this one so he had something to use himself where he wouldn’t be distracted. Alchemy back then was just an inkling to what we have now. This one is very similar, quite suspiciously so, to the one that’s in the Alchemy Classroom. I think he just recreated it, so it may not count. I dunno if it’s functional.”
“I wasn’t trying to be funny, Granger,” said Harry, rolling his eyes. “Plus, if you three keep it up, it’ll wake up the man sleeping. How inconsiderate of you.”
“I died,” said the Baron. “I’m sure you already know that anyone who has met with Death cannot explain the afterlife. Portraits – ghosts – we’re locked behind a thin veil that blocks us from informing you on what happens.”
“The first task will begin momentarily,” said a voice. “You will be allowed to bring in your wand and that is it. Clothing will be provided for you. If you are dumb enough to attempt to intentionally bring in anything else, there will be
Harry glanced at the blank page and gently turned it, revealing another blank page. “How?” he asked, staring at the diary. He turned another, and another, and another, all revealing blank pages. “How is the diary blank?”
Draco nodded and moved away any liquids, “don’t mention it, I did the same thing on my first ride when I was five, I know that’s nine years younger but still.”
How Draco got hooked on Greengrass and fell into a trap was concerning. Draco, while not as intelligent and strong as him, was better at political manoeuvring than he’d ever be. That is why it was so concerning.
“My sixth-born was a lot like my second-born and followed the same path, except he married into royalty. He used the fame of the family to get the hand of a princess. Fascinating tale.
Bellatrix gave a laugh, “Regarding Cissa’s idiot husband I assume.” It was his fault Harry escaped, and she told Voldemort instantly, Voldemort didn’t seem to care as he had the blood needed from Harry to get his own body. But Bellatrix wanted justice for it.
Harry watched in amusement as the girl, Sarah, continued to belittle the other boy. Of course, he heard a few rather vicious swear words used in the next few statements she used, as well as a low-blow towards his ‘manhood’.
“I’m saying what I mean!” said Harry, his right hand plastered over his face. “I have no idea what I did wrong, I tried so hard.”
“I think you offended him,” said Lily with a slight chuckle. She watched her son sweep from the room in a very Severus-like fashion. “Upsetting the birthday boy before its even lunchtime, you just have to set records.”
Everybody finished the song at different times. At last, only the Weasley twins were left singing along to a very slow funeral march. Dumbledore conducted their last few lines with his wand, and when they had finished, he was one of those who clapped loudest.
“Yeah, I guess,” said Harry sheepishly, wiping the drool from his chin. “I suppose I’m hungry myself, because of potions, it always makes me hungry for some reason.”
“Why you decided to stand up for yourself now is dumb, I know you’re a little bitch and you’re just trying to impress someone. What I did to Seamus he deserved, of course he took it on the chin and didn’t tell anyone or stand up for himself. Neville and Harry will get what’s coming to them, I knew Harry always liked snakes, Malfoy was just icing on the cake.”
“Longbottom,” he hissed. “I know you can feel it, what’s this annoying pang in my head that feels like a bad Legilimency attack.”
“– of course, I may say that not many are that colour, it’s a simple over exaggeration as no spell is pure black, just like no spell is pure white.”
McGonagall stood, “Harry won the trust of Godric when he delved deep into the school and retrieved the Philosopher’s stone. Godric watched him closely, Harry did show very much signs of being a Gryffindor, a true one, something not many have been able to say. Being able to summon Godric’s sword is not something everyone can do, theirs only three people that have been able to. Godric Gryffindor, Lily Potter and Harry Potter! Of course, Lily summoned it by accident when a creature went wild and attacked students, James Potter had her wand and she charged at it with her bare hands, the sword appeared in her hands just moments before she reached the beast.” McGonagall sat and let Severus stand.
“Not my fault that the class was dreadful,” said Rosier. “I was simply just applying the same effort.”
Harry chuckled and shook his head. “It’s great to see you again Gemma, I haven’t seen you in a while.”
“Well no one else better give me anything, these balloons are enough,” said Harry, scowling. “I was going to pop them, but then I realised that they may aid in keeping away other people who would dare give me gifts – if they think I already have a gift, they won’t bother. Genius plan, really, not that we should expect any less of what I think up.”
The weeks crawled past and before any of the students had realized it, it was already pushing into June, most were in full study mode and others were mostly bragging that they were able to finish the work without issue. Harry on the other hand was still in the library, spending every day and every spare bit of time that he wasn’t spending with the Hufflepuffs or the Slytherins studying for future lessons and absorbing every and any piece of knowledge. He was walking from the library when he spotted Gemma hunched over a few books with an almost upset expression on her face. He stepped up to her table and smiled at her. “Do you need any help?” he asked with a kind smile. “I’d be happy to give you a few pointers.” He slid down next to her and glanced at the book she was reading.
“That’s quite a unique bit of magic there, something I haven’t seen in quite a long time. Aren’t you afraid that the Ministry will track you through the Trace? They may forgive a single spell with a warning, but more than five and you’re on their list for potential expulsion.”
Harry just smirked, proud that he had hurt Riddle with a charm that was to aid with the crushing of hard ingredients in cooking. He would have to thank his mother for that one later on. “If you wish to kill Voldemort, you’ll have to kill Ginny,” he said, sighing when he realised that both Weasley and Longbottom got a defensive look on their faces. “The possession has gone for to long for any means to dispel it.”
The smug look on Draco’s face flickered momentarily. He had a retort on the tip of his tongue, ready to put Granger in her place when he felt someone push by him. He wondered why Harry looked like someone had stolen something treasured from him at the simple remark from Granger and he was about to tell his friend to just leave it.
Harry made a hissing sound as he stood, no longer wanting to be examined by the infuriating girl. She had no right to come over towards him, demanding answers for questions that did not exist. She was wrong, he knew that. Everyone in the school knew that. Her attempt at overwhelming him with rapid questions was easily ignored and dismissed, her flawed arguments were easily dismissed because she did not have the bigger picture.
Harry and Draco said their goodbyes and left shortly after; they put their hands together and began to walk through the halls hands connected with slight smiles. “Well that was like, four birds with one stone,” Harry laughed and winked at Draco.
“In the kitchens,” said Harry, holding the laugh. “Which if it wasn’t for Narcissa letting us know about that, I would have most likely starved to death.”
A lot of stores sold handcrafted objects that were the highest of quality, made with meticulous care and adoration. Each book has a spell cast individually on it instead of a group casting, making the spells last longer and protect the book far more easily.
Everyone glared at the Gryffindor house as they left; Draco was the first out and bolted towards the infirmary.
“What house would you like to work with to win the housecup?” Dumbledore’s eyes stopped twinkling and he smiled.
James took a rather large stride forwards, closing the distance between them in two quick strides, towards his wife and wrapped her into a warm and tight hug, one that she should feel safe in.
Draco rolled his eyes and followed with anticipation, he had never really had anything there before; he went there but avoided it as the place smelled like garbage and was filled with common folk. “Why does a place, which sells alcoholic beverages close so early?” Draco said, in a highly confused tone, expecting to be laughed at.
The next chamber was so dark they couldn’t see anything at all. But as they stepped into it, light suddenly flooded the room to reveal an astonishing sight.
“Dumbledore’s gonna put something to stop tampering,” he said. “The Tournament as a whole is worthless and not interesting, the fact that I could bypass something that Dumbledore did… I guess that’s a worthy enough achievement and would turn heads more than winning.”
“You do know that you were sitting on that stool for about fifteen minutes, right?” said Gemma, a smile on her face.
Ron smiled, “pretty good actually, I just want to say sorry Harry, I had no idea what I was doing… I would never hate you because you were dating another male; I’ve been down that path.” Ron raised his arms and revealed a silver and black wristband, which wasn’t exactly visible, but Draco saw it regardless.
They continued, hardly taking even a moment to breathe, and soon found themselves heading towards Stoatshead Hill, which they began to climb without even pausing. Each of them slipped over wet patches of grass, fell into rabbit holes, and Ginny tumbled down the hill after a rabbit appear near her and tripped her over.
“He’s a vampire, which he is,” said James. “Believe it or not, Knockturn Alley was named after him. Likewise, Diagon Alley was unnamed and they had no idea what to call it, so they just named it what it was: an alley that was built diagonally. It was never meant to be a stupid play on words as you said. The original meaning was just lost in time and no one cared.”
“Experience and all that rubbish,” said Draco. “It’s mainly to help the younger students get a grasp on Herbology and Potions. I can already assume you’ll be chosen with two others, who? I have no idea. If I had no idea that your primary talents were in potions, I’d dare assume that you’re a prodigy of some sort.”
Arthur finally stepped forward after being silent the whole time, “Narcissa? You don’t mean Narcissa Malfoy do you?”
Harry waited until the large group somewhat dispersed before he made his way to grab the things he needed. He grabbed the ingredients and made his way back towards his table, he placed the bezoar, the 2 measures of stands ingredient, the pinch of unicorn horn and 2 mistletoe berries on the table with a sigh. “I hate that cupboard, I swear,” he stood and filled the cauldron with tap water before sitting down, completely unaware that the entire class was watching him.
“Are you ready?” asked Salazar, dimming the mood once again. “Are you ready to take a plunge into the unknown and the unexplored?”
“Look – this is a shared class across all years,” said the girl. “You’re not in this class. I know you’re not in it. Just leave before the teacher comes and you won’t be in trouble.”
Harry had, over the weeks, become more and more interested with Ginevra Weasley. It was very, very close to almost obsession, but he wondered what her role in this entire whole ordeal was. He wondered what Riddle wanted with the girl, as she was from a failed pure-blood line, poor, had two friends, and was pathetic in every iteration of the word. He noticed that the girl had started to regain the colour in her cheeks and she appeared to be healthier overall, even going out and watching the Quidditch practices with longing.
Severus disagreed with how Lily handled the situation. Treating it as if it never happened wasn’t a good idea, but he would remain silent.
“Thank you, Harry,” said Lily, hugging her son once more. “I’ll keep looking after Nagini, I’m sure that she’ll be eased when promised a few rabbits and such things.”
“I have no intention to just dump information into your little brain and hope something sticks,” said Atieno, smirking. “This is lesson one of four and the other three lessons will be spread throughout the year. Pacing and patience are required for the Dark Arts and there is nothing that will ever overcome that. There is no book in a library, no stasis you can put on yourself, and time travel is signing your own death, so you must do it the proper way. Do I have your word that you will wait and take this as I teach you, even if it takes the span of an entire year?”
Harry woke up at six on the dot, unbothered by the sun that had somehow found its way into his room, despite the thick curtains. He wouldn’t have complained about an extra hour or two of sleep, not that he needed it, but today was the big day that they went back to Hogwarts and he could show off his new badge, which would make everyone respect him, as he would be the one making Slytherin win from now on.
He walked out into the Slytherin common room in a grey t-shirt and some loose slacks, which were also grey. His hair slightly untidy, due to the fact he woke up and then instantly opened presents, although he did brush his teeth, he would be a social outcast if he didn’t. He huffed and dropped into the sofa, next to the girl called Tracey Davis.
“I’m not gay!” said Harry angrily. “I’m not a poof, Granger, no matter what illusion you’re suffering from. I brought Eliott because it’d send a message, not because I had a deep burning desire to suck him off. See, you’re just as disgusted as I am. Don’t preach about something we both can’t stand. They don’t deserve anything, Granger, as they provide nothing. The magical population is struggling, Granger, and two people vanishing from the pool hardly helps anything.”
“Who is this ‘Longbottom’?” asked a man, who prodded the fire with a long stick. “What a funny name!”
Pansy walked in and sat down, “The last event is two houses verses two houses, so Slytherin will throw a match in order to place about third, which means Gryffindor should be able to pick us, as the person who places first cannot pick the person who placed second, if what Snape and Minerva were talking about was correct.”
“I wish to be more than just a simple debater! I’d love to be the Prime Minster, or, maybe, the king!” said Harry, ambitiously. His mind drifted towards the perfect world where he was in charge. Yes, he wanted to be the Defence Against the Dark Arts professor, but that wasn’t a long-term goal of his.
She knew that it was almost impossible to prevent attacks on the mind. No one was insane enough to attempt to create anything defensive for their mind as it could render them insane and cause them to do more harm than good.
Harry couldn’t remember what transpired in that course, but he remembered Draco coming back, mentioning that he got full marks, and then dumped him onto a hospital bed, demanding he not move a single muscle. Of course, he hardly listened and stood to collect a book before sitting back down.
“Now the bad part, the longest a Potter has lived is to thirty-two, most are killed at around twenty-five. Back in the day a ritual was done that protected a Potter heir until he was eighteen, his magic would expand at seventeen, and this gives them a year to learn as much as he could before they had to fight for their lives. Remember the Potters were seen as Dark, even if they did nothing but sit at home and fear for their lives, the difference is you came into this world stopping the darkest wizard of this century, I assume people forgot about your past, or they’re waiting.”
“Whatever,” said Harry, shrugging off the sheer accusation of him glaring. “I cannot do this alone, as painful as that is to admit. I have a foot in the door, but it won’t hold for long.”
Harry nodded, almost as if on autopilot, and returned back to his rampant thoughts. He was currently questioning whether this was a common feeling and that he shouldn’t even bother to try and raise his spirits, just accepting the outcome, or whether he should attempt to fight the thoughts and claim that his parents did care for him. The last letter he had received from his mother was almost six months ago, claiming that everything was fine and that she just felt a little off. His last letter from his father was such a joke that he had forgotten the date that he received it.
“I said it before, there’s no monster in the Chamber of Secrets. It has to be something else.” Harry interrupted smoothly. “While not pure-blood or Slytherins have been petrified, a ghost and a cat have, so it’s not flawless and it could fail, which is something that Salazar wouldn’t allow, even in accident.”
“He can’t’ve lasted this long,” he said, breaking the moment of silence. “Even though the Goblet hardly focused him, it’d be now and Longbottom isn’t some master of defence. He’d have slipped up by now.”
“They wouldn’t have been able to help much, as part of their agreement many centuries ago,” said Harry, remembering the piece of information he had read in the Chamber of Secrets during one of his visits. “They’re bound to cook and clean, not build.”
“Good luck,” he said, giving a smile to Viktor, who was holding the parchment with the number two in his hands. “I hope you – oh, he’s gone.”
“Of course I can,” said Atieno. “I have never forced him to do anything he does not want to. If he shows even the slightest inkling of hesitation, I will cease mentioning it.”
Madam Pomfrey chuckled, “you should invest in some insurance, I think that’s what the Muggles call it, for you know, when you leave school and need to pay for a visit to St Mungo's.” Madam Pomfrey ran her wand over Harry, “as I expected, you’ll be fine, a few days rest and you’ll be back to your old self in no time at all.”
“– of course, that family is so poor that they would steal something as trivial as a Remembrall and attempt to sell it off as an ancient artefact from their household.”
He flicked his eyes up and down the corridor, waiting for something to happen that could startle him. He finally got his bearings together and slowly made his way towards the only bathroom in this corridor, which just so happened to be Moaning Myrtle’s bathroom. He hated the idea that ghosts could lurk in bathrooms and the likes. It was nothing short of creepy and rather off putting.
“Alright, Draco,” said Harry, throwing his hands up. “No disrespect, but if you’ve something to say, just spit it out. Don’t chase me around the corridors screaming, ‘You’. Straight to the point.”
Harry kept a very close eye on Wood and how he was acting during the match. The boy looked confused, angry, concerned and frustrated all at once. All four of those amplified when he realised that the Slytherin team was playing by the rules without a single foul in the ten minutes the game had been in progress.
“Of course you didn’t,” replied Draco, somewhat haughtily. “You just left the Great Hall without saying a word and then vanished in the middle of nowhere!”
“Bloody hell!” said Ron, still looking towards the window, waiting for the owl to come. “Are you being serious? If you are, why have I never heard about this?”
“I did, yes,” he said, blinking. “While everyone was asleep, I snuck out into the Entrance Hall, bypassing all portraits as I know they were watching, and submitted my name with remarkable ease. I thought it’d be much harder than it was to bypass the Age Line –”
“Stop scowling,” snapped Atieno. “The book is in Elvish. You will not be able to read it and I had to painstakingly translate it so that you would be able to learn what the tome contains. This is a rare tome, child. A very rare tome.”
“Will agree once Lucius Malfoy proposes the idea,” said Harry. “He’ll agree, for my sake. If he can’t win it over by throwing Galleons at the issue, he is still quite gifted with words and making people fold, even if they hate the idea. Not that I am saying the Board of Governors will deny this – the next generation is important.”
Nicolas nodded and watched as the house-elf popped into his sitting room, directly next to the boy and then kept its eyes from everything in the room.
“Weasley challenged me to a wizard’s duel,” said Harry bluntly, his eyes focused on his father and he smiled. “Of course Weasley has about as much sense as he has money, so not very much.”
“That’s gross,” said Draco, staring at the snake as it ate the rat. He sighed and pushed it out of his mind as he attempted to end the awkward silence that had begun. “Father is coming tomorrow. He said something in a letter about dealing with the oaf and Dumbledore. I know that you have a very good invisibility cloak, Harry, can we use it and see what my father’s up to?”
The question startled Draco, he wasn’t expecting it at all. He glanced over towards Theodore with a slight smile and nodded. “Yeah, we’re friends, if I recall right I first met him when we were about one, we became friends at a young age, about three or four.”
The owl ate the bacon and quickly took flight from the spot next to the boy and flew out the open window above the students.
George chuckled. “We didn’t until it was in our presence for a year before it started displaying hints when we cast spells on it. We knew it was created by someone who liked to joke around because the advice it displayed was just humorous.”
A woman with red-hair and bright green eyes walked around the sitting room, her son speaking complete nonsense as he looked up at his mother. Her eyes glistened with almost tears when she glanced down and saw her baby boy giggling at her, as if it was funny she was crying. “Oh, Harry, you’re too adorable.” She cooed and kept walking in a half circle in the sitting room. She did debate putting her son in bed, but she knew her one year old son wouldn’t dare sleep until he saw his father.
James was barely able to restrain his excitement, which was further increased when he knew that his son was somewhat excited, too. He saw through the blank expression, the slight shuffling and constant looking around as if something else was present. He caught sight of the slight smile, the narrowed eyes, and the then the eye roll that meant his son had finally realised his internal battle of trying to look disinterested. Thankfully, the suspense would last and not fade due to the short travel time.
“They’re barbaric! The term that describes them is ancient and should be changed. Bloodshed will only lead to more bloodshed if it’s allowed to continue.”
Harry sat on the end of his bed in the second-year boys’ dormitory, his trunk was at the foot of his bed and Nagini spread out across the entire length, allowing him only a few spare inches of room to shift around on. He hadn’t noticed it until now, but the room was somewhat different compared to last year, he just couldn’t explain what about it was different as it appeared so similar.
He wasn’t afraid of some man that had been around Dementors for ten years, not even with the three years of recovery away from them.
“Alright, alright!” said Lee Jordan, throwing his hands up. “Gryffindor in possession, Katie Bell is heading for a clean shot of the goals…”
“Technically it added you to the Malfoy family, as I said before,” said Narcissa, her index finger hovering over Harry on the tapestry. “You have the perfect alabaster skin that most Malfoy men have, the silver eyes, the regent cheekbones, everything.”
Harry watched the professor place down the cup and walk off. “What a load of rubbish,” he muttered, flicking through
“Unhand me this instant, Weasley, these robes cost more than your shack,” muttered Harry, completely unbothered by the blood trickling from his nose. He did debate throwing a random curse at the boy on him, but then he realized that he wanted a perfect record, it would earn him the most respect in the long run. “Longbottom, your parents didn’t die for you to just stand there and gape – oof!” He winced as a fist connected with his stomach. “Weasley, must you be so plebeian?”
Hermione looked surprised, “who sent it, Harry?” She said, but realized Harry was digging through his pockets.
It took a few more moments, and a few more pleas, before Harry’s eyes went back to their slightly bright green and he unclenched his hands and flicked his head towards the headmaster, ignoring the looks that his house was giving him.
He turned toward James, who appeared to be locked in a rather close and dramatic duel with his opponent. The duel looked intense, so intense James had sweat on his forehead, which he managed to wipe away with his arm during an intricate wand movement. He did have to admit, James was talented at duelling, even more so due to him being able to cover all his weaknesses with practised ease. It was something he wished that he had learned during his time at Hogwarts. He would be going into his fourth year and he was just as clueless about magic as he was when he was a first-year student, eager to absorb any and everything he could.
“The Amplifying Charm stops them from casting anything too… forbidden and dangerous,” said James, hesitating slightly. “The last thing that I want is another spell to create an earthquake.”
James honestly knew that simple statement was one hundred percent true, in every aspect that it was spoken in. He wouldn’t stop working until he had most of Voldemort’s forces locked behind bars and in Azkaban, where they belong. He originally didn’t join the Auror department just for that, he had the Galleons to live comfortably and not ever have to work, but he enjoyed working, he couldn’t just sit around and do nothing. Of course, most would disagree and say that becoming an Auror wasn’t worth the risk or the pay, but after a few measly months as working as one he found that he rather enjoyed working alongside Sirius, who was a highly competent dueller. It was more than just being a light wizard putting a stopper in dark wizard’s plans.
Blaise’s heart jumped a beat, “no Harry, I tend to find dating here is a nuisance because you have to bring the girl in the male dormitory, and unless you have your own room like Draco and I have then it’s impossible to get a decent amount of ‘alone time.’ I’ve dated before, but learnt soon that it wasn’t what I expected.”
“It’s not lazy, Draco, it’s productive,” said Harry, smiling as he defended his actions. “Let’s not forget who gave me the initial encouragement to use a charm such as that. Who was it again? Oh, yeah, your mother.”
Lucius collected a few books and papers and tucked them neatly on his desk and vanished the teacup, he hastily walked out. What he didn’t notice was Narcissa closely watching and listening on the side.
Neville jerked his head towards the dormitory door and Ron followed him out, unaware of the invisible person following closely behind. They hurried back down to the Gryffindor common room, which was half-empty, and joined Hermione, who was sitting alone, reading a book called
Professor Snape, who was watching the two boys like a hawk that was hunting its prey, saw the note being written and then pushed across the desk. He instantly prepared to intercept the note, that burning desire only increased tenfold when he saw the look on Draco Malfoy’s face. “Accio Harry Potter’s note!” he said with a gentle flick of his wand. The letter slipped from Draco Malfoy’s grip and towards him.
“Listen to me!” said Draco, turning his hair and snapping his fingers in front of Harry’s face. “Just imagine the possibilities that you could do – that you can do! Imagine, throwing a quill and turning it into a sword! Throw a feather, change it into something midway. I know you like duelling, you have books on it. Transfiguration is hardly used in duelling, but when it is, the person who used it comes out on top.”
“Don’t even try to use the same tactics that Harry uses,” said Narcissa, looking at her son with a shake of her head. “Harry has used that very same tactic more times than I can count and it gets him nowhere. I often take black simply because he likes going black.”
Harry sat there, mentally counting to five as he tried to shove the look of Granger’s face from his mind. He was just about calm until the idiot, Ronald Weasley, had to open his mouth.
“You’re lying, Harry! You’ve gotta be,” said Neville, clutching the red and gold sword tightly in his hands. “We can save her, I know we can.”
Minerva, better known as Professor McGonagall smiled broadly at the fact she would get the first speech, which in her eyes was the most important. “I’ll start with the first-year Gryffindors, as they’re the newest and haven’t been covered yet. Mr. Longbottom has been gradually improving in some of his weaker subjects, but remains at a steady average level and nor falling behind in nay subjects. His strongest subjects are Herbology and Defence Against the Dark Arts, which is to be expected,” she gave the other professors a smile as they chuckled. “He’s still a little behind in Transfiguration, History and, of course, Potions.”
“Exactly what I said Harry, being homosexual isn’t going to get you kicked out or lose you your friends. If a wizard told you that then I have no words, but I can assume it was someone who was confused, most likely a Muggle-Born.”
Harry spent the next few days paying heavy attention in the classes that he was attending, not wanting to get another angry letter or a howler from his mother. He had naturally, of course, sent a letter to Narcissa using Hedwig, who happily took the letter. He wrote and burned so many different letters to his father and finally gave up trying to write a letter.
Lily nodded. “I shouldn’t have derailed this conversation as I have,” she said, standing. “Come on, let’s go in and get some answers.”
He stepped into what he presumed was the second-year Gryffindor boys’ dormitory and pushed open the door, it opened with a gentle creak and he poked his invisible head into the room. He let out a long winded sigh and a breath of relief when he realized the room was empty. His eyes scanned the trunks located at the end of each bed and finally found Longbottom’s trunk, it took all but seven seconds to find, the large N.L on the top in gold lettering was a dead give-away. He walked up to the trunk and knelt in front of it, studying it cautiously, his hands tucked directly at his side. He forced everything from his mind and focused solely on Longbottom’s trunk.
“An Auror?” said Vasily, blinking a few times before he started to laugh quite loudly. His laughs slowly turned into wheezes as he slapped his knee, stuttering something out in a different language for the much taller man next to him, who was also smiling and trying not to laugh. “Wait a moment, you’re actually serious?
Neville shrugged towards Ron and decided that it would have to be him who got the show on the road. “I agree, sir, all these security measures are just wasting everyone’s time.”
Harry greeted Hermione as she walked in, “how was your date with Draco?” Harry laughed, as did half of the Gryffindor common room, she rolled her eyes at him and went to bed. “He must have drained her” Harry winked and he dropped through the floor. Harry decided to go and stalk the Slytherin common room, despite the fact he could fly through walls, the novelty wore off and he went there normally. He got to the Slytherin common room door and didn’t know how to get in, so he started yelled at it in Parseltongue, which garnished laughs from the Slytherin house. Draco got up, much to the disgruntled looks of others and let him in, no one really objected and they had a bit of a laugh, after a few minutes Harry heard Snape coming and stopped, he went bright-eyed and gave a quick wave before flying through the roof, and into the Black Lake, the Slytherin students laughed and retreated into bed before Snape came in.
“I have learned that the ‘Light’ side wasn’t exactly incompetent in the first war, so how come Voldemort lasted so long?” asked Harry, looking at Draco. “Dumbledore mayn’t’ve been the one to defeat the Dark Lord, but he sure did destroy the man politically. I know it was a turning point for your father when the Dark Lord came out as a half-blood chasing after pure-blood ideals.”
He caught sight of a snake, which didn’t look as if it belonged in this climate, having just read about them, slithering across the slightly dead grass and towards the base of the rock that he was sitting on. Pursing his lips he flicked his head over the side and studied the snake closely.
“All magic leaves a mark, Harry, not just Dark Magic,” said Severus. “Dark Magic tends to linger longer, especially around the person who cast it. Put two and two together and you’ll get the answer.”
“I’m not ill, Hermione,” snapped Neville and then sent her an apologizing look. “I think it’s a warning… I think it means that danger is coming.”
Harry felt a small amount if pain for Nagini, who would learn what Fawkes was the hard way and that her rambling about the creature was for naught.
“Nah,” said Vasily, shrugging his shoulders. “I find it tedious. I wish I could go back to school Quidditch, though.”
“Neither of us has touched your personal stores,” said Harry rather defensively. “Maybe you misplaced the ingredients?”
“Betting on children? These people have no shame,” said Harry. “However, that does make his anger and annoyance quite explainable. A lot of Galleons on the line and now they’re pretty much gone, especially if he invested time into ‘training’ his child.”
“I think Granger should be checked for any more suspicious things,” said Harry, cutting in on the blatant bias defending of the Gryffindor house. “The ancient and noble house of Godric Gryffindor have already attempted to infiltrate the Slytherin common room, what else could they be doing?”
“That’s kinda the point,” said Harry. “If you know you’re turning away, the spell would be useless as everyone’d figure it out instantly. Anyway, I didn’t expect it to be here. It’s in the open and in quite the common area.”
“I should have known, Peter why?” Lily pleaded, her green eyes landed on James and then flicked back to Peter. “Expelliarmus!”
“I’ll help you a little more than just that,” said Death. “The light book is protection and healing. Inside is spells that no one knows, spells that could save someone, even if they were on the very inch of death. It’s protective, like a mother, yet warm like a fire in the harsh winter.”
When the two boys left giggling, Narcissa let out a small laugh, “sometimes Harry frightens me, I have never seen a fourteen year old alter someone’s memory, let alone Bellatrix’s… she’s a master in Occlumency, she taught me Occlumency, and Draco. Harry should not have been able to get into, let alone alter her memory.” Narcissa re-heated her tea and pursed her lips briefly, “unless Harry is a master in Legilimency, but I don’t believe that as he’s never done it.”
It was as if all the professors in the school had Apparated into the dungeons as the wall vanished and in they strode, looking around curiously.
“Alright,” he whispered to his mother as he stood. He tried to ignore the warm smile he received in return. “I’ll go and talk to her.”
“You’re bickering,” he said as he gave a pointed look. “If you keep it up, I’m gonna go and sit back on my rock and consider sneaking off again.”
“Is a light bastion designed to weaken the Draugr,” said Asura. “I could get through the magical dome due to the fact that I am pure light magic, not a hint of darkness in my spirit, soul, or magic. My race are light protectors, defenders of light, the final stand against the dark, should all else fail.”
“It’s really good practice,” muttered Harry as he rubbed his hands together. “It shows dedication and a lot of sacrifice. In a team based game, such as Quidditch, sacrifice is an important trait to have because it means you’re willing to do more to win. I don’t care what you do as long as our Seeker isn’t throwing himself in the path of a Bludger to protect a Chaser.”
Pushing the thought aside, he walked down a hill, which had random pieces of logs placed down it, acting as some kind of stairway. It was obvious this was here before the World Cup as there were signs of nails in the wood, holding it all together. As something that
“Don’t be silly, Ron, he’s twelve,” said Hermione. “I doubt that it’s Potter or Malfoy – in fact, I think it’d be one of the older students.”
“Not many spells are that colour, Mr. Potter,” said Professor Snape, his face moulded into one of thought. “In fact, I have yet to see one in my lifetime that is the colour black –”
“Can you not call me that string of nicknames in the future?” said Draco, frowning. “You honestly sound like a very old relative that isn’t sure of what nickname to use, or whether he should use them, so he just uses them all.”
“Oh, Ron, there won’t be anyone in there,” said Hermione, picking herself up off the ground, which she had only just knelt down to look at something, and walked over towards the two boys who were staring at the doorknob. “That’s Moaning Myrtle’s place. Come on, let’s have a look!” she ignored the large
He shuffled forwards, making sure to keep as much in his vision as he could, and kept an eye out for a flash of anything. While all his theories were sound, the task itself could be anything. The cheering could have been artificial, much like the setting, to throw them off. However, he did expect the task to be boring to some degree. It would not be worthy of the build-up it had. Like a cliff where the drop was the size of a regular wooden door, the drop would not hurt. It was like a cliff-hanger in a book that was awful and expected. Although, he could be wrong, which he quite expected. The Tournament often threw him through a spiral and he barely managed to retain control. He was almost positive the Tournament would be a nightmare for a control freak.
“If you should be injured, my blood will be a rather potent healing source,” said Atieno. “That is the one thing Muggles supposedly got right. Our blood heals almost as quickly as phoenix tears.”
“I did,” said Lily, “but it was off and on, as you know. Not long enough to form any lasting opinions.”
“You should inform him soon, I assume he feels the same way, your mother pointed that one out to me. Has Severus spoken to you about it yet?” Lucius hid the forming laugh.
“That’s such nonsense,” said Harry, shrugging. “That’s a statement that was said once and is continued to be repeated throughout the ages. I mean, look at Phineas Nigellus Black, he was a professor of an amazing degree, the most students achieving the highest grades under his tutelage, and then headmaster of Hogwarts. He held none of the supposed ‘Black madness’.”
“Ah!” Voldemort shouted and glanced up at Harry, “and here I was, thinking you would never pucker up the courage and ask.” Voldemort looked back down at the books, “they’re not ready yet to know I’m alive and well, it should be a surprise.” Voldemort added extra emphasis on alive. “Harry, to be honest, I am amazed that you haven’t gone back to Hogwarts.” Voldemort hid the grin that was forming in his book.
“Yes, that seems correct with what I was told,” said Fleur. “Time-Turners cause a disruption in the flow of time if they’re used excessively and it takes a very long time for the direction to repair and stabilise…”
Students flocked towards the Great Hall, almost being late and sat down Harry and Draco walked in together but split up to sit at their respective tables. Harry sat far away from Ron, it wasn’t that he was scared of him, well maybe partially as Harry cannot stand up to him physically and Ron could beat him easily, Harry’s only option was to use magic. Harry began a soft conversation with Ginny and Hermione; the three chuckled softly which caused Ron to snort in their direction.
“I honestly can’t think of a single way that this whole pranking business will aid our House in becoming a top competitor,” said Harry, shrugging. He remembered the talk he had received in his first-year as a Slytherin. “Making a group that’s sole purpose is pranking doesn’t help any of us look mature or intelligent. It makes us look immature, idiotic, and disrespectful.”
“– when you’re asking to remain still, you remain still! Especially when it’s asked by those that actually have a brain and know what they’re doing!”
“Just wait until you see the uniforms that they wear at Beauxbatons,” said Draco. “Even worse than these.”
Harry nodded and watched the third-year flee, as if his life depended on not being there, in a sprint towards the exit of the library. He did debate if it was worth trying to even become friends with the Hufflepuff house as the entire Slytherin house would chastise the Hufflepuffs as failures of the school, despite the fact that the house had better grades and points overall, at least according to Gryffindor, who were currently last. The only issue that he could think up was the fact that the friendship would have to remain as discreet as possible a she didn’t have the natural standing in the Slytherin house to take a hit like this.
Neville and Ron followed Hermione towards the library, which both boys knew it would be there. Of course someone else had the book that was on alchemy however he or she hadn’t loaned it out and may be willing to share the book if they were asked nicely.
“And I assume that I won’t be hearing what they are,” said Harry. “I mean, I don’t really care regardless, but I dislike being left out.”
Note: I messed up the wizarding currency heavily early on. I cannot remember what canon does with it, but it was enough for me to repress.
Hermione dashed up and frowned at what appeared to be the Leg-Locker Curse, she instantly performed the counter-curse and watched as Neville’s legs sprang apart and he fell over. “What happened?” she asked as the boy got to his feet, slightly trembling.
“I can see that,” said Harry. “So, something that creatures can do is considered special for us? That goes against every single pure-blood ideology known.”
“You have five seconds to tell me what you want or I’ll hit you with the most powerful Stinging Hex I can muster,” said Harry, ignoring the boy’s attempts to drive him insane. “I cannot pop the balloons and it appears as if they’re stuck now.”
“I’m sorry, what did you say?” said Harry, trying to compose himself as best as a thirteen-year-old could, which wasn’t very well.
Gryffindor played with brute force and a playstyle set to intimidate and force the other team to do what they wanted.
“Goodbye, mother,” said Harry, leaning back slightly on the sofa. “Have a good night and I’ll wait patiently for the letter from father.” He watched as his mother vanished on the spot on the front porch and his Aunt Petunia freaked out about it. ‘So much for not wanting to annoy her,’ he thought as he sunk back into the horrid looking sofa.
Neville stood silent for a moment. He knew that he had heard a few of those names before. He tried his hardest to think back on where he had heard them, but couldn’t.
Harry had quickly learned, the mere second he left the hospital wing, that he did not need to explain anything at all as everyone already seemed aware that the four champions were facing some sort of personal task or crises. He was aware that he had been the first champion to complete the task, seeing as the Goblet had told him, but he was confused on how Longbottom, a wizard that relies on everyone else, failed the task and came out of the thing last.
“Are you gonna buy the pants that have little trains driving around the waistband?” asked Draco, grinning. “I saw you eyeing them a few years ago.”
The Great Hall remained quiet, pondering over how the Defence Against the Dark Arts professor had died. Some had a slight clue, due to the fact that the man was a known werewolf, but most didn’t look into it too much.
Harry took that very moment to cause some more damage for Longbottom and slipped into the spot he had just vacated, pulling up a chair. “I didn’t think I’d be seeing any of you in here – not attending Herbology? It’s quite risky to skive of the class that your Head of House teaches.”
“I know that, we just improve them and make them better, such as hair products, no Muggle product would last as long as ours!”
He waited for Atieno to start bowing before he bowed, knowing that the duel would start when Atieno wished for it to start.
Harry nodded along with the discussion, already knowing that most of the ancient traditions were hogwash and newly invented, but he didn’t come here to discuss that, he had Draco for that. “I do hate to cut this amazing discussion short, but I am slightly limited by time and unless you have a Time-Turner, I’m afraid we’ll have to pick up the pace.”
Neville speared his hand through his hair as an unsure gesture, his facial expression conveyed just how confused and unsure he really was. “Not all Slytherins are bad, just like not all Gryffindors are brave –” he paused and looked at Ron, who let out a strangled sound. “What?”
“Eleven inches. Pliable. A little more power and excellent for transfiguration. Made from mahogany, yes,” interrupted Ollivander happily. “It’s a debate that has been settled through the ages, most likely back down to even Merlin’s days.”
The house was magical, and he could feel it, not that it made any sense to say it like that. Being around magic for so long allows you to sense it, as a normal person would the smell of food or the touch of water. It’s an unforgettable feeling.
Lily frowned, her eyes flicking between her son and Severus. “What if he decides that he likes life better when he’s in his mind and not in the real world with us?”
Flint ignored everything Harry said and focused on Draco. “I heard that you and Potter were almost inseparable as children, that you’ve been friends since you were about five,” he snorted. “I always wondered why you two seemed to ignore everyone else in the room and focus on yourselves, it became obvious when Gemma spent most of her time with Potter. She’s a known fag hag.”
Draco looked at Harry and rolled his eyes. “This is going nowhere, at least with his explanations. We met in a bar or a pub, whatever you wish to call them and began to talk, after a few drinks we connected on a slight level, I confessed everything to him, that I didn’t feel like I deserved to be his friend and tried to impress him with bullying, of course it failed and it started the most known rivalry in Hogwarts history. Funnily enough, it wasn’t because he was in Gryffindor and I was in Slytherin, especially when Potter was meant to be in Slytherin and used Slytherin cunning to talk the hat out of placing him there – but no matter. What I’m getting at is no matter the house, friends can be everywhere, some Slytherins may know me as the Ice Prince, or leader of Slytherin. Trust me when I saw Gryffindor are great meat shields – hey – ouch!”
It had taken Harry close to an hour to explain what snitching was and how it would be a terrible idea to do. He had to draw up comparisons that Nagini didn’t understand and in the end, he settled for comparing snitching to cowardliness.
“Perhaps,” said Harry, unsure on who actually spoke. “If I’m not fond of my own abilities or have no confidence in them, how can you trust me? A lot of you call yourselves the best in your field at Quidditch and the fact that you’re so certain about it leads me to believe it.”
There was one thing that Asahi said that remained in his mind. He had mentioned how the time in the United Kingdom seemed to jump around. At first, he didn’t understand, then he decided to think about it, noting the previous year and the man was right. Time did seem to jump. He had ideas, but nothing concrete.
“Harry’s very smart,” he muttered, waiting for the moment of painful silence to pass. “He would have known that you were not a real dog. From what you told me, he connected it almost instantly. He tested you right from the start…”
“You’ve all clearly run out of things to say,” said Harry. “Now, if you wish to leave me alone so I can go back to the Slytherin common room and get away from you fanatics, I would appreciate that. If you need a threat to move, I’ll gladly give you all a trip to the hospital wing. Free of charge, of course.”
A flash of eerily blue looking light pressed into Neville’s arm, the surrounding students stood there silently and quietly assessed what had happened. Those who were familiar with healing spells looking at Professor Lockhart curiously, especially a few of the Slytherins.
“Mum, when is dinner?” asked the boy as he paused at the bottom of the stairs, he glanced at the woman who somewhat resembled his mum and then his eyes fell on the boy who was sitting on the sofa looking directly at him. “H-hi!” he stuttered out with a slightly red flushed face.
Harry had to agree and put all his efforts into his book that he had instantly opened and prepared to read once the train began to move. “I was given this book by some stranger I saw in Diagon Alley,” he said to Draco, who peered at it. “It came by owl a few days ago. The owl looked rather ruffled, as if it had seen its greatest fear.”
“I always knew that Salazar Slytherin was a twisted old loony,” said Ron, his voice carrying over the soft discussion of other students, as he, Neville and Hermione fought their way through the teeming corridors at the end of the lesson to drop off their bags before dinner. “But I had no idea that it was him who started all this pure-blood stuff. I wouldn’t be in his house if you paid me. Honestly, if the Sorting Hat had tried to put me in Slytherin, I would have got the train straight back home.”
Harry laughed, “Expelliarmus!” Harry put no effort into it and a scarlet beam shot out from his hand and hit Ron in the chest, flicking him into the backend of the stand.
Harry tried to stifle his laughter, he desperately wanted to turn around and look at Madam Hooch’s face while Professor Snape tore into her verbally, but that would give away his position and knowing it he just stood quietly and listened in as the verbal argument almost escalated to spells being cast. Of course not in this school, it appeared as if the professors had more control than most. Images of Professor Snape and Madam Hooch duelling flushed through his mind; choking on the sheer stupidity of it, he quickly coughed to disguise the laugh as a cough.
“And me,” said Harry, watching as Fleur and her date entered the Great Hall. “Well, I just want to cause unparalleled chaos.”
Lily watched her son leave the room without saying another word, which she couldn’t fault him for. She was aware that he had somehow managed to float his dirty dishes to the sink without even showing it. She had seen him tuck his wand away as he turned the corner, however. Perhaps she would do the same with Daniel and nudge him towards books and studying. She knew that Harry must have spent a lot of time with his magic and casting it to have such a solid bond with it at a young age.
He soon realised that he was moving closer and closer to those rowdy sounding people. If the advice from the man before was anything to go by, he said to avoid them as much as possible as they were degenerates. He shuddered and continued, trying to be as quiet as he could, hoping that he wouldn’t be spotted. Nothing good could come from being spotted walking alone towards a bunch of idiotic teenagers. He had remembered a few rants that Vernon had shared about these particular people. He had called them drunken freaks with little regard for anyone else besides themselves.
He sighed and ignored the curious look Draco sent him. “I’m fine,” he muttered, turning his attention from his friend to the dark corridor ahead. “Just thinking, which is probably a bad thing to do considering what we’re doing.”
Harry placed the ingredients for the potion on the table with a sigh and glanced at Draco. “Next time you’re getting them. That storage area is a mess.”
“I don’t understand what that language is, or what it even means,” said Dudley slowly, watching his cousin glance out the window as if he was a crazy villain from one of the television shows he had watched.
“Loyalty isn’t something that you should scoff at, Draco,” said Harry in a calm tone of voice. “I spoke with Susan Bones recently, as I knew the name was familiar. My father, he speaks to Amelia Bones at the Ministry and often comes home and talks about her. You see, Amelia Bones is the Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, which isn’t something that you should really scowl or such at. Lucius always did say that the Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement is often used as a stepping stone to the Ministership.”
In the middle of the parchment, right where Fred’s wand was, words began to form in scarlet and gold lettering that proclaimed:
“He’s fast,” said Terence to Marcus Flint as he watched the first-year speed after the Golden Snitch. “He’s the perfect build for Seeker – small and fast.”
“Is this about Longbottom’s Remembrall? Because I haven’t stolen or thieved anything,” said Harry with fierce determination. “I was holding it so that it was kept safe, after all, I heard Weasley plotting to break it an hour ago, really cannot trust Weasleys –”
Dumbledore waved off the sarcasm and smiled at the boy. “Very recently, you said something has caused me to reflect on it constantly. You must forgive me for being curious, Mr. Potter.”
“Foolish woman,” a cold, yet drawn voice mocked. “You dare even think you can escape me? I am Lord Voldemort, you cannot escape me.”
“That’s great to hear,” Dumbledore acted as if he didn’t hear what Harry said, “now, when Narcissa, Draco and you all went to Godric’s Hollow something grave happened. When you sat at the gravestone and the message played it stripped the protection of love your mother set for you-”
Draco jabbed Harry in the ribs, “wait, did either of you sleep last night? If so, when did you wake up?”
Dumbledore chuckled. “I think it is rather nice that he is not throwing away his adolescence to studying,” he said. “Miss Granger is on a similar path where all that matters are grades and knowledge. You must not forget to live and enjoy life.”
Standing up to shoo away the bird, he realized that it was already gone, not wasting time sticking around for him to even give it a reply.
“Whatever helps you sleep at night, Weasley, please do speak it,” said Harry. “It’s the least I can do to hop that you get a decent sleep in that shack you live in.”
“Excuse me?” said Draco, pushing Harry’s cup aside. “My brain is perfectly fine, thank you very much.”
“Not dead?” choked Filch, looking through his fingers at Mrs. Norris. “But why’s she all – all stiff and frozen?”
“It’s quite alright,” said Professor Lupin, noting that the boy didn’t actually apologise for being late. “We were just about to head into the other room where our lesson will take place. As I was saying, you won’t need your books today. Today will be a practical lesson.”
“– many witches and wizards, talented though they are in the area of loud bangs and smells and sudden disappearings, are yet unable to penetrate the veiled mysteries of the future,” said Professor Trelawney, her enormous, gleaming eyes moving from face to face. “It is a Gift granted to few.”
Dumbledore still sat at Harry’s feet, enduring the explosions of dark magic that hit him constantly, they weren’t powerful, but just strong enough to deter others away so they didn’t intrude, even after all that he had seen with Harry, this impressed him the most. Harry’s body lifted, like he was possessed and let out a scream, a scream that was filled with different emotions, a scream most wouldn’t understand unless they had lost as much as him. Dumbledore stood still, as Harry’s body finally dropped back to the floor, Dumbledore still muttered in the language most wizards wouldn’t understand. About fifteen minutes of constant dark magic bursts, random screams and images of Harry’s past floated around them, after a brief period of the torment, he was finally quiet, the magic slowly faded and Dumbledore breathed a sigh of relief. Harry awoke and started to speak.
Harry gave Professor Snape one of his usual smiles and shook his head. “Fleeing like a coward would make my death more painful if I were to die. Have faith in me, Sev. I’ll be fine.”
Mopsy nodded her head in supposed understanding, despite not understanding. “Yes, Little Master, but it is being my fault –”
“You care very little about your team,” said Harry. “You don’t care for them at all. You’re using them to win the game. How Slytherin of you.”
“Truce,” agreed Harry, taking a step forwards. “You know that I just love flying. I haven’t enjoyed Quidditch in years. I care very little for the actual sport.”
Pansy scowled and listened to the boy as he dived into a lengthy description about how the Hufflepuffs would help them as they’re the house of loyalty. She out a sigh of relief when someone shouted Potter’s name and the boy stopped his dry monologue sounding speech that contained more use of the word ‘I’ then she had ever heard in her lifetime.
“Wait a moment,” said Ernie, watching the movie for a second. “Why are you so off and on about her?”
“Do you know much about Hogsmeade?” asked Hermione keenly. “I’ve read it’s the only entirely non-Muggle settlement in Britain.”
,” said Lucius, his left hand clenching his temple. “I have no idea how the Weasley’s were able to scavenge together four hundred and fifty Galleons in under a week, but they have and it makes me
It really couldn’t be labelled to Gryffindor-ish behaviour, as it wasn’t exactly like a Gryffindor would act, at least according to his father, which was ignored by Severus completely, every time.
“My godfather and myself pulled the potion apart and recreated it, learning about it,” said Harry. “It’s a horrid potion that causes more harm than it saves. It destroys lives. We pushed for a ‘dark’ classification, but it seemed to go nowhere.”
Harry snorted and attempted to read on. He learned quite the facts, especially considering the fact that a lot of it was nothing more than wild theories and musings of what the man said during his one and only speech. Many believed that Ekrizdis was the reincarnation of Death and that his Patronus was a sign of that.
“Clearly do not understand what ‘hush for a moment’ means,” said Atieno. “So, in case you are unaware, it means remain quiet so I can think.”
“No, it would be bad. I’m pretty certain Harry would turn on the forces of ‘dark’ as he’s led to believe… including Draco and yourself, as he knows you serve me.” Voldemort regained his thoughts, “which means Harry Potter and Draco will go back to enemies and the drama at Hogwarts will continue once again, but I have a plan to get him back with the ‘better crowd,’ Harry at the present time is nothing more than a puppet, he’s being manipulated.”
“It’s funny that you should mention Draco’s father,” said Marcus, his smug turning into a very cruel looking smile, which was mimicked by the entire Slytherin team behind him. “Let me show you the generous gift that he’s made to the Slytherin team…”
Harry gave a small gesture and watched as the students from Beauxbatons and Durmstrang entered the Great Hall. He was curious about how they would react to the room. While it still had a castle feel, he knew it would easily impress the students from Beauxbatons due to the sheer size and extravagance of it. Gloating candles illuminating the room, creating soft shadows that seemingly danced around, large fireplaces adding in warmth and warm light, and the golden cutlery that would make even the snobbiest pure-blood envious. None of that was even looking towards the ceiling that perfectly resembled the outside sky.
Oddly enough, a few of the fifth and sixth-years made for the small alcove to get ready, perhaps not wanting to dress and undress in an unused classroom when anyone could walk in and see them starkers.
If Harry wasn’t furious he would have complimented the headmaster on his wandless and nonverbal Human Revealing Charm. How the old man managed to cast it while focusing on the discussion with Professor Snape and not slip up was impressive. ‘An impressive party trick,’ he thought as his hand clenched around the phial that he needed. ‘What is curious is on how long the headmaster knew that he was actually there and whether he chose his words carefully and acted as if he hadn’t knew. Come to think of it, the headmaster had followed Longbottom with ease last year with the Mirror of Erised as well.’
“He’ll be upset for a little while until I tell him that I didn’t pay thirty-seven Sickles for it,” said Harry, smiling widely when the old woman made a noise of understanding. “He’ll be thinking about it, then he will understand that I did it intentionally as he’s told no one else that he hates spending money… mainly to keep up appearances of being a spoiled pure-blood. Either way, he’ll be thankful about it. I most likely make no sense at all.”
“Because both of them know me far too well,” said Harry, amused. “Professor Burbage hasn’t ever spoken me outside of today, let alone see me, so she would be easy to confuse or push in the wrong direction.”
“Stupid mistake Ron, even if it is you. You assumed because I had no wand I couldn’t do anything, you tried to hex me during Quidditch and failed, you attacked me. Be thankful that we were once friends and I don’t report you, but I’m not stopping anyone else.”
Harry turned to Salazar and realised the man was gone from his portrait. He turned and gave Atieno a confused look before folding his arms and sighing.
He decided, rather quickly, that comparing modern day spells to those that were cast almost a millennia ago was pointless. Even if you did compare them, the spells that the Founders cast had been sublimely powered by
Draco kicked himself, clearly Harry didn’t hear it, “yes… grab… now… go…” Draco replied and reached for the Snitched but missed, Harry grabbed it and landed, with Draco not too far behind.
Harry nodded and walked over to the cauldron, he dragged the blade up his wrist and watched the blood flow from his wrist into the cauldron, the pain made the carefree voice vanish and he dropped the blade in response, “WHAT DID YOU DO TO ME?”
Remus gave a soft, yet calming, smile as his pale face tightened slightly. “I’m sorry for being late, James, I got held up at the Ministry, it’s not a pleasant place.” He muttered the last few words more to himself than anyone else. “Lily – and is that little Harry? I haven’t seen him in months! He’s grown.”
“I cannot argue with that,” said Dudley, unaware of what he was really supporting. “I mean, I’m not as smart as you, clearly, but I get by.”
However, while everything may have been calm in the Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, and Ravenclaw common rooms, the Slytherin common room was filled to the brim with excitement.
Harry slipped his Herbology work towards Draco and peered at Rosier’s work. “This parts wrong – oh, and this part.”
Draco quickly pulled the box from his robes and placed it where he found it. “Luckily, they didn’t find much. Father’s got some very valuable Dark Arts stuff,” he watched as both Crabbe and Goyle jumped to their feet. “What is wrong with you two? You’re both acting… odd.”
“C’mon, we’ve got to be quick before it fades,” he said. “Follow me and don’t look to the left. Just trust me, it’s not worth it.”
“Yes,” said Lily. “What did you get on your exam results? I was so excited to get mine that I almost fainted!”
Of course, that would never be the case and he found himself spending twenty minutes stumbling around the wooden fence, which was coated in enchantments and protections, before giving up and dealing with it another day.
task is concerning. There’s something I keep missing, something I’m sure you’ll be able to spot and decipher quicker than anyone else.”
“Is it a good thing that the Soring Hat had placed him in Slytherin? If I recall, it is rather hard to acquire power there due to the house being filled with mostly noble and wealthy pure-blood families.”
Professor Snape directed all the students into the hidden duelling room, which had been replaced with a barebones circular table, one that was large enough to seat the entire Slytherin student body. “Sit,” barked Professor Snape, waiting for the first-year students to shuffle into their seats. “No one speak. No one move. No one breathe.”
Theodore let out a barking laugh, his hands clasped around his sides. “Salazar!” he said. “Did you see their faces? I swear one of them wet themselves!”
James paced around the sitting room, wincing with every few steps that he took. He glanced down at his torso, which was half covered in bandages, and sighed. He rubbed at his face and slowly dropped into an armchair, hissing in pain. He did not regret breaking the demanding orders of the Healer he visited. He had things to do, things that could not wait until he healed. He needed to track down the Master Mutilator and his accomplice.
He, along with the other Slytherins, began to take the course. They were seemingly satisfied with the lack of screams and shouts from the other students. It had nothing to do with stereotypes on the Houses, more like pure-blood children being raised by paranoid parents that demanded their children remain safe and cautious. However, with the previous three years at the school having something happen, no one was going to rush into a course that could spell the end of them.
Draco chuckled, “alright Harry, I just want to warn you, Pansy is planning on grabbing you and dragging you to the Slytherin common room. Let me save you the issue of being dragged by a girl and come with me.”
“You’ve been in the Restricted Section,” said the manager, a knowing look on her face. “I went in there once and quickly left straight after. Dealing with some of the books there weren’t really appreciative of being opened.”
I do not do these often as it spoils the chapter, but some people dislike this topic. It is mainly discussed and spoken about.
“I mean,” started Draco, his blush deepening. “When he enters my head, I feel nothing in particular, but when Professor Snape does it, it hurts slightly.”
Harry pulled his hands away from the door, a gesture that would have appeared comical from another person, and glanced at his hands, wondering if the door had burned him. He felt something latch onto his mind and try and push in. ‘The door was trying to control me,’ he thought, his thoughts louder than usual. ‘How does something in my own mind try and attach itself to me?’
Draco frowned but shook his head quickly. “The History of Magic professor is of course Professor Binns, he taught my father and mother, and most likely your parents too – that’s it – that’s all I’m saying, I’m not ruining it for you, as others did for me.”
“Mr. Potter, I am glad you could make it,” said Dumbledore as he waved the door open, revealing the Slytherin boy mid-knock on the door. “Would you like a sherbet lemon?”
“Longbottom wasn’t killed by Voldemort! That’s what makes me hate him! Voldemort should have killed the pathetic excuse for a wizard the night his parents were killed by the man!”
“He’s not that bad, really,” said Draco, biting his lip and shifting a bishop between two different places. He glared at the board when he realized no matter what he did, Harry would take it with no consequence to him at all. He moved his piece for angrily, almost breaking the piece as he slammed it down. He looked up with a smile. “Blaise and I have known each other since we were little.”
Lily froze, her green eyes darting between Bellatrix and the Dark Lord. She didn’t dare hold Harry any tighter, due to not wanting to hurt him.
“I know that Marcus Flint, the Slytherin Quidditch team captain, would almost dive at the chance for some easy tutoring, especially if it helped him raise his grades. Despite Flint’s appearance, he knows a fair amount of advanced spells that he would teach you for help, seeing as they’re not as rich as other families.”
Filch, ignoring the rare display from the students, grumbled forwards and stepped into the empty circle that the students were circling around, as if to afraid to step any closer. His eyes fell on the three Gryffindors, who looked terrified and then onto the wall that they were staring at. “What’s all this?” he asked grumpily as his eyes travelled up the wall and landed on his cat, Mrs. Norris. He instantly looked around for the culprit, his eyes landing Harry Potter, who had a smug look, and his snake, who was wrapped around his feet. “YOU!”
Draco rolled his eyes and felt rather lonely instantly, what would he do for three days without Harry too hold onto?
“If only it were that simple,” said Harry. “When you’re a child, no one takes you seriously. Likewise, when you’re a teenager, no one takes you seriously. If the person you’re speaking to is older than you, they won’t take you seriously. No one wants to admit that the youth knows more than they do. No matter how mature, how well you speak, or how well put together you may be, they won’t listen and will always see you as a child trying to be an adult. I saved the Minister for Magic and, not even a month later, he forgets I did it and starts treating me like he’s never heard of me. It’s insane.”
Harry’s lips formed into a smile, especially when the basilisk splashed her tail into the water, spraying all the occupants, except him, with water. He glanced upwards when he heard the trill of the Headmaster’s phoenix. He wasn’t foolish like Voldemort, he knew that the thing could prove to be an issue for the basilisk, no matter how old and intelligent the basilisk is. The phoenix is simply older and has a more pronounced history. The blasted bird is immortal, unlike the basilisk.
“He had a traumatic event and needed to come home,” said Narcissa. “He’s fine now and I’ll bring him back within the hour. I think it foolish that you disallow students to go home when they please.”
“I have no idea what you’re talking about,” said Ernie, somewhat confused. “How do you say complete nonsense and then turn it on me? It’s not fair.”
“That was rather smart of you, Ron,” said Hermione, looking impressed. “Ron is right, though, we didn’t put up a fight and we ran at the fear of losing more points for Gryffindor. We’re ahead currently, despite all losses, so I’m sure we could convince Professor Dumbledore about it.”
“That’s awfully black and white of you, Weasley,” snapped Harry. “It’s most likely due to the fact that I’m in Slytherin and Godric charmed it to burn a Slytherin whenever wielded by one. Awfully pathetic of the man, to be honest. It could also burn Hufflepuffs and Ravenclaws – or maybe it’ll only work for the person who summoned it, in this case, Neville, so stab her, Neville.”
“How much for the quill?” he asked, reaching into his pocket. “Even though it’ll never get used, it is a core item I need to mend this fragile friendship that is only fragile when I overact.”
Draco woke up earlier than normal the next morning, he felt like he slept a century and his mind seemed more clam now, but it still felt blank, like he was missing something, like it was a void. He flicked his legs from the bed and took a quick shower and got ready for the day. Blaise knocked on his door with a smile wider than the hallway.
“How thick would Nev have to be to go searching for a nutter that’s out to kill him?” muttered Ron softly, as if trying not to wake up the sleeping man next to him. “No one, not even the Head of Azkaban, knows how he got out of Azkaban, seeing as every precaution was taken. No one’s escaped before… no one has even tried before.”
“Potter, I’m sorry to bother you and such but the library closes in fifteen minutes and Madam Pince sent me to inform you that she would like everyone out of the library.”
“I was just being polite, mother,” said Draco, his eyes narrowed on her. “He throws a fit when I take black from him.”
“I believe we could do a study group,” said Harry after ten minutes of debating. “We make a study group with the Hufflepuffs and we work from there. With the loyalty that we gain from the Hufflepuffs, the Ravenclaws will have another reason to come to us and form a study group of three, turning the tables on the Gryffindors.”
Nothing else was said and Lily held Harry’s arm and led him towards the place that they could apparate from and with a simple twist of her wand, the two vanished with a crack and landed at King’s Cross station a split-second later.
“Your attempt at getting sympathy from me won’t work,” he said, crossing his arms and lifting his chin. He glared at the boy for a second before dropping his arms. “We’ve been over this topic before, Weasley. This
“Longbottom isn’t anything special,” said Harry, looking somewhat annoyed at the fact that Justin was calling him evil. “I would tell Justin that he shouldn’t fear him and that Longbottom is nothing but a fat lard that can hardly cast first-year spells. I have never seen or heard him speak to a snake before and I saw nothing in his mind when I’ve peeked in it. I think that Longbottom was just as spooked that he could speak to snakes as the rest of you.”
“What Atieno is trying to say is that anything that wizards did was explained away somehow,” said Salazar. “What are you learning in History of Magic?”
“Oh, Draco, he’s not going to tell you,” said Rosier. “He’ll just smirk at you and shrug it off, claiming you were seeing things in your hysteria.”
“I don’t understand,” said Harry, frowning. “That entire statement contradicts itself. Even if he asks another professor, he isn’t really relying on himself to learn and study the material. I can assure you, headmaster, I am handing him the theory to learn as well as all source material as we go along. What’s the point in attending school if he’s not learning because a few professors are bias and not giving him the best education? Let’s not forget that the Hufflepuff and Slytherin first and second-year study group was closed down. It’s rather obvious that someone, not naming any names, wishes for Slytherin to remain the most hated house in Hogwarts.”
“Yeah, that,” said Lily. “Of course, being Harry, he tweaked it to resemble magic and kick became spell.”
Marcus had his hands full trying to keep the two nuisance twins from diving on Harry, despite his size, those two were determined to insure that Harry received some sort of retribution for what he had said. He spared Harry a brief glance and realised that the boy wasn’t even bothered at what he had said.
“Not about that, I have a rather strong feeling that the headmaster has contacted my parents about my recent attitude and such. Weasley and Longbottom cornered me in the library earlier and accused me of making Granger cry.”
“He cannot harm Draco, well he can, but I assume he won’t. He will most likely take him to stay and cry on his shoulder; please do note that when he gets back he will find you instantly.”
The Gryffindor team walked out a big clump, the crowd roared when they made their appearance. Harry didn’t recognize most of them. He noticed the twins sending mocking glances at the Slytherin team. In the center was Neville Longbottom, looking almost terrified, he was talking to the Gryffindor captain.
Harry turned to face the headmaster with a blank expression. “But no one has done anything to quench these rumours, have they?”
Professor McGonagall stood silent for a moment, staring blankly at Neville Longbottom, before she snapped out of it and placed her hands on her hips. “Of course, of course,” she said, her eyes flicking between the two boys. “I realise that this has all been hardest on the friends of those attacked. I apologise, boys, for not thinking of this earlier. I saw Mr. Potter in the hospital wing a few days ago, and I wasn’t sure why and then I realised that he had struck up a friendship with Mr. Finch-Fletchley.”
“Oh my dear, it’s not for you… unless you’re an owl.” She laughed at her own joke and walked into the other room, she was grunting and shouting at things like usual.
“Enough!” said Dumbledore, his tone still clam, but his eyes flashed a little. “What about Mr. Weasley, Mr. Potter?”
Harry threw Severing Charm after Severing Charm at Longbottom, who managed to either dodge them or block them with his weak shield. While most would consider the Severing Charm to be harmless, it wasn’t when thrown by him, he had intent to cause harm and that’s what he wanted. Each spell was targeting Longbottom’s wand hand, and it took four, but one got through and the boy let out a sharp intake of breath.
Harry was somewhat thankful that it wasn’t singing as Tom’s words popped straight back into his head about how he and the things would react.
“What else am I meant to say or do?” said Harry, looking across towards his mother. “I refuse to get on my knees and beg to be allowed to stay in a school that I never wanted to attend anyway.”
The snow had lightened just a little bit, instead of falling all day and night, it only fell at night time and early mornings, causing anyone who wanted to jog or walk around the lake to require extra amounts of clothing and enough scarfs to cover half of the castle.
“Has he ever?” joked James, picking up two pieces of toast. “I’m pretty sure he wakes up before us and attempts to dress himself.”
“I spoke to Severus before, he wasn’t able to stay long a she had some important business to attend to, one of his potions in fact.”
He glanced up, eyeing the headmaster with a discreet, yet cold look, waiting. Said headmaster kept his twinkling gaze on him throughout the meal and this is how he learned that Professor Snape had indeed told the man of his night-time activities.
“I know he won’t,” said Harry, muttering. “The change was far too quick. His personality flipped and everything about him changed. People aren’t going to forget that even though he studies all the time, he almost failed his second-year. His charisma came from somewhere, almost suddenly. It will vanish just like that, too.”
Draco couldn’t help but roll his eyes. He had to admit that he was curious to see what Longbottom was afraid of. “What about you, Rosier? What do you fear the most?”
“Don’t you dare talk to me like that,” said James instantly, his hands clenching. “I’m your father and you should treat me with respect and not yell at me and demanding things like you’re a four year old.”
“You think you have some kind of Seer related vision? Trelawney’s a fraud. She couldn’t predict anything.”
“Exactly,” said Atieno. “You did not want to learn the spell and therefore you could not. These special spells, abilities, and talents require commitment, time, and full understanding. There is one spell created by a controversial figure that is truly unique for a wizard. I dare say it would be right up your alley.”
“It’s a part of the Hogwarts uniform and ties are great fashion accessories anyway. So, are you excited for the tryouts today? I am.”
“Whatever Harry is doing, I’ll do.” Draco was sure Harry was now a shade of red and he was moving a little bit, obviously nervous or embarrassed. Draco gently pulled Harry back and let out a faint whisper, “Merlin… Harry, please stop wriggling, just remember that you’re sitting on my lap.”
“Well – something – I’m not sure if I can tell you, Harry,” said Lily sadly. “Sirius went after the man who betrayed our family, while Remus had things to do, he didn’t tell us much and in return, we didn’t tell him much.”
He took the owl and kissed Harry on the forehead, despite his objections about looking him look weak in public. He did the same for his wife and walked towards the Leaky Cauldron to floo home.
Harry slowly moved towards the main street, sneaking as if he had just stolen the most priceless piece of art known to man. He made sure that Draco was behind him and not too far away. His eyes darted left and right, searching for any signs of danger or anyone else that was trying to get the jump on them. He had no idea what was attacking, but he was not going to foolishly only look directly ahead of him. He knew that if the attackers were human, they could be lurking on the roofs of various buildings, hiding behind anything, or even invisible.
“I feel exhausted,” said Harry, dropping back down. “My whole body feels numb. It’s like I’m not getting any stimulation to the joints – I don’t know how to explain it. My head hurts, my mouth is dry, and my eyes are itchy…”
Lucius didn’t believe the boy for one moment. When you spend twelve years with someone, you tend to know their behaviour and mannerisms. He knew that Harry was a decent liar, but not to those that he cared about. His face got conflicted and when he lied to someone that he didn’t want to lie to, his eye would slightly twitch. He watched hopelessly as the internal battle in Harry’s mind continued. He debated about turning to Narcissa and asking her for advice or sending her off to talk to the boy, but she gave a small shake of her head.
“Thank you for the compliment,” said Selene, unsure of how to address such compliments. “You have nice hair as well.”
“Think about it,” said Harry. “Lupin can handle Dementors with relative ease, something most wizards fail to do. Dementors just so happen to surrounded the castle, allowing Lupin a cover story.”
Harry smiled widely, turning slowly towards Draco with a look of pure satisfaction, his eyes slightly squinted as he took in everything that just happened. If the boy had not trusted him at all, he would not have spoken, no matter what was happening. Instead, he would have remained quiet, pretending that he was not there. He was somewhat thankful for his soft and calming voice, even if he believed that he did not have it. It allowed him to calm people down and earn their trust surprisingly easy. He had an innocent sort of tone, one you would expect from a Hufflepuff.
“Draco, he is alive,” Hermione snapped, “you need to be brave for the both of you, he has been through a lot, Merlin knows what they did to him.”
The name was almost boring and bland compared to the alias the man used, which was able to strike fear into anyone who heard it. Jeremy had been average in school, often handing in his homework late, had a serious fear of Severus Snape, hung around some nice boys who went on the invent some new plant species, and was in Hufflepuff. However, over the course of the years that the boy attended, he developed an unhealthy obsession with alliteration, often only handing in work that displayed it.
“You’re not allowed to be here,” said Harry, gesturing around the Quidditch pitch. “It’s off-limits. Forbidden. You’re gonna have to move elsewhere.”
The large group fell into their own discussions after that, nothing else but their soft footfalls as they made their way down the hill and towards the small village. The rays of the sun slowly pushed over the village, allowing from some light as they made their way through a discrete alley and through the town, unaware to the residents living there.
“A basic one is simple,” said Harry. “Dumbledore’s not gonna allow anyone under seventeen to enter their name in the Tournament that has an unbreakable contract. The Goblet itself could choose a five-year-old. It’s a massive risk.”
“Yes Master, whatever you want Master.” Draco mocked and turned to go into his room, of course some bright spark made him and Blaise share a room, well not exactly share, unlike other houses most of Slytherin were wealthy and therefore put money into the rooms and the layout, Draco got his father’s old room and it was probably one of the most lavish rooms. “Are you coming Blaise or are you planning to stay up all night?”
short,” said Harry, noticing the older students for the first time. “Regardless, I’m sure it’s meant to be done based on year level or we wouldn’t be separated like we are.”
“You know, I’ve been thinking about the Sorting Hat and how it sorts people Gryffindor,” continued Harry. “It’s a house for those that the Sorting Hat feels sorry for – see, we have Longbottom, who has no parents. Then we’ve got the Weasley infestation, who have no money.”
Harry slowly opened his eyes, groaning as the sun pushed straight through the window and directly on his face. The first realization was that he wasn’t at the Dursley’s house or on the Muggle street, where his last memory was. He had soft, silky sheets pooled around his ankles and a rather large quilt pushed around his torso. It hardly took more than a guess to know where he was, and that place was none other than Malfoy Manor. The warmth and the comfort of the bed and sheets just wanted to make him close his eyes and go straight back to sleep, no matter the time.
Draco obliged and kissed Harry, “I love you Harry,” he rubbed his cheek and walked off towards the Slytherin common room, Snape sighed a breath of relief and sat down to grade some papers.
“Mopsy being doing well?” asked Mopsy, her eyes filling with tears once more. “Mopsy being a good house-elf to Little Master?”
The last second-year climbed off his broom, panting. Sweat trickled down his face as he breathed harshly, trying to regain his composure.
Harry studied the cloaked figure, who had just materialised out of nowhere. Perhaps it was the fact that the thing’s cloak was as black as the sky outside, or because he wasn’t able to actually see further than an arm’s length in front of him. “You want me to follow you?” he said, exhausting all other options that he could think of. That one made the most sense.
Draco stood slowly and made his way up, he would have scoffed and told the old man to shove it but something wasn’t right, and he wanted to figure it out. He dipped his head into the Pensive and watched, as he messed around with Harry, they spoke to each other with sincere respect and kindness. He didn’t know it was possible to blush in a Pensieve but he did when he saw them messing around and again when he was naked and Harry saw it, he pulled his head out and let out a soft sigh.
“Was that a threat, Potter?” yelled Wood, his face tinging a slight red as he huffed, trying to yell at the second-year. “I’ll show you, Potter!”
“Do not worry too much about being bested, Harry,” said Atieno, vanishing all the vines. “A druid is arguably the second most powerful being on the planet.”
Filch had a look of triumph as he entered his office. “That vanishing cabinet was extremely valuable!” he said rather gleefully to Mrs. Norris. “We’ll have Peeves out this time, my sweet.”
“I don’t want to doubt you, Pettigrew,” said Harry. “But you sound like you love the Dark Lord. I understand doing certain favours and earning his favour, but what you’re going on about seems like you’d do
“That’s what we’re trying to figure out,” said Ron, his eyes wide. “It makes no sense, I bet a Slytherin snuck in here and stole it.”
“Don’t think like that,” said Lily, frowning. “I know that the previous topic was wearing you thin, I could tell by how one-sided the conversation appeared. I would speak to you all day if I knew we could do it. I heard a rumour about a young boy who was hit by a curse.”
Harry laughed and nudged Draco, “that’s where we’re going now!” Harry gave her another hug, and they parted ways. They reached Snape’s door and Harry gave a deep sigh, he pushed open the door, only to see Dumbledore and Snape sitting on a rather comfortable looking couch, Draco didn’t like it, he trusted Snape, but not Dumbledore, he still remembered how Harry felt about him deep down, but still, Draco sat next to Harry who was seated near Dumbledore, “hello Albus and Severus, you wanted to speak with me?” Harry beamed with confidence.
“Ambition, cunning, resourcefulness, and self-preservation are the four big traits that people tie to Slytherin. What we all forget is that fraternity is something that is also common in all Slytherins. We should be looking out for each other and protecting each other with genuine interest. This united front that is displayed is weak, pathetic, and disgustingly transparent. The other houses do not look at us and see us as united.
“Ah, that is not a phrase that I have ever heard before,” said the man, smiling. “I do think I understand what you were aiming at. I do agree with your sentiments, however. A wise man will accept defeat should it cause less damage than victory. We are prideful, but not so much that it would stain our honour. Sometimes victory is also a defeat.”
Draco walked into the common room and raised his eyebrows when he saw Harry fighting Theodore, he leant against the wall and lowered his voice.
“Oh, yeah, for ten months of the year I’m off at a boarding school,” said Harry, hoping that David wouldn’t ask for a name. “But a lot of parents talk up their children’s education. Talking it up, to make the child appear more smart and cleverer than they really are. Sadly, the child is then thrust into a light that they had no idea existed and forced to meet unforeseen standards.”
Draco was not fooled, and neither was Snape, they knew it was about Harry, and Draco would find out why later, they took Harry into Snape’s office, Dumbledore carefully took the wristband from Harry’s pocket, he examined the wristband, “odd, very odd…” Dumbledore muttered.
studied this, Longbottom, and I’m not Granger and I won’t recite it straight from a book… these are facts, real facts!”
Harry watched Blaise’s stunner come towards him, “Duratus!” Harry said when it was about two arm’s lengths away. “Praeliabitur Leporem!”
“I wouldn’t be… we were simply stats facts. However, we may be older but in some sense, not as wise,” said Perenelle, her tone filled with some sort of regret. “We never should have made the Stone public, people wouldn’t have any clue and wouldn’t seek after it, but not much we can do now.”
“Prat,” finished Madam Malkin with a smirk. “You should avoid him, Neville, I have no idea why you try to be friendly with him, but it’ll never work.”
“I assume so,” said Draco. “I don’t think it’s as complicated as you think it is. Maybe that’s what the creator was aiming for, you know? To make people overthink it instead of focusing on the smaller picture.”
“It’s been a massive organisational problem,” said Arthur, sighing. “The trouble the Ministry had with the World Cup is that over a hundred thousand tickets were sold, with more than that expecting to arrive for last-minute seats or to camp out. The Ministry was unable to find a magical site large enough to accommodate that many witches and wizards. There are places Muggles can’t penetrate, but imagine trying to pack a hundred thousand wizards into Diagon Alley or Hogsmeade. Anyway, the whole Ministry’s been working constantly to find a site large enough, and out of the way, that we can all fit into.”
Inside was a dark purple grimoire that had golden edges around each corner, slowly bleeding into the centre of the book. He knew that the book was from Atieno. No one else would have such an old and beautifully decorated book or grimoire, as Atieno called them.
“A Draugr,” said Atieno. “Before you ask, we have discussed them briefly, but they can shapeshift, much like a Boggart, and therefore you would have had no idea. In their native lands, they are known as Aptrganga. Shapeshift, immune to all forms of magic, become more powerful when magic is cast on them, emit a stench that rots your insides, and can control hundreds, if not thousands, of Inferi with very little thought. What their ‘pets’ see, they see. They gain abilities through their creations, too. It can speak English because it devoured someone who could speak it.”
“I question that every day,” said Lily. “I know that a major event is coming up and I was curious if I could have James for that event.”
“Good job, let’s get this over and done with as soon as possible, before Severus catches on and has a fit.” Dumbledore held out his arm once again and Draco took it.
“Alright, alright…” Lily repeated over and over in her head after the first two times. She made sure it stuck in her head that it was a good idea and that she was doing right by her son, she couldn’t bare losing him. She slowly crept closer to James and Harry, making sure her son was alright. “Let me – hold him, James, let me.” She pleaded, her arms held out so her son could be placed in her hands. “She held him tightly and walked around the kitchen cooing over him. A loud thump on the door startled her and she grasped her son tighter than she should have at that moment, not that he complained. “Fuck!” She breathed out.
It was about that time the Great Hall’s noise peeked again, most whispering about how the famed Boy Who Lived continued to break rules and such other nonsense.
Severus sighed, “Potter you must accept money, I said the same thing and was forced to take it, in the end I just left it in my vault and slowly gave back to Hogwarts, maybe you can use the money to buy the class books or something. I use mine to buy potion ingredients.”
It took her a few minutes of deep thought before the answer popped into her mind and she almost couldn’t believe it.
“I’m not exactly sure how to address this situation,” Dumbledore finally said, breaking the silence, he began to stroke his long beard. “I have a feeling theirs dark magic involved, but very little proof that it actually is-” Dumbledore shot a glance to Hermione and Ron, “-I cannot see Harry dying to a single punch, seeing as he has survived The Killing Curse!” Dumbledore added extra emphasis on the spell and glanced back at the wall behind the two students. “A lot of my brain makes me wonder if Lucius Malfoy had any idea what is going on, it’s odd how he came and took Draco out of school, but Draco writes to his family often…” The twinkle in Dumbledore’s eyes was gone, “Hermione, you look like you wish to speak, you may if you wish,” he gave her a slight smile.
“That just backs up my point even further,” said Harry as he shifted towards the sinks. “I cannot bind you to any form of agreement as I don’t have the time to write one up, but if I hear even the slightest whisper of this I will come for you, no matter you are hiding. I don’t care if you’re cowering under Voldemort’s robe. I will blast him out of the way to get to you. Do I have your silence?”
“I’ve never heard about this,” said Harry. “I simply assumed that Knockturn Alley was just another, well, distract of Diagon Alley. It shares the same stupid play on words as Diagon Alley, I assumed that it’d be just the same. Sure, it had less strict rules and was often void of anyone from the D-M-L-E. Wait, Knockturn Alley has its own laws? Does that mean that another part handles that? I mean, unless – oh my God, you’re going to tell me that some cliché magical mafia is in charge of it? You’re not serious, are you? I was
Lucius attached the letter to Draco’s owl, and then sent it to deliver the letter to Draco, it flew off happily and Lucius let out a loud sigh, and sat back in his chair. “This is going to be a long and tiring process,” Lucius said to the nearby house-elf gave him some tea, he smiled back at the elf.
“They’re not gonna blame us for it,” said Harry, interrupting the rehearsed ‘I’m a Slytherin and the school hates us’ speech. “However, you’ve got a point. Maybe we should just wait for a professor to drop by and then we can act like we only just noticed it.”
Theodore lifted his head and stared at Harry. The question came after a moment of silence and it startled him slightly. “No,” he said softly, “and not many still do, depending on who asks and for what purpose. The first lesson pure-bloods learn is about blood, which leads into family and history about the family. Among pure-blood lines, family is important, that’s about all that’s taught these days.”
He allowed himself to be gently nudged out of the small fenced off grassy area they arrived in without any sort of complaint, whether outwards or inwards. He knew that another group of two or three families would appear in the next two to three minutes, assuming everything was on time. However, knowing the Ministry, families would be arriving well over their scheduled times.
“You have to be a Malfoy, slicked back hair, and an arrogant expression, think you’re somehow important because your name is ancient. Mother told me not to worry about you, even less when she realized your mother was Narcissa Black.”
“It wasn’t that funny!” snapped Harry, glaring at Rosier, who was snickering. A sudden voice, the voice that belonged to Filch and a meowing of a cat, filled the room. “Come on, hurry up! This way.”
“I am smirking because I find it amusing that despite how mature you attempt to act, you still find the time to doodle in the dust.”
“Where’s Justin?” said Harry innocently. “I promised to give him my notes for Defence Against the Dark Arts, the attack on Mrs. Norris and that first-year Gryffindor unnerved him and I promised that I’d give him my notes so that he could study over them and relax a little bit.”
Lucius read the note and grinned, he was glad his son was performing this task, to please his Lord. He apparated outside of the Dark Lord’s cave, he was confused onto why he couldn’t apparate in, but assumed he pushed the last of his magic into upgrading the wards so no one can get in, in case Harry’s soul had a beacon on it. Lucius walked past the traps with ease, and walked into the Dark Lord’s chamber, which closely resembled the Chamber of Secrets, he raised his eyebrow at the thought and continued along.
If you read the past notes, they all still apply. The information on the Manticore will most likely be put into the story somewhere, more in-depth and relevant. I really should not have put it here.
“No, no. No, he’d hate me if I advanced a year and left him behind,” said Harry, thinking. “It’s not that we have the same classes, or anything like that… I think he just wants to graduate together.”
“Excuse me,” he said to Professor Burbage, who nodded at his raised hand. “Will we need money to buy popcorn and drinks?”
“So why did he just try and kill Neville?” cried Hermione, this afternoon’s events certainly seemed to change her mind about Professor Snape. “I know a jinx when I see one, Hagrid, I’ve read all about them! You’ve got to keep eye contact, and Snape wasn’t blinking at all, I saw him!”
“I assumed that you lot would share friends, seeing as you tend to share clothes, beds and everything else.”
“Fascinating,” said Lily. “I’ll pick your brain about that later. However, the Trace does not seem to apply to you unless…”
“Don’t you dare blame Nagini either, she spent the entire day with me. Never once leaving my sight.”
“There are two things wrong with what you just said,” said Harry. “One, you’d never go to the library willingly, especially not for a mediocre subject that you don’t care about. Two, I know you and I know that you’d never forget about a Quidditch game, no matter who was playing in it. You knew every team and their schedule when you were ten.”
Harry studied Weasley, watching intently as the boy shuffled through a nearby wardrobe. He knew that Weasley was trying to bait for a response, knowing just what to say to trigger one. Of course, he was far more intelligent than Weasley and knew when and when to not speak. Although, when he noticed Weasley had more clothes than needed for a weeklong holiday, he decided that, maybe, Weasley was distracted.
Harry glared. “If you’re going to interrupt me, then you will not be hearing about my amazing adventures.”
Harry made a humming noise as if thinking. “Let me think for a moment, I’m sure I can think of something in less than five seconds. Ah, yes, the moment that I, your son, was sorting into the so-called evil house and that meant that I was evil and clearly not worth your time,” he huffed and rubbed at his temples. “Y’know, it was bad enough knowing that my own father despised me because a piece of fabric decided to place me in a house that is called evil because of short-sighted people. How can an eleven-year-old be evil? How can a twelve, thirteen or even a fourteen-year-old be considered evil? I’m sure that Voldemort himself wasn’t born evil, nor did he just randomly decide that he would start killing people because he was sorted into Slytherin.”
Draco laughed, rather abruptly. “Not really Harry, not until we buy you some new clothes anyway. Of course you can opt to keep them here and make that room your own, you can come stay every holidays if you want. If people want to get fussy no one can touch you here, even less now with the power the wards have.”
Harry, Tracey and Pansy all spun around and searched for the voice that was pretty much shouted from directly behind them. All three of them looked at the girl with pigtails almost as long as her arms with slight confusion.
“I swear, James, it’s that Potter luck that I used to laugh at,” said Lily. “Every time you mentioned it, I would laugh and think you were joking but the sheer amount of things that happened were nothing short of coincidental. The fact you did what no one would have done and moved in front of him, then the fact Watkins’ spell went
“How can you not feel bad for what you said at all?” asked Hermione, the robe hiding her face dropped, revealing a face covered in fur. “What you said was horrible! Even if I had no idea what it meant at the time, you still said it to cause distress!”
The upside was that Muggle-born students cowered and shook before the boy that could petrify them and read their thoughts by meeting their eyes. Every single Muggle-born student gave Harry Potter a wide berth.
“Alright, I kept you up past your curfew, but that’s to be expected,” said Professor Snape, standing. “Bed time is usually at nine sharp, no later. It increases by thirty minutes as you go up a year. This isn’t the case for Astronomy nights, however, you’ll be in bed for a one hour nap at seven and then woken up at eight to prepare for your lesson. You’ll be escorted by a Prefect and you’ll be dropped back here by the professor.”
Harry smiled, glad that the woman actually understood, and put down the quill, frowning at the thick lines that had been drawn. He expressed his displeasure, which led to a genuine laugh, and tilted his head, taking a deep breath.
“It’s too bad that size doesn’t mean talent,” sneered Draco. “Although, I can see why you got a big wand, to make up for your lack of talent.”
“I’m not looking forward to the clothes shopping,” muttered Harry, defeated. “I do enough of that with Narcissa and Draco.”
“I guess,” said Draco, following his mother from his room, the letter that he had written to Harry was left forgotten on the desk, not that he really needed it now. “Harry needs his beauty sleep, if he doesn’t get the required hours, it’d be like staring at a hag or something.”
“We goblins stopped speaking Gobbledegook around you wizards because you got offended by not being able to understand or speak the language within three seconds of hearing it,” said the goblin in a rough voice. “We goblins spent many years in positions to learn the language that you humans use frequently. The less we speak our own language, the less you can learn about it.”
“No, my boy, Albus and I go back a long time and he’s a great person and an even greater headmaster. He has odd ways of going about things and nine times out of ten, they go the right way that he hopes,” said Nicolas. “His plan would have worked flawlessly as what he said it all worked out, just something else happened that he couldn’t explain.”
“That I said I would hang you from a bridge if I ever caught you following me,” said Harry. “Not as eloquently as that, though, and I’m sure I stumbled a bit and used a less threatening word than hang. Probably leave. I’d leave you on a bridge, which I did.”
Slytherins had this particular mentality where they had to be seen as better than everyone else. They got upset because they think that’s what Salazar wanted and planned for his House. He had learnt that the four founders covered everything, at least at the time.
“When I asked for an explanation, I meant about the move that you just did as it made very little sense, not about girls, you git,” said Draco with a slight laugh. “You know, father gave me the same talk, I think. Like what do they expect me to do while I’m here?” He glanced back at the board, his fingers toying with his bishop as he eyed Harry’s knight carefully, he could take it, now he just had to make sure the piece couldn’t be taken. He broke out in a smile and laughed.
“It was horrible,” said Ron, his voice slightly higher than usual. “Did you feel how cold it went when it came in?”
“Fifteen points from Gryffindor.” Snape said with an annoyed look, “do I need to teach you two how to act like mature adults?” Snape spat at them both, before shaking his head and looked back down at his desk. Hermione shot Harry daggers and Ron just shrugged. Harry just lost Gryffindor thirty points in no less than five minutes.
“I’d like that,” replied Harry, his bright green eyes going taking in everything around him. “Everything feels so familiar… but so different.”
James Potter quickly rose up the Auror ranks, and had a clear sight for Head Auror. Of course it couldn’t happen until the current Head Auror resigned or was demoted. Rufus Scrimgeour was about as cutthroat as you could get and kept the Aurors in top form, but that kind of attitude wouldn’t last long, the man seemed dead on his feet half the time.
Harry glanced toward the voice, blinking at the figure of a woman made out of bright blue flame. He wondered whether that was the magic of the Goblet manifested into human form. He blinked as a robe with the crest of Hogwarts appeared, a green cloak popping into existence shortly afterwards. He spared a glance toward Longbottom, noting that the boy had a red cloak.
Harry laughed and slipped his hand into the front pocket. “I don’t –” he paused when his finger brushed across a piece of wood. “The hell? This isn’t mine!”
“You see, the spell requires a steady drain of your magic,” said the druid, speaking calmly. “The drain starts very small, barely noticeable, but the longer the spell continues and the longer that I am here, the more magic it will drain. The drain will continue until you are nothing more than a – what do you wizards call them? It is a derogatory name, I am sure.”
“Now, now, Weasley,” said Harry, walking behind the trio with a smirk on his face. “Did you not understand what I had said during the class?”
“May just do that, Justin, thank you,” said Harry, smiling. “I’ll let you go now, I’m sure you want to go and surprise Ernie.”
The silence continued on after that, neither of the two willing to strike up a conversation as they twisted around corridors and seemingly evaded all students in the dungeons. Only the sounds of faint breathing and footsteps echoed throughout the deserted corridors.
He turned to the group near him, realising that all but Rosier and Draco had left, and made an expression of deep thought. It should have been obvious, but he could not exactly determine what made him so sure.
“I could speak for an entire day and not even cover an inch of dirt that family has,” said Pansy. “I’m sure Skeeter would love anything on that family.”
“Of course not,” said the druid. “However, each bit of corruption we absorb makes us weaker, which is why your friend here did not do anything too extreme. It was nothing as serious as the corruption I just cleaned – a very powerful and careless creature was just here.”
The sound of something hitting the side of a goblet drew the attention of everyone towards the front, all chatter silencing as the gazed upon Dumbledore, who held a fork and a goblet in each of his hands.
Harry tensed and swallowed the insult that he wanted to throw back at Nott. He had to admit, as did Tom, that it was a good jab and he shouldn’t underestimate the boy. Who knew what kind of façade the boy had in this group, especially considering he hardly paid attention to anything Nott said in these meetings.
Harry spotted Professor Snape, who was scowling at the event, and moved towards him, clenching Draco’s hand as he moved silently. He knew the moment that Professor Snape’s eyes locked onto where he was that he had been caught. How the man always spotted him was infuriating to say the least.
“Right, keep both Mr. Potter and Mr. Malfoy at the wall, if they speak at all the spell will extend one hour and they will stay there for as long as they remain quiet,” h=e said finally, glaring at the back of the two boy’s heads. “Teach your lesson; I do not want to come back here in fifteen minutes because you left your class alone.”
Harry tuned the conversation out and instead debated silently in his head whether it was worth it to make the spell he was debating to ensnare at the feet, or to make a solid cage.
“Hello,” a boy with freckles and red hair burst out, holding his dirty hand outwards. “I’m Ron, Ron Weasley.”
“Really?” he said, glaring at Bernard for a split-second before turning it onto the Master Mutilator. “I think you asked me to fight him ‘cos you’re scared. I mean, you’re trying to hide from facing me at all. It’s no problem, I can deal with Bernard before you can blink and then I’ll turn onto you. I’m a well-rounded dueller, you –
“First thing we’re doing is taking you shopping; you’re buying a completely new wardrobe for school.” Hermione smiled.
“I won’t keep you here, by demands of Lucius Malfoy; you two are to sort out this childish behaviour you seem to always show. Once we think you’re fine and got over your arguments, then you may leave.” McGonagall then left and closed the door, leaving the two boys staring at each other.
Harry wasn’t sure how long he actually had sat there and either nodded or shook his head politely at whatever Arthur Weasley had said. Sometimes the man raved on about his job or Muggle things and never seemed to mind that the conversation was one-sided.
They followed the Gryffindors all the way towards the oaf’s hut, thanking Salazar for the easy way into the oaf’s hut.
Harry launched into a tale of how Peter Pettigrew attacked them while they were in the bathroom, dealing with Rosier’s constipation. He explained that the statues started to attack them and they had to run as they’re model students and didn’t want to damage anything. He briefly touched the fact that Pettigrew had cornered them and that they were lost due to all the twists and turns.
Hermione took out a list of subjects and titles she had decided to search while Ron strode off down a row of books and started pulling them off the shelves at random. Neville wandered over to the Restricted Section. He had been wondering for a while if Flamel wasn’t somewhere in there. Unfortunately, you needed a specially signed note from one of the teachers to look in any of the restricted books and he knew he’d never get one. These were the books containing powerful Dark Magic never taught at Hogwarts and only read by older students studying advanced Defence Against the Dark Arts.
,” said Harry, waiting for the said snake to return. He glanced around the hallway, making sure it was clear he glanced back up towards the portrait. “
“You are so enthralled by him,” said Daphne. “Tell me why a Potter, of all people, land in Slytherin?”
“Of course,” said Draco, grinning slightly as he slid open the compartment door. “This is a prime location that is in some serious demand. Do you know why? I’ll tell you why. The little door just behind this compartment is where the trolley lady begins her rounds. Her cart will be full.”
“It’s two on one, professor, both Ron and I have been taught by James Potter, the Head Auror, recently in duelling, so we know spells that others don’t.”
Harry gently rubbed Draco’s back, “come on Draco, let’s go to bed, we’ll talk about it tomorrow,” Harry gave a reassuring smile as they headed towards the Slytherin common room.
“He’s far too hot-headed and argumentative,” said Lily, shaking her head, “Your father was like that, too. Thankfully, he matured from a little snot-nosed brat in his second or third year and started to actually take everything seriously. Back on topic, you don’t want to be the boy who stopped someone from attending the last World Cup in the United Kingdom for their lifespan. That’s a stigma that won’t go away.”
“Just like that? Escaped? Wow,” said Harry, pushing aside his empty plate. “I honestly thought that no one could escape because the Dementors made it impossible. If you’re in close proximity with them for too long, they make you feel far too weak to even bother getting up, let alone escape.”
Harry sat in the Headmaster’s office, his feet were placed stiffly on the ground, all etiquette training coming out in full force, much to the amusement of several portraits. Despite the fact he knew that James wasn’t going to attend, a seat was set out for him and it was, unsurprisingly enough, empty. He carefully observed the headmaster, who was more preoccupied with eyeing his bowl of treats as if he just wanted to reach in and snatch one out and eat it. He watched das if it was in slow motion as the headmaster slipped his hand into the bowl and pulled out a wrapped yellow candy,  unwrapping it and slipping it between his lips quicker than it should be possible to do at the age he was. He couldn’t help but sneer at the man.
He discreetly retrieved his wand, practised the wand movement silently for a second, before doing it again, speaking the incantation.
Harry entered the Great Hall, noticing that the Ravenclaws were already seated and waiting for food, and instantly the smell of kippers, tureens of porridge, toast, eggs and bacon filled his nose. The ceiling was rather dull and cloudy, which raised no one’s mood. He slumped down onto the Slytherin table and pulled a glass of cold milk towards himself, along with a plate and piled eggs onto it, as well as some bacon.
was so dull to read that it would put an insomniac to sleep as if they were a baby. Most people would chapter skim and gain knowledge that way and even if his father did check the book, he would have to sift through more than three thousand pages of complete nonsense that may not even contain the correct information in the correct chapter. A perfect cover-up.
Had the Weasley twins been able to recreate the supposed destroyed map created by James? As much as he hated to admit it, James was very talented and was a powerful wizard. He sniffed and twirled his wand in his hand, the tip almost connecting with his forearm as he did so.
“HEY!” shouted Harry, his facial expression set in a betrayed look. “I find that very, very, very offensive. I’m clearly not going there to find trouble or even anything like that. I simply assumed that you lot would be intelligent enough to notice my plan when I mentioned it.”
“A list of all students in the House,” said Harry, snorting. “It’s mainly for the first-years to help them fit in and feel welcome. It’s a list of power and prestige. I learnt that the list is a façade and serves no purpose.”
“You only have to think them, Harry, not speak them,” said Lily honestly, she turned from her so and began to do the very same.”
“Bellatrix wants him, she wishes to cleanse her family name, and I do hope she succeeds, that will hurt Harry, and I may be heartless, but after Sirius’ death Harry will be the most vulnerable, and that’s when we strike. Sometimes I don’t even want to kill the boy, I would love to have him in our ranks and I will not stop saying this, but he will fight to the death.”
“That’s a good boy, now sit down and eat your bread while I go and fetch someone who will help me make you look pretty when the Dark Lord comes.”
“I must agree with Severus on this matter, Aurora,” said Professor Flitwick. “He spends most of his time in silence and actively avoid open conflict. He may know an answer in class and he’ll give me this look that says that he knows it, but won’t raise his hand like Miss. Granger. It’s a look that says that if no one else knows, he’ll tell me.”
His head spun around when he heard thumping down the stairs, it sounded like a heard of hippogriffs were in the house and stampeding down the stairs, he was wrong, however, it was a rather large boy, about his age, perhaps a little bit older. The said boy was wearing a bright green t-shirt with a jacket around his torso, it seemed to be pulling tightly, close to ripping.
Harry watched as Lockhart slowly came to, blinking. He had noticed that Lockhart’s spell had started and began to fire when Riddle had hit his spell back at him and sent him hurling through the air. He briefly wondered whether the airy expression on Lockhart’s face was because of a concussion or because he no longer had any memory. There’s a reason why self-Obliviation isn’t a thing.
“Pathetic,” hissed Harry in agitation. His eyes turned to the engraving of the snake that was looking at him curiously. “Wasn’t it changed by that fifth-year prefect as a joke?”
“Harry told me last year that he could speak to snakes and that he was a Parselmouth,” said Draco, hiding the betrayal on his face. “I cannot believe he told you before he told me!”
Draco walked down the Dungeons, in search for Harry, he remember the conversation he had with him last night, and decided to check the Slytherin common room, Harry can just fly through the door, Harry was the only ghost that wasn’t really limited in what he can or cannot do. Sure enough, he saw Harry in the Slytherin common room. “Harry, what are you doing here?” Draco glanced at him, really hoping he wasn’t going to turn into another Moaning Myrtle.
“Before you all have breakfast, I would like to explain a few events,” said Dumbledore, standing as straight as possible. “I would like everyone to remain quiet while this issue is addressed. It is only respectful and I’m sure this is exactly what the person would wish. All questions, no matter what they are, will be answered after everything is explained. Is that understood?”
Neville Longbottom had become famous for his heroic defeat of the Dark Lord, even if the cost was his parents, he wasn’t without any friends or family as he still had his grandmother, Augusta Longbottom.
“It seems so unnatural,” said Petunia. “Although, I do recall lily getting a letter for using magic outside of school, have they changed that rule?”
“Maybe he just need sa good pranking idea,” said the Baron thoughtfully. “That always gets him back on track.”
Ron held onto Scabbers tightly, sensing the rat’s fear. “It’s alright, Scabbers,” he said, soothing the rat. “That nasty man isn’t here anymore… I hope.”
He glanced up at the estate, trying to get a better look, even as he pushed open the black iron gates, hoping that he wouldn’t get a nasty shock for doing it.
“Right,” said Draco as he walked away. He and Rosier were friends, but not like he was friend with Harry. He put up with Rosier because Harry did.
“We wait,” said Harry. “Nott won’t stop what he’s doing. He’s hit a high peak and, while not a lot, a quarter of Slytherin is behind him. He’ll continue whatever he plans to do, trying to undermine Gryffindor and get more
Percy rounded on Ron, his chest puffed out, his nose pointed down at the boy. “Get. Away. From. There,” he said, as he started to chivvy them along, flapping his arms. “Don’t you care what this looks like? Coming back here while everyone’s at dinner…”
“Don’t worry, Harry,” said Lily, holding her arms up, which caused Daniel to hang from them as if stuck. “He won’t be able to let go of me or get away until I cancel the spell.”
Draco let out a relieved breath, knowing that his mother wouldn’t talk about him being caught attempting to zip up his friend’s zipper. It was odd, in every aspect.
“I did,” admitted Rosier, shrugging. “But I ate it when you didn’t wake up when I teased you with it.”
“They are all called spells, despite the fact that a few of them are charms,” said Professor Moody, beginning to write each spell and a brief summary of what it did. “There is the Contestant Spell, the Attacking Spell, the Defending Spell, the Scoreboard Spell, the Name Adding Spell, the Tracking Spell, the Banned Spells Spell, the Timer Spell, and the Stationary Spell. They do exactly what their name suggests. They can be cast in any order, mostly, but it is best if you stick to the order the creator used.
“Not so much,” he said, speaking before anyone else could. “I’ve heard a few mutterings from different people in different places, but nothing that could say what’s going on. The Minister seemed quite excited when I spoke to him last…”
“The Goblet of Fire will be placed in the Entrance Hall tonight, where it will remain easily accessible by all students that desire to put their name forth. Any student that is over the age of seventeen will have free reign in the Entrance Hall and will not be punished for being out of bed.
He stared as a pair of students, Gryffindors by the looks of it, began to lather the stairs in a substance that looked wet and slimy. Without hesitation, he flicked his wand, vanishing the substance without a second thought. He had no idea when having a laugh turned into attempted murder or an attempt to maim another student. Perhaps, maybe, he was getting old and no longer understood the youth. He attached a firm expression onto his face as the two students turned around.
“I agree, Sir. It seems so weird that Harry was nearly killed so easily, but… I cannot help to think that this may be a trap,” she looked at her feet. “We were in the class when Harry was struck by Malfoy, he was fine, he was hurt, naturally… but not nearly dead,” she paused. “It just doesn’t add up, Sir.” She forced the last few words out and shot Ron a glance, he seemed rather pale. “I believe Draco Malfoy is innocent, at least.”
Harry scowled but nodded, he wanted to see this so-called Muggle school that made the fat kid proud. “Yes, that’d be fantastic, I like to expand my horizons.” He flicked back open his book and settled on ignoring the other boy.
“I think we should get your wand now,” suggested Lily softly. “It’s by far the most important and I’m sure you’ll just adore having it tucked away, it brings a feeling of safety and warmth.”
Harry took the few tense moments of silence that had popped up and decided that he would look at the newly reborn phoenix, which Nagini was still muttering about softly. He couldn’t argue with Nagini that she looked two hundred percent better than the newborn phoenix, especially with its red and gold plumage that would make his eyes bleed whenever he saw it. He absent-mindedly stroked Nagini’s head through the fabric of his robe and went through different scenarios in his mind, the first one was of course getting the study group between Slytherin and Hufflepuff back together.
“Female snakes tend to be more queens than anything, while males are rather defence and will strike if annoyed at all. The snake I have at home is a female, and she’s so much like a kitten,” explained Harry, it was slightly wrong and not documented, judging all snakes by Nagini’s attitude and what she has told him is not a good idea, but oh well. “I can assume she only come near us because her nesting place was disturbed, therefore I am going to place her somewhere where she can rest and not be disturbed by people poking her with things, which I’m amazed they’re not dead or at least heavily injured.”
Justin clasped Harry’s hand, holding it for a minute, and shook it, smiling. “Thanks, Harry, I’ll see you around, yeah?”
“Well,” said George, “when we earned around ten Galleons, we started to go to Professor Snape, who was rather annoyed at first, and see if we could purchase any old ingredients.”
It had absolutely no effect; one of the pixies seized Lockhart’s wand and threw it out of the window, too. Lockhart gulped and dived under his own desk, narrowly avoiding being squashed by Neville, who fell a second later as the candelabra gave way.
Harry nodded and frowned when his potion didn’t do what he wanted it to. He muttered to himself and stirred clockwise a few times, causing the potion to become a viscous substance that was not close to being right.
For a second, Neville was almost sure Dumbledore’s eyes flickered towards the corner where he and Ron stood hidden. His eyes flickered with various types of emotion.
Severus stepped in the room, “no need My Lord, Dumbledore has kept me on a short leash, something about you have a plan to rise again, little does he know you already have. Something which would have been ruined if this half-wit was as advanced in Occlumency as he said, if I was able to get in his head easily, Dumbledore could have in his sleep. Before I tell you anymore I would like him to leave, I do not trust him.”
The whole Hall burst into applause as the Sorting Hat finished its song. It bowed to each of the four tables and then became quite still again. Harry sighed with relief when it finally shut up, he was hungry and getting annoyed, the Sorting Hat took up valuable time explaining things he already knew, he wondered why he was never told about this part though.
“I will be doing the brewing,” Malfoy laughed asserting dominance over Harry. Not that Harry cared; he hated Potions, “I am obviously better at this than you, Potter.” Draco smirked at Harry; Harry was just confused on how Ron could deal with his partner. “I may even brew something to help you stop dreaming about me.” Malfoy’s laughter penetrated Harry’s ears and made him see red.
“But nothing,” snapped Fudge, swiping at a few quills, knocking them aside. “I assume this is personal because I cannot imagine you barging into my office, a week after my attempted assassination, aggressively if it were not.”
“Oh now I see why you wanted to come here today,” said Draco, his tone calm. “We have twenty minutes until it starts, perhaps we can get in now and get your books,” he grasped Harry’s hand and led him though the crowd of old women. “Excuse me, my friend and I would like to enter the store so we can buy a few books before those hordes –”
Ron whipped out his Spellotaped wand, but Hermione stood by his side and sized his arm and whispered for him to look out.
“Well, we can just add that to the list of questions we’ll ask Malfoy when we’ve taken the Polyjuice Potion,” said Neville, sinking back onto his pillows. “I hope it tastes better than this stuff.”
All in all, he felt that this was going to be one of the greatest lessons he would ever have and he was quite excited.
“Potter is not caring!” snapped Daphne. “That moron locked me in the Shrieking Shack and then ran off with
Harry had to do a double-take at the malice in the girl’s voice, but it hardly phased him that someone was afraid of him. He was in Slytherin, of course, and that meant his presence was probably for no reason besides to defile the pristine Muggle sanctuary.
“I hate to agree with Potter,” said Ron, unsure of how he should continue on his train of thought. “But when he said that competent wizards should be able to deal with Pixies, I fear that he was right.”
Harry watched as Rosier dropped his head into his arms and muttered about how it was hopeless. He felt a small pang of sadness for his friend and imagined if his own mother was going through the pain and suffering that Dragon Pox often left on its victims.
Severus muttered under his breath and continued towards the castle, his legs carrying him and Harry at a speed that shouldn’t be possible for a human, but he needed to get out of here and away from that man. “Once you’re awake, Harry,” he said, looking at the pale boy. “You and I are going to have some very serious words about you talking to strangers.”
“Indeed,” said Harry. “Maybe we were lucky, or maybe Nott knew he’d fail and that’s why he wanted me to do it.”
“Actually Ron, I met Draco first in Madam Malkin's, he had no idea I was Harry Potter either, he started rambling about ‘Pure-Blood’ ways and such nonsense and then he insulted Hagrid, the person that helped me… and I’m sorry for interrupting.” Harry pursed his lips.
They were stopped at the entrance to the Great Hall by the headmaster, who was peering at them with concerned eyes.
“Do you have everything?” he asked when the boy’s laughter stopped. “Of course you do, don’t you? Not like Longbottom who can’t even pack his trunk correctly.”
Neville stared at him. Tom Riddle had been at Hogwarts fifty years ago, yet here he stood, a weird, misty light shining about him, not a day older than sixteen. “Are you a ghost?” he said uncertainty. His eyes flickered between Harry and Tom, noticing that they seemed to be standing almost similar. It was a foolish suspicion. He focused back on Tom, holding his eyes.
“I don’t know why Hermione is making us search this!” moaned Ron, gesturing at the piles of books. “It’s useless! Who cares who Nico –” he paused, spotting the Slytherin with an amused smirk on his face, just off to the side. “What’re you doing Potter, spying on us?”
“Did you now?” asked Harry, grinding his teeth as he followed behind. “It only took you a week. What an amazing accomplishment for such a fine Auror force.”
“Harry can be very hot-headed and rash when he’s annoyed,” said Neville. “If you annoy him, he tends to do or say things that he shouldn’t, despite his talent in Occlumency and his sheer intelligence. It’s a flaw that Lily has exploited over the years when he was hiding things from him.”
“Five points form Gryffindor,” snapped Professor Snape, his voice cold and bitter. “You will address your professors with the correct amount of respect.”
Selene leaned in, a mere two inches away from Draco’s ear. “Good practice? This is the only time I’ll ever being doing this, and unlike you, it’s my first time in a dress!” She leaned back and wiped imaginary dust from her top as she stepped closer to Draco. “Why are people staring at me?”
