"You are too friendly with people from other houses," one explained.
"Who is Ms. Greenaway?" Harry questioned Snape.
Before Harry could change his mind, he stood and blocked Draco's  path. Draco stopped and looked up at 'Jamie' with slight confusion. Harry placed both his hands on Draco's face, leaned forward and kissed him chastely before pulling back. Both stood there in shock before Harry turned and ran away.
"Yes, I know I did, but I didn't expect you to be in my room. You are supposed to help me in Hogsmeade," Harry explained shrilly.
"Don't bother, Snape!" Harry spoke over Draco's shoulder as Severus lifted his wand to cancel the spell. "It won't help. The only way to get in or out is if I take it down or I'm die." Severus sighed, why did he have to teach the brat that spell?
"What…?" He managed to squeak out before he cleared his throat and tried again. "What do you mean?"
Finally, after a month, Harry gave up trying to get Draco alone and made the decision that he would say it with the whole school present at lunch if he had to. He decided to talk to the Malfoy heir after their Charms class.
“I have a splitting headache actually.”
Severus raised one eyebrow. “Well, well, he can be taught. It’s good that you understand.” Snape started to walk away.
The common room was quite different than he remembered it from sneaking in during his second year. It didn't seem as cold, both figuratively and physically. There were more paintings on the walls, furniture and study tables, and there were a few more fireplaces. All of it was done in silver and shades of green. A half dozen students sat around doing various things, including Blaise Zambini. Blaise was the only Slytherin their age Harry had recognized when Malfoy was pointing people out. Everyone else hadn't come back or he didn't know them.
They’d turned him into a GIRL!
"Sure, but I'm probably not very good." Harry changed the subject just in case he said the wrong thing. "What else is there to do?"
"Thank you, Draco. I'll accept it. Is it alright if I charm it back to my room? I don't want to lose it in Hogsmeade." Harry didn't want to offend the other boy by just making the rose disappear.
“Harry!?” She set her book down and rushed over to him. “What happened!? Shouldn’t you be in the the Hospital Wing?”
Harry was lost in thought as he walked toward the Great Hall. So lost in fact, he slammed into someone and ended up on the ground. He looked up to find none other than Draco Malfoy staring down at him. Harry was about to throw a nasty remark at Malfoy when he remembered that he looked like a girl. Malfoy would be suspicious if 'Jamie' spoke to him the exact same way that Harry Potter did.
He couldn’t believe the other man would use his son like that. He yelled at Lucius. Told him how he was disappointed in the blonde. James would have continued if Harry hadn’t have spoken up next to him and told him he was a hypocrite. A bloody hypocrite to be exact. He then informed the occupants of the room that he knew about James and Draco sleeping together. James just stood there dumbfounded at Harry’s words. Lucius turned red and made to punch James however they all froze and turned towards the doorway as they heard a smash.
"Wait, you asked…ASKED it to put you in Slytherin?" Malfoy interrupted. "Are you nuts? No one ever wants to be in Slytherin, especially after… Besides, you cannot ask it to put you anywhere. It just tells you."
"I don't know if I can. I need to think. Don't talk to me for a while." Ron turned and stomped his way  towards their previously shared dorm room.
"Way more cozy than it was when those Deatheater scum were around." Harry was flabbergasted. He didn't think that he would ever hear any Slytherin say they were against the Death Eaters.
Draco folded his arms across his chest as he glared at Harry. Draco snapped with a bit more venom than either expected. Harry blushed in embarrassment which Draco ignored. The blonde grabbed his father and yanked him up into a seated position. Lucius pushed Draco off and glared up at the other two. He made it clear he was fine and just needed them to hand him the half drunk bottle of scotch before going back to whatever they had been doing beforehand.
"Yes, he wanted to get away. He needed time to adjust." It wasn't a like Hermione reasoned. They had all spend the summer before Harry's birthday in America sightseeing. It was when they had returned to England for his birthday that the twins had played their prank. It was how they had come up with the idea that he went to study abroad.
Poppy grinned and left the two children to their conversation. She thought the school would be okay and not revert to the school rivalries now that Harry was back to himself.
“Why didn’t he just give it to me?“ Harry asked as he took it.
Snape stepped out of the shadows, “Yes?”
Harry leaned his back up against the door and slid down it until he was slumped on the steps. Draco took up the spot next to him.
“But Uncle Sev-” Draco started when he was able to talk again, but Snape interrupted.
"To a first year Slytherin. During our fifth year I came across him being nice to one of Umbridge's victims. He was comforting the boy after he'd had a detention with her. It surprised me. Right after that we snuck into the Department of Mysteries. I forgot to tell you about it."
They walked side by side towards Hogsmeade. So much for not being on a date, Draco thought. He stuffed his hands in his pockets to keep himself from grabbing 'Jamie's' hand. He couldn't understand why he had such a strong urge to touch the girl all the time. It was inappropriate for a proper wizard to want to touch someone he barely knew. It was strange. He felt like he knew the girl; like she's always been in his life. But that was crazy. He shook his head and focused on 'Jamie' instead.
Fredrick Roberts- Ravenclaw
"Are you sure?" Draco inquired.
"He won't kill you. He might hex you, but he won't kill you. Besides, it's not like you're in a relationship with Draco." Hermione stopped when Harry looked away from the bushy haired girl. "What aren't you telling me?"
Hermione grabbed Harry's arm and yanked him into a standing position. She picked up several items and shoved them into his hands before shooing him off towards a blue screen with white clouds on it that she conjured for him to change behind.
"Honestly, at the time I did. I refused to talk to Severus for most of last year because he convinced them not to give it to me. Now, I'm grateful that he did that. I was young and naïve. I am still young, but not as naïve. When Harry caught me in the bathroom I'd started to realize the awful mistake I made. I knew I couldn't, didn't want, to kill Dumbledore. It breaks my heart knowing the man sacrificed himself to save me from my aunt Bellatrix. It was the best news I had gotten in a long time when I heard Mrs. Weasley killed her."
He was bound and determined to find out what she was doing, even if it meant sitting in a dingy Muggle coffee shop and drinking the most god-awful cup of coffee he had ever tasted in his life. He couldn’t understand how it was so hard to get a simple cup of coffee with cream and sugar in it in the Muggle world. Muggles may have invented some useful things, but they had also invented some useless things as well.
Janice Lacey- Slytherin
"Yeah, I suggested she come here now that the war was over," Hermione made a mental note to tell harry she'd said that. "She's a lot like Harry actually."
Currently, he and Harry were on their way to check on Lucius. He was worried to say the least. His father was clearly depressed. He’d cared more for Narcissa than he’d ever let on. Lucius moped around the house. He didn't step foot outside. He barely ate and the only thing he drank was bottle after bottle of the worst tasting scotch Draco had ever put into his mouth. His mother on the other hand was living the high life with Goyle Sr. The man had taken his mother off to France. She called him once, weeks ago, to tell him he was going to have a new father. Draco had hung up on her after telling her he’d rather have a new mother. She hadn’t called back.
Harry made his way back to the common room half asleep and on auto-pilot. When he arrived at the portrait and said the password nothing happened. The brunette looked up questioningly.
Draco wasn’t convinced his father was fine. After watching him song someone half his age, who also happened to be his son’s best friend. The older man just laughed and ran his hands through his hair. He assured them both, although it didn’t actually reassure either of them, that he was only interested in Harry and not any of Draco’s other friends or any one else that young either.
"I knew It was Harry on the clock tower. I could feel magic and instinctively knew it was Harry. I couldn't lie to the Dark Lord when he asked what I was looking at. It was my fault Harry was exposed. I was a coward!" Draco stood and started pacing. Harry could tell he was starting to have a panic attack and tried to calm Draco down.
"You know why! Every time I’ve let my emotions rule my actions someone gets hurt." Draco growled, head still down.
Glancing at Harry, Severus with drew his wand from his robes, but instead of handing it to the dark wizard he pointed it at him. “NO! I am done pretending to serve you. I will not help you kill Potter!”
"Do you really think it will be kept fair?" Prentiss; if Harry wasn't mistaken; sneered at him. He recognized her as one do the three that had ganged up on him.
"I will tomorrow," Harry lied. "It's really late tonight. I think I should get to my room so I can shower and get to bed."
Sally Birchgrove-Gryffindor
“Can… can you keep everyone away? I don’t really want visitors.”
"How did you betray him?" Harry asked unable to curb his curiosity.
Harry stood at the door listening to the other man. He was starting to regret the decision to insist that he stay and help Draco with his father. He should have listened when his friend told him he could leave. He didn’t really need to be reminded that Draco wanted nothing to do with him in a romantic way. He’d over reacted about everything and said some things he shouldn’t have. He worried he messed their friendship up beyond repair at this point, but then again when he finally got the balls to tell Draco he couldn’t be his best man this coming fall when he and Pansy were supposed to be getting married it probably would kill their friendship anyway.
Draco decided to test 'Jamie's' abilities and sped his broom up. She managed to keep right with him. He suspected she could probably outdo him if she tried. Draco slowed his broom to a stop, so that they were hovering over the center of the pitch like they would in a game. He fished the snitch out of his pocket and woke it up. It started trying to escape even before he opened his hand to release it. The snitch hovered between them for a moment before shooting off to Draco's left. Both of them shot after it.
“Potter, you’re late, detention tonight after dinner. Meet me in the entrance hall.” Harry tried not to show how angry he was about getting a detention while Malfoy came out with nothing as he pulled out is textbook and notebook. He had always preferred using a notebook instead of rolls of parchment in class because is was easier to keep his notes together.
Harry was surprised, usually Snape would just ask if anything in his condition had seemed to change. "I haven't felt different like I'm changing back or anything."
Bellatrix lunging for Lucius' wand brought Harry back to the present. The blonde managed to keep his wand away from her at the same time he wrapped his hand around her own wand. The other Death Eaters that had joined them without Harry noticing were too stunned at the turn of events to do anything other then stare at the fighting wizards. As the two struggled, a green light shot out of the darkness behind. Both wizards collapsed onto the floor in a heap, though Harry wasn’t sure which had been hit or if both of them had been. A cloaked figure stepped out of the darkness and over the prone bodies. Harry stood between his friends and the figure as his scar started to burn.
Harry waited as each name was called. After the first few announcements about where each student would be placed by the Sorting Hat, Harry stopped paying attention. Harry counted around 35 new first years and exchange students. They were all moving around though, so he couldn't be sure.
"Oh, I'm sorry. That must have been awful."
All the students in the common room turned and stared at the entrance portrait. Blaise turned a rather horrid yellow color that clashed with the décor.
"I'm pretty sure I would remember someone as beautiful as you roaming around my castle," Malfoy smiled at him.
“How dare you use that name! You can’t do anything to me!” Lord Voldemort screamed.
Hermione had picked out a knee length skirt with a layer of crinoline underneath to make it puff out. They had charmed the little skulls off and changed the skirt from red to green and black. Harry didn't want any reminder of the Death Eaters or anything that would link him to Gryffindor. His shirt was a simple, black, girls t-shirt with a green rose on the front. Hermione had convinced him to forgo any leggings or tights this time. His hair was done up in a half ponytail. Hermione had charmed his hair into springy curls; the bangs softly surrounding his face to cover the scar. She had also helped him do his make up; shades of green for his eyes and a light pink lip-gloss for his lips. They had discovered early on that foundation just made his skin break out, so he stopped using it. It was a pain to put on anyway.
"Of course." 'Jamie' took it carefully from Draco and smelled it. It smelled like a real flower but it didn't feel like one. 'Jamie' looked at Draco as if asking him what was different about this flower.  "It's…" Draco cleared his throat before continuing. "It's spelled to never die. It's an old pre-courting tradition my father did for my mother. One rose for every outing. Once all twelve have been given the girl decides if she will allow the boy to court her properly or not. My mom still has her eleven red roses and engagement ring that has the twelfth rose from my father. I thought green suited you better." Draco saw something in 'Jamie's' eyes, but it was gone before he could identify it.
Harry was so enthralled in Draco and their discussion he didn't notice the glares from some of the other students who were not happy about the Prince of Slytherin giving the new girl all of his attention. If he had seen them, he may have prepared for the worst.
So here’s hoping there are still people out there that want to read this. It’s been like 2 year, which I didn’t realize. I am sooo sorry. I got writers block because I bit off more than I could chew with this and then real life got in the way. I bought a house, got a new job and a fiancé ;)
(See the end of the chapter for
Everyone started to talk excitedly as they filled their plates. The Slytherin started asking Harry question after question in rapid succession until Draco finally spoke up. "Enough!" He snapped. "Let the poor girl eat and we'll have a meeting in the Common Room after dinner just as we always in theses situations." Harry appreciated Draco's help the rest of dinner went smoothly.
Students started to file out of the Great Hall and he slid further behind the statue. Draco came out and stood smack dab in the centre of the hall, clearly enjoying the attention he was getting from the rumours. When everyone left Harry started to step out from his hiding place but stopped as a tiny Slytherin boy came out of no where and started to speak.
On the first day of their eighth year and return to Hogwarts after the final battle, Draco walked up to Hermione, stuck out his hand and told her that he knew she would never forgive him for all the horrible things he had done and said, but he hoped they could start over and eventually get past it. Harry and Ron stood beside her looking like guppies. He’d been so nervous one of the three of them would hex him, or better yet punch him in the nose again, he’d been sweating buckets and shaking. To his surprise, Hermione took his hand, introduced herself and her friends as if they had never met before in their lives and asked if he wanted to eat lunch together. Ron tried to object, but Hermione just glared at the boy effectively shutting him up.
When he looked back at 'Jamie', Draco got a surprise. The girl was looking at him wide eyed and her cheeks were now a dark rose color. She was beautiful. Her green and black outfit made the green in her eyes stand out. As he approached her, he held out his hand. Draco was relieved when Jamie slid her hand into his. He brought it up to his face and kissed the back of her hand gently. Jamie looked away from him, although not quickly enough to hide the deepening blush. Draco smiled and whispered something as he let go of her hand. When Jamie looked back to him, he was holding out a single green rose to go with the green accents of her outfit.
Harry groaned, “that explains the pounding in my head.”
"Why were you so adamant about not being jealous?" Blaise asked.
“Yeah, what is it?”
Lucius walked up to the group of kids and with a wave of his wand took off his Death Eater mask.
“Well we are the next ones up so let’s see what you have.” Draco waved Jamie towards the stage.
Jamie Alexander- Slytherin
"Thank you, for finally telling me, Harry. Now it's quite late, and after dinner time. Why don't we go get some sandwiches from the kitchen and I'll take you to the Slytherin common room?" Harry nodded and let Hermione help him up. Hermione laughed and Harry looked at her puzzled. "Just thinking that you being turned into a girl hasn't made you any lighter"
"Did you know her before she came here?" Draco leaned against the wall while Hermione fixed the display case.
"Um… Hi. I'm sorry I ran away yesterday. It… Well, that was my first kiss and I didn't want to make you feel like I was taking advantage of you. I'm sorry." The dark-haired girl mumbled, her cheeks turning pink with embarrassment.
"Draco," Harry spoke his name softly. When Draco didn't turn back to him, Harry reached out and touched his arm. "Draco? It's not your fault. They chose to do the things they did. Your father only cared about himself and power. Your mother did what any mother; including my own mother; would have done for their child. Severus choose to protect you the best way he knew how. Blaise said Severus knew Voldemort," Draco cringed at the name, "and if Snape knew he was planning on attacking you then of course he would take the antidote to the poison and step between you and the snake." Draco's shoulders slumped as Harry spoke.
"Hey, it's okay." Malfoy rubbed circles on Harry's arm with his thumb in an attempt to calm him down. It only made Harry feel worse about lying. Malfoy said the password, "Gillyweed," before guiding Harry into the common room.
"No, I think most people try to use you for your fame," she explained. "They put you on a pedestal and are fake in the way they treat you, except for Ron and I. So, Malfoy is the first person to show you kindness not because of who you are, but because it's the right thing to do after he ran into you. I watched you both during the welcoming feast. I've never seen you so relaxed and at ease. I've also never seen him be that nice to anyone."
Harry liked how Draco didn't make fun of the important people in his life, especially when Draco didn't have to be nice about them. He asked Draco if they could go to the candy shop first. He needed some sugary courage to continue with this date. Once he had a bag of chocolate covered gummy bears, they made their way into the Twins' shop.
“NO!” Harry screamed and lunged for it but wasn’t quick enough. Malfoy pulled away and flipped open the cover. On the first page was Draco Malfoy's name but it wasn’t in his handwriting. In fact, it looked like it could have come out of a girl’s book. Draco’s name was surrounded by hearts, stars, flowers, and other little designs. Malfoy stared at it for a moment.
Snape startled Harry out of his musings when he announced Harry's assumed name, Jamie Xavier. The last two weeks of summer, Hermione, the Weasleys, and the order members had agreed to call Harry by his female name. This allowed him to get used to hearing Jamie and practice how to respond accordingly. Harry made his way to the stool and sat down, where Severus placed the hat on his head.
"Yes, actually, a few things. Why didn't you tell me or the Order that Draco was living with you this summer?"
"Okay. I'll do that. Thank you. I think I can manage to go back in there now," Draco assured her. The two of them made their way back to the table.
The next few weeks went smoothly enough. 'Jamie' actually managed to learn Potions with Draco's help. Severus continued to keep his word and did not go easy on any of them, including the Slytherins. Now that the war was over, Draco noticed that Snape treated them all equally. He didn't take points just because he could anymore. Severus even tried to help Neville with extra potions lessons after dinner. Draco didn't think he would ever see the day that Severus Snape and  Neville Longbottom would willingly spent time together, but it had happened. Draco also noticed how friendly 'Jamie' was with all of the students, not just the ones from Slytherin. He was glad 'Jamie' could make friends so easily, but even so, she always seemed lonely and off in thought. The only time she seemed completely at ease was with Hermione.
"George, you can call me George. My better looking brother, Fred, is around here somewhere, but don't tell him I said that," George winked. Harry laughed as he shook the offered hand.
"Yes, I do. The headmaster is Slytherin and seems he was spelled the cup with the help of Professors McGonagall and Flitwick I dare say it will be extremely fair." Harry explained evenly. He didn't know if that was true but assumed such and intricately spelled object would require more than one caster. After a few more questions they called it a night and finally left to do homework or other activities; leaving Harry, Blaise, and Draco alone.
Draco shrugged, but started talking none the less.  "Blaise was very irritating about something. He told me I should just feel and not think about it, but every time I do that someone gets hurt; father, mother, Severus, even Harry."
Lucius finally flipped the boy over and pinned him to the bed. He knew he needed to get Harry to stop and think for a moment. He tried to reason with Harry. Explain to him that not only would he probably regret what he was trying to do, but James wouldn’t be happy. That seemed to break through Harry’s fog, but not in the way Lucius was intending to. Harry shoved the older man off of him and started screaming at him. Harry knew James didn’t have a leg to stand on if he wanted to say something about Harry sleeping with Lucius when his father had been screwing his best friend for the better part of six months.
“At least things can’t get any worse,” Seamus exclaimed rather cheerfully for seven in the morning as he popped up from the the floor on the other side of his bed. Harry jumped.
"You knew I was there?" the kid looked astonished that 'Jamie' New kind of what they were talking about.
“He never did anything to truly hurt you, because I know my son could have killed you had he actually been trying. Draco was only trying to get your attention and the only way any Slytherin can get it is to fight you!” Lucius’ out burst reminded Harry of something Draco had said to him after one of their fights.
Giggling came out of the darkness behind Lucius, “He knows how to play. Itty Bitty Baby, Potter.”
'Jamie' smiled. "I would know your magical signature anywhere Draco. It's why I didn't use my wanted. I knew you would have stopped them before letting them do anything to me. Thank you for calling Professor Snape.
"I may just inform them of that. Thank you for that tidbit of information, Mr. Potter. Now onto other things. Have you felt like you were changing back?"
Harry gaped at the spot Snape had last stood in. Sure, he could appreciate when another guy was attractive, but that didn't make him gay. Draco and he were just going to be friends. He had liked Cho and cared a lot about Ginny. They had just realized they weren't meant to be together. There was nothing else there but friendship when it came to Malfoy. They were both straight. Harry tried to convince himself Snape was just seeing things that weren't there. It didn't completely work.
*******
Draco shrugged and sat on his bed."He and I have never been friends. I ended up on the wrong side of the war because of my father. My pride kept me from going to him and trying to get help. Harry probably thought I was going to send an unforgivable curse at him." Harry gave a start at hearing his first name come from Draco's mouth.
Too shocked to speak, Harry nodded and hurried up to Snape's office as he heard the Headmaster call for Dobby. The boy wanted to get away before the reporter had a chance to look at him properly and figure out who he really was. Snape asked the loyal house elf to escort the reporter off the school grounds before turning and following Harry up to his office.
Only one other first year was placed in Slytherin and that was Blaise's little brother, which made sense. Malfoy was right; no one wanted to be in Slytherin. They were too afraid of the kids that were already in the house and of people thinking that they were going to be the next dark wizard.
"My parents died when I was very small. I lived with relatives that hated magic until recently." Harry hoped Draco didn't notice he hadn't explained about not going to Hogwarts before then. He really didn't want to lie to the boy anymore then he had to.
"Fine, you can stay, but shut up so I can read." Draco nodded and turned onto his side with his back up against Blaise's thigh. Absently Blaise reached down and ran his hand through Draco's blonde locks making Draco visibly relaxing. It wasn't the first time Blaise wondered if Draco was secretly a girl. Blaise thought people would die of shock if they knew 'the Malfoy prat' persona everyone hated was just that, a persona, and Draco was actually really shy and cuddly. Smiling to himself Blaise went back to his book.
Harry walked over to the older man and attempted to pull him into a standing position. He only managed to get Lucius to sit up and the blonde promptly flopped back over. Harry sighed at him. He grabbed the man’s arm and yanked him back up again. After much pulling and pushing on Harry's part, Lucius was finally on the couch. Draco walked back in just as Lucius grabbed Harry by the waist and yanked him down on top of him. Draco scrambled to grab Harry but froze as his father snaked one arm around Harry’s waits, used the other to pull his head down.
“I will never be ready.” He glanced at her. She was holding an envelope. “What’s that?”
"Zip it, Blaise," Malfoy warned. Harry noticed Malfoy absently rubbing his left forearm, even though there was nothing there.
Hermione smiled softly at him. "Because if 'Jamie' likes you then there has to be good in you somewhere. Her relatives are not the best of people so she doesn't trust easily."
"Is that for me?" She asked him.
“Neville Longbottom, is it? How’s Mum and Dad?”
Harry paced in front of the Gryffindor Common Room. He politely asked the Fat Lady to tell Hermione that 'Jamie' was waiting for her in the Hall. When the portrait opened revealing Hermione, Harry rushed at her. He knocked her back through the portrait hole onto the floor, but didn't say a word; he just clung to her, trembling.
Turning Harry saw Draco standing there with a broken tea cup in front of him and tears running down his face. Draco managed to pull himself out of his shock quickly as he took in Harry and Lucius not having shirts on. He grabbed the nearest object and hurled it at his father. It happened to be an iron statue. Lucius managed to dodge it. He couldn’t dodge his son's words though. The same words that caused Harry to suck in a breath and James to give him a small sad smile. The words that informed everyone present that Lucius knew Draco was in love with Harry and had been for years now even before the war had ended.  When the boy realized what he’d just blurted out he turned and ran from the room.
"You better start explaining what's going on!"
"So I don't want either of you hurt when he falls for you and then proceeds to find out who you really are. You need to stop flirting with my godson."
"Liar! I poured my heart out to you. Twice!” Harry wasn’t sure when the second time had been, though was smart enough to keep his mouth shut. “You didn’t have the decency to tell me the truth! You let me go on about how I felt. About how I didn’t expect you to feel the same. Instead of telling me who you were you just let me go on and on! I bet Weasel and the Mudblood were in on it!" The crowd gasped. Draco hit him with another spell and more force than last time. The spell caused Harry to clutch his now bleeding stomach. "Weaselette probably was too, wasn't she?! Hell, apparently even Severus was! My own godfather even lied to me because he knew from the start what was going on." As if on cue Severus appeared at one end of the hallway. Harry sensed him before he saw him and quickly erected a shield to keep the Headmaster from interfering. Snape slammed right into the invisible force and bounced off. If the classmates knew Harry had protected them as well and weren't so scared for their lives they would have laughed at the spectacle.
Blaise rolled his eyes. Although he had a good idea whom Draco was talking about he asked, "She who?"
"Of course he would! Severus doesn't tolerate bullying within Slytherin. He always teaches us to stick together. It's why it was so devastating when the house was split in two over the Dark Lord," Draco explained with regret in his voice.
Once again bewitchedone Beta-ed this disaster. It wouldn't be what it is without her. she is amazing!
Harry was caught in an unexpected kiss. He knew that his brain should be shrieking at him that this was Lucius Malfoy, Draco's dad! However, as his lips were sucked and nibbled on by the skillful mouth of the older blond, all he could do was twine his fingers into Lucius' velvet soft hair and pull his head closer. As Lucius' tongue stroked in and out of his mouth, driving him crazy with the feeling and taste, Harry could only wonder how the man would kiss when he wasn't under the influence of something.
(See the end of the chapter for
"I caught it! I didn't think I would. You almost had it a few times." 'Jamie' handed him the snitch.
"It doesn't matter how long you’ve known someone; if there is a connection then there is nothing you can do. Why do you want to fight it? Why can't you just go with it and not over think why something is the way it is?"
Laverina Montgomery- Ravenclaw
"It was my first kiss, Hermione. I gave away my first kiss to a guy who thinks I'm a girl. Snape warned me not to hurt him and now he’s going to kill me!" Harry panicked.
“Bellatrix Lestrange.”
Harry stood up against the statue in the entrance hall out of sight waiting for dinner to be over and his detention to start. He’d talked Dobby into giving him a sandwich so he wouldn’t have to face everyone again. He hadn’t had a moment’s peace since lunch. Everyone kept coming up to him and asking if he really was gay and did like Malfoy. He’d frightened some Hufflepuff first year girl so badly that she’d fainted and had to be carried to the hospital wing.
“Sir?”
Three hours later Harry was still trying to apologize to his best friend, but was getting nowhere. There was a wall between them, there always had been, and now it just seemed to be growing so they couldn't see over it or hear through it anymore. They sat on the bed in the room used when he stayed at the manor. Harry tried to explain that he hadn’t meant for the kiss to happen. It had happened quicker than he could react. Harry looked at his sock feet and the floor as he talked. He was unable to make eye contact with his friend at the moment. Draco was more concerned about the fact that Harry hadn’t pushed him away, but instead he’d pulled Lucius closer. Harry couldn’t answer him without breaking open a can of worms he didn’t want to deal with at this time, or ever for that matter.
“It’s alright, Madam Pomfrey.” Harry called out, “Nat can come in.” The nurse showed the tiny Slytherin into the closed off area. Nat gasped and ran over to Harry.
Draco didn’t bother answering; he just grabbed the front of Harry’s robes and pulled the raven-haired boy into a passionate kiss.
Owen Caldwell- Hufflepuff
“Shut up. Every time someone has said that today it has gotten worse. Don’t even think it Draco.”
“Harry watch out!” someone screamed as he was shoved out of the way of a falling marble slab. It landed on his rescuer, knocking the person unconscious. Harry looked at him in astonishment. It was Draco Malfoy. That was the last coherent thing that went through his head before a smaller chunk of marble bounced off the side of his head and he fell into darkness.
“We grabbed your bag. Oh, and Snape gave you another detention for leaving class,” Hermione informed him. “At least we don’t have any more classes with Malfoy today, so things can’t get any worse,” she said trying to cheer her best friend up, but Harry wasn’t so sure about that.
"Yes, sorry to keep you waiting." Harry followed Snape up the stone stairs as the headmaster continued talking. "I had to deal with the ministry idiots asking where you had gone off to."
“Now run along.” Draco stood and brushed his knees off. “I have detention soon.” With his back the to statue as Draco watched the boy leave Harry rushed out of his hiding place and opened the door to the clock tower before banging it shut and making the blond jump.
Hermione giggled. "You won't need my help there. Just be yourself."
"You are as straight as I am, Potter," Snape actually rolled his eyes. "But fine. Do not be upset when I say I told you so in a few months time." With that said Severus released the ward and left, but not before he added, "I will not tolerate you hurting him again. Also, I won't go easy on you in potions just because your appearance and house alliance has changed. You may wish to look over the text and homework before class tomorrow."
Draco laughed. It was a watery kind of laugh. More tears ran down his cheeks. He wrapped his arms around Harry’s neck and pulled him in for a hug. Draco buried his head into his neck and held him for a while without saying a word. Harry wrapped his arms around the blonde’s middle. He rubbed his back as Draco’s cries made him start to tremble. Suddenly, Harry realized he wasn’t crying anymore. Draco was giggling. Harry pulled back and looked at Draco’s face. He was smiling. Harry didn’t understand what was going on. The blonde told him. He explained that James and he didn’t have a relationship. Not in the way Harry was assuming. Yes, Draco had tried multiple times to get James to sleep with him but he refused. He made Draco tell him about everything going on instead. They were friends. Nothing more.
Draco just shrugged. "My father made me be seeker. I had no say in the matter. Will you try out for the team?" Draco was hopeful that 'Jamie' would try out so they could spend more time together.
Draco wouldn't listen though. He hit Harry with a stunning spell. Harry flew across the floor and his back slammed into the barrier. "Release the spell Potter!" He screamed ready to hit Harry with another spell. Draco didn't care if he wasn't fighting back. He'd get Potter to release the spell one way or another. He’d kill him if he had to. Why not just show everyone they were right and kill the chosen one. He only just managed to stop the next spell as Snape appeared between them with one of the House-elves. Harry had slipped into unconsciousness at some point.
Draco turned to Blaise and whispered, "I was her first kiss, too."
Hermione found him out in the hallway with a bloody hand and a broken display case in front of him. He was breathing heavily and pacing.
“Well, you could have waited so that I didn’t have to enter alone.” Ron just shrugged and continued to stuff his mouth with eggs and toast.
Harry didn't dare look up at Snape, he probably was so livid he was ready to strangle him. However, when he spoke, he was calmer than Harry had ever heard him.
Draco heard a quiet whistle beside him and turned a questioning eye to Harry. The raven-haired boy shrugged at the look from the blonde and went back to staring at his father's ass. The thought just totally grossed him out. He knew Harry was gay. Harry had told everyone about it by accident one day. Not that any of them hadn’t suspected it beforehand, but someone couldn’t deny they liked men when they decided to make a comment about one of their teachers actually looking hot when they decided to not pretend to be the resident dungeon bat anymore. Draco smirked at the memory, then remembered what Harry had just said before smacking the other boy in the head and telling him to help get his father to sit up while he went to get some potions. Harry’s rather loud outburst at Draco smacking him made Malfoy Sr. come to with a somewhat unsophisticated snort and jerk that made Draco laugh. Lucius spoke, but his words were so slurred the only thing they managed to make out was Draco's name. Draco went to the kitchen, leaving Harry with the intoxicated man.
“No wonder I seem so stiff,” Harry commented absently.
“Then you will die… Avada Kadavra,” Snape collapsed on to the floor. “Accio, Snape's wand! This ends now,” Voldemort sneered. Harry looked up from Lucius to Snape and saw that Snape was lying motionless on the floor, and then snapped his eyes to the older wizard.
“Severus,” Voldemort called out.
“Really?” the boy asked and Draco nodded and smiled. Not a smirk, not a sneer, a true smile that made Harry think he would melt right into a pile of Potter goo.
Draco turned and fled.
"Here," Ron threw a clean shirt and jeans at him. "Those will have to do until you can get Remus to bring your other clothes."
There was a jingle and the shop door opened again. Both Malfoys looked towards the entrance. Narcissa immediately rose and walked to the newcomer. Lucius growled low in his throat as Narcissa pulled Goyle into a very heated kiss. It was clearly not the first they shared. He may not be in love with his wife, but he wouldn’t stand for infidelity. If she wanted to be with someone else, then she should have left him. He knew why she hadn’t though. She wouldn’t get a dime of money if they divorced. They signed a prenuptial agreement. He stood and strode towards the couple.
“Voldemort!” Harry sneered. The man, if you could call it that, pushed his hood off. Harry looked to Hermione on his right and then to Ron on his left before whispering to his friends, “Run… now!" It was the only prompting the other teens needed before stunning one of the Death Eaters blocking their path and doing as their friend commanded. Voldemort turned to stop them from escaping, but Harry was too quick and sent a stunning spell to distract the wizard and allow his friends to escape. Surprisingly enough it worked and Voldemort’s attention was back on Harry and Harry alone. “Are you just going to stand there Tom? It would be easier on my part to kill you!”
Draco seemed lost in thought for a moment before answering. "There are the Hogsmeade weekends, if you had your parent's sign your permission slip. Severus signed mine. Did you remember to have your parents sign it?" Harry groaned. He didn't have any parents to sign it. He hadn't seen his relatives in over a year; once Voldemort had been defeated he didn't need to go back to them, and his godfather was dead. Harry thought maybe Snape would let him have Remus or Mrs Weasley sign it. It was just another thing he would have to ask him next week. Taking Harry's groan and lack of attention as a no, Draco continued. "You could always write to them and have them sign it. You just can't go until it's signed."
"I guess that would be okay. I'm not exactly sure I was going in the right direction, actually." Harry thought that he played the new student role rather well.
"Yes that one! She performs it even better than Harry does!" Blaise doubted that 'Jamie' had performed it that well but didn't mention that to Draco because it would only serve to piss the blonde off.
"Why are you being nice to me? After everything I've said and done, you have every right to hate me now."
Harry's head whipped up. "That was a bit of an extreme reaction on his part, wasn't it?" He just managed to say 'his' part instead if 'my' part.
Harry's head snapped up. No one was supposed to know about that except Severus Snape.
“You dare speak his name, you filthy half-blood?” Bella shrieked, however both Lucius and Harry ignored her.
Draco watched 'Jamie' with Hermione across the Great Hall. 'Jamie' had chosen to have lunch with Hermione today because they were studying for an Advanced Arithmancy test. Draco hadn't taken that class so he couldn't help them and couldn't monopolize 'Jamie's' attention all the time. The blonde aristocrat refused to admit he was jealous of the time the girls spent together; he couldn't be jealous of anyone getting to spend time with someone he barely knew. Trying to convince himself wasn't working, which meant trying to convince Blaise was even worse.
“I don’t have time for your crap Malfoy. I’m sorry I ran into you, but gather your things and shut up,” Harry said, never looking at Malfoy as he shoved his book, quills, and notebook into his bag and continued on down the corridor.
Draco placed his other hand on top of Harry's. Draco could admit, if only to himself, that there was a weird connection between 'Jamie' and himself. Not for the first time, he felt like he knew her; that he was forgetting something important and for the life of him he couldn't figure it out.
"Why?" asked Draco.
Draco nodded again. Harry thought he must feel like a bobble-head figurine, not that Draco would know what one was.
"As you wish… SLYTHERIN!"
"Hey!" Harry exclaimed, but still laughed with her as they made their way to the kitchens.
Despite himself Harry blushed. He blamed it on the new hormones. He blamed lot of things on them lately. No one had ever said he was attractive. Harry wasn't an idiot or blind; Malfoy may be an ass, but he was a gorgeous ass. To have someone that all of the girls; and quite a few of the boys;  swooned over, randomly tell him he was beautiful… Well, it made Harry kind of feel like the schoolgirl he looked like, even if he was straight. Not that Malfoy would have ever said it if he knew Jamie and Harry were the same person. Malfoy would probably tell Harry he was the ugliest girl he's ever seen.
Harry stood glaring up at the griffin statue that clearly didn't care about his dilemma. Severus had changed the password to his office and hadn't told Harry what it was. However, Harry was supposed to be meeting Snape for their weekly lunch and the boy knew the professor would be angry that he was late. Harry had tried to convince the stubborn beast to let him in, but it was to no avail. The statue would not let him pass without the correct password. Harry felt the urge to kick the thing.
“You lie,” Bella screamed, though everyone still ignored her.
"Sure," Blaise spoke as he got up. He'd finished dinner a while ago. Draco nodded and ungentlemanly shoved the roll he had been about to cut into his mouth whole before getting up.
"Everything okay?" 'Jamie' asked. "They said you just up and left."
"Really?!" Harry exclaimed."I thought everyone wanted to be seeker. Why would you give it up?"
“…Malfoy that’s my notebook! Hand it over!” He pointed at the book Draco had just pulled from his own bag.
"Thank you,"  Draco said shyly. "I don't like to deal with emotions."
"You know we did all kinds of tests, both muggle and wizard, and you are still you Harry. Just your outside looks different. It's like you have a Glamour on."
Ron was right, he wasn’t lucky. Draco got paired with Neville instead of with Hermione. Longbottom gave Draco a run for the win, he definitely made the blonde work for it but it just wasn’t enough. Neville stumbled and Draco like a true Slytherin took the opening. Hermione might have been the best of the year but she wasn’t as good as Harry when it came to controlling her magical out put. So Harry waited her out until she was exhausted and then used a Bubble Charm* she couldn’t break out of. He now regretted not just letting her win.
(See the end of the chapter for
Suddenly Draco threw a potion at Harry. It Shattered as it hit an invisible shield in front of Harry’s chest. It covered him in purple liquid that started to smoke. Harry yelled and collapsed to the floor. She knew something was wrong. The potion was to dispel personal shields, like Protego. Harry hadn’t used a shield spell. It was an advanced potion they learned this year. It shouldn’t have reacted that way. Snape stepped up and banished the smoke. Hermione and the rest of the room collectively gasped. Harry now stood in the spot Jamie had occupied. She watched as Harry’s eyes shot to Draco when he realized what was happening. She prayed to Merlin it would be okay, but she knew it wouldn’t be the moment Harry took a step towards Draco.
Just then Ron came barreling down the stairs screaming for Hermione. ”Hermione! Herr-my-oh-nee! All Harry’s stuff just popped into…” he trailed off. Without another word he helped Hermione pick up Harry and guide him over to the couch. They sat him down between them. Harry thought he heard Ron mumble, “I told you he’s curse you.” After that not much was said at all. Harry never spoke. Just cried quietly with the occasional loud sob. His best friends made small talk, hoping to engage Harry in conversation, but nothing worked. Around 2AM Harry finally cried himself to sleep. He started to shiver so Ron covered him up with a blanket as Hermione charmed the fire to burn a little warmer. Ron stayed quiet for a few minutes before finally saying softy, “If I thought Harry wouldn’t be upset if anything happened to that ferret, I would hunt him down and show him just what a pureblood with five older siblings was capable of.”
Surprisingly, Malfoy reached out his hand and offered to help him up before Harry could figure out what he should say."I am so sorry. I should have watched where I was going! I'm Draco Malfoy. You must be one of the exchange students." Harry was so astonished at a nice Malfoy that he took Draco's offered hand and allowed the other boy to haul him up off the ground. "What's your name?" Malfoy asked.
Taking Hermione's suggestion, he decided to tell him the truth. "From Surrey, Little Whinging."
"That was because Draco was being a prat and ducked instead of taking it like a man." Harry managed to say between fits of laughter.
"Please Ron, we all know that already!" Ginny rolled her eyes at her brother who was now sulking. Hermione patted Ron's arm as Harry apologized. Madam Pince came to tell them if they couldn't be quiet then they had to leave so they finally got down to business and did their homework.
"You don't know him!" Harry shook his head and changed tactics. "I didn't come here to fight Ron. It's why I didn't tell you before. Can we please just drop it and move on?"
This is dedicated to all of you who have stuck around from day one with this story and the new ones who are reading. I love you all! Enjoy.
"Oh, yes, go ahead!" Draco answered.
"Aren't we all supposed to be nice to one another?" 'Jamie' asked.
“Language Mr. Potter, another detention.” Snape interrupted but Harry ignored him.
"Okay." Draco looked as if he was going to say more except Blaise cleared his throat to remind the two of them that they were in the Slytherin common room with an audience. It was Draco's turn to blush as he slowly detached his hand from Harry's face. "We should probably work on our potions homework." Draco said before sitting in the couch again and pulling his books and parchment out of hind bag. The other two followed suit.
"Draco! We need to talk!" Harry screamed at the blonde as he walked away through the crowd after Harry had attempted to get his attention quietly. The surrounding students' reaction to the two boys was like the parting of the Red Sea. Draco stood at one end of the hallway with his back to Harry who was at the other end. The onlookers stood to either side of the expanse their backs pressed against the walls as they watched the exchange like a tennis match. They waited to see if a fight would happen. It had been such a long time since they had anything exciting happen. The tension had been building for weeks since everyone found out Harry had posed as 'Jamie'. Draco spun around, didn't take a step closer to Harry when his resolve snapped.
"Why what?" Hermione inquired.
"There is no need, sir. If Hermione approves then I approve. I'll do it," Harry agreed without even glancing at the paper.
"Yes, there was no one in there. Although I didn't know girls could be so messy."
"Yeah, yeah you told me so!" Draco rolled his eyes. "We spent the afternoon outside flying. She could give Potter a run for his galleons. You know that trick he does? The one that everyone ?"
"Father ended up in Azkaban because I wasn't the son he wanted me to be. I couldn't follow his footsteps and do the things he did for the Dark Lord. Mother lost her husband and respect of the entire magical Community just because she did what she was raised to do and obeyed father and protected me. Severus got hurt protecting me from Nagini. And… And Harry… He almost died because…"
“Scared, Malfoy?” Draco quickly put his mask back in place and was about to answer as Snape came up from the dungeons.
Harry woke with a groan as light penetrated his curtains. He didn't miss that part of the Gryffindor tower. He rolled over and flopped his pillow over his head.
“I highly doubt that,” Harry muttered under his breath.
"Can I talk to 'Jamie' in private for a minute though?" Ron asked politely. Draco wondered why Ron would want to talk to 'Jamie'. The girl in question nodded and rose, following Ron far enough away to not be overheard. Draco was tempted to cast a spell on them so he could hear what they were talking about but refrained; with Granger there he wouldn't risk her noticing. He busied himself with his charms book instead.
Harry nodded and looked at his feet. He was an idiot. He was going to get found out if he didn't pay attention to what was going on around him. He knew he'd end up messing something up. He couldn't get away with spacing out all the time.
"No!" Ron simply said. "You can't hide from your problems. You have to face the music at some point."
Euan Abercrombie- Gryffindor
"So you think I'm going to fall for every pretty face that's nice to me?" Harry snapped.
“Harry, mate, we told you, you shouldn’t be doing that in your potions notebook. Someone was bound to notice.”
"Um I thought you said you were going to inform Kingsley of what happened this summer," Harry commented a little confused.
“So, Harry Potter has a crush on me, his arch-nemesis,” Draco smirked as he waved it around so everyone could get a good look at the page. Harry yanked the book from Draco's hand before running from the room. He didn’t stop until he got to the Gryffindor common room. Throwing himself on the couch, he burst into tears. Harry stayed there until Hermione and Ron came back from classes three hours later.
"He's ours; you can't have him!" the second one practically screamed.
Harry decided it was best if they dropped the topic for now. He didn't want to upset Draco more than he already seemed to be. Harry decided to change the subject towards nicer things. "What is there to do around here for fun?" Draco laughed, but was grateful for the change of subject.
"Yes," Draco assured Harry and took the basket from him.
After a while Harry finally caved, "I give. I give!" Both of them were panting hard as Draco helped Harry off the floor where they had ended up during the tickle fight. Harry had an errant strand of hair falling in his face. Draco reached over to brush it away when Harry looked up at the blonde from brushing his robe clean. The former Gryffindor yanked away from the Slytherin afraid the blonde would notice his scar. The makeup covered it well enough, but under closer scrutiny it was still viable. Draco dropped his hand quickly
"It's okay. I'm clothed now." Draco giggled at Harry for being embarrassed about seeing him half naked. "You can look up now."
"She would be what the muggles call a truancy officer," Snape explained. Harry just nodded, he didn't know what else to say. "Before we eat, how have things been going for you?"
"It did, sir."
"I'm sorry," Harry spoke softly. Draco just shrugged. Harry lowered his eyes to the untouched glass of butterbeer he was holding. "I'm a better man then he will ever be. He taught me how not to behave. It was not acting like my father and Harry Potter's testimony that kept me out of Azkaban."
"Okay, put me in Slytherin."
"Hey!" Blaise explained. "What was that for?"
James Tuckett- Hufflepuff
"Could it be that Malfoy being nice to you and helping you,  allowed you to see a better side of him, which caused you to start feeling affection towards him?" Hermione questioned him.
“‘Mione, can you do me a favour?”
"Have a wonderful day in Hogsmeade with Jamie, Malfoy! I'm off to find Ron."
“Don’t be ridiculous. This is my notebook, not yours.”
Needless to say Harry hadn’t told the blonde who he really was. He tried. Multiple times. It always seem to go wrong or wasn’t the right time. The last time he tried was this weekend. Definitely hadn’t gone as planned.
He followed Snape out of the Slytherin common room and down the hallway to the office Snape had used when he was just the Potions Master. Once they were inside the room and a privacy spell was erected, Snape finally spoke.
After reading hem Harry continued talking. "If you don't want to participate in the tournament I will suggest and encourage anyone who wants to paradise with us to do so. As I have said earlier this is to entice students to get to know one another not because of house affiliation but as people and become friends. Practicing with all of us will give us all a chance to improve our skills and knowledge about spells, charms, and potions. Honestly, this club is going to be one large study session from what I have understood from Headmaster Snape and from what I know Hermione will want to do it similar to that anyway.now are their any questions?"
Andrew Colby- Ravenclaw
The rest of dinner all Draco did was talk about 'Jamie'. Blaise noticed the jealous looks the younger girls were giving Draco and knew he'd have to mention it to the other Slytherin boy and 'Jamie' later. He didn't want the new girl to get hurt. Draco saw 'Jamie' and the two Gryffindor girls  make their way towards the Slytherin table. When they got over to the boys 'Jamie' spoke to them.
After the immense amount of stress over the last few weeks, Hermione's question was the last straw. He burst into tears and collapsed in the middle of the cold bathroom floor. Hermione sighed and knelt beside him. She rubbed his back without saying anything, which caused him to pounce on her; knocking them both over;  and sob harder into her shoulder.  Hermione just held him and rubbed his back.
"I've been meaning to ask, where are you from? You don't have an accent as far as I can tell."
They didn’t talk about family much. Jamie‘s were gone before she was old enough to remember or hated her. Draco’s, well one was in prison and the other took her own life. Draco could still remembered the article when it had finally come out and how Jamie had reacted.
"The headmaster is your uncle?" Harry, of course, knew this. He had learned about it after hurting Draco last year. However, 'Jamie' did not. Draco didn't know that Harry knew either, for that matter.
"The one and only." Draco laughed. Turning his head toward 'Jamie' he asked, "You've heard of him?" Harry chose to ignore the slightly jealous tone Draco's voice took.
"Yeah. Sorry. I was just thinking." He shook his head to clear it.
Draco looked up as he heard 'Jamie' laugh and saw her practically jump on him. There was a resounding snap before he got up and walked away without a word. Ginny and the others looked down to find his broken quill. Blaise rose to follow him, but Ginny place a hand on his arm. "Hermione will talk to him. It's okay," Blaise nodded and sat back down.
"Yes! See!" Harry grabbed Draco's hand and placed it on his cheek. "I don't mind if you touch me." Harry realized what he'd done and blushed a dark red in embarrassment and let go of the other boy's hand. Draco smiled and gently rubbed his thumb over the brunette's cheekbone.
"The girls want to finish up our Charms essay in the library and wondered if you both wanted to join us."
“I’ll get you a pain relieving potion and then explain the other damage Mister Malfoy caused. Don’t move on your own.” Harry obeyed her. He didn’t think he had enough strength to get up anyway. When Poppy returned with the vile of potion, Harry downed it right away. “Would you like to sit up?” Poppy inquired. Harry shook his head and then wished he hadn’t.
Draco had checked 'Jamie's' room again before heading to breakfast. He hoped the girl would show up with Hermione, but when Granger and Weasley appeared alone he wasn't sure what to do. Not knowing what else to do and having no appetite, Draco decided to go to the library and research the charm he was supposed to write an essay about.
To cover it up he asked, "Do you mean Harry Potter?"
"Don't even think about lying to me!" she exclaimed, sticking her wand in his face threateningly. Harry swallowed and took a step back from her.
"I shouldn't be, that's why! I've only known the girl for a little over a month!" Draco dropped his head onto his folded arms on the table in front of him barely missing his plate.
Harry pushed past him and headed for the door. Pausing with his hand on the door knob he spoke to Draco one last time without turning around. He told the blonde he had the feeling that they had never really become friends. He said that he felt as if Draco had only ever dealt with him and his preferences because of who he was and the status he got from being “The Chosen One’s” best friend. He finished by saying he should have listened to Ron instead of Hermione and never agreed to be friends with him.
"Guess the hat was right about you belonging in Slytherin," Draco commented. "I was beginning to wonder why it had put you in our house." Harry tossed a pillow at the blonde's head, who ducked so it smacked Blaise in the side of the face instead.
Lucius Malfoy sat in a quaint little coffee shop in Muggle London. The name of it was The Ruff Life. A half dozen small tables sat around the room with two or three chairs at each. He sat with his back to the wall looking out over the room as he watched and waited. Normally he wouldn't go to such a place where lowly Muggles frequented, but today he made an exception. A young Muggle with blue and pink hair entered. She ordered a very complicated sounding coffee and pastry before sitting down across the room.
"Then how do you explain my stupidity that night?"
“Hand me the prophecy, Potter,” he demanded.
"Hurt how?" Harry asked him. He couldn't remember Draco ever hurting him. Draco angered him to the point of dueling almost daily, but he had never really hurt Harry.
“I’ll prove this is mine,” Malfoy said as he made to open it.
A week later Draco rounded a corner in the dungeons to find 'Jamie' trapped with her back against the wall by three sixth year Slytherin girls. Draco knew better than to interfere unless 'Jamie' couldn't defend herself so he waited and listened.
Narcissa entered and sat at one of the tiny booths. She kept glancing at the watch he had given her for her birthday as if she was nervous. Or maybe it was excitement. He couldn’t tell. If he knew one thing, it was that he didn’t know his wife as well as he should. Their marriage had been arranged and neither of them loved each other at first. He loved her now. Although he wasn’t in love with her. He respected her. He was afraid she didn’t have the same feelings for him or had lost them when she found out he was working against Voldemort for so many years. Lucius was sure he knew why she was sitting here, but he needed to confirm it with his own eyes before he did anything about it.
"I don't know how well it would work with him being over seas but I can take it and mail it the muggle way if you write it and put it in an envelope," Hermione offered.
“Harry, stop!” Hermione yelled as Ron and most of the rest of the school egged them on.
“Don’t say it! Don’t ever say that again, Ron!”
Harry reached out and touched the back of Draco's hand. He waited until Draco had looked up at him to speak. "I'm sure he wouldn't have stuck his neck out if he didn't think you were worth saving. I'm sure Harry will be back someday and then you can tell him."
After he was safely back in Slytherin's common room, Harry made his way to Draco's room. Harry knew the other boy would be worried about him not showing for dinner and wanted to assure Draco that he hadn't been kidnapped, which was Draco's latest thought when Harry had needed to visit the Headmaster at lunch earlier in the week. Not really thinking it through, Harry knocked and quickly opened the door, without waiting for an invitation to enter.
Nickolas Weatherby- Hufflepuff
“Great, detention with a Malfoy and the creepy forest,” Harry mumbled as Draco cringed at the thought. The blond would never admit to it, but he still had nightmares after what happened in first year.
"That's because you are trying to get your paws on our prince." The first one spoke again. Draco couldn't believe the tenacity of these girls. He most certainly wasn't their anything.
Harry joined Draco on his bed."Yeah. I was hoping to meet him while I was at school here, but he's not in any of our classes. At least not that I've seen."
"Did he Headmaster really tell you who did the spells on the cup?" Blaise questioned suspiciously.
“What are you talking about Malfoy?”
"Do you know when he is coming back? I really want to talk to him," Draco asked.
“You know that page in my note book, the one that you said I shouldn’t have been doodling on.”
"I'm okay," Draco turned bright red as he continued. "I just miss understood and got jealous. That's all." Blaise's mouth dropped open at Draco's admission.
"Not really," Draco answered truthfully.  "We were never close. She was my mother's crazy sister. That is it." At the mention of his mother, Harry remembered something that was off about Draco saying he now lived with Snape.
Ron and Neville accompanied Harry to the hospital wing because Hermione had Ancient runes. After Madam Pomfrey looked Harry over the three boys hurried to Divinations.
"Alright. Let's have lunch."
Harry leaned on the Griffin statue while he waited for the headmaster and their weekly lunch. Harry had received a note on his breakfast plate from Snape asking to have their meeting today instead of tomorrow, but again Snape had changed his password and hadn't told Harry what he'd change it to. Harry hoped leaning on the Griffin would annoy it into letting him in. It hadn't worked yet. Suddenly he fell backward and hit his head on the stairs. Harry looked up at Snape as he blinked the stars out of his eyes. "Miss Xavier, do get up off the floor. It is undignified for a Slytherin to be lazing about," Snape sneered. "Unless you would like people to think you are a Gryffindor?" Harry narrowed his eyes as he quickly stood up, but didn't take Snape's bait.
Draco smiled to himself Jamie was right. No matter what he had to believe everything was going to be okay. He looked around the room and watched as Hermione and Jamie made their way towards him.
is a wonderful beta.
“Why would I do that? You wouldn’t hesitate to kill me once you got it. You want to see me dead, just like your beloved Voldemort,” Harry spat out at Lucius.
"It must have still hurt knowing she had tried to kill you and was dead though, right?"
"How could anyone be worse then a Malfoy? After all the shit he's put us through; put you through; you are just going to go sleep with him!?" Ron screamed.
"Fine. I'm getting up." Harry got out of bed and groaned again. "All my clothes are in the Slytherin dorm and are girls clothes anyway."
"And you accepted it?" Snape pushed.
“You have no idea what I want, Harry,” Lucius said, deliberately using the boy’s given name, as he pointed his wand at him. He remember several months ago when Draco came home at the end of 4th year.
That was quite a shock for everyone, especially the ones that knew Jamie was really Harry Potter. Severus stared down at Potter in disbelief. He just shrugged and hopped off the stool before making his way over to Slytherin.
were quite thought-provoking. I was worried he would want to put
“Okay, okay!” Harry laughed, allowing himself to be led to the stairs leading to the top. It was a long climb, but they finally made it to the landing where a lifeguard was waiting at the top of the slide.
A show of real true love indeed,
“You don’t mean…”
“One day, Draco decided that he would go looking for Harry. He got up from his nest and set out to find his friend.”
“I will never let you near him again,” Harry spat, and Draco’s world ended.
“You can go down the slide first instead of taking the stairs,” the lifeguard suggested. “That way you can show him the right way to do it too.”
“You do know it’s my job to consult with Aurors on potions related cases, right?” he teased. Scorpius shrugged.
Harry
Harry shook his head, still grinning. “I was the type of student who usually found a single bent, leaking quill in the bottom of his bag about three minutes before the start of the exam. Or I borrowed one from Hermione.”
"Actually, most wizards in England don't know how to drive," Harry said conversationally, sitting down on the right side and feeling rather odd. "Usually only muggles drive."
on the reverse of each photograph, respectively.”
“Open it,” Harry said, gesturing to the fridge. Draco did and immediately shivered.
“Try that hill over there, Papa! No, lower!”
As Potter opened the door and stuck his head out nervously, it suddenly struck him that he was about to look at Potter’s arse. There was a time when young Draco would have been thrilled to see Potter with his bare arse up in a Healer’s office, but humiliating his rival no longer had any appeal. Especially since said rival possessed a rather nice arse. Taking a deep breath, Draco reminded himself that he was a professional and stepped into the room.
"No. You?"
Predictably enough, her mother gasped when she translated his statement, but his father still seemed suspicious.
He took a hearty bite as if to make his point, but Harry wasn’t ready to drop the subject yet.
“Very well. You’ll have to give me all of this man’s contact information. Hassan, was it?”
Harry shook his head urgently. Hassan nodded in agreement. “I do not think they will give you any trouble once everything is explained, but if you still need help, I would be happy to offer my assistance.”
“I guess I’d better get over there and put him to bed,” Draco finally sighed.
“Hi Harry!” Scorpius called, looking up from whatever he was working on.
“Sounds like you’ve been doing some interesting work recently.”
Not one to argue with good food, Scorpius held the door open for him, nodding eagerly. They made their way out into the atrium, and down the street to their favourite Thai restaurant, Teddy complaining about incompetent assistants and egoistic lab supervisors all the way there. Apparently he’d had to fire someone for a careless mistake that had literally blown up in Teddy’s face that morning.
When he stepped out of the floo into Scorpius’ living room a few hours later, Harry once again found that it was empty. Glancing around, he realised not much had changed. He placed the flitterbloom pot he’d purchased on his walk on the coffee table. He’d hoped it would add a little more life to Scorpius’ flat.
“Of course I do, Draco. And honestly, I think I have for a long time. I can’t pinpoint exactly when I broke the habit of wondering what you were up to, but it was pretty early on.”
“Oh, I got this on my trip, for Scorpius. I almost forgot it was in my pocket.” He pulled the colourful kite out and enlarged it, before handing it to Draco, whose smile had grown even wider.
“Um, let me see…”
“Scorpius!” he cried excitedly as the door opened. “What brings you down here?”
I am sure by now that your lawyer has told you the whole story of why Zare picked you at the Gerewhol. You presented to her an opportunity she would not get anywhere else. I understand it was unfair to expect you to actually provide that opportunity to her, so Daneri and I helped her out. Your lawyer may have also told you that Zare and I are now involved with each other, and are quickly falling in love.
“So, does this mean you’re going to start taking me on dates to Hogsmeade?” Harry asked shyly, once again pulling Draco out of his thoughts. “I’ve always thought it was a beautiful village.”
Despite Teddy’s feigned nonchalance, Scorpius could tell that this had been bothering his cousin for a while.
Harry’s eyes brightened.
"Draco. You've been portkeying all over the world for me, to deal with my mistakes. You literally dropped everything to come here right away. The least I could do was watch your son. Anyway, he wasn't a handful, I had fun today."
"I should hope so, you've been using it for over a week now," Harry pointed out, confused.
The server looked like she had a retort for him, but a look of recognition suddenly crossed her face. Harry usually hated being so famous, but he was definitely going to take advantage of it here. He held her gaze as she seemed to be deciding between being rude to the ex-Death Eater or acquiescing to the saviour’s wishes.
“I’m always happy to help, Mr. Taber. Have a lovely day!”
“I don’t think I quite understood what your job actually is when you explained it on Friday. You used a lot of words that I didn’t understand, which I’m guessing are healer vocabulary.”
“I’ll want that spell,” Andromeda said lightly. “If it can get rid of red wine, it can get rid of anything, and you won’t believe the messes Teddy tends to get himself into.”
you understand the nightmare that is seeing your personal life splashed across the
“Where’s the heat?”
“It was an experience,” Draco admitted. “One that I hope never to repeat. But please don’t feel bad that I did it, I was just doing my job.”
“So if I had Transfigured her into the Hippogriff and then back, she would have been perfectly fine?”
Now, before we get started, I’d like to ask for two volunteers from the crowd to help me with the story. These volunteers will need to be adults with no legal restrictions on practicing magic. Do we have any volunteers?”
“Scorp didn’t tell me what happened last night, but—”
“Stop obsessing over Malfoy, mate,” Ron sighed as he plopped a fresh lemonade in front of Harry. It was Harry’s turn to be designated Disapparator, a practice that Ron always insisted on, even though they never really drank enough to impair their ability to use the Floo when it was just the three of them. “Clearly you’re a little lonely if you’re obsessing over your schoolyard crush again. There’s a friendly new Obliviator from Morocco that I could introduce you to if you’re interested—”
He’d been finishing the paperwork to refer his second patient to a Mind Healer and mulling over the facts he had about the case. It was definitely the same culprit, but he couldn’t figure out what the connection was between the two victims. His discussion with the Unspeakable Liaison to the Aurors hadn’t provided any ideas either, but neither of them wanted to sit around waiting for a third attack.
“That’s true, but looking back, he was absolutely right. I should have trusted him, at least when he got a little older. I thought I was protecting him, but…”
“So, how did you two meet?” Ron asked, shooting a warning look at the others. They mostly settled down, but Harry was sure this wasn’t the last of it.
“You can’t tell her you know,” Draco said conspiratorially. He knew it would come out eventually, and that Hermione would kill him when it did, but he couldn’t bring himself to care about that at the moment. The fact that Harry was taking this so well was making him deliriously happy. “But it’s actually she who reviews our work. She’s just bound to secrecy.”
“Sorry to bother you, Healer Malfoy. Mr Potter here was requesting an appointment with you, but it seems I don’t have access to your appointment logs.”
“You know I love you, right?” his dad said. His voice was low, but Scorpius felt the weight of the question.
It was a long drive to get there. While Harry did fall asleep for a lot of it, Hassan did manage to explain to him that this festival was a part of the culture for the Wodabbe Fula people. Harry listened attentively as Hassan explained their history, and how the tribes often migrated based on the changing climate zones around the country.
Beneath a night of summer stars
involved in pretending to date Malfoy. What if Malfoy figured out what his plan was? What if the Unspeakables started targeting him? What if Malfoy wanted more from a relationship than Harry was willing to give him?
Deciding he needed something to do, he grabbed his coat and wandered out of the house, heading toward the busy muggle main street. The thought of Diagon Alley had crossed his mind briefly, but he wasn’t in the mood to be stopped by strangers today. As he wandered down the busy street, peering into shop windows as he went, it occurred to Harry that he should get Scorpius a house-warming present. After all, one’s first flat was a big milestone to celebrate.
“Very well. You’ve made a clear and compelling case. My only question, however, is why this evidence was ignored in the first place. Why did the defendant not argue his case with this information during the first trial?”
“They died,” Harry said bluntly. “When I was one. They were killed in the war.”
"She doesn't. I met her over  the summer while Harry was in America."
Malfoy's cheeks turned pink and he mumbled, "He loved sex and she would refuse to give it to him if he brought any business into the house that she didn't approve of."
Draco paced beside the large, iron gates at the entrance to the grounds. 'Jamie' should have been there already. She was almost half an hour late. Draco was worried she'd stood him up until he looked towards the entrance doors, and saw her coming down the hill with Hermione. Sighing, he went to meet the girls. Draco had hoped it would be just Jamie and himself; however, he could understand if 'Jamie' didn't feel comfortable with being alone with him yet, especially after what happened in his bedroom. There was nothing untoward about them sitting there talking even though he was attracted to her.
"He doesn't deserve to be happy! He's a git! Once a git, always a git!" Ron's sneer would have given Snape a run for his money.
"Goodnight, Jamie." Draco didn't miss the frown on on 'Jamie's' face as the door was pulled shut. Something was amiss; 'Jamie' didn't act like a typical Slytherin, but the Sorting Hat was never wrong so he pushed the thought away. Strangely enough, Draco fell asleep that night wondering why Harry hadn't returned and what the other boy was up to.
"We are supposed to go on another date tomorrow. Draco asked me to go on a picnic for lunch by the lake and go flying with him afterwards." Harry muttered.
Astoria Greengrass- Ravenclaw
Emily Prentiss- Slytherin
He was concerned that his father was becoming slightly suicidal after he found the older man trying, in Draco's opinion, to hang himself from the dining room chandler his mother insisted was necessary to install during the renovations. However, if one were to ask Lucius, he would argue he was only trying to rip the gaudy thing out of the ceiling. Walking up to the entrance, Draco let himself and Harry in and called out. It was probably a pointless action because his father was probably passed out somewhere. Most likely the living room.  When he didn't receive an answer, the blonde walked into the living room. He discovered his assumptions to be right. Not only was his father in the living room but he was passed out. Lucius lay flat on his stomach with his arms and legs spread out wide snoring rather loudly on the floor. Draco knew that his father must have been pissed because that was the only way he would have done something like this where someone other than the house elves could see him. But then again, Draco could be wrong. If he had learned one thing over the course of his life it was that his father didn’t care as much about what people thought of him as he’d grown up believing.
"No! It was good." Harry exclaimed. They stood there in awkward silence for a while before Draco's stomach growled. The noise made Harry smile. "Do you still want to have a picnic?" Harry raised the basket he was holding and waited for Draco to speak, unsure if the other boy would want anything to do with him.
Draco glanced around and not seeing anyone he knelt in front of the boy. Harry smiled slightly. This was why he liked Draco. He’d seen this side of him once before when Umbridge was making everyone do lines. Harry had come across Draco comforting a crying first year Slytherin girl and instantly fell in love.
He could only hope his mother didn't know about those.
"Turn around for me?" Potter asked, kissing just behind Draco's ear. Merlin, he wished he didn't want to.
He couldn't quite place the feeling that bubbled up whenever Potter's lips met his skin, but he knew the sparks of lust his fingers caused well enough.
"That's a wonderful idea."
While his hands worked on Potter's belt, Draco busied himself leaving bites and bruises as far up Potter's neck as he could reach.
“I’ve just been to visit Ginny,” she said cautiously, placing a shopping bag on the spare worktop.
"I don't drink wine," Harry said, trying to see if there was a clear view of a bar. Malfoy handed him a different menu - filled with beers, ciders, and cocktails.
"I dunno."
"What?" Harry asked irritably, yanking the door open. Hermione stood there, chin raised, holding baby Hugo to her chest.
"Harry! Harry come up here!" They heard, faint through the floorboards. Smiling, Harry jerked his head towards the stairs.
"I never expected to see this wand again," she murmured, casting a quick lumos. It burned bright. She smiled.
Potter's eyes fixed on him, unwavering. "No. A lot of people pushed for a lot of changes after the war. There's a team that deals with all the legal stuff, so if anyone refuses to hire you or commits a crime against you because of your condition, you can contact them. The medical team are researching the physical effects on the body, and they work with a group of potion brewers to send out Wolfsbane and any other potions needed."
“Last I saw him, Luna was trying to convince him to take this weird baby necklace thing. It keeps away one thing or another.”
He's in love.
"Okay," she nodded, rolling up her sleeves and fishing her wand from her hair. "Lay down on the sofa, nice and still. I'm going to examine you, okay?"
"Come on," Potter says again, looping an arm around his waist to support him. Draco watches as he swishing his wand at the room, bag and coat flying towards them and onto his shoulder.
"Well, we both went to the muggle world. Not together, we just happened to meet again recently. It's been fun." He explained, quickly slapping a hand over Draco's mouth when he heard him start to say 'we're fucking, Granger'.
"You," Potter murmured in his ear, rolling them so they were on their sides.
"I've always wanted this," he admitted. It had been difficult, fighting with Harry so often when all he wanted to do was make him his promised Alpha. "Always wanted to be yours. France made me realise that."
"Last time I had a proper drink, I fell asleep at a very bad moment." He ignored Draco's snort, tapping him in the side with his foot. "I'm not great with alcohol, and I'd rather not fuck up using the floo when I haven't used one in years."
Draco had wanted some peace and quiet. He’d wanted to go back to that simple time, just after he met Harry, when he could forget all the wrongs.
Draco knew he should be pushing Potter away, but that treacherous little part of him was yearning for the attention.
"He's even managed to get it on the ceiling," Draco murmured, head tilted to see the distinct green spot amid the cream ceiling.
Draco pushed him onto the floor, laying him out nice and pretty on his back.
The realisation is startling, forcing the air out of his lungs in one fell swoop.
Potter was at the breakfast table, a piece of toast on his plate, drinking tea out of Draco's favourite mug.
"Yes," Draco bites out, straightening his back. Potter dips his head to Draco's neck, placing a faint kiss there, before kneeling and placing another kiss to his belly button.
"I suppose they're the ones sending me potions? How do you know they're not poisoning me?"
"Potter," his voice shook as he raised his head to meet Potter's gaze. "How do you feel about fucking my face?"
"Okay. I'll see both of you next month."
“I don’t want you to leave me.”
"Yes," he moaned, arching back as Potter kisses him through his trousers.
“I don’t want to wait,” Draco decides, gripping Harry’s biceps. “But everyone’s making it this big thing, and I don’t know if I want that.”
Potter struck gold, hitting that perfect spot so hard Draco went toppling over the edge in a heartbeat.
"If you don't mind," he offered out his coat, grabbing his phone from it first.
"Highly inappropriate reason to hire someone, I should think." But he was preening at the attention, pressing himself into Harry's body. "Besides, I'd rather we take this somewhere other than the workshop. I imagine a bed might be nice."
"Malfoy's here?" Hermione asked, pushing past Harry and stepping into the office.
Of course its Malfoy. It's always Malfoy.
"I am having a good evening," Harry runs his face into Draco's neck, breathing him in.
"No, that's not the exciting part." The medical witch continued, rushing to the other side of Draco's work station. More brewers moved in beside him, crowding his station to hear the news. "We think it could make it possible for male births."
"Fucker," Harry murmurs as Draco leaves the room, sliding his hand into his underwear.
"He's... nice?" Ron asked, clearly not understanding. The girl holding his hand quickly broke away, running to sit in front of Draco. "Rose... Rose, no, don't sit with Malfoy."
Apparently, his mother hadn't gotten the message to leave him in peace.
The date was on. A tall, handsome blond was going to pick him up from work on Wednesday - precisely six-fifteen, Jenna had assured - and he wanted to make a good impression.
"Yes, not far from Wembley. Moved there a few years ago."
And a rather filthy magazine, from which he ordered several large, curving dildos.
Merlin's saggy tits, his bite hurt. Every inch of him ached, pain curling in the pit of his stomach.
"And have a baby throw mushy peas all over the kitchen," Draco added.
Its Friday, he's five minutes late, and the girls are sitting in the ball pit expectantly.
He'd spent an unusual amount of time reading magazines and books all about this - about getting off in every conceivable way - and getting his mouth fucked had sent Draco down a rabbit hole of exploration and masturbation.
An arm tightens over his waist, tucking him back into solid muscles and a hard cock.
Just the thought of having Potter above him was enough to make Draco's knees go weak.
Harry laughed. Malfoy had to be teasing him.
"Not impossible," Draco intercepts. He knows this. His father told him stories when he was younger. "It's been nearly 500 years since the last wizard birthed a child, but it is possible. Back in the times when our numbers were just a few thousand, every birth was crucial. Powerful wizards - pureblood wizards - could have a child if their magic was strong enough to sustain a second life."
That makes me feel so much better, Draco thought, hoping Potter could sense his sarcasm.
“Lunch is for eating.”
Only he had full control of that dildo. He didn't have control over Potter.
Draco didn't want to work for Potter, but he had few other options.
“Of course you have. We wouldn’t be living together if you hadn’t learned that lesson.”
"Stop," Harry held a hand up, surprised when Teddy actually stopped in front of him. "Ted, you're making me look bad. I've gone to all this effort," he waved a hand at the first pair of jeans and jumper he'd seen, "and you're going the easy route with no clothes? Come on, I haven't seen anyone here in years, and you're already making me look bad."
Draco woke three days later, grateful for the warm, solid pillow beneath him.
Draco was watching him - he could feel it. He was having a lazy day, and that meant he wasn't wearing any of the new, stupidly tight jeans he'd impulse-purchased before his date with Draco.
Draco Bloody Fucking Malfoy.
“You mean Holyhead Healer? There’s some spare jars back here.”
Hermione's eyes were darting between the two, brows furrowed.
"I can do you against the table if you'd prefer, but I was thinking you could lie down all nice and pretty while I fuck you senseless."
Bloody Potter.
"Impressive."
Harry looked down, seeing green mush smeared across the table and floor.
"Watch it!" Was Draco's response, clutching Scorpius closer to his chest.
"Fell asleep."
"Oh, sorry. We don't really have any places open-" She glanced at Harry, studying his features. "But for the sake of improving Potter's sense of fashion, we can squeeze her in."
"The conversation a few weeks ago - male pregnancy - it got me thinking. I'm - well, I'm a candidate. We can see if it's possible with me. I'm pureblood, I have lycanthropy, and I've not long passed my third year."
The mark had faded to nothing more than a scar, but Draco could still see it. Trace the outline of it with his fingers. Feel the little dips where Fenrir Greyback's teeth had ripped into him.
Harry turned to see Teddy wearing a jumper he could have sworn he'd lost last year. He's only managed to get one arm in, the other rucked up around his neck, still very naked underneath. He had two pairs of trousers in his hands, dragging them behind him
Harry scrubbed a hand against his face. This wasn't how he planned for his Saturday afternoon to start.
"Harry, you seemed awfully familiar with Malfoy at the party last week. More than if you'd only met him a handful of times." She held a hand out for the mug Harry handed her, pausing to take a sip. "I saw the way you were looking at him."
The mark meant marriage. It meant he would be married to Harry as soon as possible.
The Weasleys had all gradually spoken to him, dragging him into bone-crushing hugs and asked him countless questions about how he was doing. They'd questioned his proximity to Draco, who had moved to sit on the floor between his feet, playing wizards chess with the children and - after watching his daughter being taught a superior tactic - a very upset Ron. It had been easy to answer their question - good, very good, he's a friend, stop teasing him just because he's not as good as you.
"I thought you said you were going to shave it all off?" Draco asked, leaning forwards on Harry's desk to peer at the girl. "You said having hair was too much of a drama."
"Harry! I need help!"
Andromeda frowned at him, shaking her head slightly. "They were awful. When I was putting Remus and Tonks into the memorial editions, they tried labelling him 'Remus Lupin, the werewolf'. Very small-minded."
A knock at the front doors jolted him out of his daydream, head snapping to the door of the sitting room.
"Since when did Potter ever know a thing about style?" Harry closed his eyes, trying to block out the sound.
Harry leaned back in his chair, feet on the desk, hands behind his head. He supposed it was going to be a fun evening. Even if the date went horribly, he could probably talk the man into a quickie.
"Morning, Hermione." It still sounded weird. "I was just being a wonderful person, bringing this idiot a lovely, cold coffee."
"If you don't get laid-"
And what had he said? It's because of what they'd done.
"It's probably nothing. Just leave me be."
“I know. But I also know you don’t like talking about it.” He’d pulled down the medicine box, rifling through it.
Potter had taken him by the elbow, steering him through the crowd. He'd nodded at the people on the desk, not bothering to stop as they walked straight past. Veering him through the corridors, past the elevators, deep into the heart of the Ministry.
"Can I suck you?" Potter asked, growling out the words.
Looking over, he saw the smile spreading on Harry's face.
Hermione nodded, taking another sip of tea.
"Merlin knows," Andromeda sighed, watching as Draco forced the boy away. "Teddy, we agreed you were getting dressed."
"How about we go check on Ron?" Harry asks Hermione, grinning when Draco scowls at him. He quickly grabs Hermione by the arm and escapes while Maria starts running her hands through Draco's hair.
"What if, and I know this isn't the case, but what if Ron turned around and became some super dark wizard. You were afraid to leave him because he'd hunt you down, or you'd lose Rose and Hugo. You couldn't argue against his views. All you could do was go along with it and everything you could to protect your kids. Wouldn't you want someone to take it easy on them, and not treat them like shit just because their dad was evil?"
He'd purposefully dressed in the second most provocative thing he owned. A first date hardly seemed like the time to wear his new leather trousers, and he was suddenly glad he'd recognised that fact.
"We'll get her a snack in a little bit," Harry assured, grabbing Ron's arm before he could move for the girl. "We do snacks at ten. She'll get used to the schedule."
She had said the word somewhere among a great torrent of words, initiated by the tip of her wand glowing a dull grey over Draco's abdomen.
He tried to speak, to tell him there was no part of him that wanted anything other than to be his, but he couldn't. Because Harry was sat there in all his glory, staring down at him, and for the first time in his life he wanted nothing but to submit.
"Right," she said, clutching her papers a little tighter. "I'll see you later, Harry."
“Why would you think I could leave you?” Harry asked, pulling Draco into a tight hug. “Is this about-?”
Harry laughed, wondering if Draco would forgive him if he didn't save him. He wasn't sure, but he knew it would be ugly, painful, and definitely wouldn't follow his master plan of getting Malfoy in his bed. Or maybe he should scale that plan back to just getting him on a second date. A second date that ends in the bedroom.
“Potter, get off me or I swear I will throw this potion over your head.”
She stepped into the room, signalling for the Auror to sit on the sofa opposite Draco.
"No, silly! We're looking for Harry's favourite jumper."
He smelt much the same as last time - holly wood and lemons. And sex.
"Says the man drinking a caramel popcorn monstrosity."
He didn't know what he was doing, but by Merlin he wanted it.
"I love what you've done with the place, Potter," Malfoy said, eyes scouring the wall of children's drawings. "You're a fantastic artist."
"Come on," Potter insisted, heading towards the floo.
"I think you need more staff," Maria said as she moved past, a line of children following her. "Everyone to the tables for sandwich time!"
"Can't we?" Harry asked, and Merlin the look in his eye right then. If they had been alone - if Draco hadn't been stupid enough to get pregnant - he would have been on his knees for the Alpha in front of him.
"Jen's sherbert." She answered, ducking beneath the balls when one sailed too close to her head.
"My sister works with someone your type," Jenna continues, finally choosing a sherbet dip lolly. "Tall, blond, fit as hell. Once, when they went out for drinks, he said he likes a man on the broader side, who doesn't mind being fucked into a mattress."
The place looked beautiful. Chandeliers burned overhead, casting the restaurant in a warm glow. Every table was for two, with a candle in the middle, a rose laid with the cutlery, and starry-eyed lovers talking and laughing together.
Who the hell knew how to find him?
"Yes."
"Here you go," the waitress said, placing two plates in front of them. Tiramisu for Draco, chocolate and caramel lava cake for Harry. "Any more drinks?"
"Draco," Harry whined.
A scream tore up Draco's throat just as he was taking a deep, levity-fuelled breath.
Draco shivered at the thought, carefully lowering himself onto his back. He could feel Potter's eyes on him as his head dropped over the other end of the table. Predatory.
"Keep screaming for me."
"Dear, how about you have something to eat and go get dressed? I hardly think that an appropriate outfit for having guests over."
It was driving him mad.
"Well," Harry sat in an armchair opposite them, "my boss is sisters with his boss, and it sort of went from there."
"First, you'll have to be lucky enough to find a gay male wizard inflicted with lycanthropy in an active sexual relationship, where both wizards are powerful enough to make pregnancy possible."
But the slick was still pouring out of him, leaving him feeling horribly empty, and something inside him knew toys wouldn't be enough to sate the feeling.
Harry did his best to copy Malfoy's action; raising a single eyebrow. He was certain he was doing it wrong, but Malfoy didn't seem to care.
"Jo, I don't think I tell you enough, but I love you."
It was a fun task, taking up long days and nights, letting him ignore the way his stomach swelled.
"He was definitely a little shit, but when that's the way you've been brought up, you don't know any better."
"How long have you been speaking to Malfoy."
Slowly, hands still grasping the work table, Draco obeyed.
Draco stepped forwards, feeling Harry's erection against his stomach.
He stands, silently walking out towards the entrance hall.
Now he was 24, a single father and aspiring businessman.
"You need to lie down for me."
Oh, that certainly sounds appealing.
It'd been a week.
He waited as his mother went to the doors, heels clicking on freshly polished floors.
"Ron, we help them learn colours and counting with games, read to them before nap time, and the older ones have started doing math."
Draco had growled, low and deep in his throat, pulling Potter to him by his robes and ripping them in an attempt to get to his belt.
"What about men?" Jo asks, strutting into the office with a large cardboard box.
Draco could feel it - feel some tiny part of him clenched around the head of Potter's cock, holding him there.
Harry turned towards the window, wondering if he was even remotely ready for this. It was probably a stupid decision. It had been Jenna's idea, after all.
"And you work in a muggle book shop?"
“So let’s skip it. Just us and the kids, that’s all we need.
"Granger," he greeted, nodding. He knew she may not like him, but if he got a job in the potions lab, he might very well be on neutral terms with her.
This was originally going to be a one-shot, but a request from someone on Wattpad convinced me to make a second part.
In Harry's mind, he pictured what Malfoy had actually been planning. Having a few drinks, flirting, possibly already making enquiries about taking the other man home. Home.
As you have probably noticed, the world has gone to shit. At this point I wouldn't be surprised if zombies sprung up and took over.
"Told you he'd show up and the first thing they'd do is yell at him." Harry heard him say to Charlie, who had hung back to watch the women fuss.
The ice cream, as it had to be, was the perfect mix of frozen and melted gloop. He’d learned that lesson somewhere amidst the Great War of the Frozen Desserts. Ron had never let him live it down.
He really had to be going round the twist.
"You better- fuck! Potter, you better not be thinking of doing that while I'm-"
Harry had flunked his interview but somehow ended up with a job at the daycare.
"There should be something there you'll like. If in doubt, their whiskey is rather good."
"We've never taken Rose on a picnic," Hermione murmured, looking down at Hugo. "Perhaps we could meet you?"
"Then I'll hex you."
Draco nodded, hoisting Scorpius further up his hip when his eye caught sight of a small boy behind the counter.
"Hard to believe, isn't it?" Malfoy's smiling, but it doesn't reach his eyes. "Father cut me off just before he went to Azkaban. Mother gave me enough for a few months rent, but I needed to find something. They wouldn't hire me."
"I didn't realise you had a key, Malfoy," Hermione says, eyeing up the bag in his hand.
"Cold coffee? Intentionally cold coffee? Potter, you are absolutely disgusting." Draco wrinkled his nose, bringing his own drink to his lips.
Humming, Draco managed to keep his face perfectly neutral as he took his food from Harry. Wandering back to the living room, he did his best to appear nonchalant.
"Draco," Harry started, watching the blond move to open the box in his hand. "Give it to me."
The wizarding world wasn't nearly as close to accepting people like the muggle world was. Not to mention he didn't have anyone writing newspaper articles about his love life anymore.
"Yeah," Potter beamed, finally leading Draco around the edge of the room towards the lab. "We wanted a way to protect people. I mean, it's not anyone's fault they're bitten. It happens, and then they get their entire life turned upside down because nobody will hire them, people won't rent them housing, and the old laws basically labelled them criminals because of their condition. We changed that. Now it's illegal to deny housing or employment because of lycanthropy, it's illegal to ask someone if they have lycanthropy when hiring them, and gives anyone with lycanthropy access to Ministry brewed potions."
Harry seemed to melt - collapsing down until their mouths met, hands cupping his face with care.
Merlin, it'd been a week.
His cheeks heated when Teddy threw a small black box across the floor, skidding into Draco's foot.
"Don't worry, I'll go back and save him later."
"You're mine," Potter confirmed, drawing back until he was standing, hands cupping his arse so he could lift him into the perfect place.
“Draco?” He asked, moving up behind him and taking hold of his wrist, examining the cut. It wasn’t deep, but it was bleeding heavily. “Let me get a bandage. What the fuck were you doing to not see your own hand?”
"I know someone. Give me some time-"
"Well, I'm sorry too. I was really drunk. Whiskey does that to me."
He refuses to accept that maybe - just maybe - Potter had managed to get him pregnant. The first wizarding pregnancy in 500 years and the poor bastard has to have Potter for a parent.
"Andromeda," Draco whispers, staring at the boy. "Mother said she was disowned. Never said why."
Everything is Potter.
"Its a collar."
“You seem to forget I made it clear I would take my time.”
"Potter, apparently the child has decided to wait for lunch. At eight thirty in the morning."
The young witch was nodding vigorous, ponytail of blonde hair bouncing on her head.
“Yeah.”
Tight jeans - not the new ones, these were a pair Jenna had forced him into on an impromptu shopping trip, telling him his arse looked amazing in them - the button down he'd bought Saturday, and he'd even gotten his hair under control.
Draco was a tease, and he bloody well knew it.
Drops of laughter rose out of the huddled group. Draco tuned them out as he diced ingredients, vaguely aware of the conversation of implications.
Hermione took another sip of her tea, eyes unfocused as she ran it through her mind.
"This is your condition, right? I remember Remus having a reaction like this after one of his changes. Come on," he's pulling at Draco's shoulders again, "I'd rather get you to one of our safe houses than risk something here."
"I don't know, but you're not allowed to panic, because then I'll panic. It went away every time the last few days, so it'll go away again today."
“Piss off,” he said, even as he doused the fires and leaned into Harry’s touch. Harry’s mouth was on him, fluttering down his neck, ghosting over the back of his shirt.
Stood on trial and told everyone what had happened - what they'd been made to do. His mother had offered up memories of meetings, of begging for her son to be spared the torture of joining.
That was the word the witch had used - imminent.
He out Teddy on his feet, watching him run off towards the stairs.
Her grin was wicked - painted red this morning - and if looks could kill, she was already dressed in blood.
Best not to fret. There was no guarantee they'd even get on.
"Ron, she's eating sandwiches. Jo's going to hand out fruit in a minute, then there'll be jelly. She's fine."
"Ignore him, he's already had at least a bottle of wine."
Draco couldn't help the grin on his face when Harry's Alpha friends saw them together. They looked as if they wanted to say something, argue. But Harry wouldn't let them. He wrapped an arm around Draco's waist and refused to let go until they left.
"Yeah, since the trials ended. It was only meant to be a few months, just a break, but I ended up staying."
Smooth skin went on for miles, the only mark from where they had cut him open to take Scorpius out. But even that scar was smooth and shining, a promise of what was possible with this man.
"I did it! Look, I'm wearing a jumper like Harry!"
“I want to get married,” Draco assured, head tucked to his chest. “It’s just-“
"And Draco was just... eating?" Draco tries to ignore his mother pushing the plate of biscuits towards him. Just to prove a point he snatches up a custard cream, stuffing it into his mouth.
Harry loved Jenna, he really did, but she came up with some absolutely shitty ideas.
He was fortunate to find Neville, a fellow Omega, also worked for Harry. He grew all of the potion ingredients in a greenhouse behind the store. Each area had a regulated biome, specific to the plants growing there.
Just like that Harry's horrific date was forgotten, melting away to new conversations.
True to his word, Draco had an owl arrive the next morning.
His next trip into work begins in the medical room, reclined in a chair with a witch fussing over him. He's thankful she's put up privacy screens around him, blocking out the sights and noise of the rest of the world going on with their normal lives.
"So, how did it go?" Jenna asks the second he walks through the door.
"No, no he only does that on a full moon. This is more like the wolf taking over his mind, and fulfilling it's basic needs if they're not being met. One girl - she's quite sweet actually - is anorexic. When it takes over, it just eats loads. Takes over for a whole week and just eats everything her body needs."
"Yeah, unbelievable." Harry was grinning. Ron was trying to follow Rose with his eyes while Jenna talked to him. Rose, who was wearing a bright blue dress, hair tied back with a matching headband, and trying to piggy-back ride another girl up the climbing wall.
He stood, storming towards the staircase.
Draco sat back, sighing. The itching was getting worse, but Draco ignored it.
The first person Harry saw was a very harried Ron, carrying a baby in one arm and holding the hand of a small child with the other. He was stooped awkwardly to reach her, fussing the baby, but it was definitely Ron.
"Safe-"
"Jenna, I swear, if you're here to just cause trouble-"
Perfectly white shirt, tucked into sinfully tight black slacks, covered in a dark grey waistcoat, long black overcoat carefully folded over one arm. Harry could swear he nearly started salivating when he turned to footsteps on the stairs, seeing just how perky and round his arse was.
"Not to mention your friends have found a way to blow up the potions." Draco muttered, unprepared for the roar of laughter behind him.
“Hermione, to what do I owe the pleasure?”
"Just in here for the two of you," te waitress said, placing menus in a small booth. "Would you like me to take your coats?"
"Oh," the young witch sighed, looking down at her sheaf of parchment. "I suppose the odds are quite unlikely."
No reply came, but the wards shifted, and Draco knew someone had just entered the front garden.
Because of course he was still in London, and of course, he'd defied everyone's expectations and opened a fucking potions shop, and of course, there was a sign on the door signalling a need for a brewer.
When he gets to the back exit, Malfoy's by his side, ready to leave. Setting the security, walking out and locking the door, it suddenly sets in.
Draco shot an exasperated look over his shoulder to Harry, who grinned as Teddy dragged him upstairs, still chattering.
"You bastard! You think I would- I could? Fuck!"
He looked down at himself, checking his pyjama pants and T-shirt were somewhat decent, before opening the door wider.
"You and me both." One day. He'd hoped he could get through this one day before taking his week. But here was Harry, in one of those ridiculously tight-fitting shirts that showed off everything he had to offer.
And suddenly Draco couldn't breathe because there was Potter. Potter, with his tight-fitting shirt, closely shaven beard and deep, green eyes staring at him.
“Your mother’s place, actually. They insisted.”
Draco's mouth moved against his own, slow and sweet. Draco's hands stayed on Harry's collar, thumbs rubbing in slow circles over the leather. Harry pushed forward, giving Draco's bottom lip a quick lick, grinning into the kiss when Draco returned the motion. Biting and licking at Harry's lips, tongue pushing inside, Draco moaned into Harry's mouth.
(See the end of the chapter for
"You paid for the whole thing?"
"Since when could you juggle?"
“Alright.”
"Come in," he said, waving Malfoy in. The man was dressed in much more casual clothes this time - jeans and a cashmere jumper, pale grey to match his eyes.
"You're living in the muggle world?" Narcissa asked, eyes widening.
“You know why,” he said pointedly, ignoring that treacherous part of him begging for Harry’s touch and pushing the Alpha away. “And I want lunch. I’ll be back in thirty.”
"Well, do you remember all the things he did? The way he treated us at school? He nearly got you killed."
Jo simply smiled at Maria, turning the box upside down and pouring her secret stash all over Harry's desk.
It was... horrendous. Absolutely, truly horrendous. She was wearing a bright yellow sundress, dark purple tights, a neon pink cardigan and-
He let his head fall back off the table, throat stretching as he moved Potter's hips - Potter's cock - towards his mouth.
Harry let himself be pulled into a hug before Andromeda instructed him to sit. She sat on a long, sleek sofa, indicating beside herself. Harry hovered next to an armchair instead.
"The fifth sounds wonderful. If you floo in at two, I'll meet you at the floo bays."
What would the blond look like? Would he take Harry home? Fuck him till he passed out? He hoped so.
He can't let go of his hate, no matter how hard the love is pushing into his soul.
The boy finally looked away from the pan, eyes landing on Draco. A squeal erupted as he ran forwards, hair shifting through several shades of blond before it landed on the exact platinum of Draco's.
A small note from a witch stating he'd been recommended for their potions team, and asking if he'd mind receiving a floo call to check his experience.
"What are you doing here?" He spits, glaring at Potter. Potter, who was just as big and bold as always, wearing large purple hickeys just above the collar of his robes.
“We’ll see,” Draco replied, getting up and making his way to the kitchen. “Cup of tea?”
"Yeah, we'll let you know."
"I do wish you hadn't just left. I know we never spoke much before, but Teddy misses you when he isn't there."
"Ted, you want to show off your colours?"
Now it was all on him. The four of them were normally really good at not asking Harry about his life, but the storm seemed to have changed their mind.
"Since I was six. Dad taught me."
"Fuck," he murmurs, sending a silent prayer for this moment to never end.
"Shall we?" Draco asks indicating the door.
A hostess came forward, speaking to Malfoy in hushed voices before they were being led through the restaurant.
He walked out of the floo to utter chaos.
"Well, we've decided to offer a gesture of goodwill. After everything you did, I wanted to give these back to you." Potter reached into a pocket of his robes, pulling two wands out, and placing them on the coffee table between them. "I know it's not much, but I've cleared it that you can use your wands from now on. We will be monitoring the use, but when we take the wards off the grounds, we'll do the same for your wands."
Harry put his hands in his pockets, shuffling his feet.
Draco yelped, nails digging into Potter's shoulders as he was pulled closer. Potter descended to sniff at the crook of his neck, trailing soft kissed up to his ear.
"Draco, look at me, please. What's wrong?"
"What do you want? I have my tea and everything, look." Draco waved a hand towards the corner in the table, piled high with sandwiches and ginger tea.
"I'm not sure I can make the third. How about the fifth?"
"Sophie, stop pitying him. What did you do wrong? The man looked like he wanted to jump you in our office, so it obviously wasn't anything he did."
"If you calm down and let me eat my tiramisu, I'll have you for dessert, okay?"
"What are you doing here, Ron?" Harry asked, trying to stand up straight. A fourth child flung themselves onto his back, weighing him down.
They were itching worse than normal - a stubborn, constant itch just beneath the surface of his skin.
"Red."
"Yeah, he means well, but we think he's cursed at this point. Never did have much luck with potions. Or any subject, really."
She came over in a heartbeat, carrying a bag of medical supplies, asking what was wrong.
Draco stilled as he felt Potter's hands on the swell of his stomach, anger coursing through his veins and spilling from his eyes.
"It... it usually makes the person you're seeing feel appreciated."
"It's pink."
"Found it!" He announced, pulling out a giant, fluffy jumper.
Potter hummed again, hands slipping under his loose T-shirt to rest on the swell of his stomach.
Draco could kill Potter. It's typical that he'd try and force him into leaving his home. And he's doing it in a way he won't be able to resist - by making his mother ask.
Holy fuck.
"Fancy seeing you here, Potter."
"If everyone eats their sandwiches, it will be jelly time!" Jo shouted, grinning as the kids stormed towards the dining area.
"Yes," she'd answered, nodding through the flames. "You can come to the Ministry and see what we do. It should let you see if this is a place you would want to work, and we can test you a little more to know if we want to offer you a job. How does the third sound?"
Like now, when all the staff are huddled in the office, brewing coffee, watching lightning in the distance.
"You look like my grandmother's family, you do! She has this massive photo book," Teddy stretches his arms out, overestimating the size, "and loads of people in it have hair like yours!"
She nodded, lips in a tight line, staring at him.
Potter was grinning at him, moving him so his arse was barely on the table.
"This is really lovely jam," Potter said, using a spoon to scoop more of it onto his toast.
"Potter's been moody ever since he got drunk and broke it off with that bloke on the third floor." One girl had said, giggling over the idea. "Can you imagine being dumped by Potter?"
The wizarding world.
When they were naked and panting Harry just looked at him, holding himself back long enough to appreciate the man beneath him.
The figure didn't speak, instead, it was treading carefully as it walked around Draco's back to look at the potions.
At least he had the sense to look anything other than smug.
"Hi." He pulled a hand from his pockets, waving slightly.
"Harry," a voice came from amid the desks. Draco watched as Granger pushed her way through, clutching a stack of papers. "We've just had a report of an attack on a known lycanthropy safe-house. Are you free?"
"Come on, I know it's in here somewhere!" Teddy insists, throwing items out of the bottom of Harry's closet. Draco watches from his place on the bed, trying to figure out what the boy is looking for.
Determined not to work himself up with no time to let out any pent up energy, Harry forced his mind on something else.
"No, just a very discreet muggle place."
Harry grabs the keys and his coat, about to head to the door. Throwing caution to the wind, Harry drops down to his knees, bending over just right to push his footstool far under the desk.
"I- I fell asleep."
Harry loved Jenna, he really did. And if she managed to get him laid? Well, he'd buy her all the sherbet she could ask for.
"I'm surprised you came, if I'm honest," Andromeda confided, not clarifying if she meant her sister or Harry. "Both of you, one in France, one in the muggle world. You don't even keep your floo open."
"I'd need to find a sitter, for Scorpius." He bounced the small child, who'd remained strangely quiet. "But once I do that I could start straight away."
“Where have you left the demons? Did you forget them when picking up dinner?”
Potter moved forward, cock slipping straight into Draco, leaning over him until lips and teeth met flesh.
"It's brilliant! Not as big as Harry's wall, but it's big. It's nearly full already, but Grandma won't let me put my drawings on another wall. It's really unfair-"
"Draco?"
"He refused to kill Dumbledore, he refused to give me up to his dad, and he was forced into pretty much everything he did." Harry forced a hand through his hair, wondering why people hadn't seen that. "He was a scared kid who was doing what he could to survive. Dumbledore never exactly tried to help him get out, so the only choices he had were to go dark or die. What would you have done? What if you'd known that if you chose death, you might be choosing it for your parents, too? He went through so much, and he paid for it. He lost everything, even his family. I can forgive what he did because he can forgive the things we did to him."
“I spent years trying to move on, trying to accept that you were gone. So to suddenly find out that you were back, to find out that you’d been threatened, and that you were ill… it was a lot. I was angry, and confused, and worried about how things were going to change.”
Scorpius nodded, unsure how, or even if, he should respond.
Draco could feel himself blushing. Not wanting to admit that he’d just been thinking about marrying his ex-husband (merlin, it felt weird to even
And so he spent the morning inspecting furniture, art, kitchenware, plants, and a whole variety of other gifts that a young adult might appreciate. As he browsed, Harry became more and more aware that he didn’t know what Scorpius’ flat looked like. He’d thought Scorpius might need a couple of days to settle in, and that was why Harry hadn’t been invited over to look around. But surely a week was enough time, right? As Harry continued to mull over whether it would be appropriate to pop in and surprise his son, he suddenly realised that he didn’t have the address.
“Harry, shut up,” she groaned. “Maybe he was visiting a friend who works there, or maybe they’re researching something that has perfectly legal medical applications. Either way, it’s
“Is this about the same issue as last week?”
“Honestly, mate, everything,” Blaise drawled. “Maybe you’re not cut out to be a children’s author.”
“It’s cold!” he said, surprised.
While the whole country was beautiful, Harry had really enjoyed the connection with nature up in the small village much more than the typical tourist attractions in the city. Though he had to admit, being in the city had its perks. He had found a beautiful shop full of intricate wooden pieces the other day, just down the street from one of the many museums had seen. Deciding to take a look, he’d been thrilled to find a display of wooden spoons called love spoons. The small card that came with each spoon explained that these were traditional spoons for showing affection. It seemed like a lovely gift to give, and they weren’t too expensive. He picked up three—one for Ron, one for Hermione, and one for Draco. He was making his way over to the counter to pay when it suddenly struck him that this would be a nice gift to give Camilla too. After all, he was buying one for each of his other friends—why should she be left out?
“Of course,
Harry nodded sympathetically. “You must be exhausted. I wouldn’t have blamed you for skiving off and just going home.”
McGonagall laughed.
"So you want kids?"
A minute later, Draco found himself in the old Black house, which Harry had inherited, scolding himself for being so weak-willed. Harry had given him a doe-eyed look that he hadn’t been able to resist. It seemed Draco wasn’t the only persuasive one out of the pair of them.
“As if that wasted hour wasn’t enough, the amount of paperwork I had to do regarding the accident when I got back was ridiculous. I don’t know who trained these interns, but the dolts disposed of all the potion without taking any samples or running any tests. Thankfully they put it in a bin instead of vanishing it, so we were able to pull it out and separate the components, which gave me more than enough evidence to fire Berntsen. Though now I’m down a senior potioneer. I’ve been reading the applications I have on hand and writing a call for more resumes all day.”
"Your parents will be so mad!" he blurted, realising belatedly that that shouldn't have been his first concern when a girl he'd only known for a couple of weeks was kissing him. But that was the thing, wasn't it? They'd known each other for a couple of weeks now, and he had to admit that he liked her very much. Heck, he'd bought her something called a "love spoon" as a souvenir. No wonder she was kissing him.
“I ate three whole plates!” Harry pointed out.
“Um, I thought we should wait for your Papa to board before we continue,” he said, pointing at Draco, who was now wading toward them.
Harry considered the question. His first instinct was to reassure Draco that of course he’d help him, but it wasn’t exactly true. Harry had been furious when he’d walked in to find Draco here the week before, and if it had been Draco who’d reached out instead of Scorpius, Harry would probably have slammed the floo closed and never spoken to him again.
Draco stood up and leaned over Scorpius, scooping his son gently into his arms.
“He mentioned that,” Harry admitted. “I didn’t realise it was so bad that you can’t even have salt and pepper.”
Harry stared warily at the spoon, before finally leaning in and accepting the bite. He was surprised to find that Bryan was right. The cake was light, melting in his mouth with a sweet, chocolatey flavour.
"I didn't know," he croaked out, feeling like the world's biggest scumbag and idiot at the same time.
They had then invited Harry to have lunch with them, and he’d soon realised that even though he was only 25 years old, he was probably the oldest person in the group. That didn’t stop them from inviting him
“Yeah! Grandma always lets me have more cookies than Papa does, and she lets me go to bed later too.”
"Oh, that's kind of you, Harry," Draco said, accepting the chocolates and smiling at Harry. "Don't tell me you booked an appointment just to bring us gifts?"
“No, another Healer did it, but it didn’t seem to work at first. She wasn’t able to speak until Malfoy came and fixed something. All the mediwixen and Trainee Healers seemed to move much more efficiently after he showed up, too.”
“Nonsense. I asked you out, it only makes sense that I treat you to dinner.”
,” Ron grumbled as Peeves flew off. “Clearly Peeves has gone round the twist. What a ridiculous story. His song wasn’t even that good.”
They scream and curse at Peevsy,
“My apologies, Harry. I didn’t mean to confuse you. Was there a specific word that you wanted me to explain?”
Draco hesitated. He was going to have to share a room, and a bed with Harry? He
“Well then, lead the way.”
The next few days continued much in the same way. They would spend most of the day wandering the city, exploring new cuisines and historical sites. Having a five-year-old in tow was quite an experience for Harry. He’d never considered how different a child’s needs could be. Scorpius often got tired from lots of walking, and was never shy about asking for souvenirs or snacks that caught his eye. By their third day, Harry found that he and Draco were able to communicate just from looking at each other, deciding in a split second glance who would deal with Scorpius’ next tantrum or indulge his next whim. He was also surprised to find that the city looked very different from a child’s perspective.
Agent Delta scowled as they marched down the sterile hallway. Interns were the worst. Logically, Agent Delta understood that as department members were lost to other opportunities, or retirement (or worse—there was no telling in this line of work), their positions would have to be filled by new members. But that didn’t make the interns any less awful.
“It might take a little longer for me to resolve this one,” Draco added, accepting the papers Harry gave him. “I won’t be able to take Scorpius to such a hot place, so I’ll have to beg my mother to watch him for a bit. I’ll be a bit delayed in leaving.”
“Because I have questions!” Scorpius said defensively.
Bryan groaned. “You’re not going to let that go, are you?”
Harry laughed. “I don’t even know if I’m a decent seeker anymore. Can’t remember the last time I had a proper game if I’m being honest.”
Harry found him crying in the kitchen the next morning, a copy of
“HE KILLED THE MINISTER!” Harry shouted. “Never mind
“Ah, yes. Those blasted busybodies. Well, come in boy, come in. I don’t know why those idiots think I’m dying, or being robbed every night, but…”
“Why don’t you get ready and I’ll tell you on the way,” Harry said.
“Harry. Old boy, how are you?” Smith said jovially, acting as if nothing had happened.
Harry pinched the bridge of his nose, trying to keep calm. He hoped Bryan would still want a divorce now that he knew Harry was famous.
“I did not,” Harry protested, trying to ignore Draco grinning like the cat that got the cream. He wasn’t the only one either—everyone else was also smiling.
“My host convinced me to participate in what he described as a male beauty contest.”
“Honestly, sometimes he still acts like it,” Teddy said sarcastically. Scorpius raised an eyebrow at him—Teddy’s sarcasm usually meant he was nervous, or feeling left out.
“I do. And if you’re okay with it, I’d like to get to know you too.”
They sat there in silence for a little while, and Scorpius contemplated telling his dad that he was looking into the case, that it had been handled by an incompetent kiss-arse, that he was bound to find some answers soon. But then his dad started speaking again, and he realised that telling him about the case would have been a mistake.
Something was poking Harry in the ribs. He tried to shove it away, but his arms felt like they were being held down by leaded weights. He cracked an eye open, and immediately regretted it. Bright light flooded under his eyelid, which he snapped shut with a groan.
"If she asks for something, money for example, are you willing to give it to her, or do you want me to fight it?"
"Holy shit," Bryan gasped, looking at the paper in horror.
“‘Mione, I saw Malfoy going into the department today!”
Draco shrugged. “I think small amounts would be okay, but Scorpius seems to be very cautious these days. Not that I’m complaining,” he added hastily. “I really am grateful for everything he’s doing for me.”
Regards,
“I would like to hear from the defendant himself that this is the correct version of events. There have been too many crossed wires in this case. Court will adjourn for today, and will reconvene tomorrow where the defendant will be presented, after which the court will vote with it’s final decision. Head Auror Clearwater, please arrange for transportation from Azkaban by tomorrow morning.”
Harry looked up to find Draco scrutinising the marriage certificate and comparing it to some notes he'd laid out. He wasn't paying attention to Harry at all.
Harry fought back a laugh. He wasn’t quite a teenager anymore.
“It’s not my fault trouble always finds me,” he grumbled. Draco turned to look at him.
“He… what’s his specialisation, again?” the receptionist asked.
And Potty’s hands are going far,
"What do you think will be good?" Harry asked, looking down at his menu after the server had returned with the wine. He glanced up at her, and smiled at the look of intense concentration on her face as she bit her lip and contemplated the menu. He didn't even hear what she ordered for him, choosing instead to just enjoy the atmosphere and the company.
Scorpius eyed Silverthorn’s files again, suddenly much more motivated to read them.
“For at least two years. I’m going to study business law. I’ve wanted to do it since I finished Hogwarts, but I haven’t been able to afford it.”
“Ah, so you
He turned to Draco, clearly unable to remember the word.
“What kind of book would you write?” Pansy asked.
“Headmistress. Thank you for meeting with me today.”
"Safe trip Harree."
“How dare you—how can you even—what the fuck did you just say to me?” Harry demanded. He wasn’t sure why it rankled him even more to see Teddy sitting calmly on the couch.
“Scorpius, you need to calm down. You just barged your way into Harry’s private room and now you won’t stop talking. I need you to take some deep breaths, sweetheart.”
“It’s not ideal,” Draco agreed. “But it’s not like St Mungo’s will take me. They’ve made it clear that they don’t trust me to be on their staff.”
“I… you… that wasn’t…” Potter spluttered, clearly not having expected Draco to start flirting with him.
“Well then, isn’t it great that they’re joining our debriefings? You’ll get to know everything right away.”
“I’m not surprised at all that Draco was sentimental enough to keep pictures of both of you in his journal,” Teddy snorted, when Scorpius showed them to him.
Clearly getting a straight answer out of Draco wasn’t going to be easy. He let Draco continue to ramble on about the bureaucracy and inefficiency in the hospital’s hierarchy while thinking about the fact that this was just another challenge. He and Draco had spent their lives challenging each other, whether in class, on the pitch, or during the war. After such a long rivalry, they were attuned to each other in a way that no one else was, always waiting to catch the other slip up.
“Could you guys give us a moment?” Harry asked, when Bryan was done at the counter. The other nodded and turned away.
“Um, well, there’s not much he can eat. He has to be really careful about his diet, because of his joints, and because he’s not used to… well, you don’t exactly get curry in prison.” It had been a shock to Scorpius when Adella had explained to him how strict Draco would have to be about what he ate, at least until he regained some strength. He’d never been faced with the reality of what inmates in Azkaban ate until he’d seen his father vomit from a plate of roast beef and gravy—it had been too rich for him to stomach.
“Why are you asking me out?” Potter demanded. Draco shrugged.
“Hi Dad,” Scorpius mumbled. Harry gave him a small smile and handed over a small blue bag.
"Remember, you have to think long and hard about your true love before you marry them!" Scorpius said, cheering up a little.
A single tear ran down the side of Draco’s face, and Scorpius thought it might be from joy. He didn’t blame the man—he’d cry with relief too if he’d had to spend 15 years in Azkaban. He held still as his father reached out with a shaky hand and cupped his cheek.
“I don’t mind,” Draco said, still grinning at him. “If I’m being honest, these days I’m fairly obsessed with you too.”
That sounded awfully intimate to Harry, but he didn’t know how to say so without sounding rude—they were on a date, after all. He nodded meekly, and cast around for something to say as the server cleared their table.
Suddenly, inspiration struck.
“So you’ve been working on those Transfiguration cases, right? How is that going?”
But if his plan wasn’t working out, then why was Harry dating him? It would probably make more sense to end things now, and solve this mystery a different way. He had to admit, though, Draco was attractive, in more ways than one. In just two dates, he’d shown that he was clever, charming and considerate, and Harry was genuinely enjoying his company. He couldn’t actually fancy Draco Malfoy… could he?
“Your magic seems to be quite strong,” he commented. Draco nodded.
“Come on, let’s go join everyone!” Joel called. Without waiting for a reply, he downed his drink  and stood up, wandering out into the crowd and quickly attaching himself to a girl they’d never seen before, but who seemed quite pleased with the attention nonetheless.
Scorpius gulped, not having even thought of that. He remembered the sight of his father stumbling as he’d been led into the courtroom earlier, and quickly resolved to keep his hands to himself.
His Aunt’s house looked nothing like the manor had, with its opulent décor and aristocratic features. It looked like an ordinary house, cosy and personal and with a surprising number of muggle touches. He belatedly remembered that her husband had been Muggle-born. He offered to help her out in the kitchen since she clearly didn’t have any elves, but was quickly shooed out into the hall to play with Teddy. Draco smiled when he found Teddy drawing pictures with the colour-changing markers Harry had given him earlier that week and readily accepted one of the markers. They chatted about the nonsensical things eight year olds liked to talk about while drawing pictures, and before long, Teddy was making up all kinds of games with the markers, such as cauldrons and wands (which he soon found out was really just a fancy way of saying x’s and o’s) and drawing competitions. Draco was surprised at how much fun he had engaging with his cousin and couldn’t help feeling a little guilty that he probably wouldn’t see the kid very much over the next two years.
As usual, Harry seemed thrilled to reminisce about Teddy and Scorpius. They spent the rest of the day going through the various albums Harry had collected over the years, stopping only to eat the lentil soup he’d heard so much about. It was well past Draco’s usual bedtime by the time they resurfaced from the albums, but he wasn’t complaining. Now that he’d seen the pictures and heard the stories, it almost felt like he’d been there for the past 15 years.
Scorpius sighed, burying his face in his hands. She was right, but that didn’t make it any easier to face the fact that his father was a criminal. He looked up when she let out a soft “oops”, just in time to see her pick up the pictures of Harry and Scorpius. They must have slipped out of the back of the journal.
“He does cook other things,” Draco told him. “Especially in the evenings, he’ll usually grill some chicken or fish. He just leaves casseroles whenever you’re coming, because he wants something you can easily heat up. He keeps saying he doesn’t want to bother you.”
It took all of Draco’s will power to resist rolling his eyes. Instead, he sent the report off to the records department and made his way toward the door.
“Actually, in terms of your wedding, everything worked out quite easily. Your friend, Hassan, had already been working on the whole thing for you.”
"I'll pay for your train ticket, and a separate hotel room if you want. Just come with me."
“I’ve got to go,” he said, before Potter could reply. “I’ll see you Friday, yeah? And for Salazar’s sake, please register with a General Healer
"You are watching sun?" she asked, pointing out at the horizon, which was slowly turning orange. Harry nodded.
“Well, maybe you can help me figure out what they are. What are all these?” he asked, pointing to the fridge, the microwave and the coffee maker.
"Sorry, this my Pappa," she said hastily, before saying something to her father, in a clear attempt to calm him down. After a minute of back and forth between them, her father stepped back and gestured for Harry to come in, slamming the door behind him. Harry stood where he was, shooting confused glances at Camilla as her father circled him, clearly sizing him up. Finally, the man faced Harry and started to speak. Harry listened politely, and thankfully Camilla hurried to translate as soon as he was done.
“Greengrass,” the Head Auror said sharply. “As much as this case has a personal meaning to you, don’t forget that you are investigating as an
And there was that smile again, the one that lit up Harry’s entire face. It made Draco’s heart pound in a way that was at once terrifying and exhilarating. Inexplicably, Draco’s thoughts drifted to the most secretive of his now ex-colleagues. The Unspeakable team who studied Love Magic really did deserve more applause for their work—matters of the heart were complicated.
Harry shrugged. He hadn’t slept much, but he didn’t want to dump his emotions on Teddy.
“I… well, I meant to,” Harry said, trying to avoid Draco’s gaze. He could tell he was going to get a lecture about this later. “I, uh… well I got distracted talking to Draco.”
On this night of summer stars
"You live in New York?" Draco asked, sounding annoyed. "Oh, that's going to be a whole different process. Though it might not matter anymore if the marriage was consummated or not."
“Draco?” Mcgonagall reached out and covered his hand with her own, prompting him to look up at her.
Harry nodded. “It’s okay. Like you said, I’m here to experience the fun things I couldn’t do before. So let’s get going, instead of sitting here and exchanging sad stories.”
“Anything on your end?” Agent Delta asked. Agent Eta shrugged.
“What are those?” Scorpius asked curiously.
“The court hears your request. Your first piece of evidence, council?”
“Merlin, I hope it’s actually an unregistered Animagus,” she grumbled, marching away. Scorpius chuckled, sighing in relief as he opened the folder. It seemed to be a typical case of someone having moved into a new apartment and not updated the wards right away, which provided a prime opportunity for someone to break in and steal a family heirloom and a money bag full of gold.
“Well, I’ll get out of your hair then, now that that’s been cleared up,” Scorpius said, putting his tea cup down.
“Yeah right,” Ron snorted. “As if Harry would be involved with the Ferret.”
Harry could tell that Draco was nervous. It was actually quite sweet, if he was being honest. Draco had arrived at Harry’s place dressed in beautifully tailored trousers, paired with a black turtleneck and a navy blue blazer. The dark colours contrasted with his silvery blond hair, reminding Harry a little bit of an angel. The thought felt sacrilegious, however, because Draco looked
Harry considered that. It must really be a depressing job to have to break people up all the time. He wondered what Draco thought of having to have done it four times for him, but he was too scared to ask.
“Head Auror Clearwater,” the chief warlock called. “Can you explain what these photographs are?”
Harry blushed at that. “I, um… I’ve never been very trusting of Unspeakables, if I’m being honest. They’re the only department at the Ministry that we don’t have oversight over, and that’s always made me a little suspicious. I may have… well, I did a little spying of my own.”
Harry hesitated.
Draco shook his head. “I’ve resigned. I couldn’t lie to you anymore. You mean too much to me.”
“You’d better have it by the time the potion’s done.”
"Did you sign anything?"
Her eyes widened at that.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry shook his head to rid himself of the ridiculous direction his thoughts were taking. Of course he wasn’t falling for Malfoy. He was probably just caught up in the nerves and emotions of dating someone for the first time—he hadn’t realised that pretending could be as frightening as he’d always imagined the real thing to be. He was nothing if not a Gryffindor, though. He could deal with frightening things. It couldn’t hurt to see Draco a few more times, just to be absolutely sure that he wasn’t up to anything. In fact, it was Harry’s duty, if anything.
“Even the most skilled arithmancers can’t count how many rules and laws he broke in his Hogwarts days, though,” Penenlope said, smirking at Harry. “There’s no way he would have deferred to authority and been able to follow instructions the way an Auror should.”
“I’ve taught you how to make curry,” his dad pointed out. “Why don’t you just make it for yourself?”
They locked eyes, Draco standing over Harry, who was still curled up on the couch. It was an unbearably tender moment, and Draco couldn’t help reaching out with his free hand and brushing the curls off of Harry’s face. It looked like Harry was about to say something, but after a moment he shook his head, and released Draco’s hand.
“You two left together last night, didn’t you?” Joel said slyly. Harry blushed at that, but at that moment Bryan himself showed up, rucksack slung over his back as well.
Harry bit his lip. He had definitely become fast friends with Hassan over the course of his stay here, and it was showing with the way this man cared for him. Harry thought of his own friends from back home, and how they all did similar things to help him with his self-esteem. They kept telling him that he was very harsh on himself, but Harry couldn't help thinking that something must be wrong with him, especially after the whole mess with Laura. He'd lost track of how many times he'd broken down crying in Ron and Hermione's living room, or in Draco's office because he just felt so worthless sometimes.
His dad opened his mouth to argue, but Scorpius cut him off as something else occurred to him.
“Is that grounds for re-oh-oh-opening the case?” Teddy asked, a yawn commandeering his sentence.
"That's fair. I'm happy to pay for that."
Draco hadn’t quite hammered out the details yet, but now that Harry mentioned it, the thought of moving out of his current flat made him quite sad. Very few people had ever seen what it looked like, but it was so quintessentially Draco—he’d put hours of work into making it entirely his space. On those days when being an Unspeakable had become unbearably lonely and confusing, his flat had been the one safe haven where Draco could truly be himself. He wasn’t going to need that anymore, but it wasn’t something he was ready to part with just yet.
Teddy mimed zipping his lips shut, but clearly the Black family dramatics were shining through, because he also vanished his whole mouth.
“Draco, what’s wrong?”
“Draco? Are you okay?”
The receptionist tapped a large leather-bound log book with his wand, and Harry watched as it flipped through what looked like hundreds of appointments. It finally stopped on a set of blank pages.
Draco wasn’t prepared for how insecure Harry looked. He shouldn’t care—they weren’t
Hermione chuckled, leaning into Ron. “Yeah, Ron’s right. Why don’t you take up knitting or something?”
Once he'd been deemed ready to go, Camilla's father led him out of the house and down the walkway into the village. It wasn't long before Harry realised they were headed to the church. Everyone else walking up the drive seemed to be dressed rather nicely too, and Harry assumed they were taking him for some kind of prayer. He wasn't in the least bit religious, but it was touching that they'd thought to include him in what was obviously an important morning for them.
“From what I’ve heard, it also has a play area for kids, and each burger comes with a little toy. It has enough space and is lively enough that they could move around and play with each other. At Harmony Table they had to sit still and speak softly, which to be honest they could do anywhere. It might be a lovely experience for people like us, but it was nothing special to them.”
“Really?” Draco asked, glancing at Harry.
Harry nodded, gulping at the cold liquid.
She flipped the picture of Scorpius over, probably out of habit, since Aurors were trained to check all sides of everything they touched, and Scorpius watched as her eyes widened comically. He’d never seen Head Auror Clearwater surprised—she’d always seemed ineffable to him. She reached for the other photo and flipped it over as well before Scorpius remembered there had been writing on the other side.
“I found Papa’s case file in that cabinet. This was before you told me about what had happened, and I was so curious, that I started to read it. It wasn’t long before Head Auror Clearwater caught on, and revealed to me that there had been something weird about Papa’s case. She hadn’t had the seniority to address it at the time, but she suggested that I review it, and see what I found.”
“Merlin, even I would have made a better Head Auror than that pillock,” Harry chuckled.
It didn’t take long for Draco to rule out any possible cause of itching in a man’s nether regions. His Diagnostic Spell revealed no infection of any sort, which matched what Potter said about never having a sexual partner. He ran his fingers carefully over Potter’s skin, even in the most intimate areas, trying to feel for any cuts or bumps, but his skin seemed perfectly fine. Satisfied that he’d done everything to make sure he wouldn’t be getting slapped with a malpractice suit for misdiagnosing the world’s saviour, Draco straightened up and removed his gloves.
He stifled a smile. “Yes, well, it wasn’t Stibbons, and yet he tried to heal her anyway.”
As the evening went on, Harry enjoyed himself more and more, though he had to admit that the friends and family were all getting rather rowdy, considering how much they'd been drinking all day. They were still celebrating by dinner time, though the restaurant owners had opened out the large patio doors, allowing some cool fresh air in. By the time dinner was over, Harry found himself yawning—he really had been woken up early. Camilla picked up on it right away, dragging him up and out the back door, as if they couldn't be seen leaving.
"I think I have to go home soon," he said to Camilla as she pushed open the front door. She looked a little sad, but nodded.
"Papa likes roast beef sandwiches," Scorpius said helpfully, causing Draco to finally look up from his papers.
"Draco Malfoy. And this is my son. Scorpius, please say hello."
Harry watched silently as Malfoy marched along the black tiles. For a moment, Harry wondered if he was going down to the courtrooms on Level Ten, but there were no Wizengamot hearings scheduled for the day. In the few times he’d skulked around out here, however, he’d noticed that everyone who wasn’t wearing the typical navy blue Unspeakable robes had turned and made their way down those stairs. He watched, surprised, as the black door leading into the round room swung open at Malfoy’s approach. That meant that Malfoy had some business with the department—Harry had tried slipping through that door enough times to know how it worked.
He’d already read it cover to cover, but seeing his father’s handwriting made Scorpius feel just a little closer to the man he missed so much. Scorpius skipped over the potions notes and just looked for the personal ones. There had been a few about a Ministry Gala—get robes pressed, babysitter for Scorpius, and RSVP. Scorpius couldn’t help wondering if his father had met the Minister at the Gala, had spoken to him, knowing he would soon be murdered. It made his stomach churn to think of such a situation. How could a person stand and talk to two others, know they would soon be trying to frame one for murdering the other?
“Oh, he does it on purpose,” Draco explained, his smile fading a little. “I’m afraid there’s a rather exhaustive list of the things I can’t eat much of, and many spices fall onto that list.”
“I… it was a traditional event that he said would be a great experience. So I went with it. But he forgot to tell me that it was usually used as a matchmaking thing, or his friend who was guiding us forgot to tell the tribe leaders that I wasn’t actually on the market for a bride. Long story short, one of the girls apparently liked me, and she and her family were very disappointed when I left without her.”
“But you don’t want to,” McGonagall said knowingly. “You’ve become attached as well.”
, if it hadn’t been Scorpius asking.”
"Oh, well I... thank you, Harry, that was thoughtful of you. I guess I should get Scorpius upstairs and changed then."
was a very elegant-looking establishment. Malfoy was already sitting at a table when he arrived, dressed as posh as ever in a tailored navy blue suit and reading the contents of a green folder. Harry was just wondering if he might get a chance to peek at the folder, when the hostess approached him. He waved her away, hoping to be able to sneak up behind Malfoy. Unfortunately, Malfoy noticed him walking over and slipped the folder into his robe pocket, which must have had an Undetectable Extension Charm on it. He was surprised to see Malfoy stand up at his arrival, though that was nothing compared to him pulling out his chair for him. Harry had thought that was only a gesture made in movies and felt oddly flattered as he sat down.
“Is all this really necessary?”
“Stay,” Harry, begged. He hadn’t realised how much he enjoyed Draco and Scorpius’ company, but the thought of spending another week here without them wasn’t a nice one.
Teddy grimaced. “Polyjuice is a long process. How soon do you need it?”
With that he banged his gavel, and the court started to shuffle out of the room. Scorpius stayed where he was, still trying to process what had just been said. He was vaguely aware of Teddy sitting down next to him, and Harrison standing in front of him, but his mind could only focus on one thought: he was finally going to see his father tomorrow.
“I will,” he assured her, picking up a pinch of floo powder. He had just tossed it into the flames, and was about to step in, when she spoke up again.
The sun was rising by the time Draco was certain he’d done enough to, at the very least, keep the patient stable for a few hours. He cast a fresh Stasis Charm over the sleeping girl and double checked the Monitoring Charms around the room. With a flick of his wand, the chart updated itself to show that he was now the primary Healer on the case and that no spells were to be cast on her until his return.
“I’m going to recommend that you stay here for at least a week, Mr. Malfoy,” she said to Draco. “Your joints seem to have deteriorated a lot over the years, so I’ll start you on a course of potions for that, and it seems your body is having a lot of trouble regulating its temperature right now too.”
“So the only way to make sure she’s okay is what I just did? To go over everything in her body and make sure it’s all in place?”
“The Wizengamot released Draco from Azkaban,” Teddy said simply. “He spent a week in St. Mungo’s, and now he’s living with Scorpius.”
“Aw, that’s rough. I’m sorry to hear that,” Bryan said tactfully, though somehow, he didn’t sound very sorry at all. He patted Harry on the back, but he didn’t lower his hand afterwards, instead resting it on Harry’s shoulder.
"I brought you liquorice chocolates, actually," Harry said, handing the neatly wrapped box to Draco. "They're considered a delicacy there."
St. Mungo’s was bustling as usual, but Scorpius didn’t stop to gaze curiously at the odd conditions people seemed to arrive with. He raced down the halls toward the East wing with Teddy right behind him. They only stopped to consult a Medi-witch, who led them to Draco’s room. He was sitting on a hospital bed, looking around curiously as Adella cast a variety of diagnostic spells on him. Scorpius stood frozen in the doorway as she finished, unsure if he was allowed to go sit next to his father or not. Clearly feeling more confident about the situation, Teddy wandered into the room and plopped down on a chair next to the bed.
But Harry had to know what Malfoy was up to. And what better way to do that than to
“I’m not actually a Legilimens,” Agent Delta said petulantly. This wasn’t a conversation they were looking forward to.
Scorpius nodded. “The steps for the Polyjuice are modified. The numbers in the margins are calculations for how long a dose from each modification would last.”
Scorpius had to grab the edge of the bench he was sitting on as Harrison resumed her seat and the Chief Warlock stood up. All the evidence and arguments they’d found had been presented. Now was the time for the court to ask any questions they had, and then Harrison would give her closing remarks and the court would make their decision. The Chief Warlock asked for questions, but when no one raised their hand, he turned back to Harrison.
“Harry?” Draco called, just as Harry had reached for the powder. He turned to see Draco sitting in the same spot, smiling softly at him.
"What's comummated?" Scorpius asked again. Draco groaned, turning toward his son once more.
“Harry!” Harry called out, cupping the edge of the wings to his mouth. Draco smiled at him from the side of the stage, clearly trying not to laugh at all Harry’s antics.
"Hmm?"
-Hassan
Just then, Draco walked back into the room, levitating a gold-rimmed glass of water. He set it down on a wooden coaster that matched the floors, and gestured at the sofa.
Scorpius laughed as they marched across the pit.
“I’m sorry to leave you to finish eating on your own, but I have to dash.” He stood up and took a moment to straighten his robes, before picking up his folder.
The more he thought about it, the more it made sense. Harry had said that Draco was withdrawn in the weeks before he’d been arrested—he must have been nervous about modifying the potion, and worried for Scorpius’ life.
With a curt nod, Draco took Scorpius' hand and disappeared back into his office. Smiling, and excited for his upcoming trip, Harry waved to Priscillia and disapparated on the spot.
. They’d fought all their lives. Two brief, civil conversations were no guarantee that they would get along.
He spent another hour flipping back and forth through it, but found nothing new. He kept pondering the question of why his father would have wanted to develop a potion that was less effective. The only thing he could think of was that Silverthorn’s planned schedule for getting into the Minister’s office and out again must have been tight. But then wouldn’t he have just taken a smaller dose?
Draco frowned. “One of the basic principles of Healing is that you cannot Transfigure an unhealthy body into a healthy one. Most individual organs, yes, but not the whole body.”
Draco smiled. “I’m happy to help, Harry.”
“I can do it,” he said gently, and once again, the kitchen cleaned itself with a flick of his wand. Harry watched in awe for a moment, before turning his attention back to Draco.
“Draco. My name is Draco.”
“Are you okay?” Harry asked, after yet another minute had passed. “You seem to be having some trouble deciding.”
Draco rolled his eyes. “No, I’m saying you should let them choose where they want to go and what they want to do. Within reason of course, but there’s no way Harry’s going to be able to spoil Teddy properly with salmon tartare and flambéed brussel sprouts.”
“And I’m guessing that also means you don’t want the potions job anymore?” she sighed, rolling her eyes when Draco shook his head.
I must admit that my purpose in writing this letter was two-fold. If, you are as fed up as I think you are, then there is every possibility that you may be amenable to an arrangement that may allow us both to control the narrative while engaging in a bit of journalistic misdirection. Especially since I know how much you loathe Rita Skeeter and I think that being able to get one over on her would be excellent fun.
Some unbelievable information has recently come to light about the man we all look up to. In an exclusive interview with yours truly,
“My office, now,” she said curtly, turning and marching away. Harry sighed, glancing about the office and relieved to find that only a couple of people were around and that none of them seemed to be listening. He got reprimanded at work embarrassingly often, now that he thought about it. He should probably do something about that, but he couldn’t help it. The only department in the entire Ministry that they hadn’t been able to review and audit in the years since they’d created MOMERO was the Department of Mysteries. Hermione kept telling him not to worry about it, but Harry couldn’t help thinking that someone higher up was threatening her to leave it alone. Hermione definitely wouldn’t take a bribe, and Harry couldn’t help thinking that something scary enough to successfully threaten Hermione was definitely worth looking into.
The conversation continued to flow as their food arrived. The ravioli was delicious, and Malfoy somehow managed to make eating a cheeseburger look graceful. He even offered Harry a few of his chips, which were coated in some fancy seasoning but tasted incredible.
“Scorpius! Aren’t you supposed to be at work right now?”
His friends had been pestering him for a while now to get out in the world and start dating, but it didn’t feel like it should be a high priority at this point in his life. He didn’t feel the same urgency to get into a relationship that everyone else seemed to have. He wanted it, just not badly enough to do something about it.
Then he'd nuzzled up to him, inhaling the pure, sweet scent at that wonderful point on his neck, and slipped back inside.
He's an experiment trapped in the body of a man, ridiculed by society, barely recovering from decades of hate crumbling into something warm and inviting.
"No. Walburga did. Burned off everyone she considered a traitor." Harry explained, placing the bowls on a small table in the corner. "Ted, come eat."
His neck, chest and arms were littered with a thousand tiny bite marks - anywhere Draco had been able to reach. Thousands of bites and kisses, just so he could tell the world that this man - this beautiful, irresistible man - was his.
"Malfoy. Harry said someone was coming for the job. I didn't realise he meant you." She cast a glance at Potter, eyes narrowed. "I hope we'll be able to work together without any... repeats of the past."
"So, who else is coming?" Harry asked, glancing at the floo.
"Draco that's not- I didn't mean-" Potter lowers his head, gritting his teeth. "I mean you had to have known it was possible the second time, and still decided it- we - were a good idea."
"No! I don't give a shit, but you are not doing this. You are not going to go anywhere near me again. You are not going to have anything to do with this baby. You are not going to call me Draco! Now get the fuck out of my house!"
Draco realised he'd spent too long just staring at Harry's arms, managing to drag his eyes up to the man's face.
They're organising a job for him. Without his input.
"Fuck."
Harry looked like he wanted to say more, but didn't. Instead, he nodded, told Scorpius he was lucky and turned to figure out where the small boy Draco had seen had disappeared to.
"You would have gotten them back next month anyway, but I thought you'd like them back as soon as possible. I also have this for Draco."
"Braiding!" One boy answered, not bothering to turn around as he barrelled towards the office.
"Draco," his mother said from the doorway, "there's an auror here to see us."
Draco went to his rooms to change, then to the kitchens for food. The elves had all scattered at the sight of him, rushing to prepare a meal.
Draco stiffened slightly - shoulders pulled taught, back straightening - as he took a breath.
"Luna, we'll let you know."
"He's not escaping any time soon," Jenna assured. grinning.
We find out what happened after Harry and Draco had dinner... and it's not what either of them were hoping for.
"Oh, he's lovely." Harry knew this had to be Kay, Jenna's older sister. He could see it in their eyes. "What do you think, Dray?"
Draco's eyes snapped up at the use of his given name, focusing on the way Potter's hand disappeared into his robes. When it emerged with a sheaf of parchment, he was distinctly disappointed.
Harry saw the flash in Andromeda's eye when Draco called him Harry. It was quick, a barely-there question, but it was there.
"Edward Remus Lupin, you will not be going to your birthday party naked!"
Harry cracks a smile, shooting a glance at Jenna. His boss takes it well, shaking her head and telling the newest member of the team to fuck off.
This was the first cock he'd ever sucked - plastic ones not included - and he was determined not to fuck it up.
"Yeah. I woke up to him shouting at me, then he kicked me out."
Draco could feel his mother tense up beside him as she reached for her wand, holding it lightly.
"Basket?"
"The medics think it's something to do with the wolf part of the anatomy. After a certain period of time - they think it's about two or three years - it starts to change. Instead of only coming to the mind at the full moon, it stays alive for a week or so afterwards. We've spoken to some people who were bitten when they were kids, or just a long time ago, and they say it takes over in a different way a week after the full moon."
He'd even cum in the shower, imagining what would happen tonight. Imagining a tall, lithe body pressing him against the tiles and fucking him into oblivion.
"Would you like any tea, Auror Potter?" His mother offers, ready to call a house elf.
Shoulders back - not like you're in the army, Potter, just stop slouching - hip against his desk, arms in front of him. He stuffed his hands into his pockets, fingering his phone and the condoms he brought. Just in case.
Draco tore his gaze from Potter, glancing round to find an empty table. They were all full, covered in couldrons or papers or ingredients.
He could do it himself. Of course he could do it himself, but this was a principle. A game they always played. A game that had – as long as Draco could remember – ended the same.
Potter took it.
"Potter still can't reach the top."
"Fuck!" Potter cried, bruises blossoming where his hands latched to Draco's hips.
"What are you doing here?" His voice was rough like he'd been shouting longer than Draco had heard.
It took three heats for Draco to become used to the routine of working with Potter.
Andromeda had been sick, leaving the boy in Harry's care, and Harry had been on his way to a job interview.
"I think it's for the best. Don't you, Draco?"
It all seemed to click as he looked up, eyes wide, mouth a silent 'oh'.
Potter didn't argue - didn't even fight. Just held Draco's head in his hands, rocking his hips into the air.
"So," Sophie says, leaving forwards in her chair. "No nature ramble?"
"On my way, Ted!" Harry called back, indicating to Malfoy that he was allowed to follow.
"I know, that's why I'm asking."
“He said he’ll bring back Chinese to make up for it.”
"And how's that?"
Draco did start Monday.
“I get it. I don’t mind waiting.”
"I know. Off you go."
Hermione was knocking on Harry's door first thing Sunday morning, long before the sun had risen above the houses.
That was five years ago, when Draco was 19 and naïve.
The party went on for hours.
"No, Scorpius and I have other matters to attend to." Maintain the Malfoy name. "For a short while, we will be staying at the Leaky Cauldron, while we locate a more permanent place to stay. If you wouldn't mind owling me there when you have more information on a start date."
Potter clearly didn't like the sound of it.
They kept going long into the night - both of them sprawled in front of a cold fire without a care in the world.
"Yes," Maria agreed, nodding her head. Thick curls bounced over her eyes, then back again. "And I'm going to let my brother put it in a weave this weekend."
Part 2 is a few years after the first part. It was also started in October... let it sink in how terrible I am with writing things when I'm meant to.
"It looks too big for a dog."
Large, rough hands spread across his waist, hips bumping into his arse as lips met his shoulder.
A few days later, when Draco had finally managed to cast the spell correctly, a blinding white light had erupted from his wand.
Tuesday. Draco had gone to try out for a job on Wednesday.
"Mark me?" He had asked, barely whispering the words, bringing a hand to cradle Harry's head as he licked that spot. "Need you. Want you, please."
It was bad enough that he hadn’t finished decorating the nursery – the git wanted to do it the Muggle way, for fuck’s sake – but now he had also eaten all the custard creams.
Draco placed a hand on his thigh, leaning in to whisper in his ear.
Draco didn't know how Potter had found out, but he was determined to learn.
"Can you see without your glasses-"
"This is Teddy, my godson," Harry explained, grabbing the boy from behind and hoisting him onto his shoulder. "Your aunt Andromeda is his grandmother."
“Have you seen Harry? Or the kids?” She shot him a strange look over her shoulder as she moved towards the kitchen.
They were making his skin itch all over, and the sick feeling in his gut wasn't going away, but he had to keep going. It had faded after his last transformation. Okay, it took a week and a bit, but it all died down. He just had to wait a week this time.
"Why would I want to do that?"
"I don't want to interrupt you, but I think there's going to be a murder if someone doesn't stop the kids." Jo butts in, pointing up towards the office. A string of desert-related curses was slowly getting louder.
Harry's teeth had torn through the skin, sending sparks shooting down Draco's spine as he came undone once more.
"Just pick what you're eating, Potter."
Harry shook his head, mind wondering to what the blond would be wearing.
"But you said dinner went well?" Maria asked, picking up a few balls and beginning to juggle them. "Maybe he'll ask you out again, and learn not to give you whiskey this time."
After four whiskeys, two ciders and an hour of Draco's - yes, at some point he became Draco - wonderfully crass jokes, he'd decided he didn't give a fuck what anyone else thought.
Next came Hermione, bushy hair pulled back on top of her head, debating something or other with Ginny. Behind was Molly, complaining about how her 'good for nothing son still refused to get a girlfriend'. Arthur was nodding solemnly followed by Charlie and George, copying the motion through their grins. It wasn't until Bill and Fleur came through with two young girls that Harry was finally noticed.
"Forget men, why do you have records? We're not updating them again, are we?"
He can see a tiny bit of the old fury rise in Malfoy before he's out the door, taking the steps and hoping Malfoy's following.
"Can you imagine Malfoy with pigtails?" She asked Harry, tears blossoming in her eyes.
Out of the corner of his eye, he vaguely saw Draco grinning at him.
Somehow, just beneath the surface of his skin, a crackling fire lit up with every push of Potter's hips.
"It increases fertility rates!" A medical witch cries, rushing into the potions lab.
This is the last chapter I have pre-written. Now writing on a week-by-week basis, so might not be able to upload every Thursday like I have been.
"There was a sign on the door, looking for a brewer. I- I need a job."
"Yeah, Hermione came round to catch up."
It wasn't like he had much to take. New charms had been put on Number 12, so even those who'd been there in the war couldn't find it, and Harry was quite content living a muggle life.
