Harry reached the corner of the corridor of the dorm, forcefully bumping into someone as he took rounded it.
"This is Veritaserum. Everyone has to take a few drops just so nobody can get called a liar when asked a Truth." Hermione passed the bottle to Pansy after swallowing the first of the potion.
-"Why didn't you come out to see me yesterday? What was so important? I hadn't seen you for fifteen days—"
-"Theo." Like it explained everything, sadly, it did. "It's making me worse, Harry—she's making me worse. But, Salazar, how I miss her! I can't stay away. Theo is getting suspicious because I'm increasingly more miserable after each time I see her. He probably thinks you're upsetting me so I'm safe for awhile, eventually he will try to talk me into granting him the permission to destroy your life—I know it's killing him to stay silent, pansy, the slut, had told him he was being overbearing and possessive and that somehow it was making me worse. There's nothing at all, in this whole wide world, that destabilizes or flusters Theo other than people insinuating, hinting at, or even joking, about him being anything less than a perfect...brother, best-friend, lover to me. We haven't even properly fought since we'd been fourteen and longingly pining for each other!"
Maybe if he wasn't so drained, he'd have felt mortified for saying such a thing and maybe if Draco wasn't so all-consumingly bereaved, he'd have Stupify-ed Harry and left. As it was they were both in deep shit - they didn't feel or do neither.
Pansy Parkison, stood right next to Lucius. She too was wearing a very, very, tight snakeskin leather dress. Except hers was gold, black and silver instead, it was strapless and didn't leave much to the imagination, along with high-heels that looked made out of glass. With one hand on her hip, she stared Harry down, appraising him, expression bord, like she'd rather be anywhere than there, trying to make another poor soul feel like an unworthy and disgraceful disappointment in life, which, today, happened to be Harry. She
soft and silky smooth and reaches all the way to my shoulder blades." Draco preened. "You can brush it as much as you want, darling." Draco said. Throwing more air kisses in Théo's direction.
After a prolonged lunch that Harry had gotten away with not touching since everyone was so busy patting Ginny's bump, Hermione stared at Harry in the eye, for the first time since everything broke out, and silently communicated that he should follow her.
—his signature—barely there sneer on his face, but it was enough, more than enough to make it almost impossible for Harry not to blush in indignation and/or touch his face, check his clothes, make sure he wasn't covered in shit. Because Lucius's barely-there sneer was so degrading and plain fucking evil. Lucius Malfoy was clad in a close-fitting, black, snakeskin leather, neck-to-ankle robe, that looked to be worth about what Harry made as an auror, in a
Although Ron couldn't really stop him from seeing Draco, he could tell Ginny everything. And even though Harry had been planning on doing that himself, things were different now and Ron knew it. Ron knew threatening that the entire family would cut ties with Harry for good wouldn't be enough a disincentive, for Harry had already made it clear that he cared for Draco more than all of them combined when he'd clutched him closer rather than push him away. But now that Ginny was pregnant - If Harry were to leave her now, they'd all hate him, which he didn't care about anymore, but if Harry left and Ron told her about his affair with Draco, Harry would be forgoing any rights he had over his unborn child. If Harry were to leave her, he'd be leaving his child too. Forever. For Ginny and the Weasleys would never forgive his deceit.
-"Salazar! Are you naturally this stupid or do you work at it? Draco must've slept with you to get back at the Weaslette, no doubt! I'll fucking convince him to let Pansy run the story sooner or later. We'd keep him anonymous of course. The Savior of the Wizarding World Can't Save his Marriage. Everyone would eat it up." He said mockingly, huffed and spun around, walking away, nose in the air.
Harry Potter didn't think. He knelt between Draco's knees, framed Draco's face with his own hands, leaning close, he pressed his lips to Draco's cheek. It was a chaste kiss. Barely a touch of lips. Harry blushed and sat back on his heels, he was brave. Yeah. His bravery was all his and real, so he looked up at Draco.
Pansy and Blaise would be checking up on Scorpius at Malfoy Manor now, reassuring him that his father loved him but had to go with Uncle Théo on a trip, that he would bring him so much presents - Grandpa Lucius and the house-elves would need to prepare him another Play-Room. He was five, they'd bought him a new kid-sized broom, promised him gifts and assured him of his father's love and all was well in
He didn't want Scorpius to see him weak and ill. It would scare him, because Scorpius had been there too when Astoria was dying. He'd watched his mother bedridden and growing weaker, sadder, and
Harry— to his horror—had unconsciously turned his face towards Draco's hand on his cheek so it'd fit better under Draco's cold, soft palm.
She was looking directly at Draco. She knew what she saw, she knew what it meant but she couldn't believe it so she asked. Hoping against all hope someone would contradict her eyes, tell her, her son was alright.
Harry's eyes prickled and burned, tears were forming, he blinked them away and stared at Draco, taking him all in.
Harry stared at Draco and felt an ocean of warmth and tenderness spring into existence in his chest. He sat up straighter, transfigured his winter scarf—because it was cold as fuck in the ministry—into a somewhat adequate blanket and tucked it around Draco. He brushed Draco's long , silky, white hair off his face and tucked it behind his ears. Draco seemed perturbed even in sleep. Harry didn't question the urge to kiss Draco's forehead. It felt natural, irrevocably so. Harry felt warm and dizzy with fondness the moment his lips touched the soft, pale skin. He really needed to leave, make up a story about where Draco was, give him time to recompose himself. He was sure Draco wouldn't appreciate Harry hanging around. Harry sighed miserably. He'd comeback later to check up on him. from far away, though. He didn't want to overwhelm Draco again. He wanted to be in Draco's life so he'll probably ask Hermione how to befriend him or even tell Ginny everything and ask for her help, she'd like that. Except, he wouldn't tell her everything of course—he'd tell her Draco's grieving his wife and that Harry wanted to be his friend.
-"Pimky." Pansy called. A house elf immediately apparated in the middle of the room. "Be a darling and poor us some fire-whiskey. You see, none of us can move lest their place be taken." She chuckled and said "Boys." Like it explained everything.
It wasn't one of Malfoy Manor's extravagantly luxurious restrooms, it didn't belong in Draco's home, where Draco was.
Pansy and Blaise were scanning the room, so Draco did the same. He hadn't stepped foot in England in eight years. He had Astoria and she was enough. She'd
The moment Harry became cognizant of what the fuck was happening—just happened. He launched himself across the club in swift strides, and out of the door, running at full speed towards their designated alleyway for apparition. As soon as he rounded the corner that led to it, he spotted what he assumed was Nott and Draco huddled together, in the dim light, readying for a side-along disapparition; he jumped and blindly reached for them, clutched the nearest arm as they started spinning in place to be transported Merlin knows where.
-"You tried to Crucio Bella, you Crucio-ed Amycus, used the imperius curse on that goblin, almost killed my son." He added in a vicious whisper so Scorpius wouldn't hear. Although it was unlikely he knew what any of those spells meant, with his young age and broken English. Except, there was no misinterpreting '
. And as your best friend, in that fleeting moment you've been unaware of us watching you two, I saw the best of you, Harry Potter."
fooled Harry, except he knew her well from everything Draco told him, so he knew she was having the time of her life, trying and
-"Pansy, darling, I must say I'm quite saddened by this abrupt change of plan. Things just aren't the same without you. You better not stay long, you know the boys can't survive without you." Narcissa said.
Nott was away he didn't even have it in him to scowl and sulk a bit from envy that Nott was getting some action in his job!
indeed inferior to Theo Nott." Draco finished with a warm smile, that most likely was for Nott but maybe, just maybe—Harry could hope—for him too.
-"Sure. I'll think about it. Good night." Draco said. He didn't think Granger or Weaselbee noted his sudden bout of crazy. They didn't truly know him. To the untrained eye, the eye of anyone but his immediate friends and family, Draco was as put-together as always. Unless of course he started crying, everyone would obviously know then. Fuck. Potter now knows too. So what? Draco thought. Astoria was dead and nothing fucking mattered.
-"She's gone now and I'm all his, and Theo, he doesn't care about you or anyone as long as it's his bed I sleep in at night—"
, to see him like that. So Blaise, had dropped his eyes for self-preservation's sake. He'd dropped his eyes so he wouldn't crumble like an ancient, barely held-together structure. He had people to Floo and break the news to, transportation arrangements to make. He needed to take charge and get them to England.
Harry's scanning of his surroundings had only lasted a minute. But when they all seemed unwilling to break eye-contact with Harry like they were all in a stubborn staring-contest, Harry figured he wouldn't either. They all glared at each other through Draco's squeal of delight at the sight of his son, through Scorpius's 'DADDYYYY!' and their running towards each other, meeting halfway and hugging happily, through Draco's cooing and crooning at how adorable Scorpius looked in his onesie—until Scorpius spotted Harry and ran over to greet him, so Harry had to drop the eye-contact to the Slytherins' triumph.
Harry used his wand and cast a glamour that would hide that he'd just bawled his eyes out and opened the door, stepped out only to collide with Ron that was apparently still there, waiting to make sure Harry did as he was told. People were everywhere, so Ron pretended to hug Harry to be able to furiously whisper "You don't get to make my sister or anyone worry about you. Get your shit together and don't fuck up!"
-"Meet me in the atrium at five. Pick the farthest fireplace from the elevators and wait for me there."
mother. It was true, in part, for any mention of Astoria hurt, but everything hurt these days anyways. Every step taken, breath inhaled, succulent food eaten, day lived. What pained Draco more was that he was weak and consequently hurting his son. What pained Draco more was the fact that Scorpius had seen him—would probably continue to see him hurt and sad. What pained Draco, what was worse, was that Scorpius would probably be thinking that if
Hours or years later, Theo couldn't be sure, Pansy and Blaise burst in. They stopped by the bed, on the other side of Draco. At the sight of his vacant countenance, Pansy started shaking, she swayed where she stood, Blaise absently steadied her and pulled her to his side, he wasn't looking at her, no one could take their eyes away from Draco. What was left of Draco. Which was nothing, nothing at all. Draco Malfoy was seemingly dead. Breathing, yet by all means and accounts he was dead.
They were standing so close, shoulders and thighs touching, faces mere millimeters apart, and Harry was so happy. Draco was safe and not doing anything questionable. And he was right here with Harry. It was their first time ever going out together. Harry was so joyful and excited he feared he'd burst. He grinned and waved the bartender over.
Astoria remained able to stand on her feet until the very end. She'd been weak, thin and tired, unable to keep down food, forgetting things, constantly lying down, but alive still, until she no longer was. So full of bitterness, hate, anger, love.
Harry disapparated right fucking then. Before what he said sunk in. Unwilling to have his last memory of their faces ruined by hatred or disgust.
-"It's raining! For fudge's sake. And how the fudge did speaking of unicorns make you think of the weather?!" Draco continued.
. You said they were slaving away, that they were in dire need of my expertise. That the world depended upon me. You said it was a life and death thing, you—"
relief, at that particular instant, he'd have given everything up for relief. For Draco Lucius Malfoy. Except, Draco didn't love him, he never will. There was no relief to be found. Harry was eternally condemned. When had this begun? Could it have been avoided? Had there been a different path Harry could have taken? Could Harry have been spared this cruel, soul-obliterating longing? Merlin, Merlin, Salazar and Godric, Harry loved him so much - his heart couldn't take it anymore. why?
The twisted lump lodged in his throat remained, making it more difficult and painful to breathe. Why? Why? Why, him?
Draco didn't really marvel at how Theo could love him, how much he wholeheartedly loved him, he knew other people did, even their friends and family, for other than when it came to Draco, Theo seemed incapable of love. Heartless. But for Draco, what they had was natural, the realization that he was in love with Theo didn't come as a surprise to fourteen-year-old Draco, he didn't try to fight it or deny it, have an existential and sexual crisis because Théo was a boy. No. it was just how things were, had always been, and always will be. They loved each other intrinsically, so why would being
He turned to Harry then, regarded him with a bored expression of indifference, "See you at five, Potter."
-"What Theo is too emotionally-lacking to say is - we don't want to see Draco sad if we can help it. And what Narcissa said is true. You're too stupid to premeditate such a thing." Pansy said.
. Harry had laughed it off but secretly admitted he did. But nothing in the history of everything could have prepared him for the onslaught of protective impulses he was experiencing
, and sobbed silently. He hated himself, hated Ginny, hated Ron, he had no room for guilt or self-recrimination, though he
-"I'm sure you've seen the news about the pregnancy. I thought I could stay away. I thought I could leave Draco." Harry said as Nott cast a Muffliato charm around him. Harry frowned in confusion but couldn't stop talking. "I couldn't stay away. I told them everything today. I left her. I left my unborn child." Harry continued as Nott rolled his sleeves.
He went with bowing down and kissing it. Which, by the look on Narcissa's face was not what she'd had in mind. Harry's cheeks flamed red, and she smiled. A close-lipped small smile, but a smile nonetheless. Harry beamed at her. Okey. That was good. Narcissa didn't hate him.
The next day Harry sat up in bed, rubbing his chest in a fruitless attempt to lessen the heartache. He hadn't slept a wink all night.
Eyes red, eyebrows furrowed, lower lip trapped between his teeth, so as not to be loud, shaking and gasping sporadically, Malfoy wept. He brought a hand to his mouth and bit on it,
Harry sighed again and opened his eyes, staring into Draco's silvery-grey. Draco's face was unguarded. He seemed sad, vulnerable, Harry wondered if it was an act, except he'd seen Draco's pain and decided maybe he was being genuine.
Her grave stood before Draco, the headstone, impeccable, black marble, polished within an inch of its life, upon it, using real silver, was engraved the epitaph: Her name and last name, along with her birth-year and death-year.
-"Stay away from my son. You look like you've just had a crying-session from relief after being rescued from a coal reserve."
-"You're as stupid as you are ugly, Potter. Drop the act. Theo isn't happy. How do you feel about more permanent scarring that might or might not—although I'm leaning towards might, lead to your death?"
Harry immediately loosened his hold and pulled away a bit, his hands on Draco's shoulders, he couldn't not touch him.
-"Close your mouth, Draco, darling, it's unbecoming. Plus, It makes you look more like an albino ape than usual." Pansy drawled.
A swarm of butterflies erupted in Harry's being. He involuntarily moved to meet him in the middle. Draco smiled at him, that soft, little smile with a hint of fondness in it.
. And in a way, there was something between them, not a simple string, an unbreakable bond, something more powerful -
anguish and sorrow. He seemed in acute pain, but he wasn't clutching at any particular limb. He was just sitting there looking lost and in
-"So, did you find a movie where Jack doesn't horrifically perish in the end at the hands of women named after flowers?"
Draco smiled, "I know." Harry deepened the kiss, and with it promised to love and cherish Draco until Harry's dying breath.
-"This was not how I was planning for my day to go," He sighed. "Well, I was going to spend the entire day with you anyways, so, I guess whatever, right? Lets move to the living room at least. This can't be comfortable."
Harry scoffed, he didn't even have a crush on Malfoy. Parkinson claimed he does, but what the bloody fuck does Parkinson know?
-"Awwwwww, Potter. You're adorable." Draco said, chuckling because he was an asshole. For a moment, Harry wondered if he really fancied him—but Draco's laugh, even if it was deriding and at Harry's expense, was like enthralling music to his ears.
-"This is why I always refuse to be seen with you in public. Your behaviors are utterly unbecoming for a highly-reputable Lady of Leisure such as myself. You are a stain upon my social life. You embarrass me greatly. Thank Merlin we're just in the company of halfwits and losers."
Harry was most certainly not going to continue the waving since it clearly hadn't worked and he'd be damned if he was going to uncreepily wait to coincide with Draco's arrival. That could take DAYS! So he waited around for him to come out. Draco didn't have a specific time he usually came in, Zabini was always with him, though, and sometimes they were late. So to be safe Harry was early and waiting. A few minutes later Draco stepped out of the farthest fireplace from Harry. Fuck. Harry ran and stopped in front of him.
-"I live to serve." Theo breathed before resuming their quite passionate and unexpected make out session.
-"Fucking hell. Ginny decorated it. We're not all the sole heir of The Malfoy, Black and Lestrange fortunes combined, Draco."
Draco had to hide, wait and recompose himself, wipe away the distress from his face; put on a big, fake smile. To protect Scorpius, just like Scorpius was doing for
-"Are you sure it's been a month? I don't look bad. Just as devilishly handsome as always." He smirked at Theo.
So he sat down comfortably, or as comfortably as one can on the hard, dirty, cold floor by Draco's feet and intertwined his fingers with Draco's and kept rambling about how he only saw Ron, who was working at George's Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes, every other Saturday dinner-night. And how he'd been missing Sunday-lunch, because of Molly and Ginny. And how he frankly begrudged Ginny a bit, out of
-"Why, Hello, there. This is certainly a delightful surprise. You've probably just made everyone's week. Everyone's bored out of their minds. Nothing exciting much happens around here. Anywhere actually. My husband Ronald had quit the aurors because they only got called to help kneazles down from trees." Granger said, beaming at Scorpius who was excitedly bouncing in Blaise's arms and waving at everyone - everyone, in every single cubicle around them was gleefully waving back.
What if the agony of the moment of severance never faded? And what if the same limb was cut off time after time? What if acute pain was relived over and over again? Can one live for the pain-blotting darkness of unconsciousness that comes after unbearable pain? What kind of life would that be? Pain or darkness. Pain
Draco's strength vanished with those last words, he looked up at his sleeping son with a combination of pure, raw, anguish and terror, he couldn't be there for Scorpius. Not yet, his vision dimmed, the pain in his heart unbearably intensified, he felt a violent tremor shake his body and he started to fall, fall, fall—strong arms wrapped around him. And Théo's whisper was the last thing he registered before consciousness deserted him.
Blaise and Millie left. Greg took Scorpius to inspect the playroom that was right across from Draco's office, the door was made out of glass, so Draco could check up on the children from his own office.
When he was in Draco's hallway, already smiling brightly in happy anticipation, he heard loud crying. A child crying, it seemed to come from the children's room. As Harry neared it, he drew to a halt, and watched as both Draco and Hermione darted across the hallway towards the children. Harry right behind them.
. He laughed a little at that, because Astoria was like a hyperactive child, always jumping from one task to the other and dancing in-between. She'd hate to rest eternally. That'd be Hell to her. Except now she was. So, they were both in different Hells, but Hell all-the-same. Or maybe the same kind of Hell, for Draco knew beyond a doubt that being separated from him and Scorpius would destroy her more than boredom and sitting-still ever could.
-"You take that right back! Every color is my color. Theo, tell her to take it back!" Draco demanded.
. The girl with no crooked canine, looked sad and worried. She was kind, Draco distantly acknowledged. She hadn't seemed uncomfortable with his display of raw emotion, hadn't awkwardly offered her excuses and hurried away. She
-"Yaaaaay!" Harry said, dryly. And then he remembered that they were soon-to-be-probably-maybe-boyfriends and he jumped around the bedroom, doing a little victory-dance, and hugged Draco tightly while, Draco laughed at him and petted his hair patronizingly, probably thinking Harry had finally renounced his old ways of dressing like a homeless, elderly man and was happy to finally step into the right path of up-scale fashion and pretentiousness alongside Draco. Well, he
Maybe. Maybe. Maybe. Maybe. Maybe—She was dead. Dead. Dead. Dead. Gone. Forever. Why? Why? Why? Why?
When she'd went to sleep that night, Harry had barely made it to the bathroom and locked it when he'd had his very first panic attack.
What about Astoria? Wasn't he supposed to be grieving her? Didn't he say she was irreplaceable? Or was it just Harry he didn't want? Why? Why not Harry?
There was something weighting down Harry, a sense of unease and foreboding building up rapidly in his chest. There was a breaking point to which Harry was hazardously standing close, yet he didn't know what was threatening to break, nevertheless it couldn't possibly matter more than Draco.
-"Why, yes, of course I would want to relish in how deeply my satirical chef d'œuvre wounded Potter." She said.
At that moment a disheveled Theo and Blaise entered, shared a look that was more of a death glare and raced to the now vacated chaise-lounge.
-"Looks like Draco tried to fix you up a bit, make you look presentable. To no avail, I might add." Zabini said.
that his vision blurred and his breath caught in his throat. He doubled over and braced his hands on his knees and panted. Oh, Merlin. This was actually happening!
The first thing he heard when he entered the cafeteria was a child giggling. Two children. Rose. He smiled. She was laughing at something the other child said. A familiar child, with platinum-blond hair and pale, grey eyes. Scorpius Malfoy who was sitting on none other than Draco owl-aggressor Malfoy's lap. Harry snarled. Harry had felt wretched after he'd stupidly told Hermione of his brief interaction with Malfoy. She'd furiously scolded him for his 'insensitive and immature behavior.'
They strolled around looking for Blaise and Pansy since it was nearly countdown-time, only to find Blaise staggeringly conversing with none other than Granger and the Weasel. Potter was nowhere to be seen.
-"Yes. We're not friends, Potter, what the fuck do you want?" Draco said, flatly. He didn't even have the energy to manage a sneer.
Harry was sure Draco wasn't originally planning on leaving and that he only said that to avoid Harry. Great. Now, Harry had given him the opportunity to go on a date with Nott.
A few hours later, found Draco kneeling on the bed, sobbing and throwing pillows left and right, Harry ducking down to avoid being hit, his hands in the air as a sign of peace and surrender. But Draco wasn't having any of that and screeched for his wand that Harry'd had the presence of mind of picking up from the nightstand before he swiftly moved out of Draco's reach to save his life.
-"Daddy. . .R-R-Rose say maman is dead. . .she, she—say I never see her again. Hermione est toujours avec Rose, quand est-ce que j-je vais voir ma maman à moi? Hmm? Papa!" Scorpius said between sobs.
-"I think I should get a car too. They're so aesthetically appealing. I don't know how to drive, though. Do you know how to? No? Idiot. What's even the point of keeping you around, Potter."
-"I thought you'd pitied me. I hate pity. I hate it. Especially after everything father had to do to exonerate us. After the trials, everyone knew everything there was to know about us, and I hated it. You know how I am, always been prideful, arrogant, self-aware, someone my fellow housemates looked up to—even if the cows I've for close friends didn't—To have strangers, know of my pain, my fears, my weaknesses, to feel sorry for me—I couldn't bear it then, I still can't now."
-"Let's go to Italy. You, me and Scorpius. And then travel through all wizarding-Europe from there. There's so much to see—"
-"Draco just kiss him and stop trying to act like you didn't make me sleep on the couch because I hurt him."
This was too much for Harry to even consider watching. Hermione was his friend, a close one at that. He'd as soon as cut his own dick off than if he were to watch his best friend get it on with a Slytherin girl.
Harry could've torn his eyes away the moment Malfoy looked up. In fact he should've just pretended to be looking at Parvati.
Harry physically felt Malfoy's breath stutter under his lips, his hips moving erradically under Harry's grasp.
His heart was beating rapidly while they held their stares. Apparently enough time passed with the both of them in a trance, that it was Harry's turn again.
"As funny as it would be to walk into class virtually unscathed and rather happy to see Slughorns troubled face, Id like to be alone with you for a while longer and preferably someplace more private. Unless we risk getting another week of detention?" Draco answered, circling his hips against Harry's.
Malfoy was surrounded by his group of followers, Pansy whispering in his ear and Blaise leaning in on the blonds other side to hear.
And across from Seamus and Dean, Lavender Brown and Theodore Nott were enthusiastically chatting about whatever.
For some reason Draco has yet to decipher, the Chosen One preferred his company on this Saturday afternoon outing.
Harry nibbled his bottom lip briefly, chuckling as he carded his fingers through Draco's shorter hairs.
Draco tuned out the professor as Harry kicked him under the table. Draco hissed and looked to Harry on his right.
Pansy had begun whispering into Hermione's ear, and from the way Hermione was clinging onto the shoulders beneath her and the tightening of her shirt from behind, Pansy was moving her hands around under Hermione's shirt.
Sometime in the process of the war, Draco smothered his inner demons and came out to mother about being gay and infatuated with the one and only Boy Who Lived.
No one had noticed their interactions, and thankfully Harry grabbed the parchment from in front of Draco and asked once again,
Harry felt his stomach clench with nerves, but if Hermione could handle being publicly pleasured, then Harry would give it a shot too. With his Griffindor bravery, Harry calmly stood, made his way across the circle and stopped in front of Malfoy.
Draco chanced a glance over at Harry, unsure if this was such a good idea. Sure, they were both uninterested in Potions at the moment. Draco having already learned, made, and probably used whatever potion Slughorn was writing on the board. Draco was pretty sure Harry just wanted to slack off. A laid back smile really did prove that. Draco let his eyes linger on Harry's sharp jawline...
The redness from before was full blown across Malfoy's cheeks, the tips of his ears and down his neck, disapearing under his shirt. It stirred something inside of Harry, compelling him to make a bruising mess of the pale expanse of skin.
He was amused to find Harry's focus on him had never wavered, as he felt eyes boring into him and connected their staring contest again.
By the middle of the first term, Draco and Harry were content to nod at eachother in passing though the hallways and occasionally partnering in their shared classes.
H: Ok. Oh and be careful of Filch. He has been giving eighth years trouble for being out past curfew. Even as we don't have one per McGonagalls rules.
Draco sat up, feeling a poke to his inner thigh. He smirked at the knowledge of turning Harry on, but got to undoing the many buttons of his robes. Each clasp undone made Harry seem hungrier and hungrier as his gaze soaked up every inch revealed. Even as it was just his robes and not the white button up beneath them, Draco felt worshipped, being looked at like Harry was then.
"Ya know I can't help but love McGonagall," Harry pulled Draco against him with their clasped hands. "Because she wouldn't make us serve more than a month."
Harry noticed all this suddenly from across the room, his figure, not quite lanky, was splayed on the couch his legs apart in front of him and his head in his hands.
He took Draco's bottom lip into his mouth running his tongue over it. Draco whimpered almost silently and his mouth parted for Harry.
He had expected to be alone, however, Draco Malfoy was at a locker looking as if he had just finished getting ready to get out there.
"Now everyone sit in a circle in the middle of the room!" Pansy yelled before hopping off the couch and holding a hand out for Hermione to grasp, helping her down.
He strode to Hermione cautiously, hesitant to interrupt whatever humourous conversation the three were having.
"I dare you to..." Pansy leaned into Hermione, probably whispering a suggestion. "Flash the person you like most in the room."
Harry glanced around the circle at the people who curiously looked over to Draco. He would have been embarrassed for causing the interruption, but he was invisible in his dream.
Harry smirked at the realization, but was perplexed about the fact that he failed to notice anything of the sort earlier, sitting beneath Malfoy. Maybe the sheer amount of surprise just stilled his blood and hadnt allowed it to circulate until Malfoy was off of him.
Draco smirked, if he was going to do anything...suggestive, it definitely wouldn't be in front of 15 other class mates. But with the look on Harry's face, clouded with something similar to lust, Draco felt sooo tempted.
His eyes were intriguingly watching as the two made out, until Pansy was pulling Hermiones underwear off from under her skirt. By then, again he was uncomfortable watching one of his friends get down with their significant other. Harry settled with branding a smirk on his lips and laying backwards laughing for some reason.
What was that??? He asked himself, tossing his broom onto the bench in the locker room and ripping off the equipment stuffing it into the locker.
Draco leaned across the table, fisting Harry's cloak collar and pulling him the rest of the way to his lips.
Draco finally recognized that the only person it could actually be, was Harry. Draco caught Harry's concerned focus on him, and smiled tenderly.
This had swirled around his head in mere seconds before he chose to jump back into reality. Harry wanted to ask Malfoy the question, but he didnt want to be repetitive and unfair to everyone else around the circle.
Harry got close enough to see the specks of dark grey littered in Draco's eyes on top of the lighter silver grayish color.
From his robe pocket he pulled a shining golden snitch. He let it fly between his fingers for a second, holding his gaze as he let it go.
That blew Harry off the edge. He plunged into the feeling of pleasure with a force he didn't know could be awoken within him.
Harry didn't know most of the others now paired from different houses, but he knew that the house rivalries didn't stop most of the older couples getting together.
Harry cleared his throat across the table and Draco let himself feel the self-satisfied smirk take over.
"Er..well you can't say much either, and your not as observant as you might like to be! I've been trying to get you alone for months!"
No, he definatly needed to drink. There was no way he would survive the night being crowded and squished like this,
H: I use my brain for important things. Not betting on who is going to win the Quidditch World Cup, or which broom is mathematically more efficient. I swear I heard you two using high level mathematic equations to determine the angle and velocity needed to preform some complicated twist and dive.
Every bit just as smooth and sleek as he was in the past. Instead of a sneer in place on his features as Harry was expecting, a playful smirk made his insides clench.
His mother was supportive, no matter who he fancied. It allowed Draco to release a sort of breath he knew he had always been holding. Along with this breath of fresh air, Draco sought out the truth of exactly what he wanted out of returning to Hogwarts for his extra year.
Draco passed the parchment back to Harry. It took maybe a few seconds until the parchment was sliding back over his desk.
Its not everyday one finds himself strolling down the snow covered cobblestone walkways of Hogsmead with Harry Potter. Hand twitching to extend a mere few inches to intertwine their fingers.
Then Seamus dared Blaise to strip from his shirt. Blaise completed it without hesitation or complication.
Draco rest his forehead against Harry's, just staring. He pecked Harry on the lips, once, twice, three times, before smiling and leaning away.
After the war, not everything was immediately fine and dandy. Draco threw a few slurs and Harry a few biting insults, until they both realized the absurdity of continuing their rivalry.
Draco's eyes trailed from Harry's, lingering to show him his signature smirk, before watching his hand work underneath his pants.
Draco risked a surprised glance at Harry, who's attention was focused on the ground. A victorious smile lay placed on his gorgeous lips. Draco sensed McGonagall's glare, and predictably she was eyeing the two of them.
Draco was grasping at Harry's upper arm and pulling him into his lap. Just like his dream, Harry indulged. Harry's hand worked his cock and he dipped his head as Draco's hands fell to his hips.
"You look rather tense Malfoy," Harry knocked their shoulders together. Draco's heart leapt at the small contact.
What seriously trumped him, was the absence of all that anger directed at him just this morning at breakfast.
Almost halfway through Harry unintentionally let out a groan and his head tipped back. He cursed his body for reacting because he felt his pants become tighter.
Slowly, things have escalated to meaningful glances and tender stares. Studying together in the library, falling asleep next to the fireplace and each other on the sofa in the 8th year commom rooms, sitting together during breakfasts or lunches.
Harry felt overwhelmed with the desire, but this couldnt be real. He might as well indulge in his imagination before it goes away.
They crashed together, but their lips were unmoving, simply pressed together. Draco wouldn't move, not until Harry made that choice.
A sudden flutter in his stomach made him blink his attention away, caught off guard momentarily he heard the speedy buzz of the snitch somewhere near by. He snapped his sight this way and that and found the ball to be just above his right shoulder a few feet away. He made a quick grab for it, but missed.
At some point Harry caught Draco staring, and whatever he saw before Draco quickly averted his eyes, he used to decide on a dare.
Just to be clear, I dont ship Ron and Lavender, i just couldnt decide if he should like Blaise or not because hes so against slytherins maybe he wouldnt be able to accept his own feelings if he really did. SORRY to those that do ship Lavender with Ron, I dont mean to be the one to blow holes in your own ship, and IM SORRY for not putting Ron and Blaise together. I DO however feel like Ron and Hermione were the destined pair so its weird to put her with Pansy in this here story.
"Now I feel like im dreaming, say something to let me know that im not dreaming," Draco whispered against Harry's neck.
Draco chuckled. They were on a first name basis now, but even they should have a little flare to their game.
Harry couldn't help an amused laugh from escaping. A stunt like that in a game would have likely ended badly. He chased Malfoy around the pitch a few more times before the snitch darted in the suns direction and he became suddenly blinded. This had been Malfoy’s opportunity and he took it greedily, snapping his arm straight out and wrapping his fingers tightly around the snitch.
"We have all been through more than we should've had to," Hermione had a more serious tone in her voice, and she had refrained from yelling like Pansy, with no need because the room was focused intently on the pair. "And we have lost those we love to the war, but tonight has been a step in the right direction towards putting everything behind us. To correctly bring us all together, we think its only fair everyone gets to know each other through a few games!"
But all in all that was impossible. Malfoy was acting similarly, laughing in front of him in Potions when he made a snide remark about the professor to Ron, or belting out histerically when Harry had gotten dirt rained on him in Herbology by an out of control plant, or just smirking at him from across whatever room they found themselves in together.
Only he didnt whisper it to himself apparently. Draco's eyes bulged and he spun his head around looking for something.
Draco was running down the hall before he had the chance to fix his precious hair. He was going to be late for potions if he didn't book it to the classroom, to a waiting eye full of Harry Potter.
Draco similarly spoke Harry's name, but it was a quiet whisper followed by a shutter underneath Harry's body.
The hot water calmed his thoughts and he refused to pay his problem any attention. He washed and scrubbed, before he exited he let cold water wash over him and that was that.
Harry took a while to hand the paper back, his hand coming up to tap at his cheek with his chin in his palm.
"Draco," Harry straightened Draco's neck for him and their eyes met, their faces were so close. All Draco had to do was extend his neck and they'd be kissing.
He instinctively chose the desk beside Harry towards the back of the room, where they've taken to sitting next to each other every class.
"I had a very delicious view, you're right. I just cant help myself right now. There's something about this whole situation that makes me feel like I can do anything."
Sometimes Draco's thoughts would stray from the dark and depressing side of Harry's firm exsistance in the war, and towards more...intimate things.
Harry caught the fluid movement of that certain platinum blond taking a seat between Luna and Neville.
Draco shivered at the prospect of being with Harry for *a few hours* rather than the, at most 1, he was hoping to get.
It was extremely unfortunate that Draco began thinking of kissing. With Harry, right there, waiting for him to answer.
At some point Harry closed his eyes long enough to take a quick power nap. Harry felt like he was still awake, and his mind was there with the circle of people but he was asleep. He could hear everything clearly, including Hermione's attempts at suppressing pleasured moans.
Harry made his way back over to where Ron had confronted Hermione and followed behind the red head until he sat next to him, his back against the couch nearest him. Hermione took to sitting with Pansy on one side of her and Blaise on the next across the circle.
He traced the underside of Harry's jaw with his tongue, slowly and carefully, literally tasting Harry's skin.
At least until Draco peaked his tongue past his lips and licked away the foam. Draco relished in the repeated darting of Harry's focus to Draco's lips.
"Listen, this is by far the best thing I've gotten in trouble for, and its definitely worth a whole year of detention. If you would be so generous, just let me talk and we might get out of this alive."
Draco willed himself not to reach out and grip onto Harry's thigh as he slid ever so slightly closer to Draco, making their knees bump.
Draco was fascinated by the rooms decor, different from the way Dumbledore kept it, but still invoking a strong sense of wonder in the depths of Draco's mind.
For reasons unknown, his pulse began racing and he felt the beginning of the adrenaline flying through his veins.
He has known Parvati all 7 years of being at Hogwarts. It would have been like staring at a family member.
Deciding that this was a game so instrumental in their progress through the semester towards each other, a win would do Malfoy good. He wasn’t just going to hand it to him though, he could have a little fun in doing so.
Neville looked a little uncomfortable, but seemed to shake it off when Malfoy started talking to Luna.
H: Because I think its sweet that he cant do it himself and I don’t want to shut down a little girls hopes.
Harry didn't dare bring his attention to anyone in the room, his eyes found an interesting detail on the ceiling, and that was where he kept his eyes for the remainder of whatever was happening.
Harry chuckled at that and Draco tried to hide his smirk behind the palm of his hand hoisted up on the table.
Harry and Ron watched Hermione stomp away, having not even touched her food. Ron grabbed a napkin and wrapped one of Hermiones favorite desserts within it, muttering something about her being hungry later.
Making Harry flick Draco on the leg. The small contact made Dracos focus waver, but he shook it off and leaned over the parchment so Harry couldn't see. He heard a small chortle come from beside him.
Draco flicked his eyes around the room, making sure that the rest of the students were still preoccupied with the lesson.
How did Malfoy get past him? He couldn’t have been too far behind. Or he might have been caught too.
Draco leaned against cold stone, the vibrant green of Harry's eyes burned into the insides of his screwed shut eyelids.
Apparently Harry didn't like his smug look, deciding to fist Draco's collar and attack Draco's very exposed and pale neck.
Malfoy was leaning on his hands behind him, radiating normalcy, but Harry could feel the flex in Draco's thighs as Harry straightened his posture.
He watched Ron, very uncomfortably, stuffing his hands in his lap. Dean and Seamus were watching closely, but they looked less aroused than fascinated. Neville was trying to ignore the scene by chatting with Luna. Harrys mind caught up to him and wondered why Luna was even here. She was a year younger than them, in Ginny's year actually. Harry only came to conclude that Luna just had her ways.
Draco was slightly panicking, he didn't want to lie and say Pansy, no matter how revolting, but coming out to Potter of all people?
He felt like he should be disgusted, but the fact that it was Harry, made it far from disgusting at least in the moment.
With a sigh, and a determination he hadn’t seen coming, he strode to the opposite wall of lockers Malfoy occupied and started dressing.
Harry felt no compulsion to stick around, in any case adding to the amount of confusing feelings however, he was feeling somewhat guilty.
His equal in quidditch. Maybe even his superior to the sport. Sure he had won every house match that they played, but thats hardly a fair evaluation of his own skill. There are so many different factors at play in a team.
None-the-less, Harry pulled himself out for Draco. Harry's focus remained solely on Draco's facial features. Draco had his bottom lip harshly between his teeth. His pupils were blown as he watched Harry.
After a couple minutes of observing from some kind of astral plane, he consciously got up, but his body remained asleep on the ground with a small smile resting on his lips.
Draco was the first to let out a relieved sigh and a small chuckle. He opened his eyes to meet the piercing emerald staring back at him.
Harry honestly wasnt going to admit to himself that Malfoy was never evil. The git could basically be seen basking in attention and fake power during their time at Hogwarts before the war.
Harry slumped to the floor, sitting on his heels. His eyes locked with Draco's whose shone with hunger and something else Harry couldn't quite place.
Harry sighed, letting his eyes linger on Pansy's for a second, before flicking to Malfoy's. Finally the other was looking up, and they locked gazes, even while Harry asked Malfoy the question, "Truth or Dare, Draco?" He watched as a flicker of somekind washed over Malfoy's expression. The use of the others first name was proving to rattle a nerve within Malfoy and Harry himself.
"Well, you guys went longer than 3 minutes by the way, but moving on! Potter your turn." As Harry turned to glare at Pansy, he couldn't find it in him to actually be mad at her. He was thankful if anything. He could only really be mad that she didn't stop things at the 3 minute mark before his arousal got too noticable.
Tom sighed, rummaged around his side of the bar and produced a copy of the Daily Prophet. He pushed it towards Harry and raised his eyebrows like Harry owed him fuckall.
-"Yes, I suppose I knew they hated me, the feeling is mutual, but they live with you? Parkinson, Goyle and Zabini?" Harry unfortunately knew Nott was not only staying with Draco, but sleeping in his
-"Why, Draco, if I didn't know any better I'd think you're trying to console me." Harry joked. Although it wasn't really a joke and he was suddenly overwhelmed with dread and in equal measures, hope.
Hadn't Draco Malfoy deliberately lied to his deranged, faithful to the cause, aunt Bellatrix's face, telling her, he couldn't be sure of the identity of the boy that was clearly—for someone who'd known him for years—Harry Potter? Potter and his friends had escaped -Draco, his mother and father were tortured.
? Had you been forced to arrange a way for Death-Eaters to infiltrate Hogwarts under its own Headmaster's nose, under Albus Dumbledore's nose? Had you been forced to sit down at the dinner table where you've celebrated birthdays, had dinner parties, dined with friends, drank tea with your mother, to watch Nagini, a serpent, The Dark Lord's serpent, feast on corpses of people you know and had been made to torture, hoping it wouldn't be your mother next, your father, your friend,
Draco started to laugh, hysterically, his whole body shook with laughter, he stopped resisting Harry's hold and collapsed backward against the dingy wall behind him. Laughing.
-"It's okey, your boyfriend's rich. Move in with me—and fuck it, let's all quit, now. Father and Mother are actually delighted you fucked the weasels over, so you'll fit back in just fine." Draco said.
Harry sat there, clutching at his heart and weeping, mourning the loss of what might have been but never,
Harry's body temperature soared dangerously high; for days he kept the curtains closed, unable to witness life outside going-on as usual when his fucking world had crumbled; he felt continuously nauseous, an awful, queasy feeling in his stomach that made him want to vomit all-day, everyday.
Everyone was staring at them - Hermione, Rose, Scorpius, some of their coworkers, including the pink lady.
When he was confident Draco would have secured his son in the playroom and sat on his desk to ponder how the fuck was this his life now (welcome to the club), Harry raced to the nearest elevator.
knew I was in over my head. I was sixteen for Salazar's sake! But you still didn't think twice about hurting me. Because that's who you fucking are -
real happiness had felt like, had made him act. Everyday, unfailingly Harry would mourn its loss until he'd collapse and scream silently into his fists. Kreacher would show up every time, and help Harry regain some semblance of sanity by healing his bitten and bloody hands, glamouring his constantly puffy and gritty eyes, bringing him a change of clothes, forcefully feeding him mysterious potions that made him feel better enough, lucid enough to
Panting, shaking with fear and anxiety, Harry caught up with Draco, grabbed his shoulder, spinning him around to face him.
Harry had found Draco conversing with some old lady in a cubicle, he thought Hermione might've introduced him to her once upon a time when they were fresh out of war, the poor woman didn't seem very sane now as opposed to back then, wearing a huge, pink quilt around her shoulders, it was a cold end of January but still. . . Anyways, Draco Malfoy had seemed to be enjoying the old woman's meanderings since he didn't acknowledge Harry when he was standing clearly in his view and waiting patiently for Draco to wrap up his conversation and give Harry a minute or a few hours with him. Harry had waited a bit more and blurted out a 'Hello', the pink woman Draco'd been conversing with had Hello-ed him back. Whereupon Malfoy the prick had smoothly excused himself, saying he'd leave them to it, sounding oh-so-very polite and considerate. The woman had smiled apologetically to Draco, patted his hand kindly and turned expectantly to Harry. Harry had mumbled something under his breath and ran the opposite way.
He swayed, and shuffled to stand directly over Draco. Draco stared at him unblinking, unapologetic, he'd said his truth, he'd meant every word. Harry dropped to his knees in front of Draco and rested his forehead on Draco's knee.
-"A muggle club, really?!" Harry said, eyebrows nearly reaching his hairline from surprise. So this was it? He'd been fearing the worst. Draco had been acting ominously suspicious.
-"Well, yes, I suppose. But I haven't seen her since last year's Christmas! Invite her over, at once. Or I shall just do it myself."
You don't move on from shit like that. It lives on, unprocessed, a deadly venom, an untamable beast, thinly-veiled, locked away yet invading everywhere inside you. While from the outside you smile and laugh it off, because while the sun killed Icarus, the moon would have kept him locked away. Neither was a faith better than the other. Draco, not unlike Icarus, was
He instinctively turned to Hermione because she must know something, she always knew everything, she was always there—only to see what he was feeling reflected in her eyes.
Flabbergasted. Confused. Harry stared at the both of them. They smiled warmly at each other, exchanged pleasantries, Draco didn't introduce Harry, she didn't ask. They seemed to only have eyes for each other. Draco. Draco was gazing lovingly at her. Her. Not at Harry. Never at Harry. He was staring at her in enthralled awe and ardent wonder. Expressions Harry had never seen on Draco's beautiful face before, let alone directed at him. He seemed so enraptured by her, like she was all he could see. Like the world had stopped existing or mattering. Like Harry had stopped existing and mattering. They were wrapped up in each other's gazes and words. Harry felt excluded, insignificant, unimportant. He was but a mere by-stander, watching from the outside. Realization dawned on Harry, and tendrils of poisonous jealousy sprouted inside him, curling around his heart and squeezing, restricting his heart's beating, draining the blood from its four chambers, draining the life out of him. Harry's vision blurred. He swayed where he stood and clutched at the bar stool next to him, knuckles white from the tightness of his grip.
Practically everyone who knew Harry Potter and mainly Ronald Weasley had pointed out to Harry, not so admiringly in Ron's case, that he had a chronic
, because why should he feel guilty? It's not like he had any say in his feelings. It's not like he'd wanted any of this, or deliberately trapped himself in this loveless, bleak life.
—because a variety of those answers were the only answers acceptable, Draco turned to him and frowned. Harry didn't know what his face was doing but he sure as fuck knew he was panicking. Like really, really, full-on short-breathing, heart pounding fast, sweating and considering fleeing far, just far, far, far away from the prospect of facing not only Lucius Malfoy but the entire Slytherin Gang of Evil and Condescension.
-"Nice to see you haven't changed Malfoy." He paused and stared in Scorpius's direction. "Is that your son?"
The Chaise-lounge was too small for the both of them to lie across it side by side. So, Theo did the reasonable thing and elbowed Blaise off it. Blaise fell down, colliding into Pansy who'd been in a diligent glaring match with Draco.
-"Yes, Salazar! Do you remember how he pitched a fit when that picture of Potter and Granger came out on The Daily Prophet? Fucking hell! He'd always been a nuisance but that was exactly the time I started contemplating turning his hair permanently blue, thank Merlin he quickly realized he wanted Theo instead—" Pansy said.
Three weeks after Harry Potter had ruined someone's life in a garden and had his own life ruined by someone else in another garden, Harry Potter was minding his own business, pretending that no one was sneering at him, that he wasn't hanging by a thread and that his boss wasn't about to fire him any day now for bringing shame on an already disgraceful department, when Ron Weasley shoved him against the wall of the soon-to-be-busy-and-he-needs-to-fuck-off-before-Nott-catches-him-still-lurking-around cafeteria. (Harry had decided he didn't have much time to live anyways and might as well try the cafeteria's ghastly food). Harry rolled his eyes. He was genuinely sorry for everything he'd done, but these days, he was honestly feeling like an elderly lady who'd lost everyone she cared about, had a foot in the grave and straight-up ran out of fucks to give.
It never will. This is my life. But now that he's in pain. Now, I know the true meaning of Draco's pain being my own. Being pained
-"Harry! What are you doing there? I heard you came earlier, why didn't you come see me? Did you need something?" Hermione said.
Harry felt sick to his stomach, walking towards The Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures that Monday morning to spend the day with Draco, knowing he'd make him feel better and his mere proximity would loosen up the knot of guilt and self-loathing in Harry's belly.
So, he'd made his way towards Malfoy promising himself not to start a duel in the middle of the party—since Hermione was just somewhere around the atrium, and he didn't particularly fancy being the recipient of her threateningly disapproving glares—and trying to convince himself that he wasn't interested in talking to Malfoy in the slightest but was simply doing his duty as an auror and sizing up a person of interest.
Scorpius seemed to like Rose from the way he promised to get her a similar unicorn horn to his own. She beamed brightly at him, and blushed. Granger turned to Draco from her spot leaning against the door frame and winked.
Draco didn't even have the energy to feel annoyed or whatever he'd have felt if Astoria wasn't dead and he wasn't pathetically weary and feeling heavy and miserable.
-"Aren't The Malfoys one of the wealthiest families in Wizarding England, why are your chairs so terribly uncomfortable?" Harry asked in a vain effort to distract himself and ignore his overwhelming and imperiling thoughts, his voice cracked and wavered.
Draco dropped to his knees in front of him and intertwined his long slender fingers with Théo's. Silent tears falling endlessly.
Harry held Draco tighter to him. He was with Harry now. He wasn't with Nott or Astoria but with Harry. Harry refused to think about anything else.
He clutched Harry's head and smashed his knee-cap against it. Burning pain erupted from the point of contact. Harry's vision wavered dangerously, he collapsed down on the floor, felt blood streaming down from his nostrils, coughed and blood splattered the creamy-colored carpet. Crimson dots everywhere. He lay there watching them, breathing shallowly. Unable to move.
Fat tears raced down Scorpius's pink cheeks. He was wailing, screaming for his mother at the top of his lungs.
Presently he was silently seething at the sight before him. Malfoy. Malfoy in his fucking place of business. An admittedly tedious place of business but a place of business nonetheless.
Draco had only taken a few steps when Theodore Nott appeared, racing almost inhumanly fast towards them, he jumped those final meters between them and wrapped his arms around Draco and Scorpius.
-"You w-want to help? b-bring her back. Bring Astoria back...bring her back...Astoria. Astoria...bring her back..."
-"You did no such thing. The Death Stick betrayed him. Dumbledore and my wife did the rest." Lucius said.
Théo dropped down next to them, wrapped his own arms around the both of them and kissed Draco's head.
-"Salazar, Theo! Don't hold back on my account. Im a big boy, I can take the truth. Don't sugar-coat anything, darling."
Draco pushed away from him when Harry's hold only tightened around him. He stood up. Harry sat up and instantly felt cold all over, and not because of the elements.
She'd come home last night, planning it as a pleasant surprise to Harry. He'd been struck with a combination of guilt, anger, shame and sadness.
Draco flicked his eyes to Harry's face, found Harry already watching him and smiled affectionately at him, he then wriggled the few centimeters between them and lay his head on Harry's chest. Harry's heart thrashed inside of him at a fantastic rate of speed, he was sure it was annoying Draco whose head was directly above it, but Draco didn't move away and merely draped an arm around Harry's belly.
-"Why, yes. Theo is a perfectly respectable, wealthy, pureblooded English gentleman. I've a son already to continue the Malfoy—"
Draco's room, which he learned was actually Scorpius's room, was colorful and welcoming. Fit for a child. The king-sized bed was huge enough for his Dad too,
He stood over him. Malfoy was seated with his son in his lap, Rose in the next seat to his left, Hermione in the seat next to her and Blaise Zabini, Millicent Bulstrode on his other side.
She huffed and stormed away to do whatever it was she did to get her hands on valuable intel that ruined lives. The officials at the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures were in
Harry Potter didn't know what to think anymore. Except He actually did. He'd thought about those things before, what ifs, he'd had his regrets, but Harry didn't indulge in those. He couldn't afford uncertainties. He'd been raised like 'a pig for slaughter' he was an auror. He was married to Ginny Weasley. That's all he knew. He was safe and content if not warm and happy. Harry couldn't risk losing it all, treading in the unknown. Unknowns and uncertainties were scary, they were avoided and locked away at all costs. Some Gryffindor he was. Then again wasn't he almost sorted into Slytherin? Merlin's beard! He'd begged the hat to put him in Gryffindor because Hagrid who was a Gryffindor and Ron Whose entire family were Gryffindors—therefore very biased—hadn't had very nice things to say about Slytherin. Meeting Draco hadn't helped too but still...he shouldn't have condemned something he didn't understand.
A bit later, Draco Malfoy strode in, not a hair out of place. Harry probably looked mad with his robe rumpled, his trousers dirty, hair a mess, eyes wild—Nonetheless, Harry breathed a sigh of relief. He was glad Draco looked alright, but then again was he actually?
He'd been busy the first few days because the ministry hadn't probably had a proper potions master since before the war— busy cleaning up the potions laboratory that nobody used, writing down basic potions ingredients he might need, sending owls to the previous suppliers in Saint mungo's to cancel their contracts with the ministry since they were no longer needed, they'd certainly be happy about it since Saint Mungo's healers and mediwizards are actually overworked, Draco thought.
So Draco did what any grown-man of twenty-six years of age would've done in his shoes - he huffed petulantly, stood up, and while pouting angrily stormed out the dining room. Unfortunately, he was too busy concentrating on noisily stomping on the floor that he didn't see Greg. They collided together.
. You've always been hyperaware of anything concerning Draco. When all of the Slytherins taunted us you only saw Draco; when most of the Slytherins were pureblood supremacists you only suspected Draco of being the heir of Salazar; when all of the school including Ron, mocked you, didn't believe you didn't put your name in the goblet of fire, Draco's jeering riled you up the most; It was also
The fact that Harry was going to die tonight was indisputable, as for how he would - From Jealousy? Embarrassment? Murdered? The night was young.
of Draco Malfoy. But that hadn't been all, Harry had even felt a little bit disappointed, this couldn't be it after all these years of Harry obsessing over him.
As Draco's dramatic exit hadn't gone to plan, and he was fucking hungry - he sensibly regained his seat.
Harry couldn't begin to explain why this was so important to him. He didn't have words for it, just a mental picture of Draco Malfoy sobbing in his arms and saying the words
to. Nobody gives a fuck about Kingsley Shacklebolt's supposed affaire with the Holyhead Harpies' seeker, Pansy. Nor do we care about Celestina Warbeck's retirement plans." Theo added.
-"I won't ask you to change for me. I don't care—I actually do and I'll probably combust from jealousy but I love you. I'll take anything. I'm genuinely going crazy here. I
-"Shit. That's a muggle gun. He's been shot." Harry said. He should have kept his big, fat, dumb mouth shut.
Draco was wearing light-grey robes that brought out his eyes, lustrous white-blond hair cascading down his shoulders. He was daintily pale. Delicately beautiful. Otherworldly. Ethereal. Handsome—
Malfoy eyes were red and livid. He pushed himself off the wall and in two long strides he was in Harry's face, stabbing a finger against Harry's chest.
-"You know I always thought he should have been sorted into Slytherin. He was too intelligent and cunning to be a Gryffindork. I'd have liked him if he didn't treat you better than us. But in hindsight, it's understandable that he did. He'd felt bad for you.
They both trudged down the stairs. In the kitchen, Draco sat down, while Harry searched around his muggle fridge that he'd been able to install, along with the TVs, thanks to Hermione.
-"I wish things were different, I wish there'd been only me all along, but things are what they are - so I'm going to stay
-"And, to be quite honest, none of us thought you'd ever be back. I mean we knew you're just as selfish as the worst of us and that you'd do anything as long as you think you'd get away with it - but to think you'd leave
. Because my son. Oh, my son. My son. My son. My son. My Scorpius. My heart. I could never do that to him. I could never let him grow up in a world where The Dark Lord existed. I could never risk The Dark Lord finding him, wanting him, hurting him. Id rather be in pain. And I am. Always. Always. Merlin. My son—"
Ron growled and lunged at Harry, kneeing him in the stomach, shoving him back, punching him in the face, kicking his legs from underneath him, stomping on his ribs - Harry saw stars; his vision blurred at the edges. Everything throbbed. He didn't fight back.
-"You know I don't think Father hates you anymore. He thinks you're pathetic, I have high hopes he'll find you endearingly pathetic in no time and then you can go up from there to amusing, adorable and so forth, maybe one day he'll like you."
With a whoosh, Draco Malfoy stepped out of Harry's foyer. Harry nearly fainted from relief. And not unlike yesterday's fervent welcome, Harry threw himself upon Draco, hugging him tightly,
