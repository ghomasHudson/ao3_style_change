Of course, such hidden, infrequent sexual habits were a big part of why his mother was still immersed in her denial.
Harry nodded again.
Draco’s laugh barked out. “No,” he agreed.
Draco waited, but Mother just looked out the window.
So Draco pulled him in by the waist and kissed him.
“Mm,” Harry said.
Malfoy lifted his head now to look at Harry. "You… really? I've known I was gay for…. Let's just say a few years now. Haven't you been dating lots of girls?"
Harry came in, raising the lights very gently with his wand. “Would you like dinner?”
Harry though, began to kiss down Draco’s chest, his belly, his cock, and Draco couldn’t seem to find a way to stop him from taking Draco’s cock into his mouth. Again. Which was just wrong except that it felt so ridiculously wonderful.
Harry could get behind a crup a lot more easily than a bunch of fish. “Yeah?” he said, hoping for more.
Draco couldn’t respond.
“Hannah has really pretty hair,” Neville said, sounding hopeful. “So you think she’s actually available?” He smiled at Harry. Then he looked a bit upset. “What if she thinks I’m a loser for being a virgin?”
Relaxing under Draco’s forceful pressure, Harry made a questioning noise. Draco tried again. “The effect was originally discovered by Lord Rayleigh at Saint Paul's Cathedral, in London. But it can happen anywhere on earth. It works for both sound waves and magic.”
Fuck you, arsehole, you’ve made mumm furious at me. Bet thats just what you wanted. I hate loathe fuck miss want you so much and
“I once watched a tsunami hit Indonesia,” Narcissa confessed quietly. “It was quite shocking, even from this perspective.”
“Suck me now? Then fuck me again?”
Draco stared out the window, seeking to calm his nerves.
He didn’t turn around when he heard Draco stir. Instead, he spoke, looking down at the careful circles he’d drawn, illustrating Janzorti’s Geomantic principle. “Sleep well?”
“Now I want to explode all over your chest while you fuck my arse so hard I can’t remember who either of us ever used to be.”
Draco looked blankly at his emptied plate. “I have no idea what to do with my dirty plate and fork,” he eventually admitted. Harry giggled at him.
Harry did not know much about the red tape and inconveniences of international travel, but he could admire the globe, a Black heirloom. It had built-in magnification spells that allowed him a better look at any country he liked. It was also self-updating regarding both political boundaries and natural disasters. Harry found himself mesmerized by a blizzard forming over the part of the USA called “Minnesota.”
“I sympathize,” Harry said, and he sounded so sincere. “But Draco…” he paused, and — breathing — Draco took the moment to marvel that (for now) he could hold a naked, happy, Harry Potter in his arms.
Chancroid: Negative
“You countenance me when I’m snappish. When I’m silent. When I am drowning in work, and conversely, when I’ve none and am positive bankruptcy is imminent. I suspect if there were… an epidemic, and I had to brew cures for weeks on end, you’d even accept that.”

It was Mrs. Malfoy's soft, placating voice that Harry heard first. He found himself listening with care to her tone of voice, as he still could not see anything other than the tiny shoe, the handsomely carpeted floor and the clean white feet of the cot.
Harry inhaled, and Draco waited for him to argue with Draco’s assumption that Harry would miss him solely for sex. But Harry didn’t speak, so Draco stayed silent.
“To…” Harry swallowed miserably. “Malfoy Manor?”
It wasn't long at all before Malfoy left the room. At first he seemed content to sneer at Harry and swoosh past, robes almost afloat. Rather like Snape. But then he was suddenly pressing Harry into the wall, arms around Harry's torso, face in Harry's face. Harry was too shocked to do anything more threatening than attempt what he was sure was a half-hearted sneer. He put his hands on Malfoy's chest but didn't shove back - he wanted only a bit of distance between their faces. But it wasn't distance he created, as Malfoy felt thin and warm through his robes. Harry felt his eyes open even wider. He couldn't think of a single thing to say.
Attempting to live up to this ridiculous (even Draco knew it, but he didn’t care), self-imposed mandate took a great deal of time. Time Draco might, conceivably, have spent on dating. But that was all right, because Draco had no chance at dating his massive crush Harry Potter, or — while he was being honest with himself — anyone else. He told himself first of all, no one wanted him as he was currently perceived: evil, Death Eater scum; and second, no one would want him as he currently
He wanted decadent, delicious sex, not a warding ritual.
“You ask too much,” Narcissa whispered.
Chlamydia: Negative
Uncomfortable with the silence, Harry broke it. “It can’t be about casting spells. You’re ace in all our classes. I think you’re going to beat Hermione’s marks in Transfiguration.”
"Congratulations all," said a calm voice that was unmistakably Snape's.
Draco’d wanted to have fun (to finally be
“Thank you for coming so quickly,” Draco finally said, pulling himself from Harry’s uniquely comforting arms. He spelled his face clear of tears and puffiness surreptitiously as he walked toward the parlour doorway, so Harry couldn’t see. Then he looked across the hallway and through the spellwork guarding Mother, who was still, thank Merlin, fast asleep in her most comfortable chair.
Gripping the posts of his headboard till his knuckles went white, Harry struggled not to fly apart like a startled flock. Draco was teasing Harry’s foreskin with his lips while three of his fingers were moving inside him, stretching and teasing.
The rest of the trip was boring and uneventful. They scrupulously avoided alcohol that night, and went to sleep alone in separate, tiny bunk beds in an efficiently designed sleeper car. They changed trains and rode on, arriving in London in the evening, just as planned.
So, Harry packed. He bought a phrasebook of American wizarding slang, and another book for legal tips and explanations of America’s baffling monetary system. Draco asked him to go clothes shopping, but Harry suggested they go in America instead. Draco agreed with so much enthusiasm that Harry got a bit nervous.
“I wanted, rather dearly, to come all over your pretty face.”
“So you know the facts!” Parvati laughed. “But what’s changed?” She made room for Lavender, who took her arm and looked avidly toward Harry, still grinning.
Harry stood taller, crossed his arms (and his wand) over his chest, and refused to back down.
“Of course, Sire,” Draco whispered to the air in his bedroom as he worked the dildo in and out as quickly as he could stand. He spread his legs farther and jerked hard at his cockhead. His pre-come was flowing fast now, and he spread it around and around with every twist of his wrist. “I’m such a
“Tea, Mr Potter?”
Harry stared at her eyes briefly, then nodded.
He was well-spoken. Knew multiple languages, too.
“Fuck. I didn’t tell Molly and Arthur, either.”
Unluckily she knew almost nothing about the doorway she had used to get between her house, and that of her paternal grandparents.
Draco looked at his nails briefly, then put the hand on the opposite edge of the door. He suddenly looked like a photograph in a frame and Harry wondered where that idea had come from.
"Cho and I kissed once." Harry pulled Malfoy a bit closer. "So I suppose I do know how to do that part."
“I know all of that got in the way, and I know you couldn’t help any of that. But I am asking you, right now: are you going to let things you

Draco knew, for once, his sadness was written all over his face. His mother’s own sadness was all the mirror he required. She took his hand and gave him a small, sad smile.
"I think, my dear Harry, that a nap is in order. Then we should heat up all those noodles and eat them. But I know one thing for certain."
How had Harry
“Yes, my King…” Draco murmured aloud as the dildo slipped in up to the third heavy glass rib.
“Worst of all, I wonder, if Riddle had not had Lucius behind him: Lucius’ wealth, social capital, political power… would Riddle have accomplished what he did? Gone as far? Killed nearly so many? It causes me profound discomfort, but I nonetheless must wonder: How much of this was my fault? Obviously Riddle and Lucius were responsible for their own actions. But I, just as much, am responsible for my own. And my lacks. Everything I could have done, but did not do.”
He didn’t know a spell to fix it, so he added a bit more salt and choked down the overly-sweet oats with a cup of overly strong tea. He’d hoped stronger tea would help him deal with the half-ruined porridge, but it didn’t work very well.

Draco had attempted to express his gratitude for Severus' tender feelings, but Severus scoffed at the very idea. Nonetheless, Draco could clearly see that it was true. After all, no one else understood Severus - his life and sacrifices - the way Draco did. Slytherins, spies, marked, misunderstood. They had the worst things in common, and the best.
"Draco? Tiger? Where are you?"
“All right, Mr Expensive Wardsmith, what the hell do I do now?”
Harry turned away, pretending he needed to put his book back on the shelf. Whatever his face was doing at present, he was sure Draco shouldn’t see it. He took a deep breath before turning around, making sure to look blandly interested. “Are you that curious about the sound of your voice when you talk in your sleep?”
“So… that isn’t an obstacle?”
t-T-t-T-t-T-t-T-t
“There was a time,” Harry whispered, putting fingertips to Draco’s temple, “when that look would have made me likely to explode. In a bad way.”

“Oh fuck,” Draco wailed, trying to be quiet.
“Yes,” Draco agreed. He stroked Harry’s hair. “It feels we’ve started something very good, indeed.”

They asked their waiter — his name tag said Calvin — about the Pride celebration, and he frowned. “There’s no committee this year, gents,” Calvin told them. “Everyone’s decorated, of course, but the thing fell apart. Don’t be buying any tickets. My flatmate bought a ticket but it’s a scam.” When he saw their faces fall, he tried to cheer them up. “Lots of people will be throwing their own parties, of course, you know! Even if there isn’t a march or a music festival this year, there’s plenty of ways to celebrate. I’m sure a lot of people will be found relaxing in Soho Square. Not to mention, you should come back again, eat here!” He winked hugely and Harry and Draco both laughed.
t-T-t-T-t-T-t-T-t
Draco looked surprised. “For?”
I hope you will find my son’s mind and body become a source of benefit, pleasure, and reassurance. As long as he lives in my Lord’s castle, and perhaps even sleeps occasionally in my Lord’s bed, I will be clearly and logically constrained by mind, heart, soul and magic, from opposing my Lord King. As long as Draco lives, I will remain your obedient servant and will obey your orders without hesitation.
Instead of answering directly, Malfoy raised his wand at the chocolate bar. "
But not right now. Harry finished a beer and opened another as Draco finished the entire bag of Doritos. Right now Harry was trying to mend fences, as Andromeda had insisted. Low, cutting remarks wouldn’t help. And yet, he really had to restrain himself! Especially after having drunk so much beer.
"Yeah," Harry said, sensing he might have put a foot right for once. He looked at Malfoy again. "That crap is awful, Malfoy. This stuff I bought is really bad, too, now that I think about it. Couldn't a train this fancy have decent a English lager?"

Rosscot was down one hall, past three doors and behind a shimmering wall of spellwork. “Is that you, Narcissa?” he called at their footsteps. Mother tensed. Granger shook her head, as though either Malfoy would have been foolish enough to respond verbally.
Malfoy looked surprised, then pleased. "I suppose we should find out, then, shall we?" he replied. Draco rolled onto his right side and pulled Harry over closer, rolling Harry onto his left. Draco pulled Harry's right arm over his side and kissed him once. Then he smiled and - throwing his left leg over Harry's hip - grabbed their hard cocks in his left hand and began to stroke up and down their shafts. Harry's eyes rolled back in his head and he groaned.
"Yes, Harry." He stopped to pull his sleeve over his deformed hand. "I have finally obtained a memory that I think will be absolutely instrumental in the retrieval of a horcrux. Won't you sit down, and I'll explain?"

Draco woke up a short time later, judging by the height of the sun in the sky. Sighing with pleasure and regret, he pulled the dildo from his arse. That had been satisfying, but now his extra blanket was completely disgusting, and he needed a shower. He cast a short series of spells to sterilize his dildo and return it to its box under the bed. He pulled the extra blanket off, again, and wrinkled his nose at it. No time for laundry right now, if he was going to get anything else done today. Shoving the blanket to the bottom of the hamper, he made do with a few spells and soon his bed at least looked pristine and freshly neatened.
, Draco thought, pleased all over again.

He saw the relief break over Andromeda’s face, but had no idea it was for two reasons, not just the one she had revealed to him.
Harry smiled and leaned in, stopping only millimetres away. “Love it,” he breathed.
They listened as Rosscot incriminated himself so thoroughly that both he and Mother were fighting back vomit.
“Then why would I be jealous? What I actually am, is surprised. Parkinson doesn’t seem to be any more likely to enjoy something that Muggle than I thought you were.”
t-T-t-T-t-T-t-T-t
"It is not their fault, Professor Snape. Not either of them. They are merely involved, and primarily via their parents, at that. But please, do explain. It is your story to tell."
Harry pulled Draco into his arms and cuddled him close.
“I was not aware you had a dog,” Draco said, sounding withdrawn, stiff.
Malfoy cringed. "He's… he's the one who's finally going to get rid of that bastard…" Malfoy turned to Harry with a look that mingled distrust, despair, and hope. "Right? We're all counting on you. Are you going to let us down? Do you know what he's forcing me to do?"
“You want to plan our dates?” Harry’s eyes were shy, but he was smiling a little.
“So; my dear son, Harry. This is where I sit. My husband is incarcerated, thus I am freed. And honestly grateful. However, I have neither legal nor magical control of my own home.
"I am here to be with you. I can wait a long time for the mind blowing shag I know will happen between us - sooner or later. And I know, I am very sure, that eventually we will be incredible together. Because we have always been explosive, and because I want you more than I have ever wanted anyone in my entire life. Not to mention, you want me enough to push through generations worth of bullshit.
The three tempting fuck holes of arse, cunt and mouth. The tits. He thought could find a way to fuck those, too, if he tried. The plump, soft curves. The hair already long enough to braid and wrap around a hook high up on a wall.
Draco pressed his cheek to the red and gold wallpaper. There he stood, subservient, turned away from the door, waiting in impatient silence. Just before placing himself against the wall he had prepared himself with precisely the amount of lube Harry preferred – something he knew from experience and from Harry’s written instructions. Eventually a noise from the other room prompted Draco to reach back and spread open his arse cheeks. Harry had finally returned from work. Now he was ready to take Harry’s big erection, at the first moment Harry might like to fuck him with it.
“I was actually thinking I’d like to take you on a holiday,” Harry said, looking earnest, hopeful and possibly a bit sick. “To America. We would start in New York City, I thought? And then, er, Boston? The wizarding districts in both are, uh, pretty famous, and…”
All the way back from Spoons, Draco stopped himself from ranting at his friends by sheer force of will. What the bloody hell was Harry Potter doing seeing a complete dork like
Harry obeyed quickly. Draco felt his spine once again come right off the bed. Harry lost his place inside for a second, but he found it again quickly, and just… followed Draco as he writhed.
“I agree, Sir,” he finally said. “Should I owl, or visit her home in person, hat in hand?”
Looking at each other first, the two sex slaves slowly got on their knees on the floor, scowling as they so often did.
“It surely would not come to that,” his mother rushed to assure, but Draco wasn’t having it.

“I’ll tell you everything directly,” Draco sighed, then shivered. He could feel his brave façade finally start to weaken. Standing up to Mother’s tirade had been exhausting. “As soon as I can sit down with that drink.”
Draco sat on his couch. He really didn’t think he was dreaming, but how could he not be? He wondered how he was meant to check. (Should he pinch himself? He would look like a moron.) He looked up at Potter, who looked back at him. They were clearly both lost.
"The stone is too distracting. Can you make it more of an outline, but still show color?"
Harry felt his embarrassment rise. “Of course,” he said, trying to regain his confidence. “It’s perfectly sensible. But if you have other people in the home, I’m sure they’ve been aware of the wards and perimeters. You should be safe to arrive home alone, as it hasn’t been sitting empty while we have been working. Besides,” Harry said, “I should really visit Ginny; get Butch back.”
“You are so fucking cute,” Harry said, as though it was an answer. “You don’t like being vulnerable, do you?”
"For the pelvic," Afelgate agreed, "that would be quite helpful."
“Wanting to conquer the world, I bet,” Grandfather rumbled. “Handsome, intelligent grandson of mine.”
Draco turned to see Mother in the doorway, superficially composed, but touching the string of freshwater pearls at her throat, a unique nervous tell Draco had discerned during the war.

Harry nodded and grasped the bright yellow base.
“That good?” Harry asked. He sounded more confident already and Draco almost chastised him for teasing. Then Harry slid his finger in another couple of inches and Draco lost his train of thought. He melted back into the mattress and bent his legs more tightly.
Scrivener removed a remarkably thin, short wand from his bag and touched it to Malfoy's lower back. Distractedly, Harry attempted to remember that was supposed to be slowly fucking his slave with the dildo instead of concentrating all his attention on the artwork.
“Don’t be embarrassed,” Harry said, kissing Draco’s temple. “Everyone reads in the loo.”
Draco blanched. “Are you sure? Death Eaters have tried? It would be easy to guess who I hired, where I am. Would you hear if I called out?” He wrung his hands once, then put his hands in his pockets. “Could we keep the doors between us open?”

“Well, okay then,” Potter said, and smiled so kindly Draco felt something significant inside him begin to fragment. “Can I put these down? I brought a coffee and a tea, because I didn’t know what you would want. I like both. Do you have milk? I brought sugar packets.”
Draco stared at Harry, unable to respond. So Harry slipped down off the bed and, humming, pulled off Draco’s shoes and socks, one by one. He carefully inserted the socks into the shoes, as promised, then he stood and held out one hand. “Cuddle?” he asked.
seeing Harry visit Hogsmeade with another man.
“Dildo?” Harry asked, and Draco thrashed at the thought.
"Sorry," Draco said, and cuddled closer. Harry pulled him in.
He rested his face against the cool window. The newspaper fell to the floor but he ignored it. He was pretending to be asleep, right?
Harry cuddled close, pressing his erection against Draco’s damp groin. “My turn to come inside you,” he whispered almost tenderly.
Harry had long since put the knife in the sink and put the cutting board on top of it. He didn’t want any accidents.
Harry stared, charmed.
“You didn’t think to mention?”
H comes D’s chest
Mr. Malfoy's voice was quiet also. Perhaps so as not to wake his baby. "It will not harm him, Narcissa, I would not harm my heir! It will… change him slightly, perhaps, change his personality, but in ways that are all to the good." He sounded a bit dismissive. "It will not harm his academic intelligence, or his ability to produce an heir himself someday! He may become a bit more… obedient, malleable. He'll find it more natural to hate those he should hate. He'll be easier to sway to the Dark Lord's side. Not that I expect my own son would ever disobey me in such an important matter!"
Candidiasis: Negative
“One of the worst things about choosing to marry your father,” Mother said quietly, “or so I thought at sixteen, when his parents sat me down with my father to explain the requirements involved in accepting Lucius’ proposal, was Malfoy men only want one child. One
“Draco,” Harry said, caressing Draco’s face. “It feels like you're fighting off panic. This relationship is so far past little coincidences and conveniences like that. Don’t you know how much I love you?”
Draco suddenly remembered an amusing story his mother had told him about Goyle’s Mum and a painting she’d done out on the moor near her home, and he worked to repeat it as humorously as possible.
“Not at all,” Draco said, looking into his glass. “But I’ve been climbing the walls trying to get her to face reality.” He stared into the middle distance.
In response, Draco stiffly stuck out an arm. Harry looked at it, tried to think of something to say, and failed. So he grabbed Draco’s arm and side-alonged him to the filthy men’s room inside the supermarket closest to Grimmauld Place.

“Just writing that Transfigurations essay in my head, Pansy,” he lied, and patted her hand.

“Can you efficiently, accurately check all the spells while I fuck you?”
“Two-part authentication,” Harry said, striding toward the tent. “They needed to hear from both of us.”
“I’d like that,” Harry answered. “If it means spending more time with you.”

Draco came hard over his own chest, passing out and then falling deeply asleep. Luckily he’d thought ahead and set his wand to wake him before Charms, so he wasn’t even late to class.
McGonagall stood. "He is here. Let us hurry. I have Gryffindor's sword." She lifted it, and at her nod, Harry put the ring on a table she'd apparently set aside for this purpose. She raised it higher, looked Harry in the eye, and slammed it down on the ring. The ringing noise echoed through her office, hurting Harry's ears. He grinned tentatively at Draco, until…

“Lucius thought me almost… dim. He forgot about that little contest, because I never once reminded him. When he was unable to accomplish something, whether via magic or social maneuvering, I would usually complete it behind his back and tell him I had set all three house-elves on it, or claim my parents had said a few words, or dropped a few coins.
"Well," Afelgate said, looking unhappy, "it doesn't have to be me in future. This is simple medimagic in theory. I suppose if someone in the house managed to contract something truly nasty…."
, watcha gonna say?
Suddenly he smelled something soothing, warm, and delicious. Almonds, perhaps?
Five and a half hours later, sitting on a Eurostar train speeding them toward Paris; Harry and Malfoy toasted the brilliance of being able to combine wizard and Muggle lives. As train rides went, it would be a long one: from London, to Paris, to Milan, and finally to Lecce, Italy. It nonetheless easily beat the magical alternative. They had driven the tent back onto the Scottish coast and shrunken everything down into four parcels that looked like Muggle luggage. They'd made it all as light as possible via magic (not very light, but they could still carry it), walked to the nearest wizard Inn (thanks to Malfoy's knowledge of the local area, that had only taken ten minutes),
Harry smiled solemnly at Draco, who allowed himself a moment of pride. It had taken him a few years to be able to say that word at all, and he knew it would take a few more to say it without a stutter.
Kreacher looked unsure for a moment, but Harry was musing over this. "Hm. Your logic sounds pretty good," he said out loud. Kreacher bowed. "The easiest thing would be to copy the reward system I already know. Hogwarts. The gems in the hourglasses."
Harry's brain went south as Malfoy came closer.
"Safer than sticking around," Harry said nervously, and they drove the craft in silence at tremendous speed for twenty minutes until the engine began to whine horribly.
“Clear?” Draco drawled again, distance in his voice like a curtain.
Harry was now even more off balance. He'd thought the Headmaster had been dismissing everything he'd been saying.
Harry’d assumed the 8th year common room was a neutral zone. So he was shocked when Draco yanked him up for a lengthy, heated, knee-weakening, public snog.
Harry came to rest against Draco’s side, leaning on an elbow, other hand splayed wide, high on Draco’s belly. He inched that hand down.
“So, so much,” Harry said fervently. He squeezed Draco’s hand.
HIV Disease: Negative
On the other hand, they’d both apologized, then they’d talked. They’d napped in one another’s arms.
"Why would you think I knew French?" Malfoy asked giddily and took another long swig of Merlot directly from the bottle he'd bought from the café-bar. The train only sold those two kinds of wine, so they had easily bought both. Harry had thought they would share, but when Malfoy had let him try the Merlot he'd discovered he hated it. The Rosé was a little better. Being tipsy was better still.
The End
“Of course,” Draco agreed — more easily than Harry would’ve expected, before they’d fucked.
“I could never think of you that way.”
“Are you saying you don’t want people to know?” Potter said, sounding lost.
"Ungh," Harry groaned, unable to articulate how desperately he wanted to drill into Draco like a woodpecker.
Nervous and confused, he smiled.
Draco didn’t hide his surprise.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
"No," he said slowly. "What got us into trouble last night, was this," and he reached over and stroked Malfoy's cock right through his clothing.
Draco cast something surreptitiously, and then every word was clear.
Draco was already breathing deep, soft and slow, and Harry lay on his side, taking a moment to appreciate Draco’s beauty. He looked ethereal: an angular, sharpened angel. His skin was translucent. In the relaxed clutch of sleep there was no pink on him, just yellow hair and white skin.
When Harry finally Portkeyed in, looking curiously at the Scottish 1991 Muggle coin that Draco had found and charmed into a Portkey, any chance Draco may once have had to look calm and cool was long before shot to hell.
Harry ran into Draco at Gringotts.
“I will miss her,” Draco said, repeatedly running his fingers over Harry’s forearm; soothed by the rhythm, or perhaps the texture. “Which includes worrying.”
“Yes,” Harry agreed, looking fragile. Narcissa still gripped his upper arm. “Thank you.”
Harry walked to the window and opened the cream damask curtains. “I think we’ll see the sunset soon,” he said, and he smirked a little. He’d planned this really well.

Harry tried to wipe the gloating off his face with a deep breath. He’d probably done a lousy job, though, so he decided to hide his face in the pantry cupboard until everyone else sat down. When Malfoy said something crappy about lunch, or the little square plates, Harry could chuck him out into the street. Hell, Andromeda would help him do it!
"Er… I don't want to make you mad. We're stuck together for a while."

Draco looked up, eyes darkening to silver. “You have definitely,” he rumbled, “earned one hell of a shag. Bedroom?”
“It was by then, yes. Nonetheless, though the time of greatest danger had passed for the day, Potter insisted I sleep at his home, as it is in the midst of an enormous square of heavily warded property.”
Andi and Narcissa, in contrast, were sure their trip would be brilliant.
February became March. Draco had thirteen short, awkward, useless interviews before he finally found himself, his stomach sinking, shaking the head Auror’s hand in greeting. Potter fidgeted on the other side of the interview room. There was no way this would go well. Potter had always hated Draco.
“What can I say,” Draco said, still stroking himself – with two hands now. “Your arse is tight and hot, you like my cock, and I can’t possibly be accused of getting you pregnant. This school is full of bitches whose list of assets can hardly touch yours. While I’m stuck in school for an extra year, my dick still works despite having to postpone marriage to whatever little blonde pureblooded twat Mother manages to snooker into taking my disgraced last name.”

Abruptly, Narcissa put her teacup down and stood. She walked to the window.
“What are you suggesting?”
Harry took pity on him and waved the issue away. “It’s not important. Anyway, I guess I should be used to it by now.”
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
“He has beautiful daughters,” Mother continued smoothly, disquiet almost hidden.

Or take Parkinson and "defile" her repeatedly, so that no pureblood would have her to wife, no fancy Manor, no large bank account, no pretty Malfoy cock for her, ever again. Prove Lucius Malfoy right. Show Malfoy the one girl he ever had, ever would fuck, was a whore.
"This one won't last forever," Harry said to the Merchieftainess. We have to make sure to take the copy and have you keep the original."
feel good, and that's so fucking awesome, because you feel really fucking good too. And if you don't come soon, hell, I'm going to come before you do and that would suck because I really want your come all over me, you know? I want to watch you come, I want to watch that happen and know, oh fuck yeah, keep doing that, know that my dick feels
“Smart,” Harry said, and sat on the side of the bed, feeling off-balance and uncertain. He wasn’t drunk anymore. He wasn’t sure he didn’t miss the excuse.
"Almost twenty years ago," Malfoy continued, looking directly at the Merchieftainess, "a foolish young Hogwarts boy threw a trinket into your lake. A ring, specifically. He had prepared it as a gift for a pretty girl; my companion's mother, as it happens," he gestured vaguely toward Harry but continued to look at the Merchieftainess, "but she refused him. Angry, he threw the ring in your lake. Unfortunately, he died in the war we've just had aboveground. A war that was ended, and won, not coincidentally, by my companion."
But it was echelons higher, waves deeper into pleasure, to have Harry Potter pour his sexuality into your tight arse via a gorgeous, hot, thick, curved dick. And all the while, said Harry Potter was kissing him, grabbing his arse, pulling his leg up high, biting his mouth and neck and ear, moaning his gratitude and pleasure and calling Draco “beautiful. So ridiculously fucking beautiful.” Not to mention fucking him.
But when Draco moaned out, “harder now,” Harry immediately complied.
Draco’s face paled, but he picked up the knife. Then he smacked at the tomato with it, as though he’d seen nothing Harry’d demonstrated.
Draco was reading. They’d fucked their way through Draco’s list forwards and backwards. Harry was staring at trees, bored. Every available distraction (except sex) had lost its appeal. But there was a limit to how frequently any man could bottom, and Harry had no interest in hurting Draco.
“Jeez, Andromeda, of course it did. I meant everything I said that day. But Teddy… don’t you think he’s uniquely vulnerable?
“Merlin,” Draco said, tasting his breakfast. “This is fantastic.”
"Dudders, these are my new sex slaves. Do you understand?" Malfoy and Parkinson were just standing there, so Harry dragged Parkinson over and slung an arm over her shoulder. He reached down to fondle one of her tits and she flinched, then corrected herself. Malfoy moved closer at a glance and nod from Harry, and Harry reached under the loincloth to fondle Malfoy's round little arse.

"Basically, Mr Potter, what that says is that they are both in very fine health. For a more thorough examination, however," Afelgate said, now looking slightly embarrassed, "I'll need to put down my wand and use my hands."
“Sometimes I wonder what the hell I did to deserve you,” Draco whispered after they’d turned off the lights and said their goodnights.
Draco merely emitted that weird squawk noise again, and waved one hand, as though the motion communicated something.
Draco obsessed over the conundrum all day, until he finally understood. Those two hadn’t been serious. It was a simple fling, and now it was over. Draco decided Potter and Longbottom must have both gone into it with their eyes (and flies?!) open, and now that they had fucked, they didn’t need to again.
“What can I say?” Harry winked. “I like earning money as much as the next small business owner.”

Neville raised his wand and shot a locking spell at their door without opening his eyes or turning away from the ceiling. He hit the doorknob square on and it glowed for a half second. Harry raised his eyebrow but said nothing. He’d seen how confident Neville had become with casting since they had returned for their “Eighth Year,” five weeks previous.
“I want to have
"Whoa," he said, embarrassed.
He wondered when she would.
"What's his name?" Draco asked.

“So,” Harry said in the morning, after they’d fooled around under the shower, dried each other, dressed and headed to the kitchen. “Boyfriends.”
Neville, Parvati and Hermione left the library early on Tuesday, but Harry stayed late to finish a Transfiguration assignment. If he couldn’t be an Auror (and the Elder Wand’s master sure as hell couldn’t) he had to figure out what else he was good at. And, frankly, he was damn good at Transfiguration.
“I think I would like to be seeing someone.” He flashed a short grin at Neville, before looking back into the new night. “Someone who feels a bit less like a brother!”
Harry hung his head. “Did she seriously not tell you herself? Ugh.” He twisted his neck and grinned at Draco, sideways. “You two have a weird relationship.”
"Is that what that's called?" Harry said. "Tell me about this." He rolled onto his side and Mouth cuddled her body against his back, almost as though she were cold. This rewards system thing was already awesome.
“Still nothing?” Harry said, as Draco checked the surveillance spells for the third time that morning.
Once Draco had successfully fought off the flannel, he could finally explain his dilemma. He'd fallen in love with the most unlikely man in the world. And immediately Severus knew who it was.
“Thanks.” Harry concentrated on his deepening flush.
And Andromeda trusted Draco to be alone in a room with Teddy. No one was more precious than Teddy.
Harry hoped, at least internally, Draco was almost as overwhelmed as Harry.
"Why does the ministry want me to father a lot of children with virgins?"
make out most of the words.
Harry stopped and looked at Goyle and Crabbe. "Er, I think you two should probably stay down here."
Luckily it was Draco's turn to make or buy dinner tonight, so Harry could just tumble out of the damn fireplace and let his boyfriend take care of him.
The three of them paused. Then, together, they laughed.
Now, however, they were alone. Malfoy had the controls, and Harry felt twitchy. He tried to keep mum anyway.
Draco squeezed Harry’s hand so hard it hurt.
Draco was surprised. “I did not realize you were considering… men.”
Draco stomped out of his flat, locking the door behind him. He stomped down the hall to the lift and stomped four doors down the street to the owl rental place. It would have been easier to borrow Mrs Kishar’s owl, like he had when he had come over ill, but he didn’t like to overstep. That morning had been an emergency.

Draco felt his mouth open in shock. He thought
Draco thought about offering to bottom, but he couldn’t quite manage to accept that his first time would be in a broom cupboard, and, well, Harry seemed perfectly happy.
"For both of them?"

“I hope not, as well,” Draco said, allowing Harry’s attention to stroke his ego.
They tripped up the stairs together, Harry pulling Draco by the hand. Harry’s bedroom was dark, but there were so many candles and Harry lit them with one wave of his wand, and it was fine that all Draco could really see was Harry. And then Harry’s large bed.
Sinking into the bubbles, Draco sighed and ducked his head down, smoothed out the excess water, relaxed his spine and closed his eyes.
Harry still hadn’t spoken. He frowned. Draco leaned over and kissed him, just once, on the corner of his mouth. “Try to look a little less astonished,” he whispered.
HIV Disease: Negative
NEWTs were approaching. Soon none of the 7th or 8th years could think or talk about much else.
But Harry fell asleep with a slight frown on his face.
Malfoy gave Harry a meaningful look, so Harry raised his wand and, in quick succession, cast and then ended the Gemino Curse. A second map peeled slowly off the first, falling onto the bed of the lake. Malfoy stepped forward and picked it up.
“So then I gave up on that and rented a bunch of Muggle porn, trying to figure out if I was really even into men at all?”
"I could drive?" he suggested, but Harry begged off.
“Can I respond yet?” Harry said, gentle amusement clear in his voice.
Harry stood, nodded, and

“I do not… feel normal,” Mother said. Her eyes fluttered shut.
Since Draco was a prickly bastard, Harry let him control the movements between scenes. They kissed for longer than Harry’d expected, but undressed quickly once Draco realized he was being presented with a free hand within their agreed upon script.
“Do you require a bit of assistance?” Draco asks politely.
“Clever drawing,” Draco said, amused. “But with the blackguard in Azkaban, what is my need for such expensive, aggressive wards? I’ve heard they can be pugnacious, that they can attack invited guests. Even harm servants.”
“Mother,” Draco leaned forward. “You must listen this time.”
Malfoy's eyes widened comically, and Harry giggled. Draco giggled back. "That sounded really off," Malfoy said, "but Merlin, yes. I want that. I want that a
“What are you afraid of?” Harry asked. He sipped coffee, waiting while Draco vibrated.
Draco grabbed Harry’s head, pushed his hands into Harry’s dark hair, and fucked. He punched his cock into Harry’s mouth, drilled over Harry’s tongue, thrust his hips over; rushed down Harry’s throat.
“Where is she, then?”

Both men were breathing irregularly now.
“I’m not you, Harry,” Draco said as Harry put his hand back in his own lap.
Harry snapped his fingers and Malfoy emerged from the shadows. After only three days at Harry's house he still allowed his grumpiness to show, he rolled his eyes sometimes, and he was often slow to follow orders.
“Yes,” she said. “Are you here to follow in his footsteps?”
"You wanted to see me, Sir?"
Draco awoke in a chair. The golden web was no longer visible. The vials lay empty, discarded on the floor. Harry knelt before him, looking concerned. A house-elf hovered nearby. Draco’s vision jumped and wavered.
“I just, there was a time when I assumed that liking guys meant I had to be into anal,” Harry said. He eyes were unfocused now, like he was looking past Draco and through the blankets. “So I bought some lube and tried to like fingering myself.”

"It wasn't what I expected from him, either. But he told me things about my father, Harry… I don't think I can repeat everything he said. It disturbs me too deeply to think about it. I can't speak the words. But he told me that my father was… my father was himself… Lucius was…."
“I’m glad,” Draco said. “Because she likes you as well, very much.”
. They needed to get to Greynrushes' castle and he wanted to get there today, frankly. He'd had enough of this shit, and really, so had Hogwarts.
Andromeda patted Harry’s face so kindly, Harry wanted to sob.
Harry followed, pressing fingertips into his thighs, bobbing his head. He was hard. He craved Draco’s smell, shape, getting pounded. But sucking him was good. Their bargain of a cock-sucking for every arse-pounding was smart. Even if this position tired his neck.
"We can't portkey this whole tent," Malfoy said finally. "We can't Apparate with bubble-head charms on, let alone carrying all this gear, no matter how well we shrink it. But… I agree with you. This is horrible. We need a better way. I don't know how the merpeople stand this."
Neville opened his mouth, looking like he wondered what Harry meant, but Harry reached up and messed up his hair, then unbuttoned his top two buttons.

“Which is a good thing,” he said as he stood. He was back in control and felt perfectly steady. “Because you are clearly, still, a catastrophe-in-waiting, not to mention a nasty snake. You’ve shown me today you are selfish, lustful, and probably a bad father. Your sheer lack of scruples disgust me. I hope your poor wife deserves you. I am quite sure Scorpius does not. I know that I no longer do.”
t-T-t-T-t-T-t-T-t
“She loved almost everyone,” Andromeda said, and winked at him. “She was rather the perfect Hufflepuff.”
Harry hated sitting. He hated waiting. He hated doing nothing. He didn't even really like
“Before the war,” Harry said, and Draco had to agree.
Nodding, Draco moved to pack an overnight bag. Blushing furiously, both men looked intently at the floor. Thus, neither saw the other’s pink cheeks.
“Everything important,” Harry said, his scowl exaggerated for effect.
Encouraged, Draco looked up and saw the insecurity Harry couldn’t quite hide.

Draco had certainly wondered.
He looked at both of them. So similar: soft skin, trim bodies, pretty hair, hateful personalities.

“Bippy even brought food through, and it was fine.” Harry’s face opened into a huge grin. “It’s good, Draco. Everything worked just like the spellbooks laid out. I did it all right the first time. We can live in both houses now.”
Harry strode toward Draco’s bedroom. Draco called for Bippy.
There was an inaudible response.

In the morning he woke with a terrible crick in his neck and a thoroughly broken heart.
In the morning Harry woke, still so relaxed, so sated, so… well… happy was really the word for it. He stretched and opened his eyes and looked right into the eyes of Malfoy, no, Draco. His lover. Shit. Harry had a lover. He smiled, and Draco smiled back. Harry felt warmed down to his toes. And his cock stiffened slightly more, adding to his expected morning wood.
"Yes, they are what you think they are," Harry explained. "I want you to measure them both and go out to a few shops and buy them both a large assortment of clothing. Nothing for regular wear. I want leather, latex rubber, sex toys, corsets, bondage gear, skimpy costumes, anything you can buy. Make sure you can return it if I don't happen to like it. All right?"
Malfoy, unable to answer, glared nails.
“Draco,” she said, turning to face him head on. She took both his hands into her own. “I owe you a tremendous apology. I have suffered all my life from a deluge of strictures meant to keep me in line, and now I see I have attempted to rein you in with similar nonsense.
sat down next to Potter, and then Draco spilled coffee all over himself and had to hurry back to Slytherin for clean robes.

, Draco thought, and snorted into his pillow.
But he heard everything.
“Andi,” he said, “I can’t leave you with no one to help with Teddy!”
“Well,” Draco began, still a bit surprised by the question, “I guess I’d like to see you, mostly here at yours, a few nights a week. I’d like to sleep over. I’d like to take you out for meals, maybe bring you into London for a play, or the ballet.”
Eventually, Draco’s mother crumpled slightly, wiped just under one eye, and generally began to exude a despondent air.
Draco felt himself relaxing, comforted. They were going to have a serious conversation, he knew they were; but it was good to do this, first.

In Harry’s blue and green spare room, Draco dropped his modest overnight bag on the wide, squashy bed. He turned toward the American-style quilts on the walls, the framed crayon art signed “Teddy,” the enormous bay window overlooking only moonless night.
“Would you like to fuck me, or would you prefer a blowjob to start?”
Harry knew his personal vaults were valued at numbers that, on some level, made no sense to him. The Sleekeazy fortune, Sirius’ money, everything his parents had…. He was wealthy. That didn’t mean he’d grown up with money. That didn’t mean he felt posh. He was a middle-class boy from Surrey.
and be done with that arsehole wraith and know that this mess was cleaned up. But he didn't want to neglect Malfoy to hurry things up. That felt wrong.
Harry felt his face heat and tried to discreetly look away from Narcissa, whose smirk he did not quite manage to miss.
“I shall keep that in mind,” he says as dismissively as he knows how. But he is looking down into Potter’s eyes and smiling.
“Nope,” Harry agreed. “I just meditated and exercised. But we don’t expect anything until tomorrow night at the earliest. We started early purely to be cautious.”
“Have you grown since last month?”

“Well,” Harry said. His smile was somehow both warm, and dangerous. “I aim to change that.”
Harry had been quite proud of his dramatic library exit. He felt he’d managed to imply he’d moved so far beyond wanting Malfoy they might as well be on different continents. His robes and wandwork had looked fabulous, too. Harry had checked in his Pensieve.
“It’s the way I checked the house, looking for that microscopic perforation. I always check that way. I purify as I go. It slows me down, but it prepares the wards for updating. Then even if the customer hires someone else, their wards have been cleansed.”
"Yes," Draco answered, very quiet.
“And we had a long day,” Draco said, unable to resist trailing a finger down Harry’s forearm.
away with him and his fantasy ends.
"Almost a sponge of deliciousness that teases, hiding from your tongue, fleeing your teeth, pretending that they don't long to be devoured?"
But when Draco slipped a second finger into Harry, he moaned and pushed back onto Draco's hand. This was no longer a massage.
“If you say so,” Harry teased, his breath warming Draco’s ear. “I wouldn’t want to—”
“From people who don’t want something in return,” Draco amended.
“Mu ha ha,” he joked to Draco when he eventually returned from International Portkey Departures. “This installation will take

, for Merlin’s sake.
"I want you to be most thorough," Harry told Afelgate, grinning nastily at Mouth, who was nearly snarling at him. "I'd like more than a health check on her tits, actually. I'd really like your opinion on them as a man, as a man who has touched and looked at a lot of tits. You should check her health, but then I want to know what else you think."

"I think I would know if I knew Mermish!" Harry yelled, getting right pissed now.
“I am sorry,” he finally said, wondering if he would even be heard over the increasing volume of his mother’s fury.
As she looked at the ring he and Draco had brought all the way from Hogwarts, Harry saw the other ring on her finger. She was lovely and the two moonstones looked beautiful underwater, but Harry wanted to get the hell out of here, and soon. The atmosphere was nerve-wracking. He didn't like the looks the guards were giving each other, or the way two of them were blocking the doorway.
Harry grinned at him. “Not your usual?” he finally asked, as he watched Draco devour his cooking.
Harry waited.
"I believe you, Draco. Now, are you going to stand all the way over there all evening?"
“Well,” Harry said, “I could be remembering wrong. I should check the Manor, at any rate.”
Draco wailed.
it, and you know it. The doorway, too. That Fusion Doorway is one of the most exciting bits of magic I have ever seen, and I have Living Wards.”
"I want to talk," Harry said, barely thinking, "about the way you're sucking my cock." He reached for his waistband to get his Muggle clothing out of the way, searching Malfoy's face for an answer. Malfoy nodded slowly, looking almost like he was in a trance, and he slid out of his captain's chair onto the tiny sliver of floor between them. Harry's rushed his cock out of his clothes, not caring about the metal teeth of the zipper.
Someone knocked at the door again.
“Did you not trust me?”

On Wednesday night Draco was once again able to pretend that he had undone homework. “Sorry Pansy, dear,” he said, hoping she believed he was actually sorry. “No socializing tonight; I simply must concentrate on the second half of this Muggle Studies assignment.”
“What else then, Harry?” Draco said, still faking confidence. Truth be told, Harry’s words, his attention, were making this increasingly easy.
“I can pay my own bills, Harry, but I need you to travel to Switzerland to collect these funds. Ted put them in a Muggle bank when things started to look really frightening.”

“Then fuck me,” Harry said. “We’ll shower next. You know I love sucking you while we shower.”
Taking a deep breath, Draco prepared to speak.
He ended up on his hands and knees, Harry fucking the space between his balls and the very tops of his thighs. Harry’s cock kept rubbing against Draco’s cock, too. It felt amazing.
“Harry,” he tried. Harry looked up from the papers and brochures for all the little seaside escapes and delights.
might have to,” Draco said, frowning. “I distinctly recall spending hours up on my roof last time, freezing my arse off.”
Harry felt Draco’s cock firm swiftly against his own, so he grabbed Draco’s arse and rubbed their lengths together.
He explored the French countryside, planned Ron and Hermione’s visits, and continually promised himself that “next weekend” he would head into gayest Bayonne and try to meet a nice young Frenchman.
“Wait, what? Can you explain?” Potter said, and now the hope was coloring only confusion.
that the Wizengamot and wizarding world hereby discharge our debt to open our collective mouths and legs to Mr Potter and take him as we, grateful cowards that we are, deserve.
He frowned.
“Some of them,” Draco agreed.
Genital Mycoplasmas: Negative
Seeing Draco’s obvious disorientation, Harry waited for an answer with a canary-eating smile.
he said as he shoved the ring into a pocket, and — turning the craft around in place even before he sat down in the captain's chair — he steered it away from the rocks near the edge of the castle walls and put it into its highest gear. "I think…" he said, and tried something they'd never bothered with before, worrying that it was dangerous.
“Draco?” Mother seemed disoriented. “We… the Manor?”

So, apparently, not all of Harry's crazy Muggle-type notions were bad.
“Thank you, my Lord!” Finch-Fletchley says, and he strides off toward the harem. He is headed for the girls this month, Draco notes. He’d chosen boys two months in a row. Draco is pleased to see that the trend has not continued. He prefers his men to enjoy variety. He does go to some trouble to offer it.
“This is why you called me,” Harry said, bluffing confidence. “No other wardsmith in the UK can accomplish Living Wards.”
"Then you'd better keep my mouth busy."
“My Siberian Husky,” Harry explained.
“I need to contribute more to this relationship than my body and my conversational skills,” Draco said. “I’m not a paid dinner companion.”
Andromeda showed Harry pictures: Draco holding his own son, unfortunately named Scorpius.
Despite the lateness of the hour, Harry slipped into joggers, loaned Draco a dressing gown to throw on over his trousers, and made a pot of tea. They sat in Harry’s kitchen and Harry bared his soul. He exposed insecurities. He talked about the war, and work, and the utter mess he’d built in his relationship with Ginny.
"I guess I do," Harry said smugly.
Then Malfoy bowed from the waist again, very slightly, and took one small step back, as though to indicate that he was done talking.

“Harry,” Lavender said quietly, leaning across the table. “I’d like to introduce you to my dear friend William.”
Muggle libraries were impressive places, once you got the courage to enter, and to ask a librarian for assistance.
Harry found patience easier now that Neville was finally talking. Even if he wasn’t making any sense.
a girlfriend?” Neville said, eyes wide. He sounded slightly scandalized, and very titillated.
He had a teacup. He sipped from it and tried to think of something intelligent to say.
"Rimming. Dirty talk. A blow-job."

He found himself thinking, repeatedly, how glad he was that Mother and Harry had changed their plans and shared that blasted tea the day before Christmas, instead of the day after.
"You have no patience, Potter. We have all night."
“What?” Mother demanded, unusually loud.
“On the contrary,” his aunt declared firmly. “You should have, and I am glad you did. And hear this: emotions are not frivolous.”
But Malfoy? Living in his home, humiliated, on his knees, forced to do whatever Harry wanted, from dishes to apologies to corsets to ball gowns to leashes in public and all the way out to blow jobs? That was a petty, nasty, small-minded dream come true.

The next morning, after a night in two separate guest suites for visiting parents or other dignitaries, and a large, filling breakfast, Harry and Malfoy headed out to the submarine tent still parked at the edge of the lake and strenuously protected from student tampering with multiple layers of warding. In his pocket Harry carried a truly ostentatious moonstone ring.

She looked at him without any expression for a hot-then-cold painful moment, but Harry held his ground. The she tipped her chin to the left and allowed herself a tiny, crooked smile. "You know, Mr. Potter, while I couldn't possibly authorize your taking control of both of them, I can fully understand that you might need to… test them both out for a few days, before you choose which of them is to be your…" she paused and her grin, and tone, grew self-satisfied. "… long term choice."
Dumbledore was calm, but his voice held all the authority Harry was accustomed to. "The object your father hid in your cot, Mr. Malfoy. Do you think you might know what it is? Could you bring it to me to destroy? It is a part of the key to Voldemort's power."
Thank you, Ms Granger,” Narcissa said, shaking hands and smiling for the first time since the attack.
“But,” Harry began.
Harry tried to wipe the emotion off his face. Draco forgave him for failing, and looked more at the bridge of his nose than his eyes.

“Jesus, yes,” Harry said, and this time they did it on top of their dressing gowns, with a strong cushioning charm and a silencing charm too.
"Hm," Draco said, and they drove in silence for a long stretch, just admiring the fish and looking for angry, armed merpeople. They didn't see any, and eventually Harry couldn't resist asking Draco something he'd been wondering for hours.

Draco took a deep breath and looked Harry in the eyes. What he saw there calmed his heart. This was
t-T-t-T-t-T-t-T-t
“After that we plan to spend a few days at Loango National Park in Western Gabon, even though it is almost entirely Muggle. Can you imagine?”
"That's funny," Malfoy said, sounding uncertain. "You have a good sense of humour." Then he smiled a large smile and said it again. "No, death wouldn't much improve Snape's personality, would it?" he laughed.
Shingellosis: Negative
“I’m serious!” Harry said, laughing. He pulled his cock out, slowly, sighing with pleasure as Draco’s tongue swirled lewdly around him. “This was just the only way to get all the other men to agree. Plus Bergum felt it would help you have the right attitude about all of us. You know, getting down on your knees for each and every one of us like this, once every week. Mmm. Love your mouth so much. Since you agreed, of course I take advantage of it. The other Aurors would never stop teasing me if I didn’t, and besides….”
. It was enough to make Draco scowl.

Potter softened, somehow, and he tried to take Draco’s hand in his own. Draco let him after a moment of confusion, and found himself staring at their hands. Potter was holding on but Draco’s hand lay passive in Potter’s grasp. He looked up and met Potter’s eyes. He couldn’t quite comprehend the softness he saw there.
Draco swallowed several sentences about how Harry had obviously been dressed and ready to grasp the Portkey for a long time before he actually had. Harry was here. That was what mattered.
“Mummy, I need help,” he finally whispered. “I have no idea what to do. Honestly, I hardly know what to think. Harry… kissed me. I kissed him back.”

The Hat shuffled on its brim slightly, and everyone looked away from it for a moment, while it collected its thoughts.
He stared at Malfoy, whose blush rivaled his own. Harry stood tall. This was much more familiar ground. A girl? At his sexual mercy? For ten years? That was some sort of… porn movie. Exciting, but hard to believe.
"Huh," Harry said, a bit shocked.
"I like it." Harry put his hands on Malfoy's hips, letting go of the fireplace and carelessly dumping the invisibility cloak on the floor.
But Draco had read Potter completely wrong. He had not been there to scuttle Draco’s interview, but to upend it. Draco had been offered the job that very morning, and had accepted immediately. He hadn’t worked less than a fifty hour week since. He was determined to be the best damn departmental manager possible. The best in the entire Ministry. The best in history. Harry Potter was never going to regret intervening on Draco’s behalf, not once. Not if Draco could help it.
"Er…. Yeah?" Harry said, and then felt the need to confess his virginity. "I've never…."
“My mother was right,” he said.
“I’m not surprised,” Andromeda said at the same time, and Draco watched in discomfort as things devolved from there.
“Teaching him shapes, Potter. Is that not obvious?”
Malfoy didn't disappoint. "You stupid fucking… hero!" He turned the wheel abruptly to the right and allowed the machine to idle. It settled slowly into a small depression at the bottom of the lake, silt rising visibly through the water outside the windows and screens in front of them.
Draco didn’t know what to say.
“Tuesday evening, after dinner, you were on the Floo to Blaise, I think. Narcissa told me she wants to head back to Johannesburg.”
), and nonetheless enhance his marred reputation.
The breeches were straightforward and the King’s erection was more than Draco had dared hope for. Thick, uncut, straighter than Draco’s first wand and as flushed with unbroken color as the finest Bloodwood. More than long enough to tickle the entrance to Draco’s throat.
“I’m no
He needed a Dad so desperately right now.
“I’ll make it up to you,” Harry said, casting a cushioning charm at the shower floor.
“Well,” Harry said, leaning back. He crossed his arms over his chest. “This oughta be entertaining.”
Amebiasis: Negative
Sometimes Harry felt they were mending every fence they had ruined together as children.
Draco considered that. Could he fix Harry’s unhappiness? By giving him something that didn’t exist? Besides, he was unhappy too. That, though, he could do something about.
“They benefit one another?” Narcissa asked.
“So can I,” Harry said, sounding sheepish and still cuddled into Draco’s neck.
They were standing off in the 8th year common room.
"I have no idea what to do, Harry."
"Master Harry!" Dudders said, bouncing a bit on the balls of his feet and looking like he wanted to pirouette, or at least bounce higher. "Master Harry, Kreacher he has founds it! He has found the magic Master Harry requested us to finds! Founds it in the Black family library he did! Just as you hoped us would!"
“If it would not offend my Lord,” Potter says to him in a low, rumbling purr, “Might I return to your bed tomorrow night, instead? You are so much more... exciting than your harem.”
"He began to push hard all around Mouth's belly. Then he took up his wand, waved it, and frowned at the result.
“I’m tempted,” Draco said, looking at his tea. “But it sounds like… an uncomfortable process? You would be there for… everything?”
“Draco,” Harry said, clearly distressed. “I know who I’m talking to. I know your father’s in jail, your mother couldn’t accept your sexuality, you paid enormous reparations, people didn’t want to buy your potions.
Draco leaned in close, resting his cheek against Harry’s shoulder as though it belonged there. Perhaps it did, as Harry didn’t seem inclined to push him away. He laughed a little, anyway.
Harry tipped his head and looked Draco in the eye instead of speaking.
“You don’t need to convince me, Harry,” Draco said, trying to be soothing. He reached for Harry’s cock and gripped his erection tightly. Harry moaned helplessly and jerked his hips. “This is plenty convincing.”
Yeast Infection: Negative
“I came to talk with Aunt Andromeda,” Draco said. “I wanted advice.”
“It must have been Muggles, though, right? Because if it were witches or wizards you probably wouldn’t have been able to keep it out of the paper? That’s what Parvati thinks, and it makes sense.”
Narcissa finally faced Draco. “And, if I may, I would like to return home when England is warm.”
“Oh, Harry,” Draco said. He couldn’t help but laugh a little. “That was desire. I do that all the time with you!”
Draco turned Harry around, waved his wand to dry Harry’s hands, wrists and shirt. He put his hands into Harry’s hair. “With you?” he husked into Harry’s ear, “I want everything.” He took Harry’s earlobe between his lips and applied the slightest pressure. Then he drew a line down Harry’s neck with the very tip of his tongue. “I want to do. I want to be done. I want to watch.”
Feet were kissed. And ankles. And knees.
The elder failed to hide her wince. "Yes, of course you could. But we are grateful that you've chosen not to."

Harry missed Draco’s intelligence, beauty, physical grace and that secret little smile he hid from everyone but Harry.
Draco looked around. His eyebrows were sky high, while his arms hugged tightly round his middle. He looked even taller and thinner that way.
"She isn't!" Afelgate reassured him. "I certainly checked. But she could easily
The lift doors creaked and groaned open, and Draco stepped out into the dingy hallway. “Er,” Draco said, “our wards are pretty bad, so don’t worry, you can Apparate from here.”
Gravity pulled at him differently every second — not causing problems, but it had to be acknowledged. The best part was no bed to get in his way. If he wanted to put his hand here, or move his leg there, he always could.
“Ceramic cauldron,” Draco said, laughing quietly. “Merlin, Harry. No one uses ceramic anymore.”
Harry sighed in contentment. This really was wonderful. He hoped he wouldn't fall asleep before it was over. He wanted to be conscious enough to enjoy it.
“Can you last?” Harry asked, breathy. He arched his back. Draco felt it through his cock, balls, spine.
But Harry never released his grip on Draco’s hand. Nor did he step away.
“Go,” he breathed, dropping a little kiss on Draco’s sweaty neck. He pulled out and waved cleansing magic over their skin. “Rest. I’ll wake you when I’m tired, or if your surveillance spells show any trouble.”
“I don’t think I understand,” Harry said, but Draco thought he saw in the sadness in Harry’s eyes; Harry actually understood better than he liked.
They managed to work though a good section of the relevant boxes and almost to lunch before Harry started to flirt. Soon Harry had Draco pressed against the door again.
“You sweet child,” she said. “I’m here. Tell me, nephew, Draco. Why did you need to cry? What is overwhelming you so?”
He looked down at the papers, shuffled through them quickly, then grinned. “This looks great, Malfoy! I knew you were the right man for the job. He tapped the edge of Draco’s desk, then turned. “Told Bergum to hire you, knew you wouldn’t let us down,” he muttered to himself as he walked away.
"I've never been to France before," Harry said in a conspiratorial tone. He rolled fully onto his side. "But my horrible Aunt never shut up about this place. She was always hinting that Uncle Vernon should take her to Paris for their anniversary, or angling for a fancy 'French Christmas.' To think, I'm probably the first one to get here. Wait, are we even still in France?"
"She's a sex slave, Afelgate. She's not a normal patient. She doesn't have privacy rights anymore. I want to know that my fuck toys measure up to what my friends would find in fine whorehouses and such. Eventually she's going to have a new cock in her fanny every time she turns around." Harry tried to give Afelgate a significant look. It didn't seem to work, so he tipped his face down, and looked at Afelgate over the tops of his glasses. Afelgate turned bright pink and swallowed.
“Katie Bell,” Draco managed to mumble.

“I did that,
"Did you just offer to suck my…" said dick was almost fully erect, apparently eager to say 'yes' if Harry's mouth found itself incapable.
“I know I am merely a guest,” he said, watching Draco’s shoulders stiffen, “but I have news from my friend, Hermione Granger. I understand she is your Litigator?”
Harry fucked into Draco hard: once, twice, then slowed. “I wish you’d make a lot more noise,” he said. “This little corner of forest is warded high and tight.” He slid into Draco as far as he could push. “Much like your fantastic arse.”

And really, when he thought about it like that….
Malfoy took the scroll and unrolled it gently. It was ancient, and parts were a bit hard to make out. Harry wasn't touching it, but if he'd been asked to guess, he'd have said it was probably made of some type of leather. Malfoy was holding it gingerly. The merpeople mostly looked like they trusted him not to damage it, but one or two seemed to be looking at Malfoy with real suspicion, despite the approval he'd received from the Merchieftainess. Harry made sure his wand was still firmly in his hand.
t-T-t-T-t-T-t-T-t
“You don’t have to… orgasm.” Harry swallowed. “But the wards will be stronger if you do.”
. But that didn’t mean he couldn’t be frank with other men. He’d been honest with Aamin at the end, and that had been… awkward, but ultimately ok.
“Lead the way, Harry.”
Finally, Harry spoke. The dejection in his voice almost made Draco buckle. “You hate me?” he asked.
"I guess the matter is that… sometimes it seems like going out drinking with mates and hearing the stories… is the best part of the job." Staring at the window, seeing nothing, Harry thought about that for a moment. It didn't feel quite true.
Weasley comes with a small grunt of pleasure, and the slave takes his cock and come quietly, just as she should. She stumbles away when Weasley pats her head once, and – following orders – Weasley turns to face his Lord and display himself again, before putting his cock back inside his uniform and setting it all back to rights.
Harry felt his ears heat; his cheeks; his neck.
Draco swallowed, and tried to decide whether or not to confess his shame. There was probably no one safer, he realized. After all, she was his blood, but she loved Harry. She was probably predisposed to view them
Harry rolled his eyes.
Shocked at himself, Draco inhaled deeply and forgot to speak.
This chapter is a bit short, but a lot happens, nonetheless!
"One of these junior Death Eaters is to be your reward, Mr. Potter." She must have seen the confusion on his face, or perhaps she simply expected it after the bad start to their conversation, for she launched immediately into an explanation.
Whirling around, Draco watched Harry remove his invisibility cloak. Taking a moment to collect himself, Draco watched Harry fold and store the cloak in his pocket.

Once their hands, clothes, and the floor were clean again, Harry smiled at Draco and rested his head on Draco’s shoulder. “I needed to get that out of the way first,” he whispered, sounding breathy and intimately quiet, so close to Draco’s ear. “I’d never have been able to concentrate on research, otherwise.”
“Our International Portkey is in seventeen minutes and you
“If you don’t quit,” Harry said, cheeks now red, eyes turned up to the ceiling, “then I really will need to take revenge, because you’ll have bollocksed up my work schedule. I have five days for our project, and no more. Now shoo! Potions!”
Harry Potter sat at the table by Draco’s largest bedroom window, haloed by sunlight. He’d unbuttoned the borrowed golden silk nightshirt, and it hung light on his shoulders, showcasing brown skin, chest hair between firm pectorals. He was leaning back, reading through a large sheaf of papers. His glasses had slipped down his nose.

Draco seemed stunned by this unexpected explanation. He sat, silent and staring, still holding the tomato.

sex slaves. Who were obviously, objectively hot. Even to ugly little middle aged healers. And they were both Harry's to fuck as he wished. "Brilliant," he thought, and grinned.
Draco watched warily, refusing to find Harry adorable.
“Oh?” Malfoy cooed, one finger still teasing at his growing bulge. He’d still not pulled down that damn zip.
“Lapsang souchong?” Aunt Andromeda offered. Harry moved to sit.
