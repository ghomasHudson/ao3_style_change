“See you later then,” she said and left.
“Yeah.”
Then Potter’s free hand reached up and curled around the nape of Draco’s neck. Draco closed his eyes and Potter pushed his fingers up into his hair and pulled him closer. He kissed him, and everything in Draco’s mind went numb.
“Luna went back to Ravenclaw Tower,” Neville told him. “But she said she’d be fine with whatever we decided.”
“What are you doing?” he hissed.
Draco hesitated for a second before sitting down next to him. He listened to Potter's quiet breathing and kept his eyes fixed on the street ahead of them. He was sitting very close to him. Draco was still drunk enough that it required an active effort to fight the impulse to reach out and touch him, rub his back or something. Potter might be tolerating his presence, but it was unlikely he would stand for something like that. Draco considered lighting another cigarette. Potter groaned again.
He thought Draco probably knew that too.
Granger looked at Malfoy as if she had forgotten he was there.
“No one is here,” he said to Granger.
“Really?” said Potter, his voice suddenly cold. “You used to be so proud of it.”
Hopefully he hadn’t. He didn’t know how much Granger had found out – clearly enough to make her angry, but as long as she hadn’t convinced Potter to drop the whole thing, he could handle this.
Pansy leaned into Weasley’s personal space.
used to feel about him, but he looked completely wrong, so I sort of… held his hand. Because Hermione said this thing that wizards are different about that. Blokes and blokes and such, so I didn’t think it would mean anything, I could hold Hermione’s hand if she were upset and that wouldn’t mean anything either.”
“What, because if he had said no you would have just tried to destroy it on your own?”
“Nothing,” she said and returned to her food.
“Didn’t trust you to follow the rules,” she said.
“It’s not like that’s what he learned it for, you squib,” Pansy snapped, and Matthew didn’t say anything else.
Draco rolled his eyes. His gut was twisting with something that felt an awful lot like disappointment and he didn't know why he had ever decided to tell Potter
Harry laughed out loud and Malfoy shot him a look.
“Amazing. Who would have known.”
“Trained aurors who have been stationed at Azkaban for weeks with guard duty, probably not enough sleep, dementors sucking at the edges of their magic and constantly sustaining patronus charms. We’ll be fine.”
“Is it just me,” he asked Hermione, “or is Hogwarts a bit… weird this year?”
“I know,” he said, his throat tight.
Malfoy pulls back and Harry forgets himself and tries to follow, not wanting to stop quite yet. Malfoy grabs his wrist:
"I'll talk to them."
“Don’t worry, nobody will find out,” said Ron. “And besides, it was about time someone beat him up. Just putting that out there.”
“I’m not angry.”
“The dementors are here to keep people
“I don’t know where that hostility is coming from, here I am, sincerely trying to save you from yourself, and then I’m met with such rudeness.”
“No,” said Potter. “It’s not that. I’m going to open the door in a second, and when I do, just cast your patronus immediately, like you did yesterday. Got it?”
”Thanks.”
“That’s good. Now, your throat should be completely healed. You might feel a bit sore right after eating, but you should have no trouble breathing or speaking. If you do, come see me again immediately.”
"Aren't we what? I'm not responsible for her or her bad taste, she's free to do what she likes as long as I don't have to watch."
“Last night. I couldn’t sleep so I came up here and found your note.”
“My father writes a lot about magical creatures in his Magazine. I don’t know if he’s ever done anything on Dementors, we mostly do more useful or interesting creatures, but I could write and ask him about it…”
“Nothing.”
He wanted to leave.
Harry didn’t know it was possible to be angry with someone for so long, but his anger seethed in him the entire Saturday following the night in the astronomy tower. All it took was the sight of Malfoy or the slightest reminder of that night for it to roar back to life. Because there had been a pact, they had had an agreement and Harry had been fulfilling his end of it, not even realizing that Malfoy wasn’t and wouldn’t follow through on his. What was it even he had promised? That he would stop being a bastard? Harry couldn’t believe he had ever thought Malfoy was capable of that.
“Fine!” he said. “But I’ve got no idea if we’re together, alright? It’s not like it’s been bloody simple, but yeah, I like him. I like him a lot, and I’m sorry about that, sorry I didn’t tell you, I was going to, I just really didn’t want to have this fucking fight with you right now.”
. He had been watching him to a downright creepy extent during their Hogwarts years, and he
Potter looked at him.
“Some pathetic revenge scheme?”
“I couldn’t just sit there and listen to him talk about my father like that.”
Hermione cleared her throat.
“Nothing we can do about it,” said Harry. “Come on.”
“It’s freezing.”
Potter raised his eyebrows.
Harry nodded. Luna and Ginny took off, the rest of them turned to the stairs. Draco was the first one to notice the figure who sat huddled on the top step and he jerked back in surprise. Harry recognized the green hems of Slytherin and already had his wand raised before he realized who it was.
“So maybe the dementors and the tower are the same sort of thing,” she said. “And so the dementors have reach as well. Then, even if a patronus keeps them from feeding on one person, they would still be able to feed on other people who are far away. And the way it goes cold around them could mean that they’re able to suck something out of the air too, maybe magic or something else that’s left behind by people, and that’s why they feel so
“I know,” Draco said.
was delivered, knuts paid and owls sent off again. He thought it took quite a lot longer than necessary before an owl landed by his own plate. He yanked the paper away from it when it did and the bird ruffled its feathers indignantly. He paid it its knut and then unfolded the newspaper impatiently, already bracing himself for the headline – “
, and it didn’t
He can’t believe he has to say it, that he has to explain that to Malfoy. As if it hasn’t been years since it was as simple as
Harry shot Hermione and angry look, but she just shrugged.
“We’re coming!” he yelled back, then turned to reach for Hermione.
“I don’t know. Because Ginny blames her?”
“Sure, we can do that.”
“You know, I was reading something earlier. I didn’t know if it was worth anything, but I’ve been thinking about it, and it might be, so I need to get a hold of him soon,” she said, lowering her voice even though no one but him and Ron were within earshot. “In fact, we probably need to get a hold of everyone, but if you get the chance, will you tell him to get to the room when he can?”
Malfoy eyed him suspiciously.
He heads back up the stairs, taking care to make as little noise as possible, but it isn’t easy when the old house insists on creaking and sighing all around him at every little movement. He’s halfway up the last flight of stairs when there’s a noise behind him. He spins around – and there is Potter on the landing below, looking straight up at Draco. He’s in his pyjamas, his feet are bare and his hair is a mess. His glasses are a bit askew, he still looks half asleep, but he has a wand in his hand and Draco finds his eyes drawn to it, nerves alive and prickling under his skin.
Potter doesn’t explain, but then Draco notices where he’s looking. He touches the edge of his sleeve and Potter’s eyes follow the movement and Draco feels cold all over again, but he nods, and undoes the button at his wrist. He rolls his sleeve back, and Harry finally uproots himself from his spot by the door, crossing the space between them until he’s standing right in front of him. Draco holds out his arm and Potter grabs it. They stand close, their foreheads are almost touching. Harry’s head is bowed, Draco can’t see his expression well; he isn’t sure he wants to. He can hear him breathing. He can smell the scent of his hair. He doesn’t want to look at the ugly thing on his arm, but then Potter runs a thumb over the scarred, uneven skin, and he has to. Potter traces it with his finger, from the skull just below Draco’s elbow, along the snake coming out of its mouth, to the ugly head ending at his wrist. It doesn't move; still, there is a sense that the blackened skin is writhing, pulling at the paleness of Draco’s arm around it.
He was already lecturing Malfoy before he had even come through the door, preaching about the importance of secrecy for wizards living in muggle areas, and how this was especially important after the war, where so much magic had become noticeable, and if Malfoy couldn't respect that, his permissions would be revoked - and then he stopped in his tracks when he caught sight of Harry. His entire body seemed to deflate and Harry almost felt bad for him - his confusion was something tangible in the room, and Harry could see him struggling to wrap his head around the situation: the idea of Harry Potter (the Boy Who Lived, war hero) in the home of Draco Malfoy (Death Eater, disgraced) was obviously absurd.
So Granger had been slandering him to Potter – maybe he should worry about that, but at the moment he couldn’t care less.
“It has nothing to with my house, Malfoy.”
Malfoy threw up his hands in exasperation
“I think they’re fine for getting a sense of the place when you’ve never been there.”
like the right solution. Like when he had finally managed to cast his patronus – or maybe not as
,” she said steadily.
do this,” she continued. “I think your theory might be right. Azkaban is too wrong for people to accept, so they ignore it to make it go away, and that’s why they don’t question it. It sort of makes sense, except that means we shouldn’t care about it either, right?”
But Potter shook his head.
“Do you think that will work?” he asked her.
“Who did you watch die?”
“Right, no, I suppose not,” he muttered.
Lucius Malfoy froze in the middle of throwing himself after the stoat patronus. His arms that had been reaching out towards the silvery light, snapped down to his sides and he fell over, stiff as a board.
Ron didn’t say anything; he just walked out the door without looking at Harry at all. Neville and Luna followed him, and Malfoy stood up to leave as well.
“Monday is good.”
"Parkinson is making out with some bloke," he said without looking at Draco.
And then the Death Eaters are waiting for them when they do. Hedwig doesn’t make it. George loses an ear, and Moody is killed. It’s another reminder that people Harry had come to think of as immortal are anything but. He doesn’t feel like he needed any more reminders.
"Huh."
She grimaced.
“Really?” said Draco and his eyes inadvertently flicked to Longbottom.
He stopped and turned around.
Malfoy pulled a face.
Draco swallowed hard.
The smell of smoke filled his nostrils, he saw a house collapse in flames over and over again, or perhaps they were different houses, hundreds of homes. He saw his own hand raising a wand and flashes of green light, and then in between death and destruction were childhood memories of praise, of catching frogs in a garden, a field littered with dead animals, gashes open in their sides and guts spilling onto the grass. A distant, physical sensation of bile rising in his throat, the strain of holding on to invasive thoughts.
Nott snapped his fingers in front of Draco’s eyes because he was that brand of arsehole. Draco shot him a look.
"Did you set the toast on fire again?" she said, turning to Ron.
“I will. I’ll talk to her.”
“I honestly didn’t think you would come.”
It was a narrow corridor and she had to squeeze past the others. It would be a terrible place to duel. He flattened himself against the wall to give her room to work with the lock. She crouched down in front of the door and reached into her pocket. He could hear her breathing.
“She was very eloquent about it, wasn’t she?” he said.
“Yes, I was up late reading.”
“Have a nice Christmas,” said Draco.
“It’s not like he knew who he was saying goodbye to.”
“Thank you,” she said.
Potter shrugged.
He took a gulp of his beer. Malfoy turned his glass on the table, his pale fingers drawing lines through the condensation.
When the Dark Lord’s snake ate the muggle studies professor it had been almost like self-hypnotism. He had not been present at all. He remembered seeing it and sometimes he dreamt about it, but he could not remember being scared or feeling anything at all while it happened. Even if he had thrown up in the bathroom afterwards. So that was what he did now. He didn’t want to talk about what had happened during the holidays, he didn’t want to care, and here was Potter caring way too much and wanting him to care as well, so he switched off the part of himself that could. It was the dignified alternative to storming out of the room and slamming the door behind him.
He was looking through yet another book on dark creatures that was deplorably brief on dementors.
“I just wanted them to find out the right way. And I wanted… I liked that it could be easy between us.”
“I went to Azkaban during the holidays,” he said. “To visit my father.”
Potter nodded.
Tracey went home after a couple of hours. Pansy halfway migrated to the neighbouring table to flirt with a semi-handsome guy in tacky robes, leaving Draco to converse with Greg, who was far past the point where he could string together a coherent sentence, and Daphne and Blaise, who were fawning over each other like they were 17 again. The place had only gotten more crowded as the night went on. Draco emptied his whisky and got up, which, despite her recently changed priorities in terms of preferred company, was apparently enough to catch Pansy's attention.
Harry rolled his eyes.
"Why did you stop?" Blaise asked, looking around.
“I think so.”
"I probably should have told them I left," Malfoy said after a while.
“They can’t be very helpful.”
“Sorry, I just thought I’d say something.”
Draco’s jaw dropped.
“Yes, that was the other houses just as much as it was Slytherin,” said Tracey.
“Oh, come on, Potter, you know it wasn’t all me,” Malfoy drawled.
She stood up.
“Sort of. Have you heard anything about your father recently?”
“I don’t see the point of making friends that way.”
“I know it hasn’t, alright, but I couldn’t stop thinking about all the ways it’ll become even more difficult if everybody finds out.”
"Going to the loo," he muttered to no one in particular.
Draco was surprised to hear regret in his voice. He hadn’t thought Potter cared.
Potter pointed to one of the houses.
Malfoy rolled his eyes.
Harry glanced up the stairs.
“But now it’s associated with the fact that my father was a Death Eater, which I want them to forget about as soon as possible. So I don’t use it anymore.”
“I do. But this isn’t me having an issue, so don’t make it out like that by apologizing to me. I was worried about you and I wanted to tell you that, and that’s it. You should just do whatever you think is best.”
He stopped.
. Harry could feel a headache growing behind his eyes. They had only been able to make out a fraction of this floor from the stairs, but none of it had held anything but dementors.
"Oh, you mean did I tell anyone how you were so plastered you decided to snog me in front of the most popular pub in Diagon Alley?"
Draco wasn’t sure how he felt about his first intentional meeting with Potter. Objectively speaking, it had gone well. He had succeeded in making Potter give him a second chance, whatever that meant, and they had then had a somewhat enjoyable conversation. At least it had been interesting. It would still require a lot of work if he was to gain Potter’s friendship and access any of the benefits that would come with it, but he thought he had significantly increased the chances of success for his admittedly rather desperate plan. So he ought to have been pleased with himself, and instead he felt very much like he had torn out his last shred of integrity and dignity and dragged it through the mud. Some part of him was screaming for him to abandon the plan, that he couldn’t possibly go through with this and should just go back to regaining favour with Slytherin House or give up on his ambitions altogether. It seemed to be screaming with Pansy’s voice too, which might have been why he snapped at her during dinner, when she asked him what it was he kept staring at.
Malfoy put his wand away and folded up the map.
was on Potter's
“Be careful,” he said, looking over her head and straight at Draco.
Draco spends the year trying to get poison and cursed artefacts into the school. He mends the broken vanishing cabinet. He cries alone and quietly in empty bathrooms as he realizes he is not supposed to succeed. He still jerks off to memories of Harry, and he doesn’t even bother to feel bad about it anymore.
It charged toward the dementor, which seemed to stumble for a moment, becoming clumsy, and shifting under the cloak. But it did not stop – it continued gliding forwards, and Potter inadvertently took a step back, so he no longer stood between Draco and the creature. Which was when he realized that it wasn’t floating over the floor anymore, it was walking towards him with long, even strides. It raised pale hands to its face and pushed back the hood of the tattered cloak – except it wasn’t a cloak, they were robes and they were not tattered at all. There was no rotting flesh or gaping mouth hole beneath it. It was a face, as inhumane as a human face can be. The skin was bone white, the nose flat as a snake’s and it had only slits for nostrils. The eyes were red and livid.
Draco disentangled his legs from hers and stood up.
"I miss you," she said.
“I don’t know. Destroy it. Overrule the Wizengamot, bribe the noble families, I don’t know.”
“That’s a stupid reason too.”
had shared the limited space of that couch with someone else. He also, Draco admitted, looked like more illicit things than sleep could have taken place on the couch as well.
“Yeah, I appreciate it.”
“Okay. Good. Perfect, then.”
“It’s not just Death Eaters in there. But even if it were – you know I went there. You know I didn’t want to go, but if I had known what it would be like, if I had had any idea, I wouldn’t have gone. Nobody could have forced me to.”
He spoke in a bored, careless tone. There was no trace of a smile on Potter’s face anymore.
Draco bristled.
Draco and Pansy had taken up each end of the sofa nearest to the fireplace and sat with their backs to the armrests and their legs tangled together in the middle. Draco was trying to read, Pansy was half-heartedly following Daphne and Matthew’s chess game. Blaise was there too, writing letters with a calm look of concentration on his face. Draco couldn’t remember the last time he had been in the same room as all of them with this little tension between them. Blaise had been a pest in the beginning of the year with all of his snarky comments to try to get a rise out of Draco, knowing how high strung he was with the way the other students looked at him. But Draco had made it pretty easy for him too. He had probably had far overestimated how much talk there was about him in the school. Most people probably hadn’t cared too much. As soon as Draco had occupied himself with other things, all the rest of it had quieted down a lot too. He remembered how desperate he had been to claw his way back to the top of the pureblood hierarchy. What a stupid idea that had been.
She ignored him. Weasley’s smile had vanished from her face as soon as Pansy spoke.
Draco scoffs.
“Why are you still up?” he asked.
He sounded almost sympathetic. Harry pulled his knees up to his chest, pressing the receiver close to his ear. No one was going to think that. Especially if people knew that Malfoy was… The details of last night's conversation were pretty hazy, but Malfoy had seemed to think people knew. He had assumed Harry knew. Harry's head was starting to hurt again.
"He wanted to apologize," he said tightly.
“Dementor?”
Harry’s stomach unfurled from the tight knot it had so quickly been crumpled into.
“I meant for
, Weasley! Or are you talking about all of us, all the Slytherins? Because Evelyn Selwyn snapped her wand after they made her crucio that little one from Gryffindor, the Creevy-kid. She said she never wanted to do magic again, but her mother works in the ministry, and what do you think they might have done to her if they found out? It wasn’t a good time to decide to be a squib. You have no idea how long it took to get her to calm down, to get her to let us help her get a new wand so they wouldn’t find out. And the next day, they asked her to do it again. So yeah, I volunteered in those classes. If I could have volunteered then, I would have.”
“See you tomorrow for another go with the boggart?”
“What interview?”
She sighed.
Blaise grinned and grabbed his arm, pulling him to his feet.
“I’m back to being Potter now, am I?”
“Nothing.”
“Ignore him,” he said to Ron.
“You set the toast on fire again?”
“It’s complicated.”
"No," he said, maybe too quickly.
Ginny shrugged.
“I don’t know if it’s ever been done. The patronus charm just drives them away, and that’s the only dementor-counter curse I know of. I suppose we’ll have to research that too.”
Harry cringed.
"Yeah, sorry I came so late," he said. "Hey, Maya."
"Merlin, how drunk are you?" Draco muttered as he directed Potter to a doorway where he slumped over on the doorstep with his head between his knees.
as that, but he had thought it would be more than this. And now here they were, and it didn’t feel wrong exactly, it just felt flat. They were just three teenagers in some odd room in the no-man’s hours between classes and dinner. Three teenagers with a couple of books from the school library and an overestimation of their own abilities that probably correlated better with their amount of trauma than their actual achievements. It felt more like they were finishing up on homework than edging closer to the fall-down of some great source of evil.
“I can’t believe it,” said Ron, and he didn’t sound angry, just disappointed, which was worse.
“Yes, I suppose it was a strange thing to ask without context, but I… I would like to talk to you.”
Once he had started crying, it felt like it would never stop. His nose was running, he sniffled and all his breaths came out as loud sobs. He clung to her and he cried over the humiliation of his family, over the hearings and his mother’s distance from him and his own distance from her, and over Azkaban and his father’s imprisonment. He cried because Harry liked him and he was terrified by how much that mattered. He cried because his father was dead and as awful as it was, as sad as it was, it was also a relief. It felt like the real end of the war, the one he had been waiting for. The moment from which things could finally get better.
“Voldemort,” he says, watching Draco carefully.
“A bit. It’ll be fine.”
“I think if you’ve said what you needed to, now would be a good time, Mrs. Malfoy,” said the auror.
“I was planning on it,” he said, unperturbed by Ron’s loudness.
“May I leave?” he asked.
“Right,” he said. “We won’t.”
“Not all of it.”
“You’ve been telling me I was wrong about him for years. Every time I thought he was up to something
“I need your help.”
“Okay,” he said. “Teach me how to do that.”
For the first time, Harry looked taken a back.
And that was enough. Potter grabbed his wand from the table and flung a wordless curse at Draco.
“No, we’re almost there-“
Ron gave him a long look.
Blaise clapped a hand on his shoulder.
Malfoy was moving jerkily, Harry was sure the paper thin cups would shatter, the way he slammed them on the counter.
“Okay.”
“Maybe not for you, but I have to watch you sucking up to him, and trust me, that is deeply unsettling. And you know it’s not going to work. He’s not going to forgive you, and you don’t need him to.”
Draco was quite proud of himself that he only felt awful about Potter's visit for about two days. Well, actively, constantly and mind-numbingly awful. He still cringed whenever the memory resurfaced. Merlin, the idiot was so incredibly unpredictable. Sure, Draco had sort of looked forward to their meeting at the pub, and it hadn't been perfect, but it had been… well, dignified, at least. And then Potter had shown up on his fucking doorstep less than two days later. He had seen the flat. Even Draco's friends hadn't seen the flat. Draco was acutely aware of how sad the place was. He should have burned the curtains as soon as he moved in, but then he would have had to get new ones and somehow that had seemed an insurmountable task, and after a while he had just sort of stopped noticing them. That only lasted until the second Potter stepped through the door and Draco had to see it all through his eyes. And now that was how Potter would remember him, in his washed up, depressing muggle home.
Only then did Draco really feel like he could breathe again, relief finally flooding through him. “You said no dangerous spells,” called Pansy, coming towards them.
“Ginny!”
Potter snorted.
“Granger went after Weasley after you left. She said she’d try to persuade her to come back.”
“See, now you’re starting to sound like our parents.”
She said it evenly, no one could ever have heard her and claimed that she was complaining. But there was also something in her voice like this was something she had carried around for a while, that it had been weighing her down more than she cared to admit even to herself, and he guessed she probably hadn’t told anyone else.
Alain shut his mouth. Blaise turned to the three stunned Gryffindors.
She shrugged.
Draco put his wand away and picked up his things.
"Potter!" someone yelled.
“I couldn’t think of what to get you,” she says, closing the door to her room behind them. “I didn’t know what would be useful. Nothing too big, because you wouldn’t be able to take it with you. So then I thought, I’d like you to have something to remember me by, you know, if you meet some veela when you’re off doing whatever you’re doing.”
“No it’s not. The ones with Death Eater parents haven’t come back.”
“How are you doing?” she asked, her voice suddenly softer. “You’ve been a bit distant lately.”
“Told them what?”
“We probably all need to rest after tonight. And we need to wait long enough to be sure no one has noticed we’ve been missing – in four days, maybe?”
Ron frowned. A large group of Hufflepuffs pushed past them on the stairs and Ron waited until they were gone before he answered.
“I made the right choice, Potter,” he says with strangled voice, still not looking at Harry. “It took a while and I made so many mistakes, but I’m here now.”
Despite having taken most of the same classes last year, the curriculum was different enough that Draco still had a hard time keeping up his grades. He still had to put up with being the scapegoat of Slytherin. The holidays were looming ever closer. He had dreams of Azkaban almost every night. But there was also this: Potter sending him looks across classrooms - rolling his eyes at him when Slughorn’s monologues were derailed by anecdotes about his famous former students; looking exasperated when McGonagall announced the horrendous length requirements for papers in transfiguration. He wasn’t sure if it was because of Granger’s warning, but they didn’t say hi to each other in the halls. Instead they exchanged imperceptible nods, and Draco found that this was actually better. Befriending Potter became easier the less public it was. It kept Potter’s private army of devoted fans from interfering. It kept Draco from trying to spin their every interaction into a performance.
She opened her mouth, then closed it again. Harry was still holding on to her.
Granger stood up and when he turned his eyes away from Potter to look at her instead, he no longer cared about Potter’s conscience or his neck or his hands, about the shape of his jaw or the white of the scar against his dark skin.
“What did I miss?” he asked.
“It’s still not enough time – for the runes yes, but we don’t know what will happen in the pit -“
“Draco, your patronus,” said Harry.
Malfoy looked quickly up at him, a strangely open expression on his face, and a thought flashed through Harry's mind, that this was what Malfoy looked like when he didn't think people were watching - when he didn't have time to put on a smirk or a sneer. He looked different.
“When?”
“Sorry,” she wheezed.
Harry nodded and without looking at Malfoy, started walking down the street. He kept his eyes on the ground ahead of him, only saw the movement in the periphery of his vision, as Malfoy fell into step beside him.
Whatever angry thing he was about to say dies in his mouth. He becomes suddenly aware of how quiet the attic is around them.
idea of what’s good and bad! I know you’re trying to do something right, but I just don’t know why you think you have to pretend you’re something you’re not in order to do that.”
“You can’t stand yourself for being around me. The only reason you’re still doing this is because you have her to go back to, to make you feel good about yourself.”
The words hang there between them. Potter’s eyes are locked on him, his gaze is intense but Draco doesn’t know what it means. If this isn’t about revenge, then what the hell is it? His lungs feel too tight, he knows the words aren’t going to come out right, but he has to say them anyway. They fall like a stone from his lips.
Draco turned away from him and leaned over the counter.
the Ministry, you're lucky that sounds enough like a muggle thing that no one picked up on it. If you'd brought up the Wizengamot, we would have been screwed."
“Got it!” said Ginny.
the dementor, instead of driving it away. It’s the only thing that seems to make sense, we don’t know any other spell that affects them, not even Elphick mentioned anything else. And she even tried casting
“Why did you kiss me?” he asked.
“Harry?” someone said.
Harry kissed him. Draco was still halfway sitting and Potter had to lean down to reach him.
“So, Mr Malfoy,” said the headmistress and he turned his attention back to her. “I wanted to ask you how you are doing.”
“Sorry, I just need to- I hadn’t actually planned on demonstrating.”
“You’re leaving?” Draco asks and it sounds pathetic and desperate.
Potter straightened up and looked at him.
“I wanted to talk to you, I haven’t had the chance since you came back. I’m glad I caught you.”
“Sure,” said Potter.
mind?” said Potter, he was still practically yelling.
"I was worried too," Ron said sharply.
“There’s no reason that should reflect back on us. You can’t hold kids accountable for what their parents did,” said Pansy, managing to make it sound like they were still having a conversation.
“I was thinking we would fly over the forest.”
The rest of Harry’s day was just as awful as his morning had been. He continued being tired and irritable. Flitwick assigned another paper that Harry wouldn’t have time for. And not once was he allowed to forget about his meeting with Malfoy that evening. They had two classes with the Slytherins that day, so Harry had to spend all of transfiguration staring at the back of his blond head, and was forced to listen to him and Parkinson talking over their cauldrons all through potions. And even when Malfoy wasn’t there, Harry couldn’t stop thinking about him.
"That bad?"
"No."
“I see.”
“I heard you. Are you seriously suggesting that I obliviate Pansy?”
“I need to talk to you,” she said.
"Did you tell anyone?"
as they so stupidly called themselves. Once again, Harry puts his friends in danger, and this time an entirely unnecessary one, this time it is entirely due to his own stupidity. Sirius is killed by Bellatrix Lestrange. Lucius Malfoy is sent to Azkaban.
“I'm sorry about your beer,” he said, gesturing to one of the pints on the table. “I think it might have gotten warm by now.”
But they still end up in the Hog’s Head and they all expect him to be something that he isn’t – it was all just dumb luck, it was help from the right people at the right time. Cho is looking at him the whole time and all he can think about is how Cedric died anyway.
“I have pretty bad experience with letting my parents speak for me.”
,” Draco muttered, sinking even lower in his seat.
“Yeah, I think it’ll be alright for now. I checked, there aren’t any detection spells and no one would be looking for us, so I think we’re good.”
“Sounds lovely.”
"You think someone might have seen?"
“None of us are happy about it, but apparently Dumbledore had made plans to get him and his family out of Voldemort’s hands. He was supposed to be sent abroad, but something went wrong. They got his mother out two weeks ago and they’ve been shuttling him between safe houses since then.”
"So…" Ron said, when Harry didn't say anything else. "What about it?"
Harry took a step closer and Draco jerked, wanting instinctively to pull him back out of reach of the man, but he fought the impulse and didn’t touch him. Harry crouched down in front of the figure so they were face to face.
“He couldn’t have done anything. She would’ve killed him.”
The library was almost empty this time of day. The air was still and dry with the smell of dust and old parchment. There were only a few students still studying by the tables. Granger was sitting by herself in the back and had already assembled a great stack of books in front of her. At another table were a couple of fifth years looking bored and tired. Madam Pince was behind her desk and she glanced up when he came in. She gave him a quick smile then returned to her work.
Draco looked down at his hands. There were shoelaces and very little progress.
“She’s… better.”
“Yeah?” he said with a yawn. “You want to lie down?”
“I wasn’t being an idiot. It’s not like she was the first one to act like that, right? It’s been like this all year, disrespect and unfair judgement from all the other houses, even Ravenclaw. Someone had to speak up sooner or later, remind them that their insolence is unacceptable.”
“Don’t you need to clean up your station?” he asked without looking at Draco.
“Dumbledore said he’d protect you and your mother. You could have gone to the Order of the Phoenix or you could have stayed at Hogwarts in the room of requirement or-“
“Yeah, fucking Potter taught me because he thinks I’m his bloody friend, and all
“What do you want?” she snapped with a command in her voice, a warning that he ought to stand to attention and state his purpose before coming any closer.
Ron passed her a piece of toast.
Draco sneered.
“Lucius…” said Narcissa quietly.
“Can I see?” he asked.
“Yeah.”
She nodded.
“Okay, well I know you don’t like Tracey and Millicent, but they’re nicer than your other friends, so you could always just join us.”
Her voice was hoarse. She steadied herself with a hand on the wall of her cell and only then did he notice the coarse hair on her arms, the black claws at the tips of her fingers.
"I'm not going to apologize for getting drunk at a pub," Harry said, dropping his plate and silverware loudly in the sink. "That's what they're for."
“It was very decent of you.”
Ron looked away.
"Has it really only been a week?" she muttered tragically.
“And you’re… not too happy about that?” he asked.
“What?” said Ronald, expressing eloquently what most of them were thinking.
“Sure,” he said. “Fair point. I live at Grimmauld Place.”
"And Hermione thinks I'm dense,” Potter muttered. “I don't know why I'm even doing this."
He waved dismissively.
“I wasn’t trying to kill you. I’m sorry.”
“I know. It wasn’t terrible.”
They watched the others climb the steps and disappear into the castle. Draco sent a longing glance after them. The chill of the early morning was steadily gnawing itself into his bones. Granger didn’t speak until they were gone.
“It doesn’t matter if it’s not about the war – you weren’t even here last year, that’s why you don’t get it. You don’t even know them. You don’t know what they did.”
"Have you been back?"
Harry shrugged.
“Oh nothing, just having a friendly conversation with Potter in front of half the students in our year,” he said, not even trying to suppress his smirk.
“Malfoy- Draco, wait!”
And then, because Malfoy apparently wasn't the only one who was too awkward for this world, he added: "My ex-girlfriend is gay too," like an absolute pillock.
He said the last part in a condescending drawl that in an instant turned him back into the unbearable prick he used to be. But he had a smirk on his face that might have meant it was intentional. That it was a joke.
“Why? If you attack me I might accidentally let my patronus go out, and you don’t have your wands with you to cast your own. And even if you did, the dementors would be over you before you had the time, and they would alert the aurors upstairs.”
“Fine. If you think it’s better that way. But no one’s going to believe I was expelled because of my grades, so it doesn’t really make a difference what reason you give me.”
“Sure,” she said, like she hadn’t just watched this meeting crash and burn.
“Look, this was stupid,” Potter snaps. “We can’t- we’re not fifteen anymore.”
“I’m sorry,” he said. “I’m sorry, alright? I know, I’ve been a shit to Weasley.”
"Alright, so I think maybe that girl saw it? I think he had his sleeves pushed up when he handed her the cup, and then sort of pulled it back down when she was yelling. Oh, and she pointed a
“I liked the peace and quiet in the beginning, but school gets boring in the long run.”
"Their tracers are location based. This is my address. What will I tell them, "oh, it wasn't me, it was Harry Potter"? Who in the world is going to believe that?"
“Ginny and I broke up almost a year ago.”
we’ve missed.”
“Ginny is the only one who’s still in school, what about-“
"What do you mean?"
Hermione practically flinched at that and Ginny looked surprised at her.
“Aren’t you?”
“Maybe we should have waited a bit longer,” said Draco, also for the hundredth time.
“We’re not late. We’ve got fifteen minutes to spare,” she said.
“What?” he asked.
He bent down to kiss Hermione’s forehead.
“You just-  go ahead. See what’s happening. I’ll catch up.”
Hermione cut him off before he could go on:
Malfoy stopped and turned back to him.
Blaise laughed.
“She is. I bet you would have been killed off before third year if we hadn’t had her.”
“It’s complicated,” Potter says, even though Draco didn’t ask.
And the resolution on their faces was answer and encouragement enough.
“He probably won’t like it if you do that,” he said silkily and reached for the door.
“Yeah? What’s your idea, then?”
“Good,” she said.
Because he had been keeping an eye on the Slytherins. Malfoy had left them, it had only been Zabini, Greengrass and Parkinson at the table. Terry's friend had asked if Harry was interested in her, and laughed, telling him it looked like that ship had sailed. Because Parkinson was snogging some bloke and that was when Harry had gone outside to… Harry nearly choked on his coffee.
Umbridge’s regime becomes imposing, unsettling. Hagrid might get fired. Hermione suggests they start their own defence against the dark arts class, she wants Harry to teach them, and all he can think is that he isn’t a hero.
And he hesitates, because he doesn’t know how he actually expected this to go. Maybe he came up here because he is spilling over with restless, angry energy and part of him wanted a fight with Malfoy, but he also wanted… Malfoy has grown smaller since arriving at the burrow. He has become even paler than usual. There are dark circles under his eyes and there is an unfamiliar scruffiness to his appearance – his hair is getting too long, his clothes are crumpled. He moves through the house like he is trying to blend into the wallpaper. Even in 6
A couple of drunk muggles passed Draco on the opposite side of the street. He hunched up his shoulders and walked a little faster.
“This one,” she said. “Malfoy had that theory that Azkaban was actually affecting all of Britain because the evil had
“So – Narcissa Malfoy and Draco Malfoy?” asked the auror who had let them in.
“Have you seen it?” she said, her eyes wide with excitement.
Harry finished cleaning up the spilled juice and pushed the soggy napkins together in an orange lump on the table. He ate the rest of his breakfast as fast as he could and finished before any of his friends. His heart was still thrumming when he left the Great Hall.
Potter twisted the handle and pulled the door open. From the darkness came a gust of cold, the low sound of a rattling breath and Draco waited while the dementor glided forward towards Potter, who had his wand out but hadn’t raised it. Draco couldn’t see his face, but his shoulders were tense, and for a second he was distracted by the thought of Potter in third year, passing out whenever the dementors came near, and how he had never found out what it was they made him remember. Then he felt an icy twinge in his own mind and for one dreadful second he thought he had forgotten his happy memory, he thought that Potter was already raising his wand, that he had failed again.
“Yeah.”
“These days I make it a priority to spend as little time as possible with my housemates and most other people in the school, and going to the Halloween feast isn’t really compatible with that philosophy.”
"Your wand-"
“I told her I didn’t mind much and that it was nice of her to apologize. I don’t think she hates me, actually, even if she doesn’t like me very much. She hates Ginny, which is sad, but I suppose it’s not very hard to understand.”
“What, because you want to stay at Hogwarts for Christmas?”
He raised an eyebrow – the movement was so perfect Harry suspected he might have practiced it in front of a mirror.
instead, and Draco couldn’t stop staring or imagining what it would be like to run his fingers through it – what it had been like.
“And you could have stunned me if you wanted me to shut up, but there are certain things we just don’t do. It’s called integrity.”
, and he could feel him breathing, could feel his hair tickling his neck when Potter leaned against him and he felt like the worst, most disgusting creep to ever be born. Sure, Potter had kissed him, but that had just been… well, Potter was too drunk to
Seamus made a noise. Dean pulled him up and held him upright as they staggered out of the room.
“Then why the fuck are you here?” Malfoy snaps, and Harry is surprised at how angry he sounds – not his usual, aloof mockery, but a genuine edge to his voice.
“I hope we’re not putting all our faith in that.”
“It was just, after seeing the two of you in Azkaban, I thought there might be a bit more to it – that maybe you, you know, liked him as well?”
Macmillan looked over at Draco, making sure he and Potter were talking about the same person.
Shortly after Draco had left the Manor, Pansy had moved out of Parkinson Park and into the family's town house in London. It was an old wizarding neighbourhood and every house had an apparition point, a small luxury that Draco had never expected he would be this jealous of. At least tonight, it allowed him to be less late than he already was. He apparated to the pavement immediately across from of the old house and allowed himself only a small moment to straighten his robes before he crossed the street with even steps, forcing his shoulders down, his pace to be relaxed. He rang the door and a moment later he was let inside by a house elf, who took his coat and called him Master Malfoy, and led him down the hall to where the others were already spread out in the lovely parlour with glasses of mead and firewhisky in their hands. There were candles lit and the furniture was lovely, if a bit too baroque for his taste, and the whole scene was so achingly familiar Draco forgot for a second that he didn't want to be there. Daphne shrilled and jumped out of her seat at the sight of him, and Draco noticed the way Blaise's eyes slid approvingly over the cut of Draco's robes, and none of them actually asked why he was late, so maybe Pansy had already come up with some excuse for him. He sank into a chair and accepted the glass that was handed to him and tried to remember how to do this, how to be this version of himself. He used to love their parties. He loved exchanging looks with Pansy when Blaise's smug bragging got too grandiose, he loved Greg's horrible jokes, and Tracey's quiet laugh, but after weeks and weeks around muggles he felt like he was seeing double, the scene simultaneously the most normal thing in the world and completely foreign to him. He had gotten so much quieter now that he spent most of his socializing in contexts that required him to carefully edit his vocabulary to clear it of anything magic, and the habit lingered. And what would he have to say to them anyway? They all had careers and love lives and promising futures; Draco only had vague half-truths and amusing muggle anecdotes, and those took careful wording too, to edit out any actual facts related to his job or his flat or his new friends.
“We still do! I haven’t betrayed you-“
“What is it you think I’m trying to be?”
It hadn’t actually been that hard for Harry to ignore Malfoy’s presence at the Burrow. He rarely showed his face anyway, and Harry had enough to worry about to keep his mind occupied. Ron was pissed for almost two days, mostly on behalf of Hermione, but it eventually faded when Harry only participated half-heartedly in his contempt and Hermione remained entirely reasonable and unfazed. Fred and George gave up on trying to pull any pranks on him after Mrs Weasley caught them with a whole arsenal of stink bombs and yelled at them for an entire hour. After that, his presence was hardly commented on, except for the occasional, muttered aside of someone wondering aloud about what the hell Dumbledore had been thinking, or a concerned remark from Mrs Weasley about how skinny Draco was. Most of the time, Harry could almost forget he was even there.
“It’s the asphodel now,” he said, pointing to Harry’s cauldron.
"The problem, Potter, is that now they're going to send someone over to follow up on this. I'll have to deal with tons of bureaucracy, and they're pretty fucking uptight about the statute of secrecy these days."
Harry doesn’t tell him that he should, just like he hasn’t told Ron or Hermione or Ginny. There is a point where you can’t run anymore, or at least where you have to stop telling other people to if you can’t stand the thought of doing it yourself.
“Yeah, I would mind. Why are you walking here?”
“Potter-“
"Sorry," he said again.
Harry laughed and pushed himself upright. Malfoy scowled.
"She's at work."
“No, of course not now,” Malfoy snapped, a sliver of irritation slipping into his voice and for the first time he sounded familiar. “Just when you have the time," he pushed on. "Whenever you can fit it into your busy schedule.”
“Fuck,” he mutters, still out of breath.
“I want to be updated before we reach the castle.”
Harry watched him. It was dark and his eyes were slow at focusing and he lifted a hand to his face to check that he was still wearing his glasses.
Harry nodded.
“Yes, I see you made up your mind.”
"Potter, I heard even Krum said you were good," he sneered. “False modesty isn’t charming.”
“She’s really… the war was hard on her.”
“Not with your muggle family?” he asked, before realizing that this was tactless because it was quite possible that they were dead.
He wasn’t sure if the heaviness in his voice was just Malfoy feeling sorry for himself, or if there was something more. An uncomfortable thought struck him.
“I’ve noticed,” she said.
He sounded like he disapproved. It was amazing that anyone could be so good and righteous all the time – even when it was Pansy, whom he obviously didn’t care for, Potter still didn’t like the idea of Draco talking bad about his friends behind their backs.
Potter hesitates, long enough that Draco starts to think he might not even answer.
He was still smirking at Harry.
Everything that happened between them happened when they were fifteen, except for that one lapse in sixth year, when everything was going to shit. Potter tried to kill him and Draco thought he had been figured out, but no aurors ever showed up to take him to Azkaban. No Death Eaters came to take him to the Dark Lord. Potter hadn’t snitched, and Draco couldn’t ask him why, and the one time he got a chance to, they made out in an empty classroom instead. And Potter found the mark on Draco’s arm. And he still didn’t tell anyone.
"No, we can squeeze you in. Go grab a chair," said the girl Draco had been talking to.
“Goodbye, Potter.”
“Well,” he said. “That’s disappointing.”
"To- when you go out?"
“None of your business.”
!” he yelled, because he had wanted to yell that at someone ever since he found out. “Because that was his father’s animagus form, and I can’t even
And then, there was also the other, less rational reason. The one he pretended didn't matter, the one he didn't talk to people about. It wasn't like Malfoy was the first one to suggest it; Harry had been good, he knew that. But even when he had considered it, he could never see himself actually being part of a team. The idea of joining a whole new group of people like that scared him to death. It probably wouldn't be that bad, but he hadn't really… he hadn't actually had to make any new friends since he started Hogwarts. He distinctly remembered the triwizard tournament, how awful he had felt around Fleur and Krum and Cedric; younger and less qualified and unfit to be there and always, always on the outside. And the three of them hadn't even known each other. The thought of having to join a team who had played together for years, who were all friends with each other and who would have ideas about who Harry was and opinions about all the things he had done wrong and all the things they thought were heroic, people who hadn't
“They’re headed for the astronomy tower. I’m going to go with them, but I said I’d check on you first. I don’t suppose you’re coming?”
She looked surprised.
Luna stabbed a Brussels sprout on her plate.
As if he had other options. But Malfoy's expression changed when he said it - if Harry didn't know better, he might have said he looked hopeful.
“Don’t worry about him either,” said Malfoy. “He won’t talk, he knows people come here for privacy.”
He skipped transfiguration and walked the long way to the non-existent floor near the Northern Tower, where there was a hidden room behind an invisible door in an inconspicuous stretch of wall.
“Just… you’re not alone in this, this is a
He would have worded it differently. Weasley shrugged.
“They’ve kicked you out, haven’t they?” said Potter.
From the day Harry arrives at the Burrow, Mrs Weasley is already fussing over the wedding and eventually everyone else gets caught up in the preparations too. Despite the oppressive darkness hanging over all of them, it really does promise to be a happy time, two small, golden weeks squeezed in between all the awfulness, and Harry is honestly looking forward to it.
He cleared his throat demonstratively and recited: “I swear that I am not plotting anything that will hurt you, your friends or anyone else. So you can stop stalking me now.”
Draco groaned.
“I don’t think it’ll be enough to just kill the dementors,” said Draco carefully. “I think there might be something wrong with the place itself.”
“The dorms are for sleeping, they can find space elsewhere. And I’m tired.”
“It’s only a little past one,” Draco says. He’s gotten his voice back under control. He sounds cool, uncaring. Over it. “You’ve still got oceans of time to get your beauty sleep.”
Dragging himself out of bed that morning after barely an hour of sleep was without a doubt and by any measure the absolutely hardest thing Draco had ever put himself through. He had no focus. His thoughts slipped away from him halfway through every task. He had retied his tie three times. He would have to inhale unreasonable amounts of coffee if he was to even make it to lunch. If he could find Boyle, he might be able to get his hands on some of that Weasley candy that would make you sick, but in that case he would have to coordinate with the Gryffindors – they might get the same idea, and it would look too suspicious if they all fell mysteriously ill at the same time. With a jerk of uneasiness, Draco remembered Granger. The fiendfyre explosion, the smell of burnt hair and flesh. The clear cut image of Weasley picking her up when she collapsed, a burned arm in a singed sleeve dangling limply back and forth. He remembered other things from the night before as well, but each memory was like that: visceral, disjointed, the space between them blank or foggy. He couldn’t even recall how they had gotten from the island to the school.
“Thanks,” he said.
“What?” he asked, worried for a second that he hadn’t caught on to the sarcasm, an apology already on his lips.
“But did you see how he was just laughing at it? He didn’t even pretend it was an accident!”
was being stupid? You were the one who mentioned the aurors.
Pansy nodded, looking uncertain too.
“Oh,” he said. “Right.”
"Yeah, that's why I came," Harry said. "I've had it since the war, and I just figured, you know, after our talk, that I should probably give it back."
When he looked up, Potter’s smile had faded.
He turned away, walked to the side of the room and sat down on the edge of a table. He rubbed his face in his hands, pressing his fingers hard against his eyes. Shapes in odd colours danced on the inside of his eyelids.
. Even if it wasn’t all his fault everything that happened, that doesn’t change what it’s done to him. There is nothing left in him that’s worth saving or forgiving.”
Draco nodded and stepped away from him. He waved quickly and then walked the last few feet down to the marker that meant he was outside the area under the anti-apparition spell.
Harry hesitated. He tried to think it through, past the total absurdity of the idea, of this conversation, but he was too tired, his mind too sluggish. And then he decided not to think about it, because fuck it.
"No!"
It’s fifth year all over again.
“Firewhisky. It’s cheap and terrible; I had to buy it off one of the sixth years. If I’d been able to get a bottle from home or at least go into Hogsmeade or something – but of course we’re not drinking for the taste, so just swallow it fast. And I’m already not quite sober, so don’t hold back.”
“Would you like me to tell your head of house what we talked about?”
He’s instructed not to leave the house, so he doesn’t. He’s invited to eat with them, but he doesn’t. Not just because of Potter, he likes to think he could have managed it if it was just Potter. But there’s a reason Draco wasn’t in Gryffindor. In fact, in this house of people fighting back, knowing what it might cost them, all of them willing to sacrifice themselves for a greater good, doing what is right rather than what is easy, he settles into what might be the first true narrative he has ever spun around himself: that he really is a coward. That he has never done anything but what was easy, the things that were made easy for him, walking the road that other people have paved, and being praised for walking it. So he doesn’t eat with them, because he is spineless and there is no way he could stay that long in a room where less than half the people in it are able to look at him. He deserves it, of course, but he would be punishing them as much as himself if he stayed.
“Fine.”
“There was that poem in there about “the nature of the spell”,” said Granger, pointing to the book. “I thought that might help, but it can take years of work to alter a spell, especially one as old as the patronus charm...”
“What, I don’t want to fool around with you, so now I’m ugly?”
“You should have moved abroad if you wanted to start over.”
, people use this corridor, they’re going to see you,” said Pansy.
“We need to talk,” he said.
, Draco. I can’t believe you actually did it - I’ve told you about a million times that you need to get over him!"
“Do you and Neville want to leave first? Luna and I will go in a bit.”
“Right,” said Potter. “Sure. Tomorrow.”
Blaise laughed. Draco wasn't sure if he had heard her or if it was just from the expression on Draco's face. Pansy could be terribly intimidating when she wanted to. Sometimes he wished he had stuck with more compliant friends. He pushed back his chair and stood up.
“Try it again. Maybe with a different memory.”
Draco crossed his arms as he looked around at his housemates. As much as he admired Harry’s friends for their loyalty, their decision to sit with him and Pansy didn’t really go well with the plan of being discreet until the affair with Azkaban had blown over.
Potter looked at the others.
“Sure,” he said, and managed to sound bored and unconcerned.
Harry explained. He walked Malfoy through the incantation, the wand-movement, both fairly simple, and Malfoy listened attentively and copied him easily. He didn’t protest at all until Harry started on the need to concentrate for single happy memory.
Harry reached out and pulled Draco in, for a short moment clutching him tightly and Draco could hear him breathing right next to his ear. It was just that brief moment of panicked closeness, then he let him go and quickly got to his feet like it hadn’t happened. Draco looked past him when he stood up to where Granger was standing, her face illuminated by Harry’s patronus. She was staring at him, comprehension dawning on her face.
“You didn’t know about Dean and Seamus,” she guessed.
she said, blocking his curse.
She paused as if she was expecting some sort of reaction, but he didn’t say anything. She folded her hands in front of her on the desk with a small sigh.
“Should I leave?” he asked, when Harry remained silent.
“Sure, I’m not doing much this week anyway." Or any other week, for that matter. He definitely didn't have a "busy schedule". So whatever, if Malfoy wanted to see him, he could do that. "Thursday?” he said.
“I’m not a Gryffindor.”
If this were 5
“I still don’t think it’s an issue. We can easily sneak by them, and if Malfoy drew his shitty maps correctly then we’ll just post guards where we talked about and we’ll have the strategic advantage and the element of surprise on our side,” said Ginny, rattling off her arguments in a way that made it clear they had had this conversation before.
“I know.”
"By what?"
And nothing happened. Not even a wisp of silver. Malfoy lowered his wand.
“Right, so sometimes I’ve been walking around the corridors at night. Apparently Potter was doing the same thing and I’ve run into him a couple of times.”
“Who?”
She was fuming.
“Watch where you’re going, you idiot-“ Draco hissed, but then he stopped himself.
"Like the Ministry cares about that! There's an apparition point in an alley at the other end of the street, why on earth wouldn't you use it?"
“Well,” he said. “Well, it… wasn’t the first time.”
"Tell that to them,” he said. “They like to come check for themselves. They like to make absolutely sure that there are no muggles around who might have seen -  they'll check all the cupboards and turn over all the furniture to make sure no one is hiding in there. They’re a very thorough bunch. Last time they took my kettle. It was noisy so I'd put a silencing spell on it.
Draco nodded and hurried past the counter, shooting Chris an icy glare that went tragically unnoticed. He slipped into the back and pushed his bag into an empty spot in the corner, shrugging off his coat and folding it on top.
“Thanks, Harry.”
“Yeah, it’s good,” said Weasley. “Big enough to hold all of us, and if we push back the furniture, I think there’ll be space for practising spells.”
Draco shrugged.
“I heard them. I think you could have handled it better.”
It was her fault that they were here. She had made this decision, she had pressed the Ministry about it, pulled strings, bribed whoever she needed to and ignored every single one of Draco’s protests. He had been so angry with her ever since he got her letter. But he still reached for her hand. She flinched when his fingers brushed hers, but then she took his hand and held on. They shouldn’t have come here. If she had another breakdown, he wasn’t sure she would recover. He cast another glance over the edge. It was such a long way down.
When it was fifteen minutes past the time he had asked him to come, Draco started to think that he probably hadn’t seen the message. He decided to give him at least an hour to notice it.
It came out harder than he had intended. Again there was that pregnant pause.
"You think that's what I'm doing? I couldn't keep sitting around the Manor waiting for things to go back to normal, Pansy. They are
“Why are we sitting up here?” he asked.
“No. I don’t. He doesn’t.”
“So why didn’t you tell them?” said Potter.
“Yeah,” he said. “You?”
“I think I’ve had enough, thank you.”
“So this is a bit… unfamiliar,” she continued.
"Right," Harry said.
Harry bit his lip.
He had thought the stack of books she had gathered was pretty big, but if that was everything relevant she had been able to find in the whole library, it wasn’t a lot. She might have searched too narrowly and he was about to tell her that, when she pushed a piece of parchment across the table towards him.
"Alright."
“Don’t look so worried,” she said when he stood in front of her. “You’re not in trouble. I want to talk to you, but this is not an ideal time. Do you think you could come by my office after dinner this evening? Eight thirty should be a good time.”
It only took him a couple of minutes to realize that the books was… strange, to say the least. Practically unreadable if one was in a less generous mood. The first few pages were perfectly bearable and resembled the sort of texts they had found in their textbooks for defence against the dark arts. But as soon as the author had gotten past those initial stretches, the book spun off into some indecipherable musings about – either the darkness of the world or of the human mind, though he wasn’t certain if it was supposed to be metaphorical or if this was someone’s actual attempt at describing the physical effects of the dementor. He gave up understanding it halfway through his second reading of the passage. He turned the page, trying to steel himself with patience, and found that the following chapter was written in verse.
“Thank you, that is
Blaise still lingered.
“But that isn’t why you broke up with her.”
Malfoy laughed. He had that dishevelled air about him again. As soon as they had stopped talking about Azkaban he had relaxed. It was easier to like him like this.
“But now you’ve come back,” McGonagakk continued. “A week later than expected – and you don’t look very well.”
"Malfoy do you… do you not have a wand?" he asked.
Malfoy’s mouth twisted irritably as he blew another breath of smoke into the room, not bothering to turn to the window this time.
Granger looked at him and suddenly her eyes were cold. He felt the others grow tense around him.
of things were odd. And then - it was weird to think that they didn't
"I can't believe I… Sorry. For making you do this."
Granger looked for a second like she was considering hexing him too, but then she just rolled her eyes at them and slung her bag over her shoulder.
Granger leaned forward in her chair.
“Whatever pleases you, Potter. I never thought you had much interest in doing anything the Slytherin way.”
“So you were hoping to get some alone time with Loony and Longbottom?”
“What do you have in mind?” said Harry grudgingly.
“I don’t know why you would think that.”
What had he been thinking dragging him down here without warning? Why had he thought the boggart would be a good idea? Why on earth had he decided to hold his hand? And then the bloody
“I think it does?” said Hermione.
He looked at her tired face, and then at Ron, who mirrored her worried, sympathetic expression.
“Fine,” said Draco, annoyed that his achievement was being so easily dismissed. “So what do you want me to do?”
There were torches mounted on the walls of the floors where the prisoners were kept. From the third floor down, the only light came from their patronuses and outside their reach, it was pitch black. There hadn’t been people this deep in Azkaban for hundreds of years, and Harry realized he had been expecting cobwebs. There weren’t any.
"What?"
"I like to keep up."
"I need a cigarette," said Malfoy suddenly.
Harry glared at him. Malfoy cleared his throat.
“We’re late. Maybe they didn’t think we were coming.”
Harry crossed his arms, mirroring Ron. He was tired and he wanted to sleep, but there was a thought that had been nagging him ever since he got on the tube.
When he'd first thought of it, he'd expected it would be a matter of a couple of weeks to get his things in order, but the bureaucracy had turned out to be endless. He'd even gone back to the Manor again for a short period of time, while he'd waited for his papers to go through. The Ministry was in disarray ever since the war had ended. They were still flushing out Voldemort sympathizers; suddenly everything needed to be reformed, and every procedure went even slower than it normally did as they struggled to get things back on track. There were all sorts of paperwork needed to apply for jobs in the muggle world, as well as for becoming eligible for renting a place to live, numbers and signatures he needed in order to even be considered an existing human being in muggle society. And there had been interviews too, and more instances than he could count of people telling him that it really wasn't recommended for people of purely magical background to attempt integration into muggle society, that the cultural shock might be more than he could handle, especially when he didn't have any close contacts who were muggle or muggle-born, and that the process itself was quite complicated because of the statute of secrecy, which was why it was usually reserved for squibs, and it would really be easier for him to just move to a wizarding society abroad.
“Please do,” said Weasley.
"You're sure you're not going to start drama?" Blaise asked, sounding more hopeful than concerned.
"About yesterday."
Granger handed the book to Lovegood.
He fought hard to suppress his smile at that and for a second it looked like she was about to laugh about it too, but then she got control of herself.
“Yeah, patronus work. So I’ll have to do this later.”
“Yeah, I know. Goodnight.”
“What are we going to do about the aurors?” Draco asked, gesturing to the four unconscious people on the floor.
“Right, you used to stay at the school, didn’t you?”
Harry closed his eyes.
“I was with Malfoy. We’re still working on his patronus charm.”
He tries to soak up Ron’s good mood. He yields to his badgering and uses
“Your arrogant arsehole thing – you can’t honestly think you’ve got any reason to act like you’re better than the rest of us anymore.”
“What?” he asked.
“I talked to her the other day. She came up to me after Herbology and said that she was very sorry for making up names about me and that she wouldn’t be mean to me while we were in the DA together, but if I didn’t like having her around, she would do her best to avoid me.”
"I guess I'll have to," he said.
“You might have noticed that you’re the only one so far who has made any demands as to what our truce is going to entail,” he said.
“You mean to tell me you have not imperiused him or slipped him a love potion and that he was actually acting of his own free will this morning?” he said. “Come on, Draco, in what world have you and Potter ever been friends?”
“Right,” said Potter.
Some third year boy Draco didn’t really know – a Zabini, one of Blaise’s more distant cousins – stopped dead in his tracks a few feet from the Slytherin table, staring at the trio like one might look at a blast-ended screwt if it decided to join for breakfast.
"Fine, then. I can't believe this is happening."
“She loves worrying about me.”
“Malfoy, can you maybe dim the light a bit?” asked Granger nervously from somewhere behind them.
“You hate me,” he said, sounding indignant and childish, and hating himself for it. “You’ve hated me for no reason since our first day of school. You decided you were better than me because of something that happened to you when you were a baby, and you chose Weasley over me just to spite me, thinking you could do whatever the hell you wanted because you were Harry Potter.”
"If we go to a pub, I'm going to get extremely pissed and be pathetic," Draco said severely. "I don't want people to talk."
“No, it’s okay,” he said. “I’ll meet you downstairs.”
“We thought you were dying,” said Granger.
Potter glanced down at a shabby piece of parchment he was carrying and hesitated a second too long.
“We should probably stop them,” said Longbottom.
She was crying now.
During lunch, Potter – Harry – had caught Draco’s eye across the Hall and jerked his head in a quick nod before he turned away, which Draco took to mean that his friends had not been too suspicious of his nightly disappearance, and that it was still a secret. Which was, of course, a good thing.
Draco is sitting on one of the desks, a book in his lap - how early did he get there? He doesn’t notice it when Harry comes in, and for a moment Harry watches him and finds that he looks innocent like that. He looks normal, just a 15-year-old boy reading quietly to himself in an empty classroom. He doesn’t actually resemble the corrupt, perverted creature Harry thinks of both of them as when they meet like this. Then Draco raises his head as if he knew Harry was there all along, as if he wanted to let him watch and think himself unnoticed. He doesn’t smile, but he puts the book away.
“Would you mind not telling Ron about it?” he asked.
“Go ahead.”
The tight grip on Harry’s lungs loosened.
“I’m going to tell them. I am. They’re my friends. They won’t mind.”
“Yeah,” she said.
After dinner Harry, Ginny, Ron and Dean headed down to the quidditch pitch. Hermione came with them, and Seamus had been immersed in a debate with Ron and Ginny about British quidditch teams, so he walked some of the way with them too, but before they even reached the hallway, the discussion had become exclusively Ron and Ginny’s. Dean and Seamus were sending each other significant looks behind their backs when Ron started accusing Ginny of disloyalty:
Potter grimaced.
“Pretty sure it was mostly my fault.”
And then after a moments hesitation he added:
He grimaced.
“Bye, Pansy,” he said.
She left. There was a moment of silence before Longbottom stood up.
“Then why did you meet today if he’s already figured it out?”
“Mr Malfoy,” she said and he stopped. “Would you mind coming up here for a second?”
“And now you think I’ll come crawling to you, the saviour of the fucking wizarding world, and ask for your forgiveness because you think I
Draco shrugged. Granger nodded again more to herself this time.
“So you won’t come.”
“Sure.”
that is-“
His audience dissolved and walked away as if nothing had happened. He watched them leave, but too many people blocked his view for him to be able to tell what was going on around Potter. He stood up and found his wand. He mumbled a cleaning charm to get the mud out of his hair and face.
Draco shrugged.
He heard Daphne speaking softly, he couldn’t make out the words, but the others laughed. He was shaking when he reached the stairs. His fingers twitched, he wanted to strangle someone, to beat holes through the walls, and he was going to explode from forcing himself not to stomp up the steps – he was out of sight, but they might still hear him. He couldn’t even slam the door to their dorm, but as soon as it clicked shut behind him he had his wand out.
Immediately, words spread across the paper:
Potter grinned and slumped into the seat next to Draco as if he had never hesitated by the door at all. As if this was something they did all the time. He sighed as he sank into the cushions.
“I’ll go upstairs,” she said. “I’m wrecked.”
can be helped – that’s practically all they’ve been doing for the last seven years. I’m afraid it has become a habit to all of them.”
“Your mother already thanked me,” Harry said.
“Malfoy, can I talk to you?” she asked.
Draco was making his way to the owlery. A breath of cold air brushed against his skin as he reached the top of the stairs, the scent of coming winter was in the air and mixed with the smell of the owls. It was too dark to see any but the nearest birds, but the soft rustling of their feathers gave a sense of the hundreds of animals in the room. They swooped in and out the glassless windows, hunting on the Hogwarts grounds and returning with their prey. He crossed the straw-covered floor and headed towards one of the openings in the wall, an empty archway facing the lake. He had only just sat down on the ledge when he thought he heard the sound of footsteps. Someone else was coming up the stairs. He swore under his breath. Of course he didn’t expect to be the only one who had designated this particular corner of the school to be their place of privacy, but no one was supposed to be there now.
“No you can’t, there’s not enough space.”
“Because we’ll have to cooperate, right? That was your idea too, wasn’t it, Harry?”
It was easy to be with him now, he supposed. They had found a way of talking to each other so that they could joke and be friendly while steering clear of all the mess that was still there. But whenever he left after talking to him, he was always confused, always frustrated, like the whole time there was something he had been missing. Like he had thought when they were together that one thing was going on, that they were practicing the patronus charm for example, and then when he left he had the sense that it wasn’t about that at all. Something else had been going on, and he should have noticed it. It wasn’t that he suspected Malfoy of anything. He thought maybe it had more to do with himself. It was just a feeling.
Still, Ron has made it, Hermione has made it, and despite his guilt about pulling them into this, he is so grateful that they’re coming with him. They settle in at the Burrow, Harry in Ron’s room, Hermione in Ginny’s.
She nodded again, but didn’t say anything. Her lips were pressed together and she had her arms crossed tightly across her chest. He could see her swallow hard.
Harry waited for him at the top of the marble staircase.
"Shit," Harry breathed.
“I already told you we wouldn’t mind,” said Hermione.
“Goodnight, professor McGonagall.”
"No one is saying that, but you shouldn't apparate home at fuck knows what hour of the night if you've been drinking since nine!"
“Did you find the source?” asked Ginny, calling Harry’s attention away from Ron and Hermione.
“He had a claim on me too,” he continued. “Because of the prophecy. And my scar. Do you know about the horcruxes?”
“Shit,” he said. “You have really good friends, Harry.”
“Yeah, but we can’t really tell him not to bring her, can we? I mean, there’s already six of us and just two of them, so it wouldn’t be fair,” said Neville.
He jumped from the seat and the four of them pushed out of their compartment into the crowded centre aisle.
"Okay."
Draco stood rooted to the spot and watched them go.
“No idea.”
Draco groaned.
“Sort of. Ginny, Neville and Luna do.”
Potter turned his back to him and picked up his things.
“Nott?” he asked, without looking up from the letter in his hands. “Do you remember the name of that sixth year who says he can smuggle anything in?”
“And the others are of age. They don’t want to go, Dora.”
"Alright," he said, with a shrug.
“There’s a difference between being brave and breaking rules for the fun of it,” said Harry.
“Take that back,” he said evenly.
“I think something is up with Malfoy,” said Harry.
"We need to leave," she said quietly, insistently. "Come on. Now, Emma!"
“No one’s here.”
“Can we see?”
It had been a long time since he last dreamt of Azkaban.
“But you have told them, right? Not just hinted at it, but actually told them?”
It’s the same as always: Of course he won’t go, he doesn't need to, doesn't want to. And in the end he does anyway, but he stops by the bathroom first to wrap toilet paper around his stinging, bleeding hand.
"He seemed nice," Harry offered.
They weren’t looking at each other. Draco was growing more rigid by the second. The cold wind coming through the openings in the walls was biting at his neck and face as if to remind him what the creatures had felt like.
Ron grinned.
"Sorry," he said. "'M drunk."
Lovegood turned over a piece of parchment to a sketch of a dot labelled
“Are you… How is your balance? You hit your head when you fell.”
Draco smiled and watched his patronus as the snake coiled in the air. It was beautiful. Looking at it made him feel slightly dizzy, though. He recalled the way it had snapped in the darkness of Azkaban. And hadn’t there been a moment where he stopped recasting it? Draco blinked as a sudden memory washed over him of dementors crowding close around him, Harry screaming his name before he disappeared from view, that moment of total darkness and complete cold – Draco’s hand was shaking slightly. He was still watching his patronus, he was still in the commonroom, but he didn’t like the way the shadows in there seemed to be getting taller, looming – he had wanted to die in the pit. He had looked at the dementors and felt nothing but fear and sadness and he had wanted to die. And then the doe had appeared. Harry’s patronus. Harry’s
“Are you feeling better, sweetheart?” she asked. “Do you think you’re ready to go home?”
He had been making out with Potter, that was what had just happened, and for a split second, he was tempted to simply tell them that. He felt reckless and elated, but all their eyes were on him and he could feel Pansy’s nerves quivering from across the room.
She cut herself off. They all fell quiet.
Her quiet huff sounded odd and distorted over the phone.
Harry’s eyes widened.
"Okay, sure, how was it?"
“So we can’t keep time?”
Malfoy closed the door after the man when he left.
Draco grimaced.
“But why would he be sneaking around the entrance to Gryffindor?”
“Harry?” said Hermione.
He was boiling.
Potter interrupted again:
“That was long ago.”
“Did that hurt?” she asked.
“We won’t have to.”
“You knew it was there,” he says. “So why did you- did you just want to make sure? Figured you could bear fooling around one last time, you know, get a chance to feel around…“
He wants to touch him, just for a second. Tonight, Potter doesn’t look angry or vengeful; he just looks tired, worn down. It’s too easy to forget in this quiet corner of the house that they aren’t really alone, that there are Weasleys and Order members on every floor below them, that they aren’t kids anymore and the things they do now matter.
“You should, I’m your friend, remember? You don’t have as many of those as you used to.”
Longbottom and Lovegood were the furthest away from them, but he was interested in seeing what they were like in a fight. He couldn’t make out most of their verbal spells over the noise Potter and Weasley were making, but there was something clumsy about their pace. Longbottom wasn’t fast, but his spells were still much more frequent than Lovegood’s. He was pretty sure she was stepping out of the way more than she was deflecting his attacks, so his aim had to be pretty bad even if there was a heavy force behind his magic that Draco wouldn’t have expected – he had been calling him a squib for years, which seemed ridiculous now. But then Longbottom had never performed like that in a classroom. Then Lovegood raised her voice and the complicated string of words carried all the way to where Pansy and Draco were standing. There was a flash of purple light, her robes billowed around her and her blond hair rose in a white cloud. Longbottom didn’t even try to cast a protection spell, he just threw himself down on the ground to get out of the way as the spell passed over him.
“I thought we were pretending that didn’t happen,” he snapped.
They were on a low hill and could see heath stretching out all around them. It was a bright, clear night and the moon was almost full. There were no houses in sight, only small groves of trees breaking up the landscape. He assumed they must be somewhere in the English countryside and could probably place it more precisely if he found out which one of Harry’s people had picked the place. It was perfect for their intentions – no one for miles to see the light from their spells and they would have to be very loud before anyone would hear them. He turned around and saw the rest of their group getting to their feet from where they had been sitting while they waited for the Slytherins.
She sighed, loud enough that he could hear it as a crackling rush over the telephone.
“If you say so. But I still feel sorry for you, mate – I’m glad it's not me who's going to be locked up with the stupid git until he figures out how to cast a patronus.”
Pansy giggled and Draco glared at her. Since Granger and Weasley had both sat down next to Pansy, Harry had taken the place next to him. Which should have been fine. Draco had hit him and kissed him and slept next to him, and the four inches between them on the bench shouldn’t have been a problem at all, yet somehow they seemed more drastic than anything that had come before. It was very public proximity, and though the intentions of the Gryffindors might be good, he knew they wouldn’t get away with it. It was too big and too sudden a disturbance of the fragile truce in the school. Pansy sipped her coffee, and Weasley buttered his toast, and Draco sat rigidly in his seat, decidedly not looking at Harry and bracing himself for the moment when someone would break the silence of pretend normalcy and ask them what the fuck was going on.
"Hey Draco, I know that was some odd shit before but we're pretty busy in here, so could you maybe hurry up?"
“I know. I did.”
“I think I’ll go up too. Do you want to come, Ginny?”
“So what are you doing for Christmas?” asked Draco.
“I know.”
Harry froze.
He stopped in front of a cell just a few paces ahead.
Potter looked weirdly at him. Draco shouldn’t have mentioned it. He’d just wanted some leverage, but dredging up that awful moment was definitely uncalled for.
He stopped talking. He was just making it worse.
"So I'll wait."
Draco’s heart skipped a beat.
“Potter?” she said. “What on earth are you-“
"Leave him alone, Chris," said Irie, appearing from the back room. "Draco, just go get an apron, we open in five."
And the subject was dropped, so Harry decided not to ask which form Malfoy thought his patronus would take.
it said beneath his sour expression.
“Sorry, didn’t see you there,” said Potter, fixing his glasses on his nose.
“…unfortunately we only have dried petals of monkshood, where usually the fresh ones are preferred. Now the dried ones are just as effective, but it is critically important that you use exactly seven petals and it is a lot easier to tell if the they’re intact or if some have been crumpled into each other when they’re fresh than when dry, so be extremely careful. That is all, so come up here and gather your ingredients, and let us get started.”
“We- I didn’t think it was a good idea to tell you because I knew you would all want to go before we were ready.”
The soft silver glow flowed out around him and condensed into the shape of an animal that bolted forwards, pushing itself between the dementors until Draco came back into view. He stood as he had when Harry lost sight of him, stiff and frozen with his arms hanging down his sides, but as the dementors pulled back, he turned to look at the patronus. Slowly and with a dazed expression, he put his hand against it’s side. Harry’s breath was fast and shallow, his heart still pounding away. There was a strange buzz in the fingertips on his wand hand, like a mild electrical current. The edge of his vision was blurry, making the apparition in front of him even more unreal. The second patronus was a dream thing, bright and warm and safe, yet he couldn’t really believe it was there, even when he was looking right at it, even as Draco ran a hand over the silver fur. It wasn’t a stag either; it had no antlers.
She nodded and left.
The sleekness had faded from his voice. Harry hesitated.
“Harry, it’s not nothing.”
Harry had been there for maybe three minutes and he already wanted to punch him.
“Why?” asked the other Weasley aggressively, stepping up to his sister.
Harry slammed the front door behind him and kicked off his shoes next to the troll-leg umbrella stand (Ron had insisted they keep it). Harry was two steps up the stairs when he heard movement from the living room.
"I didn't ask."
He started at the loud pop when Harry came back with Granger. Then she went back for Ron who went back for Lovegood and soon all seven of them were gathered on the coast, four of them holding broomsticks. They looked out towards the sea, maybe searching for a glimpse of the tower, even though they knew they wouldn’t be able to see it.
“How was it different?”
"You're late, Draco!" Chris snapped at him the second Draco stepped through the glass doors.
“Hermione?” he said finally.
Harry looked at the closed door and thought that maybe he did too. He knew better than to think a spell was easy just because Hermione made it look that way, but it still seemed like there should be more to erasing someone’s memories than that. She had just saved Hermione’s life, and they hadn’t even thanked her. They hadn’t bothered asking her to keep it secret.
“Charlie is gay?” Harry interrupted. “Your brother?”
“Everybody knows about that one.”
“I’m trying to be your friend and-“
Draco had his eyes turned to the floor, not really seeing it, but he could still feel Potter watching him. Then he heard him move. His footsteps coming closer, and then he was next to him, leaning against the edge of the table. Not close enough that they touched, but close enough that he imposed on Draco’s space. He didn’t say anything. They watched the wallpaper on the opposite wall for a while.
"I do not-"
okay. Fuck. We should go after her-“
They laughed. Dean yawned.
“No, I-“
“Because you haven’t done this before. It’s
Draco nodded stiffly.
“No, I meant just flying. We could go over the forest or try to make it to the mountains?”
"It should only take five minutes to get there. Is that alright?"
“Have you seen Pansy?” he asked them.
They both looked at him as if they had forgotten he was there.
“Okay,” he said.
"Amazing. I would have sworn neither of you even knew the meaning of being discreet," Malfoy said, taking another drag of his cigarette and blowing the smoke out the window.
Draco laughed.
She tore her eyes from the man in the cell and they began moving again. Draco checked his watch – they had only lost a couple of minutes.
He sounded spiteful and hated himself for it. It was such a kind gesture. He knew that was how Potter meant it – platonically. An offer of comfort. Why the hell did he feel the need to mock it?
Harry shrugged.
He hadn’t really expected to get any sleep at all, but he must have drifted off, because he was woken by someone gently shaking his shoulder.
He had asked Hermione about the book after she had finally managed to get a hold of Malfoy, and she had told him it was a miss.
This time it was after dinner on Saturday evening in the same secret room that they had used before. It was dark out and the glass in the windows was black and mirror-like. Draco had taken up a seat in the corner, sitting half in shadows. He spoke quietly and even breathed carefully, trying to take up as little space as possible. He tried to be polite enough for the both of them, because Pansy would bite back her venomous words when he had asked her to, but she would not apologize for her presence. If he wanted friendly cooperation, it was all on him.
“I guess,” he said.
“Of course you do," she said sweetly. "So what happened? How did it go?”
A second fist caught him in the stomach and he doubled over. He inhaled sharply. He gasped and grabbed and managed to yank at Potter’s knee and push him backwards with his shoulder. Potter lost his balance and fell hard on his back, dragging Draco down with him. He landed on top of Potter, and they rolled on the floor, trying to keep the other down, to land a punch, while their legs got tangled in their robes.
“I was really sceptical about that part, but the more I think about it… I mean, obviously the research is lacking, but there does seem to be some sort of consensus that the dementors are…
Pansy let herself fall into the seat across from him as if exhausted.
Ron and Harry ate their toast and Harry made more tea. A little while later Hermione's voice called to them from upstairs:
“It’s fine, Harry.”
“That’s not what I meant. I think it was great back then, when we needed it, but we don’t anymore. We need to learn how to not be at war.”
She sighed.
“This is… oh, God,” said Granger weakly. “How can they do this?”
it is,” he said. “I don’t need to talk to any muggle healers. I am perfectly fine.”
”I know, but we’re not that old either. You said your mother was with you in Azkaban. She saw how horrible it was, she saw all the same things you did, but does she want to destroy it?”
“She’s been a bit off lately.”
“Isn’t it time you knocked that off?” said Potter.
He sounds wholly unsurprised by Harry’s presence.
Of course, it could be worse. It had been worse.
His voice came out an off-pitch croak. Potter's eyes snapped back to Draco's face. He dropped his hand.
“I thought so too,” Harry said, not even bothering to hide the bitterness.
He nodded, she stood up and they left the common room, promising to be back in a second.
“Yes, I suppose we should,” he said.
He was slightly out of breath. He looked dishevelled, his hair pulled back in a messy ponytail and his shirt crinkled like it had been left on the floor overnight. And he was wearing jeans - apparently there was not going to be an end to the absurdity any time soon.
Draco flinched. Hermione looked like she wanted to break his nose, and maybe he remembered that she almost did once. He drew himself up.
He shrugged.
Malfoy smirked.
“That’s considerate of you.”
“He’s deserted Voldemort, Ron, he’s in as much danger as-“
He explained his theory again, the one he had previously presented to Potter, that Azkaban had somehow turned itself into a blind spot, unwatchable and unquestionable, that no one could hold in their mind for too long at a time. Granger listened carefully. Twice she noted something down on her parchment.
“Now go,” she said.
"No. That's fine," Harry said. "You smoke?"
“I asked you a question.”
“See you all at breakfast.”
“Draco, seriously, can we stop the political briefing for a moment?”
“Is that what you think is going to happen? We’ll fight about it?”
“I asked if we were going to do group duels?”
"You should come by tomorrow. I haven't seen you in forever.”
“You wouldn’t understand.”
He turned to Hermione: “It’s not like you weren’t pissed when you found out I’d been flying with him – I was just talking to him then, I didn’t even like him, and you said he was emotionally amputated, that he wasn’t worth forgiving-“
“Holy shit,” repeated Malfoy, looking back over the shoulder.
“I never thought I’d be here again,” he said.
“I wouldn’t want to wake them up,” said Harry.
Ron’s eyebrows shot up.
“Well, you asked me to tell Draco to meet you up here, so I thought you had probably found something, and I decided to come by and help.”
Draco had read all the letters and comments himself that morning, but he didn’t interrupt her. This was more than they had dared hope for.
“That’s not possible,” he said.
“Asleep, as far as I can tell,” he said, still speaking barely above a whisper. “I think they do actually cast silencing charms on the drapes…”
She sat on the edge of the sofa, her arms resting on her knees and what looked like all of her notes spread out on the table in front of her. A couple of the books lay open too, with the strange one at the centre. She looked up when he came in.
The two girls were duelling like it was the final battle of the war. Lovegood and Granger had stepped back and stood uncertainly on the edges of the fight, their wands down. Pansy and Ginny whirled around each other, their cloaks whipped about by the superfluous energy from missing spells, shield spells were cast with furious cries and there was determined anger on both their faces.
"I'm tired."
“Go wake up Pomfrey, then,” said Ron’s disembodied voice.
fucking tired and all I want to do is sleep, I just
"What the fuck are you doing here?" Draco snapped.
“Well, actually there is no rule that you have to sit at your house table,” said Granger in a polite voice she probably hadn’t meant to be condescending.
Ginny shrugged.
He leaned over the table and reached for the flowers of henbane that had been laid out.
Potter twisted the knob and pulled open the door, Draco cut himself off midsentence. He raised his wand, opened his mouth to speak the incantation, then stopped. He heard the sound of low, rattling breath. He felt a brush of cold. A rotting hand grasped the edge of the wardrobe door, pushing it all the way open, and the dementor glided out.
“You’re leaving?” he asked.
“Oh, well I don’t think
“Because you’re the only one who would have thought of it, and your head’s been full of N.E.W.T’s,” said Ron.
Draco shrugged.
"What?"
“But what if something happened to you and you let the patronus go out?”
Lupin is the last one still awake in the evening when Harry finally heads upstairs. He can hear him in the kitchen. There’s a sound of cabinets opening, the clink of glass.
“The dreams are bad too,” said Harry.
Malfoy ate quickly and as far as Harry could tell from across the Great Hall, he wasn’t talking to anyone. But he didn’t leave until Pansy Parkinson and Tracey Davis stood up first, and then he followed them out. He was about to point this out to the others when he caught Hermione looking at him disapprovingly.
“No,” Harry says.
Harry raised an eyebrow at that.
They had stopped, the others disappearing out of sight ahead of them.
“I’ve been here a while. My patronus is pretty steady. And anyway you don’t get the ones up there to go down here unless it’s absolutely necessary.”
Harry stays at Hogwarts for the funeral, then spends his last summer with the Dursleys. It’s slightly more bearable when he can keep in the back of his mind that he will never have to see them again. Or maybe it’s just that he can’t bring himself to care about their petty neglect and contempt after everything that’s happened. He keeps to himself in his room, scouring the papers for news of Voldemort, reading and re-reading obituaries on Dumbledore. He goes for walks around the neighbourhood on the days when the house is making him crazy, on nights when he can’t sleep. The pain of losing Dumbledore dulls to a slow, consistent ache, only to flare up occasionally, threatening to drag him into a pit of despair. But he carries the locket with him at all times now, letting it remind him of what lies ahead, what he has to do. He doesn’t have the luxury of letting himself fall apart, so he doesn’t. He stays at Privet Drive and he waits for the Order to come pick him up.
"It's the truth, and you know it,” he said. “Now pull yourself together and stop being a spoilsport."
NB: I know I have this story tagged as "no archive warnings apply", but I think this chapter does have somewhat graphic depictions of violence, so if anyone needs details on that or need to know what to skip, just let me know.
Harry didn’t answer him. He stirred his potion twice counter clockwise. Malfoy still didn’t leave. He just stood there across from him, as if he was expecting some sort of answer.
“I’m such an idiot,” breathed Malfoy.
Draco shrugged.
“Thanks,” said Harry.
“Hey,” said Harry, only turning to face Draco when the sound of Granger’s footsteps had disappeared above them and they were alone in the Entrance Hall.
"Did you apparate here?" said Malfoy.
“I guess you will. See you, Potter.”
Malfoy made a sharp turn down another street.
And Draco smiles the smallest of smiles.
Malfoy threw out his arms.
“It’s weirder that we’re still there.”
“You were the one defending him the last time we talked about this,” Harry snapped. “You brought up the Wizengamot-decision, you seemed all for forgiving him back then.”
“How are we supposed to kill the dementors?” asked Longbottom. “Is that even possible?”
"Hungover?"
“Malfoy!” she called.
Draco laughed nervously.
"Seems like you've really gotten the hang of it," Harry said, eyeing Malfoy's clothes.
“Right,” he said.
“About what?” Harry snaps. “What was that supposed to tell me, Malfoy? I just assumed you were as fucked up as I was, I didn’t have a bloody clue why I was doing any of it, I couldn’t talk to anyone about it, it’s not like
“It doesn’t make any difference.”
“Just taking a walk. Would you mind not pointing that thing at me?”
"Do you still play quidditch?" Malfoy finally asked, after a too long silence.
“I’m good with strange things, you know,” she said with a gentle smile that made him think suddenly that she might already know.
“What else were we supposed to do?”
Malfoy screwed up his face and looked towards the forest, where the trees were already shedding their leaves and stretching their naked, clawlike branches towards the clouds.
He pointed to a stack on the table. Draco nodded.
“We all had to find ways to survive last year, and some of us didn’t have the option of hiding in secret rooms and trying to save the world by putting stink-bombs in Snape’s office.”
when he passed him in the hall or heard his footsteps upstairs. It seems ridiculous now, of course. Who the hell would Malfoy have told? He doesn’t talk to anyone at the Burrow, just keeps to himself, and Harry was doing just fine ignoring him, pretending as if staying in the same house as him and Ginny while trying to focus on finding horcruxes wasn’t already a slow kind of torture. But now they’ve talked, and suddenly he’s impossible to ignore. It’s like they’re sharing a secret again, and now every time Malfoy comes down for meals, it’s like he sucks all the air out of the room, and Harry is feeling that awful pull again, feeling himself gravitating towards him, the way he did back at Hogwarts. He finds himself wishing for the thousandth time that he could go back and do things differently. He should have known even back then that it would come back to haunt him. He probably did know. Maybe that was the point. Maybe he had wanted to be haunted. Or maybe he just hadn’t really believed he would live past 15.
"Not sure we would. It's surprisingly easy, you know. Passing yourself off as muggle."
She leaned conspiratorially across the table and lowered her voice. Her eyes were bright and shining.
"Do you want to… I mean, if you'd like we could go have another beer. Somewhere else?"
“I didn’t mean that. There’s some other reason, isn’t there?”
There was a moment of hesitation where he thought it probably hadn’t worked, but then the patronus vanished and it was too late to regret the message.
Draco had the nauseating sensation of being able to feel his own brain contracting like a muscle as he heaved his occlumency barriers into place, and then he was alone in his head. The memories of the ancient wizard were gone and he was looking at the tip of a wand pointed between his eyes, and behind it, Hermione Granger. Then he buckled over and coughed out a mouthful of vomit. He had been throwing up in his mouth, he could feel how it had drippled down his chin.
She shook his hand.
She spoke in the calm, rehearsed tone of voice she used in class, and he felt pretty sure she had practised this conversation in her head.
“Oh,” said Neville. “Well, that’s…”
“At least they all believed what you said about Azkaban. Even Ginny, she said she was all for blowing it up.”
The air in the room was thick and stale. He really needed to open a window, let some air in. He wasn't sure he could move without throwing up.
Harry wakes on his seventeenth birthday with a tight feeling in his gut and a sense of looming disaster. It’s a familiar feeling, so similar to the constant restless fear of the vague threat of the mission ahead of them. Except this morning the general anxiety is accompanied by vein-crushing shame that makes it impossible for him to even look at Ron or anyone else offering congratulations.
He returned to the common room and tried to look busy as he made his way to his dormitory, so no one would try to talk to him. It seemed safer to keep interaction with other people to a minimum, as his ability to act normal felt pretty shaky.
“How long have you had this?” he asked incredulously.
“You don’t need a fucking explanation!”
Pansy shot him a long, bored stare.
“That’s not the point,” she said. “I don’t know what you’re up to or what you’ve told him to make him act like this, but if I see you near him, believe me I won’t hesitate to curse you.”
“No,” said Harry before Malfoy could say anything nasty. “Hermione, just go find Ginny.”
“Okay,” he said. “So we’re still doing it."
He had spent a lot of time thinking about the night in the secret room. Draco had drifted off as soon as Harry stopped talking, but Harry hadn’t been able to fall asleep. He had lain there in the darkness with his arm around him and listened to him breathing. It was easy to forget how warm people were until you were really close to someone else and then you were reminded what a miracle a living body is of muscles and veins and breath, little twitches and sounds.
“So should we get back to our common rooms?” he asked. “I’ll check if Pansy has killed anyone and you can go see if Granger still has her head or if Weasley has bitten it off.”
“She means Potter and Weasley and fucking
his head of house was, but the gesture reminded him of being taken into custody.
“Why not?”
“Nothing here makes sense! Space is wrong, time is wrong, did you see the condensation on the wall upstairs? The water was running
"Means copper," Harry said quickly. "It's uh… slang. Public school slang."
Harry shrugged, looking around the dormitory to Ron’s and Neville’s beds with the curtains drawn around them; Dean’s empty bed that he hadn’t slept in for quite a while now.
“Nightmares?”
“That’s because you and I have very different approaches to the purpose of making friends and going to school. My house mates are heirs to the houses of Zabini, Greengrass, Nott, Parkinson and Bulstrode, and since I am the heir to the house of Malfoy, I can’t just base my friendships on whether or not I like these people, since later in life, they will have to be my political allies or they will be my rivals. We all do better if we don’t fight each other, and it’s easier to be allies than friends. Did you honestly think it was a coincidence that every single major pureblood family has its oldest child in our year?”
“So they were ok with it?”
In the evening he received a letter from his mother in which she asked him to come home for the funeral.
"Weasley, then."
“Did you bring up the duelling club again?”
“Yes, well it can’t be removed. I’ve had quite a few visits to st. Mungo’s, and I got them to try everything short of cutting off my arm, but there was nothing they could do. I would have gone abroad to find some better healers when the English ones turned out to be incompetent, but my family hasn’t been allowed to leave the country.”
“Hermione-“
"I didn't say it would," he snapped. "I needed that talk, but that doesn't mean I'm coming back."
And Draco didn't get to ask what that was supposed to mean, because the key finally slotted into place and Potter pushed the door open. He stumbled inside and after a moment of hesitation, Draco followed. Potter was steadying himself with a hand against the wall. He looked like there was some risk of him throwing up again.
I cast my patronus, because I’m an idiot, and of course that didn’t help, so the boggart just went past me. And then it turned into Voldemort.”
She picked up her bag and slipped her notes into one of the schoolbooks.
“Look, it’s fine," he said, biting back the sharper words that were queuing up in his mind - Malfoy seemed to be actually trying to be civil, and Harry knew he would feel like an idiot later if he didn't at least try not to hex him. "I get that you want to-“
“It’s fine, no one will believe it was us,” said Harry.
"We did," he said.
He had, hadn't he?
“Don’t know. The hat said I would. It’s kind of hard to imagine.
“See you off,” he corrected her.
He had decided before leaving home that he would be quick and efficient about this - give Malfoy his wand, be civil, but leave as fast as possible without any unnecessary niceties. That resolve was quickly dissolving, and he found himself wanting badly to apologize for barging in like this, for looking at a room that he was obviously not supposed to see, but Malfoy was glaring at him, chin raised and eyes narrow, like he was daring him to say anything, so Harry didn't. He stepped out of his shoes and shrugged off his coat.
"I don't get why you're doing it, Draco. You don’t
“Before there were sides.”
Neville frowned.
“No,” she said. “I have not.”
Hermione choked, spilling tea on her plate. She coughed.
All in all, it looked very unimpressive.
She might have hit him, but Pansy wasn’t one for violence; she didn’t hurt people with anything but words. She turned around on her heel and marched away. She did not speak to him again.
It wasn't like he was a complete shut-in.
“Then don’t go,” he said, but carefully.
“Well, I’m going to go find Tracey. And I can’t believe I’m saying this, but I absolutely agree with Granger. You should leave Potter alone.”
"I don't read that," he said quickly. "Pansy must have left it here or something."
"One of what?"
Irie rolled her eyes.
Harry rested his arms on the table and leaned towards him.
“Merlin, Draco, would you calm down?”
, Hermione. Honestly. Just went to bed a bit late. I'll take a nap later."
“I wish we didn’t have to talk about this while I was trying to get a potion right. You realize I have to turn this in?”
“Why not?”
Draco grimaces, something between a grin and an eye roll, but he keeps his gaze fixed on the far corner of the room, as if turning his face away from Harry will keep him from noticing the tears in his eyes.
shouldn’t be first on the list. He wasn’t going to tell Malfoy that. He didn’t care what Malfoy did. But if he apologized one more time – well, there were limits to how long he would sit there and keep saying “it’s fine”.
“Go!” said Harry frantically somewhere far behind him.
"Yeah."
“How did you know that?”
“Maybe we should mix it up a bit? I’m already acquainted with Draco’s style and I suppose you might feel the same way about each other?”
Harry had eventually fallen asleep that night, but he was woken up by the other boys after what felt like only a few minutes of sleep. He dragged himself down to breakfast, already dreaming of classes being over so he could go back to bed. He seated himself at the Gryffindor table with Ron and Hermione. Hermione was complaining about how behind she was on homework, talking about assignments that Harry had forgotten even existed and had no chance what so ever of getting finished on time.
patronus.
“I’m trying not to be! You’re the one who’s freaking out.”
Draco pulled out his watch – it was hard to read it in the dark, but he was pretty sure it was only ten minutes past the time they had agreed upon. He was about to tell this to Pansy when she started violently and a strangled, high pitched sound escaped her throat. Draco had his wand out in a second, his heart pounding.
“Yes,” he said, catching himself quickly. “I read through it, though to be honest I’m not sure how much of it I understood. Maybe I should have reread it, but I was pretty exhausted so I went back to the dorms.”
Harry was pretty sure he hadn’t told anyone except Ron or Hermione about his grades.
Harry shrugged.
“I don’t like to,” he said.
She put it back on the table. The pages she had opened to showed an illustration of two beautifully calligraphed runes with no explanation except for a small notation next to them labelling them
“This isn’t-” he began, not quite looking at her.
They went flying again. Over the forest, almost to the mountains before they turned back. By then the days had gotten short and even though it wasn’t that late, dark had fallen and it felt like the middle of the night when they walked back to the castle. Draco listened to the sound of their footsteps as they made their way up to the hill. The air smelled of the coming frost. They were quiet – they had been yelling and howling when they flew, but now they walked silently almost shoulder to shoulder.
“Great, actually.”
“What did you fight about?”
“Aren’t you cold?” Draco asked him.
“And things have changed now?”
“Yes, of course I can see them,” he said. “Everyone can now. So that’s one less special ability for you, but I’m sure you’ll manage.”
“So what, you want all of us to be pals now? I can deal with him during the DA-meetings, or whatever they are, but I won’t pretend I like him.”
Slowly and with exaggerated care he placed the wand back in his pocket and held up his empty hands.
“Maybe it was! I did lots of things that weren’t noble or brave and they weren’t particularly cunning or ambitious either, but I know you walked into Dark Arts with all that spite and attitude because you were hoping they would make an example of you and not someone half your size. Did you ever think maybe we were doing the same thing when we volunteered? I didn’t volunteer to practice unforgiveables on first years because I liked it. But I thought that at least it was me and not Evelyn Selwyn. At least it was me and not another first year.”
“Can you speak?” asked Harry.
"Hope you don't mind," he continued, already walking away from Harry.
“Is this it?” he asked, speaking louder than he wanted to in order to be heard over the wind.
"I'm cursed," he sighed.
“I’m not the only one who’s going to notice if you keep meeting with him.”
Malfoy rolled his eyes.
The light turned green.
“Well he wouldn’t have given it to me if it wasn’t important,” Hermione insists.
"I should probably go," Draco said.
“Thanks,” he said and headed for the stairs.
Draco watched a group of drunk witches stagger down the street giggling loudly. He didn't notice the door to the pub opening until someone called out his name, startling him so much he nearly dropped his cigarette. When he turned around he saw Potter, of all people, making his way towards him. Draco was leaning against the wall only seven feet or so from the door, and Potter still managed to lose his footing on the cobbles twice, moving with the stumbling gracelessness of the thoroughly sloshed.
“I didn’t think I would hear that from you,” he said.
“But why would he give you a book of fairy tales?” Ron asks. “It doesn’t make sense.”
“Yes,” he said.
Several people from the other tables were stretching their necks to follow the scene.
She didn’t look halfway as impressed as he thought she ought to.
“I didn’t realize you’d turned them into your private militia,” Draco said, looking after them.
“How late are we?” asked Neville.
“Alright. But there’s no shame in it, you know. We all… It’s not easy for anyone.”
“Just give me a second to think, alright.”
Malfoy paused.
But he'd managed it eventually. He'd gotten his shitty little flat and a shitty job at a bar, which he'd thankfully replaced with a slightly less shitty job in a coffee shop. He'd learned how to use the tube and the phone, ignored the disapproving letters from his mother and settled into his new life. And it wasn't that bad. It was fine, as long as he didn't think too far ahead. He had his flat and his job, a couple of new friends, some contact with his old friends, but he knew he couldn't return to the wizarding world. He didn't have a muggle education either, and no hope of being approved for getting one. There was no way to move forward, and that thought was so hard to get rid of. Even on good days, it was there, constantly nagging in the back of his mind. Things were fine. It was just that his whole life felt temporary.
in proper robes."
“Who is she?” he croaked looking up at the aurors who were watching him with more impatience than pity.
"Hermione?" Ron called out.
“Wait, can you see them?”
“How is that unreasonable? When was the last time you looked in a mirror? You look like shit, Malfoy, even Mrs Weasley is concerned about you, and it’s not like she has much reason to care.”
“Fuck you, Potter,” Draco said.
He looked up and saw a third broomstick zooming towards them from the castle. A flood of relief washed over him. A few seconds later, Draco had joined them.
"Relax, Malfoy, the weather is shit. No one's out."
“It’s not too far from here," Malfoy said. "Just a normal flat.”
They all looked at him. Pansy was the only one who didn't seem surprised. She looked impatient instead.
“I mean, obviously it can’t be that hard if you’re able to do it. When have you
He took a deep breath and raised his wand.
“Malfoy.”
He grabbed his Firebolt and left.
still the Ministry, you know. Old money politics, very conservative, very set in its ways. I'm surprised you managed to stick around as long as you did."
“Since when did you start caring about that? If this is about “dragging your name out of the gutter”, then you’ve gone too far. You’re fucking mad, Malfoy.”
She frowned.
"Well what?" Malfoy prompted when Harry trailed off.
“Hi,” he said.
“I thought it wasn’t obvious? Wasn’t that why you were confused?”
“Yes. She was an experimental witch, like my mother. We have some of her other books back home, she had some very interesting theories. I didn’t know there were any books about her dementor-research.”
,” he said and from the tip of his wand sprang the silvery shape of stoat.
“New years! You were supposed to be there. I sent you letters. I contacted your mother over the floo, and she said you wouldn’t talk to me.”
She uncorked the vial, but didn’t bother to have Hermione drink the potion; she guided the liquid with her wand so it swirled like three blue snakes from the bottle and into Hermione’s mouth and nostrils. Hermione coughed and shuddered, Pomfrey put down the vial, her eyes never leaving Hermione. She raised her wand over Hermione’s face and moved the tip in tiny figure-eight movements, the murmured incantation too quiet for Harry to make out any words. He and Ron watched her anxiously and at first the spell had no visible effect, but then Hermione’s skin moved, rising here and there, like fingers poking from the underside of it, faster and faster, until it looked like it was boiling. Pearls of sweat broke out on her forehead and ran into her hair. It pooled in the creases by her eyes and around the burns, where it sizzled and frothed. Madam Pomfrey moved her wand faster, Hermione’s skin bubbled, more white froth appeared and Hermione whimpered and squirmed on the bed.
“For quidditch practice? Isn’t twice a week fine?”
Ginny and Pansy didn’t sit with them, but despite Draco’s claims of exhaustion, it wasn’t a particularly peaceful ride from Hogwarts to London. It was only in the evening, when the sky had darkened and they were nearing King’s Cross Station that quiet finally settled in their compartment. They had finished all their candy long ago and Harry sat slumped back in his seat next to Draco, full and happy, the gentle rocking motions of the train making him sleepy. Across from him, Hermione had pulled out a book and Ron was absentmindedly reading through the facts on the chocolate frog cards.
She scoffed and turned to him with a thoroughly unimpressed look on her face.
“What are you doing here?”
“Good. I don’t want anyone to think that they can take it easy with their classes just because they were able to attend school last year. Mr. Malfoy, I will see you tonight in detention so you can make up for some of the work you’ve missed.”
“What?” said Draco, disoriented.
himself.
“Good,” he said. “Let’s go.”
“Yeah, you’re probably right. It was a bad idea, forget about it.”
“Where the fuck is she?” called Ron.
"Shit," he muttered and hurried past Hermione up the stairs.
Draco stared back.
. That those names meant nothing to them, that the fact that Harry and Malfoy were in Gryffindor and Slytherin gave them no clue that it was very unlikely they had been friends. That they had no idea what Hogwarts was, what it
He waited until the lesson was almost over. His own potion was looking perfect, and more importantly, Potter looked like he was satisfied with his result as well. There was only about ten minutes left until they would be asked to turn their potions in and clean up when Draco left his station and sauntered over to the Gryffindor half of the classroom. He could pretend he was just on his way to get a glass vial for his potion, but it wasn’t really important. It wasn’t like he wanted to get away with it.
“I humbly apologized when I realized that I needed his help.”
“She didn’t sound like she was over it.”
“You know what I mean.”
“I’ll see you tomorrow, then,” she said.
“For a little while you did.”
“Because I knew you didn’t!”
“I was just longing to hear your sweet voice. I haven’t heard from you in nearly a week. How are you?”
”Yes, I uh...” he fumbled. “I wanted to say thank you. For earlier,” he managed with a half shrug.
He shrugged. He took a bite of his pie but didn’t taste it.
“I didn’t believe her, said you knew Malfoy was a bastard, but she’s right, isn’t she?”
“For the last time, Ron, no you can’t copy my essay!”
“You’re good with memory charms-“
“Of course,” he said and raised his wand.
“It’s not your fault,” she repeated softly, running her fingers through his hair. “It wasn’t your choice.”
“For the first time this year you were acting exactly like yourself,” he said. “Which was a good reminder of what you’re really like, because apparently I had forgotten.”
“I know, but it looks like it might rain soon. We could circle back over Hogsmeade and walk up to the castle that way? Maybe speed up a bit?”
Harry helped himself to a piece of toast.
He put the old wand away in a drawer and tried to forget it was there.
“Of course they have! We’ve been working with him and Pansy for months, we’ve talked to them, he was with us in the pit.“
He passed her the newspaper, ignoring the stares he knew he was getting from every Slytherin at the table.
"Yes?"
“Disarming her, that’ll stop them-“
“We’ll be fine,” said Malfoy with a shrug. “It doesn’t matter if we’re overheard. What we want to avoid is people from school finding out about this meeting, as that would be rather embarrassing for both of us, wouldn’t it? And in that respect this place is a much better option than The Three Broomsticks.”
He could feel Potter nodding.
"Yeah."
The boggart appeared to hesitate, to linger for a moment, before its shape collapsed and dissolved into something like smoke or thick mist. It retreated into the darkness of the wardrobe, and Potter slammed the door shut.
“But I already learned it. It was perfect yesterday, I’m fairly certain I’ll be able to do it again.”
“You know I’m not.”
Malfoy put down his cup and fished a stack of brightly coloured leaflets from behind the microwave, then handed them to Harry. Harry looked at the top one, then glanced back up at Malfoy, who was watching him intently with the same look in his eyes he had had when Harry had first entered the flat: like he was daring him to comment, like he wanted to hear him make fun of him.
“Why does that make a difference?”
“It’s just your hand,” said Potter.
He turned around, picked Harry's jacket off the coat rack and then stopped, just for a second, hand hovering before him.
He was lying on cold, damp stone and the back of his head hurt, but it was a red-hot, physical pain that felt almost comforting after the twisted, unnatural sensation of dementors groping through his memories.
“I… don’t think so?” said Draco, feeling just as bewildered as she sounded. “I would expect Lovegood to listen to Weasley, but…”
“I thought we might talk about it.”
like a joke.
It took a second before his eyes settled on Draco, and when they did, they widened in surprise.
“I know.”
would have noticed it if they could-“
She pulled open the bag she had slung over her shoulder and handed out gloves for flying to Neville, Luna and Hermione. She and Ron were already wearing theirs and Harry had brought his own as well. Ron looked around.
Someone, possibly one of the many aurors now on the rotating schedule of guard duty at Azkaban, had smuggled a camera into the tower. It was amateurish photography, but it wasn’t like the motives needed much framing to convey the horrors of the prison. Draco couldn’t stomach looking at more than a few of them before he had to put the paper down. He wished he had done it sooner. He had seen it all before, he didn’t need to be reminded. He didn’t think he had needed to read that caption either:
“Good luck,” he said.
“Don’t be a prick, Malfoy,” said Daphne. “Pansy claims she doesn’t know anything, so I hope you can explain to us what just happened.”
“Keeping my head down doesn’t mean I plan to disappear,” he said.
Draco looks at him with an expression Harry can’t read.
Draco said goodbye to Potter outside the pub, and started on his walk home. It was freezing. At some point he had convinced himself that this meeting would be a good idea. That he would feel better after this. It had made such a nice, compelling narrative: facing Potter, thanking him, apologizing, doing the right thing, and then he would be able to move on, feeling lighter and freer.
"You seemed busy," Harry said, nodding back towards the pub.
“You think? I don’t know if you noticed, but the Dark Lord generally wasn’t very forgiving. I didn’t particularly enjoy having him in my house.”
“Really?”
“Yeah, in that case I’d prefer not sleeping too.”
But a day passes and then another, and Draco doesn’t come storming back down the stairs to demand a nicer living space or complain about the lack of luxury. They hardly see him at all. He stays in his attic room almost all the time. Harry isn’t planning on talking to him, he hardly looks at him either, though he feels Draco's eyes on him like a cold prickling every time they happen to be in the same room.
“Would’ve been a bit hard to explain why you’re coming to stay with us in August if we hadn’t,” said Ron.
"Sorry," he said.
Draco looked back at Weasley, who was pouring himself a glass of orange juice. Pansy was watching him like the act was deeply upsetting to her.
“Sounds like you have a lot of people who don’t like you working in the Ministry.”
“No,” he said, trying to loosen the string around the bird’s foot with only one hand.
"Thanks," she said, vanishing back inside.
“I know.”
Draco could, all too easily. He had wanted to be important.
"We're leaving!" Draco insisted.
“She was torturing first years!”
Harry almost laughed.
“I saw someone,” he said.
“You know how they feel about me,” he said.
“No.”
Draco frowns. He picks up Harry’s hand. He looks repulsed. He swallows hard and Harry doesn’t really feel anything, he’s not even angry.
Draco pulls away from the door. He doesn’t need to hear any more.
“I know.”
“Fine,” said Granger. “I’ll meet you down there.”
They all stopped. Malfoy raised an eyebrow.
He didn’t want to think about that night. They were all giving him strange looks now and he could feel himself getting angry even though he really shouldn’t.
“I’m not joking.”
“Didn’t you hear me?” said Draco, a strain in his voice. “I don’t want to talk, Potter.”
Two weeks passed like that and he started seeing his own frustration mirrored on the faces of the others. There was very little progress on any fronts.
He cut himself off. He wanted to kick something.
hadn’t. He hadn’t had a single lesson of dark arts. He wouldn’t know it.
"Really?"
Harry made his way to the secret room that evening, following the route that Ginny had said would be the least used at the time. Ron had been poking fun at him all day and Harry had pretended to be bothered, but really he was quite happy about it. It meant that Ron at least wasn't too angry about the whole idea of involving the Slytherins, the way Harry was pretty sure Hermione still was. Besides, Malfoy had been perfectly all right the last couple of times they had talked.
“Nothing,” he said.
It was easier to say in the dark. Easier when he couldn’t see Potter’s face.
Though his days had been centred around preparing for going to Azkaban, he had not recently been paying a lot of attention to his memories of the prison itself. He had been preoccupied with the planning, with learning the patronus, so the painful parts, the ones that terrified him so much it seemed ridiculous that he was even attempting this, they had taken second place in his thoughts. Though this had made the impossibility of their mission seem lesser, it had also made it less urgent to him.
“Had a nice flight, Potter? It’s past curfew, you know,” he drawled.
Ron shrugged.
. He turned the page and began reading.
That spin on the story had definitely been the worst part of it. And Harry hated that it didn't come easier to feel sorry for her, he knew first-hand how awful it was to have everyone believe things about you that weren't true, but he was still… maybe he was still a bit angry with her. Not because she had found someone else - Harry wasn't in love with her anymore and he knew it had to happen eventually -  but because he’d had to find out about it through Witch Weekly just like the rest of the Wizarding World. He’d been completely unprepared when the first reporters came for him. Of course, she’d written him immediately after it came out, and it wasn't like she’d intended for everyone to know yet but… It wasn't like he had any right to be angry. He was just being petty about it.
“What?” he finally manages, and Malfoy’s eyes narrow.
“I don’t know what you want me to say,” he said finally.
"Well, you didn't ask," said Malfoy primly, and it was kind of dim in the pub, but Harry thought he could see a pink blush creeping up his neck.
Malfoy sighed.
of all people-
Harry grimaced.
“You ought to, you’re like a mascot to them – the heir of…”
The question was blurted out. It took a second’s hesitation for Draco to take it in.
Malfoy pushed the window open and fished a crumpled cigarette packet out of his pocket. He put a cigarette between his lips and then, to Harry's surprise, pulled out a lighter. He cupped his free hand around the flame and inhaled deeply. On the exhale he twisted his body halfway out the window, though most of the smoke drifted into the room anyway. He put the lighter down, and Harry followed it with his eyes. It was made of blue plastic. It was the second time within 10 minutes that Harry had seen Malfoy use muggle technology for things any wizard would do by magic. And both times had been casual, not like he was doing it because Harry was there, to prove a point or something, but without thinking about it, like it was a habit. And well, maybe if it had been some other wizard, Harry wouldn't have found it odd. Maybe if it had been someone muggleborn or someone like him who had lived in the muggle world for a long time, who had had reason to develop habits like that. But this was
“They will if this is going to be a thing.”
But really it would be easier to tell her than any of the others. He kind of wanted to. Just to sort himself out a bit.
He wasn't sure if he wanted to. The conversation certainly wasn't very stimulating, he wasn't sure what he was even supposed to do if Potter got sick, and if he was being perfectly honest, it was getting fairly awkward, even if Potter was too drunk to notice.
”Yeah,” he said hoarsely.
The voice is so quiet Draco almost thinks he might have imagined it, but when he glances back Potter’s eyes are fixed on him again.
Draco winced. He remembered those coins from back when he and Pansy had been in Umbridge’s Inquisitorial Squad.
Potter blinked and looked away.
“What’s going on with you and Malfoy?” she asked.
They carried their broomsticks with them to the platform at the top of the stairs, then left them leaning against the railing there where Granger cast securing charms and disillusionment on them. Ginny crouched down in front of the door and pulled off her gloves. The tools she took from her pocket looked almost muggle in their primitiveness, but it took her less than a minute of working the oddly shaped metal blades into the keyhole before the door swung open. Longbottom pulled open the bag he had slung over his shoulder and handed the invisibility cloak to Harry. He pulled it on and disappeared.
"When did I threaten you?"
"Emma, stop it," she hissed. "Stop it, there are muggles here."
“Oh, right. I wasn’t planning on going, actually.”
“Good. Pretty good.”
“Why are you telling him that?” snapped Draco. “How long do you think he’ll remember it? It’ll be gone an hour after we’re out of here. He’s dead – look at him, he’s fucking dead! We came all the way in here to talk to a corpse, and as soon as we walk back out all that shit you’re telling him will just seep away. He doesn’t even know who you are!”
Potter made an unintelligible noise.
“I’m exhausted,” she sighed.
“Of course you have.”
He tried to get to his feet and immediately, Harry was there, dragging him upright.
had provoked Potter’s reaction, he had
Draco wasn’t sure there was anything in his head at all.
“I wouldn’t know how to block it, though.”
The last part came out too loud, too shrill. The flat was suddenly very quiet around him. There was pointed silence on Pansy's end of the phone. He took a deep breath.
Then he caught sight of Pansy pushing her way towards him. He straightened up and waved to her, trying to look composed, like he hadn’t almost bolted at the sound of her voice. If she had noticed his flinch, she didn’t show it. She was grinning at him.
“Go talk to him tomorrow. You’ll get it sorted out.”
“Why did you come back to Hogwarts?” he asked
He handed her the cup. He had just been moving something about on the counter, the cup just happened to be in his left hand. He wasn't really paying attention. Her fingers closed around it and he let go, and then she wasn't holding it, it slipped from his grip and hers and the whole thing dropped, lid coming off, coffee spilling everywhere.
Harry watches helplessly as Snape heals him. He waits in the bathroom while Draco is taken to the hospital wing. The water slowly soaks through his shoes.
He shrugged.
. It never occurred to him that Malfoy might.
“I did,” he said. “Turns out the potion works really well for me, knocks me out completely for 8 hours and leaves me well-rested the next morning. It just has the unfortunate side effect of giving me very vivid dreams.”
“We could just sleep on the floor…” said Ron.
Harry looked back up the empty path towards the gates.
Malfoy picked up the bottle and handed it to him.
She stared at him.
Blaise threw up his hands.
“No sign of him yet.”
“I mean, I’ve always had help,” Harry continued. “Ron and Hermione, Dumbledore’s Army, the Order – and we’ve been lucky. You said it yourself, I almost got myself killed all those times, and I might just as well have died, it wasn’t because I’m some great wizard that I didn’t, it was just…”
"We would have been back in in a minute," Malfoy said.
“Yes, the Gryffindors seemed really keen on that.”
Draco jerked away from him.
“What about it?”
"Well, then," he said.
"I'm fine."
Draco cast a shield charm faster than Harry could react. The moment the auror was distracted, Ron turned and sprinted towards his sister, who was backed up against a cell, throwing shield spells with frantic speed. The auror heard him and spun around, aiming her wand at his feet. Draco slashed his wand downwards in a wordless curse at the same time Neville cried:
“I don’t give a fuck, Potter,” Malfoy mutters.
“How did it go?”
“Of course not-“
Draco didn’t take long to gather himself before he got out of bed. The others were probably still awake and would hear him leave, but that didn’t matter. He had asked them to leave him alone, so they would. Besides, in the wake of his nightmare, in comparison to Azkaban, everything to do with Slytherin and his reputation seemed utterly insignificant. He got dressed and left the dormitory as quietly as he could. He walked down the dark staircase and through the dim common room. There were movements in the shadows, and a house elf who hadn’t noticed him and remained absorbed in his work of polishing the dark wood of a coffee table. Draco strode past and out into the corridor.
"What about you, then?" Harry asked stiffly. "What have you been doing?"
“They’re shields, that’s all they do.”
“I thought you weren’t into handholding with other blokes.”
The Parkinsons were too far away to be able to hear them, but Mrs Parkinson waved when she noticed he was looking. He smiled and waved back but then quickly turned towards Pansy again.
“About you and Malfoy.”
“I think Potter still sort of believes that it was all because of the Death Eaters, so I tried to explain why it’s not. How it’s an entire system, not a single incident, not just one evil person. How all the old families have been running the country for centuries and how they’ll probably continue to do that for the coming centuries too. And how we’re playing some sort of political game in Slytherin, and if I ever have kids they’ll be playing that game too, befriending the Zabinis or the Greengrasses, or whoever is the most important pureblood family at that time.”
Harry frowned. Right. He had forgotten about that. He hadn't been to their place in a while.
Ron pushed his chair back, almost knocking over his plate.
“What, and that doesn’t apply to you?”
hadn’t heard from you, I actually went St. Mungo’s to see if you were being treated for dementor-exposure or something and–“
“Do you want me to wait for you, Draco?” asked Pansy.
The owl stuck out her leg.
Harry ends up on a couch flanked by Ron and Hermione as the Minister reads Dumbledore’s will to them. It’s a solemn moment, a harsh reminder of their loss, and Harry wishes he wasn’t so angry. Despite the Minister being one of the last people Harry wanted to see that day, he does feel a spark of hope when he finds out why he is there – he thinks for a moment that Dumbledore’s will might hold some answers, maybe a clue about where they should start. And of course, it doesn’t. It’s just another nonsensical riddle from the old headmaster, this time passed to them from beyond the grave.
“And you destroyed it?”
Draco swallowed hard.
“The aurors have to get in and out of here on a regular basis, I don’t think it’s closed with fucking blood magic-“
“Because I won’t be going to Azkaban with you. I’ve thought about it, and I’ll help you all I can with this part, planning and research and everything. I have an internship at the Prophet, so I can probably get into their archives, that might be useful. But I won’t be of any help in a battle situation, and honestly, I don’t want to risk my life for this.”
He looked miserable. Draco was almost too tired to be nervous, but he did feel the knot of apprehension in his stomach. They hadn’t talked since their fight.
“Hello,” she said as if they might have been expecting her.
"Might still be a while."
“Thanks,” she said.
“What did McGonagall want?” asked Hermione when he joined her and Ron.
Draco shrugged.
“Alright?”
“I get it, but it’s fine. Don’t worry. We talked about everything over the summer, right? I have to get down to practice now, but I’ll see you later.”
Malfoy, who was halfway to the door, turned and looked back at him with an eyebrow raised in a question, half smiling. And it hit him again, hard this time, how much he actually liked him. How much he cared about him. How nice he looked, too. Harry had always thought that Malfoy looked exactly like Lucius, but now he thought the similarity was more in his mannerisms than his actual appearance. Without the haughty arrogance that both father and son had projected, they really weren’t that much alike. He couldn’t quite recall what Malfoy’s mother looked like, but he thought it was possible that apart from the sleek, white blonde of his hair, he was actually taking after her. But he had never seen her smile like that either.
“Probably.”
“We could just blow it all up, I suppose. As Weasley suggested.”
"Really?" she said, a bit too excited. And okay, he didn't leave the house that often, but it still stung.
