Harry is reading on the couch in the living room of Number 12 Grimmauld Place, when suddenly a head appears in his fireplace.
He takes a few steps onto the roof before glimpsing another figure standing by the railing. The figure turns around and despite the dim light, Harry can see that it’s Malfoy. The wind is whipping his blond hair around his face, and he’s wearing the same black shirt he was wearing at the pub that first night, but his sleeves are rolled up to his elbows and he looks significantly more relaxed than Harry’s ever seen him.
Harry scrubs his eyes with the palms of his hands. “I don’t understand, though. I was fine this morning but then I got home and just felt like everything I did was wrong. And I keep thinking about the war--” he stops.
Five minutes later the music is once again blasting on full volume, but this time it’s the Backstreet Boys. Hermione knows every single word to ‘All I Have to Give’, and when the song finishes everyone gives her a round of applause.
“Thanks. See you,” calls Harry as he steps into the fireplace. The flames whoosh around him and Malfoy’s gorgeous, disaster of a flat disappears from view.
“You don’t want me to follow my dreams, Ron?” she says. “Even you have to admit you can’t compete with his eyebrows.”
“Oh, god,” Malfoy groans, as if he’s just now seeing his flat through a stranger’s eyes. “It’s horrible. Let’s leave immediately, I can obliviate you and we can forget that you’ve seen I live in a pigsty.”
“You’re so dramatic.” Malfoy rolls his eyes. “Also, I don’t think you understand. I really haven’t cleaned it in a while.”
“Sorry,” Harry shrugs. “Look, you do enough around here. You can finish up when I leave and go to Molly and Arthur’s, okay?” Kreacher shoots him a foul look and disappears with a crack. Sighing, Harry finishes making his bed and checks the time. Nearly 5:15. Satisfied that he won’t be the first person there, Harry apparates to the Burrow.
“Come on.” Harry nudges him. “What else are you gonna be doing? It’ll be fun. You can read me some poems.” He gestures to the book he’s clutching.
“Nah. He’s not thrilled about it, obviously, but I think his pride is more wounded than anything. I don’t think he’s ever been dumped before,” Malfoy muses.
Luna scoots closer to Harry and wraps her arms around him, leaning her head on his shoulder. “There’s no proper way to grieve. Just because you didn’t cry doesn’t mean you’re broken. And you’re allowed to take as much time as you need to process.”
“Taking a nap, Potter?” Malfoy’s sharp voice snaps him out of his rumination. Harry opens his eyes to find him leaning against the bar, holding a now empty glass and looking extremely impatient.
“I just…” he shakes his head. “It’s not that bad.” Malfoy fixes him with an incredulous look. “Okay, it’s pretty bad,” Harry says, amending his previous statement. “I’d pegged you for a neat freak, though. Especially considering how you dress and all that.”
It’s easier talking about these things with Luna for some reason. “It does help,” he admits, a welcome change from his usual tendency to bottle up all his feelings. “I ran into Malfoy this morning, he said he was going to therapy. And that I should try it. He was being sarcastic of course, but it’s not a half-bad idea.”
He desperately scrapes his brain for something to break the awkward silence. “Congrats on finishing your NEWTS, you both.”
“Why’d you host a big party then?” Malfoy asks, tapping ash off the end of a cigarette. He’s wearing his many rings again, and they glitter in the moonlight.
He spends a bit of time after she leaves puttering around his flat and cleaning the kitchen, not that there’s much to clean. His apartment is still extremely bare, but Harry’s excited to begin filling his shelves with the books he’d bought earlier. He decides to start one of them,
“Drive a little slower, would you?” Malfoy yells. “I’d like to live for more than twenty years, thank you very much.” The traffic signal in front of them turns red and Harry screeches to a halt.
“I’d hardly call myself a stranger, Potter.” Malfoy levels his grey eyes at Harry. From somewhere behind them sounds the clink of several drinks being placed on the counter. Before the bartender can leave, Malfoy tears his piercing gaze away from Harry and stops her. “And two shots of firewhiskey. Please.”
“Fascinating as this conversation is,” Pansy interrupts, “I think the march is starting. Oi, Draco!” He looks up. “Time to go!” They all climb to their feet, sweating already in the summer heat, and join the crowd of people heading towards Piccadilly.
Harry considers this. “But if Divination is the magical equivalent of say, tarot card reading, does that mean it holds more credibility? Because in the magical world it seems to be treated pretty much the same.”
Hermione sets down her glass and pats the sofa next to her. “I think that’s a good idea, Harry. Being in that big house by yourself can’t be good for your mental health. Where are you gonna go?”
While he’s waiting for the shower, Harry opens a bottle of red wine. He’s sitting at the kitchen table, sipping his glass and staring off into space, when Malfoy finally emerges. Harry fails to suppress a snort at the sight of him wearing his old clothes. It’s not that they fit poorly, though Malfoy does have a couple inches on him, but Harry’s never seen him wearing something so casual before.
“Invited, am I? Have I been forgiven that easily for making fun of your outfits? You’re not wearing shoes either,” he points out.
ty for reading & pls excuse my copious comma usage! also i'd like to say fuck jk rowling and her transphobic ass, what a time to be publishing this fic.
Dean nods and turns to Harry, who’s been happily observing the conversation. “When are Ron and Hermione getting here?”
Harry grins, delighted. “So that means I win,” he says. “Unless you want to finish and tell me that everyone wished I was dead, or something like that.”
She fixes Harry with a piercing gaze, then sighs good-naturedly, all the tension going out of her body. “Oh, never mind that! We have lots of stories to tell you. Maybe not while Molly and Arthur are in the room though.”
now that he’s got this idea in his head he can’t get rid of it. He idly wonders what Malfoy’s up to, and then realizes -- he could just ask Malfoy.
Harry shakes his head. “You can, I don’t feel like it. I’ll see all these people tomorrow at the weekly Weasley dinner anyway.”
“Of course.” Harry retrieves a pint of ice cream from the freezer and two spoons and they spend the rest of the night talking about Blaise and then Luna and then nothing in particular.
She shoots them a mischievous smile as she skips away to help George with the plates. “Are you three helping with dinner or not?”
They step outside and Harry watches Malfoy as he lights the joint, lips around the filter, brow furrowed as he flicks the lighter. After taking a hit he passes it to Harry, who inhales and immediately starts coughing.
Nodding, he takes a gulp of water, realizing just how dehydrated he is. “I can’t either. It’s horrible.”
Harry heads into the kitchen, deciding to make more coffee while he brainstorms other things he could do, but
After a cold shower, Harry still feels bored. He wants to do something, go somewhere that’s not part of his usual routine. He has all this pent up energy that needs to go somewhere, and Arthur still has his motorcycle so a drive is out of the question, not that Harry knows how to ride a motorcycle anyway. Casting around for something to do, he’s suddenly struck with the urge to play Quidditch. Now that Ginny’s playing for the Harpies, Harry’s been thinking about Quidditch more than he used to, and anyway he misses his old hobbies from Hogwarts, when he would do things just for the fun of it. Harry has no idea what he enjoys anymore, and thinks Quidditch might be a good place to start. Problem is, there’s no one around for a quick game. Ron, Hermione, and Ginny are all at their respective jobs, and Harry doesn’t think either Luna or Neville will be up for it. He supposes he could give Seamus and Dean a call, but doesn’t feel like they’re the ideal Quidditch companions. And they’re not all that close.
He looks so uncomfortable admitting this that Harry bursts out laughing. A smile curves Malfoy’s lips at this response.
Swept up in the throng, Harry ends up falling behind the rest of his friends and walking next to Malfoy.
“Dear Merlin.” Harry sinks onto the sofa, not quite prepared to deal with this. “Okay, walk me through this. Why?”
Dean snaps his fingers in support. “Fucked how the wizarding community thinks we’re past all of the homophobia and biphobia but we’re really just as bad as the Muggles,” he says. “Honestly, the Muggles are probably making more progress with LGBT rights than we are.”
It’s a Thursday morning. Harry wakes at dawn, sleep disturbed by nightmares per usual. After tossing and turning for a while, unable to fall back asleep, he rises from his bed and putters around the kitchen, making coffee and deciding to take it up to the roof to watch the sunrise. It’s a beautiful morning, the day warming quickly as the sun peeks above the horizon and spreads brilliant yellows and oranges across the cloudless sky. He sips his coffee, ignoring the fact that it’s too hot as it scalds his throat on the way down, and then stomps back down to his flat and circles the main room no less than three times before deciding to go for a run to rid himself of his restless energy.
“I know,” Malfoy says, sounding immensely pleased. “Nothing rhymes with Draco either. Now you can’t write a nasty poem about me.”
Harry looks down, noticing the deep purple mark by his elbow that still hasn’t faded from the first time he crashed his motorcycle. “Had a bit of an accident,” he says vaguely. “Hey, what are you up to this afternoon?”
by Kurt Vonnegut. Muggle books have always been his comfort, and he’s glad there’s a bookshop around the corner stocked with classics. He curls up in bed and reads about fifty pages before his vision begins to go blurry and he falls asleep.
As it nears seven o’clock, Harry is beginning to curse himself for not having a hard out. His stomach is growling, and at this point it’s just Blaise, Ginny, and Pansy having a loud conversation as he listens. Malfoy adds a sarcastic comment every now and again, but for the most part seems off in his own little world. Harry was hoping that he and Ginny would have some time alone to actually catch up, but it doesn’t seem likely.
“Oh, yes,” replies Malfoy. “Only, I don’t want to go get it right now. You’ll have to live without it.”
Adam nods. “Hope to see you around, Harry with the cool scar,” he says, pulling him in for one last kiss before releasing him. Blushing, Harry looks around for his friends. He catches a glimpse of Ron and Hermione at the bar, and manages to make his way over.
hello! as always, thank you for reading <3 i feel like i did not do this chapter justice but i was tired of writing it so i hope it is satisfying. i also think i really went off with the commas i just do not know how to use them properly...u know what? it happens
Before he leaves the flat, Harry owls Ginny back, knowing she’ll be pleased that it was her suggestion that worked out in the end.
Secondly, Pride has become increasingly capitalist, where we cheer for huge corporations that don’t give a shit about our rights. Why do you need that rainbow pin to show that you’re queer? You don’t. And to make matters worse, the rainbow flag was created by Gilbert Baker, who was in the U.S. Army.” Malfoy angrily gestures around him. “Pride isn’t a fucking party. We’re still fighting for the right to
Harry shrugs. “Yeah. It’s okay. On the scale of shitty things we’ve done to each other, that’s like the least of it.”
Malfoy stands up, interrupting Harry’s thoughts, and mounts his broom once more. Harry follows him and they fly leisurely around the park for a while longer, taking it easy and enjoying the summer day, until Harry’s stomach begins to grumble and he forces Malfoy to stop.
“Shut up,” he says around a huge mouthful. Malfoy looks pained as Harry talks with his mouth full, and he can tell it takes him an enormous amount of effort not to comment on it. Harry tries to suppress a grin. “Are we almost there? I’m tired.”
“Great!” he enthuses. “Really, I’m sure you’re making it out to be much worse than it is. You, messy? I doubt it.”
“Harry?” Luna’s soft voice calls from outside. Sighing in relief, he slowly makes his way across the flat and opens the door. “I’ve brought curry,” she says, holding up a plastic bag. As the smell of Indian food wafts through the hallway, Harry is eternally grateful that he has such amazing people in his life.
“He jokes now,” quips Harry. “For your information, I’ve always loved to read. Not Hermione-level dedication or anything, but I wasn’t allowed to do much else when I was at my aunt and uncle’s and I kind of fell back into it this year.”
“No! I didn’t even mean to set it free, and then my aunt and uncle locked me in the cupboard for the rest of the summer. My God,” Harry remarks. “When I put it that way my life was pretty shit, huh.”
He can see Malfoy trying not to smile, but it doesn’t work and the sides of his mouth curve upward against his will. “You’re a horror, Potter,” he says, sounding a bit fond. “Do you want to hear more poetry?”
“Good grief, Potter!” cries Malfoy as he merges sharply into the left lane, rudely cutting off the car behind him and receiving a nasty honk.
Climbing to his feet, Arthur casts a quick cleaning charm and the grease disappears from his hands and face. He puts a gentle hand on Harry’s shoulder. “I insist, my boy. It’s rightly yours. Thank you for letting me play around with it.”
“Ooh, yes,” agrees Luna. She helps him clear away the remnants of their meal and turns on Notting Hill, which neither of them have seen yet. “Julia Roberts is soo dreamy,” she comments as the opening credits play, tugging a blanket up to her chest.
Ginny wrinkles her nose, thinking about this for a few minutes. Harry lets her contemplate in silence and stares into space, mind full of thoughts. “Okay, actually, I changed my mind,” she says. “I do want to be in a monogamous relationship, just not with him.”
He knows he’s being ridiculous. Ginny’s one of his best friends and they spend loads of time together, plus she makes it very clear when she dislikes someone. They tell each other literally everything. He shakes his head, heading into the bathroom to take a cold shower. Maybe he shouldn’t smoke with Malfoy anymore.
“I’ll be right back,” she says, leaving them to decide on their orders. Harry stares at his menu for a few seconds before realizing that all the words are swimming around the page and he can’t read anything.
He sends it off with his owl, Esmerelda. She’s a gorgeous, if not a bit temperamental barn owl that he’d received earlier that year from Andromeda Tonks and he’d felt like he couldn’t refuse her generous gift. Esmerelda hoots once before flying out of the window to deliver his letter. While he waits for a reply, Harry makes his bed, starts a load of laundry, and sweeps his entire flat. It’s habit really; Harry finds he’s incapable of doing anything unless his space is organized. When he doesn’t know what to do he just...cleans. What else is there to do?
“What?” Harry innocently calls back. He’s feeling a bit unhinged, like something inside of him has come undone and the speed of the bike and the wind is working it looser and looser by the minute. He’d do anything right now, no matter how stupid and reckless; Malfoy’s arms wrapped around his chest are the only things keeping him grounded and steady.
“He’s really changed,” agrees Luna. “He apologized to me for what happened at the Manor during the war. It was very kind of him.”
“I don’t care,” says Harry. “And can we stop at a sandwich shop on the way? Seriously, I’m so hungry that I feel like I might pass out.”
“Join us, Harry!” Luna calls over the music, taking his hands in hers. Of course Harry has no choice but to dance with them. He knows all the lyrics to ‘Dancing Queen’, as it should be. Seamus and Dean crowd into the kitchen after him and all five of them jump up and down, screaming the words to one of their favorite songs. It’s exhilarating and Harry can’t stop smiling as he moves his body to the music, simultaneously afraid that the neighbors will call in a noise complaint and not caring less about what they think. Nothing could be more beautiful in this moment: it’s a perfect day and the sun is shining, the windows are open and a summer breeze is wafting through the apartment, and he’s so lucky to be part of a community full of so much love and resilience.
“What’s this about McGonagall?” Ron comes up behind them and interrupts the conversation, slinging one arm around Harry and the other around Hermione.
Harry laughs. “Okay, Ron is actually not that judgmental and you know it. But sure, wanna come to mine?”
Blinking, Harry takes a second to respond. “You really just come out and say it, huh?” he says, though he suspects he shouldn’t be one to talk. “Er, I dunno. I didn’t feel like going back to school after everything that happened.”
hello thank u for reading! i wrote this fic mainly so i would start writing again -- and hey, it worked! i had a lot of fun with this, it's rather silly and really i just wrote whatever i felt like writing (and it shows) but regardless i hope you enjoyed. if u feel so inclined u can find me on tumblr @ gnseyiii :-)
“Yeah. I guess. After fighting a war, chasing so-called bad guys didn’t seem that appealing all of a sudden.” Harry tears his eyes away from Malfoy’s to stare at the concrete below him, feeling more sober than he’d like for this conversation. He traces a shape in the dust with his finger, remembering his decision not to return to Hogwarts. Ron and Hermione had been so excited to rebuild their lives, start careers that weren’t dedicated to chasing Voldemort for a change, but Harry never shared their enthusiasm. On the last day they could sign up for their NEWTS, he had gone to McGonagall and withdrawn his application. A screaming match with Ron and Hermione had ensued, but they’d understood Harry’s decision with relatively little explaining. Their world had just shattered – it wasn’t going to be that easy to pick up the pieces.
“You did save my life too,” Malfoy replies softly. “Don’t think I’ve forgotten -- the last time we flew together was when you saved me from the Room of Requirement. That’s why I was a bit surprised that you asked me, of all people, to play Quidditch today.”
“I mean. Yes. I just wanted you to tell me if I was being stupid and talk me out of it,” she replies. “But you haven’t done that, so.”
Harry grins. “You’re in for a treat. You have to watch the television series when you’re finished, it’s incredible.”
Taking a drag, Harry hands it back to Malfoy. “To answer your question,” he says, “My friends thought it would be a good idea. I didn’t realize how many people they were inviting until they all showed up.” He makes a face.
Malfoy plops down beside him, sighing. “Fuck. You’ll never be able to look at me the same, Potter. Just when I thought I managed to convince you that I was the superior one.”
“Er, does Luna feel the same way?” Harry asks tentatively. “Like, does she know this is something you’re thinking about?”
Malfoy frowns, mouth moving as he counts the syllables in the last line of his haiku. “Okay, fine. What about ‘We are extremely high’?”
“Er, likewise,” he responds. “I’ve heard a lot about you from Ginny, it’s good to finally, um, meet. Malfoy, Parkinson.” Harry nods at Blaise’s companions, who remain seated. Pansy wears a pleasant expression on her face and is sipping delicately on a glass of rose.
Hearing her name from across the kitchen, Ginny hollers, “WHAT WAS THAT?” She hands George a serving spoon before making her way to the trio. “You talking about me?”
. I don’t think this quote fully resonated with me back then, or it did, but it was like this unattainable goal at the time.”
“On the contrary. It’s a relief that you’re not obsessed with me anymore.” This time Malfoy’s words have a bit of bite to them, but before Harry can retaliate, Ginny and Blaise reappear. Ginny passes him a pint and then slides into the booth next to him.
Heading into the kitchen, Harry opens the cupboard where he knows Ginny keeps her hangover potion. He unscrews the cap and braces himself for the horrible feeling it brings, but after swallowing a disgusting mouthful he feels much better. His stomach growls loudly, and Harry decides to cook some breakfast. Thankfully Ginny keeps her fridge well stocked, so after putting on the kettle for tea, Harry whips up some scrambled eggs and a potato hash, which he knows Ron will be thrilled about after the hash browns were missing last night. Shortly, Ginny joins him in the kitchen in search of the hangover potion. He passes it to her wordlessly and spoons some breakfast onto a plate. They sit at her round table and silently eat their food. Gradually the others begin to get up and join them for breakfast, first Hermione and then Luna.
“Potter,” Malfoy snaps. Harry’s attention comes back to the present moment and he takes a few deep breaths to calm himself, reaching for his bottle of water. Once he feels more steady, he meets Malfoy’s eyes. “It’s fine,” Malfoy says flatly. “I’ve forgiven you for everything a long time ago.”
“Been thinking about getting some tattoos, what do you think?” asks Malfoy idly, examining himself in the mirror.
“I hope you’re insinuating that I’m wealthy and beautiful,” sniffs Malfoy, “and not the other thing.”
Harry rolls his eyes and heads into the kitchen to put on the kettle. When he emerges, Ginny is laying upside-down on the sofa with her legs in the air and hair brushing the carpet.
Harry blows on the chili before taking a bite. “Delicious as always,” he declares with his mouth full. “Doesn’t need a thing.”
“He’s friends with Blaise. I’ve been seeing a lot of him lately,” replies Harry, fishing out a pretzel chunk from the ice cream in the container.
‘Dancing Queen’ ends and ‘SOS’ immediately starts playing, and of course the dancing has to continue. Harry sings until his voice grows hoarse and he’s out of breath, when Dean lowers the music and they take the party to the living room. The living room is decked out with rainbow flags and two protest signs lean against the wall in the corner, which Harry is glad to see. He sinks onto the couch between Ginny and Seamus and starts on his second drink. Ginny’s brought a pitcher of margaritas, and they spend the early afternoon day-drinking and enjoying each other’s company, listening to old music and making stupid jokes.
And that is how Harry ends up riding his motorcycle across London with Malfoy clinging on tightly behind him as they zoom through yellow lights and turn sharp corners that give Harry such an adrenaline rush he thinks he might pass out.
To his great surprise, Malfoy is still reading in the same chair as before. His brow is furrowed and he’s chewing on his lip as he concentrates, but looks up when he sees Harry and his great stack of books.
“Potter, what a surprise,” he replies, setting down the book he’d been reading. “Didn’t expect to see you this morning.”
Harry lets out a bitter chuckle. “Yeah, right. Did I mention that time I accidentally released a snake from the zoo?”
Arthur pats him on the back. “Not at all, dear boy. Will you be able to get it home alright?” he asks anxiously.
Ron shrugs. “I thought it was pretty chill. Loads of people showed up, I’d forgotten about most of them to be honest. Talked with Luna some, we definitely have to invite her over sometime. But everyone else ‘Mione and I have seen recently cause of our NEWTS.”
Harry laughs. “Paper’s easier to carry than literal gold coins,” he points out. “But I agree. Seamus and Dean were talking earlier about how Pride has been turned into a carnival rather than the political march it used to be.”
No matter how much Harry wants to argue that Malfoy started the argument in the first place, he does have a fair point. It has only been a month, sure, but Ginny and Blaise seem to be together for the foreseeable future. And it’s not like being friendly will cost Harry anything. “I suppose,” he admits. “Now, are you going to help me carry these drinks back to the table or what?”
Laughing, Ginny agrees. “Yes, please. Oh hey, I hear you’re moving! Finally! You have to let me help you find a place.”
“Not funny!” he protests, only half-joking. “That was a very traumatizing experience for me in third year, thank you very much.”
They squish together on the sofa to watch the movie but end up talking over it half the time. He doesn’t quite know how the conversation turns from Notting Hill to his party from last night, but around a mouthful of Chubby Hubby, she says, “I noticed Malfoy was at your party yesterday.”
Harry protests. “Wait, wait, I can’t make one up off of the top of my head. Do you have a pen?” Malfoy stares at him. “A quill?”
“Oh, good,” he responds. “I’ll just tell Blaise to firecall you with all his complaints then, shall I?”
“Stop overthinking, we’re fine, we barely even dated and anyway we were so young, it’s literally never come up once, you know I love you but not in that way.”
Harry wakes surprisingly clear-headed for the first time in a while. He’s excited to explore his new neighborhood, and sure he’s spent lots of time in this area with Ron and Hermione, but walking down the streets will be different now that he lives here.
Ron nods, satisfied by this answer, and returns to his milkshake. The other table finishes their meal before Harry’s table does, and after they’ve paid the bill, Ginny, Dean, Seamus, Pansy, and Astoria all squeeze into their booth despite the fact that there is no room for them. Ron squishes Harry against Malfoy, who’s pinned to the corner of the bench.
He enters the room to find her lying sprawled out on the floor, looking more distressed than he’s seen her in a while.
“You’d think the Wizarding World would be advanced enough to have a more just economic system, but I guess not. And what about the AIDS epidemic?” asks Harry, feeling it’s necessary to bring up. “14 million people have died so far, and Reagan didn’t even
Ron nods. “Right, well, we’re off then. Cheers, Harry.” They exchange hugs and Harry is left to the silence of his new flat. It’s not quite the same as Grimmauld Place’s dusty atmosphere, and he doesn’t have to deal with the burden of an enormous empty house anymore, but the loneliness is still there. Now it’s accompanied with a new feeling of guilt for not being a better friend. He really shouldn’t have ditched everyone, especially after they put so much work into welcoming him into his new home. His friends were only trying to help – if he hadn’t wanted a party, he probably should have told them. Harry is struck with the overwhelming urge to firecall Ginny and ask her if she hates him. He can imagine how the conversation would go:
One mid-afternoon in early June he forces himself out of bed, walks down the long dark staircase of Grimmauld Place, through the dark narrow kitchen, into the ugly dark sitting room, and realizes he is sick of it.
“This is amazing,” he whispers to Ginny, who’s walking next to him. She squeezes his hand. The march isn’t starting for another half hour, so they decide to seek out Malfoy, Pansy, and Astoria.
“I know that,” Harry argues, not understanding where this is going. “As if I wasn’t part of those efforts.”
Five days later, Ginny and Luna are officially dating and Harry has learned to ride his motorcycle, collected an abundance of new bruises, and runs into Malfoy at the cafe-bookshop. Malfoy’s drinking iced coffee and reading
“Not if it’s yours,” mutters Harry darkly. Malfoy reaches over to pinch his side, but Harry squirms out of the way before he can reach him. Picking up the book again, Malfoy starts on ‘Knife’, the next poem. Harry can’t stop his eyes from closing as he reads aloud in his soft voice, letting Mary Oliver’s words wash over him, the afternoon light casting everything in the room in brilliant orange, sun streaming through the open window, illuminating the small square he lies in, burning red beneath his eyelids.
They make it to a grungy diner where they have to split into two separate tables because there’s too many of them to fit at one. Harry sits between Ron and Malfoy, across from Hermione and Luna. The waitress hands them a couple menus and places five glasses of water on the table.
“Er—” Harry fidgets. He’s always found it a bit uncomfortable when people praise him or thank him, and Ginny is no exception. Not sure how to respond, he instead changes the subject. “Are you hungry? Can we watch the Bake Off and order takeaway?”
“I’m just trying to imagine you as an eighty year old,” he wheezes. “Yelling at young children who step on your lawn, septum piercing and everything. I’d love to see it.”
Malfoy shakes his head. “No, I’m done making excuses. I had a privileged childhood and was raised by two parents who loved me and had basically everything I ever wanted and I
. Somehow, he finds the fact that Malfoy’s reading a Muggle book stranger than the fact that he’s queer. Harry shrugs. “I’ve been focusing on other things. Dorian Gray, really? Don’t you find that a bit on the nose, considering?”
“Harry,” he exclaims, gripping Harry’s arm tightly. His chest clenches in fear. “We forgot the hash browns.”
Some days Harry’s hit harder by the reminder of everything he’s lost than others. Today is one of those days, for whatever reason. He’d been fine all morning, but as the sun begins to sink behind thick clouds and dusk falls, he’s hit with such a longing and sadness that it physically hurts. There’s nothing Harry can do except put on a sad record and curl up in bed, the weight of three blankets over him despite the heat of the summer, and stare blankly at the ceiling. He’s not even sure if he’s thinking actual thoughts; there’s a cloud in his head that barely allows him to breathe let alone do anything else. Harry doesn’t know how long he lies flat on his back, listening to the same eleven songs over and over again. When a gentle knock sounds at his door and he’s able to rise, night has fallen and the moon is high in the sky.
Harry snorts. “Thanks for letting me know at the last possible minute, Gin. You and Blaise still going strong, then?”
“Oh.” Harry’s a bit thrown off. He thought they were having a good time, despite the intense conversation they’ve just had in the middle of it, and anyway he doesn’t want to go home just yet. There’s nothing for him to do there; he’d probably just end up sitting in bed and wasting the rest of the day away doing nothing productive. “Well, I still haven’t seen your flat,” he points out.
“It’s not a bad idea at all,” responds Luna. “I go to therapy.” She crosses her legs and leans back against the sofa.
Harry makes a face. She really was fantastic at guilt-tripping him into things. “Fine! Fine, I’ll come. But you’re paying for my drinks.”
said I would become an old ugly bat!” Malfoy retorts. “As if. Malfoys age very gracefully, I’ll have you know.” At this, Harry bursts out laughing. “What is it?” he snaps.
“And that’s the truth,” Luna agrees. “Not about him being cute, though he is. About how you being in a relationship with a guy doesn’t make you straight.”
“Let me out, Potter is suffocating me,” Malfoy whines, but no one except Harry hears him over the loud conversation and he’s forced to drop the matter. After several very uncomfortable minutes of Malfoy’s bony elbows digging into Harry’s side, they finish up, pay the check, and exit the diner.
After a while, Harry breaks the silence. “You’re really not that bad, you know.” His voice sounds miles away from him, but Malfoy doesn’t seem to notice.
Harry excuses himself for a quick bathroom break and to grab some water, and when he emerges it’s impossible to push his way through the crowd back to his friends. Giving up, he ends up dancing with a group of random strangers who welcome him into their little circle.
“Nice outfit,” Dean grins, slapping Harry on the back. Seamus and Dean are wearing matching rainbow shirts and look every bit like regular Muggles going to a pride parade.
Harry laughs. “Believe me, I know. That’s why I didn’t do them. Studying was even a struggle for Hermione, which is saying something.”
“Technically you did go back to school,” Malfoy points out, looking over at him. “You were always on about being an Auror, though.”
“Thanks,” she replies, taking his arm and leading them down the street. “Really, thank you for coming to meet them all.”
She rolls her eyes and bends down to pull on a pair of socks. “Keep this up and you won’t be. Ready to go? By the way, Blaise and some of his friends are meeting us there. I hope you don’t mind.”
Malfoy sneers. At this point, Harry thinks that sneering is just his automatic reaction whenever anyone says anything to him, because seconds later Malfoy looks much more pleasant and is responding to his question.
“I need your advice about something and I don’t want Ron to know yet because he’ll judge me,” she replies.
She rolls her eyes. “Why am I the decider of these things? Yes, we can get milkshakes and waffles. Go tell the others that we’re leaving.”
She rolls her eyes, pushing him forward. “Keep going, you great oaf. I know how much you hate talking to people who aren’t part of your immediate friend group, but it’ll be fine.”
Harry, quite used to Ginny’s peer pressure, shakes his head. “I know Gin, really, I don’t feel up to it. But have a great time. Say hi to everyone for me.”
Harry meets Ginny after her quidditch practice the next day. They haven’t caught up in a couple weeks, and have decided to go for happy hour drinks. Not long after Harry arrives at the pitch, Ginny walks up to him, her ginger hair in a ponytail, face red from the exercise and heat of the day.
Harry cuts his eyes at him. “We’ll see about that.” They stop at a deli at the end of the block and order two massive club sandwiches that take forever to arrive. They eat them on the walk home, and Harry ends up dropping half of his fillings on the sidewalk.
She hoists herself up and swivels around to fix him with a piercing look. “This is your fault, Harry.”
Malfoy ends up winning this round, distracting Harry by telling him that he saw some Dementors earlier in the park.
“Why are you even here?” Harry retorts. “Seriously, did you just come over here to make me miserable?”
Harry opts to sit on the grass, not wanting to take up unneeded space. He nods at Malfoy, who’s wearing a tight black t-shirt tucked into a pair of elegant olive-green slacks. He’s got on his rings as well, along with slim black boots that look extremely expensive and circular sunglasses with lenses so dark Harry can’t see his eyes.
He leans over to examine the menu in Harry’s hands, and Harry can feel his body heat through his thin cotton shirt. Malfoy must be equally as drunk as he is because he squints at the menu for far too long before answering. “Yes, they have hash browns,” he replies.
“This one’s called ‘Wild Geese’,” says Malfoy, and begins the poem. His voice is soft and a bit rough and Harry is soon lost in the world that Mary Oliver spins.
Harry wakes early the next morning feeling like someone hit him in the head with a bludger. His mouth is dry and tastes like something crawled into it overnight and died there. All of his muscles ache from sleeping on the hard floor.
He heads up to the roof of his building, seeing as he’s on the top floor now and it’s much closer than the street. He has to jiggle the handle a few times before it swings open, and once he’s emerged outside, Harry places a stone between the door and the frame so he won’t be locked outside all night.
The first night in the flat, all of Harry’s friends invite themselves over for a housewarming party. It was supposed to be a casual thing, Ginny had said she’d just mention it to a few people, but Neville arrives first with Hannah Abbott and it’s just dominoes from there. Seamus and Dean come next, enthusiastically greeting Harry and saying it’d been much too long since they’d last gotten together. Luna appears with Ron and Hermione, and then Ginny, Blaise, Pansy and Malfoy step out of the floo. Harry inwardly groans. As much as he loves his friends, this was turning into a much bigger event than expected. Even George and Angelina show; Harry is delighted that they’ve brought prototypes from Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes for everyone to test out. Sure, there might be some scorch marks on the ceiling the next day, but it would be worth it.
Harry leans back in his chair. “Good on you, mate,” he says, for lack of anything better. Letting out a huge yawn, he scoots his chair back and stands up, stretching. “ Not gonna lie, I’m getting pretty tired.”
Harry laughs. “Well, in that case there might not be.” Hermione fist bumps him and accepts a margarita from Seamus.
“Have you even ordered drinks yet?” Malfoy frowns and pushes in front of Harry, signaling to the girl working there. They order, and as they wait for their drinks, he eyes Harry. “What’s the matter with you?” he asks.
They’re almost at the Globe Theater when the first raindrop falls. The sky’s been overcast all day, but it’s London and so it’s usually grey — Harry hadn’t thought anything of it. He realizes just how bad his mistake was when the sky opens and rain begins pouring down.
“We talked to the Slytherins too, did you mention that? They were very pleasant.” Seeing Harry’s face, she adds, “ALL of them Harry, they were all very polite. I’m rather impressed that they came and spoke with everyone. I think a real effort is being made to heal the divide between all the houses. Anyway, I think Ginny had the most exciting night out of all of us.”
“You’re horrible at this game,” he taunts after they reach the ground, waving the Snitch in front of Harry’s face. Harry makes a grab for it but the Snitch is just out of reach and he ends up knocking both of them over onto the grass. Harry feels a bit bad for assaulting Malfoy like this, but needs must. After a brief scuffle he emerges with the Snitch and holds it out so Malfoy can’t snatch it back.
Harry watches the whole thing with amusement. This evening is certainly not turning out how he suspected, but somehow he doesn’t mind. Malfoy and Pansy begin to bicker, and soon Blaise joins in. They playfully tease each other for a while, not unlike Harry’s own friends. After a while, Ginny leans her head against his shoulder.
Malfoy, standing in the doorway, clears his throat; Harry had forgotten that he was still there. “I’ll leave you to it,” he says, nodding to the trio. “Have a good night.” Harry watches as he shuts the door gently behind him. After he leaves, Hermione lets out a little laugh.
“For what it’s worth, I’m sorry about that,” says Malfoy, glancing at Harry. Harry’s a bit surprised at the shift in conversation, the sincerity in his tone. “I don’t think I’ve ever apologized. It was a really shitty thing to do.”
Luna takes a bite of paneer and chews thoughtfully, examining Harry. “I thought I’d check in with you today,” she says. “I always feel horrible after big social gatherings. Like I’ve done something wrong, somehow. I can’t stop overanalyzing all the interactions I’ve had with people.”
Even Seamus is impressed with his outfit, and whistles as he sits down. “Bloody hell, Malfoy!” he exclaims. “Guess you didn’t spend all that time in the closet for nothing.”
“Did I hear about them,” scoffs Malfoy. “Blaise hasn’t shut up about it in my ear for the past four days.”
Arthur emerges and wipes his brow, leaving a smear of dark grease across his forehead. “Harry! Why yes indeed! I think there was nothing wrong with it in the first place, actually, and it just needed…what do they call it…petrol? Yes. But I wanted to get a good look before I handed it off to you.”
“This is quite good,” comments Malfoy after a few minutes of silently shoveling food into his mouth.
“Handed it off to me?” Harry shakes his head. “You can keep it, Arthur, I really have no use for a flying motorcycle. You could use something to keep you busy now that you’re retired, besides.”
“Nah, she won’t,” he responds, picking up his tea again. “That lady is sick of me by now. I’m sure she’ll be thrilled that I’m relaxing at home instead of spending every waking minute fixing the castle up.” Rolling his eyes at the wounded expression on Ginny’s face, Harry shoos her off. “You’ll be late if you keep this up! Goodbye! Have fun!”
“Where to now?” Ginny asks. “My place isn’t too far, we could easily walk there and watch a movie or something.”
“Seriously, Gin, I don’t want to be here,” he pleads. “I thought it was going to be just us tonight.”
the epidemic until 1985 because it primarily affects LGBT people and African-Americans. Clinton isn’t much better, as he hasn’t enacted legislation addressing the fact that almost 50% of HIV cases are people of color.”
The rest of their conversation gets a bit unintelligible from there, the alcohol doing most of the talking. But after the food is gone it seems to take a bit of a turn, as drunk confessions do as the night goes on, and Harry finds himself telling Malfoy about the Dursleys.
Ron shrugs. “No worries, mate. Consider it our housewarming gift to you.” He disappears the last beer bottle and makes his way to the door, Hermione following close behind. “You’re coming to Mum and Dad’s tomorrow, right?”
listen, when i began this fic i did not intend to make this many references to classic literature. it just happened. thank u for reading! hope u enjoy!
“Balcony,” decides Harry. Malfoy’s flat is bad enough, it doesn’t need the smell of weed on top of all the mess.
Once upstairs, Harry grabs a couple of towels from the linen closet and tosses one to Malfoy. “You can shower first,” he offers. “Do you need to borrow some clothes?”
Harry grimaces. “Yup. Got it in a...car crash,” he lies, remembering what Petunia had told him about its origins years and years ago. The guy seems to believe him easily enough, and they dance together for a while, until Harry finds that he’s suddenly kissing this stranger. It’s fun, he decides, relaxing into the kiss, and anyways this guy is really good at it. After several minutes of intense making out Harry eventually pulls away, smiling sheepishly.
In response to this, Malfoy rips up a handful of grass and chucks it at Harry’s face. It lands on Harry’s shirt and he brushes it away, still laughing. “Let’s go again,” he suggests. “I brought a Snitch, if you want.”
“You’re such a prat,” Harry says, looking over at him, and this is just enough to give Malfoy an edge and with a burst of speed he reaches forward and catches the Snitch.
Blaise, Malfoy, and Pansy are already sitting at a booth when Harry and Ginny arrive. Harry takes one look at them laughing at some inside joke and stops at the front of the room, refusing to go further. “Ginny!” Harry hisses. “I did not sign up for this.”
Harry finds himself taking the blunt from Malfoy’s fingers. Never in a million years did he expect to be getting high on the roof with Draco Malfoy, but then again, nothing in his life turned out to be normal. They stand like that for a while, passing it back and forth and admiring the sprawl of London below them. There’s a pleasant breeze, and it’s not too hot for a midsummer night. Harry tries to pat down his hair as the wind tears through it; he’s sure he looks absolutely ridiculous, at least compared to Malfoy, who somehow seems strangely elegant and very human with a blunt in his hand.
That night he apparates to Ron and Hermione’s flat for dinner, uninvited but knowing he will be welcome anyway. The pair are sitting on the couch drinking wine and greet Harry when he appears in the middle of the room.
Harry’s forgotten that same-sex marriage is still illegal in 1999. “LGBT people also experience extremely high rates of homelessness, so corporatizing Pride is just making it inaccessible to actual members of the community,” he adds.
“Oh, this?” Malfoy gestures to the septum piercing that has somehow appeared in his nose overnight. “Your little party ended a bit early and so after I left I thought to myself, what else could I do that will disappoint my father more than smoking pot with Harry Potter?”
“Come on,” Malfoy insists. “I can come up with one right now, ready? A haiku.” He clears his throat for dramatic effect and Harry rolls his eyes.
Harry doesn’t reply, just lets her words sink in. He knows it will take a while to believe them, but she’s right. There is no correct way to process everything that’s happened in his life. Or, the way he’s doing it is the right way, at least for him. They sit on the floor like that for a while, intertwined, among several takeaway containers holding the last uneaten bits of their food. After a while Harry extracts himself and reaches for the television remote.
“Exactly,” says Malfoy vehemently. “Fuck the neoliberal agenda. You can’t fight against injustice without also fighting against capitalism.”
“I’m tired,” Ginny complains, propping her feet up on a chair. She, Ron, Hermione, and Harry are sitting at a booth in the back of the club, sipping on water after many hours of drinking nothing but alcohol. “How do they
Harry stares at the note for a couple minutes. The letter is both formal and informal at the same time, but so typically Malfoy. When Harry asked him to play Quidditch he didn’t really think he’d agree. That, and the fact that seeing Malfoy’s full name written out like that is very strange. Harry blinks several times, reading over the signature again.
Per usual, Harry arrives at the weekly Weasley dinner before everyone else, even though he tried really hard this time to be just a tiny bit late. But he steps out of the Floo into an empty Burrow, except for Molly in the kitchen as she always is, and Arthur fiddling with something in the back, as
“It can’t be that bad,” he responds, already beginning to head out of the park. Malfoy hurries to catch up with him. “Is it far from here? Pansy mentioned you didn’t live too far from that bookstore we both like.”
He returns shortly with a glass of water and trades it for the joint. Harry thanks him, feeling much better after a few sips. Eventually the joint burns down to the nub and Malfoy grinds it out and places it in the ashtray before holding the door open for Harry to head back inside.
Ginny gives him an incredulous look. “They’ve always been friends. Blaise was a Slytherin, didn’t you know?” Seeing his expression, she sighs. “I forgot you didn’t remember him from school. Come on, it’ll be fine.” Before he can get another word in, she’s grabbed Harry’s hand and side-alonged him to face the Slytherins.
Malfoy gulps. Harry can tell that he’s thinking about their fight in the bathroom -- he is too, remembering Malfoy’s ear splitting scream, pale face, blood on the tile of the bathroom floor -- oh god, he thinks he’s going to be sick.
Malfoy ignores him and continues. “All I’m saying is that now that Blaise and Ginny are together, I’m sure we’ll be seeing a lot more of each other and I would rather avoid arguing every time, if it’s all the same to you.”
Dinner itself is uneventful. More people than usual show up, including Percy and his fiance, Penelope. Percy has mellowed out a bit over the last year but he’s always been slightly insufferable, so Harry and Ron assign themselves seats at the other end of the table.
Malfoy shrugs. “Don’t apologize to me, it’s your roof.” He has a fair point, and so Harry makes his way towards him.
Harry doesn’t think he’ll ever get used to these rapid mood swings, but tries to take it in good humor. “Just wondering,” he says lightly. “Seeing as I have absolutely nowhere to be.”
“Er, thanks,” Harry replies. He thinks he did an adequate job of dressing himself. Seamus hands Harry a beer and ushers him into the kitchen, where Ginny and Luna are decked out in lots of beads and singing to ABBA at the top of their lungs.
He returns with a soft t-shirt and a pair of old jeans that hopefully won’t offend Malfoy too much, and knocks softly on the bathroom door. The shower is on but Malfoy opens the door, wearing nothing but his trousers. Harry gulps as he catches a glimpse of the pale scars across his chest. He knows they already had this conversation, but still --
have a long day of learning how to fill out paperwork. And filing. Is that all interns are good for these days?” Hermione grimaces.
Harry trudges down the narrow staircase to the kitchen, where he makes himself a cup of coffee and scrounges around for something to eat. He decides to whip up a couple of eggs, and after eating them out of the pan in front of the sink, he heads back upstairs to shower and find something acceptable to wear.
Reaching out a delicate hand, Malfoy picks up his drink and follows him back to the table. Harry picks his way through the crowd, trying not to spill any vodka soda on his jeans while processing their conversation to the best of his partially-tipsy abilities. Getting along with Malfoy? What an evening this was turning out to be.
Malfoy studies him closely. After a long pause he says, “You’re not at all what I expected, Potter.”
Malfoy seems to get it immediately. “I only did my NEWTS because I didn’t know what else to do,” he confesses. “School is all I’ve ever known. I don’t know who I am without it. After everything had fallen apart, it was just the logical thing to do.”
The kettle whistles, and Harry pours two cups of tea, milk and honey for Ginny, milk and sugar for himself.
They ride back through the city at a more reasonable pace, Harry a little more cautious of hydroplaning and skidding out given the river of water that seems to be cascading down the street. The rain beats down on his shoulders and every inch of him is completely soaked to the bone, but it’s a warm summer thunderstorm and the smell of wet pavement is oddly comforting.
As if Dean’s conjured them into existence, Ron steps out of the Floo, Hermione following close behind. He whistles when he sees their decorations. “Very festive,” Ron says, nodding approvingly. “Hope we’re not too late.”
He doesn’t remember ordering but he must have because what seems like only seconds later, the waitress places a glorious waffle in front of him. Harry digs in, and it’s the most delicious thing he’s ever eaten. Next to him, Ron is slurping happily on his chocolate milkshake. Even Malfoy has indulged himself and is eating a huge stack of pancakes drenched in maple syrup.
“Really,” she confirms. “Of course it doesn’t immediately fix all your problems, but it’s good to talk through everything. I think you’d be surprised by how many people are feeling the same way as you, Harry.”
Malfoy sneers and glances at the expensive silver watch on his wrist. “As a matter of fact, I do have somewhere to be in twenty minutes.”
“Draco,” Pansy chides, but somehow Harry isn’t all that offended. Malfoy’s comment didn’t have any edge to it; it seemed like something he said out of habit rather than something he actually meant to be insulting.
The group meanders down the street to the nearest gay bar where they can drink and dance and celebrate. A whoosh of cold air greets Harry as he walks through the door, most welcome after spending hours in the sun. The bar is packed with people who’ve just come from Pride. Harry is quick to join the drinking and dancing; he and his friends throw themselves onto the dance floor and jump up and down to the music. He finds himself dancing with Ron and Pansy, quite the odd pairing indeed, but their energy is infectious and Harry can’t help but smile and smile and smile.
Breakfast in hand, he turns to look for a table. Out of the corner of his eye Harry spots a head of blond hair sitting in a window seat at the end of the café.
Harry is suddenly glad he wasn’t at the ball. It’s not that he has anything against any of the Slytherins – he spoke at their trials, in fact – but he doesn’t need their presence in his life right now. Right now, he is with his best friends and family, enjoying Molly’s terrific cooking, and finally celebrating the restorations after the war. Bringing himself back to the moment, Harry pokes Ginny in the side. “Heard you had quite the adventure last night. Care to fill me in?”
“Hey, Potter,” she greets him as he slides into the booth, directly across from Malfoy. “Nice work on the castle, by the way.”
“Thanks for cleaning everything,” Harry says to them, feeling a bit guilty that his friends had done all the work. “You really didn’t have to, you know."
“Hear, hear!” Dean says, raising his glass. “A toast to Kevin Richardson and his glorious eyebrows!”
“How are Granger and Weasley?” Malfoy asks, playing with the wooden stirrer in his drink. His voice is deeper than Harry remembers, a bit rough, and surprisingly soft.
Harry lets out a great sigh. “That is so unfortunate. Let me try again.” He clears his throat, earning a nasty look. Laughing, he begins his limerick.
“Do you smoke a lot?” Harry asks, changing the subject. He’s genuinely curious, now wondering if he was high that first time they met at the pub.
Malfoy snorts. “What a casual thing to drop in the middle of a sentence. But I guess I’ll have to watch it.”
“Right? Like we’re so stuck in the past with all the pureblood vs. Muggle-born shit, we haven’t even thought about other injustices going on. I think we’re making progress, though,” Seamus replies. “Things have really changed for the better in the past year. I thought the Slytherins were gonna get it real bad after the war, but I haven’t heard of people treating them any worse.”
“No!” exclaims Harry. “My aunt was obsessed with the books. When the TV drama came out she made us watch it like ten times. You know, the summer I was attacked by dementors and almost expelled. I’ve basically got the whole thing memorized.”
“Well, that makes two of us. Come on, let’s go back in. Everyone’s probably gone now, finally.” Harry climbs to his feet and reaches out a hand to help Malfoy up, and they head back downstairs to the flat.
“Are you sure you don’t want to come to the ball?” She frowns. “You spent all that time and effort in helping rebuild Hogwarts, and you don’t even want to celebrate its reopening?”
No one has any better ideas and so they meander to Ginny’s flat. Harry’s allowed to lead the group, even though he doesn’t really know where he’s going, and so he walks a couple feet in front of everyone, drunkenly enjoying the summer night. His head is no longer spinning and he’s now able to appreciate the beauty of London at night as he half-listens to his friends talk about something absolutely ridiculous. A wave of nostalgia hits him; he’s been through a war and came back from the dead and here he is, celebrating Pride with people he would never expect to be friends with. Nothing could be better than this moment.
“A painting!” he gasps. “Not a chance. Although, I will admit there is one of my grandfather hanging in the dining room.”
“I’m gonna go home,” Harry tells Ginny as he finishes up and puts his plate into the sink. “I need a nap.”
Ginny removes her hands from her face and looks up at him from her place on the floor. “I just don’t think I’m cut out for monogamy, or something.”
“That was crazy,” declares Malfoy as Harry parks his motorcycle in front of his building. “You’re a fucking crazy driver.”
Seeing as there’s no food in his house, Harry decides to stop at a coffee shop for breakfast. He’d spotted a little independent coffee shop down the street when he was moving in, he thinks it’s attached to a bookstore too, so that’s where he heads.
“It’s in Finsbury Park,” replies Malfoy. “Fucked that they’re charging ten pounds for people to attend. I don’t even know what a pound is.”
“Missed you yesterday,” she says. “The work you did on the castle…phenomenal, Harry, really. It looks amazing. Good as new.”
Harry rests his cheek on the top of her head, her hair tickling his face. “Not sure about nice, but honestly, they’re not bad. I could use another drink, though.”
“Merlin, Malfoy,” Harry says in wonder. His flat is actually gorgeous, it’s at the top of an old Victorian building and half of the walls are red brick, extending meters above Harry’s head before meeting a pointed ceiling. There is a huge fireplace in the middle of the wall and above it the mantle is packed full of books. Not to mention the dark mahogany bookshelves that line the walls, going all the way up to the ceiling. But Harry will admit, it’s a mess. There’s a laundry bin on top of the kitchen table, clothes spilling out of it and onto the floor. The kitchen looks like it hasn’t been cleaned in a week, dirty dishes and mugs stacked precariously in the sink. Books and papers and dirty napkins are strewn across the glass coffee table, blankets piled up on the couch, shoes everywhere, half-empty teacups sit on the floor in front of the sofa, and what looks suspiciously like muddy footprints trailing towards a closed door that Harry can only assume is the bedroom.
The rest of the group congregates around them, first Pansy and Astoria and then Malfoy appears, his blond hair sticking to his forehead and t-shirt clinging to his chest from sweat. He wipes his face with the back of his hand.
“Merlin, Ginny, way to warn a man!” Smiling, Harry sets down his mug and attempts to mop up the wet patch on his jeans with his blanket. “What can I do for you this fine evening?”
what you’d never forgive me for?” Malfoy shakes his head. “I must say, your priorities seem a bit warped, Potter.”
Harry pulls on a pair of shorts and sneakers, not bothering to change out of the t-shirt he wore to bed, and steps out the door. He breaks into a run once he’s on the street, enjoying the fresh morning air and the birds chirping in the trees. Though he doesn’t usually run he’s not unfit, and so over forty-five minutes later he ends back up at his house, out of breath and sweaty.
They apparate back to Ginny’s flat, which lies right around the corner from Ron and Hermione’s. Harry throws himself onto her sofa as she heads into the bathroom to shower. He amuses himself by flipping through one of her Quidditch magazines, musing if he should get a new broom or not. He hasn’t flown in ages; maybe the new Nimbus will inspire him to get back into it.
thanks for reading! this chapter is absolutely so stupid but i hope u got something out of it anyway lol
poetry, smoking but on a balcony this time, boys are gonna get hurt from all the eye rolling they do
“Me too,” admits Malfoy. “I wasn’t sure both the stir fry and I were going to survive the trip from the kitchen to the table.”
Harry stands at the entrance to Malfoy’s flat, mouth agape. He was not making it out to be much worse than it is. Malfoy’s home is a terror. It goes against everything Harry’s ever known about him.
After a bit of wandering around, Luna spots Malfoy and Astoria sitting on a blanket under a tree. They look up as Harry and his friends approach, scooting over on the blanket to make room.
Harry rolls his eyes. “Yes, I’m aware. I’m sure I was greatly missed. I just forgot you were there.”
Harry manages not to get himself in trouble until the weekend, which is when he and all of his friends are attending the London Pride march. He’s never been able to go before for several reasons, including the fact that he had spent his summers either trapped at the Dursley’s or on the run from Voldemort, and also had no idea he was bi until fairly recently.
“Were you not taught how to eat properly?” Malfoy scoffs as a chunk of tomato slips out of Harry’s sandwich.
A smile curves Malfoy’s lips. “From what I’ve heard of him, that checks out. Big reader, are you? Bit surprising, I thought you couldn’t read.”
. Maybe they should start addressing each other by their first names, Harry thinks, seeing as they’re sort of becoming friends now. In any case, that’s a matter for another time. He dashes off a reply and then tries to keep himself busy for the next few hours before noon but finds it quite impossible to get any reading done in his anticipation.
The book is lying on the sofa; Harry tosses it to him and joins him on the ground, lying on his back beside Malfoy, who opens the book and rolls over on his stomach so it’s easier to read.
“Shut up, Potter,” Malfoy says before Harry can say anything. “Your clothes are absolutely ridiculous, I don’t want to hear it.”
Harry looks over at the boy next to him. Malfoy is leaning against the rail, arms resting casually atop his knees. He’s playing with his rings, Harry notices, twisting them around his fingers as he stares off into the night.
He shrugs and stabs at the remains of his curry with a fork. “I dunno. Maybe.” Luna waits patiently as he struggles to articulate his thoughts. “I just think that everyone was able to grieve right after the war, like when we were going to everyone’s funerals, they properly got out their emotions.”
Hermione responds carefully. “I think people understand that you’re having a hard time right now, and that having fun at a party isn’t always easy. But we did miss you after you left, Harry, no matter what you might think. This was your party after all.”
“So good,” Luna agrees. The conversation pauses as they concentrate on their food. Suddenly Ron looks up, an expression of alarm on his face.
Ginny leans over to kiss Blaise. “This was lovely, good to see you Pansy, Malfoy. Let’s do this again soon.”
“Do you have any idea where they’ll be?” Hermione asks. “There’s so many people here, it’ll be impossible to find them.”
Harry smiles at him before turning away to cheer with the rest of the crowd. Luna drops back to talk to them until the procession ends at Trafalgar Square.
Malfoy snorts. “Not everything is about you, you know. I came over here because Ginny and Blaise were being overly adorable and Pansy was being annoying. That woman, honestly.”
. Harry knows if he stays he’ll fall asleep right here on the carpet, and so with massive effort he hoists himself to his feet. Malfoy eyes him, not moving from the carpet.
Harry rubs his eyes. “I’m really sorry. I guess we’ve both been massively shitty people. I-- I wish I could take it all back, just so you know.”
He nods. “I’m not gonna lie, Gin, that’s big. I know you’ve only been together for a couple months, but still.”
isn’t a good idea, but he doesn’t care right now. It’s three in the afternoon and he’s got nothing better to do than make a couple bad decisions — and really, he’s done much stupider things in his life. “Sure,” he agrees.
Harry laughs. “Well, you tell me. Do you have a painting of yourself hidden somewhere in the Manor?”
“I’ll take that as a compliment,” he grins, standing up and stretching. “Let me know if you need any recommendations. I’m gonna check out the bookshop.” Harry pats Malfoy’s shoulder as he heads over to bus his coffee mug and plate before going into the adjoined bookstore.
“Oh, speaking of the Slytherins,” says Ginny as she sips her margarita, “we’ll probably run into Malfoy and Pansy and Pansy’s girlfriend at the parade. They said they’d try to find us.”
“Goodness,” she says, peering through the back door to see what he could be up to. “You better go, Harry, I’ve never heard him yell like that.”
“Not me!” Hermione protests. “The others, maybe. I have a reputation to uphold, you know. Didn’t want to give McGonagall a glimpse of what goes on during pub nights.”
He nods. He feels a little anxious, sure, but mostly he’s excited to celebrate with his friends. Luna hugs him tightly, and then they step out the door. Seamus and Dean don’t live too far from downtown London, so there’s no need to take the Tube to get to the march. As they near Hyde Park, Harry sees countless other people coming from all directions on their way to Pride. His heart swells with the knowledge that there are so many other people like him out there. He’s thrilled to finally celebrate his sexuality with his community, to be out to the world. Nothing can compare to the feeling of liberation he feels as he sees the huge crowd, full of people covered in glitter and rainbows and carrying signs.
Malfoy snorts. “How’s that for alliteration. In that case, I’ve got a question for you -- why didn’t you get your NEWTS with the rest of the Gryffindors?”
“Ah, yes, I thought you might bring that up. As it happens,” replies Ginny, “we got to talking during the ball. Not about anything in particular, he asked how quidditch was going, apparently he loves the Holyhead Harpies. And we talked about the castle and the restorations. Blaise’s been very involved with children who lost their parents during the war, which, I mean, good for him. But mostly just life in general. He really is a charming man. And hung like a—”
As he waits for the bartender to take his order, Harry takes advantage of the moment alone to close his eyes. He’s the kind of tired that makes his eyes burn when he closes them, tonight he really wasn’t prepared to make small talk with three people he hasn’t seen in a year. Harry just wants to go home, but then remembers the oppressive silence of Number 12 Grimmauld Place, and he really doesn’t want to go back there at the end of the night.
“Don’t hurt yourself,” Malfoy says as Harry tips the contents of the pan into a bowl. Harry hands it to him, along with a serving spoon, and they sit at the table to enjoy the meal.
“I see now where you got all your bruises from,” Malfoy mutters into Harry’s ear. He just grins as the light changes to green and they’re off again, approaching Big Ben as they cross the Thames.
She sighs, exasperated. “Really, Harry? We’re already here, come on. I knew you’d act like this and that’s why I didn’t tell you earlier, okay? But you’re my best friend and I really want you and Blaise to get along, it would mean a lot to me.”
The rain has completely stopped but both of them are soaking wet. Harry pulls off his helmet and shakes his head, spraying Malfoy with water droplets.
Malfoy scoffs, suddenly sounding much more like the boy Harry’s used to. “The ball, Potter. Unfortunately you did not grace us with your presence, but everyone else who’s ever set foot in Hogwarts was there, you know.”
“Appreciate it,” Ron mutters sarcastically. “Would have also appreciated not knowing his dick size.”
“Are you coming up or what?” Ginny calls out the window, her red hair whipping around her face in the wind. Rolling his eyes, he makes his way back up the stairs to his flat.
didn’t have a long day learning how to fill out paperwork. Seriously, Harry, you dodged a bullet by deciding not to become an Auror. At this rate my job is going to be 80% bureaucracy and 20% field work. Merlin.”
“No need to be sarcastic,” Malfoy drawls. “Although I’m surprised you were able to forget so quickly that Granger and I are friendly.”
The way Malfoy’s gone all defensive doesn’t escape Harry’s notice and he immediately feels guilty. “I’m not making fun of you, or anything,” he replies. “I get it, you know? Sorry if it seemed like I was poking fun.”
It’s a whole ordeal. Seamus and Dean are hosting a party before the parade begins later in the afternoon, so Harry arrives at their little apartment around noon. He hadn’t been quite sure what to wear, and ended up pulling on his favorite jeans and calling Ron to ask to borrow a pink t-shirt (of which he had many, for no reason Harry could discern besides the fact that he liked them).
“Whatever you say, mate,” Ron says sagely. “Honestly, that explains why he’s been so tolerable these days.”
Ginny shrugs. “Nah, you had other things going on. He was in your year, and full disclosure – you might be seeing him around. I’m just warning you in advance.”
Malfoy straightens up. “Goyle,” he says proudly. Taking a look at Harry, he adds cautiously, “It’s kind of strong, by the way.”
“Well, when you put it that way,” Malfoy sneers. “I’m sure announcing to the world that I’m a raging queer would have him rolling over in his grave, but I wanted to add a little something just in case.”
“Really?” He’s a bit startled by this confession; it seemed like after the war she’d adjusted back to regular life more easily than the rest of them. Although, now that he thinks about it, it was probably due to her therapy.
Harry waves awkwardly to Pansy and Malfoy, the latter of whom crooks an elegant eyebrow and takes a sip of his drink, before following Ginny as she sweeps out of the bar. They emerge onto a crowded street full of people hurrying past the small pub on their way home from work. The setting sun casts a golden light over all the buildings and as dusk approaches, London is no longer sweltering hot.
“Top left drawer,” he calls, going straight to the sofa and pulling out the different cartons. Harry sets everything on the floor, deciding that eating at the table isn’t worth the effort. Luna rejoins him with two tall glasses of water as well and hands one over. They eat in silence for a while, just enjoying the meal. Harry’s not in the mood to talk and Luna is never one to force anything out of him, always happy to just sit in silence. Sort of like Malfoy, he thinks, and then promptly pushes the thought out of his head.
After the better part of an hour spent saying hi to everyone and catching up, Harry finds a moment of reprieve in the kitchen. His head is beginning to ache from the loud music and nonstop conversation. He takes off his glasses and rubs his eyes, but finding it doesn’t do much of anything, decides to step out and get some fresh air.
“Whatever,” grumbles Malfoy. He waves his wand, sending the clothes back into the basket and the dirty mugs into the sink, but it doesn’t do much. Harry wants to offer to help, but knows that Malfoy would just take offense at that and so he leaves it alone. He heads over to the sofa, stacking the books that lie on the floor onto the coffee table and folding up the blankets and laying them over the back of the couch before taking a seat.
for a critique of my style?” she says, tossing her towel over the back of a chair and doing up the buttons on her jeans. “They’re amazing. Playing with them is a dream come true, really.” Ginny pauses, contemplative, and tucks in her cream-colored blouse. “I won’t be playing much this season, of course, but even practice with everyone is incredible. I can’t wait for you to come to our first game.”
Malfoy looks down, as if he’s just realizing what he’s doing. “No, not really. I found some of them in different shops over the years and some of them are family heirlooms. I just like wearing them.”
“Oi! Over here!” Seamus calls from by the door, interrupting Harry’s train of thought. He’s standing beside Luna, Ginny, and Dean. Harry is correct in that he has more plans for the group and soon they find themselves at another bar, and when that one gets boring they are off to another.
