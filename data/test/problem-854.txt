. You’re not mad?”
for merlin’s sake. “Still not used to having your own clothes?”
“Who is the Potions master who heads up this Netherland group?” Slughorn asks sharply.
finishing bringing in all of Draco’s luggage, he didn’t leave. Instead, he had the nerve to sit down on the bed across from Draco. Potter’s bed. “You have way too many clothes,” he commented unnecessarily.
“You still have time to take it back. Get rid of that stupid sling and apologise.”
Malfoy snorted. “I think you’ll find she’s not quite my type.”
Just as he had all those years ago, Malfoy opened up from his face to his chest, as if slashed with an invisible force. And there was blood. More blood than Harry remembered. It was already pooling around Malfoy’s body as he slumped to the floor.
“You said
Thinking fast, and heading into damage control, Draco fished another two glasses off a waiter before following Potter in. “What are you so mad about?” He asked, holding a glass out for Potter.
Harry pulled back immediately. “I’m sorry. Is that not okay?” He asked, ever the literal perfect specimen of human Draco had ever encountered.
However Potter had other ideas. “No, it’s not,” he wheezed quietly between laughter. How Potter had gone from shouting to laughing in seconds was completely nonsensical.
die.”
“Yes,” he says after a second. Draco strains his ears but he knows he has no hope of hearing. He can only hope Pansy is not in the mood to embarrass him tonight.
“So, that’s the worst dare you could think of?” Malfoy drawled in a voice that wasn’t quite as bored as it was probably intended. “Grow up, Potter.”
“Doesn’t matter,” Malfoy said, looking down. “Another joke that would go over your head I suspect.”
“I don’t think you’re easy to seduce at all,” Draco returned. It was an honest answer, but also carefully picked to appease Potter.
” he whispered back.  Draco supposed Potter was a little too close to focus on forming his own sentences in return. That was fine. Draco thought he had it well under control on his own.
“I don’t know what you’ve done to me, Potter, but I’m not having a bar of it.” Draco pushed past Potter and made his own dramatic exit before Potter could continue his.
notice Malfoy’s behaviour? He leaves class early, he never comes to meals, he says good morning to Harry! It’s all very obvious to anyone watching him. Not that Harry makes a habit of watching him. He has just been worried about the effects of his potion is all.
Draco slumped back – he had somehow found himself at the very tip of his seat, leaning into the pitch. His heart pounded against his chest, as if it wished to escape.
“I don’t know.”
Draco took a step closer so he could actually look down at Potter, Auror training or not, and regain at least some control over the situation. “Don’t play coy with me, Potter. Here you are, at my place of work,
Draco snorted. “That’s your big revelation? It’s hardly news. I don’t hate you either, Potter. Because I’m not a child. Obviously.”
Draco acted quickly, detangled himself from Harry and apparating to Teddy’s side where he had fallen in the dirt, while Harry calmly walked the five metres.
“Can I hear – “
Draco pulled the jersey back on.
“The Netherlands,” Professor Slughorn repeats tonelessly, obviously sceptical.
“I asked if you were a doctor, Potter.” Draco repeats coldly.
But before he was given the spotlight, the content of the dares made the choice a little bit harder. Draco wasn’t fussed that Weasley had been dared to take off his pants or that Pansy had already kissed Luna twice - once on her turn when she dared Luna to kiss her, and then once on Luna’s turn when Luna did the same thing back. (It was technically against the rules to dare someone who had already had their turn - but with Pansy in charge, no one was going to question it.)
“Mary and Mitchell Dunberg,” Hermione says drily, not looking up.
Hermione turns back to him. “
Malfoy looks up from the knife and shoots a wide smile at Harry. In this context with a knife in one hand, wand in the other, approaching Harry, he looks positively frightening.
Harry could feel Malfoy’s eyes on him, but he still kept his head down. His blush had not yet died and he sure as hell wasn’t going to give Malfoy the satisfaction of seeing it.
“Draco, be a dear and help me move this table?”
, Potter. It’s polite.”
“No,” he said quietly, his face pained. Then his eyes lit up and he started to smile until the Veritaserum made him add, “But I used to.”
Draco turned his head, embarrassed by the blush he could feel on his cheeks. “Obviously.”
‘’I knew you’d come.”
“Wait,” Harry’s mouth yelled out without consulting his brain.
“That’s not it,” Harry interrupted. “I never wanted to hurt anyone, or kill anyone. But you.
“And how was I supposed to
And because Harry couldn’t help himself: “When you realise you do like taking orders, Malfoy, you know where to find me.”
Potter sat down without hesitation, not even attempting to play it cool. It was actually a little intimidating how little Potter seemed to have to control his actions. Draco could only aspire to reach that level of comfort in himself.
“But not by you," Malfoy says raising one eyebrow perfectly.
“I know, just give me half an hour, please and then I’ll come and meet you,” Harry promises.
“Okay,” Harry said simply, and Draco knew he meant it. That Harry would not push the subject ever again out of respect for Draco’s wishes.
Mrs Dunberg nods mutely, and opens the door wider, gesturing for them to enter. Her fingers are long and bony with nails clearly bitten down to the skin. The rest of her body is covered in long scratches. A terrible image of Malfoy, half werewolf, half man with claws as long as his fingers springs to Harry’s mind unbidden. He shakes it away. Mrs Dunberg escorts them into a small sitting room which must also double as a bedroom since there is a dirty mattress lying in the corner. She takes a seat on an old sitting chair.
“Okay.” Potter says, not looking up at the waiter.
“Here I was thinking your head couldn’t get any bigger.”
responsibility. I can’t just sit in my dorm like a good little boy and forget that I did this to him. And he’s sad, Hermione. So sad. I can see it. I want to…no, I
Now, three years later, Draco was his husband, and another father to Teddy. And Harry was absolutely and completely in love with him.
“What did you have in mind?” Harry asked.
The elation Harry had dared to hope for earlier finally showed on Draco’s face in the form of one of his breath-taking smiles. Harry felt his heart return to its proper place between his lungs, albeit still thumping erratically.
“It didn’t work.” Potter stepped back from Draco’s bedside, his head hung low.
Harry rolled his eyes. “You’re taking this a bit too seriously.”
Malfoy waved a hand dismissively beneath the water. “What’s the point of winning if you can’t have fun doing it? I know you had fun too, Potter. You’re not angry you lost, you’re angry because, as much as you’re trying to deny it you can’t help it: you
“I’m sorry. Can you just pretend that I didn’t…that I never…I’m going to – “
Draco smiled in that way he often did when he thought Harry wasn’t looking. Except there was no mistaking Harry’s gaze.
Malfoy’s head turns back to look down at Harry. He’s wearing that humourless smile again. “It’s not even, Potter. It’s not even close to even.”
“Watch me.”
“What?” Malfoy takes a step backwards. “Where did–”
“Pansy,” interrupts Zabini, “no need to explain to Potter. He doesn’t care about Draco.”
Harry leant his head back into Draco’s neck and breathed in. “It smells like you.”
“But you’ve thought about it. I’m quite a talented Legilimens, Potter. You have to be careful what you let sit at the surface of your mind.”
Malfoy’s hand had appeared out of nowhere, his fingers curling over the snitch right before Harry’s eyes.
, Harry wants to respond,
Harry shrugs. “I didn’t think it was important.”
“You’re telling me there’s nothing at all you want?”
“Harry,” Hermione runs up to him as soon as he enters. “Don’t do anything–”
“Do you think I’m hornier this time of year or something?” Potter’s voice was teasing, not angry.
Harry looked up at Malfoy and almost dribbled the firewhisky back into his cup. Malfoy had crossed his legs over and perched his head on his arms, staring down at Harry intently across the circle. Harry quickly composed himself and swallowed.
, it’s not finished. He has no idea what the effects will be. It could be dangerous. So, out of obligation, he asks:
“Well, there’s this one fantasy that
An uproar from the audience drew Harry’s attention to Malfoy. He had seen the snitch. He was racing toward mid field and there it was, Harry could see it now, the tiny gold fluttering ball. Harry was hurtling forward immediately, approaching the snitch from the opposite direction to Malfoy so that to the untrained eye it might have looked as if they were simply planning on barreling into each other like some sort of magical jousting tournament.
(See the end of the chapter for
Potter looked at him strangely.  “Wednesday? November Third? Why do you - “
He didn’t know how Potter knew it was his birthday. He purposefully hadn’t said anything. But here Potter was at his door, singing some silly muggle song and holding a French Apple Cake. Draco’s favourite – he hadn’t said anything about that either, had he?
Draco looked down at his arm. The dark mark had faded back into his skin and the stinging sensation had reduced to a dull ache - a reminder of the pain. It would seem as if his expected and yet impromptu time with Potter was over for the day. And now he had a charming erection to deal with. On his own.
“Wait, are you saying…” Malfoy slaps a hand to his head as if he’s just thought of something, but exaggerated to a ridiculous degree. “Gosh, Potter, surely you can’t mean you’ve been dreaming about me…in compromising positions?”
“What are you doing?” Zabini asked.
He turns back to Hermione and follows her gaze. His wand lies on the floor just outside Malfoy’s cage. The wand used to kill him. Or at least attempt to kill him. He bends down beside the cage to snatch it up and can’t help but stare into the cage, into the eyes of Draco Malfoy,
Potter’s eyebrows have a little party on his face before deciding to drop dangerously close to his eyes. “Why won’t you let me take you to hospital?” He asks, but it’s gentle. Of course it’s gentle. It’s Harry fucking Potter. Saviour of the Wizarding World and now he’s here to save Draco.
In the cage, there is only one Draco Malfoy, hair shooting up in weird angles, as if he’s been struck by lightning. His shirt looks like a patchwork design, almost as if the spell didn’t know which clothes to keep him in. And his eyes dart around the room frantically, landing anywhere but on Harry.
Recognition passes over his face immediately. “Ahhh. Sit down, Harry. Sit down.”
“Are we…dating now, then?” Draco asked quietly.
Monday? “What about tomorrow night?” Draco asks quickly. He needs to have dinner with someone on Sunday as well. He had assumed it would be Potter again. He was relying on it being Potter again.
“What are you doing up here?”
Mr Weasley dusted the ash from his shoulders. ‘Well– ah– you see– I’ve just been speaking with the new Minister via floo call and– how do I put this?– he’s in a similar predicament.”
Harry was on his way to the kitchens during one of his free periods – it wasn’t technically breaking the rules to visit now that he was a Hogwarts teacher – when he heard it.
Draco takes slow steps forward towards them. “I don’t have to ask you.”
Draco Malfoy
Harry nodded, wiping his hands on his trousers. “Yes.”
“Are you really this daft?” Ron started, but Hermione shushed him.
That shut Malfoy up. He gaped at Harry for a moment before he seemed to realise what he was doing and snapped his jaw shut. “You…like…me,” he choked out.
“Who?” Draco asked, mimicking Potter’s position (with a healthy, unassuming thirty or so centimetre gap between them).
Hermione nods, dashing back to her desk to take notes. She starts jotting things down, ignoring Harry, and Harry thinks perhaps he’s off the hook when she looks back up sharply.
Malfoy paused, the bottle at his lips, and regarded Harry with a curious expression. The rest of the circle watched on, their game of truth or dare, hardly begun, and already interrupted.
No. He did not just think that. Fucking merlin’s beard.
“Fancy a game of chess?”
“I want to help.” No, he
“Ah. Yes. It’s…with…” Hermione begins slowly, all the while Harry is cursing internally that they hadn’t worked out Hermione’s story in greater detail beforehand. Of course Slughorn would ask who with. “…an experimental Potions…group…in the Netherlands.”
“My friends kind of paired off and I felt a bit awkward so I left,” Potter said. “Plus the game tomorrow. I probably shouldn’t have drunk at– ”
“Go on then, Potter. Ask me.”
in disgust.
“Then, why’d you call?” Potter asked, sweetly.
“Something?” Draco prompted, a hand coming up to push Harry’s long hair from his face. It flopped right back down but Draco kept repeating the motion anyway.
Harry watched Draco’s pale eyelashes flutter. “I’m not following.”
came their way). It was light and high-pitched (the laugh, not the shhh), and nothing like Harry expected Draco’s genuine laugh to sound like. He had never heard it before.
“Only because I couldn’t find mine. I did have a suspicion…”
“What the hell, Malfoy?”
Harry wants to yell at Malfoy to stop calling him that, but he can’t. For once, Malfoy isn’t provoking him, well not purposefully at least it seems. He can’t fight someone speaking so calmly. If it weren’t for that smile, he would have thought Malfoy was teasing him, but he’s not. He’s asking him a genuine question.
“Yes,” Draco said, taking a particular interest in the pillow behind Harry’s head, “I do.”
The moon isn’t visible yet, still subservient to the sun before darkness descends, but Harry can feel it anyway, watching him, creeping over his skin, waiting to take him over. He shudders and keeps walking, focusing on one foot in front of the other, holding onto his humanity for as long as the day allows.
Harry shrugged. “Ginny told him about it last week.”
Malfoy’s breath tickles Harry’s lips. Harry slowly closes the rest of the distance and finally puts his lips to Malfoy’s.
“Get fucked, Malfoy,” Harry muttered back automatically.
Potter had invited Draco out with his friends a couple of times in the first week but Draco – stupid and closed off as he was – had kept declining, convinced Potter was only being polite. He only regretted saying no once Potter stopped asking.
With Malfoy taken care of, Draco, or at least a version of Draco Malfoy rushes to Harry’s side whispering the counter curse to release Harry from the bands of smoke surrounding his body before pulling him into his arms. “I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m sorry,” he says again and again, his voice back to that sweet gentle tone Harry’s ears welcome. Harry relaxes into those arms. He’s confused, exhausted and scared, but he feels safe here. And that will have to do for now.
Draco stopped them under a bright streetlight in a small laneway. It wasn’t a particularly seedy laneway, nor was it particularly clean. The light above them flickered occasionally, but not often enough to be distracting. It was simply unremarkable. Harry couldn’t understand why they had stopped.
“There is none. I just wanted to find a way to lure you into my dormitory.”
being a bit ridiculous but there was no need for Potter to lose his cool completely.  He couldn’t very well continue their argument when Potter was laughing.
“Why - “
Draco slumped down in bed slightly. If he sunk far enough, he could disappear beneath the sheets, and perhaps then, Potter would drop the subject.
“They’re not assumptions. Bones and I talk about you all the time. And Peters, the bastard, was bragging last week because he was alone in the office with you for a full hour on Monday.”
“Who told you?” Draco asked again, a little louder, his voice raspy.
If you had told Harry Potter, back in his first year of Hogwarts, that he’d be sharing custody of a child with Draco Malfoy, he would have laughed. Loudly. But here he was, fifteen years later, and one of Teddy Lupin’s two legal guardians.
He covers himself with the invisibility cloak and spells himself between the gates.
Draco gestures to Potter. “He will.”
, and not make a sound? Not make a sound when under the desk, Potter was taking him to
“FIVE!?”
The snitch fluttered in front of his fingertips. Just one inch further and he’d have it. The snitch would be his. Gryffindor would win, only by 30 points – the Slytherin chasers were impressive this season – but still a win all the same. Harry shifted his body as far forward as he dared – careful not to tilt the broom forward and lose his balance. He strained his arm to grasp –
?” He asked. It didn’t make sense. Potter was the boy who lived, the golden boy, the Wizarding World’s saviour. He got everything he wanted. How could he not have clothes?
“It’s fine.” Draco says as he quickly picks them both up and hastily cuts into a meatball. It’s exceedingly dry inside. Draco has no intentions of eating it, but he pushes it around his plate regardless. He senses Potter still staring at him, so he carefully twists his fork and nibbles on a piece of spaghetti. It tastes like dry toast. He wants to gag, but Potter’s eyes are on him so he covers it with a small cough.
“No,” snaps Mrs Dunberg, her voice clear now, “I don’t have time for this. If you’re finished with your questions, I want you both to leave.”
Draco clutched his champagne glass a touch tighter when his eyes locked onto Blaise’s across the grand ballroom. He looked away immediately but the damage was already done: Blaise was making his way over.
Can you please explain to me what it is you’re trying to do? Because, for the life of me, I can’t think why’d you’d willingly humiliate yourself like this. How can you be so
did this to me!” Malfoy raises a sharp accusatory finger at Harry. “And if I die, it’s
(He was wrong.)
“I mean, I don’t care about Malfoy but I don’t want him to be hurt.”
And when it comes (yes pun, motherfucking pun here) to the end, and Malfoy leans down and presses his lips hungrily over Harry’s for the first time while they both finish into their hands and over each other, Harry could just fucking melt. In fact, maybe he does. Because the next thing he knows he’s waking up in his own bed. And it’s really not the bed he wants to be in right now.
“That’s not why I watch you,” Harry said quietly. How was he going to explain this?
Potter laughed – a simple carefree chuckle that Draco felt at the back of his neck. “You
He keeps the Marauder’s map open in his hands, glancing down every few steps anxiously just to confirm that little dot remains put. The closer he gets, the more excited he becomes. He’s going to find out where Malfoy goes every night. He might even get an understanding of Malfoy’s strange behaviour. Although he probably shouldn’t get ahead of himself. Still, the dot remains.
Draco tried not to - he didn’t want to give Harry the satisfaction - but he heard it spill from his lips anyway: the most pathetic whimper. No one else but Harry could reduce him to this.
“Then, what are we doing?”
“Yes.”
“I thought it would matter to Draco," Hermione says.
“Not if you don’t apologise,” he teases, picking up his broom and backing up, preparing to head back to the castle, expecting
But now, all Draco can do is stare at the clock, anticipating Potter’s arrival. He’s both anxious to see Potter, in the light of his outburst the last time they were together, and excited, in the light of Potter being Potter.
“With what curse?” Draco’s eyes were piercing and analytical, giving Harry the odd sensation that Draco already knew exactly what he was thinking. But he couldn’t. Or they wouldn’t be having this conversation at all.
“Phileas Metriage?”
“Of course, sir, of course,” The maître de says with a partial bow. As soon as he turns away, Potter’s fake smile drops.
Draco held Harry’s eye the entire time as he slowly dropped to his knee. Right there in the lane. He didn’t even look first to check if the spot might dirty his robes. But Harry was certain he’d complain about a mark later.
Harry - now Mr Observant for some infuriating reason despite his absent glasses - noticed. “You can…if you want to.”
“What do you think you’re doing?” Draco demanded, stepping between Potter and his trunk. He couldn’t have Potter going through his things, his clothes, his
Hermione leans forward and talks quietly. “Then maybe you can just be there for him. You don’t have to solve anything. You can just be there.”
“It…wasn’t terrible,” Harry admitted. “We’re shouldn’t talk about this in front of Teddy,” he added as an afterthought, eyeing Teddy past Draco’s head. He certainly appeared to be asleep but Harry knew better than to believe it.
He doesn’t look back until he’s outside the wards. Malfoy stands at the gates, wand still raised. “If you still want to talk, go through my contact. I won’t have strangers turning up at my house unannounced,” he says to the air, before turning and beginning the long walk back across the Manor’s lawn.
And right now, his priority was Harry Potter’s cock. Because the dreamy bastard had stopped laughing and was stroking himself, naked on the desk, staring right at Draco - although Draco suspected he couldn’t see much without his glasses. Still, it was lewd and debauched and utterly fantastic.
But his senses are returning, his eyes opening.
He was just debating internally whether it was morally appropriate to postpone the essay in favour of making a much different use of Potter’s jersey when the door swung open. Draco snapped his laptop shut.
is the most romantic place in Hogsmeade?” He repeated in disbelief. Yes, Harry supposed it
Harry Potter had literally fallen into his dormitory. On November third.
But Potter’s moment came first - Draco could tell by the change in pitch of Potter’s moans, and also the way he began whispering “Malfoy,” just like the last time he had come - and wasn’t
“You’re not seeing anyone?” Draco’s mouth asked, betraying him. “No – er – girlfriend?”
Harry pulls off his cloak, just as Malfoy undoes his disillusionment charm.
“Maybe not,” Harry admitted. Draco’s method was effective, and somewhat endearing to watch. And now Harry was getting all sappy about it. Great.
Malfoy’s eyebrows shoot up. “Am I
Draco cleared his throat. “Brilliant disguise, Potter,” he said sarcastically. “How could anyone notice the glasses or the scar when you’re wearing a green tie?”
Harry’s grateful the invisibility cloak is hiding his red face. “No, not that part. Or at least, not the you being in pain part. I didn’t mean–”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I know.” Draco opened the box, revealing the small band Harry already knew well. “Read the inscription.”
Harry yanked the bed curtains back open. He was standing over Draco’s bed. “Stop running away from me. I want to help.”
“I don’t care whose bed we do it in,” Draco said, and then started giggling. Actually giggling. It reminded Harry very much of Teddy -  the giggling, not the casual explicit flirting.
hungry.
Draco stares at the spaghetti and meatballs on the plate in front of him. Just looking at it makes him want to vomit. He breathes through his mouth carefully so he doesn’t have to smell it. He entertains the thought of knocking it off the table. Though he supposes Potter would insist on getting him another meal. How many plates could he knock off the table before it became suspicious?
Harry grabs Malfoy and switches their positions, holding him up against the wall once more. “And how long have you been pining after me, Malfoy?”
He pulls Malfoy tighter against himself, unashamedly rutting his own dick against Malfoy for any friction he can get. Somewhere in a distant corner of his mind, he recognises as an Auror he’s crossing a very crucial boundary, but he easily ignores it, stuck in the pleasure of the moment.
Potter looked pointedly at the pile of sweaters on the floor by Draco’s bed.
“What are you wearing?”
“Shall we go down to dinner together?” Harry interrupts, ever the mediator between his friends, and also hoping that they might forget why they -
Harry smiled. This was too easy. “Ah, well we might have an issue then.”
Granger and Weasley had disappeared early in the night. Draco had meant to make an excuse that he needed to study but Potter wouldn’t stop talking and he never found an out. Instead he sat there and listened, mostly quiet, memorising the details of Potter’s face.
Zabini doesn’t return it. He shakes his head. “I don’t know who you are right now.”
“…this
Zabini went first, daring Daphne Greengrass to kiss Parvati Patil. Greengrass rolled her eyes and led Parvati into one of the dormitories off the common room.
Draco realises he’s let another silence stretch on and the longer he waits, the worse it - “Don’t be stupid, Potter. I have wine at my apartment. You don’t need to bring any.”
“Right,” Draco said, after an uncomfortable silence, “I’ll see you on Monday, then.” He stood up to make his undignified exit.
With Malfoy so close, he couldn’t see it, but Harry certainly heard it when Malfoy dropped his towel onto the wet tiles. He breathed in slowly, trying to calm his rapidly increasing heartbeat. Malfoy took a step back and Harry quickly closed his eyes to avoid the site of his arch-enemy’s dick. He had not planned for this.
“Bye, Potter,” Blaise said sweetly. “Draco looks forward to the opportunity to hear your parseltongue once more.”
It was a casual question. Perhaps the threat really had passed.
Harry drops back against his chair dejected, realising he isn't going to get any information from Slughorn either. “Isn’t there anything I can do to help?” He asks, feeling incredibly helpless.
“No, it’s not,” Potter said louder.
“Why are we – “ starts Zabini before Malfoy pushes him up against a wall and kisses him. Or snogs him, really. It’s heavy and fast and Harry is standing there watching it all, frozen. And Malfoy knows it.
Draco’s stomach stretches uncomfortably at the intrusion, and the horrible mush scratches all the way down his throat but he keeps going, ignoring Potter’s voice, ignoring everything but the food in front of him.
“So, he still speaks like a twat then?”
sounded believable.
Potter hadn’t burnt the crust. And he was quite intent on ensuring Draco actually celebrated his birthday. Which, Draco supposed, was a lot easier in the company of Harry Potter. Not that he was planning on admitting it. But it was probably obvious when – midway through Potter’s third rendition of “Happy Birthday” - Draco grabbed Potter’s shirt and yanked him into his arms so he could shut him up with a kiss.
Zabini doesn’t move. He looks down at Harry with narrowed eyes. “Why would Draco be interested in a half-blood Gryffindor like you?”
“What?” Draco sat up. “Hermione told you? But she promised– ”
Harry almost laughs, but the twisting pain in his stomach stops him. “Yeah.”
Harry’s hands went for Draco’s shirt buttons first, lifting the stakes.  Draco hadn’t realised they were heading for his fantasy until that moment. A kiss was one thing but fucking -  as much as Draco fantasised about it, he suddenly felt nervous. He brought his hands up to stop Harry’s.
“Actually, Ron,” Hermione interrupted. “It’s Holly. Mistletoe has white berries.” She turned to Draco. “But that hardly matters, does it? Harry likes you, Draco. It’s obvious. He invited you here as his date, you realise?”
“No of course not, Ronald,” Hermione says, her voice rising. “But I can apply abstract reasoning and I’m – “
Being well graced in polite society, Draco was forced to delay his departure to appease all the Weasleys – somehow, they seemed to be multiplying.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry gives up on craning his neck to look down at Malfoy and also takes a seat on the bed. It’s hard and lumpy, reminding Harry of his bed under the stairs at Privet Drive. In fact this whole room is only marginally larger. He has no idea how a usually pompous snob like Malfoy can bear it.
(See the end of the chapter for
But then, Draco got to experience Potter’s entire
Potter didn’t even glance at it. “Now that you’ve shown me your tactics and the way you fly, I’m pretty confident I can -“
Harry stares up at the tall gates of the Manor. He really shouldn’t be here. He should just head straight to work. But it wasn’t work that kept him up all through the night. He rests a hand on the gate, still unsure if he’s going to enter, when a silver otter lands in front of him. Hermione’s Patronus.
“No, you can’t,” Draco countered, already hating the snotty tone he was developing but pressing on regardless. “You’re getting paid to serve drinks and treat the affluent guests as if they’re more important than they are.”
he. Tomorrow was no consolation. Nothing good ever happened with Potter outside November third. And it seemed like Potter was catching onto that as well - so the empty gesture was pointless. And insulting.
“Er - no.”
“Those glasses are rather adorable, you know.”
“I didn’t say you were,” Potter said but his voice conveyed the opposite.
“No, I’m not,” Harry said shaking his head, lips widening into a slow smile as he worked something out. “I think– I think it’s you.”
Potter laughed at him - which probably wasn’t the best sign. “I don’t like you either, Malfoy.”
Draco shuffled up higher on the bed while Potter watched him, still standing by the side. Potter’s eyes were dark and lidded - it made Draco feel dirty just to be looked at like that. Feeling a bit brazen under that very look, Draco let his legs fall open to give Potter the best possible view of his cock. He hoped it might encourage Potter to get a move on and join Draco in bed.
Malfoy realised his mistake too late. “Wait, I thought– ”
Draco took another sip of his coffee, hoping his stalling tactic wasn’t too obvious. He made sure he had the correct information before repeating the definition from memory. “It’s a popular muggle tool for communication via direct voice interaction and modern messaging features.”
“Why have you been ignoring me?” He blurted out.
“It’s 11.30pm,” Potter said shamelessly, as if that was all the excuse he needed. "I’m in bed.”
box. How could he not look inside? Okay yes, the ring box had been at the bottom of Draco’s sock drawer, but he’d only opened the drawer because he couldn’t find the pair to one of his socks and thought perhaps it had been mixed up with Draco’s. It hadn’t. And Harry had long forgotten about matching socks.
“My address?” Harry repeats. “Oh! My address!”
Draco’s eyes widen. “But you’re covered in blood and grime.”
Malfoy shakes his head but Harry swears he sees a small smile hidden on his face. “I meant being seen with you.”
Harry makes eye contact with Slughorn as he answers, watching the Professor’s face carefully. “Malfoy.”
Coming to for the second time is much more pleasant. In place of a hard floor is something soft and familiar. His mattress. Which means Potter must have carried him up the stairs. Before he can get too upset about missing that, he remembers his vision. He opens his eyes in a panic. It’s blurry but it’s there. Colours and shapes…and movement. Potter’s pacing at the end of Draco’s bed, phone in hand.
Harry looked up to find that same face at his doorway, focusing a steely gaze on Harry. He was so shocked he forgot he was holding a cup of tea. It dropped to his desk with an embarrassing clatter, spilling its contents, all over Malfoy’s inked face.
“Wait,” Ron interrupts, “You think he’s floo-ing in and out of the castle?”
With his coat carefully hung in the entrance foyer – large enough in itself to be a studio apartment – Harry is lead through the halls of Malfoy Manor. A double tap on his shoulder lets him know Hermione is taking her leave to cast spells around the house. She’ll give the same signal when she’s finished.
Fuck. He sucks in a breath and tries to concentrate, reading the textbook carefully now, before adding the Flobberworm mucus to his cauldron. He starts on the spleen, looking over to find Draco watching his actions cautiously. There’s a comfort in having Draco’s eyes monitoring him. He clears his throat.
His anger had faded, almost as soon as Potter had started laughing, but now Draco’s face was red for another reason entirely. He needed to stop looking at Potter immediately. But he couldn’t.
Potter made a noise - something between a snort and a whimper - before composing himself. “What a great idea, Malfoy. Thanks for the suggestion.”
Harry’s hand dropped and Draco wasted no time in closing the curtains. His had no choice but to release his glamour, the strain too much on him, even before he’d casted any privacy spells. There were tears spilling out of his eyes. An involuntary sob escaped his throat.
FUCKING MOTHER OF MERLIN’S BABY,” Malfoy yells, swaying forward slightly – Harry holds his shoulder firmly. “Please tell me that’s it.”
“Is that my jers–”
Blaise.” He slumped back in his seat. “At least I hope not,” he muttered under his breath but Harry still caught it.
“Can I start you off with an entree, sir?”
making it easy. Surely, he didn’t have to sit
The room comes into focus just in time for Harry to follow the ripples of a small splash inside his cauldron. The steam fades away immediately, the potion lightening to a pale yellow colour. It’s not quite the light cream it should be but it’s great deal closer than purple. He looks to his side to see Malfoy’s concerned face right beside him. “You forgot the Hellebore, that’s all,” he says gently. The hand leaves his arm and Malfoy walks away before he can respond.
Harry shook his head. “No, you don’t know. That not why. Not with you.”
Draco nods, and at last his usual demeanour returns in the form of a smirk. “It seems I have no choice in the matter. You have far too many friends and fans to run from. Not to mention, I’m not particularly fond of bat bogey hexes.”
Malfoy sighed, his irritation clear even before he spoke. “Can you
“Yes, and he–”
He stares and stares, watching as grey clouds pass into the light only to disappear into darkness once more. Sleep is far away for him, even as Ron snores peacefully across the dormroom. Lately, Harry spends more time on this windowsill than his own bed, resting his head against the cool glass to stifle the fire beneath his skin.
Draco rubbed at his eyes and took in a shuddering breath. He uncurled his fists and gestured with the scrunched up letter. “Is this funny to you?” He asked.
Harry felt himself unconsciously leaning into Draco over the table. He stopped himself before he went too far. Draco’s words made him curious. “Debased things?” He repeated. “Like what?”
“Fine,” Draco interrupted loudly, hoping the soundproof charms on all the rooms at St Mungo’s really did hold up. “Since you’re so desperate for it, I’ll suck your stupid dick,” he said, hoping to convey the right level of indifference.
Harry couldn’t think. His mind was a jigsaw and he only ever had access to one puzzle piece at a time. Right now, he just wanted to feel the electricity again. He dropped to his knees and pulled at Draco’s trousers.
, Potter.”
“Get stuffed, Potter,” Draco responded without even looking around. “I’m not in the mood to deal with you.” Although he knew that wouldn’t be the end of it. He’d been trashing Potter’s favourite teacher’s house - it was all too likely the encounter would end in a one-handed duel. For the first time, he regretted insisting Madam Pomfrey put his arm in a sling.
Draco faltered, sitting back on his heels. “Nothing,” he said. “You’re right. It doesn’t matter anyway.”
Happy reading! :)
Harry follows her obediently from the classroom. She leads him to a small alcove on the far side of the corridor. With each step, the pain builds in Harry’s gut until it’s searing high in his chest.
Draco Malfoy
“I know.”
“Right.
“But that’s not how hypothesises work!” She insists.
Travers’ eyes light up instantly but his eyebrows drop in suspicion. “Why?”
He hesitates at the gates. He hasn’t notified Hermione for a reason. Right now, she’d be telling him to stop. She’d be reminding him of the Manor’s alert wards. Reminding him of Malfoy’s right to privacy. But there might not be another opportunity like this. All Harry has to do is get a glimpse of the visitor and ID him. It’s simple.
Harry isn’t new to jealously. He felt it when Ginny was with Dean Thomas. But this feeling is much worse. Because now that jealously is coupled with unbearable hopelessness. Harry knows that somewhere within that touch exterior, somehow, Malfoy cares for him. Draco told him so himself. True, it was under the influence of a potion, but it was real. It had to be real.
Harry nodded. “For now.”
Harry hesitates for a moment. He wasn’t expecting Malfoy to greet him at the door. He was expecting a house-elf. Hermione, invisible beneath the invisibility cloak nudges him pointedly.
“Hey!”
me to give you a blowjob.”
Harry was definitely blushing now. He needed to regain some of his dignity. “What makes you think you’d ever have a chance at getting me in
the Malfoys!”
Fuck. “They’re long,” Harry said because it was the only explanation he could think of. Inside, he was screaming at himself for opening his mouth at all. He felt his face heating up. Why had he said that?
Malfoy’s head snapped up, looking past Hermione to Ron. Harry’s stomach felt tight.
Potter was
Draco felt his hands fall down to his sides as Potter walked off. There were other couples on the dance floor now, but it was only Draco who stood alone. He watched a couple waltz past him, giggling as they bumped knees. The sound pulled him out of his frozen stance. He followed Potter through the crowd, which had grown now, striding quickly so he could catch up. He watched as Potter ducked into an alcove off the main room.
“You’re staring,” Ron repeated. “It’s not subtle.”
“It got you thinking though, didn’t it?” Pansy said unashamedly with a suggestive wiggle of her eyebrows.
Malfoy shrugged. He disappeared down a spiral staircase by what looked to be a floor to ceiling aquarium, but Harry suspected was the middle of the Great Lake. Harry followed to find Malfoy bending over a trunk. His hair had fallen forward revealing the pale skin at the back of his neck and the pink edges around his ears.
Malfoy’s posture stiffens, his hands pause over Harry’s cauldron. “That’s not – “
“Malfoy invited me – he doesn’t want us to raid the Dunbergs' house.”
Harry sighs. “There you are. Don’t run off, okay. I want to help you.”
Draco found himself almost constantly thinking of ways to outsmart, and outmanoeuvre Potter, the golden child. Everyone loved Potter. Worshipped him, even. It wasn’t fair. Was Draco the only one who could see there wasn’t anything special about Potter apart from the scar on his head? And that had been the Dark Lord’s doing.
At first when Harry strides out of Draco’s dorm, careful not to look back and find himself slipping, he is merely trying to get as far away from him as he can. He doesn’t think he’ll be able to clear his head until he’s on the other side of the Great Lake. And even that wouldn’t be enough distance from Draco Malfoy.
“Then
Pansy shrugged. “I don’t know. Maybe because a triple bond sounds like a threesome or something. So who are we talking about anyway?” She asked in an attempted casual manner that was anything but. “Potter?”
“I don’t believe you.”
Draco stops, suddenly realising his pace has quickened significantly so that he is almost running. He has no idea what direction he’s going in but he has a sinking thought it’s a path that will almost certainly lead him to a hospital. He turns around and walks in the other direction, ignoring the pull from his legs to do the opposite. He might be too late. He has to find a safe place to apparate
The first November third after Draco Malfoy met Harry Potter was, of course, unexpected. The date had no significance yet. But by this time, within a few short months of meeting each other, Harry Potter had already become Draco Malfoy’s arch rival.
Did Draco mention how brilliant this plan was? Careful to make as little noise as possible, Draco set his own phone on speaker as well, settling into his bed, ready to mimic Potter’s actions. Maybe this year, they’d actually both get off.
Harry drops onto the couch with a polite smile but as soon as Verity leaves, he stands up again and begins pacing the room.
1. Your ass (obviously)
Harry knocks again, louder. “You’re going to miss breakfast,” he yells into the door. “You should know at the Gryffindor table we always make the last person there chug a bottle of Veritaserum and spill–”
His shirt discarded, and having already slipped off his shoes, Harry’s hands had progressed to the buttons of his trousers, moving slower now. His hands paused and he looked up at Draco. “Is this okay?”
Potter tilted his head, staring at Draco intently with puckered eyebrows, confusion clear on his face.
A cheer erupted throughout the crowd, pulling Harry back to his senses. He looked around and was disappointed but not surprised to find Slytherin had scored another goal. Another 20 points to Slytherin and it’d be a tie if Harry caught the snitch. He was wasting time. Without glancing back at Malfoy – worried he might become distracted again – he dropped his broom and flew closer to the field. Where was that snitch?
“So why do we – why do I – “
Lucius Malfoy fixes his broken cane on Ron’s shoulder and shoves him away.
So, you can imagine Harry’s surprise when he has a very graphic – there’s only one way to put it although he tries to resist categorizing it in that way – sex dream. Well not sex, per se, but sexual. And graphic, did he mention graphic? And surprisingly realistic. So much so that during he thought perhaps it might be real, but then, of course, that would be impossible.
Harry dropped his hand. “Sorry.” He placed his hands under his thighs to keep himself from fidgeting further.
“Clearly not, otherwise I wouldn’t have married Ginny,” Harry bites back. Ginny. Holyhead Harpies Team Captain. World Renowned Quidditch Player. Earns more than Harry’s fortune in a single year. More raw magical power in her pinky finger than most wizards have in their entire body. Obedient house-elf? Not so much. If she were here, she would have decked Draco for suggesting it.
Narcissa turns her head to Slughorn, her face impassive, calm. “When have you ever cared about your duty, Horace? After all the trouble you’ve gone to, keeping this hush hush to protect Mr. Potter – yes, I know it was not out of any regard for my son – you’re really going to expose it all, simply because I am willing to do what is necessary?”
uptight than I thought,” Malfoy added.
“You're being ridiculous,” Draco insisted. “Why would – “ Draco spotted Potter flying back up to the stand and his voice faltered. The snitch was nowhere to be seen.
“We don’t even have anything due today,” she commented, passing over the apple. “Why are you pretending to be sick?”
“Do we have to do this now?” Draco asks, his tone irritated. Which is new. At least for this Draco. “I can’t think straight around him.”
Harry tries to ignore the last part, as much as it sets him aflame. He can’t think about Malfoy’s body right now. He can’t lose control. “I don’t want it to be forced.”
“Honey, I’m home,” Harry called out softly, his voice teasing - Draco didn’t like to play domestic.
“Harry,” Draco says. “All I’ve wanted all these years is to find a way to be with you. You must know that I love you more than anything. But after everything my family’s done, after everything
Harry laughs, giddy with relief. Somehow, he’s equally more exhausted and more energised than he’s ever been before. “I think they want us to…” He trails off, gesturing to the empty room. He gets the sense Ron has been waiting to try out his wingman skills for some time now.
that might interest Potter. As well as the easy ones like Orion and the Ursas.
It sounded weird asking. But he couldn’t just surprise Potter with it, and besides, he thought perhaps Potter would be into it and it would be so much hotter if he wanted it too.
Harry nods, ignoring how it causes the pain in the back of his head to sear. “He’s–”
Potter came, with a high pitched moan Draco recognised well because it featured in most of his dreams. Draco arched himself closer as Potter came on him, the feeling of come on his cock, electrifying Draco. It felt so dirty but fuck it was arousing.
Somebody gasped. Draco saw his own mouth move in time but it couldn’t have been him. He couldn’t make any sound at all right now. Potter loved him, Harry Potter loved Draco Malfoy. Nothing made sense.
As Draco expected, Harry didn’t believe him. “I don’t think it’s appropriate for you to make assumptions about - “
Harry holds Malfoy’s wand behind his back. “Not until you tell me what you’re doing here.”
Over Draco’s shoulder he catches a glimpse of the other Draco Malfoy, frantically straining against the rope from Hermione’s spell.
“No dear, he’s leaving with Percy today. They’re waiting on someone, a new Minister I believe– is this a new look then? Please tell me you didn’t use a potion. The charm never truly fades, you know.”
Draco hummed for a moment – a pretty sound Harry also hadn’t heard before – and then said: “All kinds of things. Simple things, like eyelashes, but other things too. Fears and anxieties you’re used to keeping hidden. Debased things you usually only think of in the dark. Desires you convince yourself you don’t feel but you know you do.” He shrugged as if to take away from the seriousness of what he was saying. “If the Veritaserum allows you say it aloud, then it’s something you already know.”
Finally able to breathe, Harry focuses on Transfiguration and forgets about Malfoy. He takes his notes as usual, sneaking glances at Hermione’s every so often, and chatting with Ron whenever they can get away with it.
“Don’t call her that,” Harry muttered, to his table, not wanting Malfoy to see his face.
Harry wasn’t brave enough to say it, but it’s all he could think of. His mind had been wiped clean of every possible dare under Malfoy’s gaze.
“They took your Wolfsbane Potion? But do you know who–”
They both broke from the kiss at the clatter of the glasses, which rolled into the corner of the alcove, leaving a sticky trail in their wake. Potter’s laughter brought Draco’s gaze back up, and he saw for the first time, Potter’s freshly kissed lips. Bright red and irresistible. He forgot about the champagne and went straight for those lips.
“It doesn’t matter now, anyway,” Hermione says, putting her notes aside. She looks up. “I could have used you here, you know. The Magic Creatures Department have taken over the raid.”
He was making a beeline for his favourite armchair right by the fire - it was always empty, everyone knew it was his - when he heard it. Laughter.
Harry is nervous. More nervous than he’s ever been going into a dream with Malfoy. Because now he’s quite certain that they’re not dreams at all. After a full day of skipping classes and researching in the library, Harry concludes that he’s sharing a connection with Malfoy, facilitated by Malfoy’s 10-inch wand (no not his dick, his real wand, get your head out the gutter). A wand that seems to hold allegiance to both of them.
? I was cruel and naive and I did terrible things. Helped terrible people.”
“Wait,” Harry called out. “Stay.”
Hermione looks between Ron at her side and Harry across from her, in surprise, as if what she is saying isn’t the most obvious thing in the world. She gives a small shake of her head before explaining.  “Well, I’ve been looking into documented cases of all the other ingredients interacting with asphodel root in various other potions and all of the reactions are either benign or unrelated to Malfoy’s condition, so it has to be the nightshade. It’s the only one unaccounted for.”
“I was going to say cheating,” Draco finally managed, hoping Potter wouldn’t notice his slight wince at the word. “It’s cheating,” he repeated, with a little more conviction.
“Malfoy,” Harry interrupted again. “Sit down,
“Draco, dear,” Narcissa Malfoy says. She’s roped up on the Ravenclaw table but in all the commotion has managed to crawl right to the edge by her son. “The manor hasn’t seen a wedding in years. Do your soon-to-be divorcee mother a favour, would you?”
something, were you?”
Harry’s eyes drifted down again, away from Malfoy’s provocative smirk. He’d never admit if of course, but for once, Draco Malfoy was right. Merlin, he was so right.
Malfoy took a step back, dropping his arms. “No need to be so flustered, Potter,” he interrupted. “I keep all the newspapers with your face on them too.”
Malfoy smiled, his eyes still closed. “Say that again.”
Unfortunately, Potter didn’t seem phased. “I’m not begging,” he said simply, leaning back into his chair and spreading his legs the tiniest fraction.
“I wasn’t,” Harry quickly lies. He has no idea why he came to such a wild conclusion. This is
At first, it was only drinking. Harry stood with Ron by the drinks table chatting casually but fully conscious of Malfoy behind Ron’s shoulder, still sitting by the fire. Daphne Greengrass had brought a full bottle of firewhisky over for him and had one shoe resting on the footrest of his stool.
“What?”
Draco looked over to Blaise, alarmed. "What?"
“Or do I need to call Verity for you?” Malfoy still isn’t looking at him.
“I think we’ve overstayed our welcome, Harry.” Draco whispered over the table jokingly. “They’re giving us a sign.”
Now it was Malfoy’s turn to choke. His face went beet red. “That wasn’t meant for you.”
Draco noticed.
“It’s not the wolf I’m worried about.”
“You,” Draco answered quietly, not sure if he wanted Potter to hear him but knowing he had to say it all the same. “You’re what’s special.”
“Malfoy,” Harry corrects himself with a tight jaw. “I know that you might not feel the same about me as when you were split –“
“How do you– that can’t be legal, Potter. I’ll have you–” The charm activates in Harry’s pocket a second time and then a third before the pings are so fast, he loses count. Malfoy’s face changes. “Get your wand out,” he says.
That was it. Draco couldn’t take it any longer. He stood up and swivelled around to face Harry, who, infuriatingly hadn’t even bothered to take his shirt off yet. “Harry, this is hot and all, but can you stop playing and just fuck me?”
“I wouldn’t be so quick to judge,” Draco retorted, thinking on his feet. “I can just imagine you on speakerphone so you can use both your hands to touch yourself, you greedy bastard.”
Malfoy fixed Harry with a warning glare that would have been much more convincing had his cheeks not still been painted red. “
“Harry, m’boy, come in, come in.”
Draco pulled Teddy into a tight hug and looked back over his shoulder at Harry. “You taught a four-year-old the Wronski Feint?”
“Malfoy,” Potter said, his anger obvious in the tightness of his hand in Draco’s, “I’ve had enough of dropping hints and chasing you. I know you want me. I just don’t know why you’re making things so difficult.”
“I know you’re there,” he calls out. “Show yourself.”
Harry hadn’t any experience prior to dating Draco but that didn’t matter now. He didn’t need to know what it was like to suck someone else’s dick. He only needed to know that Draco liked it when he swirled over his tongue over the tip. That Draco liked it when Harry moaned around him. That Draco
. It was a thin gold band that was far less extravagant than Draco’s usual taste, which meant he had picked it out especially for Harry. It was simple but with a slight imperfect curve to the band that Harry took a liking to immediately. It was perfect.
"No wonder you didn't want me to come," Blaise said from beside Draco, breaking him from his trance.
Malfoy and Zabini leave lunch early for afternoon classes, and Harry is standing up and following them before his brain catches up to what his body is doing.
“Is this clear?” Harry asked. He closed his eyes, tilted his head forward and–
Malfoy catches it with an effortless suspension charm and raises an eyebrow pointedly.
“I’ve seen something similar before,” he continued. “A wizard’s anxiety can manifest in bizarre ways.”
me. You can’t just say my name like that after everything that’s happened.”
About today. I didn’t expect to see you in muggle London. Please don’t take my actions as indicative of my feelings. I was just surprised.
Leaving turned out to be a lot more difficult than he’d anticipated. Everywhere he turned, there was another Weasley in front of him and they’d all remembered his name.
“You don’t have to.”
Harry wanted to close his eyes and crawl up into a ball in the corner of the room. He never wanted to look Malfoy in the eye again. In less than a minute, he had made himself look like a complete fool. And all it took was for Malfoy to walk in the bloody room.
“It’s okay, really. It’s not like I - “
“Are you trying to make
He’s been on their watch-list for some time but only ever as a precaution. The baby Death Eater, everyone calls him. Except for Harry. He can only ever be Malfoy in Harry’s head.
Harry blinked back at Draco in surprise. It was not what he’d been expecting. Not after months of silence. And now Draco was looking at him, waiting for a response, and Harry didn’t know what to say.
Narcissa pulls back to look at Draco, and yes, she’s crying, and now Draco might start crying too, fucking hell. “Don’t you think on it,” she says in a choked up voice. “You’re here now and you’re ready. I’m so proud of you, dear.”
“I bet you are,” Draco said without thinking. Potter was one horny fucking bastard. Not that Draco was complaining.
When Harry lifted his head, Draco saw the same purple flowers growing from the Dark Mark, expanding so much they almost covered it completely, choking out the dark energy and replacing it with light. Unbidden tears welled up in Draco’s eyes.
Although, he
There’s a small pause before Malfoy responds. “Fine. But you better hurry up.”
Draco shivered. Harry hardly ever called him that anymore. He stuck out his chin. “We both know you want it too,
Before Mrs Dunberg can answer, there is a loud bang from further in the house. Mrs Dunberg doesn’t react.
“Get your fucking wand out
“Oh yes,” Malfoy interrupts, “you got me! I find life isn’t worth living unless I’ve committed at least two crimes before breakfast.”
The room felt smaller despite the tall heritage ceilings and the air stuffier despite the cool breeze passing through from the nearby window. Draco pulled at his collar – a nervous habit – and took an undignified gulp of his champagne, hoping the bubbles would hit him faster than they usually did. The night had only just begun, and he wasn’t so keen on talking with his ex sober.
And there it was. Potter’s tongue in his mouth. Potter tasted like a Champagne Mojito and Draco was getting wildly drunk off it. He felt light-headed, but he wanted more. Always more. There was never enough time with Potter. And now that he knew what
Malfoy snaps his head to Hermione. “Mrs Dunberg would have been
“As much I enjoy wasting my time with you, let’s get straight to it. You want to know if I know any werewolves.”
Draco wasn’t so certain how he felt about November third anymore. He’d come to terms with his unconventional feelings for Potter, or at least as well as anyone could, in the middle of a brewing war, when you liked the opposing side’s saviour. But that didn’t mean he could act on them. What it really meant was that every small bit of hope he held onto to left him even more thoroughly fucked.
scary looking.” The man raised his arms and flexed in mock imitation of a bodybuilder. “I’ll take buff though.”
“No, you’re– “
“Of course not, Blaise.”
Malfoy looks up and finally holds Harry’s gaze. “It will be soon. For now, you’ll need to trust me.”
He stares back at Harry with lidded eyes. “Don’t talk. Just touch me, please.”
Malfoy sighs and his expression softens. “I know it’s impossible, but I’m begging you, trust me, just this once.”
“Truth.”
has to investigate,” Harry points out. “Better me than someone who hates you.”
He does.
“Tell the truth,” Harry demanded. Did he imagine the spark of desire in Malfoy’s eyes at the order?
“I want to.”
All his senses are honed into Malfoy, sitting two rows ahead of him. And look, it’s not like Harry hasn’t thought about it before, but not like this. Not so strongly that he can’t think of anything else. Not so wildly that he wouldn’t be opposed to doing it in the middle of the class, students and teacher be damned.
The restaurant was a dead giveaway, even if Harry hadn’t seen the box. It required reservations months in advance - which Draco had made (!) - and cost more than Harry’s monthly Head Auror paycheck. It was far from a regular Saturday night dinner affair.
To keep himself from losing his mind in ever-worsening speculation, Harry heads over to the Slytherin table at dinner. Malfoy’s friends see him coming before he even passes the Hufflepuffs. Parkinson raises her eyebrows and nudges Nott. Nott frowns and nudges Zabini. Zabini jerks his head up and openly glares. Harry continues his approach regardless, stopping only to hover awkwardly by the table.
Having already committed to the pointless task, Harry hurried forward and tripped over his own feet, falling right into Malfoy’s waiting – his reflexes were still as fast as they were in Quidditch – arms. Could Harry
Potter blinked back at Draco for a moment, his amused expression finally dropping. His eyes circled the room quickly and then returned to Draco. “You don’t think you’re that important?” he asked softly.
footpath?” Harry repeated. Surely he didn’t mean…
Hermione eyes the case file slammed on her desk. “You
Draco scanned the sky, searching for the constellation he had seen so many times before. “Not usually.”
Harry takes a shallow breath – his chest is too constricted to allow anything more. “I know who you are.”
Malfoy visibly gulped. “My pottery teacher’s name is Harry?” he said weakly.
“Are you
He hadn’t seen Draco just yet, thank Merlin. Draco was a mess. He hadn’t even showered this morning! He always showered before leaving the house.
“I didn’t do anything. I just woke up with Malfoy’s hair.”
“He knows,” Ron says immediately.
if Potter recognised him today - Draco didn’t look like himself at all.
!” Madam Pince yelled out after them.
Draco hears the implication in his words. He is being taken to the hospital whether he likes it or not. There’s something strangely relieving in it, knowing the choice isn’t really in his hands. Not when he’s up against Harry Potter. The defeater of the Dark Lord. People bow down to him on the street – no, really some of them do! Narcissa Malfoy, Pansy Parkinson and Harry Potter. Merlin, if they’d teamed up during the war, Voldemort would have been destroyed much earlier.
Harry’s eyes jerked open as he felt a cold pressure hit him square in the mouth. He could taste mint and cucumber and –
“I wish I could take credit,” George said, reaching out to ruffle Harry’s head. “You look hot.”
of glasses of champagne but he still had his head, even if it was a little fuzzy.
“Oh, yeah, me too,” Harry admitted. He’d never gotten very far with Ginny; the impending war had basically cockblocked him.
“That may be true, Miss…”
Ron turned to him. “Harry, it’s fine, you don’t have to– ”
Draco woke up early. Potter would be back today. He had to be. It was November third. It would all be over soon. Potter would make sure of that.
“No,” Draco lied quickly and immediately regretted it. Denial was his go-to strategy for many things but in order for it to work in this instance, he’d have to convince Potter to believe his word over his own eyes, and Draco wasn’t that good of a liar.
Not that Draco thought Potter was in love with him or anything. That would take a miracle. But just for this moment, that’s what Potter was showing him in his eyes, and Draco didn’t care if it was fleeting, he was going to hold onto that look for the rest of his life.
Draco whined in his petulant spoiled way - that Harry found both endearing and incredibly irritating. “This is a
His dormmate was a jock. Great.
Draco considered the question carefully. He wanted what they
As soon as class ends, Harry is pulling the Marauder’s Map from his pocket, determined to find out where Malfoy disappears to. He gestures for Ron to follow him to a small alcove behind a statue so they can spy undisturbed. “ I solemnly swear I am up to no good.”
Kingsley straightens up in his chair. “I’ve already assigned Rupards and Slater. I’m not putting–”
Harry placed his own words easily. But couldn’t quite place their relevance now. “What do you mean?”
Returning from the class’s mad rush to the Potions pantry to stock up on all the ingredients, Harry can see Draco has already progressed a decent amount with his Potion, it’s simmering in his cauldron with a light pinkish hue. Harry sets his ingredients down on their shared desk and reads step one.
“I want my bed back.”
The dinner is going surprisingly well. Draco thinks he might have to rethink his thoughts on the meal altogether. Sitting here with Potter is nice. It’s something he could get used to, he thinks. Something he could grow to look forward to. That is, until the actual dinner arrives.
“Not another word, Malfoy,” Harry interrupts.
Malfoy is squirming in his seat, restlessly fidgeting, and Harry isn’t sure how, but he can tell Malfoy is aroused as well. Can tell the bead of sweat dripping down the back of Malfoy’s red neck is a sign of it. Can tell that Malfoy would certainly be open to a mid-class fucking. Except how can he know that? It must all be wishful thinking, a product of his own arousal.
There was a silence in which Harry could feel Draco staring down at him, eyes boring into him. He didn’t dare look up. “You feel
Before Harry can react, Ron takes hold of Draco’s cloak and yanks him close. “Oi, not so fast,” he says. “Harry just told you he loved you. Aren’t you going to say it back?”
Harry doesn’t see any point in denying it. He holds his glasses away from his face while he rubs his eyes – anything to avoid eye contact. “Yes.”
The Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures aren’t known for being especially cooperative. The werewolf division, in particular, keep to themselves in a small little corner of the fifth floor of the Ministry.
Draco craned his neck to look back at Harry, unsure of what he was hearing. “What do you mean?”
Which is why he allowed himself to take a hold of Potter’s hands where they rested on his thighs, and pull them straight up to his own crotch. If he was going to get sucked off in class, then he wanted to get sucked off in class ASAP. Yes, he was eager. He was so fucking pathetically eager. So eager that he didn’t have the energy to be self-conscious when a chuckle travelled up from beneath his desk at the action.
and Harry Potter’s arms were still tightly wound around him.
Harry knew he shouldn’t, that he was overstepping, but the thought of Draco dating had thrown him and he itched to know more. He hadn’t known Draco to date anyone. Not that he was keeping track. But surely he would have heard.
, knows it’s rude to ask such questions.
I also highly doubt you enjoyed last week’s poem:
Harry looked away – he was starting to feel dizzy with that gaze directed at him. “You’ve been getting chummy with Pansy and Blaise all night.”
“Please what? Would you prefer if we talked about when
Pansy beamed at them both and gave a little twirl, letting the skirt fly up. It really was a nice fit for her once you got past the absurdity of seeing Pansy in something that wasn’t tight and black.
“Here,” he said, holding out the pin. Draco was sure to take it with his good arm. He needn’t have bothered - Potter didn’t look away from his face, a steely expression on his own. Oh merlin - Draco already knew there was something preachy coming. And: “You don’t have to be your father, you know. We don’t choose our family.”
Draco snorted. As if Potter should be the one to get off after the state he had left Draco in last year! “How romantic.”
“Right.” Harry studies the table very closely, every inch of the skin visible on his face and neck a dark red. “Look, Malfoy don’t take this the wrong way because if I’d known it was just dinner, I still would have come, but now that I’ve…well I’m very embarrassed to be honest, so I think I should probably go.” He stands up, eyes still determinedly avoiding Draco.
“I’d suggest being in contact when you drink the antidote,” Slughorn says from behind Narcissa, holding out a small vial. “Less space between you to cause complications.”
. You’ve had your fun.”
“You don’t have to but I like to draw patterns in the coffee sometimes - customers really love it. Like this,” Harry said, crafting a ridged leaf shape into the foam at the top of the cup, and showing it to Draco.
“They’re not cold anymore,” Draco said, smugly.
“Nice form out there, Potter,” Draco called out, running to catch up with Harry. As much as he enjoyed the view walking behind, he had something better planned.
He must find out what’s going on.
“Get on with it, then,” Draco tried to snap, but his voice came out much more breathy than he intended and ending up just sounding desperate. Which he was, of course.
Draco gripped onto the stem of his glass a little tighter. “You see what?”
Madam Pomfrey’s lips twitch. “I was able to take some of your potion from his clothes but it had already dried out. It’ll be difficult to work out the antidote with only that, but not impossible. I’ll have to speak with Horace. You should go back to your dormitory, Mr Potter.”
“If you want to go, say the word and we go,” Ron said, and Harry would’ve known he meant it even without the Veritaserum.
“But if he’s– ” Harry stopped at the panic in Malfoy’s eyes. “If one of us is anxious, then why is the other one affected?”
He pulled himself up, ignoring the heaviness of his head. As soon as he was off the bed, he felt instantly calmer. He could still remember the nightmares but they were no longer pining him down with their weight. No longer crawling under his skin. It was no wonder Malfoy wanted to swap beds.
“How do I even explain? It’s – look, you’re an alpha. The top dog. The lead. The
miss any fireplaces.”
“It is, isn’t it?” Potter didn’t even have the decency to deny it. “I’m not into playing coy like you, Malfoy. I’m not embarrassed that I want you.”
“But Hermione will. I was sure the spell would do it.”
“That’s the potion talking, if – “
Harry shrugs. “I barely noticed.”
“Shhh,” Harry says, “I don’t want to hurt you.”
Harry waits for hours. He knows Ron and Hermione will be worried but this is more important. He has to know. He has to know. He’s glad to have his friends help him, he’s so incredibly grateful, but they can’t understand how Harry feels. This is his fault. He did this to Malfoy. As much as he used to hate the git, he would never have wished to really hurt him.
Travers looks up when Harry enters. “The Minister For Magic called.”
“Oh, you
why you always lose?”
Harry jams the eyeball into a jar and slams the lid shut before it can roll out again. “Are they dangerous?” he asks, eyeing the smashed vials by their shoes.
Harry ran a hand through his new hair, feeling off balance when it continued further down his neck than usual. “I’m not sure what happened. I think it’s some sort of accident. I thought Mr Weasley– ”
Draco’s breathing had picked up and his heartbeat was so fast Harry could see the vein in his neck pulsing. He was mesmerised by the sight of it. Draco’s heartbeat. Draco’s heart. There was something on the tip of his tongue that he still couldn’t quite place.
That at least gets Malfoy’s attention. “He’s not always like that,” he says quietly.
“You really shouldn't–” Verity calls after him but he’s already far into the house. He discovers a library and follows it through to a vast study. Malfoy sits at a desk in the centre, his back to the entrance. Harry’s about to call Malfoy out for ignoring him when he hears Malfoy singing.
“No need, Potter." Malfoy side-steps him and follows the sock into Harry’s bedroom.
“He’s a werewolf, isn’t he?”
Harry couldn’t help but laugh a little at that. Draco’s dramatics could be frustrating but they were always entertaining. “Stop being ridiculous. When are you going to stop playing?”
“How did you find me?” He addresses his question to Ron and Hermione, to save himself from looking at Draco right now.
“How far along were you in the brewing period?”
“Shut up, Potter,” Draco said, placing himself gently on the ground in front of Potter’s chair, thinking the action would do just that - shut him up. It didn’t.
(See the end of the chapter for
is it?” Potter asked, his words clearly articulated with a wide smile leftover from his laughter. "I don’t know how I feel about
Malfoy shrugs. “Nobody important.”
This is a choose your own adventure story. Please don't use the next chapter buttons.
Harry stared back, ignoring the roaring in his ears. “Do you see me laughing?”
Draco blinked back at Harry, drawing attention to his long pale lashes. Harry had a particular fondness for those bloody lashes. “How can you curse yourself and not know? What incantation did you use? What wand movement?”
With no distraction, Harry was hyper aware of Malfoy’s presence beside him, still and quiet, his body as rigid as a board. The silence stretched on. It was past 12 now. Where was Harry’s soulmate?
“Harry,” Pansy said in her sickly sweet voice - nothing good ever came from that. “Why don’t you dare Draco? He hasn’t had a turn yet. I’m sure he feels very left out.”
“And the questions keep coming.”
“I’ve decided she, and you, and Potter I suppose, might be right.”
“You have a lot of feelings?” Potter suggested, a smile on his face, half smug half playful, and completely endearing.
“What?” Potter asked, like he didn’t know. Like he fell through floors all the times. Like it was no big deal.
“Do you know any other way?” Narcissa asks in a tired drawl that reminds Harry of Draco. Before any of this happened. Back when he was still Malfoy. And Harry was still Potter.
me to call you. You
The room turned to Mr Weasley.
Hermione casts a quick spell and a cage surrounds Malfoy. She gives Ron a stern look. “I’ll be fine, Ronald. Just be quick.”
“We don’t need to make out,” Draco said. “I mean
to acknowledge
Ron holds up the Marauder’s Map. “The map, obviously. When Malfoy came to us looking for – “
Harry has to stifle his laughter. Falling in love with Draco Malfoy? He can’t think of anything simpler.
“Miss Granger, but even so, our stores were vandalised this morning, shortly after the news broke.”
Potter’s face lit up with a surprised smile - he obviously hadn’t expected Draco to be so agreeable - neither had Draco. “In that case, make sure you capture me from the left. It’s my good side.”
He would pull up the curtains around his bed, cast as many privacy and warding spells he had the strength to, and then finally let his guard drop, let his real face be revealed, if only to himself. Despite the smooth pale skin everyone else saw during the day, Draco’s face was red and blotchy, covered with acne and large angry scars from the times Draco had tried to curse the spots off.
There’s something off about Malfoy when Harry meets him by his dorm in the morning. Yet, he’s dressed the same as the first day with slicked back hair, grey slacks, a button up shirt and Harry’s tie. Harry runs his eyes back and forth over the uniform, trying to pick out what’s not quite right.
Draco leant back in his chair, keeping his eyes firmly placed on Harry’s face. He did respect his boss after all. “Why do you ask?”
“If you don’t move – “
Draco dropped his head back down to the pillow and closed his eyes, relief flooding through him. Maybe this year he could keep Potter for another day after all.
Draco turned back to her, only to offer his best scowl. It didn’t seem to phase Pansy one bit.
“Out with it, Potter,” Malfoy snaps between whispered incantations. “You’re making me lose my concentration.”
“Malfoy.”
Potter’s confidence was rather disconcerting. It clearly had the power to turn him into a squirming mess as well as a pathetic follower eager to please all at once.
Two women pass through what appears to be solid wall metres away from where Harry and Malfoy stand. One of them pulls out a cigarette immediately and lights it up with a wave of her wand.
And that’s it. He turns back and he’s gone. With a line like that. And what the fuck is that supposed to mean? Surely, he can’t mean...Because if they haven’t been dreams that means he really…but he always wakes up in his own bed so there’s no way…right. He needs to do a Hermione. He needs to head to the library.
Draco jerked his hips up to find Potter’s cock and was not disappointed. When he brought his hips back down, Potter’s followed, pushing into him against the bed and pulling back and - oh Merlin, Potter was basically humping him. And Draco was very much enjoying it. Horizontal things were very good indeed.
Malfoy turns and Harry follows him into the Manor wordlessly. They continue into the sitting room, however Malfoy doesn’t sit this time. He stares into the fireplace as he addresses Harry, hands in his pockets.
“I’m just the highlights of a person,” interrupts Draco. “Not even that. Because when there’s nothing to compare the high to, it’s just a flat line. It’s nothing.” He turns back to face Harry, his lower lip trembling. “Like this,
Harry wasn’t quite sure how to act around Draco anymore. Things had changed between them. Not only did he know that Draco was discussing the thought of having sex with him with Pansy, but he’d also had a taste of their older arguments, and the supercharged feeling that came with them. He wanted more.
“Sorry,” Harry said, releasing Draco’s hands, “there’s just something - “ He paused, unsure how to finish. What something?
Harry walked around his table and stood across from Malfoy’s, looking down at his soulmate who seemed very interested in studying the plush pink carpet at their feet. Harry cleared his throat and Malfoy looked up sharply.
“You won’t,” Malfoy says, his eyes falling to the floor, voice breaking.
“None of them applied,” Potter said with a shrug.
Harry frowns. If Hermione starts asking about asphodel root and other ingredients Pomfrey and Slughorn know he added to the potion, it’s going to be incredibly obvious. “Pomfrey isn’t going to fall for that.”
Harry’s eyes closed of their own accord as he gave into the sensation. What did anything else matter when he felt like this?
Harry isn’t so certain Hermione’s plan is going to work. Slughorn’s not completely stupid. Besides, he’s the only Potions teacher. What extra credit assignment could Hermione be doing on potions ingredients that he isn’t aware of?
At this point, even a green apple, which Harry is right, was once his favourite, isn’t anything that Draco can think positively about. It’s food. It’s repulsive. It’s wrong. But Harry Potter’s light, now there’s something very right about that.
“I still– ” Harry took a deep breath– “loved you.”
do that?”
Dark Mark – flinch under Harry’s gaze.
“Why do you care so much what I think?”
Fuck you, Potter.
Alex’s eyes dart around the room. “I’m not– I don’t have a choice. It’s only for a week.”
Harry was wrong of course.
Harry’s hand clenches around the bed post. “I mean,” he says, his voice huskier than intended, “what is this? Are you interested in me or just…you know?”
“Yeah, actually, it's – “ Blaise’s implication must have hit Potter a second too late. He fumbled over his words. “What are you - Oh I didn't mean - that's not - I mean, you don't need to - um.” Potter closed his mouth firmly, a blush creeping over his cheeks. Draco could see the cogs in Potter’s mind working overtime, trying to find an escape. Draco felt quite the same way. Blaise was worse than dead.
The only saving grace – if there was any positive to the situation at all – was that at least on the floor, behind his desk, he was hidden from sight. He wondered if he crawled under his desk and stayed there, if Malfoy would get the idea and leave. Harry was seriously considering the option when Malfoy came into view again, stepping around the desk to loom over Harry.
“No, it’s not.”
“I’m interested,” Draco said quickly. Harry heard the scraping of the desk chair and then Draco was falling into bed beside him, reaching for the treacle tart packet. He lifted it up and inspected the contents, disappointment clear on his face. “I thought you said you - “
“One minute?”
Harry was pleased to see a tinge of pinkness in Draco’s cheeks. “I was drunk.”
“Oh.” Harry’s did the same as he caught on. ““Well, did you want to…” Harry faltered as he came across the same words Draco couldn’t quite vocalise. "I mean, what do you want to do?”
,” interrupts Malfoy, his tone showing his disgust at the trait. “He doesn’t want to pressure me into anything I wouldn’t normally do.”
wanted to know.
“No, Potter, don’t even try to make this better. Unless you’re going to willingly let me obliviate you, there’s nothing you can–“
Against his better judgment, Draco snuck a look at Potter out of the corner of his eye. His eyes were roaming the sky, exactly as they did the Quidditch pitch, searching for patterns with fresh excitement.
with you.”
“I’m not finished,” Potter said unnecessarily.
“Marley’s mother,” Harry explained for Draco quickly again, wondered where Teddy was going with this.
“I’m not touching my cock!” Draco yelled out defensively, forgetting he was supposed to be pretending he wasn’t listening. Oh, fuck it all anyway. The bastard knew. He
Harry turned around slowly, a smile forming on his face. “If that’s what the doctor orders…”
going to kiss you.”
“You’re
Draco sat up. “You didn’t cast anything?”
Draco cast a tempus charm just before midnight. He didn’t quite know what would happen if he stayed beside Potter all the way into November fourth, but he wasn’t keen to find out. It couldn’t be good. Without the day guiding them, Potter and Draco were only enemies. And enemies didn’t stargaze together.
“Then I don’t see why you’re asking about it,” Potter said, his faux sweetness returning.
“Then please don’t try and diagnose me. I’m
Potter’s smile dropped.
Potter was devouring and releasing Draco’s cock with a steady rhythm now. It felt like he was goading Draco to come, daring him to give in to it. Draco could already feel the beginning of his orgasm spreading its way through him, his entire body tightening in anticipation. And then Draco was gone. Floating far away from the tiny little classroom in a world of absolute bliss. It didn’t make sense that something that seemed so dirty could result in a feeling so pure.
Harry makes a face.
Malfoy tries again. “I won’t deal with invisible clients. You either reveal yourself now or you leave my property.”
Draco scoffed. “Of course not. I’m simply saying if the man doesn’t know the proper stages of courting, it was never going to work.”
“You need to get to the Ministry. Now,” it says in Hermione’s clear authoritative voice before vanishing.
“You want to kiss me?” Malfoy asked, his voice soft and – despite the half-empty firewhisky bottle in his hands – very, very sober.
Harry fucking Potter.
Explaining everything to Hermione and Ron gives Harry much greater comfort than he could have anticipated. Just from sharing the weight of the knowledge with his friends, Harry already knows he might finally get some sleep tonight.
“I didn’t – “
Malfoy jerks his head towards Harry. “With a little help from my friend, wizard Jesus.”
“Harry,” Ron whispered urgently beside him, “I think you –“
“Oh yes, Potter,” Draco said with quirk of his eyebrows, “I really do.”
“Good afternoon, Harry,” Draco said cordially, as Teddy rushed in.
Teddy crossed his arms. "As long as it’s not soup.” He screwed up in his face in distaste. He hated all things mushy.
I’m changing the title of my poem to Potter Sucks. Short. Simple. To the point.
“I wasn’t saying anything,” comes Pansy’s lying voice over the line. In this moment he has no idea why he is friends with such a bastard.
Because, barely a metre from where Draco sat, Harry Potter had just walked in the door.
Malfoy doesn’t flinch. “Spring cleaning?” he comments, moving further through the house.
Draco sighs. He’s wasting his limited energy deflecting but at least he’s going to make Pansy work for it. “It doesn’t matter. I’m not lying. If you – “
When the rushing stops, he’s standing back in D – Malfoy’s dorm, the walls closer than he remembered. And Malfoy is leaning up against the bed post facing him, a very Malfoy like (and completely un-Draco like) smirk on his face. Harry isn’t quite sure how to respond to that. He isn’t used to being alone with
Harry drops his head. “Sorry.” Dread eats into him from every corner of his body. He feels light-headed.
to say yes. His pride be damned. But - he couldn’t move.
Malfoy pulls away, leaning back in his chair once more. He folds his arms. His voice is insincere when he speaks. “My deepest apologies, Auror Potter. How may I assist with your investigation?”
Draco was on his feet and twirling around in an instant, his wand pointed at Harry, the flames faltering sadly behind him. Perhaps surprising Draco when he was armed hadn’t been Harry’s wisest move.
“Just do it, already,” someone heckled.
“What the fuck are you doing?” Malfoy asked, or rather
“You were hurting.”
“Harry Potter, okay?” Draco caves like he knew he would be forced to. “If you really want you can go ask him yourself. I’m not lying.” Although he hopes she doesn’t. He doesn’t want Potter on his case as well.
“No more spells or potions from Harry Potter, thank you very fucking much.”
“You could teach me the spells?” Harry suggests. “The ones Severus taught you?”
But if he’s being honest, it’s a relief to hear Potter’s quiet snores across the room. Draco can’t bear to be alone right now, not when he’s this scared. So so scared. He doesn’t even realise he’s crying until he feels the wetness puddle at his pillow. He’s not ready for this. Any of this.
Malfoy stopped smirking. “I do not. Take that back.”
Harry concedes. As always, Hermione is ten steps ahead, already planning their next move, when Harry’s still stuck in the present. He’s reluctant to leave Mrs Dunberg even for a moment but Hermione’s right. First, they need a plan.
Harry twists back to the front of the classroom. Madam Pomfrey stands beside Professor Slughorn, hands clasped tightly at her chest. Her expression is blank, controlled, but thick wisps of hair hang from her usually pristine bun, and her mascara is noticeably smudged below one eye.
“I’ll send an owl to the Manor and let them know. I’m sure Mrs. Malfoy will be pleased.”
Realising what he’s doing – or not doing as the case may be – Harry quickly pours the dittany bottle, adding a bit more than intended to the top of the wound at Malfoy’s back.
in Slytherin. Which was ridiculous. Potter was such a Gryffindor. A noble, self-righteous little shit. But merlin, he looked so right in green. Maybe it was the eyes. Oh shit, Draco had been caught staring.
The basic idea here is that Harry is losing his shit over some PG-13+ through the underwear stroking, okay fine M rated if you want to be picky about it and spoil the drama. And then – Harry nearly faints at this – Malfoy says and I swear I’m not lying, “Like what you see, Potter?”
“How very scandalous of you, Potter. Perhaps you’ll see me again tonight, then.” And with that he fucking walks away. Just walks away like it’s nothing. But then, and this part will stay with Harry forever. He turns his head back, stares right in Harry’s eyes (reminiscent of the first time Harry watched Malfoy get off, jesus fuck) and says: “Although, did you ever wonder if they’re really dreams at all?”
“Oh. I’m Draco,” he said, his voice taking on an endearing squeaky quality. He finally took Harry’s hand in a firm shake. “Your soulmate.”
. And -
Harry followed Teddy’s eyes to the tall cupboard opposite the bed. It was a needlessly grand thing with embellished edges and a gold rim, that Harry supposed could actually be real, considering the house - no, manor - he was in. More importantly though, it was still.
Malfoy pauses for a moment, staring at Harry, as if he can’t understand the question. He looks back into the fire. “A lot of things,” he says darkly, “but I thought you, of all people, might understand. I thought you knew that the law isn’t always right. That breaking the rules can sometimes be the right thing.”
Harry’s chest clenches and he whips his head around. “
“Harry just told you he loved you and you did
Harry couldn’t stand watching any longer. He walked into the room. “Silence!” He said loudly over the racket.
This time, it’s Malfoy who seeks out Harry, finding him lying by the Great Lake. Harry wonders if Malfoy is aware this is where they watched the sunrise together, only days ago. Harry tries not to read into anything when Malfoy lies down beside him on the wet, muddy grass, without a single complaint.
“You know Malfoy’s going to tell you no, right?”
So, Harry has no choice but to follow Malfoy out into the Entrance Hall and confront him. “How do you know?”
And sure enough watching Malfoy come is just, how does Harry describe this? He’s not exactly an erotic writer, so when he sees it (by it, let me explain on behalf of Harry, he means Malfoy finishing all over his own hand with another moan of “Potter”), all he can think is that it’s beautiful. No really, he’s that much of a fucking sap, he just thinks it’s beautiful. Like what people call bloody sunsets. I mean, sure Harry, sure.
Harry shivered and Draco knew he had won. “Fine, but I’m going to appoint a supervisor to monitor your work so that you no longer report directly to me. And if you ever feel like I’m treating you - “
The change was instant. One second, Harry was staring up at Draco Malfoy with black hair, the next, it was back to his trademark slicked-back platinum. Harry brought a hand up to his own hair to check.
Malfoy looked up. “You tell me.”
He moves to check on Malfoy but in his hesitation, he has underestimated his dueling partner. In less than a few seconds, his wand lurches out of his hand, and he is forced to the ground, red ropes of smoke twisting around his body and holding him in place. He has lost.
“Yes,” Potter said. He stood tall, his voice confident but Draco finally noticed the light blush on the edges of his face. “What do you think?”
“Your
Nobody had seen how bad Draco’s acne had gotten, not even Pansy. He’d researched magical cures on his own in the library, but nothing ever seemed to work. Once he found a spell that cleared his skin immediately and he spent a whole day without a glamour. But that night, the acne had returned with a vengeance, and even worse, it had also creeped down onto his neck as well. He never tried the spell again.
“Oh no, are they?” Harry asked, feigning innocence, and reaching for Draco again.
Did Draco bother denying it? “Maybe.”
Harry knows he doesn’t have any real argument to still have the charm. If he’s being honest, his interest in keeping it is far from professional. “Finite Incantatem” he whispers.
He’d set up his canvas quite a distance from the pitch so that the players wouldn’t see him.  Of course, that also meant he couldn’t see them that well either so, as always, he’d brought his binoculars to get the best view of his intended subject - it was a bit of a hassle using them and painting at the same time but it was better than the alternative - being caught.
“Just over two hours,” Malfoy answered immediately.
Harry twists around pulling out his wand. “Expelliarmus,” he shouts automatically. He sticks a hand out of the invisibility cloak to catch the wand that flies through the air, becoming visible as it leaves its owner’s hand.
“Guess what, Potter?” Malfoy said, pulling Harry’s attention back up. “You can have me.”
“Where is he?”
dinner,” Draco clarifies. He can’t believe he is having this conversation. In what world would he be asking Harry Potter out on a date? In what world would Harry Potter say yes?
If it really were a movie, he would reach a hand out and stroke Draco’s face, or place a stray hair behind his ear. But Draco didn’t like to be touched in his sleep. Didn’t like to be caught unaware. After what he’d been through, Harry could understand that. He had similar fears. Although he was quite amenable to waking up to Draco’s touch. Not that he did much. Draco slept in late these days.
Just what is up with Draco Malfoy?
“No.”
“I was trying to get away from these Durmstrang girls and they cornered me and I was just thinking I wish I could disappear and then I fell through the floor. Your - er - ceiling I guess.”
is being alive.
“But you don’t
All at once the realisation hits – the voice must belong to the figure on the lake. They’ve returned. It takes all Harry’s willpower to stop the wolf from bounding through the walls of the Shrieking Shack, sprinting through the underground tunnel and joining them on the Black Lake. Harry’s never had so much trouble with his control before. He’ll have to get Hermione to up his dose of Wolfsbane. For now, he forces the wolf to settle and lets the voice wash over them both. It’s going to be a long night.
“It’s still Malfoy.”
Draco resisted the urge to hex Pansy. “Not
Harry felt himself imitating the smile on his own face. He settled his head down on Draco’s chest, wrapping his arms around his husband. How wonderful it felt to finally be warm again.
“No,” Harry lied just before the Veritaserum hit his tongue.
“Potter.”
“You don’t need to apologise. Everything that has happened was because of me. Because of who I am.”
Harry ignores the jab. He took this case to help Malfoy for Merlin’s sake. He won’t be made to feel guilty for that. “Take off your shirt, Malfoy.”
Right. Fuck. Harry has been seriously underestimating Malfoy. And he’s just starting to realise how much danger he’s actually in. He scans the shelves beside him for something,
Draco keeps walking on. And just when Harry thinks it might be far enough, Draco takes another turn and continues. He leads them through a hidden passageway that takes them out into the Castle grounds. The early morning brings with it a chilling wind, but it seems only Harry notices. It’s not until they reach the outskirts of the Great Lake that Draco finally stops and turns to face Harry.
Malfoy raises his wand, casting a silent spell across the lawn. It becomes obvious what it is when the grass at Harry’s feet, and only Harry’s feet, flutters tellingly – a tracking spell. Harry looks back up to see Malfoy making a beeline for him.
“Love.”
“Harry, you little devil.”
“Is that why you like me?” Harry interrupted, grinning up at Malfoy. “You think I’m noble?”
“Never.”
3. No, that’s pretty much it.
Draco turned around then, his face showing no surprise at Harry Potter sitting in his Healer’s office. “You accidentally cursed yourself,” he repeated drily.
Draco walked out before he could give into temptation to change his mind and look. But when Potter called out after him, with a bitter “Bye, then, Malfoy,” his disappointment was clear anyway. Draco felt the same, of course, but it was useless. Not with what he had already planned for this year. He didn’t bother to respond.
That got Potter’s attention – he sat up immediately. “What?”
He looked back up to Malfoy, searching for any sign he might have seen. Nothing. But that hardly meant much. Harry suspected Malfoy’s emotions didn’t play so obviously on his face anymore. He nodded in what he hoped was a professional courteous manner. "Dralfoy."
An omega? Harry knocks Malfoy’s arm away. “I don’t know what I fucking am.”
Harry couldn’t tell if it was a genuine question or a jibe. He wished Draco would give him some clue. “It’s not that I’m lying,” he answered carefully. “It’s just that I’m not always telling the full truth.”
“What now?” Draco asks after a silence.
Back in his apartment with Teddy, he asked as casually as he could over their traditional late Friday night bowl of cereal: “What else did Draco tell you about his date?”
“No, actually,” Draco said with a sneer. “How about overbearing? Stubborn? Deluded?”
“What do you think you’ll order?” Potter repeats politely.
hickey.”
Draco looked back down at his chest. Small violet flowers grew out from the scars on his stomach, like bright muggle tattoos. Except they were moving, still growing, and expanding upwards, with tall intertwined green stems and vivid leaves.
Harry breathes out. “Distracting you from the pain,” he explains as he applies more pressure, clumsily massaging Malfoy’s shoulder with his left hand.
And whether it was fated or a coincidence, come the first November third, Draco Malfoy and Harry Potter met without those jeering crowds, in a quiet corridor, completely alone.
It was too late. The room of eighth years were already making the obvious connection.
“Did I snore?”
Draco laughed - not even bothering to hide it. Stuff pretences. It was November third. “That’s Scorpius.”
“Where were you last night?” Malfoy asks at the Breakfast table.
As Harry approached, Draco’s eyes darted up and he sobbed a little harder. “Who told you?” he whispered.
“Now you’ve done it,” Harry warned.
“You enjoyed it,” Potter retorted, and Draco could just
Harry nods to himself. So, nightshade and asphodel root. That’s what did this to Malfoy. It’s something but - “We still don’t know what the reaction would be.”
. Hermione’s voice stops him. “Harry, your wand.”
Malfoy looks like he’s about to do just that so Harry tugs at his arm. “I got this,” he says through gritted teeth. Turning back to Travers, he plants a diplomatic smile on his face. “I’m going to offer you the biggest werewolf raid of your career.”
“Take a seat,” Kingsley says. When Harry no longer stands over him and they are at eye level, he continues.  “We don’t know anything yet. We’ve received a tip-off that Mr. Malfoy is conspiring with werewolves to launch a coordinated attack on the Ministry of Magic. I’ve–”
“I resent the implication that I am not always smooth.”
Pansy gasped. “You know, I think that you might have a threefold twin bond."
“I love you.”
“Where is he?”
“Neither do I,” Malfoy replies, his smile gone. “Blaise, I think it’s best if you leave.”
Harry supposes Malfoy has a point. Perhaps he doesn’t know this Malfoy well enough to truly be in love with him yet. But that doesn’t mean he doesn’t want to. That doesn’t mean they should give up before they’ve even begun. He stares at Malfoy intently, and waits until Malfoy finally returns his gaze before speaking.
“You are – “
“Fair and square my arse,” Harry interrupted, finally getting his rhythm back. “You cheated.”
Potter handed over the form they made all non-serious patients fill out at reception and Draco skimmed over it quickly. “You haven’t ticked any symptoms,” he observed.
Draco darted backwards, quickly jumping behind the couch to keep his distance from Harry. “Can’t we just have a mature, romantic,
Ah, that’s the sting, isn’t it? He doesn’t hate Malfoy anymore. How could anyone hate this Malfoy? But is it really even Malfoy? Even the Marauder’s Map doesn’t know for sure. Fuck. What has Harry done?
. As if that covered everything.
Potter ran a hand through his messy hair - as Draco had seen him do a million times before. Usually right before eating. And right after flying. And in the middle of class when - well, it didn’t particular matter. Draco had just seen it before is all.
“When I tell you, you’ll know it, Potter.”
“I got us out of a family dinner tomorrow night.”
Draco snapped out of his stare. Oh fuck, he hoped Potter hadn’t noticed. “What?”
“You’re wearing my sweater,” Draco chided, his breath warming Harry’s ear.
So, when Draco arrives in St Mungo’s apparition ward, it’s hand in hand with his mother, and he’s clinging on tight, terrified to let go.
“I should probably head off now,” Harry said awkwardly. “Happy birthday, Draco,” He added as an afterthought.
He looked back up at Harry whose eyes were fixed on his erection, it would’ve hardened under that gaze if it wasn’t already as stiff as a board. Why wasn’t Harry fucking him already?
“Malfoy,” Potter said, clearly not having thrown away the key to his lips at all. “Are you making me wait on purpose?”
“You don’t - “
“Wait,” Potter called out, louder than required.
“Stay out of this, father,” Draco says, avoiding Lucius’s grip. “Wherever I’m going, it’s not with you.”
So that leaves Harry to start. “I want to talk about…
“Harry, dear,” she said, looking up, “would you like some– ” her voice turned squeaky as she took in his appearance– “breakfast?”
Thanks to
There was only one thing for it. He leant forward to capture Draco’s lips with his own. Harry had enjoyed sparring with Draco - a momentary reprieve to the numbness of their wasted encounters, but this, this was more than just a reprieve, it was an explosion of feeling, the opposite of numbness. This was the real thrill Harry had been searching for. And from Draco’s enthusiasm, it was clear he felt the same.
“You don’t know what you’re saying, Alex,” she says after a quick drag. “Where else are you going to go? Back to your folks?”
“I didn’t mean your exact address, merlin. You’re really not going to tell me just because I may have been a
He ended up levitating Draco up the stairs - “Why don’t you just tie me up while you’re at it, Potter?” - to avoid the all too much contact involved in pushing, pulling and tugging Draco’s tired body around.
Harry frowned, his eyes brows curving inward. “Of course,” he said resolutely.
That question was easier. “He should know what he’s missing out on.”
“Wait?” Harry queries automatically, as he follows Malfoy to the door.
Harry turns around. He didn’t expect this from Travers of all people. “But why do you care?”
There was a pause. When Potter spoke again, his voice had changed.
Harry eyed the silk robe. “
Hermione stacks her papers and packs away her ink and quill. “It’s getting late. He might not even have any visitors tonight. We should–”
“You know why. I’m cancelling that spell.”
“Of course I got them. You asked me to get them. That’s the whole reason I -“ Harry paused, deciding the effort was pointless. Draco only had eyes for the computer screen. “Are you even listening to me?”
“I like the sound of your laugh,” Harry shot back.
Potter’s smile returned - finally. “In my defence, two years is a long time to wait.”
out of this questioning. “Do you know Winona Crump?”
Alex bites her lip and her eyes start to tear up.
“Cock. Your
Draco Malfoys. And he’s still not exactly sure why. All he knows is the one in ropes by his feet tried to kill him. And he really hopes that’s not the real Malfoy.
Potter made a sound that started off as a laugh and evolved into a soft moan. “Remember when you moaned around my cock, Malfoy? That was hot.”
Harry walks away, feeling Malfoy’s eyes still on him. A number of distracting thoughts run through his head but he focuses himself on one. Malfoy is about to floo away.  And Harry is going to miss where.
“What makes you think I’m not in the mood?” Harry asked, surprised. He hadn’t exactly been unreceptive to Draco’s attentions.
“You’re still upset that Slughorn said you couldn’t – “
Draco felt out of place. His platinum blonde hair stood out amongst the sea of red. He had met so many Weasleys in the space of twenty minutes that he couldn’t even remember a single name.
are you enjoying it?”
“Potter,” he said seriously, “I dare you to kiss me.”
?” He jerks up the long black sleeve of his tunic crudely to reveal the Dark Mark. It twitches under Harry’s gaze.
“I’ll admit I’m a little bit tipsy,” Harry said with an apologetic smile - just as delightful as the previous one. “I needed the courage to ask you out. But if we’re going to start dating instead of, you know, just having sex in empty operating rooms, I think I should be able to call you Draco all the time.”
Ronald laughed, but not unkindly. “And where is that?”
Draco would have much preferred to stay in bed all day. Anything to avoid Potter, and regain some sleep. But he was supposed to be good this year. And he really needed perfect grades if he was going to land a job after school. He didn’t have the same extracurricular activities as Potter to include on his resume. What was he going to say?
Malfoy misinterprets this. “I see you about to make another metaphor out of that and I warn you, I will walk away.”
Draco caught a glimpse of his reflection in the glass of the window beside him. How could he have ever left the house like this? Even his eyes looked tired. It would be
. Malfoy’s head has been separated from his body and he’s walking around headless but nobody knows because Madam Pomfrey put an anti-perception spell on it. There? Is that
“It could be,” Malfoy said, his eyes on his firewhiskey as he swished it around in his glass like it were wine.
“I don’t see why you would spend a month undercover in Romania, why you would work weekends, why you would take your paperwork home with you, if you only wanted me to fuck you.”
“I like the way you fly.”
‘That’s the trunk of a broken column.”
Portrait Snape tucks an oily strand of hair behind his ear and his thin lips twist into a smug smile. “You should have come straight to me.”
He set about making the latte, explaining each step as slowly and clearly as he could, like he would for any trainee. He figured Draco wouldn’t be listening but when he peeked at Draco out of the corner of his eye, he could see the man paying close attention to Harry’s actions, his eyes following each move. Harry continued.
Malfoy shrugs, jerking his hips forward to collide with Harry’s. “Maybe you were right. Maybe we both are.”
Draco laughs, flicking some of the dried blood from his face. “You’re not helping your case.”
“Yes,” Malfoy all but yelled, drawing the attention of a few stragglers around the common room.
“Where?” Potter asked, turning away from Draco to address Seamus.
It’s not long before he arrives at Draco’s adhoc dorm and spells it open. He has a quick look around but it’s as he expected – empty. Without much further thought he heads over to the fireplace, and searches for the floo powder he knows must be here. The mantelpiece is empty, or at least it appears so, but Harry’s not convinced. He feels arounds with his hand and
“Wait– ” Draco tried to shout but it was too late. He held himself to full height for confidence – it didn’t help – and walked over to Potter’s bed.
As surprises go, it was very bold. And very Harry.
“I’m not sick so I’m not technically a patient - “
“Are you – “
“What he said about Teddy–”
Draco stared at the cup blankly for a second before snatching it from Harry’s hand and turning to the coffee machine. Harry couldn’t imagine a man in an expensive three piece would ever have a reason to work a barista’s coffee machine. But if Draco was too proud to ask, then Harry had no desire to teach him.
Draco returned his gaze to Potter - he was attacking his champagne glass with very little sophistication, downing it as if it might have been a shot glass. A strand of Potter’s hair broke loose from his charms, sticking up from his head in an endearing fashion. Draco waited patiently for Potter to finish, taking a small sip of his own glass.

“Then why’d you have to bring Pansy and Blaise?”
? But he would be lying if he said he wasn’t completely on board with the suggestion. So he did as Potter wanted, and pulled him into position for a waltz.
Did Draco need to remind him that it was Potter who seemed so desperate for a bloody blowjob in the first place? Draco was just here trying to do his job, of the
(verb) dream. Not yet. Although it could be. But well, you get it.
Potter started laughing, but in a cold manic way that made Draco shiver (and not in the good way). That wasn’t Potter’s laugh; it made no sense.
Blaise smiled – it stretched over his face slowly. "You
Harry looked over to his own bed. Malfoy was fast asleep. It wasn’t fair that he got to have the unicorn space dreams (Harry could only presume) in Harry’s bed, while Harry had scary death nightmares in his. He walked over.

Friday had already been a particularly stressful day for him. The Department of Magical Law Enforcement was under scrutiny for a number of unsolved cases and all the aurors were working overtime. Harry hadn’t even realised the time until Draco and Teddy turned up at his office.
“Professor,” Harry nods, entering Professor Slughorn’s office. He averts his gaze from the many moving pictures of his own face that stare at him with pity from Slughorn’s shelves.
“Yes.”
Draco stopped Harry before he could enter the locker rooms, holding him against the wall. They were both still sweaty from the game but Draco didn’t mind - in fact, he rather liked the way Harry looked when he was flushed.
Draco considered denying it. But how was he was going to back that one up? He was a teenager. Of COURSE he took care of his fucking boner. How was that even worthy of a theory?
“Yeah,” Ron agrees. “What she said.”
“No,” Harry counters immediately as soon as he understands. “Ron,
about it.
Potter laughed. “My apologies for keeping you waiting, Malfoy. Slow isn’t really your style, is it? Would you rather I start straight at my cock and stroke myself for you? Can you hear that? That’s my hand sliding up and down my cock already. Is that what you wanted, Malfoy? Are you going to touch yourself in time with me, Malfoy? Go on, Malfoy. I’d love to hear you too.”
Malfoy’s voice continues. “I guess that’s what I get for trying to kill the boy who lived.”
“It won’t be guessing.”
Neither of them noticed that Teddy had stopped singing some time ago.
“I don’t think that’s what Hermione had in– ”
Her name is Anne. She’s not at all what Draco expects. Although he supposes it was improper of him to have expectations of a group of people he’s never even spoken to…or even to group people together based on a single similarity. Regardless, Anne is surprising.
“And you’re wearing mine,” Harry countered, eyeing the frayed, too-short red sleeves on Draco’s arms.
“Harry,” Ron says nudging him, “
Professor Slughorn stops fiddling. “Try not to draw attention to Mr Malfoy’s behaviour. The last thing we want is for other students to fancy themselves muggle detectives like yourself.”
Their first task is a simple stakeout outside Malfoy Manor. Narcissa Malfoy had reported that a number of known werewolves, and many who had been involved with Voldemort before fleeing, were often visiting the house at odd hours of the night.
“Of course, I had forgotten you were on the clock. I sincerely hope you aren’t going to get in trouble for taking a break from serving?”
“Anything in vials, leave to me,” Malfoy says, cross-legged on the floor, as Harry walks in. “Can’t have your meaty hands breaking everything.”
His thoughts are interrupted by an imposing creak of the dormitory door and a muttered, “Bloody Hell!”

“You have to get rid of the boggart in my cupboard.”
“Draco prefers to watch,” Blaise added. Draco shot him a murderous look. Blaise. Was. Dead.

The Great Lake is uncharacteristically still. They both watch it for a time, Harry half expecting the giant squid to break the surface and wave a tentacle at him. Anything to interrupt the stillness.
“I'll see you tomorrow, then,” Potter said, his face just as aflame as Draco’s. “Our next Quidditch meet,” he explained when Draco remained silent.
nothing.”
Blaise leaned into Draco to whisper: “Better keep your legs crossed.”
Malfoy’s fake smile vanishes to be replaced by exaggerated pity. “Are you really this slow, Potter? I don’t have the patience for this. Let’s try again.” He raises his wand and targets Harry once more. “Avada Kedavra.”
expected) is that Malfoy withdraws his hand from his underwear. Although, it turns out it’s not too much of a disappointment at all as it allows Harry to see the outline of Malfoy’s dick unobstructed and quite clearly through the outline of his pants. Harry’s not religious but JESUS FUCKING CHRIST. Enough said. That’s really the only coherent thoughts Harry has regarding Malfoy’s dick.
Draco smiled, warm and soft at every edge, and he leaned across the table, taking Harry’s face in his hands. Harry was right – they
Harry circled the pitch again and again, purposefully avoiding Malfoy as much as possible. He could see that smirk in his peripheral vision every time they passed but he didn’t give Malfoy the satisfaction of a reaction. Slytherin scored again. Harry had to catch the snitch now.
“Harry,” Draco said softly after a pause, “Would you like to go out for dinner with me tomorrow night? I promise it’ll just be the two of us. And significantly less wine I hope.”
Can I remind you that I did specify it would never happen between us, so fantasising is all you’ll ever be doing?
.” Draco feels her eyes boring into him so he picks up a chip and takes a small bite, just to placate her. It’s soggy and dry at the same time. Urgh. He raises an eyebrow at Pansy in defiance as he takes another bite.
One Friday night when Potter was out with his friends and Draco was left behind with the looming deadline of a Chemistry essay, Draco had a minor lapse in judgement  – he blamed the stress of college – and tried on Potter’s sports jersey. It had just been sitting there, on Potter’s computer chair, staring Draco right in the face. What was he supposed to do?
“I don’t hate him,” Malfoy says quietly, staring at Harry.
Perhaps some more ‘trust building’ is in order.
“I’m very attracted to you right now.”
Still, Harry wasn’t quite sure what it meant.
“I’ll take you to him on one condition. You stop calling me Ronald.”
“This isn’t anything. This is just a day.”
No, he did know, actually. It was the accompanying image. The one with Draco Malfoy staring right into the camera, unblinking, a challenge in his eyes. It was familiar but at the same time nothing Harry had ever seen before (except during his many rereads of this particular paper). Malfoy had aged. Matured obviously since he was now a Ministry official. There was just something about his face. The same but different. Harry was drawn to it.
Draco knew it was sappy of him but, Merlin, did he find that kindness sexy. Harry was the type of boss who took responsibility in the media when you messed up in the field. The type of boss who would take over your reporting for you (despite his own ridiculous workload) when he could see you were stressed or affected by a particularly emotional case. He was the type of boss who never treated you as if he were your boss at all.
“Sorry,” Alex says, standing up, “I’m muggleborn. My parents are Catholic.”
could you have to be here?” He asked the question like he already knew the answer. If only Harry did too.
Harry hesitated and then accepted the bottle. He took a swig and dropped down next to Malfoy. On Malfoy’s bed. He passed the bottle back.
The Ministry foyer had been converted into a ballroom of sorts, with a wide-open dance space that was yet to be filled. It usually took a while, and a couple of drinks, for the first brave couple to make their way to the dance floor. Draco wasn’t usually so brave, but he didn’t want to waste any time tonight.
Draco lifts up his shirt. Harry isn’t sure why he does it but there’s something defiant in his expression, something challenging.
Harry doesn’t need to be told.
Draco’s eyes move to Harry’s and all their previous coldness fades away.
So relaxed was Harry, and so deeply invested in his kiss with Draco, he didn’t notice the letter,
“Can I get you a drink?” Malfoy asked, once Harry had sat down.
In a little bit of a daze, Draco turned back to the stage, but Potter had disappeared. Again. Draco couldn’t deal with this much longer. He tugged at his collar. His mind was spinning.
As much as they argue, Harry is glad to work with Hermione. He trusts her completely, and though he won’t admit it, he relies on her to pull him back sometimes. Like now.
“Right,” Blaise said stiffly from somewhere beside them. “Well, I best do the rounds. Draco.”
murder. Then, Malfoy speaks.
“Alright,” Percy interrupted. “Now that that’s settled, can we please get moving?”
“You don’t
“I have to get away from
Malfoy turned back. “I don’t.”
“I’m joking, Potter,” he says with a hint of irritation. “Just– just keep doing what you’re doing.”
Draco felt himself blushing again. It was as if red was the natural colour of his skin and his paleness was the abnormality.
“Maybe you just need to remember how it feels for someone else to touch you like he did,” Potter continued, his voice back to a whisper.
“Malfoy Manor,” he calls out as clearly as he can despite the smoke in his throat and the heat at his neck. And the world begins to spin, a little bit like apparating but with plenty more knocks and bruises on the way.
“What?”
Draco knew he was very junior still, but he felt a strong sense of pride and importance in his position. After just a year and a half of training, he was already in placement as a Healer at St Mungo’s. Yes, he had Healer Gibbons supervising him constantly but she usually didn’t interfere and allowed Draco to work with minimal guidance.
“The cranes were supposed to be funny.”
Bet you feel real stupid now.
it demands, is familiar.
Draco must take a step back because Harry finds himself able to breathe again. He doesn’t open his eyes. He needs a moment.
Although, it was Draco’s proposal, so Harry probably shouldn’t have been the one overthinking the symbolism. He shook it from his head. It didn’t matter when or where Draco proposed. It only mattered that he wanted to. And Harry would gladly say yes.
Hermione nudged him under the table. Harry paid no mind, and went to take another swig of his wine glass.
with a
? What if they took one look at Harry and walked right back out the door?
“He also said you’d say it wasn’t true,” Harry says quickly. His heart is pounding against his ribs, desperate to break free. He’s nervous and dazed and ready to faint, but he’s hanging on. Hanging on for Malfoy.
“We haven’t played in a long time,” Harry replies, seeing an opening and eagerly jumping in to grab it. “Maybe a rematch is in order.”
Harry and Hermione perch themselves carefully on the torn-up couch opposite. “Is Mr Dunberg home?” Hermione asks.
“You already have, Potter. I suppose before I kill you, I should thank you for that terribly made potion of yours. It’s given me a whole new outlook on life. Any last words? No, actually, I think I’ve heard enough from you. Let’s skip to the – “
Harry looked Malfoy up and down, slowly. “I could ask you the same question.”
“So, you realised a few things, did you?” Harry asked.
“Why?” Harry asks. He supposes Draco’s right: in the end, he did go looking. But only because he didn’t know. If he’d known, well, he’s not sure what he would have done at all.
know what it is.
“Evening.” Draco repeats carefully. He studies Potter’s face. There’s something not quite right about it. Something different. He tries to picture Potter’s face at Hogwarts but comes up blank. What’s missing?
When Harry and Ron entered the common room, a loud cheer rang out around the group. Harry hoped it wasn’t to do with him. He spotted Malfoy immediately, perched on a stool by the fire, smiling along with everyone else but not making any noise, like a kid lip syncing in a choir. He wore black robes with long tight sleeves that appeared to dig into his wrists. Unlike most of the other students in the room, half of whom were dressed in their pyjamas, Malfoy looked completely in his element, as if he were nocturnal. Too late, Harry realised he’d been staring. He looked away.
Once Draco no longer had the dancing to fret over, the situation suddenly hit him. Potter. So close to him. And worse, the eye contact! Where else was Draco supposed to look than right in front of him at Potter? And where else was Potter supposed to look but right back? The silence between them seemed strange, weighted. Draco couldn’t bear it.
“You can come if you want?” Potter offers. “Sorry, I didn’t think it would be your type of place.”
“Come on, Harry. Who do you want to pick?” Ernie asked and then threw a hand over his mouth. “Sorry, I didn’t mean– ”
“No guarantees,” Harry interrupts. “And no more PDA with Hermione in front of me.”
Just as Draco’s pondering this, as if accio-ed by his thoughts, who else but Harry Potter appears in the door of the hospital room, looking horribly flushed and sweaty.
“How was your date?”
“You’ll what?” Harry interrupted. “Calmly walk around me and get a bit of grass on your shoe? Sounds terrifying.”
His eyes dart behind him and catch sight of Harry. He doesn’t look surprised. He stops walking.
They see Harry coming and bundle up their papers, shoving them out of sight.
“And while you’ve been off stalking Malfoy – “
Malfoy frowned. “Not not really. No at all. I’m actually glad I – “ He stopped himself, his eyes darting to Harry sharply. “Well, I just mean it’s probably best I didn’t text them.”
“And you’re sure he said Malfoy Manor?”
Harry considers Zabini. Although Harry doesn’t fancy facing him in a physical battle, he’s sure he can best him in a duel…if only he can get to his wand first. Zabini hasn’t yet pulled out his wand, which is a relief, but he is standing very close. It will be very easy for him to throw a punch as soon as Harry makes any sudden movements. Harry remains still.
-enemy.”
“You don’t need to help me out of any moral obligation. I know you feel bad about the Dunbergs. You don’t need to prove it by becoming my personal defender. Seems like an awful waste of the great Harry Potter’s time.”
Harry studies the profile of Malfoy’s face. “What does that mean?” He asks.
A crease between Malfoy’s brows deepens.
“But daddy always gets rid of the boggart,” Teddy said, sitting up in bed.
“If you want romance, you can talk to me any other day of the year,” Potter said with the hint of the attitude he’d had when he’d answered the phone.
incredibly frustrating,” Harry said, his voice rising dangerously again. He hoped Teddy’s singing was enough to drown him out. “Why do you have to be so defensive all the time?”
Malfoy shrugged, probably realising he’d revealed too much in his anger. “Minutes, I mean. I was exaggerating.”
“You’re really going to stay with me?” Harry asks.
“Who?” Hermione asks. “And why?”
“What did you do?” she asks, arms crossed, bushy hair still plopped on top of her head in her usual sleep-bun. Harry continues on past her and she follows.
Hermione sighs. “And you’re not going to report it,” she says. It’s not a question.
(rather than play noughts and crosses in the margins of his Potions textbook with Ron).
Of course, Pansy came to find him when he didn’t show up for breakfast. He should have expected that. She strode down into Draco’s dormitory without any regard for privacy, but she had also brought an apple, and Draco was starving so he let it slide.
. That’s why it was delivered to him. On the back page, there is a single word, drawn in a messy italic scrawl:
(See the end of the chapter for
Fuck it. Draco was horny as hell, and he wanted to touch himself, Harry’s eyes be damned. He let his hormones overpower his nerves just this once and quickly unzipped his trousers.
“Yes, you can,” urges Zabini, his hand clenching around Harry’s shirt now.
Potter was right of course. Draco had only been wearing his briefs when he called but Potter wasn’t supposed to
Harry shivered. “I should go,” he suggested again. He was starting to feel a little light headed and he hadn’t even been drinking.
“Why?”
Malfoy snorts derisively. “At an inflated price to an already marginalised and often poor group of people. The Ministry doesn’t provide the potion to
So, this is how Harry finds himself. Jerking himself off, underneath Draco Malfoy…who is also jerking himself off. It’s strange. Harry feels like maybe he should perhaps reach a hand up and swap hands with Malfoy, but then there’s also something hot about just getting off in front of each other as well. Also, Harry’s too nervous to make any more moves, so there’s that too. But while he’s thinking about this, he’s losing the opportunity to just enjoy the moment. And fucking praise Merlin, Harry is very much enjoying being underneath Malfoy. It is just great. Well that sounds sarcastic, but it’s truly not. Being underneath Malfoy is great. The greatest even. And yeah, Harry is appreciating it all right now.
Relieved from his obsessive thought cycle by Luna, Harry’s mind becomes a little clearer. Malfoy’s behaviour must be related to the incident with Harry’s potion, and the only two people Harry knows have an idea of what happened, besides Malfoy himself of course, are Madam Pomfrey and Professor Slughorn. He doesn’t much fancy facing Madam Pomfrey again so he heads to Slughorn’s office.

“I don’t. I
“Can someone please explain what’s going on here?” Ron asked loudly.
“Have sex with you?” Finished Draco. “Almost definitely.”
Hermione doesn’t like the plan of course. She looks over Harry’s scribbled notes with a frown.
Harry understood although he immediately wished he didn’t. He laughed nervously. “I think he wants us to make out.”
A scatter of laughter falls from Draco’s mouth but it’s humourless. “I’m half a person, Harry. I’m not enough. I’m not
Potter laughed, a loud charming sound that brought Draco back to many places at once, many different November thirds. “It’s
“Sorry– I mean, never mind.” Harry keeps his eyes well above Malfoy’s neck. “Do you have any dittany?”
Harry wants to ask but the warning expression on Draco’s face causes his voice to falter. He remains silent as he follows Draco into the next room. Harry continues to watch silently as Draco searches the room for floo powder, his demeanor becoming more and more frantic as he does.
“We’re not arresting you.”
Potter leans back and nods in agreement. “What have you been doing since…” Not for the first time tonight, Potter trails off and clearly changes his line of thought. “Since school?” He finishes.
Harry dropped his hands and the flowers stopped growing.
Potter didn’t say anything for a moment, his narrow eyes blinking back at Draco’s slowly, before his face relaxed. Although the smile that appeared seemed a little too deliberate. “Nothing,” he said with a shrug. “I’d love to dance of course.”
“I don’t need help,” Draco says through gritted teeth. Why must everyone treat him like a child? He can look after himself. “And I’m not going to the hospital. I’m already seeing a doctor.”
Draco almost rolled his eyes but he ended up not bothering since Potter couldn’t appreciate the gesture in his current state anyway. All this time, Draco had thought there had been something wrong with
Harry spared a brief thought for the breakfast they would certainly be missing this morning in the Great Hall before gliding his fingers down to the waistband of Draco’s pyjama pants. He let them sit there, brushing across Draco’s hipbones gently, waiting for permission to go further.
He knows why. He’s being selfish.
“Yes.”
- it wasn’t helping Draco’s resolve. “Are you in a mood?”
Harry goes to walk to his desk but Hermione’s already standing in front of it. He looks up at her with a weak smile. “I had a shower?”
wanted to.”
So with no dares and no audience, Harry kissed him again.
already be hard - as he looked up to meet Potter’s eye. “Right now I would,” he said in answer to Potter’s question.
Draco smiled, but didn’t open his eyes or move. “Oh will you now, Potter?”
“Harry’s already answered your truth. I think that’s enough, don’t you, Malfoy?”
“No.” Draco crossed his arms. “If I don’t leave the dormitory, I can’t talk to Potter and I won’t - “
“Thanks,” Potter mumbled, clutching at the material loosely. He didn’t seem as aware as he had been earlier.
Draco Malfoy
Harry found his way over to Draco and Teddy - by walking, not apparating - and joined in on the hug. And because his heart was overflowing with the words: “I love you both.”
Now, when he gets to the light, things become a little clearer. He’s not just in darkness anymore. He’s in a Hogwarts dorm. A Slytherin dorm he’s willing to bet from the dampness of the room, although that could just be what all dreams are like. He can’t remember any others right now. The beds are all empty in the dorm bar one, which is where the light is coming from – the source is a wand tip on a bedside counter, shining light onto the sleeping occupant of the bed.
“Truth!” Draco yelled out quickly, turning to Potter. ‘I choose truth.” Whatever dare Potter was planning - however tame - Draco couldn’t do it. Not right now.
Irritation prickles at the back of Harry’s neck at his best friend siding with Malfoy. “Fine. It’s none of your business,” he amends. “Happy now?”
“I did. I do. I don’t know.” Harry shakes his head and pushes matted hair from his eyes; the transformation always leaves him worse for wear. "It’s not that simple, Hermione. There’s so much I have to hold back.”
Ron shrugs in defeated agreement and the two head off towards the library.
Harry stifles a yawn and tries to remember what he found out. It was certainly more than nothing. “We know he has a contact. If we can just find–”
He looks around for his next dueller and is surprised to see Malfoy duelling two masked figures at once. There is no sign of the other intruders. He’s just about to assist Malfoy when something – someone – hits him full force in the chest, taking him barrelling to the ground. It’s the attacker he disarmed.
“Nothing,” Harry answered Malfoy. Which was basically the truth after all – Malfoy had been the one holding Harry down and pushing
And Malfoy’s breathing is getting heavier and his hand is moving faster and good grief he must be close. One part of Harry is a little sad he missed out on the chance to touch Malfoy as he thinks it might seem a little silly to get involved now so late in the game (although why he cares what a dream Malfoy thinks of him, he has no idea) and another part is fucking randy and excited. Because he’s actually going to get to see Malfoy come now. And that is entirely unexplainably exciting.
“Perfect. We’ll have that.” Draco says quickly, handing over the drinks menu. He can’t bear to look back down at it.
“So you’re not even going to check to make sure?” Harry interrupted, shuffling on his seat. This was so not how he wanted this to go down. “It could be serious.”
. Something worth embarrassing himself over.
“The most simple solutions generally require the most needlessly complex potions. Neither of you could hope to master such a potion by the end of the school year.”
“Do you think that maybe we just had the timing wrong?” Draco finally continues his earlier thought, still not looking at Harry. “That we weren’t supposed to be together until…until now.”
“Yeah she…I’m glad.” Potter says, seeming unable to string a full sentence together. He looks over to the Doctor. “Sorry, I’m interrupting. I’ll wait outside.”
wanted to say something.”
Harry tucked Teddy into bed while Draco saw his friends off. He figured he’d quietly slip away and avoid any awkward encounter with Draco - from what he’d overheard Draco was quite tipsy. With one last kiss to Teddy’s forehead, Harry turned to make his quick exit.
Hesitating only a second longer, Ron gives Hermione a brief kiss, passes over the Marauder’s Map to Harry – who takes it automatically – and heads off down the corridor, with one last glance at Malfoy. As he disappears around the corner, a heavy silence takes hold.
“Mind the language. I think we’re supposed to make up now.”
“You can talk – if you weren’t always playing the damsel in distress, I wouldn’t have to save you so much,” Harry retorted, careful to keep his voice down. He didn’t want to argue in front of students. “Besides, you’ve never complained before. I thought perhaps you liked it when I came to your rescue.” Or flirt in front of students.
Draco felt some of the adrenaline he was missing building in his bloodstream. This was more like it. “Don’t tell me you’re a sore loser, Potter,” he teased, enjoying the way Potter’s face flushed in reaction.
