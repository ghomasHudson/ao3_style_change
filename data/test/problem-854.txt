Potter’s eyes bugged out but before he could protest the cost, Draco dropped the coins on the counter. He opened the packet and choked down the coffee powder, then shot a small Aguamenti at his mouth to rinse out the grit.
“One more time won’t kill you,” Pansy laughed, moving her fingers quickly through his hair. It had grown out considerably since May, and nearly reached his shoulders. Daria and Annie giggled as they crammed little white flowers into each tiny plait. Pansy helped by attaching a few with sticking charms. “There we go! All finished!”
Not really, but he didn’t want to faint from hunger at a key moment either so he accepted the chutney and cheese sandwich that Ron offered. He was just finishing his last bite when a knock sounded.
. How could Draco do anything else but follow that up with a kiss? Harry eagerly opened to him, tasting of tart wine.
Dosing charts didn’t exist for Wolfsbane Potion, so far as they knew. Theo and Draco had done their best to guess how much Robbie and Jane should take each day. Getting them to drink it had been another struggle altogether. Draco could hardly blame them, foul as the brew smelled. But each day he witnessed them drinking it, hoping all the while he wasn’t slowly killing them.
“Funded from your own vaults?” Ms Coddle interrupted. “How long do you think you can survive such expenses?”
“I think you’ll be fine in your cardi. If not, we’ve got warming charms. Ready?” Harry held out one end of his scarf to Draco.
romantic sentiment. And rolled his eyes out of habit, even if Harry couldn’t see it. “I had a good day with you.”
Draco fiddled with a napkin on the table, watching Harry pretend to read the paper. At least he didn’t know what to say either. And then, of course, one of the nosy fucking reporters from the Prophet accosted them. Speaking of making everything worse...
The stares of other people made his skin crawl. He didn’t know whether their hate was real or imagined, but it prickled enough to be real to him. And he fucking hated it. But it was Draco playing host to this little drinking spree, and so it was Draco that had to go.
“All that matters is you’re bigger than Simon,” Niall panted as Dev’s cock started to slide home, “and fuck
Blaise’s suspicion instantly turned to glee. “Hoo-hoo, the plot thickens. I do love a good plot twist. I trust there’s mischief afoot?”
“I wish I could brush that hair away for you,” Harry said. His fingers curled in the duvet to keep from doing just that.
“That’s okay. You don’t have to take me back. Or at least you can think on it a bit before deciding. But… I know I miss you and… After thinking on it, what does it matter what sort of pants you wear? Pants are pants, right? You should do what makes you happy.”
If Draco catches the snitch, there will be obnoxious gloating about who the better flyer really is and a condescending offer of a rematch. Draco will dole out backhanded compliments, biting kisses, and zealous charm that will lead to wild, hard fucking.
“Mate, I’m no fool. I had to hide in the fucking bathroom because…” He gestured vaguely at his groin. “There was definite interest I was unprepared for.”
The blanket they shared fell to his waist as Harry sat up to straddle Draco’s hips. Slowly he lowered himself onto Draco’s cock with a loud moan. Draco dug his heels into the plush rug and arched his back to press in deeper. Their hands joined at Harry’s hips as he rocked gently.
“Surprise!” Draco planted a smacking kiss on Harry’s cheek. “I know it’s silly, but we’ve been married thirty-one days today. And I was just so excited, I thought we could celebrate with some chocolate cake.” He grinned. “Because I don’t have to leave.”
“Uh-uh,” Draco tsked as Harry ran a hand down Draco’s chest. “Wash first. I’m not sucking anything until it’s squeaky clean.”
He reared back, managing to smile anyway. “Thank you, Little Bit, but that’s all yours.” He reached for a napkin to wipe at her face and dripping hands. “What NEWT year?” he asked Potter.
They spent the entire afternoon decorating the large ballroom with streamers and balloons. Dashing confetti that dissolved and reformed made the room look like a snow globe. Harry showed up in the middle of it, brimming with excitement. And a box of fireworks from Weasley Wizard Wheezes.
As Draco banished Harry’s clothes to the laundry hamper, Harry cooed, “Ooh, so sexy using your sexy magic to get me naked.”
As he stepped inside the lift, Draco’s potion-drenched mind raced. An adult. An adultier adult than him. He punched the wall of the lift in frustration.
Over dinner, Ron and Harry filled Hermione in on the accident during the raid, and the cauldron that covered them both in a slimy potion. Several minutes later, Ron found himself looking out of Harry’s eyes and they left the crime scene for St Mungo’s.
Draco sat with his head in his hands, focusing on his breathing. In and out. Slow and steady. Fuck if he was going to have a breakdown in this shabby Ministry hallway. His lungs rattled in his chest on the inhale. His throat burned like fire on the exhale. Slow and steady. In and out.
Signing the publishing contract had sparked their first major break-up. Ginny brought him the orchid as an apology, emphasising her worry that with Molly as a full time job, Harry would have a harder and harder time taking care of himself, and needed a gentle reminder to keep up with daily care.
“Erm,” Draco said hesitantly. “You can’t sit there. That’s Annie’s seat, and she’s particular...” As he spoke, the wily little girl climbed into the chair with an angelic grin.
“You wait here!” Harry said, guiding Draco to sit on their bed. “I hid your gift in my workshop so you wouldn’t find it while you were snooping around.”
“Oh.” Harry didn’t have an argument for that. That seemed like exactly the sort of bullshit Lucius Malfoy would engage in. He shook his head. “No, I don’t believe it. If courtship would do wonders for their reputation, so would a betrothal. And a marriage.”
The duelling room was just a plain, empty space with no mirrors or windows. The ceiling tiles glowed with a lumos spell that kept the space bright, but not glaringly so. As they stepped inside, they noticed the floors had a light cushioning to them, presumably to prevent injury from falls. A large timer on the wall began counting down an hour.
Even in the dark he recognised the curves and lines of his four poster bed, the largely useless desk in one corner, and the sitting area in the other. He vaguely remembered Potter asking where his room was, and it looked like he found it.
“I know, it’s just…” Harry looked around at the passing students on their way to their first lessons of the day. “I liked spending my day with you.” The light of mischief had him grinning. “Want to skive off classes and sneak into Hogsmeade?”
He found a pendant in Hogsmeade of a dragon curled around a pearl. Kreacher made him mini fire drop biscuits to make Draco huff fire. And then, just to make Draco laugh, a hat and mittens set that had tiny dragon spikes running along the back.
“Just the ones involving your lover’s semen?” Harry couldn’t help but ask. He deserved a medal for keeping a straight face. Behind Draco he saw Blaise and Neville rolling their eyes and laughing. Everyone had
to be seductive, but came out entirely too slurred. “Pansy said the list looked like fun so I made her a copy.”
“I’ll show you the way, Pickles,” Astoria said with a wide smile. She winked at Draco and led the Elf away.
he isn’t.” His words came fast now, pleading and desperate. “I need—I need a-an adult.” Draco wiped at his brow again, and felt a tremor in his hands. Fucking bad sign. “Ms Coddle said if we have someone older on our board, we can keep the baby. Please, you have to help us. Surely you know someone that is willing to sign on with us.”
“Yes it is,” Draco said, still smiling. “That’s good too.” He laid down on his bed and patted the covers next to him. “Come lay down with me.”
“Indeed. Magic is brilliant for that.” He paused for a moment then said, “Well? Aren’t you going to give it a try?”
Grimmauld Place wasn’t exactly the pleasant haven either of them hoped for. With both Kreacher and Harry at Hogwarts full time, there wasn’t any reason or time to maintain it.
“No you didn’t!” Draco laughed. “I don’t know how you managed it. I swear we’ve had more sex this month than all of last month put together.”
Draco sat up too and reached for the box, opening it to see what it contained. “Yes, even if we each only do it once.” He glanced over the instructions and elbowed Harry. “You’re going to need to get hard for the duplicating spell. So, clothes off!”
“Harry, we have a back room for Apparating, and you know it,” Weasley chided. “You’re really helping this slimy git?”
“Fair enough.” Harry leaned in for one last kiss then hid himself completely. “I’ll see you at home?”
“Thirty-four days,” Harry corrected on Friday. “It’s less depressing if you count down to when your mum is checking in with us.”
Harry tilted the vial back and forth, watching the golden liquid slosh around. “I think I’m mainly curious… About what it might give me now that I’m already so happy.”
This was based off a comic someone posted on the Drarry Discord. Again, I have no link and no way of finding it. Sorry to be so disorganised!
They all crammed into the lift for the most awkward ride of Draco’s life. He sighed in relief as he followed Andromeda and Ms Coddle to Charity Commissions to sign the necessary paperwork, leaving Harry and Auror Blakely to continue on to the Auror Department.
Something cracked and splintered inside Harry as Ginny forced a smile across the table. Adrenaline simmered in Harry’s blood as he watched Draco, eyes shining and excited, lean forward to twist the knife. “Even I know a plant’s a terrible idea, and I’ve only known him a week.”
“Damn it!” Draco cursed, scrubbing his hair and turning once more to the baby. “He’s a McNair. Both his father and his aunt were allergic to mandrakes. I’d bet he is too.” His fingers landed on the sheets, just outside the boundary of spells. “It’s okay, baby, we’ll take you home soon.”
“Regret?” Draco said through a burst of laughter. “Harry, you were fucking brilliant. All of it, perfect. Brilliant. Wonderful. I’d do all of it again in a heartbeat. Why don’t you believe me?”
Draco set his pots of paint in the storage box and sat next to Potter. “You’re probably never going to leave that behind.”
Auror Blakely didn’t seem to think so, but Draco stayed silent on the subject. The others were waiting on them and now wasn’t the time to belabour the point.
Pansy made a dismissive sound. “Who even cares?” She leaned into Harry, resting a hand on his arm and focusing on him as though he was the only man in the pub. “Poor Molly. I felt so sorry for Mr Wiggles! What made you write such a sad story for her?”
“It was a warning.” Harry sat back to give Draco more breathing room. “Look, you don’t have to answer now, all right? It’s just something for us to consider.”
“No,” Draco groaned, shaking his head roughly. Andromeda Apparated into the spot they’d just vacated, a squirming Teddy in her arms. “I mean yes, I’m fine.” He loosened his tie even more and smoothed his damp hair. “Last night was the full moon,” he whispered. “I was up all night, and then all this with Orion. I’ll be fine. I just need to collect him and get back home.”
? There’s going to be more than one? I didn’t realise my boyfriend would be assigning homework as soon as he got me alone.”
They’d charmed the floor-to-ceiling windows as soon as they moved in, so they could see out and no one could see in. But even knowing that no one could see them did nothing to dim the naughty excitement of fucking in a place where they might be seen.
“I think we’re meant to share some sort of sexy experiences or desires… but we’ve been together so long, you have your own memories of all my sexiest moments and there are no hidden desires left between us.” He paused, tilting his head in question.
“Mm, maybe what I want, Harry...” Draco said seductively, finally coming closer. He squeezed his cock and a drop of pre-come pooled at the tip.
For now, he’d enjoy the fun that landed in his lap. Literally. Draco pushed Harry to a bench and straddled his hips. “Tell me you want it,” Draco moaned, brushing his lips across Harry’s.
He hated that his regular Healer was next door with Harry. Healer Jane had a sweet demeanor that never made Ron feel guilty for the scrapes Harry and the other Aurors got him into. And sometimes she snuck him a lolly like she used to when he was seven.
Memories swam to the surface of Alex and Jason in the year below him at school. Leila and Marrin were complete strangers, although he soon learned Marrin was in the same year as Astoria, and Leila a year below that. He’d missed the initial introductions and got the scoop from Theo while Pansy sorted everyone into bathrooms for showers.
Harry perked up at the small black box tied with a purple satin ribbon. “Ooh, so fancy!” He opened the box and found burgundy satin and lace.
“Okay. That’s all right. There’s plenty of time. This dose should last us two hours and I’ll be sure you experience every brilliant, delicious, pleasurable thing your body can do to mine.”
Before Harry could respond, an otter patronus bounded through the walls and Hermione’s voice said, “
A drowsy fog rolled through his head once again as Draco tried to force his eyes open. He yelped when a sharp sting hit his side. “Ow, that fucking hurt, you son of a bitch!”
Pansy’s face crumpled and he pulled her into a hug. “You great fucking arsehole. You know I’m not leaving!” She sniffed against his t-shirt. “We can’t do this!”
The baby squealed happily and reached for Greg so he offered to sit out the first round. Draco pulled Chester up in front of him and kicked off, circling the garden in one long, lazy loop. Elyon was old enough to ride his own broom, but Theo shadowed him just in case. Potter pulled Roger up with him and almost made Draco’s heart stop when he immediately went into a swooping dive. Roger squealed in delight and urged him on faster.
“What.” Draco’s hands dropped to his sides and blinked several times before scrunching up in confusion. “What is going on here?”
Ms Coddle handed Draco a small square of parchment, and an official form. “Here’s the address for the foster home, as well as the paperwork returning him to your care. Mr Talpin will accompany you, in case there are any problems.”
“Draco… I…” Harry blinked, completely bewildered. He let Draco pull him to the sofa and sat in a daze. Was he dreaming? Did Draco really kiss him?
Harry’s arm came around Draco’s waist and pulled their bodies flush together. “You’ll have to be still or we’ll unbalance.” Through their thin workout clothes, Draco could feel Harry’s interested cock.
Harry kicked off his trainers and sat cross-legged on Draco’s bed, watching him get the violin out of its case and set up his sheet music.
At long last, Harry came in with a beaming smile and sat next to Draco on their sofa. He took Draco’s hand and said, “Did you know that up until entirely too recently homosexual behaviour was thought to be caused by dark magical influences?”
“It builds suspense. And I think it’s funny. I hope you like it. Although it’s honestly okay if you don’t. Especially since it’s a silly thing and we just cleaned out the toy box.”
“Mother,” Draco said formally as the headmistress left. “May I present Mr Potter. Mr Potter, my mother, Lady Malfoy.”
Draco blinked a few times and then said smoothly, as if he’d rehearsed his answer, “We met on a travel forum about sites of interest in Hakata, Japan.”
Draco wasn’t terribly reassured by the addition of Mr Talpin, but Potter gave him a confident smile as he led them to the lifts. The address was right there in London, easy enough for them all to Apparate too. They took the stairs to the first floor, and Draco knocked loudly on the door. After waiting several moments, he knocked again, but there was no response.
They hadn’t dug out those photos in over three years. Not since their tenth anniversary when they went back to France for a second honeymoon. It had been wine and buttery pastries and laughter and kisses and reminiscing then too.
It melted Draco’s heart and he shook his head. “Merlin, I’m such a sap for you. This better be good and not utterly ridiculous.”
? Fuck off with you! And expect a restraining order to be filed tomorrow. Or will it? Probably can’t count on the Aurors enforcing
Theo laid a hand on Jason’s arm to calm him. “If Potter didn’t return right away with Aurors on his heels, that means he hasn’t told anyone yet. Perhaps he’s thinking it over.”
Draco sauntered forward and tugged on Harry’s belt loops. He nuzzled Harry’s cold cheek and whispered, “Me either. Best idea you’ve had all day.”
Jane crowded close behind Draco instead of answering. Draco shook his head. “Why don’t you bring some food to the conservatory? Astoria, can you get Theo for me? And the big med kit? Come along, Jane, it’s this way.” Astoria’s eyes widened when they met Pansy’s but both of them hurried to their tasks.
Theo went along the long wall, touching up little bits of paint here and there. “Definitely more fun than the hideous design that was there before. What was your mother thinking?”
Everyone stiffened when Ms Coddle and her assistant came in after Draco. Annie jumped off her trunk and ran at Draco full tilt. He picked her up, hugging her tight to reassure her silently as best he could.
Draco pulled a pocket watch from his waistcoat and checked the time. “Let’s start tomorrow since today is nearly over.”
“Welcome to Sweet Treats. My name is Amanda. Just let me know when you’re ready to put your box together!” The young woman behind the counter smiled widely, and gestured to the display boxes of various sizes on the wall behind her.
Harry held up the cards with a grin. “It’s a card game. Muggle kids play it. Sit up and I’ll show you how it goes.”
“I will definitely keep it in mind.” Harry cleaned up their sticky mess, then noxed the lights. The covers rustled as they settled into their usual spooning positions, with Harry as the little spoon. He laced their fingers together against his chest. “I’m glad you’re having fun with this game.”
“I don’t care how many cleaning charms they’ve thrown around, we’re not fucking in here,” Draco said decisively.
Although he’d said it in a teasing tone, Harry knew Draco meant the words seriously. They’d talked before about Draco’s coming out to his parents, and his emphatic demand that they notify any young witch they contacted about marriage of that one fact. Draco wasn’t going to marry some poor girl that expected romance and love. He could do his duty and marry a witch, but he wasn’t going to sleep with her.
“This one’s got linens. Who wants hundred year old sheets?” Alex lifted the top sheet out and grimaced at the holes and stains in it.
with the fucking hunting dog, he’d have saved it for a night when Potter wasn’t around. At least the fox and hound separated at the end of the film. Although that clearly wasn’t what Potter took away from it. Draco deserved a medal for the brave way he endured Potter’s shy smile and soft goodbye that evening.
“Want one?” Malfoy asked, showing Harry the large box of assorted flavours. “A gift from a secret admirer,” he smirked, as though Harry didn’t have admirers of his own.
Some would say he deserved this happiness, that all the shit Voldemort and the war put him through meant that he was owed something good. But Harry knew the universe never worked that way. He was lucky. Lucky to have this beautiful moment with someone he cared about.
Thanks in advance to CleopatraIsMyName for the beta of this project I decided to take on at the last minute!
But Draco gave Harry’s hip a squeeze and stepped back. Harry carefully slipped off the toy, hissing when it popped free. He kept waiting for embarrassment to overwhelm him, but the sweet high of his orgasm still swirled through his veins and he couldn’t really care about anything at the moment.
Less than a minute later a falcon patronus swooped in and a woman’s voice said, “I’ll open the wards.”
Thankfully Potter laughed, “I’m just here as a friend.” He looked down at Jane. “What do you normally do after dinner?”
“Aurors Potter and Weasley, something you’d like to share with the rest of the class?” Malfoy bit out from entirely too close behind them.
He wished he had a wand that worked for him so he could Apparate away. Instead he had to settle for the floo. But where to go? He didn’t want to return home empty-handed and he couldn’t bear to be in Diagon Alley any longer.
“They’re well enough. With summer coming to an end, we’re sending half of them off to school.” His eyes scanned the shelves. “I’m looking for backpacks, satchels, whatever you’ve got.”
“Pregnancy is making Pansy completely daft. She cried for ten minutes about some white roses in their greenhouse, ate six peaches—one right after the other—drank about four bottles of lemonade, and then collapsed in bed. Dead asleep. I’m not sure what happened there but I’m free now!”
“Please, you know you have to after what Dev said about Niall!” I clutch the ruler with a pleading look, and know I have him when his shoulders droop in resignation.
His mouth moved without his permission. “We could try again, you know. If it helps, I’ve stopped wearing the… you know.”
The hooded eyes and dark, wavy hair of Andromeda Tonks instantly put Draco on edge. She indicated they should sit, then went to tend to a baby crying in another room. When she returned, her hair was pulled into a loose bun and an infant with turquoise hair gurgled happily in her arms, and the resemblance to Bellatrix was effectively gone.
Draco stood and nudged her towards the door. “Don’t you worry about anything, Jane. I promised we’d keep you safe and it’s a promise I’ll keep.”
Harry glanced down at his wrecked uniform and nodded, “Actually, that would be great. I could do with some company.” He loved those rare visits when he needed to borrow clothes. Three weeks ago, he’d managed to wear Draco’s t-shirt home. He planned to return it soon; he just kept forgetting. Accidentally.
Harry stood more slowly, and smiled at Draco. “Erm, well… Are you coming to the common room?” he asked.
“Excellent idea, Theo. Okay lists, everyone. I’ll go to Diagon Alley when it’s ready.” He searched the room for two specific boys. “Right now, I’m going to talk to Alex and Jason, see if I can convince them they’re better off at school.”
“Why don’t you have a jumper or coat? It’s freezing out!” Draco licked his lips, barely controlling the impulse to tear Harry’s shirt open.
He pushed past Pansy, trying not to let the thought of new applicants distract him. They’d had one or two new kids per month since they got their official paperwork last October until they finally reached capacity. How they would manage an extra three, even with Winky full time and Harry for most of the time… But that was a thought for tomorrow. He had other, more important things to think about now.
“I hope so. I want to get my parents back, restore their memories and all that. But that felt too personal. I’m also wanting to get married, but not sure I need that within five years. Kids would be nice, but not necessary. I don’t know. Too many things. But for certain, I want to make a difference in the world.” She smiled at him and linked their arms together. “What about you? Where do you want to be in five years?”
Maybe Harry shouldn’t have given up the last seventeen days of his life debt, he whined to himself as he thought of the beautiful flush of Draco’s skin and the sweet sighs that poured from his mouth.
going to offer to let you read it after I was done but now I’m not.” He stuck his tongue out at Ron for good measure. “But a picnic sounds like fun. Maybe Draco and I will do that for lunch on Saturday.”
“Gross!” Ron made a gagging sound. “No! I hid until it went away!” He waved his hands dramatically. “We’re getting off topic. Why didn’t you tell me?”
That wasn’t what Draco meant, but it brought a smile to Potter’s face so he didn’t protest on their way to the dining room.
Draco smirked and stepped back, leaning against the small countertop where he’d set the pyjamas he’d brought in for Harry. He slipped his hand into his own pyjama bottoms, stroking himself lightly. “Go ahead, then.”
“I went with Gryffindor red, after that stupid Slytherin green thing. As if Granny Smith in any way resembles Slytherin green.” He smiled as Harry pulled the knickers from their tiny box. “You deserve something special of your own. And I wanted to be sure it was fun for you again.”
Draco pulled away, avoiding eye contact and wiping at his nose and mouth with his sleeve. What a disgusting fucking mess he’d become in the last twenty-four hours. “Thank you,” he whispered, his voice raw in his own ears. “I don’t think we’d have found him without you.”
Ron gave an odd little laugh. “Right, Draco. So… erm… How are you doing these days? Working?” He looked a little panicked. Maybe Harry should have warned him first, but the coward’s way out had been easier.
“If you say so but I’m going on record as saying it’ll be lame.” Draco threw his dirty robes in the hamper and started the water in the shower.
He hadn’t been inside Harry’s mind this way in years. It had helped occasionally early on when Harry had something important to tell him but grew frustrated with trying to express himself.
Hermione sat on one of the benches by the Gryffindor changing room to wait for Ron, not caring she might miss out on the firewhisky. Theo, with much more annoyed reluctance, joined her to wait for Draco. Harry expected them both to stay, even if neither of them knew about the plan. Ron didn’t like keeping it from Hermione, but acknowledged she’d probably try and put a stop to it if she knew.
Harry shrugged. “I wasn’t thinking when I banished it and I guess it landed back in the box. But you’re right, we hate it and it can be the first thing to go.” He took it from Draco and dumped it into the rubbish bin they’d set next to the bed for this.
Headmistress McGonagall ushered Theo Nott, grinning again, into the room. “Mr Nott, as requested,” McGonagall said stiffly. Headmistresses likely didn’t go around fetching students and Harry wondered how Narcissa had convinced her. Perhaps McGonagall just didn’t want to wait with Narcissa.
If Harry catches the snitch, there will be sulky complaining about the angle of the sun and whiny demands for a rematch. Harry will need soothing words, lingering kisses, and careful wooing that will lead to a long, slow joining of their bodies.
“I see.” Draco said, crossing his arms. This whole process reeked of ulterior motives. “We weren’t expecting an inspection.”
Potter shrugged unapologetically, “You didn’t answer when I called your name so… stinging hex. You told me not to let you fall asleep here.”
The wizard ticked off boxes quickly on the form and then turned it towards them. “No, you heard me right. Sadly, it’s not as good a deterrent as you’d think. If you could authorise a Gringotts withdrawal here and sign here please.”
The awkward group trailed up the main staircase, silent but for Daria’s slow but steady chatter. The bedrooms underwent the same decluttering as the rest of the house when they filled with children. They housed two to a room, boys to the right of the main stairs, girls to the left. Ms Coddle oohed and aahed over the toys and books Daria and Libby showed off. She met with stern resistance from some of the others, particularly Bryce and Elyon, who had been literally dumped on the street by a Ministry official just like her.
Draco choked on an olive halfway through Harry’s sentence. “Why would anyone find Parseltongue kinky? It’s all hissing and spitting. Not sexy at all.”
The steamy air of the conservatory hit Draco and he wished he had a wand to spell the windows open. Carefully he laid Robbie on a bench and eased his cloak off. The robe had stiff spots where blood had already dried, but it was still pliant enough that Draco could remove it as well. Robbie’s frail body shivered, even in the warm air.
He pulled his wallet slowly, avoiding Harry’s eyes. “I didn’t realise you were—You’re only ever in the papers with women.”
her. Not like he knew Draco, and couldn’t be sure she could hold his attention. But Draco on the other hand… Well all his friends would remember his sixth year obsession and might not question too closely that Harry might be interested in him now.
“The very bottom, for sure,” Draco said with an eye roll. “Harry, we have more galleons than anyone I know. Surely we can count this purchase as a loss and get rid of it.”
cascaded over Harry’s cheeks. They were forty-one! What the fuck did Harry have to blush about after all these years together?
Draco made a non-committal sound and followed Harry and Pansy to the table. The three of them shuffled awkwardly until Harry ended up in his original seat, flanked by Draco on his left at the head of the table and Pansy on his right. He made a quick round of introductions. “Ron, Ginny, you remember Draco and Pansy from school.”
With an absent-minded air that concerned Harry, Draco stared at the television and ate popcorn from their shared bowl. Friends could share popcorn, but not a blanket. Usually Draco talked over their film with tales of Healer training or some disgusting medical anomaly he’d read about.
“Mm, I missed you too.” Harry led him to the sofa with a smile, but Draco pursed his lips again and inclined his head down the hall to Harry’s bedroom. Harry’s smile widened into a wicked grin as he led the way. He shoved the basket of laundry off the bed, spilling his clothes everywhere, as he pushed Draco to the newly vacated space. “Much better idea.” Harry straddled Draco’s hips and bent down for another searing kiss.
“I’m fine! Don’t come in here!” Ron pressed his face to the door and drew in a deep breath. Slow exhale. The flimsy hospital gown hid absolutely nothing and he would
“Right. Of course.” Draco parted his shirt and laid flat on his back. “Fuck, I knew you’d find a way.”
The day passed too quickly for Harry, but he had to admit it was still nice to see their friends again. Even if he would miss his nights with Draco at his side. Draco and Harry shared an armchair after dinner and listened to story after story about everyone’s holiday.
“Mr Malfoy,” Ms Coddle sighed, “I admire what you’re doing. I really do. But a baby… This is best for everyone.”
His panic halted when Lavender Finnigan came to his unintentional rescue, asking for pizza money. “I’ve got us,” Harry said, handing Lavender the money. She added it to her pile absently, ignoring him in favour of welcoming Pansy, without a single suspicious glare at Harry. Money was money, and Lavender welcomed all customers to the pub.
“No, I was getting ready for our date.” Perhaps it was just me projecting, but something about his pinched lips made me say hesitantly, “You know… if you want...” His eyes perked up, giving me confidence to continue, “If you wanted, I could get us some takeaway and we could… put on our jammies and watch that—”
“Finally, Potter, we find a use for that mouth of yours,” Draco said, slipping into his role easily enough. He tugged on Harry’s hair when he saw him reaching for the flies of his jeans. “Uh, uh, uh, naughty boy. Focus on the task at hand.” Harry’s eyes met his and he gave Harry a smirk. “Well, at
Malfoy knocked on the door. “Are you all right? Is it a side effect we haven’t documented? Weasley? Can I come in?”
He had the courtesy, at least, of a patronus message that gave them approximately one hour to prepare, and was still a little vague on whether he would bring Andromeda with him or not. Draco had no way of contacting him to tell him it was a terrible idea or they didn’t have time or he still wasn’t recovered or any of the other hundred excuses he could have used to put Potter off, and perhaps that was Potter’s intention. How clever of him, unfortunately for Draco.
But Madam Stokke pondered his words with the same care she did Ms Coddle’s. “I understand your concerns, Auror Blakely.” She flipped through the parchments until she found the list of names. “Some of these families do bear watching. Many of their parents are in Azkaban, yes?”
“Thanks,” Draco said, patting Harry’s arm, then giving it a little squeeze. Their eyes met and lingered for a few seconds, making Harry’s heart speed up unnecessarily.
. Draco sighed in relief and shoved the useless piece of kindling at Potter before hurrying to meet her.
Harry came awake slowly the next morning, to an empty bed as usual. He peeked his eyes open and smiled at Draco diligently working at his desk in only a loosely tied dressing gown.
“I’ll keep that in mind. Good-bye Harry,” Draco said softly. He hesitated briefly, then pulled Harry in for a last hug.
Draco took his hand and they started walking in the direction of Ron and Hermione. “Wait a minute. So when Ron said he lost that chess game to Victoire because he ‘lost a bet’ — you mean he
How well he remembered nights out with their friends and Harry’s arm around his waist, idly stroking him and teasing the waistband of his trousers. Hopefully they weren’t the same trousers. He wasn’t that slim young man anymore. But no, thankfully Harry had included a regular pair of trousers. Draco rolled his eyes when he discovered Harry had
Theo took the two goblets to the lab to clean just as the wards alerted Draco that someone had arrived in the visitor’s parlour.
Ms Coddle leaned forward conspiratorially and whispered, “Mine isn’t very tidy either. My mummy despairs of me ever learning to make my bed.”
,” he said, pointing at his mouth. “You see how I’m emphasising the ‘s’ sound? That’s because it’s plural. That means there’s more than one.”
He started with a black pair in an all over lace, similar to what Malfoy had been wearing. They had more stretch than he would have thought. He wiggled around, barely able to feel the lightweight fabric at all. He admired the look in the mirror and giggled nervously to himself. What was he doing?
He didn’t know what to make of Draco’s small gasp and his eyes widening in wild excitement. “You don’t mean…” Draco licked his lips. “I never imagined…” His grin leached the tension out of Harry. “Brilliant idea! Absolutely yes! For how long?”
Draco spent the afternoon in the makeshift lab with Theo, working on the Wolfsbane potion for the upcoming October moon. One day, when there weren’t so many people watching his every last move, he’d like to tweak the recipe and see if he could make something more shelf-stable. They’d come up with a few possibilities to test, but couldn’t risk ruining a batch, with aconite in such short supply. Better to go with the recipe they
“Oh definitely.” She rolled her eyes. “Roxy’s interested in a sperm-egg sharing program between us. She’s always wanted a big family. But I think Draco wants to wait a few years, which suits us as well.”
“Sure, as soon as you show up with some chocolate baklava.” Which reminded Harry that there were pastries to be had. He plucked a cream puff from the box and ate it in a single bite. “Mmm, these are delicious!”
But they also didn’t go over a plan for the day. Harry realised that Draco needed to orient his day around Harry and whatever Harry wanted. But now, although he still woke up early and still had breakfast every morning with Harry, he didn’t pick him up at eight and he didn’t ask what they were doing that day.
me and burning everything away until I was nothing but light and fire and melting but in a good way that I never wanted to end, even if I died from it.”
“Well… yes and no,” Draco hedged. “It’s good for them. For the family name. If Harry Potter courts me. Even if there’s no betrothal.”
I have to pretend, in the dark of night, that he can’t see the slow, smooth motion of my hand on my cock.
They celebrated the end of the Charity Commission evaluations on Friday with a large dinner that included Potter, Andromeda, and nearly six month old Teddy. Pickles and Dowdy kept the babies entertained in a play space in the corner of the dining room, while everyone else chatted noisily at the table.
Draco narrowed his eyes at her retreating form, wondering if she’d set up this little late night chat on purpose. Oh well, too late now. Draco sipped his hot chocolate and resigned himself to another hour of Potter’s company.
“Whatever I want,” Draco said with a smirk as he signed the payment slip with a flourish. He smiled at the saleswitch. “I’ll take this with me now,” he said, picking up the bag of small training brooms. “The rest will be delivered this afternoon?”
I know everyone goes nuts about Simon and Baz's first kiss in the forest with the fire. But I much prefer their kisses in Baz's room just after so I wrote about it here!
Harry spelled the dinner dishes to clean themselves then turned to Draco with a smile. “Are you ready for our first fun activity?”
Each punch packed a sharp electric jolt, but made Harry laugh anyway as he rolled away and got to his feet, gasping for breath. “Ron was watching the whole time! It was fine! And now it seems I owe you a life debt. I believe thirty days of service is the traditional method of repayment.”
“I figured as much,” she said with a tight smile. “It’s the hair, you know. What can I help you with?” She sat stiffly in the chair, only smiling at the baby cooing and squirming in her lap.
Draco didn’t know if it was exciting or terrifying. Probably some mix of both. “I changed my mind. I don’t want to catch the snitch. I want to be back on the ground.”
“You took it with you?! Oh Merlin, I’m never going to hear the end of it now. I’m guessing there wasn’t much discussion of ‘The Magic in your Heart’ going on.”
Draco narrowed his eyes at Harry, but it was Ron who spoke first. “I’m just saying you could use more lemons in your life. Or, damn, even some limes to tide you over or something.”
My words cut off as he snogged me hard against the lift doors until the ding of its arrival made us spring back.
.” Harry groaned and dropped his head into the spray. Water cascaded down his back and over his sensitive, stretched rim. “Fuck… I want to be inside you. More than anything. I want it to be me. Fucking you harder and harder and -” He broke off on a moan and slowed his rocking to ease the building burn in his thighs.
Draco still had his Ministry robes on, dusted with floo powder. He winked and Harry felt a familiar fluttering in his belly. “The lab has a private floo, you know.”
His Mind Healer suggested he be more open about it with his friends. That if others knew, then they could help him. “Water always finds its own level, Harry,” Healer Murphy liked to say. “There’s someone out there that wants to help you. But you have to let them know you’re ready for it.”
Harry frowned in confusion as he took the book but didn’t say anything because Draco had already picked up the second saying, “This one is much more fun, if you can look past the mentions of fanny.”
Harry rubbed his sweaty palms on his jeans and accepted one last encouraging nod from Ron. Easy, no big deal… he could do this.
“The War Orphans Foundation. They’re collecting things for the children that lost, you know, everything in the war. Like the clothes from before. This month is toys and Quidditch gear. Next month it’s—“
“I know. But we’ll make it. And we can work out something better for the betrothal contract. Ron said there’s more leeway there.”
“Here goes,” Harry said, tipping the single dose into his mouth. He closed his eyes and his face flushed lightly. When he opened his eyes again, they shone brightly with manic glee. “You know what we should do?”
He knew that Draco would. If Harry really wanted to, Draco would go with him and they could spend the whole day together. But Draco never missed lessons and Harry couldn’t ask him to.
Seeing Harry on the floor, Draco laughed as he came in. “Having a bit of trouble there? Where is your wand?”
“All right, all right. No need to get so defensive. I just… remember you were… that day I saw you at the grocer’s. You seemed out of it then too.”
In the span of only a few chapters, Jocelyn went from scrubbing pots without magic in a dowdy uniform, to dusting Benedict’s library without magic in only a chemise, to crawling naked across his office to blow him against his desk. Benedict kindly charmed the rug extra plush for that one.
They sipped at their drinks and made fun of the couples forming and reforming on the dance floor. It didn’t take long for them to unanimously and silently decide this was no longer their scene. Abandoning their mostly finished drinks at the bar, they exited the club for the quiet of the London streets.
“What about you?” Ginny asked, leaning forward and smiling freely. She really did have a nice smile. “What do you do?”
And yet, neither of them are about father's day. Happy Father's Day to all the dads worth celebrating!
Draco imagined it for a moment—on his back, watching the play of Harry’s muscles as he worked into Draco. His hands buried in Harry’s messy curls, his feet digging into Harry’s arse. All right, he could see how that might be sexy.
Young, beautiful, helpless. Draco didn’t want to think about what could have happened if he hadn’t found them.
The whole point of dating a bloke was to see if Harry really liked it as much as he thought he might and that meant kissing said bloke at some point. Might as well be now, with Draco so obviously wanting the same thing. Or at least that was his second brain’s thinking and his first brain had no rebuttal against it.
And then Harry wondered if he merely wanted to fuck with them. Every time he leaned forward to speak to Draco, Theo also leaned forward. So Harry leaned back to talk around him and then Theo leaned back. Harry rolled his eyes and decided it would be easiest to talk to Neville and Ron for the rest of dinner, and just talk with Draco later.
Ms Coddle glanced around, and declined a trip to the carriage house, greenhouses, empty stables, and summerhouses around the property. A tour of all the outbuildings could take an entire day. Auror Blakely seemed disappointed, and Draco wondered if he meant to use the unseen buildings as his next line of attack.
“Fuck no,” Draco burst out with his own blush. “I mean… go on if you like. Just…” He closed his eyes. “Merlin, that’s so fucking hot. But I can’t watch or I won’t be able to finish. Playing! Finish playing the song.
“It’s not ready yet! You were supposed to wait a little more!” At Draco’s dismissive sound, Harry continued, “I modified that nightlight that Teddy had, so it would look vaguely underwater in here. Does it?”
Ron broke out in loud laughter, elbowing Ginny hard enough to knock her into Angelina sitting next to her. “Draco!” Ron giggled, wiping non-existent tears. “That would be perfect. Definitely invite Harry over for key lime pie.”
Draco could see on his face the same worry that someone would go through their rubbish bins and discover the load of rejected sex toys. Even if no one had ever gone through their rubbish bins before.
robes. His solicitor’s brilliant idea—to wear the robes he was arrested in instead of prison clothes. It worked. Draco looked utterly pathetic, unwashed and in robes that called to mind his youthfulness. Even if they hung off his wasted frame. How did a person lose so much weight in so short a time?
Potter suggested that, as it was supposed to rain for the next two days, they should play outside so they gathered in the garden after eating. “Want to be on my team?” he asked Draco, grinning widely as he tossed the football from hand to hand.
“I see. About your… staff.” She hesitated a hair too long, but Draco refused to be cowed by her obvious dismissal of their youthfulness. “What sort of training have they received in childcare?”
“Not that kind of calm. Come on, let’s go sit down.” Harry sipped his tea and led Draco to their sitting room. They sat together on the sofa, with Harry sitting sideways to face him. “Today’s task is Legilimency.”
Malfoy dug through a filing cabinet until he found a small bag. He unshrunk the contents to reveal a new set of robes. He sighed in relief and spelled open his robes, which Harry saw were soiled, and tossed them to the floor. Malfoy shook his head and growled, “Fucking Parkinson!”
Harry missed half the conversation but caught with alarm on Draco saying, “I think I still have that book in my room. You’re welcome to borrow it.” Harry had to dig his fingers into Draco’s waist to keep him getting up and revealing Harry’s predicament to everyone. Thankfully Draco settled back against his chest. “I’ll get it later though. I’m far too comfortable here.” He toasted Ron with his teacup and took a sip.
“We have—” his eyes darted to Potter, but they were past the point of questioning trust now. “There are two werewolf children, and if the Ministry found out—”
Harry had planned this date to capture as much of their first date as he could. They started with dinner at a tiny Indian place, still run by the same aged witch with a welcoming smile for everyone.
“As much as it pains me, it’s time we admit you make Draco happy.” She gave him the box, then turned her back to him. Harry fumbled the necklace out of the box and set it around her neck. “And if it’s marriage or continuing to put his life in danger… I suppose we’ll have to take marriage.” She patted her hair and the necklace, and turned to him with a tight smile. “Don’t fuck this up, Mr Potter.”
“It’s okay, love, we’ll be all right.” He could hardly stand her arms around him, pressing against the filthy, reeking mass of him. But she didn’t seem to care. He ran a hand down her back and held her as tightly as his weak arms would allow.
It didn’t help that Draco gave him a wicked smile. “Oh Harry, don’t you know I think of you every time I play?”
He thought about the practicalities of it, one of them splayed out on the bed exposed and at the others mercy. It wasn’t that they didn’t trust each other enough, it was more that he wanted to be able to reach for Harry at will.
Harry Potter’s testimony reduced Narcissa’s sentence to eight years, and Lucius got the standard ten years. But Draco…
That was the one that stumped Draco the most. He’d heard enough gossip just walking through Diagon, about Ollivander’s illness and his niece running the shop. The Muggleborn registration had done a number on the wands in the magical world, snapping them left and right. Although the shop had boxes and boxes stacked to the rafters, the supply struggled to meet demand. Matching a wand to an owner required delicate care and knowledge. How would a bunch of Death Eater children get that? Could he risk bringing the children to Diagon with him to make that match?
Harry’s sparkling laugh lightened Draco’s heart. “I want to know what all the fuss is about when I pinch your nipples.”
“I know,” Ron said with a grin, leading Harry out. “Because that’s how you roll and that’s how we got in this mess in the first place.”
Hermione Granger? No, she’d labelled her note about making a difference in the world and that handwriting looked far more cramped than this one.
He hated the view from so many centimetres down. He hated how his centre of gravity was all off. He hated the coiled tension that made him want to spring into action for no good reason.
By the time the game finished—which Harry let Draco win—Harry’s heart clamoured painfully in his chest from all the buzzed contact with Draco. It would probably take hours to calm down enough to sleep. But Draco was laughing when he left and that was all he cared about.
“We’re about the same size. I’m sure they’d fit you. Maybe hit you mid-thigh, since you’re shorter than me.” He wanted to swallow his tongue. Why did he have to go mentioning
Theo’s back straightened a little. “Yes,” he said slowly as he considered it. “Right, because usually it would just be the occasional outing or dinner and this… This is definitely more than one person can handle.”
“I thought you would help a bunch of kids with nowhere else to go.” Potter met her eyes and something passed between them. “Draco’s drawn in loads of kids that were kicked out or escaped unsavoury homes. They have nowhere else to go and he welcomed them.”
Draco slowly licked Harry’s cock from base to tip. Harry’s moan escalated, ending on a heavy whoosh of an exhale when Draco sucked lightly at the tip. “Yeah,” Harry said hoarsely, “actually I’m not so surprised.” His ragged breath came faster. “Open up. Tilt your head back. Yes… just like that.”
“Don’t swear in front of the kids,” Potter responded automatically. “And I am. I just haven’t yet.” He scrubbed at his hair and sighed. “I don’t want to talk about it. Where’s my paintbrush?”
“I’d actually gathered that from the name. You want to play along?” Draco arched a brow at Harry. “Don’t you think we’re a little too old to be bothering with kinky shit? I’m afraid those years are behind us, my love.” He patted Harry’s hand and took a bite of scrambled eggs. Fluffy and cheesy, just as he preferred.
“Yeah Molly keeps insisting I go home with Ron, but it’ll be quieter and more restful here. The Weasleys can be a lot to take in when they’re all together.” He rubbed his hands on his jeans again. “Yeah so, listen…” Harry cleared his throat. “I was wondering if you wanted to… Maybe you wanted to go to Hogsmeade with me tomorrow.”
He giggled to himself and smoothed down his wrinkled robes. Perfect. He took a pinch of floo powder—hmm… better purchase that as well—and rolled through to Diagon Alley. The Calming Draught immediately served its purpose when it made Draco nod politely at a young witch that came through the floo before him. No panic today!
Draco grinned and gave Harry a slow, lingering kiss that only heated the desire simmering in Harry’s core.
Draco’s lips twitched against a smile and he stepped closer to Harry. “I’m sorry for your loss, Harry,” he said softly.
“Yeah, see… I don’t think we are…” Harry darted away from another swat. “But next time I’ll give you fair warning.” He picked his Cloak up off the floor and shook it out. He set it on his shoulders, making half his body disappear. “Can you help me get out of the shop? Maybe step outside and look down Diagon Alley for no reason?”
“I thought you’d be happier. Twenty-four hours isn’t really so long. And you and Harry will probably be able to go home soon.”
“All right, that’s about what we guessed as well.” She handed him a scroll. “This has some aftercare instructions. Some things to look out for. Mainly the return of the rash, and any difficulty breathing. He’ll probably eat lightly over the next twenty-four hours, but his normal appetite will come back after that.”
“No,” Jane said flatly. “We’ll be leaving as soon as he’s awake. It’s not safe here. Not really.” She tipped her chin at the others gathered behind Draco.
He palmed Harry’s aching cock over his jeans, providing pressure and friction to send Harry tumbling over the edge with a hoarse cry. Through the last of the trembling aftershocks, Harry kissed Draco and traced lightly over his shoulders and down his back. He floated like a feather through a post-orgasm haze, distantly aware that Draco didn’t come.
Harry flashed a wicked grin that sent a flash of heat through Draco’s body and he knew he was already done for. “Oh you most definitely will.”
As if Draco knew how to live a life without worry any longer. Still, they celebrated the way they usually did, with ice cream and too many fizzy drinks for so late in the day. Theo’s study of wards over the last few weeks taught him how to shield a room from magic entirely. They managed to set up a telly and VCR Draco bought at
And he didn’t stop. Not when Harry traced his inner thighs again. And when he ran a finger up Draco’s length. Not when Harry laid his head on Draco’s thigh, although he seemed to have trouble drawing in an even breath. Each sour note and tiny screech of the bow only made Harry more bold as Draco struggled to continue on under the sweet torture of light caresses and tiny kisses across his tender skin.
On Monday night, their last before their friends returned, Harry couldn’t resist sticking his hand in his pyjama bottoms and lightly stroking his cock as the strains of song filled the room and woke the
This might be the greatest day of Harry’s life, which all things considered didn’t have loads of competition, but still… Kissing Draco felt like a dream come true, especially when he ground down against Harry with a matching erection. Their movements became more synchronised as they learned the curves of lips and tongue, when to bite and when to lick. All of it made Harry dizzier with joy and arousal than he’d ever experienced.
Hard sobs tore through him as he thought of every beautiful thing he’d shared with Draco over the last two weeks. Had Draco wanted any of it? At least some of it? There were times when… Sometimes he ran his fingers through Harry’s hair, or traced over his lips. Surely he wanted that, if Harry hadn’t asked for it and he gave it anyway.
She blew raspberries, but Draco pulled out his phone and tapped at the calendar. “That sounds like fun. I’ll text you Sunday morning to get the details.” He gave Harry a half-smile. “I can bring key lime pie.”
“Really? All right.” Draco shrugged and led Harry back to the common room. They saw Theo at one of the tables, and Draco excused himself to go whisper something to him. Theo frowned at Harry, but then nodded. Draco took Harry by the hand. “Theo won’t bother us for a while.”
They both giggled and Harry licked at a bright red spot on Draco’s neck. “I love you fucked into incoherence.”
Several heads turned at the mention of sprinkles, but Draco cut them off with, “Just plain cones for everyone.”
“O-oh, well,” Harry glanced at Ginny’s tightly drawn lips, and decided to follow Pansy’s lead. That was much safer than dwelling on a story he definitely didn’t want to tell. “You know, children experience loss too, so… Molly’s experience prepares them in some way. Plus, I had to throw out
Harry, however, was a nervous wreck. He kept darting glances between Ron and Draco and wringing his hands. Ron’s body looked ridiculous, with such mincing gestures. When Draco patted Ron on the arm and then made a few notes in the chart, Harry mouthed, “
“Annie and Libby made me change it to a hideous shade of yellow.” Draco accidentally squeezed Harry’s fingers. Was this really happening?
The suggestion surprised Draco. Usually when they went out for breakfast, they went down the road to the local café. They hadn’t been to Incredible Edibles in ages. Long enough that Draco had nearly forgotten the adorable café with more plants than a Hogwarts greenhouse and the best French toast Draco had ever had.
Harry laughed at the nickname he’d been given at the start of their odd wrong-number friendship. “They’re with me,” he said to Fergus. As Fergus went to fill their order, Harry said, “He and Seamus—you remember Seamus Finnigan? They own the pub, and give us a little discount on Fridays.”
But Draco didn’t know how to get on in a world where he and Potter were friends. So much had been dumped on him since the Ministry let him walk away all those months ago. He knew that he owed his freedom, his money, his home, his everything to Harry Potter. But right now, while he struggled to find solid footing in an ever-shifting landscape, he couldn’t imagine the shape their friendship would take. It seemed like a selfish luxury when Draco was still trying to get the basics of living settled down for all the dependents in his life.
“Plotting? Do you think this is some childish form of revenge?” Draco slammed the gate wide open, just to hear the clanging of metal on metal. “Their fucking
“Got it in one!” Harry said, also looking around. “Come on, I think we can get into the passenger carriages easily enough.”
She flipped through the book with a sullen eye roll, but agreed to his terms. A warm bed and a full belly had tamed the little wolf considerably. Especially with winter right around the corner.
Who could he even find that the Ministry would trust? Everyone he knew was in Azkaban or muggle. Why did this whole fucking world have to knock him back over and over again? Where could he find any help at all when he hadn’t found any help thus far?
could flirt a little,” he said to Draco, cursing the heat sliding up his body that must mean his ears were reddening.
Draco ducked his head but not enough that Harry could reach him to kiss. “I might like this game,” he whispered.
That grandmother’s story warmed Harry whenever he fell into doubt about his current projects, and he never stopped to wonder why. But now he knew. She
“We’re never going to fuck in this bed, are we?” Baz whines, helping me to neaten my clothing before anyone finds us.
He set Annie on his hip with a grin and a kiss to her plump cheek. This was his life now, and he loved it.
“Yes,” Draco hissed, undoing a few buttons and pulling his shirt over his head. “Yes.” He shimmied out of his pyjama bottoms and knelt on the bed, his cock red and hard and ready for whatever wickedness Harry had in mind.
She followed Draco on a small tour of the rooms, marvelling at the toys and childish artwork everywhere. “Your mother placed great stock in all the trappings of wealth,” Andromeda said, her eyes scanning the parlour’s shelves, now empty of priceless heirlooms and breakable knick-knacks. “I wonder what she would think about this.”
“Oh I don’t read as much as Harry does, but he passes on the really good ones.” He waggled his eyebrows playfully. “Perhaps he’s thinking we might have a real life friends-to-lo—”
Draco’s thoughts began to leach away as Harry’s hands trailed over his skin. “Oh shit, for real? I thought I was hiding my lascivious nature rather well.”
Although Draco had plenty of robes of his own, he also wore the muggle clothing occasionally in support of the other children. He would never admit it, but he loved the way the denim felt against his legs. Nor would he ever admit that tracksuit bottoms weren’t terribly different from his Quidditch practice gear and made chasing small children easier.
Orion looked at his slice of cake with entirely too much gleeful recognition, but Draco didn’t scold his friends for it. Their little boy deserved sweet treats. Idly he wondered how far off they were from Orion’s real birthday. Somewhere, was his mother thinking of him? Would they ever meet her? And what would she think of how they’d raised him? Would she ever want to take him back? Draco shook off morose thoughts of losing his sweet baby and accepted a piece of cake from Daphne.
The timing couldn’t be worse. Draco stayed up all night Sunday with Jane and Robbie for the full moon. He spent the wee hour of the morning patching Robbie up. This month’s dose had been reduced too much and the wolf had far too much control. The few mild injuries healed well enough, but Draco didn’t want either of them to suffer any more than they had to. They made note of his injuries and would try a higher dosage for next month.
Under the soft lumos of their bedroom, Harry held Draco in a thrall nearly as tangible as a real vampire would. Draco couldn’t look away and his body heated with every touch. Every so often Harry’s teeth would catch the light and Draco moaned anew at the sexy sight. When Harry, buried deep inside of Draco, traced his tongue along the bottom edge of each sharp point, Draco lost the plot completely. His body would have shattered into a million pieces but for the strong circle of Harry’s arms holding him together.
return? Would they even be in a fit state to take their children back? Did they have homes or incomes to return to?
“Good times,” Harry responded with as much calm as he could muster. The cycle always seemed to begin this way—with a reminder that they once had something special. He remembered their shared excitement over the first run of Molly Meow stuffed animals, and the picture of him in this hoodie with Molly. But after a week of texting Draco, he also remembered Ginny’s impatience with the pictures Harry continued taking for his blog, urging him to leave off and come to dinner instead.
Pure lust shot through Harry as he stepped into the shower, closing the curtain behind him. Lightly he caressed the length of silicone, practically drooling at the thought of Draco fucking himself on it. He could easily picture it - Draco with his head tossed back, stroking his cock as he rocked back and forth.
Andromeda squeezed his arm. “I could never regret helping you, Harry. And Dora would never forgive me if I failed those children.” She smoothed a hand down her robe. She shot a charm to freshen the fabric and vanish a drool spot on her shoulder. “If we’re short on time, we’d best hurry.”
“That is... really putting the cart before the horse. You haven’t even kissed me yet. Haven’t told your friends you’re gay—”
“When do you think they’ll send word about your paperwork?” Potter asked, taking the chair closest to Draco. His legs splayed out in front of him so that his boot rested against Draco’s.
at it! Draco stomped off in the opposite direction, even if that meant taking the roundabout route to his office. Because he had letters to write! Real work to do! He couldn’t waste his afternoon with a pretty boy that wanted to play
More horrible, industrial soap for Harry’s body. And all right, Draco really did enjoy this part. And not just because he got to be the one in the spray of water. He also got to run the soapy flannel across Harry’s firm chest, down the ridges of his sculpted abs, and around the hard cock pointing right at Draco. Harry moaned and rolled his hips gently through the circle of Draco’s fist and nipped lightly at Draco’s earlobe.
Jemma pulled her foot back to kick the ball back into play, then froze in horror just as Pansy called out in a tight voice, “Draco! We have a visitor.”
had Annie whimpering and hugging him tightly again. He kissed the top of her head and rubbed her back. “
It would be so easy to give in to the temptation. He could lace their fingers together. Tug Potter in for a kiss. Invite Potter for a moonlight stroll through the garden. Or to stay overnight.
“I always loved this one,” Ginny said with a playful smile. “I still have that picture of you with your first Molly Meow soft toy.”
“I—erm—it’s just the alcohol talking,” he said sheepishly, hating the rush of heat in his cheeks as their friends smothered their laughter. “Butterbeer has alcohol and it’s just—the butterbeer talking!”
He didn’t want to put it off any longer, not when he was the only one that hadn’t added to their board. And now, during the raucous eighth year party on New Year’s Eve, it seemed his time had come.
“I already miss our cosy bed.” Draco set his cardigan on an empty seat and began unbuttoning his robes. “On your knees then, Potter,” he said in an imperious voice.
“It’s a Weasley Wheeze from George! And look,” Harry said, waving around a small piece of cardstock, “I got you the limited edition Harry Potter one with a tiny, tiny lightning bolt scar and glasses!”
Their number quickly swelled from ten to eighteen by the end of June. The dizzying changes kept them from the alcoholic bliss Draco had come to depend on. He ran out of Calming Draught and didn’t know how to get more without alerting Pansy. Her mother’s addiction made her hyper aware of Draco’s dosing habits.
Harry rolled his eyes. “I’ll survive,” he deadpanned. “Then what?” He found his pyjamas and started dressing for bed.
“Fuck, I’m so sorry,” he said, trying to pull away. Reluctantly, Draco let him go. Potter wiped his face clean, even though his breath hitched a few times and it looked like tears might start again.
enough for Draco to abandon their picnic dinner. But he knew Harry had pastries hidden somewhere and at this stage in his life, he could certainly have his cake and eat it too.
He wrote letter after letter, as he did every Sunday evening, so that all of his charges at Hogwarts would get a delivery on Monday morning. He tied the bundle to Horatio’s leg and sent the eagle owl flying off. Just in time for dinner.
“Not quite. I turned mine into a portkey but I wanted you to wear yours too.” Harry wrapped Draco’s old Slytherin scarf loosely around his neck. “It fits the theme. Are you ready?”
“Be friends?” Harry asked. “You said you couldn’t date me. If it’s courtship or nothing, I’ll take courtship. Unless…” Harry bit his lip. “Was it all a lie and you don’t want me?”
shower at home and the rubbery floor layered in cushioning charms. At least it wouldn’t last long - he could probably finish Harry off in less than five minutes.
Harry laughed but had the good sense not to yell something ridiculous down the pavement at his two friends. Draco pulled his fingers out of Harry’s jeans and whispered, “Do you have a plan for when the secret inevitably gets out?”
Confusion clouded Harry’s thinking. Wouldn’t that remind Draco even more of that day? Harry could easily picture them together, flying over the quidditch pitch with Draco’s arms around him, pressed up against his back, just as he had been that day. He had to admit it made his mouth water, thinking about the warmth they would share, and maybe the soft sighs of excitement from Draco as they circled the pitch without the threat of death hanging over them.
Daphne’s story became a common refrain. “The Ministry has seized our accounts until the trials are over. And there’s paperwork to be done. They said I was of age and could just get a job to tide us over. But no one’s hiring and the ones that are don’t want possible Death Eater sympathizers.”
“No,” Harry said slowly. “I mean, yeah, this sucks. But I think we needed it. It’s like a great reset on everything.”
Every trace of sympathy and humour swept out of Ron in an instant. “I swear if your body reacts like that when we see my wife, I’m going to lose my fucking shit and you’re going to be lucky we’re already in a hospital.”
“We already know each other after months and months of sharing classes and a common room. And ugh, time alone is so hard to come by in this stupid school. Can’t we fool around now and chat later?”
“Good idea.” Hermione scrunched her nose up, clearly displeased with the thought of taking one of them home. “This is just bizarre!” She wished them both luck and left for the Burrow to pick up Rose.
“I could make you come,” Draco whispered, sending another bolt of lust through Harry. He tilted Harry’s head back to rub their noses together with a playful smile. “Just tell me to and I will.” He dropped two, three kisses against the corners of Harry’s mouth.
“I’m not sure my editor will run with a name like Draco, but it’s worth a try.” He hesitated a moment, unsure if he should continue. “I wasn’t sure about drawing a deer. I thought it might hurt but… it’s nice.” When Draco frowned in confusion, Harry said, “It’s my—It reminds me of my dad. The stag, you know. It’s still my patronus and it reminds me of him.”
shrivelfig that we can both share a single cup of. That should be enough for some giggly fun but still leave us functional for work tomorrow.”
“Hmm… There’s the boarded up rooms at the end of the second floor west wing. They could become another set of bedrooms. Okay. Let’s talk it over with Andromeda—her opinion is always valuable—and see what we can manage. But tomorrow. Today is already full.”
“Photos. Both our wedding album and the one of my parents. Those are the only things we can’t replace. You?”
Until then, Harry enjoyed his quiet privacy with Draco. He loved the way their bodies entwined so perfectly, and the thrill of Draco’s hands travelling over his heated skin. He loved curling up with Draco afterwards and trading light kisses. He loved the even cadence of Draco’s voice as he told Harry silly stories that made them both laugh. He loved when Draco carded fingers through his hair and told him he was beautiful. He loved Draco playing his violin to calm Harry before bed.
Harry shrugged and popped a few buttery kernels in his mouth. “Just what I heard. I guess we’ll find out soon enough.”
“Potter,” he said, restraining an eye roll. “I’d say it’s a surprise to see you, but it’s really not.”
Whether Harry went on with his shower and left everything as it was, or removed the dildo from the wall and stowed it away somewhere, Draco would know that Harry had seen it. He might get embarrassed. Actually, he would
Draco threw his hands up, “Well there’s a huge fucking surprise! So what, you’re just going to be here all the time?”
. Not because of the war. And not because a local bookstore or pre-school had him do a reading. Just every day, out and about, she saw him as the source of a fond memory she had of her granddaughter. And it was special even if Ginny couldn’t see it.
Harry put his head under the spray, once again pushing Draco out of it and into the plastic wall of the shower. He smothered a shriek. “Be careful! These walls are freezing!” At home, the tiles were charmed to start warming when the water ran, so that one could comfortably rest if one was, say for example, being fucked into oblivion against the wall.
They kept anything that had fond memories, or sparked any real pleasure, even if it hadn’t been used in a while. Draco cleaned each piece they kept before setting it in the box.
The next time he looked up, he found Draco grinning at him. “That doesn’t look like work. Looks like number four, easily distracted.”
Draco used his mouth in other ways, sucking a line of kisses down Harry’s jaw and whispering about the delicious heat of Harry’s mouth on his cock and how Harry would experience it soon enough for himself. That thought alone had Harry spilling over Draco’s fingers with a loud moan. He slumped against Draco’s shoulder and smiled when Draco’s arm came around him.
“Well, I’m nervous.” Draco twisted his hands in his sleeves before giving up and pulling Harry even closer for a hug. “I didn’t get through my first week or so without a heavy amount of alcohol.”
“Unsavoury homes… you mean Death Eater homes?” She laughed mirthlessly. “Oh Harry, you do know how to stretch the bonds of friendship.”
Draco set the ridiculous toy by the side of the tub and pulled his pants off. “Fine, but it’s going up your arse.”
Draco’s small giggle made Harry giggle as well and before he knew it, they both had tears of laughter running down their faces.
“Fine.” Harry pursed his lips. “I want to feel what you feel. So I want you to touch me in all the ways you like best.”
Harry waggled his eyebrows in a way Draco should not find attractive and said, “So we can have a wizard’s duel, of course.” He summoned their favourite lube with a grin, “First one to shoot white sparks from their wand loses.”
.” Both their wands smacked his palm, and he dropped one at random to use the other to clean them up.
Harry shivered as soon as he stepped out the back door. Perhaps Draco should offer his cardigan to his shirtless husband but Harry did it to himself and could suffer the consequences.
“Thanks for inviting us,” Pansy said, linking her elbow with Draco’s. “We’ll have to do it again sometime.”
Ms Coddle and her assistant Dispparated immediately. Auror Blakely made a great show of putting his Auror robes back on. If he hoped Granger and Potter would Disapparate without him, he was sadly mistaken. They didn’t even attempt an excuse, just stood off to the side watching him button his uniform. Unable to delay any longer, he Disapparated with a crack. Granger smirked at Potter and followed.
“Sorry, mate…” Blaise’s grin looked entirely too cheerful. “Even if I said I didn’t hear it, you know Theo’s going to blab about it.”
Ginny finally lost her stiff posture, melting into something resembling concern. “Oh no! The purple orchid?”
“Me too.” Draco glanced over his shoulder at the pub, as if he might say more about Ginny, but then let it drop. “It was good to see you, Harry.”
“You don’t know that.” Harry wanted to reach for Draco’s hand but was afraid with Narcissa Malfoy watching so closely, even if she couldn’t hear them. “I’m Harry Potter, you know. It would be very advantageous to allow a union between us.”
Feeling more confident, Harry let himself imagine a relationship with Malfoy. It had been a long time since Harry had anyone to call his own. Too many were scared away by the weekly Potter Watch column. It was too hard to open himself up to anyone, but with this secret they both shared… Maybe he stood a chance.
,” Harry whined back, “and you said we’d have lots of hotel sex. Come on.” He stood and knocked Draco playfully on the knee. “Blow me in the shower and I’ll rim you 'til you cry.”
Draco waggled his eyebrows. “Is that so.” He pulled his jumper off, revealing a thin white t-shirt. “How about this?” He arched his back and made a kissy face. “Should I drink suggestively from the butterbeer bottle?”
He almost gave in after dinner, when Draco hinted his room would be empty while Theo was at chess club. But he didn’t want to tempt them into moving faster than they were really ready for. It had only been a day since they got together, he reminded himself for the hundredth time. They had to pace themselves.
“Fuck, please move faster so we can get out of this red and gold monstrosity,” Draco whined, shutting his eyes tight against the hideous
The children dispersed to their seats at the dining room table. After the older kids left for Hogwarts, Draco shrunk the table to better accommodate their smaller number, but there should still be room enough for one more.  He took his place at the head of the table, and Potter moved directly to his right.
Harry snorted when he came in with a large bowl of popcorn in hand and two mugs of tea floating beside him. “I was just thinking about this film! I read in
With an inward groan, Harry smiled and lifted his ice cream in greeting. Draco crossed the shop and sat with him, smiling hesitantly. Although he’d missed Draco this last week or so, he’d hoped to have a little more time to come to terms with their abrupt break-up before seeing him again.
Pansy cackled and pulled her phone from her pocket. “Unfortunately I’ve got work that weekend but...” She tapped rapidly at the screen. “Just in case, here...” Pansy handed the phone to Harry, displaying a ‘new contact’ screen. “Why don’t you put your number in for me? I don’t want to have to steal it from Draco later.”
Harry walked by the eighth years’ bulletin board again, but only because he couldn’t seem to keep away from it. The same fluttering square of parchment with the delicate scrolling cursive enthralled him and kept him from moving away. Again.
Draco rolled his eyes. His thoughts floated through various scenarios, and his words formed slowly. “I think I like morning sex when we’ve got nowhere to go. I don’t like disrupting my weekday morning routine. I like sex before bed best because it’s a nice, relaxing way to end the day. What do you think?”
“No, you berk, it’s comforting and warm and I like it.” Draco pulled the sample size vial from his pocket. “And I brought us something from the shop.”
“I have three t-shirts,” he blurted out. Then his tongue hurried on without consulting his brain. “I bought a pack of undershirts during a muggle studies outing. They’re thin and boring and white.”
Harry drained the last of his tea and set the mug aside. “A pensieve is cold and flat. And again, you have these same memories. This is more about feeling what I feel. With you.”
“It disguises the fact that my life is woefully lacking in lemons. Here, have your slice of pie. It’s to die for.” He handed Harry one of the smaller boxes and used his wand to conjure a fork.
“One day when we’re ready for it,” Harry said, “I want to fuck you just like this. I want to feel you around my cock, all slick and hot and tight…”
“Fuck, Harry, you should see yourself. I can’t believe this is real.” Draco wrapped his hand firmly around his cock and started to pull faster. “I’m right on the edge. I’m so close Harry. Tell me you’re close. Tell me you want it.”
Draco sighed heavily and left the rest of the children to Pansy and Theo as he stood. He rubbed his face wearily. “As usual, it’s none of your business. But as we are in public and I can’t stop you following us… We’re going out for ice cream to cheer everyone up. We’re attaching the children to the rope so they don’t accidentally let go and wander into traffic. All right? Interrogation over?”
“Are you spying for the Ministry?” Chester asked. Beside him, Pansy stiffened and darted a panicked look at Draco. “Draco says we should—”
“I always have fun with you.” Draco kissed the back of Harry’s head. His thoughts wandered around the day's events and briefly landed on Blaise and Pansy. “I wonder why Pansy chose vampires. Blaise is terrified of vampires.”
Harry huffed a laugh into Draco’s neck and then came with a soft groan of his own. “Yes, fuck, that’s so good…” He slumped against Draco for a moment. “We should add fucking in my workshop to this game. But it doesn’t have the same appeal since it’s just in the back garden and no one is around to almost catch us.”
“We’ve got a good twenty or thirty minutes before they get home,” Baz moans against my lips as he reaches for my belt again. “Please… you know I’ve wanted to fuck you in this bed since that first time we kissed here…”
When the path opened up to a small clearing with a gnarly tree that looked perfect for climbing, Harry decided the spot was good as any for sketching. He spread out a blanket and pulled two butterbeers and a box of homemade biscuits from his bag. Draco joined him, adding three bakery boxes to the snack pile.
He conjured a few useless, decorative bottles to arrange around the bathroom sink where Draco’s toiletries used to sit.
“Okay Robbie,” Draco said, even though he didn’t think the boy could hear him. “I’m going to take a look at your arm.” He eased the muddy cloak off the boy’s shoulder and found a shredded robe underneath soaked in blood. And three large slashes crossed his upper arm and chest. “Huh,” Draco said in surprise. “That almost looks like…”
“Hello, we’ve got a large group here today,” Draco said with a smile, gesturing at the boisterous children. “They’ll eat literally anything so could we have a variety of ice cream cones? Any flavours at all will do.”
“I would, you know…” Draco set his teacup on the coffee table and scooted closer to Harry, resting a hand on his inner thigh. “I would let you tie me up if it’s something you wanted to try. Or tie you up?”
Draco gestured vaguely at his desk. “I’m going to finish up some notes for my potions project and then turn in early.”
Draco made a non-committal sound and hugged Harry closer. “Well, I certainly enjoyed it. Perhaps my favourite so far.”
Thank fuck. Harry moaned as he gripped Draco’s hips, fucking earnestly at long last. “Is this what you want?” he huffed into the sweaty skin of Draco’s neck. “Just like this? So you can come all over the glass.”
“Well she knew I was gay already, which I thought was good. And actually, she thought that was a point in my favour as she has a girlfriend of her own.” Draco sat back to let Harry absorb that for a moment.
“Ooh, I’ll poke myself with a pin so I can fake some tears when I’m rejected! And I’ll be sure to hire a photographer to capture their horrified faces so we can remember the moment forever.”
the wards. But don’t worry, I won’t tell anyone,” he added with a wink. “I’m good with secrets.” He took another sip of his beer, watching the blush cover Harry’s face. Malfoy laughed and shook his head, “Thanks, Potter, but I don’t need another beer.”
Harry stuck his tongue out, but of course Draco was still too far away to reach. But only just. Closer, closer…
Pansy’s grimace had deepened as more and more ice cream melted and dripped and smeared over everything. Greg bounced Chester in his lap, making the little boy giggle as he tried to eat his ice cream through the jiggling. Daphne gave Orion a small lick of Lizzie’s vanilla cone, then blushed and shrugged when Draco glared at her over it. Draco had to roll his eyes—he wasn’t naive enough to think that was Orion’s first little treat.
Weasley’s scowl morphed into confusion as the Patronus dissolved. “I’ll be damned. He’s actually coming to help
“You are insatiable!” Harry laughed. “Don’t you want to… I don’t know… get to know each other better? Isn’t it moving a little fast to get naked together so soon?”
Harry didn’t mind Ron and Hermione running a little late for their double date. It gave him a few extra minutes to enjoy Draco nuzzling his neck and teasing the lacy waistband of his knickers.
Draco was a complete and utter fool for miniature foods, and Harry knew it. Either it fitted the theme that Draco couldn’t discern yet, or else Harry wanted to butter him up for a ridiculous request. Draco took a sip of his wine and then ate a cube of sharp white cheddar, already knowing he’d say yes.
He wondered what Draco was reading and if it would be rude to interrupt him at this point to ask. He looked so adorable, sitting back against the tree. Harry opened his sketchbook to a fresh page and quickly drew a rough outline of Draco, then began filling in tiny details. His brows drawn down in concentration, the pursing of his mouth, the lock of hair dancing in the breeze.
Harry moaned in protest, “But I love it when you’re all dirty.” Then his face lit up. “Come shower with me. We can clean up together.”
? The issue of kids could be worked out later. And he could give Draco space for a day or two. Surely Lucius and Narcissa wouldn’t wait too long to accept.
Harry must have seen the concern on his face because he squeezed Draco’s hand and gave him a reassuring smile. “It’s nothing dire. You know how my mind races sometimes, and I need something to calm it down today.”
Looking up at Daphne, who nodded reassuringly, Daria took Ms Coddle’s hand. “Draco gave me a black bear that he said could be my very own, but sometimes I let Libby play with it.”
Pickles watched avidly as Astoria came over with the baby. Orion squealed and batted his hands at the large Elf ears. Biting his lip, Pickles turned bulging eyes on Draco. Slowly he nodded and reached a trembling hand for the sock. His long fingers gripped it tight as he shivered and blinked rapidly.
“I don’t know, but I’m so tense I’m about to crack in two.” She held her hand out to Daria for one last flower. “And done! What do we think?”
For all his pent up energy, Harry moved slower than Draco anticipated. He took his time getting Draco hard and lowering himself oh so carefully with a deep groan.
think of Malfoy that way. After Malfoy brushed off Harry’s subtle attempts at flirtation, he decided he didn’t need more than their nod-in-passing relationship. Especially with some odd duck that wore ladies’ knickers. Hot pink ones, no less.
That evening, the baby was named Orion and happily passed around to all the waiting arms. He seemed more interested in the new faces than he did with the bottle of formula he was offered. Draco had bought a variety of outfits for him to wear, and the six to nine month size fitted him best.
But if this is madness, I think as I slide my hand (yet again) into my pyjama bottoms, I’ll take it.
“They asked about your guests. How long they’d been there. Was it only children? Was I—was I ever worried for their safety or my own?”
his fingers caress the gate and, without hesitation, it swings open. Simon’s grin is blinding as the school welcomes him home.
For the next thirty minutes, they circled each other, throwing out childish and boring spells at one another. It occurred to Draco that the spells they learned in school would come in handy, but who had used any of those in ages? These days it was mostly warming charms on his tea and summoning things he was too lazy to get up for. The battle-readiness of their late teenage years fled them over a decade ago.
“Yes,” Draco was forced to admit, “but we’re trying to look past that to the innocent children they’ve left behind. We’ve seen to it the older ones have returned to Hogwarts to finish their education, and given them a safe place to return during the holiday. Afterwards, we can help them find jobs and a new place to live. A future. What can the Ministry offer them?”
“Oh Draco, he’s a smart boy. He can figure it out.” She stood and stretched. “Or at least get someone competent to do it for him.” She yawned loudly. “I’ve changed my mind. I’m knackered and need to find my bed. Have fun you two.”
“Fourteen.” Theo set the blocks of cheese in the cooling cupboard. “Her dad made the Death Eater masks,” he said, pulling a face. “Can you imagine that order coming through? But what do you do when—
Harry tugged at Draco’s hand, pulling him towards their bedroom. “It’s only a short apparition jump and we haven’t been in forever. I want eggs Benedict and strawberry crepes. And maybe pie of some sort. Get your shoes.”
“This’ll be good for us, you’ll see.” Harry came up beside him and reached for Draco’s hand. Instantly, a sharp jolt of electricity shot through him. “Ow,
Theo snapped his pocket watch shut with a relieved sigh and shot to his feet. “Thirty minutes are up.”
“Close enough for the Ministry. You know how seriously magic weighs on a vow.” Harry turned the brochure over to point at the pertinent details. “They can host up to thirty people. We can invite our friends. Our family, if you think your parents would come.”
Harry stood too, and picked up the pot of floo powder. Friends could spend the night at one another’s homes, but only under certain circumstances like unsafe apparition conditions. But never when there was a risk of falling into bed together. Harry held the pot out. “I’ll see you soon?”
Narcissa nodded at McGonagall. “Thank you, Headmistress for the use of your office. Draco, walk me out.”
Draco no longer knew what to believe about his parents and what they may or may not believe about him. But he clung to those words as he helped tuck each of the children into bed. And something had definitely shifted during the last week, because he didn’t even blink an eye when Potter joined him and Pansy for a late night hot chocolate in the back garden.
Draco smiled at him one last time. He scanned Harry as though trying to memorise this last moment. Harry wished he’d showered and dressed, but he hadn’t wanted to miss a single minute of Draco’s last morning.
Now it was Harry’s turn to frown. How long? How long would they be in Hogsmeade? “Oh, erm, I don’t know? We can just see how it goes, right?”
Harry set his mobile on the worktop. “No need to wait any longer, I suppose.” He leaned back, letting Draco take the lead.
He plucked a few apples from the pile and tossed them in his basket. “No reason, I suppose.” Had her parents been arrested too? The Greengrasses were notoriously neutral. “Erm… if you’re free this afternoon… Some of us are having an ongoing party at mine. If you want to come.”
? That was the worst!” Ron elbowed Ginny. “This one wouldn’t listen to the tapes with him so I had to floo over and help.”
Flourish and Blotts had a sale on calligraphy and maths primers so he bought a collection of those as well. And even though the Manor library overflowed already, the large coffee-table books of fairy tales and full colour art would make reading aloud more fun. Pretty books with gold binding were just too hard to resist. He bought ink in a variety of colours and quills for the older children, but knew the younger ones would prefer their crayons and muggle felt tip pens.
“Very well.” She took the scroll from Harry and opened it on the desk. “Mr Potter, you’ll sign here. And Draco, you sign here. I’ll cast the binding spell and your courtship will begin.”
“Are you sure?” Harry asked, already typing his number in. He didn’t have any interest in dating Pansy (who was taken anyway), but he liked the idea of keeping Ginny on her toes, wondering whether Pansy or Draco posed the bigger threat.
She ran after the rest of the group, and Draco sighed. Pansy took hold of his arm and rested her head on his shoulder. “I hope that’s the truth.”
Harry blamed the upcoming NEWTs for Draco’s distance, even though he knew it was the owl he received from Narcissa and refused to discuss. He tried to give Draco some space. Until he tried to turn Harry away for their usual Saturday evening.
Harry made an indignant sound that only made Draco want to kiss him all the more. But Harry stepped away, kicking off his trainers and pulling his wand from his tracksuit bottoms. “All right, what’s the plan here? Beyond the ‘no expelliarmus’ we agreed to earlier.”
“Oh absolutely. And the boots… Sirius would be glad you’re still getting use out of them.” Draco knew almost nothing first-hand about Sirius Black but had seen and heard enough of Harry’s memories to feel confident in saying so. Especially when it always brought a soft smile to Harry’s face. “Your timing is perfect. The portkey should be leaving in just a few moments.”
Draco put the cakes in the oven and set a timer. He turned a coy smile on Harry. “Twenty minutes, you say?” He lifted the drippy spatula from the bowl. “Sounds like enough time for a little fun.”
Most important to him, all the children looked happy. Even Jane and Robbie had lost their hunted looks. Despite children’s natural resilience, he worried their trauma and fear would leave lasting damage. Hopefully this respite in his home would give the children something positive to hold onto until their parents returned.
“Merlin, fuck, I can’t—fuck, I can’t believe it worked.” Draco’s eyes burned with tears that fell as soon as Theo pulled him into a hug. He drew a shuddering breath, hoping he didn’t dissolve into sobbing tears. “I didn’t think I had magic left in me.”
Shrugging, Draco said, “Practice, I guess.”  Potter nodded, blushing down at his shoes, then turned to leave. Draco grabbed his arm to halt him. “Why did Shacklebolt send Granger?”
And he would miss him terribly when he went home for Easter. But when he said so, Draco gave him an odd look.
somehow. Annie sat in Draco’s lap and proudly pointed out the numbers she could recognise on his cards, which Gretchen took full advantage of.
Ms Coddle refrained from rolling her eyes at his naiveté, but Draco could tell it was a near thing. He didn’t want to elaborate on the state of the vaults he inherited, knowing Death Eater galleons paying for Death Eater children to eat would be met with sneers. Or fear.
Draco moaned and tried blinking into the water, a hopeless endeavour as the water sliced at his sensitive eyeball. He gargled and spat the water, trying to clean out his mouth. Then rinsed his cheek, but of course the come stuck to his skin like glue and had to be scrubbed with the scratchy flannel and even then he kept running a hand over his cheek to be sure he’d got it all off.
“I know. I’d let it get away with anything. If I were an animagus, I’d want to be something cuddly and not too big. Like a rabbit or a mooncalf. They always seem happy.”
Draco almost reached for Harry but let his hands drop with a confused frown. “What did you think it was?”
“Let’s make a pact to never speak about Simon Snow’s magic ever again,” Niall agrees and follows him out the door.
As he started to walk away, Potter grabbed his wrist. “Thank you. For listening. And for letting me… just be whatever.”
“Ah excellent! Let me get some paperwork.” He ducked below the counter and came up with a single piece of parchment. “If you don’t mind signing the waiver here. Are you gentlemen interested in the public rooms or would you like a private room?”
Over the weekend, he finally decided he had to order a pair for himself. Or several pairs. Thank Merlin for the internet so he wouldn’t have to suffer the humiliation of buying them in person. Although waiting on the shipping was a bitch.
Distantly he heard Hermione shriek, but more importantly, he heard Draco yell his name and snatch his body up with a hard-hitting Wingardium Leviosa. Slowly, carefully, Draco guided Harry’s body to the cool grass as Ron flew over to Hermione and Theo.
“Mm.” Draco ran a finger up the length of silicone, almost exactly as Harry had done. “You know, you’re not meant to share these sorts of toys…”
“No, it’s just… There’s a collection going around. For some of the kids left—you know—since May. And… you seem to have taken all the chocolate frogs.”
With a heavy sigh, Draco loosened his tie and unbuttoned his top button. Every minute Orion spent elsewhere made his anxiety worse. And the potion thrumming through him didn’t help. Sweat beaded at his temples and he angrily wiped his brow. Should he ask for a seat? How much longer would Potter be?
Harry nuzzled their noses together, grinning and playfully nipping at Draco’s mouth, “Of course I did, and now I want to fuck against the bookshelves.”
Harry’s grin was worth it. “It won’t be much… I’ve come so many times on this holiday, honestly I’m surprised I even got it up.”
At first I think it’s coincidence, the way his tongue swirls through the ice cream and teases out each little chunk of chocolate, because that’s just how people eat ice cream cones.
“Congratulations,” Andromeda said, kissing him lightly on the cheek. “Your mother would be proud of you.”
Were they meant to re-evaluate in thirty days? If it wasn’t working out between them could they break it off sooner? Harry supposed that having a check-in once a month made for a healthy relationship. He wouldn’t really know, as he’d only dated Ginny and that hadn’t lasted long.
The tiny reminder of the war, the families they’d lost, and their reason for gathering in the first place made the happy glow evaporate. Everyone shuffled awkwardly in place and goodbye began in earnest. Potter promised to return soon, and then let Draco lead him to the floo.
“Hmm, so book club isn’t plausible.” Draco tapped his lip, then leaned across the table with his hand lingering on Harry’s shoulder and whispered theatrically to Pansy. “Ideas?”
But he never got the hang of it. He had reminders for the most basic tasks all over his house, because he frequently fell so deep into work and research that he lost track of the time. Ginny grew ever more frustrated with Harry’s absentmindedness, and it was only now that Harry could see the orchid was meant to draw attention to
Orion slept under a colourful array of lights, with a tube running down his throat and another in his arm. Draco approached the bed, but didn’t want to risk breaking the spells by reaching through them.
“Erm, no Unspeakable Malfoy, all’s well,” Harry said, turning with a grin to find Malfoy glaring at him. He couldn’t help the appreciative scan of Malfoy’s Unspeakable uniform.
Harry laughed and drew Draco in for soft kisses. His fingers trailed down Draco’s bare back, making him shiver in the very best way.
“I honestly don’t know. Habit? Convenience? Most of the people I meet these days are parents of young children. She... means well, I think. Just… trying to keep me from being a workaholic?”
When a box of tamarack wood that had been stuck in customs came in unexpectedly, Harry spent a few hours in his workshop, happily sorting pieces for upcoming projects. Then they went for a winding walk down their lane, waving politely at neighbours that didn’t delay them. And finally they cooked their usual dinner together over a shared bottle of wine.
Harry flicked his tongue out, almost feeling ridiculous for swirling it through air around Draco’s cock. But only almost, because Draco’s moans increased in pitch and his body began to tremble all over. Harry backed away just as a garbled yell tore itself from Draco’s throat and his hand pumped furiously at his throbbing cock, spilling come all over his hand and belly.
Draco shoved him hard through the open gate and slammed it shut. “You help best by staying out of my way.”
Draco looked into wide, hopeful green eyes. He could say no. He could say that his worries and responsibilities weighed heavily on him. That too much waited on the horizon.
“Okay. I don’t know. I have to think about it.” Draco tucked the planning notes and the brochure in his pocket. He picked up his shoes and his Healer trainee robes. “I should go.”
But Harry had been in plenty of stupid and impossible situations and he would find a way around it, just as he always did.
“No, they’re muggle classes.” Draco’s lips twisted into a wry smile. “The Ministry informed us their regular classes were full.” From the corner of his eye, Draco saw Granger and Potter exchanging glances. Good, let them ponder the Ministry’s unfair treatment. “Would you like to tour the inside of the house first?” Draco asked as they came to the split in the drive. “Or we can follow this around to the carriage house and back garden if you prefer.”
But instead, he set his mug on the tray and stood. “Too many people depend on me. I can’t afford any distractions.” As he started to walk away, Potter grabbed his wrist. Draco stared down at it, bewildered.
“Isn’t it usually my job to complain about the cost of a thing and your job to remind me we are the richest people we know?”
“Ha! As if I’d sign another thing like that ever again,” Harry said, rolling his eyes. “Not if they’re going to deny a betrothal right from the start.”
Now he saw his horrified face and it, too, was comical. He needed to practice some new facial expressions.
“Let’s begin, shall we?” Mrs Stokke said, setting her quill to dictate. “As I understand it, Draco Malfoy has submitted the standard forms for opening a foster care home at Malfoy Manor and is pending approval. The DMLE, specifically the Auror department, has blocked his application for suspected Death Eater activity. Is this correct?” At several nods around the table, she turned to Ms Coddle. “We’ll begin with you, Commissioner Coddle.”
“I was… thinking more like… a date?” Harry swallowed his nerves and met Draco’s eyes. “You weren’t really clear on whether you date guys or if this was just to needle Ginny.”
“Because it’s not true!” Harry said quickly, looking alarmed. He bunched his hands up in his hospital gown. “Draco’s my friend. Like Hermione’s my friend. Like you’re my friend.”
“Not quite yet,” Pansy tried to say, but Draco interrupted with, “Off to the dining room, everyone!”
But he didn’t get to ask because Draco said, “Tomorrow. Oh we’re going to have such fun tomorrow.” With a beaming smile, Draco rushed from the room.
“I wasn’t snooping! I was putting your laundry away!” Draco yelled after his husband’s retreating form. “If I happen to see the things you hide in your drawers, that’s your own fault!”
“Now you’re stalling. It’s nothing special—just his mum. She writes him all the time. Go now or he’s going to go to bed and you’ll miss your chance.
The man looked them both up and down and shook his head. “Fuck me sideways, you two are a pair. Come find me if you wanna play.” He winked and in seconds was swallowed up by the crowd.
“I’m getting a new pair. Those have been repaired too many times and it’s just time to replace them.” Harry set a shopping reminder on his phone for Monday and Tuesday both, just in case. “Time is ticking down! Ask me again on Wednesday.”
“Third floor, probably. Poisonings and potions mishaps,” Potter said, elbowing his way to the lifts.
What the fuck did Draco think he was doing here? How could he possibly help these children that had nothing and no one? Would they live the next few years in fear of Aurors taking them away? Of their parents dying in prison?
“I haven’t really been flying since… You know, before,” Draco said, and instantly Harry felt contrite.
they were full. They were also given to family members that didn’t want them. Or that were unsavoury in various ways.” He tried not to roll his eyes when Blakely scoffed at that as well.
He spun on his heel and stormed back to the lift. He needed to contact his solicitors. Perhaps they could spin the letter left with Orion into some sort of guardianship rights with Draco. He smacked the button over and over, willing the lift doors to open.
Draco looked around the rooms once occupied by a Death Eater. All of its formal trappings had been removed and the colour scheme muted to a soft blue. They were aiming for a quiet, soothing space with nothing to agitate or harm its new occupants. The en suite led to a second, smaller room they had turned into another bedroom.
“Pickles is a free Elf,” he squeaked. His eyes darted erratically again and he looked ready to flee. Gently, Astoria passed Orion over to him. The Elf sighed happily and hugged the baby close. “Pickles will take the baby for a little bath.”
“Well this is an improvement. I really like those quaffles there,” Theo said, pointing at a collection of reddish blobs.
Draco clapped his hands loudly to dampen the budding momentum of sound. “I think it’s time for lunch!”
“I guess yesterday, talking about threesomes and then there was that guy at the club hitting on you… It made me remember. Before, when we first started dating. And I… I think I’m worried I’ve grown complacent.”
Was he wearing them now? The same sort of lace, or maybe something different? Did he always wear them, or just for special occasions?
Harry shrugged, a lame attempt at lightening the suddenly somber mood. “Sometimes I think about my parents and… I wonder if I’d still have Molly if I’d had them around. If I hadn’t been so lonely.”
“My love…” Harry sighed, resting his head on Draco’s shoulder and wrapping arms around his waist. “I’m sorry. I know your father gave you shit for it.”
“Of course not. I’m looking at the long game.” But Draco couldn’t resist running a hand down Harry’s chest anyway. Damn, his husband was fit.
After he checked his mobile for the tenth time in as many minutes, Claudia finally huffed an exasperated sigh. “I don’t know what he texted you, but I think it’s time you just go on home to your husband and discuss it in person.”
“Right, of course. Pickles,” Draco began again, “we were wondering if you’d like to come work for us.”
“I love you,” Harry said, his voice hitching. “I love you. So much. I thought I loved you before but I—”
“I know. But it made me realise how scary this all is. What if one day we don’t time things just right or someone misses a cue? One of us might be planning a funeral instead of sexy times.” The thought of losing Draco to a silly game kept him up late too many nights ever since the accident.
Harry’s mouth twitched as he thought it over, but Draco waved away the question and opened the box. And then promptly rolled his eyes when the first thing he saw was the rainbow tentacle. He pulled it out with an exasperated, “What is this doing here? Keeps turning up like a bad knut. I thought we got rid of this a week ago?!”
Draco couldn’t help but laugh. “I’m rather partial to the ridiculous. Like Lady Fluffington or Lord Periwinkle von Twinkletoes.”
Draco laughed. “You’re so deliciously hard, Harry,” he said seductively. “What are you going to do about that? Glamour it, perhaps?”
“Naked,” Draco agreed. Couldn’t let all those spa treatments go to waste. Skin to skin was definitely called for.
“Thanks,” Draco said again. Silence descended like a heavy blanket. Except for the squeak of Harry’s chair.
“Me too. I’m glad you’re up.” Harry gestured at the sleeping students. “I imagined everyone would be sleeping and I’d be eating alone.”
“No, it’s fine. I haven’t been there in so long, you know. I haven’t needed it.” Harry looked down at his feet as he opened the door. “I still—if you—if you want to get dinner again, even just as friends… I’d like that.”
Harry handed over the bag. “I’ll set an alarm and leave at quarter to nine, just to be safe. But if he comes back early, will you warn us?”
“I think I’m done with breakfast.” Harry got to his feet and took a step back, glancing around the nearly empty Great Hall. “Ready to head back?”
“We’ll still be carrying on with the interviews of your staff, and there are other evaluations that need to be made before approval is met. But yes, for today, you can have Orion back.”
The simple phrase launches me back over the years before the delicious weight of him on my tongue became comfortably familiar. I struggle to recall the sweet innocence we both shared once upon a time.
And that was that. Draco left. Harry wouldn’t have thought it could hurt so much after so short a time together. But then, he hadn’t expected this outcome at all.
“You’re only eighteen, Potter. It’s okay to take some time to figure that out. Loads of kids our age take a gap year. You can do the same.”
have custody of any of you, except maybe Orion. Our best bet for the little ones is to turn attention away from here as much as possible.”
He barely nodded in Weasley’s direction before frowning at Draco. “You look like shit. What’s happened?”
“Well they’re not really orphans, are they?” Draco said bitterly. He wrenched the bicycle away. “If you’ll excuse me, I have ice cream melting.”
Harry detected a slight hint of nervousness in his voice. Narcissa would be returning in two weeks to begin discussions of their betrothal contract and Draco didn’t hold out much hope that it would come to anything.
The fact remained that up until recently, he didn’t really think he’d make it this far. He fully expected to die back in May and now, on the cusp of the new year, he was still trying to come to terms with walking and talking and breathing and living as a man free of prophecy and horcruxes. All possibilities were open to him, and he didn’t know how to pick amongst so many options.
“Erm… yeah?” She pulled her wand and a handkerchief from her bag. A siphoning spell pulled perfume from the bottle at home onto the handkerchief. She dabbed it on her wrists and behind her ears. “What’s going on?”
“Next we have Mr Evergreen. He is an independent contractor that does work for the Ministry regularly. He’ll be reviewing the wards and the changes you’ve made since our last inspection. Auror Sterling will be helping him.”
In the bathroom, Harry was already in all his naked glory. Tanned, sculpted muscles. Tight arse and that gorgeous cock, which Harry was already working over. Impatience was his middle name. He grinned at Draco, holding his free hand in the spray of water waiting for the water to heat.
“Are you… Are you saying you…” Harry could hardly voice the words, afraid that his over-excited brain had jumped to the wrong conclusion.
The seductive curve of his smile sends another bolt of lust through me. And again when he whispers, "Then fuck me like you mean it."
Harry’s carefully held control fled him in that instant and Draco couldn’t say he was sorry to see it go. He loved when Harry lost himself, trusting Draco to hold onto him. It never got old, the way Harry moaned Draco’s name like something precious. The way his body moved against Draco’s. The soft surrender when he collapsed, sweaty and spent, against Draco’s chest.
Of course, how silly of him not to consider the list. He made a mental note to ask Harry for the rest of the list so he could read it all at once and not be surprised by shit anymore.
Later, when Potter left to find the twins for a game of ‘Go Fish,’ he dragged Draco along with him. Draco did this sort of thing all the time. But somehow, with Potter’s knee bumping against his as they sat cross-legged on the floor, everything seemed different.
Two glasses of wine flanked a large charcuterie board of cheeses, cured meats, olives, grapes, and fresh berries. A sliced baguette curved around several small pots of dips and spreads. Hopefully a box of miniature pastries was hiding somewhere for dessert.
Years of experience meant Harry knew exactly how to work his lips and tongue around Draco’s cock. But the addition of the train and their ridiculous school scarves gave the whole thing a veneer of schoolboy fantasy that Draco could admit—if only to himself—was much hotter than he anticipated.
She shoved a roll of parchment into his hands, babbling frantically. “About an hour after you left. Aurors came—Blakely and—and—I can’t remember the other one. They said we didn’t have proper paperwork for an infant and… Draco, what are we going to do?”
They neatened the table somewhat—binning napkins and melted cones that no one wanted to finish—and Draco left another ten pound note by the napkin dispenser. He ignored Potter’s knowing look and pulled the rope out of his bag. It was trickier to attach the children while inside the shop with muggles watching, but they managed. Theo led this time, and Draco took a turn wearing Orion.
But of course the universe had never, not once in all his eighteen years, been on his side and when he returned to the common room, half the eighth years milled around waiting on him.
Draco lined up the loaves of bread on the kitchen counter. “All of them? Leila’s what—thirteen or fourteen?”
“Certainly,” the woman said with confidence, despite the worried glances at their tables. “How many do you need?”
“You look like a drowned rat, plonker.” Draco smiled anyway and gave Harry a kiss on the tip of his nose. “My drowned rat. Conditioner next.”
Harry gave Draco a quick once-over and didn’t think he’d mind flirting with him a bit. The idea of a ‘type’ seemed strange to him when people came in so many interesting shapes and sizes. But appearance mattered far less than intelligence and wit. And Harry already knew Draco was clever and funny. His soft, boring-office-job body looked enticing enough, as did the two or three inches of height he had on Harry. All good things.
“The Ministry floos were a nightmare and I couldn’t apparate even one more time today, so I thought I’d walk but then… Rain. How’d you get home so quickly?”
“Can’t argue with that,” Dev said quickly, pushing Niall back against the bed and settling between his thighs.
Draco blinked at him, holding up the knickers so they could both see the bright green cotton with black trim and the word ‘Lucky’ in black cursive letters over the back. “Just how stupid do you think I am?”
Harry stood to shimmy out of his pyjama bottoms and turned a circle for Draco. “Enjoy it while it lasts because I’m definitely winning the next one.”
The hot rush of his blood only got worse when Malfoy stepped closer and rested his hand on Ron’s arm. Squeezing lightly he asked, “Are you feeling all right? This is a lot to deal with.”
“I take it back now that they’re actually useful. I enlarged them to make a bed of sorts for us.” He tugged Draco close enough to the ‘ritual circle’ to be enclosed in the warm bubble of air. “What do you think? Want to get naked under the stars and declare our love physically to the heavens in a darkly homosexual way?”
“Oh.” Draco’s heart constricted and he forced himself to breath as evenly as possible. “I didn’t see it this morning.” Maybe Harry had posted something else. Surely it didn’t mean what Draco thought it meant.
the options. This is one possibility. We can marry and worry about an heir to satisfy your parents sometime down the line.”
With no one around to notice or care about what they did together, Harry had a glimpse of what it might be like to have the privacy of a home with Draco one day. Harry learned that Draco routinely woke up around six o’clock in the morning, but thankfully didn’t expect Harry to do the same. He spent time doing homework until Harry woke on his own closer to eight.
Harry laughed and flipped through the beginning. “Look, the invitation to the ball. She saved him in April.”
Over the next few weeks, Daphne disappeared for hours at a time and returned with more and more children. Their stories blended into one common theme.
Mrs Stokke spoke before Blakely could send Harry away. “It’s not unusual for Auror Trainees to observe these sorts of proceedings. But take note, Mr Potter, you are to remain silent.”
Arousal, hot and thick, swirls inside me, making my fangs drop. There, on that throbbing pulse at the base of his neck, is where I would bite him if I could.
Harry knew, as Draco began to move again, that his orgasm would hit with a fiery intensity. It would explode in his chest, coming out as sobbing tears and shuddering sighs. But that was all right. Draco would hold him through it, and kiss him, and tell him he was safe and loved and cherished.
He laced his fingers together more tightly with Harry’s and yelled to the others, “Harry and I are taking a break from decorating! You lot carry on.”
Draco ripped the shower curtain open completely and Harry flinched against the wall, left with nothing to do but wait. After an eternity, Draco said, “Were you going to play with one of my toys without permission, Harry?” He sighed. “I suppose that’s what I get for not putting it away properly.”
“Worth a shot.” Draco tucked the violin under his chin and began a lively melody that widened Harry’s smile. Draco had considerable skill after years of lessons, and it made Harry feel special that he got to hear it when no one else did these days.
Harry didn’t like the way school interfered with his Draco time. Each morning Draco showed up precisely at eight o’clock and they went to breakfast together. But after that, they had to go their separate ways for most of the day. They only shared Transfiguration and Charms, and had to pay attention to professors then and not each other.
“Sometimes a married bloke needs company too,” the man said, leaning in with a wicked smile. For a second it looked like he might reach for Draco’s hip, but then he was knocked back by a hard shove.
“The contract says I get to take Draco on outings and my only opportunity is once a week to Hogsmeade,” Harry insisted. “Again, you don’t get to decide these things. I do.”
Draco arched his back and sighed against the glass, “For the hundredth time, they never—yes, fuck, just like that—they never swim up this high and even if they did, who cares if they see—Harry,
What the fuck, what the fuck, what the fuck. His brain completely shut down for four or six seconds while he tried to process what
“Oh.” He twisted his hands in the hem of his jumper and then pointed vaguely down the hall. “I guess I’ll… go find the kids then.”
Draco didn’t let his eyes stray to the nosy Ministry official or the angry Auror. “Actually yes.” He didn’t elaborate, and he noticed Mr Note-taker didn’t write down her question or his answer. “Most of them,” he added after an awkward pause.
Draco’s steps slowed. “Yes, but that doesn’t mean they’re able to live on their own. They needed a safe place to sleep. Food to eat, clothing. Both of them were removed from their homes with no warning and had nothing when Daphne found them.”
Harry ignored him and continued, “And I thought we could perform a little ritual of the homosexual variety…” Harry stood and whipped his jumper and t-shirt off. “In the back garden.”
Pansy peered at Harry’s phone, ignoring Draco entirely. “Dove, dingo. Seems like dodo has the nicest sound. Really rolls off the tongue.”
“Draco, my love, you were so fucking gorgeous laughing and dancing and I had no idea how to deal with it. I was in the midst of another bad break up with a friend of Lavender’s and wondering if I even liked women and there you were in these fitted emerald green robes that showed off your endless legs in tight trousers.”
That Friday Daphne went in for her evaluation, and Draco heaved a sigh of relief when she beamed that all had gone well. Draco’s good mood only lasted a minute and a half, because Harry Potter rolled through the floo as well, nearly knocking Draco and Daphne over.
“I can’t thank you enough,” she said as she rolled up their signed contract. “This is… it’s a dream come true.” She smiled widely and her eyes softened. “Roxy and I can make a life with this money, away from the expectations of our parents.”
“Wrong, there’s plenty we can do in the woods. It’s just all more comfortable in the privacy of a bedroom.” He winked at Harry as he sat back. “It’s fine. You can be the killjoy this time. We can save a first kiss for later.”
The boys got to work sorting, and within an hour had four trunks emptied. Theo ignored Draco’s warning and levitated anything that looked dangerous to a small wardrobe with a broken door. “What?” he shrugged. “It’s better to get it out of the way.”
He ran from the Hall and out the front doors, needing the blast of cold air to keep him from breaking down in front of everyone. Where could he hide where no one would find him? The Slytherin changing rooms. No one would think to look there. He ran as fast as he could, through the stitch in his side and the threat of nausea until he collapsed against the wall in the shower stall farthest from the door. He slid to the floor and gave up holding the tears at bay.
“How about we call it a tie?” Draco rocked his hips seductively. “Surely we can think of a prize we can share?”
Draco rested his head on Harry’s shoulder and wrapped his arms around his waist. “It was a beautiful home. But I like our cottage better. If only because we built it together.”
“I thought we were dating! I thought you were my boyfriend! I thought I—” His words cut off with a cry of despair. He thought he loved Draco. But did he even really know Draco? Did Draco like the things they did or did he hate Harry for making him…
“Me too. This is nice.” Draco looked adorable, smiling and curled up on his side with his pillow tucked under his head.
“Of course I love you,” Draco said, throwing his hands up dramatically. “You’re this weird mix of childlike innocence and utter wickedness!” He gestured at the food. “We’re having a memorial service for the sex we didn’t have, Harry. What’s not to love about that?”
He swept an armful of chocolate frogs into his basket, laughing giddily when several boxes bounced off the rim to the floor. “Frogs on the floor,” he sang to himself, then knelt to pick them up.
“Okay,” she said quietly. “Okay. Right, of course.” She wiped her eyes. “I’m going to wait here. You think that’s okay?”
“You’re an idiot,” Draco said with a fond laugh. He dissolved the sound bubble and smiled at his mother. “I think we’re ready.”
Theo pursed his lips mulishly and snatched the contract from Harry. Likely, he didn’t know what it said any better than Harry had when he signed it. But now, Theo had no recourse and had to sit on the other side of Draco.
Fucking hell. It figured Potter and Granger hadn’t spread tales of Draco’s good deeds. “Potter offered me help with a project I’m working on. Now is his chance to shine. Ask him yourself.”
He found four backpacks and two messenger bags, and Sherri found him three other backpacks. Muggle children were also preparing for school, donating their old things in favour of new ones. With so many children to buy for, Draco preferred a discount wherever it could be applied. Although the Malfoy coffers were extensive, he worried the Ministry would swoop in at any time to steal it. And who knew how long he would be caring for the group? Just keeping them all fed was a large drain every week.
All the same, Harry had a rough night, unable to get the image out of his head. Malfoy’s skin, the hot pink lace, and those two bright spots of colour on his cheeks. Like strawberries and cream. He finally caved to his curiosity and went to his carefully warded study. No magic allowed in the room meant a computer worked just fine. Well enough for an enlightening internet search.
he repeated frequently. He also wanted to avoid the bustling crowds of parents, so the Littles wouldn’t be frightened.
“No… I wasn’t. My parents worked hard to conceive a child. It took years to have me and they treated me like a little prince right from the beginning. It made me spoiled and rotten. Ungrateful. I didn’t understand family or love or anything like it at all.”
He didn’t need Harry Potter joking as though they were friends. He didn’t need Potter smiling from across the room, or winking in goodbye. He didn’t need Potter ruffling his stupid hair or swanning around in tight fitting jeans. He didn’t need Potter upsetting the careful balance he’d crafted at home.
spins it.” He grinned at Harry’s long-suffering face and bumped his shoulder again. “Come on. Dinner’s on and they’ll start to wonder what’s taking us so long.”
As Harry pulled his jeans on under his hospital gown, he shrugged off her comment. “We can’t do anything until we’re back in our regular bodies anyway. I’ll need some time to think about it.”
The silent minutes ticked by, with all of them sighing in turns. By the end of the excruciating thirty minutes, neither of them had to feign boredom.
But thank Merlin, Harry’s grin said the water’s temperature had reached an acceptable level. He stepped into the tub and offered a hand to help Draco in.
With every word out of his mouth, Auror Blakely sounded more and more ridiculous to Draco. He tried to paint the Manor as some den of evil Death Eater plotting, but he had no evidence to back up his claims. Five eighteen year olds, two House Elves and twelve children under the age of eleven hardly seemed threatening.
Draco shifted so he could take Potter by the hand. “No,” he said softly, “I don’t suppose I will. But that doesn’t mean I… I can still take care of you. While you take care of me.”
The building looked just the same as it did then. The wizard that owned it leased to both muggles and wizards alike, but still used magic to maintain the building.
Harry rolled his eyes. “I’ll see what Kreacher can do. Can we please focus on the task at hand? I need to find Draco.”
“Blakely isn’t going to let this go,” Draco said, indicating the slovenly uniform. “You’re probably going to get kicked out now.”
The door opened, saving Draco from further confessions. He and Potter jumped to their feet to greet Ms Coddle and Andromeda as they exited, both smiling and laughing. Andromeda reached for Teddy, kissing his cheek as she rested him on her hip.
As he crossed the room, his body collided with an invisible, yet solid shape at the same time a voice whispered in his ear, “Surprise!”
Hermione dragged Ron to the library as soon as lunch ended. Draco asked if Harry wanted to do the same but Harry whispered, “My room is empty if Ron’s with Hermione. Let’s go there.”
As the lift doors opened, Draco quickly scanned the room, but didn’t see the familiar head of black hair. At the welcome desk sat a sour young wizard, already glaring at Draco.
Lifting off from the ground didn’t terrify Draco as much as he thought it would. The wind rushing through his hair brought back some muscle memory. It helped that Harry’s body supported his, helping him to lean into turns and dips. Still, it had been ages since he’d flown and the speed of it was less exhilarating than he remembered.
“Mr Malfoy!” Ms Coddle called, chasing after him. “Mr Malfoy, I really am sorry. These evaluations are necessary, I promise. It wasn’t a ruse to distract you. But you have to admit we’re in a difficult place, given the ages of your board members. If you had an adult—”
Potter’s voice, thick with tears, sliced through Draco’s heart. “I-I-I would… h-have given… anything.” He gripped Draco’s shirt tighter. “
Trudging along to the Ministry Atrium, Harry flooed home and sat on his bed with a huff to bemoan his fate. But whining never filled his belly. He dug through the clean laundry basket he’d left on his bed for jeans and a t-shirt, then threw together a quick meal.
Annie beamed at him as she wriggled into his lap, forcing his chair back from his desk. “Those are flowers. The red ones in the garden. Can we go to the garden now?”
“Yes. Here at our wrists. Or maybe our ankles? I don’t know if that would work but… Say our hands were locked together like this and we each only had one hand free…”
“Thank you!” He scanned the colourful art, searching for anything recognisable. “It’s so green. Did you know green is my favourite colour? I like this part best.” He pointed to a set of green slashes topped with red circles.
, the last book Draco had lent him. The summary Draco gave him was dead-on accurate—ragingly homophobic but inventive. And by inventive, Harry meant really fucking erotic. Damn, but he’d seriously missed out on so many possibilities when he gave up those seventeen days.
“Now?” Draco asked, setting his wine glass by the sink. That needed washing by hand. “I thought it would be later, when we were in bed.”
“We don’t,” Draco said, gathering the sleepy baby in his arms. Orion whined and burrowed into Draco’s shoulder. “Based on the clothes he fits into and the milestones the baby books mention, we guess he’s turning one soon. We’ve given him the fourth of October, because it’s the same as my friend Greg and he liked the idea of sharing.” He pressed his lips together, knowing sleep-deprived babble might get him in trouble.
Pansy eyed them openly with a smirk on her face. She and Daphne missed most of the film, whispering together and glancing over at Draco and Harry frequently. She pulled Draco to his study as soon as Harry disappeared through the floo that night.
“Yes,” Draco answered without hesitation and they both laughed at the prompt and accurate answer. “You ask the first question.”
Reluctantly she nodded. Draco gingerly scooped up the boy and led them back to the house. “What did you say your name was?”
“Yeah, you too,” Harry lied. He focused his attention on his newspaper, hoping to hide the blush on his cheeks. He wanted to be grateful for this moment together, but embarrassment over their last encounter threatened to choke him. His brain, in a desperate bid to win Draco back, almost blurted out that he wasn’t
Draco laughed again and began fastening his trousers and shirt. “How many Saturdays do you think we can keep Theo at bay?”
picnic by the lake.” Harry couldn’t stop his blush, making Ron laugh out loud. “You’d get detention for sure for trying that by the Black Lake.”
“I am! This just feels really… decadent?” Draco played with Harry’s top shirt button sheepishly, and then unbuttoned it to expose his neck a little more.
“Wait, what? You weren’t at that ball!” Draco searched his memory for that long ago event, struggling to remember if Harry had been there. But he’d always been a little obsessed and surely would remember if he’d seen Harry Potter there.
That afternoon, he put the next phase of the plan into action. Neville helped him by luring Blaise to the greenhouse.
Draco shoved his hand right into Harry’s pyjama bottoms to give his cock a squeeze and growled against his lips, “We’re going to fuck like mad right here on the dining room table instead of breakfast on the second of September.”
“That’s another win for me,” Draco sang, plucking at Harry’s pyjama bottoms. “What’re you taking off next?”
Harry drifted through the delicious post sex haze he would never get tired of. Draco, curled up at his side, stretched out his hand and trailed his fingers through the dust motes dancing in the faint sunlight coming in through the grimy window.
The dressing gown dropped to the floor as Draco crossed to the bed. His chilled body enveloped Harry and they both sighed on contact.
I'm hoping to update daily but I'm also really pregnant and hella-slow at everything, so there are no guarantees I can actually write something daily! But I'll do my best.
“We’ll talk tomorrow if the potion works.” He glanced back at Ron. “When you’re back to your usual self.”
“Drink this,” Draco said, handing Harry a cup of tea. “We could get a room for the afternoon, you know. Away from prying eyes.” He inclined his head at the rest of the Great Hall, with its scattering of students.
Everyone pitched in to help as the children started arriving, giving them a sense of purpose and direction. Now, he couldn’t imagine running things without their help and no one
Mentioning their silly list of his attributes made Harry’s cheeks redden even more. Yeah, all right he should have played along to get out of whatever inquisition resulted. He certainly didn’t want Ginny to find out he’d tried texting her number from memory and accidentally got Draco instead.
was how Harry phrased it as they lay entwined in his bed. Draco agreed wholeheartedly, and had been waiting for an invitation like that for weeks. He’d moved the rest of his things over the next day.
“Here’s some pyjamas -” Draco’s words cut off at the same time Harry realised the curtain had opened enough to show Draco entirely too much.
Harry scoffed. “Sure he does. Anyway, I can’t steal what technically belongs to us already. And I thought that was better than a regular purchase because you know I wouldn’t be able to stop myself from telling Claudia all about the list and I didn’t think you’d want her knowing about the list.” He set the bottle on the bedside table and pulled his t-shirt over his head. “I’ll admit, I’m a little excited. We haven’t played around with your sensual delights line in a while.”
Harry shrugged and let Ron cast, since there wasn’t a muggle in sight. “Perfect, thank you!” Harry rubbed his hands together. “How much longer?”
Draco rolled his eyes. “Ron is delusional.” He sighed again. “All right. Let’s go back to the common room. I’m sure everyone wants to know the particulars.”
“Is it though?” Harry set two rashers of bacon on Draco’s plate and took two for himself. “Maybe not food. I also love dogs with regular people names. Like Andrew and Fergie, or Brad and Jennifer.”
What would his father think of him getting special treatment at a secondhand shop? And why the fuck did he keep thinking about his father? It was the anxiety he couldn’t shake. That itching on the back of his neck. He rubbed his neck, twisting his head side to side to ease the tension.
Draco’s eyes widened in expectation as he opened the envelope. Harry knew that despite the protests, Draco never got tired of dragon-themed anything. He pulled out the heavy cardstock with an eager grin.
All pretenses are dropped when one chilled finger slides along the cleft of my arse and he whispers, “Let me finger you open.”
Draco sighed heavily. “Me too. I just had to listen to my mother rant about whatever ‘deviant acts’ caused my ‘lover’s semen’ to touch my body.” He buried his head in his hands. “Thankfully she didn’t seem to want any specifics.”
“Mm, all the better to ravish you, my dear.” Harry sat up and bared his teeth for Draco. “Pansy showed me the spell. Hers are significantly longer but I didn’t want to risk actually piercing your skin.”
“Is that how it was?” Harry asked, looking down at his assigned reading to avoid having to look at Draco. “Resistant at first but having a good time by the end?”
“I know, babe—sorry, Hermione. Malfoy came to check on me earlier, because he’s familiar with Harry’s
Confused, he glanced over her and finally noticed she’d removed her school shirt to reveal a strappy tank top thingy that probably had some specific girly name.
But no one believed it. Annie clung to Draco like a grindylow all evening, jumping at every odd sound. No games or laughter after dinner—only tense, suspicious glances at the fireplaces and a silent vigil near the visitor’s floo. Draco didn’t want to seal it off because several children had found the Manor by taking a chance on floo powder, and he couldn’t risk someone in need not finding their way. He could only hope Potter wouldn’t share his little trick with the others.
When they’d first started spending their nights together, Draco found it easier to bare his soul in the dark of night in a language Harry couldn’t understand. Love, anxiety, desire, and fear tumbled through him and poured out in desperate words against Harry’s heated skin.
“Oh, okay.” Harry frowned, but didn’t let himself panic. He knew Draco wasn’t thinking of actually marrying her.
, I tell myself as I sit right next to him on the sofa and set the bowl of popcorn on both our thighs. “You don’t mind sharing, right?”
Leila thought she had a grandmother living in Ireland, but didn’t know her well, or how to find her. Marrin’s older brother could take her in but she hinted that might be more dangerous than living on the streets with Astoria and Daphne.
In the photo, Draco’s polite, contained smile broke when Harry surprised him with a kiss to his cheek. The joy rolling over Draco’s features transformed him and made Harry’s heart ache all over again.
All the children gathered in the large ballroom for the distribution of letters. Theo duplicated all of them before handing them out. But not everyone welcomed the start of the school year.
When Harry caught the snitch a second time, the others decided to call it and head into the warmth of the castle.
“Hell no,” Harry said, grinning widely. “We had it out with Robards and I quit. Said I wasn’t going to watch an innocent man doing a public good get stunned. Blakely said something about ‘not that innocent’ — the bastard — and I lost it. Threw down my badge and tore off the robe and said this wasn’t a Ministry I wanted to be a part of. And now it’s over.”
“Of course not. The element of surprise reveals many truths.” Ms Coddle adjusted her glasses and glared at Draco. “Are you refusing us entry?” A brief smile on the face of her assistant made Draco bristle with unease.
Harry stayed up late that night reading the first book Draco gave him. At her second ball after her coming-out, the young, innocent Honourable Annabelle de Ros, only daughter of an impoverished baron, saved the older, jaded duke from a poisoned glass of wine, incurring a life debt. Harry was fuzzy on why the wine was poisoned in the first place and finally decided that no one cared, as the romantic softening of Charles’s heart during his thirty days of service to Annabelle seemed to be the point of the book.
get to decide. And I want to see Draco Wednesdays and Saturdays. And tonight, since it’s Friday and the week’s almost over.”
Potter’s eyes widened in recognition. Good, he understood the severity of the situation. “They? Who? And where is he?”
Draco arched his hips up into Harry. “It’s dark and cold out so I don’t think you want to be running around outside.”
He sent the two boys to claim the first compartment behind the Prefects’ carriage, assuming it would be the safest spot on the train. Then he pulled another two trunks out. “Astoria and Evelyn.”
“Just checking,” Theo said snidely, “as chaperone. Can’t have you two plotting any secret meetings.” He opened it up and saw that it contained nothing but three truffles. He offered it to Draco.
Malfoy leaned into him, his hot breath sending delicious shivers down Harry’s spine as he whispered, “Perhaps privately
.” He gave Harry a significant look and traced his thumb across Harry’s bottom lip. “Anything you want, Harry,” he whispered. “Do you want kisses?”
“This fucking sucks. I can’t even comfort my own boyfriend!” Harry growled at his plate. “What do I do now?”
Sometimes our fingers brush as we walk, bringing a secret smile to my face. He’ll link one or two of our fingers for a few seconds until the other people on the pavement bump us apart.
But Draco gave up completely when Harry’s mouth closed over the head of his cock. “Fucking hell,” he gasped, dropping the violin to the bed as the bow clattered to the floor. His hand tangled in Harry’s hair and he made a few tiny thrusts forward. Only seconds later he came, almost sobbing Harry’s name. Still trembling and gasping for air, he dragged Harry up and kissed him as though the world was ending. “Harry, Harry… Merlin, I’m so sorry I stopped playing… Harry… I tried...”
“What the fuck are you doing in my house?” Draco asked with as much steel as he could muster. “How did you get in? Should I make way for a team of Aurors too?”
Ah well, cuddling was nice too, even if so far this month they hadn’t had as much sex as he’d anticipated. He kissed the top of Harry’s head and rubbed his back as sleep overtook his inebriated husband.
“Mm, no… I don’t think that’s going to happen, Harry.” He squeezed both of Harry’s wrists, then let him go, stepping back to put space between them. “Although it’s easy enough to pass off sex as exercise in a place like this, wouldn’t you say?”
“Not this time.” He was too close to coming, and just wanted to feel Draco’s familiar fingers working their magic. And he didn’t want to ask for something so intimate from Draco. At least not until he offered it to Harry freely first.
“After breakfast, I thought we could head to the library,” Hermione said, making both Ron and Harry groan. “Enough of that! Madam Pince said she’d set aside two books for me for our Transfiguration essay. They could be very helpful!”
Potter—or maybe he could just be Harry now—kissed the back of Draco’s hand and rested their joined hands on his thigh. “I like that plan.”
“Who can I speak to about placing a large order?” Draco watched the two people behind the counter eyeing each other, neither willing to help him. “You work on commission? Because I can promise you it’ll be worth your while.”
Draco didn’t know what to say to that, so he stroked Potter’s back and hair in as soothing a manner as he could manage. “Harry, it’s all right…”
“Come for me, Draco,” Harry said huskily. Arousal still thrummed through his veins and he wished fervently he could get hard again just so he could come with Draco. “Now. Come all over me.”
Harry made a protesting sound and sucked hard with a loud slurping that shouldn’t be hot. He stood and fumbled his own cock out of his jeans. A murmured spell against Draco’s lips had Harry’s hand coated in the shitty conjured lube they both usually tried to avoid. But then he had a hand wrapped around both their cocks and his tongue plunging into Draco’s mouth and Draco no longer cared what sort of lube they used.
“I see.” She nodded at her assistant and he made a note on his clipboard. “Are there many young children here?”
With a sigh, Draco opened the door wider and crossed to his bed. Harry shut the door behind him and joined Draco, leaving ample space between their bodies as usual.
“Okay, thanks Chester, that’s enough!” Draco said quickly, scared of what this little boy might say. They didn’t want to give Potter reason to return with a warrant.
The Elf froze. One eye peeked out from behind his hands and his ears twitched, “A baby?” Large eyes scanned the room with more purpose, finally landing on Orion, gumming a spoon in Astoria’s lap. “Pickles hasn’t had a baby to look after since… since…”
Slowly his hand slides up his smooth, creamy thigh to grasp the tender flesh of his arse. Opening himself up to me, his voice comes out barely more than a broken, raspy whisper.
Draco rolled his eyes and snatched the bottle away. “I thought you’d like it since you had so much fun with the temperature oils before and we haven’t done much with them since.”
Draco had almost forgotten Potter entirely until he showed up at their table holding a tray of cones, with the woman from behind the counter holding a second tray. Pansy and Daphne helped pass out the cones. Several were swapped as new flavours were discovered. Draco counted it a win when only one dropped to the ground. Gretchen followed the woman back to the counter to pick a new flavour.
Draco pulled out his wand and summoned two brooms from the far end of the lawn where, not ten minutes ago, Evelyn, Bryce, and David had been laughing and racing. Now they were all inside, terrified of being taken away by Aurors.
Why she couldn’t have owled that information to him, Draco didn’t bother asking. “Do I need to owl my solicitor?”
Harry didn’t have anything special in mind for the day, aside from spending as much time together as they could. Draco suggested brewing again, but Harry hated the lab and thought that would be boring.
On and on it went, until Draco wanted to tear his hair out. What did any of this have to do with his application? After a short break, Draco had to evaluate inkblots and then solve a series of wooden brain teaser puzzles.
“Of course not,” he said, rubbing her back soothingly. “This is Ms Coddle. And actually, she wants to make sure you’re happy here so you can stay. Do you want to say hello?” Annie shook her head, burying her face in Draco’s neck. “It’ll be okay, Little Bit, you’ll see. Pansy, Daphne, this is Matilda Coddle from Charity Commissions. Her assistant—I’m sorry, what was your name?”
Swallowing his nervousness and his pride, Draco gritted out, “I need help. I need to find Potter. As soon as possible.”
The only reason Draco abandoned his paperwork was because his mobile pinged with Harry’s special tone. Not because the paperwork, as usual, threatened to consume his last remaining brain cells.
The children waited eagerly in the visitor’s parlour, and attacked in a wave when Potter rolled through. Good-natured as ever, Potter endured hugs and excited babble. By the time he made it to Draco and Pansy, his face had flushed a bright red and his glasses were knocked askew.
“Yeah, that might be difficult,” Blaise said with his infuriating grin. “The snitch is caught. I think Narcissa knows about whatever you two got up to last Saturday.”
There's no actual love potion here, but Harry gets *very* (and adorably) drunk. No sex, just caretaking going on!
Annie came barrelling at him. He scooped her into a twirling hug before she could knock them both over. “You were sleeping forever!” she said too loudly, right in his ear.
Draco turned for the door and found Potter watching him once again. “Oh,” he said dumbly. “I thought you left with the others.”
By the time they made it to their bedroom, he was hard and aching, his chest and neck blooming with tiny red bites. Harry very carefully hung up the expensive cloak in the wardrobe, but dropped the rest of his dishevelled clothes in a pile somewhere near the foot of their bed. Draco added his pyjama bottoms, having lost his t-shirt somewhere in the sitting room.
“Not to brag,” he said, “but I have loads of money. I won’t even miss it. But there’s only one Draco in my life and if you hadn’t met with him, he never would have agreed to marry me. This is thanks for opening his eyes and nothing else.”
hands are cupping my bollocks. “Fuck, your hands are like ice,” I whine, even though we both know I love it.
“This has been lovely. Please owl ahead next time.” Draco held his hand out and called his broom up to fly back to the house.
Intrigued now, Draco turned on the sofa to face Harry more fully. He took Harry’s hands and closed his eyes to quiet his own thoughts. He blinked his eyes open and smiled at Harry. “I’m ready when you are.”
At the Manor gates, two children huddled together looking grimier than any new arrival had thus far. Both had ratty, shorn hair and stained, ill fitting clothing. How long had they been out in the world alone?
A large Chinese fireball, all in black ink, streaked across Harry’s chest from left hip to right shoulder. As Harry shook off his shirt, his muscles flexed and the fireball seemed to undulate in flight. By all accounts, it should be ridiculous. Harry wasn’t the tattooed type. But all the same, it was too fucking hot for words.
No one really expected Harry Potter to show up. And at the same time, Draco lamented, how could he have expected anything different?
In the kitchen, Greg, Jason, and Alex were taken by surprise amidst a snack with Roger, Chester and Orion. How the fuck had they not heard about their unexpected visitors? They all jumped to their feet when the group came in. Chester, much like Annie, panicked and tried to climb Greg like a tree. Greg handed Orion to Jason and picked up Chester.
Effortlessly I pick Simon up, growling when his legs wrap around my hips and his kiss turns decidedly filthy.
“Yeah, okay. I understand.” Potter settled back in the chair, but kept their hands joined. “We’ll re-evaluate in eight years.”
“Why don’t we have a sobering potion? I want you to go get me one so I can fuck you on this sofa right now.”
. It’s still the most popular of the series.” He smiled at Draco, more excited than he needed to be that Draco wanted to flirt with him.
They followed dinner on Saturday with dinner on Sunday. Harry didn’t confess their shared secret, but had hopes for Tuesday’s dinner. But then chickened out then too. It was just too easy to keep it to himself. Saying the words out loud to someone else, even someone who shared the same secret, set him off balance.
. The thought made him giggle and almost choke on the rinse water. He could put up with an early bird if it meant having someone to call his own.
Harry laughed. “For misunderstanding the whole thing. I still feel guilty. And a little stupid.” He bit his lip. “I… I miss your violin. Before bed.” He hated the way his words implied missing the sexy times they’d shared and the hot flush in his cheeks as a result. But he
But now in Harry’s mind, he could feel the warm longing that grew with each passing moment. In the memory, Draco began to shine brighter and brighter as the rest of the party faded away.
There was a long beat of silence. “All right. Call if you need me.” The sounds of her footsteps faded away.
Anxiety and disgust swirled through him and he wanted to drown in it. Unfortunately, he knew he couldn’t stay hidden forever. His muscles grew tired and cramped and his brain wouldn’t shut the fuck up about all his failures and mistakes. The best he could do was sneak into the castle before Filch locked the doors, and then hide somewhere inside until the other eighth years had gone to sleep. Maybe a night of sleep would help in some mysterious way. If he could even manage it.
Draco agreed wholeheartedly. He’d had enough of portraits yelling at him in his youth to last a lifetime. Why didn’t anyone ever animate his kinder ancestors? Or perhaps there were none of those to begin with.
The next morning, he brought up their seating arrangement when Theo followed Draco to their table and tried to sit between them.
“I wish that too,” Draco said. He smothered a laugh when Harry let the door go before Theo could fully walk through as well.
“Right, breakfast. Good idea. I’ll wait in the common room.” He almost reached for Harry, but then pulled his hands back. “Be quick!”
A doll. He needed to go into town and find a new doll. Still feeling shaky he stood and took a few more deep breaths. The anxiety subsided somewhat, but the itchy feeling remained. With careful, deliberate movements, he mounted his bike and followed the road into town.
, which their magical children greatly enjoyed), Harry shared a blanket and a bowl of popcorn with Draco.
“Turns out, she’s only agreeing to let her parents arrange a marriage because otherwise they won’t pay for her continued education. She and Roxy both finished at Hogwarts this past June, and Regina wants to pursue a degree in Magical Law.”
He flicked through reading names aloud. “Rowle, Rookwood, Wilkes, Snyde, Avery… This is quite a collection of names. Care to explain?”
Hermione had offered Ron and Harry more ideas than she considered for herself. As if her own life plan didn’t need tweaking, but clearly the two of them needed managing. Ron had hesitated over writing
Pursing his lips, Weasley disappeared into the back. He returned quickly with a packet of powder. “It’s three galleons.”
But his editor suggested Molly Meow go camping, so to the woods he would go for an afternoon so he could recreate the great outdoors for Molly and her animal friends. At least he was in good company. Draco didn’t fill the silence with unnecessary chatter and walked at an even pace that didn’t outstrip Harry’s own ambling.
“Yeah, yes,” he said a little breathlessly. “Absolutely. Brilliant.” Harry kissed Draco soundly. “You’re brilliant, you know that?” He straddled his broom, scooting back far enough for Draco to fit in front of him.
“I told you it was stupid.” Harry wrapped his arms around Draco and buried his face in Draco’s neck.
Draco dumped the box out onto their bed and quickly pulled out random potions and oils that had probably not aged well. “I don’t even want to see how old these are, and anything I made would be better anyway.”
Harry went to bed giddy for work the next day. Under his Auror robes, he wore his new knickers and walked with a spring in his step. They weren’t all that different from the boxer briefs he normally wore (aside from the trip to the loo), but he felt sexy and excited all the same. The fabric of his trousers felt different against his legs and it was probably his imagination that his arse felt rounder.
A cold breeze circled Harry. “What was that?” Exhausted and drained, he collapsed on the bed next to Draco.
I soak up the last of my spaghetti sauce with my last piece of garlic bread and say, “Yeah, well I’d do literally anything to get out of wearing any kind of costume.”
“Isn’t that like three years from now?” Harry shrugged, although his heart gave a happy little skip at the thought. “Maybe by then he’ll have dropped the habit.”
“Yeah, okay.” Harry found a clean t-shirt too and led him back to the front door. “You won’t tell anyone, will you?”
“Right. Early morning, I suppose…” Harry didn’t know how to say goodbye without being able to touch Draco at all. He shuffled nervously for a moment. “I guess I can’t kiss or hug you goodnight so…” Ugh, another stupid, awkward wave. He shoved his hands in his pockets. “I’ll see you tomorrow.”
“They wouldn’t let me court you if they already know they’re not going to allow a betrothal, right?” Harry argued on Saturday, when they had a moment alone. Truly alone—they’d promised Theo to behave if he gave them this one evening free of chaperoning. “Isn’t the point of courting to see if we get on enough for a betrothal?”
“Meet me in the bedroom in twenty minutes,” Harry said before kissing Draco on the cheek and leaving him to the last of his evening tea.
As he debated washing his dinner plate immediately, or saving it for the morning, a knock sounded. “Draco!” Harry said happily as he threw the door open. “I thought you weren’t coming over!”
“He’s right,” Potter said, stepping into the fray next to Draco. “We don’t have permission to remove anyone yet.”
“We are gathered here today,” Harry went on in a solemn tone, “to mourn the loss of something very dear to exactly two of us.” Draco’s eyes met his and one platinum eyebrow went up in question. “Today marks the end of seventeen potential days of deviant debauchery.”
Draco gave a broken sigh and ducked his head down to press them cheek to cheek as Harry squeezed his rigid length over the strained cotton.
She took the children’s rejections and acceptances in stride, asking subtle questions of the willing that revealed their level of care. What was their favourite thing to eat? Did they have a special spot at the table? What was their favourite bedtime book? And did they get in trouble for not going to bed on time? What sort of games did they play? Did they ever leave the house?
He doesn’t even hesitate in whipping the shirt over his head and says, “I think these boxers are yours too.” He hooks his thumbs in the waistband and gives me a look, as though waiting for me to give him permission.
The itching on the back of his neck began almost as soon as Draco locked the Manor gates behind him. The main road and surrounding forest appeared empty, so Draco got on his bicycle and headed into the village. But the itchy feeling of being watched remained.
No, not jealousy that drove Harry to such a frenzy of possessive fucking, but a fear of loneliness and abandonment. Draco spent every day thereafter showing Harry there was only one man he wanted.
Daphne read over her shoulder. “It says a series of evaluations. That sounds like they’re taking our request seriously.”
An hour later, the children were winding down and the chill in the air drove them all inside. Potter started to make his goodbyes.
Draco laughed and reached for his husband, carefully running a hand along the side arm of the frames and into Harry’s potion-tamed hair. “Where did you get these?”
Draco’s head hit the shelf behind him as he sighed at the ceiling. “Your mouth is a fucking dream,” he moaned softly. He tensed when a minute or two later he thought he heard more footsteps outside. “Hurry it up.”
Draco did his best to hide his own insecurities and anxiety. Some mornings he woke up frozen in his bed, his lungs seizing painfully. But he learned to box up those thoughts and seal them away, much as he had during the war. Today, they needed him to be strong.
Draco laughed and rubbed their noses together. “No, I’m just… I love when you do sweet romantic things like this.”
“You don’t have to be here, you know,” Draco said quietly. “The others take turns keeping watch with me.”
“I looked into some of the kids staying with you. At least the school aged ones I have names for. Several of them were rejected from Ministry-approved orphanages for one reason or other.”
Before the wizard could launch into a spiel about duelling spaces, Draco said, “We’ll take a private room.” They didn’t need random strangers witnessing their ridiculous duel. He signed the waiver after a brief glance and passed it to Harry. They had no intentions of incurring injury and wouldn’t sue the gym even if they did.
Although Harry still worried about having taken advantage of Draco, he couldn’t deny that Draco very obviously missed the snogging. And he did seem to lament the lost seventeen days of fun each time he counted down another of the eighty-four days until the courtship ended.
“Fuck no! It’s a toy kit.” Harry took the box and flipped it over to see the preview pictures on the back. “It’s a simple cylinder. A base design made of moldable silicone outside and a solid core inside. There are a series of charms you apply to it and it’ll change itself into the shape of whatever cock you’re trying to copy.”
They argued back and forth until they’d reached an equilibrium neither of them liked - too cold for Harry, too hot for Draco.
He hated to admit it, but abstinence helped. Draco still didn’t sleep at night, but he had a clearer head in the mornings for dealing with the day’s problems. Food was a near constant need. He arranged for a regular delivery from a shop in the village near the Manor of fruits, vegetables, bread, and cheese, but how long could they live off that?
“Doesn’t Harry prefer to be early when he can, to avoid work distractions that make him late?” Draco asked, once again laying his hand across the back of Harry’s chair.
“It’s going to be fine, Draco,” Andromeda said kindly, resting a hand on his arm. “The room is soundproof and calming. We have medications and first aid training. There’s fresh air and good food. They couldn’t ask for better.”
“Oh.” Harry’s eyes flicked up to meet earnest grey eyes. He leaned forward ever so slightly and whispered, “I wish I could kiss you right now.”
As if on cue, a knock sounded. “Draco?” Claudia asked through the door. “Are you all right in there?”
Harry set his lantern next to Draco’s and gave them each a little push. When that didn’t do much of anything to get them floating away, he shot a small blast of air from his wand. They swirled off, gently bobbing on the water.
Harry set out over the next few weeks to make Draco feel as loved as possible. With gifts, since he wasn’t allowed any idle kisses or touches. On Monday he gave Draco a pair of dragon socks with a special charm woven in so that when Draco wriggled his toes, the socks would warm his feet for ten minutes. On Wednesday, when they met in private, he gave Draco a new violin bow made from thestral hair, which was near indestructible.
“I loved spending my day with you,” Harry said softly as Draco extinguished the lights. “I love having you near. I love knowing we’ll spend the rest of our lives together. Sometimes that’s enough.”
With a pounding headache, Draco headed towards the Ministry floos. Each stepped dragged longer and longer as the Wide-Eye potion wore off. He couldn’t wait to put on pyjamas and nap the rest of the day away. His usual coordination abandoned him and he smacked both elbows as he rolled through the floo.
“Did you forget he was left on my doorstep because no one wanted him? You’re a fool if you think he’s safe.”
“Get peeling, Potter!” Draco said. He bumped Harry’s hip with his and put the kettle on. He made a mental note to return the unused shrivelfig to the shop’s inventory tomorrow.
Harry’s hand jerked and the spoonful of scrambled eggs he’d been serving landed half on his plate and half on the table. “O-oh well… Actually, it’s recently come to my attention that, erm…” He scooped the egg off the table onto his plate, then licked stray bits of egg from his fingers. “Yeah, I think it’s probably going to be my husband that might’ve dated a Brad or an Andrew.”
He could cross the common room and sit next to Draco and smile and ask him on a date and it would be no big deal because they were friends and he didn’t need to be nervous about it, even if this was his first date with a guy, because Draco had dropped a hint or two that he might be interested too and surely Harry hadn’t misinterpreted that—
In all the years that he’d been brewing this specialty potion, Draco never once felt tempted to take it. He remembered well his first introduction to it in Slughorn’s class, and didn’t like thinking about what he wanted it for.
Tension nearly ate them all alive over the next few days. All the progress they’d made melted away as if it had never been. Annie and Libby reverted to wetting the bed at night. Yelling and fistfights broke out over stuffed animals and quaffles. The worst might have been Bryce having a panic attack that set the tablecloth on fire when little Libby innocently mentioned a camping trip with her parents. How would these kids manage if they found themselves on the streets again?
He cut off when a soft sob reached his ears. “Harry,” he said softly, finally noticing Harry Potter curled up tight in his armchair, head buried in his arms and trying to smother his tears. Draco hurried to sit in front of him, awkwardly pulling him into a hug. “Harry, I’m so sorry…”
“Sure, that sounds lovely.” Draco sat at the table and took a biscuit, nibbling on it while Harry readied their tea. His glance strayed to the paper. “This isn’t today’s paper.”
