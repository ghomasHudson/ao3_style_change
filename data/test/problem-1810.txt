badly to Draco's unplanned revelation about the gossip regarding his childhood. But he was worried now. The good mood had vanished in a split second when Harry had looked at the parchment in his hand; all of a sudden, his posture was... well,
, and I hope to continue my ongoing process of reinventing myself. Thank you all for coming.”
Draco laughed. "I think that might be the nicest thing you've ever said to me," he said. "But seriously, thank you. Both of you."
Draco had gone slightly pink. "Can we just go back to 'you're grateful for ME', please? Why on earth would you be?"
have anything to do with the explosion, but if that’s the case then I don’t understand why he won’t tell us what he was doing there."
"She said 'You can't!'," said Harry, bitterly. "And the way she said it... Well, it was very clear that she wasn't just saying that someone else was using the ticket. She didn't want me to go with her."
Draco laughed. "I don't think anyone who was in the Hall that day will ever forget that line. I never quite dared to mention it to my parents, though, so I've no idea whether or not they found it as funny, in hindsight, as I did."
"Oh, hello, Rita," said Harry cheerily. "I was wondering how long it would take
"You know it’s Sunday, right?" said George. "Can’t it wait till tomorrow?"
Teddy laughed so much he fell over, while Harry stared at Draco in astonishment.
"Right, so basically women and men can each be split into high voices and low voices. Women with high voices are sopranos, women with low voices are altos, men with high voices are tenors, and men with low voices are basses. In practice most people's voices are actually in the middle – which is called mezzo-soprano for women and baritone for men – but choral music is usually written for those four sections. And, I can tell you exactly what the numbers were, because I've got last night's programme in my bag. Hang on."
"Are you OK to side-along with me?" said Harry, as Draco closed the door.
, and wondered how Harry's children were coping. He went over to the Slytherin table, where Albus was sitting between Scorpius and Lily; the three of them were on the end, slightly apart from their housemates.
"But you said you're staying there?" asked Narcissa. "Where are you staying, then?"
might do something amazing. And there is literally no-one else in the world right now who has that effect on people. So that's why the Ministry is so desperate to have you as their spokesperson, because you are literally irreplaceable, and they know that. None of the other countries bidding have a Harry, and it's quite likely that you'll be the difference between them winning the bid and losing it, because apart from the Harry factor all the bids are much of a muchness. So the least they can do is to make plans with you at the centre, rather than as an afterthought. I mean, you still haven't really got time to do it at all, but given that I know you do want to, it'd at least be slightly easier if the events were at times that work better for you."
Draco had momentarily forgotten that episode, but it all came flooding back now. "Bloody hell," he said. "I'll never be able to look Weasley in the face again, will I?"
to be a note from you to your son, but that people have often forged your writing in the past – I don't know if that's actually true, but they all seemed to believe me – and they needed to test it before James could open it, because it might be cursed. They got quite excited, I must say. They seemed almost disappointed when they finally established that it was from you."
"Well, someone who
Harry sighed. "Not much," he said; however, his voice cracked slightly, and Draco wanted to reach out and hold his hand. "Here, see for yourself."
"I should have known," Draco was muttering. "That is
"I think he spent too much time with you and Hermione," said Ron, grinning. "You made him think about things other than Quidditch! It was all downhill from there."
two can get along... but, mainly, you've always been a bit fascinated with him and you're intrigued at the thought of getting to know him a bit better."
"Speaking of which, I have something to say," said Ginny, getting up from her seat next to Ron and walking to Kingsley's side. Draco looked at Harry, obviously alarmed, but Harry grinned at him. "Don't worry, I know about this," he whispered.
Ron's eyes looked slightly watery, but he smiled anyway. "I

that broke off contact with your family. And I've been thinking about getting in touch too, since I heard that your father had died in Azkaban – you and Cissy are the only family I have left. But I wasn't sure you'd want to know
"I'm not sure why," said Harry. "Last time this happened, we didn't find any trace of the suspects, but they still didn't let us go home until the next day. I hope this one's quicker. And more productive."
By the time they'd gone the short distance to the Great Hall, though, their mood had changed. Harry had unwillingly revisited the scene of his final showdown with Voldemort many times during the sleepless nights of the last few months, but for some reason he'd forgotten about it while standing in the Entrance Hall. Now that he was suddenly confronted with a visual reminder, he felt as if he'd been kicked in the stomach.
The children will sing – he'll be back at Christmas time
"That was brilliant," said Harry. "You said all the perfect things to make him back off."
Harry laughed. "It won't be
"It's obvious why that is," said Draco. At Harry's quizzical glance, he continued. "If the two of you were to talk about the fact that you're unhappy at work, you'd end up having to do something about it, and making life-changing decisions is scary and difficult, so most normal humans avoid them as long as possible. Harry Potter is a normal human being – who'd've thought it?"
," said Harry, laughing. "I'm fine with us
, at least.
"Yes, thank you, Father," said Draco hastily. "Harry, shall we get a move on, before my parents start describing my romantic history to you in graphic detail?"
"I'm not going to arrest you, I already told you that," said Harry. "For two reasons. Firstly, because it would be hypocritical of me, when I've done worse things myself with no penalty. But mainly because strictly you haven't broken the conditions of your parole. I remember the wording clearly, and it specifically said that you were 'not allowed to perform any illegal spell against any other witch or wizard'. I remember thinking at the time that it was odd that they used that terminology, rather than 'person'. But the fact remains that you haven't broken that condition."
anyone was around to see me, but it was probably a bad idea nonetheless."
Hermione and Ron both nodded, and Draco stood up, wondering when he'd become part of 'Draco and I' but deciding he rather liked it. Harry leaned over to kiss Hermione on the cheek, and whispered something in her ear that made her beam at him.
"Great," muttered Harry to himself; he knew Ron was correct. Ginny was the perfect girlfriend when it was just her and Harry, but she did seem to delight in pointing out his flaws whenever she had an audience. At first he had tried to argue, but he'd soon realised that she had to have the last word, so he found it saved a lot of time if he just grinned and accepted her accusations. It didn't mean he had to
," he said after a moment. "
"I'm looking forward to our date, Draco!" called Hermione, laughing, as she followed Ron out of the door.
"Seven o'clock tomorrow morning, and I finish at three," said Draco, removing Harry's glasses. "How about you?"
Harry grinned and kissed his forehead. "Bless you, you didn't need to bring anything, but they'll love that. Thank you for making such an effort."
"Not entirely," he said. "I'd been living here for a couple of months before I started looking for work. I figured I'd better get used to just
"And I'm going to look for Parvati," said Hermione. "I'm getting on fine with Morag too, before you ask, but we both had different friends before we started sharing a room, so we agreed that we wouldn't worry too much about trying to spend time with each other. It's nice, actually – I didn't really know any of the non-Gryffindor girls very well before now, but we're all in and out of each other's rooms all the time. We've been visiting all the common rooms, too. Actually, I was going to ask you about that, Draco – the only one we haven't been in yet is Slytherin, because it feels a bit forced when none of us are Slytherins. Please would you come with us sometime? I'd like to get to know the people in there. Harry's idea was a good one – we needed the segregation to end to move forward."
"Pretty early," said Draco. "About four o’clock. But the sky will be pretty for a while after that, if you can’t come till later."
"Mostly. I did add a couple of extra mens, but I don't think anyone noticed."
Harry laughed. "Don't tell me she predicted this? When?"
"I did indeed," said Draco proudly. "I can show you the potato peelings in the bin, if you don't believe me."
? How on earth did you manage that?"
"You could say that," said Draco. "And I must admit that I’ve occasionally quizzed Hermione a little bit when Rita Skeeter didn’t include enough details for my liking."
"So what
"Oh, I don't know. Now we're not at school any more, I'm often surprised at how well Gryffindor and Slytherin go together."

"Fiendfyre," said Draco, looking pleased at Harry's statement.
Draco looked at him, and his face broke into a delighted smile. "I'm so pleased to hear you say that," he said.
Harry did so, and she peered inside for a moment before removing a package and opening it.

"Being Head Auror did have
of the cab, when they arrived, turned out to be a lot more difficult that getting her in: they hadn't thought, at the time, that the orderly was doing much, but things definitely went less smoothly without him. And that was before they realised that they had no wheelchair, so they'd have to more or less carry her into the house.
"That explains why I haven’t seen him," mused Harry. "So you’re in touch with him? You’ve never mentioned him."
"But I'm guessing you don't actually know their plans, because you never talk about anything serious when you're with them?"
A knock on the door brought Harry to his feet. "Stay there, Teddy," he instructed. "This'll be your cousin Draco."
"I won't even ask how you know about them," said Harry, "but I think he likes you. Look."
When Draco returned to Harry's quarters just before teatime, he paused at the door, suddenly unsure whether or not he should knock. He compromised by knocking and then, when there was no answer, letting himself in anyway.
"You know bloody well I didn't," Harry semi-growled. "There was another one in the kitchen while I was waiting for the kettle to boil. After that, I was a bit sore, but I still ended up having a nice long one when I went to bed."
just a one-off?"
Harry was all too aware that his very erect cock was now nestled along Draco's arse crack, but Draco didn't comment on this, so neither did Harry. "You never told me who yours was," he suddenly remembered. "You know the whole history of my love life, and I have no idea about yours!"
image while I'm at work, or I'll never get anything done," he said. "Better dash now, though. See you tomorrow afternoon?"
"There's Quidditch practice, but that's not for half an hour yet. This is interesting! I've been in here before with Al, but I always feel as if it'd be rude to stare at Mr Potter... er,
"I'd like to think so, but I obviously don't know Scorpius as well as I thought I did," said Draco. "I might find it hard to concentrate in that lesson, actually. I'll be trying too hard not to stare at them. I've seen them at meals since you told me about their relationship, of course, but tomorrow will be the first time I get to watch them close up and try and spot clues I've missed in the past. How could I not have known they're together?"
"More or less, yes," said Draco. "I knew that at some point you'd find out that I spend all my time alone when I'm not at work – I don't have any real-life friends – but then I was going to reassure you that I'm fine, because I do chat to these people every day."
"Thanks," said Harry. He stumbled anyway, but Draco had a firm grip.
"Do you know The Christmas Song?" asked Harry eventually, causing Draco to peer at him in confusion. "You know,
"It's weird that something so hot can be happening while it's so cold," he commented a few minutes later.
"No need; I may as well just measure you myself, if that's OK," said Draco. "You might have grown a bit since then, so it'd be better to get up-to-date measurements."
"I haven't been here since I was a small child," said Draco, looking around the room. "It's a lot more welcoming than I remember." They appeared to have landed in the living room, and there were lit candles on every available surface, giving the room a pleasant glow.
"I know you're trying to look away, Weasley," said Draco, "and, believe me, I'm sure I would be too if our positions were reversed. But I just wanted to point out that, as you'll see from my erection, the attraction here is by no means one-sided. I didn't know until very recently that Harry had ever been interested in me, but I can promise you that I've been having what you'd probably call inappropriate thoughts about him for many years. Yes, including when we were at school, although I would never have admitted it at the time."
"Draco had... a difficult time during the war, as did many other people, and since his trial he's kept a low profile and tried to make a new life for himself. You may not have seen much of him, but unlike many of our classmates he stayed in England and has been studying. He still lives where he used to, but Malfoy Manor itself has been demolished - on Draco's instructions - and he lives in a small cottage in the grounds."
as I was walking up," Padma told them, "but they just seemed surprised rather than... well, you know, disgusted or anything. So I think it'll be fine."
"Tonight, though, there’s business to be discussed," said Draco. "And I still need to put up my Christmas lights. But first let’s get upstairs. I’ll heat up some soup before we talk, shall I? That should help you sleep later."
"Sorry," muttered Harry, grabbing him to stop them both falling over. "Molly? Arthur?" he called.
It was Hermione Granger.
persuade me that you were right, though, when you talked me out of going to find the kids. It's not a good idea for me to be with people when I'm wound up. I scarred you for life twenty years ago, and I nearly hurt you again today. I'd never forgive myself if I ever hurt any of them."
"Well, of course I have," said Draco. "You know I hate not knowing things. When you told me you'd bought a house here, I realised that although I knew where Yorkshire
While Harry's tongue was busy getting to know Draco's, his hands were on a mission of their own. He started off by removing his right hand from Draco's hair and running it over every millimetre of Draco's face. He lingered for quite while on the closed eyelids, fascinated by the way the long eyelashes fluttered at his touch; he suddenly wondered whether the fluttering was symmetrical, and brought up his left hand to mirror the movements of the right. This turned out to be slightly awkward while they were both lying on their sides, so Harry flipped Draco into a supine position and lay on top of him.
They finished the whole bag between them, anyway.
Harry blushed, feeling ridiculously proud. "Well, I'm glad," he said. "I'm going to want to try again at some point, though, just so you know."
Harry laughed. "No, sorry," he said. "I wasn't very clear. It was the Muggle library in Little Whinging. The librarian did look at me as if I was a pervert, but she always used to look at me like that anyway. I think she was a friend of my Aunt Petunia's."
Draco glanced at Harry, and Harry squeezed his hand. "Don't worry," he said quietly. "I'll leave the talking to you."
Harry rolled his eyes. "Moving on," he said loudly, eliciting a giggle from Hermione. "We still want to know exactly what happened tonight. Draco said you fell on the ice?"
Five minutes later, they were naked under the duvet, grinning at each other. Harry reached out and ran his fingers through Draco's hair, delighting in its silkiness. Draco laid his hand lightly on Harry's waist, his grin fading suddenly.
By the time he'd said an awkward goodbye to Ginny and owled McGonagall prior to returning to Hogwarts via the fireplace in her office, Harry's head had been spinning as the realisation sank in that, in the morning, the failure of his marriage would be common knowledge. His reason for seeing McGonagall had initially been to give her the courtesy of a heads-up, but somehow he'd found himself talking at length about the need to keep Draco at Hogwarts. He suspected he'd babbled a bit, but McGonagall had just gazed at him sympathetically and told him to come to her if he needed any help, before agreeing to his suggestion.
"Still sounds pretty cool," said Harry. "OK, let's do it. A romantic river cruise, followed by... let's eat out, shall we? It'll be quicker and I'm
Oliver laughed. "Oh, Harry, you are too good," he said. "That's exactly how you ended up here today! But there
"Yeah, sorry about that," said Weasley. Draco glanced at him in surprise. "What? I may not have liked them particularly, but that doesn't mean I'm happy they're dead. So why aren't you living at the Manor, then?"
She was the spitting image of Ginny, of course, which gave him a momentary pang, so he concentrated on her body language and the expression on her face, rather than the face itself. She definitely looked happy. As Harry watched, she leaned forward and whispered something in Hugo's ear, her eyes dancing, and he threw back his head and laughed, before standing up and waiting until Lily did too. The two of them left the common room, heading out of the dungeon, and Harry considered following them until he remembered that there was a good chance Albus would be here somewhere.
"For a wizard, yes, but not for alcohol in a Muggle pub," said Teddy. "I'm seventeen. But I don't need a drink. I do like the idea of sitting by the fire – come on, Harry, can we, please?"
Harry stared at him, taken aback. "Is that what you think I'm like?" he asked. "You're wrong, if so. I'm not a one-off sort of bloke. But if
doing here?" he demanded.
A deafening racket of cheering and clapping broke out, but Ginny wasn't finished.
After the meal, Harry volunteered himself and Draco to do the washing up. Ron thought this was an excellent plan, and stood in the kitchen doorway, sipping his wine and making suggestions... until, that is, Harry threw a wet dishcloth at him, and he retreated to the dining room.
. Draco's favourite wank fantasies all involved him being embraced by men with strong arms, and he was suddenly desperate to know what it would be like to be held by Harry Potter. But that seemed unlikely to happen – other than in his wank fantasies, of course, in which Harry would undoubtedly be starring for quite some time – and so Draco continued his rapid ogling, well aware that he should really make his presence known.
"OK, point taken," said Draco. "Note to self: don't mention the rain to people from Manchester. I wonder if people from Seattle are as touchy as that? Seattle's supposed to have constant rain, too. I'll have to ask my friend."
"In that bag," said Harry, pointing.
"I never had pets as a child, no," said Draco as he got into the bed. "The peacocks were probably the closest to pets that we had, and they weren't very friendly. I got Kilgharrah from the RSPCA. I'd been thinking about it for a while – I'd heard other people talking about their cats, and I thought she'd help me feel less lonely. And she has – she's made all the difference. I was pretty miserable before I got her."
"What on earth do you mean?" asked Hermione.
"Exactly," said George. "But it’s probably nothing, as you say. Just some idiot whose mates dared him to go and shout at Harry Potter. Seems unlikely he could have done anything serious without a wand."
Harry's feeling calm.
until yesterday? I could never have done that."
"Ooh, I remember that one! You did it in your recital, didn't you?"
"Excellent," said Harry. "I mean, I do trust you anyway – you haven't given me any reason not to – and I have got food, but I'd never say no to cake. Anyway, shall we get going? Not that there's much to see at the campsite, but I think it would be useful if you saw it in daylight before you spend the night there."
"Goodnight," said Harry. This was accompanied by another smile and a slight crinkling around his eyes, both of which were still etched in Draco's mind by the time he'd stripped off and climbed under the duvet. He spent several minutes trying to distract himself from the uppermost thought in his mind, but eventually he gave in and took hold of his cock. He'd hardly started to move his hand before he was coming; he'd left his wand in the living room, but he'd mastered wandless silencing and cleaning spells many years earlier. Just as well, really.
"Definitely... an exhibitionist... kink," gasped Harry. "Oh... my... God."
stopped raining. Where d'you want to go?"
"I'm with you, mate," said Ron. "Can't believe I missed out on it for years before you introduced me to it. Nectar of the gods, it is."
"While I was in Russia, I watched a lot of Muggle TV, and there was this programme with vampires. Spike is named after one of them," he explained. Granger nodded knowingly and then said to Weasley, as he opened his mouth, "I'll explain it to you later, Ron."
A brief interlude before the press conference.
"Well, it's
"A total cock-up is what's going on, and I got there just in time to witness it," said Ron. "Which was about an hour ago, before you ask. But I do think you're more likely to accept it once you see what happens when Draco lets go of you. Go on, Draco."
This chapter contains discussion of bodily functions which some people might find a bit yucky.
"Of course," Draco said. "I'm impressed you actually stayed this long, after you said you didn't want to be here at all. And I'm pleased to have seen you eat some proper food. All you need to do now is get some proper sleep and you'll look a bit more alive tomorrow."

"Indeed," said Lucius. "I believe it was your friend Miss Granger who invented that? Such a brilliant young woman."

Harry grimaced. "This is a nightmare," he said. "You know what? I think I'm going to just Apparate there. I only came on the train in the first place because this was our last time and I wanted to feel normal. But this isn't what I had in mind."
"The thing with the fairy lights? How much more impressive would that have been if I'd arranged the lights so they made me look like Orion?"
"How was that?" he said, putting an arm round both Harry and Draco. "Did you like it? More importantly, did it work?"
"Thought you might," said Harry, still grinning. "Did you sleep well?"

"You look fine to me," said Harry. "Shall we?"
"Sorry, I forgot," said Harry. "You're addictive, you know that?"
Draco kissed him. "I knew there was a reason I agreed to you being my manager," he said. "Thank you - you're brilliant at making me feel better about myself."
That afternoon, they were just finishing lunch when an elf appeared to announce that Hermione was in the entrance hall. Since the post-meal song hadn't yet happened, they asked the elf to bring her to the ballroom.
"The forty-sixth," Draco told him. "There’s only the penthouse above us. It’s great, isn’t it? You can see the whole of Manchester, and right across to the Pennines on one side and the Irish Sea on the other."
25: Santa hat on a beach
"Well, I didn't want to spoil it for them," Draco said. "They'd never done any of it from memory before, and they were so proud that they were going to, especially the Amen Chorus. But if I'd stood in the middle of them, being the only one holding a score, the audience would just have noticed me, rather than appreciating what the rest of the choir were doing. So I decided to try it. It's actually not too hard. I've sung the piece a few times before, so I know it pretty well; after that, it's mainly a positive attitude that's needed to do it from memory. That, and an acceptance that the world won't actually end if you get a word wrong."
"It's a chippy, obviously," she said.
of people have come to hear Draco sing.
Draco took a deep breath. "Well, if I'm being totally honest, I've always thought of you like that, although it was a long time before I admitted it to myself, and I never told anyone else," he said. "But I would never have done anything about it. Apart from anything else, I didn't think you were gay. What happened to the Weasley girl?"
"Sorry, couldn’t resist," said Draco, his eyes twinkling. "OK. I think that if it’s a Muggle curse, it won’t have any effect, so you needn’t worry. If it’s a wizard curse, it’s not one I’ve ever encountered, so I’d have to do a bit of research to establish what it does and how to remove it. In the meantime, you just need to be vigilant. Keep a record of anything out of the ordinary that happens to you, however minor it may seem, and let me know ASAP. I’ll keep in touch with you in any case, though."
roast chicken, along with roast potatoes and garden peas. "I did think about doing Brussels sprouts, but so many people don't like them, so I decided not to risk it even though you said you'd eat anything," said Draco.
"OK, I can do that," said Harry. "Although I was kind of hoping you might have some sort of  all-powerful curse-detecting spell."
He reached into his coat pocket and produced a Santa hat, placing it on his head. "We were wearing these at work today," he explained. "Someone thought it'd be
"Adorable though that was, I think we can do better," murmured Draco, and he pulled Harry to him and pressed their lips together very softly. He moved one hand to Harry's hair and the other to his bare arse, and then his tongue was battling with Harry's and their lips were constantly moving in an attempt to find the best way of connecting. Harry could feel Draco's clothed cock pressed against his own naked one, and Draco's hand was manoeuvring his arse so that the friction was constant. All of a sudden, the sensation was too much, and Harry found himself coming all over his own red hoodie.
. If you like, though, I'd be very happy to bottom first; if you still want to switch afterwards, it should be a bit less scarier when you've at least experienced it from the top."
Draco thought for a moment. "Well, I agree with you that the answer
"What about black pudding?" asked Harry, amused.
Draco looked at him, his eyes brimming with tears. "Harry, I'll do anything for you," he said. "There are so many songs I've already sung to you, and so many more that I haven't. But this is one I haven't done yet, and I think it fits the bill." He sat down at the piano, smiling at Beth as she moved aside.
"This?" asked Harry, holding up their joined hands, "or this, as in the stargazing?"
The pub was packed, as was to be expected on a Friday teatime. Most of the customers were employees of the shops on Diagon Alley, but there were also a few Aurors scattered around, their scarlet robes immediately drawing attention. Harry nodded to each of them as he made his way through the room. He was surprised to notice Draco Malfoy sitting on his own at the bar, and almost stopped for a brief word until a particularly loud scream of laughter from the far corner reminded him of what he was supposed to be doing. Harry had been as shocked as everyone else when Draco had joined the Aurors, but three years of training together had made him realise that Draco was actually not as obnoxious as Harry had previously assumed. 'Malfoy' had gradually become 'Draco', and these days they got on reasonably well at work.

a lot of fairy lights in this room," Draco said. "It's actually quite pretty, isn't it?"
"And what about Draco?" asked Harry, although he suspected he already knew what her answer would be.
“I get the same thing with the American students at the Guildhall,” said Draco, prompting big smiles from the others as it was the first time he’d spoken in two days. “I always end up with a confused mental image of a Santa hat on a beach.”
"I want to talk to you about
finally read it he looked at me and nodded. He'll bring the others on time, don't worry."
"I think it probably was," said Lucius. "I can't imagine a non-magical owl behaving like that. Well, or a magical one, actually, but it seems more possible somehow, don't you think?"
Harry shivered deliciously at the thought of Draco touching him, and bent his head back to the man's nipple, beaming. He spent quite a while trying to decide which nipple tasted better, switching his mouth from one to the other several times until both were reddened and protruding. His hands, in the meantime, were mapping Draco's arms and torso, and when he eventually abandoned the nipples (slightly concerned that they might be getting sore) he gave in to the urge to lick what his hands had been feeling, to see what that perfect skin tasted like.

"I do too," said Hermione.
much, will you, sir?"
Harry and Draco both opted for coffee, and Ron went to make it.
He was delighted to find that Harry immediately adjusted his position so that more of his and Draco's bodies were touching; having done this, Harry started running his fingers through Draco's hair as their tongues explored each other's mouths. After a while, though, Harry pulled away, obviously reluctantly.
"No, she doesn't do it
Draco laughed. "I suppose I was," he admitted. "Sorry about that. But now I'm a

"It's OK," said Harry. "It tasted better than I expected. Was that alright, then? Or could it have been better?"
"None, but he can’t have been a Muggle, can he? Not in Diagon Alley. Anyway, do Muggle curses actually work?"
"Nope," said Harry. "He said they've asked the management whether they can get some, because American tourists are always asking for them, but there are no plans to stock them. Oh well. I'll have to buy some and experiment."

. I don't know him at all well these days, of course – the only times I've seen him since the war have been at King's Cross when I've been with Scorpius – but... forgive me... it seems a bit unPotterish to just go off on holiday right near the start of term, doesn't it?"
. And it will be a nice end to an amazing day. But then we have a concert to plan!"
"Which is why I'm thanking you," Harry said. "You were the one who talked me into mentioning it in the first place. And you were the one who came up with the solution."
"That I am," said Harry with a grin. "Come on, then - let's wow them."
, actually – it was definitely the news headline of the day. I was in France at the time, of course, but I got quite a few owls saying 'did you hear about Potter's childhood?' If it's any consolation, though, no-one was gloating. Most people were feeling really guilty. There were so many of us who'd grown up assuming you were worshipped by your family and friends, so it was a huge shock to discover that your family had abused you and that you
"Not really," said Ron. "Everywhere
Ron stared at Draco for a moment, and then at Harry for a longer moment, then sighed. "You know what? Fair enough. Now, I'd better get back so Hermione can get her bloody
"Well, I definitely want to meet him," announced Hermione. "He always gave me the creeps too, but that's all the more reason to see for myself that that person doesn't exist any more. I must admit it helps that they're not at Malfoy Manor, though. I don't think I ever want to see that place again."
"I almost forgot," said Harry's voice, even more breathlessly than before. "I wanted to tell you that I absolutely loved that song you sang to me, and I really want to hear you sing some more. But what I've been thinking about all night is kissing you again. So if you

"It might be a while before we realise," said Harry, "because I find I like touching you. I suspect I will want to keep doing it."
Draco looked at him quizzically. Harry took his arm and pointed to the doorway of the living room, where a sprig of mistletoe was hanging. Draco grinned and led the way to it.
To deafening applause, they walked out in front of the huge audience; Draco took Rabia's hand and they bowed side by side, before Draco escorted her to the piano and pulled out the stool for her to sit on. He shook her hand and walked back to the front of the performance area (there was no stage as such, but he noticed that the rows of seats appeared to be slightly raked so that everyone could see, and inwardly marvelled at the combined power of Harry and Hermione's magic). Harry was waiting for him, applauding with the rest of the audience; Draco joined him and shook his hand, and Harry gave him a chaste kiss on the lips before smiling reassuringly and taking his seat in the front row next to Hermione and Ron.
"You've taken up cycling."
"Fair enough," said Ron. "Would you mind if we wait till the morning, though? I’d prefer to be there, and I was looking forward to a nice relaxing evening with Hermione tonight. We haven’t had many of those lately, and it already got cut short tonight by Hugo feeling poorly."
"Sorry, Hermione," interrupted Ron. "But please could you continue that thought tomorrow? It sounds as if it might be a long one, and it's getting late, and I'm tired, and you know Mum'll expect us at the crack of dawn tomorrow."
"I'd love to settle down with someone," said Harry, wistfully. "But it would have to be someone I could trust with Teddy. I know he's old enough now that I don't really have to worry about him, but I've got used to putting him first. And, well, I'm used to living without a partner apart from occasional flings. It would take someone pretty special to make me invite them into my life properly."
"Well, thanks, I think," said Harry. "Have you finished your rehearsal yet?"
, so whatever you have in mind will be fine."

good at noticing things. I don't know if he's noticed the effect you've been having on me this week – he hasn't mentioned it if so – but I wouldn't put it past him."
"On that occasion, yes. I never saw him again. And since then I've mainly been with men rather than women, but nothing serious."

"Fair enough, I'll bring extra clothes," sighed Draco. "Anything else?"
"Thanks, guys," he said. "I'll come back for my clothes tomorrow." With that, he Apparated.
Draco opened the huge doors they'd just reached, and they stepped into the ballroom. Harry found himself smiling with delight, because the room was beautiful. It was almost as big as the Great Hall at Hogwarts, but had two rows of pillars running through it. The ceiling was high enough that the room must be two storeys high, and tall bay windows ran along the far wall. A grand piano stood in the far corner of the room, and Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy were sitting nearby, in two armchairs facing one of the bay windows. Neither of them reacted, however, when Draco and Harry entered the room.
"Twenty-nine," said Rose proudly. "And I have lots more words I've thought of."

Harry laughed out loud. "Unfettered, eh? Good word! But I'm pleased to hear it." He pulled Draco towards him and hugged him tightly. As their cocks were forced together, Harry exulted in the jolt of electricity that surged through him. He found he couldn't remember why he'd wanted to go slowly; he had this glorious body in his arms and he suddenly wanted to explore it thoroughly. He drew back slightly and gazed into Draco's eyes searchingly; Draco just gazed back invitingly, so Harry kissed him.
know that, but apparently my wife of almost twenty years doesn't."
"Maybe not," said Harry, "but the fact remains that nobody else had thought of it... including Hermione, and believe me, she's tried! Actually I'm quite amused at how she's been this week - she's alternated between being madly impressed with you and furious with herself for not seeing it. Which reminds me: you were also the one who worked out why she and Ron couldn't solve the problem."

"Oh, no," said Harry, dismayed. "Please tell me the first question wasn't 'Where's Harry?'"
They sat in silence for a while, gazing out across the moor and occasionally sipping hot chocolate.

THE END
"Excuse me, Professor," said Harry, raising his hand. "I'd like to share with Malfoy."
In the kitchen, it appeared at first glance as if every available surface was covered in food. There were several trays of gingerbread men with snowman icing, a huge dish of roast potatoes, smaller bowls of peas and carrots and Brussels sprouts, trays of Yorkshire puddings, and several jugs containing gravy and other sauces. The table in the middle of the room was dominated by a very large roasted turkey, which Ron was in the middle of carving. He looked up as they entered.

When the second girl had asked, he'd been about to refuse before it occurred to him that it wasn't very fair to say yes to one and not the other. He'd been determined not to allow any

"We came at the same time," commented Harry. "We've never done that before."
There was no conversation during the meal; when all the plates were empty and the house-elves had been summoned to clear the table, though, Lucius and Narcissa both looked at Draco expectantly. He smiled. "Would you like to dance?" he asked, to Harry's surprise.
Draco smiled fondly at him. "Well, do you also remember I said I'd learned the tenor solos but had never had a chance to perform them? That same choir has asked me to go and sing the solos for them on Sunday night. They had someone else booked - the same guy as last year, I think - but he's cancelled, and they thought of me. So I went to run through a few bits with the conductor - he said it was to save time on the day, but I think it was probably also because he hadn't actually heard me sing on my own."
Harry jumped up guiltily and went to fetch cutlery, while Draco followed Hermione's instructions. Ten minutes later, the places were set, the candles were lit and the wine was poured, and Harry, Draco and Hermione were just taking their seats at the dining table when Ron carried in the dish of stroganoff.
"I’d be delighted," said Draco, putting it on with a smile. "It
Liz looked from one to the other of them with a twinkle in her eye. "I can see that you two know each other," she said. "Tell you what, Harry, it's nearly closing time anyway. Why don't you put your fish in as well, then you can go home and eat with your friend?"
"Hello, Harry," said Ginny cheerfully, breezing into the garden only ten minutes late. "And Draco, of course."
to do it."
"Didn't you say you were leaving, Harry?" asked Hermione loudly, blushing.
"Harry's often told me that he wouldn't have beaten Voldemort without what Draco and Narcissa did to help him," said Teddy. "And that, although Lucius didn't help, he's still Draco's father, and Harry didn't want to be the one to split the family up."
"You're forgetting that Oliver already knows about the issue," Harry pointed out, "and he said to leave it with him. So it may be that they'll mention it first. Assuming he's already told  Kingsley, of course."
No," he said. "Really? That's what's got you this annoyed?"
Draco went to look. "Custard!" he exclaimed in delight, bringing the packet back outside. "Perfect. Do we have bowls and spoons?"
Harry smiled at him and linked their arms together, and they strolled through the trees at a leisurely pace. "I bet you've got a song stuck in your head, haven't you? You usually seem to," said Harry. "Will you sing it to me?"
"They call it God's Own Country – did you know that?"

Harry looked at Draco, who appeared to be speechless, but was nodding. "That sounds brilliant," said Harry. "It's very generous indeed. Thank you. Why
I've tried to talk to you about this before, but you didn't seem to be paying much attention."
Draco smiled at him gratefully. Harry was still stuck on Ron's first question, though. "Where shall we live? Do you want to move into Grimmauld Place? There's plenty of room, and there's no-one else there to bother us. Well, except Kreacher, but he'd be thrilled to have you there. He loves the Black family."
"Your thoughts
"Well, personally, if I was planning to curse Harry Potter, I’d want all the protection I could get," said Draco, grinning. "I don’t remember you as having a particularly violent temper, but to people who only know you as the Saviour of Everything, you’re probably quite terrifying."

But I'm glad things are better for you now.'" Draco had a tear in his eye, which Harry decided not to notice.
"Well, I like it," said Harry. "You should keep it up."

"It takes about three hours, including the interval, if you don't miss anything out – and we did all of it last night," Draco told him. "Most classical concerts tend to be about two hours long, so when Messiah is performed it's usual to miss out some of the movements. But the conductor last night was keen to do the whole thing. As for how long each chorus is... only a few minutes in most cases, although the Amen Chorus is a bit longer. But there are lots of solo movements as well, when the choir don't sing – there's a solo soprano, alto, tenor and bass who just sing those bits. I'd love to do the tenor solos in Messiah – I've learned them in my singing lessons – but I haven't been invited yet. I'm hoping yesterday might make them consider me in the future."
Draco smiled at that, and nodded at Harry before standing up and leaving the bedroom. Harry gazed at the door long after Draco's elegant dark grey robes had swished through it, before setting down his coffee cup and going back to sleep.

Harry has all the answers.
(He had taken a liking to that particular brand of handwash and had bought some for the bathroom at work.)
"Both, I guess!" Draco finished his espresso and produced a bottle of water from his bag. "Hang on a sec. I don't often talk for this long in one go. It's not good for my voice, especially after last night." He opened the bottle and started sipping.

Albus sighed. "I don't think he is, no," he confessed. "He did smile a few times while he was telling us – he did most of the talking – but I think he was forcing himself. He had a look in his eyes that I don't know how to describe – I've never seen it before, but he definitely didn't look happy. And Mum seemed fine, but I think she was worried about Dad. She even came over to me and James, while Dad was hugging Lily goodbye, and asked us to keep an eye on him while he's here. We told her about
Harry grinned. "What makes you think Professor Malfoy's seating plan no longer applies?" he asked mischievously. The majority of the class looked distraught; a few of them, however, seemed delighted.
“Right,” said Harry urgently, turning to the others. “I’m going to need some help with this, please.”
"Dinner's here now, Mother," said Draco, sounding on the verge of tears, to Harry's bemusement. "Please will you come to the table?"

"What...?" Ron began, but then his jaw dropped as Draco, resplendent in full white tie and tails, dropped to his knees in front of Harry, pulled down his boxer briefs and started sucking his cock with great enthusiasm.
"The Aurors knew, certainly," said Harry. "But no, it wasn't really a topic of conversation generally. Probably because of the lack of TV."
"Makes sense," said Draco. "OK, got it. I've never been camping before, though, so please share any other tips that occur to you."

got over it, but she's probably a bit embarrassed at the moment," said Hermione.
"Albus, I'd like to thank you, very belatedly, for making my son as happy as he obviously is," said Draco. "I am thrilled that you have each other. But we're both sorry about what's happening with your family. How are you feeling?"
Harry sighed. "I just got sick of it all. I always hated the attention, but I could see that it made people feel better to have a figurehead to pin their hopes on when Voldemort was around, so I didn't put up too much fuss. But I always thought the attention would stop after Voldemort was gone, and it didn't. It just got worse. There were still stories about me in the paper every day, even if I hadn't done anything. I tried just staying indoors as much as possible, but people kept writing to me, until I had to get all the owls diverted. And if I
Harry cursed himself for not thinking ahead when he'd suggested going clothes shopping.
Draco smiled, and held Harry until his breathing returned to normal.
Draco's opinion of the snowman was that it was a publicity stunt for something or other, but neither he nor Harry could work out what. They considered Alohomora-ing the door open so they could see whether it was actual snow, but found they'd lost interest by the time they'd agreed it wasn't worth the risk.
Malfoy smiled, and Harry was startled when the thought crossed his mind that it was a surprisingly beautiful sight. He didn't think he'd ever seen Malfoy smile before. "Thank you, Potter. It means a lot to me that you're willing to trust me. And I promise to try not to interrupt," said Malfoy.
"I'm not sure," said Draco. "Monday's the only day you have no free periods, so it might be a bit manic. I'll definitely
"Sorry. I'll try," said Harry. "And I'm sorry I accused you of gossiping. I know you wouldn't do that. I'm just a bit twitchy. But I'm really glad you're here." He laid his head on Draco's shoulder, and Draco took his hand and started absently rubbing his thumb over the back of it.
"I haven't had this in years," commented Harry. "In fact, I haven't been to Hogsmeade in years. This was a great idea."
about you. I take it
he shouted, but there was a definite loud noise that emerged from his mouth – and Draco removed his mouth and looked up hesitantly. "Is this OK?" he asked. "I couldn't resist it any longer, but I can stop if you need me to."
Draco did lift his head at this, and Harry tried not to flinch at the haunted look on his face, but squeezed his hands supportively. "Bloody hell," said Draco eventually, "I... don't know what to say."
“Draco, I want to talk about everything that’s happened today, because it’s all been amazing, but I want to have enough time to do it properly, and right now we have a load of people waiting for us. So can I propose a plan? I’m going to kiss you senseless for four and a half minutes. Then we’re going to go and be sociable for a while. Then – if you still want to – we can wander through the shops in Diagon Alley. And finally I want to take you to bed for several days so we can talk in between lengthy bouts of sex. How does that sound?”
"It might be worth giving an interview to the
Harry looked sheepish. "True, but I guess I didn't really believe you'd actually come until I saw you," he admitted. "Sorry I wasn't here to greet you. I was just putting the kettle on. D'you want a coffee?"
. It really winds the altos up, actually, because they often sing at more or less the same pitch as tenors, but because it's low in their voice the sound doesn't carry very well, and because the same notes are high for us we can blast them."
Harry and Ron exchanged a glance, and Harry shrugged. "OK," he said. "Ron, I'll come to the Burrow later. I suppose I'd better check on Ginny in any case. Oh... Draco, will that be alright? Sorry, it's going to be a while before it sinks in that I can't go anywhere without you."
"No, they're the only ones I have on the wards at Grimmauld. Thanks. And I'm not actually sure which Kreacher would prefer – he's a funny bugger – but I'll ask him."
Harry considered that. "I suppose it does," he said. "OK, Malfoy, fair enough."
odd," said Harry. "Because I was just thinking I felt like a hot glass of Butterbeer, before you asked. So it's probably the bond that's making you want one too. Sorry about that."
. You know: giving my wand back, rescuing me from Fiendfyre, testifying for me, saving the world... that sort of thing. Now, I'm thanking you for being kind enough to try and make me feel better about the stupid things I did when I was a boy. You really don't have to – I know what a nasty piece of work I was then, especially to you – but I do appreciate it." Draco was embarrassed to feel a lump in his throat. He hoped he wasn't about to start crying; true, Harry had cried in front of him only hours earlier, but he'd had a good reason. How pathetic would it be to cry over something that had happened over twenty years earlier?
As usual when he was out these days, he was listening to a playlist on his iPod. Draco loved to make these for him - Harry hadn't really got the hang of the technical skills needed, but always enjoyed the results. This particular playlist was called "cold songs", and there was quite a mixture of music. As Harry reached Westminster Bridge, he noticed a sign saying that the path he'd just come along was called The Queen's Walk, which was news to him; he shrugged off this information and grinned as "So Cold the Night" by the Communards was followed by "Picture This" by Blondie.
"Dinosaurs...?"
"I haven't finished yet," said Draco. "There's a coda."

Draco and Harry, their arms still wrapped around each other, both beamed at him. “Thank you all for your support,” said Draco. “And also to you for welcoming me into your home when I didn’t expect you would, Molly and Arthur.”
Harry looked at him and then grinned. "You know, I never thought of that!" he said. "And there

"She's right, and I know I always say that, because she always is, but even I can see the answer this time," said Ron. "It IS obvious why Malfoy's hiding. It's sort of the same reason
"No," said Harry. "But it's OK. I can cope with sharing a bed with a naked man. Well, at least I
Harry grinned. "Yes, fair point. How about the cafe at the V&A? That's pretty classy. Teatime-ish?"
Draco could resist it no longer: he stepped forward and took Harry into his arms. After a moment, Harry lifted his arms and wrapped them round Draco's back, and they just stood there; Draco was very slightly taller, and Harry's bowed head fitted perfectly into the crook of his neck, while Draco ran his fingers soothingly through Harry's hair.
"Indeed," said McGonagall, her eyes twinkling. "Anyway, I'd better make my announcement to the students – some of them finished their breakfast ages ago."
"But surely that'd make it easier to memorise, not harder?" asked Harry, puzzled.
"You didn't have any trouble, though? You know… more trouble than everyone else, I mean?"
"Not quite the end of the world, but we may have to reschedule our plans slightly. I don't suppose you brought any lube with you?"
Draco decided that it would be polite to knock before entering Harry's quarters, whether or not Albus was alone in there. The door was flung open instantly, and a slightly-wild-looking Albus pulled Scorpius inside without a word. Draco followed, closing the door behind him. He watched, feeling slightly out of place, as the boys hugged each other tightly. Albus was the one to break the hug; he pulled away slightly, gave Scorpius a quick peck on the lips, then looked at Draco, blushing slightly, with one arm still round Scorpius's shoulders.
," Harry told him. "Oh, it's snowing!"
doing. And even if it wasn't, I'd be happy to do it for you. The fact that I like it is just a bonus."
"What, that you fancy Mr Potter?" said Scorpius. "Please. I guessed as soon as you started telling me about what good friends the two of you are now, and when I started listening to you with that idea in my mind it was fairly obvious that I was right."
Harry closed the classroom door with a careless wave of his hand. "Al
"Wait. What?" said Harry. "Demolished? How come?"
Eventually Harry stopped giggling and sat up, still smiling. The towel twisted a little further with his movement, and Draco was unable to stop himself from licking his lips.
"It's the remains of my lunch," Draco told him. "I popped into Harrods to grab some supplies before I got the Portkey, but I overdid it a bit. Just as well, because I didn't realise there was going to be a buffet until I got here, and I definitely want to have room for Spanish food."
"I'll just go and get him, then," smirked Harry. Draco hit him with a pillow.
As the final chords sounded, Harry found that he had a tear in his eye, and he wasn't sure why. He'd spent part of the song watching Lucius and Narcissa doing their foxtrot (actually, he had no idea whether or not it was a foxtrot, but it definitely wasn't a waltz, and he'd heard of a ballroom dance called a foxtrot), but mainly he'd watched Draco. Draco had a slight blush on his face, but if he was embarrassed then it didn't show in his voice, which was a lovely rich baritone.
"Truly you are the Saviour," said Draco, grinning. He removed the last of his clothing and lay back on the bed.
"Yes," said Harry. "And we were asleep until you arrived. So, now you've seen that everything's fine, please could you go away? We'll come and see you later, if you like. But I'm too tired to do anything but go back to sleep right now."
"…. Sorry?" said Harry, trying to contain his laughter. "I didn’t do it on purpose, you know. And I did have a great time – thank you for taking me there. Although I do regret missing the opportunity for you to hold my hands."
The song went well – he thought it was probably the best he’d ever sung it – and at the end there was a short silence before thunderous applause broke out. Draco couldn’t help glancing at the faces of his family and friends (new and old, in both cases), and was gratified to see astonishment on most of them, but even more so at Harry’s look of extreme pride. Hugely encouraged, he settled into the rest of his programme.
"He is," agreed Harry. "And he's decided he wants to take you to bed. Right now. He wants to know if you'd be OK with that?"
"Which bed d'you want?" asked Harry, deciding that this was probably a safe enough conversation opener.
Draco stared, glad of the fact that Granger was clearly in too much pain to pay attention to anything other than the paramedics. It had been more than ten years since he'd last seen her, of course, but he had no trouble recognising her, although her formerly bushy hair was now tamed in a French plait. She looked terrible, though. Her left wrist, currently being carefully bandaged by one of the paramedics, was the wrong shape – Draco was reminded of a dinner fork – and her right ankle, held by the other paramedic, was twisted and swollen. She was shivering violently, which seemed reasonable given that Draco was freezing despite having only been outdoors for a few minutes, while Granger was lying on an icy pavement.
That unused ticket had been central in Harry's thoughts for the whole of the next day, and by the time Ginny had waved the rest of them off at King's Cross he had formulated his plan. McGonagall had been a bit surprised to hear Harry's request, and he had felt his face growing more and more crimson as he had haltingly explained to her why he felt this surprise trip was so important, and why he couldn't have done anything sooner.
Ron giggled, muttering "Plaice!" to himself, and Hermione rolled her eyes.
"… And I know Harry's always fancied you, so I shouldn't have been so surprised that things have moved this fast."
Harry shuddered in delight. "Bed," he announced, taking Draco's hand and leading him upstairs.
Surprised and delighted, Draco walked back onstage and found the audience on its feet. He’d assumed at first glance that it was just Harry and his crowd of Gryffindors getting carried away as Gryffindors do, and that maybe the Slytherin parts of the row were going along with them just to try and fit in… but no, he now saw that it was the entire audience that was standing and cheering, and also that the hall was now almost half full, meaning that several hundred more people had come in since he’d started singing.
When Harry regained consciousness, it took him a minute to remember what had happened. There were voices talking quietly nearby, but no other noises, so he probably wasn't still in the bar. Also, it felt as if he was lying on a bed. And he could still feel Draco's hand on his arm.
After this, they both broke into a fit of giggles, and it was several minutes before they could stop.
Draco gazed up at the sign. "The Cod Father? What sort of a place is this?"
"I honestly don't think it would bother them if people were gossiping about their gay son, but it's kind of you to think of that," Draco told him. "You're probably right, though – if it can be avoided, we may as well avoid it. So what's lube plan B?"

"Ouch. Sounds tricky. Have you worked out what you're going to say?"
"I was actually just starting to put my decorations up when I got Hermione’s owl," Draco said. "I’d really prefer not to have any, but I got sick of explaining that to clients."
"Hermione!" gasped Ron, but Harry just laughed.
we speak to each other when you're not there, James. How would you know, if we didn't?" He laughed, but tried to keep his thoughts from showing on his face, because his mind was whirring as he tried to recall the last private conversation he and Ginny had had. They certainly never talked in the bedroom, because Ginny always went to sleep a lot earlier than Harry and got up before he woke. During the day... well, during termtime, Harry was at Hogwarts with the kids anyway, and during the holidays Ginny was still at work most of the time. Was James
Draco blushed. "Is there anything I can do to help with dinner?" he asked, keen to change the subject.
"It's not usually
"Good idea," said Draco. "And I think this calls for champagne. Or, even better, Asti Spumante."
– but until the hand-holding, it hadn't occurred to him that there might be a possibility of more than just ogling the man.
Harry joined him as he went over to the window. "So it is," he said. "Very pretty. And this is an amazing view. It almost looks as if you can see the centre of London from here, we're so high up."
"That elf is going on my hugging list," said Ron, as he attempted to shove a whole sandwich into his mouth in one go.
"You didn't answer Dad's question, in the note," murmured Scorpius.
didn't blame him. It happened, and it can't be fixed, and I hate it, but it's in the past. Draco, please stop looking so horrified.
"You do have a lovely way with words sometimes, Ronald," said Hermione, kissing him on the cheek. "But I agree with you - this would be really good for Harry. And it's sensible of him to suggest doing the same thing for a few other people at first - that would be a great way to learn. I think it'd be wise to have very clear contracts drawn up, though, so they'd understand that at some point in the future, when
Two hours later, they'd investigated all the market stalls (stopping a couple of times for more food and drink), and were ready to go home. The rain had stopped, but it had been bucketing down for long enough that they were both fairly soaked, and were annoyed with themselves for not thinking to do an Impervius Charm until it was too late.
"That'll be a very short quiz," said Draco, as they set off along the Euston Road. "I don't really
"Not only have I never seen you in a suit, I've never seen you with your hair any different," said Draco eventually. "I'm impressed. Did you do it yourself, or have you actually been out and had it done?"

"I try," said Draco, smiling. "But I meant every word. Now, much as I'd like to stay here forever, it's almost time for breakfast, so I'd better get up. I presume you're going to rejoin the rest of the school at some point – will today be the day?"

"Good plan," said Draco, settling himself into his chair.
"Do you like living here, then?" asked Draco, as they trudged along the snowy lane.
"Night, Draco," he said.
As Harry swallowed what felt like a

impressive cock – jutting proudly out of a small thatch of dark hair. As Draco stared at it, Harry started to stroke it, gently at first but getting gradually firmer.
Draco smiled. "The next press conference is by the Thames in front of the London Eye next week, correct?" Harry nodded. "And," Draco went on, "when that was arranged, which part of the plan do you think they did first?"
It was answered by Molly, who stepped forward to hug Harry as soon as she saw him, but then remembered and stopped herself. "Come in, boys," she said. "How are you feeling? Both of you?"
to think that one was fairly harmless, till that lesson in fourth year with Moody and the spiders."
"She's always been very wise, hasn't she?" commented Draco. "And she's almost always right. I suggest we take her advice."
Rose looked sharply at Draco, who realised that she knew a lot of stories to go with his name; however, she merely said, "Pleased to meet you, Mr Malfoy," and held out her hand.
Malfoy seemed to relax slightly at this. "I see," he said. "Well, much as I'd like to chat, I'm afraid that I'm on a bit of a tight schedule today. I really need to have one more go through this, so I apologise for ignoring you. You're welcome to sit there, though, of course."
"Not yet. I haven't been online since Monday night, in any case. I... sort of didn't want to tempt fate by announcing what was happening with us, if that makes any sense. It still seemed a bit too good to be true. I will, though. Apart from anything else, I already had them all asking why I wasn't online on Saturday night or Sunday, so they'll be even more curious when I next go on. So... you don't mind me telling people?"
"Or I could stay with you," Draco found himself saying.
Harry beamed and pulled Draco down to the bed, turning him until they were spooning. Harry used one hand to pull the duvet over them both, before enfolding Draco in his arms. "I haven't got to be anywhere before tomorrow – have you?" he asked.

He picked up his cloak and walked to the door. Just before he stepped out into the corridor, he looked back and found Harry gazing at him with an inscrutable look on his face.
"Huh, I hadn't thought of that," admitted Draco. "I suppose we should. A Muggle one or a Wizard one, though?"

"It's so dark that you literally can't see your hand in front of your face," added Harry. "So the night sky is absolutely spectacular."
did I not know that? Teddy's my godson! I didn't realise he'd even
"There what is?"
"Maybe it's a bit of both," Harry suggested. "You never know. Maybe it's also that a phoenix can sing? But in any case I'm glad you were finally happy enough to do a Patronus. Is that night still your happiest memory?"

," said Draco, keeping a perfectly straight face for several seconds before breaking into a grin.
Draco hummed in agreement, as they reached the top of the stairs and he led Harry into the first room along the landing. It was the biggest bedroom Harry had ever seen – in fact, if it hadn't been for the bed in the middle of the far wall, he would have assumed it was another ballroom.
Half an hour later, Harry was still staring open-mouthed as Draco finished his last song (which, like all the others, wasn't one Harry had heard before: it had unusual words, but they were at least in English) and bowed his head as Rabia played the outro on the piano.
A streak of light shot down the alley towards them, coalescing in front of Harry into a bright silver fox. "Everything's all ready to go," it said quietly, in Seamus's voice. "Don't send your Patronus back unless you want to spoil the surprise - I'm standing right by the Knockturn Alley entrance and there are lots of people around, and everyone knows your stag. Actually, you'd better send it if you're not here yet. But assuming you're at the usual apparition point, I'll watch out for you appearing near Ollivanders in the next few minutes, and I'll start things off exactly two minutes after I first see you. That should give people enough time to notice you before I distract them."

Harry laughed and held out the cracker. Draco grabbed it and pulled, and then emptied the contents of his half onto his hand.
mentioned Harry's involvement with this, which meant that he'd been able to gaze around the hall to see people's reactions while their attention was still fixed on the Headteacher. He'd noticed that the Slytherin table, which was much sparser than the other three, had seemed a little worried, but mostly as excited as the others... with one exception. Malfoy, who was the only returning Slytherin eighth-year, had been sitting slightly apart from his housemates, looking uncomfortable and not speaking unless spoken to; when the news about the common rooms had been revealed, he'd raised his eyebrows but had otherwise seemed unmoved.
Seamus tilted his head looked at him. "You know what? We've known each other for, what, thirteen years? And in all that time I don't think I can
. Maybe it was because Draco had casually mentioned his sexuality. Harry suspected that it was more than that, though; it was true that he'd admired Draco's looks at school, yet he hadn't known till today that Draco was gay. He didn't think he'd ever imagined him
"Hmm, I see what you mean," said Harry. "And I don't suppose our history helps, when all we've ever done is react badly to each other. But I really do want to move forward rather than keep looking back. That's one of the reasons I offered to room with you. I know we probably won't trust each other immediately, but I promise you I'll try, and if you can too then we'll be fine. And if people can see that
"So, was that the first time you've had fish and chips from a proper chippy?" Harry asked.
tonight to make a statement about us?"
"And, based on your earlier comment, I take it he ended it rather than you?"
"Sorry I'm late," said Rabia, apparently appearing from nowhere. "Are there any rooms?"
Teddy, who was apparently engrossed in watching a series of approximate-looking balloon animals being created on the far side of the room, whirled round at this. His hair started to turn ginger at the sight of Ginny, causing Harry to cast a panicked nonverbal spell before anyone noticed.
for people to stare at, and Draco and I just happened to be there at the same time but not as interesting as whatever else was going on, it'd be a good way of easing him back into the public consciousness. Then, next time we're there, it won't be a novelty."
"No, no, it's fine," said Draco. "Of course you're very welcome. I'm sorry I've not invited you earlier – I
are. You look terrible. If you don't want to talk about it yet, I can understand that, but I'm here and I want to help however I can."
"It takes some getting used to, doesn't it?" said Harry. "Wait till you see his flat. He's got a telly and a laptop and... well, all the normal electrical stuff that wizards don't have."
Draco smiled. "Whatever she says, I've almost certainly heard worse," he said. "But we can leave whenever you like. You can Apparate directly into the Manor now – if she winds you up, you don't need to warn me, just take us there."
"They're just

"Good morning," he said to Harry, and if his voice was a little husky then it was only to be expected, he decided. "I must say I approve of your way of waking people up."
. Ginny never did that, and it seemed like such a silly thing for me to want that I never asked her. We just got into a routine where she'd always lie down with her back to me and I'd spoon up to her. And then, of course, we eventually stopped going to bed at the same time, and although we still slept in the same bed we'd stay on separate sides."
"Well, of course I noticed, you're my best mate. Also I'm married to Hermione, and she's been worried about you for a while."
"I was so impressed the first time I saw that spell," said Harry, shoving handfuls of socks and underwear into a drawer. "But you're right – an unpacking spell would be even more amazing."
about to ask that," he admitted. "You really think it'll be OK? I'm sort of dreading facing them all, but particularly her. It does make me happy to know I'm the first one you've taken with you, though. So thank you for that."
"No," said Harry. "Well, yes, but there are lots of places I could have done that. There's a reason we came here rather than anywhere else in England."
Draco snorted. "Says the guy who could do one as a teenager despite his parents having been killed by the Dark Lord," he pointed out.
"I'm sure. But I promise I'll check with them in advance rather than just turning up and surprising them. There'll be plenty of food, anyway. Ron always makes too much."

Draco turned to look. "I can see all seven of the main stars," he announced, pleased. "The most I've seen before is six."

felt different. All she ever seemed to want was for us to go out in public, and you know what happened the one time we did."
"Well, let's hope that's not necessary, but it's good to know it's an option," said Harry. "Thank you. All of you. I really appreciate it."

"I think my son has finally gone totally insane," said Lucius. "It does run in the family, you know. Maybe coffee and cake will help. Can I get you two gentlemen anything?"
Harry interlocked his fingers with Draco's and smiled at him, not letting go. "Singing!" he exclaimed. "I almost forgot. You were going to tell me more about what sort of things you sing when it's not the Messiah."
It's been a nice evening, but it ends with a shock.

Harry walked into the Great Hall the following morning in a bit of a daze. Draco, strolling alongside him impassively, had merely nodded at the various students who'd greeted Harry with delight on their way to the hall, but he gave Harry a quick private smile and squeezed his hand before they entered.
"How are you feeling?" asked Harry.

before – and the growing realisation that he wanted Draco, physically, more than he'd ever wanted anyone. He assumed that this meant he was gay, or at least bisexual; he tried out both labels in his mind before deciding that it didn't really matter. After all, if he'd been asked a week earlier, he'd have said he was heterosexual without a second thought, whereas in hindsight he'd actually been closer to

Harry felt his face redden, but it was Draco who responded. "Look, Ron, I really appreciate your help with all this – you being here has definitely made things a lot easier – but I think that's something Harry and I would be better discussing in private. And it can wait – it's not the most urgent thing we need to sort out, is it?"
He looked from Harry to Draco and then back to Harry, biting his lip. Draco wasn't sure quite how to interpret this, so he caught Harry's eye and nodded, trusting in Harry to know what his son's reaction would be.
Draco wrapped his arms around Harry as soon as they arrived, and they stood there in a desperate hug for several minutes.
means Elf King – well, not exactly, but that's the usual English translation. It's a brilliant song, but it's incredibly difficult for both the singer and the pianist."
Harry buried his head in Draco's hair, embarrassed but proud. "That reminds me," he said, after a minute. "I've had an idea, and I'm really pleased with it, but I need to know what you think. Promise you'll tell me if you think it's stupid?"
, and this song means a lot to me. When I first started singing it, I couldn’t help thinking about a man I’d known once. He’s the best man I know, and I’m lucky that I’ve found him again recently, and he’s here today. Harry, I’ve never yet managed to sing this without crying, but I think I might be able to today, with you in front of me, because it means I can hope for the future rather than dwell on the past. I love you so much.”
Harry flushed slightly. "I think he's probably referring to that first Wednesday, when we spent the whole day in bed," he admitted. "You had the day off, remember, but

Draco weaved his way through the bustling Austrian Christmas market, muttering "es tut mir leid!" every time someone bumped into him and being quietly amused at the Britishness of apologising for something that wasn't his fault. He could see the brightly-lit ice rink just up ahead, and wondered (not for the first time) why Harry had asked to meet him here.
"This is all very interesting," said Granger, "and I do want to hear more about what you've done since we last saw you, but we've not yet got to the reason why we came today, so do you mind if we bring the conversation back to Harry? And also, I'm just wondering – have you ever tried the Animagus reversal spell on Spike?"

"Can't argue with that," said Harry. "At first I thought it was just because I always left it till then to start my preparation, but then Neville told me that he always does all his preparation straight after school on Friday so that his weekends are free, yet he
"Goodnight, Draco," said Harry, planting one last quick kiss on Draco's lips before popping out of sight.
The main thing on his mind was, in fact, Draco. This would be their last night together, and they still hadn't fucked each other... although they'd done everything else very thoroughly indeed. Harry was sure Draco must have been thinking about it, but he was grateful that his... what should he call him? Lover? Boyfriend? Partner? None seemed quite right, so he decided to just stick with 'Draco' for the moment. Anyway, Harry was grateful that Draco had kept his promise not to put any pressure on Harry, but he'd been obsessing about this more and more as the week went on, and he'd just about decided that he wanted to try it tonight.

Draco hung his head, embarrassed. "I

," Hermione told him. "Which is slightly scary but not very helpful."
Draco looked at him gratefully, and they crossed the floor. As they reached the piano, several house-elves appeared, carrying cutlery, plates of food and glasses of what looked like wine and water. Draco nodded to them, and they set their burdens upon a nearby table and vanished.
"Thank you, Harry," said Draco, when they stepped apart after quite some time. "I really needed that. I can't remember the last time I was hugged."
"Thank goodness for that," said Harry, looking very relieved. Draco looked at him quizzically.
"I hadn't thought about that," said Draco, amused. "I wouldn't worry, though. I suspect we're both competitive enough that we can produce an entertaining spectacle. I'll certainly be trying to beat
"Well, I'm glad the thirty-two-year old you did," said Harry, grinning. "Now we both know where we stand. The only trouble is, the thirty-two-year-old

– I can't usually sing it without getting a tear in my eye, so I dread to think what I'll be like with you in front of me. That's why I wanted to try it out on you when there's no other audience."
“Well, alright… but promise me you’ll say no if it’s a problem?” At Draco’s nod, Molly continued: “I know you haven’t practised for a few days, but… please could you sing a song for us?”
, but decided it wouldn't help to say so. "I wouldn't worry too much," he said. "And I wouldn't take it personally. I know you're thinking that they only tried it because of who you are, but
"I've got lots of things on my mind, actually, but it's mostly good," Harry reassured her.
Harry laughed in delight, but then grimaced and grabbed Draco's hand. "Ow," he said.
Harry opened his mouth to answer, but was surprised when Ron beat him to it. "Harry's a different person to the one he was a year ago," he said. "We all know that Harry couldn't stop thinking about Ginny when we were away searching for Horcruxes. I'm still a bit freaked out about the amount of time he spent staring at her dot on the map. But I don't think Ginny's ever really understood the pressure he was under, or what he's been through, so she doesn't get why Harry wants to keep himself to himself these days."
"I suspect I will," said Harry. "Goodnight, Draco."
," said Harry, giving Ron a quick hug. "It might take some persuading."
"I like them cold," said Draco, and Harry uttered a mental prayer of thanks that Draco was perceptive enough to go along with the change of subject.  "I don't often have a full English breakfast, but when I do I always eat everything in a particular order. Egg first, then beans and fried bread – because those three are disgusting if they're a bit cold – then bacon, sausage, tomatoes and mushrooms. In that order. It's very important. And then, if I'm not totally full by that point, I eat toast until I am."
," yelled Harry, and held out a sack, into which all the students' wands obligingly flew. They looked at him for a moment, betrayed, but then burst into applause. He grinned sheepishly.
He’d also decided to move into Peacock Cottage with Draco to see how that worked out: although they knew it was very early in their relationship for such a big step, they’d realised they both wanted to try living together, but keeping both properties available just in case. After a bit of to-ing and fro-ing over which house they’d choose (“I don’t mind, it’s up to you, I’ll be happy in either as long as I’m with you”; “so would I, I really don’t mind, shall we toss a coin?”) Hermione had pointed out that Harry was always saying that Grimmauld Place was far too big for him, and so it would make sense for him to try the smaller Peacock Cottage. (Also, his phone seemed to work better there for some reason, which was a bonus.)
"I think she likes you," said Draco, smiling fondly down at her. "Sadly, she'll still probably run and hide again if I put her down, but that's only because she doesn't often see anyone other than me." He loosened his hold, and as predicted the tabby leapt out of his arms and made a dash for the bedroom.
Harry smiled for the first time in a while. "Sure," he said. "That would be lovely. What have you got lined up?"
? You're kind of my ideal bloke – you always have been, actually."
"There are two things that I prefer about yours," Draco told him. "One is that yours are very clearly actual balls in a dangly pouch, whereas mine are a lot less well-defined. It somehow makes you seem more powerful. Almost as if the essence of Harry-Potter-ness might even be contained in them. ... Of course, it also helps that they're
"We led them round the whole castle, but after an hour or so we headed back here," said Draco. "They were all hanging about at the end of the corridor for a while – Neville went out to check, and he said they were still there twenty minutes ago. But we were hoping they'd assume you'd settled in for the night and go away, and it looks as if we were right."
"You know me too well," Harry admitted. "But never mind me. Are you ready for the match?"
"I was never worried that you'd
"Was it something I said?" he asked it, oddly affronted. It stared back at him – if he'd had to come up with a word to describe that stare, he might have said 'baleful' – and then jumped off the fence and walked along the pavement. Harry was about to give it one last stroke and resume his journey when he realised that the cat had stopped again and was looking over its shoulder at him.

"Oh, I can guess that one," Harry told him. "It probably went something like… Teddy saw Ron last night and mentioned that I was with you; Ron spent all night building himself up to an argument; Ron woke Teddy at the crack of dawn to make him show the way to the campsite; Teddy went home and went straight back to bed. Am I right?"
"Tomorrow night and Thursday night," said Hermione promptly. "Friday is their school concert, Saturday is my works do, Sunday we're at your mum's house, Monday is

"I didn't know you had a phone," Harry commented. He turned around to examine the darkening sky. "Wow, I see what you mean, those colours are incredible. And there's the moon. And… what's that, right on the south-western horizon? Is it a plane?"
"There was an alleyway near the British Library that might do the trick," Harry remembered. "But, listen – why don't you come back to mine? To sleep, just to be clear. Seems like it'd be easier."
"We were hoping you'd say that," Draco told him, grinning. "We stayed up most of the night stargazing, so we haven't been awake long. We haven't had breakfast yet. So any food you've got would be very welcome, please."
Harry burst out laughing. "Can't say I'm surprised," he said. "I did eat a very large amount of that earlier tonight. Oddly enough, I think yours tasted of asparagus."
Draco grinned widely, and Rabia high-fived him. "He was," she said, "and it just shows how good Draco is, that you realised all that without knowing any of the words. There's a narrator – that's the first character – and he tells the story of a young boy being carried at night on horseback by his father – two more characters. The boy sees things his father can't see – that's the Elf King – and at the end the father realises that his son is dead."
"Well, why didn't you say that before?" said Hermione, letting go of his sleeve.
Harry stood up quickly, tripped over his jeans as they fell halfway down his legs, stared at them for a moment, then took them off entirely. Then he shrugged to himself and removed the rest of his clothes. "Lead the way," he said.
Ron held up his hands, which were still joined to those of Hermione and Harry. "You never used to do

"Yeah. And I'd have said to bring a deckchair or something to sit on, but you can use Teddy's. You might want to bring your own sleeping bag and pillow, though – he's quite clean, but you know what teenage boys are like."
"OK, thanks," said Harry. "And did I hear you say you're taking Scorpius out now? I think it'd probably be a good idea if you told him what's going on while you're at it. Albus will want to if you don't, so it'd be nice if he didn't have to go through it all again."
"That sounds... pretty epic," Harry said.
Malfoy stared at him for a while, and then smiled and stood up, holding out his hand, which Harry shook, startled to find that his heart was racing. "Thank you," said Malfoy. "I'm very grateful. I was expecting to spend the year being shunned, at best. When it turned out that none of the others were coming back, I thought I'd have to share with the Slytherin seventh-years, and I wasn't sure how they'd react to me. But none of them has as much reason to hate me as any of the non-Slytherin eighth-years do, so I did panic a bit when I found out I'd have to share with one of you."

"Don't be too sure," said Harry. "I don't think I could have done what you've done since you came back. How long ago was that?"
Draco repeated the last line, and they all burst into applause, but Draco’s eyes were fixed on Harry, who stood up and kissed him.
Harry, who had moved across to the kitchen window to observe the proceedings, felt an unexpected ache in his chest. It was possible, of course, that this was just an occasional delivery and Draco usually went out of the house to buy food, but somehow Harry knew this was not the case. How long had Draco been here, not just living alone but apparently avoiding all human contact? And why?
Draco found himself gradually relaxing over the next couple of hours, as the conversation wandered from topic to topic but managed to avoid anything controversial (although at several points he was relieved that Harry and Hermione changed the subject just in time). Coffee was topped up several times, and cakes were brought out and consumed, prompting a discussion of Lucius Malfoy's baking skills. Hermione was clearly as fascinated by the thought as Harry was; Ron, somewhat predictably, refused to believe it until he witnessed it for himself.
"New Ron has also seen the way you two are with each other, and would find it very hard to believe there's anything wrong there. Although New Ron is still trying to erase the mental image of what he saw that time you forgot to lock your wards."
... his eyes are totally mesmerising... oh, and he looks sort of powerful but not in an obvious way, but you wouldn't want to mess with him'."
Draco turned his head slightly so he could look at him. "Nothing concrete, but I need to do some proper practice," he said. "I know the
"Yes, really good, actually," said Harry. "Although this is the part I've been most looking forward to."
"You already have, by making Harry happy," Molly told him. "No apology necessary, but consider it accepted anyway. I can see you're not the same person you were at school. Now, Ron's told me about your singing, so I'm assuming that the current problem is with your voice?"
he thought. He raised the fingers of both hands to his face and sniffed them. The scent of roses filled his nostrils, to his relief.
"I've never done that before," Draco admitted, as they lay naked under the stars, getting their breath back.
"No, Miss Davies, you may
"Oh, I see!" said Harry, pleased that he actually did. "So did you get it all right?"

Draco squeezed his hand and rested his head on Harry's shoulder. "Given how good you've been at everything else, I find it hard to believe you'd be bad at fucking," he said. "But I can understand why it's a lot more frightening than sex with a woman. The hole is a

"I'd never heard that term before we moved here," said Narcissa, "but yes, it is. It's good, though – not actually greasy at all."
Just in case you have never encountered this song:

Hermione's face didn't change very much at this, but it was enough for Draco to panic, wondering what had upset her. The answer, however, was provided by Ron Weasley, who'd walked into the ward while Draco was speaking.

Hermione smiled knowingly. "Well, you could open the wine while Harry's setting the table," she said. "There's a bottle of Shiraz on the shelf over there that would go nicely with the beef stroganoff. The glasses and the corkscrew are in the cupboard underneath."
Draco found himself applauding. "A badger, eh? That was a very impressive Patronus, though. Well done."
"APPARENTLY THEY HAVE A BRASS BAND CONTEST HERE EVERY YEAR," shouted Narcissa. "I CAN'T IMAGINE EVEN A BRASS BAND COULD BE HEARD OVER THIS NOISE. WHAT DO YOU THINK, DRACO?"
"Smug and sticky, I suspect," Harry pointed out. "But you didn't come?"
them on, actually," admitted Harry. "I don't think I've ever spent that long naked before. It was good, though. We should do that again."
"Your life," Draco told him. "Specifically, what you're doing with it. One of the first things you told me a year ago when we met was that you hated being an Auror and wanted to do something else. And I know you didn't know what else you wanted to do, so we all encouraged you to just take a break while you thought about it. But... well, I kind of thought that you would have made a decision by now. I know you don't really need the money, but your parents' gold won't last forever. And, more importantly, I honestly think you're losing brain cells by not working. I know you enjoy doing odd jobs and fixing things for your friends and family, and I definitely know they're grateful every time you do. But I'm also pretty sure they'd be even happier if you found a new career instead of just drifting aimlessly from day to day."
"Greenwich," Draco told him. "On the south side of the river. This site has several museums and things of historical interest - I must bring you to see the Nelson display in the National Maritime Museum sometime - but this house is called the Queen's House. It was built for the queen of King Charles the First about four hundred years ago. Nowadays it's mainly an art gallery."

Had a bit of crisis of confidence with this yesterday, but I'm determined to finish it. *stern face*
Now, at home for the first time in almost two weeks, Harry felt oddly out of place. It was rare for him to be at home during termtime: he usually slept at Hogwarts. He and Ginny hadn't done anything more than
Harry thought about it. "Erm... since breakfast, let's see... no, wait. I missed breakfast. I was sorting stuff out for while I was gone. So I've had... erm, a tub of churros from a stand in the park, half an hour ago."
He found them, and rooted in the pockets until he produced a string of fairy lights. "Help me drape these round myself," he instructed Ron, who shook his head but did as Harry asked.
"I'm starting to notice a theme in all these lyrics," Harry commented, grinning.
partners with you?"
"Maybe I meant one of those weird kettles that the Americans use, that they heat on top of a stove," Harry suggested, his eyes twinkling. "They don't need electricity."
Draco's face came into Harry's mind – not for the first time that day, but this time he was rolling his eyes rather than looking slightly flushed after Harry's kiss (
They stared at him, and then Hermione grinned and leaned forward to kiss him on the lips. "Oy!" exclaimed Ron.
everyone knew. Are you OK?"
"You're looking much better now," commented Draco. "I see the plaster's off, and I can't see any bruises. What did the Healers say?"
Draco removed his jumper and put the hoodie on. "Hmm, this is really warm," he said, stretching his arms out to examine them. "I might have to get one. Now, here's the thing: when we came into the library, you saw all those girls at the end of the corridor and you put your hood up. So if
Ron looked up sharply and examined Harry's face. "What's happened?" he asked suspiciously. "You always just say 'well, I'm still here'. Why are you smiling?"
Eek! Very short one tonight, sorry, because I fell asleep and only woke half an hour before the deadline :-)
By the time Harry next saw Draco, the sun was setting. Harry was just finishing a large helping of treacle tart when Draco came in and joined him on the sofa; Harry was very pleased to see him, and not just because of the distraction from his current state of mind. He smiled welcomingly, wondering how Draco managed to still look so good after a day's teaching.
"It was," agreed Draco. "Your memories are fresher than mine, though. I haven't been back since the Battle."
Draco felt Harry's arms squeeze him at this, and he leaned his head back on Harry's shoulder. "Well, thank you," he said to Ron. "I'm glad you think so. But now you've created a dilemma for me, because the deal I had with Harry was that we didn't have to discuss my possible return to the wizarding world until
"Nah, we're not fussy," said Harry. "You mean you're going to cook yourself? I presumed you'd have, well, you know." He smiled up at the barmaid, who was collecting the empty glasses from the table.
Draco squirmed a little internally, but sighed and said "I was going to say

"We're fine, Father," interrupted Draco. "That Christmas pudding alone will fill us up till tomorrow, and Harry's already got food anyway."
"I can imagine," said Harry. "So, do you still visit your parents regularly? How are they?"
"You're addicted to Wensleydale cheese."
"Hello, Hugo," said Harry, grinning. He picked the boy up and swung him round, causing Hugo to burst into giggles. Hermione smiled, and after a moment so did Ron.
Draco's parents both beamed and stood up. They walked onto the dance floor hand in hand, where they positioned themselves in a ballroom hold and stood waiting.
"You do

," said Harry. "She only did it once. But all the clothes I had before that were my cousin's cast-offs, and they were all too big for me, and I lost them all anyway. So for most of last year the only clothes I had were the ones Hermione bought me, and I never had the chance to buy any more until this summer – but the one time I went out shopping, there were crowds following me, and it was awful."
Harry was silent as he followed Draco back to the living room, figuring that this was probably the safest course of action in the circumstances; he used the time to take a good look at Draco. He was wearing what appeared to be the same faded jeans from the previous day, but this time with a black T-shirt bearing the words "Runner 5, Abel Township" and what looked like bloody handprints; on top of this was an unbuttoned red shirt. His collar-length hair caught the light from the Christmas tree as they entered the room, and Harry was fascinated by how beautiful it looked.
better, though. Who wouldn't? And when I
Draco blinked. "Of all the people I expected you to still be in touch with, those two would not be top of the list," he admitted. "How did that come about? Also, sometime you must tell me how you managed to start calling McGonagall Minerva, because I'm not sure I'd be brave enough to do that."
The others all sat up expectantly, and Draco grinned. “I thought you were going to ask something really difficult then!” he said. “Yes, of course. I need to practise for tomorrow anyway – I’ll save those songs for you to hear then, but I can definitely sing you a different song now as a warmup. Any requests?”
Draco paused in his bacon dissection and looked at him, seeming slightly uncomfortable. "You know, we used to think it was hilarious at school, watching you eat," he said quietly. "It never occurred to any of us to wonder
Draco's curiosity got the better of him, and he edged closer, to see that there was a woman lying on the pavement, being tended to by paramedics.
This thought led naturally to a daydream of what he and Draco would look like
Ron nodded, and he and Hermione Disapparated.
This will be short, because the deadline is in half an hour... I got distracted by having to explain to someone about the Soulmate Goose of Enforcement and ice hockey players being unexpectedly transformed into hedgehogs... Let's see if we can move Draco and Harry on a bit though!
"Well, bless you for saying so," said Draco. "They're actually all pretty good - well, you've heard Rabia, she's amazing - but yes, I am last. I think it's because they wanted a singer last rather than that they think I'm the best, mind you, but I'll take it."
Ron looked troubled. "Can I have a word with you, Harry? In private?"

"That's a good idea, I think," said Draco. "So
"If they ask you about it before then, though, don't feel you have to hide it," added Draco. "You can tell them, if the subject comes up."
"I only saw you fifteen minutes ago, you idiot," Hermione reminded him. "But it feels like
"Yes, Harry returned it to me after my trial," Draco said, causing several heads to snap up in surprise; it looked as if Harry had not told them this. "I was very surprised but also very grateful, as you can probably imagine. I had not yet had a chance to obtain a replacement, and was struggling  to manage without one."
"They'll only be scared if they
when I see Harry. Although maybe he might quite like it! Now, the question is, what shall I wear?"
"For starters, yes," said Harry. "Then something meatier. And some beer. I'm suddenly starving."
"Shared it with anyone else?" finished Draco. "No. I'm... well, not very experienced, shall we say. I haven't been with anyone since school, and there were only a couple of people even then."
We'll meet Harry soon, don't worry – maybe tomorrow!
"Sounds like a plan," said Harry, wriggling slightly so as to enfold Draco even more completely. "But, back to tomorrow: are you going to go into college or practise here?"
"Yes, and – ahhh! – you're at just the right angle," said Draco. "Now, I'd like it very much if you would consider putting that huge cock of yours inside me. Are you ready to give it a go?"
He'd had every intention of going to see Harry at lunchtime – the memory of the man's bare torso had made him smile to himself more than once during the morning – but, by the time he'd put away the materials from his morning lessons and got out the necessary items for his afternoon lessons, he realised that he only just had time to actually

office in Diagon Alley, where Ginny's boss was waiting for them.
curse, but I can only do that for curses I know about. Although I do know about quite a lot of them."
Harry grinned, feeling his grouchy mood lift somewhat. "Brilliant," he said. "I’ll make sure I’m back in time for that, then. I just popped in to say hello – I need to get back to the office  for a meeting."
"An interesting strategy," commented Professor McGonagall from behind them. As they turned to face her, she went on: "I don't think I would have thought of it myself, but it seems to have achieved the desired objective. I trust you will reward Mr Finnigan and his students appropriately."
On a chilly Tuesday afternoon in December, Harry Potter was walking slowly through a snow-covered park. To a distant observer he would have appeared lost in thought, but in fact he was eating a large (and very unhealthy) tub of churros and struggling to stay awake. He had only left Hogwarts an hour beforehand and would be back there late that night, but he'd had very little sleep the night before; on top of his usual ridiculous workload, he'd also had to make sure he'd prepared sufficient work and left sufficiently thorough instructions for all his students in the classes he was missing. (To be fair, Headteacher McGonagall had not specifically asked him to do so, but they both knew that it would have to be done.)
"Listen, everyone, you're clapping the wrong person," insisted Harry, as the applause died down. "There's no way I'm letting you go without hearing a
"Draco Malfoy?!?"
Draco stood up quickly and then promptly fell back down, tripped by his own trousers, which were still round his ankles. Harry laughed and dragged them off him, followed by the rest of his clothes; he made sure to fold the hoodie and put it on the end of Draco's bed, but grabbed all the other clothes off the floor and flung them into the laundry basket by the door.
Harry gaped at her for a moment, then nodded reluctantly. "I do love her, though," he said. "Just maybe not quite as much as she deserves."
Christmas Eve, we thought it might be nice to do a song that's about love but is also at least a little bit Christmassy, and one of my favourites fits the bill perfectly. Rabia's done a lovely arrangement of it so that I can sing it with the four of them all accompanying, and they all get to show off a bit, but I get the best part, so I'm very grateful. This song doesn't mention Christmas at all, but it's usually thought of as a Christmas song because it was released at Christmas time and its video is very Christmassy. So, to get you in a Christmassy mood (I know Americans would probably say 'a holiday mood', but we'd all be thinking of beaches if I said that, wouldn't we?), here's a beautiful song originally by Frankie Goes To Hollywood, and it's called 'The Power of Love'."
