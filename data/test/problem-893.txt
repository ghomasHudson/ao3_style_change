“What? Listen, you don’t have to hurt me. Let’s just relax. Sit down and relax ‘till the ambulance comes,” Darlene said, backing into an end table next to a sofa.
A year later and he’s away from his parents, away from Pansy, and free to be who he is. Free to take the man he’s had a crush on for such a long time for a drive to nowhere. He drives from his apartment in Capitol Hill down to Columbia City in South Seattle where Harry lives with his music down low lest he overexcite himself. He needs to find out what Harry likes so he can mix it up. Growing up Draco’s parents only ever let him listen to classical music and opera, wanting him to be cultured like them. Things like pop and rock music are a confusing mystery to him.
“Excuse you, I was an evil vampiric puppet of the Dark Lord’s servant at the time,” Pansy said with a scoff.
“Are you afraid of me? I’m sorry. I’m kinda strange. Also, I can’t remember anything,” Pansy apologized.
They don’t say much on the drive. Harry stills wonders what the hell he’s doing there. He was waiting for the part where Draco reveals it’s a joke but as they arrived at the restaurant the chances of that felt like they were fading by the moment. They got their reservations and were seated.
“We’ll have to stay the night somewhere. Maps says there’s an inn nearby. Let’s go there,” Draco says.
“Vic, no judging but I feel like maybe you enjoy this too much,” a man who seemed to be his friend said, slapping him on the back.
“He brought her back as a vampire. A real vampire. Drinks blood. Only goes out at night. Pansy used to love garlic then all the sudden starts freaking out about spaghetti…”
“It was peculiar. They got close then… something happened. And they weren’t here anymore,” Bellatrix said.
“Let’s vote. All in favor of taking this amnesiac baby vamp with us say aye. Aye,” Angelina said, joined by Katie.
She continued to run. She could get to the old woods faster in her car but she wouldn’t be able to fight them off as well. And it was OK. With her power she had all the stamina she could muster. She just need to get to the old woods. Then she could use the binding magic to keep herself hidden and safe. The only thing that truly matter was that her and the others were safe. Someone had to survive to be able to fight him.
Harry’s face revealed nothing, no matter how much Draco searched for even the slightest hint that he approved of Draco’s affections. Draco wanted to run and find somewhere he could hide to rebury his feelings but he knew he couldn’t do that now. There wasn’t time.
“I do. Always have. I never really hated you. I think if I had been more comfortable in myself… things might’ve been different.”
“I don’t think so. I mean we can’t take Bellatrix. But we can’t just leave here without at least finding out if she’s been freed,” Harry said.
A door downstairs slammed open, making Draco jump. There were muttering voices and stomping up the stairs.
It’s true. It’s well proportioned. Hard as steel. Looks very plump and healthy. Harry can’t wait to get his lips on it.
He gets up, entering the bathroom then coming back out with it in his hand. Draco has meanwhile grabbed a pillow to put over his lap, to give things time to cool off. Harry asks Draco about toppings then makes the call. Forty-five minutes later pizza arrives. Draco takes his first slice with skepticism, raising it to his mouth then biting down.
He pulls away, never having felt more aroused. It would be so easy to give in. But he can’t. He can’t.
“We should take her in the house. It’ll be morning in a few hours. This barn won’t be safe,” Angelina said, coming around and scooping Daphne up in her arms.
“I did. I just also thought you were a git.” Harry laughed as Draco elbowed him in the stomach and pulled away.
A little under two hours later, Draco arrived at Grimmauld place with his bottle of wine and a bag over his shoulder. Harry raised a brow at the sight of the bag, and Draco blushed, shrugging that arm. “I, uh, brought your Christmas gift.”
Harry nodded, reaching out to place his hand over Draco’s. The former Death Eater’s descendant had been caught a few months earlier using the Imperius Curse to abuse younger family members. “The evidence collected had been misplaced, possibly breaking the chain of evidence and making it null. Luckily, even though everything was in the wrong spot, the paperwork on that wrong spot was correct, so it should all work out.”
Harry nodded and grimaced, “Yeah, no. I, uh. I just forgot something in my office, and it couldn’t wait until Monday.”
“You couldn’t come to Christmas, so I brought Christmas to you.” Draco nodded toward his office, and Harry followed him over. “I brought dinner, dessert, and some memories of Teddy and gifts.” He set down the bag of dinner and handed Draco the pensive vial. “Do you have time to celebrate?”
Draco leaned over Harry’s shoulder, breath ghosting over his neck for a brief moment and sending chills down his arms. “Does it come with a seatbelt?”
Draco snorted. “Did you see Aunt Bella? Or Great-Aunt Wallburga? They were batshit, and it showed. They all started out nice, don’t get me wrong, but as their minds deteriorated, their clothing choices did, as well.”
They soon fell back into their position from upstairs, Harry tucked against Draco’s side. Harry leaned up, kissing Draco again, just a brush of lips, nuzzle of noses, neither ready for rushing into more or breaking the sweetness of the night. They curled together, faces touching, as the both fell asleep.
Harry whined, his whole body throbbing and leaning toward Draco’s, as if they had magnets for hearts, “That’s not fair.”
Their warming charm finally started to wane, and Harry rolled to his side, head on Draco’s shoulder, face in his throat. “Have I said thank you?”
He stepped inside and hung his robes, turning to greet the menace in question, when he noticed a long, thin wrapped package. A suspiciously broom shaped package.
Harry wrinkled his nose, leaning in conspiratorially. “Honestly, I was thinking of Cedric when I kissed you.”
Ron left about five minutes before Harry had to go back to lunch. “I’ll owl you two about that game, yeah?”
Harry unwrapped the package to find a memory book. Opening it, he found multiple pictures of his parents, Remus, and Sirius and others interspaced with handwritten stories, each one in different script.
She jolted, eyes going wide. “No, though I’m not surprised you are. You’ve both been gaga over each other since, what, first year?”
“He can’t do twelve in one day. He can’t. Oh, who am I kidding. He’s Harry fucking Potter. Watch him do what I did and better.” Smiling, Draco wiped his eyes. “Or at least faster.”
“Some sort of pasta, shrimp, and pesto dish. Kreatcher told me about it, said it went with the wine I found.” Blushing, Harry rubbed his eyebrow with the back of his hand. “I’m still not good at the whole having money and being fancy thing.”
Draco continued to lose their one-on-one games, but he steadily began to improve. He stopped hesitating when flying higher than a few meters above ground, and he quit flinching when the sun glinted off anything reflective around them. In fact, by the fourth game, he found himself looking forward to match rather than feeling nervous about it. He even spotted the snitch first, and had he not all but fallen off his broom in excitement, he might have caught it.
He was sitting quietly, mulling over what the ticket and note and gifts all meant when the man in question stuck his head in the door.
“My father demanded we support Tornadoes, since they were willing to use blackmail and torture to win. I always liked the Bats, though. Their red uniforms horrified father, but that just made me like them more. I bet Hermione would send me to a therapist, too.”
His head snapped up as heard Potter choke on a bite, but the other man wasn’t in trouble. He was laughing. “You? Potions Master and Snape’s favorite? Can’t mix things up following directions?”
Draco’s head bobbed, one hand sliding around to cup Harry’s ass. His tongue swirled around the head of Harry’s cock, free hand running over his thighs, tugging lightly at the coarse hair there and making Harry whimper and writhe.
“I like cooking.” Remus and Harry spoke at the same time with Draco chiming along. “I’m pants at cooking.”
“Fuck you.” Draco spoke around a mouthful of rice and masala. “I can find anything I need. Who cares if others can’t?” He swallowed and pointed at the door. “That was wordless.”
Draco yawned and rolled over, finding himself alone. He stretched, body aching in places he’d never hurt before, but he smiled and twisted again, relishing in the reminder of what he’d shared with Harry.
Draco’s cheeks heated, and he struggled not to smile back. “Snape hated me, really. It just looked good for his reputation around purebloods and Death Eaters to dote on me.” Draco quit fighting and let himself smile. “I did beat his scores on the Potions Master exams, though.” He felt a rush of pride when Potter’s smile widened at that. “I want to learn to feed myself. I enjoy knowing I’m not dependent upon others.” He shrugged, lowering his gaze as he scooped up his next bite. “And knowing that no one is responsible for my life. For keeping my alive.”
“It’s because of my father, isn’t it? The renewed interest in me. I still had lunch at the Manor regularly, so they worried about me being back under control of my father.”
“Then, name the time and day. Like I said at the Ministry, we can be a bit much all together, but we’re here for you.” He clapped Harry on the shoulder then pulled him into a hug. “Now, let’s go eat before George takes all the best bits.”
“So that’s what family is like?” He seemed to catch himself, scrubbed his hands through his hair, and shook his head. “Your family is like. That’s what your family is like.”
“Nonsense. This one’s so caught up in work all the time. I bet you’re just the same. Won’t do.” She ushered them both to the table. “I’ve got a berry crisp for dessert, but I’ll put some cookies on to bake and send home with you.”
Draco heard the deeper question in Remus’s words and blushed, looking down before glancing over at Harry then back down at his tea. “Um, I hadn’t exactly planned that out, yet.” He felt Harry wrap an arm around him, lips brushing over his cheek.
Harry flipped through pictures of his parents’ wedding, a few of his mother pregnant. His favorite was one of his mother sitting in a rocking chair, his father kneeling before her with his hands on her stomach. He was smiling in a besotted way, looking at where his hands touched her stomach, and she was smiling at him, just as smitten. The image moved, James looking up at Lily, and when their eyes met, they both grinned widely. Harry remembered thinking his mother had hated his father after seeing Snape’s memory, but this image proved that was wrong. So wrong. They were so obviously in love that it hurt to watch. It was a good hurt, though, and Harry stared at the moving image until his tea went cold.
Draco nodded, shuddering again, voice hoarse as he choked out. “She used to say that, too. That I was only good for target practice. Before hitting me with a Crucio. I had to learn to stay on guard at all times. If she was in the house, I wasn’t safe.”
Yelping as snow went down the back of his shirt, Harry rolled to the side, taking Teddy with him. Next to them Draco sat up, shaking snow from his hair and making the pale strands fall into his face. The streetlights coming on turned his hair silver, and Harry got caught up in looking at him until Teddy grabbed his face.
“And we repair a Walburga-free wall.” Harry tugged Draco into a kiss. “It’s sexy when you’re smarter than me.”
All that muscle didn’t necessarily make Harry big, more like a medium to Draco’s small, but he was toned and tanned enough that Draco’s mouth watered. He reminded himself that both men Harry had dated publicly, Oliver and then a beater from the Bats, had been bigger built men. And he’d recently been linked in the media to Tamsin Applebee, a chaser for the same team Oliver played on. He shoved those thoughts down before they could turn into blushing or drooling or both.
“I’m going to gain a million pounds, if I do, though. You have all that Auror training. I sit around a lab.”
“You’ve done a lot of that. I mean, you tend to stay in the background of all the charity work you do, mostly putting your face and name out in public as proof that you’re going a different route than for clout, but you’ve made a lot of changes. For you and the wizarding world.”
Harry looked up in time to see the seven-year-old launch a snowball at a lanky figure in dark wool slacks and a heavy coat walking past the park.
“What the? Hey!” Dropping his robes, he started to follow but realized the bird was already around a corner and out of sight. “Dammit.” Running his hands through his hair, he sighed, knowing all he could do was hope the bird came back then wondering when he started caring if any bird came back. His sighed turned to a growl and he snatched his robes from the floor and hung them. “Dammit.”
“No. Fuck no.” Harry slanted his lips over Draco’s, irises blown wide. “I wanna hear you. I want you to scream yourself hoarse and know that I caused that.”
The other man started slightly, one eyebrow sliding up as he expected this to be some massive joke, but he nodded. “Same, Potter.”
His words ended as Hermione stepped forward and hugged him tightly, sniffling into his shoulder. “Not the point, Draco. Not the point.”
Molly motioned them both into the kitchen, broom sweeping away, dishes going in the sink, Ron and Arthur setting the table while Hermione launched into a lecture on her newest plan for Being Equality. “It’s still a bit snug. Not so much since the kids all moved out, but no big manor house.” She seemed to realize what she’d said, and quickly cleared her throat, continuing by saying, “Everyone thinks we should have spruced up the Burrow, what with having come into money since the War, but we didn’t. It’s just the same as it always was.”
Draco had Boxing Day off, but he’d been at work until almost six am before someone pulled him away from the cauldron and sent him home. He’d slept most of his day off, only waking long enough to eat what was left of the Christmas dinner that Harry brought him before sleeping again until time to prepare for work once more. He was still smiling about his dinner with Harry when he arrived at work on December 27th.
“I’m fine sitting anywhere, so long as I’m seeing the game and with you.” Harry squeezed his hand, knowing Draco was hinting where he’d be more comfortable but not trying to push. “But I also don’t mind more space to move around. I get into quidditch.”
“I’ve been afraid.” Draco almost froze at the words that left his mouth. Dammit, why did he keep admitting such things to Potter. “I…it’s been a struggle to get back on a broom, since the…the…fire.” He ducked, rubbing the back of his neck and taking deep breaths. Just the thought of the fire that took his friend’s life made him feel clammy all over, stomach knotting up and skin breaking out in goosebumps. “My mind healer says I should fly more, remember how much I used to love it instead of that fear, but some days.” He trailed off.
Harry met him halfway across the room. “We. We didn’t fake any of it. I was stupid and should have ended the case sooner, should have been honest with you sooner. But I didn’t fake anything.” Cupping Draco’s face, he pressed their foreheads together. “I will spend as long as you need proving that. I will risk my job and let you read all the correspondence between Robards and me for the rest of forever. I’ll do whatever you need to know that I do really love you.”
The two were laughing as they charmed and held their portkey, landing with an unsteady thump near the Weasley’s back yard.
That was over a decade ago, though. Instead, when he dropped his hand from his eyes, he saw concern, mixed with a little apprehension, on the other man’s face. “All right there, Potter?” Malfoy’s hand was wrapped around Harry’s upper arm, the grip firm enough to keep him from falling should he have lost his balance but soft enough to be comforting. Before Harry could process that Malfoy wasn’t taking the piss over his teary demeanor, he continued. “I’m usually the only one here so late, otherwise I’d have looked out for you heading this way.”
Draco cleared his throat and nodded. “I suppose one is years of training and the other is trying to break years of training.”
Looking up, Harry’s gaze skimmed over the table, seeing everyone who used to be there, who he still wanted there. Sirius sat at that end, Remus next to him. Tonks and Moody there. Putting his hand on the table, he closed his eyes, head dropping back.
Potter just grinned and took a large bite. “Awesome. I hate to cook, so I love anything that’s good warmed up.”
Draco’s breath came in quick pants, face pink. “I’ll be fine, Harry. But yes, if for some reason, I’m suddenly not fine, I’ll let you know.”
“I can come back tonight, though. Bring a bag.” Harry chewed his lip one side, the other side curving up into a grin. “I’m off tomorrow.”
They joined Andromeda at the table for turkey and dressing, roasted potatoes, gravy, brussel sprouts, cranberry sauce, Yorkshire pudding, and more. Once they were all stuffed on two servings of treacle tart and Christmas pudding, they headed to the living room for Teddy to open his broom.
Draco’s flush and smile were worth feeling a bit cheesy. Wanting to keep their night from going too dark, Harry nipped Draco’s knuckles, making him gasp, and released his hand. “So, where did you learn to cook? I’ve always wondered if it was like making potions.”
Draco’s chin wobbled for a brief moment; then, he smiled and nodded. Face turning pink as his smile became a grin so wide it hurt. “Yeah. Okay.”
The wrinkled elf scoffed at him. “Great Harry Potter thinks Kreatcher doesn’t know what’s going on in his own home? Thinks food just magically appears with no help from old Kreatcher?”
“All right, true love. If I’m getting Christmas traditions to cheer me up, you are, too.” Going back inside, he sent a letter off with Grinch the floo-called Andromeda, asking for Teddy to be allowed to come over and help decorate. She agreed, and once Teddy had finished his breakfast and gotten dressed, she floo’d over with him. Harry was standing in the middle of the living room, decorations everywhere and a tangle of lights at his feet.
After quickly putting away the food Molly had sent home, Harry double-checked the wards, jogged up the stairs, and rushed through brushing his teeth and stripping down to his pants before crawling in bed behind Draco and wrapping his arms around him. Nuzzling his face into the soft blond hair at the nape of Draco’s neck, Harry murmured that he was beautiful and wonderful and the best thing that had ever happened to him. His arms tightened when Draco started crying softly again, and he continued to whisper all the things he loved about his boyfriend, how much he admired what it took to admit your faults and flaws and mistakes and rebuild from the ground up, to learn to be better than you’d been raised.
Harry turned, cupping Draco’s jaw and kissing him, soft, slowly deepening it until the other man sighed and sank into him. “I know. I still wanted to try. For you.”
After a few rounds through the park, the sleigh changed directions and took them into the nearby town, stopping in front of a shopping center. “Here ye’re. Santa is just inside.”
Harry laughed, shaking his head. “Usually you’re more chipper. You’re far more a morning person than I am.”
“Nope, still Harry. I’ll just meet you in your office. I’ve got tandoori chicken and tikka masala.” Harry walked over to Draco’s office, using a quick wandless spell to unlock and open the door.
He nodded, bouncing over to start looking at the various bobs and bits that were meant to go on the tree.
Draco started to stiffen, expecting a jab at how the mighty had fallen if he’s eating reheated food from muggle places rather than being cooked for by house-elves.
Harry nodded and stood, brushing the snow off himself then holding his hand out to help Draco up. The other man paused for a moment, licking his lips as he stared at Harry’s hand, then reached out, allowing himself to be pulled to his feet. They ended up each holding one of Teddy’s hands and swinging him between them every few steps.
Harry seemed just as stunned, his gaze running up and down Draco several times before he blushed and shoved the flowers at him. “These are for you.”
Draco gasped and laughed, recognizing the joke. “Now, who’s the punk?” He grinned and collected his cup, going to explore Harry’s house, realizing he hadn’t seen much before the entrance and upstairs. Sipping his tea, he circled the living room, looking at the various photos Harry had hanging up: him with Hermione and Ron, him and the Weasley family, with Remus and Sirius, playing quidditch with their regular group. Draco found himself imagining a picture of the two of them joining the rest of these walls, thought he’d like such a picture on his own.
Another hour passed and a familiar otter arrived for Ron, Davies and Cadwallader also leaving since they had early days. Alicia bowed out then, too, sitting with Lee to watch the rest play. The last of them played three on three for almost another hour before Boot and Bones bowed out.
Harry started to blush, but he ended up groaning, head dropping back, as Draco swallowed him down without warning. “Son of a bitch.”
Remus and Sirius exchanged looks before Remus spoke. “I know someone else who forgot to think, once, broke someone he loved’s trust, and it almost ruined something really beautiful.”
“Harry.” Draco’s eyes flickered to him briefly, the fondness in them and his tone obvious. “I spend Christmas at work. It’s fine. I’m not missing anything.”
Draco cleared his throat, tugging at his collar, eyes darting around the table of people now staring at him. “I, well, that is.” He sighed. “Oh, what the hell. Of course, you have my support. And it only set a standard because no one wanted to be known as less kind than the Malfoys.”
Snorting, Draco shook his head. “I mean, I’m not Golden Boy, running about and saving us all.” Harry groaned and threw a bit of toast at Draco, making him laugh. “But I know that my family name has always stood for something, and I’d like it to stand for something good, now.” Draco sighed and shrugged. “I’d like to mean something good.” He flushed as Harry studied him. “I suppose it’s still part of the Auror job to keep an eye on me, though. Well, me, my family, and anyone else who’d been connected to V-Vo-V.” Stopping before the stutter could get worse, Draco cleared his throat. “Connected to that sort of evil.”
Ron nodded. “Well, if it gets uncomplicated, just let me know. Bring him by the Burrow. Well, maybe bring him by mine and ‘Mione’s first. Merlin knows anyone would need a little easing into the chaos of the whole of us.” He laughed, and Harry grinned, something tight in his chest relaxing at how calm his friend was about the whole situation.
Harry stood and stretched, trying to make his way through to the kitchen, but Ron grabbed his arm and hauled him outside.
Harry blinked the one eye he had opened, as if the flowers might disappear. Dropping his hand, he groped for his glasses, which were on top of his head. Once they were settled onto his face, though, he was still staring four sets of flowers. Walking forward, he examined the four bundles. The first he knew were lilies, a large red bow wrapped around their vase, the second were red roses with a green bow around them, and the third were sunflowers with a gold bow. The final vase held small purplish-blue flowers that looked too delicate to touch and had a silver bow.
A few years later, Black mentioned that Potter wanted to create a home for children from abusive families to have a safe place to go outside of Hogwarts. Draco and his foundation stepped in to help find enough land to build a home large enough and allow for space to play quidditch and roam outside. Draco and Neville had become fast friends during that time, working together to create greenhouses and gardens that were meant to be played in, as neither boy had been allowed to do so growing up.
Harry didn’t realize he was crying until his tears falling on the sheet of paper blurred the words. Allowing his head to drop forward, he pressed the letter to his face and cried until he couldn’t anymore. It wasn’t often he let himself cry over the war and all it had cost. He always worried that if he did, if he let himself fall apart with grief and guilt, that he’d never get put back together. Instead, he’d thrown himself into his work, hoping to make the world safe enough now to make up for what he couldn’t stop then.
Harry and Ron nodded, waiting the few moments it took for Draco to return with Theo Nott and Gwenog Cadwallader, a Hufflepuff Chaser from their Hogwarts days. The three of them walked ahead, and Harry ran his hand over his hair, trying to flatten it out. Ron snorted and elbowed him, grinning.
“What the hell, Draco?” Harry drug him inside, casting drying and warming charms. “Are you delirious or something?”
“You don’t perchance mean my darling ex-girlfriend Pansy?” Draco turned up his nose and fanned himself with his napkin, lifting his voice to a screechy point. “I’m sure she’d be
Harry’s lips parted on panted breaths. His fingers going slack and releasing the gold ball he still clutched. His mind flashed back to Draco’s hair falling into his face the night before, the way it glimmered in the streetlights, how badly he’d wanted to brush it back out of his face. He suddenly wondered if it fell across his face like that in his sleep. Sucking in a hard breath, he shook his head, pretty sure that hadn’t been the thoughts his admirer expected. Still.
Confused, Draco picked up a page, his gaze skimming over it as he started to call out to Harry and ask what this mean, but his words died in his throat as he read the notes, scrawled in Harry’s messy script:
Sighing, Draco set aside the vial and pulled Harry into a deep kiss, licking into his mouth with a soft groan. “Yes.”
Harry sighed and made a face. “I sent her an owl just in case.” His head dropped back onto the chair. “She said it was up to Draco.” He scowled, grumbling, “Though she called him ‘Professor Malfoy.’ Like that’s all he was to me.”
Outside of that, he was polite if a little restrained around most people until his work ethic and skill and stopped any snide comments or angry looks. He’d even taken to joining the group for a pint on the weekends, he and Harry having hashed out their differences by coming to blows after a night they were both particularly deep in their cups. After that, though, the two got along well, building a tenuous friendship that seemed to thrive on their mutual competitive natures once they were no longer at each other’s throats.
“Bushes.” The creases disappeared from Draco’s face as he smiled fully. “Blueberries grow on bushes. They’re my favorite.”
Harry bit his lip, brain whirling as clues he’d been afraid to hope fit together started to fall into place. “That’s right. You were related to Sirius. Nephew? No, not if Andromeda is your aunt.”
She smiled, fidgeting, “I’m actually wanting to make sure you’re okay with me dating Ginny. I, well, I love her, Harry. I really, really love her. And I haven’t felt like this about anyone since Cedric. But you’re her family, and I can’t be an issue there. That’s not fair to her or you or anyone else, so I need to know.”
Draco laughed, the sound sleep-rough, and nodded. “Neilson’s Helios Overture. It’s a good morning song and has a soft build. I don’t like to wake up too harshly.” He frowned, continuing slowly, “When he, Vold—, the Dark Lord, and Aunt Bella lived at the Manor, they’d.”
“All right, all right. Give me the letter.” Grinch hooted and bounced over to his treats, chomping them down as Harry broke the seal on the back, realizing he was more excited that the damn bird.
“Let’s go home, Grinch.” The bird popped up, flying three circles around the office before diving onto Harry’s shoulder, nipping at his ear. “Okay, okay. I’m excited, too.” Harry laughed and locked the door, still grinning when he once again met Malfoy at the lifts. “Afternoon. I didn’t think you were scheduled for today.”
Ron snorted, “From who? I know everything you’re getting on our side, and you won’t have that ‘til Christmas Eve.”
“You’re here to what?” The man pushed past Harry and headed for the front room, as he’d said, tree bobbing along behind him. Harry was the distracted by the four other people standing outside his house and pointing wands at it. “What the hell are you doing?”
“Anything you want.” Draco almost swallowed his tongue, but Harry just laughed and elbowed him, seemingly oblivious to where Draco’s mind had gone. “Since there’s no way that will happen.”
Both blushing, they made their way downstairs, Draco lent Harry an extra set up pajamas while he put everything away and locked up. There was a moment of nerves as they climbed into Draco’s bed.
Harry opened his mouth to apologize but ended up stepping forward and hugging Draco, wrapping his tightly around the other man’s shoulders and pressing his face into his neck, inhaling deeply. “My bad.”
Draco hesitated, and Harry began to wonder how he could convince him to agree. “I suppose, yes. If you’re sure?”
Teddy grinned and nodded wide, saying he knew exactly what to get. Shortly thereafter, they headed to the nearest safe apparition point and made their way to Diagon Alley. Holding tight to Teddy’s hand, Harry let the little boy lead him to Quality Quidditch Supplies. They found Draco’s gift pretty quickly but spent another half hour looking around at the newest quidditch supplies. Teddy was just starting to get interested in the sport, and he changed his hair to match every team jersey they passed, making Harry laugh and call him a Weasley when he changed his hair to orange for the Canons.
He nodded and walk a few feet down the hall before looking back at her. “Do I? I mean, as a professor with my own quarters, how do I handle asking someone to visit? If I decided to?”
“I was a case!” Draco’s voice was shriek as he pointed at the papers. “You met me as a case. Hung out with me as a case.” His voice broke on a sob. “Oh god, are you going to write about what we did?” Draco wiped his face as he began to struggle to breath. “Why did…you didn’t have to….for a case?”
Shouting, Draco came hard, vision whiting out, and everything faded away but the continued pressure of Harry’s thumb, the way his tongue seemed to massage overly sensitive flesh as he swallowed.
I am so sorry for the delay in posting this chapter. I had family holiday stuff and some mental health issues making me feel a bit too bleh to do it justice. I'm back, though, and I'm already starting on the next chapter. I think that will be the last one, but I could be persuaded to add more. We'll see.
Draco kissed him again, still just as light as before, then lay back, shifting over to snuggle closer to Harry. He pointed out his constellation, Andromeda, Narcissa, Regulus, even Leo, every star and constellation Harry expressed interest in, explaining their significance and when it would be easier to see some of them.
Harry pulled Draco into a one-armed hug, rubbing his back. “Yeah, but you do have damn good taste in clothes. That much as always true.”
Harry crumpled the note in his fist and let it fall to the floor next to the tub. He didn’t often think back to the Tournament. When he did, it was always the last test. The graveyard. Cedric’s death. Now, though, he remembered that second round. How he’d worried he wouldn’t make it before the gillyweed ran out. The excitement of his head clearing the top of the water. The way the crowd had cheered when they saw him, then cheered even louder at the announcement of the scores. He’d been proud of himself. He’d thought he maybe had a chance to win, and winning was still something good. So much of his life was about good things turning bad. Gaining a godfather just to watch him die. Joining the quidditch team only to be attacked on the field repeatedly. Dating Cho only to piss her off. It was nice to think back on the good times without the spoil of bad, to think of someone watching him with these kinds of feelings.
Harry laughed and nodded, another knock coming. Harry jerked his head that direction as Kreatcher opened the door. “Yeah, but we’ve also got help.”
Harry nodded, relaxing back into Draco’s touch. “I understand. And I’ll do whatever you need, whatever we need.”
Harry could feel himself grow red, and he shifted his weight from one foot to the other. “I mean. Well, yeah, no, I thought you were off today.”
“Yes, Teddy.” Draco laughed, helping him down. “Don’t muggles take pictures with him? Wizarding children do.”
Harry laughed, nodding. “He’s pretty amazing, really. And yeah, I do like him. I like him a lot, really. More than I realized. And I want you all to meet him, really meet him, as you are now.”
“Weight my left ass cheek!” Harry pulled up his shirt, showing off a well-defined six pack. “I worked hard to put on this muscle.”
The next morning, the same grey shower of sleet was coming down, making everything icy and everyone on edge, the same frustrated parents were running around to get their children gifts, and the same annoyed Harry Potter stomped into office. However, before he could close the door, Grinch flew out.
He wrapped his hand around his length, feeling the same callouses mentioned in the note, wondering how a smoother hand would feel. One with long, tapered fingers that ended in carefully manicured nails. Shuddering, he twisted on each upstroke.
“I want to.” Draco nipped Harry’s lips, making the other man open his eyes. “Last night.” He shook his head. “I was still hiding. I knew I hadn’t told them, hadn’t been honest with them. Or myself really. But I’m not, now.” He kissed him again. “I love you. I trust you.” Another kiss. “I know you won’t hurt me.” Another kiss, followed by a smile. “I want this with you.”
Ron’s brow went from dropped over his eyes in concern to lifted almost to his hairline, gaze moving between Harry and the blond before his eyes narrowed.
“I know.” Draco’s hands slid up Harry’s back, fingers digging into his shoulders. “But I need. Is that a problem for you?”
Harry had joined the Aurors rather than return to Hogwarts, and seven years later, he was an assistant head to Robards. Malfoy was a new addition, brought on only a few years back when the department decided to add an in-house group of Potion Masters to help with more sensitive cases. Just as he had at the trials, Harry had advocated for accepting Malfoy as part of the team, pointing out the exceptional scores he’d earned in school and in his later studies and reminding everyone that he’d spent his time since the war working not to rebuild his family’s name but repair what his family had done. The Malfoy wealth and reputation now stood behind ventures meant to build understanding between the wizarding and muggle worlds, to keep the sort of blind prejudice Malfoy had been raised with from tainting the lives of any other children. As a co-worker, Malfoy had applied himself will a steely, compartmentalized focused that led to him quickly being top of his section and an undeniable asset to the Ministry.
Seamus gaped for a moment, then laughed so hard he almost fell off his broom. “You are fit for a git, but I’m still going to need you to find that snitch.”
Without thinking, Harry lunged forward, tackling Draco to the ground and pinning the other man beneath him. The fell with a soft thump, Harry putting his hands out to catch his weight and keep from hurting the leaner man. He ended up with his arms bracketing the blond’s head, their faces close enough that Draco’s breath fogged Harry’s glasses. The same static that had filled Harry’s head when Draco touched his face came back, and he found himself forgetting that he was helping Teddy. Instead, he noticed how Draco’s eyes were a soft blue grey in the fading sunlight, how snowflakes clung to his lashes, the blond so pale that they were almost invisible, the way his lips parted as he panted from the exertion of their game.
Both men laughed, Harry nodding. “I know. He enjoys watching me struggle with things like that. Oh wow!” Harry finished opening his gift, revealing a broom cleaning kit specifically for the Nimbus 6000 and autographed by the seeker of the Arrows. “I didn’t know they were making a kit just for the new broom.”
Swallowing heavily, Harry looked over at the little bird. He was nothing like Hedwig, not in look or behavior. Nothing like her. Nothing.
“Morning, Draco.” The other man raised a brow as they crossed the atrium, and Harry was beginning to realize that was a defensive mechanism, more to buy himself time to think or goad the other person into speaking first. He decided to give the man what he wanted and continue speaking. “How are you this morning?”
“You know, Draco, if you’d spend more time looking for the snitch instead of starring at Harry’s ass, we might actually win this.” Two seconds after his remark, Seamus dove and missed a shot thrown by Ginny.
Draco nodded. “Fourteenth century Germany was the last time it was done wide range, but purebloods kept the tradition up until the early nineteen hundreds.”
With that in mind, he opened his office door, stripped his outer robes and hung them neatly on their hook, then spelled away the cold water clinging to his trouser legs, straightening the charcoal grey slacks as he did. He didn’t notice the owl on his desk until it gave a tiny “whoo.”
Draco knew they were still on wobbly ground, that his own feelings were still tender, still bruised. He had Harry back, though. Had Harry saying he loved him. Hooking his fingers in the collar of the silk shirt and pulled him into a kiss, wanting another taste, afraid he’d imaged how good they’d been together.
“Of course!” His head snapped up, eyes wide, “I’m not lying. I’ve never lied. Not outright, I mean. I tried to avoid talking about work, so I wouldn’t have to lie to you.”
Draco felt his eyes water again and cleared his throat roughly, scrubbing his face. “I might take you up on that. Thank you.”
Draco had always been able to compartmentalize, focus on what was in front of him, but Harry had always been able to ruin Draco’s best laid plans. He gave up on work. Instead, he indulged in his chocolates and waited for the next package.
By the time they were back at Grimmauld, it was already getting dark, and Draco seemed on the verge of tears from how well everything had gone.
Harry looked around at the scatter stacks of paper, the half-empty cups of tea, and the trashcan full of old to-go boxes. “Yeah, no, mine is much neater.”
Harry resisted the urge to laugh, instead helping collect ingredients and take notes as Kreatcher walked them all through making frosting before leaving them to try and stick everything together then decorate it. In the end, there was more frosting and decoration than actual house.
She smiled, “You are, too. And so is Draco.” She laughed when Harry started at her words. “I’ve worked with him recently on a fundraising project, and he’s grown into someone I’m happy to call a friend. If you want to call him more than a friend.” She waggled her brows. “Go for it.” Harry blushed, and she laughed harder, hugging him again. “Thank you for understanding.”
Draco pouted until he heard bacon, then wiggled happily and pushed Harry away. “Yes. Go make me bacon.”
For the first time in a long time, Harry smiled for most of the morning, even sending Grinch over to Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes to has Ron for lunch. The third snitch was there when he got back from that, and he spared a moment to wonder again how someone kept getting in and out of the locked office before unfurling the letter.
“Of course, I noticed.” Harry shrugged, not looking at Ron as they straightened. “I mean, we played against one another, so it was hard not to realize you had talent. And I told you, call me Harry.”
“I didn’t have much a choice! I was naked and covered in ashes and really freakin’ hungry. Look, I could’ve let them kill you last night. Or I could’ve woke up and set fire to this house while you both slept. There ain’t nothin’ for me out there. No one gives a damn about me. The Dark Lord don’t care about me. He’s got tons of vampires working for him. He doesn’t need me. You ain’t got nothin’ to lose!”
“Take off your shirt,” Harry said, leaving Draco on a bed while he rifled through a bathroom cabinet.
Draco grabs Harry’s ass, pulling their groins together. Harry pulls back, eyes going wide as he looks down, whispering, “Jesus, Draco. Is that…? Oh my God…”
“Never have I ever fart while someone was going down on me,” Neville says, noticeably more drunk than everyone else somehow.
“Let’s not ask each other who we consider our best friends, ok?” Hermione says, borderline depressed before saying, “Never have I ever asked someone to spank me.”
“I own some property but it’s out in Maryland. Which is where the address on my Driver’s License is,” Draco said.
As these things go, the walk back somehow feels faster. Harry supposes that’s because they are moving faster. The sun moves from its peak to the beginnings of a sunset as they move back down the trail.
“Olympia. Wow. Yeah, that’s good. Seems like a good time for it,” Harry said, still feeling nervous.
Draco holds their dicks together and Harry again feels like he might come. Every touch seems to do it now.
Harry remembers the bathroom from the night before and seeing what looked like a large pipe in Draco’s tight jeans. Just how big is it? Surely, that must’ve been an illusion. Harry’s watched a lot of porn and seen a lot of big dicks if it’s as big as it looks he’s going to need to take a big dick training course or something.
“Yeah. I could. But I don’t have any cause of my own. I have no memories. No background. No history. I can’t even find out what my last name is. Hell, for all I know my name isn’t even Pansy,” Pansy said.
“Relax! I’m not playing dumb! I’m telling you! I can’t remember what you keep saying. The place. I know you said the name of a town but I can’t remember it,” Pansy said.
“I know. Harry’s the only one of the old gang still there. Everyone left or has disappeared. I don’t even understand why he went back,” Draco said.
“It’s OK. You gave me a second life. It was all I could ever ask for. I’ll be around,” Daphne said, kissing Pansy’s cheek before leaving the bedroom.
“Wait, so you’re telling me you have never seen any movies or TV shows? My mind is breaking right now,” Harry says, sitting cross-legged next to Draco.
The next night they crouched outside the supposed death trooper nest in silent trepidation. The trouble was they weren’t sure how many were actually in the nest. It could be three vampires or twenty. Though it seemed too quiet for a large number. It was an old, abandoned house in the woods with boarded-up windows. They would have to break in the front door.
Harry thought of Ginny. Of Ron and Hermione. Neville. His friends had disappeared thanks to the big mess with Bellatrix a couple of years ago. He didn’t know where the hell they were. He need to track do Meghan. She was the key. But she hadn’t been around in ages.
“All that stuff I said on Tinder. We don’t have to do any of that. I just wanted to be clear. I’m into you either way,” Draco says.
Draco wanted to make a crack about at least expecting dinner first but he restrained himself, instead answering, “All right.”
“So, what do we do now? Just wait to see if the Death Troopers return to kill us? Assuming they really are all vampires,” Draco said.
“Just drink some water. That wasn’t really a lot of alcohol and you drank it slowly. You’ll be fine. If you have to sleep on the sofa you can,” Harry says, rubbing Draco’s back.
The front door had been broken into already so there was no need to break in themselves. After gathering up supplies they need a place to rest and consider what to do next. They had also found a radio that needed batteries in one of the homes they searched after getting limited supplies from Safeway. Draco supposed they could’ve broken into a car but they still would’ve needed keys to get a radio on, and neither of them knew how to hot wire.
They carry on, turning inland. Draco has no idea where they are headed now but he thinks maybe they are looping back up to Seattle. It’s two in the afternoon now. Draco’s expected more complaining from Harry but he’s seemed nothing but delighted this whole time.
“Hey. Sorry, I didn’t think you’d be up,” Draco said, presumably referring to his current shirtless state.
Harry uses two hands to hold the base, stroking while he sucks the wide head. The sounds of Draco moaning make him feel like he could come in his pants if he isn’t careful. It feels incredible in Harry’s hands and in his mouth. It’s not just that it’s big. It’s that it’s Draco’s dick. An extension of him. Of his being. Of his soul.
When Draco woke up the sun was shining through the blinds and Harry was snoring mere inches away from him. He wanted to apologize for not taking his turn at watch but figured Harry was sleeping just fine. Draco slid out of bed. It was the middle of summer but it still felt cold in that house, like the Hollow had drifted into an unexpected winter. There was no heat, no electricity and not much in the way of humanity.
“Draco, I saw two kids I went to school with, murder each other an hour ago in the middle of the road, so you’ll forgive me for finding it easy to accept that Pansy Parkinson who was never exactly the nicest person in the world is working for
Draco is starting to feel buzzed. It’s not as pleasant as being high but it does help with his irritation at having caught up to the others so quickly.
“You’re the right amount of pretty and ruggedly handsome. You just need a little bit of stubble,” Harry says, reaching over to rub Draco’s chin. Draco laughs and swats his hand away.
Draco looked at his wife. She was still the most beautiful woman he had ever seen. He was afraid to leave. He wanted to trace every line of her body to remember how she feels… just in case. As if she could sense his thoughts, she leaned over into a kiss, slow, warm and soft. He heard the TV turn off as Astoria pulled away.
“It’s not bold. It’s honest. What’s the point in feigning mediocrity when you know it’s not true?” Draco says, hands folded in front of him on the table looking very self-assured.
Draco means, crawling over to Draco’s head. Draco sits up and takes Harry’s dick into his mouth, gagging himself on it.
At bed Draco went down on her for a good long time, losing track of how many times she came. She returned the favor and then they finally fell asleep, Draco holding her tightly, fearing what the coming days would bring them both.
“Charlie this isn’t the time. Not in front of her,” Darlene begged but Charlie grabbed Darlene’s arm.
Draco sits down at the table, Harry coming in next to him. Draco puts a finger beneath Harry’s chin and says, “You’re so fucking hot,” then kisses him.
Harry can’t stop thinking about Draco. It started the night he got home from Oregon. He came into the apartment, waved at Ron and Neville, then went straight to his room to lay on his bed and daydream about a guy he sooner would’ve punched in the mouth rather than kiss just five years ago.
“I think Harry Potter is still here. I want to eat him. My Draco was in love with him,” Pansy said, hoping she was giving them a convincing menacing grin.
It feels like he comes forever even though his balls still hurt when he’s done. Draco pulls his mouth off, licking his lips and grinning up at Harry like the proud bastard that he is. Harry can’t bear to kneel any longer and drops down the bed, completely spent.
Draco looked sadly at his wife. There was still guilt in her eyes. It wasn’t her fault that Riddle was president but she had played a small role in his resurrection years before. But only a small one. They both had. He leaned over and kissed her forehead.
Not really a request, though Harry isn’t obligated to obey. Harry smiles and shrugs as if to say, Sure, whatever.
Draco’s phone finally powered on. He was in some town north of Seattle. Everett, he thought. His information said he lived in Maryland. The other side of the country. He poured his backpack out onto the table of the cafe he was in. He’d already looked at some of it. It was mostly nonsense. Ramblings about the president, conspiracies and vampires.
Harry turns around, slowly walking over to Draco naked. Draco is sitting up now and his eyes seem to have discovered Harry’s dick. He’s at least three inches shorter than Draco but pretty thick in his own right. He’s never felt insecure about his size.
“Put our notes together. See what we can piece. Draco… I want to show you something…” Harry said and ran upstairs.
Pansy Parkinson was reborn screaming, a flurry blood and ashes restoring her. She opened her eyes. Every part of her hurt. She was naked and in a dark, candlelit room, several other people standing and watching.
“No, thank you. I would just look like my father when he’s been drinking. When I was younger he would get stressed about work and start drinking. Just an entire week of the old man being irritable and drunk. And of course, he didn’t shave when he was drunk. Only a fool shaves drunk.”
The Hollow seemed quiet. Too quiet, Harry thought as he sat on the front porch of his parent’s house. Riddle had been saying a lot of disturbing things. Stirring up fear, sowing divisions. He was planning something. He made vague references to potential terror attacks. Harry knew that if things went south, his number would come up. He wondered where Hannah and Luna were. At least he knew Astoria was safe with Draco. Harry laughed. He had that backward: Draco was the one safe with her.
While this isn’t a hard trail it certainly is a long one. Draco doesn’t complain, though. Maybe the dick is too full of pride. Or maybe he’s really not bothered.
“Let’s just get the single bed. I don’t think either of us wants to sleep in a kid’s bed. We’re big men,” Harry says.
He looked at his contacts. There was nothing in there. Certainly not a number for Harry Potter. He sighed. There was another word written on one of the papers: Godric’s Hollow, he grabbed his phone deciding to look it up but by the time he had opened a browser, he couldn’t remember the name. He looked again. Godric’s Hollow. Looked at his phone and it was already gone.
. Dammit, his sources had been right. Perhaps whoever was hiding out in this house would be friendly at least.
It has never occurred to Harry to use a vibrator on himself. He’s always thought his hand was good enough but now he’s questioning his own judgment. Draco presses the end of the toy, which Harry has yet to get a good look at, up against the head. Harry squeals and Draco pulls it away. Harry pants, having just been pushed right to the edge and back in a near-instant.
“But you’re going to have to prove yourself. Come with us to the cemetery. You said it’s a trap. Help us,” Harry asked.
Draco felt his heart pound. He had an urge to lean over and kiss Harry. His full lips looked so soft. But he couldn’t do that. He shouldn’t. Not because of Astoria. She understood. But because he wasn’t ready for the rejection. Not yet.
“Darlene. What smells like burning? Who the hell is she?” the man asked, gesturing at Pansy looking angry.
“I must need to clean my ears out or something cause I can’t grasp what you’re sayin’,” Pansy said, exasperated.
Draco takes it easy, sliding it up and down the shaft. His balls feel ten pounds right now, hurting so bad he could cry. It wouldn’t take a lot for Draco to send him hurtling over the edge but he’s careful. Harry is amazed at how much he’s hit the jackpot. A beautiful man with a kind heart, confidence, vulnerability, and a big dick. Harry almost feels like he’s gotten away with something.
The man gestured at the woman before he opened a nearby closet, dumping a blond haired man onto the floor in front of Pansy. His hands and feet were bound by rope and his mouth was covered with duct tape, Pansy examined his face. She didn’t know him.
“Suit yourself, I’m getting some fresh air,” Harry said, heading to the back porch through the kitchen.
“I grew up sheltered. My parents had all the money in the world but they kept a tight leash on me. The only things that were approved were based on what they wanted for me. My father wanted me to play sports so I played sports.”
the things Draco had done, both good and bad to save himself and Hermione Granger. Somewhere in the back of his mind, Pansy screamed and he shuddered before coming back to reality.
“Harry… lately. Have you felt like you’re losing faith?” Draco asked, walking over to Harry, leaning against a counter.
“Hmm… We’d have to touch each other at the same time. I’m feeling pretty satisfied for now,” Pansy said.
Harry gets inside, coming straight for Draco, his full lips enveloping Draco’s lips for a short, slow kiss. Harry’s very touch is better than the finest wine or the richest dessert and Draco’s body responds with the ease of a light switch.
“Look. He’s already going to die. You may as well feed. Don’t worry. He’ll enjoy it,” the woman said.
Harry feels a little embarrassed every time he calls Draco daddy but knowing it turns him on his reason enough to do it. Draco soon climbs on the bed and attaches some leather cuffs to the headboard and to each of his wrists, securing him in place.
I just remembered that time in second grade when I hit Neville in the face with a dodgeball deliberately and you kicked in the balls.
“I can’t believe you’re going to eat diner food,” Harry says as they sit down in their assigned booth.
Draco thought it would take at least four dates, maybe five before he and Harry shared a bed. Not that he has a plan or anything. He’s much too nervous when it comes to Harry in order to have a plan. But now he has to figure out how to make sure Harry knows he’s not ready to hookup without seeming out of character. Draco Malfoy, as others probably see him, definitely is a horn dog only looking for one thing. But Draco as he knows himself has hang-ups and isn’t ready for the disappointment of him and Harry not fitting.
Draco cringes and Harry laughs, patting him on the back. Draco isn’t sure what happens now. Harry closes the door and Draco glances around. Ginny is over chatting with Cho. Hermione is talking to Ron. Neville is still engrossed in his game. This isn’t exactly what Draco imagines parties look like. Growing up his version of a party was getting to have one friend over and it had to be a friend that both of his parents approved of, which weren’t many.
It felt like Draco had slipped into heaven. Harry’s kiss was smooth and confident. He placed a hand on Draco’s cheek and Draco stifled a sob. Hold it together, Malfoy, Draco told himself. Don’t let yourself be weak. Draco’s pants felt tight and he was shaking, wanting desperately to lose himself in Harry’s touch. Harry pulled away. He was smiling so warmly at Draco and Draco couldn’t stop his eyes from watering.
“That’s what happened to my friends. When we first bound you. The magic bounced back and… they were gone. Like they never existed,” Harry said.
Draco admires her tenacity and ability to take charge. Ron is already pulling a game off a shelf in the living room and carrying it over to the dining table right next to the bar. Draco gets off the barstool and immediately feels a little lighter like there’s helium in his blood. He’s warm and loose. It’s nice.
Harry slipped the ring into a large pocket on his backpack then said nothing more but Draco could see that his eyes were wet. Harry was quiet for a minute and Draco didn’t bother him.
“It’s a long story and not what it sounds like,” Neville says as Hermione slams her empty glass down, throwing her hands up in defeat.
Harry doesn’t respond. His brain is turning into mush. His body belongs to Draco now. Draco continues to gently use the toy on him, up and down the shaft. Harry wants to come. He really does. But he can’t. It’s hardly a matter of choice. He can’t and won’t until Draco wills it.
Eventually, she found what looked like an old farmhouse. She raced onto the porch and sighed with relief as her skin stopped smoking. She needed water… or something. A shower maybe. She felt confused. Desperate. She was hungry. So hungry.
What to do? What to say? He needs someone he can talk about it with. Who the hell can he safely, casually just say
“Ok. When I was eleven my parents were out of town for a weekend. And I was a pretty good kid so they had no problem with me watching myself. Ron and Hermione were busy. I don’t remember why. It’s not important. But I got into the liquor cabinet. Served myself some vodka. Of course, I thought it was disgusting but I was curious.”
Harry slid his hand gracefully up and down the long shaft. Harry smiled at Draco’s cock like it were a nice painting hanging up at a friends house. He then pressed his full lips to the head and sucked down. Draco didn’t realize how sensitive it would be. Harry’s lips sucked up and down the head of Draco’s cock while his hand stroked the shaft, almost like a tightly functioning machine. Harry was experienced and it showed.
The next one is the same suit but now he looks almost angry. Intense. He’s holding a flogger or a whip of some sort. Those eyes alone get Harry hard. He thinks if Draco looks at him like that then he might agree to anything.
Draco laughs and says, “Really? All right. It’s a word that you say when you want to stop whatever we’re doing. A way to know that it’s not just part of the play.”
Harry lifted his brows, knowing he’d seen Draco at games in button-ups. Today, though he was in a black long-sleeved shirt with a scarlet Barty the Bat on the front and tight black jeans. Very tight black jeans. Jeans that clung to lean legs that seemed to go on forever before ending at a heart-shaped ass. How did he have legs so long? Harry’s head jerked up when Draco snapped in his face. “Huh? What?”
“Yes. You do.” Draco’s voice was quiet, but when Harry looked over, he was smiling. “Though, you’ve done a good job of cleaning up since you were younger. I’ve seen the crease marks in your slacks at work. Not bad.”
Draco sat, sipping his tea, making a sound of approval when it was the right flavor. “Could be a bit hotter, but mother says I’m going to scald off my taste buds one morning.”
Groaning, Harry shifted the two of them farther back on the bed and lifted Draco’s feet to rest on his shoulders, pushing his legs back enough to expose his tightly furled hole. Draco shifted, whining softly in confusion before giving a shout of shock and pleasure as Harry ran his tongue up the hidden cleft to mouth at the sensitive area below Draco’s balls then wrap his lips around one, sucking. Repeating the action but teasing the other ball, Harry hummed around the heavy sac. He released it, murmured a cleaning charm, then lowered his head again, running his tongue around the pale rim of Draco’s hole. Alternating between sucking and licking, he slowly worked Draco open enough to thrust his tongue inside. Draco’s toes curled, digging into Harry’s shoulders, and he reached down to sink a hand into Harry’s thick curls, tugging him closer as he babbled a stream of
He kissed his way back up Draco’s body, groaning softly as their lips met. “I love you so fucking much.”
“Harder.” Draco lifted himself enough for Harry to shove the tight jeans out of the way. “Harder, Harry. I want your marks on me tomorrow. Want everyone to see.”
Long minutes later, their breathing calmed, and the spunk that coated their bodies and shirts had gone cold and seemed to be sticking them together. Draco sat up and stretched, satisfied smile on his face, and Harry licked a stripe up his throat, making him whimper.
“Have you played Ticket to Ride, Draco?” Hermione asks, sitting down opposite of him, still puffing on the joint like a 1940s femme fatale.
“Whatever. You don’t wanna be here when Lestrange is set loose. I guess if you do kill Potter make sure to send a text to the Master to let him know,” the woman said, the troopers walking away.
“Oh. I mean there’s lots of ways. If you can’t drive there I’d take the bus. Take the 512 from the station. It’s not far from here. That’ll take you downtown in about an hour,” she said.
“Harry, if there’s one thing I can promise you it’s that I will never come up short,” Draco says, looking very pleased with himself.
“Parkinson, you will serve the Death Troopers. And you will do it gratefully,” a tall, older looking man said.
Neville and Cho both drink. That’s the end for Cho. She sets her glass down then wanders off to the bathroom. Harry, Ron, and Neville are running low. Draco still has most of his.
Harry relaxed and Draco removed his hand from Harry’s cock. He kissed the side of Harry’s neck some more and Harry made some happy sounds. Draco wasn’t sure what would happen next but his cock was begging for attention. His balls felt heavy and achy.
Around a year ago his relationship with Pansy had deteriorated. They were barely seeing each other. The bad sex had finally ceased and Draco found himself thinking of his feelings for Harry. He needed to know if this was just some weird fixation or if he really was attracted to men. So, he did what any horny and desperate newly twenty-one year old would do and went to a gay bar. One night was all he needed. He didn’t take anyone home but drowning in a sea of gorgeous men illuminated the lost secrets of his soul. He was bisexual.
“That seems bad. I don’t think skin is s’posed to do that,” she said, running as fast as she could in a direction chosen at random. She could move fast. Really fast. People weren’t supposed to move that fast, she thought. Her skin her
“How about a compromise? In the morning, I’ll make you breakfast. Then I’ll read to you for a while. In the evening I will take you out to dinner and then I’ll take you home in time to get enough sleep for work the next day. How does that sound?” Draco asks.
Harry glances and realizes what Draco has noticed. Harry grabbed Draco’s hand without even thinking about it. Harry smiles and looks away, feeling a little embarrassed. But Draco squeezes his hand harder so Harry squeezes back.
“Welcome to the team. Do as we say, don’t kill anyone and don’t get in our way or we’ll kill you,” Angelina said, pulling her hand away.
A half-hour later the car stops in the middle of a small town east of Salem. Draco just has enough time to turn off the main road to park in front of someone’s house in what is a very nice neighborhood.
She hopped off the bed, undressing before him. Draco removed his belt, then quickly undid his pants, pulling them down and kicking them off at her feet. He removed his underwear while she went over to grab the lube. She climbed onto the bed, covering his cock with the lube then getting on top of him. Draco felt stupid still being in his button-up shirt but quickly got lost in Astoria riding him, his hands drifting up to cup her small breasts.
When it seems like it’s getting out of hand again, Draco pulls back and says, “Ok, ok. I’ll let you go.”
She lights a joint, taking a puff then handing it to Draco. Draco holds it in his fingers like it’s a bomb or some sort of dangerous chemical he can’t drop. Ginny exhales then gestures at him urgently. Draco lifts it to his lips and inhales. Smoke fills his lungs and his coughs.
The shirt is off and he turns around, working his jeans down little by little, followed by his underwear, showing off what Ginny insisted was an amazing ass.
An hour later, Draco decides he’s sober enough. He’ll drive slower than usual just in case. The roads should be fine at 2 am. Harry walks with him to his car.
Harry decides these pictures need a response. He slides off the bed and takes off his clothes. After a lot of maneuvering and body twisting and bending he gets some good shots of himself on the bed, ass up. He sends them to Draco then puts the phone away again. He doesn’t even type any other sorts of reply. He thinks the ass says it all.
Never mind. Draco gives Harry a stunned look as he feels his body responding. It was becoming a game. Draco whispers, “Don’t you dare. Save it. For me.”
“I wasn’t. Oh, I’m sure you’re wondering how I know. I really get into brushing my teeth, what can I say?”
Everyone in the room but Neville and Draco drink. Ginny is looking very distressed at her now more than half-empty glass.
. Holy shit. He opens Tinder, going straight to his matches. He’s had a few before now but they never messaged him back. He clicks on Draco but hesitates. What the hell can he even say?
Harry propels himself off the wall and strides over to the car, looking gorgeous in the morning sun. The bastard doesn’t know how beautiful he is. It’s infuriating. For all his insecurities Draco never loses touch with his worth and knows when to flaunt it.
Draco got under the covers to hide his still very present erection. The fucker always lingers. Harry has a little bit of a bulge but doesn’t even seem to care. Draco envies Harry. He can’t be so brazen in that aspect.
“Not as strange as the things I had written down. Plus this random book by someone named Remus Lupin. I tried looking him up but guess what?” Harry said.
The first time Draco set eyes on Harry he was instantly attracted to him. It had only taken a few weeks. Whoever Draco really was, he had money. He still seemed to exist. He was able to get a hotel room while he searched for Harry Potter. Found him on Twitter of all places. Tagged himself as work in a cafe. Draco didn’t want to seem like a creepy stalker but he’d written the man’s name down a lot. They probably knew each other.
“Godric’s Hollow. All the time. Can’t remember much about it now. It’s like… someone wanted to erase it from the world,” Alicia said.
When Draco messaged him on Tinder that he had made it back home safe, Harry’s heart pounded with excitement. He found himself looking back over Draco’s profile pictures, almost thinking that if he looked at them enough he could absorb Draco into his very being.
“President’s gonna fix that though. He’s gonna fix everything. 'Bout time we had some integrity back in the White House,” the man said.
He wonders how long he has been ignoring this problem. He remembers noticing something a couple of weeks ago but he thought he was imagining something.
“So, you dated Pansy Parkinson for how long?” Harry asks a half-hour later, now drifting away from the river.
Harry thought maybe Draco was a little aggressive in bed but he didn’t know he was this intense about it. And the strangest thing is that… Harry’s kind of into it? Or at the very least he’s not opposed to it. He’s been pretty vanilla in his sex life so far. He’s been thinking the most he was going to have to deal with is trying out anal sex.
Ok. I’m intrigued. No promises but I’m on board for a little experimenting. I’ll try not to jerk off even though you made me so fucking hard.
Sure enough, it’s not until noon while he’s standing around bored at work when he gets a message from Draco.
“Are you going to go now? I just want to mourn and get on with my life. Pretend this was all just some terrible dream,” Darlene said.
It is only a five-minute walk so they don’t bother with an Uber. The inn sits on a corner, a yellow building with red roofs. European style in design. Still, it is only a two-star hotel so Draco isn’t expecting anything too fancy.
“Me too,” Draco said, then tried to pull himself up before groaning in pain and falling to the floor again.
The last thing she remembered, she was in Godric’s Hollow, in Draco’s basement. Draco had realized he could remove that stupid curse from himself and Hermione Granger. Unfortunately, the price was Pansy’s life, for the second time. She was barely twenty at the time and had already died twice. It was all kinda Draco’s fault but… she forgives him, especially with everything that happened. She should’ve just given over the box. Then the bastard wouldn’t have killed her and brought her back as a vampire.
“For giving me someone I can drink from without being afraid of killing them. I was worried cause Darlene is really nice. But you’re a dick so I won’t feel bad,” Pansy said, and ripped him off of Darlene.
Draco knew Harry was special just like Astoria. He supposed he had always known that even back in high school. Maybe not magically special but special nonetheless. He had hated Harry out of jealousy and buried an attraction that had only come bubbling to the surface when they were reunited as adults.
“When I watched porn I spent a lot of time looking at the guys. If I didn’t find the guys and the girls attractive I couldn’t get into it. You know I’d look at them. Check out their dicks. How cute were they? Did they seem like the type of guy I’d want to… Well, you know.”
The entire group laughed at her comment. Great, these idiots were gonna be lots of fun, she thought.
“Are you implying I would say something stupid and horrible?” Draco says, more amused than offended.
“Yeah. So. He sucked,” Pansy said with a shrug then added, “And I’m not a death trooper. I don’t even know what one is.”
Draco ordered coffee then waited for Harry to be done. Outside it was a lovely August afternoon. Draco sort of liked Seattle. Though he couldn’t recall other places so he supposed his frame of reference was limited.
“Everything is better when you’re high. Everything but operating heavy machinery. Or mixing dangerous chemicals.”
Draco sighed and walked downstairs with trepidation. The more things seemed quiet the more Draco feared another sudden surprise, just like in the movies. The front door was still open from when the troopers had bashed it in the night before.
The inside of the house they had found had a limited amount of furniture. There was, thankfully, a bed upstairs so they would have somewhere to sleep. They placed their newly obtained backpacks down on the floor and sat down on the bed. Harry futzed with the radio while Draco pulled a bag of trail mix and a bottle of water from his pack.
“That’s fine. You can just listen. You’re on the wrong side, boy. Don’t know who you are? Don’t you know what’s in your blood? It’s the same blood that flows through me,” Bellatrix said, grabbing Draco’s hand and placing it on her wrist, forcing him to feel her pulse.
Draco finds it difficult to sleep that night. For a while. Once he can suppress his horniness he actually sleeps like a baby, waking up in the morning ready to tackle the car problem.
“They are going to look at it real quick but he says any BMW parts will need to be ordered overnight.”
“Bingo. There is no Remus Lupin. At least not that I’ve been able to find,” Harry said, coming around to sit down next to Draco.
Once he’s home and in his apartment, he checks his phone. He has a couple of messages from Harry on Tinder.
“They aren’t wearing any gear or caring guns. Let’s get them,” Angelina said and they flew out from behind the bushes, swords raised.
“They found his body. They don’t know what to make of it. Christ… I can’t believe you killed my husband,” Darlene said, looking disturbed.
He’s not wrong. Harry feels it twitch in his mouth, a warm, salty stream splashing onto his tongue and down his throat. Harry swallows in time for another blast and then another all while Draco lets out a long, groaning moan of ecstasy. Harry doesn’t stop sucking, using his hands to squeeze it all into his mouth.
“I’m still in Seattle. I’m giving back to the world. I’m married and we’re very happy. We have at least one child.”
Noises had gotten loud back at the house. Pansy glanced back around, seeing more vampires had arrived. Seemed like the others had it covered so Pansy reverted to paying attention to the vampire she’d impaled.
Draco pulls his mouth off and says, “You don’t have to hold back anymore, Harry. Give it all to me.”
Babe? That’s new. Draco feels a little flushed as Harry inhales then passes the joint over to Cho who is reaching over.
“Fuck the master,” Pansy grunted, trying to sit up, not liking the feel of cold and ash covered concrete on her butt.
“Possibly. Either way after a month of searching I’m relieved someone knows I exist. It’s so weird. It’s like… there’s nothing. Except for my house,” Harry said.
Draco gets back in the car and Harry follows, grinning as he puts his pack in the backseat. Music is on the stereo and for once it’s not classical.
“Fuck you. But listen. Last night I dreamt that… we’re exactly where we need to be. I dreamt that someday people are going to come into the very cafe you work at and they will know who you are. And then we’ll all… try to find a way to go home. That place… the one whose name we can’t remember. In my dream I knew it. In my dream we went home… hand in hand,” Draco said.
“Cho. Sorry,” Harry says, coming over to her Draco casually following in an attempt to seem friendly and personable.
Everything in Draco’s apartment is perfect. Neat. Controlled. Not much color. Black. White. Brown. Everything looks expensive but not so expensive Harry is afraid to touch anything. It doesn’t matter. Harry’s more concerned with the man himself, sitting down on his sofa and sipping something. Maybe water. Probably water.
“Yeah. But I still had some lingering feelings for her. Not a lot but some. Enough. And anyway… she was doing some pretty bad things and I was afraid she was going to kill someone… Someone I really cared for. She was making promises. She said she was going to kill you. Ginny. Hermione. Ron. Neville. I wanted to believe she wasn’t serious. I wanted to believe that she just needed time to adjust to her new identity. But when
The morning was hard. Astoria tried to act calm but Draco knew she was afraid. So he was he. He was probably more afraid than her.
It’s a conundrum. His entire demeanor is off-putting but there is no denying he is physically and sexually attractive. His model good looks, vague androgyny, and over-abundance of confidence are a powerful combination. But what does Draco even want? Is he genuinely interested in Harry or does he just want a hook-up? Harry isn’t sure what he wants himself. Maybe a hook-up would be best. Get whatever this shit is out of their systems then go back to their own lives. But there’s something about Draco that Harry can’t shove aside.
Draco looks at Harry. There’s something sad in his face. Harry likes big dick Draco and he likes sensitive Draco. He likes them both a lot. He kisses him, unable to hold back any longer. It’s nice for a moment but Draco pulls back.
That was funny. Remembering killing Charlie made her happy but thinking about hurting a wolf made her sad. She supposed that meant she wasn’t a complete monster. But Darlene had seemed pretty disturbed even though really she was doing her a favor.
Just like Draco, Harry wasted little time. They weren’t making love and they were barely even fucking. Draco didn’t know what it was. It didn’t mean much but it meant something. It made him feel alive. If they could survive the end of the world then maybe there could be more. So much more.
“It is. But that’s how most vampires do it. Luckily those bonds can be broken,” Angelina said, kicking the door open as they rushed Daphne inside.
Draco gets off the bed. Harry turns to watch as Draco fully strips. His dick doesn’t look like it’s the slightest bit softer. Somehow it looks bigger than he last remembers. Maybe that’s just the reaction he’ll always have. Every time he sees it will be like the first time. When you’re swinging a big bat you always look primed for a grand slam.
The voice stirred Draco out of his sleep. Harry was already leaning up and turning the volume up on the radio. He couldn’t be certain what time it was but it was still very dark out.
Draco sighed. He could tell him now. What was the harm? The world would be over soon. What did anything even matter anymore?
The dick is consistent, Harry will give him that. Oh, but he had softened in Oregon, hadn’t he? It’s obvious now that Draco cares a lot about appearances. Harry supposes that he can reconcile both sides of Draco as a solid sign that he has layers. He prefers the sensitive, vulnerable Draco but has to admit that bantering with the dick gives him a little thrill.
Draco is nearly laying on top of Harry, Harry’s hands feeling Draco’s back as they drift down to his ass. There’s not really room for the two of them to be maneuvering but that doesn’t stop them from trying. Harry is pressed back against the passenger door, worried he might accidentally fall out. He guides Draco back, their lips still joined. They finally part and Harry catches his breath.
Draco steps out of his car. He’s nervous. Maybe the most nervous he’s been since he and Harry started dating. But tonight he’s going to be large and in charge. The chosen vibe for the night is hot, confident, but chill. This crowd won’t go for his usual dickish charm. He’s gotta let the walls down and make sure they know he’s not like that anymore. But at the same time, he wants everyone there to have no doubt at all that he’s a fucking catch and that Harry had definitely scored the big one.
“All the time. But I learn to tune it out. It comes from the basement. I don’t like going down there. It feels weird,” Harry said.
“She’s at home. Our other home, I mean. Maryland. I’ve been trying to text her but… there’s been no response,” Draco replied.
“OK. Maybe a little evil. But we have to eat! It’s just like humans with meat. They kill so they can survive. But, but we don’t kill! We keep them alive,” she insisted.
“Terrible. She’s going to get killed tomorrow night,” Alicia said, swinging for Pansy who dodged out of the way rather than parry.
“Not everyone has forgiven you for being such an asshole and helping to raise the Dark Lord in the first place,” Harry said, tilting his head and smiling.
“I live in Capitol Hill. I just like this spot. I didn’t really know where I was going, I just knew I would know when I was there.”
“Well, she’s back now. And you saved Hermione’s life. You did do the best thing. I suppose if I’m being honest, I might not have gone along with that if you’d asked me. I don’t know. I’m glad it’s not a choice I had to make,” Harry said and he placed a hand on Draco’s shoulder again.
“On another level of the dream,” Draco said, sighing as he squeezed Harry’s hand, the sun just beginning to disappear behind the mountains.
Draco softly chuckles and opens the door. Harry comes in, locking the door behind him and tackling Draco against the bathroom sink, mouth hungrily on Draco’s mouth.
Harry’s glad he went ahead and told Ron and Neville about him and Draco so that he doesn’t have to worry about them seeing this. He knows they probably don’t approve but he thinks if they can get to know him now they’ll change their mind.
“No. It was fine when we were young but as we got older and hormones kicked in things got worse. She wanted to get married and have kids as soon as possible. I really didn’t want that. As I was starting to… become less of a dickhead, Pansy wasn’t changing.”
“You could save me… if you wanted. They told me they could… they would. If I just played nice and let them keep doing whatever they wanted. They’d reward me,” she said.
Draco hasn’t even realized how drunk he was until that very moment. This is why he doesn’t drink. He follows Harry into the kitchen and gets some water. It’s really hitting him.
“Draco. I don’t know if you noticed or not… but you have… a really nice looking dick,” Harry says, reaching a hand around it. His fingers touch, but barely and his fingers are long.
Draco hoped Harry was right. He had never gotten along with the Weasley family but he meant them no ill will… and that they mattered to Harry was good enough.
When Draco stops, tears are streaming down Harry’s face. A little from pain, a lot from pleasure. His dick remains rock hard, a fact Draco learns when he reaches under Harry to grab it. He strokes Harry and says, “You were so good for me but I’m not done with you. I want to tease you like I promised.”
Pansy struggled to get to sleep. She already missed Daphne. She thought of inviting Alicia into bed. Not for fun things like all that. Just to lay and talk. She’d enjoyed the fun things with Daphne but mostly she enjoyed what came before and after. Just talking. Bearing their souls. Trying to fill the emptiness within. It was all… so much. She missed the sun. Which was strange as she’d never known it.
Draco kisses him then steps back, putting his dick back in his pants and zipping up before leading Harry to the bedroom. The more confident and aggressive Draco gets the more Harry wants him. His whole life Harry has always felt the pressure to be in charge and lead the way. It’s good to surrender power.
Astoria was crouching in her dining room, trying to peer out the window, hoping to see without being seen as she lifted up the curtain. She looked out. The men were still out there. They had been there since the sunset.
Draco is stunned. He sighs and takes a drink, along with Hermione. It tastes terrible and he grimaces. Ron bursts into laughter.
Harry turns off his phone and sets it down. He wants to jerk off pretty badly. Maybe even look at some porn and fantasize about Draco but he really needs to get to work. He doesn’t think he’ll hear from Draco for a bit. With frustration, he forces himself to get moving.
“I believe you. Thank you. I think I’m gonna go lie down,” Pansy said, touching Alicia’s hand before she left.
“No. Draco, no.” He came around the table and cupped Draco’s face, wiping his cheeks. “You’re smart and sweet and sass me and have always seen me as more than a savior or whatever. You know I’m moody and push people away and work too much, and you’re just the damn same. Just as stubborn and desperate to prove yourself. I’m not the Boy Who Lived. You’re not a Death Eater. I’m Harry, and you’re Draco, and I…I think I’m falling in love with you.”
“I agree on that last part. You’ve worked yourself far too hard over the last seven years, especially given how hard you worked the previous seven.” She smiled. “And Teddy and I love to see you. I haven’t asked so much lately because it’s felt like you, well, like you wanted the distance, needed it maybe. If that’s not the case anymore, I’m more than happy to give all the time with Teddy you’d like.”
“Harry.” Draco growled and twisted them, switching positions so Harry was the one against the desk then dropped to his knees.
“Harry, please.” One foot skidded across the sweat on Harry’s back as Draco’s entire body writhed. “I want…I want more.”
“Snobbery does come with a price. Marrying your cousin. Children with extra toes. Following the Lord of the Idiots into battle.”
The Burrow was chaos, and Harry loved every minute. There were more redheads than he could count, and Little Fred was wrapped around his neck from the minute he walked in. He circled all the rooms, hugging everyone and asking if Molly needed help, only to be shooed back into the living room. He dropped onto the couch, squeezed between Percy and Charlie.
He’d changed his hair three times. First styling it into a fancy pompadour before deciding he looked pompous. Then slicking it all back before gagging at how much he looked like his school year self. He mussed it up afterwards, hoping for a shaggy-chic style but thought he looked more like he’d just rolled out of bed.
Sirius laughed softly, hugging his fiancé. “For starters, he apologized. A lot. Then, he learned to think and act like someone with a future and something to lose.” He laced their fingers together, kissing the ring that showed their promise to each other.
Draco and Harry had been spending time with each other for months, but they were finally going on their first official date. Before leaving Remus and Sirius after dinner the a few nights ago night, the third time they’d visited together, Sirius had asked just how long they’d actually been dating. Harry had responded, “Since June, really,” at the same time Draco said, “We’ve never gone on actual date.”
Harry laughed, nuzzling Draco’s cheek. “I’m sure you’ve that, too, but I just meant you in general.” He interlocked their fingers and continued walking, tugging the stunned blond along. “We should have dinner at their place later this week. I mean, if we both hang out with them, why not together?”
“It’s useless against you guys without a beater.” Bones shook sweaty hair out of her face. “The two of you are unstoppable. Good to know you’ve got a backup career if you decide Ministry work isn’t for you anymore.”
The response the day before had come back almost an hour after he’d sent his question. It had taken so long that he’d begun to worry the little owl was lost or that his admirer had deemed the whole thing suddenly too risky. Instead, right before lunch, Grinch had fluttered back in with another note.
“They threw me out.” Harry froze as Draco continued. “Said I had to choose between loving you and being their son, but…” He shook his head, “That’s not fair. That’s not a choice. I should be allowed to love whoever I want.” He swallowed, tears running down his cheeks. “I should be allowed to love you.”
“If I was alone, it would have. Okay, let’s have some lunch. Teddy, frosting is not lunch. We’ll see what’s planned after that.”
“They?” Draco’s voice was barely over a whisper because he knew it would crack and shatter if he tried to speak up. He found himself subconsciously moving toward Harry.
Harry sank one finger into Draco’s ass as he resumed jerking them off, and Draco moaned loudly, the sound becoming a litany of begging and pleases and mores. Harry’s mouth fell open as he watched his boyfriend’s lithe body writhe rhythmically, flush covering his face and moving down his throat to disappear into the top of his shirt. Harry had the sudden urge to rip the shirt off, wanting to see the way Draco’s nipples would flush as the blush reached them, but before he could wrap his brain around how to do that without stopping touching the other man, Draco went tense, arched, and cried out Harry’s name over and over as his release striped both their shirts. The way his ass clenched around Harry’s finger, muscles milking it with every shudder that wracked his body, made Harry’s brain short out. He lifted his hips, rocking upward until his own release hit, and he yelled Draco’s name, wrapping his arms around his boyfriend and crushing him close.
That night, after wrapping his gifts and dinning on leftovers and the last of his fancy wine, Harry went to bed in his potions socks. He couldn’t help thinking about his admirer, their notes, the clues. Someone who was with him in school, all seven years to have been able to plan those socks. And even the idea of getting him socks, that bond with Dobby. They worked with him, knew when he’d be shopping. Were cousins with Sirius. He fell asleep smiling, thoughts of soft smiles, soft grey eyes, and soft touches filling his mind.
Harry gaped. Malfoy was taking the blame? Malfoy, whom he’d just walked into, knocked off balance, was taking the blame for their collision.
Harry sat on the edge of the desk as he skimmed the short note again. His Firebolt had been a Christmas gift from his godfather, so to have another broom at this time of year turned something over deep in his belly. And to be opening it with Ron again, as he’d be there any minute. Harry laughed, remembering how Ron had been almost more excited than he over than Firebolt.
He groaned as the warm water enveloped his body, relaxing his muscles. He closed his eyes and dropped his head back, letting himself breath in the sweet musk of his bath. Once he’d sat for a while, he looked at the note.
Harry came with a groan, teeth clenching, imagining a long, pale throat between them, the hitch of breath he’d heard this morning when he reminded Draco to call him Harry. He wanted to hear that voice moan his name. Moan the word yours.
Harry ran his hand down Draco’s chest and stomach, word-and-wandlessly popping open the buttons on both the waistcoat and shirt, letting him nip at the jut of Draco’s collarbone. “I want to taste every angle of your body, lick all that sharpness right off you.”
Harry and Draco made plans to meet up for breakfast again the next day so that Draco could try pancakes. They weren’t as good as waffles, but he did like them, and since they didn’t involve buying a new machine for his kitchen, he could start trying to make them at home.
Harry paused, tapping the end of his quill to his cheek as he tried to formulate his thoughts, not sure how much of himself he wanted to put in a letter that was going to what could be a stranger to him.
“It’s just hard to feel all this? It’s a struggle to sort out who you are and how you feel about yourself from what you were told growing up?” Draco stopped moving away, and his hand dropped. Harry’s mouth twisted to one side, and he shrugged. “I’ve done this, too, you know. I’ve been there. I don’t want you to go home. Both selfishly because I don’t want you to leave me, but also, it’s harder to do this alone. It helps to have people around, to lean on someone who loves you.” Draco made a sharp, cracked sound, and Harry stepped forward, wrapping his around his boyfriend. “Let me take care of you, okay? Don’t make my mistakes.”
“Fuck, baby, you’re so beautiful.” Harry murmured another spell as he slid his fingers down Draco’s ass, pressing them against him until he found his hole. When Draco widened his stance to allow better access, Harry nipped his ear, growling. “So needy for it aren’t you?”
Malfoy’s eyes went wide, the grey standing out starkly as his face went pink. Harry grinned, inordinately pleased at making Malfoy blush, and this time, he held the door as Malfoy had to collect himself before exiting. They crossed the atrium side by side, and Harry grinned over at Malfoy. “I’ll see you Monday. Have a good weekend.”
Draco woke Harry with his mouth around the other man’s cock, and by the time they’d stumbled through their shower where Harry dropped to his knees to return the favor, they were running late.
“Ow! Okay, that was your fault. What the hell?” The bird hopped over the discarded message. “I have work to do. Important, possibly life-saving work. Whatever that is will have to wait.” Grinch made a noise that sounded like he was trying to scream at Harry, a nails-on-the-chalkboard sort of croak. Harry set his back teeth. “I said no. And that’s final. Now, eat your treats.” Grinch sat on the letter. “Fine. Don’t eat them, then. Do whatever you want. Nest in that damn message.” Ignoring the owl as best he could, Harry sorted through his morning task list only to find there was nothing all that time consuming or pressing. Not wanting to admit defeat to a bird, he made a big show out of sending several airplane messages to others in the office to double check that things were as calm as they appeared. They were. He went and made himself another cup of tea. Pretended to read the paper while he drank it. Then finally gave in.
Once the letter was finished, Draco said, “Now, what my mother had me do, when I was little, was fold it up, like this.” He helped Teddy start to carefully crease the paper into an intricate pattern. “Then, you’ll have a little pouch 0n the front. You put a pinch of floo powder in the pouch, write Santa on the front, and toss it into the fire.”
He should touch Harry back. He should kiss Harry back. He should, oh fuck, his body lifted helplessly at the scrape of teeth over his sensitive nipple, thought splintering and exploding as he cried out.
Harry shook his head and rolled to his back, pulling Draco across his chest. “Don’t. Everyone is different. I regretted my first time, with a girl and a guy. Both times, it felt like I was just having sex because it was expected. It was different when I felt right, felt ready. I’m happy to wait until you’re ready.”
They were kissing again when they landed in Harry’s bedroom, and Harry backed Draco into the bed, both tumbling over onto the large bed. Draco whimpered and arched, gasping as Harry’s mouth broke from his to trail down his jaw and throat.
“Can’t imagine that would be.” Draco’s words are drawn out slowly, hesitant, like he wasn’t sure why Ron was telling him this, and honestly, Harry was just as confused.
“Yeah, I mean. I’ve spent most of my time on redoing the inside of Grimmauld, just cleaned up the yard and sort of left it.” Harry took a breath, latched on to his Gryffindor bravery and damn-the-torpedoes attitude as he continued speaking more rapidly. “I wanted to do more with it, but I didn’t know what, and I was always working. Why not get a gnome? Build a rustic garden? Put in some berry…patches? Vines?”
The morning after their date, Draco awoke curled on his side and snuggled against Harry’s chest, head tucked under the other man’s chin as he lay spread eagle on his back. Draco shifted, not sure what time it was or if they needed to be up. Harry made a soft noise in his sleep, arms wrapping tighter around the blond. Smiling, Draco nestled closer, letting himself drift back off to sleep. Life could wait a while longer.
Draco’s lips clumsily kissed Harry’s neck while his hand slowly stroked Harry’s cock. He knew their time was limited but he wanted so much to savor this moment because he knew what might happen next.
They come to a bridge over the Middle Fork Snoqualmie River. It’s a bit of an arch, a sturdy bridge made of wood and metal. Almost seems too modern out here.
“I didn’t feel it would be right to… Well, to go any further without making my peace. I know I’m a piece of shit. I know I don’t deserve your forgiveness.”
. He runs through everyone he knows but every suggestion is worst than the last. It’s no use. He’ll have to brave it alone. Who knew the biggest dick Harry has ever known would have the biggest dick he has ever seen? He’s been calling him the dick all this time. How appropriate?
Harry came down the stairs and sighed, a backpack slung over his shoulder. Draco hadn’t noticed that before. He supposed it had been too dark last night.
Harry realized he’d forgotten why he had even came down to the kitchen. He’d told himself he was hungry but if he was being more honest, he’d just heard Draco was downstairs.
“The hell you did. Good God, Darlene. You really don’t respect me one damn bit,” Charlie said, marching over to Darlene.
“You don’t seem any less tired than me,” Draco said, scooting himself over on the bed and laying his head on a pillow.
“Don’t be. I just wanted to make sure,” Harry said then rolled over to face Draco with a smile on his face.
Draco bites his lip, making a low growl as he stands, pulling Harry to his body, big dick pressing into his stomach. Draco leans into Harry’s neck and bites.
Suddenly, there were voices and the sound of someone banging at the door. Draco felt all the blood drain his face and his heart began to pound in terror.
“Tell me about it. I mean don’t get me wrong, I love animals and I guess it beats flipping burgers. But I want to do something meaningful with my life. Something that matters. I want to help people.”
Harry nods and goes out. Draco takes a deep breath and follows, wishing he were suddenly wearing looser jeans. Everyone seems distracted though. All Draco can think about is getting Harry back where he was, pinned against the sink. He sits back next to Harry, sliding his hand onto his thigh, not wasting any time. Harry shifts uncomfortably in his seat, looking at Draco helplessly. Something about his face says that if Draco wanted he would let him jerk him off right there under the table. Draco looks into Harry’s green eyes and smiles. Harry makes a soft sound, almost like a whimper, and swallows. Draco bites his lip and removes his hand, thinking that leaving him to stew is better torture.
“There’s no reason to think Potter was here. And the supposed sighting of Malfoy was probably a false sighting. There’s no way he’d come back here. He’d have to be a fool,” the woman laughed.
“I don’t know. If there are any other survivors they might be headed there too. Draco, there’s something about the Death Troopers… I don’t think they come out during the day. They showed up just after sundown,” Harry said.
“I’m sorry, babe. You know you don’t have to stay. You could go with her. We’d miss you but… you could go,” Alicia said.
“Every vampire. All of them. Every vampire who ever walked the earth. Of course, some didn’t agree to help him and lots are in other countries but who cares about them anyway. Most of us American vampires agreed to work for him. And I agreed too. At least I said I did. Bloodlust is a hell of a drug. I wasn’t in such a good mood on account of going to hell or whatever. But then… last night… I saw the two of you in the closet… Well, I guess I still kinda love you, Draco, if even you killed me and sent me to an unbearable hell,” Pansy said, her voice sounding sincere.
“Because there’s nothing we can do about it,” Draco said, sitting beside her then adding, “Not yet.”
“But there’s a lot we can still do. If you want. All those things I said… I haven’t done most of them. When I asked Pansy to call me daddy she laughed in my face. They are fantasies. You’re realit.”
“Been tryin’ to forget,” Pansy laughed, then quickly swiped with her sword, lightly cutting across Alicia’s cheek.
Their pancakes arrive, they eat, and hit the road again. Olympia flies past and they are well on their way to Oregon. It’s a peaceful drive. They roll down the windows and Draco puts on Debussy, a beautiful composer for a beautiful day.
Don’t be. We should’ve broken up years ago. So, what about you? How has your dating life been? Didn’t marry Ginny Weasley, I see.
“I just need to go to a town. Or a city,” Harry asked then pulled out his wallet and added, “I can pay.”
“So, we’re thinking… Godric’s Hollow has been like… wiped off the map. But how come we can still remember it?” the shorter black woman said.
For a moment they get lost, mouths moving together while their hands roam. Draco pulls away and says, “I want you to get on your knees in front of me. Pull it out.”
“Actually, in Anne Rice’s books Lestat had superpowers and stuff. It was pretty ridiculous,” Angelina said.
Harry privately snickers as Draco pulls out of the parking lot and onto the road. It’s an hour-long drive to get there. Something about the music and the drive makes Harry flashback to middle school. What if he and Draco had started dating back then? It’s a strange thought. No. It’s good that it’s happening now.
“Shit. This means he’ll go after Godric’s Hollow. He’ll come after Harry,” Astoria said, touching Draco’s hand.
“Me too but that’s not what I meant and you know it. Run off with me. These ladies don’t need us. They’ve taught us everything we need to know. We know all their contacts. We can survive. Help me. Help me find my sister,” Daphne said.
“Not you. It was someone else and I promise the sex with the partner in question was terrible and he didn’t care anymore,” Ginny says.
They blew through Downtown and finally ended up in Queen Anne, parked up on a big hill overlooking Downtown. Draco turned off the car and exhaled.
Draco throws his arms around Harry and they kiss. Harry’s lips are very pleasant indeed. People think kissing is odd but Draco understands it. The lips are quite possibly the most sensitive part of the human body. And they are soft. The feeling of something so bounteous and supple as Harry Potter’s lips sliding against Draco’s lips is a sensational delight. Criminal in its decadence, making Draco feel like a man who is getting away with something. Anything this good should be illegal.
Draco goes over to the bar where Ginny and Cho were chatting and sits down there but around the corner so it doesn’t seem like he’s invading. Harry joins him, giving him a kiss before he sits down.
“Who decides who does or doesn’t deserve something? Besides, I seem to recall beating your ass over most of that.”
“There’s a pond. When it’s warm I go for a swim. Naked. Eventually, I marry and we have a blissful relationship, living on the land being one with nature.”
He feels a little exposed from the night before. A little bit of a shame from having dug too deep inside himself. The whole day had been a test and Draco thought he handled it well.
There wasn’t much left of the Weasley’s old three-story home, just a hollowed out frame. Harry’s green eyes roamed over the ashes with grief on his face.
He ordered eggs, bacon and pancakes while he sorted through his backpack. He had a cellphone and a charger in there. He would have to find a plug somewhere. After he ate. He had keys too, unsure what any of them went to. He looked his Driver’s License again. The address did say he lived in Seattle.
“What’s your name? Do you want me to call an ambulance? It’ll take them a while to get out here,” the woman said.
Draco does the other cheek but Harry is ready that time. Draco repeats with both cheeks, harder and faster. It’s nothing.
“Darlene. That’s cool. You look like a Darlene. Hey, listen, why is your heartbeat so loud?” Pansy asked.
“Nothing? How can it be giving me nothing?” Draco said, grateful this cafe was loud enough to drown him out.
“Yeah, whatever,” Bellatrix said then flew at Draco, in a flash having a silver dagger at his throat.
“I understand. You have my cell number at least. Call me. Or text me. Just… let me know how you’re doing,” Daphne said and slid out of bed.
“But it is. Sort of. I had felt things for years that I dismissed. I always checked guys out. Without even thinking. I just thought it was normal. I thought it was normal to walk down the street and check out one girl’s boobs then the ass of the guy next to her. And when I… God, this is embarrassing…”
The two of them sat on the sofa, inches apart, watching some nature documentary about wildlife. Harry could feel himself growing tired, his head leaning towards Draco’s shoulder. Draco’s head touched the side of Harry’s head, guiding it all the way to his shoulder.
Draco is furious, mostly at himself. He should’ve stopped as soon as something seemed wrong. Now he has fucked everything up. Harry comes over and calmly says, “Try to breathe. Call a tow truck to take us to a mechanic.”
“Definitely. I’m trying to remember how many of my friends were still in town. Ron and Hermione disappeared. Ginny, Luna and Neville too. Remus and Sirius… they’re all gone,” Harry said.
Draco smiles. Once they are out of Tacoma they pull into a diner right off the interstate for lunch.
Harry thinks. He knows what he wants to say. He tries to think if there’s any good reason not to say it. Nope. None at all.
The man rambled about politics for the entire hour it took to get to Seattle. The man let Harry out at a diner he insisted was great as long as Harry could ignore all the stupid liberals. Harry was glad to be rid of the man. His stomach rumbled as he entered the diner, called Beth’s. There was artwork, appearing to have been drawn by customers on the walls inside and the most wonderful smell of breakfast.
You want to know what I intend to do to you? I want to strip you naked. I want to put a collar and leash on you like a dog. I want to tie you up and flog you. I want to test that gag reflex you claim not to have. I want to use toys to get you to the very edge of orgasm but not let you cum. I want to draw it out for hours until you beg and cry for me to let you finish. I want you to call me daddy when I put it in you but only after you beg for it and I won’t be gentle.
Draco never complains. Harry can see that he’s tired but he never utters an displeased word. He has stamina. Nice. Still, they both smile upon reaching Draco’s car.
Draco wasn’t sure how long they waited in the closet before finally coming out but it had felt like an eternity. He collapsed onto the bed and said, “Her voice. I recognized that voice but…”
“All right. Then we’ll compare notes. I’ll have to go back to my hotel to retrieve them…” Draco said.
“Oh. Uh… I dunno. I suppose you can’t know until I’ve proven it. But I’m no fan of the president. I mean I didn’t like the old president or whatsherface that he was running against but he’s a real piece of work I’ll admit,” Pansy said.
For the last couple of hours of the drive, Draco has noticed something odd about the car. He can’t put his finger on it. It seems a little sluggish. Instinct tells him he should immediately stop somewhere in Salem to get it looked at just in case but he doesn’t want to ruin things with Harry so he pushes on.
“No. I think you should move in. We’re in this together. And… I don’t know why but I trust you. There’s something in your eyes that’s… I trust you,” Harry said.
Harry laughs and sets his phone aside. The planned trail is the Middle Fork Snoqualmie trail. It will give them flexibility and it’s not one of the harder trails just in case Draco proves to not be up to the challenge.
“I don’t really understand but apparently they bound her in some sort of… pocket dimension. Alone in another reality, all by herself,” Harry said as they got closer to the mausoleum.
“No. I think I can only handle one new cultural milestone per day, thank you very much,” Draco says, plopping back onto the bed.
Draco replies with an address and nothing else. Harry exhales and heads to the shower. It’s the hottest most thorough shower of his life. This feels insane but it’s everything Harry wants. Emotions. Hormones. The lines have become blurry. All he can think about is being with Draco in every way possible.
“The things he says… they are terrifying. And the worst thing is that his actual goals are so much worse. He’s a monster,” Astoria said.
“You’re a death trooper. Woman at that farmhouse told us you ate her husband,” the tall black woman asked.
“No. I have you with me. As long as I have you… I can keep the faith,” Harry smiled, finding himself gazing into Draco’s grey eyes.
“Fuck!” she says, walking right up to Draco and sweeping her hand right over her head to find the top reached the middle of his chest.
And so we reach the end... for the moment. This felt like a good place to leave them given the premise of the story but as mentioned before I have plans for more. When the story continues I'll be continuing both with new Tinder adventures with other characters but with more of Harry and Draco's relationship, date by date.
Harry leaned against the tree that stood in the Weasley family’s front yard. Sunlight illuminated his handsome form and Draco felt a swell of desire that he swallowed down.
“My days all start to feel the same. Now that I’m done with college. Well, done for now. I really want to go back and get my Master’s.”
“Keep them alive? Honey, I’ve fed a little on people with my friends and it leaves them pretty weak. There’s a bunch of you. How many are in the barn?” Pansy asked.
here. They knew who he was… who he really was. And they knew things about the other world, whatever you wanted it to call it. Miracles. Magic. The supernatural. The sort of stuff that let dead ex-girlfriends come back to life.
Draco presses down on the clutch, gripping the stick shift as he put it in reverse, guiding them out then onto the road. As promised there was no destination. He was letting intuition guide him south away from Seattle. He never thought more deeply than that. He imagines himself driving all the way down I-5 the coast, right down to Mexico. He could make it in a day if he didn’t need to eat or sleep.
By the time the battle outside was over and the other girls found Pansy in the barn, Daphne’s wounds were fully healed. Her body seemed fuller and stronger, her frailty disappeared. She was deep asleep.
After stopping to look at the map they carry on the trail. This isn’t the most scenic trail in Washington but it should work well enough. If nothing else it’s peaceful. Harry always loves getting away from the city. Away from the traffic and people in a hurry to go nowhere. With nature, he’s at home. It’s more spiritual than any church he’s ever been in.
“See, this is what happens when you’re raised with hippies,” Draco says, finishing his bar and lightly shaking his head in teasing disapproval.
They come to a high hill that overlooks the trail, climbing it and standing out at the top. Some other people just left. Evergreen as far as the eye can see, rolling up the sides of mountains.
“Yeah, well, this is a death trooper vest and someone wrote Pansy in it with a heart next to it,” the dark-haired lady said, glancing at the label.
“Sure I can. I did it loads of times before you murdered me to save that Granger girl. Sunscreen and a hoodie. And it’s supposed to rain the next few days. Cloudy skies!” Pansy declared with joy.
“Harry, if you keep that up I’m going to blow my load right down your throat,” Draco says, sounding in dire straits.
The game is fun. Hermione almost predictably wins. She’s nice about it though. He thinks she was just baiting him earlier. Thinking if challenged he would get cocky. The old Draco might’ve. The new Draco knows his worth does not hinge on his ability to win at a game he’s never even played before.
Draco: “Never have I ever lied about the size of my penis or told someone their penis was big when it wasn’t.”
“Goodie! So I guess I’ll let you boys get back to cuddling or whatever you were doing. How come you didn’t tell me you liked boys, Draco? I told Blaise you were straight. He
“I don’t know. I’m not looking for a girl right now. I’m not looking for anyone else right now. I guess all the same things I would want in a guy. Good morals. Cares about people. Active. Likes sports. Hot.”
Harry didn’t know how Draco’s teenage lust had grown to a greater affection and admiration. It had all been so confusing at first and when Pansy died Draco had really thought about coming to Harry and being honest. They were friends by that point, nearly good friends in fact. But Draco lost his nerve even though he knew Harry was technically single at that point, though still pining after Ginny who had disappeared.
Abs. Abs. More abs. Guy in just his underwear. A woman hiking. A man hiking. A man hiking shirtless. Why is everyone into hiking?
“Stop trying to pull it out. Just watching you cut your hands is really freaking me out,” Pansy said, pulling the sword out, the vampire falling to the ground.
“If she’s out of the pocket dimension the trap has already been set off. Some sort of failsafe to keep her from ever leaving the town. I need to get her back in the pocket dimension,” Harry said, stepping forward, trying to guide her back into the mausoleum.
“So, we both lost our memories at the same time. I had your name all over my stuff and you think you saw my name on some of your papers. Guess we were friends,” Draco said.
Quickly he realized his rear driver's side tire had been shot out. He had barely arrived near Harry’s neighborhood before he lost control, crashing into a pole, the airbags saving his life.
Harry isn’t sure what’s happening but he’s decided to just roll with it. If Draco wants to be in charge he can be. The sun is quickly setting and Harry has no clue where they are going. Tchaikovsky is cranked up on the stereo, roaring in Harry’s eyes like it’s heavy metal and his pulse is out of control.
“So, let’s assume I know what you’re looking for in a guy,” Draco says, gesturing at himself then continuing, “What do you look for in a girl?”
“So, let’s play a bit of a game. We’ll ask each other questions. Answer a question, ask a question. Back and forth,” Draco says.
Excellent. Say, I had an idea, if you’re up for it. Don’t you think it’s time we exchanged phone numbers? I’d like to send you some photos. The sexy kind. If you’re interested.
Harry wets his lips and wraps them around the head of Draco’s dick, slowly sucking and getting a taste of his salty pre-come.
“The president. Pansy started working for her maker and her maker worked for him. Then Riddle got elected. Still doesn’t make any sense. All those things he was proposing… He never hid who he was and he still got elected…” Draco said, feeling his anger rise.
“I am. It’s just… funny. Stings a little even though it’s what I’m comfortable with too. I don’t want to be your girlfriend but I want to believe you want me to be your girlfriend. Is that fucked up?” Daphne said.
Draco looked up at Harry. Harry’s green eyes were just as beautiful in this moment as they had ever been. They still caught Draco off guard. He swallowed then looked away before he could continue.
Draco drove slowly through the Hollow. The sun had just set. Astoria wasn’t responding to his texts. That worried him. As he pulled up to his parent’s home, long since abandoned, he saw figures roaming around it. As he watched the insides of the house suddenly started to glow bright with orange. It was on fire.
Harry has been consumed with wondering just how Draco and Pansy were sexually incompatible. What does that even mean? Is Pansy a freak in bed? Or is Draco? Harry wonders which would be worse. If Draco is a freak maybe he’s too much of a freak for Harry. But if Draco isn’t a freak maybe he’s boring? Or maybe that’s not even it. Maybe they couldn’t agree about who was on top? Harry could work with that.
It’s long, fat, and pink, nearly as big as Harry’s dick is fully hard and he’s not small. It doesn’t look even a little hard. It looks like if Harry squeezed it there would be nothing but spongey squish.
“What? I like to have good vision before doing anything like… this,” Harry said, quickly undoing Draco’s slacks and pulling out his pale, pink cock.
Unable to tolerate the sun any longer he stuck out his thumb. Wasn’t sure how he knew to do that but hopefully someone would stop. It wasn’t successful at first. Eventually, a car pulled up, the driver rolling down the window. Older white guy. Looked a little gruff.
“We started out strong. Lots of passion but it fizzled fast. I think we both still loved each other but… we just couldn’t make it work. So I called it off.”
Draco didn’t let himself finish that sentence and he felt himself turning red. Dammit, Draco, be cool, he told himself.
Harry laughs a big belly deep laugh that warms Draco’s soul. It’s the most wonderful thing Draco has ever heard.
Draco pauses to imagine Harry showering, the water rippling down his lean and toned form, down his back, and right over his perfectly sculpted-
“No. This is our town. No one else gets to keep it. Besides… something is trapped in the cemetery,” Harry said.
No one else seemed to know Draco. It was funny. It was like… he existed but no one cared. He had money and seemed like he owned some property out on the east coast. But searching for himself yielded nothing. He paid a detective to find any evidence he existed and there was nothing. He existed but only sort of.
“You have to feed. You need your strength. You can feel the hunger in your core. If you deny it eventually it will become too much and you won’t even be able to control yourself. Feed. Drink him dry,” the woman barked.
Draco slid behind Harry, placing an arm around his and another over his shoulder. Harry chuckled softly as his feet found Draco’s under the covers and rubbed them affectionately. Draco pressed his groin into Harry’s back, overwhelmed with desire, suspecting they both could use some release. Draco sucked on the side of Harry’s neck and slid his hand down Harry’s firm stomach, to his groin. Draco roughly rubbed the bulge in Harry’s jeans, wishing they were both in less clothing.
The streets of the town were quiet. Corpses were in yards and on sidewalks. Some houses still burned. People’s pets were crying out in sadness. Draco pictured Astoria back at home, clutching a pillow to her chest, filled with fear as dark servants tried to break in. He wiped a secret tear from his eye that he was certain Potter hadn’t seen. He knew she could handle herself but he couldn’t erase the fear.
“I just want to be with you. Tonight. Tomorrow. The day after that,” Harry says, kissing him, Draco’s hand now sliding up his thigh.
They did go back to Draco’s car, to retrieve some stuff he had left in the trunk. Just some files and papers. Notes for the future. It was otherwise completely wrecked and he had lost the keys at some point the night before.
Draco looked down at his torso. Blood smeared the cuts, barely visible in the pale moonlight shining through the blinds. Harry had what appeared to be a bottle of alcohol and cotton balls in his hands.
I told her I was bi and we broke up a few days later. She didn’t say it was about that and I know that things hadn’t be good for a while. I’m not sure what happened. We haven’t spoke in nearly a year.
“That’s probably enough for today. We’ve got a job to do. Nice couple is gonna let us feed if we can scare the ghosts from their apartment,” Angelina said.
“My friends are all dead or evil. I think Blaise might be out there somewhere. Sidebar, still bitter Dean and Seamus didn’t invite me to their wedding,” Draco said.
“Oh well. I’ve got a lot of ground to cover. I’ve got a guy who is going to help me get to Ohio. From there I’ll figure out my next step,” Daphne said.
Harry turns his head, lifting his chin. Draco moves his mouth to Harry’s neck, his hot breath doing things to him. Harry feels his lips softly kissing along the side of his neck and then the teeth hit, not too hard but hard enough that his dick feels it. Harry shifts in his seat like someone had just stuck him with a hot poker. Draco doesn’t let go, not at first. Harry bites his own lip and closes his eyes. Draco lets go and Harry exhales, breathing hard as Draco slips back to his seat with a pleased smile.
“Because for us it’s literally true. There’s no place like home for us. Home no longer exists,” Draco said.
He walks to Harry’s front door thinking just how damn hard it was to find a perfect outfit that didn’t make him look like some rich prick while also showed off his actual worth. He is wearing a tee-shirt and jeans but they are still nice and snug in all the right places. It is important they know that he wasn’t just thin, he is lean and has form and shape. He works hard for this body and he needs them all to know.
“Draco… I know how you feel about Harry. And beyond that, if we are ever going to stop the Dark Lord we have to save Harry. And then we have to find the others. Luna and Hannah disappeared ages ago. We’ll need all four of us. Meghan believed it and I believe it too,” Astoria said.
“I’ve got a big mouth, I’ll be fine. Can I get it down my throat? I’m skeptical,” Harry says, tilting it forward as he leans down, opening wide and sliding down.
“Can’t I eat you just a little bit. Just a tiny bit,” Pansy asked, demonstrating with her thumb and index finger.
“Yeah. You moved back to town. We bumped into each other and… I saw you in a new light. We weren’t adversaries. We were just… two guys. And I realised that everything I had hated about you I really loved about you. I was jealous because you were everything I was taught not to admire or desire. I tried to fight it though. I didn’t want to be gay. A queer. So I got some gay porn to scare myself out of it. It was just a phase, I was sure of it.”
She couldn’t let herself be captured. She was hoping to at least hear from Draco again but he must not have landed in Seattle yet. She sighed and stood up. She would not be intimidated. She walked barefoot through her house. She slid on her house shoes. She wouldn’t need much more where she was going. She’d spent the last year coming up with this plan. Meghan taught her some of this magic. The rest she had figured out herself.
“That’s good. I’ve been alone since…” Harry said, sounding sad, clearly unable to finish the sentence.
They arrive at the trail and get out of the car. Harry inhales and listens to the faint sounds of the woods. Stillness. The sound of the river not far away. Cyclists up the path from them. He straps his pack on, surprised to see that Draco has somehow already done that and is waiting in front of the trail.
Draco wondered what Harry meant but was afraid to pry and be forced to give up his own secrets in return. He had promised Hermione he would’t tell Harry.
Draco’s almost a little sad when he gets the car back. The adventure is almost over. Still, four hours of driving left to do. In some ways, Draco feels changed by this experience. It’s harder to put up the facade. He’s anxious but excited. His life is taking a turn and he knows it is for the better.
Draco remembered that Harry had said the owner was dead on the front porch but perhaps the real owner had taken that other path in the shower and the person on the porch was someone else. Draco looked around for pictures but it was hard to see with no light and all the shades drawn.
I’m also bi but mostly looking for guys right now I guess. My story isn’t so dramatic. I had always thought guys were hot but finally started to be honest with myself.
“What about Pansy? That’s what went wrong with her, isn’t it? She wasn’t into all that stuff,” Harry says.
Traffic is nightmarish. Draco is a good driver, working the stick shift like a pro. He goes a little fast but he’s never unsafe. They don’t speak, not that either of them could hear each other over Tchaikovsky. Harry’s never been so excited and nervous in his life. He wonders if he should’ve insisted on going back to his apartment in case he needed to pack. No, they weren’t leaving Seattle. At least Harry didn’t think.
Cho is a very pretty trans girl Harry used to date for a little while in high school. Draco used to hate her. Now he understands why.
“No. I’m trying to rebind her. I was there and helped the first time. Maybe I can do it again,” Harry said.
Whatever cologne Draco is wearing smells amazing. Harry can only think of it as a dark and sweet musk. It suits Draco. He’s dressed just as well as in his photos. Nothing on him feels anything less than perfectly constructed. He doesn’t even have a single hair out of place. The dick.
Draco is sure it will be a fun conversation when Draco also really hasn’t seen much porn but that was a topic for another day.
Harry sighs. Tinder is so fucking useless. How does anyone meet anyone on this thing? No one looks interesting. Most dudes don’t put much information about themselves and they’re the ones he’s more interested in at the moment. Within a month he’s gone from realizing he’s bisexual to looking for guys on dating apps. His friends say Tinder is just for hookups and given the vast amounts of people in various states of undress he is beginning to suspect that is the case.
So much for Draco’s erection finally fading. Learning about Harry’s porn habits will have it up for hours, he’s sure of it.
“Do you want-“ Harry says, offering it but Neville puts his hand up and says, “Nah. Just wanted to see what was going on.”
So many times Harry had thought of kissing him. In his mind he saw himself touching Draco’s face, pulling him to him and their lips meeting. He thought just a kiss might make him happy. That was probably a lie. He’d only want more kisses. And then he would want things that were much more than kisses.
“Wow. I mean, listen, I’m no pothead but I guess I grew up around parents who were always smoking so I thought it was normal,” Harry says.
Cycle and repeat. It’s like they all come from the same factory. Everyone looks like models on Tinder and not like regular people you’d meet on the street. Not that there’s anything wrong with that but it makes them all seem unreal. Maybe they aren’t real. Maybe they are all bots or people catfishing. Seattleites are not that hot. Harry is sure he would have noticed that.
“Umm. I have a name. Everyone has a name,” she said, desperately trying to remember as she examined the vest.
“Listen, I just need to find Draco. I need to talk to him. Tell him I’m sorry and that I couldn’t… control myself,” Pansy said, pulling herself to her feet.
The wait for the tow isn’t long, thankfully. Harry calls an Uber to get them to the auto repair shop. The shop isn’t busy but they are closing in an hour.
Being vulnerable isn’t the easiest thing for Draco. Being vulnerable and letting people in is a recipe for getting hurt when they find out that deep down inside he’s fundamentally broken. If they see his damage… if Harry sees his damage he won’t be interested anymore.
“But that’s the thing. Pizza is always good but it’s always pizza. You don’t go into pizza expecting something amazing. Pizza is… reliable.”
“Probably.” Harry thinks with the way Draco has been looking at him with those grey eyes he’s definitely thinking of burying something.
The final photo is what Harry has really been waiting for. Draco sitting on his bed pushed back against the headboard, one leg propped up, the other laying flat. Between his thighs is hanging the biggest fucking flaccid dick Harry has ever seen. He zooms in the photo, thinking it must be photoshopped.
“I was out in the woods out there when it disappeared. Maybe I’m from there too. I wonder if I knew you,” Pansy said.
Harry sucked hard, his green eyes looking up at Draco, seeming pleased with whatever reaction he saw. Draco was ready to explode but everything in him still wanted to stretch this moment. He wanted to drown in his lust and desire but he knew it wasn’t practical.
Draco’s hand then strikes Harry’s right ass cheek. Harry jumps and makes a small hiss, though it doesn’t actually hurt that much.
“I’m down. Let me know the details,” Draco says, putting a hand beneath Harry’s chin and drawing him over into a kiss.
“Harry, I need to take you into my bedroom. I’m going to cuff you and test your pain threshold,” Draco says.
Ginny in some ways resembles her brother. Certainly in terms of her fiery red hair and an endless amount of freckles. But her energy and stature are entirely different.
As always doing things like commenting, bookmarking, subscribing, and leaving kudos will help let me know that people are interested in more.
“Cats or dogs? Do you like cats or dogs more? This is a million-dollar questions so you better not get it wrong.”
Harry stalks to balk but then he sees the prices. Way more than he would spend on a first date, that was for sure. Harry orders filet mignon, a rare treat. The waiter takes their menus and Harry realizes that now the two of them have to talk.
Harry’s never exactly had a thing for big dicks but his body is fucking responding. It’s not just the dick. It’s the confidence. The way Draco is looking at the camera. Looking at him. Harry doesn’t know if he can take it but he knows that he needs to know. He needs the number for the big dick training course, stat.
“I suppose I am. Though, I’ve never felt the same way about any other man. Just you,” Draco confessed, the last words coming out as barely more than a breath.
“Fuck. Fuck. Oh. Ohhh,” Draco moaned as hot pleasure washed through him, almost painfully as his cock pulsed into Harry’s mouth.
“Your chili is getting cold,” Harry said, realizing he still didn’t have the courage to make a move.
“Something like that. She said it was too big. And she was right. We had… a lot of trouble. And it was really frustrating. For both of us. I was always gentle and we tried lube and foreplay and it just was never comfortable for her,” Draco says.
“Now we’re going to play never have I ever,” Ron says, pulling out glasses from under the coffee table and pouring some sort of alcoholic beverage into each glass.
