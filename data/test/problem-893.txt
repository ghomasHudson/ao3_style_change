-"Date me, Mr. Loverman."- he said.
One moment, Harry was inside Grimmauld Place, but the moment Walburga had opened her mouth to insult her son the walls had crumbled and everything had shattered.
-“I’m not about to ride in the same carriage as the ferret!”-
Draco smirked and left the shop.
-"You'll still teach me everything?"- Harry asked hopefully. Draco nodded.
-"No matter how much of a prat you are."- Harry added with a smirk. Draco shoved him playfully and sat on his bed, setting the tray in front of him. He glanced at the food and then at Harry.
Luna stood in between Ron and Hermione and took them with her, walking backwards a bit.
-"If I must."- Draco shrugged nonchalantly but on the inside, he was dying to know what the bet was.
He didn’t even understand his feelings.
-"Stay?"- He asked shyly. Harry immediately snuggled close to Draco and the latter rested his head on Harry's chest.
Had he been wrong!?
He was so tired.
Everyone stayed quiet before the Slytherins started applauding and cheering him on.
After telling his secretary to cancel all of his appointments for the night and to reschedule them (of course), Harry Apparated them in Grimmauld Place.
Harry avoided Draco for two weeks, but he would still check up on him.
-"It's not really what I was expecting."- Harry said.
-“Do you think he’ll actually finish it?”- Harry asked.
-"Gin and I broke up a few months ago. It just wasn't working...
One last time.
He still had some dignity (or pride) left inside of him.
-“Yeah, I think you’re delusional.”-
They reminded her so much of Sirius and Remus.
-“I’m sorry, I’m so sorry. I...I relapsed and I didn’t want to disappoint you because I was doing so fucking good and now I fucked up. I was just so overwhelmed. It’s Sirius’ death anniversary and I couldn’t handle it.”- Harry sobbed. Draco hugged him and Harry sobbed louder.
-"Alright."- She said softly.
Harry shrugged.
Harry stood up at the speed of light and grabbed his arm.
-"May I speak to you alone?"- Harry asked. Draco shrugged.
."- Draco said sarcastically. Harry didn't particularly like his attitude. He had just arrived and the other boy already seemed to dislike him.
-"Uh..I just didn't think your friends would appreciate my presence."- Draco shrugged offhandedly.
-"Who
-"H-hullo."- Harry stuttered nervously. No one had told him that Draco was absolutely handsome. He was tall and slim, with messy platinum hair and a piercing body.
-“Hey.”- Harry said. Draco turned and gave him a tight smile and a nod.
-“Haz, we’re not blind. It was obvious.”- Ron told him as if it was natural.
It wouldn’t change, no matter how much he wished it did.
-“Hilarious. So, you knew that I liked Harry before I did and you didn’t bother to mention it!?”- Draco was miffed.
Was he really spending that much time with Draco?
Blaise got out of his trance.
Suddenly, everything made sense in Harry’s mind.
-“What was that all about?”- He asked him once professor Lupin had dismissed him.
-“If you wanna make out, do it in your free time, Nott. Right now, Umbridge is looking for you.”- Blaise said through gritted teeth.
Harry did as told and there it was.
-“Why would you care?”- Harry asked annoyed.
-"H-hi Sirius. I believe we have a lot to discuss."- Draco said, fidgeting with his hands again. Sirius raised a brow and smiled fondly.
He wasn't really dancing, of course. He was gracefully balancing, and every now and then, he would dare to let a foot on the other side of the edge. Where there was nothing but the cold night air and a small abysm waiting for him, calling him to wherever place his mother and father now where in.
He mostly had them at night, but he also had them whenever someone came close to him.
-“You’d do that for me?”- He asked, genuinely shocked.
-“What are you doing here?”- Draco asked with his wand in hand, eyes wide in horror.
Until he was able to reach Draco with his hands if he wanted to. But he didn't want to. He wanted Draco to step down.
Harry didn’t let go of his hand.
-“Thanks Ron.”- Harry said sincerely. Ron smiled fondly.
Rage filled Harry.
Draco's sight went from Harry to the moon and then back at Harry. He bit his lip before stepping towards Harry and Harry caught him.
They both were.
She looked like she wanted to say something but she stopped herself. Instead, she asked:
-"What about you? Are you dating anyone?"- Harry asked as normally as he could.
-"Fine. If you
-“Come on, you twat. I don’t bite.”- Harry teased. Draco sighed and turned to Harry, hesitantly putting his arm around Harry’s waist and resting his head on Harry’s chest.
-"Not only for this, but..for everything. For being my friend."- Draco admitted. Harry's heartbeat increased and Harry couldn't understand why, so he smiled wider and nodded.
-“Uh, if you say so...”- Harry shrugged, his sight never leaving Draco’s. After some painful minutes in silence, Harry turned to Luna.
Harry stayed the rest of the day hidden underneath the covers of his bed.
-“I could ask you the same thing. Are you mourning Dumbledore’s death? No, that can’t be it since it is what you wanted.”- Harry said terrifyingly stern.
-"How do you know?"- Draco whispered. Harry rested his forehead against Draco's.
-"At first, I hanged out with him to keep him from getting hurt. Now, I just really enjoy his company..I think."- Harry said. He thought about Draco's smile and he smiled unconsciously.
-“Why?”- Draco asked. Harry ran his hands through his messy hair, a gesture that Draco liked a lot.
-“Then die! Avada Ke..”-
Harry excused himself shortly after Draco did but not so shortly that people would notice it.
Remus opened the door and let them in.
-"Where is he?"- Harry said. He had somehow managed to get into the Slytherin common room. Blaise looked at him knowingly.
been?”- she asked angrily.
They headed down to breakfast together with Pansy. After everything that had happened, Draco was sure he had been blessed by the heavens with such good friends. Blaise and Pansy cared for him and he cared for them as well.
-“Alright then, shall I cast new butterflies?”- Harry nodded and Draco casted new butterflies on Harry’s skin.
Back and forth.
-"Draco, don't do t.."- Draco pulled away, ignoring the pain in his chest coming from both Harry and himself.
-“There were once three brothers who were travelling along a lonely, winding road at twilight. In time..”- Harry closed his eyes and soon fell asleep with Draco’s soft voice guiding him to a nice dream.
-“Where’s Draco? Is he alright? What happened?”- Harry asked desperately. Madame Pomfrey sighed.
He only slept on the nights he met Harry.
Harry's first reencounter with him was when he accidentally crashed against Draco.
Draco scoffed.
Harry heard whistles and applauses but his mind could only focus on Draco.
Harry, Ron, and Hermione turned to find Draco on the floor, books and papers scattered all around.
None of it felt real.
-"Why did you left yesterday?"- Harry asked. Draco sat in a chair near Harry's bed and was relieved to feel that Harry felt better.
But was that enough?
And he wasn’t talking to Harry. At all.
It wasn't really hard to be by himself at Howgarts now that he was blind. The castle's magic guided him through the corridors and helped him out whenever he needed it. Plus, he knew how to do wandless magic.
-"I'd take you anywhere with me."-
The numbness his own mind had created tuned out every other feeling or emotion that he could possibly feel.
Draco tentatively smiled too.
-"Mister Malfoy, as of this moment, you are not allowed to see neither Draco nor Narcissa. You will go straight to Azkaban."- Minister Kingsley said decidedly. Draco was frozen.
The words were leaving his mouth before he could think of the consequences.
-"This sounds more like the Draco I used to know."- Harry commented.
-"Could you give us a moment, 'Mione?"- Harry asked.
It had become a routine for him, checking on Harry that is. Draco knew the feeling too well not to notice.
-“That’s Chaos Magic.”-
-“Listen to me, Harry. You could never disappoint me, okay? Relapse happens and it doesn’t make your feelings or your progress invalid. Only next time you’re thinking about it, please talk to me, okay?”- Draco said. Harry pulled away and nodded, wiping his tears away.
But Harry beat him to it and kissed him.
C. Malfoy could do wandless magic.
At first, he had been scared to death for Draco.
-"You'll be brilliant."- Ron smiled brightly.
He wanted to breathe for just one second.
-“Can you answer now?”-
Harry saw with confusion how a small blush crept onto Draco's cheeks.
On the fourth day back, Harry started to eat again.
"- Sirius suggested.
And he noticed how no one else seemed to notice.
He screamed and the mirror broke.
He kept his head low and tried his hardest not to mess with anyone.
How had Harry ended up making out with Draco in an empty classroom?
Which then turned into a quiet thought
-"Merlin, I've liked you for months."-
-"What's going on in there?"- He said, touching Harry's forehead.
He needed to get away.
Did he...
Harry exhaled, panting a bit.
-“I haven’t finished packing. Go ahead, I’ll join you in a bit.”- Ron glanced at Draco but nodded nevertheless, running to the Great Hall.
-"Have I ever told you how I got my new arm?"- Draco asked as he started playing the piano again.
Il y a longtemps que
Instead, there were new, messy scars all over Harry’s arm.
-"Bollocks. I've only told them good things about you."- Harry admitted.
He hugged himself and rocked himself back and forth.
-“I don’t know what Williams said, but you don’t deserve this, Draco. Let’s get you treated, hm?”- Harry whispered so quietly that only Draco and Blaise were able to hear him. Harry stood up and extended a hand for Draco to hold.
Two weeks went by and Harry was worried about Draco. Draco was very quiet and he barely ate. Blaise had expressed his concerns as well but Draco had dismissed them, telling them both that he was perfectly fine and that there was nothing to worry about. Neither Harry nor Blaise knew the contents of the Howler, but it must have been something bad because Draco was never like this.
-“I wonder if he ever explodes...”- she continued.
do something while we were gone?”- Harry heard Ron asking angrily, but he didn’t get to hear the answer. He had the feeling he didn’t want to know it anyways.
-“Harry! Come on! We’re gonna be late for lunch!”- Ron told him once.
Draco stopped humming but didn’t seem to be startled. He turned to Harry and patted an empty spot next to him.
Giving him a moment, Harry stayed a bit longer. Then, he too stood up and silently made his way back to his room.
-“It’s called Vem Kan Segla Förutan Vind. It’s a Swedish folk song. I don’t know Swedish but I know Norwegian so..close enough. Mother used to sing it to me when I was a kid.”- Draco said.
Draco waved and walked away but Harry could see the faint blush on his cheeks.
Draco headed back first, sensing that Harry wouldn't go if he didn't.
Draco tried very hard to regain Harry’s affection after the incident, but it was useless.
-“Go ahead, but we’ll wait here for you.”- Hermione told him, grabbing Ron’s hand. Ron relaxed a bit.
Through the grass.
-"It is. How'd you know?"-
He was about to call Draco when he saw him flapping his hands and arms freely, giggling softly.
Harry managed to get his hands on the back of Draco’s head to minimise the impact of the fall.
-"What?"-
Harry tentatively grabbed Draco's hand and the blonde sighed tiredly.
-"They said they can't guarantee anything but they want to try a new magical surgery in January. This one might help if not to regain completely my eyesight, to help me to see in at least 50%." - Draco explained. Blaise hummed in response, because he didn't trust his voice to be steady in that moment,
The four of them arrived and made their way to their respective tables at the Great Hall.
Harry observed Draco as the students who were cursing him laughed cruelly.
-"I'm not allowed to leave my room once we return home for the holidays."- Draco admitted quietly. Harry started running one of his hands through Draco's hair.
it. He missed Draco. He had grown fond of the boy in the few months that they had spent together.
."- Zabini chose his words carefully, but Harry realised that there was more to it. Giving him a stiff nod, he went back to his table.
-"Riddikulus."-
Til it was a battle cry
Reluctantly and with a small groan, he rose and did his morning routine.
Draco didn’t flinched or moved away. No more words were exchanged, nor were they needed. They simply enjoyed each other’s company in silence, watching the moonlight.
-"What are you doing?"- Draco blurted when Harry started talking about Quidditch.
Only then did Harry noticed how dirty and skinny Draco was. As if he was being held captive in his own house.
-“Oh. OH!”- Draco laughed brightly, making Harry laugh as well.
-"S-surrounding Mr. Potter won't help him. Dr. Rivers and I will examine him. Everyone else get back to work."- Draco said as firmly as he could.
Harry went back to his dorm, pacing back and forth. He knew he was bisexual on his fourth year, so that wasn’t the issue. He bloody well thought Draco was pretty.
-“I reckoned you either had your reasons to keep quiet or you hadn’t realised. So ‘Mione and I let you take your time.”-
But it was enough.
But he had kept a stern face while telling him to suit himself before walking away from him.
-"I'm surprised you're my Mind Healer."- Harry commented offhandedly. Draco chuckled.
-"Hello, Mr. Loverman."- he greeted with a teasing smile.
Fear, hurt, and regret were evident in Draco's eyes. That much Harry had known.
Draco could see Harry’s eyes watering.
-"Lunch together?"- Harry asked hopefully, fidgeting with his hands.
-"But I do f.."-
Maintaining his distance, Harry sat in the grass simply staring at Draco while Draco kept moving his hands.
-"I'm fine."- Draco insisted, trying to act as normal as he could.
Harry unconsciously observed Draco that week. He realised that Draco wrote a lot in a notebook, but asides from that, the blonde didn't do much.
A. He had been staring up at Malfoy's eyes.
-"I knew Weasley was stupid but come on, not noticing what happened in the Hospital Wing? Please."- He was referring to the time in which Harry and Hermione had used the time-turner.
They didn't talk about that either, but made a silent agreement.
Which then turned into a quiet word
' and I get '
Zigzagging through the air.
-"E-excitement."- Draco chuckled. Harry smiled.
-“Aren’t you gonna stay for..”-
It’s not like he tried to be sad...he simply was.
Draco drank his tea, bouncing his left leg up and down.
-"Oh, you know...he went for his regular
-"Alright Draco, come up in here."- McGonagall encouraged. She had stopped calling him by his last name ever since the beginning of the year.
Only then would Harry had a chance to survive and win.
-“He’s in pain. Like a lot of us.”-
-“Will you shut up for a second and kiss me?”-
-"What did you expected?"- Draco asked. Harry sighed.
And just like that, they were kissing.
-"Draco, are you drunk enough?"- Blaise asked. Draco looked at him confusedly.
Draco’s brain short-circuited when Hermione Granger walked over to him.
Draco smiled softly.
-"You should go find him."- Hermione encouraged. Harry stopped pacing around and nodded at Hermione, determination written in his eyes.
-"I can't tell you yet. I have to be sure."- Harry pouted,
-"Thank you."- Rivers said and walked away.
So he invited Draco to the Gryffindor common room.
-“Potter is going to be the death of me.”-
And Harry freaked out.
It was all too much.
Harry couldn’t help but gasp and Draco pulled away immediately.
Doctors surrounded Harry in no time and Draco could feel how overwhelmed Harry felt.
-"I shouldn't have kissed you."- He heard Draco inhale sharply before the blonde stood up.
Being on top of him, Harry blushed horribly.
-"Alright. You win, Mr. Loverman."-
Draco smiled and something inside Harry stirred.
-"I'm gonna go help her."- He announced.
He couldn’t breathe.
-"You did. Now you should go."-
-"What's wrong?"- Harry repeated.
A tingly sensation.
-“Mate, I’m pretty sure the whole common room knows. And the fact that he came to the common room worried sick about you doesn’t help.”- Ron admitted. Harry blushed even more.
Like he didn’t deserve it after what he had done.
Draco scoffed. Potter's hero complex was still intact, then. Or maybe it was the Gryffindorishness in him.
-“Draco, I’m sorry...”- Harry apologised. With glistening eyes, Draco smiled and shook his head.
Harry smiled in the kiss and pulled away.
-"Can you bring Draco's favourite meal?"- Harry asked. Dobby nodded happily but then frowned.
-"Nothing much, really."- Harry said awkwardly.
-"You really don't have to do all of this for someone like me."- Harry could feel his anger rising and all he wanted to do was to go back and hex that student.
-“So....I need help with Potions.”- Hermione blurted quickly. Draco’s eyebrows shot up in surprise.
-“I have been able to see them for a while.”- he said. Hermione looked horrified.
Draco blushed and pushed away Blaise's hand.
-"Don't touch him!"- Draco exclaimed harsher than he had intended to. Everyone looked at him confusedly and Draco couldn't stand all those emotions at once.
As if he would break if he didn’t.
Harry stopped writing and stared at both of his friends.
Harry pulled away first, gasping for air. Draco's lower lip was red and Harry gently touch it with his fingers.
-"Shouldn't
-“Nott has a cheap invisibility cloak. Works well enough. Whenever I seemed to be alone, he was there. Watching. Waiting for me to make a mistake. I learned how to feel when he was there and tried to use Legilimency on him a few times to get him off of me, but then he started doing what he did in that classroom.”- Draco finished.
-"Yes Pads. Brought the kids."- Lupin yelled.
-"It's not like I'm gonna wear my uniform to a bar."-
Instead, he grabbed his wand with his mechanical hand and casted firmly,
-"I trusted you with my deepest secret. You should've asked."- Draco said softly. The kind of soft that broke Harry.
Draco sat down on the floor and Harry sat next to him.
After that, their relationship shifted and, slowly but surely, Draco started greeting Harry with all sorts of embarrassing names, making Harry's numbness fade more and more.
by your parents. You don't like me? Fine. But don't you
Draco seemed to be changing all the time.
-“You’re not sleeping, are you?”- Harry asked. Draco sighed and lifted his head.
Draco exhaled heavily in relief.
Draco’s eyes widened.
Draco could often be found alone in the library and after watching him the entire week, Harry decided to sit with him on Friday.
-“Ron!”- Hermione cried. Headmistress McGonagall came quickly along with Blaise and Pansy.
-“How are you feeling today?”-
However, Harry’s touch was as gentle as a summer breeze.
Draco was surprised by Blaise and Pansy on his birthday. They brought him a small, chocolate cake to his room and sang to him. Draco quietly thanked them. He felt so happy already and it was only the beginning of the day.
-"What do you need?"- Harry asked.
He suddenly felt like he was burning and it was all very new to him.
Harry decided to give him the benefit of the doubt,
Harry was avoiding Hermione and Ron.
, Harry. Do you ever comb that hair of yours?"- Draco whispered, running his hands through Harry's hair. Harry leaned in and closed his eyes at the touch.
-"Oh! You should take Harry with you. I'm sure both of you will have a fun time."- Narcissa suggested happily. Draco gave Harry a knowing look and Harry gave him a mischievous smile in return.
-"Have you both decided on your career paths yet?"- Hermione asked instead, changing the subject.
Draco, albeit some difficulty, could finally see him again. He walked closer to Harry, until he could hear Harry's ragged breaths.
-"You are an Empath."- Hermione told him.
It was useless to cry over the past.
-“Not really, it’s not important.”- Draco told him. Harry shoved him playfully.
“That is the stupidest thing I’ve ever heard,” he muttered.
“Afraid we ran off?” Draco asked, a slight sneer on his lips. If he survived this journey, he would vow to never again spend extended time with his long-time rival.
Draco nodded and Harry took a breath. He waved his wand and the shower came to life. Clothes were discarded and Harry stepped into the shower before pulling Draco in after him.
“My name is Draco,” he muttered, taking another sip. “Why in Merlin’s name can you not get that right?”
Harry was the opposite of Draco in almost every way possible. Harry preferred to stay out of the limelight as much as Draco adored the attention. He didn't have a formal bone in his body, and could hardly survive a Ministry event, let alone the politics of a pureblood gathering. And he was brutally honest. Even when he tried to lie--like in the beginning of their relationship when he didn't want anyone to see how quickly he'd fallen for the blond--his emotions were baldly displayed in his expressive green eyes. When he tried to speak a lie, he stuttered like a kid in his first spelling bee. The only time he was graceful was on a broom. He spoke without thinking, and he didn't spend more than five minutes choosing his wardrobe.
"Pensieve, Potter," Malfoy responded, rolling his eyes. He reached over and tugged Harry back down into the chair. "Let's focus on the important details shall we?"
"Yes dear," Draco said, rolling his eyes. "It's a very subtle art, and quite frankly I'm surprised you've picked up on it."
"What if I want to be seen with you?" Harry countered.
Harry sighed. "I know."
Draco and Harry both felt that they had gotten in way over their heads, but neither was willing to admit it.
Using the instant button on her remote control, Ariana forced Draco to sit down.
Eva rolled her eyes. “Right. I’m sure it had nothing to do with their connection with your arch-nemesis.”
Draco shook his head. “No. No, I’ve never heard that version of events.”
His eyes twinkled. “I think I shall,” he said, before pulling a bewildered Granger to the dance floor. Draco decided to ignore them, not wanting to witness the embarrassment that was likely to be Weasley’s dance moves. He was about to order a water when he felt a tap on his shoulder.
That was going to be his next question but he realized she was actually answering Draco.
Ariana nodded. "I totally agree. I have never liked when an author gives characters a sex change. I find it as a cop out for not wanting to have a…well, we'll get to that later," she finished evasively.
Draco pressed himself against Harry and their mouths found one another. Harry's hands roamed over pale skin and he sighed as Draco responded in kind. He grew brave and grabbed Draco's arse, forcing their pricks together. Draco hissed and Harry gasped as they rutted against each other. He pulled away from the kiss and bit Draco's neck. The reaction that caused was wonderful and Harry wanted more.
"When did you get so understanding?" Harry countered.
“You should dance with him,” Eva said.
Eva huffed before spinning on her heel and heading to the train. She left her bags behind in her hurry to find a suitable seat. “And I suppose I’ll just carry these for you, shall I?” Draco called after her. He rolled his eyes before shrinking both their luggage. “I did not sign up to be this woman’s manservant,” he said petulantly.
Harry coughed around the choked sob trying to escape. “That’s not the point…” His voice cracked and he stopped. He knew Ron was worried. He’d noticed the heavy bags under his eyes just hours ago. He hadn’t slept since Malfoy had been taken. He’d barely eaten. He started as Ron’s heavy hand landed on his shoulder.
“Mr. Gutma told me about a cheap curry place nearby.”
"Well," began Ariana, "they usually come up with some magical reason, like a potion, a curse, some kind of mating ritual, or the creature fics."
He opened the paper to page three, noticing the second page was dominated by a thorough explanation of the Muggle Awareness Campaign and the purpose of the ball. The larger part of the third page was the obligatory detailing of Harry Potter’s presence at the ball, complete with an interview and animated picture. Three-fourths of the way down was the article bearing the Malfoy name. The title “Draco Malfoy Brings Muggle Date to the Ball” told him all he needed to know. Someone had been listening in on their table’s conversations. The image chosen for the article was one taken just as Eva and Draco entered the ballroom. The photographer had captured Eva’s wide-eyed awe, though Draco’s image contained a rather uncomfortable frown. Though it did nothing to mar his image, Draco was faced with the knowledge of the various thoughts that frown could convey. He would have to be careful of that in the future.
Ariana grinned because she knew. And she thought that Draco knew she knew. But she was sure Harry didn't know.
Harry’s mouth thinned as he thought about his own experiences with resurrection. His own unexplained return from death had mostly been explained as an unexpected consequence of the horcrux. According to Hermione, he hadn’t really died. It was the piece of Tom’s soul that had been hidden in him, and Harry had survived without his own soul actually crossing over. And Voldemort’s resurrection also wasn’t true since he had never really died either. He wanted to ask Malfoy about it in relation to the alchemical ritual, but he didn’t risk exposing the existence of the horcruxes.
Eva nodded. "I do appreciate this Raj. And thank you for showing Hermione those books. That should keep them busy for a while."
The group followed the inn keeper up some creaky steps and down a narrow hallway. “What did we decide about room arrangements?” Draco asked softly.
Harry had tried to begin the memory just after the initial discovery, but the scene was still pretty gory. He noticed Malfoy falter beside him. His face was absolutely ashen, and his voice seemed to be stuck in his throat. Harry reached for his hand and gave it a gentle squeeze. Malfoy turned to him and swallowed thickly. “I think I might be sick.”
Draco continued to laugh.
The muggle woman grinned. "Then what are you waiting for? Show me!"
“Which still sounds like a fairy tale,” Draco protested. He studied his friend. “What are you doing looking into it anyway?”
Full lips pressed together as Eva hummed. “Well, I’m sure I heard it somewhere…”
Draco was unable to answer as he was busy dry-heaving.
"We're not Jewish," Draco explained patiently.
"Very nice to meet you. Is there anything in particular you would like to see of this library?"
"Why are we here?" asked Mr. Malfoy.
The woman smirked as she pulled the pen out of her ponytail. "An author never gives away all her secrets." With a wink and a pop, she was gone.
"Oh for crying out loud," Harry exclaimed. He bent down and picked up a note that had fallen from the small explosion.
Harry and Ron trekked tiredly from the exam room after being released by the department’s mediwtiches. For once luck had been on Harry’s side. Not only had the tracking spell led them right to Draco’s location, but no one had been seriously injured. They both stopped at a sharp sound coming from an open doorway. The adrenaline from the ambush still had them a little jittery.
"Where is my wand?" asked the blond.
!” He turned back to Harry enthusiastically. “It was jus’
“What time is it?” Eva asked grumpily as she glared at an awe-filled seven-year-old.
Eventually Draco pulled away and hit his head against the shower wall. "Enough teasing." He grabbed Harry's cock and squeezed. Harry's breath left him and all he could do was nod. How Draco had poured oil on his hands without Harry noticing he would never know. All that really mattered was that they were both ready and Draco was turning around. When Harry entered him he had to steady himself to keep from coming right then and there. Draco felt amazing and he would be happy to just stand there and feel those muscles contract around him.
Draco seriously wanted to protest that offer, but that would require admitting that he was awake. He knew he would have questions to answer in the morning, as well as complications to deal with, but he thrived on the art of avoidance. Even though his mind complained about the mess he’d gotten himself into, his heart ensured that he had very pleasant dreams.
"What do you mean 'you're gay'? You just admitted you are too."
Harry's head snapped up, surprised smile playing on his lips. "Draco!" he said.
"What are you talking about?" asked Draco distantly, though Ariana thought he knew.
“Why would I freely give you information that could lead to my arrest?” Malfoy’s voice dripped with disdain.
“And how did you get it?” snapped Ron.
Draco groaned as he fought against the mental images Eva was feeding him. He could already feel his body reacting and grabbed his pillow. He could feel his cheeks going red as he threw his pillow over his lap. Eva cackled.
“Because I’m oh so charming.” He smiled to prove his point. “But seriously, what’s bothering you?”
Somewhere in the background a clock ticked in the sudden silence filling the apartment. Though it lasted only a few seconds, it seemed to stretch forever. Draco studied his friend carefully. “The Enchanted Stone?” he asked. He tried to remember all the stories he’d heard of magical artifacts; though there were many magical stones, he could not recall one that went by such a name.
Harry grinned. "How was the meeting?"
They were both breathing heavily from exertion. Harry looked to be sweating just as much as Draco, but at least he seemed to be enjoying himself. The eyeliner made his eyes gleam in the glowing lights, and Draco had to suppress a groan as Eva’s description came back to him; they did indeed look like emeralds.
Satisfied that his partner was now as awake as he was, Draco set his pillow down. "I had the weirdest dream," Draco informed his partner.
"I'm sure I can spare a few minutes."
Draco raised an eyebrow. As he quickly fit several puzzle pieces together, it became quite clear that his best friend was holding back information. "What is going on?" he asked, crossing his arms.
Draco shook his head at his friend’s antics. “Not everyone has your inability to stay still for any prolonged period of time.” He leaned against the wall and studied his nails, effectively displaying that he was unconcerned about this conversation. Every good Slytherin knew how to lie.
Harry took a gulp of his drink. “I have to admit, you surprise me.”
“You’ll feel better once you shower.”
Draco couldn’t fight the blush that settled across his face. By Potter’s half smile, he didn’t think he’d buy the heat as an excuse.
Instead of going off on his “rescuer” Draco decided to instead focus on the fact that his arm was still held captive. “Potter,” he said as the Weasleys regained their balance, “while I appreciate your sudden insightfulness, you can let go now.”
Draco bristled. “She is not as clumsy as you believe,” he simply said. After the necessary polite comments and requests, he was gladly dismissed from the table. He walked toward his bedroom, mind full of defenses for his best friend. Yes, she was muggle, but she had proven herself to be a worthy friend. Draco could admit that she lacked the social graces with which pureblood wizards were raised, but she made up for it with her own skillful talents. She was fiercely loyal to Draco; and Slytherin or not, he could do nothing but return the favor. It irked him that his parents had yet to see the extraordinary woman Eva was, but he had to remind himself that they silently approved of the relationship—and that was saying a lot.
“We still have to figure out how to get the ministry to allow
"Those two," James' wife sighed. She smiled at Draco. She too had jet black hair; however, unlike her husband, her eyes were dark brown. She gave him a hug. "How are you Papa?"
She brushed away sleep curled locks from where they fell into her eyes. "Getting some hangover potion, prat. What do you think?"
Lily grinned. "We learned about it at school today!"
Harry was immediately back in his line of sight. “Eva went to get you some water. She said you need to take slow, deep breaths.”
She glared at him, but pushed her cart toward the wall. Draco watched as she gripped her ticket tightly in hand before swiftly walking straight through the wall. As she disappeared, Draco could only hope that Granger was ready to calm his friend on the other side.
Now Draco truly studied his friend. He had often wondered what it must be like for Eva. She was surrounded by magic every day, knowing that she would never be able to yield it. He could certainly understand the desire. He even supported it, if it was actually possible. He was
“Certainly! Well then, you’ll want something with room to move, with a hem you won’t step on. I’m thinking more along the conservative side. And you would look fabulous in rich tones!” She guided the two Mrs. Weasleys through the formal section. After showing the elder Weasley a few gowns she set her up in a fitting room so she could look for more of what the woman liked. Eva was great at dressing people. Seeing that she had it firmly under control, Draco left her and went to greet a new customer who had walked in.
She hummed to herself as she looked around. "This is rather strange. I've effectively broken the fourth wall—again—and I can't see my audience. Either I'm completely alone or the fourth wall does not show the audience when it's coming from a story. Since I'm not sure, please leave me a review." She shrugged. "Or not. I hope someone found this amusing. I'd hate to be the only person with my sense of humor. If you did like it and leave a review, I will give you bacon!"
“He never calls me Harry.”
Draco snorted. “Prove it.”
I would like to take the time to point out that I have never been to India. As such, any descriptions of the group’s travels from here on are the result of: my own limited experience with international travel, the internet, and a healthy dose of imagination. My apologies if they fall short of anyone’s personal experiences.
"You are a hot ass mess," Draco countered, trying to get past the fluttering in his insides. Was that his stomach or his heart? Maybe he should see a healer.
"Quite a bit, actually," Harry said smugly. "Like I know that the only reason Eva didn't let you sit with her is so you would be forced to sit next to me."
Johnny stepped in and attempted to get the children under control. After a few minutes with little success, Draco finally stepped in. "All right guys," he said, standing. "Let Santa breath. If you smother him he won't be able to give you your Christmas presents."
"So some poker faces are readable?"
"I don't understand how this is critical to Lily's education," Draco said with a frown.
Or he could try moving. He pulled out slowly and pushed back in, try to start a steady rhythm. Draco would have none of it. He began pushing back against him before Harry even had a chance to set a pace. With a growl he gave as good back and soon the sound of slapping skin joined that of the shower beating down. A few times Harry lost his footing in the water, but he quickly recovered and he was far too busy to be embarrassed. Draco made the most delightful sounds when he pushed just
"If his motives are what we assume, then he'll want a head that resembles the person he lost. That might narrow down your suspect pool."
Grey eyes widened and Malfoy lowered himself on the opposite sofa. “I see,” he said thoughtfully. “Do you recognize the victim?”
Draco laughed as he thought about how the invitation might sound to an outsider. He downed his martini and slapped a few galleons on the counter. After a suggestion that the bartender keep the change, he let Eva pull him out of the bar and to the nearest floo location.
A brilliant idea suddenly popped into her head. She even thought she saw the faint outline of a light bulb hovering above her. Jumping up, she raced to her dresser and dug to the bottom of the top drawer. With a triumphant smile she pulled out a golden pen. It was the magical tool that any truly insane author had in his or her storage. With a wicked grin she thought about her destination before disappearing.
"Oh shut up Draco," snapped Ariana. "Everyone knows you're a flaming homosexual."
"Why do they assume I like guys?"
"But you don't mind walking with someone wearing it?"
“What’s so funny?” she asked.
Harry shrugged. “It’s not always that bad,” he said. He watched as Malfoy took another swig from the bottle. “It was hard in the beginning. A lot of sleepless nights. You learn to cope.” Malfoy stared at the bottle, no indication that he’d heard him. “Malfoy?” No response. He bit down a bubble of panic and walked over to the blond. “Draco.” The blond started and turned to him. “Come here.” Harry reached out a hand and pulled Malfoy to him. He gave a weak protest but Harry enveloped him in a hug. After a tense moment, Malfoy shuddered and collapsed into the embrace.
Eva nodded. “Yeah, that goes without saying. Also, sometimes if the stone was stolen but the person survived the robbery, they died of grief.”
An average-looking girl of an average age with average hair walked into a…
Draco’s face went ashen and he jumped from the couch and stared at his friend in panic. “Eva!” he exclaimed. “You cannot bring people back from the dead. Even if it was somehow possible—which it’s not—it would create all kinds of irreversible problems!”
Draco sighed and stood up. Ariana thought she had said the right thing, as she was sure Draco didn't want to be there anymore.
"Well," Lily started, "it's a festival of lights! There wasn't any oil at the temple so they were sad. But then there was a miracle and the lights stayed on!" She exacerbated her story with dramatic hand movements.
Malfoy chuckled and led Harry to a room he’d not entered before. It was a small receiving room with elegant looking furniture. Harry resisted throwing himself down as he wanted, not trusting the delicate pieces to withstand the force. He could feel Malfoy’s gaze on him as he lowered himself, and almost jumped when a house elf appeared beside the coffee table. “Please retrieve some tea from the kitchen and the Hadley Blend from the library.” With a pop the house elf disappeared again. “Now, want to tell me what has you looking like you’ve seen a Grim?”
"Of course I can read your mind," the woman said, grinning. "I am the Authoress."
“Circe’s tits, Harry,” Ron said crossly. “You need to give it a break.”
"I didn't realize that it would be such an operation just to wrap presents," Draco replied, eyebrow delicately lifted.
“I take you where?” he asked.
"I do," she said with a sneer. "But it's difficult to do so with the two of you arguing. So discuss this situation with the decorum of the mature men I know you are capable of being. But by all means, keep the conversation between the two of you, and don't feel the need to include the whole damn bus!" It was really quite impressive how Eva was able to yell in a whisper that didn't carry through the vehicle. Suddenly she got a mischievous look in her eyes and leaned further over her seat. Draco was worried she would tumble head over feet, but then she probably deserved it. She leaned in close to Draco. "Of course, if the conversation turns physical, feel free to take pictures." She winked and quickly returned to her seat.
She was cut off by Draco. “That’s another thing. Who is this wizard? You can’t just go trusting people you read about. Have you ever met the man? Does he know you’re a muggle? He could be luring you into a trap.” His imagination fed him images of Eva tied up and tortured. He shuddered, remembering what the Death Eaters had done to some muggles.
Whatever feeling Draco had given him with that nod was long gone and the food in front of him seemed heavily distorted.
-“Now, I didn’t do anything. If you didn’t notice, Potter here dragged me.”- Draco told him.
Draco had cried and hugged both Blaise and Pansy, much to his friends’ surprise.
Harry shook his head. Draco traced his scar gently with his index finger and Harry closed his eyes, leaning in.
, Potter?"- Blaise asked amusedly.
-“Hermione, back at Malfoy Manor, I heard Draco’s voice in my head. Why?”- Harry asked curiously, recalling the peculiar event.
-“Oh, then…is it okay if I wait for him here?”- Harry asked somewhat nervous. Pansy snorted.
-“This butterfly is very much alive, as you can see. If you hurt yourself in any way, it will die and fall off from your wrist.”- Draco told him, as he bandaged Harry’s wrist, hiding the butterfly.
-“Oh! You were! Weren’t you?”- Harry had to stifle a laugh when Draco started walking faster.
-"Let's do this again sometime."- Harry told him.
So maybe…
And now there he was.
The trio was at the library, trying to make a Potions essay but it was nearly impossible.
Up and down.
-“Coming mate?”- Harry shook his head and Ron shrugged, walking away and leaving a flustered Hermione behind.
-"It's fine. You need it."- Draco whispered.
Harry didn’t know.
-“Oh, Harry I didn’t mean..”-
-"Aren't you coming?"- Harry asked when he saw that Blaise was walking away. Blaise stopped and turned.
Draco felt something else.
-"What?"- Harry asked when he realised that Draco was just standing there watching him. Draco shook his head and turned around to walk away but stopped at the door.
Not so much to the point where it endangered Harry's life, but enough for Harry not to feel trapped.
Harry couldn't contain himself any longer and kissed him, earning a groan from Blaise.
Right?
-"I-I can't be sure."- Draco stuttered.
-“And I will protect him until I die.”- Draco said firmly.
-"I'm sorry, what?"- Draco asked, not quite looking at her. He was too focused glaring at Harry. Harry looked at him guiltily.
Harry shook his head.
-"Uh, Harry?"- Before Harry could react, Draco gave him a small peck, eyes widening in horror because what if Harry didn't like him back? What if he had misinterpreted everything?
-“Thank you.”- He thanked softly.
Harry gave another bite to his chocolate frog.
He couldn’t deny it.
-"It's...not just comments, mate."- Ron told him slowly, as if he was worried about Harry's reaction.
But then if you’re so smart,
-"Well, it's your life at the end of the day. No one else will live it for you. Others opinions shouldn't matter."- Draco spoke carefully.
-"Please...please, just kiss me."- Draco had begged desperately.
That wasn’t right.
Et si le soleil descendra du ciel...”-
-"So.."- Harry started.
But Harry was watching him and suddenly the murmurs seemed like screams, the lights were too bright, the smell of different foods made him feel nauseous and it was all too much for Draco to deal with all at once.
-"I'm fine."- He said.
-“Expelliarmus!”- The Ravenclaw’s wand flew directly into Harry’s hand and Harry had to use all his self control not to break it.
Draco shrugged.
Draco had pretty much ditched his job to come to Harry's office at the Ministry thinking that Merlin-knows-what had happened to him just to find out that Harry had told Hermione
-"I see you."-
good. So he giggled.
-“He’s doing surprisingly well.”- Bill told him with a small, encouraging smile. Harry nodded and went to see Draco.
-“Alright, that’s enough for today. We’ll keep practising tomorrow. Mr. Malfoy, a word if you will.”- Professor Lupin said. Draco nodded with a frown on his face.
-“Everyone, settle down!”- Professor Lupin told the class and then turned to Draco
-"Upendi, Upendi."- Pansy chanted. Pansy, much like Draco's cousin Sirius Black, wanted to piss her parents off and walk away from the pure-blood supremacy legacy. So, she was now taking Muggle Studies and to both Blaise's and Draco's astonishment, she was into muggle films and not any muggle films,
“What do you want?” he demanded petulantly.
Potter nodded. “I’m sure it’ll be fine. I’ll go with Draco and Eva.”
Draco nearly choked on his own spit. “Eva,” he hissed. He was going to kill her.
Draco wanted to roll his eyes. It was so like Potter. Eva was his friend only by her ill luck, and yet she would be judged by what he had done. Not for the first time Draco thought she would have been better with a different guide to the wizarding world. As if reading his thoughts, she turned to him and smiled. “Should we take our seats, I think the introduction is beginning.”
"He's a good player, I'll give you that," Draco said, moving into the kitchen to make some tea. Harry followed him. "However, he has a horrible—what's that muggle saying?—poker face."
All thoughts of anger and betrayal evaporated as Harry shot off the bed. They’d been trying to use the candle the suspect had left behind to track down his possible whereabouts. Until now their attempts had failed pathetically. If there was any chance that they were about to find Draco, Harry was going to lead the charge.
The dog that had been lying on the bed, ignoring his human's apparent distress, suddenly looked into the spot she had disappeared from. He had definitely heard a pop. He looked around and noticed his human had once again left him alone. With a sigh he dropped his head back onto the mattress. He was used to the human's insanity and was no longer impressed or bothered by it.
"Where's the fun in that?"
“I thought you might be bored.”
Ron bit his lip and visibly struggled to keep the anger out of his face. Harry was fighting back his own urge to protest. “Why do you even want to help?” he asked Malfoy.
With a nod Draco moved out of the room, Eva and Potter tailing him.
Malfoy glared at the redhead before turning to Harry. “I’m aware of the murders you’ve been investigating. I also know the nature of the murders and that you have yet to determine a motive.”
"What if my dream is an omen?" Draco asked.
He didn't necessarily agree that researching morbid rituals was a way to extend the moment, but at least Malfoy was acknowledging that there was something there. The thought was relieving. Or terrifying. But Malfoy was right: they had an alchemist to catch.
At this Eva blinked. “Why wouldn’t you?”
When he saw the pupils react positively he shook off his concentration and let himself enjoy the rare proximity to his rival-turned-crush. No matter what he said aloud, Draco thought Harry’s eyes were exceedingly beautiful—more so now that the barrier of glass was removed. Those green orbs searched his, wide with surprise.
The Weasleys took longer to recover from their shock. Used-to-be-Granger was first and thankfully decided to keep things civil. “Um, hi. Molly would like a muggle-styled formal dress.”
The blond refused to respond to such a silly question. Instead he took a dramatic sip of his
Ariana cut in before the inevitable fight could, inevitably, occur. "I thought we put this rivalry behind you at the end of book seven!"
"I do love you," he said.
"Sexual frustration?" asked Draco with a raised eyebrow.
“And messy,” Draco added, glancing at the dirty clothes on the ground.
Draco’s breath hitched and he was grateful when Eva spoke.
“That’s what had you moody all day?” Draco asked, confused.
Draco noticed Potter tense, but Eva just clucked her tongue in disapproval. “None of that Draco. We’re on vacation. We are going to
His eyes immediately flew to Eva as he entered the platform. Seeing that she seemed composed he took out his wand and lifted the spell. “You really need to learn the art of subtlety,” he admonished coolly.
Harry blinked at the metaphor. He hadn’t heard that reference in a very long time. He shook off the oncoming nostalgia and forced himself to look Malfoy in the eye. “A head has gone missing.”
The brunet was grinning. Suddenly, without warning, Harry launched himself at Draco and tackled him to the ground.
The bus ride was long due to the large amount of traffic, and much too crowded to try to converse. Draco took the opportunity to study his green-eyed companion. The Savior of the Wizarding world—Draco snorted at the thought and ignored the strange stare from his left—had grown since their days at Hogwarts. He now slightly towered over Draco’s height, and he had filled out from the lanky child he had been. Draco supposed Auror training and the knowledge that a madman wasn’t out to kill him did wonders for his body weight and muscle tone. His complexion was as golden as always, the color of lightly toasted bread. There was no denying the man was attractive, and Draco really couldn’t be blamed for agreeing with the rest of wizarding Britain.
"Fancy meeting you here," a voice said softly from behind.
“All right,” said Harry, looking around the room. He’d analyzed this scene quite enough already. “Let’s get out of here.”
“Yes, that’s me. Harry. Stay awake, Draco. Open your eyes.”
"God forbid," Harry responded with a sigh. "Then please, tell me this dream."
“Not that I want to interrupt such a wonderful show,” Eva said, “but Ron’s looking for you Harry. Apparently he has something
The blond desperately wanted to sigh, and he had a feeling that after this trip he was going to have abandoned yet another Malfoy rule. His father would be so disappointed. He almost smirked at the thought but he had more pressing concerns at the moment. Harry was being an utter Gryffindor, and of course was failing to see the very obvious reason for Draco's displeasure at the subject of the kiss. As a Slytherin Draco could easily let Harry continue down the road to which his thoughts were leading; but he cared for the wizard. Shocking as it may be, Draco was forced to admit that this was far beyond the realms of a simple crush and he was not about to let Harry think that he was lacking in those areas.
"Now this is just a theory, but I'm pretty sure about it.”
He read through the book, dutifully creating voices for the characters as requested. He took solace in the fact that no member of the wizarding community would ever see him like this. What a story that would make for the tabloids!
“Don’t ever get married, Malfoy,” Weasley snorted. That earned an elbow jab from his wife. “It’s just a joke,” he grumbled.
"Do we really need to do this?" Draco asked, allowing the plea in his voice to come through.
Weasley grinned at that prospect. Draco looked down his nose and was about to retort when Eva cut in. “We’ll be right behind you Harry. I’m sure we could all use a shower and meal on non-moving ground.”
“And you want to bring all of this on yourself. Why?”
He slammed his suitcase shut. “Whatever! I’m taking a shower.”
Eva leaned down and whispered in his ear. “Did I ruin a moment?”
She punched him again. “Why do I even hang out with you?”
"Eva," Raj said, finally disengaging himself from Granger. "I know a section that carries some of the information you were asking me about India last night."
Mr. Gutma grinned more widely. “Oh yes I remember! I have been anxiously awaiting your arrival. I’ve never before had a muggle stay here!”
He looked up as the bathroom door opened and Eva emerged. Her red halter top looked good against her tanned skin and broad shoulders. Her hair was pulled up in a high ponytail and the only make up she wore was around her eyes. She paired the halter with some black shorts and Draco envied that she would be the most comfortable of their group in the Indian heat.
As the train began to move, he tried to get comfortable without touching his friend. He knew he was being childish, but dammit, he was tired and grumpy. If Eva could be pissy when she had orchestrated the entire journey, then Draco was certainly allowed to be the same.
Draco watched the woman and felt a strange urge to be nice. “I believe I saw a collection of books in the lobby. Mr. Gutma may have something about the history and culture of this region.”
Draco looked helplessly at his husband. "I think I'm confused," he admitted.
Harry raised an eyebrow. "And what makes you say that,
frotting on the sofa with Malfoy, they’d reached the conclusion that the best place to catch their murderer was at the Beltane fires. The suspect would need something to fuel his vessel, and Malfoy was insistent that he would go after a sacred source. According to Malfoy, it didn’t get much more sacred than the flames of the communal fire that burned on Beltane.
impatient." He pointed to a section of the text that Harry had no hope of interpreting. "This here speaks of a ritual to resurrect the dead."
"If a person disappears, they can leave a trail that can and will be followed. But the aurors aren’t going to use their full force to hunt down missing body parts, especially when the victims are already dead. He’s trying not to get caught."
Harry leapt out of his chair, effectively cutting Malfoy off. "You took our notes!"
“What’s the name of the inn again?” Potter asked.
“She’s quite energetic,” Potter observed.
Eva turned to Draco, but he shook his head. “You won’t know these dances.” She frowned. “Besides, the ministry officials will take the floor first.”
"So you could be lying when you say you love me?" Harry asked teasingly.
“Aren’t we all,” Draco muttered to himself, before going through the wall himself.
Granger looked around the space in wide-eyed wonder, and Draco—for once—couldn't blame her. The New Delhi Wizarding Library was massive. The large ceilings contained floor to ceiling shelving that was full of books and scrolls. Several tables were stationed around the room where wizards and witches could take their selections to study. The ceiling glinted with dancing gold images. And that was just the first room of the library.
Draco looked up from securing his boots and eyed his lover. "Ridiculous," he responded with a smirk. The other man was wearing a bright red coat with white trim that matched his red pants. He had clearly stuffed a pillow down the front of the coat and secured it with a black belt. His black boots looked a bit too large. He had a fake beard around his face and hid his black hair under a Santa hat.
"I'm warm."
“I’m working on it,” she said, nibbling her bottom lip. “After we meet with him we’ll figure out our next moves.”
Draco understood what his father was implying and frowned. “We aren’t dating, if that’s what you’re concerned about.”
The article was not as damning as he had feared. There was a brief mention of his family’s contributions to the Muggle Awareness Campaign as reparations for their war-time crimes. The bulk of the article was speculation over Draco’s date. He smiled to himself as he thought about how excited Eva would be to see herself in the paper. He had bought her a subscription to the Daily Prophet for her birthday last year, knowing that it was the best way for her to keep informed about the wizarding world. Draco set the paper down and looked at his father as a cup of hot coffee appeared beside a plate of breakfast pastries.
Harry’s stomach rolled as the revelation hit him. For a moment he thought he was going to be sick. "You can’t be serious? Why not just use one body?"
Draco frowned. "Let me guess?"
"And the club?"
“Do you have air conditioning?” she responded. He said something to her in Hindi. “Air conditioning?” she repeated, using her hand to fan herself. He said something again and shook his head. She clucked her tongue and dug something out of her back pocket. She flipped through the pocket translation guide. “Vatanukulak?” she tried.
A young woman with blue spiked hair and purple highlights (not unlike an anime character) and green eyes (probably contacts) walked into a room with a large TV screen surrounded by comfortable couches. In the middle of the room stood a large coffee table. It was covered with bowls of varying snacks: popcorn, M & M's, tortilla chips (with queso), and pretzels. There were several cans of assorted sodas. The woman surveyed the room. Noticing something missing she ran to find it, and quickly returned with a remote control.
“Yes, and no,” Eva said, biting her lip. “I’ve been antsy which is what made me ‘pissy’,” she explained, complete with air-quotes. “He confirmed what I had suspected, but it makes any action…complicated.”
Malfoy hummed. “More like someone I’ve seen in passing. I can’t quite put my finger on it.”
***Public Service Announcement: Spoiler Alert. Do not continue if you do not know what happened at the end of book seven and do not care to find out through a fanfiction.***
The blond smirked at Weasley’s narrow-eyed consideration. “It’s a temporary spell that corrects vision. It only lasts a few hours, but Eva was concerned that he would lose his glasses in the club.”
Draco groaned, but the comment let Harry relax enough to chuckle. As the Weasleys looked at the trio in confusion, the blond was hit with the realization that they now shared an inside joke. His heart gave an unnecessary flutter at the thought, and he was grateful to be distracted by Eva ushering them out of the inn.
Harry thought about this.
At this, the dark-haired man urgently searched his clothes. "My wand's missing too!"
Upon reaching the continent, the group had boarded a train to Paris. After a quick lunch at a sidewalk café, they had headed to the station that would take them from Paris to India. It was here that Eva’s lack of sleep started to show itself. She had gotten into an argument with Draco about the supposed existence of Platform 16 ½. Now she stubbornly refused to follow through with what she had been told to do.
“Wha—?” Eva mumbled. She looked at her surroundings, startled. Her wide eyes found Draco. “Jeesh! What’d you do that for?”
"Curse you horrible anonymous writer!" she shouted, falling dramatically to her knees. The resulting carpet burn allowed some version of reality to creep back into her mind and she pulled out her cell phone. There was one person she could talk to. She quickly sent a text to her brother asking if he had heard of the story. The minutes ticked by as she waited for his response.
?” he asked.
"Wait," Harry said, shaking his head as though to clear it. "You're gay?"
to tell you that just
"I know," Draco replied with a smile. "Now go get the bad guys so I can finally have my husband back."
Granger nodded in grateful agreement. “It’s all a little overwhelming, isn’t it?”
Eva sighed. “Are you interested in going to India with us?”
"I actually liked the epilogue," pondered Harry, ignoring Draco's indignant cry.
“I—I can see,” he said breathlessly.
3.	Khaana – food
Harry shuddered. "As good a man as Severus Snape was, I don't think this would happen. Sirius hated Snape."
With a gasp they both emerged from the pensieve. Malfoy immediately grabbed the bottle of scotch and drank straight from it. “I don’t know how you do that every day,” he admitted, coughing slightly from the alcohol.
Eva’s eyes lit up. “That’s what’s had me so antsy today!” She retrieved the parchment she had carried earlier. “The wizard I told you about?”
"There is a reason I study books, Eva," Raj replied. "I have yet to discover anything worth risking my life."
“Most likely.”
Malfoy’s lips did the strange little twitch again. "Glad to be of use." He was about to close the door, but stopped halfway through. "And Potter? Be careful who you discuss this with. Loose lips sink ships and all that."
Draco smirked. “Attention Deficit Disorder. It’s a muggle disease that Eva struggles with on a daily basis.”
Draco fought back a groan. “I am not carrying either of you back to the inn.”
Draco was about to protest but he was pulled from the dance floor and toward the bar before he could open his mouth. Raj introduced himself to Eva and Harry before asking the woman to dance. She grinned and accepted, telling Draco to finish her drink as she left.
“Why not?”
Harry’s conversation with Ron halted abruptly as he entered the conference room. He ignored Ron’s irritated muttering in favor of staring at the blond sitting at the large table.
This time Draco did sigh because—dammit—even a Malfoy was allowed to do so in the given situation. “Yes,” he hissed. “And I would appreciate it if you keep that in this room. I’d rather not send my mother to an early grave.”
“I’d have to ask Ron,” she said with some hesitation.
That seemed to get their attention. With Draco and Johnny's guidance, the kids formed a single file line. They moved up the line and received their presents from Santa. Each one got a gift and a hug and was then guided to the side to open his or her gift. The room was filled with gasps and squeals as presents were opened. Even the teenagers seemed pleased by their gifts.
Draco let himself be pulled into the living room. He obligingly looked in the direction his daughter pointed. Someone—presumably Harry—had used a sticking charm to keep a piece of paper on the wall above the mantle. The "artwork" displayed two blue handprints joined at the thumbs. Yellow flames were painted above each finger. "What is it?" Draco asked, honestly puzzled.
Eva was silent for a moment. “I don’t blame you. He is pretty cute. What do you think he looks like topless? Or even in the shower? He’s an Auror right? So he’s got to be pretty fit. And all the water falling over those toned muscles.” She grinned. “You know, he didn’t lock the door.”
Draco waved his hand toward the other man. “Ignore her American-ness. She often throws out useless slang.”
He sniffed. “I do not!”
“Or maybe you know the motive because you’re the criminal!” accused Ron, though Harry could hardly blame him.
There was really nothing that could have kept Draco calm at that moment, except perhaps his father’s glare. However, the Malfoy patriarch was not in the vicinity, so Draco was allowed to enter into a full panic. “Are you insane?” he shouted, jumping up from the sofa again. “I can’t go to India!
Ariana nodded. "This one was truly horrible. I couldn't finish it, no matter how fatal my curiosity is for internet jokes."
"I had to find a believable way for why I would know Raj when we did come to the library."
Draco nodded. “Better to keep to our cover story. No need to raise suspicions so early in the trip.”
Harry looked at him contemplatively.
Malfoy took a breath and turned back around, taking care not to look at the ground. He ignored the memory Harry and the other responders. He walked over to the bookshelf and looked at the framed photos. “I don’t recognize her,” he said shaking his head. “There’s something about her though.”
His efforts earned him a grin and Harry was uplifted as they left the house and headed for St. Catherine's Orphanage. They had been volunteering at the children's home for the past couple of months and Harry had been talked into dressing up as Santa for the kids. Donations had allowed the organization to buy presents for every child (Draco may have surreptitiously added to the collection, though he would never admit it if asked). They had dropped the last of the presents off the day before and hidden them away from prying eyes. Now they were headed out so Santa could deliver the presents.
“Are you okay?” Harry asked worriedly. His hair was matted to his forehead and he reeked of sweat, but Draco couldn’t bring himself to care. Those bright green eyes consumed his vision and he wasn’t so sure the heat was responsible.
They shook their heads, confused.
Draco bit back a groan as he crouched again. "And how are you, Kioko?"
Malfoy lifted an eyebrow and really it wasn’t fair that he should look so unaffected by what had just occurred. "We're going to continue researching before you say something incredibly stupid and ruin the moment."
"I'll come too," Harry announced. He had a strange look on his face and kept throwing wary glances at Raj.
Draco didn’t quite understand what had to be a muggle reference, but he was too intrigued by the parchment in Eva’s hand to question it. “What is that?”
Harry shook his head. "It's just…disturbing."
“You said the other two were coming?” Mr. Gutma asked.
They danced for close to twenty minutes before a low chuckle brought Draco back to reality. “Is he your boyfriend?” the man asked with no small amount of amusement.
"Weasley is a decent chess player," Draco said once they had flooed to Harry's flat. "Quite skilled, actually."
Harry chuckled and followed Draco out the door. They parted ways, and Harry swore that the person responsible for this mess was going to pay.
Jackie’s Junction
Eva skipped over and held Harry’s face between her calms. “Some black kohl would totally make your eyes stand out even more.”
Draco escorts Eva to the Muggle Awareness Ball
“I think it’s endearing,” Potter said, hiding his amusement behind his mug.
“Shit!” he heard before suddenly Eva was there too. “Heat stroke. Help me get him against that wall in the shade.” Together they half carried him over to one of the fort’s walls. Eva muttered something and leaned him against his new support before running off.
A look of confusion came over the other man’s face. He was about to respond when Eva returned with a bottle of water. He sighed in relief. “I think he’s delirious.”
The blond's lips quirked in that self-conscious smile that always startled Harry; but Harry absolutely loved it. "You've clearly had adequate time for Draco decoding."
He could almost feel Eva’s grin. “Not at all,” she said.
Eva sighed. "Harry, I don't think Draco and I can get into much trouble in a library. I'd hoped you'd know by now that we're not really plotting against the Ministry." Harry actually looked offended and even Draco was a bit surprised by the harshness of the statement.
They arrived at her apartment and Draco collapsed onto the couch. “I am so glad I connected you to the floo network.”
Harry suspected Ariana's mind had been messed up long before whatever author she was talking about. "Wait a minute," he said in sudden realization. "Is this about more of those 'stories'?"
Draco spun around, heart beating wildly, and found himself looking into the eyes of his dance partner from the previous night. "Raj!" he heard Eva exclaim quietly. He could hear the smile in her voice and belatedly wondered at how they had gotten on when they danced.
The dark-haired wizard frowned. “I’m sure I don’t know who you’re talking about?”
"Good luck with that," Harry said with a grin. "By the moans coming from your bed last night, I'd say you're going to have a hard time with that."
“At least you got to stretch out.” At Potter’s confused look he continued. “You know, having two seats to yourself.”
“That is a relief,” Lucius said, abruptly ending that vein of conversation.
"What was that?"
She snorted. “There will be plenty of time for shopping. And they’re not just stones Dray; it’s history. If I just want to study impressive stones I can go to Stonehenge. Now drink your coffee so we can get going.”
It was just a crush; but damned if his heart wasn’t telling him otherwise.
"It really is," Eva said honestly. "What brings you to the library?"
Eva rolled her eyes. “Thank you very much Mr. Gutma. I’m sure we’ll be fine.” She took the keys from the jovial man. With a wink and a grin he left them in the hallway.
The woman and Mr. Malfoy, as we've learned his name to be, rolled their eyes.
Harry shrugged. "In theory. I've never paid much attention."
If one has been able to identify the two young men by description alone, they would have noticed that the inevitable fight between the two had yet to break out. Let it be noted that the hostess planned for just this. In fact, the ploy to remove the wands was in part so that they could not curse her. However, it was more for the fact that the two would be so disturbed over their missing wands, that they would have little attention to give to their rivalry.
.” He pointed to his nose. “Here da
“Should I leave you two alone?” Potter asked, pausing by the bed.
The blond snorted. "I know that. It's sparkling cider—no alcohol."
Harry frowned. "The cat."
Suddenly Draco had the sudden urge to see Harry’s eyes and he opened his own. Harry was looking at him in concern. “Harry’s a nice name,” Draco assured him.
He had imagined kissing his crush—fantasized about it. Nothing could have prepared him for the rush of feelings that entered his body. Through the haze of alcohol and passion, the sounds of the club faded away. His hand at Harry’s hip dug deeper and his other went up to grip the back of Harry’s hair. The other man made a sound of appreciation as he pulled them closer together.
Granger blinked in surprise. “Hello Eva,” she greeted. “Draco. What are you doing here?”
“The tracking charm finally took.”
“I’m with Potter. How about a cab when we leave?”
"No, I might forget it by then."
"Positive." He glanced at Harry with a slight frown.
Perhaps he should have been concerned that their lives were in the hands of a man with whom they couldn’t communicate, but he could not bring himself to care. He smiled in relief as the driver cranked up the air conditioning and drank the last of his water. “That’s great,” he said drowsily. “Wake me up when we get there.” Since no one protested that he needed to stay awake, he promptly passed out.
The next morning Draco had to contend with Jackie’s predictable fascination for all things celebrity. She plagued him with questions about the attendees of the ball. Did he really sit next to Harry Potter? Did he get to meet Arthur Weasley? Why didn’t he tell her he was
She held out a hand and Potter took it. “It’s a pleasure, Mr. Potter,” she greeted.
1.	Vatanukulak – air conditioner
"Something like that," Harry agreed.
Harry blinked in surprise. It would certainly explain how casual he was being. He was just too tired to keep up the front. "Do you think that’s wise, considering you’ve been targeted?"
it,” he said through gritted teeth. He remembered his previous description of Eva as a five-year-old when it came to explaining magic, and he heartily agreed with it. As surprising as many people might find it, Draco was actually quite good with children. Of course, that was after a good night’s sleep, a proper breakfast, and when the child was not encased in the body of a grown woman.
"But why?"
The young woman sorted herself out before looking at the pair in relief. She immediately jumped from the couch and began pacing. "Oh thank god, it actually worked. I've never tried implanting myself in the story; I always bring the characters to me. But this worked!" She twirled a gold pen between her fingers before sticking it beneath the rubber band holding her ponytail. "You guys have to help me," she said, never ceasing her pacing. "I cannot get this damn story out of my head, and it's ruining my relaxing evening." She paused, seeming to gather her nerve. "Okay, before I even get to the actual plot—if you can call it that—let's just talk the technical stuff. First of all, this girl has apparently never had a grammar course in her life! I would claim she was a three-year-old but she would have to be one fucked up three-year-old to write this shit. But anyway, she also can't spell to save her life. I don't think she's even sounding out the words. And don't get me started on the sentence structure!"
“This is so weird,” Harry muttered, glancing around the room.
Draco shrugged. “As unpleasant as I find the lot, they are the best prank shop in Britain.”
Raj smiled and turned to the woman. "Eva, Draco." His smile seemed to widen just a bit when he saw Harry. "Harry, good to see you again."
“Exactly. Besides, when might we ever get another chance to travel to India?”
Molly beamed and Harry hid a smile behind his hands. Everyone knew the best way to compliment a great cook was to ask for their recipe. Draco could be such a suck-up sometimes. He jumped when he felt a kick to his shin and looked up to see Draco's glare. Harry just grinned. Apparently his boyfriend knew exactly what he'd been thinking.
Granger stepped in to help. “We are going to the Muggle Awareness Ball. Molly needs a stunning gown as she will be very much in the spotlight that night.”
to travel to India,” Draco finally said.
Eva smirked; a look that she had undoubtedly inherited from the blond. “So we convince them to give us a babysitter.”
“Wha—?” Harry choked. “There really is a charm?”
“Which one?”
“It’s a charm,” he mumbled.
Draco resisted the urge to flinch as Eva’s fingertips dug into his arm. She was staring at the ballroom in awe, and Draco had to remember that she’d never had the pleasure of attending a wizarding ball. She looked lovely in an ebony gown she’d only been able to afford because of her employee discount. Draco sniffed and decided that that little detail would go unsaid. He himself was well dressed in a charcoal suit with a pale blue shirt. They made an enchanting couple; Draco had made sure of it. If he was going to be dragged to this ball, they were going to look their absolute best.
Draco tried to use his well-bred manners to keep his face passive, but a chuckle escaped despite his best efforts.
“He’s going to have one hell of a hangover,” he heard Harry tell Eva.
Draco was not sure which to react to: his surprise at her accuracy or her description of Potter. He decided on the safer route. “Arch-nemesis?” He raised an eyebrow.
Narcissa nodded. “A decision based solely on their own emotions with no attention to the possible ramifications.” It was an insult, though few would have picked up on it.
With a sneer Draco finished off the last of his martini. The bartender quickly replaced it. Draco snatched the toothpick filled with olives before Eva could attempt to steal them. “Mind telling me just what had you all pissy today?” He was done talking about red-headed demons.
I am editing as a bring the story over because I found that I didn't really like some of the original writing. I will try to finish the process quickly, but it depends on how much editing each chapter needs. (I'm also bringing over a bunch of Christmas fics as a sort of "Christmas in July" and I don't want to spam the feed, so the next chapter won't be uploaded until all of those are done.)
A grin lit Eva’s face. She had already won this battle. Now she just had to wait for Draco to realize it.
Suddenly the other man grinned. "I'm just missing with you."
Eva rolled her eyes. “Your language knowledge sucks. It’s Sanskrit.” She plopped the notebook in his lap. “In Hindu mythology the Enchanted Stone was given as a gift from the sky to the king of Tibet. It’s said that the person who possesses the Enchanted Stone will be granted anything they wish for.”
“Please do. Malfoy plus one, if you would.” He could feel Eva rolling his eyes at his command. Honestly, the importance was the phrasing; what difference did it make if he added a question mark?
Draco scoffed. "What do you know?"
A hand grabbed Harry's wrist and he turned his full attention to its owner. Malfoy jerked his head and Harry's gaze followed the direction. He noticed a man standing near the flames, watching them with an intensity that did not match the carefree gaiety of the other attendees. "I know him," Malfoy whispered. "And I once saw him with a woman who looked a bit like that head."
"Holy shit, a talking dog!"
"It is because it's you!" he exclaimed a bit more loudly than he intended. His body's reaction to the proximity of Harry and the memory of the kiss was only making his emotions more jumbled and his mood more frustrated.
“A temporary one, yes. It will last a few hours. Now come here and take off your specs.” Harry did as he was told and Draco grabbed his chin.
Harry shook his head. "I woke up when you pointed your wand at Eva."
Draco snorted. "Doubtful." He turned around to face Harry, eyes full of laughter.
Draco smiled. "Santa's really busy this time of year. He has to get back to his workshop."
"I like it," said Ariana. "All my favorite couples in one story!"
“Let’s just get going,” Draco responded, grabbing Eva by the elbow. Once situated in the fireplace—it was always tricky flooing with a second person—Draco wrapped his arm around Eva’s waste and gathered a handful of floo powder. After making sure Eva was secure he shouted their destination.
Potter had obviously heard of that muggle disease as he let out a chuckle. “Yeah, he’s always been a bit prissy.”
Malfoy raised an eyebrow. "It would be a waste to have a house elf just to open the door."
"Sure," Harry said, eyes scanning the dark landscape. It was hard to clarify where they were with the entire park blanketed by fresh snow. Spotting a bench, Harry guided them over. He sat Draco down and plopped down beside him.
"I don't think glaring at it is going to make it disappear," Harry said from beside him, voice laced with amusement.
"Just get on with it Malfoy!"
Harry faltered. “I don’t know if that’s such a good idea.”
The dog dead-panned, which is apparently possible for a dog. He gently backed the author out of the doorway and let the door shut behind them.
Draco was not convinced that this was a good idea. He had a long list of things that could possibly go wrong. He hadn’t voiced those concerns to Eva, knowing she would accuse him of being overdramatic. Despite the common accusation, Draco had some very legitimate fears about this plan. Yet there he stood in Auror Potter’s office, asking him to play chaperon to their Indian vacation.
“I am in the room you know,” Draco snapped.
"How does one write a lemon?" Draco asked.
of all people, yet at the same time urging himself to move on with the past. At night his body didn’t seem all that interested in his mental dilemma and he found himself thinking of the blond more than he would care to admit.
Potter shook his head in obvious disbelief. “So…I guess we’re going to India?”
Draco shrugged. "Of course I did. I let him win the third one."
“Kohl?”
“Whatever Eva,” Draco said, shaking his head. “Let’s just go inside.”
“Minee” gave a suffering sigh. “You thought your nose was missing.”
"Well that's ridiculous. J.K. Rowling got it right," responded the dark-haired man.
“Come on Draco!” Eva whined. “Don’t you want to know if the stone is real? Think of the excitement, Draco! The thrill of the hunt!”
Eva sighed. “Ron and Hermione are sharing a room—for obvious reasons.” They both had the decency to blush. “You and I will be sharing a room with Harry.”
Eva shrugged, bringing Draco back to the conversation. “I always thought those labels were a bit one-dimensional anyway.” She wiped her hand across her forehead. “Let’s go inside before Draco passes out again.”
Draco scoffed and entered their room. “Don’t worry Weasel; I won’t harm your Golden Boy.”
Malfoy grimaced. "The vessel." Harry gave him a questioning look. "He's building a vessel out of the parts he takes from the victims."
The blond actually blushed. "Reflexes," he muttered, looking into his lap.
Harry rolled his eyes. "Sure you did, Draco."
She quickly explained what had transpired minutes ago and the traumatizing effects it was having. She waited fifteen minutes without a response. He had probably rolled his eyes and deleted her message. Jerk. Ariana groaned and hit her head-yet again-against the wall. Why did she think he would understand? He had given up fanfiction years ago!
Raj chuckled. "Yes, I can see how obvious that might seem to you. However, the Chintamani has been nothing but a rumor for centuries. A very obscure rumor at that."
"Because they're batshit crazy?" Malfoy suggested with a raised brow. "Or desperate, though that’s really the same thing."
The conversation officially died and Draco went back to making sure nothing had shifted in his luggage. An uncomfortable silence descended on the room, and Draco was relieved when it was broken by Eva exiting the bathroom.
After they left Eva turned back to Draco. “You got off easy, I hope you know. I don’t give a damn about your socio-phobic need to shut yourself away from higher wizarding society. I stayed here because this world amazes me. You are my best friend and it is your duty to ensure my wizarding experience is as rich as possible. Besides,” she said, “you need this. Going to a Muggle Awareness Ball? That’s going to be amazing publicity for your family!”
“While that reasoning may have been enlightened at one point, its overuse has made it virtually useless in practice.”
She had all but given up hope when a sound from her phone startled her. She grinned when she realized her brother had responded.
“I think you’re very nice,” Eva piped in. “Why else would I be your friend?”
Draco's eyes flew open as he sensed someone digging through his belongings. He kept extremely silent as he subtly grabbed his wand from where it lay under his pillow and turned quickly, aiming his wand at the criminal's throat. Through the morning fog he recognized irritated brown eyes glaring at him. "Eva?" he hissed, removing his wand. "What the hell are you doing?"
Ariana smiled secretively. Her diabolical plan was falling into place.
Draco shrugged. "I haven't been released yet."
“Potter, Weasley, take a seat please,” Robards said as he waved toward the table. “Mr. Malfoy has brought forward some interesting information pertaining to your case.” He raised an eyebrow. “I presume you all know one another?”
Draco’s protest was cut off by Potter’s sigh and tug toward the door. “Stop man-handling me, Potter!” he said indignantly.
Harry chuckled and dug into his meal. They chatted lowly about how Draco's parents were doing. They were supposed to have gone to the Manor for dinner, which is where Draco had retrieved the dinner plates. Harry sighed as he ate, not realizing just how hungry he had been.
He had never looked more beautiful.
Draco’s fists clenched. Why was it that this man thought he had any right to go digging into Draco’s life? He felt a light pressure on his thigh and turned to his date. She was engaged in a conversation with the Weasel and his wife, but she squeezed his leg in support. She turned to him briefly and smiled. Her face looked carefree but her eyes screamed “behave”.
"Hi Papa!" she exclaimed. "You have to come see what I made at school."
“Of course,” he muttered. He gave Draco an apologetic look before pulling away and turning to Eva. “I’m sure that Ron thinks it’s absolutely urgent,” he said.
Draco and Eva deal with the fallout from the Muggle Awareness Ball
It was the morning after the dance when Draco was awoken by a house-elf popping into his room. The elf had waited for Draco to struggle awake before informing him that he was wanted at the breakfast table. The dinette was a small room off of the large kitchen that had floor to ceiling windows looking over the herb garden. It sat catty-corner to the formal dining room, which hadn’t been used in several years. The family took all their meals in the dinette, so Draco was not surprised to see both his parents seated at the table. His mother greeted him with a kiss to the cheek before motioning him to sit down. His father said nothing, simply placing the morning’s Daily Prophet in front of Draco.
Malfoy frowned. "It's not pleasant. The ritual suggests that a person’s soul can be returned as long as there is a vessel for it to enter. There isn’t an agreement in the discipline over the form of that vessel. People have tried various methods, but again no one has been successful. The alchemical magic that takes place always draws from the conductor. And in this ritual, the results are never pleasant. Death is only the most forgiving consequence I’ve heard."
“He kept calling me Harry.”
Eva looked at Draco in confusion. “How did we manage to get VIP seating?”
“So we’re Potter again?” he asked, eyebrow lifting. He didn’t release his arm.
Narcissa sniffed at the casual term. “She was your date to the ball, so I believe you misspeak. You mean you are not
Harry sighed. "The only main character who was also a creature was Remus. Unless you count Hagrid as a half-giant."
Granger smiled kindly and turned to Draco. Her smile grew a bit more strained. “Malfoy. I’m glad you could make it.”
This time Malfoy did smile. "Gryffindors," he muttered, almost fondly.
The end.
Sure enough the floor soon filled with those officials in attendance. Draco watched as Molly and Arthur Weasley nervously began the dance. “You really did find a beautiful gown for her,” Draco told his date.
The woman smirked, but decided there would be plenty of time for innuendos later. "How very astute of you Mr. Malfoy. I made sure you would be wandless when you arrived."
"What? No!" sputtered Draco. "No, I just read the Prophet regularly. I like to keep informed."
The older blond followed his daughter into her bedroom. He decided that even if they didn't celebrate Hanukkah, he enjoyed his daughter's enthusiasm.
Molly blushed. "Why thank you Hermione! I do try." She turned her gaze to the blond, who was just scooping up the last of his pie. "How about you Draco? Did you enjoy the pie?" She wrung her hands in what Harry had come to know as a nervous gesture.
Ariana blinked in confusion. "So…you guys still hate each other's guts?"
“You called me Harry earlier,” he was informed.
“Can you say the same of Miss Melbourn?” Narcissa asked.
Weasley seemed to at least understand the manners involved in drinking and clinked his glass against Eva’s. “Cheers, then,” he said. Everyone followed his example and as one they tipped the glasses back and swallowed.
Lily laughed and moved around Draco to embrace her other father. "Of course not, Daddy."
“I’m so glad I wore shorts!” Eva shouted above the music.
The blond felt panic creep under his skin. He did not want to hurt his lover, but he would simply have to redo the wrapping. "Harry…" he started.
“A bloody drink,” Draco muttered. His headache was returning and he was trying very hard not to curse the next person that opened his or her mouth. He was sure that would gain him a one way ticket to Azkaban. He fleetingly wondered if that would indeed be a better option, but decided he was too young to explore that possibility.
"Where is the stone?" Eva asked, seeming to completely disregard the warning in Raj's voice.
“Gratitude?” Draco asked incredulously. “I’m only here because of you.”
Harry could feel the redhead watching so he took a gulp of the still hot tea. He immediately felt a little of his strain ease and sighed. It had been a rough couple of days. Even Robards had tried to convince him to go home and take a break. His reaction to that suggestion had almost gotten him suspended. As Harry drank his tea he felt his thoughts start to slow. Maybe Ron was right and he should get some rest. His lids felt heavy and he couldn't shake the grogginess. It was almost as if—
She frowned. “If you insist. I don’t really trust taxi drivers but I guess I’ve got some good body guards.” She smiled.
Harry frowned. “Good? You drugged me!”
That night he lay in bed, sleepless. He had dutifully seen Eva home and then returned to report to his parents. He knew tomorrow’s Daily Prophet would be filled with headlines about the ball, and his company at the Weasley-Potter table had not gone unnoticed. He thought about what this would mean for him. Jackie would have a fit, of course. Anyone who seemed to have a scent of celebrity was obnoxiously fawned over. Thankfully he and Eva had the next day off, so he could revel alone in his misery.
He backed Draco out of the spray of the water as he continued his ministrations. Once Draco's back hit the wall Harry moved down until Draco's cock was at eye level. He licked his lips and looked up. Draco's eyes were half lidded and his lips were red and swollen. Pride surged through Harry.
He heard a thump and then Harry's head peeked up from behind the couch. "Hi Draco, I didn't hear you come in."
"Magic?" she asked excitedly.
“His glasses will be an absolute menace in the club!”
A bit of a warning: the chapter opens with an unpleasant stomach illness. Not in great detail, and very short, but I thought I’d be courteous to those who might be bothered by it.
Some loose translations:
Draco groaned and pulled off his temporary t-shirt. “Why is that?” he asked as he pulled on the charcoal sleeveless top. He quickly pulled on the arm-sleeve he used to cover his Dark Mark on the rare occasion he didn’t wear long sleeves.
"Well," said Draco, "that would make sense." His voice held quite a bit of disdain.
Draco nearly jumped at the sound of a sigh behind him. “Really, Ron. Can we be civil for one night?”
“What going on?” the raven-haired man asked.
Harry's eyes widened in surprise. "Don't tell me you actually gave up your house elves!"
“Me!” exclaimed Weasley. “That was good.”
convinced Eva could wish herself into a witch, and he wasn’t sure he wanted to encourage what was likely a lost cause.
“Excellent!” Eva exclaimed, beaming at her newly proclaimed friend. “He can come too. It’ll be so much fun. I can’t wait!” Draco severely doubted that.
Eva and Draco turned to him. “Are you sure?” Draco asked. He was well aware of what it meant that Potter would agree to escort them alone. Either Potter trusted them, or he thought he could easily defend himself against them if necessary. For the sake of peace Draco assumed the former.
Earlier that day they had finally decided to put their names on a list of couples wanting to adopt wizarding children. "I can't see why not?" Harry answered.
The bar was already packed, despite the relatively early hour. Eva grabbed Draco’s hand in a familiar gesture; she would pick their way through the crowd and drag Draco behind her. He instinctively grabbed Harry’s hand and hoped the other man had the sense to complete the train. They wove their way around the dance floor and to the bar.
"How's that?" Draco asked, pouring two cups of tea.
Draco snorted and continued to watch the couples glide across the floor. Had life been different, he would have been one required to participate in the dances; he might have even enjoyed it. Now, no one cared to share a dance floor with a Malfoy. He silently thanked his luck. He much preferred the effortless dancing in the clubs Eva had dragged him to over the stiff, choreographed moves of wizarding dance.
She shrugged. “Doesn’t matter really. And I have a feeling. My spidey-senses are tingling.” That statement was finished with a wiggle of her fingers and eyebrows.
Raj and Eva conversed quietly as Draco went over the past few minutes in his head. Was Harry jealous? He certainly seemed to dislike Raj for no apparent reason. It was unlikely the boy-wonder would be jealous for his sake. Then again, hadn't he kissed Draco after Raj had danced with him? It was all too confusing. He frowned. These were not the kind of complications he needed in his life at the moment.
He interrupted his own thoughts by clearing his throat. "So you think the murderer is trying to create some kind of potion?"
"I love your poker face," Harry said. He leaned in to prove it.
Draco snorted. “Hardly. You fell asleep on my shoulder, thereby preventing me from getting up.” He sniffed and moved toward the refreshment cart.
“Ignore him,” Potter suggested. “He’s awful when he hasn’t slept.”
"Of course I'm sure. Just owl me before you come home and I'll run a bath." He leaned over the desk and kissed Harry.
Draco rolled his eyes at the declaration. People had made several attempts at snapping pictures of Eva and Draco, but the staff had been persistent about informing those customers that photos could not be taken within the store. Though Jackie thrived on all things celebrity, even she was not willing to risk a potential rival having physical documentation of her inventory and floor displays. Despite their best efforts, Draco was sure there had been a few successful photographers.
“I thought they’d

Ginny sighed. “I guess we’ll just stay friends, then.”

Draco smiled. “Be nice. He doesn’t hate you.”
“Got it. Don’t worry, my cravings have so far been for healthy stuff.” He said, making a face as he remembered the liver and onions.
Narcissa sat down across the table from Celeste. “Darling, Draco just showed up at the door, he’s insisting that we give you up for the rest of the day. Pansy and Millicent have promised to make sure all your gifts make it to your bedroom in your absence.”
Harry shrugged. “Good enough, Your Royal Pretentiousness.” He answered.
Draco raised an expectant eyebrow. "Oh, please do!"
Harry broke the kiss and sighed. “Devine tot mai puternica.”(It is getting stronger.) He said softly. “Si mai normala.”(And more common.) He looked at Draco fearfully. “Te rog iarta-ma pentru ceea ce trebuie sa se intample curand.”(Please forgive what must soon happen.)
“Well?” Pansy asked impatiently.
Harry cocked his head. “Okay, then. Where are they?” He asked.

“Mate,

Harry sighed. “
!” She waved her arm around to indicate the party.
Nott froze, looking at him pleadingly. “I want to see you.” He whispered, running his fingertips over the waist band of Draco’s trousers. “Please? I won’t take the boxers off, but I want to look at you. You’re so
Draco groaned, wondering just what he had agreed to subject his poor, aching cock to.
me to do?”
Draco paled. “Early?” He croaked.
“I thought you said you’d call me Harry.”
The muse had been most uncooperative lately.
“I want to rim you.”
Draco sucked in a breath as his cock was stimulated further. It gave a feeble twitch, but he was too spent to be roused back to interest yet for a few hours, or at the very least, minutes.
“I'd like to see you ‘catch’ me when I’m as big as a house.” Celeste muttered grouchily.
Harry!” Draco snapped, raising his head and glaring at the other teen.
Ginny gaped at Harry.
“I still need food, even if you don’t. You need to feed your food, or it’ll die, Love.” He said jokingly.
“Whatever. So what are we doing today?”
Sure, he had heard stories,
"What's so funny, Miss Malfoy?" He asked softly, so as not to disturb the class.
Draco nodded. “My mother was likely to turn me in to Voldemort the second she found out, and I’m still a bit worried that Sev might be forced to do the same, if the evil git hears about me.”
Harry nodded, took a deep breath, and opened the door to the Room of Requirement, entering.
Harry met his gaze. “I’ll be careful… With you. You trust me… Fully?”
Draco opened his eyes in time to see Harry roll out of his bed and disappear into the bathroom. He just hoped he didn’t run into anyone in there, since he was currently male. Maybe sleeping in Draco’s room that night had been a bad idea. They were much safer from anyone finding out if they stayed in Harry’s. Then again, the ‘pretentious or not’ argument had just been finished that evening when they agreed to disagree, so Draco was understandably unable to sleep without his husband last night.
Millie chuckled. “She’s s strong-willed woman with enough money to make the Aurors look the other way. It’s no wonder she doesn’t get caught.”
Draco smiled. “Vanteera are said to be direct descendants of angels cast out of heaven. The wings turned black when they were spurned, to mark them forever, and even though they retained their elemental abilities, only those descendants that were deemed worthy would be able to tap into them. Vanteera were thought extinct, and yet, here I am.” Draco said, spreading his arms out.
“There it is.” Draco whispered.
As soon as Harry heard the word Bound, he wrapped his arms around Draco’s shoulders and sealed his mouth over the blond’s, tongues twining and duelling fiercely as they clung to one another, riding out their passion.
“That’s great!” Harry said enthusiastically.
Harry sat at a desk next to Severus' own, at the back of the potions classroom, so as to be well-clear of the smoke from the cauldrons. Today's potion was not dangerous to pregnant persons, but Severus was taking no chances. He was determined that Draco not lose his child, now that he was so happy about it.
Draco chuckled, bringing his other hand back to Harry’s belly. “Stop hurting Daddy.” He said. “He doesn’t deserve to suffer from your tantrums until you can throw them in person, young lady.”
Harry looked at him in bemusement. "Draco, it's
, as big as the Master bedroom, and had personal touches from Draco’s youth everywhere.
“Oh, I fear the future already.” Severus sighed.
Harry smiled as Madam Pomfrey waved her wand and the sound and image disappeared. “Of course. I had some questions to ask, if you don’t mind. We figured you’d be the best choice to ask, since I don’t have a mother of my own anymore, so...?”
.” He said, amused. “Four or five would be plenty.” He finished.
Draco turned a serious face on him. “I’ve seen snippets of your past smeared across the papers, Love. I know. But that will have an effect on your children. Luckily, they will also likely have inherited your level of magical power to protect them.”
Harry shouted as Draco was bowled over, falling against him and knocking them both to the ground.
Celeste looked at the large Manor atop the hill and blinked a few times, speechless.
“A stag.” Harry said with a small, sad smile.
For the first time ever, Harry saw Molly Weasley slap one of her children. She had then calmly told him that if he wasn’t mature enough to put the past behind him, then he was more than welcome to return home alone. Ron had wisely chosen to keep his mouth shut for the remainder of the meal.
Harry nodded, his eyes already closing. “’Kay.” He whispered as sleep claimed him.
“Potter.”
Draco shook his head, biting his lip, then croaked, “Didn’t finish looking.”
“Draco? Are you alright?!” Harry asked, jumping off his broom and rushing over to the fallen Slytherin.
Hermione smiled. “Good. I’ll leave these books here for a few days, so you can read them, and I’ll leave you to your bonding. I won’t interrupt again.” She said, flushing a bit.
Harry sniffed as a few tears fell, returning the embrace.
“I do not
Harry smiled. “Bun.”(Good.) He said. “Lunch.”

“I really do like it here.” Celeste said as they waited for their food. “This will be a good place to live; for our children to grow up in.”
didn’t, my beloved.
"Mrs., actually." Harry pointed out smugly. "Just remembering Flitwick's words of caution in relation to creating your own spells." He answered, a small smile on his face.
“Do they repel water?”
Harry heard Draco gasp as he stopped short behind him.

silk, and it was like sinking into a cloud. The bed was wonderfully comfortable. “Oh, I like this room.” He said happily.
Then he choked, turning and staring at the black wings coming out of his back. He felt sick at the thought of what would happen if he told his mother. ‘I don’t want to join Voldemort, especially not to take advantage of being a magical creature! Merlin, please let these be retractable!’ As he was thinking this, they folded and sunk into his back, leaving only thin scars behind, easily hidden by clothes. “Oh, thank Merlin!”
“Let’s take this to the Room of Requirement.” Draco suggested. “We can chat over tea.”
Harry snorted, leaning back in his chair. “Never helped me. I just find out what I have to do, then do whatever needs done to make it happen. Works out for the best, because what works for one might not work for another. You have to learn your own way.”

Draco slid his boxers off and slid underneath the covers.
Harry pouted, but took his cock in his hand and began to stroke it.
Draco gasped, watching Harry stare up at him, a look of absolute rapture on his face as his eyes locked onto Draco’s and his tongue massaged the underside of the blond’s shaft. He sucked lightly, and Draco moaned, his head hitting the wall behind him as his eyes slid shut. “Merlin.” He breathed.
Harry sighed. "Listen, we can take our time to decide what's best. We'll talk it over. It's going to take Severus some time to get the experimenting over with, isn't it? And I can't try anything until our daughter is born."
pretentious am I?” He purred.
Blaise laid her down. “I think pregnancy might be too much for a body that used to be male.” He said softly after checking they were alone. “She’s been doing so well lately.”
"One would never be enough." Draco agreed breezily. "But we have eternity ahead of us. I'm sure if you start
Harry nodded. “She really is. As for the others, well, she won’t allow a man to mistreat her, and as soon as they show signs that they might, that’s it. She never gives them a chance to turn bad, she just assumes they will at some point. Blaise doesn’t seem to mind too much. He’s just learned not to get too attached.”
Blaise nodded to Draco, then turned and led the way out of the common room, the other seventh years forming a circle around Draco and Harry, shielding the couple from view.

Celeste pushed as hard as she could, grunting and bearing down as though her life depended on it, and she felt a painful almost-tearing sensation—and heard a wail split the air.
He missed spending time with the Weasleys, feeling accepted for who he was by at least one family. He missed being able to spend time with Hermione and Ron in public places, and he was even starting to miss Colin Creevey and his infamous camera!
Harry snuck a glance at Draco’s back behind him. He was slender and pale, but he was strong enough, as proven by the twitching wings protruding from his back, water sliding over them.

Blaise woke, slipping his hand around the wand under his pillow as he heard frantic feet on the stairs. He wished his mother hadn’t gone to Germany for the week.
Draco bit his lip in thought. “I suppose you can go to her with your concerns. Due to your delicate condition, we may even be able to get her a visit. She’d have more reason to be here than anyone, save Arabella. And she
Draco sighed and continued walking. “I

“You’ll taste every ingredient in food separately. It can be off-putting with most foods.” Blaise said, shrugging. “You can eat Elven food without problems.”
Draco laughed wryly. “I’m going to be even more nervous if I have to let you take me without going slow. This way, we can at least work up to it.”

“Draco, now!”

Harry twisted his hands in the skirt of the dress he was wearing, a voluminous sky-blue gown that covered the clothes he had worn in the final battle, altered to fit his growing belly, to prove his words if Remus didn’t believe him.
Harry lobbed a bottle of lotion at his head. “Back to last names,

Pansy turned a little green. “Well, he

“Great.” Draco sighed. “All this mental translating is giving me a headache. Are you able to talk in English? Or do you have to relearn it?”
Draco laughed. “Good. That was nice.”
“So, where do you want to start?” Harry asked, sitting down across from Draco, freshly showered and in good spirits.

“Nu te ingrijora.”(Stop worrying.) Harry ordered. “Won’t… Hurt you.” His sleepy voice said.
Draco hummed. “And how old are you?” He asked.
Celeste nodded. “So those Wards are separate?” She asked.
Draco shrugged. “Whatever this is,” He said, pointing his fork at a dark red paste over some kind of root, “It’s

Poppy sighed. “How sure are you that Harry would leave?”

Draco looked pointedly at Harry's softly rounded stomach. "Really?" He asked. "Then what's that?"

Harry nodded. “Yes. I’m sick a lot. I can usually keep food down, but the nausea is almost always there, in the background.”
Harry frowned. “No. Should I have?” He asked.
, but I know what I’m feeling for now!” He finished, throwing himself onto Severus’ cream-colored couch. “Sev, it was like nothing I’ve ever felt before.” Draco sighed, grinning happily.
“But she was on the Quidditch team, Harry. And she wasn’t exactly the most feminine of girls if you ask me. She was more like one of the guys, right?” She said, as if that settled it. “Anyway, I’m happy for you. If you’re happy, that’s all that matters.”
Draco flushed. "That's not the point!" He snapped.
“Surprised by this,” Harry said, grinning at the twins, “But if you can’t get past it, I’m not going to try to hide who I am from you. We’ll just have to admit that some things can’t last forever.”
“Gods, you’re hot when you’re angry.” Draco said, shoving Harry against the slick locker room wall and fastening his mouth over the Gryffindor’s.
Nott groaned, shifting to straddle Draco’s body. “Merlin, you’re so hot.”
“No. Remus.” Harry whispered. “He’ll be here tomorrow.” The teen whispered, his face ashen.
Celeste turned to Draco, a brow raised. “What's with the peacock?” She asked.
Between the two minds they now had to draw from, neither had any doubts that their N.E.W.T. scores would be at the very least above par with their peers.
marks here.” He said softly, his voice coloured with lust.
Draco just kept chuckling every time he saw Harry blush, and occasionally reaching over to caress the tiny bump that was their child.
Harry took Draco’s hand. “No matter. You are mine.” He said, as if that decided it.
to have a baby shower. I’m sure Narcissa’s already written to Arabella and started planning it.” She answered.
Draco smirked. “Just one of my many charms.” He replied smugly.
orgasm is felt throughout the entire body, and seems to come in waves, but it’s a little subtler than the male orgasm is. It’s not quite as… Um…
Draco growled. “He’s not
Harry sighed and slid off the table, laying a hand on Draco’s shoulder. “Just think about it, okay?”
Draco grinned widely. “Mother changed my name three times before I was born. It’s not a problem if you change your mind, we’ll pick something else. There are plenty of options.”

Poppy shook her head. “I’m sure you won’t.” She told him.
Remus’ lips tightened. “How did Sirius die?” He asked.
“Damn, that was
Minsy smiled and nodded. “Minsy can see, Master! Will Minsy be caring for baby?” She asked eagerly.
“I’m on top.” Draco said shortly. “Since I am not pregnant. The magic will see you as the female partner, so for this to work, you have to bottom.” He said nervously. He bit his lip when Harry didn’t respond. “Is that okay?”
Draco grinned. “That’s the spirit!” He cheered.

the work!”
Harry laughed. “Okay, so now what?” He asked.
Harry summoned the lube as well, then coated the dildo with it. After the tongue-fucking he had just given Draco, he felt his husband was prepared enough to take the dildo. After all, Draco enjoyed it rough sometimes, and for all his complaining, Harry could feel the anticipation building through the bond.
Harry snorted and finished brushing his teeth, then topped it off with a few breath-freshening charms and pulled the letter he had gotten during his interesting breakfast out of his pocket. He headed out into the bedroom and threw himself onto the bed, carefully, opening the letter and reading it. “Fuck.”
!" Harry shouted, excitedly. "How much money do you think it would take to get enough to find the solution?" He asked.
Harry opened his mouth to list the times he had been saved by a gamble.
It would take a lot of explaining, but things were going to be okay.

you insinuate that I don’t know how to care for myself and my child?!”
Harry pulled Draco’s head to his own, kissing him and sharing the taste of berry.
“So, he’s staying here. And he’s… Parting ways with his parents.”
Blaise set the book in front of him, pushing his char back and running his hands nervously through his hair. “Dear

Celeste smiled. “Soon, if all goes well.” She answered, taking his hand and letting him lead her away.
“Since we’re here, though…” Draco cleared his throat and called out, “Tissy, Tipple, Minsy, to me!”
Draco flushed. “You’re had orgasms as both a girl and a guy, right?”
Draco reached around and closed his hand around Harry’s cock, stroking him slowly. “So hot, so tight.” He breathed, then nipped Harry's earlobe before sucking it into his mouth for a moment. “So
Arthur furrowed his brow but nodded.
Harry’s eyes fluttered closed, and he wrapped his arms around Draco’s neck, pulling the Slytherin close. He sighed contentedly as he felt Draco’s lips tremble, then open slightly against his. He resisted the temptation and broke the kiss. “Draco, that was wonderful.” He said.
Draco looked shocked. "What?! What the hell kind of choice is
“A mistake!” Draco answered with conviction. “
Draco hummed. “I suppose it will work.” He lit a fire in the fireplace and settled Harry onto the couch. “You sit here, and I will be right back.”
"You know," Draco purred as he pulled Harry close for a kiss, just inside the common room, "We
“It’s supposed to be good luck. Sunday is the best day to start new ventures because it’s the beginning of a new week.” Draco smirked. “Now, I think I’m going to figure out just where our marks ended up. Turn over.”
He finally sighed in relief, and then relieved himself, washing his hands with a small smile on his face, courtesy of the day being his seventeenth birthday. He glanced into the mirror, and froze, staring in shock. “Bloody hell, I look like a
Draco called a house-elf and ordered them lunch—quiche and sparkling grape juice.
Celeste was sitting up in bed, eyes wide and terrified, both hands resting on her large stomach. “Amniotic fluid?” She asked more than said.
Draco took the opportunity to smack him in the side with his sword. “Dead again.” He said happily.
“Good, good. Have fun!” He said, then left.
“Why should I go out and look for someone else when I’ve got a perfect option right here already?” He asked, leering down at Draco, one hand teasingly slipping under the bottom of the boxers, fingers brushing his inner thigh.
Harry smirked. “Let’s try a different tactic, then, shall we?”
. For Merlin’s sake, do you even know what you
Draco stiffened. "Oh. You still want that, do you? You'd like to go back to being only male?" He asked cautiously.

Blaise rolled his eyes. “Anyways, so we need to find out how you can summon water and then work on freezing and boiling it. Once you can make things out of ice, we’ll move on. Air should be next, then Earth, and Fire last since it’s the polar opposite of water. It’ll be the most difficult for you.” He finished. “Oh, and Mother sent this for you.” He finished, pulling a bottle of wine out of the bag he had brought. “This is Elven wine. She said no young man that’s of age should have to give up alcohol so soon. This should agree with your taste buds. And she sent a dagger for you. Here.”
“You can, of course, indulge cravings, your body will know what it wants, but nothing too salty. Sodium is going to be the main concern, other cravings are perfectly fine to indulge, as long as you have Draco do the leg work.” She added. “Even then, I’m afraid your girl may be early. If we can just keep her in for a few more weeks, I will be happy. She will be a little premature in three weeks, but her lungs will be developed enough to be fine if you two are careful with her.”
Harry snorted. “Okay, so we won’t do that unless we want that to happen. Fair enough? I still want to hold your hand, and kiss you, and cuddle and all that other fluffy boyfriend stuff.” He said, smiling.
Draco let out a long breath, then nodded. “I can do that.” He said.
Poppy smiled. “I’m very firm in my belief that Harry will stay with Draco. I’ve seen them together, and there is a deep and abiding love there.”
“What in the bloody hell is—”
Pansy glared at him. “Get used to it, Dear. You’re going to be dealing with
Draco snorted. “Why?”
“Until our children start walking.” Celeste pointed out.
Draco stomped after him. “Dammit, I’m going
He got to Snape’s chambers to find the man standing outside the door, waiting for him. “Late, Potter. Why do you insist on wasting my time?”
Draco woke to the feel of a soft bottom rubbing deliciously against his cock. He groaned and grabbed Harry’s hips in both hands and leaned in to whisper in his ear: “
Draco nodded excitedly. “Yes, yes, all of it! What
Harry snuggled against Draco’s body. “I think it’s time for bed, now. After all that, I could use some sleep.” He said, tensing a bit as Draco’s wings appeared, covering them both like a black feathered blanket.

Instead of screaming, Harry almost swallowed his tongue. “Guh.” Was the most dignified response he could give to that.
He stared, wide-eyed, at the girl in his arms. “That’s not good.” He said softly, noticing her pallor.
Draco nodded, looking around. “Looks like the elves have cleaned recently.” He mused.
“I’ve decided that Polyjuice may not be the answer. I’ll need a vial of your blood.” He said, holding up a small vial. “I’ll need another when you are female.” He added.

, she has a very good chance of being perfectly healthy. Just a little small.”
Harry finished brushing his hair and cast the spell to de-frizz his hair, making the curls look sleek and shiny. “Ready to head to breakfast?” He asked.
“Bugger, Harry, alright.” He sighed, pulling the distraught form close and leading them to sit on the couch. “If it means that much to you, go ahead and tell him. But I want to be there.” He said vehemently. “Have him come meet you. Here. Room of Requirement.”
“What is your Patronus?” Remus asked heatedly.
Harry felt the smugness and elation increase dramatically from Draco, and he rolled his eyes. 'That's all he needs. A bigger ego.'
Harry smiled as he cast nox, plunging the room into darkness. “Good night, Mr. Pretentious.”
“Little bigger.” Harry told him.
Severus nodded. "Very well. When you have the money, just give it to me and I will continue trying. This may be the answer that has eluded us thus far." He told Harry. "I am very optimistic that this will work if I can determine the right amount to add."
Both of them climaxed as one, then felt an intense wave of heat travel their bodies.
“I thought you might.” Draco said.
“Mid-May.” Harry said heavily. “Exam time.” He added.
Draco frowned. “Good question. Where
Celeste sat at a table near the back of the room, relaxing and watching the other girls mill around, chatting and snacking and having a good time.
“What?” Draco was at his side in seconds. “Is it Delphini?”
Draco was out of bed in an instant, Floo-calling Pomfrey and telling her.
“Yes. When she comes, she will be your responsibility whenever Celeste needs some time off. Your Mistress is your responsibility until the baby comes, though. Serve her well.” Draco said firmly. “Skittle, when the baby is born, you will shadow Minsy and learn how to tend to a baby. There
Severus nodded as Harry took the vial from him. “However, you must be sure you take it before anything should happen to it. I neglected to write down the recipe, and will be unable to replace that dose. It is the only chance you have of going back.” He warned.
Draco snorted. “Not even
Draco swallowed, his eyes wide as Harry bit his lip guiltily.
Draco hovered near her head, running his hands through her hair and pressing kisses to her brow.
Harry cast tempus, then cursed, shoving the rest of his roll in his mouth as he rushed out of the great hall, late for Occlumency.
But, somehow, he had a feeling that he and Draco were going to be just fine. They'd do whatever it took to make their child happy and healthy, and he knew that there was nothing they couldn't do between the two of them.
, then. Whatever.” He muttered.
Pansy nodded. “Anyway, I should get to bed.” She said, standing up and heading for the bathroom. “
“Do have one, thanks. I think it’s a rather nice one, too.” Draco added, smirking as Harry looked over at him, his eyes unmistakably drawn to his crotch. “You really think anything would be showing? My trousers are spelled not to show embarrassing bits, Potter.” He said, then chuckled.
“Nu.” Harry said quickly.

the Head of Malfoy, so I have access to perks most others, you included, don't.”
After the short sequence of scenes, Draco groaned.
Celeste rather liked it here.
Harry broke the kiss, gasping as a fierce heat burned through him. He groaned as Draco jumped off his lap, kneeling on the floor in front of him, worried.
As soon as the thought flitted across his mind, Harry turned to him, scowling. "Don't call me that!" He hissed.
Celeste bit her lip. “Do we
“Mm.” Draco smiled smugly. “Better than good, I daresay. I might just consider it
Harry growled around his length, then deep-throated him and growled again, the vibrations concentrated around the tip of Draco’s length.
Harry nodded. “I won’t. So, we need to invite your mother over for the next appointment, when we find out the sex of the baby. That would be the best time for me to ask her my questions.” He said.
Harry sighed, giving in and thrusting harder and faster, grabbing Draco’s cock and stroking it. He growled as Draco finally came, and Harry cried out as he followed, feeling the energy they had expended being drawn into his body, making him feel more alive than he had felt in some time. He pulled out of Draco carefully, then slid down the teen’s body to take his cock into his mouth, slowly cleaning off the fluid that was spread on it and around it.
“One healthy baby girl!” Madam Pomfrey announced, clamping and cutting the cord, wiping the baby off with a clean towel before handing her off to Draco to hold while she delivered the placenta.
Draco laid back, raising his hips with a sigh, letting Nott slide the trousers off.

Harry grabbed his thigh, wrapping the leg around his waist and held Draco up against the wall. He rolled his hips forward, his eyes glowing green, and Draco let his head fall back, whimpering. “Yes.” The blond whispered.

Harry laughed.

“It will do, she says.” Draco said mockingly. “Love, that house is one of the best in Wales. Give it the respect it deserves, please.”
“I’ll keep quiet.” Ginny promised.
Dobby popped back in and handed over the plate of crepes.
Draco woke, looking at Harry’s sleeping face blearily. “So young.” He whispered, tracing the furrowed brow gently. “And carrying such pain.” He finished sadly, running a hand through Harry’s thick hair.

today.” Hermione said, sitting down next to her. “So, how are things with Draco lately?”
Celeste nodded as they passed into the first room.
Hermione smiled at him. “You’re gay, Harry?” She asked curiously.
“What’s going on?” She asked.
Draco smiled a bit sadly. “Mother roomed in a different room in this wing while we visited. By then, she and father were already seeing other lovers. There was very little love there, in the end.”
. Right now, he's topping in every class he takes."- Harry defended, trying very bloody hard not to let his temper get the best of him. Lucius hummed again.
-“So, let me get this straight.”- Blaise snorted.
Harry was surprised.
Harry was surprised to find out that his new family for the time being, the Malfoys, didn't treat him like dirt.
-"It's nothing, really. I do it with all of my patients."- Draco told him truthfully. He did walked all of his patients out.
Draco thought about it for longer than he should’ve, yet Harry waited patiently for his answer.
-"No."-
Draco was rather nervous.
Harry genuinely cared for Draco.
Draco stopped in front of the door of his Arithmancy class.
He felt liberated. He felt free.
-“Nott was watching me every time, breathing on my neck. I never told anyone that you were my soulmate...except my mother, of course, but they knew that we had something going on.”- Draco gulped and then revealed slower and softer,
-“Nightmare?”- He asked finally.
-“You little shit. You can talk to us.”- Ron told him, blinking angry tears away.
Draco. Harry actually
-“And you won’t tell anyone?”- He asked cautiously. Draco shook his head.
-“Oh, hullo Harry! As long as Draco is comfortable then it’s fine with me.”- Luna said. Draco finally looked up at the green eyes he had fallen over since fourth year.
When Harry saw Draco for the first time after the war, it was an understatement to say that Harry was shocked.
Draco was helping Harry in a way that Harry didn't believed it was possible to be helped.
-"I threw you your wand at the war, remember?"- Harry did, so he nodded,
-“Sectumsempra!”-
Draco kneeled and covered his ears with his hands.
That was the reason as to why Harry found himself being drawn to the boy.
When Draco made no sign of movement and simply stood there, Harry took another step forward.
He just wanted to rest for a bit.
-"He proved himself to be better than his family, he had no choice, and ultimately sided with us during the war!"- Harry fumed, interrupting Hermione.
Hermione on the other hand, observed him in silence for a moment but then nodded unconvinced.
-“You don’t.”-
-"Some people are."- Draco shot back, -"You, for example."- He teased.
-"I like you."- Draco said simply,
Harry blushed.
" at the door and knocked quietly.
. Harry's? No. His own.
That much Harry knew.
He nodded softly, blonde strands of hair falling over his eyes. Harry smiled and sat down in front of them.
The screams were awful.
-"Go on. I'll tell you when you can see him."- Rivers told him, focusing on Harry.
Draco nodded once and started explaining softly. He chuckled whenever Hermione understood and made soft noises of approval.
Did he liked girls?
Draco gasped and his eyes fluttered open.
-"Harry? Are you alright?"- Draco's soft voice echoed.
-“May I ask you something?”- Harry asked, once he felt comfortable enough with Draco. They were in the Room of Requirement because Draco needed a bit of peace after someone had hexed him (Harry had hexed said person back while Draco apologised quietly). Draco nodded,
-“Ron.”- Hermione warned.
-"Harry."- Harry corrected, grabbing Draco's waist and pulling him closer.
'?"- He heard Ron asking as he closed the door. Draco dared to chuckle despite his feelings.
She un-petrified the student.
Maybe that's why he couldn't quite pinpoint the exact moment and reason it had happened; because somehow, when he didn't think about Draco, his mind went blank and empty.
Harry made his way to him silently. When he was close enough, he asked softly:
-“I…-I need to go.”- Draco excused himself with his friends before walking out.
The need to drown in the lake that was in front of him.
-"Why are you talking to me?"- Harry shrugged.
This caught Harry by surprise too late, when Draco was already walking with Blaise towards the Hospital Wing.
-“Hi Malfoy. Mind if I sit?”- She asked. Draco shook his head and Hermione nodded, sitting down in front of him.
Harry, however, let go of Draco’s hand as soon as the latter stood up.
He could see the blood dripping down his left wrist but he couldn’t feel it.
He waited for Draco.
Harry didn't need to be told twice and Apparated them both in Grimmauld Place.
-“Wait a second, you like me too!”- Harry said, pointing Draco’s face with his index finger, taking Draco off guard. Harry laughed so much at his expression, that he almost fell off of the bed.
You got so much to do and only
Draco, on his side, had woken up in the middle of the night due to the pain and immediately knew what was going on.
-"Will understand. I'm sure they will."-
-"Yeah, yeah."- Draco dismissed.
-"Oh."- Harry said with furrowed brows,
-“I understand.”- Harry told him. Draco looked away and frowned, remembering the time Harry had protected him from those students.
He was alone too.
A small, playful smile tugged on Harry's lips, but he did slow down.
Draco had gone to France after the war for a few months for unknown reasons, but had come back to finish his studies at Hogwarts.
His life after that had passed like blurry snapshots right in front of his eyes.
But before he knew it, Harry was gone.
It had started when his meet ups with Draco became a regular thing.
-“Unfortunately, always.”- Draco had replied when Harry entered. Draco stared at him with wide eyes, smile gone.
It was sweet torture, having to keep your eyes shut and not knowing whether soon somebody will try to kiss you or not. (“You literally cannot tell anyone what we’re doing here”, Hermione had muttered once at breakfast in the Great Hall, a sunday morning and therefore a morning after their weekly activities,”they will think we’ve never even heard about the word consent, forcing people to kiss and all”. “I’d gladly make out with anyone from the group”, Seamus had announced, not really a surprise, mind.)

And then the bottle stopped. In front of
An amount of rain considered ridiculous even for this part of the world was pouring down from the sky, clouds with angry faces swayed lethargically across the grey surface. It all felt like a normal hungover Saturday: the food tasted placidly and each bite felt exhausting. The air in his bedroom smelled sour, the pounding in his ears increased as soon as he got up. The air coming from outside, however, was crisp, fresh and comforting, as if the stinging cold couldn’t get to him under his bedsheets. It was an unpleasant feeling, but he was used to it and acquiesced to the exchange alcohol offered time and time again: lightness for nausea.
for the last scene. But apart from the philosophical aspects, I found the ending to be quite…”
“What if the person I desire isn’t here? Would it require me to walk all across the castle?”, Padma Patil enquired, looking dazzled at Blaise. “Fancy a teacher, Patil?”, Draco jested, eliciting a snicker out of the group. SInce the beginning of eighth year Draco had managed to become civil with most of his classmates after displaying that he truly felt remorse for his actions, making them laugh occasionally. He had despised them once but now even found solace in knowing that people could see him for the normal boy he was underneath it all.
Harry was sweating an awful lot, heart beating loudly. His ears were filled with white noise when he realized Draco must be already kissing somebody else. He was sure too much time had already passed when suddenly, he detected a movement in front of him. Time seemed to freeze, suddenly it was only him and his heartbeat, his racing pulse, his pumping blood and the wave of anticipation hitting him at once. Harry breathed in, out, his adams apple bobbing when, finally, oh finally he detected a shaky breath on his lips, a sweaty palm clenching at his shirt.
"I hope he's alright" was the last thing Harry heard Asteria say before he locked the door to his room and started playing some music. He threw himself on his bed, buried his head in his pillow and let out a muffled, frustrated scream. Draco Malfoy would be the end of him.
“I’ve never seen it, what about you, Theo?”
“Oh, don’t worry, ‘Mione. I don’t think they’ll actually show up. Hey, how was your exam yesterday? Ron told me how you’ve been studying for it day and night”, Harry quickly changed the topic whenever his mental state was implied in the slightest way, a habit he knew Hermione had already picked up on, but he knew she wouldn’t want to pry any more, especially not on a night out.
“We’re just concerned, mate. What’s the matter, anyways? We barely talk about heavy stuff anymore”, Ron said softly. Hermione looked at him and nodded. “Yes. Just because the war‘s over doesn’t mean we can’t talk about that kind of stuff anymore. We miss you. And we’re sorry if us moving in together ever felt like something even remotely resembling betrayal to you“. It felt selfish wanting to hear these things, but it felt good nonetheless. Between work and caring about his mental health, Harry had ceased to look for Hermione and Ron‘s advice and it only now dawned on him what he had been missing out on. Sure, they met up at least twice a week, but one out of the two was always in a group where alcohol was more popular than chagrin.
“Things have changed.”
"Right now?"
“Well, you’d probably be mute by now. Too much talking, you know”, Harry laughed.
He searched for a thing outside he could focus on for it sometimes helped him to gather his thoughts. "Like to stare, Potter?". Surprised, Harry jolted his head to his left and saw Malfoy, wearing a light blue sweater that looked awfully comfortable and holding a pack of cigarettes. "You've gotten even quieter than you were at school", Malfoy noted while ensconcing himself on the other chair as if it was completely natural. His voice sounded neutral but Harry couldn't help but notice the hint of concern he could hear in it, too.
. “I’m looking for a movie. Preferably with a cat”. Harry couldn’t help but laugh internally.
Harry awoke, nearly giddy and eager to leave his room, ignoring how yesterday it'd been the complete opposite. He turned his wardrobe upside down looking for a hoodie that just, well, didn't look like a hoodie but surrendered soon, slipping into the hoodie he'd bought after leaving Hogwarts, content to at least wear something that didn't once belong to his cousin.
“I do care. Of course I do”, Draco looked at him with such genuineness.
When he had made his way across the round, he knelt in front of Potter who had parted his legs enough for Draco to sit down, he closed his eyes for a second to collect his composure. His heartbeat had increased even more. The blonde wondered how that was even possible. Now he could also hear his blood pumping through his body, streaming in all directions. Well, mostly south.
"And how does someone with class do it,then?"
“Alright, mate, you can come back to your seat”, Ron chimed in, rudely interrupting Harry’s new found relishment: Draco Malfoy’s eyes. Startled, Harry sloped back to his seat, feeling his trousers grow tighter with every second passing, he hecticly put the hoodie that he’d been wearing at the beginning of the night in his lap, hoping no one would notice. He felt the heat rise to his cheeks, when Hermione leaned into him and whispered: “Malfoy, huh?”.
"What do you mean? I... I didn't do anything! It was you who initiated-"
He looked around and found Pansy and Hermione looking at him expectantly. The two of them seemed to be in a conversation with Draco and Theodore, who were sitting across from Harry. It had turned into something Harry considered normal now, sharing a table with Slytherins on a Saturday evening. They had left their history behind them and after an Eighth Year filled with reconciliation and, frankly, a great deal of drinking together, it came natural to Harry to talk to Pansy, who Harry found charming in a weird way and Theodore, who was actually quite insightful and knew more about Muggle culture than he cared to admit. Just talking to Draco was something that didn’t come as natural to Harry than he sometimes wished it would.
"Who the fuck are you talking about? I don't have a boyfriend", he replied, voice shaking.
, mate? Why didn't you just say no?". Ron's face was full of worry and bewilderment. "What if he hexes you in your sleep?", he added. "Ron, darling. That's not very helpful. Harry, you described that Malfoy seems very changed, right? Maybe he deserves a second chance and I'm glad that you're at least somewhat willing to grant it to him. However, this might be counterproductive.", Hermione suggested in her caring way that Harry would not like to miss, ever.
Later that day, the two of them found themselves in the same position, at the same time, with the same whiff of smoke surrounding them but a different chocolate melting in their mouths. They were silent and Harry noticed that Draco seemed to be thinking about something, looking ahead at the tree that so often gave Harry's eyes a refuge when he felt he couldn't hold their eye contact. "What are you thinking about?", Harry asked carefully as if he was afraid to disturb the blonde's peace.
Harry took his time on his way back, stopping at the most unnecessary corners, somehow frightened to go back to the apartment. His apartment, he reminded himself. Well, not his, but more his than Malfoy's. His only highlight of the day would be to see Asteria again. She was such a ray of sunshine and sheer positivity, she would be able to make him smile again, he hoped. Walking with faked valliance, he searched for his keys in the backpocket of his jeans. He let himself in, readying himself to see Malfoy in the kitchen. When he saw that he wasn't, he let out a breath he didn't know he was holding. "Harry, mate!", a beaming Francis said, "I'm picking up Asteria at the central station. Care to join me?" "No, I'll probably lie down for a while".
“Here you go”, he said, now standing next to Harry. He made everything look so easy. As if parties weren’t full of discomfort and awkwardness, as if it came naturally to him to now casually put a hand around Harry’s waist and say: “Your dress looks gorgeous” to Sally.
Harry truly was rendered speechless now. Draco seemed to be on the verge of crying and the look in his eyes was so genuine that Harry wanted to scream. He didn't understand what Draco was saying and frustration was boiling inside his body.
“I have to take over the department when Willinger is on his honeymoon and I really do not want to”
. Suddenly, the ceiling seemed to be crashing onto Draco, the room being filled with waves and waves of water, drowning every sound so that the only thing filling Draco’s ears was his heartbeat. On the outside, though, he remained as calm as always. He had gone through a fucking war, he might as well undo Potter’s trousers. In front of everyone. Only using his left hand. Well,
And just like that , the popcorn, cologne and Draco Malfoy himself had disappeared out of Harry’s sight.
Harry eyed his flatmate expectantly, who cleared his throat and declared,"Since Theresa's moved out, her room's been empty and we desperately need the cash, you know that, Harry. So... when I went to the bar tonight after our study session, I overheard Draco talking to the barkeeper about his need for a stay". His voice had become progressively intimidated, so much that the last few words had sounded like a question. Francis was evidently unsure how to interpret the tension between Harry and Draco, since his roommate was one of the kindest people he'd ever met. Of course, sometimes he seemed to be miles away and Asteria and he had quickly understood that something traumatizing must have happened to Harry at some point in his life, yet he always treated everyone in such a respectful manner that this display of staring and quirking-of-eyebrows between the two young men was indeed quite bewildering.
“Call me Harry”.
"Someone's feelings? You were the one who led me on even though..."
Harry opened the door and ruffled through his hair, suppressing a yawn on his way to the kitchen that was, frankly, only three and a half steps away- this was a student accommodation after all- when he saw him.
“Good job, Malfoy”, Seamus snickered, obviously not suspecting that anything monumental had just transpired. Merlin, was he wrong. There was an implied “You can go back to your seat now” in Seamus’ words and Harry watched Malfoy obey, slowly sitting down again on the opposite end of the room. Fuck, he didn’t know whether it was his lack of sexual experience or the fact that Malfoy was just bloody
They were late. Sarah hadn’t given him a time, but judging by the state of the place they were. Music was coming from the living room, chatter and occasional cheering from the kitchen. “Just give your jackets to me, I’ll take them with me. So glad you could make it”, Henry was saying to Harry in the entrance hall. The house was huge and even though Harry’d visited Sarah before, he couldn’t help but feel strangely intimidated by the enormously high ceilings and the chandeliers hanging from them. The air was serene and crisp, not even the alcohol had disturbed the feeling of cleanness in this vestibule. “Wow”, Draco mouthed when Henry had left. “Tell me again why she works at a videothek?”
“I hope you don’t mind, Hannah”. Harry got up, beaming at Hannah. When ensconced in her lap, he helplessly shifted around a few times, not knowing whether he was making her uncomfortable. He could feel her breathing down his neck, making him even more squirky, leaving him to wish the three rounds were over already when he met Malfoy’s gaze lingering on him. The stare held such intensity. The ones before were inscrutable, hard for Harry to figure out but this one was different. He could almost

Draco shook his hand and smiled. “Draco Malfoy. This is my wife, Celeste.”
Draco cast a quick spell at the classroom door, smirking when it flared gold briefly, before the light faded again. “Sev, you

Harry took it and began vigorously stirring the contents.
Draco groaned. “What do you want?” He asked desperately.
“Harry!”
Draco looked up at the tentative query to see Celeste in his doorway, biting her lip and fiddling with her skirt. “Dray, I’m sorry. I was being irrational and… Well, I’ve been thinking. I can’t tell Molly who I am, she’s loyal to Dumbledore to a fault, and she’d tell him, but…
“Move, brat.” Severus sneered, grabbing Draco’s shoulders and moving him out of the way.

"Twenty points to Slytherin. You and your wife may leave early to rest for a bit." Severus said, approvingly.
Celeste groaned. “It was

“So, how much can he do?”
“I’ll leave you two to start moving in. Enjoy yourselves, and Mrs. Malfoy, please do not overexert yourself. Madame Pomfrey is very good at what she does, but she does not need to deal with complications. Let Draco do the heavy lifting.”
Harry’s eyes flashed that eerie glowing green again, and he looked away. “Nu dezvalui ceva asa de intim.”(Do not reveal something of intimate nature.) He said, his voice rough.
Severus snorted. “So go ask Lupin for help.” He said calmly.
Celeste paled. “You would have made me sleep

“Well, that explains my aversion to pork. What about waffles? No salt in them.” Draco teased, sitting on the table next to the book and looking down, trying to read it upside-down.
Draco nodded, letting Blaise firecall the headmaster and gain entry to the school. As soon as they were through, Blaise turned to the headmaster, suddenly all business.
Draco sighed in defeat. “Yes, I might as well.” Draco agreed, slinking into the bathroom as Harry watched his arse.
Ron looked at her, baffled. “But it’s
Draco smirked and created a ball of water, then floated it over to hover above Harry’s head.
They were in the Prefect’s bathroom, and all students and faculty were to be out of the halls until morning, giving them the privacy to bathe and return to their rooms nude, as was custom for one’s wedding night.
It was huge, and the bed was covered in a thick black comforter with a silver Malfoy crest on it. The drapes around it were also silver, and there was a nightstand by both sides of it.

Harry smiled happily. “No need.” He said, looking into Draco’s eyes so that Draco could see that his were back to normal. The incubus hunger was sated, for now.
“Then go ahead.” Harry told him.
“Thank you. Alright, you’ve been in labour for some time already, you’re almost fully dilated. I’m surprised you weren’t woken earlier by contractions.”
Harry stuck his tongue out at Fred, then grabbed Draco’s hand. “Come on, you git, let’s

Pomfrey smiled. “I want to see her every week, on Saturdays, to assess her blood pressure and the baby’s health. What she has right now is preeclampsia. It necessitates a closer watch on her health and Carina’s. You may take her to your rooms now. I will see you both Saturday.”
Harry drew back the covers. “Come on. I’ll be careful. It’s time.” He said gently, all playfulness gone.
Millie sighed. “You’re

“Well, after I soaked him—”
The picture showed Celeste in her risqué morning-after-bonding outfit with her bonding mark showing and Harry knew that Colin Creevey had to be the one that took the picture.
Harry smiled, resuming his eating, noting that he and Draco were apparently the topic on everyone's tongues, as he caught a few shouted exclamations from the other houses.
“Carina.” Harry answered, and Poppy smiled.
“Wrong answer.” Draco snapped, turning back to the desk and picking up the quill again. “No sex tonight.”

Harry frowned. “Fallen angels?” He asked, after listening to the exchange.
Celeste laughed darkly. “Only if
Draco flipped her off as he followed Harry into the room.
Harry chuckled. “Potters tend to have that effect on Snapes.” He said, turning to leave the library. “I’ll be back at eleven, really. But first, I have a fight with Remus and Fred. George is still out cold from that stunner I caught him with yesterday.” Harry snickered, leaving two shocked Slytherins behind.
Madame Pomfrey sighed. “Oh, that’s right, dear. Poor thing.”
Draco shivered. “I need food.” He said softly, knowing that Harry’s every move now was slowly turning into an attempt at seduction. He would probably need to fully cement the bond tonight.
Draco laughed loudly. “But you’re the guest of honour, you
Narcissa wiped away a stray tear and nodded. “Of course. I’ll answer anything you want.”
Pansy grinned and cast the charm. “Please,
“Prick.”
Harry let go of the pillow and sat up straight. “You’re right.” He realized.
Draco couldn’t stand the thought of the disgusting creature touching him, marking his perfect skin, using him as a pawn, draining his magic from him to use as his own… No, Draco wouldn’t be his plaything. He would never take the mark.
Draco chuckled, closing his book. “Well, then, let’s head to the kitchens and indulge your strange pregnancy cravings, shall we?” He asked, standing and stretching. “Get your makeup on, Mrs. Malfoy, we’re about to venture into the open again.” He teased, as Harry headed over to his mirror.
Severus sighed. ‘Draco, please forgive me if I find the answer.’ He prayed. ‘I’m only doing this so that you’ll know you were freely chosen.’
Sometimes, though, he found himself yearning for what he used to have.
Ginny leaned close to Draco, who had been staring at his lap the entire time, his cheeks slightly pink. “If you ever hurt him, I will cut you open, neck to navel, and bathe in your blood by the light of a full moon. If you make him happy and treat him right, I wish you two the best of luck.” She whispered calmly, surprised when Draco looked at her and smiled.
“Tradition.” Draco explained. “When we get to the great hall, Pansy and Blaise will step aside, and we will lead the rest of the way to the Slytherin table. Our house has always had the biggest displays when one of us has a life-changing event occur. It’s a show of solidarity, since we’re so 'misunderstood.'” He joked.
Harry got his clothes out of Draco’s wardrobe and began pulling on his special underwear to hide any incriminating bulges, deep in thought. Finally, he sighed. “I don’t really like Delphini as a name. I mean, it’s
Harry raised an eyebrow at him. "Um, Draco, we're both men." He reminded the teen.

Harry grinned. “Dunno. You wanna do it, or waste our time trying to answer your question?”
'I heard that, Golden Boy! Let me have my moment.' Draco mentally berated him, sending a dark glare over his shoulder for emphasis.

.” He told her.
Draco smiled. “Alright. Think I’m something cool? Like, Veela?” Draco asked, smirking. ‘Although my wings aren’t white…’
“I got permission.” Draco said as he re-entered the common room.
The blond laughed, putting the pillow back where it belonged. “Not much, really. I have Quidditch practice, but that’s pretty much it.”
“Did you see it that time?” Draco asked, panting, a sheen of sweat plastering his hair to his face. “Please tell me you were paying attention?” He asked, licking his lips as the look in Harry’s eyes affected him more than he was comfortable with.
“That works.” Draco said. “Now, Skittle, you will shadow Tissy as she cleans the Master suite, nursery, and Heir’s bedroom. Then you will take over that wing, and clean the rest of it. That area will be your main duty, but near mealtimes, you will join the others in the kitchen and help them cook. Minsy, there is to be a baby.”

After a few minutes, Harry came back into the room and lay on the bed, groaning. “I hate you right now.” He declared.
Draco ignored him, finishing the letter and rolling it up. He stood and walked to the door. “Go ahead and wank yourself raw. We both know it’ll
Harry spent the day changing his accommodation every other hour, skipping from armchair to sofa to chair to bed, reading the latest novel by his favorite author, yet he concentrated on everything but the story, anxious to hear the lock of the front door turned. Draco had gone out as Asteria informed him, being vague about his destination. Harry had always assumed, just like he had guessed Draco was a tidy person, that he was an early morning person, too, and he couldn't shake the feeling of satisfaction for noticing these little habits, no matter his determination. Yet, Draco didn't return.
Harry was thrilled to finally smell that malodorous odor associated with familiarity once again, to be forced to squint his eyes every other minute to see something in the poor lighting, to be squished between two hovering, inebriated people anew. Or, well, maybe he was just glad to see his friends again.
“Oh, I’m glad you didn’t”, Draco smiled, “…so, got a good movie for me?”
“My, my, Potter, new tones! You usually refer to me as Malfoy whenever I call you Potter. Tired of this old habit of ours?”
“Does wanting to shag the person no matter who’s involved count, too?”, Draco asked matter-of-factly, as if he didn’t just say something that translated into:
Fortunately, Pansy excelled at coming up with things and fibs respectively in quite the extemporaneous manner, proving it once again by offering: “Although you have woken my interest in who this mysterious person is, you do not have to worry. We’re playing a ‘choice kinda game’. Each player gets two choices: Either they perform a dare or kiss the person they desire most. But: No dramatically unrealistic dares just to get the player to kiss the person they wanna shag the most.”
”, a voice to his right said, and Harry turned to find Draco walking towards the vacant seat. “What’s… that?”, he asked, ogling the drink in front of him and then turning towards Pansy for an explanation. “Oh, Harry insisted on buying you a drink”, Pansy giggled. Now that Harry looked closer, Blaise, Theodore, Ginny and Luna seemed to be holding a laugh in, as well. “I-”, Harry wanted to protest, when Draco looked at him, a genuine smile on his face. “That’s very weird, Potter, but thank you”.
God, Harry was going to die tonight. He couldn’t take it any longer and while he contemplated which excuse he could possibly use to go to bed earlier, he heard Malfoy’s name called again. “I dare you to tell us who your first crush was or to kiss the person you desire”, Harry heard Parkinson say. More color was rising to his cheeks, making him question how that was even possible when he already looked like a bloody love-sick
“I don’t think we can force anyone to do anything. You can sit this one out, Draco, darling. Or you can just kiss them and we’ll promise not to look.”, Luna said, earning a grateful smile from Malfoy. As obscure Harry found their friendship, he couldn’t help but agree with her. If he had to choose between the tasks Malfoy was given, he would be
Instantly, everyone was dead silent, watching his every motion. “They are starting to tingle!”, Blaise exclaimed, looking slightly scared. “Just give in, Blaise. Give us the show we deserve”, Draco snickered, being extremely amused by his normally so composed friend acting in such a weird fashion. “Well, this is going to be awkward”, Blaise mumbled, walking towards Luna, Ginny, Neville and Hannah. Full of suspense, the group watched as Blaise sat down… in front of Neville. Neville opened his mouth slightly in surprise, leaning forward as Blaise did the same. Soon, their lips met and the kiss they shared evolved into a hungry make-out session, evoking a few shocked expressions from their fellow classmates. “The hell..”, Blaise gasped when they parted, “this thing really works. Longbottom, care to accompany me to my seat? There’s plenty of room for you.”
Draco nodded, a small smile on his face. He let go of Harry’s face and said: “Yes, of course”
After a few seconds of watching Neville, Harry forced his gaze to the floor, studying the pattern of the floor he found himself on. “Alright, that’s enough. Merlin, have some mercy with poor Longbottom. He looks like he is turning into a literal tomato.”, Blaise intercepted suddenly, wearing a look akin to… was it
Draco closed the small distance between them and instead of crushing his lips onto Harry’s, he brushed his thumb softly over Harry’s cheek, looking in his eyes and asking: “Can I?”. Harry, unable to bring out a cohesive sentence, only nodded.
“..Andrew felt somehow forced”
And his owl arrived:
Draco fixated the bottle, looking doubtful. With a sigh, he held the bottleneck in a firm grip, giving it a thorough spin. A wave of anticipation was in the air with everyone fully aware that maybe, just maybe, the king of Slytherin would soon be fumbling with their trousers, kneeling in front of them.
Sunday passed in an excruciatingly slow way, leaving Harry with nothing to do but pity the fact that each thing he wanted to do was clouded by a stinging headache. Grimmauld Place felt deserted, now that Kreacher had left- Harry wasn’t familiar with the elf’s whereabouts- and the voices from the portraits did not necessarily leave him feeling welcomed. When he first moved in, he had experienced a feeling of euphoria and a wave of anticipation for his future had hit him when he had first seen the decrepit state of the rooms. He had wanted to get to work immediately, had visions for each room and was even willing to get Hermione and Luna on board, who had offered their help when he’d announced he’d be moving to Grimmauld Place 13 on his own. But tangled in between long hours at the Ministry and even longer hours trying to fall asleep, his motivation had vanished quicker than it had arrived. Everything looked exactly as it had when he first moved in, maybe even a shade darker, a bit dustier and definitely a bit lonelier.
"Next time you want to play with someone's feelings, maybe warn them first"
“I don’t like to share, normally”, Draco replied vaguely. And if this confession of possessiveness wasn’t the hottest thing Harry had heard all year, he didn’t know what was.
“Who’s next then, Longbottom?”, Pansy enquired, anticipating the boy’s response. Neville took a second to consider, still resembling a faintly-red tomato. Harry seized the opportunity and glanced over at Malfoy, hoping to get a chance to study him, when the latter caught his eyes. The blonde smirked at him and then he winked. He
“No, it only works with the people in this room. The product is good, but not good enough to have such a prodigious radius. No offense, Weasel-Bee.” “None taken”, Ron replied after Harry had shot a warning look at him. Ron and Blaise had a proclivity of falling into an argument of any kind when in an inebriated state, whether it was Quidditch or Ron getting mad at Blaise for teasing Hermione.
What he wasn’t used to, though, was having something worth pondering about, something that made him experience a flutter in his stomach whenever he allowed last night‘s occurrences to encompass his whole being. There had been a misunderstanding, yes, but he suddenly felt so close to this new side of Draco he‘d discovered. He yearned to explore it, shuffle through all the pages that held the intricacies of the other’s emotions. There seemed to be a version of him that was tender, vulnerable and considerate.
What in the world made Francis think they had hooked up?
But maybe he wasn’t about to let go. Harry took a seat. Whatever piece of information he was about to receive, he was sure a sedentary position would help. “Apologies, mate. It must have sounded like total wonkers what I said earlier. All serious and stuff! But no. Remember when I said I met a new lady?”, he continued. Harry nodded, repulsed by the use of the word “lady”, but he smiled nonetheless. “Well, her weans need someone to take care of ‘em. You know. Money- wise and all. So me and my lady are getting hitched. We’re going to have a wee little ceremony and afterwards..”, he paused, obviously trying to create suspense. Harry played along and looked at him with feigned anticipation. “We’ll have a honeymoon in Crete! Isn’t that something?”, he finished, beaming. “Congratulations! I’m sure Crete is marvelous'', Harry said, smiling. He still couldn’t figure out why he was asked to sit here, though.
