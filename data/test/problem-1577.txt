“Let me try it off your plate first, Blaise!” Whined Pansy. She was leaning forward over her end of the table, mouth wide open for a forkful of Blaise’s breaded patty.
Zabini didn’t look effected in the slightest, he looked almost emboldened by the attention. If possible his already perfect posture straightened a centimetre more.
“Get… Your hand… Off…Me.” Draco seethed slowly, each word was an attempt to regain his composure, his hair was falling away to curtain his eyes. He took a  long breath through his nose. “I don’t want your help. You may have me bonded to you, but it means nothing, and it will fade away soon enough. You will not acknowledge me or speak to me, I don’t want to be reminded every time of what I did. Stay away from me.”
“No…Go ahead. I’d rather observe,” Draco insisted half-heartedly, turning his head to the side to free his face from her hold, but she wouldn’t budge. Her palms closed firmly into the meat of his cheeks, squashing his face until his lips pursed and he struggled to breathe through his nose. “Ooff—Pansy—“
Draco slowly gripped his fists, ignoring the wand he got back from Severus in his back pocket. He reimagined the stance Sirius performed that night, and on the many other sleepless nights when Draco would steal fleeting glances of him boxing. Bastard never shut the door.
The word stumbled out of his gaping mouth, it shocked him so much a hand slammed over it to silence any future sounds in fear it lured unwanted attention.
He was in pyjama bottoms, and the thin cotton perfectly outlined the shape of his painfully erect penis. Even through the pale blue fabric you could make out the fierce red colour blushing at the tip - Pre-cum was oozing at an alarming rate and it made things much worse when an apple sized wet patch turned the fabric near invisible in its sheerness, exposing the wild black hair on his pubic bone.
“Luna!” Draco tried, looking around. There were at least twenty owls in the open room, all cooing and staring at him with wide, curious eyes.
Draco and Harry both took a seat in front of the grand executive desk after a quick exchange of nods to both men.
That didn’t take look long, because Draco could make out the tips of lit wands making their way over the hill.
Kreacher’s breathing reminded Draco, however, that he wasn’t alone, and he turned to see the wrinkled elf peering up at him, blighted by his miniature stature.
They had breakfast, hot tea and sweet baked goods. As they ate Sirius told him what he’d gotten up to - which wasn’t much, he confessed that in reality he’d been pretty bored for most of the start of the new school year.
to go around, wasn’t just gonna give it all to Peter here.” Randal, , dressed as some sort of Western muggle cowboy, was clearly pissed out of his mind from a presumed generous helping of Eyeball Juice. Draco could smell alcohol vapour on his breath,
“That’s very old-fashioned of you, sir.” Said Hermione, the Beta girl’s face was flushed hot red, she looked absolutely furious. “Omegas are no different to Alphas when it comes to the things that matter.”
“C’mon, Malfoy. That’s not fair. It’s a big deal and it pisses me off how you don’t want any help when I’m practically offering it on my damn knees!” The Alpha was shouting now.
Harry was sitting in the Great Hall for Saturday morning. Looking pissed off and agitated, the rest of the table was giving him space as he festered with his thoughts.
After crawling on his sore knees towards the door, Draco reached up with a shaking hand. He almost couldn’t manage to hold himself on the other alone, and was a second away from collapsing back onto the floor, but luckily his fingers managed to grasp the edge of the cabinet desk, where Sirius’s gift stood in all its glossy purple glory.
“Draco?” Blaise mumbled from the dark corner near by the door, sounding half-asleep, he seemed to be the only one disturbed by the light. The Alpha’s head barely raised off the pillow. “Where are you going?”
He didn't really have the time for leisure nor was he here for that purpose. That's why he immediately made his way to the Hôpital Edouard Herriot. It took him a Floo journey from Paris to Lyon and a bus from the public Floo in Lyon to the hospital itself. It was a short trip but it could've been shorter had he realized the nature of the establishment.
"Yes," Harry confirmed. "It makes sense. Hubert has always been loud and rude but nothing has ever happened to him, not until he decided to manhandle one of the staff."
"That's true but I'm still gonna ask George about it. He likes to work on new stuff and maybe one of these days we'll get a hint as to where these missing wizards really are and we could use this magical signature device to find them!" Ron said enthusiastically, already pulling a spare piece of parchment and scribbling some notes on it. "I'll draft up some plans and show them to you so you can add more stuff that you think it'll probably need."
Harry snorted in disbelief but held out his glass.  Malfoy crossed the rest of the distance between them.  His free hand slid around the glass to stabilize it while he poured.  His fingers were warm and soft against Harry’s.  Malfoy held up the bottle.  “To Harry Potter the Boy Who,” Harry tensed, “got everyone plastered.”
“It’s simple really,” Harry continued.  He was used to Parkinson and Malfoy’s antics by now.  The blonde was particularly sarcastic; Harry had discovered.  Malfoy had always been too busy throwing insults and curses for him to notice before.  His hearing at the Ministry seemed to have taken much of the fight out of him, and he never responded with anything sharper than sarcasm, even to the Gryffindors.
Harry glanced back at Malfoy.  Everyone else was starting to get sweaty from the heat of the fire and copious amount of alcohol.  But Malfoy looked impossibly unaffected.  The white collar of his probably 50 galleon designer shirt was crisp.  The top two buttons were undone giving a glimpse of his chest underneath.  His blonde hair caught the firelight in a way that… highly disturbed him. This was Malfoy and even if Malfoy was hot and even if no one cared about sexual identity in the Hogwarts 8th year that didn’t mean that harboring feelings for Draco Malfoy could end him anywhere except for in a lot of drama.
“You had Lucius.  I had Dumbledore, but they’re both gone now.  I don’t know what that means.  I knew I was meant to kill Voldemort since first year.  I was raised to kill.  Now I have, and there’s the rest of my life ahead of me and, well, this is the first thing that has felt good in so long.  Why else did you come up here?”
“It’s not safe to be out there alone, and you’re not immune to yourself Draco. You could really hurt yourself and no one would know.” She rolled up a sleeve of her uniforms jumper, exposing a lumpy knot of scar tissue running around the inner corner of her elbow. “I got this from my third heat. There’s one like this on my right leg too, I nearly lost both of them. Luckily no one got hurt because of me…”
Speaking of the most hated boy in school, Draco suddenly stood, he rose like a king. Harry looked up to the enormous white faced clock above the doors - it was barely 10 minutes into dinner.
The table of Death Eaters began to laugh as the Dark Lord’s lipless mouth stretched, resembling a smile.
“Wow, really?” Draco asked in disbelief. It was one thing to want to be fucked, but to be proudly displayed? He felt blood fill his cheeks.
“He is too powerful of an Omega to be left unmated, and with you to influence his powers we may be able to win this war.”
If he ran away without the protection of Hogwarts wards he would be found in a day. He had no where to run.
“Then… send me somewhere else until it’s over. But please accept me back when I finish…” He appealed, feeling as if he was grasping for straws.
It did, but not in the way he was expecting. Instead of bursting open with its thing of nightmares, the larger top cabinet only creaked ajar. It was painfully slow, and from where he stood Draco couldn’t see what was easing the door open.
“Don’t know,” she purred, looking up at him briefly. “I’ve yet to decide.” She turned away to pull out her wand from her skirt's pocket, casting a gloss charm on her enviable pouting lips.
“Now, now, my dear boy, please.” Dumbledore seemed alarmed - his white eyebrows shot into his hairline, nearly under his lopsided nightcap. “You’re not in trouble. I’m very happy to see that you’re safe, I’m only trying to find answers. You said you were thinking, and then it just happened? Was there a trigger at all? Were you trying to call for the magic?”
“I’ve decided that it would be good for the both of you to make up and start fresh your relationship. How does organising the Halloween ball together sound? Each Friday night you will fulfill your detention by assisting the student council with preparations. This means decorations, organising entertainment, food planning.
hi fellas! sorry for this update taking so long. been really busy! i havent really had any chance to draw either so i might come back to this later and add a drawing or two. unsure of what i want to illustrate tho so thatll be fun to choose.
Draco stumbled back in surprise, too shocked to even make a sound, and suddenly Harry was coming forward with his wand out in an offensive way.
“Bloody Slytherins.” Ron said beside him, it was a mystery how any words were being understood with half a blueberry muffin in his mouth.
. He began to let out a long, triumphant chuckle - it was soft, and almost a sigh in nature, like it was made out of the wind that froze Hell over.
The only signs of life were Draco, Sirius, and the Hogwarts house elf, Niffler, who was summoned again to get his luggage on and off the train, then to march Draco back to Hogwarts Castle.
“You waited for me?” Malfoy said in surprise, whipping around, his expression open, honest, and very confused.
The moon and stars were out lighting up the castle and grounds.  Harry leaned against the ice-cold glass of the doors and sighed.  He had defeated Voldemort, the Ministry under Kingsley was rounding up remaining Death Eaters, and the 8th years were practically having an orgy in the new age of House cooperation.  What did it mean to be the Boy Who Lived now that they had won?  Harry threw back a sip of the drink he was still carrying.
“I will,” Justin said.  “Us muggleborn will show them purebloods how it’s done.”  Harry wished everyone would stop making everything about blood.  Younger students proudly boasted of being muggleborn these days with an arrogance that reminded Harry of pureblood supremacy.  It was exhausting.
Draco narrowed his eyes to a glare, but Harry thought he saw a hit of something else.  “Apparently it wasn’t as great as dying would have been.”
The sensation of Malfoy’s soft lips on his and the way his tongue had flicked in and out of his mouth filled his mind.  Harry picked up the pace as he climbed the stairs trying to forget the feel of Malfoy’s hands on his body.  When Harry finally summited the staircase, he was met by the gloriously cold, fresh Scottish air.  The drafty nature of the room had made Astrology lessons in his early years dreadful during the winter months, but it suited well for a good sobering up.
“Shut up, Pansy,” Malfoy said in a drawl.  “Let Potter finish.  The game sounds terribly fascinating.  Unless you somehow still have work after four days of being locked in this place that you would rather go do.”
“I know,” Harry said.  He brought his hand to Draco’s face and ran his thumb across his soft pink lips.  “I don’t care.” Draco tried to look away, but Harry wouldn’t let him.  “We all did stupid things because the adults around us failed us.  I got Sirius killed, my own godfather.”
Lavender and Parvati were painting Blaise’s toenails purple while his head resting in Pansy’s lap.  Padma was regaling everyone with a story about the time she accidentally got her entire family high when she was ten, bored, and her latent magic acted up.  Neville and Ernie were laughing and questioning her to pull out more details.  Justin’s drunken giggles caused him to lean his head against Hermione’s shoulder while she held her stomach laughing.  Ron was trying to look stoic while glancing at Pansy approximately every five seconds.  Dean was kissing the underside of Seamus’ chin.
There was a slight pause and then Neville burst out laughing.  Soon everyone was laughing except for Draco who was incredibly indignant.  “This isn’t civilized!”
“And in his natural habitat the Boy Who Wallowed can be found haunting the coldest most depressing places of Hogwarts Castle instead of enjoying delights of teenage debauchery with his friends.”
Harry marched directly to the door leading to the boy’s dormitory.  Before he went through the door he turned around and declared, “Draco is my boyfriend now, and I don’t care what anyone thinks about it.”
“Dare.”  Harry wished there was a table or something he could set his glass on because he wanted both hands free to kiss Malfoy.  That is what Malfoy would dare him to do, wasn’t it?
“No,” Harry said before he had time to think.  “I don’t want to be friends.”  Malfoy stepped back, his eyes wide.  Before he could go any further, Harry reached out and grabbed his arms.  He pulled the other boy towards him and brought their lips together.  He moved one of his hands into Draco’s hair and smiled to discover that it was even softer than he had imagined it.
With a wave of his wand, Charles sent copies of his case file to everyone. Harry braced himself before opening the folder. In his lifetime, he has seen a fair number of not-so-good things, things that will make a normal person's stomach turn. However, despite all of that, Harry still felt a bit queasy at the photo in front of him.
Four victims in a span of nearly four weeks. None of them seem to be connected except for the fact that they are all males. Their ages do not coincide with each other, their jobs are different, and their blood status are of high variance.
Thank you so much for reading! I really hope you're all liking this so far. I'm having so much fun writing this! I finished writing the chapter earlier than scheduled so I posted it right away~
"Cool…" Harry said in admiration. That would've been useful a year ago during one of their more nasty cases. He was hit with a flesh eating curse that did exactly what it was expected to do. It ate through the skin, flesh, and muscle of his right arm until only the bone was left. It took the Healers two full weeks to patch him up and re-grow his skin. Harry pointed to another group of potions, this time it was the ones directly in front of Adhil. "How about these? What do they do?"
And so, here Harry was, sat in his office with the faded ivory coloured envelope resting on his desk. He picked it up and examined it. The script in which his name was written in was familiar and so was the faint scent attached to it. He turned the envelope over and stared at the wax seal bearing a simple flower on it. It was far from the grand Malfoy crest that he expected to see. Harry furrowed his brows in confusion before letting out a deep sigh and opening the envelope. It only held a single piece of parchment not longer than 15-inches. The scent of Malfoy's perfume got stronger as he unfolded the paper inside.
"Ah, I'm afraid that's not possible. As much as I can let you take a look at the documents, I am under strict orders to not release a single copy of them to anyone but the chosen heir or representative."
"Good," Robards nodded in understanding. "I suggest visiting the Muggle pub. Take Weasley with you. There's no evidence that this is the work of Dark Wizards but we cannot say that it isn't either."
The Auror shook his head. He was still sold on the theory that a close proximity would be required for the device to work to its fullest capacity because of how little of Draco's magical signature he has managed to get into hollowed crystal. That means that Draco must have been in the room for the Masidec to glow.
"A gift from who?" Hermione asked, having heard what Harry said but not really understanding nor believing the words that came out from his mouth.
Two days later, Harry and Ron were just about to enter The Crystal once again when they caught sight of a flyer pasted on the pub's wall. It was a missing person's flyer of the loud man who frequented the pub: Hubert.
With those thoughts swirling inside his head and with Potter's fiery green eyes piercing through his soul, Draco decided that he's had enough of running and hiding away.
"That was eventful." Ron commented, grabbing his pint and taking a long swig from it. Harry saw his bestfriend discreetly take out his wand to cast a Muffliato charm over them. "Do you think any of them is our unsub?"
"Pot…Harry." Adhil greeted in a surprised tone. The blond clearly didn't expect Harry this early in the morning. He was all dressed up too and ready to leave the house. He looked quite dashing in Muggle clothing. Harry figured that Adhil's white shirt, grey pants, and black trench coat ensemble can be considered as casual but he still felt underdressed in front of him.
"Earl grey?" Harry inquired, pinpointing the reason why the tasted good. The blond merely hummed in confirmation as he sipped his own cup of tea.
Harry was just signing the last of his paperworks when he heard three knocks on his office door. He looked up to see his secretary's head peeking from the slightly opened door.
After a year of trying to be employed and pursuing apprenticeships - all of which have turned him down - he decided that it might be a good idea to venture into the Muggle world since no one would see him as ex-Deatheater Malfoy. There, he's just a blonde kid with an ugly tattoo. Harry didn't know the particulars of his stay there. All he knows is that Malfoy entered University, took up a language major for some reason and he was about to start his career as a professor until he and Harry went out for drinks to contemplate about the latter's lack of  direction in life. That night, Harry  mentioned how much he liked making stories and Malfoy jokingly said that Harry can write a book and that he would be more than happy to "make sure you don't make an utter fool of yourself". Here they are, years later, being friends and business partners of some sort.
"Well, you gotta run away from the place that hurt you, right?" Joseph said, picking up a glass and starting to clean it using a white cloth, similiar to how bartenders are usually seen doing. "Gotta start anew. My sister and I thought about going to Asia or some other far away country but we can only speak English so we went here. Can't say it's the best decision but we're making do with what we have. It was pure luck that the previous owner of this place wanted to venture into other business opportunities so he sold us this pub for two thirds of its original price. We get decent money and a place to sleep. A shit ton better than what we had before, to be honest."
He agreed to having tea every Sunday and so we did that. Apparently, tea wasn't strong enough. Halfway through my visit, he asked for a bottle of whiskey and poured it into his tea cup. Sodder got shitfaced drunk after two cups."
However, Harry's still torn about reporting this to the Ministry. On one hand, it's completely illegal and, on the other, whoever the people behind this are they sound like they just really want to help people.
"Back to Potter now, are we?" Harry teased, his lips quirking to the side in amusement. He felt giddy. Perhaps it's from the idea that he has finally found Draco or maybe it's from the prospect of spending time with the blond. Or both? He doesn't really know. For now, he'll just go with it.
"It's her!" Ron yelled, firing a Stupefy at the deranged woman who was now throwing a wide array of hexes at anyone near her.
"Well, our research team has managed to find a way to modify the potion. It's all hush hush, of course but I am such a huge fan of their work and---" Claudette stopped herself mid-sentence, realizing that she's still at work and should therefore maintain a professional appearance and behavior. "I mean, yes. I can assist you with your concern, Mr…?"
"Lower your wand this instance, you prat." Malfoy growled. Harry rolled his eyes and set his wand back on the end table, his stance relaxing. He rubbed his face with both hands and let out a loud groan.
Adhil, on the other hand, is an enigma. He's a young Potions Master who seems to dedicate his life on potions and the improvement of both Magical and Muggle medicine. Harry doesn't know who he is, where he came from, his family background, or anything else outside the title of "Potions Master". But Harry could tell that he's passionate. The way Adhil's eyes lit up while he was answering all of Harry's potion related questions brought a smile to the Auror's lips. He exudes the energy of a man who is content with his life. Someone who has found his calling and is living every single day doing what he loves.
"Congratulations to the both of you. These are enchanted necklaces. It will heat up once it senses danger befall the other pair's wearer. It also serves as a portkey that will immediately transport you to your beloved. May the two of you live long and prosper in each other's love."
"I think I could spare five minutes." A deep melodic voice suddenly spoke from somewhete behind Harry, cutting off whatever the Auror was about to say. He turned around to see a tall, dark-skinned woman dressed in ivory white Healer robes that indicated their status as head of one the department. They sported a buzz cut that's been dyed blond and high cheekbones that intimated Harry just a tad bit. He would've been more intimidated if the Healer didn't have dark circles under their eyes paired with a tired smile.
The symbols from the wax seal and the tag were quite similar. They were almost identical in the way that their flower petals unfurled. If one is going to assume that Harry has already memorized each minute detail of these illustrations, they will be correct in their assumptions. And so, with the flowers' appearance imprinted into his mind, it is quite easy to point out the similarities between the symbols that are on the wax seal and tag to the one on Sonya's letter.
"Are you a hundred percent certain that this is what you want to do?" He asked. "Not eighty-five nor ninety-nine but a one hundred percent?"
"Oh, please." She dismissed their actions with a roll of her eyes before running the blade of the dagger on her palm, cutting the delicate skin and letting the blood ooze out and drip onto the box. She did all of this without flinching, the slight twitch of her brows being the only visible sign of discomfort.
"Do whatever the fuck I want?" Harry started to say as he pushed himself off the table and slowly walked over until he was face-to-face with the blond. Draco looked at him warily. "Anything?"
If Harry was going to be completely honest with himself, he doesn't know what's scarier: an insane Dark wizard hell bent on using the truly wicked spells in their arsenal or a strong individual, not necessarily dark nor insane but strong enough to literally rip a man to shreds? He does know that whoever is behind all of this is extremely dangerous and that they should act as soon as possible to solve this case.
Draco let go of Potter's hand, letting him remove the necklace that he has worn for the better part of the last five years.
You all mean so much to me because this fic is the VERY FIRST multi-chaptered that I've finished. It's such a milestone for me. Your comments have kept me going whenever I feel like I'm not a good enough writer.
It makes Harry's heart ache whenever he thinks about the fact that everyone has already seemed to forget about Draco. While he's still doing everything he can to atleast know about the blond's wherebouts and ensure that he's okay, others have already moved on with their lives. By others, he meant the former Slytherins who have known Draco far longer than anyone else. Harry's happy that his friends are happy with their lives but he often wonders if they ever think about Draco. He approached Pansy about it a few years ago – probably after his 15th visit to get information about the blond – but she shut him down and told him that if Draco doesn't want to be found, he ought to be left alone. She trusts that his bestfriend is now living the peaceful life that he always longed for. Although, she still refused to show him the letter Draco wrote for her nor did she answer the question of whether or not she's still in correspondence with him. Harry and Pansy had quite the shouting match in her office at The Quibbler and she wasn't even fazed by the threat of being accused of "withholding evidence". In the end, they have agreed to not talk about Draco anymore lest Pansy hexes his bollocks off.  It's not only Pansy, though. Two years into handling the Malfoy Manor case Ron and Hermione have started to look at him weirdly, similar to how they did in fifth year when they thought he was being possessed by Voldemort, especially during their weekly dinners where Harry would go on and on about his theories, the memories he was presented with, and anything that involves the Malfoy Manor case. The next week, Hermione snapped and told him that he's "being way too obsessed with Malfoy, Harry! You should really give that case to a different Auror. Someone without any prior attachments to him. If you don't do it, I'll tell Robards to get you off that case myself". Since then, he didn't talk about the Malfoy Manor case anymore. Things would probably progress faster if he had his friends' help but Hermione and Pansy share the same sentiment: Draco Malfoy wouldn't be found if he doesn't want to be found.
i also have a teeny bit of chapter 24 written (5k i think looking at it) and chapter 25 (2k? 3k??) and i actually think this fic might turn out to be 26 chapters long. the way i write is an absolute head fuck im soo sorry everyone. i was a machine with the updates in the beginning but as soon i started dabbling with plot and making things make some form of sense i started to get lost lol. FORGIVE ME!!!!
“You two as well…” The old Alpha turned to the two Betas, McGonagal and Hagrid. McGonagall looked a little stung. “I have a few things to ask Mr. Malfoy in private and he may only need his Head of House present.”
"You know she told you to call her Andy." Harry said, poking Draco's side. "Aunt Andromeda makes her feel 'ancient'."
"Can't. The police don't like us. Who do you think they'll believe? A couple of immigrants or a dude who has spent all his life in this country and will most likely die here too?"
"And who might this person be?" The Healer asked as the microwave let out a loud beep, signalling that the food inside was already heated up. Vartan took their food out and sat in front of Harry.
"We actually went over to Pansy and Luna's the other day to take a closer look at the necklaces," George added. "They have runes written on the back to keep the enchantments in."
Harry looked around and saw a number of restaurants and shops that surrounded the square. He was tempted to grab a quick bite before heading over to where he was supposed to go but, once again, he pushed down the gnawing feeling of hunger and walked towards one of the streets to Adhil Blanchett's house.
"It seems like your fates are intertwined no matter how hard you try to run away from it." Severus commented, sitting back  on the armchair. "You have always been obsessed with him and I do recall a time when that feeling was mutual."
He didn't regret leaving though. At that time, it felt like the wisest choice and it still does. He feels happy here. Relaxed. Calm. He is finally free from other people's expectations, from being the heir that he was raised to be, from being the prejudiced little git that he was molded to be. Not only was his fortune entirely his but it was also the fruits of his labours – having earned every galleon, sickle, and knut all by himself with nothing but his abilities coupled with hard work.
"Potter." The blond warned, gripping the Auror's wrist to try and stop him from doing what it was that he was about to do.
A stranger whose face gave him an odd sense of familiarity, whose voice was also familiar but different at the same time.
Harry saw Pansy's eyes darken as she looked at the phallic item in her wife's hand, probably already imagining their future bedroom activities that will involve the said item. Luna only stared at it curiously, looking at the pink vibrator in from every angle until she found whatever it was that she was looking for. Harry realized that she found it when the object started to make a low whirring sound while it vibrated in her hand.
"Exactly," Malfoy said. "Who's going to drag your ass out of bed every morning to make sure that you're a fully functioning member of society? You would die without me, Scarhead."
"How long has it been glowing?" He asked, walking over to the woman while holding up the pendant of the device. Sonya shrugged and went back to sorting the miniscule beetle eyes.
"Besides, the pouch was found on the mantlepiece." Ginny added, speaking for the first time since Harry saw the gift from Draco.
The next day found Harry standing in front of The Quibbler's office that stood in the less crowded part of Diagon Alley. After the war, people started to take The Quibbler more seriously seeing as they never swayed from the truth. Published eccentric articles? Yes. But slander? Outright lies? The publication now headed by Luna Lovegood has a clean slate. Not to mention its reputation for not caring about which side of the war their staff fought for. Thus, Harry was only slightly surprised when he found out that Pansy Parkinson worked here, as their publisher nonetheless.
"I'm here to see Healer Vartan." He told the wizard behind the desk who seemed to be quite busy writing down things on a piece of paper.
"Judging by the way the skin and flesh looks, it looks like it's been forcefully ripped away from its joint," He explained. "Only a handful of spells are known to do that and all of which are considered to be quite dark, intended to make the victim suffer. Either a spell did this or it was done through brute force. Nevertheless, it tells us that whoever did this – whoever is doing this – they're doing it either from insanity or from sheer rage and hatred."
Harry heard the fireplace flare to life. He cast a quick Tempus charm and saw that it was exactly a minute past 8PM. He slammed his forehead on the desk and let out a frustrated groan because he knows exactly what's about to happen.
The next day, Harry filed a one-week leave of absence from work. Once it was approved, he immediately went to France bringing nothing but a bag that contained essentials, the pouch that Luna gave him, and the version of the Masidec that he wore a few days back.
However, despite its kinder appearance, it still really isn't a home for Harry. It's merely a place where he sleeps and resides after work. It lacks the feeling of safety and belongingness that he felt when he was at Hogwarts. He thought about quitting the Auror force and becoming a professor at Hogwarts just to feel that homey feeling again but there are just too many bad memories there that are sure to haunt him for days upon end. Not only that but he also has a job to do.
"Do you have an appointment with them?" was the other man's response. Not bothering to look up at whoever was speaking.
Harry set his own cup down – appreciating the beautiful floral details that it has – before replying.
Finally, the Auror office got a report last night of another missing wizard. William Proudfoot, 25, was a security guard at Gringotts. He and his partner, Brian Cole were on their way to the Leaky Cauldron to get a pint after their shift when Proudfoot just disappeared from Cole's side while the latter got distracted by the display at Quality Quidditch Supplies. According to Cole, he was just admiring the newly released HyperSweep 5000 but, when he turned to talk to Proudfoot, he found nothing but empty space beside him. He didn't know where his partner went because he didn't hear the "crack" that resulted from apparating. He highly doubts that there's a Portkey nearby.
"They all have daffodils on them, drawn in similar if not the exact same way. Your shop is even named The Daffodil." Harry continued. "A simple research was all it took for me to find out that daffodils are also called 'narcissus'. Quite close to Narcissa, don't you think?"
"Roughly five years ago…? I thought that he would rather work in the Ministry like his father than be an intern here." Vartan said with a shrug as they continued to eat. "How did he go missing though?"
Harry rarely has the time to mull over his life, given his busy schedule but whenever he does, he finds that he is quite unsatisfied about what it has become. Yes, he has his friends that he loves and deeply cares for no matter how strange their circle has become. He doesn't have a mad man chasing him across the country intent on murdering him. He's a well-respected Auror and his life is mostly peaceful now since the excitement over "The Saviour" is wearing off. Harry really can't say that his life is boring because being an Auror is as exciting as it gets. They do have to deal with multitudes of paperwork after every case but there's still action in his line of work. However, despite the honour that goes with being an Auror, he doesn't really get the satisfaction that he expected. Despite the variety of cases that he gets involved in, he still thinks that his life has become monotonous in a not-so-good way. Harry thinks that he should like monotony. He thinks that he ought to appreciate it after almost eight years of being subjected to the unknown and not knowing whether he'll survive the next ordeal that he'll face. But he finds that he doesn't like this particular type of monotony.
By the end of her tirade, the trio were sporting varying degrees of shock and guilt on their faces. The former Slytherin revelled in their expressions despite knowing that Draco wouldn't have wanted her to spill his secrets in broad daylight but the proud and righteous Gryffindors needed to hear it. They needed to hear that they wouldn't have survived and triumphed over their challenges without Draco's help, without the help of the "evil Slytherin git" that they hate.
"That's true," Ron agreed. "I say let's go back here tomorrow as different Muggles and see what happens. Maybe we can even strike up a conversation with the bartender. This place looks good but it makes me uneasy. I got a feeling that what we just saw happens on a regular basis."
"Good afternoon, I'm Auror Harry Potter from the British Ministry of Magic," He began. "I'm looking for a Mr. Adhil Blanchet…?"
If Malfoy accepts the job he won't be Harry's editor anymore. That's just impossible. Malfoy wouldn't have the time.
"Wow…" The couple breathed out. Harry commissioned an artist to make a magical portrait for the newlyweds. While they did pose for their own portraits, Harry wanted to preserve the memory of their wedding day, where the two brides stood face-to-face in front of the wedding arch, holding each other's hands, and looking at the other with genuine expressions of love and happiness. That's what his two friends are looking at, as of the moment. Their wedding in the eyes of the crowd. Their relationship in a way that their friends saw it. Portrait Pansy looked down on their intertwined hands and looked back up to Portrait Luna's eyes. They were glowing. It's like they're enclosed in their own little bubble. A bubble that no one dared to pop.
Draco didn't care about any of that though. He spat out things so frankly and ruthlessly no matter what the other person might feel or think.
"Have you found out what happened here? Are there any casualties?" Harry inquired. He was well into his lunch of turkey sandwich and a can of soda when his secretary barged into his office, face stoic but eyes holding a slightly alarmed look. She spoke with utmost professionalism as she placed the case file on his desk. "There's been a situation, Auror. Potter. Head Auror Robards specifically asked that you take the lead. Auror Weasley's team is already on their way there but nothing has been confirmed." Ron's team specializes in the Dark Arts seeing as they are part of the Office for the Detection and Confiscation of Counterfeit Defensive Spells and Protective Objects. They're called whenever things are tricky because the perpetrators are suspected to be dabbling in dark magic and artefacts. If they're being called in, the situation could be more than just a bit dangerous. Harry, on the other hand, worked as the Head of the Investigation Department. Through the years, it has evolved from being an office that focuses on tracking down dark wizards to actually being more involved in the "investigation" of criminals as a whole. Not just dark wizards.
Harry expected a response but was instead met with silence. He took a deep breath and faced Draco…or Adhil…or whoever it was that he's talking to right now. He faced the other person and looked straight into their steel grey eyes. Eyes that, Harry could tell, were shining with multitudes of emotions that he cannot discern. Shock? Absolutely. Fear? Maybe. Confusion? Perhaps.
"Yeah, but it's only a slight tingle. The smaller the disturbance, the less we feel it." Luna replied.
"You can't tell me how to live my life, Malfoy." Harry hated how easy it was to say the blond's name with such disdain as if the two of them are rivals once again. Maybe the venom that his tone held is because of how close Draco actually got to how Harry actually felt. None of his other friends seem to realize what the blond did. Perhaps they did realize it but they were just too afraid to tell him or they thought it wasn't their place to point it out.
"So, are you saying that Malfoy's magic was powerful enough to rip through the regulations set by the Ministry as if they were cotton candy?" Harry perused.
Harry thought long and hard as he sat there, his beer turning warm with every minute that passes. He's wondering if he should report this to the Ministry so that he can official permission to investigate or if he should just go there by himself and pray to whatever deity that what he heard tonight will lead him to the person that he's been looking for all these years.
"But, being a Hogwarts professor will be good for you! It'll open more opportunities! You won't be…you know."
Later that evening, Harry and Ron are back at 'The Crystal' polyjuiced as different Muggles. This time, they sat by the bar and ordered pints of beer from Joseph, the bartender.
Daffodils seem to be a constant theme when it comes to Adhil and, if Harry's hypothesis is correct then he knows the exact reason why.
"Sometimes, I just feel like I've taken you away from everyone," Draco continued. "Your friends, your family… your home."
"It's probably bloody expensive." The other man muttered, cheeks red and eyes firmly focused on the beer foam in his glass.
"He's not dead." Harry insisted. "His…his letter didn't sound like he was going to kill himself anytime soon. Leave? Yes. But die? I don't think so."
"Well, he isn't the aggressive sibling. He just dropped out of school didn't he? Probably got tired of all the academic shenanigans. It's his sister who got expelled."
They were joined by Millicent and Daphne just a few minutes after they have started digging into the dishes that both Pansy and Luna worked hard to cook. The evening passed by in a jolly manner with the newlyweds telling them stories about their month long honeymoon – often including too much information courtesy of Luna – and with the rest of the group catching them up on news about Wizarding London. Millicent and Daphne regaled them all with stories about their adopted daughter, Celestine. Neville, as the current Herbology professor, told tales about Hogwarts while Ginny talked about her time as chaser for the Holyhead Harpies. Blaise boasted about his latest sexual conquests and how he now has blackmail material against half of the pureblood circles that he's in. Ron and Hermione, on the other hand, shared their plans to renovate their house to prepare for any future children that they might have. All Harry could do was listen to his friends' tales. He couldn't really share anything with them seeing as Auror matters are confidential and any time spend outside the Ministry is spent on finding clues either about Draco's whereabouts or about the latest case that they have at hand. Harry tells himself that he is perfectly content with hearing about his friends' lives and that he doesn't need to do anything spontaneous or exciting. He just has to focus on his job for the time being.
"I…I am the Auror in charge of his case." Harry said, trying to keep his tone steady. "I have to find him no matter what it takes."
Harry's brows furrowed as he looked down at his table. If what "Kevin" is saying is true, then that could be the work of wizards illegally meddling into Muggle medicine. The wizarding world has long discovered the cure for cancer. It was a potion that the patient had to take regularly everyday for around two to three months, depending on their initial health status. This is why wizards and witches live on for atleast a hundred years. They don't let physical and biological ailments take their lives. They will only either die from old age, murder, or a magical disease. Nowadays, cancer is in the same league as a really intense flu, to the wizarding world at least. It was awful to have it, yes. But it's not the end of the world.
I can say with certainty that this year will be very stressful for me, but it was never necessary for my father, but when he intentionally failed to bring a Potter experience to Voldemort, he passed or his burden was on me, now he will also be borne by me . Dark mark on my arm and how he has a secret family secret mission and his plans in the second to prevent his complete ascent from which will derive the complete loss of hope beside the light, but this is just something that a Malfoy can to know, nobody else, and the best way to defeat an enemy who is your neighbor and to know all your plans before everyone else.
With a slow pace at first and being careful I put another finger on, but when I start to increase the pace and insert another finger Harry starts to moan louder and louder until he begs for more. Removing my fingers from it, I give my penis a few strokes and slowly begin to penetrate its entrance, carefully until it is buried deep inside it. Kissing passionately, I enter and leave at an initially slow pace and increase throughout the act, while giving several strokes synchronized with them on your penis.
When Harry starts to stimulate my nipples I direct my hand and undo all of his clothes, repeating the same action on myself and when I finish I wrap my hand around Harry's penis. That magnificent member a little shorter than mine but definitely thicker. After a few strokes I change our positions and place myself on top of him, looking at his eyes surprised by the sudden action, but soon closing when we kiss again. Soon I open his legs, conjure up a little lubricant, but look at him waiting for his confirmation. With a strong wave I place a finger close to the opening and start causing it to enter, inserting the first finger slowly so as not to cause too much discomfort, pulling out a stronger groan from Harry and mine earlier.
- So it's true, what I suspected, you're a death eater. - Potter said directing his gaze to Draco, who in turn, locked his eyes on the ceiling and waited for the best of Potter's reaction, swallowing.
Breathless and tired from their most recent struggle, they look at each other ... pupils stretching as they realize their closeness.
When his knees found the end of the bed, he lowered Draco slowly onto the sheets while kissing his neck. Harry opened his eyes and looked at Malfoy's shape, with his platinum hair almost as light as the sheets itself. He was red and his eyes were full of lust.
The spell hit Malfoy's arm and hissed him in pain. Malfoy then thought: the quickest way to get rid of potter is to disarm him, so I could just go to the damn closet. It was done like that ...
Potter, I know how to do this, I don't need you to tell me what to do! I also know that adding diced valerian sprigs with ditanny powder instead of liquid dittany will make this potion effective for men as well and long lasting, lasting up to an entire year.
Now, now, I was together with Harry Potter, but now it is one of the most potent fertility workouts, as it is important for my NEWT.
A blush went up my neck when I realized how lucky I was that Potter wasn't legiminens and I quickly let go of those thoughts before answering him ...
It was still the beginning of the school year and I'm already stranded here with the golden boy, but what a fate! I don't know what the problem is with this new professor Slughorn, I'm the best poem since I can remember and now I'm stuck in auxiliary potion classes with the precious boy from the Gryffindor house. Is not fair! If anything should be a help, but in fact I am helping, because apparently our favorite lion is even less me, as he does those extraordinary things during classes, it doesn't even occur to me how!
Desperate Dravo tried to put his arm against his chest but Potter was quicker and grabbed his wrist.
And then almost at the end of the race Harry sees ... the door to the coming and going room, the training room of the dumbledores army, appearing.
Harry walks away and takes off his shirt and robes. He then rests on top of Draco and runs his hands over his pale, defined body as his after years of playing quidditch. Warming up the weather, both Draco and Harry undo the rest of their clothes, enjoying each other's shapes.
After not even 5 seconds Draco feels Potter's lips on his mark and, when he looks, he sees the image of Potter, the boy who defeated and would melt the creator of the black mark on his arm, with his eyes locked on his while he kisses your brand.
Here I was ... I never thought I would get so low. I just ran away from Potter, I know he suspects me and is close to being able to reveal the truth, but I can't give him that satisfaction.
Little did they both know that the next nine months and the next would be a little troubled, as someone, during the sex of two powerful wizards, forgot to use protection, thus creating a powerful key that would take one of the most powerful, wealthy and ancient families, the Malfoys, to the side of the light during the war ... A beautiful baby named Scorpius Hyperion Potter Malfoy, the perfect copy of a Malfoy but with the eyes of his other father, Harry Potter.
When I looked at him I almost missed my breath. I don't know if it was because I was still too sleepy to think straight or it was just my very repressed homosexuality, but Potter was a dream. That unkempt black hair, those emerald green eyes, the caramel-colored skin on his cheeks and bare neck. He almost looked like the person from his many erotic dreams that kept him awake when he shouldn't, that made me beg for more kisses, to be faster while filling me up.
Putting on his slippers Harry went to his chest and then got ready to start his day. Once dressed he decided he should probably go to the kitchens to order something to eat, so there he went.
Now a little more personal presentation ... my name is Draco, I am 15 years old, I do not have sex with everyone at Hogwarts, I am arrogant, detached, cold and petty, but this is just my ice prince mask, for those who know as family (my parents, pansy and blaise) I am very sticky, considerate and with a huge passion for our dearest Gryffindor, not that I have ever said here only the presumptuous ones, let's just say what I never denied.
But Draco had forgotten a very important detail, his black mark was lying on his left forearm and before he was able, Potter removed the blessed shirt.
We were so close to each other, still holding each other and instinctively I approach my lips to his cautiously, but he does not step back, instead he also moves forward and our lips meet in the middle. A sensation so light that it feels like I'm floating in space but at the same time I can feel that wonderful feeling in my stomach that I never felt before. Instead of moving away from each other to get air, we both lay on the floor, him on top of me while he kisses my neck. That extraordinary sensation goes through my whole body while with one hand I grab your soft hair and with the other I grab your shoulder to make sure this is really happening. Gradually my blood increases in speed and begins to move south in my body. As Harry undoes my shirt I start to move my groin against his in rhythmic movements, triggering the same reaction from him.
Harry's wand jumped out of his hand, and as soon as it fell to the ground he saw Malfoy start running towards the seventh floor. Without a wand, he runs after Malfoy.
After a few seconds of caressing my cheek, he asks me what's going on and I, caught in a moment of weakness, tell him everything, from the Malfoys' plan in this war to my current despair, and when I finish I feel as if someone had taken a weight off me, he took that weight off, but not quite yet.
Welcome, let me introduce you, my valued narrative voice inside my head, I am Draco Lucius Malfoy, direct heir to the name Malfoy, indirectly to the name Lestrange and Rosier (for lack of direct thoroughbred heirs) and all its riches; of course I could also say for the name Black, but my first name Sirius has a godson, but I don't care about that as probably the show or the greatest heir of the century here in England. I am pure blood and like any good son of high society I am for a perfect vision of the book "The Sacred 28" and that everyone expects me to marry and have children with a pure woman like me.
They both moan as Harry shoves his cock inside Draco, painfully slowly so as not to arrive soon. Draco feels deliciously full and Harry fantastically squeezed into the blonde he faces full of lust and desire.
For all and no reason, it is not known who took the first step, but after moments of facing each other, it just happened.
As I speak, I start preparing the potion in my own way and see that Potter does the same. Both as soon as possible to see who wins, but like anything in this life I couldn't wait for it to end well, it would be very naive of me, so I try to dump my ingredients into the pot, Potter does exactly the same, and of course, resulting in a big explosion, directly over us.
We both know that we will have to pretend that nothing happened, as we are obviously on opposite sides of the war, both because of his status and because of my previous words and the now obvious black mark on my arm. We stayed together for a while just together but then we put our clothes back in their initial state and each one goes back to their common room as if nothing had happened, but not before a kiss goodbye and a warning from me to be careful from now on, because in less than a week he knew that I would have to let Voldemort's followers in and he couldn't do anything about it.
Merlin ... because it always has to be Potter, it's no longer enough to fix that damn closet and now I still have to confront him in the morning ... because I do.
-I WAS ALREADY PLACING MY INGREDIENTS, WHICH WENT THROUGH THIS INCULT HEAD TO THINK IT WOULD BE SAFE TO PLACE YOURS AT THE SAME TIME SCARHEAD!
-Hey Draco, what are you doing up here so early instead of hiding in the dungeons with your henchmen.
Seeing that smile on Malfoy's face with his hand on his jaw, Harry couldn't resist. He approached Draco and kissed him again, but this time tenderly.
That was the last time we got together, since if it continued like that, something worse could happen, despite having a passion for him I couldn't show, I have a mask to keep for the good of those I care for and I have to keep it at all the cost
As Harry descended the many squares towards the dungeons he found himself attracted by a platinum blonde head that headed towards the seventh floor. Confused to see the Slytherin so early and so far from his usual territory, Harry cannot let these thoughts not further fuel his suspicion that Draco Malfoy, the infamous slytherin prince, would have become a death eater during the summer break. and that he was doing something more than a simple "innocent" act of tormenting the lives of students in other homes.
When Draco grabs Harry's black hair and groans, his whole body shaking from the work done by Potter, Harry conjures up lubricant and puts a finger inside Draco, who arches his back. When Harry removes the third finger; after several moments of Draco moaning and begging for Harry and Harry getting more and more excited; Harry puts lubricant on his penis and aligns it with Draco's entrance.
Neither of them could break free from the passionate kiss ... but when they did, gasping for air, they were able to catch a glimpse of the room that was provided to them ... it was a small, cozy room with an arranged double-colored bed with the whiteest sheets and three equally white pillows.
Now knowing about the bed in that room, Harry took Malfoy in his arms while kissing him and took Malfoy to the bed.
- SHUT UP, AS YOU DARE, AFTER PUT MY FATHER IN AZKABAN, INSINE THAT YOU JOIN THEM! Draco shouted in exasperation. Luckily no one was up at this hour.
On the ground they both start to fight, turning on top of each other, beating their fists on each other until ... Harry stands on top and grips Malfoy's wrists over his head and grips his legs with his own.
He couldn't stand to wait any longer and he went up to Malfoy, kissing and making love bites on his neck ... he doesn't know why but Harry felt possessive and wanted to mark Draco as much as possible to show everyone that Malfoy was already taken. .when he reached the hem of his shirt he looked up as if asking permission to continue. Authorization given to him by a very breathless Draco, who arched his back under Potter's ministries.
“I thought I had made that rather obvious.”  Malfoy folded his arms across his chest.  If he kissed the corner of that pout, Harry wondered if it would turn into a smile.
“I wanted to be your friend,” Malfoy said.  “When we first came to Hogwarts.  I wish that had happened.  I think it could have changed things.”  Malfoy grabbed the bottom of Harry’s latest Weasley sweater.  “The green looks good with your eyes, Harry.”  Draco emphasized his name, and Harry swallowed.  “That’s a Slytherin color.”
Malfoy grabbed his face and Harry closed his eyes, preparing himself for Draco to pull them hard together in rough kiss. But then Malfoy’s lips gently brushed against his.  He gasped in surprise.  Malfoy slid his tongue inside Harry’s mouth and Harry lost himself in the gentle licks and swirls of the Slytherin boy’s tongue.  One of Malfoy’s hands gently removed his glasses while the other tugged through his hair, increasing Harry’s arousal.  Harry considered that he should probably shove Malfoy off him now, but that seemed like a stupid thing to do.
After taking a swig he passed the cup to Draco who was watching him with slightly suspicious eyes but drank.  Harry used his finger to wipe away a bit of foam that stuck to the corner of Draco’s mouth.
“I’ll move into the Manor with Mother, maybe get a studio somewhere.  Some potions work perhaps.  I don’t need money, and no one is going to want to hire me.”  Though he said it with a cavalier intonation, Harry could tell, from all those years studying Malfoy, that he wasn’t as unconcerned as he wanted everyone to believe.
“Like what?” Harry asked breathing in the cold night air in the hopes that it would decrease the rate of his fast-beating heart.
Her answer was met with some catcalls.  Parkinson said, “Sorry Draco love, even you can’t compete with my looks and Blaise’s bank account.”
Harry glanced around the circle, but no one was staring at him or Malfoy anymore.  Everyone was watching Padma and Neville dance while Justin sang a very bad rendition of the Weird Sister song ‘Do the Hippogriff.’  His hands itched to reach forward and grab the collar of Malfoy’s clearly very expensive shirt so that he would fall back into his lap like how Dean was lounging in Seamus’.  Had Malfoy intentionally turned so that Harry could see the profile of his lips mouthing every word along with Justin’s performance?
Harry broke his eye contact with Malfoy to look at Hermione.  “Living is agony if you forget why you’re living.” He looked back a Malfoy, who refused to look anything but sure of himself.  “That’s what it was like to die.” Harry paused, then said.  “Truth or dare, Malfoy?”
“I dare you to throw that glass into the wall.”  Disappointment welled inside of Harry, so he did the only thing he could do and threw his glass hard into the wall of the Astronomy Tower.  It did help him feel better.
Malfoy sank to the ground where he stood, which meant Harry was stuck looking at the back of the stupid git’s head.  Despite Malfoy acting like the prick he was, Harry now knew with a certainty that he wanted nothing more than to reach out and run his fingers through his soft blonde hair.  He also realized that by kissing Malfoy back in front of his peers, that probably counted as coming out as not straight.
“Because I’m drunk and you’re hot.”  Harry grinned and Draco groaned and leaned into Harry’s chest hiding his face in the crook of his neck.  “Now I’m cold.”
Draco Malfoy was nervous.  Harry grabbed his hand and pulled him into the dormitory.  Malfoy slackened his grip, but Harry held tight.  Laughter and the raging fire greeted them as they entered.  No one looked up from where they were all draped over furniture, the floor, and each other.
The eighth year dorms were small since it didn’t even need to house a full year of students, yet confined as they were, everyone seemed to be in each other’s way.  At last Ernie Macmillan had rallied a large group to the common room where they were currently engaged in a debate on what game they should play.  Justin Finch-Fletchley suggested a Wizard’s Chess tournament, and Padma Patil mentioned Exploding snap which was shot down by Parvati and Lavender.  Seamus didn’t say much of anything, but sat next to Dean with his arms crossed across his chest.
“What exactly is that?” Pansy Parkinson asked.  Harry ignored her tone.  Pansy always sounded annoyed.
“Ah yea, a quick shag so you can sell the sordid tale to Rita Skeeter or some other Prophet bloodsucker.”
“No wonder Weasley broke up with you.  You need lessons in romance like Snape needs shampoo.”  Draco was tugging at the sleeves of his shirt and looking away as he spoke.  He was nervous, Harry realized.  It was cute.  Draco Malfoy was flustered, and Harry was the reason.
Harry backed away from the group happy to notice that Hermione and Ron were so consumed by the game that they weren’t taking notice of him.  Neville sent him a look though which Harry dismissed with a smile and tugging on his shirt collar to indicate that he was hot.  Before anyone else took notice, he slipped out into the corridor.
“Right.”  Harry rolled his eyes.  “Malfoy, would you want to be my boyfriend even though its absurd and probably doomed and no one will like it?”
Harry felt his heart beat quicken.  Malfoy reached for his drink and to his surprise, Harry felt disappointment seep through him.
“Draco,” Harry said, finding confidence in Malfoy’s lack of any.  Their eyes met and Harry wondered how he had lived in the same dormitory as Malfoy for eight months and not ravished him until now.  “I think I’ve liked you for a long time.”
Harry searched Draco’s face and saw his own uncertainty mirrored back at him.  “Do you want to, er, do more of that?”  Draco raised his eyebrows.  “I mean.  My boyfriend.”  Harry shook his head.  Words weren’t working.  “Kissing and sex and pissing off the wizarding world.”
A few cups of Fire Whiskey spilled over, and Malfoy laughed.  Ron was on his feet with his wand out.  Hermione was at Harry’s side ready to placate him. Harry gripped his wand hard in his hand.  What the fuck was wrong with Malfoy kissing him like that and then asking that question?  He took a deep breath as the new school therapist was always on him to do when he got angry.  He gently shooed Hermione away.
“Sit down, Ron,” Harry said calmly. Draco was standing up now.  His clothes dry due to a charm cast by Pansy and the cups in place thanks to Ernie.  Hermione held out a cup for him to take a drink from but Harry shook his head.  Harry stood and moved so he was inches away from Malfoy.  “It was peaceful.  I was standing at King’s Cross Station, and Dumbledore was there.  He told me I could take a train and see my parents again, Sirius, Cedric, Lupin, Dobby, everyone who was ever taken unjustly.  He said, because a part of me still lived on in Voldemort, I could also return.  But where I was, I felt no pain, no worry, no fear.  No one could hurt me again.  Then I remembered.  The entire British wizarding world was depending on me, so I left.  I returned to my body, which felt too small, like a cage.  I could feel every wound like it was fresh, and every emotion hit me like stunner to the chest.  Dying is peaceful, living is agony.”
“And tomorrow we can talk about how I meant everything I’ve said to you tonight.”  Draco pulled his sweater up and Harry let it com off over his head.  “But right now, I’m going to ravish you.”
“I’ve got some,” Dean and Ernie said simultaneously.  They laughed and both accioed their bottles which were then placed in the center by Hermione.
Harry laughed and let the door slam shut behind him.  Harry brought Draco over to his bed and threw him down on the Gryffindor sheets.  Draco rolled his eyes.  “Well isn’t this the perfect picture of house unity.”
They were an odd group.  Despite having spent the last two months living together, it was still awkward to try and forget old rivalries and prejudices.  Harry, however, didn’t have the energy to care about house politics anymore.  Usually they were busy enough with their studies that awkward situations could easily be avoided.  However, it was now the fourth day that classes had been cancelled due to the constant rain, sleet, and snow storms plaguing most of the castle where the charms meant to fix the damaged walls and rooves had broken down.  House elves had been bringing meals to the common rooms to which students were restricted while the teachers and a dispatch from the Ministry worked on solving the problem.
“If you two are done with your little moment,” Parkinson said annoyed, “then the rest of us would like to return to our game.”
Inside the stairs was dark and Harry’s eyes hadn’t adjusted yet when Draco grabbed him and pushed him against the wall for a kiss.  It was strangely easy, Harry thought as he relaxed into the other boy’s lips, to transition from polite nods and the occasional quip to making out in stairwells.  “Yes, Harry.  I want to be your boyfriend.”
Malfoy began kissing him with greater urgency.  His tongue was fiercer now and their teeth clanked together.  Malfoy pulled away, but Harry was not disappointed for long, as he began to kiss and nip his way down Harry’s neck.  It took a fierce reminder of everyone else’s presence to keep Harry from moaning with pleasure.  This was going to bruise he thought.  Malfoy returned back to Harry’s lips with a few last kisses, then pulled away. Harry looked straight into Malfoy’s blue eyes.  He had no idea what the other boy was thinking.  Silence filled the room louder than any catcalling could have.
“Malfoy, Draco,” Harry said.  Draco brought their lips together, effectively shutting him up, even as his hands nimbly undid the buttons and zipper.  In moments his trousers and pants were in a pile around his feet.  The cold air against his skin provided a sobering moment for Harry which did not last long.  Draco fell to his knees and took Harry into his mouth and it was better than Felix Felicis a million times over.  Clearly this was not Draco’s first blowjob, even if it was Harry’s.  Draco’s hands grasped his butt, pulling them close together, his head bobbing as he sucked Harry’s cock.  Harry had mistakenly thought that sex would be a bit better than wanking himself off.  When Draco looked up at him, Harry felt himself cumming and tried to pull away, but Draco held him there and sucked the cum from him.  He swallowed and then licked Harry’s cock like it was an ice cream cone.
Hermione met Justin’s eyes and said without hesitation.  “Advada Malfoy, Fuck Pansy, Marry Zambini.”
Draco released him and began to race down the stairs.  Harry grinned and followed, pinning him against the wall for another kiss when he caught him.  They all but fell down the stairs together between kisses, until at last they reached the landing with the door to the 8th year dormitory.  Harry traced the iron shape which was mounted on the door and the lock clicked open.
Harry led Draco over to where the alcohol was, realizing in that moment that they had left a half drunk bottle of Fire Whiskey at the top of the Astronomy Tower which he would have to fetch in the morning.  Without letting go of Draco’s hand, he poured a glass of Gavant’s Hard Butterbeer.
Padma proceeded to dare Ernie to perform his own rendition of Celestina Warbeck’s A Cauldron Full of Hot, Strong Love. Ernie then asked Lavender if she and Parvati had ever experimented with each other.  She said it was more than experimentation, and Parvati glared at her and took a drink.  Lavender dared Blaise to kiss Dean, who rather seemed to like it Harry noticed.  Then Blaise dared Parvati to kiss Padma, but she drank while Seamus, Ernie, and Neville pelted Blaise with Bertie Botts Every Flavor Beans for even suggesting it.  A group vote was called and Blaise was made to take a shot.
