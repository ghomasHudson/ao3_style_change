"Blaise took these?"
"And some of us intend on getting good marks for our N.E.W.Ts" Theo added. Harry flushed embarrassed. He kept his mouth shut for the remainder of the conversation
Ron thought to himself for a while. "I guess what I would do is try to get some dirt off the blackmailer and blackmail
Theo sighed lightly before he started talking. "Well, first I wanted to apologise for what I've done."
However, he just saw Malfoy leave the bathroom. It wasn't a picture, it was real time. He had stared at Malfoy naked for a small while.
Draco gulped quietly. "I think someone's in the room."
"He's my first and only friend. I can't just leave him, there's no one else i can go to."
"Wake up. Why aren't you waking up? You've been asleep for over 12 hours."
"A bit?"
"Open up, slut."
"It sounds a bit hysterical when you phrase it like that."
"Do you honestly?"
"You aren't the only one confused Ron." Hermione raised an eyebrow."
"You should be grateful im even doing this."
Although Draco wouldn't want to admit it, he was curious on what he wanted to say.
"I told you all the background information you need." Harry shook his head. "The rest of the information isn't anything you need to hear."
"Do as I say."
Blaise raised his eyebrows seemingly in alarm at the sudden question but soon his expression softened.
He cast a
Harry only needed to think to himself. He didn't want anyone trying to talk to him when they came back from lessons so he put up spells as a precaution even though the only roommates he had were Ron, Neville, Seamus and Dean.
"You okay?" He heard Blaise ask.
"Honestly, I don't understand why you don't wear skirts often. You look amazing in them."
"Young Draco. Your wand please." Headmaster Dumbledore requested, the twinkle in his eye long lost.
think that Blaise meant what he had said. It seems that Draco is showing himself to be more vulnerable that usual.
Draco shuffled miserably in Blaise's direction. He was in a sort of hypnotised state.
He had casted a small Notice-Me-Not charm on himself. It was partially efficient but wasn't long lasting. He was visibly invisible but his shadow still followed him making it obvious that he was still present.
Draco thought for a second. He thought back to the conversation he'd had a few minutes ago. It seemed sincere. Theo seemed guilty but Draco would never trust what he believed. Not anymore. He
"You don't want to be
"Hold on! Let me explain." Blaise raised his hands waving them. "I promise they won't be too bad. Maybe a few shower pics but overall I promise i won't go overboard."
Something was...
Draco turned back and saw no one. The door was open but no one had entered.

Harry felt his glasses balance on his forehead before they dropped onto the Slytherin green carpet. Blaise walked towards the so called glasses. Upon examination, he deemed them useless. He stomped onto the round spectacles quite violently. They shattered under his feet. Harry hoped that the glass shards would impale the underside of the other boy's heel. Unfortunately, they did not.
Harry was only a few inches taller than Draco but he needed to wind his head up to take in his features.
Draco hummed in acknowledgement this time. He glanced at his own nails for a small while leaving the room in silence.
Harry thought back to what he saw in Malfoy and Zabini's room. It was the first time he actually studied Malfoy.
because your father is Lucius Malfoy? No one could give a shit about that."
Draco took off the blindfold that covered his eyes and put on his robes. The game of truth or dare resulted in the same violating feeling like the last game. The only difference was the fact that Draco was sober. He couldn't say the same for Blaise however.
(See the end of the chapter for
"I had an order requested this morning from a 6th year Slytherin for 75 Galleons." Blaise explained. He threw the, very itchy, fabric in Draco's direction. It did NOT feel good on his skin. He wasn't gonna wear that. It would irritate his skin. "He really liked lingerie so you have to put this on."
Theodore...understands?
He walked over to his trunk and looked for something to wear. After a small moment, he picked out a black turtleneck and black jeans. He wanted to wear something comfortable but he wanted to impress Harry more. The attire he wore made him look casual but stylish.
"What are you doing?" He asked skeptical.
"Lucius!" Narcissa shouted at the other man.
Draco's eyes widened. He knew he shouldn't feel shocked with what Blaise said. He had said it many times. But it always sounded so
When Draco entered the dorms, he saw Blaise lying in his bed.
"You came early."
and now Harry can't show his face to Zabini otherwise he'll most likely get killed so now Malfoy is in some sort of toxic relationship that he isn't walking away from." The whole summery was told in a fast stumble of words. It was almost incoherent.
The old wandmaker had told him. He had remembered the magic surge through him for the first time. The first time he had felt in power. He had remembered the prideful grins that slipped onto his parent's lips. But now, the memory would be lost. His wand's execution only a few hallways away.
Draco nodded, his head bowed down in shame.
"Okay fine.
One Slytherin trait Blaise took with his family was that Zabini's were very good manipulators. A trait his mother passed on. It was difficult for Draco to say 'No' to him.
But instead cloudy grey.

Harry frowned for a small while before replying. "Well its good that you realised your mistake. That means that your aware of your flaw. You can fix the problem if you talk to him."
It was silent for a while. Draco rummaged around the room looking for his homework.
Adrian rolls his eyes. "Well I don't like her. I like
His eyes landed on Granger and Weasley. He had forgotten about the Golden Trio ever since Potter went missing. Speaking of Potter, he had wondered. If Nott was found, was there a possibility that Potter was found too? It seemed dumb but it was too big of a coincidence that they both went missing at the same time. Maybe...just maybe.
"Strip."
Blaise snapped his fingers. "Excacly. He isn't muscular or well built. He kinda looks like a girl."
Harry looked away.
"Did you find Nott?" Draco asked suddenly.
He wondered,
Draco's eyes narrowed. His mind screamed at him to do something. Anything. Something to make the other boy
. These pictures-"
He had walked to the location Harry had told him. Seventh floor, left corridor. He had Harry's note clutched in his left hand.
The blond boy laughed at his joke hoping to humiliate the other boy. He did not expect the almost suffocating grip on his arm. He was dragged away from the hallways. He screamed and thrashed, threatening to alert his father if he was not unhanded.
Thoughts?ðŸ¤”ðŸ‘€
Blaise left with the boy.
The name 'Potter' seemed to off set alarms to everyone's heads as they turned towards the direction of him.
His mother, and the three Professors turned to look at Draco's neck. They all gasped.
He thought back to all the times he's been attracted to someone. Well, he did find Parkinson attractive but he wouldn't go so far as to say he'd date her. He tried to name all the girls he knew but didn't find any of them his type. Then he thought of a few boys.
It seemed to of taken forever for her to understand the situation. Her head snapped up in a fluid motion as she bellowed, "
He looked at Blaise one last time before turning the photos. His heart dropped.
Harry's hands travelled down the other's waist towards his legs. Draco lifted his legs up to the others hands. He felt himself being picked up and pressed against the door. He wrapped his legs around the taller boy's waist.
"Thats me." Nott placed both hands on his hips looking up smugly.
"What would you do if you knew someone getting blackmailed."
Comments make me happy, especially with school so closeby.
Blaise isn't stupid. He knows
"Oh don't look at me like that, it's just a few harmless photos." Blaise smirked. "You should feel honoured, these photos sell for amazing prices to miserable lads who don't have any lovers to relieve their sex drives."
"How are you and Blaise?"
The mood soured when Draco walked in. The room was filled with mixed feelings. Feelings Draco didn't want to identify.
"Dare."
"You're not my friend and you know it."
Blaise turned away from Draco no longer giving him his attention. Draco didn't find this amusing.
"I don't find it a good idea to skip breakfast."
"Lie on the bed and wear these."
"What lesson do you have first?" Harry asked.
Draco felt his face glow a bright pink. He pinched the bridge of his nose and groaned. "I do not, nor will I ever, have an interest in Parkinson. I am only speaking to her. We are just on good enough terms to talk pleasantly to eachother. Nothing else."
"Do we have a deal?" Harry held out his hand waiting for a handshake but it never came.
He rested his head in his hands for a small while. He only lifted his head when he heared the abrupt sound of the shower shutting off. He groaned when he realised that he had walked in on someone taking a shower.
The only person who knew about his situation was Potter and he had went missing along with Nott. Not many people had noticed their disappearance but if they did notice it, they never talked about it.
"Bullshit!" Draco pointed an accusing finger in Blaise's face. "Do you think I'm stupid?."
Blaise shrugged and smiled. "Let's go." He sat up signaling the blond to follow. When Draco made no sign of getting up, Blaise scowled. "Aren't you coming?"
"Why do you even think I like guys?" Draco rolled his eyes.
"I'm not asking you."
"No, you know what Blaise. Fuck you. You are a shit friend and I don't know why I trusted you. You can go ahead and tell my parents. I don't care. Send them to Skeeter. Look, let me give you a headline idea.
"I wish you could see how slutty you look right now."
The taller Slytherin's eyes darkened. "I told you, we're leaving."
It wasn't like he was worried or concerned about him. He was just confused. No he wasn't upset. It was relieving. Nott wasn't around to bother him which was a relief since he still had to deal with Blaise. Blaise's controlling personality was toxic but Draco couldn't grow the balls to leave or ask for help. It would of been hard to deal with Nott as well as his obvious situation.
Blaise and Draco made their way to Charms. Blaise needed to find a way to get Draco chained to a bed without him noticing. Draco was a light sleeper so be couldn't do it while he was asleep. He had to get Draco to willingly do the bidding without actually knowing what he was doing.
"Yes?" The blond encouraged.
Nott shook his head. "And I answered your question, Potter. I don't know why Blaise started his '
What?
After what felt like hours, he could feel Harry's cock twitch on his mouth. Harry pulled him off. Draco gasped for air. He fell back. His face was read and tear tracks trailed his cheeks.
Ron went back to ignoring the lesson.
Draco trusted Blaise with his life. He rarely argued with Blaise and they had the same interests.
"See? That wasn't so bad."
Harry didn't expect Draco to feel pleasure in pain. A smile on his face appeared. An evil grin.
As if Harry had heard his wishes, the knife was once again on his skin, this time it was dragged slowly down his left arm.
Draco opened his mouth getting on his knees. Harry jerked himself off for a few seconds before he felt his release. Harry came on him. He didn't aim for his mouth, instead he got it everywhere except his mouth.
"Truth or Dare?"
Draco's hand grasped his chest. His heart beated wildly. He had felt so afraid through the whole rant.
"Mr and Mrs Malfoy, please calm down." McGonagall tried to keep the two parents from arguing. She turned her attention back to Draco. "Now Draco. Who do you mean by
Draco suspected that Potter had told his friends but they didn't take much action. Come to think of it, they haven't even
Draco panicked for a second. He didn't knowÂ  if he could cast a strong enough charm to hide Harry and himself.
"Why did you need to take out 350 Galleons, mate?" Ron had asked him when they walked towards the school again. Harry had simply said that 'he didn't want to keep taking frequent trips to Gringotts.' Ron seemed to buy the lie but Hermione seemed suspicious of the situation.
"No, I was sorta seeing him gaze at Zabini. I think its him." Hermione justified. "And stop pointing, its rude!"
Draco thought to himself,
"I don't know how you managed it but I'm even more upset than before." Draco looked away from the other boy, the dark room hiding the embarrassed flush on his face.
Draco's breath calmed down. He hadn't even realised that he had been panting slightly. He looked back at Blaise and the dark skinned boy looked
Harry hummed. "It's not noticeable but its there."
Draco didn't reply.
There was a voice that had come from her floo.
Through the Malfoy generation, None of his ancestors went through the trouble of being expelled from Hogwarts. The situation was below them. Draco could feel the glares of the family before himself bore into him. He brought his arms to cover himself. Their stares itched his skin like sandpaper.
"What do you mean by
"Where were you?" Draco asked
"There's homework I need to turn in. I don't want to have detention cleaning the Owlry." Draco spoke rationally.
Oh, so Potter probably didn't know.
Draco stared at him.
Malfoy rolled his eyes probably for the 3rd time. He mumbled something along the lines of
In short, the 30 minute nap didn't refresh him.
eat anything at all but that was when he wasn't too hungry. Draco stared at the Slytherin table filled with food. Mash potatos, Veggies, Turkey and meatballs. However all he had on his plate was an apple and some pumpkin juice.
Blaise mirrored his expression, his face contorted into a disgusted impression, "I'm implying that the Slytherin Prince may of gotten himself seduced and went off and slept around."
"...huh?" Ron cocked his head to the side.
"Cissa are you seriously acting sweet towards him? Don't. You'll influence his behavior." Lucius reprimanded his wife sternly. Narcissa stood her ground.
The room was tense. It was a pretty awkward situation. You wouldn't really want to properly meet someone by being kidnapped by them then having them sulk miserably infront of you with your limbs tied down. It wasn't excacly an everyday occurance either.
"You're blushing."
in Draco's direction. It was like they were never told.
His arm was slowly turning blue from the lack of circulation in his arm. He became desperate. Dare I say, he
Draco's mood had been positive all morning. He was happier and more peaceful than he had ever been. Students around him had even noticed his unusual bright mood. As a result, younger school-mates weren't as frightened as him as usual.
"More specifically, Blaise dropped my books."
Harry sat on the soft couch. He had his head in his hands. He felt destroyed.
"Name and age?" Rita had flicked her wand. Her signature quill flew towards the parchment, ready to jot down notes.
Draco was convinced that this situation began because of his rambling. Or his cowardice. He had insulted, not only Blaise, but his family aswell and as a result, the soon-to-be-former student slowly walked, closer with each step, away from the castle he had always referred to as home.
With one last glare from Harry's side. He stormed out rather uncomfortable and sweaty.
Blaise leaned in so he was close to Draco's face. His eyes went dark and his voice dropped. "
"Oh, we do. We have a homework assignment we need to do."
Zabini looked lost in thought. A few seconds passed by before he smirked.
Draco's eyes widened at the sudden question. "Why..?"
Draco sat up immediately at the instruction.
"With my life. And why are you suddenly asking these questions?"
He felt his father stand up from his chair rather angrily. He marched over to his wife's seat and placed a loving hand on her shoulder. His face did not match his sweet caress. He looked down at his son, his face disgruntled.
the damn pictures. He's a fucking perv." Draco eyes pierced right through Theodore's soul. "
Tears glazed Draco's eyes when he felt his legs follow Blaise. He was stuck.
When Draco finished showering, he left to the dorms to find his friend, but Blaise was no where to be seen.
Blaise sat up looking intently at Draco. Studying him. His stare made Draco feel small however Draco stood up, his stare mirroring Blaise.
It was even worse in the Great Hall. When he entered the room, all the students stopped speaking. They stopped to side eye him or look back at the papers. Draco believed it was the Daily Prophet.
"He was was selling pictures to other students...of you."
"Have you seen Theo at all today?" Parkinson asked him.
"Look at my body. Now look at yours. Do you see a difference."
Stunned silence.
"Is it a deal or not?"
"And that is?"
bad per say. Blaise had made him wear worst stuff before.
"Yes. They would be disappointed and so very very sad."
Draco, the other boy, took this as victory and got cocky. "What's wrong, Potter? Don't have anything else to say?"
"I'm not dependent on anyone."
After lessons, Draco made his way to the common rooms. He had Pansy by his side who had insisted that they walked back together. She said she wanted to learn more about Draco and Draco knew this was a propose to become friends. Draco didn't refuse her offer.
Blaise stayed quiet for a little while. He stared at Draco. At first, Draco thought there was something on his face.
"..."
His eyes were dull
Rita waited a few seconds before speaking. "Would you prefer to remain anonymous?"
"Slept well?" Blaise asked giving a warm smile.
"Leave me alone." Draco walked faster to try and send a message telling Nott he didn't want to walk with him but Nott only seemed to view this as a challenge. Soon, he matched Draco's pace.
He was lying. He knew he was. There was no way he was the Slytherin Prince just because...it can't. Can it?
"I think I have charms." Draco stood up. "I'll talk to you later, I have to collect my homework from my dorm."
Harry was disgusted by what he was going to request, but if he wanted Draco to believe him, he had to try and get Zabini to give him a picture of Draco in a degrading position.
"Do you trust Zabini?"
" Harry started to pace the room. Collecting his thoughts.
Blaise ignored his question.
"Just for fun, now get dressed and sober up, we have potions."
Blaise took a shot of firewhiskey. He had suggested to
without you."
"You're really cheerful this morning. Have you been told that you were glowing?"
The clothes Blaise looked humiliating. Malfoy's were meant to wear robes decorated in expensive fabrics, not clothes you would see a common street whore wear. Draco reluctantly put on the clothes.
(See the end of the chapter for
It was silent for a small moment. Adrian had probably felt a bit awkward by Pansy's constant giggling or flirting.
"Put this blindfold on."
Draco checked the time again. 7:30 am. He had plenty of time before he met up with Potter.
"Like what you see?"
ugh its September, yknow what that means? yup... school from the UK... yay. can't wait...
"Tell me the real reason why you're here."
"What are you
"I trust Young Draco can make his way. Let him walk the halls one last time..."
"Let me."
"Who's...
Despite Draco's eyes being covered, he could see flashes of white from the gaps of the blindfold.
"Mother? W-what's wrong?" Draco turned to aid his mother for any possible injuries.
"I got answers regardless."
I'm fourteen and I'm a bit more smarter than you think!"
"Who knew the Chosen one was such a kinky bastard." Zabini sneered.
Oh right, the potion.
Draco, very dramatically, rolled his eyes but didn't protest against Potter's actions.
"I'm asking you because I know you can provide what I need."
Draco groaned suddenly remembering. "If you think my situation is a joke, then just tell me..."
Harry walked to Gringotts that day with Ron and Hermione
"I'm quite happy with you're mood. Your usual mood often upsets me. You should smile more often."
"Kidnapped him." Draco snorted. His tone in obvious humor.
"Please partner up for this next task." Snape requested. The class moved around sitting next to friends. Draco, of course, partnered up with Blaise.
Before he could comprehend it, dinner was over. All the leftover dishes and cutlery vanished from the table and it was as good as new. Students started to leave the lively hall one table at a time. Draco however was not excited to go back to his dorms however. It felt too soon.
There we go
"Still... Thank you." Draco looked away at the smiling boy. He still didn't like Nott but he was at least grateful that he had came just in time.
Harry stepped even closer. Draco could practically feel the Gryffindor breathing into his hair. "I did this for you, Draco."
"Right now? I wanted to go to the Quiddich pitch with you. We could watch the Sixth Year boys in practice." Pansy wiggled her eyebrows.
"Have you ever done this before?"
She groaned loudly. "I asked you a question and you're not answering."
Malfoy's face held a sense of curiosity. He had never seen Potter so hesitant to do something before. Almost regretting.
"I wonder what else we can have you wear." Blaise smirked at the blond boy. "Maybe we should get a mini skirt. Wouldn't you agree?"
Blaise is one of my favourite characters but in this fanfic he needs to be the bad guy because of his close relationship with Draco.
"Yeah I agree. Mini skirts are pretty overused." Blaise started to pace the room thoughtfully. "Maybe silk lingerie. They are pretty expensive but we'd make the money back easily."
The two boys parted ways.
of sleep?
Draco sat infront of the Headmaster, his head bowed down in shame.
"Didn't you hear the boy? He said no."
"I was looking at both of them." Harry summarised.
"I know right."
Draco nodded. He had to meet up with Harry in less than 10 hours. His face softened and he smiled.
"What was that about?" He turned to his right where Pansy sat.
"No." The answer was short but it wasn't sweet. Quite the opposite actually.
The shock on the professors' faces was not unexpected. They were shocked at Draco's sudden outburst. He spoke once again. "Please stop. Can we just skip the stalling and get this over and done with?"
"No, I'm just suprised at myself honestly. I really thought someone like Parkinson would of found you interesting. Interesting enough to
Sorry if this chapter doesn't make sense. I'm still trying to get my life together.
"Hello? I swear if I find out that there are students in there, I will drag you off to Dumbledore's office and give you a weeks worth of detention."
Draco nodded.
"Will you stop for one damn second?" Draco cried out in a raw outburst. He couldn't help it. All three professors had all made pathetic attempts to improve Draco's mood with hallow praises that only succeeded in bittering the other boy even more. He just wanted to get it over with and done. The sooner he left, the better.
Draco knew this was another one of Blaise's awful mind games. But somewhere in the back of Draco's mind...he was worried that what Blaise was saying was true.
"Uh... The same reason."
Blaise must of been really pissed at him. The boy didn't even return back to the dorms.
Has Draco ever mentioned how much he hated that nickname? It made him cringe and frown. It was soon discovered that the voice had belonged go a female Slytherin in his year named Pansy Parkinson. He didn't speak to her much but he knew her name because she was his partner in herbology in his second year. He didn't like her but he didn't hate her. He tolerated her at most.
"Oh my Godric." Harry whispered to himself
Harry walked to the Great Hall with his 2 friends, Ron and Hermione. Well, it was more like he was third-wheeling. Hermione and Ron were painfully in love with eachother so they talked to eachother more than anyone else which ended up in Harry tagging along to indirect dates.
"Mr and Mrs Malfoy, thank you for coming," Dumbledore greeted warmly. "Please take a seat on either side of your son."
Draco had known who the hickey was from. Harry. It was his little
The smaller boy said nothing. He only looked up at the ceiling.
Blaise looked stumped. He had noticed the blond's courage. He envied it.
"I think Blaise is waiting for you."
"Meet back here again? Same time?"
Draco reached for his drawers and pulled out a towel, soap and shampoo. He didn't want to use the soap offered to students. It didn't make his hair soft enough.
Blaise is having fun, then suddenly, he's not. Pansy, you couldn't of been any louder! Go away Nott, your jokes aren't funny... Just get this over with... Wait...what?
Draco hummed. Shivers went through Harry's spine. He grabbed the blonds hair into a vicious grip. He shoved his length down Draco's throat and forced it still. Draco gagged violently on Harry but was forced still. Tears streamed down his face. He grabbed Harry's thighs and tried to pull himself off.
"Well I knew that he knew about Zabini's doings. I just thought that I could question him in a quiet environment."
The cat meowed whinily as it roamed out of the room. Soon, Filch did the same.
"My mother is
Draco instinctively put it on. It was a white robe that he used to cover himself up.
Dw this won't disrupt anything. Maybe a few detentions is all but nothing will delay the story.
No words were exchanged. The two just enjoyed eachother's company until they fell asleep in eachother's embrace.
"Stop!"
"I'm ready, let's go,"
"Me and Malfoy have a project to work on and I was arranging a meeting."
Draco stood still and watched the other boy intently. Harry mumbled words as if he were trying to calm himself down but at the same time, trying to reassure Draco.
Blaise didn't use any unforgivables on Draco however his manipulation felt like an imperio curse. Everytime Draco had come close to reporting Blaise, Zabini would always talk him out of it.
"Alright. Now we all know what was in The Prophet... in any normal circumstance, we would have no choice but to
Rapid breathing. Draco's rapid breathing, to be excact, was the only sound in the room.
"What... Are you..." Draco brought the wand closer to his face. "Are you
"Yes, oh god yes!" Draco couldn't recognise his own voice. His breathy voice sounded needy. His body's reaction to the thought of having Harry's name permanently on his chest sent a shock of heat through his face.
"It doesn't matter if he's sorry or not, we
He blushed. The memory of the classroom had come to him once again, His sour mood long forgotten.
No one said anything however. Draco didn't know if it was because they wanted to stay quiet to hear him if he said anything or if it was the intimidating Slytherin who stood next to him. Draco believed it was the latter.
But what if Potter wanted to say something that Draco would want to know?
"Okay truth or dare?"
"Maybe he's looking at them because of Malfoy. I mean, look at him. He looks ill." Ron argued
"Are you gonna answer any of them?" She narrowed her eyes even more.
"Mother, what's wrong? Did I..."
Something was off. Draco could feel it. Something wasn't right.
"I'm the backstabber? I will never understand you, Blaise"
"You want me to write my name on your chest, don't you?"
Draco didn't move. He remained defiant..
to feel the other's lips pressed against his very own? Did he perhaps...
Draco couldn't think for himself. Soon he was degrading himself. "I'm fragile."
"I even went to the library myself. No trace of him at all. Odd isn't it? I asked around. No ones seen him. His last known location was in the hallway." Parkinson lips formed into a straight line. He could tell she was somewhat concerned for his whereabouts. Draco couldn't help but feel...odd. It was as if he had something to do with the disappearance.
he was.
His life was
"Take off your shirt and trousers."
Draco nodded and looked down. He walked a little faster only stopping once he was infront of Blaise.
"Common rooms? What happened there. Did someone hurt you?"
Harry had finally released the words that were caught in his throat. They came out in an urgent heap on nonsense. "M-Malfoy, i-i... I didn't know you were in... I didn't mean to barge in, I just thought that... this... this isn't what it looks like!"
charm and checked the time. 6am. It was time to get ready.
Potter wasn't even at the Gryffindor table. He was usually in the middle all the other lions with his muggleborn and bloodtraitor friend but when Draco looked up to find him, he wasn't anywhere to he seen.
"What will mummy and daddy say when they find out their son is no better than a masochist whore?"
"It's actually time for breakfast. Get changed."
Looks like Blaise finally showed his true colours
"Oh Headmaster, you must forgive him. he's a child. He'll make foolish mistakes but... isn't that just a part of growing up?"
He wasn't even tired in potions so how did he even manage to get even an
Harry stepped even closer to the Slytherin, this time in sudden interest. "I also wanted to apoligise about the incident with Nott."
"No."
"No no, we're just really good friends."
Draco thought. Harry had paid alot of money just for Draco to see what Blaise was doing. He had a new found respect for him.
"I think that's enough, Potter."
The wand wasn't speaking. Nott was. Draco frowned heavily. He had made a fool of himself thinking that his wand was actually communicating with him.
cold voice snapped Draco out of his thoughts.
"Draco."
"Leave me alone, Blaise."
"And you don't have to." Blaise grinned smugly. "A little birdie told me that a certain
"Not yet." He laughed. He pulled the covers off the blond boy. "Get ready for breakfast. We'll attend classes and fulfill orders before dinner."
"I was going to get my Charms homework from my room."
Draco sat on his bed. He had been wondering on what Potter wanted to talk to him about. He didn't know why he agreed to meet him. Especially during breakfast.
Blaise Zabini...
Theo felt his face heat up rapidly and felt the hem of his pants tighten...
"Are you implying that..."

without you."
They looked into each other's eyes finding peace in the other's comfort.
He leaned against the door frame for around 3 minutes before he started to get bored. He wished he had stayed at the dorm rooms a little longer. Wait what? What was he thinking? Of course he'd rather not be in the dormrooms. Potter prefers to treat his situation like a joke instead of finding people that can
Draco sat in Divination. His head rested in his hands while he listened to the teacher ramble on about crazy theories of the future. He looked around the class.
"One more hug before you go?" Harry grinned. Draco rolled his eyes but didn't protest.
"Sure I am. It's me. Your wand!" The voice came again. Draco almost choked a laugh but he was too shocked.
"Blaise will recieve my forgiveness once he burns in the deepest pits of
Malfoy looked at Nott in utter disbelief as if he couldn't believe what he was hearing. "You didn't tell me about BlaiseÂ invading my privacy because you trusted him to make the

"Calm down, Harry. There's no reason to get mad. Its just...This is Malfoy we're talking about.
"What if you get caught?"
"If you say so."
"Hey. Draco." The boy greeted him.
"I guess this is goodbye." Draco whispered. He hadn't expected an answer from the piece of wood. It had no tongue to speak with nor no face to express emotion.
Draco looked up at Professor McGonagall. He nodded.
"I want to play truth or dare."
"Dare."

"Hey Draco, how long has it been since we've last seen each other... A day?"
Theo muttered. "Can...c-can I keep this?"
Harry Potter."
Harry waited patiently in the classroom. He had tried to limit himself to staring at the lewd picture in his hand.
Draco said nothing more. He looked down.
"Now remember. What did I tell you?"
the boy reassured.
"Huh? Muggle television shows are so odd..."
"Parkinson informed me that you requested me here for a
"Ms Skeeter, we have a young man here to see you. He claims to have something you may need."
Theo sat up, "I let him in."
"Oh yeah, I do." Blaise got up, "Hey Draco do you mind if I partner up with someone else this lesson?"
Draco rolled his eyes. "You know what I mean."
He had sold pictures to 1st year Ravenclaws, and 6th year Slytherins.
It was as if Harry had a sixth sense that helped him detect whenever Draco was sad. When Draco's smile dropped, a snow, white owl had dropped a small note on his empty plate.
the game up with alcohol.
"Why don't you go ahead and take a shower. No I'm not gonna take any photos. There really is no need." Blaise waved his hands up smirking defensively. He desperately ushered Draco away and only put his arms down when he heared the door to the bathroom open then close.
"And we are awfully crestfallen to see you go..."
Vincent Crabbe, Hah! He'd die before having to date him.
He showered under cold water not bothering to heat the water. He shivered uncontrollably due to the freezing liquid caressing his skin.
Draco nodded and went to unbutton his jeans. He slowed his movements and blushed at the fact that the has removing an item of clothing.
Theodore Nott.
"Do you have muck in your ears? I said no."
"Then why aren't you leaving?"
It took his a small minute but Draco finally nodded.
"I know it is! You don't understand."
Draco hasn't realised that there was someone standing right beside him. He jumped.
"It's Draco."
Instead of sticking around, he pushed past the girl infront of him and ran up to his dorms, The loud common room drowned out the sound of footsteps following him up the stairs.
"My life is none of your
When Zabini started to pack up to leave the empty classroom, he stopped him.
Harry sat at the Gryffindor table glaring circles into the back of Zabini's neck. He hadn't forgotten about what he did and he intended to find out why he did it.
"Harry I'm pretty sure you'll need our help." Hermione called after him. "We just need a little background information."
The floo roared menacingly and Draco's mouth shut closed. He knew who walked through the floo and he didn't want to look them in the face.
"I'm just talking to you. What, am I not allowed to talk to my best friend anymore?" Blaise lifted a brow in mock confusion.
Draco, of course, knew of the Parkinson's. They were also a popular pureblood family. Not as popular as the Malfoy's, Black's or Zabini's but they were common knowledge to most, if not, all purebloods.
Blaise looked at Draco intently, somewhat invested in what the blond had to say. He then gave a toothy grin. "You're right. How silly of me."
"If I say yes, Will you leave me alone?"
Theo would never know where his confidence came from but he had leaned back and whispered, "I was planning on doing
Pansy looked at Theo at the exact moment he looked at her. They smirked and Pansy answered. "It's fairly obvious." Theo nodded in agreement.
"I'm heading to the dorms and decided to walk with you." Nott smirked wider. Draco rolled his eyes.
Draco bit his lip, preventing a violent, and extremely offensive, insult from jumping off his tongue. Instead, the boy scoffed and walked, a little faster, towards the dorms.
Draco started to regret bringing all his books. He was struggling to hold all his books.
Draco lay back on his bed trying to force himself out of consciousness but his body refused to relax.
He tired to recall the events of what happened after potions, but he couldn't remember what. It was like his memories were erased because after he sat in his room, his mind abruptly stopped remembering what happened.
Did Zabini just take a picture of Draco on his knees? Surely there has got to be some sort of explanation.
Draco mistook this reaction as a chance to run off but the sudden grip on his arm wouldn't let him move.
Draco finally stands up for himself after a long while. He didn't want to take advice from the boy anymore. Skeeter recieves news of a lifetime.
The only time he was let go was when he was launched onto his stomach in an empty classroom. No classes were to preform that day. It was a Saturday. People were either asleep in their dorms or outside in Hogsmeade.
Draco roamed the dark halls. He had no specific destination nor did he have the will to turn back.
"No I'm not." He settled for a plain response.
Draco felt himself nodding softly at the other's request.
"Theo, I was just kidding..."
"It was back in third year."
Harry rushed through the halls ignoring anyone who might of tried to catch his attention. His face was bright red and his hand clasped over his mouth.
He gave a haste nod but his mood deteriorated. He couldn't stop thinking about Zabini. The name made him
"Look at you, thriving under me. My name permanently scarred into your skin."
Draco had now desperately wished that he had checked himself in the mirror before leaving the dorms. How many people had seen his neck and assumed the worst? His parents sure did.
"No no no, Ron. They will be punished severely."
Draco blinked clearing his throat. "Haha, okay. I think you should head back to your dorm. Its getting kind of late." Draco rushed to close the blinds feeling awkward.
"So... I assume you've read The Prophet this morning." The Headmaster started.
No one knows what came over Harry. The boy suddenly stopped all movement. Words abruptly coming to a sudden stop. He had a crazed look in his eyes.
"Ah, ah... sorry, it's really tender there." Draco frowned at Harry's reaction to pull away completely.
"Harry..." The Slytherin answered.
"Potter?"
"Maybe
did you get into the Slytherin dorms?"
"What's being done is being done. I don't want an investigation. The faster this is over with, the better. I'm not welcome in this school anymore anyway."
But Potter loved Draco. Potter may not know it yet but Theo understood at that very moment that he didn't feel the same way as what Potter was feeling towards Draco.
Draco felt his face heat up even more. Did Potter just call him beautiful? Surely this had to be a dream. A dream that he strangely didn't want to wake up from.
"I was waiting out here. I didn't want to be inside that classroom for any longer."
"Aren't you coming?"
Draco couldn't help but feel ashamed all of a sudden. People looked at him as if they knew all of his secrets... Did... Did Blaise have anything to do with this?
The door suddenly opened and Draco came in with a Honeydukes treat bag.
Blaise would go so far for money. Even if it meant taking pictures of his best friend secretly and selling them to different people in the school. He didn't care how old they were or which house they were in, all that mattered was how much money they'd offer.
"You're
"Find anything Ms Norris?" Filch's raspy voice asked the cat.
a reputation to uphold."
"Who I spend my time with isn't any of your concern." Draco snarled at the taller male.
Draco had red, puffy eyes. There were heavy bags under his eyelids and his lips were dry. Draco looked tense. His shoulders were kept still and shook slightly. He looked small. Not physically, but there was something about Draco's posture that suggested he didn't want to be noticed.
"I'll...I'll leave you two alone..." Pansy smiled once more at the older boy then left.
Draco sat on the bed. He had his wand in his hand and grasped it tight. He felt the almost sentient feeling of upset magic flow through his blood. He had remembered the first time he had gotten his wand.
He closed the door behind him and took many deep breaths. His face was hot and sweaty and it wasn't only from the steam in the bathroom. The surprise had effected Harry in ways he never knew he felt towards the Malfoy heir. He hadn't noticed that Zabini sat smugly on a small velvet green beanbag chair placed in the corner of the room.
Draco could feel Harry's clothed cock rub against him.
"Listen, you have got it all wrong. The paper wasn't telling the truth."
"You told them?" Draco felt his breath shallow each second he sat in the room.
Harry stared at the picture before him, stunned. He was disgusted.
He put on some shorts under the hoodie. It wasn't as if he needed them. The hoodie covered everything.
She nodded in acknowledgement. "The last time i saw him was this morning. I walked with him to breakfast and he told me he was going to go to the library to study for a charms lesson. I haven't seen him since."
"I really hope you're kidding." Draco sat up from his laying position and glared at Blaise with such hatred.
The taller boy led Draco to the dorms. When they were alone, Blaise went to lie on his bed. Draco stood in the middle of the room motionless
"You good, mate?" His friend Ron, who sat next to him, asked when he heard Harry's silent complaint. "You don't seem like your usual self lately. Is something bothering you?"
He tangled his fingers with Harry's messy curls. The grip on Draco's hips tightened as he was pulled closer towards the other's body.
"Well since you're inviting random students, i decided to stay back. I don't want any one else walking in on me in the shower." Draco's voice was bitter and cold.
..." Harry mumbled into his neck.
"I needed access to the picture so I could show you."
"Meet me in the spare transfiguration classroom during breakfast."
The voice laughed loudly. "Look to your left."
"Me neither. Zabini is your best friend. He should have morals."
"What kind of person? What are you... Stop talking in riddles and tell me why everyone is acting so weird." Draco growled, more pissed than before.
"I'm just curious is all."
'It'll only appear when you need it.'? What did that mean?
Was the drarry rushed-? Idk if it was and now I'm worried ðŸ˜€
He felt a sharp object poke his arm. His first initial reaction was to scream in agony. However the pain sent shocks down his spine. A shock of pain and
Are you really expecting me to place my trust on someone who openly knew about my situation back on third year? He
He looked up to see Zabini smirking down at the 300 Galleons Harry gave him.
Draco shook his head. "It's nothing."
Nothing seem out of the ordinary, but Draco couldn't place his finger where.
He had came back to the dorms at 4AM. Even then, he wasn't able to fall asleep immediately.Â  His heart beated furiously when he thought back to his first kiss back in the moonlit classroom. He had felt his lips prickle since then. He wasn't able to sleep until an hour passed and his body started to shut down.
Draco looked away, his smile faltering ever so slightly. "I guess you could say that."
Draco paled in world record time. He lifted his hand to cover the tender flesh of his collarbone. It was a hickey. The reason his mother cried, the reason his father spat, the reason he had no time to explain himself was because of a
Duh. Draco had done this plenty of times but none of the Slytherins he slept with were
The two boys were alone in Blaise's dorm room. It was the room he shared with their friend, Draco. Draco was out in Hogsmeade with a few other Slytherins. Blaise had told him he wasn't able to come but he didn't specify his reason. Theo had said he'd rather stay in so the room was to themselves.
Harry had never seen Draco act so submissive towards anyone. If anything, Draco wasn't meant to act like he is now. It was disturbing. Seeing Malfoy flinch at random inconveniences and look down at his food avoiding confrontations and socialising.
Draco scoffed. "I was
Draco left the bathroom once he had brushed his teeth and styled his hair. He hadn't used gel. He had decided to go without. As a result, his hair was left soft and bouncy.
"No Draco. It can't be true. But the evidence... Oh Draco!"
for the person he would marry in the future. When he presents himself, he wanted the person he married to be the first person to see The Draco Malfoy. Not some man who had a body count of over 50. It was safe to say that Draco had never so much as
"Why not? Worried I'll ruin your flawless reputation?"
that Blaise was a great friend. Look where that got him.
While Pansy spoke, Draco felt eyes on him. He felt a few stares poking the back of his head. He turned his neck and caught the eyes of 3 Sixth Year boys who only grinned back at him.
worth of news."
Draco looked up from the small note towards the sound of the voice. Once he saw who had asked him the question, he rolled his eyes.
Morning arrived quicker than Draco had expected yet he still didn't get out of bed. How could he? There was nothing to look forward to.
Draco turned his head. He looked at the boy infront of him. "I guess I owe you my gratitude Nott."
Blaise shrugged. "I don't know. I heard it around when I visited Muggle London last week. Apparently its some villan from a television series about a talking sponge and a bunch of sea creatures."
Because Harry didn't know the real reason. He blindly threw on his cloak and let his feet take him to where they wanted to go. Coincidentally, it was Draco's dorm.
Harry shook his head. "I have an invisibility cloak."
"Malfoy?"
Harry stared at the wall hoping to see a familiar blond walk through it. Draco had left before Harry could react and Harry had never seen him since breakfast. It was the last lesson of the day. Slytherins and Gryffindors had classes together but nor Zabini or Draco had joined. They were usually punctual but now that 15 minutes of lesson has passed by, Harry doubt that they were attending lessons today.
"Nott?" Draco had answered the boy now walking beside him.
Draco only stared.
"So?"
Blaise said nothing, he just stared. It made Draco feel awfully tiny. Made him feel trapped under the taller boy's gaze. This wasn't friendship. Draco didn't know what this was. All he knew was that this was toxic and he hated every second with the other boy.
Draco kept quiet and pouted his lip angrily. "What do I do then. If he takes one more picture, he might as well sell my body."
Oooo 2 chapters in the span of an hour? I consider this a win
Blaise freed Draco from the chains.
Harry took a deep sigh. He needed to tell his friends if he needed help. "Promise you won't freak out?"
Before they left the common room, the taller boy quietly told Draco. "Oh, hopefully you don't
Blaise sighed. "Whatever. We need to head back to the common room. I've got a huge amount of requests we need to do."
"Draco..." The Gryffindor whispered.
Draco felt his father's finger jab at his neck. Draco flinched harshly. The skin felt sensitive and tender. Was it bruised?
For the third time, he felt the knife stab him on his shoulder. To this, he wasn't able to suppress a needy moan.
"..."
Draco stormed off the bed not noticing Blaise's...smirk? He was almost out of the door before he heard...
Just like he asked, he had recieved the picture of a naked Draco on his knees with his arms behind his back.
Draco turned at the sound of his name. He looked into the Gryffindor's eyes. They were full of concentration.
Harry came to realise that Malfoy was clueless in the concepts of seduction and sex which isn't too suprising. Purebloods believe in purity when they present themselves for the first time for a partner. So the picture probably wasn't taken with consent or understanding.
to securing the bag." Pansy grind her teeth in frustration.
Harry, despite Draco's protests, did not hurry up. He kept Draco in his arms and nibble at his neck.
He looked to his mother who had a hand clasped over her mouth. Tears glazed her eyes.
Harry didn't have enough reaction time when Hermione hit him over the head with a thick book. He had almost lost his balance and fell.
without you."
Draco pulled away disgusted. "I can't say the same about you."
Draco looked as if he could kill. Scratch that. He looked as if he
Draco once again sat in the Great Hall next the the man he wished death upon. He couldn't even pick what food he could eat. Blaise insisted that he picked for he knows what's best for the blond boy. Despite everything, Blaise was still Draco's first and only best friend so he knew what food Draco loved.
Draco's face scrunched up in confusion. "You kidnapped him?"
Pansy whispered in Draco's ear. "He knows your name!"
"You're a bastard." Harry resorted into shouting sense at the darker man but the other displayed no emotion of realisation.
Draco brought his hands to cup either side of Harry's face.
"I think we have the right to know if our son is whoring himself around as well as selling nudes."
Blaise smiled warmly. "Are you tired? You should get some sleep."
"You're really pretty for a Malfoy."
Blaise and Draco are the centre of gossip, Pucey is trying to secure the bag, Pansy's clueless, Theo helps, Draco's grateful.
Harry laughed lightly. He wrapped his arms around Draco's waist and rested his head in Draco's hair, hugging him. Draco wrapped his arms around the other's neck enjoying the familiar yet unique scent. The scent of grass and peach.
"Huh? I didn't catch that."
"You like it when I stab you, don't you?"
Harry thought of Draco with a soft smile on his face. He couldn't even feel himself drift to a peaceful sleep where he dreamed about the pale skinned blond and himself lying infront of the setting sun on the beach.
"Where in the bloody hell have you two been?" Draco hissed loudly, anger seeping through his voice.
"We can be friends."
"Mate, are you okay?" His buddy Ron asked him. Harry looked away from the blond boy and back to his friend.
"Truth or dare?"
The woman sighed. She had given up. She may as well listen to what the man had to say.
Draco opened his eyes, confused. He was on his bed with a t-shirt and boxers.
"Your loss. Do tell me when you change your mind."
Draco looked the same as everyday. He wasÂ neatly dressed. But he didn't
yay Draco! finally stood up to that rancid boy. It was the right thing to do! right.?
He continued to pick his books up. When done, he resumed his trip to the Great Hall for breakfast.
"Get to the point, I'm getting bored already."
Pucey had swiftly wrapped his arms around Draco's hips. His grip so fierce, Draco was worried he'd bruise his sensitive skin.
"Just what?" Draco ushered impatiently.
Draco looked at the other boy, distaste painted his features. Despite this, he nodded somewhat understanding.
I'm back but I can't promise that I won't be slacking
"Alright guess not."
(See the end of the chapter for
expect any of those moments to involve walking in on a naked, and most might say attractive, Draco Lucius Malfoy.
He did.
Blaise fell painfully onto the floor motionless.
Harry lay on his back. He couldn't deny what he had saw. Malfoy was drop dead
Draco looked away. He didn't want to bring up the incident in the common rooms with Harry. "Just something that happened in the common rooms. Just drop it."
When he looked back at the Slytherin table he saw Zabini walking out of the Hall with another Slytherin student leaving Malfoy alone.
The moment was cut by a harsh knock on the door. Draco jumped from his position and backed away from the door. Harry did the same.
"Oh Draco. Why didn't you think before you acted? I took you to be... to be more responsible!" His mother sobbed into her hand.
"I'm just tired, Ron."
When the knife departed, he couldn't help but feel a sense of loss. His sadness quickly evaporated when Harry wrapped his fingers around Draco's thighs and thrust forward. The sudden friction made Draco release a high pitched moan.
"Do I really?" she gave him a mock smile and sat down with a heavy thud. She crossed her legs and scooped as many food items onto her plate. Draco only rolled his eyes and went back to stabbing at his food.
"Come on."
Blaise had milk chocolate skin. His chin pointed and his eyes, the exact shade of his skin, maybe even darker. Despite all of this, Draco despised him even more so. If Draco were to be gay, he wouldn't pin after Zabini.
Draco immediately realised that he slept in nothing but a semi-wet towel. He remembered the events that occurred before his middayÂ  nap. He blushed slightly.
Draco frowned. Looks like he found one of Blaise's highest payers.
Theo and Blaise had been best friends for ages. Not as long as Draco and Blaise but long enough to know everything about eachother.
Harry's hands trailed to his hips. He wanted to hug Draco closely but he jumped back when Draco flinched.
"I'm still the same Draco Malfoy."
Draco had said the same 4 words with an unusual monotone, unenthusiastic voice. Looking down at the floor.
Draco turned to glare at the other but Harry only smirked.
with."
Draco felt the familiar eyes of fury from his parents but he didn't look up. He felt the two drop into seats beside him.
Harry stayed silent for a few minutes. He started speaking again.
to know, you
was the reason Draco knew.
"Draco I...."
?" Draco didn't know where this new found confidence came from. He had to admit, he felt pride. Pride that he hadn't felt in a
"Sure. You went to pick them up."
I have a feeling you guys will love the next chapter... Luckily for you, as i'm writing this, the next chapter is complete.
"Ugh, Theo you ruin everything! I bet Draco was
character someone we know very well?" His mother placed a comforting hand on his thigh. He nodded.
"Young Draco," Dumbledore looked up and so did Draco. "Do you have anything else to say before we proceed?"
Draco sighed, exhausted this time. He felt everything melt around him.
Malfoy lifted an eyebrow. "What kind of pictures?"
He then left.
"Well, maybe we can talk to him during dinner." Harry sighed. With the help of Nott, Harry was able to sneak into the Slytherin dorms.
"I don't have to tell you shit. Leave me alone to do whatever the hell i want." The sudden outburst was unintentional. Draco's eyes widened and be took a few steps back.
"Sit down."
They walked down the hallway talking animatedly.
With one last glance back at the sleeping figure in the room, he shut the door.
"I've always loved how naÃ¯ve you were. It was almost laughable."
"Know what?"
to know..."
Theo nodded to his friend urging him to continue.
"Let me down." Harry mumbled. His voice heavy with exhaustion. The blood rushing to his head in a steady speed.
"Why are you so obsessed with my life? Fix your own life before you start bothering people with theirs."
Draco stayed silent. After what felt like hours, he finally spoke up.
"Obviously I can't keep you locked up in here. This
What was he saying? He could survive without Blaise. He can defend himself. He was not soft! He wasn't delicate nor fragile! He was defiantly not weak, and he was certainly not
"What are you doing?" Draco's voice was still muffled
"Draco, you won't regret it, I promise."
"Its only one lesson, just say you weren't feeling well."
"Now now Lucius, let's all take a calm breath," Dumbledore requested. "I'm sure your son is sincerely sorry."
Draco knew he should be celebrating in breaking the boy but he was more worried on being stabbed to death.
"If someone you knew was getting blackmailed by someone they trust. What would you do?" Harry repeated sitting up to look at Ron.
creepy." Theo let out a more distressed exhale. "I thought I was in love. And I told myself that you were just being stubborn. I didn't realise that I was actually
It was pointless in trying to sleep again. Every time Draco closed his eyes, they would wander open and curiously glance around.
Draco's lips moved in sync with Harry's. Draco's eyelids closed. He had never felt so relaxed in his life.
He also didn't need to worry about being too quiet. So Draco roamed around the room. He wasn't worried anymore and it was a wonderful feeling.
"I'm bored." Draco unintentionally blurted out loud.
Draco looked at his arms. The blood dripping from his fresh cuts. His eyes dilated. His lips were agape. He was fascinated.
"He...he..."
"No, the picture was inappropriate."
"I tried all I could. I told my friends but they didn't want to help. I can't tell any above authorities because he's being blackmailed. I can't confront Zabini myself, he would murder me in cold blood. There's nothing else I can do."
"What are you going to do about it Nott? Going to beat me up?"
"Why not skip Charms too? I'm up for another game of Truth or Dare."
Draco gulped quietly. He blushed an even brighter shade of red. He didn't understand why he was even more nervous about having his second kiss than his first.
And the quote Draco hated the most,
He had seen the very first pictures Blaise had taken of Draco and he had immediately fallen in love. It was in third year and Theo had thought he had found
The pair looked away rather awkwardly. Neither of them knew how to keep the conversation active between them and neither of them forgot about the incident that occurred in the Slytherin's dorm.
"We have no Charms homework Draco, don't lie to me."
He also didn't know that his own friend was the one behind this.
"Maybe they didn't go to school because Malfoy was sick...Mate, where are you going?"
"Right... your just
Draco felt himself lean towards the other boy. He silently celebrated when the other did the same.
Draco turned to page 12 immediately. He felt tears prick his eyes. He recognised the pictures, He
"He made me dress in such obscene clothing. He took pictures, awful pictures of me. Such degrading photos I wish to never see. I hate to admit it, but you were right. But now he won't leave me alone."
"Then yes. I do insist on asking you questions every 2 minutes." She looked back to her plate, her eyebrows furrowed.
Theo cleared his throat. "I also wanted to apologise on Blaise's behalf..."
"You're glowing." Blaise pointed out.
"I guess we have to go back to our dorms to get ready."
Parkinson. We're just talking." Draco hissed frustrated.
Theo cocked his head to the side. "I don't see it?"
"Can you stop scraping your plate? It really bothers me." Draco looked up and saw the Parkinson girl. She made her way towards him and placed her plate down next to him.
"Mister Potter, Mister Nott... What a pleasant surprise."
Blaise nodded to him. "How are you today? Did you see The Prophet? How unfortunate."
Harry attended school with Draco for 4 years and not once has he stopped to admire the features of the dainty Slytherin.
"Draco, would you feel comfortable with answering... yes and no questions instead?" he heard the gentle voice of Dumbledore call for him.
Draco thought to himself. He always seemed to forget that Blaise wasn't exactly someone to be trusted. It's hard to trust someone who has no shame in selling a 4th year's nudes to students all around Hogwarts for a hefty price.
Draco inhaled deeply. His legs widened even more as if to try and take Harry closer.
"Harry, you seem to be
"Its Charms. Not Transfiguration." Draco corrected the mistake.
Draco did. Theodore Nott stood, his face red and tears spilling from his eyes. His face expressing extreme amusement.
Draco felt 5 eyes stare down at him. It made him feel nervous and drastically miserable. He felt as if oxygen was harder to breathe.
Draco furrowed his eyebrows. "That's harsh. She really likes you."
"It's a private matter I don't feel comfortable enough to discuss with you yet." Draco partially reassured her.
"Oh geez, I'm so sorry Draco."
Malfoy dropped to his knees to collect the books Zabini dropped. Harry noticed Zabini doing something.
"What do you want, Potter."
The door opened and Draco walked in. He looked at the boys and smiled oblivious to the situation.
scared. Leave me alone Zabini. I deserve better than you."
When Draco believed he was finished, he grabbed his towel and wrapped it around his waist. He jumped out of the shower and turned the water off. He walked towards the mirror and took a second to properly look at himself in the mirror.
"Maybe I can obliviate them?" Harry suggested to himself. Ron and Hermione turned to him.
"Let's get you fitted into more comfortable clothes."
Harry shook his head exasperated. "No, I'm not a Slytherin."
"We have Herbology."
Draco felt cold and sweaty suddenly. He was scared for himself. He had suspected an active being to be in the room and instead of trusting his gut feeling, he had trusted Blaise.
Blaise only shrugged. "I tried to stop him."
Harry felt his face heat up unnaturally quickly. His throat tightened and the steam from the recent shower started to cloud his vision and make his head pound even harder.
Draco sighed quietly into the kiss.
He wished he had never befriended Zabini. He wished Potter hadn't of told him about what Zabini was doing. He wished... he wished that he had been more
Draco hated the fact that Harry spoke in riddles. It would take him forever to find the room.
"Let's go to the dorms, Draco. Its class time, no one will disturb us.
Why was the cat ignoring them?
The girl's eyes widened. Draco had never called her, or anyone else, by their first name. Only Blaise. It was a sign of trust.
?" He heard his mother whisper to him.
Harry stood up from his seat. What the hell was wrong with his friends!? Why were they acting so odd. "You know what? Nevermind. I'm Harry Potter. I defeated Voldemort when I was
"Well... not really... its nothing. Nothing bad happened. Just drop it." Draco growled when the taller boy ignored his wished.
Skeeter sat in her office. She groaned in frustration. She hadn't had any juicy articles to write about in almost two months. The Prophet was slowly losing paying customers because of the lack of interest in the world.
Harry took this opportunity to show Draco the picture be had. He put the picture on the table and turned it to Draco's view.
Under normal circumstances, Draco wouldn't of allowed himself to be lead to his own dorms. But the thought of staying by Harry's side for just a little while longer had Draco more than happy to oblige.
"Does Zabini ask you to do anything you think is weird?" Potter repeated his question.
Harry snickered rolling his eyes.
He had walked into Draco Malfoy right as he was leaving the shower.
"I hope you choke on your fork." Draco mumbled getting out of bed. He made his way towards the bathroom.
"Pansy? What's going on?" Draco whispered. No one in the hall was talking and Draco's voice sounded loud against the silence.
"..."
Draco blinked. Then he groaned loudly. Pansy could be really annoying when she wanted to.
"You worry too much. No one's here." He smirked.
Narcissa looked at her son. She sobbed loudly. She got up and ran into Lucius' arms heartbroken.
His friends shared a hesitant glance before reluctantly nodding an agreement.
Draco woke up, refreshed. He stretched and yawned.
"You wouldn't."
to strike up a conversation but if you're just gonna tease me, then forget it."
(See the end of the chapter for
"Bullshit." Ron snorted. "You haven't listened to today's lessons. You were spacing out."
Harry scratched the back of his neck nervously. "It's a long story..."
Draco knew he was close to going insane. Just like his aunt Bellatrix. The mere thought of her made Draco shiver.
This was it.
"Okay, I'm done."
Blaise had his head turned so he faced the bathroom door. His wand still in the air. Harry took this opportunity to reach up and snatch the other's weapon
would you suggest to
Harry stayed quiet. What was he meant to say?
Draco couldn't do anything. He couldn't even owl his mother. HeÂ physically couldn't. Blaise had taken over his life. He even looked over the letters Draco sends. He had no privacy nor did he have any self control.
"It's just a damn hickey, are you
Harry blushed stopping abruptly. Draco also blushed when he caught on. It was quite an experience for the both of them.
Next to Dumbledore, Professor McGonagall and Snape. The two professors looked down at him, disappointment in their eyes.
help, then forget about this whole situation. I don't find this amusing in the slightest." He left immediately after.
Blaise cleared his throat and put in a cool expression. "Well I've been observing Draco quite closely and I've noticed something."
"Are you going to tag along to the common room with me?"
Draco felt his face ache with how wide he smiled. He bit his lip softening the intensity of his grin. He looked up and looked towards the Gryffindor table. Harry was in his usual spot already looking at Draco. The other smiled. His smile lit the entire room. Draco felt his heart pound at his chest.
"Blaise I said no."
"What did you want to meet me here for?" Draco asked eventually.
"DRACO."
"So?" Draco looked back at Theo. His face void of emotion.
"Let's go back to the dorms then."
"After you,
"If you're just gonna insult me, I don't want to hear it."
Draco grimaced. He started to feel uncomfortable and warm. He knew why they were looking at him. He knew what they were thinking of him. It was just like Blaise said.
Go ahead and put that on the paper, bitch."
Draco bit his lip. He stared at the mirror glancing at his figure. He hated how he allowed himself to be used.
The boy sighed. "Thank Merlin. I thought she'd never leave."
"Not anymore." Blaise grabbed Draco's wrist rather forcefully and dragged him towards the chambers.
"P-punishment? No Pansy please, you don't
But Malfoy was
"Suggestive pictures."
"It doesn't have to be." A voice answered. Draco's eyes widened. He looked down at his wand. For a moment he had thought he'd heard his wand
"Rise and shine, sleeping beauty."
"Mistakes are common, that is no lie. But participating in underage pornography is nothing to ignore. Especially when you're caught." Snape furrowed his brows.
Draco and Pansy's summed up relationship. Where is Theo? Where is Harry?
"Yeah but surely they would let me slide." Harry smirked leaning back on his chair. "I
Now all Harry needed was photographic evidence.
The girl was Pansy Parkinson. Daughter of Mr and Mrs Parkinson. She was an average looking girl. She wasn't drop dead gorgeous nor was she foul looking. She sat somewhere inbetween. Some might say she was somewhat pretty in a way.
Blaise chucked. "Great, isn't it?"
help. Or why can't he help Draco by himself? He defeated Voldemort when he was barely one. How is it harder to defeat a boy his age?
"Oh, no I don't mind."
"Oh. I didn't hear the questions."
Harry smiled in pride. "My father had it and I inherited it."
"Just leaving a little
Maybe we should see this as karma for all the bad things he's done to not only us, but others."
"Leave me alone, Blaise."
He slipped into his robes and walked down to the common room where Blaise waited for him.
Draco sighed. "That's disappointing. I took the time to dress up." Draco smiled warmly. The truth was that he didn't care too much about his clothing.
Draco nodded. Harry smiled.
Draco picked up his wand that lay under his pillow. He flicked his wand lazily whilst he whispered a quiet
But he felt a strong pair of arms on his waist as he was hoisted up. He yelped in surprise and sat up. He fixed an angry look on his face.
"Did you see my quote? Amazing, it was. Took me an hour to think of it." Blaise smirked, poison dripped from his words.
"I didn't know wands could speak... Can every wand speak?" Draco smiled widely. He was excited.
"I know you well. When you wake up from a long slumber, you are unable to go back to sleep. Surely, you changed for another reason?"
Harry stepped closer to the blond suddenly protective, "You didn't attend class. I suspected something was wrong."
Harry sighed verbally dropping his head in his hands. He rubbed his face trying to wipe the exhaustion from his eyes.
Draco thought to himself. He couldn't even remember why he waited outside the Divination room.
Draco nodded his leave. The room heavy with misery. The misery of losing a student.
The grip was stiff. The black haired boy's knuckles turned white and shook with such anger Draco had never seen. He must of struck a nerve.
"Where are you going? I thought I said be back before Charms."
You see, Blaise was greedy. He would do anything for money. Even if it was morally bad or illegal. But Blaise was smart, he knew how to get away with things that could get him expelled from Hogwarts.
"You'll play Truth or Dare with me, right?"
Harry once again, more violently this time, pushed Draco onto the desk. Draco groaned at the impact.
"I'm sorry, i didn't mean to barge in. I just need to find something and I'll be on my..."
But the shaking didn't stop. They were insistent.
"It's okay Pansy. Pucey was pretty aggressive." Draco mumbled.
Harry felt uneasy when he saw Zabini and Draco walk into the Great Hall the next day. The two boys were nowhere to be found the day before. They hadn't attended any of their classes nor have they been seen walking the halls in or outside Hogwarts. That's when Harry took a moment to take in Draco's appearance.
Draco couldn't distract himself with the potion, he had to let it sit. So Draco turned to face Harry but avoided his eyes.
"Fuck, you like my cock down your throat, don't you bitch?"
Draco gasped and whispered. "You have a hallow?"
"I woke up early so I decided to take a walk, what about you?"
"No, I'm doing something today."
Blaise's eyes darkened. He got up from the soft cushion seat he sat on. He walked over to the bed and grabbed a piece of cloth and threw it at Draco's direction.
Draco shrugged. He looked back down to the wand in his hands.
Draco turned his attention to his plate. Maybe it had been once in a lifetime. Harry had confessed to saying he liked him and Draco had done the same. It didn't mean that the two were going to
Harry had been attacked with an idea.
He blinked languidly as he stared at the time.
? He is literally being invaded of his privacy." Harry's frustration began to take effect in his voice. He felt like banging his head on the table below him.
"Its ok, its fine. We'll get though this. Your reputation will be restored and everything will turn out okay." Harry quietly whispered still pacing the room.
The room was dark, the only light source emitting from his wand. He had cast a lumos charm but instead of creating a bright white, his wand casted a soft blue glow that reflected off Draco's eyes so delicately.
He recieved no response.
Malfoy gaffawed, "I don't need a bodyguard, Potter. I've been walking through the Hogwarts hallways for years, I think I'll be fine. Thanks but no thanks, prat."
"Why not? He doesn't care for you."
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco twisted his neck so the back of his head faced the taller boy. He couldn't stand his presence.
Harry grinned warmly. Draco did not return the same look. Instead, he stared at the two with a deep scowl.
No longer metallic silver
As if Draco had read his mind. "Blaise isn't stupid. He knows what you did."
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco's glowing. So is Harry. Pansy's positive. Blaise isn't.

I have no idea what their heights are so I searched it up,,,,ðŸ˜ƒðŸ”«
"Its a deal."
"Blaise took a picture of
"My... my wand?" Draco felt unshed tears blur his vision. So many situations were going on at once. He couldn't keep his thoughts straight.
Nott smirked and quietly walked with Draco.
On the other side of the photos were pictures of Draco in very
"You're soft. You seem intimidating but you're harmless. Delicate.
Blaise rolled his eyes playfully. "Don't take too long."
"How...how did you get this?" Harry asked in shock.
"Well mainly, I wanted to apologise for being a bit creepy towards you."
Once again, silence. Draco didn't feel too comfortable with Potter asking questions about him and Blaise. Especially after the game of Truth or Dare they had. Did Potter know any of what was happening? He decided to take his shot.
Potter had black hair which he never styled. It was always swept into a messy curl which gave off the image of him having bed hair. He had an olive skin complexion. He almost looked golden whenever he stood on the sun. His eyes were a rare shade of green. They were bright and capturing. The same shade as the Avada Kedavra curse. It was almost frightening especially when Potter's face contorted into something more menacing. It was too bad that his huge glasses covered his eyes most of the time. Draco so wished that he'd wear contacts instead. Maybe then he'd be able to gaze at his eyes more often...
"Let me escort you there." Snape rushed to say but Headmaster Dumbledore requested he stopped.
Draco didn't realise he was drooling. He quickly looked away but Harry grabbed his face before he could. Harry was right infront of him.
Silence came over the two once again. Awkwardness returning to the pair.
Harry's anger flared like wildfire. He saw red as he charged towards the boy infront of him ready to throw punches. He forgot the very overpowering power imbalance for the second boy held a wand whilst he did not.
"I asked you a question, Nott."
These were questions Draco would answer at a later date. At this moment, all he wanted was to feel the other kiss him gently.
situations. Tasks he does everyday suddenly showcased as normal pornography.
"No, I need to attend this lesson." Draco thought of an excuse still looking for his homework. Why is it that when he needed something the most, he wouldn't be able to find it?
"Trust your son. You hate The Prophet. You said it yourself. The Prophet is filled with lies and deceit and only a simpleton would believe anything that the paper says."
Theo waved his hands. "It's no problem. I didn't want anything bad happening to you."
"I can understand why. They disappeared yesterday then randomly came back." Hermione concluded.
The room had no colour scheme. It was all in a soft cream colour and the bed was decorated in pure silk covers. The room was dimly lit by a few candles and rose petals scattered the floor.
Adrian kept his grip. "It doesn't have to be a one time thing."
saw it."
Draco looked away and Harry began speaking again. "After you left, Zabini pointed his wand and jinxed me."
She smirked at Ron looking smug. Seems like Harry chose the right answer.
Theo stared at one picture that was a closeup of his body in the shower.
a school. We'll go down for dinner and you'll attend classes tomorrow." Blaise grabbed Draco's arm quite harshly and led him out of the dorms.
"Now now dear, let's listen to what Professor Dumbledore has to say first." Narcissa reached her hand out to place on her husband's knee in a calming gesture. Lucius physically calmed down.
"Who are we even talking about?" Ron asked.
Blaise has an idea on how to get Draco to do what he wants, but its not very legal...
of the Prophet. Don't even get me started on
His hair was platinum blond and soft. He was a pale boy who seemed to glow in the moonlight. In conclusion, Draco was handsome.
Why did he have to be blindfolded? What was the gag for? As a matter of fact, Draco has never seen a gag in his life, well before the game of Truth and Dare. What were gags even used for? Maybe it stopped the person wearing it from speaking.
"I followed him."
"Suck."
another girl or boy.
"Why do you want to skip class anyway?"
Draco had stared in the mirror. His hair was extremely messy. light bags were under his eyes and... his lips were slightly swollen.
Draco suddenly felt as if he could fly. He felt as if years of pressure and sadness had been lifted from his figure. He felt
Draco scratched the back of his neck. He felt awkward all of a sudden. The realness of the situation settled in Draco's mind. He wanted to melt out of the earth. No matter how many times he tried to think of the bright sides of the situation, he still wanted to curl up into a ball and cry. Well, there wasn't really any good side to this situation. He hated his body. The fact that it wasn't his own private body but instead a product people would pleasure themselves too.
Theo was hesitant. But Blaise was older and more matured than anyone he knew so he went along with the idea. No questions asked.
Draco heard a small sound of a locking charm. Then a silencing charm.
"No, why are you speaking to me like that? I'm not seven years old." Draco rolled his eyes annoyed and resumed his work on the potion since Potter insisted on asking weird questions instead of helping.
Blaise looked the blond up and down. He then frowned.
becauseÂ it is
"...Hermione can you clarify what Harry just said?"
"What are you doing?" Draco laughed softly.
Harry had recalled that Malfoy was mimicking what he had said in the potions lesson. Harry snorted in slight amusement. He instantly frowned when he realised the seriousness of the situation.
The sudden chatter of students snapped him out of his daydream. Students started to pour out of their lessons. He assumed that they were dismissed.
Draco sighed dramatically. "Do you insist on asking me questions every 2 minutes?"
"Whatever happened last night, it was probably life changing. That smile is glued to your face."
for a picture. He showed the picture to Malfoy. As a result, Malfoy confronted Zabini. Zabini found out that Harry was the one who told Draco about his
he leaving? Why wasn't he running somewhere, anywhere? Why did he feel inclined to stay by Blaise's side?
Theo stared him up and down smirking. If Draco noticed this, he didn't mention it.
"What time is it?" Draco asks.
Harry smiled. "Molly stitched it for me for Christmas."
Draco frowned. "I thought you said that there weren't as much orders because of Quidditch season?"
Draco nodded vigorously. He felt like he was in heaven. He had no he was a masochist. The thought of pain made his cock twitch.
Time passed by in superhuman speed. One second, they were beside the door and the next, Harry was on the bed with Draco under him.
"I've deducted that." Draco waved a hand in dismissal.
"Is it morally bad? Yes, I won't deny it. But how much money do I make in a week average? About 250 Galleons."
By the time this is out id probably by getting ready to go to school
"I haven't seen you this close before..." Harry whispered. "You are beautiful."
"I said Truth, not dare..."
"Do you know?" Draco blurted out.
Draco didn't say anything. He was silent. Harry could visibly see his metallic silver eyes dim into dull grey.
He ran through the halls dodging students who were retreating to class. He almost made it to the dungeons but someone stepped infront of him and he fell with a grunt.
Harry felt awful for what he had done. Malfoy was a victim to blackmail and is being forced to sell nudes and Harry was freaking out and blushing like a teenage girl because he got to see Malfoy leave the shower.
Or that's what he thought...
"Have you?" Draco's voice was quiet.
Even in his drunken state, he didn't fail to notice how odd the instructions were.
"Watch it, Golden boy!"
"Harry, you can't expect to drop such information on us and expect no further questions." Hermione shook her head.
"Pansy, you
How could of Blaise of possibly known? Draco had only been expelled barely 2 minutes ago and Blaise had already been told?
"Draco?" A stern yet unsure voice whispered.
Draco raised an eyebrow and looked around the room lazily. "What are you referring to? You've done quite a lot of things. Can't you be a lot less vague?"
Draco needed to get help.
"What are
He couldn't get enough of it.
"In what way?" Draco furrowed his eyebrows in confusion.
Draco acted out his awakening. He tossed and turned then rubbed his eyes. He sat himself up and leaned against the headboard yawning slightly.
A string of moans were pulled out of his mouth. He shook in ecstasy. He could hear Harry's soft groans when Draco wriggled against his crotch.
"Tender? Why? What happened?"
He had also found out that a girl in his house, Astoria Greengrass, was rumored to have a crush on him. He shivered. He kind of wished that Pansy hadn't told him that.
Harry only sighed miserably.
"You're a great dominant." Draco smirked. He knew the answer to his question.
"Fine." Draco left the classroom once Snape let the class go.
"No way...no no no. I'm not working with your buckteeth and charity booth friends."
Draco turned reluctantly to see a pair of dark brown eyes stare at him rather curiously. He rolled his.
"The hell i would."
Blaise followed suit. "You are eager to get out of here but don't be too sad. I'm sure you'll find a career in Muggle London. Maybe you'll use that body of yours to earn more money than your family has ever seen."
Harry stared at the figure before him. He hadn't just walked into
"Divination is boring. Does it really matter if you miss it?" Harry interjected.
"Do you like him?"
When Blaise came back, he held more clothes.
"Play Truth or Dare with me."
Draco stopped in his tracks when the two boys left the common room. Blaise heard the abrupt pause of footsteps and turned back to Draco.
I'll try and get the next chapter out faster cuz I also need to focus on my Wattpad stories
I can do this on my own!"
Aware of the fact that in the middle of third year... Blaise started acting weird towards him. Aware of the fact that he'd see a flash and camera shutter at random times of the day. Aware of the fact that... that this was all
the other boy to let go. His screams led to no result.
"Its Malfoy, I bet its Malfoy." Ron pointed his finger in Hermione's face
"You're kidding..." Harry's eyes widened shocked at Draco's words.
Blaise looked at Draco. "Sit up."
Draco was... he was...
The boy tried to find the strength to pick himself up but his currently asleep arm made it harder to carry his weight.
Why was everyone suddenly treating Draco as if he was inhuman? And everyone was reading the Prophet. No one reads The Prophet anymore. Not since drama in the Wizarding World died down.
"How did you.."
He felt the sudden want to wash his face with cold water. He wondered if Zabini and Malfoy had any potions or tablets for Harry's pounding headache. He decided to go and check.
It was awkward, Draco could feel Nott looking at him and it became harder to ignore his presence.
Draco's eyes widened comically. He had remembered that when he was with Blaise, he had heard a quiet noise. Like something was shuffling around the room, It had worried Draco massively and he had told Blaise of his worries.
Draco's hand dropped from the door knob. Maybe...
"I was walking to breakfast with Ron and Hermione when I saw you and Zabini walking to breakfast too. Do you remember dropping your books?"
The silence between them was deafening.
Harry hid behind a pillar listening closely to the conversation.
He backed away until his back clashed with the desk. Glass viles fell on his head. Harry stalked forward.
Draco looked towards the front and saw the instructions on how to brew the potion. The perfect potion would recieve full marks.
"Narcissa we don't
, left rather loudly. Draco had pretended to be asleep while the exchange had taken place not wanting to be dragged into the conversation or looked at weirdly.
"Okay, you aren't seven, but I need to know this information."
Only inches away from the other's lips did they pause. Draco could feel Harry's soft breath skim over his lips. It sent soft tingles down his figure. They stopped only to look down at each other's lips. It had been obvious that they were both inexperienced and nervous.
This is a small flashback. These are the details Theo tells Harry
"Draco, can I speak to you?" Pansy looked at Blaise, "In
"I was gonna get my wand. I left it on my bed."
"I said, do you know that..."
Blaise tsked quietly. "Weak comebacks like that will only get you so far. Unfortunately, not far enough I'm afraid."
do. Every idea leads to a dead end."
"Obliviating a student can get you a painful sentencing in Azkaban for intruding ones personal thoughts."
He was ready to insult whoever got in his way but he realised
The door to the dorm room opened. He had been sure it was Blaise even if he hadn't looked behind him.
Draco grumbled into the pillow. He was on the brink of death and he was sure he had heavy bags under his eyes.
Draco felt himself being shaken. He groaned loudly, lifting the duvet over his face.
Draco was also pure. He wanted to be
It took him a moment for Draco to realise who had called for him.
"Oh, I'm
"Ouch." Blaise lifted a hand to his chest, looking affronted. "Talk about a backstab, that cut me
"No. I'm not actually." Draco gave the other a sneer and turned away.
He listened to his Godfather drone on about the do's and don'ts of potions.
feminine type. He didn't have a big appetite therefore he didn't eat much. It had a pretty positive affect as his waist was thin and hips were fairly wide. He didn't notice any of this.
That's when he realised he had to meet up with Potter during breakfast.
"Draco? Are you okay?" Narcissa placed a hand on her son's shoulder when she could see he was struggling with his words. "Just breathe, sweetheart."
The fact that Draco told Harry he'll see him later gave Harry an unsettling feeling about leaving him alone. Harry hesitated but shouted before he left, "Let me escort you there."
"Hey Pansy."
"I need to go." Draco spoke up. He looked up to see Harry's face but it was blurred by the unshead tears in his eyes. He walked, no, ran out of the room with an arm over his face.
"Fine, whatever."
Draco woke up with a dull ache in his neck. He groaned audibly when he sat up feeling his neck throb in pain. He must of slept in an odd position.
where he belongs." Draco's usual haughty voice formed to a deep snarl.
"No I heard what you said, I'm just confused on whyÂ you're asking me."
"Yeah, I know. But it's better than nothing, right?"
He heard Potter sigh next to him. "Like, does he touch you in a way that makes you feel uncomfortable?"
Gregory Goyle, He was probably worst looking than Crabbe.
are great help and if you want to get out of this blackmail, I suggest you stop insulting my friends."
Blaise performs a spell on Harry for too long. Harry gets lightheaded. He needs something for his head.
They always insist
Pansy grinned. "Do you want to walk to breakfast together?"
Now he was being blackmailed. His parents had no idea on how much stress was being put on their son and neither does the whole Wizarding World. One wrong move and Blaise would do everything he could to make sure every living soul knew how much of a queer Draco really was.
"Yeah mate. We have loads of questions. How long did you know about this? How did you find out? And also...Malfoy?"
Sorry if there are any mistakes
"I'm sorry, I couldn't help it. You looked so upset I wanted to lighten the mood!" Nott had said once he had sobered up enough.
"That doesn't matter. What matters is that you're keeping the Headmaster waiting. Here. I'll escort you to the dorms." Blaise held his arm out for Draco. He had obviously expected Draco to take his arm into his hand. "
"You're
"Yes you are. You're all pink, its adorable." Blaise smirked teasingly.
"I hope you're happy." Hermione disciplined. "Not only did we lose 45 house points, i have to work even harder to gain McGonagall's trust again."
"What happened between you two?" She urged.
"It was lovely hosting you today but I think it's time for you to go."
Blaise snorted humourlessly. "That's the point."
"But to answer your question. Yes, I found him in the library before I came here. Its funny you asked. He asked me to tell you to meet him in the dorm rooms after breakfast."'
Blaise passed him a stack of photos faced down.
Harry sighed heavily. Great. Now he has to avoid Zabini. He'd probably beat him up if he saw him alone.
Harry pulled out his wand from the nightstand behind the bed and cast the duvet over them.
Draco hummed. Pansy gasped and looked at him wide eyed. "That's Adrian Pucey! He is so
Of course. Why did Draco
Harry's hands wrapped around the crease of Draco's leg keeping him from falling.
"Does he touch you in an unnatural way?"
She raised an eyebrow and scoffed. "I'm a Slytherin too, believe it or not. I eat here."
Blaise smirked sitting next to Draco on his bed.
Blaise was the
neat.
Draco didn't remove the jeans however, he pulled them down slightly and lifted the turtle neck he wore exposing his right hip. "Is it bruised?"
"Clean yourself up."
Blaise is the bad guy here
"And I think that someone should stand up for you. I can't believe Blaise would do that. And I don't understand why the professors won't listen to reason..."
Blaise smirked. He shook his head and chuckled darkly. "Oh I won't."
"See what?"
"What's what?" Draco spat, his voice bitter and molded.
Harry needn't be told twice. He searched for the door handle behind him. His eyes were attached to Malfoy's nimble body as if he were hypnotised. He left the room quickly.
"Oh? So we're being honest now? Okay. Listen here. You're a nasty perv who should be expelled and rotting in Azkaban. Or maybe instead, burning in hell along with your father. I wish horrible things upon you and your gold digging mother. Blaise Zabini, I wish that you grow in struggle in poverty. Or maybe better yet, for your first kiss to be from a dementor. Why won't you realise that your a piece of shit? I feel bad for you. Honestly, I do. You're a miserable person. I pray for the next person to befriend or, Merlin forbid, date you. So yes. What you tell me
"The only reason no one has advanced on you is because I was around. They don't want to hear from me when I hear they've tried messing around with my friend now would they?"
"So?" Malfoy placed his hands on either side of his hips in an act of impatience. "What information did I need to know that I
"Drop it. I don't want to talk about it."
Catching sight of the boy, he smirked. "What can I do for you, Potter?"
Blaise reached out into Draco's robes pockets before Draco could react. He extracted a wand and held it up. "Is this your wand?"
Almost suddenly, the door opened. Behind the door, Malfoy entered looking elegant as always.
No, father and mother would be...
"Sorry, professor, I got distracted."
Harry nodded. "I don't know how he took these but he sold this to me for 300 Galleons."
"Whore."
The quiet common room clashed with her loud voice. Soon, the area around them buzzed to life. Whispers erupted the room making the formerly silent territory turn into a noisily packed place.
Blaise knew him well. Draco didn't trust that old bastard even if it were to secure his safety. Draco's steps were hesitant.
"If you're able to save other people, why don't you start saving yourself?"
Draco furrowed his eyebrows. It wasn't like Nott to suddenly disappear. Not like he was worried. It was just unsettling that he mysteriously went missing.
" Blaise smirked darkly.
The whole room smelled of Lemon Lavander and Green Apple.
The lips pressed against his own were soft and pleasantly warm. Draco had never kissed another before but the feeling felt
Draco took a good look at himself and frowned. He wore a mesh top and a short pleated skirt. It wasn't
"What are you even talking about?" Draco spat.
Everyone in the room held their breaths. The old Headmaster's hands curled around Draco's wand. It felt as if Draco's heart were being tugged.
The serious look on Harry's face seemed to of jogged something in Draco's memory.
Blaise had asked him to meet him in common room during their free period to view some of the pictures he's taken so far. Blaise wanted Theo to see them first.
The darker skinned boy stood up and walked over to the other boy in the room. He pointed his wand under Harry's chin and smirked.
Harry had tried his hardest to keep his eyes away from Malfoy's lower region but yet again, the temptation was hard to fight with.
Harry laughed lightly. "Come on...I'll take you back to your dorms."
"In addition." Blaise had resumed speaking. "You should be thanking me, as I said before. People want you. I
to listen to me. These pictures-"
He had his eyes focused on his plate avoiding mere eye contact with anyone at all. He needed help but didn't know how to ask for any. The only person willing to help him was Potter.
At that very moment, Theo told Harry everything.
Oops!
"I want a picture..."
Draco, despite himself, got up from bed. He had looked at the other bed in the room. It was empty.
Harry didn't urge to start a conversation. Instead, he looked at the shorter boy. Draco, too nervous and fidgety to speak up, looked away playing with his fingers. He didn't know why Harry kept quiet nor did he understand why he looked at Draco. Draco blushed under his gaze.
A family of Zabini's. The house of the most talented, selfish manipulators. Blaise smirked. Not feeling any bit of sympathy. All he knew is that he had Draco wrapped around his finger and he intended to take advantage of the situation.
It seemed like Draco's theory was proven right since Blaise told him exactly what Draco believed was true. It still shocked Draco on how long he slept however not everything comes with an answer.
Do you think i should detail the kind of pictures Blaise takes or should I leave them blurred?
Blaise chuckled nervously. "Well... I actually wanted to speak to you about something important."
"No. No I'm fine. Thanks for asking."
"Then why did you even ask?" Draco looked away, his happy mood permanently destroyed.
His voice sounded raw and cracked. He sounded like he had been
"Look Potter, I fulfil desires, I don't tell my strategies." Zabini answered rolling his eyes as if the answer were obvious.
"I think I may fancy you also."
Draco, who was too drunk to notice what was happening, stood up waiting for instructions.
"So... This
has just been expelled and they are on their way to the dungeons to collect their one way ticket
"This is humiliating." Draco's voice was muffled from the gag on his mouth
It only took a few seconds until Draco felt the foreign sensation of another's lips touch his.
She shook her head. "I asked him a couple of times but he always found a way to avoid the subject. Seems like he doesn't want anyone to know." Parkinson looked around and leaned into Draco's ear. Draco also leaned in. "If you ask me, I think Theo was out secretly banging chicks and blokes." She leaned back smirking.
"What do you want?"
Harry moved his hands from the door to Draco's waist, hugging it securely. Draco raised his arms and wrapped them comfortably around Harry's neck, pulling at his hair softly.
Malfoy mouthed at him.
"Leave the poor boy alone, Mione." Ron rolled his eyes seemingly unbothered by the points they've lost. "We have more important things to discuss."
"Do you know Zabini is taking pictures of you in inappropriate positions and selling them to students?" Potter mumbled.
Harry practically slammed the door shut. He ran around the room looking for his wand. When he found it, he jumped in bed. He drew up the curtains and cast strong silencing charms.
We wanted it to happen again. He wanted the knife to cut his skin again.
"Decided to skip this lesson. Didn't feel like doing Transfiguration."
With little to no effort, Zabini muttered a small spell. He jinxed Harry's feet causing him to trip over his own heels and hover upside down in the air.
Draco frowned at the tame response. "At least I took the time to wear something decent. Your sense of style is atrocious."
Harry intervened when he felt the murderous energy radiating in the room. "Don't worry, Draco. He can help us get you out of being blackmailed." Theo nodded eagerly at Harry's words.
He looked at Blaise who smiled at him sweetly. It infuriated him. How could he act so kindly to the person he's blackmailing for nudes? It was utter nonsense to Draco.
"Keep wishing and it may come true." He heard Blaise call after him.
"So you saw..."
Therefore, Draco's plate consisted of scrambled egg and a slice of apple pie with pumpkin juice. Draco's mouth watered at the sight of the food on his plate however he didn't want to pick any of it up worried that he'd satisfy the darker Slytherin's pride. He didn't want to seem as if he could control himself so instead he picked at his food frowning upon it.
"Did you see that?" Draco asked.
Pansy, who sat on the couch, had gotten up and walked towards Draco. Not before greeting the boy next to him.
"I'm sure others did."
"He doesn't
Draco looked at Pansy in slight concern as she giggled like a 12 year old girl.
"He promised me that he wouldn't take pictures as worse as shower pictures."
"Who do you think is right, Harry."
"In your dreams, Potter."
Draco didn't have to be told twice. He grabbed the base of Harry's cock. He practically inhaled the cock into his mouth. He lapped his tongue around the length taking in all he could muster. The remains he couldn't take in were occupied with his palm. He hollowed his cheeks and bobbed his head. He looked up at Harry. The boy had his head thrown back and his arms on the desk behind him.
"This class, we will be learning to brew Draught of Peace. A potion to relieve stress and agitation..." Snape rambled about the potion and Draco stopped listening. He couldn't stop thinking about all the weird requests Blaise asked him to do.
"But I..."
When Blaise had recommended his
Harry sighed. He had explained the same situation more than 5 times and his friends still didn't seem to understand.
Draco shrugged. "That doesn't explain why you were in the dorms."
"So...How's life?"
Despite the shadow over the boy's face, Rita could identify the smirk that played on his features. "It's all in this briefcase."
It was silent at first but Potter tried to strike up a conversation.
Draco didn't have a partner.
He took a moment to catch his breath. He hadn't realised that he had been chewing on his bottom lip in obvious nervousness at the sudden adrenaline rush.
When Draco arrived in the common room, he was dressed in his school robes holding his potion books, ready to start the day.
After dressing, he grabbed his wand and slid it under his hoodie into the sides of his shorts.
"Why do you insist on playing that stupid game?"
Ron turned to Harry, a crazed expression. "Now why in the
(See the end of the chapter for
"Alright Class, stop what you're doing, it's time to assess the potions."
He scoffs. "I doubt that."
Blaise got up without a word. He left immediately.
Harry took out the picture but didn't show Malfoy just yet.
What about the stockings Blaise made Draco wear. Draco had seen stockings before but he never wore them. They were uncomfortable and they itched Draco's skin.
Draco woke up tired. He woke up warm and comfortable but he couldn't keep his eyes open. He lifted his head up slightly to look outside. It was still dark outside but, according to his Tempus charm, it was already 6:15AM.

Draco had looked at the time again. 1:08. It was still massively early but he didn't feel like running around the room for much longer.
"When did you change your clothes?"
Harry practically snatched the note. He stormed out of the classroom not so quietly. He knew excacly where he was headed.
"Yeah, I just feel like I'm gonna drop my books."
Pansy sighed. "Wow Draco I... I never took you to be
Malfoy suddenly found his voice. He cried out in a violent shriek. "What the fuck are you doing in here?!"
Blaise had been trying to rise a fight out of the shorter boy. He could tell by the blond's slowly reddening face, Draco was ready to fight. Blaise wanted that. Maybe he could get the boy in enough trouble to get him under house arrest from the Ministry.
Theo immediately started to rummage through his pockets taking out what he believed was 10 Galleons. Blaise's eyes widened.
It had all felt so surreal to the boy. Since he was only but a young child, he had waited ever so enthusiastically for an acceptance letter to Hogwarts. He was barely halfway through the year and that dream had came crumbling down.
Draco subconsciously spread his legs open.
"I don't need a wand. You aren't too much of a competition."
Draco was confused, sure. He thought he saw something. Apparently not.
"Thanks I guess. I try my hardest to look my best every hour of the day." Draco prided himself.
He stared taking in every detail. The curve on Draco's hips, the curve on his lips, the narrow trail of the boy's waist and the blond's damp hair.
Draco stuttered slightly, "I woke up because it was cold. I changed into something else."
The kiss lasted a lifetime. When they pulled back, their hair was ruffled and their faces were bright.
"You don't like me. You're probably a pervert that had regular meetups with Blaise."
He pulled out a small object. A camera of some sort. He took a picture of...
I'm certain that this chapter will make you hate Blaise which is good
"Well hurry up."
Blaise stood up to his full height and walked towards Draco. Draco didn't back away, it would show signs of fear and submission. However it was hard to keep his facial expressions sturdy. Blaise was much taller than him standing at an impressive 6'4. Overlooking Draco who only stood at an average 5'9.
"Blaise..."
Pansy blushed. "Everyone likes him! But he obviously likes you."
Grateful? Why should Draco be grateful? Thanks for selling my body to random schoolmates. Is that his definition of grateful?
Draco rested his arms around Harry's shoulders.
"What about tomorrow during breakfast."
Why hasn't Draco pushed him away yet? Why didn't he say anything rude towards the Gryffindor. Why did he instead stare at the other's lips and bite his own? Did he perhaps
"Draco's body type is alot more...how do I put this...less manly than ours?" Blaise raised an eyebrow not knowing if he had phrased the sentence right.
"Do you take pictures?"
"Where were you?"
Nott was a weird bloke.
The 3 looked down in humiliation and remorse. "No professor."
"How pathetic, the
The walk back was mostly silent. Very few words were exchanged. There was nothing to talk about. It wasn't uncomfortable or awkward. Just inconvenient.
Draco only looked away.
Blaise left the room to go fetch something.

Harry asks Draco a few questions about Blaise and Draco answers.
"Having trouble finding your wand, Potter?" Blaise chuckled humorlessly.
"Don't change the bloody subject you prick. I know what you're trying to do."
"What are you doing here?" Both boys asked simultaneously. They both stayed quiet waiting for the other person to speak first. When it became obvious that the other wasn't going to answer, Harry took responsibility into his own hands.
"What's going on? Why did he leave? He had his hands on you! It looked like it was going so well." Pansy sulked.
"Expel me?!" Draco's eyes widened and his eyebrows furrowed. No
Draco walked through the Hogwarts Halls at 3 in the morning. He had to admit. Hogwarts didn't look as homely as it usually did in the morning. Right now, it was eerily silent and the sound of his own footsteps were deafening to his own ears.
true. You're just being a manipulative piece of
The kiss was motionless at first, neither knew what to do. Soon however, the actions flowed more instinctively.
" Draco furrowed his eyebrows, his lip curled into a snarl.
The boy simply nodded.
"Can I go to the toilets?"
I saw my son on the
The blond turned his head to the person Pansy had been referring to. True to her word, another Slytherin had been looking at him, he gave a charming smile when he caught Draco's eye.
He shut the curtains around his bed.
Draco rolled his eyes but Harry ignored it and continued, "When i came into the dorms, I saw him... and you..."
Theodore Nott. No, he wasn't his type.
Harry grimaced. It did not look threatening for he was hovering upside down in the air. He looked quite ridiculous.
Draco was finally free...
"So...
Potter looked up frustrated. His eyes glistened with unshed tears. At that moment, Theo understood the situation almost immediately.
kind of person..."
Harry hadn't realised that his mood changed drastically. His face scrunched up to something dangerous and he was grumbling. He could feel his magic erupt around him. Surprisingly enough, his mood change was clear to the whole classroom.
Blaise sat on the bed and opened the camera. He took out the photos and waved them a little. He took out the animated photo. He smirked.
"Uh okay haha." Draco chimed awkwardly when he didn't recieve an answer. "Do any of you have any plans today?"
Draco stared at the other boy. He narrowed his eyes. "Not everyone can miss lessons and get away with it. Not everyone is Harry Potter, The Boy who
Her eyes lit up when he had said 'Yet'. It told her that Draco had the intention of telling her at a later time and she had felt ecstatic because of it.
He put up silencing charms
"What do you mean, I don't understand."
"Blaise, don't..."
Draco turned his head slightly and mentally groaned at the additional voice.
Draco hopped out of bed and made his way towards the bathroom. He opened the door and started to take off his clothing. He walked in the shower, sighing in content as the warm water caressed his skin. He smiled a rare smile.
"Hey Zabini, do you have what I requested." A boy in the class asked,
When Draco got changed, he followed Blaise out of the dorms, slightly trailing behind. He kept his head up high and hands tightly tucked to the side of his torso.
"I woke up early so I took a walk around the school before we went to breakfast."
"No, tell me."
Looks like Harry's got a plan.
"Don't call me that." Draco rolled his eyes when he heard the girl next to him snort. She must of found his annoyance amusing. She didn't seem to plan on leaving his side until they reached the common room so he decided to walk with her. It was better than walking with Blaise anyway.
instead, Harry shrugged and looked away. He felt extremely frustrated and started to feel lightheaded for being upside down for too long.
"I'm sure they did. What about the pictures? I picked the ones that showed you off more. Do you like them?"
"It's 6:15AM." Draco answered. Harry nodded.
"You're dependent on me." Blaise smirked. "It's funny too, you know the horrible things I do to you and you still come crawling back to me."
"Hmm... I just wanted to hold you." Harry's voice muffled in Draco's hair.
The 2 boys left the common room.
Even without his glasses, Harry could see the blush tinted on Malfoy's skin even if the other boy's complexion was slightly pink from the hot shower.
"Tell them that I'm not available." She shouted at the floo'd voice.
"I...I didn't understand these feelings at first."
It was an understatement to say that the blond boy was equally suprised. It was safe to say that Malfoy was speechless as well as motionless.
(See the end of the chapter for
"I'm a fourth year student," was all the boy had said.
Dumbledore cleared his throat.
"I'm going to show you something but first, I need to tell you how I accessed this photo."
Blaise would go from selling pictures of Draco sleeping for 16 sickles, to selling pictures of Draco in the shower for 20 Galleons.
Draco walked towards his trunk. He silently thanked Merlin for his natural feather light footsteps. The last thing he wanted was for Blaise to wake up to him snooping around the dorms at almost 3 in the morning.
"Go ahead. Tell Dumbledore about what I'm doing."
Harry checked the time. His first lesson was almost starting. Transfiguration with Professor McGonagall.
is one of the many men who's purchased a picture." He heard his father whisper under his breath. Just loud enough for only he and his mother to hear. His mother leaned in and hit Lucius on the knee. Lucius did not flinch. He only scowled.
Blaise, who had been shaking him, did not look impressed. "We're going to miss breakfast because of you."
"I have to give it to Potter however. I find it easier now that you know about this business of mine. Before it was so damn hard to access any suggestive pictures. Now look at you. You're in an outfit I picked out for you."
"Hey Dray." A female voice greeted him. The nickname didn't effect Draco either. Instead he turned and smiled.
"I... I heard about your expulsion. I'm sorry that happened to you."
Theo, who's face had turned completely pink, nodded. He got up reluctantly and sped walked out of the room not turning back.
"And for our sake, we need tell you that you were a very pleasant student to teach." He heard professor Snape pitch in.
Silence
"I'd prefer you not scream. Draco is in the other room and I'd be utterly damaged if he found out that you came in when he wasn't
And today is my brother's one day since he passed so I tried to finish this
Harry couldn't stop himself when his own eyes wondered down and took in the other boy's appearance. He tried his hardest to meet the other's eyes but it was really difficult when one of the most good looking males in your year, if notâ€”the school, was standing right infront of you with not a single item of clothing.
"Harry don't get so obnoxious!"
"Here, let me help you with those."
"You fell asleep after class. I tried to wake you up but you seemed exhausted. I didn't think you were going to sleep for so long."
Blaise was stunned for a few seconds but that was all the time Harry needed.
Blaise had finished surprisingly quickly. He hadn't taken too much photos and Draco only had to try one outfit on. Draco was immensely grateful but suspicious. When Draco asked him why he hadn't taken much pictures, Blaise shrugged him off and said that business was running a little slow due to quiddich season. Older students were out in practice therefore not many requests were coming through. Draco's outer character didn't display any emotion. Only scepticism. However on the inside, he was exploding in a fit of joy. The more time away from Blaise and his business plans, the better.
"More...feminine?" Theo suggested.
"Have you had sex with him."
"Great. Well this is just
Worry must of been visible on his face because he heard a quite whiny voice speak to him. "Whats wrong with you, Dray?"
"What's that?" Blaise asked, He hadn't explained his confusion, he had only voiced his
Harry rubbed the back of his neck nervously.
"I know but you're more positive. Whatever made you this happy must of been a once in a lifetime event."
He had his invisibility cloak in his free hand but the idea of putting it on didn't occur to him at the moment. He just needed to rush back to his dorms.
What was that flash. There was a flicker of light when Draco was chained to the bed. It was the same flicker he saw when he went to collect his books on the floor. Could it be that...
I've been sick all year and the past few days haven't been any different but school is coming up
But not Blaise was gone. He was alone. Blaise wasn't here to help him. He was the tiny dragon among Basilisks.
It wasn't so bad, Draco tried to convince himself. Deep down, he could feel his heart painfully tear into two. He knew nothing else but being a wizard. Now he was convinced that he'd spend the rest of his life as a muggle. A squib just like Flitch.
Pansy cast a tempus charm. "Its 5pm exactly."
(Same surname in Wattpad)
"Its obvious. You're the whole reason why this situation is happening. You didn't have to show me the picture Blaise took of me but you did. You put yourself in danger."
Draco was clueless of it all, he had no idea that almost the whole school had seen him asleep or naked.
I didn't want to involve too much stuff in this chapter.
"Sure."
"For once, I wish I was."
The two had left the common room rather quickly. Draco hadn't even looked back at Blaise to see the frown on his face.
Draco only nodded. "I don't know how I can go on knowing that I have no privacy around Blaise."
"Calm down, Plankton. Maybe you can win the next game." His friend Blaise chuckled.
One thing Draco discovered was that Pansy was a gossip girl. It seemed that she knew everything about everyone in the school. She gladly shared some of her secrets with Draco. Through the conversation, Draco found out that a 2nd year Ravenclaw named Ashleigh Clarke, had a shrine in her trunk. Pictures scattered all across her room. All of Harry Potter. Draco couldn't help but feel his blood boil slightly.
"Yeah but if you report them, then they will spill the secret they were keeping in use of the blackmail." Ron argued. "You need their secrets as well to prevent that from happening."
Draco nodded. He jumped off the bed before Harry and went to put on his shoes. Once he pulled them on, he looked back at the taller Gryffindor.
"I'll pay you 150 Galleons if you can take a picture of Draco naked on his knees with his arms tied behind his back."
Why is Narcissa crying? why did the professor's moods change after Lucius jabbed at Draco's neck? ouch! Guess in the comments
"Don't ignore me git! I was talking to you."
"I think so. I didn't check."
Harry placed a hand next to Draco's head on the door. A small gesture that made Draco swoon ever so slightly.
"Well?" Draco demanded impatiently. "I hope you realise that you are taking up my Divination lesson."
Harry rolled his eyes. It was Malfoy and his friend Zabini. He always ended up bumping into them. You'd think that in a huge school like Hogwarts, you'd see the same person 3 or 4 times throuought the school year but it seemed that he only ever sees Malfoy.
By the end of Draco's rant, his face was red. He was frustrated. He had spoken his heart in a moderate volume so only few Slytherin's turned their head and focused their attention towards the blond.
Draco looked at her. "No I haven't."
Draco's flustured, Blaise is unbothered. Harry feels a new feeling in his heart. Draco sneaks out.
He finally made it back. Most of his classmates were still in classes which kept the common room mostly empty. People that skipped classes didn't seem like they wanted to strike up a conversation so they ignored the red faced saviour when he rushed up to his dorm.
"Thanks..." Draco mumbled.
"Hey, how was your day?"
Draco felt frightened. What was going on? Now that Draco thought about it, the room was tense. His mother was close to tears and his father wore a disgusted snarl. The Professors looked away with crestfallen faces.
"You don't
"And you did so by kidnapping him?"
Without a look back, Draco ran out off the hall, Harry only a few steps behind him.
Draco turned back. "I'm just tired."
"Mister Malfoy, may I see you in Professor Dumbledore's office, please?"
All three professors gave Narcissa a blank stare.
Draco turned to the prideful voice that seemed to echo off the walls of his head. "Blaise."
Draco realised that he had raised his hand when he was thinking. He bit his lip.
It didn't bother the green eyes boy however for he had a bigger problem.
The girl laughed. "Calm down! I was just trying to lighten the mood. Its funny when you get all flustered." She smiled brightly at him.
He left the table without saying a word following the two 4th year Slytherins.
"Look at me."
The smell of the potion Draco was brewing visibly calmed him.
"My... but father I..."
"I know." Draco answered quite harshly.
He got to the destination. He found a door and pushed it open. It only appeared as a broom closet.
been contacted by the ministry and this will not be taken lightly."
"I'm not wearing that."
Speaking of disappearance, Potter had disappeared too. At least that's what he thinks. Draco hadn't seen him and knowing Potter, he would of came to the Great Hall during dinner just to watch Draco. Was it coincidence? Perhaps. It didn't feel like a coincidence but who was he to tell. He didn't even hang out with the boy.
This deactivated the spell and released Harry with a heavy thud.
"Please promise me something Draco." His mother turned to him. She grabbed his hands and brought them to her chest. Tears still falling down her face. "Please. Learn your lesson well. It's not easy being expelled but
Sorry I've been off for a while
"What are you doing?" Draco scowled. Blaise did not answer.
A flash of appreciation flew on Harry's face before he kept his face neutral. He let go of Draco's face and leaned forward.
No... Draco didn't want that.
Harry pressed himself against Draco as if to show how
There was a few goans from other Gryffindor classmates. They stared quiet with their heads down the rest of the lesson.
Draco pushed at the boy's chest. "What do you take me for? I'm not some slut you can use. Let me go."
someone on the Slytherin table." Hermione looked over at Harry
Blaise suddenly entered the room a few minutes after Draco finished getting ready.
If only friendship actually worked that way.
Everyone knew who Blaise Zabini was. He was popular like Draco was. He was good looking but most importantly, he was Draco's best mate. Draco trusted Blaise with his secrets like no other. It was really difficult to get on Draco's good side and the only person who achieved it was indeed Blaise.
Stealthily, he scurried towards the door. He opened it slowly, flinching when it groaned unpleasantly. He slipped between the space when the door opened enough for him to walk through.
"Distracted by Potter, I assume? 5 points will be taken from Gryffindor." Snape left to assess the next group.
pictures of Draco, we could sell them for alot of money." Blaise finished enthusiasticly.
passing down an opportunity for 75 Galleons."
"Why would I find this funny?" Harry defended himself almost standing up in shock.
"I can't. He threatens to send the photos to my parents. They'll see how weak their son is. They'll see the photos. Not only that, he'll send the photos over to Skeeter and she'll make it the front page on the daily prophet. I'll be ridiculed for
Harry gave Draco a sad look but didn't urge him any further. "Is it bruised?"
A few seconds passed by. Blaise only stared as if be were searching for any clues of a lie but Draco kept his face neutral.
"That's good to know."
when he told him. Especially when his face contorted to something more sinister.
Theo nodded suspiciously. "And?"
"You took your time in there." Blaise lifted a curious brow.
Draco didn't believe what Blaise had said. Mainly because Blaise had a slight shiver in his voice. Maybe Blaise was cold. Whatever the reason for Blaise's mysterious stutter was, Draco didn't mention it.
With no room to talk, Draco walked towards the door. Before he left the room, he turned back to Harry. "If you aren't gonna find
"Darn it! Foiled again." Theo groaned in frustration when his last chess piece was knocked down.
By the end of lessons, almost all of the Slytherins knew about Blaise and Draco's fallout. To Draco, he had expected the others to shrug the situation off but it had become the centre of gossip, especially around the older male students.
Draco knows that Blaise didn't care. It wasn't as if Draco's feelings mattered to him anymore. He also knew that Draco wouldn't tell on him. He's got him wrapped around his finger.
Harry looked over at the sound of his name. Both Ron and Hermione were both waiting for him to say something.
"Oh, congratulations on the name then." Draco never stopped showing sass no situation.
"Third year...You knew about this in Third Year and you didn't tell me?" Draco's voice got louder each word.
From head to toe. Harry had done all be could to try and ignore Draco's appearance. He believed that it would of made him seem like a prat if he openly ogled the blond boy while trying to find a way to get him off blackmail.
Both Harry and Draco shot a deadly look towards the third boy.
He felt his face heat up. His body reacted oddly to the feeling of being stabbed by a knife but the situation Draco was in made it feel as if he were in a wet dream.
of bizarre moments throughout the period of his life. However, he did
The shaking stopped and Draco thought that whoever was trying to wake him up had given up.
Draco shook his head. "It's nothing serious. Just tired is all."
"So under normal circumstances, this will not be taken lightly." Dumbledore told him rather softly. "So I've requested Severus to contact your parents."
"I told you he wasn't gonna come." Theodore shook his head seemingly disappointed.
The older boy hummed. "You look great in lingere. That was probably the best 75 Galleons I've ever spent."
He smiled to himself. He didn't forget to place a Notice-Me-Not charm on himself before leaving the room just in case he walked into a professor.
"Because it's what you want. Think of the headlines if you decided to show everyone that photo.
Draco stayed quiet. His thoughts kept to himself.
They had left with the money Harry had needed.
"Come out, Potter. There's no use hiding when your presence is already known."
"He admitted everything to me because I kind of...Well... He was walking and i sort of..."
Blaise's face held suprise. Draco's unexpected reaction had caught him off guard.
Draco nodded, not listening to the professor talk anymore.
"What are you..." Draco barely whispered. Harry heard it over the deafening silence between them.
"Why can't you sell your own pictures? Why do you need to go full lengths just to invade my privacy?"
Draco groaned inwardly already annoyed. "Did he at least tell you where he was?"
Potter had promised that he wouldn't regret it, but to Draco that sounded like a load of bullocks.
Draco bit his lip containing a frustrated howl. Instead, he exhaled and turned to Harry. "Alright. Let me ask a more simple question.
"I'm afraid I'm not too sure about what Harry is talking about but I'll try my best to explain." Hermione turned so she was facing Ron. "Harry found out that Zabini was selling nudes of Draco so he decided to pay Zabini
Harry waved his hands and shook his head desperately. "No no, I don't think this is a joke. It's just..."
Draco had no intentions of showering. He had only entered the dorms to cool himself off. Blaise was amazing at souring Draco's mood.
She seemed way to interested in the argument he had with Blaise and wanted to find out more.
Draco thought to himself.
"A homework assignment?"
By the time Draco arrived back to Divination, it was only 10 minutes until the end. He didn't want to enter the classroom in fear of being questioned on what he was doing for 20 minutes nor did he want to leave. He didn't want Blaise questioning him either. So instead, he stood next to the classroom door and waited for the lesson to finish. If a professor were to walk by, he'd use a Notice Me Not charm.
He felt strong hands shake him gently.
Back on topic
person. Does he attend this school? Perhaps in your year?"
Draco's facial expression seemed to explain it all.
"You sure do love getting yourself into confusing situations."
"Beg? Mother... Am I getting... expelled?"
"You seem to love saving people."
"Invisibility cloak." Harry smirked when recognition shone on the shorter boy's features. "Clever, I know."
It had come as a great surprise that that both boys were at the same place, at the same time and doing the same thing.
He felt awful for knocking Nott out with Stupify. He felt guilty for tying him up and levitating him to the ROR with a Notice Me Not spell. And he felt stupid for binding him to a chair. It all happened so fast that he forgot to actually THINK for a second.
"We have Charms tomorrow. Surely absence for one day wouldn't make a difference." Blaise tried to reason.
"Draco, come here." Harry whispered, his arms wide and inviting. Draco didn't understand why Harry wanted to hug him at a time like this but regardless, he fell into the other's arms.
Draco was creeped out by Nott's behaviour but he was soon relieved when he was at the entrance.
"Okay. Be back before Charms."
Blaise remained stubborn, a frown permanently drawn on his face. Why was he so mad all of a sudden? He wasn't too upset about hearing about his former best mate getting expelled from school but a simple hickey sent him into a spiral?
"What's wrong, Malfoy? Don't have anything else to say?" Harry mocked.
Theo flopped onto the beds heavily. "There's no point. Draco hates me and I'm pretty sure he's purposely avoiding me. I've been such a creep to him"
Theo took the pictures nervously. His hands shook. He didn't know why he agreed to this but he was nervous on seeing the other side of the photos.
Chapters back to back ðŸ¥‚ðŸ¥³
Draco sincerely laughed out loud.
"Why aren't you in class?" Was the first question Draco asked. Blaise looked up and smiled.
Blaise shook his head and continued. "I've also found out that boys our age and older are willing to pay ridiculous amounts for
Surely Blaise didn't know
The smirk on his face immediately melted off. He grabbed his wand and pointed it towards the direction of the door that was now closed but not locked.
I hope?"
Bloody Hell Harry. You really screwed upðŸ˜­
Harry ran out of the library. He ran through the Hogwarts halls. He didn't know where he was going but he ran. He ran until he bumped into someone.
"Oh, aren't you two like a couple or something."
"Do I have a choice?"
The Headmaster was the first to recover from his state. He nodded frantically. "Of course."
Draco had realised that he hadn't changed out of the oversized hoodie. Instead, he had spent a whole hour swooning over a Gryffindor that he had forgot to clean the evidence that he had been outside of the dorms.
Draco was on his way to Divination. Breakfast was better than usual since someone else other than Blaise or Theo sat next to him. Parkinson was a decent woman. She had a good sense of humour. The only reason she'd annoy him is if she called him by that horrid nickname she finds so amusing. Draco can't find anything funny about the name 'Dray'.
He stared at the area leading to the entrance of the room. He glared at the slightly agape door that had been closed and locked moments before the noise occurred.
Harry felt the pain in his head worsen. He squeezed his eyes shut and searched for the handle leading to the bathroom. When he found it, he practically barged into the bathroom closing the door.
"I won't have this happen. And you aren't sending those photos with consent. He will face consequences."
Harry stepped back to look at the blond's outfit. "It's alright."
Draco grumbled out slightly. He pushed down his top and pulled up his jeans but he didn't button them.
"Hey, do you want to partner up?" Draco looked towards the sound of the voice. Potter.
"Let's play truth or dare again."
Harry knew that it was time to find out what Zabini was doing.
Draco snapped out of his thoughts and looked at his partner.
School really did get into my breaks
"Is everything alright there, Mr Potter?"
to eat much. Don't want to mess up your figure. I care about you." Blaise smiled. Draco grimaced.
The conversation seemed to start to steer in a different direction so Harry continued the original conversation. "I managed to stun him temporarily. I came into the bathroom and..."
Luckily Draco's potion barely reached the colour of passing before he was told to stop.
The blond took his wand from under the pillow and cast a Tempus charm.
Harry closed the doors to the Great Hall and Draco breathing quickened.
He paused his walking suddenly when he heard a second pair of louder footsteps that he didn't recognise as his own. Assuming the worst, he picked up his pace. He walked towards the nearest classroom, opened the door and slammed it shut rather loudly.
Harry screwed his eyes shut.
Harry's eyes glistened in the moonlight and the way the Gryffindor's face displayed an awestruck impression, Draco's eyes shone also.
"That light. Like someone took a picture."
gonna do? Cry to your golden group?"
"I didn't understand the part from
Draco came out of the bathroom 20 minutes after Harry did. He felt like a statue. He simply refused to move until he was certain Potter, or any other unknown visitors, had left the dorm rooms leaving only him and Blaise. He felt both flustered and furious at both Potter and Blaise. He left the dorms for only a few minutes to shower and Potter had managed to violate his privacy. Why wasn't Blaise there to stop him? Why was Potter in the dorm rooms anyway? What happened in the dorms while Draco took a shower?
"Zabini." She nodded to the other politely.
it was.
Harry ignored the remark.
Theo turned away awkwardly. He shifted the weight on his feet each minute that passed by.
"Pictures of me doing what?"
"Can we speak later?"
Draco is suspicious
Harry finally released the other boy. His face went slightly red when he glanced at the blond's neck.
Draco's eyes widened comically. Why was he blushing? He had nothing to be blushing about. It couldn't be because of Potter. Could it?
When he looks at her however, Draco is reminded of a pug in some way. A small dog. Draco didn't think it was an insult persay. He just thought that the girl made him think of a muggle dog breed.
Why was he chained to the bed. Did Blaise want to embarress him? Make him feel small? Surely not. Blaise was Draco's friend and friends don't humiliate eachother.
Blaise smirked. "I'm gonna have to charge you for that."
"Plankton? Who's that?" Theo asked.
Harry dug his hand into his boxers bringing his cock out. Draco did not expect what he saw. Did no one know that their Golden Boy, Harry Potter was packing a 10 inch dick? How did he hide it. Surely there would be admirers trying to get into his pants.
The bed was king sized. It looked big enough to fit six 4th years.
Silence once again. This time it was more uncomfortable. Surely it would of been. Imagine telling your enemy that their only best friend was selling pictures of them to other students. Now imagine you're Harry Potter telling Draco Malfoy in the same situation.
The sudden possessiveness from the taller boy caught Draco off guard. He didn't understand why the dark haired boy felt as if it was his top priority to keep Draco safe. It wasn't as if they were friends.

Not like Draco cared. He smiled at the thought of not having to worry about being violated anymore.
Draco had never expected to have his first kiss with Harry. He hadn't even knew that he had expressed interest at all.
He was pushed onto the desk behind him, knocking down everything on it. He had no time to move before he felt Harry's weight pushing him down keeping him still.
is desperate enough to spend a shit tonne of money just to get one picture to wank off on."
"Blaise what's going on?" A muffled voice came from the other room. Harry assumed it was the bathroom.
However from this angle, Draco could see the other more clearly. He had realised that Harry was not wearing his signature spectacles
Her eyes widened and her hand flew on her mouth as she gasped in shock.
"If there has been a misconception, it's not me you should be talking to." Pansy frowned and pointed behind the blond boy.
