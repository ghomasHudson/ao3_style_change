Kreacher takes one of the vials from my palm, there's a soft pop. "Here, Master." Cold glass presses against my lips.

Silence falls.

Finally, he turned to me and reached through the Shield to grab at my sleeve. "You'd better come with

I am alone in the centre. My breath is shallow, the broom in my hand is my only support, and my heart threatens to choke me.
Straddling him, I sit up. "Do you find me handsome?"
"My offer still stands."
"Look..."
"But the party has barely begun!" I insist.
My heart falls.

He laughs.
"And so did you," I said.
It's been a week since Pomfrey released me. Good as new.

My heart is thudding.

I need fresh air... or something.
I read over his shoulder.
"No… Ah-hh… really?" I put my hand over his. "Do you think I'm good-looking?"
"Thank you, My Lord."
"Go on."
I want to say.
I don't see his face, and I am afraid to look; I don't know what I may find there. He is cradling me against his chest, his steady heartbeat under my ear, and the only thing I know, is that
Malfoy is distant and holds himself stiffly. He's freaking out, I decide.
"Harry Potter is dead!" The Dark Lord spreads his hands wide, as though he wants to hug us all.
"I will."
"I want to get out of here. Ron, get me the fuck out of here!"
You peered across the room at the piece of jewellery dangling from his fingers as he demonstrated it to a customer.
Silence please, Mr. Finnigan," he says at Seamus's whooping. "Each pair of students is to sign up for the year's advanced potions project, which must be presented in June, as one of the

"Are you all right, Harry?" Hermione says, scribbling in her Arithmancy homework.
You are going to get yourself killed."
"I see," Mother says when I finish, "you were protecting your friend."
I don't know, but...
"It's… magnificent," he says quietly, "I can't believe you could cast it when you were thirteen."
This is what he meant by me breaking our friendship.
His hands are on me again as he tugs it down over my head. “I always knew you were crazy.”
I crawl back over him until our faces meet. His outline is blurred in the yellow glow of the lamp. I am dying to know the look on his face, the way he looks at me now.
"It was never a joke, Potter,
"The house likes you, you know?" He says. "More than me."
"To let Death Eaters into Hogwarts," he says, staring at the ceiling.
"That's when I realised," he continues, unaware of my inner turmoil, "that if I indulged in it for another moment, I would have never left her, would have never had the courage to walk away. That she could have persuaded me to take her with me, and I couldn’t risk her life and safety."
He is staring at me, his pupils blown wide. He'll probably kill me. There's no other way to do it; no other way to make him
"To humiliate me, hurt me, cause me pain?" he continues.
That very night he brings a sample to my room.
"Yeah… I just…" I tilt for a moment, leaning into him for support. The Firewhisky has gotten to me, I realise it only now. "I need a… where's Malfoy?"

I turn around and start walking. By now, I manage without my hands in front of me. I'm able to sense when there's anything in my way and stop before bumping into it. There's nothing and no one there as I walk through the open double door of the Great Hall.
Slowly, I release my hold on the flow, slowing it down, letting it go, until with one last final spark it dissolves. I know it's not entirely gone, it hasn't fully disappeared. I feel its luminous presence in my core. The spark is there. Any time I can light it back. Any time.
understand that we should take responsibility for our actions, even unintentional ones. Forgive me, I am not able to release you from this bond. It dissolves as soon as you fulfill your debt.
I feel a jolt of annoyance and something else, visions of Malfoy and Parkinson fresh in my mind. Malfoy is going to have a snogging session again; seems like his girlfriend doesn't mind. It irritates me for some reason.
"No!" Her voice is high and clear. "It's
"Are you Noir?"
I am lost.
"Yes."
"Don't be stupid," you said on your way along the Diagon Alley.
In front of my bewildered friends. In front of the entire Hogwarts. In front of the whole world.
I cannot make out his face, but I see him standing by the other side of the bed. He raises his palms.
I rip the picture in two and stare into the fire between my hands, where the photo-you and the photo-me are nestled so far from each other.
"Disgustingly drunk," the mirror confirms.
In the dead of night
It sounds weak, unconvincing, as though I'm making it up. I myself would never believe it. Panic grips me.
Staring at the huge Christmas tree in the corner, I lean against the wall, music from the open door of the Great Hall beckoning back, inviting me in. To come back and fucking
"What?.. what do you want?" This is surreal. You sit up.
"What?" He falls back with a laugh. "You're ridiculous. No, it's not."
Instantly, I feel a rush of magic flooding me, filling my whole being to the brim, so much that I might burst. It's flowing through my blood with every heartbeat, pulsing in my fingertips, overwhelming all my senses, making me lightheaded; making me realise how empty, how
His back arching, Weasley thrashes on the ground, his head lolling back in the heap of the autumn leaves. The inhuman sounds filling the air come from his throat, and his arm...
up." There's something in his voice - blank and hollow - something that isn't Potter.
"Oh, you can't stand it, can you?" I say viciously. "Blind I'm not good enough, yeah?"
"Well… potions?"
“What for?”
I wasn't sure if I was supposed to kiss him. I mean, I wanted to, but maybe it would've been over the top?
Feeble footsteps disturb the silence as Longbottom limps forward.
You clasp your hands in front of you and close your eyes, bowing your head low. You had learned quickly that this posture is the best for such occasions.
"Jealous?" Hearing him admitting it felt so satisfying, exhilarating, I wanted to know more, to know everything, to put the pieces together and figure out what my own thoughts were at the time, what my fears were, to find out he felt the same. "Go on…"
"He may not come at all," I say for the hundredth time, walking beside Potter along the street, "you know my Father."
house, Potter. I'm not in the position to... What I'm trying to say, is: I've just had an idea of little improvements - structural and aesthetic ones - which may..." I stop, trying to find the way to put it so that the house won't go bonkers again.
To feel me inside.
What a ridiculous name. Though
to those black shiny brogues, one of which is tapping the floor to the beat of the music...  My eyes go back up, stumbling over that belt buckle (seriously, fuck that thing - the silvery-dull metallic sheen against the black...)
However, the Dark Lord doesn't strike. "Well, Neville, I am sure we'd all be fascinated to hear what you have to say."
, I must. To right my mistakes, to apologise. To let him know that I haven't abandoned him.
All the pressure of these past few weeks is back again; all the humiliation and helplessness Zabini evoked has returned.
I'd rather have him hit me. Anything but…
He grins. "Yes."
“Fuck you!” you said to the room and bent down to gather the heap of his clothes.
"Nothing happened, it's just…"
... And when you whisper:
fHis quick footsteps crunch around me. Tugging my gloves off, I quickly make a snowball and hurl it where I think he stands.
"Harry? Where are you going?" Hermione tugs at my sleeve.
“Harry?”
Aunt Bella cackles.
"Malfoy."
, guilt whispers in my mind.
Yeah, that's how things are. I'm not even sad about it or anything. Right after the war, even when I still could see, I was never able to do that again. Patronus just wouldn't come. The most I could manage were wisps of silver mist from my wand.
in my room, rather than sit here alone in the dark. I switch the lamp on. No way will I be able to sleep now. I get out of bed.
She said nothing, just shook her head and made a move to leave.
"But what?" He turns his head to look at me.
I turn towards the sound of his voice. Potter steps out from behind a tree. I turn away, looking over the lake. The fucker has found me
I don't want him to leave just yet because, for the first time in who knows how long, I've had a conversation with someone that wasn't all about my
You’d rather die than tell anyone what had really happened.
What was I thinking?
I think,
"You tried to protect him, Draco, why? Because he's not an enemy - is that it? That's when I realised all your talk of Vernon Dudley was a lie."
"It's just... it's so cold and lonely, you know..." He whispers. "I'm scared and..."
"No, why--"
Things got fucked up, we fought, we made up. But that's not what I mean.
I bring it to my lips and take a sip. It’s strong, it burns, it’s good. I take another one.
"Yes." I hang the apron on the hook. "I love you. Now let's go home. Dinner's waiting."
You measure him up and down, trying to imagine a woman who'd be willing to go to bed with him.
I don’t belong. I am not one of them.
"Come on, what do you mean?"
And scream
We move down the steps.
"Why would you keep doing nothing, Potter?" He asked me once. "When you could learn as well as anyone."
“Fuck you!” You growled.
I feel wild, crazy and my face is burning, I can't bring myself to look at him.
"Silence!" I wave my hand at them.
"Sit down, Potty," Parkinson says, "we've been waiting for you."
voice.
I jump away from Malfoy.
"It's your business, Harry, and I kind of don't want to make it about me... but..." He turned to face me fully. "Damn, Harry, did you actually think I'd turn you down or laugh or what, if you told me yourself?"
Relief washes over me, suddenly taking all the tension away. I exhale. It feels so good, just to sit here by the fire, eat my sandwich and stop fretting, if only a little.
"But they say, a lot of Muggles, having undergone their treatment, come out fully changed. Your Father and I see no reason they won't be able to fix a wizard. It will be alright, dear. We will visit."
There's a
Laughter crinkled in the corners, ready to be unleashed. You never smiled like that. Only then did I realise that his clear eyes were nothing like yours. Bright blue, where yours were quicksilver, his open steady gaze so unlike your liquid, evasive one.
"You're brewing your
I release my grip to cradle his face in my palms, to lean back and look at him, to press my lips to his chin and his eyes and forehead. The feeling of his hands sliding up my back, their reassuring pressure fill me with joy. Enchanted snowflakes are catching in his eyelashes, and there above his shoulder I see a glimpse of Mistletoe. We don't need it.
He didn’t mean it like that; I believe he didn’t mean to hurt me. He did.
To visit her.
I look over my shoulder. The huge thing lies where Weasley has dropped it.
" Draco touches your fingers. "It reminds me of you.”
Everything stops.
"Thanks." I close my palm around the vial.
"I... yes. Yes, you’re right."
“Leave it, Ron.” I throw over my shoulder and speed up the staircase, sliding my palm over the polished wood of the bannisters.
His skin is smooth. He is so beautiful.
The murmur of voices is buzzing around the room. I crane my neck and see that there are a lot of people here. Every bed in the room is occupied. There are visitors here and there; house-elves are helping Pomfrey tend to the patients.
"Draco! No!" I hear somewhere from my left. Harry's voice, but it's wane and bleak and can't compare to... The shape shifts and there are two figures before me where there has just stood one. Harry snakes his arms around him and pulls him close, cups his face and kisses him... Kisses the one that is...
"So now you must kill me along with the Horcrux so that your secret dies with me." I wiggle my eyebrows at Weasley.
"Here they are." I put them on my nose.

"No." Potter shakes his head. "Not for the first time, of course... but she
"Yes. How did you come up with it? It feels very… I don't know… Me? If it makes any sense."
Potter fills his glass and puts the bottle down onto the floor. He raises his glass briefly, not in a toast, but as though in an afterthought, then throws his head back and swallows the contents in one go.
"Draco?" He hurries forward and almost stumbles, and Mother has to steady him by the arm.
"You are so big."
Malfoy, however, is snooping around my room. I don't particularly mind. Though I cannot discern his shape, now my eyes are aware of the warm golden glow of lamps and fireplace, and it’s more than nothing. Better, really.
How am I right now, seeing him for the first time in a month? I am weak with...
“Thanks,” I say, and stuff one into my mouth, chewing angrily.
Waking up in the morning, I realise that I've slept with my clothes on. Black trousers and a white shirt that I chose as my ‘LOVE IN ACTION’ 'uniform' to wear at all times. It strikes me that
Since then, everything had changed.
harm him, he belongs to the Dark Lord!"
I turn to look as she waves her wand, casting something that makes Malfoy cry out in pain, as his bones align with a loud sickening sound.
Granger shakes her head and storms off to kneel beside Weasley.
“To let Death Eaters into Hogwarts," he repeats.
"Stinging hex, I see." Mother studies Harry's face. "It will wear off soon enough."
"Hi!" Potter waves at me over Kreacher's head. "Come in!"
She's very nice, and you like her a lot; as a friend. Why is it necessary to fake this attraction of a different kind between woman and man? The one that will never be there. But you know that she's trying hard, too, and you want to help her.
Yes, they would. Anything on the platter for the fucking Saviour.
"The diadem!" He shouts. "I've lost the diadem!"
as though we’ve just met - a bunch of strangers - trying to find common ground. And failing.
"He said, as soon as I make sure it worked properly, I should let him know and wait for his command. Here." Malfoy reaches into the front pocket of his shirt, retrieving a coin - an ordinary gold galleon. "I touched it with a spell, and it grew hot, and so did the one he kept so that he'd know I was ready. I had to go to the Room of Requirement and wait for his command. Yesterday morning, I sent him a message and waited. The coin grew hot only in the evening, so I went to

"Why the hell do you think everything is about
not what I'm here for.
were able to do such things to their children. What I witnessed there...
"Yeah." He grins at me. "
Suddenly hot all over, I nod and tug my undershirt off. There’s not much to say, really. We’re going to wash. Together. With Malfoy. That’s all. No big deal. I’m not cold anymore, not nearly, and it seems like I’m shaking because of the entirely new reason. I’m not going to tell him. There’s nothing to tell, I haven’t even told it to myself. My boots are off, my joggers, I proceed undressing, until only my boxers are left on.
Malfoy or not, the dream made me so aroused that I come, having barely begun. My hand messy, I haven’t even stopped shuddering or managed to catch my breath, when there’s a knock on the door.
"Potter, what the hell?!" Malfoy springs on his feet, trying to wrench my hands away from Zabini's neck. "Get off him!"
What the hell was that?
I wrench against my binds and stumble forward, stepping on the hem of the Cloak, because the binds are no longer there. I fall forward, landing painfully on my outstretched palms. I curse and tug the Cloak off and scramble on my knees, shuffling across the floor to Malfoy.
"Moral Inventory," Mr. Vice says, "meet our new friend. Henry, do please come forward."
"No, it's not," he replies quietly.
"So you haven't."
first, I guess.
"Touch me."
He says, not opening his eyes, "wanking someone here?"
"How?" Granger asks, her voice steely.
At first, I didn't leave the bed, though sleep wouldn't come. I lay, staring at the patch of bright blue skies outside of the window; as it faded into white and darkened to grey and deepened into black, dotted with stars, then paled into white, and gained blue again, and brightened, and repeated, repeated, repeated.
"Come in!"
I expect to find Malfoy in his bed, but no. He is moving across the room. I mean, how long does it take to cross this room from the window to the bed? I've never thought of it, not really. Not long, I suppose. But Malfoy is
"Where are you going?"
I barely manage to take a sip, when people roar - with excitement and laughter and dismay.
Not waiting for Malfoy's return, I knock on Ron's door. There's Seamus and Dean and Neville, too. We hang out for the entire afternoon. Malfoy doesn't show up at lunch. When it's time to go to dinner, I avoid my room.  Out of spite, I want to be
The cupboard snaps shut.
I look down to where we are both hard. I don't know where this is going, or how it may end up, but my body's impatient to find out. I step closer, erasing all the remaining space between us.
"I figured." I sheathe my wand inside my sleeve.
The beat of your magic in the air swirls up in a whirlwind of pieces of your shattered heart. Your pain is beating through your blood in a rush of violence.
Now, this is interesting.
It's fucking
“It’s okay, guys. I’m perfectly fine in the back.”
Once out of the Great Hall, I speed up the staircase, breaking into the run.
You sipped the wine and didn't meet his eyes.
Malfoy's eyes are closed, grimace of pain distorting his features.
"You found the sword, you are the one to kill the
Potter gives me a long look. "It's not like I'm
The sound echoes in the air; it vibrates as though through the water, muffled and loud at once.
"You don't look gay."
I glance at Potter.
"Now?" I ask with my chin propped on the book on the desk. "I can't do it right now. Or ever."
"You're leaving soon," I turn to him.
I pull the blanket up to cover my chest. "I was going against injustice. That's all. You didn't deserve Azkaban like your parents did. I would've done it for anyone." I don't know if it's entirely true, but saying it to his face feels satisfying. "There's no need to thank me as though it were personal."
"I didn't, My Lord."
In case you hadn't noticed, it's an ancient
"Ron!" Granger raises her voice.
"No physical contact between the patients of the same sex is allowed, with the exception of the briefest of handshakes."
I reach out over Harry's shoulder and close the book to take a look at the front cover. It's an ancient copy of

I knew it all along.
"Unhand me, Potter!" You raised your voice over the engine, sending the gravel flying from under the tyres.
"Potter!" I stride into the hall.
I suddenly don't want to play either.
Where the fuck was Pomfrey every time he came? I suspected she was aware of his visits, allowing the hero to do the fucking
I look at his back and hunched shoulders, at his blond hair, golden in the lamplight. Uneasiness lodges in my chest, ties my stomach in knots. He's right, it's madness, and chances are high that we won't return.
"But what if she says no?" Ron squinted at the sun, rubbing his palm over the back of his neck. “What if a life with me is not what she wants?”
"You know," I say, "once I was doing this right here." I firm my grip, watching as the swollen head of his cock disappears into my fist to emerge again and repeat. "In this very stall, imagining you doing it."
How much more? Sharp pain stings my thigh and I cry out, staring at the leg of my trousers that soaks bloody above the knee. I stumble.
"Her friends." I turned to him and grinned.
"Mate." Ron, puts his arm around my shoulders, as though steadying me for what is to come, while Hermione puts the open newspaper in front of me, where my eye catches rows and rows of steady lines in the dear familiar spiky handwriting:
"... your voice down."
"Harry?"
"Fuck..." Is all I am able to utter.
crossed my mind. You had a girlfriend."
- you mean.
"I think," I begin, making Aunt Bella look away from Harry and turn to me, "Potter may be even dead by now, but the Order conceals it."
"He does."
"Let's lead your Father to his bedroom, dear," Mother said, "first he needs a rest, and then we will talk to our hearts' content."
"Draco!" A shout from above makes me look up. Harry is dashing right at me on a broom, Granger and Weasley, each on their brooms, are behind him.
"Old man..." Bellatrix Lestrange is behind Malfoy. "The old man has lived too long. Do it, boy. You have to
Slowly, we walk towards each other, meeting in the middle.
"The coin." I show him my open palm. "It must have been a portkey."
I eyed students over the top of the cauldron. No one looked suspicious. Malfoy at the far end of the classroom was having a fit or something. He was cutting, stirring, pouring, making notes, reading instructions from the textbook hovering in the air in front of him, and talking to Parkinson - all at the same time. He looked like he was having an epiphany about the potion-making, transmitting it to life.
Merlin. Why was it so awkward?
I haven't seen Malfoy almost for a week. He skips classes, doesn't attend meals. Parkinson throws me murderous glances every time she sees me.
... I... I didn't..."
It's not really a 'ponytail', more like a little bun, my hair, though grown longish, is still too short to be properly tied. A few strands escape and fall on my face.
, after what he'd done...
I shrug, turning my face up to him. I morbidly want to know what his face looks like right now. Is it smiling? Is it dreamy? Is he satisfied, thrilled, excited?
Spring has come.
"Is it you?"
We stop, and he reaches into the front pocket of his trousers, retrieving a small piece of cloth. He unfolds it, and unfolds it, and unfolds it until the liquid fabric slithers through his fingers in rich transparent folds.
"But what does the sign mean?" Granger asks. "The Deathly Hallows are not mentioned anywhere in the book."
"So?" Potter leans against the back of the sofa.
"I…" Pushing into my chest, he sits up. "I don't know…"
When it suddenly hits me: nausea rushes up so swiftly, that I barely have time to catch up with what's going on.
Strangely aroused and disgusted at the same time, I silently step back, intending to retreat to the balcony and wait it out until they are done, when the lights in the room flare on.
"It's just..." I stand up. "Give me a sec."
. Until eight o’clock tomorrow morning, I will await your reply." Father stands up. "It has been a pleasure,
"What?" He laughs.
"What do you want, Draco?" Father snaps. "Why have you invited me here?"
"And you have never heard of me." He laughed, releasing my hand.
Weasley clings to him.
"Why are you refusing to tell him the truth?! What had happened?"
"I have to leave now... for the Ministry... for work. You may... you know..." He gestures with his hand. "Eat... take a bath... and such. If you need anything, ask Kreacher." He scratches his nose. "I mean, if you want... anyway, see you in the evening." He grabs a handful of Floo Powder from the jar on the mantle.
"Expelliarmus!" The other replies.
I suddenly remember that I'm still in the water, covered with goosebumps all over, only in my pants and hiding my forearm.
"That may bring out the beauty of this place, and help it get rid of the old stuff that no longer serves it right." I glare at Potter, lest he blurt something stupid again.
A year ago.
. I am talentless at such things, so... it's more magical to me than the actual magic is."
"My Lord." I bow my head.
"Do you want me?" She asks, daring me to reply.
Weasley shrugged her hands off and flicked his wand, sending a red flash of light in my direction, when the shimmering shield of Protego flared up in front of me. Potter stepped in front of Weasley with his face livid, reached out and wrenched at the chain. Weasley cried out in pain when it cut into his neck. Potter wrenched again, and again until it snapped leaving angry red bruises on Weasley’s skin. Potter pointed his wand at the chain, mended it with a spell and put the locket around his own neck.
Indulge me and take my hand
“Who’s gonna play?” Seamus asks.
"No! It bloody will
A silent flash of green light erupts from his palm and sends Malfoy reeling. He hits the floor and stills, motionless, his hand still gripping his wand. From here I see his eyes - huge in shock - staring at the ceiling.
I don't need him to escort me to my room. I don't
in his face but the glasses. The glasses are the same. The fucking glasses.
I think again. Whoever it is, I'm not in the mood. By 'whoever' I mean Ron, of course.
That would be one of those moments - I'd think, drifting into sleep in your arms - one of those rare glimpses that would become so precious to me; one of
The living-room door will creak on its hinges, letting me inside like a wary host.
"Work." Accepting the glass, he made a face at you from the sofa. "I can't really talk about it. If you must know, I didn’t leave the office all day long." He smiled up at you, fair eyes hiding amusement behind his quicksilver smirk. "Come here." He walked his fingers up your knee.
My heart thudding, I shrugged the bird off, and it soared out of the open window.
. I'd thought I'd paid enough for that in ‘LOVE IN ACTION.'
When Potter suddenly gets on his feet, I start. He enters the cave and stops in front of me. I prop myself on my elbows and watch as he kicks off his boots and pulls his sweater and T-shirt over his head. They drop on the floor.
"Why not? You can." Potter turns to me. "You can't go with us and... this
All in black as always, Severus steps out of the crowd and bows. "My Lord."
"This is some fucked up shit," Henry Ponder thought, but said nothing, listening to the Rules of ‘LOVE IN ACTION' that were being read aloud by the patients in turns.
My heart gives a thud.
I look at the bottle.
I draw a vertical line. "The Elder Wand."
I take a sip from the glass again and relish the burn sliding down my throat, spreading warmth to my fingertips... Yeah…
"Listen,
"I trust you with my life, my boy." Dumbledore's voice is as soft as ever, but his eyes are piercing - the sharpest, clearest blue. "It is not a matter of trust, but your safety. To protect you from each other I must divide you."
I'm not sure what I'm asking, what exactly.
He doesn't finish, grabbing his mug and heading to the sink.
Slowly I approach the entrance to the cave.
Gin had been away for the audition yesterday. Tryouts for the Holyhead Harpies Chaser position.
"What?"
"What?
“Knew what?”
I nod. I don't know how I am to survive what is to come.
"Yeah..." His breath uneven, he grinds against me. "Like that." He bucks his hips up and thrusts into my fist.
"Explain yourself!"
"She put a spell on the bottle!"
I wrench the Common Room door open, heading straight to the sofa to grab the front of Zabini's shirt. I press my knee into his stomach and his eyes go wide.
Weasley adds, "and it's not like I'm bigoted or anything, but still..."
In fact, there are neither four of us in the house, nor

"Come on." You gripped the stone parapet and, to my astonishment, jumped over it, landing on the gravel path beneath.
A menace indeed. You could say that about your engagement with Pansy.
"Listen," you'd say with your eyes closed as you sway to the music, "isn't that beautiful?" Melody spilling from your fingertips.
"Pretend-dating?"
"You don't know me, Potter. I’m worse."
"But I can't live in your house like this forever!" I point at my wrist.
“Harry, if you had ever stolen a kiss from someone… how would you give it back?” [3]
, towards him is surprising. The last time I saw him was during his trials. Gaunt, grey in the face, he avoided my eyes altogether after the one shocked glance he shot me when I rose from my seat to speak in his defence. I hardly hated him anymore, but he still was one of the few who could spark a reaction - something, anything, a knee-jerk response. I disliked, despised him and pitied him, but at the same time, I couldn’t let him be thrown into Azkaban - he didn’t deserve it. The odd mix of things he made me feel annoyed me, morbidly kept my attention, made me scan the newspapers for any scraps of information about him. Back then, he still was
"Are you finished, Ron?"
"It was supposed to be finished by then, but something had gone awry. It's ready now."
"Malfoy." Someone tugs at my sleeve. "Come on, get up." Granger urges me to get to my feet. I obey.
He props his back against the cave wall and lets me snuggle between his thighs, using his chest for support. We sit in silence, and I let myself be coddled and held. I needed it so badly for so long.
"No."
That Patronus felt like all I was capable of. The memory I had chosen was strong but not exactly happy. The rush, the shock, the sense of falling into the void; he was my anchor and nothing else existed.
I catch her in my arms.
He took it. "See you. Maybe. Sometimes?"
"Come on! We're gonna bring him to the Dark Lord."
"Pass me my glasses," I say, "please?"
You knew this hand.
He's really divine
"Rape..." You forced out. "Is a lie."
An hour into the party, I’m enjoying myself and can’t be bothered to think of Astoria sodding Greengrass or what she’s doing here. I have no idea where she is at the moment, and it suits me just fine.
"What
I won't talk about it. Least of all with you."
"It's... nothing...it's just a..." He looks down. "Nothing needs to happen." His voice is a bit unsteady. "Do whatever you want... or you may do nothing at all."
I walk and squint at their faces. My glasses are dirty, but I see enough to know that I can't find what I'm looking for. I stop on the spot and turn around, peering into the crowd. Around, around, around. My head swims. I don't see...
Looking at his bitter face, I realised he was offended. Offended by my lack of trust.
"What was that with Malfoy?" Ron asks as we head down the corridor.
"Oh, look," Hermione says, "remember you asked me about Astoria Greengrass, Harry?"
I shake my head, hell if I know what I meant.
"Fuck." Catching my breath, I throw my head back against the wall.
It's dark, and I'm in my bed, fully dressed, even with my boots on. I feel disgusting, and I have a boner, a huge boner from the dream about Malfoy-Noir.
"I see," she says faintly. "I see," she repeats, and says no more.
"Go on."
"It was… it was fucking terrifying," I reply, "but brilliant, too. I never thought... how different would it feel if I tried to fly with my eyes closed."
He leans back, his gaze delirious, and smiles at me.
"Do I know this person?" I try a smile.
His eyes lowered, Weasley stands to the side, a huge sword dangling from his hand.
"So that's what you were doing there." I'm so tired, so very tired.
I step back to look at him, giving myself a moment to comprehend
I leave without looking at Malfoy.
Through the open door, I see the retreating backs of the trio hurrying up the main staircase. I follow McGonagall out of the Great Hall and down to the staircase to the dungeons.
"I Apparated you out of that batshit crazy place." Potter crosses his arms. "At Parkinson's request. Your mother helped me to track you down."
Granger had suggested it. "The reporters cannot harass you there," she had said.
Not now.
"No... that was..." He waves his hand, searching for a word. "Competitiveness. To prove that Slytherins are able to last longer than any other House."
"I am broken but not worthless, God loves me!" You repeat dutifully, joining the chorus.
She sounds wrong.
You see nothing wrong with his jokes!" I raise my voice. "Who the hell has friends like that, if not one of them?!"
“Yeah, give me a sec.” He drops my hand, and his footsteps retreat, only to turn back in a moment. “Here.” He presses the gloves into my palm.
"What happened?" I finally realise that we are on the balcony of the Astronomy Tower.
"Are you going to wear it?" His arm snakes around my waist.
Can't believe Ron didn't come to apologise first thing in the morning; can't believe it's Malfoy again, after everything he had told me; can't believe he opened my door just like that, what about my wards? What the fuck?
"I love you, Harry." She pulls me into a hug. "You never needed to worry about it."
"What?!" My laugh isn't even pretend.
After what Theo did to me, it doesn't matter that I'm gay, it doesn't mean anything. Because it’s
"Hi, Harry." Astoria smiles and looks down at our laced fingers. "Glad to see you. Glad to know you're all right. Draco wrote to me about  it."
"Dragons are supposed to fly, why is it just walking around me?"
The bathroom door creaks open, I turn my head. He is tall and pale, and thin. Naked. His hair falls in his eyes. I stare. At his limp cock and coarse darker hair around it. At his thin stomach, at the Dark Mark on his forearm.
Dumbledore's wand flies out of his grip and clatters against the floor.
I shrug. It's a hell of a lot to explain, and I'm not going to.
"The project?" I offer, without a clue what this is all about.
"I think..." I stand up ...
"What do you call it?" I say through my T-shirt over my head. "Dating? Relationship? A boyfriend-girlfriend thing?" I stick my head through the collar and put my arms through the sleeves.
"Harry!" Hermione is by my side as soon as we enter.
He mirrors my position at the opposite end of the sofa. We sit for a while, staring into the fireplace. Things are getting pretty awkward again; we are going to end up back where we'd started, before we’ve even begun.
So what?
"... mistaken anyway."
"Malfoy."
What must he think, without a word from me for the entire week?
All I ever cared for was -
Slowly, I head along the long tables pushed against the walls. People are sitting, lying everywhere. Tending to their wounds, eating, staring into space. I see Seamus take a swig from the bottle of Firewhisky and hand it to Dean.
"Fuck!" Zabini cries out, clutching at his nose.
"Well, I… do? You said I'm big."
"On how it feels. Sometimes it's six, sometimes seven. It's usually between four and eight."
No, Malfoy's dead. Dumbledore killed him, I saw it in Snape's mind, I...
The four of us look around. The air shifts and shimmers, and there is a sudden loud
She doesn't reply. She just grabs her things from the floor and angrily puts them on.
"For fuck's sake." Your face was stony, a red spot blossoming on your cheekbone.
"You're kidding," he laughs.
"What?" Potter springs to his feet.
"Mr. Potter!" A man shouts. "A few words on the case of the Malfoy Heir!"
"I think..." He brushed away a strand of hair from my face. "You could try to wear it tied."                                                                                                                 I liked the idea. It was more than just hair, it was... something
I don't know, he never told me, but I am sure it was his plan all along. What else?
We pick up right where we've left off - before the Mistletoe business, before my jealous tantrum and our fight.
"And what task did you have to perform for You-Know-Who? He said you succeeded."
— Ouch! Wouldn't it be better if you didn't?
I get to my feet.
— I've never thought of that.
Pushing myself off the bed, I stand up and slowly head in the direction of the bathroom with my hands outstretched.
for fuck's sake, even Hermione snapped.
~ I could have handed you to Voldemort instead.

My knees go weak. This cannot be happening.
badges. This shouldn't affect me as much as it does. It still does.
He spends most of his time with me anyway. What else could I possibly wish for? What else could I possibly want from him? Is his friendship not enough? For me, it should be.
Followed by the Carrows, Snape steps onto the dais.
he growls, revealing his broken arm.
He kisses me, long and slow and clings, and then turns to drop flat on his stomach, breathing heavily.
Only when a few days pass, and I'm sick of lying in my bed, doing nothing, going on in my head in circles, only then I begin to remember a bunch of little things. Only then afterthoughts begin nagging: that a lot of letters Zabini couldn't possibly have sent because they appeared when he was right in front of me.
"With
It's white before my eyes.
“Do you have a spare quill?”
"Aha!" Her wand drawn, cackling Alecto Carrow steps down the dais. "The Dark Lord told us you'd come, and here you are."
"I dreamt you were sleeping next to me," I say as my hand bumps into him in the morning.
I pull back and stare at her.
"For me, it wasn't."
"Look..." Potter is pacing the kitchen. "Okay, I think... a meeting with your father may be arranged. But you'll have to speak to him in my presence. So that he won't be able to do anything. He wouldn't want to have an Auror for a witness." He turns to me. "Would that be okay?"
"Shhh..." He rocks me, and for a moment there is nothing but him shielding me from the world, his warmth, the pressure of his grip and the weight as he rests his head against mine. "I'm not going anywhere."
"Ah, okay."
now - felt so damn satisfying. I’m not about to tell her.

"I already have," I say. "Come here."
The heady words make me dizzy. With anticipation and fear and lust.

His lips will be gentle, his eyes loving, his face so dear and familiar…
"It will take another month?"
... is special.
"No, I'm fine, I really need to..." I nod at her.
"What time is it?" The sky outside the window is faded, pale grey-and-pink. It may be dusk or dawn, I cannot tell.
I selected a bird - a random Hogwarts barn owl - tying the envelope to its leg.
"No," a voice repeats after me. Deep and dark and familiar.
I take a step forward, and another one. With my hand outstretched in front of me, I begin walking towards the exit. No one gets in the way, and in no time my hand bumps into the hard wooden frame of the Great Hall double door. Sliding my palm over the wood, I step into the Entrance Hall and turn to the right, heading in the direction of the back door leading to the courtyard. The breeze caresses my face, the warm touch of the sun gentle on my skin. I sit down on the stone steps and turn my face upwards, inhaling deeply. I realise I’ve closed my eyes. Not that it makes any difference. I open them. No. I close them again, this way it's better. It's nice and soothing, and makes me imagine - makes me pretend - that I'm just chilling out in the sun, on the steps before Herbology class, waiting for my friends to finish their lunch and pick me up.
The link between the two connects the one to the other." Malfoy stares down at his hands, spreading out the duvet on his lap.
After a long silence, there was a quiet click of the closing door.
"Why?"
"He's taking the evening schedule seriously," Potter giggles, as we enter the living room.
"Draco, I'm
I've probably caused him pain. "Lean on me."
"Er... not really?" He says, studying the sign.
"Better," I reply and reach out with my hand. She carefully takes it.
"What?"
Frowning, Malfoy looks at me.
Potter.
"I just…" you will finally begin and trail off, your voice scratchy as though from disuse. "I just heard you've returned, so…"
I know what you mean. I could play dumb and ask you
I can't believe it. And I can. Of course, I can - I knew it all along.  Even before he knew it. The first time I overheard her talking to her friends, I knew. I knew she would be trying to steal him.
"Don't leave me," your voice repeats. That's when I know the words belong to you.
"She doesn't." Potter gets on his feet and goes back inside the tent.
"No, Ron, it's fine." I step back. "It's okay. Nothing to worry about."
"The Deathly Hallows. The one who attained them all would be the Master of Death."
"None of your business," Weasel snaps, dropping down in another armchair.
Although I see what I see, at first I don't comprehend, staring dumbly at the white note. It's only when all the blood rushes to my face, I realise my hands are trembling.
His hands… his fingers are having their way with me. Giving in and trying not to, I swallow a traitorous moan. And if I find his touch pleasant - then so what?
wouldn't do that. If anything, he is bound to protect me for his own safety. I'd like to think that Potter wouldn't abandon me now, even without the bond, but that's probably too much to wish for. Don't be ridiculous, Malfoy.
You did.
“Even then, yes.” He comes close. “Let’s go?”
His face is very close.

Later, Hermione told me. She knew. For a long time. Since before Christmas, she said.

A man comes forward. A tall blond man with limp long hair. I squint at him. He comes forward from the
It's probably because for a while Potter has been the closest person to me. In fact, he's the only person I ever talk to; the only one who is aware that I exist and acknowledges my presence, who doesn't recoil as though I'm diseased every time he lays eyes on me. It has to make some kind of connection. I consider Potter
Wrapping my arms around myself, I bury my nose into the sleeve and inhale, imagining that my arms, my hands, are his.
I am shaking.
"No, we'd never... it hadn't come to that." His hair is in my face, I blow it out. "Last night - with

"Draco!" I scream at the top of my lungs.
"Okay, I'm off to Transfigurations." Something dropped at my feet. "Here's your bag. If you want to sit here all day."
"Voldemort, he..."
Harry Potter crossed his arms, eyeing his visitor up and down.
And I cry.
"Hmm?" I turn to her.
"Young Draco has done well and proven himself to be most loyal. Alas! The boy has died tonight, and nothing can bring him back." I raise my voice, surveying the semi-circle of people before me. "But I'll have you know that Draco Malfoy did not die in vain! He died fulfilling his task. The task of the utmost secrecy and importance I gave him. And is there a more honourable way to die than serving your Master until the very end, I ask you?" I pause, waiting for their reply.
must not know."
, Draco!" Zabini claps his hands.
"Your bracelet, I mean." He points at your wrist.
I leap up the stairs two steps at a time, pissed off with Malfoy, with this thing with Gin, with myself, with everything. I slam the door of my dorm shut. Thank Merlin, we don’t share it with the git.
He says nothing for a while, but then I feel his hand on my shoulder... and another hand strokes my hair, and then a weight presses on top. I open my eyes and realise he is leaning his head against mine, kneeling in front of me.
"Well, I told her," he says.
Your punch in the gut made me double over, releasing my grip on you. You shoved me, hard, so that I stumbled back and landed sprawled on the pavement, suddenly realising how drunk I had gotten when the street lights started spinning before my eyes.
“Come on,” he says above me, “get up.” He takes my hand, helping me to my feet.
"I'm good,
She's in her dress from last night. She told me, when we were outside, that the party in the Gryffindor tower was winding down, when she decided to go find me and stay. Or maybe I imagined this, I'm not sure. But she saw me snogging Malfoy, yeah? That's how we ended up outside in the first place.
"Yes," I say.
I grip him by the shoulders and shake him. "Harry,
They exchange glances and follow me to the castle.
They dance.
"Hermione!" Weasley dashes to her still form on the floor.
The conversation amused me and…
"Are you looking for a fight, Potter?"
We never talk about it, we just... We're here, together, like this; it seems enough. And we have sex, of course. Plenty.
"You're staring," you said, not looking up from the piano. For the very first time of so many times, in so many moments like that.
"Draco," his mother whispers above me.
You vaguely remembered her from Hogwarts. But that was ten years ago. Everyone had changed.
After that, it was only a matter of days before you found out. Before it all began to click.
The Horcrux-Granger snakes her arm around his waist.
"Not here," he says as we reach the door of the Great Hall. "I thought, we could discuss it in the library tonight. It's about our potions project."
"Avada Kedavra!" The one shouts.
as though he's chosen a spot between my eyes to stare at, to give an impression that he looks at me while he doesn't. I adjust my glasses.
"Thank you." He took the vial. "You won't have to go through this again. They'll be able to make copies, if need be."

In the evening, when Potter suddenly asks me to play, I don't refuse.
Aunt Bella used to say. This is when I'd finally grasped the meaning of her words.
He is not stronger than I. All I have to do is push him harder, throw him off and grab my wand from the coffee table to cast
I am alone.
"Harry!" Seamus claps me on the shoulder. "You're lucky, mate!"
"For what?"
I turn to the lake. It is already dark. Black skies, black waters. Stars divided between the two. Two moons, shining twice as bright. Beautiful. Lonely.
"Read it?"
“Dead.” Mother nods. “Molly Weasley killed her.” There’s a quiet satisfaction in her voice.
Away.
Waking up the next morning, at first I thought it was still the middle of the night. But the darkness was too thick, too whole, too encompassing. When my fingers touched the bedside lamp and pressed the button on… the sound was too loud in the darkness. Nothing happened. I groped for it, knocking it to the floor. When it fell, scattering the sound of shattered glass - terror gripped me all of a sudden. I bolted out of bed, my feet stinging as I leapt to the door. I tore it open and dashed onto the landing, catching myself at the bannisters.
With a grunt, Aunt Bella throws her dagger in their wake. It cuts into the mist and dissolves without a trace.
I had no idea Potter owned a house. “Okay.”  I grabbed my clothes from the armchair and headed to the bathroom to change out of my pyjamas. I dressed as quickly as I could, wary of asking more questions, for they obviously annoyed Potter.
"Hi." I turn to him, my heart racing.

me or what? My palms are clammy.
You feel the urge to fidget under his gaze. You are relieved when he looks down at the piece of paper in his hands.
My patience snaps. I punch him right into his toothy smile. Crying out, he stumbles back, falling off the desk and on the floor. I loom over him. Another blow into his nose, twice. I see blood is dripping in rivulets down his smooth brown skin, and it feels so good. I should have done it long ago.
I wait.
I open the narrow double door and peer into the cabinet. Nothing. Empty. I retrieve a walnut from my pocket and carefully place it in the middle of the empty shelf and concentrate.
He lowers his voice dramatically.
"Hi, Harry," Hermione greets me.
I go cold.
I don't want to. I won't. Anything but looking at...
"No!" I try to grab his shoulder. "Harry, no!" But he is out of my reach.
He exhales, looks away, shakes his head. "No, in a lot of things you've been right."
Granger lowers her wand, but Weasel doesn't.
Malfoy finally manages to wrench my hands off Zabini. "Are you insane?!"
"I refuse to believe that my only son is to wallow in the most

He clears his throat in silence and slowly gets off me. Trust him to read my thoughts and do the opposite.
My mind reels. Everything is wrong, false as a terror of a nightmare.
I stare at him. He offers his protection to my Mother - just like that - he offers his house without a second thought.

"Malfoy, I'm so sorry, I..."

I replied, stroking you along with your movements.
"I was."
and I. It's ‘two’, ‘one’ and ‘one’.
"How?"
"It's a Dragon."
I must tell him. I must tell him that Snape is a traitor. He should know, he should never trust him again.
I run my other hand over the top of his head, back and forth. "Your hair is longer here."
He is leaning against the back of the sofa with his eyes closed.
I watch as Malfoy's hand is resting on Parkinson's throat, the other one gripping her around the waist, pressed along the length of his body, as he tilts her chin up in a greedy kiss.
I'm doing and withdraw, utterly horrified with myself. But he follows my lips with his and seeks and finds them, kissing back,
serving as someone's joke, or the reason to shake their heads in bewilderment and pity, turning me into a sultry gossip.
"Yes," he whispers, "I lied."
It was a cold rainy morning that turned into a colder rainy day. Because of the shitty weather, the four of us were huddled together in the tent all day long. Granger was reading, and the rest of us were doing nothing, except for drinking endless tea.
a female voice croons.
"He's changed." I hear her telling Ron. “He's set on making amends and returning Harry his sight.”
this fear of being exposed. Although I faced it multiple times, every next time is as good as new.
I regret I can’t see the way he looks at girls around, otherwise, I would have figured it out by myself.
"But..." I kiss behind his ear, making him shiver.
“Your snowball hit me right in the eye.”
Only when McGonagall intervenes (tipped by Hermione, no doubt), do the letters stop.
The word
The Great Hall is buzzing. People are coming and going through the great double doors. The whole Ministry is here, the Aurors, Shacklebolt giving orders, reporters flashing their cameras. They are crowding and moving...

For these past two weeks, I haven't touched the locket even once.
Crabb and Goyle grunt and dash in the directions I pointed out. Good.
I don’t want Astoria’s orange, but open my hand to him all the same - out of spite. Half of the fruit nestles into my palm. He has divided it into slices.
"So am I," Mother said, but she didn't sound like it.
When Gin comes in, I am doubled over the toilet, vomiting repeatedly. My eyes are tearing up, I’m shaking, and
I stared dumbly at the words, written in his careless scrawl, and couldn't believe my own eyes.

"I think it's a pureblood thing about you... or maybe because you play the piano, I don't know." He laughs.
I am under Potter's roof, and this is humiliating.
"Who the hell does Robards think he is?" Your arm would snake around my lower back, pulling me close.
"He must feel lonely, I suppose," Hermione says, "having no one to talk to."

His mother's voice is shining. "Draco, darling."
I shrug her hand off. "You go, I..."
It's been two weeks, and it seems it will never be over. Never enough. I move through a haze. Because all this can't be possibly happening to
He is beside me on the floor, his hands untangling my feet from the jeans, removing my socks.
“Harry, please...” Your voice is wrong, are you crying?
"Harry!" Granger shrieks.
Dropping into the desk next to Ron at the last minute, I barely manage to catch my breath as the class begins.
"Yes." She squeezes my shoulder. "Perfectly fine, you don't have to worry."
I don't know why, but talking to him about it is much easier than I thought. Much, much easier than thinking about it when I'm alone.
"Yeah! That's the line you’re touching now."
" Potter yelps. "Fuck!.. What the?.."
says the treacherous thought. I try not to dwell on it.
"You were right," he repeats over and over, his voice shrill, "I'm so sorry, you were right. I should have listened to you." Kneeling on the frozen ground, he rocks back and forth.
into flames and look, transfixed, at my face disappearing in the lashes of fire.
We boil the eggs in the tiny cauldron we'd found in the tent and gorge on them, seasoning them with salt we have in the tent supplies. The chicken, however, has turned out to be a bit of a problem. We can't eat it alive, can we?
This is what I do. Come home and lie down.
"Who?"
Potter doesn't say.

"But... why would Theo?.."
"At the
"Well, Neville..." The Dark Lord cocks his bald head. "I am sure we can find a place for you in our ranks-"
I led you around the building and into the garden.
"Well, that's… a powerful one," he replies quietly.
Malfoy doesn't stop me when I walk out of the library door, neither do I hear his footsteps behind as I descend the staircase, nor does he follow me out of the castle. At least, as far as I'm aware of. Oddly enough, I find my way onto the grounds easier than I expected. Slowly, with my hand outstretched, I walk down the hill, in the direction of the Lake, as far as I remember it. I'm not afraid to get lost, not really. I can summon Kreacher any moment. And it's Hogwarts grounds, for fuck's sake. What can possibly happen to me here, worse than already had?
I descend the stairs and mingle with the crowd, the game of 'Spin the Bottle' still going on. I contemplate the thought of joining it again, but end up on the sofa between Neville and Ron. I want to have fun, but somehow it's not fun anymore. I refuse Firewhisky and sit, thinking of Malfoy. Of his kiss and why he left. He didn't mention
I'm not lying, I’m not!" I plead. I sound so weak and miserable, disgusting. "You owe me the debt. You promised Dumbledore that you’d protect me," I whisper, searching his face, trying to make him
you said,
"Can't sleep?"
"Yes."
"Art? Wow, you're an artist, then?"
"What do you want?" Harry perched at the edge of his desk.
I'm not fine, I'm shaking, and the dream's paralysing images are still vivid before my eyes. It was I - instead of Chris and Paul - in the circle, and my Father was beating the gay out of me with his cane in front of the cheering crowd.
"I don't want to talk about it," I say, "how are you?"
But now he’s left me alone, I'm sure.
"Kreacher is here." His bony hand clutched my wrist. "Master don't see, Kreacher is near Master."
I wake up in the darkness at a touch to my shoulder. The bunk dips under his weight. It's narrow, and there's not enough room for two. Harry manages to fit himself on his side behind me anyway.
How is Malfoy feeling right now about the whole thing? Why had he agreed to play in the first place?
We burst into the seventh-floor corridor and hit the wall. Harry grunts as I land on top of him. Granger is already running back to the entrance. As soon as Weasley and Goyle fly out of the Room, she points her wand and seals the entrance where hellish flames fight each other, and finally sags on the floor.
"Astoria? Why would I bring her?"
His calves, down down… "You have bony ankles."
For once, Potter has stopped stalking me. Probably Dumbledore told him to. He used to lurk in the background every time I set foot outside the Great Hall or classes. No doubt he imagined himself a master of stealth and me being none the wiser. Idiot. A drunken bear is subtler than Potter creeping behind me along the corridors.
the traitorous thought worms its way into my mind.
I saw in that cave, I know Dumbledore is definitely
I know that voice.
"Because of her, I've never considered that it might be you," I say, "Noir."
Ron shifted by my side, and Hermione squeezed my hand.
When I open my eyes in silence, I know
My life is red and flowing all around me on the tiled floor...
I hear, rather than see, the moment he hits the ground: the air is torn with his strangled cry. I turn my broom back.
"Here, Malfoy." I grab his arm. He jerks and whines.
There's
"Is he..." I turn to look at Harry. "Is he wounded?"
I wrap my arms around him and think that it doesn't matter to me how he looks.
"You're ridiculous, Potter."
"You die." His voice is gentle.
Slender shoulders folding in defeat, her rigid form curled in on itself as your palm splayed over the plane of her back, pressing her firmly into your body.
I get to my feet. “For fuck’s sake, don’t start that.”
Something had been gone. I'd stuck to Malfoy and had  started spending far less time with my friends. They didn’t object, nor did they interfere. Sometimes there are days we don’t talk to each other at all, it just happens.
"Looks like you really need it. Honestly, Potter!" He paces the carpet. "Only the self-centred dick that you are could throw a tantrum over a
Potter beside me clears his throat. "Will you excuse me...?” He stands up. "I have to check something." He heads to the door.
"Am I?" I throw my head back; I am not able keep it upright.
I was fucked. There were no doubts left.
Bringing the flute to your lips, you will finally see me. All the way across the vast ballroom. My heart will drop. You will raise the glass in my direction in a show of a deliberate salute, throwing all the memories back at me like a swirl of autumn leaves. Haunting, beautiful, useless. Dead. A whisper, a touch away from turning into dust they belong to.
I am shaking. I don't want to see it; I don't want to watch what happens next. I have to. Potter is living it through my eyes, there's no other way to show him.
"Trust you to make a
"Hi," Malfoy says quietly at our first class after the Christmas break.
I found myself interested, it finally felt as though there was a purpose. I found myself going everywhere with Malfoy and refusing my friends’ offers to walk me to classes more often than not.
Releasing me, he tugs his jeans up, hastily fastening the belt, and takes my hand, leading me to the sofa.
We both laugh, covering the sound of my thudding heart. Potter nods but says nothing, staring into the flames. He doesn't even glance at me as I retreat into the cave.
He shook his head. "Just..."
I am letting out everything I’d been determined to hide for the rest of my life.
He's not dead.
I send owls. Quite a few in the past two days.
"It's October. My birthday was two months ago."
We were the last today finishing at Potions, and when Ron and Hermione showed up to pick me, I told them I'd be fine with Malfoy. And now we are late.
She is leaving after Christmas, and I envy her. Maybe it would be better for me to leave, too?
Keep him
I didn't have a choice, did I? It was either follow Potter or stay with Weasley after he had threatened to kill me. I didn't need to think twice. "Okay.”
And I don't know how I am to survive.
"Legere Digitus Intelligo." I pressed my fingertips to the parchment, and my hand jerked under his because there it was: the prickling under my fingers made me suddenly see words forming in my mind, as though from a golden mist.
Your gazes met. It all rushed back at you.

Overwhelmed and dizzy, I was so exhausted... I passed out instantly, feeling his arm around me.

Damn. “No… we’re just chatting.” The smile falls off my face. “It’s okay, Ron.” I’m grateful that Ron looks out for me, but his attempts at babysitting me all the fucking time… It’s so embarrassing.
- quote from the novel ‘Simon vs. the Homo Sapiens Agenda’ by Becky Albertalli
"You know," Draco said after a while, "we don't have to be drunk to kiss."
"Tired, Potter?" You'd huff into my neck, lowering yourself down on top of me after you came.
I smile back. "Okay then, no problem," I say. "Let's do it together, once we are out of here."
Fuuuuck, it's stuffy in here.
for his parents' sake.
Malfoy sets his jaw, there's a red blotch burning on his cheekbone. I'm cruel. I want to be cruel.
"Long story short," Greyback barks, "I brought you your son, and I want my reward."
Fuck. Not that again. My heart sinks. This game is not just a game, you can't get away with lies, which makes it even more embarrassing. Everyone who agrees to play has a spell put on them, preventing them from lying. Directly, at least. You can avoid questions, you can be evasive, not saying yes or no, but you are unable to tell an outright lie or do a wrong action.
Potter frowns.
He breathes, and I breathe with him... Until I feel his legs wrap around the back of my thighs.
an odd thought dissolved in the ragged turmoil in your head.
for fucking him over like that. How dumb you can be for doing what you'd done? Calling him out to meet you in front of all these people! And when he comes, humiliating him even more, refusing to see what's under your nose!"
Whatever I might have expected, it wasn't this. "You don't trust me, sir."
attacking
"Yes.
"Excellent, Mr. Potter," Malfoy hisses into my ear in so perfect a parody that I can't help sniggering again.
He's asleep, I think, beginning to close the door, when: "Draco?" He says quietly. "Come in."
Malfoy doesn't reply. Sullen and puffy-eyed, he just looks at me. He's been crying a lot, I think dully. I recently cried a lot, too.
"You can't ask things like that!" Says Hermione. "There has to be a limit."
what I will see there. Whom I will see. I don't want to. Still, I turn. I have no choice.
I move before I know it, coming to my senses while already leaping halfway across the Hall. Because he's an idiot, a reckless Gryffindor idiot, and even death hasn't changed him at all. He is wandless.
"You will have to submit your memories, as evidence," he says, "just once. Once."
She's cool, she really is. Nice, smart and witty. And beautiful, yes - he has eyes.
I stare at his retreating back until he disappears.
You glared but didn't move.
"You know what. The entire school will learn your dirty little secret."
Helpless before his ire, you didn't deny it as you should have. Everything must have been written across your face, for one look at you made him cringe.
"Are you, really?" He asks. "You hadn't called, I thought..."
"You are drunk, dear," it says.
"Do pray, dear friends, for their redemption. Do beg God to forgive them!"
“I did.”
"Your father wasn't home. She assured me she's fine. She said he'd been asking questions, but otherwise hasn't attempted to harm her in any way. But I'm still not sure she's safe in the Manor."
"Well then, I'm
"So." Malfoy clears his throat, and I realise he is nervous.
"It's impregnated with Basilisk venom,
"And I didn't mean anything," he says, "I just... didn't know it's your birthday, and now I know... that's all. So happy birthday." He looks at me.
My mind races.

With a cry, he presses his fingers into his scar and throws his head back against the floor.
The noseless fucker gapes like a fish, having seemingly forgotten why they are even here. Now, isn't it the perfect moment to strike him once and for all? But Harry goes on and on, and the Dark Lord
I kiss him.
I shuffle my feet. “It looks ridiculous.”
"At least I would know what I have to deal with. One misstep, Draco, the tiniest stupidity on your part, and we are both dead."
"And what about him do you doubt?" I glance at Severus, whose face remains as calm as ever.
"Not the same, no," I agree, "but otherwise we would've never met. And I wouldn't want that to happen."
"Master Black." Kreacher bows, letting me inside. "Happy Birthday!"
I open my eyes.
"Harry," Dumbledore calls, "do come in."
of Apparition outside. And another. Again and again.
"I told you everything Dumbledore told me!" Potter raised his voice. "And in case you haven't noticed, we have found a horc-"
It's the bracelet, for the most part. But not entirely. I think something has been broken in me during these last three months... And there was Theo, of course... I don’t want to think about it.
“Why don’t you ask her out, then?” I ask petulantly.
"Ron!" Hermione says.
It's liberating.
"Poor Potter." You rolled your eyes. "Okay, go live your life, let me read."
I say nothing. My good mood suddenly evaporates.
"You lied, they didn't hold you captive."
voice - calling my name. It had said:
His thigh slides over my groin, his knee rests on my hip. "You've left your pants on," he says.
"Well, okay…" Malfoy finally drops my hand. "We probably shouldn't have done it. Potter?”
And isn't that what I wanted? What I've been asking for? His words sting, let me down, wind me up, make me sick, make everything worse.
Written in runes and so ancient, in fact, that...
“Harmony, Potter, is a--”
I didn't need to be told twice. I put the empty glass down on the parapet, grabbed its edge and jumped over, landing at your feet on my outstretched palms. The pain of the gravel bite sent needles through my skin. Fuck. I was drunker than you.
"Hang on..." Harry peers over her shoulder. "I saw it... elsewhere...
I think dumbly. Weasley falls on his knees beside the body, and Granger steps back, and back, and back, and back. She shakes her head and presses her palm to her mouth. I wouldn't recognise her dirty face. Her back hits the pillar, and she sags on the floor and doesn't move.
"Look, Potter, I didn't know," he begins. "On the staircase. I had no idea. I'm sorry."
She grabs at the sword of Gryffindor fastened to his belt and wrenches it out.
"You sound too happy about it, Potter," he scoffs, gathering his things into his bag. "Well, your friends are here," he lowers his voice. "See you around."
I stepped forward and took it without hesitation. "Harry."
, when he feels embarrassed, unsettled or out of his depth. He takes his glasses off, so as not to see a person's face. A childish thing. This is what small kids do, playing hide and seek. They just close their eyes, thinking that as long as they can't see anything, they're invisible to the world.
"I know." I've been checking on him on the Map: he doesn't leave his room.
"Really? Did you spend time here when you were a kid?" I lit one of the wall lanterns with a spell.
We stay in the cave; we wander around with no aim or purpose. Hungry most of the time. After that first ‘raid’ to the farm, we are rarely successful in finding food. The weather is cold, but we are not. We are together against the cold, lost in the woods and each other... and I’m not sure if I care to be found. My life - the other life - seems so far away. The one where I had to fight and fight and never have a rest. Maybe it would be better to keep it just like this till the end of time? To let it go and just live? I wonder if Draco feels the same. He probably does. I never ask, what would I do if he said no? He's the only one I have, the only one who is still here for me. I can't lose him.
I wish he were mine
"Yeah."
"Celario!" Granger moves in front of me, and another portion of space shimmers, hiding her from my view.
"Right." I nod.
“I’ve left my gloves.” I gesture vaguely around. “There, somewhere.”

and..." He shakes his head, his voice barely a whisper. "Led them here. He told me, he'd be waiting at the top of the Astronomy Tower, so we... went right there. And there he was - alone. I thought he'd call the Aurors. Nothing went as planned." Malfoy covers his eyes. "He talked wrong, and never tried to fight, and there was Aunt Bella... I didn't know what to do. Then he knocked me out with a spell, and..." He shrugs.
“Thanks!”
Dumbledore spreads out the Invisibility Cloak and drapes it over me, covering my stiff form from head to toe.
"I'm summoning the Dark Lord," Avery says, rolling up his sleeve, "Those three obviously know where Potter is, they'll answer
Bewildered, Harry turns around and sees me. He runs forward and waves his wand, casting Protego on me. "You're wandless!" He shouts, dashing past me to the rescue of Arthur Weasley fighting a Death Eater. "Keep away! Go!"  He disappears into the crowd.
"Wait, wait," I utter. It’s painful, I can't go on like this.
"Why the hell didn't you kill him
"Oh... of course." Mother strokes my hand. "You would like to keep it long, like your Father's."
Granger steps next to him and places her hand on his shoulder. "Ron..."
She caresses Malfoy's nape with her fingers and takes half a step back.
"Done." He extinguishes the flame under the cauldron, closes the lid and turns to me. He's wearing goggles.
"He has locked himself in his dorm," Hermione said.
"Why??"
That's when I realised that all that time I wanted someone like you, but different. Someone with your face, someone as graceful, beautiful, charming. Someone who would love me the way I craved. Someone so unlike you.
When he finally turned, his face was devoid of any emotion. Still not looking at you, he walked to the desk, gesturing at the Pensieve sitting on his desk.
My heart gives a jolt. I hastily open it to grab the note.
"Where's Dumbledore?"
Malfoy sits up in the bed.

"Whoa!"

"Nothing... actually, she laughed."
"What the fuck?" I sit up and wince, my head swimming.
"I’m not even going to ask what you're going to do there." Malfoy shakes his head.
Why the hell bring them here?

I put it on his chest. "Your wand, sir."
Looking around the room, I try to point out who is in costume and who isn’t. He said he'd be dressing up, right? That's what he said,
I step under the hot water and close my eyes, letting it beat over my face, down my chest and shoulders. My hand reaching down for my cock, I don't even hesitate or pretend
And another one: “Hi, Draco!”
Something drops in my stomach.

He spends time with Astoria now, not every day, but still often. Too often for my liking. When he offers to let me join them on their walk to Hogsmead, I refuse, shutting myself in my room. We planned this weekend together a while ago - to go shopping for Christmas presents. Maybe shopping is too strong a word, he said, he only needed one present for his mother. Now, it's Astoria who is helping him choose it, at this very moment, when I sit in my room, torn between the urge to break down in tears and kick something. Or

The living room is lit up with the soft glow of the candles in the air. It reminds me of Hogwarts and my childhood, it reminds me of the Manor, of the happy memories I had there. Yes, there were also the terrible ones; but those earlier flashes of happiness are undoubtedly there as well, and they cannot be taken away, no matter that my Father thinks I no longer have the right to have them.
"Yes. He did it." I beckon at him.
I have no choice but to turn to her.
I've spend the whole morning here, sitting on a bench by the river, making sketches of the city architectural forms for my college project.
"Granger doesn't believe me."
Potter's bedroom is right next to mine, and we share the bathroom, but I haven't been there. Of course I haven't, there's absolutely no reason to.
"It's alright, Kreacher." I sit up, wiping my eyes. "Sorry, I..." I shake my head. "What time is it?"
"We should probably let it go," Granger says weakly, though everyone knows, she doesn't really mean it.
"Scared?!" Was your reply over the wind.
I still don't have the courage to make that final step.
Wrenching out of Ron’s grip, I stumbled forwards and fell, catching myself on what felt like the edge of Musgrove's desk.

His arm snakes around me under the blanket. "I'm not staying here to sleep on the other side of the bed,

"You're gay?"
"He's
"This old man is old," Dumbledore says, "and full of surprises."
In a flash of silver, Dragon erupts from his wand. Searing bright and shining, it soars into the sky, its huge silver wings blinding the sun.
"Draco!" Someone grabs my sleeve. "Draco, come on!" Pansy tries to pull me along.
"Yes, you do!" He shouts. "Bad-mouthing her is not the best way to get her affection, Potter!"
I close my eyes for a moment to regain my balance. When I open them again, my gaze lands directly on Malfoy. With his arms crossed, he is leaning against the banisters of the main staircase; he looks like he's been standing there for a while. Still lingering in the moment of bliss, I realise I am grinning at him like a loon over Gin's shoulder. My smile falters. Heading down the stairs, Malfoy looks away.
"No."
"Alright." He stops, and I stop with him.
“Yes.” My face on fire, I hate myself and my stupid tongue.
of course it is, its black outline standing out against his skin as ugly as I remember. It hasn't changed, but I know
Mother told me before my departure that the Dark Lord summoned Snape and punished him for the lie about breaking the Unbreakable Vow. Snape begged him to forgive his mistake and arrogance, he said he thought he did break it when I seemingly died and he didn't. The Dark Lord believed him... but Crucioed him anyway.
"Potter," Malfoy said above me. "What the actual fuck?"
"You wear the Mark! You don't get to call
"Master is been long time leave to Ministry, it is the ten and the twenty o'clock."
I’ve seen him like this before, his hair soaked red in a pool of blood.
Despite the pang of guilt every time the thought crosses my mind, I even begin to think that maybe it's for the best that Noir had left. So many things I have gained back, so many discovered anew. Hell, I even befriended Malfoy since I'd ceased to obsess over Noir and live for his next letter.
"Yes, Father." You stood up to leave.

that stands out. I can't find them. He probably modifies his handwriting. Which is wise, of course, but leaves me bitter, as if he doesn’t trust me. I don't tell him though.
"I know, Gin," I said, "I do."
The guard takes my arm.
Malfoy stares at me in horror. "How?.."
"Rise, Draco."
Sometimes during Quidditch I catch his gaze on me. Our eyes meet a second before diving for the Snitch. And there's challenge: desire to prove, outsmart and show off, that is always our driving force. But also something else, genuine and bright, something like joy, something that makes me feel myself to be the reason of it.
And I am crying, and Hermione's crying and even Ron sniffs. His eyes guarded, Draco looks between the three of us. I pull him close, wrapping my arm around his waist.
“Feel free to move your feet as well,” he says. [2]
it was..." I can't bring myself to say it.
"Grimmauld Place? I don't know...perhaps?" Granger offers uncertainly.
She and Ron are still sceptical about Malfoy, but they left it alone after I asked them. Now, Malfoy often brings me right to my seat at meals and leaves to take his place at the Slytherin table. Hermione told me he sits alone, no one ever talks to him.
"Do you want it cut?"
"The snake."
"It's a Stag!" Draco said in awe.
Streaks of pain sting through my chest. What's the point of this exercise, anyway? What harm would there be if I just summoned the thing across the room with my wand? Carefully I limp towards the bed, every step of my right foot tugging at the strings of pain up my abdomen. Well, I'm not sure I'd want to make it the entire way back to the window. I think I'm just going to climb into bed and be done with it.
But what a life would that be?
"I wish you both all the happiness for the years to come."
"But you're going to stay here all alone…"
"You are ridiculous." He shakes his head. "Yes, you
Your blood is singing.
Harry ducks and rolls over and springs back on his feet.
I am looking for.
Lathering myself up, my thoughts stray to the kisses: the one that happened...and the one that didn't. I think of kissing him and think of the dream, where I'd taken Parkinson's place. Did we look like that when we were kissing?
"Ogling me, were you?"
Granger steps in front of me again. "Cela-"
I press several keys again, and the light switches on.
I didn't stop.
Well, fuck you! It's not. I've been experimenting with this stuff for a while, and now that you came along, you could at least help me test it and not be the totally useless prick that you are."
I turned and realised it wasn't just you and the man. It was a group you were hanging out with.
I wanted a kiss, but braced myself for a fight.
Rage grips me. Rage so strong that I am suddenly afraid. I feel as though I'm not me, but someone else. I should stop and take a breath, because deep down I know I don't really mean it... after last night, Malfoy's warm touch and kisses still vivid in my mind, I can't possibly mean it... but the thought is drowned in the hot anger and nasty suspicion that poisons everything I felt towards him just a moment ago.
falling into your trap."
"Glad to hear." He covers my hand with his.
"When they carried you out of the Great Hall, Aurors came after me."
"You know," I told him, "when you kissed me in the game of Spin the Bottle…"
"They're making out," Ron replies, "and enjoying it, too."
I dash past them to the door and switch the lights off on my way out.
"No. I'm not hungry. Go away."
"Purebloods, you mean?"
"Potter, I
Seems like no one but me talks to Malfoy. And I don't really want to talk much to anyone. Everyone treats me like I'm fragile, like I might break from a careless word thrown at me.
"What?" I haven't really been listening. My mind drifts.
“Potter.”
"Shhh..." His whisper is hot in my ear. "I just thought... would you..." He swallows.
Fuming, I stride down the corridor, reliving the conversation in my head, which only makes me angrier. No, I'll never get along with Malfoy, with people like him - with the fucking
"Almost done, don't get up." Pomfrey stands up. "I am going to fetch some potions."
Later that evening, I find myself on the floor by the fireplace. There's a party in the Common Room, and as soon as Malfoy and I appeared, girls giggled and dragged us to sit in the circle for the game of 'Truth or Dare.' And now it's Malfoy's turn. I vaguely see him by my side - a darker shape through the yellowish mist from the lamps and the fireplace. Around us, people are sitting in a vague quivering mass.
~~~ The End ~~~
"Harry! Pour dittany into the wound! Five drops, hurry!" Granger yells, springing on her feet. She runs around, slashing the air with her wand. "Salvio Hexia! Protego Totalum! Repellum Muggletum! Muffliato!"
with a flourish, as in
"Incendio!" Potter shouts, again and again, rage distorting his features.
_____________________________________________________________________________
again - a sound, a gasp of lust and pleasure – do I myself make it?
Weasley meets my eyes and stares, as though seeing me for the first time.
He was everything I had. And now there is no Harry. The world ended. Don't you dare, don't you fucking dare say that his death doesn't matter. You know nothing, you stuttering, blubbering fool. I hate Longbottom. I hate him.
Potter retrieves his hand from the bag and points his wand. "Accio Dittany!" A tiny vial flies out of the bag and slams into his palm.
It's worked, it's worked, it's working! I hadn't felt that excited and terrified in a long time.
Potter slaps me, hard. I can't believe it. My ear rings and my cheek burns.
"Mother's still there, I didn't feel like staying."
I sit back on my heels. "Fuck."
The door slams shut.

Chapter 3
We laughed a lot and teased each other.
After a while, I finally turn back and head to the shore. My wet hair tickles my neck; it has grown a bit long in the past few months. Shaving spells I can manage just fine, but I’m unable to decently cut my hair. I smooth it back from my face and suddenly see Potter approaching briskly over the boulders that cover the shore. He reaches the water and stops, staring at me still standing knee-deep in the water. There's
She says no more.
Aunt Bella bends down and slaps her, hard. "Don't lie to me. Where did you get it?"
Though I
"So Dumbledore doesn't know." Sick to my guts, I stand up.
"She's a barrister."
There is a problem. There definitely
"What?"
Malfoy is silent.
"Meals are served in the dining room three times a day, according to the schedule that you'll find in your bedside drawer. You may unpack your valise and come downstairs in an hour. I will escort you to the group session area."
I finish my sandwich and sit alone, staring into the fire, until my mind begins to drift and I struggle to keep my eyes open. I sit, half-drowsing, half-thinking, the flames of the fire mingling with images before my eyes.
With a silent flash of white, he sends me into the corner behind the pillar, and my back hits the wall. Pain explodes in my head where I smash it against the stone, warmth trickles down my neck. Blood. I cry out. No, I would - if I could. But I can't. My voice is stuck in my throat; in a panic, I choke on my tongue. His Full Body Bind is a cruel thing. I am unable to move, I am a wooden slab - a stiff useless thing - even my heart feels frozen. My mind screams, shock finally giving in to bewilderment, hurt, anger, outrage. Too late. It took him a mere second, and I never saw it coming.
, and my heart is racing. He is so close, and I am dying silently, aware of his shoulder brushing mine. I feel my face burning, and no doubt he sees, I cannot help it.
"Ron! No!" Granger's shriek rings in my ears.
"Aren't you eager to try it now?" He asks.
behind the wall, where they shut up the most hopeless cases. You’d even told him so the other day. You’d met him alone on the porch, during the afternoon session break, hastily trying to talk some sense into him in the span of those two minutes. Looks like your advice was given in vain.
" He rolls his eyes.
I tell him how Lupin taught me. About the Boggart-Dementor and chocolate.
I was possessed by a fucking Horcrux and witnessed him possessed. I fought him and kissed him and saved his life. I made love to him and let him into my very soul. And now I've lost him.

Malfoy rolls his eyes, pointing his wand at the bottle. The spell sends it spinning on the spot in a blur, and my head is spinning with it. I hold my breath, the mere thought of watching Malfoy doing
Panic grips me.
“I'm not!” I
"Get off me!" You pushed into my chest. "You don't own me. You can't just barge in and drag me out whenever you please."
"Now," he says quietly and puts the pestle down on the desk, "I'm going to measure four and a half spoonfuls into a bowl. One… two… three…" He counts steadily, and there's a metallic clink of a measuring spoon against porcelain. "Four… and a half."
The castle stood empty. We ate our lunch in the oddly silent Great Hall and headed to my room. When the door closed, he took my face in his palms and kissed me long and slow, as though we had all the time in the world. We did.
"Kreacher bring what Master Malfoy ask," the elf says, putting the set of charcoal crayons and a stack of paper on the table.
“There.”
All along, I am aware of Harry. Aware as he shifts and tries to say something, and fails. I don't look at him, I won’t. I don't look away from Granger and Weasley.
"No... alone... I was wanking myself, alone." I look down again at my hand flicking over his cock – flushed and thick, filling my palm perfectly - this is absolutely crazy. "Imagining watching
"What's happened to his face?" Mother presses the tip of her wand under Harry's chin and tilts his face up.
"You did." He stroked my hair. "It's okay, I asked you to."
The softness of the black cashmere nestled under your jaw, making you itch with the memories of him outlined against the bright window. He turned his head, sunlight dancing in the disarray of his hair, even more pale and golden against the severity of the black covering him up to the chin. He looked breathtaking in black. You never told him. You didn’t need to. He knew.
He doesn't deny it.
up, gathering them all into a neat stack and get to my feet.
You push past him, making your way to the exit.
- how can I say such a thing? But how can I tell her that I do, if I don't, and she already knows?
Silent minutes pass, only disturbed by a stray murmur around the circle.
"Look, Potter." He approached me, crossing his arms on his chest. "Are we ever going to talk about it? I'm really
His folded jeans on the shelf, the neat stack of pale jumpers, the black cashmere turtleneck—out, out, out! Reaching with your foot into the depth of the wardrobe, you sent the pair of black shiny brogues to the floor. Like dead fish, they landed with a thump, their soles ungracefully showing their perfectly clean underbellies. His Chelsea boots—out. You bent down to pick one up, your impotent rage reaching its crescendo as you hurled it into the opposite wall and finally stopped, your breath coming out in hard, shaky gasps. Clenching your jaw, you looked around, all the while aware of the tear that finally escaped the corner of your eye to roll down your cheek. Your hand jerked up to wipe it away.
"And my Father?" I ask, chills going down my spine. Because Potter may have dragged me out of there, but it doesn't matter. It doesn’t mean anything, as long as I’m wearing this thing. Father will be here in no time. And this time he'll shut me in another mental institution forever.
“Nothing.” I pull the collar of my coat up against the wind.
"You talked oddly, and I--"
Eventually, my tears stop, exhaustion washing over me. Only then do I realise that he is squeezing my wrists so hard that I can't stand it.
I think,

My hand will clench into a fist, crumbling the dust of those glimpses into nothing. I will take a breath... let it out and open my palm, allowing everything to dissolve without a trace in the music-lit air.
Mistaking my pain for pleasure, he crushes me into the sofa and comes, smearing sweat on my back, reaching under my belly...
I stand up. "Otherwise what?"
"Have you seen the board?"
I want to tell him to shut the fuck up, but wasn’t it I who started this?
"I haven't had a single drink." You approached the motorbike, it gleamed in the moonlight. "No problem."
"Come to dinner?" He blurts. "If you want... I mean... If you don't, it's perfectly fine… and..."
Potter is on his knees, his arm deep in a tiny beaded bag up to his elbow.
I was dosed. Otherwise, I wouldn't have said it.
that I have no idea how to offer. We stare at each other, until I realise that people around us are no longer moving, that the entire Great Hall is holding its breath.
"Don't get used to it, Potter," you used to say. But stayed anyway.
I shrug. "It wasn't working." Which is true. It wasn't. Though the entire bewildering thing in detail no one will ever hear from me.
He doesn't come. He isn't coming. He will not.
It's not fear
"Guys, what would you say if I told you that we found a Weasley, a girl and a guy in glasses?" Greyback grins. "It might be we captured Harry Bloody Potter." His gaze meets mine, and he stares, stares hard. Stares so that I know - he knows me, he has recognised me, and there's no point denying it. Slowly, he approaches.
The evening Hermione told him I'm gay, returning to our room he sat at the foot of my bed.
I drop his arm and step back. "Sorry... I was just... trying to help."
"I'm still here, Potter," I remind him.
We don’t speak again before the end of the class.
My fingers touch the handle, and I throw the door wide, illuminating the corridor with the bathroom lights. Nott is pressing into Daphne Greengrass, her hands are deep up his shirt. They still, and he slowly turns to squint at me.
"Does it
"Susan?" I whisper back.
"We love you, Henry!" You repeat loudly.
"You alright?" His palm is caressing my thigh.
“What?”
"Ah…" Your laugh was genuine when you sat down, putting your fingertips on the keys.
"In the forest." Granger's voice trembles.
“I mean, didn’t he get to you?”
I count. There are forty-four in this one, and when I finally reach it, taking a turn to the right into the corridor to my room… there's
When he unfastens my trousers, I buck my hips up, helping him remove them. My underwear follows.
The faint sound disturbs the silence.
"You dick!" I yell, trying to get it out. Too late. Under the layers of my coat and woollen jumper it melts into the disgusting rivulets down my back.
"These are nice," he says, "ideas, I mean... I'd love to bring them to life one day."
"He can't help me in this, and he won't want to."
I know he's right.
He spreads his arms wide. Uncertain of what to do next, I look at him. Does he want to
On Saturday night, he brings me the potion to test.
"Why what?"
"I want to. To thank you. For everything you are doing. I've never said that, and I think I should." Not looking at me, you gather water in your palm, making it flow through your fingers.
"Dear friends," Mr. Vice says into the microphone, "do forgive us this little inconvenience. Please enjoy your evening!"
"Pans, no listen-"
Potter?” He says as I lock my hands around his chest.

Weasley appears in the doorway with Harry behind him. His face is back to normal again – recognisable.
"Okay," I sigh, heading over to sit down on the stool. "Fine...
Hell if I know. Insane with panic, I'm just climbing - up and up, away from the fire. Crabbe leaps forward and begins climbing after me; Goyle follows him.
"For our… I mean--" He clears his throat. "For the Patronus training."
"Yes." He lay back. "Slowly."
Ginny strides into the Common Room. She crosses the room to the group of desks where Slytherins are sitting, and her manner - the vicious way she walks - tells me that something's about to happen.
"Do you like it?" He whispers against my lips.
I would sag in relief to the floor if my body would obey me.
"Slowly," he says, when I guide my cock to press against his entrance.
He wrenches at the door and slams it behind him.
" I would ask him. "How many?"
"What act exactly? There is no shame in admitting to your sins, Henry."
- I must admit... If I didn't know him, if I were a stranger, seeing him for the first time... I'd say that Malfoy is the hottest of them all; or maybe the hottest for me, I don't know.
Undressing, I drop my clothes on the floor where Kreacher will pick them up tomorrow and bring me clean ones. I climb into bed and lie for a while, thinking, remembering dully how I hated my glasses, how they always got in the way, how I wished to get rid of them. I don't need glasses now, I got rid of them for good. If I hadn't taken the potion, I would be weeping, crying myself to sleep. But I had. I am calm as a brick, but sleep won't come. And when it does, I will see
I know now, I'm able to take this route by myself. I put my foot on the first step, and then we fall back into our brisk pace.
"I want you to touch me," I whisper into his mouth.
We are sitting at dinner, just the two of us at the end of the deserted Gryffindor table. The Great Hall is almost empty, safe for the teachers and a few students here and there. Everyone has left for Christmas.
When he finally stopped in front of you, shrugging the bathrobe off... you thought you were prepared. You thought you were capable of handling it. You thought you knew what was to come. That's why you didn't even try to reach for your wand.
"Do I really look like him?"
I am so aroused, my mind goes blank.
"I have time."
"It's gone," he finally says in about a half an hour. "The bezoar."
I give it a careful stroke, and another one, watching as the flushed head disappears inside my fist.
Malfoy flinches.
?" I crowded you, until your back pressed into the lamppost.
When you took the door handle, an odd thing happened. At least I considered it odd at the moment. Later, I would get used to it. All the lanterns along the walls flared on, it seemed as though the house suddenly lost its gloominess. You opened the door, and the living room greeted us with it's huge ancient chandelier fully lit up with candles. The fireplace was merrily burning logs in the grate.
the fucking Dark Lord and be done with it?
It's not real. I shake my head. He is not my master. And Harry is here, I only have to wake him.
Weasley gets up from the bunk and approaches.

I think,
I go cold.
I exhale in relief and bow.
For some reason, I don't like this idea of Weasley's sister kissing Potter like
"Yes... yes," the voices reply from the opposite side of the circle.
how did I ever doubt to be able to find the lake with my eyes closed? They say, blindness makes all your senses sharper, more attuned to the world, so that you don't even need your eyes. No. It's all the same to me. But now I
I push Harry down on the ground and draw my wand. I hardly know what I'm doing, but I hope it's not too late. With a cutting spell, I slice the skin open over the bite. He screams, trying to wriggle his arm out of my grip.
I get to my feet. “Me.”
he repeats softly,
When I finally come to my senses, Weasley is sitting beside Granger, leaning his head against the wall; he watches me and says nothing. His eyes are dead. He looks like the one who has shed all his tears. But I am not nearly done.
Weasley is snoring, the top bunk of his two-level bed empty. In the dim flicker of the fire outside I see Potter lying quietly on the other bed with his back to me. I hesitate a moment, then climb up into the top bunk above Potter. No doubt Granger intends to 'share' Weasley's bed, I say to myself, my thoughts drifting...
I shout.
That I am not a monster
After our fight in the hospital, I started to hang out with Malfoy. Flying together and sometimes even sitting in the Common Room.
to guard the tent while they are asleep. Or rather Granger doesn't trust me, and Potter agrees to appease her. Once he offered to share the night watches with me, so that they would be easier to bear, each of them getting better rest. Granger said no. She was adamant, and Potter didn't insist.
I was right. I never wanted to talk to him about
I would launch forward and crush your lips until we both tasted blood. I would crowd you until your back hit the wall. I would clutch at you until you gasped for air, I would rip your clothes off and…
"Are you sure you'll manage?"
"Stop staring," you would mutter, passing me in the Ministry, your eyes full of mischief.
“He’s alive, yes. He’s…” Mother shakes her head. “He awaits his trial in Azkaban.”
I cry, howling my horrors into the void.
"Cissy?" The voice echoes around the hall.
and stuff all over the place."
"Well, Astoria, if you say so," someone laughed. "Though you'd rather prefer him that way around you. A bad boy turning soft."
“Draco!” She calls. “Catch!”
I am not one of them.
One of the fathers takes it, heading straight to the kneeling Christopher, and hits him on the back, hard. The sound is loud in the silent room.
"Fred," I repeat stupidly, my lips disobeying me.
I kick, but Ron drags me up the hill. I've never been a match for him when it came to the physical side of things. I have no choice but to follow.
"Once they met on the Astronomy Tower, Dumbledore pretended to kill Malfoy and made me promise I'd help him. So now everyone thinks he's dead, and I brought him here.”
“Alright.” I wipe my face with my sleeve, waiting for him to get up.
I want to shout,
"No, she's not. She's my friend."
Where's Mother?
He says nothing.
I slide my hands up and around his back, feeling the hard ridges of his ribcage, his spine and shoulder blades. He is all sharp angles. Only the globes of his arse are round and smooth, and I revel in the touch, in something I am finally allowed to.
... your shock, rendering you unable to resist...
Leaning against the door, I throw my head back, observing the scene. Three couples are standing in the middle, surrounded by a cheering crowd. Glued to each other in a kiss, they are fiercely making out under the giant sphere of Mistletoe, while people around are spurring them on.
And proved me wrong, slashing me open from neck to hip with a single whip of his wand.
It smelled odd. Not bad, but
and leave the bathroom.
If Snape can enter the house, surely others can.
Holding your glass in your outstretched hand, you carefully lowered yourself on the sofa, letting him snuggle into you with a contented sigh.
I grip at the fabric and tug, pulling it over his head, and he raises his arms to help me.
This is all I can hope for now. "Thank you."
“Does it hurt badly?”
It sounds like French, but I always assumed it to be some fancy made up name.
I don't know why he addresses me. Probably because it was I who stole it, or because I am the nearest one to the chicken right now. Or maybe because he thinks I have to be the one to do the dirty work.
The envelope bore the capital
"I know." He nods. "I remember." He releases my hand and turns away, breaking into a run down the corridor.
"No." He shakes his head. "It's not me, Harry, sorry..."
alone, you've already done enough shit."
He opens the door, leading me in, and by the smell of it, by the empty echo of our footsteps against the tiled floor, I realise we are in the locker room.
"Ron!" Granger sounded scandalised.
"Yes."
anyway, it's not like there would be much difference."
Unfolding a piece of paper, he begins to read: "I am a married man, and cannot wish for a better wife than merciful God bestowed me with."
"Ron," Harry repeats, and Weasley looks up.
They move past our bench, and when I think they’re in a safe distance…
“Maybe I want to?” I reply. “I’m of age, Hermione, free to do whatever.”
Next time, I open my eyes to my Mother. Her head rests against the back of the armchair, she breathes quietly in her sleep. I realise that the pain has subsided and it's now a steady, dull throb rather than the sharp stinging I felt waking up for the first time.
He releases me, placing my hand back on the bannisters. "Take care, mate."
"Yes, Master." He takes the vial from my open palm. "Kreacher is put the vial. Vial is on the bedside table now."
"You don't have to go," he says quietly, and my heart drops, "you may stay here and wait for me." He squeezes my hand.
I wrench it open and demand
Someone whistles, making me look up. Parkinson bursts into giggles.
"Yes." Potter turns away. "We have to get out of here." His voice sounds... not like his voice. There's nothing in it.
happens, Harry, do you understand? You must promise me to protect him in the end. You will Ennervate him, get him out of here and hide him. It is my wish, Harry, and my command."
Last night after dinner, an owl was waiting on the windowsill of our dorm. As soon as I entered, it swooped down on my shoulder, and my heart swooped again. My palms prickling, I grabbed the letter. There was only one word on the envelope:
Falling-falling-falling— Sudden coolness shocks me back to my senses, I can't breathe. Ice filling my lungs like water, I look up. A roaring fire is swimming above… I let myself drown.…
“Let’s go?” I say, reaching out with my hand to find him because he has fallen suddenly quiet.
"Luna's father wore it at the wedding, and also -
He's in jeans and a plain T-shirt, and his haircut is a bit different: shorter at the sides, longer at the top, unruly fringe falling over his eyebrow. He looks good.
"Harry, he's
Overall I'm fine; as fine as I can be.
His chest is smooth, but for scarce hairs, coarse against my lips.

He made it easy.
about it. About him. Like that. The way I did all this time. No, I didn't think. I never did. Never admitted it even to myself. I just felt it all. Have been feeling. All the time. And I do now. I can't not. I wish I could. How can I? When it's his voice and his smell and laughter. His touch. His footsteps that I've learned to recognise out of hundreds. His presence - always there, always a breath away. My hand in the crook of his elbow, my feet moving to the rhythm of his footsteps…
Annoyed, I follow the two of them with my eyes all the way to the Slytherin table.
I say nothing. There’s a shuffle of him rummaging in his bag before his movements finally stop. We sit. McGonagall talks. Running my fingers over my quill, I hear the moment when he starts taking notes, his quill faintly scratching over the parchment. I imagine McGonagall’s words in ink, neatly appearing in rows of his steady handwriting. Every time he moves, a whiff of his cologne reaches me, and I can’t say it’s entirely unpleasant. Fresh and clear and bright, it reminds me of clean winter air on a sunny day, or maybe of the salty spray of the wind over the sea. I don’t know. And dry wood? Something fancy and barely there. If it weren’t Malfoy, I would’ve asked what it was, and even maybe purchased it - not to wear, no. To keep it in my room. What a creepy thought. The smell is so
I smile faintly.
he gasps, when I grip him around the middle. "I can't breathe."
When I enter the kitchen in the morning, it's nine o'clock, and Potter has already left.
"Yes, the project. The application is to be handed in two days, you know…"
Taking a few steadying breaths, I close my eyes and still, evoking memories, letting them wash over me. When they come, they are not memories - not
"It is nine and a half in the evening." Kreacher's bony fingers close around my wrist. There's a jerk and a tug and a short swirl. My arse lands on the bed, and Kreacher releases his grip on my arm.
I'm shaking with relief.
"In my vision I was
"Where is he?" I croak.
"There was this

"No, really?" He says.
"Draco, I—"
do. I have always been opposed to your Mother's liberal ways of handling you. And...
You never did.
"You're an arse."
“No.” I sit up. “I’ll go with you.”
"Where?"
Down in the Common Room, Zabini rises on his feet. Malfoy is saying something to him, leaning over the desk. Parkinson sits down, placing her hand on Malfoy's tilted up arse, giving it a pat.
"The house?" I will finally bring my breath under control.
The one thing I want - no one is able to give me.
"It's done with a wand," he said, "but nothing prevents you from doing it wandlessly. Look." Without a warning, he took my hand, pressing it to the parchment. "Now, the spell is
"Snape killed him," I finish for him, feeling nothing, nothing at all, only numbness.
There's no way of persuading her, I know. The only one whose opinion matters is Potter.
"Your Father and I had a row," she said, sitting down at the foot of your bed.
It slams into my palm, and I am urged to spring to my feet and turn around and... see a glimpse of Harry's hair down the next aisle. My heart hammering, I dash forward and find him before a chest of drawers. He lifts something that looks like an old crown or something off the marble bust of an old man, or woman, or... someone.
“You all surely expect me to talk about formalities that should be undergone regarding your additional year at Hogwarts, and there is no doubt that I intend to do it later.” McGonagall’s voice rings, clear and strict as usual. “But for now, just let me tell you how happy I am to welcome each and every one of you back to Hogwarts. I want to thank those who, despite everything, decided to return and finish their education this year.”
"I'm going to keep it," he says. "In case you throw another stupid tantrum and disappear."
"Sorry." He drops his hand. "Sorry, it's not," he whispers, "I won't touch you, unless you tell me to."
A shimmering white streak of light erupts from McGonagall's wand, but Snape blocks it, as well as several other spells sent in his direction by the Order members. He grips the hem of his cloak and makes a sudden weird movement, swooping it in front of him... with a swirl, a black misty mass rises in the air where Snape just stood. To gasps and outraged cries, it swooshes higher and higher to the ceiling, until it breaks through the round stained glass window below the roof and is gone.
"I know."
"Yes." My throat is dry.
"Dunno." I shrugged. "Just heard the name the other day."
"What?"
He opens his eyes. We look at each other for an eternity, until he stands up.
"I mean… you can either take it now or wait till tomorrow night. But don't drag it out for too long. Its properties stay intact within the next 72 hours. I've just finished it."
"Midnight," Weasley says, "Mum always said midnight."
I reply,
Ginny sways her schoolbag, hitting him across the head, which sends him, stumbling, onto the desk.
Damn.
"No, the.... the Dark Lor-" My sob eats the name away.
"My only son and heir is a
"Leave the party so soon."
He drops my arm and there's a pop of the vial being uncorked before cool glass presses to my lips. I cover his hand with mine over the vial and tip the contents into my mouth. Done.
— No, wait... I don't think I would.
"Fuck... you're

"Waking you up, you're going to be late for classes."
"Are you
"Do it."
"It's not about my project or my NEWTs, you dimwit." He approaches. "And not about how your blindness feels to
I feel utterly useless. In the evenings, I used to retreat to the living room balcony - to stay out of the way. Just like now. I sit on the floor with my back to the wall and listen to the whispering of trees in the dark back garden. I don't know how long I've been sitting like that. Hours. I inhale deeply. The air is sweet with summer and reminds me of the Manor gardens and our strolls with Mother in the twilight.
"Scared I may figure out whom you fancy?" I laugh, though it's not a joke. I'm dead serious, and I would give anything to know.
"Of course. If you want."
"Fuck!" I jump. "Are you mental? Next time warn me, okay?"
“Oh, shut up.” I wiggle out of his grip and lower myself back down on the carpet.
Staring at him in horror, you shook your head. If you had words, you would have told him everything, but you had none.
"No, he didn't." Harry shakes his head. "I saw his mind, just before he was almost upon us. The snake was focused entirely on me, it was never aware you were there, too."
With a wave of his hand, a pile of blue and green brochures landed on your lap.
"You are naked," he whispers. His breath smells of wine.
There’s a pause, but then his fingers brush mine, taking the quill out of my hand. “Thanks.”
We try it outside. On the grounds, by the Lake, near the Quidditch pitch. It never works.
You didn't know how you felt about it. Father was being released on bail, on a sum huge enough to buy another Manor. The sum, Mother said, had cost almost everything from the Malfoy vaults. It allowed your Father to shorten his term in Azkaban from ten years to four.
"He'll run off and take the Cloak with him!" Weasley insisted.
We had agreed that I would return to Grimmauld after the hearing.
I am so hard, too.
Harry stands next to me with his wand drawn.
It's so embarrassing to have this conversation with Potter, but tonight he seems to be in a rare mood for talking, and I don't mind. I'm fed up with silence. Let him talk. I prop my chin on my hand.
Reaching out, I find my satchel, pull it off the chair and drop it at my feet under the desk.
He angles closer.
"We have been able to deduce the nature of your condition, Mr. Potter. We presume it has to do with your - hmmm - shall we say - past affinity to Mr. Tom Riddle."
Aunt Bella knocks Greyback off his feet with a spell and strides to his prone form. "Answer, dog!"
"Because you are a better person, have always been," I finally say, “better than I, and...
"She's no longer my girlfriend. We broke up." I don't know why I'm telling him this.
that's the term.
I stood under the scalding shower for an eternity, feeling as though I would never be clean. I’d had to remember the
I head over to pick up the locket where I hang it last night and stop dead: the locket is not there. My heart gives a jolt, and I dash outside to find Malfoy. With his back to me, he is sitting cross-legged on the ground. His hair has grown long; soft curls fall on his neck but do not yet reach his shoulders. Sunlight gleams golden in the wavy strands, I've never noticed it before.
"What? Then why?.."
"Surprise!" Potter grins. "I started to fulfil your project. It seems like the house likes it."
I lean back against the foot of the bed and close my eyes.
"Okay, that's fair," he says, "I'll go." His footsteps head across the room.
