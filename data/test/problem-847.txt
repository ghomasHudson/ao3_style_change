After some quick goodbyes with Andromeda and handing off Teddy, Harry wove his way though the remaining students with Draco’s hand in his. His nerves had begun to mount. It wasn’t so much that he was frightened of
Harry filled him in quickly on what they had spoken of during the class. He even added, for good measure, how well their potion came out. He wasn’t sure when, but at some point while he was talking, he drifted into sleep.
“You sound much too cheerful about that,” Harry responded. A strange warmth was pooling in his stomach, though. Sure, Hogwarts was undeniably different. But perhaps it was still home.
By the end of the day, he was so tired he was ready to drop – but he still had at least three essays to work on, not to mention the amount of reading and lesson planning he needed to get done,
Harry nudged Draco to move over, and they shuffled to the foot of his bed so they could see the Gryffindors better, but also weren’t so close to them. Pansy and Blaise followed suit. Then, the room descended into an awkward silence.
It was hard to fight what I’ve learned – to learn new ways to live and see the world. Did you know that muggles have been to the moon? I did not. I think that is fascinating. Even with all the magic at our hands, wizards have never even dreamt of entering space. I am dithering, though.
“What happened, anyway?” he asked, turning back to Andromeda. “I remember fighting with Ron and Hermione…” he trailed off with a sigh.
Pansy gave him a long-suffering look. “I will be outside your door for five minutes, then I’m coming back in and dragging you out, whether you like it or not.”
Harry let his eyes wander around the room – belatedly realizing that Andromeda was supposed to be here with Teddy. He felt panic clutch his chest, briefly, when he didn’t seem them immediately. He had been late to the start of the Feast, albeit only slightly – what if they had decided not to come and he hadn’t even noticed. Draco must have realized his panic, because he squeezed Harry’s knee and nodded towards the staff table. Sure enough, Andy was seated near the end, beside Professor Sinstra, with baby Teddy in her arms.
But it couldn’t be his head, not when it was clearly his magic. Perhaps it was trying to right a wrong. Harry had died, after all. He shouldn’t be alive. The universe was imbalanced, his magic knew it. It was trying to kill him.
He let Draco kiss his shoulder while he tapped his head, the feeling of cold water running down him countered by Draco’s warm body and warm kiss made Harry shudder. In that moment, he knew two different things to be true.
“I want to get Muggle Studies out of the way,” Blaise said with a sigh. “No use in putting it until the last minute and then not being able to graduate after all this.”
“When will Ron and Hermione be at Hogwarts?” Andromeda directed the question at both of them, although of course Draco would have no way of knowing the answer.
“Obviously,” Draco responded, but he rolled his eyes, which Harry was grateful for. He was significantly too tired to figure out how to react to sarcasm right now.
As they sat, Harry looked up to see Neville had abandoned his seat to make his say over to them. He pulled up a seat besdie Harry and perched himself gingerly upon it, looking around furtively as if worried he’d be seen. Harry gavce a glance around the room, but mostly people were talking amongst themselves. The only ones wo were looking were Dean and Seamus, which Harry expected, and Zacharias Smith. Harry saw out of the corner of his eye all three Slytherin’s lean in closely towards Neville and Harry.
But those were the Days Before, and this was now. He had changed, in the Days After. He hoped that the others, Neville, Dean, and Seamus, would be able to change, too. Hoped that they all would do better.
“Let me go, then,” Harry responded, giving Draco another small kiss on the forehead. “I’ll be quick.”
Draco’s hand came up to cup Harry’s cheek and he turned into it, kissing the other boy’s palm. Draco withdrew his hand, leaning down instead to press a slow kiss to Harry’s lips. “You don’t owe the world anything,” Draco said against his mouth. “You didn’t need to stay, you never had to. No one would have been angry if you had…gone on.”
“Lots of reasons,” Draco said. “At least I’d imagine. There’s the risk of exposing muggle children to magic, for one thing.”
“Kind of, yeah,” Harry agreed. He wanted to touch her hand, hold it still, but was fairly certain that was the wrong thing to do. “Mary was being sarcastic. She was trying to be mean to you.”
girl in the corridors to attack her for revenge? What’s the curse going to be? I heard you have a pretty mean cruciatus. I know your stupid
“Stop being melodramatic,” Pansy chastised him. She was running her fingers through his hair, which he typically found quite relaxing, but today it made his insides squirm. “They’re Gryffindors, they’re the most
They fell silent, looking at each other over the desk. Minerva was the first to break, looking down at her clasped hands and away from Harry’s face.
“I don’t stick my nose in other people’s business,” Harry responded mulishly. Minerva just raised an eyebrow at him as if he were a misbehaving first year. It almost made him feel like a misbehaving first year. “What kind of person would I be,” he said after a moment, “if I didn’t speak up for the people who needed it? I have a voice, I have to use it somehow.”
“Um,” she said, nervously glancing at Ron and Hermione as if only just noticing their presence. Harry gave her an encouraging smile. “Well, I told her she was pretty and then she said if I was acting like a dyke she could make me look like one,” Harry did his best to stifle a gasp. Or groan. He wasn’t sure. “But I didn’t know what that word meant, so I asked and she said I needed shorter hair, and I told her I always wanted short hair but mum never let me, and she said that if I met her in the charms room after curfew she’d cut it for me.”
Harry didn’t respond, couldn’t, could only whimper as Draco bent down again, kissing his chest, rolling a nipple between his teeth, made Harry arch into him with a needy keen. His hands were tangled above him, stuck in his sweater, and he could barely focus as Draco reached above him, hardly recognized that his hands were being tied above his head against the bedframe.
“That’s awfully poetic, Potter,” Pansy said in response. She sniffed and looked away, as if in indifference, but Harry was fairly sure he could see a tear escape one of her eyes.
“With all due respect,” she said, sounding as if she held not an ounce of respect for the man. It made Harry grin in spite of himself. “His magical core is dangerously depleted. It seems even using magic may be a danger to him. Surely you realized this.”
from.” Her mouth had twisted in a line, but she looked distraught. And honestly, for someone who was supposedly the brightest witch of their age, she was being gratingly obtuse right now.
Ron and Hermione’s eyes were on him again, Harry could feel it. This time, they didn’t look away when he looked up. Hermione gave him a small smile, even from the distance across the table he could see her eyes glistening. Ron nodded, his arm firmly around Hermione’s shoulders, and even Neville gave him a funny look. Harry was hit with a feeling of
“Erm – hi,” Harry said. It was a strange moment, where he longed for the Days Before when he could talk to his friends without any awkwardness or shame. He was a product of the Days After now, hardly thought about the Days Before anymore.
Pansy’s eyes lit up and she leaned forward towards them. “Apparently, McGonagall is making an announcement tonight, and he may or may not have let slip what that exact announcement will be.”
But those were the Days Before, and this was now. He had changed, in the Days After. He hoped that the others, Neville, Dean, and Seamus, would be able to change, too. Hoped that they all would do better.
Harry winced. “I’d like to think it would have been different if I had been here, but I know nothing would have changed.” He sighed. “All summer Andromeda had to remind me that we were still kids when it all happened. I’ve used Unforgivables, I’ve killed people, I doubt any of us were charming to you lot either, when we were in our younger years.”
Pansy gave him a long-suffering look. “I will be outside your door for five minutes, then I’m coming back in and dragging you out, whether you like it or not.”
“Nope!” Mar said, emphasizing the word with a popping noise on the P. Ron wrinkled his nose, Harry saw out of the corner of his eye, which made him bristle with protectiveness.
“Secondly, you’ll be choosing your partners for the rest of the year today before you enter the classroom. You will do all your potions work with them, from your brewing to your assignments. Potions is not a solitary field and I do not believe it should be solitary in the classroom either. You will be able to enter today once you have chosen your partner and have seen me to have your names written down. Your partner cannot be someone in your own year. Eighth years, please partner with seventh years. If anyone is left over at the end we will go from there.”
Harry just shook his head. “We were supposed to straight to see them. And Pansy knows, Draco. She always knows.”
“Lastly, I would like to introduce everyone to our new staff this year. Professor Slughorn has unfortunately decided to retire, so we will be welcoming a new potions professor – Professor Stone has been hired to fill his post.” A friendly looking woman in earth-green robes stood to wave to the students. She seemed fairly young, although looking across the high table it seemed as though there were quite a few young professors this year.
The two Gryffindors scrambled towards the door. In other circumstances, Draco would have laughed at the display, so cowardly for people who were considered so brave, but he just sagged down in relief as they left. Blaise moved, coming to sit beside him on Harry’s bed.
Harry nuzzled his neck. “They don’t know I’m out yet,” he said, revelling in the noise Draco made when he bit the tender skin by his Adam’s apple.
After some quick goodbyes with Andromeda and handing off Teddy, Harry wove his way though the remaining students with Draco’s hand in his. His nerves had begun to mount. It wasn’t so much that he was frightened of
lost people, Smith. I don’t blame her; neither should anyone else.” He turned his voice, then, to the crowd that had gathered around them. Most of them looked slightly incredulous. Hannah Abbott was looking rapidly between Harry and Zacharias. Neville and Dean were standing to the side, speaking with each other in rapid whispers. Nott looked distinctly uncomfortable, but was standing resolutely near Neville and Dean.
At the same time, he knew it had been lenient – being confined to Hogwarts hadn’t been true punishment, not really, even if his only sources of conversation had been limited to McGonagall, Flitwick, and Slughorn.
“To fill the Muggle Studies post, we have Professor Strickland.” A lady in muggle clothes stood up and waved to the crowd. A rush of mutters went around the room, including from Pansy, who nudged him.
Neville sighed. “Look, I just wanted to say that I’ll do my best to keep Smith off you in the common room, but I can’t promise anything. He’s angry.”
He still hadn’t told the three Slytherins about it. He was beginning to feel that they might be angry with him for hiding it from them. He wasn’t exactly sure why he hadn’t told them, either. There was no
“Arithmancy,” he said dully, “although I don’t really care.” He took a sip of what must have been coffee – hadn’t touched a bite of breakfast, Harry noticed.
They began moving again, now surrounded by the group of Hufflepuffs. Harry tried not to let the noise upset him, but it did – the talking, the chatter; it grated on him. Before long he felt like his skin was crawling on his bones. His ears were ringing, skin was itching, and even the steadying presence of Draco’s hand on his did nothing to quell the panic.
Mar gave Harry an eager wave as the four friends scrambled out of the common room to get to the Great Hall on time. Somehow, though, Harry didn’t think this was going to be the last time they were going to discuss the issue.
“You are,” Harry pushed, hoping his tone came off teasing. He looked over when Draco didn’t respond, to see the other man stubbornly looking at the wall instead of Harry. His right hand was back to playing with his left forearm.
A plate with food was shoved into his lap, Pomfrey telling him to eat as much as he could. And he found, for the first time in a while, that he was truly hungry. “Where’s Draco?” he asked as he ate.
“Your magic, though,” Andromeda said, only a smile to acknowledge his words. “I do believe the healers are correct, but so are you.”
As it turned out, finding Ron and Hermione was a relatively fruitless endeavour. It wasn’t that Harry didn’t find them, they were seated in the middle of the common room. It was more that they were surrounded on all sides by people who had missed them and wanted to catch up. Harry didn’t begrudge them that, not really, in the Days Before he would have joined. But now – well, no one liked him now, that was part of it – he was too shaken from his nightmare to handle a crowd of that size.
“You and I have to plan for welcoming the Slytherins this evening,” Pansy said, then. “I was thinking we could after lunch. Draco and Blaise can help us.”
“Secondly, you’ll be choosing your partners for the rest of the year today before you enter the classroom. You will do all your potions work with them, from your brewing to your assignments. Potions is not a solitary field and I do not believe it should be solitary in the classroom either. You will be able to enter today once you have chosen your partner and have seen me to have your names written down. Your partner cannot be someone in your own year. Eighth years, please partner with seventh years. If anyone is left over at the end we will go from there.”
Harry just shook his head. “We were supposed to straight to see them. And Pansy knows when we’ve been snogging, Draco. She always knows.”
“I may have told them I’d hold onto your wand, and Zabini’s, too.” He placed his two friends’ wands down on Draco’s desk, trying not to laugh at the shocked look on Pansy’s face.
Hermione sat up and scrubbed at her face. For a strange moment, Harry thought she was just going to get up and walk out of the kitchen - away from him. But instead she leaned into his side and let him wrap his arm around her. It reminded him startlingly of camping in the Forest of Dean, just the two of them against the world.
She cast him a disparaging look. “Yes,” she said. Then, after a moment’s pause – “No.” Then “Yes,” again. She sighed. He took a moment to look at her – properly. She had cut her hair short over the summer – shorter than it had ever been. It now reached just to the bottom of her ears. She looked tired, the bags under her eyes more pronounced than he had ever seen them. But then again, wasn’t that true for them all?
In the Days Before, Harry would have bristled at the nickname. Now he just shrugged. “Wasn’t expecting you,” he said dully, not quite looking at Malfoy’s eyes.
“No,” Draco ground out again, supressing a shudder. He had been hurt in exchange for his refusal, been punished while he was at the Manor for Christmas, and then again for Easter.
Ron scoffed – actually scoffed. Hermione looked almost frightened, but she would back Ron up no matter what came out of his mouth, Harry knew. “You were also fucking him long before we came back to Hogwarts,” Ron said, finally. “Or did you think we’ve forgotten?”
She paused a moment, as if to consider. She was tapping her fingers rapidly against her leg as she thought, and it made Harry’s chest feel tight – as though he should be running or moving or doing
onto your arm, Hermione. You are the brightest witch of our age, you deserve everything you have earned because you have earned it on sheer talent and wit.
“I think it’s that we’re the same, honestly,” Harry said. “Not completely,” he added at Hermione’s raised eyebrows. “It’s just…I never had a choice. Voldemort made the choice for me when I was a baby. And then Dumbledore, The Order…they made the rest of the choices. But Voldemort made Draco’s choices too. Voldemort, his dad, you know? And Draco understands what it’s like, to be forced into situations you had no control of and have to deal with the consequences.”
Neither of them lasted long – although whatever Draco had said about exertion was entirely untrue. Harry felt spent – not that it was a bad feeling, but it wasn’t as though he could tell Madame Pomfrey that he had broken her orders by having sex in the shower with Draco Malfoy.
Harry ran an almost aggravated, definitely frustrated hand through his hair. “You’re the one who kissed me,” he grumbled.
When he died, he had seen the tortured part of Voldemort’s soul die along with him, heard Dumbledore tell him that it was past saving, watched the pain it exhibited. Nobody at Hogwarts was past saving, but they all had tortured souls, now. In the Days After, with Andromeda’s help, Harry was able to find that tortured part of his soul. He couldn’t heal it – was unsure if it would ever be healed, but he felt it contract whenever he thought of those who died, whenever he heard a loud noise, whenever someone raised their wand at him. Andromeda had said being aware of it was half the battle of healing it, but Harry didn’t think it could be healed – not really.
He was sure he had wanted to say more, something about how Ron and Hermione were leaving, how Ginny would barely look at him, and how the quiet at Andromeda’s house was oppressive. About how every time he looked at Teddy he was filled with love greater than anything he could have ever imagined and grief stronger than a tidal wave. About how he dreamed of having the luxury to have stayed dead. About how different the Days After Harry was than the Days before Harry. About how beautiful Draco looked in the moonlight.
“Potter, are you absolutely mental? They’ll hurt him, he can’t even use a wand!” she had jumped up and had a hand on the door already, looking particularly murderous.
“That’s bollocks and you know it,” Harry hissed. He opened his mouth to say more but was interrupted by a squeal.
Ravenclaw,” Mar said, as if it were the coolest thing in the world. “I told her she was pretty, and she said she’d cut my hair for me, and I really want it shorter.”
“You’re not upset?” Harry asked, incredulous. He would be upset if his movements were being tracked, spells monitored, conversations listened to.
Harry was uncomfortable thinking about how Ron and Hermione would fit into this dynamic when they returned. Would they join him, Pansy, Blaise, and Draco for their walks around the castle? Shuffle themselves into their group to make sure no one went anywhere alone? He hadn’t told them anything about Draco, had been scared to. Would they fall in, instead, with Zacharias Smith? No, definitely not that, but perhaps with Dean, Seamus, Neville, and Nott. In the Days Before, he would have been sure of where they stood. In the Days After, he wasn’t quite sure about very many things anymore.
to become a parent to her grandson. And with Harry gone…he tried not to feel guilty, because of course he should have come back to Hogwarts, but he did. If only he could have delayed a couple years, waited until Teddy was older, and then come back; it would be easier on Andy to care for an older child. It could have been possible, too, if he were anyone other than, well, the
“Heard you exploded,” said a voice from across from him. He looked up to see a seventh year prefect, Michael, looking at him in amusement. The prefects Harry knew better – he and Pansy were often coordinating with them over patrols and the time they spent in the Slytherin common room.
“Okay, Mar,” Harry said. He gave her his best interpretation of a friendly smile. The whole group of children looked less scared now, more eager to be here, as if her words and confidence had broken whatever emotions were keeping them scared or subdued.
And maybe, there was a chance they could change that, starting now. They were all children in a war, after all. Andromeda had said that to him often.
They began moving again, now surrounded by the group of Hufflepuffs. Harry tried not to let the noise upset him, but it did – the talking, the chatter; it grated on him. Before long he felt like his skin was crawling on his bones. His ears were ringing, skin was itching, and even the steadying presence of Draco’s hand on his did nothing to quell the panic.
“This is exhausting,” Pansy groaned from beside Harry. Their first week of classes at Hogwarts was complete, but instead of the weekend being the respite from work they all needed already, Harry was burying himself in lesson plans while Pansy was wading her way through a thick and unfriendly looking Dark Arts book.
“When will they realize, though?” Harry asked. “Anyone dangerous is in Azkaban. The rest are serving house arrest sentences, like Draco and his mum. These laws won’t do anything but control family and friends of Death Eaters that had nothing to do with the war.”
“Um,” she said, nervously glancing at Ron and Hermione as if only just noticing their presence. Harry gave her an encouraging smile. “Well, I told her she was pretty and then she said if I was acting like a dyke she could make me look like one,” Harry did his best to stifle a gasp. Or groan. He wasn’t sure. “But I didn’t know what that word meant, so I asked and she said I needed shorter hair, and I told her I always wanted short hair but mum never let me, and she said that if I met her in the charms room after curfew she’d cut it for me.”
He was exceptionally grateful, then, to find tea and toast waiting for him in the spare classroom he and the Headmistress met in. She held a deep hatred for the portraits of the ex-headmasters and their constant need to give opinions, so they hardly ever met in her actual office. Harry wasn’t even certain if she ever used it.
“That isn’t how it works,” Andromeda said, almost immediately. It wasn’t the response Harry had been expecting, but she went on before he could say anything. “You’re right that Life and Death weren’t balanced when you died. But you’re forgetting the piece of Voldemort that died with you. Something did die and it did restore the balance, Harry. Horcruxes are old magic - I don’t know much about them, but old magic always comes with a price. It is too wild to use lightly.” She took a sip from her tea and gave him a gentle look. “Life and Death always require balance, and it was you who restored that balance after Voldemort disrupted it. I daresay Death owes you a favour.”
“Alright,” he said gently. “Well, the older students have a lot of studying to do. Would you be able to hunt for fish outside?”
“I think it’s that we’re the same, honestly,” Harry said. “Not completely,” he added at Hermione’s raised eyebrows. “It’s just…I never had a choice. Voldemort made the choice for me when I was a baby. And then Dumbledore, The Order…they made the rest of the choices. But Voldemort made Draco’s choices too. Voldemort, his dad, you know? And Draco understands what it’s like, to be forced into situations you had no control of and have to deal with the consequences.”
Draco continued to look at him expectantly, so Harry sighed and continued speaking. “We fought badly over the summer. About – a lot of things, I guess. But I think we fixed it today, a bit. So really, there’s nothing to worry about. We’re just…sort of friends.”
Harry turned an amused look downward to where Draco was lying. “I do?” he asked pointedly. Draco merely smiled innocently at him.
He followed the crowd inside, sticking close to Draco, Parkinson, and Zabini. He felt a kinship with them; it was definitely strange, seeing as how Pansy had all but offered him to Voldemort during the Battle. But they were subdued; he could feel the anxiety from all of them, mirroring his own. He no longer had it in him to be boisterous, not in the Days After. Maybe he truly had belonged in Slytherin all along. Or maybe, as Andromeda had said, grief had changed him.
“We’re late for breakfast,” he said, by way of greeting. Harry sat up quickly at that, shock coursing through his system.
“I wasn’t really…” Harry started, but trailed off at the look Pansy gave him. “I’m sorry, Pans,” he said with a sigh, finally.
*small note, the title of the chapter is not from a poem as Pansy implies, but rather part of the song they sing at Dumbledore's funeral in the movie, lol
“You put him there,” Ron said finally. “He would never be working on that if it hadn’t been for you.”
“Give that to me,” Malfoy said suddenly. He took the lighter and cigarette from Harry’s hands, suprisingly gently. With one hand, he delicately placed the end in Harry’s mouth. With the other, he flicked the lighter to light it.
Harry grinned. “Wingardium Leviosa,” he said. “My first day in Charms. And then Ron used it to defeat the mountain troll.”
“Drink this,” said another voice somewhere past the foot of his bed. Madame Pomfrey bustled into view, potion vial in hand.
Harry didn’t bother to comment. It wasn’t as if he had never been an exception to the norm before. And it wasn’t as though he had never escaped certain injury – or even certain death – before.
Well, that explained it. “Can I still teach?” Harry asked. He turned to look imploringly at McGonagall.
He glanced around furtively before reaching into his jeans pocket and pulling out a cigarette and a lighter. There were charms for this, of course, but his magic had been unstable to say the least in the Days After; once he had set fire to Andromeda’s back garden, so for now he stuck to lighters.
The sorting passed quickly – there were fewer students this year than any other year. Blaise, who had actually been watching the sorting, pointed out that Gryffindor hadn’t even been given a single new student, while somehow Slytherin had half the incoming first years.
“Today is also a day for grief,” the Headmistress continued, finally. “As we mourn for those who cannot be here with us, for those who will not be waiting for us at home, for those who’s memories still exist in our hearts.
“You’re right,” said Harry, drawing a surprised look from Blaise. Which was mildly hurtful, he thought. Surely they’d know how he’d feel about this better by now. “I’m going to go talk to her, make sure there’s a Slytherin for the Slytherins.”
I believe the first thing I learned about was chemistry. I think she knew I would like it, given my affinity for potions. Did you know muggles can do with ordinary ingredients and no magic what we do with potions? She taught me about muggle universities after that, when I expressed interest. Did you know the ministry has a branch that prepares wizards for muggle universities from Hogwarts? I will never get to go that route, I know the ministry would not help me in that endeavour. But it is something I consider. Professor Strickland has been helpful.
Harry nudged Draco to move over, and they shuffled to the foot of his bed so they could see the Gryffindors better, but also weren’t so close to them. Pansy and Blaise followed suit. Then, the room descended into an awkward silence.
This was the aftermath, he realized, of a group of children left to fend for themselves. This was the aftermath of having only the older Slytherins left to protect them. The aftermath of the people who were supposed to protect them leaving them to fend for themselves. Harry was sure there was more than just this, too – more than the visible results of experiencing a war in their own school. There would be nightmares and panic, walking through the halls and seeing the ghosts of their friends – the Slytherin students would experience it just as severely as any other students.
They had gone back to the eighth year dorms, after, Draco trailing behind Harry and Pansy. He had been fiddling again with his left forearm, Harry had noticed. But Draco hadn’t seemed to want to address it or acknowledge it, so the group of three spent the walk back acting as though they were all fine. Blaise was there when they got back, and without preamble or discussion they had pulled the mattresses, blankets, and pillows to the floor before the four of them curled up; talking quietly until the early hours of the morning.
“It’s alright, you daft idiot,” Pansy said from his side. Her voice sounded far away – it was the feeling that was becoming familiar to Harry, since coming back to Hogwarts. As if everyone was on the other side of a long tunnel, and no matter how hard he tried he couldn’t quite get back.
– Neville could have been him, could have been the one targeted by Voldemort, the one who had to die. It could have always been like this, Harry in Slytherin with Draco and Pansy and Blaise, and Neville tromping around the castle and getting into trouble with Ron and Hermione. It felt
Neville looked like he was going to be sick, but was the first to speak up. “No problems, Headmisstress. I was just going.”
Draco turned to look at him, grey eyes crinkling at the corners. “No,” he admitted, “but I can see your shadow.”
. You see, despite being raised my whole life to despise muggles, I had never met a single one. Not until the war, at any rate. And even then, although you may think I am lying, I’ve never hurt one. Not because I’m particularly noble, but because I believed that muggles are so pathetic that it would be like kicking a puppy. I learned about guns this summer, and nuclear weapons.
Harry kissed Draco slowly. Tried to convey what he couldn’t with words; how Draco was essential to him, how being with him felt like breathing again after suffocating for so long. Draco responded in kind, lifting his body against Harry’s, biting at Harry’s lip, making him groan. Before Harry could form a coherent thought, his mind was exploding with stars, and his heart with tenderness.
Predictably, Gryffindor cheered. The man who stood up and waved also seemed quite young, although older than the two other professors that had been introduced. He was rather handsome, too, Harry thought – quite tall, with sandy blonde hair and broad shoulders. He certainly
Harry was transfixed on the two of them. Neville had gone ghostly white, Pansy was flushed and shaking.
“Not everyone can afford a tutor,” Pansy said, looking at him levelly. “And some parents don’t have the time to teach from home themselves.”
“I’m not spending anything near the amount of time on my hair that Draco does in the mornings,” Harry said. “That’s too much work.”
Well, that explained it. “Can I still teach?” Harry asked. He turned to look imploringly at McGonagall.
That was, perhaps, an understatement. But Harry kept that thought to himself, at least. “Did something happen?” He asked instead.
There aren’t any answers for this, either. Did you know that there are wizards in the Department of Mysteries studying genetics and magic? I would like to work there one day, I think. My point is – perhaps we will find out muggle blood does
By the time they entered the Great Hall, he was on high alert – every sound making him jump and shake. Draco was still holding his hand on one side and Blaise had materialized on the other, both keeping him steady. Pansy was ahead of them, saying goodbye to the Hufflepuffs as well as a couple Ravenclaws that had joined along the way.
They didn’t have to wear uniforms yet, since they were the only students in the school, so Harry pulled on a soft sweater and some jeans. He ran a quick hand through his hair before giving up on attempting to neaten it altogether. He was pulling a quill and some parchment out of his trunk, with half his mind set on writing Andromeda a letter over breakfast, just as Pansy stepped back in.
Harry nodded absently to Draco and instead turned his head to Andromeda. “Would you like help with the washing up?”
McGonagall rubbed her temples and gave a glance heavenword before continuing. “Very well, Ms Parkinson. We have decided that this rule will be broken for the Slytherin house alone.”
“Alright?” Draco asked quietly, breath on Harry’s back, body pressed against him under the pressure of the water. Harry could only let out a strangled sort of gasp in response.
Harry hung back as Madame Pomfrey asked for directions from a tall, grumpy looking mediwizard. Harry made eye contact with the man accidentally, but his eyes only widened and then he looked away from Harry with a grimace and an eye-roll. Harry couldn’t help but smirk - it would have irked him in the Days Before, no doubt, to be looked at as if he were a piece of dirt on someone’s shoe, but now he found it preferable. A side effect of death, perhaps? Or a side effect of spending eighteen years of his life constantly in the newspapers, feeling like he had to fight for people’s favour.
“It is when you’re annoying me,” Draco said without malice. Harry shuddered as Draco’s lips found his neck.
“You don’t — fuck, Harry, you act like you exist in a little bubble but you don’t.” She hiccoughed, and a hovering elf took that moment to make two cups of tea appear in front of them. Harry took a polite sip. He really wasn’t sure if he could stomach any more tea today.
“No one else needed saving!” Weasley exclaimed. “It’s not like the Carrows were hurting pure-bloods. The DA were the only ones standing up to them, no one would have gotten hurt after they left.” To Draco’s satisfaction, he sounded unsure as he finished talking.
Draco sat up as Potter approached the group of three, not bothering to hide his smile as he left his friends behind him. “I’m going to pretend I never heard that,” he said with an amused glance at Pansy. She shrugged unabashedly, and Draco felt a strange surge of warmth for them both.
The rest of the week passed in a blur of much too much homework for a school year that had yet to even start. Harry met with McGonagall four times, directly after breakfast. He had chosen her to shadow to do his best to learn what running a school was like. So far, it was simply a mess of boring paperwork. He had met with Binns four times, too. The ghost had about as much personality as his teaching skills implied, but Harry was determined to do something about History of Magic at Hogwarts. After all, perhaps if they focussed on the
“Harry?” Suddenly his vision was filled with Andromeda. The lights around him dimmed, too, until he could open his eyes comfortably – although his vision was still blurry. As if sensing his thoughts, Andromeda handed him his glasses.
It was late, definitely later than usual, when Harry was woken to Pansy’s voice, shrill with anxiety beside him.
“With all due respect,” she said, sounding as if she held not an ounce of respect for the man. It made Harry grin in spite of himself. “His magical core is dangerously depleted. It seems even using magic may be a danger to him. Surely you realized this.”
“It’s not dark,” Draco added. “The lake makes it seem sort of green. Sometimes you can see the Giant Squid through the windows. There’s always lots of fish that you can see, and your dorms have enchanted windows so it looks like you’re looking outside.”
Andromeda hadn’t come through with them, of course, but he was sorely missing her presence. Saying goodbye to Teddy, too, had made him feel as though he was ripping his heart into tiny little pieces.
“What do you want, then?” Pansy asked, no longer hiding her curiosity. They had reached the kitchens, and he paused to tickle the pear on the portrait before responding.
The next thing Harry knew, sun was shining through the false window in his dormitory. He woke slowly, conscious of the voices flowing around him, but too groggy to make them out. His bed dipped, and someone placed his glasses in his hands.
He looked as he always did these days, slight and tired. His eyes had their now characterstic bags, his hair was long – nearing his shoulders, and mussed. He was wearing muggle clothes, jeans and a sweater. Harry thought it was frightfully attractive, though he’d never say it.
Harry didn’t bother to comment. It wasn’t as if he had never been an exception to the norm before. And it wasn’t as though he had never escaped certain injury – or even certain death – before.
Later that evening, Harry found himself curled up in Draco’s bed, relating the conversation to him. When Pansy had calmed down, they had gone to the Great Hall for dinner. She had refused to tell the other two what happened – hadn’t wated to talk about it. Draco was clearly upset by this, so after dinner Blaise had waved him away with Draco, said he’d stay the night with Pansy and Harry should stay with Draco, if only to calm everyone’s nerves before the school was filled the next day.
“Is there a problem, here?” Harry looked up to see McGonagall standing over them. Draco removed his knee from Harry’s leg, and he felt the absence like a slap to the face.
“We thought you might like to find…Weasley and Granger this morning,” Draco said. Harry could tell it took him effort to keep his tone level.
“Not over the summer,” Harry said with a sigh. He tried not to let his mind wander back to the summer, it would do no good for anybody.
“When we talk about the most recent war, we’re not going to use titles like He-Who-Shall-Not-Be-Named or Lord Voldemort, either.” You could tell the muggleborns, he thought, because they were the ones that didn’t flinch when he said the name Voldemort. “His name was Tom Riddle, so we can either call him Tom Riddle or Riddle. None of this fancy name business.
Harry let his hands move, skimming Draco’s calves, his thighs, dancing along the skin above the waistline of his pants. “I feel like,” Harry began. He stopped, gathered his thoughts, leaned into Draco’s touch on his chest. “Death follows me,” he said, almost sighed. “I dreamed that I went through the veil. You were there, you all were; you needed my help and I left. I just left.”
He drew four columns on the board and turned back to the class. “I think we all know at least one evil wizard that we’ll be talking about today,” he said. There were some whispers, but no one said anything out loud, so he continued on. Turning back to the chalkboard he wrote
Pansy scoffed at him. “The Parkinson’s aren’t even Sacred Twenty-Eight anymore, though my parents and grandparents tried to pretend like we were. But no, and it wasn’t a noble decision, either. ‘Neutrality never loses’ is practically the Parkinson motto. Neither was Blaise’s mum, though she was a pureblood. Too busy marrying rich men and then killing them; doesn’t care wether they’re wizarding or muggle or anything so long as they’re rich. Actually,” she leaned in conspiratorily towards him, “I’m fairly sure Blaise’s dad, whoever he was, was muggle, from the way he talks about him. I’ve never asked, though. Blaise was a right ass when we were younger, anyways.”
“It’s the Welcome Feast tonight,” Draco continued as Harry sat up. “Andromeda and Teddy will be here.”
“When will they realize, though?” Harry asked. “Anyone dangerous is in Azkaban. The rest are serving house arrest sentences, like Draco and his mum. These laws won’t do anything but control family and friends of Death Eaters that had nothing to do with the war.”
“I’ll be teaching you this year, but you don’t need to call me Professor or anything because I’m still a student, just like you. You can just call me Harry.”
“Can you disillusion yourself?” Blaise asked suddenly. “If you walk sort of – in-between us, I don’t think anyone will notice if you’re a bit fuzzy at the edges.”
That’s why he smoked, he reflected, taking a long drag of the cigarette. Smoking receded the shadows. It calmed his breathing when everything was too much.
“Had to go and upset her, didn’t you, Weasley?” Blaise drawled, breaking the silence of the moment. “Is it all Gryffindors that are so tactless, or are Weasley’s especially bad at it?”
“Stop,” he heard Draco gasp through his haze, and he paused to look up. Draco’s gaze on him was heated, Harry felt himself blush.
“The Death Eater legislation the Wizengamot is pushing through,” he began. “Do you think I’d be able to speak against it at the vote?”
“As far as I know, just Pansy Parkinson, Blaise Zabini, Theo Nott, and Goyle. I think Millicent is going to Durmstrang with Daphne Greengrass. The rest have chosen not to, or…” he trailed off, but the words remained unspoken.
“I don’t sound like that,” Harry said, weakly. Hermione glared at him, but she had stopped crying through her angry tirade. “Does it help if I say sorry?” He asked meekly.
Draco launched into an explanation about the work he was doing with the restoration, under the watchful eye of Professor – or rather, Headmisstress McGonagall. Harry only half listened.
The first day of term was tomorrow. Ron and Hermione would be arriving in the morning, which Harry was uncharactersitically nervous about, given the dynamic between the eighth years right now. The rest of the school would be arriving in the evening for the Welcome Feast and Sorting, and Andromeda would be visiting with Teddy as well. They had visted already this week – Teddy had already stolen Pansy’s heart.
Draco let out a low whistle when Pansy and Harry passed over their timetables for him to look at. “None of you will have any free time, will you?” He smiled a little at Harry, but it didn’t reach his eyes.
“They’re always vague like this, here,” she said to him as gently as he’d ever heard her speak. “I don’t find it good practice to beat around the bushes with my students.”
. Perhaps, he thought, the most terrifying part of his nightmare had been how willingly he had crossed the veil. He hadn’t tried, hadn’t lifted a finger, really, to help his friends. Even if it was just a dream – it made him feel like he was capable of just…not caring. And there was guilt, too. His nightmare had reflected so clearly his deepest wish in the Days After, the wish that he had just stayed dead. That he had gone on. That for once, he had done something selfish for himself. Instead of facing a hostile castle, angry friends, he could be with his dad, Sirius, Remus…
The other two laughed. In what seemed like unspoken agreement, they all pushed their chairs back. It would be breakfast time soon in the Great Hall and they had to make an appearance – to collect their official professor assignments and meeting times, at any rate.
His hair seemed ragged, sticking up in ways Harry knew a young Draco Malfoy never would have let it. There were dark circles under his eyes – the kinds Harry had from nighttime wanderings and shrieking nightmares. He wore lazily unbuttoned black robes. His skin and hair were stark against the night, not like Harry who blended into the dark except for the whites of his eyes.
“Ew,” she said, making a face. “But Mary didn’t say anything mean. She just said she could cut my hair.”
Harry barely had time to slide his hands in Draco’s hair before he pulled away, breathing hard. Harry tried to follow, searching Draco’s lips out with his own, but Draco stepped back.
Harry dropped back on his pillows. Sunday evening. He had missed so much – his meetings with Binns and McGonagall, cutting Mar’s hair, lesson plans – everything. “When can I leave?” he asked sullenly.
“I’ll take that as a compliment,” Blaise responded theatrically. “Don’t worry, Weasley was shafted with Smith. I’m sure you’ll hear so many stories it’ll be like you lived with him anyway.”
“Well, how would you put it?” Ginny asked after a moments silence. Seeing he wasn’t going to get out of it, Harry relayed to her the events of the first week – everything from the first day in the eighth year common room to smuggling Draco out that morning.
“Idiot,” Harry responded as he wrapped his fingers through Draco’s hair, pulling the other man’s head back and tasting the salty sweet of his skin. He unwrapped his hands, pressing his hips against Draco’s, relishing in the sweet pressure, before pulling back. Draco was watching him, and he watched right back, unabashedly taking in Draco’s flushed lips, the bruises forming on his neck.
Perhaps we still have much to discuss before we could ever truly be friends. This I understand, and I hope you will too. Of course, you have no reason to speak to me as a friend and I will not be upset should you even go as far to discard this letter without reading it.
“I know.” He sighed, trying to let some of the tension out of him. It didn’t work. “I’m going to find McGonagall, see if I can floo Andy to see if she’ll come through today. Want to come with me?”
“I heard it’s under the lake, and it’s always dark,” said another girl nearer to the front of the group.
Draco snorted inelegantly. “No one can ever get any work done when Pansy Parkinson is around.” But he stood up from the chair and jumped onto the bed, straddling Harry at his hips. “Is this what you want?” he leaned forward, his breath in Harry’s ear, nose brushing his cheek.
“Easier to think, actually,” Harry added. He pretended to ignore Hermione rolling her eyes. “I don’t have as many reasons to be angry anymore.”
“We were wondering if we could talk,” Hermione said carefully. She was glancing past him, into their room, and Harry could feel the cold stares his friends aimed at her, even if he couldn’t see them.
yet, all the eighth years who were able were arriving the week before to help finalize castle preparation and restoration for the following year.
“Don’t make me regret this,” she mumbled to him as they sat down at a table directly beside Draco and Luna. Draco shot him a concerned look as well, which he ignored, choosing instead to raise his eyebrows in Luna’s direction. Draco merely shrugged in response, but Harry could see him fiddling with his shirt on his left forearm again.
“What look?” Harry asked, bemused. He let his hands trace the scars on Draco’s abdomen, twine through his hair, tug on it gently.
about fish, but Mar was looking at him so expectantly that he felt like he needed to say something. It was the right decision – as soon as he said it, her whole face lit up with excitement.
“Let me disillusion you,” Draco whispered into his ear. He had clearly followed Harry up and was now pressed behind him, bare chest to bare back. Harry shuddered and nodded.
Draco nodded and Andromeda turned her fierce look on Harry. “You as well. You’ll be alright, both of you. Now, who else is coming back?”
She cast him a disparaging look. “Yes,” she said. Then, after a moment’s pause – “No.” Then “Yes,” again. She sighed. He took a moment to look at her – properly. She had cut her hair short over the summer – shorter than it had ever been. It now reached just to the bottom of her ears. She looked tired, the bags under her eyes more pronounced than he had ever seen them. But then again, wasn’t that true for them all?
“Very Slytherin of you, Potter,” she said, coming back around to sit on the bed again. “Very sneaky.”
He was going to say something cheeky about being the Chosen One or maybe about how Draco was really the one with the big head, or something embarrassing, like
“Can we stop talking about it and go see it already?” Mar asked abruptly. Her fingers were tapping again, Harry noticed. He should ask McGonagall about that – it seemed a little bit strange.
Draco was flushed bright red, and Harry guessed it was more from the question he had asked than their previous activities. Suddenly, something clicked and he couldn’t help but grin at Draco.
“Okay,” Harry responded. He felt like he was missing something – they were always up early to eat by themselves in the kitchens, but surely waking a little bit late wasn’t the end of the world. Especially now that the castle was full of students, not just eighth years.
“I sleep better with the baby around,” Harry responded without really thinking. He was still trying to make sense of what was going on. He had become an early riser in the Days After, mostly thanks to Teddy’s sleep schedule and Andromeda’s insistence to be up at the crack of dawn with the kettle boiling, but this seemed excessive.
“The rest of them don’t have an excuse,” said Ginny, with what Harry could only describe as a sarcastic laugh. “They’re just pricks.” She had raised her voice at the end of what she was saying as Seamus walked past them. He shot a nasty look in her direction, but didn’t comment further – probably because Professor Stone had just walked by to collect their sample.
The fist in his chest, the spinning, the crushing, was receding, now. He felt as though he could breathe, but
Harry smiled at her and she smiled tentatively back. “How about this,” he said. “Tonight I can come by the common room with Pansy and she can cut your hair. How does that sound?”
yet, all the eighth years who were able were arriving the week before to help finalize castle preparation and restoration for the following year.
Harry rolled his eyes, his hand bumping Draco’s as he passed him the cigarette. “I could visit,” he said quietly. When Draco raised his eyebrows, Harry repeated himself.
“I’ll write a list of topics,” he said finally. “Everyone can pick one. But I’m not giving you answers or helping you do the research.”
Blaise mock shuddered. “The arithmancy OWL of the Boy Who Lived resting on my shoulders? That’s too much responsibility.”
“No arguments,” said the Headmistress firmly. “You are here at my request, and if necessary I will see you leave at my request, too.”
There was a crowd already at the door to the potions classroom when they arrived. Professor Stone, the new professor, was standing next to the door that was closed behind her. Harry and Draco followed Pansy and Blaise to the edge of the group. Ron and Hermione weren’t far in front of them, but they were standing with Neville, Dean, and Seamus, so Harry didn’t bother to even think about approaching.
He had fought with Ron and Hermione of course, many times, but it was never quite like this. It never felt like it was something that might never be repaired. Never felt quite like the end of the world – a signal, if anything, that the Days Before were really behind him. Perhaps in the Days After he wasn’t friends with Ron and Hermione – perhaps it was marked by death. His own, his friendships, his old life.
Hermione huffed out a breath and pushed her hair out of her face. “I didn’t want you to worry,” she said, finally, looking at him out of the side of her eye. “If it helps, Ron wanted me to be honest.”
“I should have told you,” he said, finally, from the start. “It was just…he was feeling everything I felt, you know. We were sad and afraid in the same way. And-” he broke off with a sigh, looking away from Hermione. “It’s Draco Malfoy. He’s always been..there.”
They walked in silence. Harry felt tense, could feel the energy crackling between them. It was almost amusing, he thought. In the Days Before he was so oblivious, he never would have noticed. But in the Days After, every feeling, every sense, every thought he had ever had was amplified.
“I have my own,” said Draco with a shrug. Harry could see the lines of tension in his body, though, and clearly Pansy could, too. She put a calming hand on his arm. Harry tried to ignore the flare of jealousy in his stomach as Draco leaned into her touch.
“No,” Draco responded, sitting up slightly. “You would have been happy, I hope.” Draco’s hands trailed down, found the hem of Harry’s shirt, lifted it slowly, Harry’s sighs turning to gasps as Draco kissed his way up his chest.
She stepped down from the podium as the bustle of hundreds of moving students filled the Hall. Harry sat up slowly, cradling Teddy to his chest. The boy had begun to stir and whimper quietly.
Hermione rolled her eyes, although it looked half-hearted. “Your consequences were winning a war. His were hurting people and probation.”
“Of course not,” she said, finally. “I saw it through the window. Also three lampreys, two trouts, and I think a Salmon, but that doesn’t really make sense because they’re supposed to live in rivers.” She was looking at him expectantly and didn’t seem to notice Blaise, who was trying to hide a laugh with a cough and Draco, smiling beside him. Harry elbowed Blaise in the ribs.
Blaise mock shudered. “The arithmancy OWL of the Boy Who Lived resting on my shoulders? That’s too much responsibility.”
Her smile was gentle, but Harry still frowned at her words. For the past three months they had shared house duties and Teddy duties. It had kept Harry from sinking into despair, even through the sleepless nights where the boy cried and cried, missing the mum and dad he had never known.
“Ms Parkinson,” McGonagall said with a sigh, “I promise you, this has been taken into account by all the professors and we have come to what we believe is a suitable arrangement.”
“Breathe,” Draco said in his ear as they sat down at the table. Harry did his best to give Draco a smile, but was sure it came out looking wobbly. As usual, though, they were the only ones at their end of the eighth year table. Ron, Hermione, and Neville weren’t there yet, either, which helped calm his panic some.
Harry was uncomfortable thinking about how Ron and Hermione would fit into this dynamic when they returned. Would they join him, Pansy, Blaise, and Draco for their walks around the castle? Shuffle themsevles into their group to make sure no one went anywhere alone? He hadn’t told them anything about Draco, had been scared to. Would they fall in, instead, with Zacharias Smith? No, definitely not that, but perhaps with Dean, Seamus, Neville, and Nott. In the Days Before, he would have been sure of where they stood. In the Days After, he wasn’t quite sure about very many things anymore.
He leaned out over the edge of the Astronomy Tower, cigarette resting between his lips, and gazed out at the shadowy outline of the Hogwarts grounds. They were all here, of course, to celebrate and to mourn. Everyone had been offered a bed to stay in for the night. Naturally, most Gryffindors Harry’s age were currently seated in the Common Room, getting pissed on Ogden’s firewhisky and cheap muggle rum.
“Alright?” Draco came into the room and sat delicately beside him on the couch. Andromeda followed behind him and deposited herself into the armchair by the fire, which she lit with a lazy wave of her wand.
“You put him there,” Ron said finally. “He would never be working on that if it hadn’t been for you.”
“I probably should,” Harry sighed in agreement. He hadn’t spoken to them since the previous day’s catastrophe.
!” Draco sat up suddenly, blocking Harry’s view of the door. But of course, he didn’t need to see who it was to know.
“Friendly seeming fellow,” Harry commented wryly as Draco fell in step beside him and they passed back through the wards together.
“My punishment, if you could call it that,” he said. They sank down against the wall in unison, sitting next to each other on the stone under the stars. “I’m here until the end of eighth year. Can’t leave school grounds, can’t use magic outside of classes, can’t drink, can’t share rooms with other students. You get the idea, I’m sure.” He cast Harry a peircing gaze. “Why aren’t you back inside with all the others?”
They were breathing hard, but Draco had hardly paused to recover before Harry felt a mouth on him, licking his cock slowly, tantalizingly. He wrapped his hands in Draco’s hair, knew he was being loud but was hardly sure what noises he was making. There was pressure building in him as Draco began to move faster, licking and sucking and grazing him with teeth that made him squirm. Before he could form a coherent thought, his vision exploded with stars, and his heart with tenderness.
Thanks to Draco’s insistence that they begin eating in the kitchens again, at least until Harry was feeling better, Harry was able to avoid any questioning by other students until Monday evening. He, Draco, Pansy, and Blaise had made their way to the Slytherin common room after dinner intent on getting some work done without being distracted by the rowdy eighth years. Professor McGonagall had announced that the sixth through eighth years were to meet in the Great Hall at eight o’clock that night. Harry and Draco knew why, but no one else did – not even Blaise and Pansy.
Harry did his best to give her a smile as he pulled out his potions book. He glanced back at Luna and Draco again. The two were deep in conversation, now, but Draco was still scratching at his arm.
Finally, she spoke again. “In an effort to have everyone graduate within the usual seven years, classes will run on an accelerated basis to cover the work that was missed last year and the work that is required for the current year. For those in fifth and seventh years, your heads of house will be speaking to you about the option of a slower rate of study that would have you stay at Hogwarts over the summer and take your OWLs or NEWTs in the fall instead of at the end of this academic year. You are welcome to take the longer courses or the accelerated option, we will make any accommodations necessary. As well, the eighth years will be available as tutors to students who should need it. Your professors will speak to you more about this in your classes.
And Draco Malfoy, that night on the Astronomy Tower. Things could never go back to how they were, and somehow, despite everything, Harry was infinitely grateful.
Harry slapped himself mentally for not realizing sooner – for not realizing last night, even. Draco was expressly forbidden from sharing sleeping quarters with other students; and while there was probably nothing technically wrong with him staying the night in Blaise and Harry’s room, there were also too many people itching to see him expelled.
Neville sighed. “Look, I just wanted to say that I’ll do my best to keep Smith off you in the common room, but I can’t promise anything. He’s angry.”
“So did Draco,” Harry sighed. “And I’d say Draco probably has a lot less to apologize for than Dumbledore ever did.”
Harry found it within him to give the other boy an amused smile. “I feel like I have to disagree with that on principle,” he said, “but you probably aren’t incorrect.”
“Stalin,” she said confidently. Harry couldn’t help but shake his head in amusement. Of course if anyone had an answer it would be Mar. He wrote down the last name and then picked up a stack of parchments from his desk, handing them out manually to each student since he couldn’t use his wand.
By the time Professor Stone had finished speaking and Harry had gathered the ingredients, and Ginny had divvied up the steps to the potion, he had hoped she would have forgotten her question. One pointed look from her after a moment of silence, though, told him she hadn’t at all. He felt panic gripping the edges of his mind, tried to push it away.
Pansy snorted from the other side of the room. “So you just stared at it for an hour?” she asked in amusement. Harry just made a face at her – mostly because she wasn’t wrong.
I learned plenty during the two months (and the rest of the summer) other than chemistry, of course. I have read – so much, more than I ever thought I would – muggle literature until it felt like my eyes would bleed. Everything Minerva could get for me. And we spoke for hours, some days – about how I was raised, how I was horrid, how I cannot change that but perhaps I can change my future. Muggles start wars over race, religion, any number of idiotic things just as wizards do. And it turns these small differences in people into life-or-death variances. I understand this now. I understand that I contributed to this culture of oppression and violence and I will not participate anymore.
Maybe some wizards are simply fearful of muggles. After all, we still spend much time dedicated to learning about witch burnings – as if they were even a cause for fear. Did you know most killed “witches” were actually muggles? Their fear of us caused them to attack their own, which perhaps caused us to fear them.
“You’ve changed,” she said, finally. He hummed, not sure what to say to that. “You’re so much calmer. And thoughtful.”
“What’s going on?” he asked, once he felt more oriented. Pansy was sitting up on his left, glaring at Blaise, who was standing over her. Draco was still curled up beside Harry, their legs tangled underneath the bedsheets. Ahh DS Ah FHalf of him wanted to stay like this all day.
“I believe Mr Potter would like to be included in any discussion,” Madame Pomfrey said to the Healer, lazily waving her wand in an arc to douse the flame as if it were an everyday occurrence. Then again, maybe it was for her. Harry was quite sure he didn’t know the half of what went on in the Hospital Wing.
“Honestly, Potter, it’s like you end up in a different world,” she said. He shrugged, but could feel Draco snickering against his back. Perhaps in the Days After he was a little bit…fuzzy – but it wasn’t him, really, it was the world. The world was fuzzy; too fast and too slow and too hard and too soft and hurt too much and didn’t feel like anything at all and Harry didn’t know what to do with it. He had the strong urge to look up, towards Ron and Hermione, but forced it down. Now was not the time.
The four ostensibly avoided the eighth year common room, choosing to spend most of their time instead in Draco’s rooms, abandoned classrooms, or on the grounds instead. They never went anywhere alone, either. Smith had quieted down, but they often found people lurking around the common room and various corridors at all hours of the day and night. Harry was also quite sure they had people tailing Draco and Pansy, at least, but the others had told him he was being paranoid when he brought it up.
“I don’t know,” he said. He paused to watch her as she poured some of their potion into a vial to submit to Professor Stone. It was supposed to be dark purple upon completion; theirs was a little bit too light, he thought, but not horrid. “Some things are just…broken.”
“Worried they’ll hate us?” he couldn’t see Draco’s expression in the dark, but could imagine the quirked, slightly unsure smile.
“It seems as though you had an argument with Mr Weasley and Ms Granger, correct?” she continued. Harry nodded affirmatively, hoping she wouldn’t ask what it was about.
“Everyone is fine,” McGonagall said gently. “It was an…internal reaction, so to speak. You were the only person harmed.”
“He was never in my head,” Blaise said, “so I know it’s not the same. But sometimes, it helps me to focus on things I know are true.” He looked up at Harry in the darkness, the whites of his eyes shining. Were they just bright, or were those tears? There were tears in his own eyes, Harry realized – he hadn’t noticed until now.
“And on that note,” McGonagall said, smiling warmly down at all the students. Harry felt almost eleven years old again. “Please make your way to your common rooms. First years, your House Guardians will meet you at your table and guide you to your Common Room.”
Harry gave him a hard look, not entirely convinced but unsure how to argue – unsure if Draco would be upset if he pushed more.
“You would be a sane person, Mr Potter,” McGonagall said, exactly as if he were a misbehaving teenager again. But she looked proud, which was something.
“We’ll know soon enough,” Pansy responded. “We have her first…with the seventh year Gryffindors and Ravenclaws.”
They entered the cottage one after the other to the sound of Teddy’s giggles. Harry smiled to himself – this, in the Days After, was the sound of family.
“Oi!” he called as he approached the first years. Mar stopped short when he called out, prompting another first year, Jason, to bump into her. “Don’t you have work to be doing?” he asked, in his best stern professor voice.
“Not completely,” she said. “But I will let Minerva know what we discussed and see if she has anything to say to it. Don’t try anything until she approves, alright?”
“I am teaching it,” he said finally. “But try not to tell anyone, okay? It’s just after once, so you won’t have to keep it secret for long.”
“Malfoy?” Harry croaked, almost incredulously. As the name passed his lips, the blonde man materialized in front of him.
Harry couldn’t help but make a face at that. “Is it so wrong to just want a quiet life?” he asked with a sigh. Realistically, he was only kind of joking. Sort of.
Pansy was pacing. Harry thought she looked shocked from her own outburst, was sure she had planned to say something more eloquently. But she looked the Headmistress in the eyes and didn’t back down.
cried leaving in a flood of tears had done more to shake his confidence than anything had since the war itself. He sat down heavily on Harry’s bed, and it seemed to shake everyone out of their surprised stupor.
He felt the ripple of the wards as he stepped outside of them, saw the world shimmer slightly and reform. Draco appeared with a pop almost at the same moment, holding the arm of an Auror, who must have side-along apparated him here. The Auror nodded once at Harry, then spun on his heel and vanished with another pop.
Harry felt his skin prickle - anger, again. Frustration, maybe? Not emotions he felt often enough anymore. “Well clearly it meant something, Hermione,” he said, finally, “or you wouldn’t have said it.”
He checked Draco’s room first, but none of his friends were there. They were unlikely anywhere in the eighth year dorms, but perhaps the Slytherin common room. Or…he checked his watch. The kitchens for a late lunch.
“Thank you,” said McGonagall, startling him out of his reverie. He had forgotten, for a moment, that it was supposed to be a moment of silence. Had assumed the world had dampened in his mind, as it often did. She said something else that he didn’t catch, but the hall began bustling again as the first years were led in by Professor Vector.
Harry sat up, felt his eyebrows furrow. “Come on,” he said finally, standing up and grabbing both their shirts off the floor. He headed down the hall towards his room, pausing to place the monitoring spell on Teddy’s room along the way. He didn’t wait to see if Draco would follow – knew he would. In the Days Before, Harry never would have been so bold.
“I cannot meet my aunt for the first time looking as if you just ravished me in her garden,” Draco said with a sigh, drawing his hands away from Harry’s waist.
this chapter contains a TRIGGER WARNING for brief, undetailed mentions of torture. if anyone needs me to mark it off in the text in some way so they feel safe reading please let me know and i'll see what i can do to mark it off.
“Now, have I assumed correctly that you are here to speak with me and not taking a casual stroll around the castle? If I’m wrong, by all means,” she gestured to the corridor behind her. Harry had to stifle his laugh at Pansy’s confused look.
“It’s about how it’s framed, I think,” Harry said. “Not pro-Death Eater, but anti-government control over civilians. Somehow we have to make people see that this is an overstep – that it’s wrong.”
“No,” Draco said simply. He sighed again at Harry’s expectant look. “No, I don’t want to be tracked. But it’s not as though I’m doing anything illegal, there’s nothing they’ll find. And honestly, most of those bastards deserve to be tracked anyway.”
“We haven’t been anywhere without Pansy or Blaise all week,” Harry said, watching Draco intently. “I’m just saying, we can work on assignments when we’re with them.”
“Harry?” Suddenly his vision was filled with Andromeda. The lights around him dimmed, too, until he could open his eyes comfortably – although his vision was still blurry. As if sensing his thoughts, Andromeda handed him his glasses.
“For Merlin’s sake,” groused Draco. Harry watched with satisfaction as he threw down his quill and spun in his chair. Draco’s face was flushed, and his eyes dark, but not, Harry noted, with anger. With something else.
Harry looked down at his timetable as she walked away. It was, quite frankly, the most packed timetable he had ever seen. He glanced over at Draco’s – it was emptier. He had some time slots free. Pansy’s seemed more similar to Harry’s, packed full from breakfast to dinner, and sometimes after, too.
“Finally, Mr Filch has asked me to remind you that the Forbidden Forest is strictly off limits, and that all students should review the list of banned items posted in his office.”
Dozens of hands were raised – all except for a couple of kids who were muggleborn and really, really didn’t do any extra reading. “Randy,” Harry said, pointing to a Hufflepuff boy at the back with his hand halfway up in the air.
“How about this,” he began. “There’s no one in the Great Hall right now and there won’t be until dinner. Why don’t you take the second years with you? I’ll write you a note that gives you permission.”
“I’ve been known to have them,” Draco drawled. If Harry’s eyes were open, he would have rolled them, but he was already drifting off into sleep.
“Sorry,” Blaise said offhandedly, noting perhaps the tension on his friends faces, “but it’s true. They hurt people. Really hurt people.”
“Part of what we’re going to do in this class is make sure that your reading and writing abilities are good enough to help you keep up in your other classes. And if they’re not, we’ll figure out how to fix it. Today, to see where we’re all at, I’d like you all to write me six inches on what piece of history you’d like to learn about most this year. It can be something I already mentioned, or something I didn’t, and it can be magical history or muggle history.”
“The rest of them don’t have an excuse,” said Ginny, with what Harry could only describe as a sarcastic laugh. “They’re just pricks.” She had raised her voice at the end of what she was saying as Seamus walked past them. He shot a nasty look in her direction, but didn’t comment further – probably because Professor Stone had just walked by to collect their sample.
Food had appeared on their plates as the sorting finished. Harry picked at it, more focussed on Teddy than anything. He let the conversation of the Slytehrins ebb around him, content to just sit and not think for a moment.
“What do you want, then?” Pansy asked, no longer hiding her curiosity. They had reached the kitchens, and he paused to tickle the pear on the portrait before responding.
“I’ll go with him,” Draco said, almost too quickly. “None of us should be going anywhere alone,” he added.
“You are so goddamn beautiful, Draco Malfoy,” he whispered in the other boy’s ears. He felt the moment Draco’s breath stopped, the moment he started breathing again. Then he saw stars as Draco shifted his hips against Harry’s.
“Can I see him now?” Harry asked, sitting up straighter. “I’m feeling fine. How long have I been here, anyway?”
“It’s about how it’s framed, I think,” Harry said. “Not pro-Death Eater, but anti-government control over civilians. Somehow we have to make people see that this is an overstep – that it’s wrong.”
“Nothing,” Harry said emphatically. Maybe too emphatically – the small girl startled. “There’s nothing wrong with anyone liking girls or anyone liking boys.”
“Drink this,” said another voice somewhere past the foot of his bed. Madame Pomfrey bustled into view, potion vial in hand.
Draco couldn’t help it – he felt himself blush furiously. Normally, he didn’t mind Harry kissing him or taking his hand no matter who they were in front of. He welcomed the touch, especially in these days after the war – but also as he always had when Blaise put an arm around his shoulders or Pansy played with his hair. It was different, right now, though, with both Granger and Weasley now staring daggers through him.
He was shaken out of his spiralling thought process by McGonagall stepping up to the podium. Teddy had fallen asleep in his arms at some point during dinner and Harry bundled him close, reluctant to acknowledge that he’d have to let the boy go soon. Perhaps tomorrow he could speak to the Headmistress about spending some weekends at home with Teddy. Draco seemed to realize his distress, or maybe it was just good timing – he shifted on the bench so that Harry was leaning against his chest, rather than his side. Harry let himself relax into Draco as McGonagall began speaking.
She gave him a levelled look. “That would be a highly unpopular stance, Harry,” she said. “Sometimes it’s best to let these things run their course. The public will realize it’s a bad idea, over time.”
He waited a moment as the class reached into their bags to pull out the requested materials, and stayed quiet until they were all settled and focused again on  him. “For the second half of the class today,” he continued, “I think we can play some games that will help us all get to know each other. But for the first half of the class I have a writing exercise for you all.” There was a collective groan from the class that he couldn’t help but laugh at.
He not-so-surrpetitiously rolled up his sleeves, showing his faded Mark. “I’m okay with – learning to be okay with that as a part of me. So hate me, I don’t care, Weasley. But Pansy is ten times the person either of you will ever be. Don’t touch her, don’t even fucking look at her or I swear to Merlin I will
Perhaps we still have much to discuss before we could ever truly be friends. This I understand, and I hope you will too. Of course, you have no reason to speak to me as a friend and I will not be upset should you even go as far to discard this letter without reading it.
There was a crowd already at the door to the potions classroom when they arrived. Professor Stone, the new professor, was standing next to the door that was closed behind her. Harry and Draco followed Pansy and Blaise to the edge of the group. Ron and Hermione weren’t far in front of them, but they were standing with Neville, Dean, and Seamus, so Harry didn’t bother to even think about approaching.
“Harry!” It was Mar, of course, entirely unable to understand the tension of the situation she was approaching, as usual. “Guess what?”
Pansy, Harry, and Draco had been in the Slytherin common room far too late into the night. They had spoken, separately, to each dorm about the upcoming year – had worked on getting to know each and every student (although this was mostly Harry; Pansy and Draco were familiar with the majority of the students in their former house). The younger students had reacted with awe and wonder at the seventh years. Many clung to Pansy, wanting to tell her about their summer or receive comfort about being back at the castle. The older students, meanwhile, were mostly angry and sullen at Harry and Draco’s presence, refusing to speak to anyone other than Pansy. It had been…exhausting.
“Okay, Mar,” Harry said. He gave her his best interpretation of a friendly smile. The whole group of children looked less scared now, more eager to be here, as if her words and confidence had broken whatever emotions were keeping them scared or subdued.
Minerva says the best way to spit in the face of the Dark Lord is to oppose his ideals – not just on the surface, per formatively, but wholeheartedly. She is right. At my trial I did not necessarily believe that muggles were as good as wizards, I did not believe they were worth as much or as important or worthy of life in the same way.
She took a deep breath, leaned against him carefully. He put an arm around her, equally as carefully. It wasn’t that he was touch-averse, necessarily, but Ron and Hermione had never needed so much affection from him. He found it strange.
that floated around the hall, especially as they passed the Gryffindor table. When they reached the eighth years’ table, Pansy’s face had softened. She and Blaise had left two seats open between them. Harry slid in beside Pansy while Draco sat on his other side, beside Blaise, who engaged him in conversation almost immediately.
There was the combination of grumbles and explanations of glee around the table, which made Harry snort. Slytherins were a testy bunch, honestly.
“That’s why your school is such a good idea, Potter,” said Pansy, scrunching her face as if the compliment hurt her to hand out. “It provides an option for families that wouldn’t normally have one.”
“You could knock,” Draco groused. He turned his body back towards Harry, bent low and nuzzled his cheek once before rolling off him. Harry, in turn, sat up quickly in surprise.
She stopped and watched them expectantly – it took the group a moment to realize that she was dismissing them to choose their partners. Harry looked at Draco, feeling panicky all at once. He wasn’t okay with this – hadn’t expected it, couldn’t deal with changes from his expectations or routines right now. His breath was coming shakily and he flinched when Pansy reached toward him. The world was darkening, the only steady presence was Draco’s hand in his.
“So are you,” Harry responded, looking at her out of the corner of his eye. In the Days Before, he would never have imagined this conversation would ever happen. But right now, if he were being honest with himself, he felt closer to Pansy than he did Ron and Hermione. “Are you okay?”
“I’m sorry,” he said, shifting in his seat. He could tell she wasn’t upset or disappointed, not exactly, but he hated that she worried over him.
They actually made it to lunch without being accosted by a single Slytherin first year. The first years had spent most of the previous day shadowing them, and even Pansy had noted that it felt strange that morning when not a single one approached.
“No,” she laughed. “It’s just-” She paused for a moment, looked him up and down, setting Harry’s nerves on edge. “You didn’t
Draco let out a low whistle when Pansy and Harry passed over their timetables for him to look at. “None of you will have any free time, will you?” He smiled a little at Harry, but it didn’t reach his eyes.
“It’s not a hard assignment,” Draco said, giving Blaise a look as he packed up his stuff. He paused to read from the piece of parchment in front of him. “
Harry thougth for a moment. He had kept in touch with precious few people after the war, preferring to let the world go on its way without him. “Ron and Hermione, of course,” he said. “Most of the rest of us. Neville, Dean, Seamus. Lavender won’t be back, nor the Patils. I supposed Hermione will be the only Gryffindor girl. Hannah Abbot will be back in Hufflepuff, and I heard Ernie and Justin will be back. Ravenclaw will have Michael Corner, I’m sure.” Draco made a nosie of discontent, which made Harry grin.
And then he was pulling away from her, dodging a slap that was aimed at his shoulder and laughing like he hadn’t laughed in ages.
“It was worse,” Harry managed to say, before abruptly being sick all over the floor. Zabini vanished the mess easily, and dried Harry of the water he had poured on him with an extra flourish of his wand. He moved to sit down beside Harry on his bed.
“I daresay that woman needs a break,” said Minerva. Harry nodded his agreement as he took a sip of tea. British habits may die hard, but sometimes he really, really wished Minerva was a coffee drinker.
“Knock on your solid stone door? Or is it better to slap your dog portrait until he barks?” Pansy snapped, but she still came around and sat on the foot of the bed. Blaise deposited himself on Draco’s chair.
“It’s the Welcome Feast tonight,” Draco continued as Harry sat up. “Andromeda and Teddy will be here.”
Harry’s mind, unbidden, went back to their year on the run – to Ron running away. He came back then, though.
I’ve started this letter too many times and I have potions work to do, so I’m not going to start over anymore.
“It’s quite interesting, really,” she said to Madame Pomfrey, ignoring Harry almost entirely. “I will have to have the Healer come in and look for himself. I’ve never seen anything quite like this.”
They walked in silence. Harry felt tense, could feel the energy crackling between them. It was almost amusing, he thought. In the Days Before he was so oblivious, he never would have noticed. But in the Days After, every feeling, every sense, every thought he had ever had was amplified.
I believe the first thing I learned about was chemistry. I think she knew I would like it, given my affinity for potions. Did you know muggles can do with ordinary ingredients and no magic what we do with potions? She taught me about muggle universities after that, when I expressed interest. Did you know the ministry has a branch that prepares wizards for muggle universities from Hogwarts? I will never get to go that route, I know the ministry would not help me in that endeavour. But it is something I consider. Professor Strickland has been helpful.
What Harry wouldn’t have given, in that moment, for someone he loved to be here to make sense of this for him. Sirius, Lupin, even Andromeda.
“They made my life miserable,” she said. “Malfoy called me slurs, Pansy reminded me I was ugly every chance she got.” In a fluid motion, she pulled up her left sleeve, revealing the word that Bellatrix Lestrange had carved into her skin less than a year ago. Mudblood. “They hurt people. They killed innocent people. And then we come back from Australia and you’re friends with them? No warning? No hi, Hermione, how was your traumatic experience putting your parent’s memories back into their heads? Just ‘Hi, Hermione, come meet my new boyfriend, Draco bloody Malloy.’”
“Yes,” Harry said. Silence settled between them as Harry gathered his thoughts, trying to decide how to explain. “I suppose it’s just…even if it is in my head, that doesn’t mean it’s not real,” he said finally. “And-” he paused, not sure he wanted to voice the next part, even to Andromeda.
Before Andy could say anything else, McGonagall came bustling into Harry’s little area of the Hospital Wing, Madame Pomfrey in tow.
I quite enjoy this chapter for Harry although I realize there isn’t much Draco in it. But we’ll see him again next chapter<333
“Some of you might know about them already, you’re right,” he said with a nod, “but not all of you. You’re in a unique position Arwen, because you’ve been to non-magic school and now you’re at a magic school. But many people in your class haven’t had the chance to go to a school that isn’t magic, and even if they did you don’t always learn about the same things. And there are some people here, like you, who didn’t know they were magic until they turned eleven, but they haven’t been interested in spending their time reading up on people like Grindlewald.” He let a teasing note enter his voice, “Believe it or not, there are some things that are more pleasant to read about.”
Pansy had finally made the decision for them all, declaring they would walk Harry to the Great Hall so he could eat with his friends while they waited in the eighth year common room for the end of breakfast. And this was how he had ended up curled up on the sofa before the fire, feet in Blaise’s lap and head in Pansy’s, feeling as though he was going to be sick.
“She’s not going to keep that secret,” Blaise muttered to Harry. Harry found himself laughing, a rare occurrence.
The people who chose to do the hurting, Harry reflected, did not have sleepless nights. They were haunted, just as haunted as the rest of them. Perhaps in the Days Before, he wouldn’t have understood, would have thought himself better for the choices he made. Except that he hadn’t made choices, not really. People had made choices for him – Dumbledore, Voldemort, the prophecy.
I owe the both of you (and many others) more apologies than I could ever think I’d owe anyone. I will not be offended if you don’t read this letter, if you’d rather throw it away and continue hating me. But I hope you will give me a chance.
Harry woke in time to rush out for his pre-breakfast meeting with McGonagall, leaving Draco fast asleep behind him. He was starving, not to mention still groggy from the extra sleep and anxious about all the school work he had to complete. Perhaps he’d go for a quick run before breakfast, or a fly – but that seemed a waste of time when he could also just get some food from the kitchens and work on his charms essay or lesson plans instead.
Andromeda knew that. The second part, though, was more upsetting. After all, it wasn’t as though Andy had
Harry shook his head. Unsure if Draco could see it in the dark, he added, “No. It was unnecessary. It all was. You can’t survive a war, can’t watch people die and not be changed by it. The rest of it was…I don’t know, Draco. Beyond horrible.”
He waited until they were outside in the grounds to speak again. “It’s not – it won’t be taught the way Muggle Studies was before. It’s not just about things like electricity, not a way to make muggles look eccentric. It will have a large focus on muggle and magical history, taught in a way that emphasizes reading comprehension and writing skills, especially in first and second year. Then it will focus more on wizard-muggle relations and how to navigate the muggle world. Spending money, technology, using the post, the library, applying to muggle unis – the lot of it. There will be mandatory field trips and everything.”
His chest felt tight, and he almost wanted to cry, but couldn’t place the exact reason. Because Pansy was upset with him? That wasn’t it, not exactly. It was as though the sounds of the dining hall had amplified around him, too – and they were different, this year. The chatter was subdued, voices tinged with worry and fear. Harry felt it in the core of himself.
Pansy was not smug. She was, in fact, not at all impressed. Harry felt her eyes on him almost as soon as he and Draco stepped into the Great Hall. Draco must have felt it, too – or maybe it was the stares of all the students trickling in, because he dropped Harry’s hand almost immediately. When Harry cast a sharp look at him, he was staring straight ahead.
last night!” The voice came from behind him – loud enough to make him jump and spill coffee down the front of his robes. Blaise gave him an exasperated look from his other side and waved his wand, cleaning up the mess.
Harry paused, realizing he was definitely rambling. Ron was looking at him in a sort of bemused way, but Hermione seemed fascinated.
“That’ll be Teddy,” she said, releasing him with a look of fond exasperation. “Why don’t you go get him and I’ll make us some tea?”
And then he was pulling away from her, dodging a slap that was aimed at his shoulder and laughing like he hadn’t laughed in ages.
“I don’t know,” he said. He paused to watch her as she poured some of their potion into a vial to submit to Professor Stone. It was supposed to be dark purple upon completion; theirs was a little bit too light, he thought, but not horrid. “Some things are just…broken.”
Andromeda just shook her head, looking exasperated. “Start with that, then. Something simple that has fond memories. It may not go well at first, but you’ll be able to work on your control. And your trust.”
“Andromeda-” he began, intending to point out how Andromeda had successfully rescued herself, ended up on the right side, hadn’t hurt a single soul to do it.
Harry couldn’t help but make a face at that. “Is it so wrong to just want a quiet life?” he asked with a sigh. Realistically, he was only kind of joking. Sort of.
Madame Pomfrey clucked in distaste from somewhere behind him. “Camped outside of the Hospital Wing all day – along with half of Slytherin house no less. Whatever you’ve been doing, Mr Potter, you have a group of very loyal students at your back.”
“I think it’s different, then,” Blaise said. “You can’t tell me Crabbe or Goyle never killed anyone.”
“Malfoy?” Harry croaked, almost incredulously. As the name passed his lips, the blonde man materialized in front of him.
Harry let his hands move, skimming Draco’s calves, his thighs, dancing along the skin above the waistline of his pants. “I feel like,” Harry began. He stopped, gathered his thoughts, leaned into Draco’s touch on his chest. “Death follows me,” he said, almost sighed. “I dreamed that I went through the veil. You were there, you all were; you needed my help and I left. I just left.”
Harry sat heavily in the stool next to her, knowing better than to interrupt Hermione when she was angry. He didn’t fancy a flock of charmed birds flying at his head, thank you very much.
“Easier to think, actually,” Harry added. He pretended to ignore Hermione rolling her eyes. “I don’t have as many reasons to be angry anymore.”
“What is it, then?” asked Draco, looking mildly alarmed. Harry didn’t blame him; Pansy looked particularly murderous.
“I don’t think she can hold a grudge,” Ginny said with a sigh. It was obvious she was talking about Luna. “Now are you going to tell me why you aren’t speaking to my brother?”
“Probably,” he said, finally. He buried his face in Teddy’s hair and closed his eyes, focusing on the babbling of the boy in his hands.
Harry woke, hours later, groggy, confused, and mildly panicky when he realized Draco wasn’t in the bed. He only had a few seconds to panic, however, before Draco came out of the bathroom, hair damp but freshly dressed. When he saw Harry was awake, he grinned.
“You sound much too cheerful about that,” Harry responded. A strange warmth was pooling in his stomach, though. Sure, Hogwarts was undeniably different. But perhaps it was still home.
He not-so-surreptitiously rolled up his sleeves, showing his faded Mark. “I’m okay with – learning to be okay with that as a part of me. So hate me, I don’t care, Weasley. But Pansy is ten times the person either of you will ever be. Don’t touch her, don’t even fucking look at her or I swear to Merlin I will
Harry nodded and turned to watch Teddy play with the bubbles floating around above his head. Every time he popped one with his chubby little fingers, another appeared.
“I’ll be okay,” he said in response. It wasn’t really an answer, wasn’t what Draco was even asking, but it was the best he could give. Draco’s encouraging squeeze of his hand told him that he understood, too.
She engulfed him in a hug before he could protest. “I will always come, Harry,” she said, and he pretended it didn’t make him tear up just a little. Then she was off to collect Teddy from Ron and Hermione and Harry was leaving the Hospital Wing, nervous that there would be too many people waiting for him when all he really wanted to do was find Draco.
It didn’t matter anymore, in the Days After, who liked him, who believed him. There was no one to save anymore,
and here we're all caught up! hopefully a new chapter next week if i can get my life together, haha. i wanted to write more tonight but that was really, truly a *lot* of editing oof.
“The Sorting Hat wanted to put me in Slytherin when I was sorted,” he continued. Pansy looked up, shocked. “Everyone says it was because I had part of Voldemort’s soul in me, or something. I talked to Andromeda about it, too. She was Slytherin, you probably know that. She was horrid when she was younger, too. But Slytherin – ambition, cunning, valuing friendships, even – I don’t think any of those are bad traits, not any longer. And I think they all represent me, too. Maybe the House system has just been taken too far.
Yes, I hurt people. No, I never killed anyone. No – despite what you may believe, I did not hurt children at Hogwarts. It was not a noble choice, rather it was a line that I felt the Carrows crossed. Wizarding blood – even muggleborn wizarding blood – was worth more, in my eyes, than the blood of muggles. It wasn’t as though I wanted to see muggles killed, not at that point. No, I would have done anything for life to go back to the way it was, where I could continue to be quietly superior. But again, this was not because I believed muggles worthy of saving, rather because I believed no one worthy of killing. That isn’t a redeemable characteristic of mine, simply a self-serving characteristic.
She nodded once, as if he had passed some sort of test. “You’d best be careful,” she said, “Or you’ll make yourself a politician.”
“I’d like you to each take some time to read what I’ve handed out and then we’ll use the knowledge you’ve learned to help us list some of the similarities between these men, alright?” Most of the class nodded, but Arwen, raised her hand. Harry raised his eyebrow at her and gestured for her to speak.
“Give that to me,” Malfoy said suddenly. He took the lighter and cigarette from Harry’s hands, surprisingly gently. With one hand, he delicately placed the end in Harry’s mouth. With the other, he flicked the lighter to light it.
Ron and Hermione’s eyes were on him again, Harry could feel it. This time, they didn’t look away when he looked up. Hermione gave him a small smile, even from the distance across the table he could see her eyes glistening. Ron nodded, his arm firmly around Hermione’s shoulders, and even Neville gave him a funny look. Harry was hit with a feeling of
, Potter.” Harry jumped, accidentally jostling Draco’s head off of his shoulder. It was Blaise, who normally neve rose his voice. He was glaring daggers at Harry. “She didn’t do shit for us last year, left us to save ourselves, just like the rest of your stupid little army.”
“Potter, are you absolutely mental? They’ll hurt him, he can’t even use a wand!” she had jumped up and had a hand on the door already, looking particularly murderous.
Currently, Harry was in the garden with said child, doing push-ups while Teddy giggled in the grass. Andromeda had banned cigarettes from her house as soon as she had found Harry with them and had given him a good stripping down that included phrases like “ghastly muggle inventions” and “horrible for the child’s lungs”. Maybe in the Days Before, Harry would have rebelled and snuck them in anyways. He knew he hadn’t cared much for authority. In the Days After, though, Andromeda was right. It was horrible for Teddy to be around.
“I’ll only do it if he starts actually taking care of it,” Pansy said with a sniff. “Hair like Potter’s will ruin my reputation.”
“You’re not upset?” Harry asked, incredulous. He would be upset if his movements were being tracked, spells monitored, conversations listened to.
“Oi,” Harry said, although it was mostly false indignance. He was fairly certain he’d be rather useless, at least at first. Even if the Sorting Hat had almost put him in Slytherin, that didn’t mean he knew how to
All of this being said, I deeply apologize for the horrid person that I was, that I sometimes still am. Hermione, I targeted you constantly. I called you slurs, implied you were less than me but for a simple accident of birth. I will not bring up every incident – indeed there are likely too many to even recount here, but I am truly sorry for my deplorable actions. I am a better man now, and I will be better in the future. I understand how I have hurt you, how I contributed to a society that was bent on seeing you fail. I will no longer contribute to this. I will actively oppose these ideals for the rest of my life in any way that I can. You are welcome to hold me accountable for this.
He just looked at her, not sure what to say. His opinion was right, was reasonable – why wouldn’t people listen to him? He was the Saviour of the Wizarding World!
“Well Potter seems to have forgiven you, why can’t they? It’s not as though they were never cruel to you, either,” Blaise said, after a moment’s silence.
“No,” she said. “You’re here now, and if you’re going to stay you’re going to listen. You do not get to speak.”
were tortured, Weasley?” she asked, almost deathly quiet. Weasley, at least, had the sense to look abashed. Granger looked panicked. “Has the thought that Slytherins were tortured, too, never entered that thick skull of yours? You think they cared about anyone’s blood status and not just-” she cut off with a sob, Draco realized, horrified.
“Yes, Headmistress,” he responded, giving McGonagall a small smile. Between the amount of time he had spent here rebuilding over the summer and his near-daily meetings with McGonagall this year, he felt he knew her quite better than any other student did.
“Your room,” Harry groaned, mustering every ounce of self control to let go of Draco’s wrists and prop himself up slightly. “Let’s go there.”
“I’m okay,” Harry said instead, pulling back as much as he could to look Draco in the face, running his hands through the other boy’s hair again. Draco’s hand came up, tracing the lines of his cheekbones, running through his hair, which Harry was certain was even more unruly than usual.
“Let me disillusion you,” Draco whisphered into his ear. He had clearly follwed Harry up and was now pressed behind him, bare chest to bare back. Harry shuddered and nodded.
Did you know Lovegood is my cousin? A couple times removed, but nonetheless. And Ollivander – both are pureblood. Lovegood a blood traitor, perhaps, but I couldn’t see how that made her life any less worthy. And although she was a prisoner in my home, she became my source of comfort with stories of her mother and her life, her friends, her strange animals.
Harry smiled at her and she smiled tentatively back. “How about this,” he said. “Tonight I can come by the common room with Pansy and she can cut your hair. How does that sound?”
“I think there are more than just us two who feel like this,” Harry said carefully. “We just have to find the rest.”
“Worried you won’t have enough time for me?” Draco asked, then. He sounded confident, but Harry could feel the tremble in his body that gave him away. He rolled over and propped himself on top of Draco.
McGonagall gave them all a terse smile. “I have your papers here. I realize you had an early breakfast,” she continued, ingoring their shocked looks, “so I think early papers are in order.” She passed a piece of parchment to each of them. “Potter, I will see you in an hour, and you right after, Mr Malfoy. Ms Parkinson, I’ve arranged a floo call with your Professor since she will not be arriving at Hogwarts until the first day of term. All the students who chose Defence will be meeting outside my office three hours from now, when I am done speaking with Mr Malfoy. If you’d like to go first, I recommend you arrive with him.”
They all sat in silence for a moment – Draco hovering above his bed. He was more anxious now, if that was even possible. Pansy, who was never uncertain, never wavered,
Harry realized he hadn’t thought of this – whether or not the eighth years would contribute to the ranks of prefects or not. It wouldn’t have affected him, but Draco and Pansy had both been prefects.
“I probably should,” Harry sighed in agreement. He hadn’t spoken to them since the previous day’s catastrophe.
“Worried they’ll hate us?” he couldn’t see Draco’s expression in the dark, but could imagine the quirked, slightly unsure smile.
“That has got to be the least subtle way to enter or exit anywhere, ever,” Pansy sighed. Harry smirked at her, but didn’t say anything. His mind was still reeling.
“It was front page,” Harry said. “I only saw the headline. The Wizengamot passed a motion to track former Death Eaters.” He winced, almost, waiting for the exclamation of horror or anger but none came.
his bed, or his bed at Hogwarts at any rate, and the person shaking him awake definitely wasn’t Andromeda. It was Pansy.
“Oh, love,” Andromeda said with a sigh, breaking him out of his stupor. She reached out to take his hand. He clung back as if he were a child. “They will come around. I know it’s hard, but give them time. They’re grieving, too.”
“She means me,” Draco said after a moment. He disentangled his legs from Harry’s to stretch out. “I’m not supposed to be here, twat,” Draco continued at the confused look Harry shot him.
Draco continued to look at him expectantly, so Harry sighed and continued speaking. “We fought badly over the summer. About – a lot of things, I guess. But I think we fixed it today, a bit. So really, there’s nothing to worry about. We’re just…sort of friends.”
“Finally, Mr Filch has asked me to remind you that the Forbidden Forest is strictly off limits, and that all students should review the list of banned items posted in his office.”
There wasn’t anyone waiting for him, though – except Draco. He was looking away from the door when Harry stepped out, sat on the stone floor with his knees drawn to his chest. Harry leaned against the wall, taking a moment to watch him.
“We haven’t been anywhere without Pansy or Blaise all week,” Harry said, watching Draco intently. “I’m just saying, we can work on assignments when we’re with them.”
“Well you were the ones who got to spend all your time shut up in the Slytherin common room while other kids were tortured. We’ve heard the stories, you know – we’re not daft.” Draco saw Weasley’s blue eyes flash with anger and looked at him, almost incredulously, though he tried to hide it. He could almost feel the anger pouring from Pansy across from him.
Harry flinched every time the floo came to life and another one of his classmates stepped out. He couldn’t help it. In the Days Before, Harry had disliked travelling by floo, but hadn’t minded it either, not really. In the Days After, to put it simply, he was glad he and Draco had been the first to arrive, so no one but Professor McGonagall had to see him be sick in the potted plant in the corner of her office.
“You’re teaching us history, right?” Mar’s voice came from behind him as soon as he sat down. Plenty of the others seemed to find her annoying or weird, but Harry quite enjoyed her presence. Pansy, too, seemed to have taken a liking to her.
He stayed in the forest a long while, longer than he should have. No one said anything, though, when he missed lunch. Hermione had shot him a worried look as he passed by her, trailing after the Slytherins, but he didn’t stop to think about it, to talk. Instead, he followed the gentle pull of Draco’s hand in his, the small smile on Pansy’s face, Blaise’s enouraging arm around his shoulders.
Harry sighed and motioned to the tea in front of Hermione, watching her take a sip. He held his own mug in his hands, letting it warm him at least a little bit.
It was Pansy, though, that answered. “There are,” she said. “And I think the library has a great big book about them with pictures and everything.”
It wasn’t so surprising, not really. They had been children, raised for different purposes, on opposite sides of a war.
He let Draco kiss his shoulder while he tapped his head, the feeling of cold water running down him countered by Draco’s warm body and warm kiss made Harry shudder. In that moment, he knew two different things to be true.
Mar ran forward and, much to Harry’s amusement, flung her arms around Pansy. “Can you show me now?” she asked eagerly.
“Draco has choices now and he’s making the right ones. Have you seen how so many of the kids here interact with him and Pansy? You don’t have to like it, ‘Mione, but the DA failed here. And I’m not saying I expected them to keep putting themselves in harms’ way. We were all just kids. But when they left, when they hid by themselves, it was Draco and Pansy and Blaise and Daphne that took over. And it was them from the start, keeping the Slytherins safe.” Harry sighed. “No one is going to wake up the next morning and be over it. But we can at least start.”
“I can feel you watching me,” Draco drawled without looking over. Harry smirked, but didn’t move from where he was leaning.
,” he read in a monotone voice. “That’s easy. Medicine, psychology, they’ve been to the moon! All we can do is magic. If it’s a race of who’s superior, wizards lose.”
It made me realize, though, that for some people it was not about blood status or birth. It was simply about causing harm. How could I be part of that kind of a cause? It was the start, you could say, the start of the end. I feel as though I must reiterate, though, that I don’t believe this excuses me. I was guilty. I am guilty. I deserve consequences,
“Today is a day to rejoice,” she began clearly. Any remaining speaking in the hall had stopped. “For those of us who have come back to the castle, who are still able to find refuge in this place.”
“What are you waiting for? We need to go.” Pansy spoke as if he were particularly daft. Given the time of morning, he probably was.
Harry pocketed the Maruader’s Map as he pet the dog painting that led to Draco’s room. He hadn’t necesssarily been lying when he said he knew where Pansy had gone – it just wasn’t exactly the truth, either.
He was exceptionally grateful, then, to find tea and toast waiting for him in the spare classroom he and the Headmistress met in. She held a deep hatred for the portraits of the ex-headmasters and their constant need to give opinions, so they hardly ever met in her actual office. Harry wasn’t even certain if she ever used it.
He looked as he always did these days, slight and tired. His eyes had their now characteristic bags, his hair was long – nearing his shoulders, and mussed. He was wearing muggle clothes, jeans and a sweater. Harry thought it was frightfully attractive, though he’d never say it.
“Right,” Harry managed, reaching for the piece of toast Draco offered him. He didn’t really feel like eating, but he also wanted everyone to stop looking so
“Yeah,” Harry said. “But I grieved. And I came around. So did Ginny. Draco grieved and practically relearned how to exist in society. Why is it taking them so long?”
They had stopped walking. Draco’s eyes were on him, serious and bright. He didn’t know, really, who Draco was trying to convince – Harry, or himself.
“Pomfrey does, I think,” he said instead of answering her other question. At a raised eyebrow from her, though, he continued on. “I just…needed a break. For a minute.” He took a sip of his tea.
“Harry James Potter? Think before he acts? That’s preposterous,” she said. Hermione didn’t laugh, but he could hear the lightness in her tone.
“Worried you won’t have enough time for me?” Draco asked, then. He sounded confident, but Harry could feel the tremble in his body that gave him away. He rolled over and propped himself on top of Draco. They were hardly clothed, he could feel every touch of Draco’s skin to his like fire.
Harry leaned in towards Zabini. “Reckon any arrangement is fine so long as I don’t end up sharing a room with Smith.”
Harry gave him a hard look, not entirely convinced but unsure how to argue – unsure if Draco would be upset if he pushed more.
“I guess I never realized that there were children coming to Hogwarts without any sort of school before that,” Harry said. “It must be hard.”
It seemed to bring the nerves back in the group – they all shifted uncomfortably for a moment. The boy who suggested the name Mari piped up again, looking distinctly more nervous this time. “I heard it’s in the dungeons,” he said, quietly.
cried leaving in a flood of tears had done more to shake his confidence than anything had since the war itself. He sat down heavily on Harry’s bed, and it seemed to shake everyone out of their surprised stupor.
Draco had a free period in the morning while Blaise had Care of Magical Creatures, Pansy had a meeting with Professor Stone, and Harry had Arithmancy. His Arithmancy happened to be in conjunction with the fourth years on this particular day, although he’d be in a separate classroom watching through a one-way magical hole in the wall. It was still slightly embarrassing. McGonagall had assured him that it wouldn’t take him long to progress to the level of a fifth year, but sharing classes with fifth years wasn’t that much better, in Harry’s opinion.
“No,” Draco ground out. Even after all this time - although it hadn’t really been that long since the war, sometimes it felt like ages – the insinuation that he didn’t enjoy hurting people –
It wasn’t until she had swooped forward and wrapped him in a hug that he realized he had been crying, tear tracks tracing their way down his face and into the soft cashmere of her jumper. A wail sounded from down the hall.
“Fine,” groused Draco as he sat back down on the bed. Harry looked at him in concern, he was picking at his sleeve on his left arm – right where the Dark Mark sat on his skin.
After a quick shower they headed towards the Great Hall together. With the whole school now back, it seemed much safer to eat in the Great Hall again. It was harder for the other eighth years to follow them, and even then their interest seemed to have gone from something that felt genuinely dangerous to whispered comments and threats.
He couldn’t just leave Teddy. He couldn’t bear to have the small boy out of his sight. Andromeda had already promised up and down that she would attend as many Hogwarts meals with Teddy as possible, but Harry wasn’t entirely sure he’d make it to the hols without having his godson with him everywhere he went. Teddy had Andromeda, he knew, but she wouldn’t be able to take care of him forever. Better if Harry started sooner. Plus, the three of them in Andromeda’s small cottage had begun to feel like family, even moreso than the Weasleys had ever been. It was the first time he wondered how children like Ron and Ginny were ever excited at the prospect of going away to boarding school for the year.
Harry sat up, felt his eyebrows furrow. “Come on,” he said finally, standing up and grabbing both their shirts off the floor. He headed down the hall towards his room, pausing to place the monitoring spell on Teddy’s room along the way. He didn’t wait to see if Draco would follow – knew he would. In the Days Before, Harry never would have been so bold.
“Why are you here?” Harry asked, once his words had returned. He hadn’t seen Malfoy since his trial in front of the Wizengamot. Harry had returned Malfoy his wand, then. Had spoken in his defence. But had not stuck around to see the results of the trial. Hermione had insisted he shouldn’t get too invested, that he couldn’t save everyone. She was right, of course. Eventually, days had faded into weeks, and he had stopped being curious about the outcome.
“Not completely,” she said. “But I will let Minerva know what we discussed and see if she has anything to say to it. Don’t try anything until she approves, alright?”
After a minute of this, Draco disentangled himself slowly. “What was that for?” Harry asked finally, once his breath was back. He let Draco lead him to the bed and threw himself on top of it, utterly exhausted.
If Andy was here, Teddy must be somewhere – and Harry was torn between desperately wanting to see the boy but not wanting him to see Harry in a hospital bed, even if he was too young to understand what it meant.
She lunged forward and flung her arms around him. “Thank you,” she said into his shoulder. Then she jumped back almost as abruptly as she had leapt forward. With one last, wary look at Ron and Hermione, she ran off. Hopefully, Harry thought, to do homework and not stir up anymore trouble.
Pansy’s eyes lit up and she leaned forward towards them. “Apparently, McGonagall is making an annoucement tonight, and she may or may not have let slip what that exact announcement will be.”
That’s why he smoked, he reflected, taking a long drag of the cigarette. Smoking receded the shadows. It calmed his breathing when everything was too much.
But Harry didn’t get to hear what it sounded like, because at that moment a knock on the door sounded, followed by hushed voices from the other side. Everyone looked at each other for a moment before three sets of eyes landed on Harry.
I learned plenty during the two months (and the rest of the summer) other than chemistry, of course. I have read – so much, more than I ever thought I would – muggle literature until it felt like my eyes would bleed. Everything Minerva could get for me. And we spoke for hours, some days – about how I was raised, how I was horrid, how I cannot change that but perhaps I can change my future. Muggles start wars over race, religion, any number of idiotic things just as wizards do. And it turns these small differences in people into life-or-death variances. I understand this now. I understand that I contributed to this culture of oppression and violence and I will not participate anymore.
He would miss this. He would miss Andromeda and Teddy, the peace of the cottage. He’d miss visiting Hogwarts and Draco quietly, having tea with McGonagall. He’d miss flying with Charlie, who was going back to Romania, anyways.
“Don’t make me regret this,” she mumbled to him as they sat down at a table directly beside Draco and Luna. Draco shot him a concerned look as well, which he ignored, choosing instead to raise his eyebrows in Luna’s direction. Draco merely shrugged in response, but Harry could see him fiddling with his shirt on his left forearm again.
I quite enjoy this chapter for Harry although I realize there isn’t much Draco in it. But we’ll see him again next chapter<333
“I don’t think she can hold a grudge,” Ginny said with a sigh. It was obvious she was talking about Luna. “Now are you going to tell me why you aren’t speaking to my brother?”
“Firstly,” she continued, through the whispers of other concerned students, “You will be working with dangerous, volatile potions and ingredients. I do not want to see anyone getting hurt. If you’re fighting with a friend, an ex, an enemy – that all stays at the door. In this classroom I expect everyone, especially my oldest students, to be calm and respectful. If you cannot manage that, you will be asked to leave and to make up your work on your own time.”
Harry could see, now, the leader Neville had become in the past year – the leader he had needed to become. Harry had thought his heart had been broken before now; broken to never be mended, that he could not possibly feel it break any more than it had, but it did. It broke a little more for Neville and the DA and all the children that had been left to their own devices at Hogwarts under the rule of Alecto and Amycus Carrow.
Mar ran forward and, much to Harry’s amusement, flung her arms around Pansy. “Can you show me now?” she asked eagerly.
Neville looked like he was going to be sick, but was the first to speak up. “No problems, Headmistress. I was just going.”
He just looked at her, not sure what to say. His opinion was right, was reasonable – why wouldn’t people listen to him? He was the Saviour of the Wizarding World!
Did you know Lovegood is my cousin? A couple times removed, but nonetheless. And Ollivander – both are pureblood. Lovegood a blood traitor, perhaps, but I couldn’t see how that made her life any less worthy. And although she was a prisoner in my home, she became my source of comfort with stories of her mother and her life, her friends, her strange animals.
“Common Room,” Blaise said with finality. “We can hunt for some sixth or seventh years to help us with muggle studies.”
As they sat, Harry looked up to see Neville had abandoned his seat to make his say over to them. He pulled up a seat beside Harry and perched himself gingerly upon it, looking around furtively as if worried he’d be seen. Harry gave a glance around the room, but mostly people were talking amongst themselves. The only ones wo were looking were Dean and Seamus, which Harry expected, and Zacharias Smith. Harry saw out of the corner of his eye all three Slytherin’s lean in closely towards Neville and Harry.
Pansy was pacing. Harry thought she looked shocked from her own outburst, was sure she had planned to say something more eloquently. But she looked the Headmistress in the eye and didn’t back down.
“Every single person in this room lost someone – whether it was a parent, a sibling, or a friend. Every single student in this room lost part of their childhood to He Who Must Not be Named. Many of you,” she nodded towards the Slytherin table as she spoke, “lost your faith in Hogwarts, and the people here who should have protected you.”
He leaned out over the edge of the Astronomy Tower, cigarette resting between his lips, and gazed out at the shadowy outline of the Hogwarts grounds. They were all here, of course, to celebrate and to mourn. Everyone had been offered a bed to stay in for the night. Naturally, most Gryffindors Harry’s age were currently seated in the Common Room, getting pissed on Odgen’s firewhisky and cheap muggle rum.
They turned to their work, then, and Harry put his head back down on the table with a thump. He felt Draco’s hand on his knee, and leaned into the touch before forcing his head back up and taking out a piece of parchment.
“Set Teddy down, love, and go shower,” she said to him without looking up. Harry smiled to himself. Having someone to care for had kept Andy busy and seemed to keep her grief at bay. Being cared for did the same for Harry in the Days After.
Andromeda hadn’t come through with them, of course, but he was sorely missing her presence. Saying goodbye to Teddy, too, had made him feel as though he was ripping his heart into tiny little pieces.
“You don’t think she’s a Squib, do you?” she asked. She didn’t seem upset, Harry made sure to note, but she did seem confused. He shrugged in response, but tried to puzzle it out himself. There were other squibs on the staff, of course, like Filch, so it wouldn’t be surprising.
“Knock on your solid stone door? Or is it better to slap your dog portrait until he barks?” Pansy snapped, but she still came around and sat on the foot of the bed. Blaise deposited himself on Draco’s chair.
“I need to…” he said, and paused. What he needed, in all honesty, was to talk to Andromeda and hold Teddy. Niether of those were options.
Andromeda just shook her head, looking exasperated. “Start with that, then. Something simple that has fond memories. It may not go well at first, but you’ll be able to work on your control. And your trust.”
“Who’s your professor for the year?” Pansy asked him, breaking Harry away from his thoughts. The previous day at lunch, Professor McGonagall had asked them to each think at length about where they wanted their future to head, and choose a professor to help guide them. She had explained that they would experience everything from one-on-one mentoring to helping with classes, to extra, more advanced studying. They hadn’t been given much time – they were required to have a foot of parchment written on which professor they’d like to work with and why to be handed in to McGonagall at dinner. At breakfast today, they were to find out what professor they had been assigned and to meet with them at some point throughout the day.
They all sat in silence for a moment – Draco hovering above his bed. He was more anxious now, if that was even possible. Pansy, who was never uncertain, never wavered,
“Does anyone know the name of another wizard who started wars before Riddle, when many of your grandparents or great-grandparents were young?”
Thankfully, there were no forced partnerships for the rest of the day, and they didn’t have any more classes with the Gryffindors. Harry wasn’t able to eat at lunch, still feeling too sick from the morning’s events. Draco seemed to be feeling much the same. By the time evening came, both were exhausted, so Blaise offered to go to with Pansy to show Mar the library while Harry and Draco got some rest.
Thanks to Draco’s insistence that they begin eating in the kitchens again, at least until Harry was feeling better, Harry was able to avoid any questioning by other students until Monday evening. He, Draco, Pansy, and Blaise had made their way to the Slytherin common room after dinner intent on getting some work done without being distracted by the rowdy eighth years. Professor McGonagall had announced that the sixth through eighth years were to meet in the Great Hall at eight o’clock that night. Harry and Draco knew why, but no one else did – not even Blaise and Pansy.
“Why would she be mean?” Mar asked, looking confused. Harry did his best to keep his cool. He would tell Pansy about this as soon as he could. They would figure out what to do.
“To fill the Muggle Studies post, we have Professor Strickland.” A lady in muggle clothes stood up and waved to the crowd. A rush of mutters went around the room, including from Pansy, who nudged him.
“Okay,” a couple voices chorused back, and then there was silence – or mostly silence – as they all set quill to paper.
going to remember that password,” he groaned. The Gryffindor boys at the front laughed, and then the tension was broken and they surged in.
“I don’t know why she would be mean,” he settled on saying. “People can be mean for a lot of reasons. Maybe she was having a bad day.”
He had turned to exercise instead. It was almost more helpful, and it kept him outside for hours every day. He’d filled out from the combination of food and his workout regime, was less the scrawny child he’d always been.
He half stood up to reach out to her, but she was already at the door. She gave one look back, not at him, but at Potter. “I can’t, I’m sorry.” And then she was gone.
Harry’s breathing began to slow, his brain catching up to his surroundings. He was in Howarts, he was perfectly safe, and he recognized that voice.
He missed her more than he had thought he would, for someone who had only been in his life for a short time. He felt his eyes glisten slightly and winced to himself. In the Days before, he would have been angry. In the Days After, he was apparently just a sap.
“You’re just jealous you don’t have hair as nice as mine,” Draco said, reaching up to tug a strand of Harry’s hair – rather harder than necessary.
“They’re probably your Gryffindor’s, anyway,” Blaise said when Harry turned a pleading look on him. Since it was clear that no one else was going to help him, Harry hauled himself up with a sigh, careful not to touch any of his papers strewn over the bed.
“Noticed you don’t have a room, Death Eater,” came a voice in front of them. It was Zacharias Smith, of course. Harry was utterly unsurprised, although he was more surprised to see Justin, Ernie, and Seamus flanking him.
Harry paused, realizing he was definitely rambling. Ron was looking at him in a sort of bemused way, but Hermione seemed fascinated.
“Alright,” said Harry, relaxing slightly. Ron and Hermione were being…incredibly infuriating, of course, but that didn’t mean he wanted to see them hurt – or to have hurt them. “So – what happens now?” he asked, before his thoughts could take him further than he needed to go. “Am I alright now?”
“You don’t need magic for History of Magic, so I see no reason why not,” she responded after giving him a level look. “However, if you are having difficulty catching up with your school work please inform me. Professor Binns will be able to substitute for you if you need.”
Harry felt Smith’s eyes lock onto him. “There’s no reason for you to be around them, Harry. We can talk to McGonagall, or the Minister. I’m sure they’d switch your rooms for you. If anyone desrves their own rooms, it’s you. Not this scum.” He indicated Draco with a jutt of his chin.
“Didn’t McGonagall say the new potions professor was willing to unofficially take you on?” Blaise asked, grabbing Draco’s timetable out of his hands. “That’s not even on your timetable yet, I’m sure some of those slots will fill.”
He gasped as Draco’s lips came back up to his, let himself go pliant underneath Draco’s hands, too tired to really do anything except
“What if,” he said finally, meeting Andy’s eyes for the first time. “What if I wasn’t supposed to come back? What if it…threw off some sort of balance? Like in the Tale of the Three Brothers. They couldn’t escape Death forever. You can’t run from it. What if…what if this is my way of dying again? Restoring balance?”
In hindsight, perhaps inviting Draco Malfoy to Andromeda’s house had been Harry’s second particularly stupid decision after the war. The first being that night on the astronomy tower, of course.
“You wait,” said Andromeda, prompting another sigh from Harry. “You let them know you’re there for them, then you give them space and you wait.”
“I wonder why that is,” she responded delicately. She was definitely making fun of him, in her own weird way. He fought the urge to blush.
He had spent the summer pulling strings at the ministry, too. Himself, Andromeda, and Professor McGonagall of all people, to be exact. It had ended, after appeals to the Wizengamot and the Minister for Magic himself, with permission for Draco to visit his mother and Andromeda as long as he provided a written request to the Ministry a week before and did not bring his wand.
Pomfrey insisted on giving Harry one finally check up, which he sat through with an air of annoyance. He really just wanted to leave the Hospital Wing, knew Draco and Blaise and Pansy were waiting for him.
“Ask you friends,” Draco spoke up, then. “Ask your pathetic friends what happened in the castle after they saved their own skin and abandoned everyone else – even first years, to the Carrows. Ask them who stepped in to help when they were gone.”
“She’s a muggle, I met her over the summer. Didn’t realize she’d be teaching though.” Harry couldn’t see him, but imagined he was looking very smug right now.
His breathing was coming faster, now. He hand’t stared down the other end of a wand since Voldemort; he hadn’t thought his first day back at Hogwarts would find him doing the same thing. He couldn’t think of any spells to cast, couldn’t move all of a sudden. It was like everything in him was frozen and screaming, like the night Dumbledore had petrified him on the Astronomy Tower. Bile rose in his throat and he swallowed it down.
I know what you’re thinking – surely once I was at Hogwarts I should have learned to think differently. You’re right, of course. I should have. But even here, I did not learn about muggles or muggleborns. I was surrounded by others who thought those without pure blood had no place in the school. No, it’s not an excuse. I could have listened – I was too proud, too set in my ways, too determined to please my father. It’s not an excuse, I’m not trying to make excuses.
“Mandatory even for muggleborn students?” Hermione asked immediately. Harry sighed to himself, nodded at her.
“How did you meet her?” Blaise asked from Draco’s other side. Harry felt Draco’s chest shake with laugher against his back.
The knocking came for a second time before Harry finally made it to the door. It opened to reveal the faces of Ron and Hermione, as Blaise had predicted.
Predictably, Gryffindor cheered. The man who stood up and waved also seemed quite young, although older than the two other professors that had been introduced. He was rather handsome, too, Harry thought – quite tall, with sandy blonde hair and broad shoulders. He certainly
“Pomfrey does, I think,” he said instead of answering her other question. At a raised eyebrow from her, though, he continued on. “I just…needed a break. For a minute.” He took a sip of his tea.
Harry accepted the offered change of subject. “Yeah,” he said simply. “I had trouble leaving Andromeda’s for Hogwarts, this year. Didn’t want to go. I think it will be nice to have them back. But I’m worried…” he trailed off.
The second, that he would do whatever Draco wanted, whatever he needed, because in the Days After it seemed that there was one thing that was important: Draco Malfoy was inevitable.
Harry ran his hand through his hair. A couple times. These were the kinds of things he needed Pansy for. Mar had started tapping her collarbone, though, like she often did. And the more he let the silence go on, the faster she tapped. He gathered himself together in a deep breath.
Harry turned an amused look downward to where Draco was lying. “I do?” he asked pointedly. Draco merely smiled innocently at him.
He shivered, just for a moment, at the cool air before it was replaced by Draco’s warm breath, kissing and biting and licking his thighs, his hips, everywhere except
Once they were in an empty hallway, Pansy removed the charm. It was just in time, too – as they started on again, a group of young looking Hufflepuffs came around the corner and nearly ran into them. Instead of shock or fear the group squealed.
He couldn’t have, not really. Not when the world needed him to defeat Voldemort, and especially not now that Teddy needed him. But it was his one selfish wish.
Harry let out a laugh that sounded more like a choke. “Like that,” he said. “Draco is always mean before he has his coffee.”
When he entered the kitchen, he mostly expected it to be empty. But it wasn’t - he noticed the telltale sniffs of someone crying, first, before his eyes even registered who it was.
“What’s going on?” he asked, once he felt more oriented. Pansy was sitting up on his left, glaring at Blaise, who was standing over her. Draco was still curled up beside Harry, their legs tangled underneath the bedsheets. Ahh DS Ah FHalf of him wanted to stay like this all day.
Harry found it within him to give the other boy an amused smile. “I feel like I have to disagree with that on principle,” he said, “but you probably aren’t incorrect.”
“I wasn’t always the Dark Lord’s favourite,” Draco gasped out. “I was particularly useless, most of the time.”
“I know what you’re thinking – that you would have done the same as Neville. I’m saying it wouldn’t matter. Nothing mattered, that year. The war might have been won, but we all lost. You’d care now; I’d care now. That’s what’s important.”
“And on that note,” McGonagall said, smiling warmly down at all the students. Harry felt almost eleven years old again. “Please make your way to your common rooms. First years, your House Guardians will meet you at your table and guide you to your Common Room.”
“You can,” came a voice from behind him – Pansy’s voice. Draco had come with her, and he pressed the back of his hand against the back of Harry’s hand when they approached.
“Not the really big ones,” Jason said. The other first years nodded their agreement. Honestly, Harry thought, they had a point.
Harry felt him nod along with the others as they triapsed out of the Common Room, the door grinding closed behind them. “What does the password mean?” Harry asked as they left.
“Alright,” Hermione responded primly. Harry grabbed a jumper off his bed-post before gently closing the door behind him and following his sort-of friends into the corridor.
also, i promise more smut next chapter ahdksfdja apparently we had to get all the post war trauma out this chapter!!!
“Don’t act like you were the only ones who suffered,” Pansy continued angrily. “Don’t act like you’re so righteous. What happned last year, Longbottom? I’ll tell you. You and your cronies painted some stupid graffiti, acted like it was the most rebellious thing in the world. Then Corner got hurt and what happened? You
Harry sighed. He could feel Hermione’s eyes boring through the back of his head, refused to turn back, to see the judgement of Mar he knew must be on their faces. He focused on Mar, who was hitting her leg now, with the bottom of her fist. Not hard enough to hurt, but he was worried, a bit.
their own. So no Gryffindor eighth years for Gryffindor houses, no Ravenclaws for Ravenclaws, Hufflepuffs for Hufflepuffs or Slytherin’s for Slytherins. What if someone like Zacharias Smith gets put with Slytherin?” Harry felt Draco tense beside him, saw Blaise’s eyes flicker and the dark look he cast at Pansy.
But there was no place for the Slytherins to take refuge. It was hurt or be hurt, and knowing them now he knew that they would choose to hurt – most people would, really. He knew, too, that there were students from every house that had participated. To place the blame on the Slytherins alone felt…irresponsible, almost. Especially for a war that was so brutal because of a madman’s ability to pit children against children.
He stopped to kiss Teddy, who was now happily in his bouncer in the sitting room, before following Draco to the kitchen. Teddy’s high chair had been moved over to make a seat for Draco around the small kitchen table.
It was clearly not the type of evening where any work was getting done, though. They curled up on the couch in front of the fire, Draco with his head in Harry’s lap and legs across Pansy and Blaise, the latter seated with his back to the armrest of the couch so he could face everyone, talking aimlessly amongst themselves.
Harry laughed to himself. McGonagall had been trying to find out from him what exactly was the cause of the strange dynamic between the eighth years, but he had refused to say anything. Better it come from the mouths of the Slytherins, if they decided to tell her.
