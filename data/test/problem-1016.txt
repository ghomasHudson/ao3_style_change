“Kingsley Shacklebolt. He used to work for the Ministry. Did he–?” He turned back to Weasley who waved a hand.
After all this time.
Snow still fell around them and he wrapped his arms around himself as he walked, trying to keep warm as a chill wind stroked over his face. Hermione lit the tip of her wand and stared around at the empty clearing. Whatever tracks there might have been, the falling snow had covered them.
without the venom that had coloured it throughout their school years, but it was still a shock to hear it.
There was a series of bangs and the noise of the battle suddenly came back. All around them the school was shaking and Draco pressed himself back against the wall as a parade of ghostly figures went charging by on horses, severed heads held high, screaming a war cry. Harry got to his feet and helped Draco up, and Draco took the opportunity to wrap his arms around Harry’s neck and kiss him. He tasted of soot and parchment.
"Dinnae do anything stupid," he told them all, in a thick brogue. "When ye ge' tae th' location, assume formation but bide for my signal. If tha' bastard Malfoy - nae offence, mind," he said, looking at Malfoy who nodded dumbly, "If he is waitin' for us, cast tae stun only," Everyone nodded. Begbie crossed his arms over his massive, barrel-like chest, and called forward the first team members to Apparate. Four Aurors stepped forward, and he counted down for them, all four turning and disappearing with a
“Your mother–”
This was Draco’s home, but it didn’t feel like that anymore. The comfort he had once found by being enclosed in the stone walls of Malfoy Manor had long since disappeared during the course of this last hellish summer. Everywhere he turned, he found unfamiliar faces skulking in rooms or stalking down corridors and he had taken to hiding in his rooms, hoarding what books he could snatch from the library while it was empty, and feigning sickness whenever his mother asked him to join her and their
’ and beneath her dates of birth and death, another line – ‘
His mother embraced him on the platform and Draco squirmed a little, but let her have this comfort. “I shall write,” she murmured into his ear, before pulling away. “Especially about Albert. I know how much that peacock means to you, and how old he’s getting. If anything happens, I’ll let you know,” she said, loud enough for their minders to hear, and any frown on his face Draco wiped away in an instant.
?!” he asked and the elf gave him a pleased smile.
"Thank you, Harry," he said Harry quirked an eyebrow at him. Malfoy shrugged. "It seems ridiculous to call you by your surname in what was previously our marital home," he pointed out and Harry swallowed his reply. He merely nodded and then led the way up the stairs, hugging Albus' jumper close to his chest.
“Bathilda?” Potter repeated, pointing at her. She nodded again and Potter pressed a hand to his chest, as if feeling for something hanging there. The woman’s milky eyes were tracked on Potter and she shuffled past Granger, pushing her out of the way as though she hadn’t noticed her, and disappeared into the dingy sitting room beyond. Granger cast a look at where she believed Draco was still standing by the front door, though she looked someway to the right of him, and then she focused her attention on Potter, who was gazing after Bathilda Bagshot.
Had it all been a very elaborate dream? Draco thought it might have been. He picked up the cup and set it on the tray on the table next to his chair. Then he stood up and walked over to his bed, climbing onto it and lying down, not bothering to change. His wand lay serenely on the bedside table, barely touched since he had returned home for the summer holidays, and he didn’t bother to pick it up and cast a deafening charm around the bed.
"I hope it's not as dreary on the inside as it was when I left," he murmured and Harry scowled at him, storming off towards the front door steps. He pulled his wand free of its concealed pocket and tapped it against the door, which clicked open. Inside, the lights flared to life, a gentle welcoming glow which Harry felt at odds with.
“We might need to knock him out,” someone else said grimly behind him and another voice made a pained noise.
“You don’t think–?” Hermione started but Draco shook his head.
“He loved you,” he said firmly and Potter’s piercing gaze snapped on him, haunted. Draco felt himself shiver slightly but he pressed on. “He
“I know,” he said with regret. Draco wrapped his arms tighter around himself and shivered. “Hermione, I’m sorry, I’m really–”
“Harry, could this be –? Aargh!” Hermione let out a scream of pain and whatever she had been holding clattered to the floor. Draco turned around sharply and his elbow caught on a pile of coins, sending them raining down onto the stone slabs underfoot. No sooner had they landed then there were a series of sharp ‘
“I’ve got food,” Aberforth said and he ducked out of the room. Harry came and sat on the arm of Draco’s armchair and Draco patted his thigh, tilting his head to rest it against Harry’s ribs. Aberforth reappeared a minute or so later with a large loaf of bread, some cheese, and a pewter jug of mead, which he set down on the small table in front of the fireplace.
Harry’s hand was warm in his, and even when Mrs Weasley’s eyes lingered on their intertwined fingers, she didn’t say anything. She only looked between them and then raised an eyebrow at Draco, who gave her a single nod. She shrugged and turned away, watching as one of her sons (one of the twins), indicated to himself and his brother. Draco thought he had better tune in again, and he turned to look at Kingsley.
“Good evening Draco,” he heard from behind him and he turned, slowly.
Silence fell again. Draco felt like his breath had been stolen, the very air from his lungs snatched away, as Harry stood still under the full weight of the gaze from everyone in the room. There was a rustle of noise from the Slytherin side of the hall and Draco glanced over to see that Pansy had stood up.
“There’s someone over there. Someone watching us, I can tell. There, over by the bushes,” Granger said and Draco edged closer.
He nodded, stepping out of Harry’s arms, numb to all else but grief. He did not look back as he ducked into the tunnel they had crawled out of. The castle grounds were still and silent around them and despite the early hour, even though dawn was fast approaching, the darkness seemed thick and impenetrable.
There was one perfect second of silence and then the tumult broke around the hall. The sun set the Great Hall ablaze as the crowd surged forward, Draco, Ron and Hermione at the forefront, running for Harry. They met him with arms outstretched, and Draco, desperate, kissed every part of Harry’s face that he could reach, yelling incomprehensible things in his ear as Hermione sobbed and Ron bellowed in victory.
Hermione had told him weeks ago that Potter loved him too. The thought still gave him a hot thrill, and he tried to tamper down the flush on his cheeks as he opened his eyes and directed the spell.
"They're not your sons. You… you walked away, you signed all the paperwork, you didn't raise them. Merlin, you didn't even turn up for their first journey to Hogwarts, you can't possibly think that they're your sons," Harry spat out at him, shaking Luna off and rising to his feet. Malfoy scowled at him, his eyes ablaze.
“Harry?” he called across the crowd, and they all turned to look in Harry’s direction. Draco stepped away from Hermione and pushed his way through the crowd, fighting back against the arms that held him a bit away, intentionally or not. “Let me through!” he snapped. Harry swayed where he stood and Ron caught him, holding him upright. “Let me through, Merlin damn you!” Draco snapped again and a fifth-year Hufflepuff stepped away, aghast. Draco stumbled through the gap and was next to Harry in an instant. Thankfully, he was coming round.
“Good morning. You have three hours to complete your Specialised 1 paper. Please turn over your papers and begin,” the Fellow from the night before announced to the hall. There was a wave of rustling paper noises and then the hall fell silent.
“What will happen to your children when I’ve killed you?” Bellatrix taunted and Draco turned his attention back to her. She was grinning madly, practically dancing around the curses that Mrs Weasley fired at her. “When Mummy’s gone the same way as Freddie?” she sneered and Draco couldn’t help himself – he stepped forward.
“You have fought valiantly,” a high, cold voice pierced the room and they all stilled. The Dark Lord was speaking. “Lord Voldemort knows how to value bravery. Yet you have sustained heavy losses. If you continue to resist me, you will all die, one by one. I do not wish this to happen. Every drop of magical blood spilled is a loss and a waste. Lord Voldemort is merciful.” Hermione scoffed at that. “I command my forces to retreat immediately. You have one hour. Dispose of your dead with dignity. Treat your injured.
!” he shouted again and Hermione screamed as a green jet of light went down another aisle.
His lips were cool and dry against Draco’s and his glasses were crushed uncomfortably against Draco’s cheek, but he didn’t care, he reached up and took hold of Potter’s face between his hands and brought him closer, pressing his body to the hard line of Potter’s, kissing him, kissing him until they had to break apart, both gasping for air.
"We don't know it was a kidnapping yet, Sir, unless you know something we don't," Thompson said a bit snidely, walking around the edge of his desk, reaching out one hand placatingly towards Harry. Harry reached instead for the front of Thompson's deep burgundy robes and grabbed a handful of fabric by his throat, hauling him close.
"Albus is on the Slytherin team, you know," he said and Malfoy's mouth quirked.
“‘Allo,” he said simply in a stuffy French accent, and Travers withdrew, looking charmed by their foreign guests.
Once they were done, all three of them worked together to raise the tent, and once that was up, Draco turned to gather kindling for a fire, but Hermione stopped him with a hand to the shoulder.
“You pulled a sword out of a hat?” he asked incredulously and Potter scowled at him.
“What are you using it for?” he asked and Potter shrugged but did not answer. The Snitch fluttered by, catching the firelight and turning burnished for a flash. Draco, without thinking, reached up a hand and caught it before Potter could and was left breathless once more by the smile Potter gave him.
“Did you have any focus in that?” he asked and Malfoy nodded, casting them both a wary glance.
They made a strange funeral procession, and they paused to carefully place Fred’s body in a niche where a knight had one stood. Ron knelt down to close his brother's eyes and then straightened. Draco checked that the body was well hidden and then nodded.
"Yes, Bel. The others are staying, but go home soon, alright?" he said, pulling his robe on, and she nodded, going back to her dictation. It felt very strange, a little forced, a little hollow, to have a similar conversation to the one they had every evening, but he couldn't think of what to say, and from the look on her face, neither could Belinda. Harry left, with Malfoy trailing behind him like a silent, pale shadow.
“It says Ig– Ignotus, I think…” she murmured, reaching up a hand to brush off the stone again as Potter straightened, jamming his hands into his jacket pockets.
Her eyes grew wide and she stopped struggling, her arm raised overhead, Father still holding on to it, looking rumpled. Draco followed her gaze as his father, triumphant, dropped her arm and began to lift his own sleeve to reveal his Dark Mark, but Bellatrix shouted and stopped them all in their tracks.
With a surge of emotion that threatened to break him, Harry shook off Hermione's hand and reached forward, taking Draco's shirt in his fist and pulling him close, catching his mouth in a searing kiss. His glasses were crushed awkwardly into his nose, and his hand was trapped between them, but Harry felt something inside himself surge to life again, even as the rest of him felt like he was lost and alone in the dark.
Draco’s Boggart had turned into his father. Lupin had only looked at him with kindness.
“I wouldn’t,” the words sounded dragged out even to Draco, like he was hearing them from a thousand miles away. “You should have killed me as well. Sent my body over the battlements to land next to his,” he said and Snape looked horrified, his eyebrows raised, his lips parted a little. Draco looked away first. “It would’ve been a kinder fate than this,” he said quietly, and Snape said nothing in reply. They lapsed into silence, the only sound in the Orangery the rustle of flowers and leaves as a breeze stirred the nasturtium once more.
“Join me?” Snape asked, gesturing to the pair of upholstered chairs that were framed by the nasturtium that Draco’s mother cultivated. The orange and yellow blossoms swayed in the small breeze coming through the windows, and Draco settled himself into the chair facing the door, slipping his finger free of his book and holding it shut in his lap – if Snape noticed his deliberate choice of seat, he didn’t comment as he folded himself into the opposite chair, gathering his habitual black robes around him.
The motley crew wound their way up the cobblestone street to the white bricked building that stood out brilliantly in the grimy dawn. It was not ideal. With the addition of Travers, Draco could not feed information to Hermione while looking like a curious foreign guest, and Harry could not communicate with any of them. Draco felt a tug on the back of his robes which he was sure was Harry letting him know he was there, but there was no way to check.
, forgive myself for that night. And if you think he wasn’t capable of change, what do you think about me really?” he asked and before he could say anything further, he turned on his heel and stormed back into the tent, locking himself into the small bathroom and tucking himself in between the sink and the bath, making himself as small as possible while he cried into his arms.
The cottage loomed out of the darkness like a shipwreck under the waves. The hedge was wild around it, and there was rubble, large stones and pieces of singed wood, peeking through the snow-laden grass. The cottage, to Draco’s great surprise, was still standing, though was mostly covered in dark ivy and snow. The right side of the top floor looked like an explosion had blasted through it, the plaster on the front of the building still blackened with soot after all this time. The window panes had shattered, either by the force or in the intervening years, and Draco saw the remaining fragments twinkle in the dim light from the stars.
“Lunch?” she asked and Harry nodded.
“I should too,” they girls bid everyone goodnight and disappeared upstairs. Somewhere in the midst of all the revelry, Griphook had also managed to slip away. Dean and Weasley helped to clear the last of the dinner things and the window panes began to rattle as the storm built around them.
“It was the best I think Dobby could find. I’m grateful for it though. It’s just a shame any heating charms run out before morning…” he said with a sigh and Potter hesitated but he nodded and walked away. Granger poked her head out from the tent.
He had to wait. He didn’t know how much time had passed when the gargoyle finally turned and Harry appeared, looking pale and stunned. Draco got to his feet and it looked as though it took Harry a second to realise that Draco was standing there.
“Not these days. Where are we, anyway?” he asked and Potter looked around with a frown.
, something else… He just… died.” He sounded hollow as well and Draco nodded.
“Not really,” she said quietly and he smiled back. “So, tell me about Australia?" she asked and they began to catch up. After four years apart, they had a lot to talk about.
“Drop your wands,” she snapped, and no one moved. “Drop them or we’ll see exactly how filthy her blood is!” Draco let his and his mother’s wands fall to the floor with a clatter, though Weasley and Potter didn’t move. Bellatrix growled at them. “I said,
Draco’s heart stuttered a little bit. He had barely spoken to his professor since that night on the Astronomy Tower, when Snape had to do what Draco could not, and Snape seemed to go out of his way to avoid him now. But there were times like tonight, when their paths had to cross.
“The Mark,” he managed to gasp out before the pain hit again and this time he couldn’t stop the scream that left him. Potter was making soothing sounds and called for Granger, reaching for Draco’s arm, holding onto Draco’s wrist when the pain suddenly ebbed away, though it still felt hot and angry. Draco gasped again and fell back onto the floor, tears running down the sides of his face.
Hermione shrieked, bouncing a little on the balls of her feet. “Wha–? Tonks – Tonks has had the baby?” she asked in a breathy high-pitched voice and Lupin finally managed to free himself from his cloak, dropping it in a sodden heap on the ground by his feet. His smile could’ve lit up the whole room.
“The kitchens is quiet now, sir, if you wants to come in? We is done cleaning after breakfast.” The elf gestured to the painting next to Draco, which he now saw was cracked open on hidden hinges. Draco nodded and stood and the elf led him into the kitchen. The room was vast, lined with counters that were stacked high with glistening pots and pans. Five long tables were spaced around the room and Draco realised that they were in the exact same positions as the tables in the Great Hall up above. A large fireplace, big enough for Draco to stand in comfortably, roared on the opposite side of the room, tended by several house-elves.
“Changed password, at this hour?” he heard Slughorn mutter to himself as he walked through the common room. Draco could hear as Slughorn went from dormitory to dormitory, banging on the doors. “Wake up! Up, all of you! To the Great Hall, immediately!” he was shouting and Draco felt a thrill of fear go down his spine. What had happened?
He had settled himself in for another night, wards raised and fire doused, and had fallen into another fitful sleep when Potter came to him. The dream, which had been so empty only a moment prior, flooded with warmth that soothed Draco’s frayed emotions as Potter rounded a thatch of gorse in the recreated Alice Holt Forest where Draco had set up for the night.
“Harry, I’m sorry–” Hermione began talking again and Draco turned his gaze away from Dumbledore watching them to see her advance more. Potter’s fists were clenched at his sides, his knuckles white. “-but I think the real reason you’re so angry is that Dumbledore never told you any of this himself,” she said and Potter scowled at her.
With a strangled gasp, Draco woke up as he was forcibly dragged from his bed. A hand was closed around the back of his shirt and another pulled on his upper arm and he flailed in a panic, catching one of his assailants in the jaw.
“I don’t think anyone will be wearing it for a while,” Draco said and Potter nodded. He rubbed a hand over his face and then pushed himself up to sit, swinging his legs over the side of the bed so that they were nearly knee-to-knee.
“What are we going to do though?” Hermione hiccuped, clearing her throat and trying to resume her usually calm demeanor. “He’ll know, won’t he? You-Know-Who, will know we know about his Horcruxes,” she said and Ron sniffed, wiping at his face.
“I just wanted somewhere quiet to sit, really. Things are… Well, a lot of stuff is happening right now, Dobby. I needed some peace,” he said, ladling a dollop of honey into the teacup Mibby had provided. He poured the tea and added a splash of milk, before turning back to Dobby and cradling the mug of tea in his hands. Dobby was looking at him, obviously concerned. The elf began to gather up the firewood he had dropped as he spoke.
More talk. And then – “You are not a killer, Draco.”
“Tizzy, is it?” he asked and she squeaked and nodded. “Tizzy, I need you to go to Hogwarts and let Dobby know that Harry Potter is being held at Malfoy Manor and needs help. Can you do that now, please?” he asked and she bobbed a curtsey and took off running down the hallway. He stood and brushed down his trousers, before heading back to the drawing room.
“It’s dangerous stuff we're doing. I know it only seems like we’re camping in the woods, but – it could get dangerous. Dumbledore left me a mission and I need to complete it if we’re going to defeat Voldemort,” he said and Draco flinched. He caught Potter’s eyes and Potter was smiling a little. “Really? Even in dreams?” he asked. Draco rubbed his hands on his thighs, trying to sooth the goosebumps that just broke over his skin.
"I WILL KILL YOU, MALFOY!" he screamed into the dark abyss of the house, and somewhere behind him, he heard Begbie drop his hands into his face. So much for the element of surprise.
“She can barely lift a match, how in Merlin’s name is she going to pass over a bloody great sword?” Draco snarled and Granger gave him a quelling look. He dropped his head a little and shook it. “I don’t like this. This place stinks, it’s like no one’s lived here for months. And look–” He gestured at the bookcase next to the fireplace. “It’s untouched, there’s a whole layer of dust over it. Bathilda Bagshot is well known for her reading,” he said and Granger leaned in close, studying the untouched layer of dust covering the books. She paused and pulled a book out that was laid over the top of others, wiping off the dust on the cover.
“He made it out in one piece, but he’s on the run now, like us,” he explained. He stepped around Hermione to go back into the tent and she gave him a filthy look as he brushed past her, Potter following. “Anyway, it’s best to stick with You-Know-Who,” Weasley added and Draco turned in his seat.
His mother was telling him to run, and to run now. He would be dead if he returned to the Manor, and she was giving him permission to flee. He took a deep, shuddering breath and then pushed away from the wall and ran for the kitchens. He had to go, now!
“That’s what he’s after,” his quiet voice pierced more sharply through the tent than his shouting had and Hermione looked even more frightened than she had been. Even Weasley looked worried, his soup forgotten in front of him. Potter turned back to face them, his eyes still wild but his mood suddenly sombre. “You-Kn0w-Who’s after the Elder Wand,”
“I’m just surprised. I never thought you’d have one,” he said and Hermione sniffed, lifting her tea to blow across the surface lightly.
“Begging your pardon, Mr Malfoy,” Greyback said over the sounds of Bella grunting as she tried to break Father’s grip. “But it’s us that caught Potter, and it’s us that’ll be claiming the gold–”
“Is he up there?” he asked. The gargoyle peeked through one slitted eyelid which promptly closed again. “Answer me! Is Harry Potter up there?” he snapped at it. It huffed, as though inconvenienced.
"Hardly. For one thing, I'm the man who broke the Boy-Who-Lived's heart and supposedly abandoned him and our children. No, the
“Hey,” there was a murmur next to Draco and he jumped. Dean was next to him, holding the goblin, and he jerked his head towards the cottage in the distance. “Let’s go inside, okay?” he suggested and Draco nodded, pushing himself up to standing. He kept his eyes averted as he followed Dean inside, staggering on numb legs into the warm building.
"We managed to floo her late last night, McGonagall let us use her floo. She's devastated, obviously, but she said… she said she didn't see them at all on the train," she explained and Harry's heart dropped. Hermione met his gaze again. "I've told the Aurors. They don't think the boys ever made it to the train, Harry," she said, reaching for his hand where it was clenched around the files he held, his knuckles blanching white. "I'm so sorry," she murmured and Harry felt himself nod automatically. Of course she was sorry - for the last 21 hours, everyone had been “sorry'.
“I killed a woman. I killed the woman I loved. These chains are my penance and her refusal to forgive is my torture,” he finally said. Draco’s mouth went dry.
"Yes, but it was a possibility. And that's all this is, Malfoy," Ron argued back, and Malfoy glared at him, "a possibility,"
Here and there were names that he recognised. ‘
Mother had been right. ‘Lively’ was one word to describe the evening meal. Draco had been sat between his parents, more for his own protection than anything else, as the Death Eaters around the table elbowed each other and laughed uproariously, knocking over bottles of wine from the cellar and spilling the food that the elves had so carefully prepared over the table and even onto the floor.
Happy? What moment about his life had been happy? Was it the day he received his Mark, trying to stifle the cries and swallowing around the tears as his father held him knelt to the floor and the Dark Lord burned that mark into his arm? No – that was the opposite of happy.
No, not Witch Wood.
“We should go,” Weasley cut in and Potter and Hermione looked at him sharply. He was still knelt next to the wireless, and he gave them a timid smile. “We should go. If Hermione’s right, we ought to go see Lovegood,” he added and Potter gave him a dark look. Draco followed suit.
“Professor Carrow is joined by her brother who will be taking over my duties as the Defense Against the Dark Arts professor. I am sure you will all be most attentive in their classes,” Snape said with a hint of a threat to his voice. Amycus stood as well, head-and-shoulders above his sister, but like her, he received no applause. Snape cleared his throat. “As I am required to remain impartial as Headmaster, Professor Slughorn has the honour of returning to his position as Head of House for Slytherin as of this year,” he added and Slughorn gave a jolly wave from his seat. There was polite applause from the Slytherin table, tempered with some disappointed sighs. Slughorn was not nearly as lenient as Snape had been as a professor.
Next to him, Hermione lay gasping, tears streaming down her face and Weasley was on her other side, groaning in pain. Harry, however, was already on his feet, trying to snatch at Griphook who had leapt from his shoulders and was sprinting towards the crowd of goblins that was advancing on them, daggers drawn.
They made their way to the top of the house in silence, Malfoy occasionally pausing to look at the photographs on the walls or a trinket on a side-table, or comment about the decor of the house itself. On the second floor, he paused and smiled, gesturing to the framed picture of both the boys in their Kiddie Quidditch Team, aged about six-years-old, Albus sat confidently on his broom while Scorpius stood, awkward, next to him, clutching a teddy bear. In the photograph, his broom zipped out of his hand and went flying away, while a silent cry of outrage came rushing out of Scorpius' mouth. Harry paused to look at it.
They sat there for a while longer, watching the snow drift lazily down, and then Draco stood and got ready for the day. He was just brushing his teeth when Potter woke up, opening his eyes and looking over at Draco with a lazy smile. Draco tried not to choke on his toothpaste and disappeared back into the bathroom to finish. By the time he came out, Potter was out of bed and making himself a cup of tea in the kitchen.
“I would’ve laughed too,” he admitted and Ron gave him a small smile.
Instantly they were raised up into the air. Draco yelped and took hold of Harry’s waist, feeling himself slip back. Harry lurched forward and took hold of the dragon’s scales and spine, gripping onto them. Behind him, Hermione whimpered and grabbed onto the back of Draco’s cloak as the dragon pointed its nose up and flapped once more.
He shook his head to rid himself of the memories and looked around at the maze again and the scarce stones laid down on it. Except – one was out of place. A line across the pale stone showed where it had been laid previously and set down, but the line was above the ground level now, looking almost as though someone had lifted it.
"You go down too, your Dad has something for you as well," he said, thinking of the small parcel wrapped up and hidden in one of the kitchen cupboards.
“-wasn’t yours,” Harry was saying with a tone of victory in his voice. “Snape was Dumbledore’s, Dumbledore’s from the moment you started hunting down my mother. And you never realised it, because of the thing you can’t understand. You never saw Snape cast a Patronus, did you, Riddle?” There was no answer from Voldemort. “Snape’s Patronus was a doe,” Harry explained, his voice almost gentle. “The same as my mother’s, because he loved her for nearly all of his life, from the time when they were children. You should have realised – he asked you to spare her life, didn’t he?”
“You look very smart darling,” she told him in an undertone and if he had been twelve, he would’ve been strutting all the way to dinner, but now the idea of sticking out like a sore thumb plagued him. Too many times to count, he had been jeered at and called names at the dinner table, words that the Death Eaters wouldn’t have dared to say had he not fallen from grace.
Harry was confused. Their letters had been intimate, in a way. Harry rarely expressed his fears in written form (Merlin knows the Daily Prophet would have had a field day if they had somehow got hold of one of the letters), but Draco reciprocated and expressed his own thoughts in the same way. Harry was about to say something about it, when Draco spoke.
“I’m really not sure,” he lied as the train continued forward on their journey to Scotland. Hours passed and he barely spoke, preferring to watch the countryside slip by. The trolley witch came through and while the others bought cauldron cakes and pumpkin pasties, Draco couldn’t stomach the idea of eating. He felt a bit nauseous even smelling the food.
“Go,” Dumbledore said, stepping back and letting go of his shoulder. “Live. Be happy. Be young and in love, and then grow old and be happy. Never doubt that you and Harry have my blessing, for all that it’s worth.” Draco felt something tug at him from behind and he knew, deep down, that this would be the last visit from Albus Dumbledore. The Headmaster gave him one last smile and then Draco allowed himself to fall backwards off the Astronomy Tower, taking a final leap of faith.
“What do you think?” she asked, tapping a picture. It was an illustration of a rubbing taken from a tombstone, and underneath, neatly printed were the words. ‘
Draco slowly lowered himself next to the body. Snape’s eyes were still a little open, unseeing and blank and his mouth was slightly parted, his neck stained dark with blood. He looked… strange. Hollow.
Inside, Hermione was laid on a comfortable-looking sofa, her eyelids fluttering every now and then. Ron was kneeling beside her, smoothing her hair over her forehead. He looked up as Draco entered.
“Go on, say it,” he urged the table at large and Bill burst out laughing. Weasley had his head in his hands and Hermione was looking a bit smug, while Dean looked bemused and Luna looked like she was restraining herself from hugging them. Potter just gave him an indulgent smile and kissed him again.
!” Granger said, tears streaming down her face now. Her voice was high and sharp and Draco took an involuntary step back. She swiped a hand under her eyes furiously. “You come back after weeks –
“RON!” Granger screamed into the panicked crowd. “Ron, where are you?!” The sound of rapid popping broke through the screams of the crowd and masked and robed figures appeared on the dancefloor – Death Eaters. Draco pushed through the scene, trying to keep up with unknown Weasley and Granger as they waded through the crowd, though Granger started sounding more and more terrified as they continued. He couldn’t see Potter anywhere, but Granger was not calling for him. Draco realised as he moved, the dream seemed to shift and turn around the mysterious cousin, and with a frown, he tried to figure out who he might be.
“Dobby has no master!” the elf squealed, his voice carrying over Bellatrix’s cries of fury and the banging coming from the library door down the hallway. “Dobby is a free elf, and Dobby has come to save Harry Potter and his friends!” he shouted and Potter groaned next to Draco.
They landed with a heavy
The Dark Lord was dead, and Harry, with a wand in each hand, was alive, staring down at the body of the man who had killed him twice.
“You asked to see me, sir?” Draco asked, looking around the door to see if anything had been disturbed. Nothing was changed from when Draco had last visited, not even the mound of paperwork still piled onto the desk.
“I won’t,” he promised, and Weasley nodded once before leaning back in his chair. Fleur had cracked the door of the kitchen open but had seemingly been rebuffed and was back at the table, tapping her fingers in a drum on the surface. Eventually, Harry reappeared, looking a bit like a scolded child, and he sat down in his chair, listing a little bit. Draco tilted his head a little and the world spun a bit more than expected – the wine had gone to their heads, clearly.
“Took you long enough, Greyback!” he shouted over the clearing. The Snatchers who were holding him loosened their hold in shock and Draco shrugged them off, tugging his jumper straight. “I’ve been trying to get someone to help me for ages,” he said, his voice changing to cool and measured, the mask of the Heir of Malfoy slipped back on. He felt his features smooth into haughty neutrality and he could see Hermione gaping at him from where she was being propped up between two Snatchers. He gave her a blank look and turned back to Greyback, who was watching him with something like confusion.
There was the rumble of movement from many people and he stayed tucked behind the sofa even as he heard Slytherin house leave their dormitories. He waited until it had been quiet for a few minutes, and then peeked around the sofa – and froze.
Accompanied by the sound of metal clanging as he bounced between suits of armour. For Peeves, it was rather tuneful.
Draco checked one of the final compartments in the carriage and smiled as he opened the door – Harry was adjusting the straps of the overhead luggage storage, tightening a loosened knot.
“Maybe?” he suggested and the answer seemed to spur on his father, who looked at Weasley next. His lower face was crusted with dried blood and he stared defiantly into Lucius Malfoy’s face.
"I know," he said quietly, comfortingly, and Harry nodded, screwing his eyes shut. From behind them, there was the sound of a throat being cleared. Malfoy glanced back first and rolled his eyes, leaning away from Harry. "Speak of the Devil, and he shall appear," he muttered and Harry looked over - where Madam Hilda usually rested in her high-backed chair, Albus Dumbledore now sat, his fingers interlaced around his middle, his eyes twinkling behind his half-moon glasses.
“There’s no such thing, Harry!” she said, focused on this supposed unbeatable wand, and Potter shrugged one shoulder. “Even if it did exist, you’d then have to assume that the Resurrection Stone did as well, and that would be ridiculous! No magic can raise the dead,” she added and Potter gave her a look over his shoulder.
“I’m staying, Professor,” Draco heard and he craned his neck to see that Daphne Greengrass had stood. Another student, her sister, stood up as well, a little further way up the table.
“Severus… Severus… please…” and Draco closed his eyes, unable to watch again, unable to see that moment of hope fall backwards over the ramparts and disappear from this world.
“It’s not alone!” Harry shouted as he drew his head back inside, flattening himself against the remaining wall as curses flew past him and exploded into nothing. “Let’s move, now!” and they sprang into action. Hermione took point with Ron, and Harry stooped to lift Fred’s body by the armpits. Draco went to help but then Percy, realisation dawning, let go of the body and began to help. Draco brought up the rear instead, backing down the corridor as they all crouched low to avoid the curses flying overhead.
’ and opposite the pub, a little church with stained-glass windows that glowed jewel-bright.
“Very convincing,” he said and she gave him a reluctantly pleased smile and then turned to Weasley.
“Let me in! I need to see Dobby, now!” he shouted and the pear grumbled but begrudgingly turned into a handle. Draco grasped it firmly and pulled the door open.
“I’d take you to Madam Pomfrey, but they’ve summoned everyone to the Great Hall. These louts,” he kicked again at Goyle, who moaned. “Weren’t in the line, so I came back for them. Thought they might have slept through Slughorn waking everyone up. I’m sorry I wasn’t faster,” he added and Draco patted him on the shoulder.
“Harry!” he said, standing up and walking over to pull him into a hug. Much like he had with Hermione, Harry leaned into the hug. Ron wasn’t as good as Hermione when it came to writing to him, usually scribbling a few sentences at the ends of Hermione’s letters, but Harry read those few sentences repeatedly whenever he had received a letter from England. He could always hear Ron’s voice in the words, and while it made him homesick initially, it brought him relief as well. Ron stepped back from the hug and smiled at him. “How are you? Can we get you anything? Beer, wine, tea?” he asked and Hermione shouted from the kitchen.
grasp, and yet you and Dolohov failed me,” the Dark Lord said in a quiet tone, his voice cold, and it cut through Rowle’s screams. Draco tried to parse what Voldemort was saying – Potter had been there? Where? Draco hadn’t seen him at the wedding… Unless –
“We only have a few hours at best Hermione, we need to go. He’s seriously angry and he’s going to check on all the other Horcruxes too, starting with where he left the ring. He’s leaving Hogwarts until last because he thinks it’s the safest with Snape there, but we’re running out of time. We’ll Apparate to Hogsmeade under the cloak and–”
“Look at this!” she said, and he squinted and leaned closer. “Harry, that’s the mark in the book!” she whispered to them both and Potter bobbed his head but didn’t look quite convinced. Draco could understand why – the mark was so worn that it was barely legible, made even worse by the darkness around them.
“Harry… Potter…”
“Draco’s in the library, Mr Potter, if you want to follow me,” she said, glancing over her shoulder as she turned down a narrow passageway. Harry followed and she led him down a dark corridor to a door set in against the wood panelling, knocking on it once, pausing to listen for a reply. There was no answer that Harry could hear, but Mrs Malfoy opened the door anyway, poking her head in. “Draco, Mr Potter is here,” she said and then she stepped back and gestured for Harry to enter, before walking away.
my people. I am here
“Keep your voice down!” she begged, wading deeper into the churchyard, Potter rejoining the path. Draco waited for him and touched his shoulder again.
“I love him,” he said aloud and Dumbledore beamed at him. “He makes me happy. I think I make him happy too. I hope… I hope I can be good enough for him. I don’t know if I’ve done enough to be worthy,” he said quietly, the weight of his past sins weighing heavily on him. “Sir?” he asked, and Dumbledore made a small noise of acknowledgement. “Was it enough? Everything I did – was it enough?”
“I got this far, didn’t I? They thought I’d die in the attempt, but I’m here… and you’re in my power… I’m the one with the wand… you’re at my mercy…”
At the dungeon entrance, Draco murmured the password to the stretch of stone wall which creaked open to let them in. He saw Dougal and the herd of first-years rounding the corner just as Blaise and Pansy disappeared inside.
She straightened up and flounced away and Draco felt a tingle of fear go through his spine.
"AND PLEASE, NO MUD ON THE CARPETS," Delphinia shouted after them, causing a rise of sound from the portraits around her. They ignored it.
While Hagrid looked determined, confident, Potter was clearly unsure. He looked around the dark sky, as if searching for some hint of what was to come. Draco hovered close enough that if he was corporeal, Potter should have seen him, but Potter looked right through him. He was close enough now to hear Hagrid shout over the engine “We’re nearly there, Harry, we’ve nearly made it!” The motorbike began to descend, even as a strange expression crept over Potter’s face, like fear and realisation all in one.
“My cousin. I only met her today. She seemed… fun,” he said, and Blaise touched his shoulder gently. Draco sniffed and wiped his eyes. He looked over and Fleur was looking at him with tears in her eyes. He looked away. “What happened to you?” he asked and Blaise settled down on his heels next to him.
“Well, you both can’t sleep in here. Harry, take Draco to the tent, I’ll get his things,” Granger said and Potter began to tug on his wrist.
,” he said again and the red light hit Finnigan in the chest. He crumbled to his knees, screaming and there was another loud scuffle as Longbottom broke free from the Gryffindor girls.
“Where did you get this sword?” she hissed at him, holding it up by it’s hilt and swinging it slightly so that the silver of the blade caught the firelight. Greyback snarled at her and she stepped forward, forcing his wand out of his fist where he held it out to one side.
, and then removed in pieces, but how – why – no one would
“Did he?” Draco asked, looking around the room. There were posters on the walls, though he couldn’t make out the details. “I would’ve heard of him then, I think. Especially over the summer… Our houseguests aren’t very kind,” he added and Potter frowned.
The passageways wound through the castle, taking them further and further away from the kitchens. Dobby and Draco were silent as they walked until they reached a heavy wooden door.
“Mrs – Miss – Bagshot?” Potter asked in a tremulous voice, and he held out the photograph. “Who is this?” he asked. Bathilda’s eyes were trained only on Granger though, who knelt next to her, rearranging the logs in the grate. Potter tried again. “Miss Bagshot?” and he stepped forward with the picture held out, flames bursting into life in the grate behind Bathilda, framing her. She looked up as he spoke and something in Draco recoiled slightly.
“I’m going for a walk,” he announced suddenly when the smell of Pansy’s lunch got too much. She stepped out of her seat to let him go through and looked as though she was about to come with him. “I won’t be long, Pansy. Have your lunch,” he told her and though she looked a little miffed, she sat back down. Crabbe and Goyle eyed him from their seats but he knew that the pile of food in front of them was too much temptation for them to leave their seats.
That night, while the boys slept, Draco admitted that he had killed Lucius while in the mirror. He had said so quietly, his voice numb, and Harry had reached for him and held him tight while he sobbed. He hadn't cried for his father since.
“Yeah. There’s no Vernon Dudley on ‘ere, Greyback,” Scabior said and Draco felt cold creep up his spine. He tried to look around for Potter but he couldn’t turn far enough.
“Come on,” Hermione said, her voice muffled by the hands over his ears. He lowered his hands, and the Dark Lord ’s voice had gone. He reached up his hands and they pulled him to his feet. Hermione looped an arm around Ron’s as they followed the group leaving the Great Hall. Blaise joined him, hovering closeby as they wound their way out of the entrance hall and into the cold dawn light.
Together they made their way back to the cottage. Fleur gave a gasp of shock as Bill guided Potter’s body inside, but quickly rushed ahead to get the sofa clear. They settled Potter on it and Ron dropped heavily in the armchair nearest his head while Dean and Luna crowded into the sitting room, their faces stricken.
!” he cried out and the red jet of light burst from his wand, heading straight for Rowle who screamed and screamed. Draco held the wand steady though he could feel the rest of his body tremble, and he tried not to flinch as he felt the Dark Lord come up behind him.
“Where’s Harry?” he shouted desperately at Ron, who gave him a terrified look. They stopped at the sound of a shout nearby and turned to watch as Bellatrix began another volley of curses with Hermione, Ginny and Luna. A Killing Curse streaked past Ginny, the air around her hair flaring green for a second, missing her by inches.
“Yes sir, since 3 years ago,” Dobby said, proudly showing the hem of his Hogwarts tea towel that poked out under the bobbly jumper he was wearing. “How did Master Draco be finding the kitchens, sir?” Mibby came back over with a small pot of honey and she bobbed Draco a small curtsey and gave Dobby a strange look before rejoining the other elves around the kitchens.
’. Professor Flitwick, standing on a stacked house table, neatly flicked his wand at Dolohov who screamed and sank to the floor as his skin began to slough off, Ernie Macmillan with a bloody nose cheering next to Flitwick.
good for them, better than I had ever been. But I thought I was bad for them, I was convinced of it. After all, my parents loving me was bad for
But now - he was different. He no longer looked pale and pointed, like he had in his youth. He stood tall, his shoulders drawn back, his posture confident. The dark grey of his suit made his eyes seem brighter somehow, more blue than grey. His hair wasn’t slicked back like it had been at school, but was slightly tousled, like Malfoy had run a hand through the fine strands with little care for how they fell.
"Are you looking forward to going?" he asked him, and Hugo gave him a wide-eyed terrified look, but didn't respond. Hermione gave his shoulder an encouraging squeeze.
. So I will be – for him. For me. Because that’s what Harry Potter does – he makes you want to be so much better than you are,” he admitted to them, the first people to ever hear this confession, and the leaves in the yew tree overhead rustled in acknowledgement. He bowed his head, and then took a breath and blinked to clear away the tears, and then pulled the cloak back on over his head, turning to catch up to Granger and Potter. Behind him, the white marble shone in the snow and the petals of the roses and lilies rustling in the wind.
“I want to help him,” he finally said, saying it aloud for the first time, and Dobby gave him a sceptical look. Draco huffed in frustration. “I do! Ask me Dobby, you can tell if I’m lying. You’ve known me my whole life,” he said and Dobby looked over him once and then nodded.
“Who would you marry then?” she asked delicately, flicking a crumb off the table. He scowled at her.
The hall at All Souls was oak-panelled to a height before stretching to a high ceiling, portraits hanging between the two levels and even a few on the oak as well. Harry studied the portraits and the subjects, for the most part, kept very still (though Christopher Codrington kept blinking), though occasionally the sound of a clearing throat or a muffled sneeze came from a corner that was empty save for an oil painting. He and Hermione were seated towards the front of the hall, both changed into suits, though Hermione wore a skirt and Harry wore trousers that were possibly a touch too tight. One of the examination fellows, a skinny balding man with very white teeth that shone brighter against his dark skin, was explaining the next few days to the amassed group, made up of both Magical and Muggle applicants.
Draco wound his way through the castle to the seventh floor, and then to the gargoyle that guarded the entrance to the Headmaster’s Office. It was at rest, still and resolute, and did not even open its eyes when Draco approached.
On and on he went, replacing things just as he had found them before moving on to the next spot. He was fully absorbed in turning the lamp on the lake wall just right in order to engage the lock that swung open on the fireplace pillars, and he did not notice he was not alone until he heard a throat clear behind him.
Wasn’t he? Wasn’t he about to be? Wasn’t some final innocent part of him about to be killed off, irrevocably broken and marred, all for a cause that Draco never signed up to support? He stared at Dumbledore, who slid further down to the floor, weak.
“Why don’t you have a lie down, Ellie? The anti-venom will start working in a moment and you’ll feel better soon,” she murmured soothingly to the girl who nodded and collapsed onto her side, drawing her knees up to her chest. Pomfrey drew the curtains around her and bustled over to Draco.
“We should probably order. We need to be back in an hour or so,” Hermione said, glancing at the slim watch on her wrist. She reached for the menus in the centre of the table, and handed Harry and Draco one each. Harry took up the menu and shielded his face from Malfoy’s questioning gaze.
“I left Hogwarts today. Went on the run. It’s… I couldn’t stay there anymore. I didn’t want to. I want to help you,” he said and Potter made a small noise next to him. Draco looked over at him but Potter was frowning at something in the middle distance. Draco looked behind him but there was nothing.
Draco kicked off his shoes and clambered up onto his bed, lying down on top of the duvet. A wave of exhaustion swept over him and he fought it, rolling over to pick up his book which he had left on his night stand and opening it to the last page.
“I’m putting the Elder Wand,” Harry began again, glancing back up at the portrait of Dumbledore. The Headmaster was looking at him proudly. “Back where it came from. It can stay there. If I die a natural death like Ignotus, its power will be broken, won’t it? The previous master will never have been defeated. That’ll be the end of it.” Dumbledore’s portrait nodded and there was a private moment between him and Harry, an exchange of smiles that were so much deeper than they seemed.
“When my wand connected with You-Know-Who’s, it made my mum and dad appear…. And Cedric…” and his gaze became unfocused, like he was thinking of that moment. Draco had heard about it in whispers around the Manor, but he saw true pain in Potter’s eyes. He stepped a little closer, and Potter’s vision refocused and snapped back to him, giving him a small smile.
Warding the door with a whisper to the House, Draco sat in the armchair by the fireplace and waited for the shaking to subside. It took a few minutes but eventually his muscles went still and he could take deep, even breaths. He reached for the bell pull by the fireplace and gave it a small tug, and an elf appeared in his room with a
“Quite tragic,” Snape replied in the same measured tone, eyeing him with no expression. Draco caught his gaze and Snape raised an eyebrow, only fractionally. It was enough. Snape knew what his mother’s letter meant, and he wasn’t going to stop him. “I think, Draco, that you should return to your dormitory and collect your belongings, and then return here. I will arrange a Floo pass for you. Would” – Snape glanced at the complicated planetary dial that sat on his desk – “you be able to return in an hour? That should give you enough time, I think,” Snape said and Draco nodded, cold fear still coursing his veins.
“I know what the diadem looks like, and I know where it is,” Harry said, talking fast, beginning to jog. The others kept abreast of him, Draco still holding the ruined cup. “He hid it exactly where I hid my old Potions book, where everyone’s been hiding stuff for centuries. He thought he was the only one to find it. Come on!”
He was so pale, and still. His eyes were closed, and his head hung limply from his neck, tilted back so that they could all see his face. He looked… serene. At peace. It was awful.
"Draco?" she called, leaning forward on her garden swing, and Draco stepped forward, his eyes scanning around him as he walked towards her, wary.
The room fell quiet. Harry was in the middle of a crowd, his face turned back towards the door. The occupants, twenty or so students that Draco could see, were watching Draco like snakes about to strike. It reminded him starkly of his first night in the Slytherin common room, all those years ago. The older Slytherins watching the younger ones, studying them, trying to find their weaknesses. Slytherin was about survival in that first year.
The snowy lane curved to the left as they walked and the heart of the village appeared out of the snowy air. Strung all around with coloured lights was a war memorial in the middle of the square, a windblown Christmas tree half-leaning on it. There were several Muggle shops, a pub with warm inviting lights named ‘
“That’s quite noble work, Malfoy. Do you get much interest in it from other academics?” Hermione asked, and Malfoy turned his gaze to her, and they began to chat about Malfoy’s field of study, leaving Harry to wallow in his shame.
“It’s not yours Missus, it’s mine, I reckon I found it–” He was cut off from saying anything further by a bang and a flash of red light and he fell, Stunned, to the floor, the sword already in Bellatrix’s hand. There was a cry of outrage from the Snatchers around them and Draco could see Potter’s head swivelling every which way in an attempt to see what was happening. Scabior, stupidly, drew his own wand.
“Well, cheers!” he said, lifting his pint glass. Hermione smiled and tapped her glass to his. “Well done to us for getting invited to take the fellowship exams,” he continued, bringing the glass to his lips and taking a drink.
“Trying to prove Voldemort’s ideals then?” he snapped before he could help himself. The anxiety he had felt at the nightmare still lingered and made him snappish, it seemed. Hermione kicked him under the table, and while a flush rose on Malfoy’s cheeks, he maintained his composure.
“But, Harry-,” he started, but Harry started collecting his things, tucking them away into the backpack next to his chair.
“And how about you, Harry? Weren’t you seeing someone in Melbourne?” Hermione asked, taking a swig from the bottle held loosely in her hand. Harry felt his smile slip a little.
“It’ll be here soon. You should go,” he said, letting go of Draco’s arm and touching his shoulder, nudging him backwards until Draco went to lie flat and then fell through the dream, waking with a start.
Potter led Draco, Ron and Hermione out of the cottage and up to the mound where Dobby now lay. He paused there and looked out at the waves and then turned back to them, where they waited patiently. Hermione, still a little weak and with a bandage around her forearm, leaned heavily on a stone garden wall, squinting in the pale morning sunlight. Ron was hovering nearby and Draco held the ground between them and Potter, bridging an ever widening gap.
“It’s a boy!” Lupin crowed, righting himself, his shaking hands fumbling with the clasp of his cloak as Bill wrestled the door shut behind him. “We’ve named him Ted, after Dora’s father–”
“Morning Harry,” she said with a smile and he returned the greeting. “This came for you this morning. I think whoever wrote didn’t have your home address,” she handed over the parcel and Harry studied the writing on the brown paper, though he didn’t recognise it. He set it on the table with a frown.
“Yes, I dare, because Dumbledore’s last plan hasn’t backfired on me at all. It’s backfired on you, Riddle.” As he passed, Draco noticed Voldemort’s hand tremble where he held onto the Elder Wand. Harry continued to speak. “That wand still isn’t working properly for you, because you murdered the wrong person. Severus Snape was never the true master of the Elder Wand. He never defeated Dumbledore,” he explained and Draco felt the pieces start to slide into place in his mind.
"When I have children, I won't do that to them. There won't be anything more important to me than them, ever," he has said with conviction. Malfoy had looked at him, over the rim of his cup of tea, and maybe smiled a little.
“I’m going to get a drink. Hermione?” he asked, and she asked for a pint of coca-cola if they had any. Harry hesitated a second but turned an enquiring gaze on to Malfoy.
“Wonder if Burbage went on Sabbatical after the
“You’re joking, Perce!” shouted the twin, as the Death Eater he was fighting hit the ground as three Stunning Spells hit him. Thicknesse fell to the ground with a strangled cry and Draco winced as tiny spikes erupted from under his skin in his arm –
“What do you mean it’s danger– Potter, behind you!” but it was too late. A nightmare, unseen by both of them, had slithered up behind Potter and wrapped it’s rotting hands around his face. Potter shouted and flailed, and Draco lurched up to grab him and –
“I’ll go find him. Blaise, stay here,” Blaise opened his mouth to protest but Draco cut him off. “No, really. I won’t be long, he can’t have gone far,”
“Draco, move this scum outside,” Bellatrix said, flicking the sword in the direction of the unconscious Snatchers. “If you haven’t got the guts to finish them, then leave them in the courtyard for me,” she added with a sneer and Draco felt heat rise in his cheeks but did as he was told.
There were howls and cackles and screams, and Draco was buffeted by a strong wind that had been called down by someone, but it felt like a light breeze to him. He breathed and flexed his fingers and found that, strangely, he was not panicking. He was calm. Everything around him felt fuzzy, like he was trying to touch something underwater, intangible and fleeting.
“Help,” he wheezed, trying to push it off and then hands were on him, pulling the stone away, and then Hermione was pulling him to his feet, her face bloodied and tearstained. “What – Who–?” he asked, her expression instantly recognisable – grief. He prayed with all his might for the second it took her to tell him. ‘
“Shall we go for a drink?” Hermione asked, brushing down her skirt, and Harry and Draco nodded. The walk over to the
“-demort’s after the Elder Wand!”
Sniffling, Granger raised her wand again and began weaving it in midair. Draco recognised the spell as soon as vines began to blossom in the air, and he raised his own wand as well, joining his magic with hers. Around hers he wove more magic, until a beautiful wreath of Christmas roses and white lilies hung in midair. Potter caught it and settled it in the snow atop Lily and James Potter’s graves.
Next to him, Hermione knocked her shoulder to his. “I’m the brightest witch of our age, eh?” she asked him teasingly and Draco hid his smile beneath a curtain of hair, brightened further by the yelp of terror from Weasley in the tent behind them.
“It’s just Hermione,” he said and Draco nodded, though he didn’t feel much comforted by that. Hermione, shorter than both Harry and Draco, was now on a height with Draco, Bellatrix’s wild black hair streaming around her face in the early morning sea breeze. She came up to them and opened her hands up at her side, as if showing them something.
“No,” Weasley and Hermione said from the same direction and Potter spoke again.
“Look,” he whispered, and his voice was covered by the sound of Bathilda fumbling with some logs at the fireplace. Some of the photographs were moving. To Draco’s surprise, Potter reached out and snatched one up. He studied it, his eyebrows pinching together, and before Draco could see what the photo he was holding was of, Potter turned and spoke to Bathilda, who was bent over the fireplace grate, stacking the logs inside it inelegantly. Granger looked at her, despairing, before coming over to her and taking over, crouching down.
“And me,” Harry called from the centre of the group around him. His eyes were fierce in the warm light of the room and a few of the students around him looked confused but the tension seemed to ease somewhat.
“Did you get the cup?” Draco interrupted, not sure his sanity could take all this standing around, mooning over Ron. Ron juggled the fangs in his arms and wrestled something out of his jacket – the mangled remains of Hufflepuff’s cup.
“I’m with him,” he said simply and then he squeezed past the students at the end of the day. There was a wave of whispers and general excitement that was dying down, which picked up again as he passed. McGonagall was still speaking.
“What? This?” He shook his head. “This is nothing. Seamus is worse. You’ll see. Shall we get going then? Oh.” He turned to Aberforth. “Ab, there might be a couple more people on the way,” he said and Aberforth glowered at him.
He looked like a man who had just discovered the meaning of life. His expression lifted, his eyes wide, his cheeks flushed with this revelation. Draco almost hated the moment that Hermione spoke, breaking the silence and saying his name once, pityingly, as Potter dove for the knot of damp clothes on the floor and wrestled the Mokeskin pouch out of his sodden t-shirt.
“Narcissa,” said a low, slurring rumble behind them and Draco turned to watch his father amble into the room. Where once a proud Lucius Malfoy had walked this Manor, a shell of him stood in his place. His father’s hair was stringy and untied, his clothes askew and his eyes bloodshot and bleary. He blinked at them heavily, like his eyelids weighed too much.
“You’ll need to think of something happy,” Potter said, tapping his wand to his chin. They were two days away from their trip to Godric’s Hollow and Potter had decided that Draco should learn how to do the Patronus Charm, just in case.
” me and nearly killing me in the process,” Potter said with another laugh. “I set him free actually – hid a sock in the journal and your dad threw it at him. You should’ve seen his face,” Potter said with another laugh and Draco felt his jaw go a bit slack.
A few hours later, Draco sat in the same place Potter had been all night, on a cushion in the tent doorway. He was wearing every jumper Dobby had packed for him, and every pair of socks too, but the cold still bit at his nose and he shivered every now and then. The bluebell fire, as Hermione had called it, had been topped up and it crackled merrily as he cupped the jar in his hands.
“Were you sleeping, Draco?” the Dark Lord hissed above him and Draco pushed himself onto his knees, inclining his head. He hadn’t seen his parents in that brief look around the room.
"What are you doing to find my sons?" he asked, though his mouth felt like it was stuffed full of cotton. Thompson blinked at him stupidly for a minute, before pushing himself to standing, matching Harry's height, adjusting the cuffs of his shirt underneath his robe.
!” He shook Snape’s shoulders more violently and then someone had seized him around the middle and was pulling him away, and he yelled and kicked.
By the time they got back to the tent, the sun was setting. Draco felt drained, tired from using all that magic, and his lips were bruised from the kisses he and Potter had traded throughout the afternoon, an unspoken agreement passing between them. Draco had summoned the owl repeatedly and every time Potter got a little closer to it, tears in his eyes, though Draco thought they might have been happy ones after all.
“Plan?” he repeated. He swayed a little where he stood but Ron left him standing, did not prop him up. “Well, there’s something – Ron, Hermione, Draco and I – need to do and then we’ll get out of here.”
"Mr. P," another voice said from behind him, and Harry looked over his shoulder. Belinda was there - firm, kind, gentle Belinda, who reminded him of Mrs Weasley, who brought him endless cups of tea or coffee, and lunch when he forgot it, and shared the stories of her boys when they were teenagers so that Harry felt less alone than he really was. She reached out a hand and placed it on his forearm, and Harry let go of Thompson's robes, the other man staggered back into his desk, sheets of parchment spilling off onto the floor. "Let's go to your office, love. Have a cuppa, I've called Minister Granger and Mr Weasley on the floo, they'll be over any minute,"
he thought repeatedly but there were no twitching curtains from this Muggle neighbourhood tonight.
“I’m trying, okay?” he snapped and Potter held up his hands in deference. Draco turned back to the empty space of the clearing and tried once more, scanning his memories for a brief flicker of happiness.
“Is all quite well?” Snape asked him in a carefully neutral voice. Draco cleared his throat and struggled to find what to say.
you. And I am so – so sorry,” he said, his voice beginning to tremble. Ron had deflated and Hermione wrapped an arm around him. Draco turned to Percy, who was rocking Fred’s body, sobbing. “There’s nothing you can do for him. We need to go,” he said gently and Percy turned tear-filled eyes to him.
Draco had to appreciate the irony in riding his namesake to freedom. They had burst out of London and the dragon had flown higher and higher until the streets and cars were nothing but distant toys on the ground. Higher it flew still, taking them into wisps of cool cloud that soothed Draco’s blistered and raw skin. His hands were still tight on Harry’s hips, surely leaving bruises, but he still held on, terrified of losing his grip.
“Who’s Kingsley?” he asked and while Weasley gave him a disgusted look, Potter stepped closer and answered.
The Astronomy Tower again. The Dark Mark bright in the sky over Hogwarts, drowning out the stars. The lake was black and still in the distance, the breeze cool. He clenched his eyes shut and tried to wake up. Lost in the dreamspace, Draco tried to break free, tried to return to Harry, in whose arms he had fallen asleep. He hadn’t had this dream in so long. He did not want to witness it again.
"They're not," he said into the room and they all turned to look at him. Malfoy had blanched.
“He might’ve made it all up!” Potter snapped, slipping inside the tent. Draco followed, Weasley and Hermione bringing up the rear. “He might’ve just been telling us stories to bide his time while the Death Eaters came!”
Luna was dreamily explaining about a tiara that her father had been making, and Draco was only half-listening, instead focused on hooking his ankle around Potter’s under the table, when there was a bang on the door. All heads snapped in that direction, Bill the first to his feet at the table, followed by Potter, Weasley, Hermione and Draco, all their wands drawn. Fleur had emerged from the kitchen looking frightened and she stood behind Bill, her hand braced against the wall.
Spells zipped across the night sky over a suburban scene of identical houses, sending up red and blue and green and gold sparks. It looked like fireworks and he begged, in his mind, for the obviously Muggle neighbours to stay inside.
“You should have seen your face!” he howled, waving at Draco, who looked dumbstruck. Ron doubled over and nearly spilled his tea had Hermione not caught it with a clever flick of her wand first. “Oh, that’ll keep me amused for days,” Ron wheezed, straightening up, and Harry shot Draco a reassuring look. It was as close to a blessing as they were likely to ever get.
“Sorry. I had a nightmare. Thought I’d come down here and do a bit of reading to calm down,” he said in a quiet tone, lifting the book for Ron to see. Ron blinked at him and then sighed, turning to shut the door and then taking a seat next to Harry, who watched him in bemusement.
"Just up ahead," Draco called back to them, and a wave of sound went through the Aurors. They seemed to fall into some sort of line formation either side of Harry, like a ripple behind him. They reached the top of the stairs and Draco led them right, through a narrow wooden-panelled hallway. The corridor was draped in cobwebs, but there were tracks on the floor - something had been dragged through here.
“Your authority!” Bellatrix sneered, twisting her arm in an attempt to free it from Father’s grip. “You lost your authority when you lost your wand, Lucius! How dare you! Take your hands off me!” she shrieked, twisting harder and Draco would have laughed if he hadn’t been so terrified, to watch his father and Aunt wrestle in the drawing room, Bellatrix trying to shake Father off.
helped you escape?” he spluttered and Draco nodded, frowning a little.
and you think it’s all going to be all right if you just say sorry?”
“Are they here? Mama, do you see them?” the little girl with bright red hair asked her mother, holding tightly onto her father’s hand and bouncing on the tips of her toes to get a better look.

Harry left and retreated back to his own room. And if both he and Malfoy lain awake for hours that night, until they both had been dragged into nightmares by exhaustion alone, neither of them mentioned it in the morning.
“HAGGER!” shouted the Gamekeeper's giant brother, and a volley of arrows flew overhead, scattering the Death Eaters who shouted with surprise. Voldemort’s giants roared at Grawp and ran at him, making the earth tremble below their feet as centaurs crested the hill, their arrows nocked and aimed, all of them shouting a warcry, their hooves pounding the ruined lawn as they charged.
“Meanwhile,” Lee continued as Hermione let out a long hiss of air, “in Gaddley, a Muggle family of five has been found dead in their home. Muggle authorities are attributing the deaths to a gas leak, but members of the Order of the Phoenix inform me that it was indeed the Killing Curse – more evidence, as if it were needed, of the fact that Muggle slaughter is becoming little more than a recreational sport under the new regime.”
“Potter!” Draco shouted into the woods. Frost bit at his nose and ears and the leaves were crunchy under his boots as he trudged further in the forest. The trees didn’t answer his call and he turned in a circle slowly, trying to find that tell-tale glimmer of wards, but none showed in the dimming light. Annoyance flushed through him and he shucked his backpack, letting it fall to the ground behind him. “For Merlin’s Sake, Potter, I know you’re in this godforsaken forest with Granger, let me in!” he shouted into the silence.
“Ok – the spell is
Maybe he had been wrong, for all these years. He thought back and remembered the way Malfoy had been then - pale and drawn, quiet and still. He had muttered to himself a lot, but gave Harry a mask of forced cheerfulness. He had barely slept, tossing and turning for most of the night, keeping Harry awake too.
“You made it?” Draco asked, his voice sounding distant even to his own ears. Blaise nodded and heaved himself up to stand, coming over to Draco and looking down at the bodies before him as Draco turned back to look at them.
“You-Kn0w-Who’s Mother was the last surviving Gaunt,” she said and she tapped at the bottom of the tree. ‘
It was neatly and securely wrapped in plain brown paper, and Harry’s name and the University address was written in neat cursive on the front. Harry ran his thumb across the folds of brown paper, unwrapping a clearly old but well maintained book. His heart jumped a bit.
Belinda sat him down on the plush sofa in the corner of his office and then bustled off to her atrium outside his office, to make him a cup of tea. Harry sat with his head in his hands, panic occasionally seizing his body and thrumming through him. He felt like he was going mad.
Potter had gone to sleep and if Draco looked behind himself into the tent, he could see the lump that was Potter bundled under bedclothes on the bottom bunk.
“We thought you might ‘ave broken in,” Crabbe said in a quiet, mean voice. He and Goyle stood in the middle of the common room, dressed in black. Crabbe’s fists were clenched and Draco tried to swallow around the knot that had formed in his throat.
“I left Hogwarts,” he said, his tongue sticking to the roof of his mouth. “They were – they made us torture students in Defence Against the Dark Arts. Finnigan was one of them, I’m sorry Thomas,” he said and Dean’s jaw tightened but he only nodded. “I went to tell Snape, but he already had a letter from my Mother. It was in code, so no one would realise, but she told me to run, that the Dark Lord wanted me dead. So I left. Dobby, actually – he helped me escape,” he added, tears pricking at his eyes again. He blinked rapidly and coughed.
"Yes. Albus keeps his in his room, but Scorpius has to have Aloysius with him all the time," he said and Malfoy barked a laugh.

“You’re going, aren’t you?” he asked quietly into the silence of the corridor. Harry nodded, flexing his hands at his sides.
“A doe. She appeared out of the woods and led me to this pool. I could see the sword of Gryffindor at the bottom of it,” and then Weasley, with a jump of remembrance, withdrew something shoved down the side of his backpack – the Sword of Gryffindor. Draco and Hermione gaped at it and Weasley looked at Hermione gingerly, like hoping it would be met with her approval. Hermione, awestruck, forgot she was angry and her limbs loosened a bit as she leaned forward in her chair.
“He’s just over–” but his voice died in his throat. He wasn’t there. Harry had been standing in the Great Hall doorway and Draco expected him to go over to the Weasleys but he hadn’t – he was gone. He looked around frantically. Hermione glanced over at him, her face crumpling in grief when she saw Lupin and Nymphadora.
“Narcissa isn’t here, Draco,” the Dark Lord said with a chuckle and Draco’s heart dropped. He had hoped maybe one of them was in a darkened corner of the room, but without them near… “Stand up, boy,” the Dark Lord snapped and Draco clambered shakily to his feet. “Yaxley, his wand,” and from behind Draco, Yaxley forced the slim length of wood into his shaking hand. “You may go, Yaxley. Go back to the Weasley house, search for the blood traitors,” the Dark Lord commanded him and the door shut behind Draco with a final-sounding
