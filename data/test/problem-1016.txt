As it turns out, he arrives halfway through the afternoon, just as Horace is stuffing himself through the French windows with his bag of books. The children are already descending on him, wrapping little fingers around the edges of his jacket and bearing him over to his fireside chair. Luna watches for a moment from the middle of the corridor, and then turns and goes to meet Harry.
As he watches, Ida sweeps the spell from one end of the bus to the other, dissolving the smoke in an instant. She puts her wand away and gazes up at him.
“You are completely welcome here,” Draco says. “This man does not represent us and he certainly doesn’t pay my wages.”
“Yes,” Draco says quickly. He smiles. “I’m going to have to leave my coat, unfortunately. We can Apparate from here.”
In the chaos that follows, Harry stays perfectly still. Cool fingers wrap around his wrist and he breathes, finding a calm in the storm and hanging onto it.
“Doesn’t she have protective spells on her till?” Charlie asks, allowing Kingsley to plant both paws on his knees. “The last time I was in Diagon Alley everyone had those big old metal ones that only open with a spell.”
“My mother and I used to pick herbs from the Manor grounds when I was little,” Draco says. “It really is as simple as that. I like good food and I love my mother.”
Flustered, he tries thinking of something else, but his mind just helpfully provides an image of the third deck and the first rays of the sun on Draco’s back as he writhes sleepily amid his layers of white bedclothes.
The sudden coldness makes him click in alarm, but when he turns in circles in a futile attempt to see the problem, the sticky ice cream just clings to his shell, turning gloopy in the heat and making the cone stand up like a single pointed horn. Stanley tacks at Draco’s shoes, seeming to request help, but when he tries to remove the new accessory the beetle dashes away, trailing melted strawberry goo in his wake.
Harry smiles, realising that, just like always, Hermione is right. He has a whole list of things he can do today, and none of them involve sitting with Draco in a dark room. Which is good. Definitely. It’s good, because his life is balanced and it’s calm and he likes it. He opens his eyes.
Draco is an idiot of the highest order for misleading those ladies, but when Harry really allows himself to think about it, he knows there was no malice or even self interest in those actions. Stubbornness, certainly, and an bullish independence that borders on self-destruction, but Harry knows that if he prises himself off the floor and looks in the mirror, those same ridiculous qualities will look right back.
While the Prophet seems to have lost interest in him and has refocused on Harry’s unusual behaviour, Witch Weekly has picked up the baton and opted to run ‘eligible bachelor’ style articles on Draco two weeks running.
“Well, I can’t help it,” Corrie says, dark eyes appealing. “And how’m I supposed to know if this is an Ace of Diamonds or an Ace of Hearts?”
“Please tell me that you—Harry Potter—are not giving me lessons on keeping a straight face,” says another, and Luna pulls in a sharp breath.
She takes a deep breath and tries not to feel overwhelmed. The cobbled street is packed with jostling people, each bringing their voice and their perfume and their excitable glimmer to the mix and threatening Luna with sensory overload. She blinks through her colour-hazed vision and gently guides Serafina, Caroline, Benny and Otis through the maze of bodies towards the Weasleys Wizard Wheezes stall where she knows she will find Ginny, George and Verity. In the distance, she spies a bunch of bright orange balloons flying above a similarly bright orange stall, and she relaxes, knowing that she is moving in the right direction.
Molly beams and then instantly shrugs off the praise. “Well, I’ve had a lot of time to get them right. It’s nice to have something to do.”
“No,” Harry gasps, hips jerking as Draco flicks his tongue over the sensitised flesh and begins to stroke him slowly.
“I suppose we shouldn’t ask about the tinsel… or the soot… or the cotton balls and tiddlywinks on his feet,” someone says, and when Stanley looks, it’s the one with the messy hair and the glasses, wearing a silly jumper and smiling to see him home. The boy and girl wave goodbye, leaving the three of them alone.
When they begin to shiver again, Draco builds a fire and they curl up in the old green armchairs, wrapped in rough towels and gripping mugs of tea. Conversation is sparse but comfortable, and when Draco rises, puts on his clean grey trousers and starts wandering around the cabin, Harry just watches him in contented silence. His pale skin glows in the firelight, hair damp and drying in waves, and he moves around the little wooden room, barefoot and humming to himself, as though he has momentarily misplaced his sharp edges. He finds a stash of candles in one of the drawers and lights them on every surface, filling the cabin with soft, flickering light and looking so perfectly at home that Harry is flooded with licking warmth and the knowledge that whatever happens when they leave here, something has shifted inside him that can never be undone.
“We did,” Harry says firmly, pulling back and resting his hands on Draco’s hips. “This is Luna’s night.”
Mr Borteg nods, watching with curiosity as Harry dashes across the cobbles in pursuit of Draco, who is walking briskly back to Sage.
Luna looks. The two men are apparently taking a refreshment break and are both leaning against the side of the house. One figure long and thin, the other short and squat, they are both holding plates of food and chattering away like old friends. Her father is clearly telling one of his stories—he always stands like that when he’s spinning a yarn—and Horace is nodding, interrupting every now and then and gesticulating with cocktail sausages and miniature gherkins.
He supposes he’s had a good run. Thirty years without ever losing his mind over another person... it’s not bad. Pansy has always said that it would be Potter, and he really, really hates it when Pansy is right.
“I almost forgot… you asked for something ugly and covered in glitter. We had a really good look around and found you this.”
“Doesn’t her son have lunch with her?” Harry asks, impressed and entertained by the way his new friends seem to know each other’s lives inside out.
“Can’t be sure on that, Draco, some little bugger’s had the clock from my desk,” comes the dry response, and Draco turns.
“It’s pronounced ‘Rafe’,” Ron and Harry say as one and then grin at each other, before Harry hurries to sober his expression. “Yes, well, I was very upset about it.”
“They’re all for you,” Harry says nonchalantly, slipping his finger under the lid. “It is, of course, a box of spiders, but…”
Harry laughs, but Ida fixes the back of Draco’s head with stern little eyes. “You behave yourself,” she reproves. “We must save the bristle beetle. They’re very important. My garden is full of them,” she says proudly. “It’s mating season, you know.”
“These are deities of the Yoruba religion,” the woman says. “In Nigeria, we may see them in human form but here, I have worked with many practitioners to capture the
“That’s funny, I don’t remember ever seeing you before,” Natalie says, coming out from behind the painting stall to stand beside Harry.
“Don’t worry about them, Mr Barleycorn,” the driver says, still bathed in shadow as he looks over his shoulder at the old man. “Everything’s fine. You go back to bed and I’ll put up a Silencing Charm.”
Harry looks around enviously at the other plates, admiring Ron’s perfectly cooked roast beef, Narcissa’s seared salmon and Hermione’s game pie with its golden pastry and tiny ceramic bird that channels herb-scented steam into the warm air. As always, he wants what everyone else is having, but he reminds himself that he can come back to Sage any time he likes and sample the menu until he has tried absolutely everything. Besides, his belly pork looks wonderful, and when he tries it, along with a spot of apple sauce and a smear of buttery mashed potatoes, he wants to groan out loud.
In the shocked silence that follows, Draco nudges Needle over to Mr Jennings’ table and the swan hisses crossly, stretching out his neck and folding his wings into a defensive crown.
“I don’t know,” Harry whispers back, “but you really needn’t bother. I’m happy coming to the wedding on my own and I’m sure you and Hermione both have better things to do.”
“Mr Borteg. Apparently it’s excellent for lifting whisky stains from the pages of books,” he says. “You’ll need to hang that up to dry, Rosie, it’s too delicate for a drying charm. Give it a couple of hours and you’ll be able to work on it again.”
“Quite right,” Eilish says. “Draco is your friend. He rescued you. What have those two ever done for you?”
“Somewhere for the biddies to go every week while you have a break,” Harry explains, suddenly self-conscious. “A way for you to have time off from the bus. You know, time for a life.”
They walk through the dining room in silence, past the kitchen, through the corridor and out into the icy courtyard. Releasing Draco’s hand, Harry turns away from him, turns back, sighs, and decides to just leap. It’s not as though he hasn’t already stood in this exact spot and made a fool of himself; he can do it again.
“I didn’t take anything from your shop,” Mr Jennings snaps and then scrambles to his feet. “I didn’t take
“Ah, yes. Mr Weasley gave it to me,” he says, inspecting the bracelet. “He insisted that everyone who assisted him with tidying his shop must have one. Every now and then, it lights up and tells me to ‘take a giggle break’.”
“It is, it’s really nice,” Harry agrees, and though he’s not lying—the whole thing is hot and soft and fragrant with bursts of fruit and sugar, and the sauce is a revelation—he has no idea how they are going to finish it, and if she continues to stand there, he thinks they are going to have to.
“Right,” Kettleworth says, flinching when Needle stretches up to his full height and flaps his wings.
“Well, that’s a nice feature,” Harry mumbles, remembering his previous trips and feeling slightly sick. He wonders if the beds upstairs are also now stuck to the floor, or if indeed they are still there at all.
Draco bites his lip. “Does it matter? I bought them and I used them. My customers said they were very nice.”
Harry’s stomach performs a nervous little flip. “What did he want?” he asks, instinctively looking out into the dark street as though Draco will be standing there, rather than stalking about in his fancy restaurant on the other side of the cobbles.
“I know. I suppose that all we can do is be on our guard. If we could just find what connects everyone, we might be able to get somewhere,” Draco says, pausing when he spots a building covered in a curtain of icicle-like dangling lights.
“Merry Christmas, Hermione,” he mumbles. “Let me know if you need anything. I’m not going to Eritrea.”
Back out in the street, Harry and Draco stare at each other. Needle, apparently cross at not being allowed to eat any of Felicity’s plants, hisses to himself and patters around their feet.
George glances at her, one eyebrow raised, but any questions he might have had are firmly cut off by his mother.
“Perhaps we should take my mother with us to question everyone,” Draco says with a wry smile. “That might give us a bit of direction.”
“You’re not going to set the bus on fire?” Harry says, taken by surprise when Draco kisses him and then immediately starts the engine.
Draco fights a smile, feeling strangely exhilarated as they walk along Diagon Alley, side by side with shoulders brushing. They do not exchange a word about their destination; they don’t need to.
“Harry,” she says at last, “I’m not going to tell you what to do. No one can tell you how to feel… but I do think you’ll regret it if you let him go like this.”
Harry takes one when offered and sucks it slowly, carrying the crate of Christmas decorations outside and setting it down in the snow. He draws his wand and tacks sprigs of holly and mistletoe along the lintels, bobbing along to the rousing brass band music that drifts up the street from the festival area. The white chocolate, soft mint and liquid caramel of the crackleball melts on his tongue as he works, sending a feeling of such warm delight out to his fingertips that he almost doesn’t mind when he picks up the lights and finds that they have twisted themselves into a tight snarl. Humming along with the music, he starts to unpick the tangled mess with cold-numbed fingers.
Ron opens his mouth to speak but falls silent as Molly bursts into the kitchen, soaked to the skin and struggling with a large basket.
“Well, now I’m intrigued,” Harry laughs, and when Draco holds out the squashy package, he takes it and tears away the wrapping paper.
“I’m learning to be patient,” he says, forcing himself to step around Draco and walk to the front of the bus. As the doors hiss open, he pauses. “I think you might be worth it.”
Caroline stares at him as a smile spreads over her face. “Yeah! Oh, that’s brilliant. I can’t wait to tell Lori, she’ll be… I mean… sorry about the fire.”
“Tell me, Potter, why the fuck can’t you leave me alone? Whatever I need to do is none of your goddamn business!”
They spend most of the morning exchanging ideas and theories about the Death Eater’s plan and when it was time for lunch Weasley was smart to decide to leave them alone.
“At the moment? Nothing. They won’t find anything useful… but then comes the unfortunate part,” she looked at Ron who was slumped in the armchair. “They will try to kill you. For real this time.”
The Slytherin looked at that kicked puppy expression on Harry’s face and couldn’t help but smile. There were so many things about this Savior that were extremely childish, but endearing. Draco knew Potter didn’t have much of a childhood, living with that muggle excuse of a family, so he was relieved to see that immature side to him.
Draco was blissfully high. He stretched out his arms, feeling the wind rippling on the thin fabric of his standard-issue cotton long-sleeve shirt. His vision was a bit blurry from the drugs but he was still lucid enough to enjoy this sunset. He didn’t have the slightest idea what he had taken or how much of it for that matter, but somehow he wanted more. Needed more. The abyss before him did not look frightening, it was inviting. The sound of the ocean was beckoning him, lulling his sense of self-preservation and whispering a false promise that as soon as he stepped forward everything would be over… His pain, his complete lack of control, his nightmarish past, and even more sinister future would all disappear beneath the water surface.
“By not acting like a lunatic?” Hermione suggests, but she accepts their offer of assistance and before long, they are all settled around the table with bowls of piping hot soup.
“The toastie was nice… I think,” Harry says, frowning. “Your mother, she’s… she looked at me like she could see my insides. It was a bit unsettling.”
“You should be,” Hannah tells him. “I’ve seen her take down bigger men than you. One of them looked like a bodybuilder.”
“Did I miss it?” Mr Pike calls, heavy boots crashing onto the cobbles as he struggles to reach the front.
“Brunch is really nice,” Hermione says, too caught up in counting out knives and forks to notice Molly’s expression. “You get all sorts of fruit and bread and meat and sometimes you get a glass of something bubbly at the end.”
“He’s got ideas already,” Tom says, and while Harry doesn’t doubt his wisdom, he suspects that the faster the swan is back where it belongs, the better.
“Let’s just go,” Harry says, and, with a deep, steadying breath, he follows Draco back into the restaurant.
Draco smiles but says nothing. Harry closes his eyes and continues listening to the rain pinging into the bucket next to his head. He is pretty certain that this is going to be his side of the bed, but he doesn’t really mind.
“Don’t be sorry, Harry,” she says, eyes crinkling as she smiles. “You’ve just offered me the most wonderful opportunity. Where do I sign?”
“I don’t know,” she says, leaning back in her chair and crossing one leg over the other. She shrugs, letting one of her vicious-looking shoes dangle from her toes. “You look a bit pathetic this morning.”
Two elderly ladies regard him with interest from their armchairs and Harry, feeling rather self conscious, glances around at the interior of the bus. In daylight, the violet walls and ceiling seem even more vivid and the endless pictures of grey cats now make a little more sense. Juno herself now leaps onto the luggage rack and curls up on a pile of brightly-coloured raincoats.
Harry jogs over to join him, following his eyes to find a large, black and white creature wandering up the slope towards them. The bell around its neck jangles with each step, and its long, upright ears twitch as it regards them for a moment with dark, liquid eyes.
“You eat it,” Harry mumbles, unwrapping what looks and smells like a cheese toastie but is rather more impressive. It has been toasted until golden and sliced into two equal triangles, just as it should be, but the bread is chunkier than usual, crusts dusted with flour, and when he bites into it, the perfectly melted cheese has a nutty flavour and a flicker of warmth that is out of place in the most wonderful way.
“That’s for you to find out, you’re stuck with me now,” Draco says, picking out a pair of skates and sitting down on the bench to put them on.
“No, you need to extend the table this way,” Hermione calls, just as a loud creak-scrape echoes around the bus. “Otherwise, Danica’s going to be squashed in that corner.”
“He’s tried,” Harry says, imagining a hundred Timothys all scurrying and apologising at once. At least there would be a lot of shiny buttons. “He’s spoken to the head of MLE but everyone’s just overstretched. The Auror department has a full caseload and everyone else is just flat out. Apparently this is particularly crimey time of year.”
,” he murmurs, filling the place with bright light and finding himself staring straight at Florean, who has chosen the same moment to cast.
“Very busy, Jean, very busy,” he insists, ducking out of Eeylops with her sack before she forces him into a chair by the fire and he loses his momentum completely.
The younger children are full of enthusiasm but need frequent reminders to concentrate while some of the older ones are a little bit self-conscious and require a word or two of encouragement, but Luna keeps her eye on all of them, monitoring their glowing colours for signs of discomfort. Meanwhile, Draco stands in the corner, flickering, with his arms crossed and his face blank.
“That little shop next to the ice cream parlour in Diagon Alley,” Mary Ann says, pressing a button and showing Luna and Harry a tiny little day planner. “She says they’ve all sorts of Muggle things… adapted, you know. I’ve got to put a spell up its bottom every night to keep it working.”
The afternoon’s heavy rain means that customers are thin on the ground and Draco has plenty of time to hang around (not on the bags of sawdust) and talk to Harry. It doesn’t escape his notice that something about the stock take makes Harry irritable. His face is arranged in a perpetual frown, he scratches at his forehead with his quill, several times knocking his glasses askew and twice displacing them completely, displaying impressive reflexes in order to catch them before they hit the ground. His mood isn’t helped by the fact that one of the few customers he has seems more interested in flirting outrageously with Harry rather than actually buying anything.
By the time he has decided to stop staring at the back of his head and say something, Draco has turned, and in a fraction of a second leapt to his feet, wand drawn and eyes narrowed. Instinctively, Harry reaches for his wand, too, but his stomach turns at the idea of throwing a hex. He sighs and drops his arm to his side, relieved when the spark of confrontation seems to drain from Draco, and he turns away and drops back onto the pebbles without a word. Harry has words—plenty of them, but they seem to jam in his throat. With the sobering knowledge that he hasn’t the heart to even verbally attack Draco after everything that has happened, he sighs and sits at the water’s edge, keeping a careful distance. He can feel their silence, like a fine mesh pulled taut, and he can also feel Draco staring at the side of his head.
It’s fuzzy at close range and without his glasses, but this pillow is all wrong. The fabric is crisper and lighter than his trusty brushed cotton winter set, and more to the point, magpies don’t usually talk about chocolate as much as this one is doing now. Disoriented, Harry tries to roll over but something heavy is occupying the small of his back. He shivers, suddenly aware that he is barely covered by the bedclothes, and the thing on his back lets out a small, irritated hiss.
“Ooo,” Ron says, looking delighted to have a distraction from his dinner. “Terry’s older brother? He’s a good-looking bloke, Harry.”
“I have to keep track, how else can I even attempt to deal with the ridiculous questions people are always sending in?” Draco snaps, ducking under the desk and grabbing a pile of papers. “Fucking sports section,” he mutters and drops them again.
“I’ll see you,” he sighs, dropping several coins into the centre and making his sleeve ride up his forearm.
Draco grins back. Pansy groans. “Is this what you’re going to be like now? I’m not sure I can take it.”
Harry doesn’t even have to tell her to stay on the pavement and watch where she’s going. She’s got it, and he’s proud enough to burst. Smiling to himself, he walks beside Draco, carrying the spider lunchbox and a feeling of peace that has been missing for some time.
Draco attempts to ignore the warm flutter in his stomach set off by the careless display and instead presses his palm to the side of Harry’s face, relishing the way he closes his eyes and leans into the touch.
“You mustn’t open it until tomorrow,” Ida says, lingering on the steps and looking anxiously between Harry and Draco. “It’s for both of you. But you mustn’t open it yet.”
Harry directs him into a chair and pours the coffee, releasing the rich scent into the air and watching Draco’s eyes close gratefully.
“Of course,” Harry says, taking them back and heading into the kitchen, which is, as always, pin-neat and welcoming. Shan and Esmee’s flat is beautiful, full of vibrant colours and countless mementos of their lives together. It also smells tantalisingly of cooking, reminding Harry that he has forgotten to have lunch. “Here you are,” he says, emerging with the sunflowers in a crackle-glazed vase and placing them on the coffee table. “I’m sorry you feel like an old lady, but at least you don’t look like one.”
“Please don’t make me do this,” he pleads, and the flicker of a hopeful smile around the corners of his mouth almost causes her to waver, but then she remembers the plan, and she shakes her head.
“I know you think you’re protecting me, but you need to stop,” he says as calmly as he can. “Draco isn’t using me. He’s not who he was. None of us are, you know that. Please just... let it be.”
“I don’t know what the kids are allowed to eat but I bet the staff won’t mind a bit of chocolate,” she says, tucking the tin under her arm as they pass through the Leaky Cauldron and into Muggle London.
“So, where have you been?” he asks when she returns, mostly for the benefit of the listeners. “The Viper Pit? The Million Galleon Club? Madam Exclusive’s Exclusive Retreat for the Exclusive?”
Scanning the room once more, her eyes catch on something that isn’t quite right, and she heads over to sit cross-legged on the floor next to a girl clutching a letter and scowling. The light around her is a pale, unsettling shade of her usual vibrant orange.
Tacking softly, he approaches the door and taps the wood with his antennae. It’s quite solid, but he can hear the voices he knows so well from the other side. He decides to wait, tucking his little feet underneath himself and wedging himself up against the skirting board so that he won’t be accidentally stood on. When he hears the whistle of the kettle, though, he knows that the door won’t be opening any time soon.
Harry stares at him, astonished. He knows that witches and wizards live longer than Muggles on average, but he still can’t quite get his head around the idea that a woman who stomps around on a moving bus and bakes scones every day, a woman who is currently sipping mulled wine from a paper cup and laughing until her hat falls off, could possibly be four times his own age.
“I’ll come now,” Harry says, ignoring Draco’s next words as he gets to his feet and Disapparates in one hurried movement.
“Someone had some money stolen from their till… quite a lot of money, actually, and I stayed with her while she waited for someone from MLE to turn up,” George says.
“You thought, you want, it’s all about you, isn’t it? You turn up here, walk around like you own the place, charming everyone in sight and turning everything upside down.” Draco scowls, unwrapping and rewrapping the string through his fingers as though trying to keep his feelings under control. “This is my bus, Potter, and my life, and you are not going to be the golden boy here, alright?”
Harry takes a deep breath, ignores his freezing, wet feet, and relents. “Number two was a poet. He passed out after two firewhiskies and then when I revived him, he wouldn’t get up off the floor until I’d heard all thirty-two verses of the poem he’d written about me.”
Luck seems to be on Luna’s side when she arrives at work the following morning. It isn’t quite as much on Deb’s, who is stuck at home with food poisoning from what Sam calls ‘dodgy prawns’, and neither is it on Draco’s, as he is asked to take over most of her duties for the day.
“More boys should knit,” Ida says over the top of her cup. “They can’t always expect their wives to do it for them.”
“You’ll have to wait and see, won’t you?” Harry says, and then they are whipping through space and reappearing in a deserted corner of the city and Rose is jumping down onto the pavement.
“Happy to help,” Harry says, taking the offered money and putting the bottle into a shiny bag. “I hope she likes it and decides to give you a break.”
“Neither are elephants, but that doesn’t stop my son putting a whole box full of them on his tree every year,” Audrey says brightly. “Light-up, they are, and all different colours.”
of December, and they will bring you home four days hence. With love and gratitude for all that you do, Eilish, Danica, Ida, Corrie, Audrey and Thora.”
“I’m not doing any harm, thank you very...” Draco jumps as something flickers against his ear. When he whips around and sees the vast snake practically resting on his shoulder, he ducks sideways, loses his balance and crashes to the floor, scrabbling for purchase against the nearest rack and bringing several hundred small boxes of owl treats raining down on top of him.
“Oh, look, the coffee pot’s empty,” she says, grabbing it and smiling at Harry. “I’ll go and make some more.”
Then again, he always sounds like that. Rose peers up at him from her desk, watching his odd, insect-like gait and the flap of his long, silver-streaked plait. Today his hair is tied at the end with a black velvet ribbon, but just as often it’s a piece of string, a shoelace, and on one memorable occasion, a surprisingly compliant little black snake.
“I’m pretty sure we all stopped thinking for a while there,” he says with a grim smile. “You stay here and we’ll see if we can get this sorted.”
“Mute swans aren’t mute!” she says, wide-eyed. “They hiss and they make a trumpet sound when they’re defending their terr—territorny.”
“Not today. I brought you this,” she says, pulling a glossy card from her pocket and handing it over with a proud smile.
After a moment of indecision, he does neither. He dashes for the door, down the corridor, skids into reception and stops dead.
“Yes, and I agree with her,” Shan says. She exchanges a significant glance with Mrs Barton and then points at the door. “Go on, then. Do it now before you change your mind.”
“What is it this time?” Ron asks, blowing on his hands for several seconds and then giving up and casting a warming charm.
“You’re making no sense,” Draco says, but his face has turned blank and his fingers are digging into the string, forcing their way between the layers and gripping tightly.
“I’m fine.” Draco flicks on his omnivox. “It’s Tuesday the twenty-fourth of May, it’s eight-fifteen, and this is the news.”
The sun is directly overhead by the time they stop for a break, leaning up against the cabin and drinking cold water from thick white mugs. The garden is far from tidy, but they have made a creditable start, Harry thinks. All of the stray leaves have been swept and bagged, the earth around the struggling herb garden has been cleared of weeds and detritus, and Harry has begun the mammoth task of cutting back an enormous thorned bush that seems determined to rip him to shreds in the process.
“Is that something you really want to worry about?” Draco asks, pulling the quilt over both of them and curling up on his side with one hand splayed possessively across Harry’s chest.
“No one. Everyone’s fine,” Draco says, and then sighs. “I’m not sure how to put this, but Harry and I have come to a realisation.”
Harry turns to him, drawn so tight by his smile that he doesn’t know if he wants to kiss him or hex him in the face.
There is so much yet to know about this man and his strange little social club on wheels, but he is starting to think that the experience might be more important than the details. The affection and forgiveness shown by Corrie, Eilish, Ida, and Danica is extraordinary, as is their no-nonsense treatment of a man so determined to be hard to know.
Someone knocks the wireless up a few notches and puts on a virtuoso performance of an old Celestina Warbeck hit, while Otis stands beside them and quite convincingly pretends to accompany on the piano.
“We should probably be grateful she can’t use her wand in the park,” Draco shrugs. “She likes to turn things purple.”
Over the next two hours, Draco makes frequent checks on the street below from the Eye in the Sky, keeping the listeners well abreast of the morning’s events. The fight over the skull is eventually broken up by two members of an MLE patrol, and the two old ladies are given a stern talking-to before being escorted home in opposite directions.
“George is having a stall,” Ginny says, grinning. “We’re going to be selling glasses with protective charms, cameras, all sorts of stuff. He’s even made eclipse-themed t-shirts. Some of them are really rude.”
. He’s never let anyone unsettle him like this, and yet somehow, what many have tried with fancy dinners and boxes at the Quidditch and epic poetry, Draco is achieving without a scrap of effort. He is just sitting there, very slowly eating an apple and driving a crotchety old bus down a country lane at ninety miles an hour.
“He’s mad,” Ron says, but there’s admiration in his voice as he watches Florean skating out into the middle of Diagon Alley, grey waves swaying behind him.
“We’ve already got the buckets made up,” Ginny says as Luna gets up from the table and goes to refill the kettle. “Verity’s done this brilliant design for them—it’s a silhouette of a piano and the moment of… I don’t remember what it’s called but the moment right before the eclipse, and then she’s done stars because it’s the Starlight Home, obviously…”
Luna watches as Ginny rummages in her bag, pulls out a large, paper-wrapped package and hands it over.
“That’s right. We flipped a Sickle for it. She was disappointed not to get you lot, but her side has the pet shop and the florist, so she’s happy enough.” Shan glances wearily out of the window. “If she doesn’t come home with an iguana and half a forest, I’ll be surprised.”
When she is out of sight, Draco lets out his laughter, leaning back in his chair and hiding his face beneath his towel.
, that he is just one step from losing himself completely, it could happen at any time, and the sensation of being constantly on edge is almost more than his heart and his mind and his body can endure.
“I’m not worried about anything,” Shan says easily. “It can snow, it can rain, it can hail… we’ll be doing it anyway.”
After a discussion that lasts long enough to requires three cups of tea and several rounds of cheese on toast, they agree that they will leave Strath Kinna the following morning, giving them just one more day and night before they return to reality.
Draco nods, watching him dig his fork into the food for a moment before he remembers that he is due to make an order for the duck pond. It’s been several days and he can’t quite remember what it is that he needs or why he even needs it, but through the fog in his brain he knows that it is somehow very important, so he closes his eyes and dredges his memory.
Mr Abernathy doesn’t wake until she is getting ready for bed. He shakes himself and struggles to his feet, sending pencils clacking everywhere, and when his little eyes fix upon her, she doesn’t think she imagines the weight of accusation there.
Draco pulls the lever to open the doors and then disappears out of sight. Intrigued, Harry climbs on board, waits for the doors to close behind him and then proceeds into the main body of the bus, where he finds Eilish, Corrie, Danica, and Ida seated around their usual table and Draco hurrying to join them. All but Eilish are scrutinising playing cards and glancing at little piles of Knuts at their side, while Eilish, sporting a bright green croupier’s visor, oversees the whole thing and keeps an eye on the larger pile of bronze coins in the centre of the table.
“At all,” Draco says, and he throws the lot into the fire. “As for you,” he says, turning to Harry, “My inks are from Scriveners—I’ll make you a list. And the next time you try that, I will let Stanley paint all over
’ Harry has read that sign more times than he can remember, and the thought of it sitting there in the middle of a crime scene makes him feel rather sick.
“I am a bit, actually,” he admits, and then almost jumps out of his skin when something starts tapping at the windscreen right next to his head.
Harry wobbles, instinctively reaching out to steady himself with a hand on Draco’s waist. The combination of warmth and strength he finds there only sends him further off balance and he hurries back to the safety of his chair while he still can. Draco sinks back onto the desk and rakes both hands through his hair.
Gareth doesn’t look up, but his world-weary expression intensifies as he says, “You can just tell. They look at each other funny, and that’s how people look when they’re in
Harry grins. He’s hot and aching and he thinks he might have a better idea. Slowly, he withdraws and rolls onto his side, propping up his head on one hand and gazing down at Draco.
Mr Jennings shrugs. “Did you really not see this coming?” he says with a bark of bitter laughter. “My business was failing and you let it. All of you. That’s not what friends do.”
“Look, Juno, we’re being hailed,” he whispers, smiling when the cat presses her cold nose against his earlobe. “We have to get to… erm, Birmingham, and we have to get there fast!”
“Hi, Harry,” she calls, foghorn voice causing several of the customers to jump. “Everything alright?”
“They will,” Draco says grimly, but he sets Stanley down and gathers up the rest of the homework parchments. “I think it’s better to destroy all of these if I want to keep teaching.”
She stops colouring and looks up, mouth slightly open. “Uncle Harry… you didn’t get bitten by a dragon, did you?”
“I know… but Elsa Graham—that’s the girl from second year who was supposed to be head bird—she’s had an attack of nerves and she can’t do it,” Hermione explains. “This happened all of half an hour ago. The teachers were panicking.”
“Better, Harry. Even better,” Mr Borteg says, pale eyes alight with excitement. “I will be performing the ceremony.”
“You do think they’d tell us the truth, don’t you?” Harry says. “I know we’re not MLE but they did all seem fine with this at the meeting.”
Draco is a powerhouse, an unstoppable force, and a completely ridiculous man all at once. He stalks up and down Diagon Alley as though he owns the place and bursts into Borteg’s with his bizarre questions and his eyes and his quirky little half smiles and everything Harry knows to be true is shoved from a high cliff and dashed on the rocks underneath. The truth is, Draco Malfoy makes his safe little world feel chaotic, and he doesn’t like that one bit.
“Well, just in case you weren’t, can you go and start the bus for me? I think I might have cracked it.”
“I love you,” Draco whispers, gasping when Harry leans down and brings them back into contact, burying his face in Draco’s neck as their hips slide together and draw a groan from both of them.
“I don’t know why you’d think I know anything about flagpoles, Harry,” she says calmly, and then, gathering her bag, she walks out of the office.
Harry watches as she turns the tiny pumpkin red, green and gold, before settling on a shimmering blue with a glittery finish that makes it look as though it has been caught in a sudden frost. She places it in the centre of her window box and then reaches into the plants with soil-covered hands.
“I’m afraid she will be returning to the Ministry after today,” Florean says regretfully. “I suspect they think someone like her is a little bit high level for our situation.”
“I haven’t forgotten that I work here,” Harry says. “You know, selling spirits, lighting fires, making things look all clean and shiny.”
“That’s fine. Rose really likes Draco,” she says, clearly unaware that he is sitting in Jean’s fireside armchair and listening to their conversation. “Go home and get some rest, okay?”
Checking his jeans pockets for his wand and wallet, he hurries back to the Entrance Hall where Draco is waiting, dressed in dark, close-sitting trousers and a thin green sweater. He smiles when he sees Harry, a real, unguarded smile, and Harry’s heart speeds at the sight of it.
“I wouldn’t mind her,” Harry says, stretching comfortably. “She wears fur and she doesn’t seem to feel guilty about it at all.”
He hums to himself as he vanishes the remains of the studio’s coffee and refills the tin with the decaffeinated variety. That, he hopes, will teach the lates to pilfer his secret stash, and if it doesn’t, perhaps the switch to extra-caffeinated in a week or two will finish the job.
By the time Harry has explained to Danica that he really is coming back this time and that they are definitely still going to the Christmas play, made his way into the Leaky, had an involved conversation with Tom the barman about the rising price of turnips and opened the archway into Diagon Alley, the sun is rising and the shopkeepers are lighting their coloured lamps and unlocking their doors.
“You shouldn’t,” Harry assures. “I didn’t think of it either until someone brought it up at our shopkeepers’ meeting. It’s just nice to be able to do something about it. The idea is, you pay a Galleon for an ornament that you get to keep, and then you buy a present for a child and bring it back to put under our tree.”
“Yes, they are,” Molly says, cutting off Ron’s next remark and looking around her kitchen with satisfaction. “Now… is everybody here? Angelina’s in Scotland with the team, Percy’s at the in-laws’, Bill’s still in Algeria…” She glances at each of the rest of them in turn and then frowns. “Where on earth is George?”
With Draco and Needle in tow, he crosses the cobbles to find that a queue has formed at the new stall, and they wait, watching a portly gentleman in a feathered hat moving around and beaming at his customers from beneath a luxurious moustache. Now that his wares are visible, Harry is able to sort out the delicious scents into two categories—the warm and spicy from an enormous pot of mulled wine, and the robust, savoury tang from more German sausages than he has ever seen in one place. They dangle from every square inch of the stall’s roof, swinging in the wind like the gleaming brown leaves of some improbable tree. The front of the stall hosts more sausages, long and thin, short and stout and everything in between, each carefully labelled and handled by the man’s thick fingers as though they are made of delicate china.
“Sorry, Mr Borteg,” Harry says almost in a whisper. He’s not entirely certain whether loud arguments can hurt barrels of maturing whisky, but he’d rather not take the chance.
What he finds at the table makes his heart swell with relief and prickly warmth. The lacy tablecloth is strewn with earth, gardening tools and plants. Each of the ladies, including Thora and Audrey, has a long wooden box and is working away with gusto. Even Corrie has put down her knitting needles and is stuffing poinsettias and stripy grasses into her box, which she has spelled a vivid shade of scarlet.
Perhaps a gift for goat noises isn’t a fitting talent for a Malfoy. As far as Harry is concerned, that just makes it even more brilliant.
“He’s with my mother, in her bedroom. They both seemed unnerved by the situation, so they’ve holed up in there with tea and her quilting project.”
Harry sips his beer, throwing in his pound and taking an answer sheet when the quizmaster comes around. When the quiz starts, they all lean in around Hermione, who has the pen and the neatest handwriting. Despite having two supposed Muggle experts on the team, there are so many blank spaces on their answer sheet by the end of the first round that Hermione starts writing down even the most nonsensical suggestions from her teammates.
He hasn’t yet seen any ducks in the Magical Menagerie, which means that Potter will have to order one in. Such an undertaking will buy him some extra time in the shop, and one more duck in his collection won’t be any trouble at all. He doesn’t know why he hasn’t thought of it before.
He changes into clean clothes and leaves the house with the letter before he can change his mind, Apparating into Diagon Alley and heading straight for the Post Office. Feeling unsettled and liberated at the same time, he nips into the shop next door and emerges minutes later with a set of photographs from Draco’s camera. Shivering in the biting wind, he buttons up his coat, pulls his new red bobble hat over his ears and hangs back from the crowds of Christmas panic-buyers to look at them.
There is something very familiar about the man behind the wheel, and though there’s no way in hell that Draco Malfoy would be driving the Knight Bus, this man resembles him so strongly that he can’t believe no one else has noticed. They’re just piling onto the bus as if he’s not there, laughing and stumbling and adjusting their antlers. Fred, bringing up the rear, drops several extra coins into the metal scoop with the request that the driver “loop around a bit, you know… we’re not in a hurry.” Then he, too, joins the others inside, leaving Harry alone on the pavement.
To his surprise, Draco laughs, a real laugh, not a snort or a sardonic bark but a warm, dry sound of real amusement. Harry smiles into his cup and leans back on the bench, letting the warm wine dissolve his tension and watching with interest as Eilish fishes a tin of cakes out of her bag and starts handing them around. As she turns around to offer the tin to Harry and Draco, the badly behaved swan stretches its neck and steals an iced bun.
He puts the earmuffs on and links his fingers through Harry’s as they walk through the quiet street, huffing out cold breath and kicking up frost. Harry darts covert glances at the earmuffs, feeling sure that he wants to make some comment but unable to string the words together. As earmuffs go, they are unremarkable, plain and black without a fluffy pink fibre in sight, but the sight of Draco wearing them is just…
“I’ve forgotten,” Winston says firmly, with such an exaggerated shrug that his elbow bangs into Surya’s and she drops her ice cream straight onto Stanley’s back.
“I remember that,” Harry says, shaking his head. “It would have stuck up above the other buildings on that side of the street. It just wasn’t practical… but…”
“Don’t stop,” Draco murmurs, and Harry hesitates only for a second before abandoning himself to it, losing himself to the slide of Draco’s cock inside him and tipping back his head to watch the stunning, swirling colours of the Northern Lights.
Harry gives him a look that would stop a Crumple-Horned Snorkack in its tracks. “I can lie. I can say... ‘Hey, Draco, that grey shirt you’re wearing is really interesting’. That would be a lie.”
Harry smiles grimly. “I think my problem has always been not knowing when to give up. A few weeks ago I just sort of... snapped. I thought I could just... I thought I could just give them the finger, you know? Do things that didn’t make sense. Show them that I didn’t give a fuck, they could print what they wanted.”
By the time the others begin to talk of their plans, he is beginning to wonder if he should prise himself from his self-imposed solitude and join them. There’s a bathroom at the foot of the first staircase, and he knows that his clothes are sitting there, washed and pressed, “and dried outside, Harry, dear,” Molly reminds him every time she bustles into his room with cups of tea and sandwiches, face etched into varying shades of anxiety, grief, relief and proud fortitude.
As she showers and dresses and heads out to the home, she thinks about the new notes in her bag and smiles to herself. It’s not a complete plan, not quite yet, but she has the feeling that she’s only waiting for one last little piece so that she can tie it all together and unleash it on her unsuspecting friends.
“Of course I did, she was our pupil, a very bright young lady, a bit non-conventional if I might say. Her mother was muggle-born, you see. She had trouble adjusting to a lot of the children here.” Auntie summoned a photograph of much younger Elise standing next to other children, her hair artfully braided and that smug grin on her face Draco had witnessed firsthand. “I was so proud of her and Oliver graduating Hogwarts and going on to become Aurors.”
“That might explain why I am not in Azkaban yet and Potter’s not back at Saint Mungo’s,” Draco chuckled lightly and ran his hands through his hair. “So what are you? MACUSA? M16? Interpol? ”
“Don’t get the tuna sandwich, that stuff is unfit for human consumption,” the nurse advised and waved him off.
Cannenta turned around and saw a tall stranger clad in expensive-looking dark green robes, their face obscured by the hood.
Harry did not expect to find himself at the entrance to such an establishment. He once had an accident of walking into a muggle gay bar while being completely pissed, but this time he was completely sober. The envelope he had received from Lavender Brown at the Battle of Hogwarts Memorial contained an invitation of a sort to the group that was supposed to gather at this very place, this very evening. It was called Lycanthropes Anonymous. And after a few especially annoying arguments with Hermione, Harry was fed up enough to agree at least to see what it was all about. So far it had looked more like a party than the quiet meeting he anticipated, but Harry was not about to listen to his best friend nagging again, so he bit the bullet and went inside.
Felicity’s smile fades. “That’s right. He dumped me about a month ago. What’s that got to do with anything?”
Potter rolls his eyes. “Well, you might be looking for material for your radio show. In which case, you can bugger right off.”
Still looking bewildered, he hands the boat to Molly, who beams at him. Harry frowns, biting his nail and wondering what it is about the little scene that is pulling at the back of his head. There’s a thread there, a thread that’s attached to something important, but he can’t seem to catch it.
With a twist of sadness, Harry looks over at Shan and Esmee, who are lifting ruined crackleballs out of their smudged display case.
“How lovely,” she says, scanning the details on the card. “Goodness, it’s in two days’ time! Right here in Diagon Alley! Aren’t you worried it’s going to snow?”
“Don’t be, he’ll be delighted,” Draco says, almost sounding amused. “All that stuff that the other Slytherins think about me trying to weasel my way into your good graces—he’ll think that’s a brilliant idea. Almost makes me want to call the whole thing off.”
Harry nods and accepts a small, leather bound book filled with photographs of a grinning dark-haired woman who looks so much like her mother and is clearly in possession of her bright spirit.
Clearly relieved, the man studies his scribbled notes. Draco perches on the edge of Rose’s desk with an expectant look on his face. Harry pretends he’s not there.
It’s ten past nine by the time they make it down to the ice cream parlour, and Shan and Esmee are already waiting for them, wrapped up in thick coats and festive hats.
“Good! Now listen to me—somebody told me that that music…” She pauses to let the upbeat melody surge through the group, “…is so loud that no one will be able to hear us.”
“Luna,” Otis says, hanging onto her arm of the sofa. “We get two Sickles a week spending money. Even if we saved up
“I don’t know,” Harry admits, trying to imagine Draco in his kitchen, asking a piece of glass for advice.
“Don’t worry,” she says, dashing into the house and leaving Harry alone in the garden. “You’ll like this one.”
“That’s sensible,” Draco approves. “I wouldn’t mind going over there and giving him a kick, though.”
Harry releases his hand and rubs at his face. The idea of interrupting Rose’s festive ice cream-making session to share such horrible news is an unpleasant one, but Harry knows there is no holding on to this information. He tucks the notes into his pocket and they walk slowly down to the ice cream parlour, neither keen to reach their destination.
Draco knows full well that he got the scratch while attempting to juggle pineapples on the steps of Gringotts first thing this morning, but he decides not to mention it. For now.
People are looking, and Draco can’t blame them. He thinks Potter is pretending not to notice, which just makes the whole thing even more bewildering.
“I’ve been thinking. This isn’t about being invisible,” he says, the moment the shop is empty of customers. “It’s about not being noticed.”
Harry and Rose arrive at the shop just before nine o’clock to find Shan, Esmee and Mr Borteg deep in conversation. When she is handed her cup of hot pumpkin juice, she thanks Harry and carries it carefully over to her desk, where she unpacks her pencils and half-finished story without bothering to take her coat off. Harry watches her with a smile, drinking his steaming tea and promising himself that he will do all he can to shield her from the events of the past fortnight. The world can be a cruel place but Rose sees only the good in everyone and everything, and he’d like to keep her that way for at least a little bit longer.
“Right. Which chair do you want?” Draco asks, sitting in the one nearest the map without waiting for a response.
With the help of the hard work and Gertie’s home-cooked food, they end each day comfortably worn out, and the addition of clean, fresh air, freezing swims and energetic sex, sleep comes easily. Harry can’t remember the last time he had a nightmare, and Draco has never been so relaxed. He is no longer automatically wary of everyone he meets, and, on rainy afternoons when they aren’t otherwise occupied, he has taken to playing chess with Timothy from the Post Office. Harry, who has never had much skill at either the Muggle or wizarding versions of the game, sits back on the settle with Maurice and sips at a half of Ginger Rodent.
“What are you doing to that beetle?” asks someone with a stern voice that echoes around the stone chamber.
“We’ll stay here with her,” she tells Harry, placing his namesake on the marble counter in his cage and smiling at him. “Wonderful house, isn’t it?”
“Enough,” she says, closing her book before he can see the little doodles she has made of all of them.
With some effort he tunes out Ron’s unnecessary gleeful retelling of the hypnotist story and peers at the clock on the mantel, working out how much time he has to get home, shower, change into normal clothes and then, most crucially, obtain coffee and bacon before he’s needed on the Knight Bus.
“He has,” Draco agrees, at last disentangling himself from Harry and sitting upright, crossing one leg over the other and managing to look impossibly dignified for the situation. Harry doesn’t need a mirror to tell him that he looks like a hungover scarecrow, though the one in the Weasleys’ bathroom will probably take great pleasure in informing him of the fact.
Potter’s mouth flickers at one corner. He picks up a quill and begins to scribble. “I know. You saw me on your telescope.”
“Yeah, of course I am,” he lies, stretching and smiling at Draco from the second best chair by the fire.
A minute or two later, she walks back into a comfortable silence. Harry accepts the coffee gratefully and Luna sits down next to him, sipping at her own drink and watching Mary Ann and a rather washed-out-looking Deb poring over a magazine article. At his desk, Sam is grimacing and scratching away with his quill, and behind them, the teachers dart in and out, fetching and swapping things for the day’s lessons.
“Just to confirm that, the Eye in the Sky has revealed what appears to be a crocodile, currently being taken down Diagon Alley for a walk in the rain by Harry Potter,” he says, attempting to sound professional but suspecting he doesn’t quite keep the very real bewilderment out of his voice.
“You know what? I really don’t want to talk about it,” Draco says, reaching over and snatching the paper from her.
Letting out a long, controlled breath, he wraps his arms around his knees and tucks himself in tight. He’s going to go back, because he promised Eilish and because he is not the sort of person who runs away from his problems. All he has to do is not think about it.
“In the end, yes.” Draco strokes Harry’s thumb with his own and gazes down at Needle with an unexpected smile. “You never liked him, did you?”
“He’s not a swan expert, is he?” Harry says, unsure why they are talking about Draco yet again. “He’s got one swan, and it’s a weird swan at that. I’m not sure it’s even like other swans.”
“Need a hand?” he offers, and she stands stubbornly firm for a moment before allowing him to take Hugo from her.
When Draco tips a clear liquid into one hand and begins to idly wash Harry’s shoulders and chest, he smiles, recognising the scent immediately.
Harry opens the till, takes Shan’s Galleons and counts out a few more Knuts and Sickles than he owes her. Two can play at that game, he thinks, handing over the coins and watching her sling them into her coat pocket without a second thought.
“One more boot, thank you,” Harry laughs, grasping Stanley by the shell and finishing the job with a flourish that makes Draco want to mock him and hug him at the same time.
She has never been much of a planner, preferring to let things happen naturally—chaotically if necessary—but being friends with Hermione over the years has taught her that a little organisation goes a long way, and as such, she has chosen to outline her project using the structure she has gleaned from her friend’s notebooks and folders and bits of paper pinned to cork-boards.
Draco snorts. “If they’re going to lie to anyone, it’s going to be MLE, not us. Besides,” he says airily, “No one would dare to tells untruths in the presence of Needle the Crime Swan.”
“Stopping would be lovely,” Harry calls, turning pink in the face as the music becomes faster and he is forced to keep up.
“Did it occur to you that you could… not come at all?” he asks, and there is a complete lack of sarcasm in his tone.
“Thank you very much,” Harry says, following them to the fireplace and holding out the pot of Floo powder.
“He was here the other day,” Harry says suddenly. “Jennings, I mean. Remember, when Rose was reading her story? Needle was being really fussy and you had to settle him down.”
When he wakes, the fire is down to embers and several of the candles have burned out completely. Pleasantly fuzzy from sex and Gertie’s very potent brew, he stretches and glances at the clock.
She takes her seat at the large, scrubbed pine table and picks up her cup. Every few seconds she turns and glances at Rose, who is playing in the corner, as though terrified that the Prophet reporters might swoop in through the open window and carry her away. Though pale and drawn, she seems pleased to see Harry and curiously unsurprised to see Draco. He can’t remember the last time they were even in the same room together, yet she has welcomed him into her home like an old friend. Shame and bewilderment curl in his stomach, mixing with fear and desire every time he chances a glance at Harry, and he barely notices when he burns his mouth on the hot tea.
“In that case, you won’t mind putting all of those boxes back in the right places. And then, if you like, you can bugger off, because I’ve got a stock take to do and you are very much under my feet,” Potter says, and then he steps over Draco and heads for the counter just as the bell above the door rings and two immaculately-dressed ladies step into the shop.
“Look... lavender... sorrel... sage... there was a herb garden here,” he says, pointing to one corner, where a bedraggled collection of plants are now visible.
“They’re all single,” Draco says, now pacing the floor and fiddling with the ends of his hair. “Reuben just ended his engagement, Jean’s a widow, Mrs Purley has been divorced for years, and Mr Jennings never married.”
“Yeah, but I’m rubbish at concealment charms,” Timothy admits. “I was hoping that one of you might…”
Draco watches her step back from him and then Disapparate in a cloud of heavy perfume. Despite her frequent insinuations, he isn’t actually looking for a man. He’s quite content to be by himself, in fact, and when he actually desires some company, he has Pansy, he has firecalls with his parents, which are never dull. He has his colleagues at the WWN, some of whom are due a coffee-related act of revenge. He has a number of ways to spend his afternoons, too, he reminds himself firmly, when his eyes drift quite without his permission in the direction of the Magical Menagerie.
“Plus, what would your mother say if you turned up full of someone else’s pork?” Hermione asks and then frowns. “That sounded a lot ruder than I meant it to.”
Draco sighs and lets them get on with it. He supposes he has spent enough time invading Harry’s place of work recently, and as for Pansy... he wonders if Bill might let them borrow Brenda one more time. He thinks he might have just discovered exactly what sort of occasion necessitates a crocodile.
Harry touches his arm gently and Draco turns to him, surprised. “Me neither. And I’ve never seen Mr Borteg look worried before. It was…”
They part ways in a gentle silence that seems underlined by a new fall of drifting snowflakes. Harry stands on the cobbles until people start to bump into him, then wanders to the shop and lets himself in.
“Ah. Well, that’s a Black thing,” Draco says helpfully. “She used to look at me like that when I was little, if she thought I was lying.”
In the end, he decides to hug her, wrapping his arms around her smile and her curls and her brand new lavender-coloured jumper.
“I’d love one,” Harry says, suddenly very aware that he has neglected to feed himself properly over the last day or so. “How’s the wedding cake going?”
Harry glances between his friends, determined not to look at Draco, whose smugness is so potent that he can feel it prickling all over his skin. Then again, it could be the fever returning. He gives in.
There is no need for words, not now, and as they walk back up the street, through the restaurant and up to Draco’s flat, everything that needs to be said is spoken in heated glances and the brushing of fingertips against palms. At the bedroom door, Harry stops and attempts to locate Needle in the dark living room, finding him at last under the windowsill, peacefully dead to the world in a large, blanket-lined basket. Harry follows Draco into the bedroom, this time making sure to close the door behind him.
“I know you’re not... But I need you to plea not guilty nonetheless. You need to state that you were afraid for his family. That you are deeply sorry about your previous beliefs and that you decided to switch sides because of deep compassion to muggleborns.” scarhead wasn’t even looking at Draco when he said all that.
Harry exhaled warily, watching Cho disappear into the crowd. Maybe he shouldn't have mentioned wanting a drink with another girl to his ex. In any way, it was getting ridiculous with the ever-elusive Kawahara. He couldn't get out of his head the feeling that something was off. Usually, his instincts were correct. And so it was time for Harry to start obsessing over another blonde yet again.
… Draco is inside a very small room, it looks like a cupboard and it is dark and stuffy… the boy is sitting inside… clutching the torn piece of parchment in his small palm… he looks like a house-elf in his washed-out oversized hand-me-downs… An angry red-faced man opens the door and wrestles a piece of parchment away from the boy’s hands… he bellows something about owl infestation…
Draco shook his head, a crooked smile on his lips. She decided to press on some more. Something she had said before made him trust her enough to let her see.That is why she wouldn't let go of the opportunity to finish off a bit earlier today if it all went well enough.
“They want the children with lycanthropy to be segregated into separate classrooms! The likes of Valerian Flint want us to disappear from their list of voters on the next Minister for Magic elections. But we’re here! And we demand justice! We demand that people with lycanthropy are not classified as dark beings! We demand better access to healthcare and potions. We demand the elimination of discrimination in the workplace, school, and housing! We are human and want human rights!”
“Alright, but you owe me, Malfoy!” Granger warned him and took out a parchment to dart down their plan.
He gaped at the sudden change of attitude in Malfoy, he didn’t know whether it was because he really needed those memories or if he cared for the kids in the orphanage and what happened to Baelish. The elf stared at him like a little mouse would watch a magnetizing dance of a cobra before the strike. There was one thing for Harry to speak to her as equal, but seeing a pure-blood heir regard a servant in such a manner was completely different.
He was in the middle of nowhere, some road stretched through the countryside when the realization hit him. Somebody’d definitely modified his memory. A moment ago he couldn’t even remember that he preferred men.
Level Two looked deserted, there was only a night watcher at the post and he was sleeping merrily, his nose buried in a raunchy wizarding romance novel. Williamson opened the  Head Auror office and gestured towards a can of sardines that was on the desk.
“I am sorry… I didn’t know,” Draco replied lamely. Once again he fucked up something that was supposed to make them closer to each other. “Aunt Bella… she told me he could torture people with legillimency, so she taught me how to protect my mind… that was the most horrible experience in my life. I learned pretty quickly that to withstand all those things that were happening in my house I needed to imagine that I wasn’t there, that it was happening to someone else…”
He trailed kisses over Potter’s neck, tasting tender skin there, feeling the frantic beating of his pulse. And then he decided to be cruel and bit harder at the sensitive place near the clavicle, leaving a mark.
Dusk was settling down Hogwarts’ grounds, first snowflakes dancing in the cold November air. They were in that secluded passage again, sitting by the big stained-glass window. Malfoy drank the Draught and unceremoniously put his blonde head into the Gryffindor’s lap, closing his eyes and exhaling contently.
Harry was overly excited for two days straight, he had so much extra energy he spent his time dusting every surface of Grimmauld place and rearranging books and knick-knacks on the shelves. He couldn’t go back to Hogwarts just yet, the Healers said that he needed to spend two full moons without any symptoms to be able to return to his studies safely. His wounds were bothering him sometimes, especially when the weather got worse and it started snowing heavily again, but with the amount of potions, he took all the time he was surprised he could feel anything at all.
and he strengthens his resolve. They’re here now, and they might as well make the best of it, at least until they figure out what the best of it might be.
Harry groans and rubs his face with both hands. “I’m starting to think that both of you know me too well,” he says, getting to his feet. He takes a deep breath. “Erm… I’m afraid I have to be off now. Thank you for the lovely dinner and I’ll see you all very soon, but I have to… I have to go.”
For a moment there is a wonderful, delighted silence. Luna, Deb and Mary Ann exchange triumphant glances, Harry and Draco continue to stare at each other and the two teachers in the entryway look on with interest. When something crashes to the floor in the corridor beyond, everyone seems to snap back to attention. The teachers grab up their things and scuttle out to deal with the incident and corral their students, Draco retreats back to his own chair and pretends interest in Deb’s magazine once more, and Sam shuffles his papers and attempts to retake command of the room.
Rose’s eyes widen and she hesitates only for a moment before letting go of her mother’s hand and hurrying to Draco’s side.
It is, of course, a work of art. The lacy exterior, designed to melt only in the mouth, is a riot of glossy dark, milk and white chocolate, with dashes of vibrant orange and caramelised nuts. He can smell the spices already, and the desire to shove the whole thing in his mouth is only outweighed by the knowledge that doing so will make him feel extremely sick.
George obeys and slams his glass down on the table to a delighted chorus of laughter and applause. Moments later, an old man creaks down the stairs and peers at them in bewilderment.
“Why do you give a fuck about this?” he demands. “We were fine without you and we’ll be fine again once you’ve lost interest.”
The soft woollen thing within unravels itself almost all the way to the floor, revealing itself to be a scarf knitted with a complicated snowflake pattern in blue, red and white. Harry puts it on immediately, startled to find that it hangs perfectly in place without his interference and loops a gentle silky warmth around his neck.
Draco flips through the pages and then arches an eyebrow. “Really? ‘Hermit Potter— unsociable behaviour leads to worries of damaged mental health’?” he reads.
The air is cold and sweet, settling over Diagon Alley with a clear sort of stillness that makes everything seem just that little bit prettier than usual. Above the jagged rooftops, the sky is melting from orange and pink to a very promising blue, and Harry feels sure that the worst of the ice will be gone by the time Esmee and Shan are ready to recite their vows. It’s the perfect backdrop for the winter solstice, and an even better one for a long-awaited wedding, he thinks, humming to himself as he and Rose walk to the ice cream parlour.
When he opens his eyes again, the rain has eased slightly and Draco is no longer next to him. Startled, Harry sits up bolt upright and feels for his wand, only to find it missing from his pocket.
Harry nods and scarpers, secretly terrified that the spotlight now fixed on the man in the suit will follow him back to his seat and light him up in shame as the man who doesn’t know how to behave at a primary school Christmas play. Fortunately, he makes it back just as the man introduces himself as the headmaster and starts to thank various teachers and parents for their hard work.
“You know, I’ve lost count of the number of friends who’ve apologised to me about something they’ve accidentally said to some undercover shit of a reporter that has then ended up in the paper the next day. They want a quote about me. Something they can twist into a story. When I started doing all this weird stuff... the hair, the pineapples—”
Draco’s eyebrows knit together in thought. “I think they’re Bill and Annie, but I wouldn’t put any money on it.”
“Er…” Harry manages, gulping his mulled wine and burning his tongue. Juno appears at his feet, takes one look at the mass of birds and leaps onto his lap, purring and sticking her claws into his legs. “Fuck,” he whispers. Juno peers at him with her head on one side.
“We have several pieces of evidence,” Draco says, and his voice is enviably calm as he explains everything they have found, including the notes, which Harry gives to Florean to read.
They lapse once more into silence. Draco casts around for the right words and comes up with nothing, so he watches the shoppers and the stallholders, trying not to think of the warmth and ease with which their conversation had come less than a day before.
“Is it me, or does it look worse now than it did this morning?” Harry asks Draco, who has just appeared behind him with two steaming cups.
“Look, Mrs Purley’s put a sign in her window,” Harry says, licking a drip of cherry ice cream just before it drips onto his coat. The combination of flavours is exactly what he didn’t know he wanted, and of course it is, because Florean is a bloody genius.
Harry’s hand shoots into the air before he can stop it. “I’ll do it,” he says, and then glances at Mr Borteg, who is finally crunching the very end of his cone.
Something about that thought jars inside him and he frowns, looking around and waiting for it to come to him.
Bracing himself against the edge of the hole, Harry leans down and sweeps his wand around the interior. When he finds nothing, he casts a series of detection charms and then pulls himself upright.
“Right.” She breathes in deeply, exhales slowly, and turns to the little girl. “Rose... yesterday, when you were playing in the garden, did you talk to Mr Fortuna?”
“Even George?” Luna asks, remembering that George usually has to be persuaded to close his shop on Christmas Day.
“I’ve been asking myself the very same question,” Shan says, patting him on the arm and then clomping behind the counter. She puts her arm around Esmee’s waist and sighs. “And then I start wondering, who’s next?”
“I’m so sorry about all this,” he says at the door, and to his surprise, Marius shakes his hand again.
With no idea what to say, Harry just stares at him. When the curtain is opened and Eilish appears, it seems to him as though it must be obvious to her, all of it.
Draco says nothing but ruffles his hair back into place and hurries to catch up. Darkness is falling by the time they have asked for sacks from every shopkeeper and stallholder, and Needle has begun to express his displeasure at the whole enterprise by hissing loudly and sitting down in protest every few yards.
“I’m here. Draco called me. He’ll be back in a minute,” Harry says, trying not to draw attention to the fact that he isn’t wearing shoes.
Harry snorts. “I think you’re giving me a bit too much credit, Es. I’m not nearly that organised. Besides, you know half of my presents will come from your shop.”
Once upon a time, it was returning from his trips that made him feel lonely. Now he wonders if he ever really knew anything about loneliness at all. He has grown to know and love this group of tough old women who have rejected their solitude and built themselves a family of their own, clinging to one another no matter what and enfolding into their midst a man who has quite literally tried to drive away his isolation and failed, because they love him just the way he is.
“I found it,” he says. “I was making a cup of tea in his rooms and it was just sitting there in the teapot.”
Harry hesitates, wondering if Danica would prefer a madeleine or a miniature tarte tatin. Wondering if this whole adventure is going to end up as just another story on his list of failures. Wondering what it would feel like to smear millefeuille against Draco’s face and then kiss him into sticky, sweet, irritable abandon.
“You looked wonderful,” Draco says, kissing him and allowing his hard cock to brush against Harry’s hip.
“Okay, but why these two businesses? There are others on the street that have less security than us. Places where they wouldn’t have had to break a window and seal it up again.” Harry rubs at his cold face and gazes down the dark alley. “I think we were targets. All of us.”
It takes a little while longer than usual, but Sam does eventually manage to claw back some sense of decorum, and he dispatches the team on their afternoon tasks. Luna keeps one eye on Harry and Draco, checking on their progress in between one-to-one meetings, activity groups, and breaking up arguments over name-calling and stolen biscuits. By three o’clock, the charms seem to have worn off completely and Harry and Draco are back to almost their usual selves.
“I understand that,” Draco says, “and I will do everything else on this list, but I will not do that.”
Harry brushes leaves from his coat and walks back to the house, unsure whether to kick himself for being a coward or celebrate their breakthrough. In the end, he just lets himself in to number twelve and makes himself a cup of tea before settling in front of the fireplace with his pot of Floo powder. Hermione is delighted by the invitation and relays the message that Ron is already thinking about trying everything on Sage’s menu.
“Harry, this is Mrs Barton,” Shan says, indicating her customer. “Mrs Barton thinks you should make up with Draco.”
“You could use these to keep his feet warm,” the boy says, taking a handful of soft, white things from his pocket.
Harry does as he’s told. When he wakes up, he’s alone. Night has fallen and the bus is in darkness but for the glimmer of tiny purple bulbs all around him. Six neat window boxes sit on the table, guarded by a watchful Juno. The whole thing leaves Harry feeling disoriented, and it takes him a moment to centre himself and climb stiffly out of his chair. As he does, he hears footsteps on the stairs, and then Draco emerges from the forest of lights and grants him a weary smile.
“Not a good idea,” he mutters, breathless now and starting to regret his choice of clothing. Harry’s jeans are soaked and moulded to his skin, but the waistband is slipping with every step and it’s only a matter of time before the whole mess of fabric is flapping around his ankles. It’s going to be a banner day for the gossip-mongers, he supposes, and then the thought dissolves because Stanley is scuttling right along the lake shore and then, illuminated by another flash-crash-bang, he is leaping straight into the water.
“No Orishas were harmed in the making of this sphere,” Draco says, appearing behind Harry and granting the stallholder a surprisingly warm smile.
Laughter ripples around the room and Harry flushes even harder but he stands his ground, folding his arms and grinning sheepishly and pretending not to notice Draco’s startled expression. Only pretending, though—they both
When Harry walks in behind him, her eyes grow entertainingly wide, but to her credit, she continues reading the news without a hitch, including the story about the unexpected fireworks that had mysteriously appeared over Diagon Alley the previous morning.
“Do you really think Harry is involved with that… coffee shop person?” Draco asks suddenly, and the flicker of vulnerability on his face fills Luna with hope.
Harry laughs, tipping his head back on the pillow. Now starting to feel hot and sticky, he swipes his hair out of his eyes and drags Draco down for an awkward but very necessary kiss.
If he’s honest, he knows he’s lucky to have recovered from that misguided episode with Ginny and come out of it with a sister and a friend. His other attempts have left him nothing more than suffocated and miserable. Single life suits him, and he has no idea why he would give it up again for someone like Geraint, who was so obsessed with Quidditch that Harry actually stopped enjoying it and who would sulk for days every time his team lost. Then there was Phillipe, who was astonishingly handsome but also the most boring man Harry has ever met, revelling in both the idea of
“Shut up, Draco,” he says loudly to the ceiling, but the cultured, sardonic voice seems to follow him all the way down to the kitchen and all the way through boiling the kettle and buttering his toast.
With a little sigh that usually means ‘well, that’s a bit boring’, he picks up his cup and turns to look out over the stream, the trees, and the bracken-covered peaks in the distance.
He doubts Potter will be there, seeing as he’s apparently now a full-time hermit, but he steps into the shop anyway, squinting as his eyes adjust to the dim light after the brightness of the midday sunshine. The next thing that hits him is the smell, a musty, pungent mixture of fur, feathers, mud, sawdust and rotting fruit; the first inhalation makes him screw up his nose in distaste, but after a few slow breaths, the aroma softens and seems to settle around him in a warm fug. The place is much bigger than it looks from the outside, stretching right back from the street in a bulging pear shape, shelves and cages lining every inch of wall and climbing right up to the ceiling.
“You never know.” The man pauses at the door. “I heard about the robberies, you know. Do you think they’ll find out who did it?”
“So, he’s just about stopped trying to do a handstand and the bloke says, ‘right, now it’s time for bed’ and Harry starts stripping off, right in the middle of the stage. He tries to stop him, you can tell he didn’t expect him to do that, but Harry just keeps going until he gets to his boxers, at which point the audience start wetting themselves laughing because his boxers have got little blue pixies all over them!”
“Ooh, do you like him?” asks Benny, abandoning his colouring book and turning from his seat at the table, legs swinging.
Luna turns and leans back against her tree, stomach flipping. She reaches for her notebook and quill with shaky fingers and draws a large tick next to each of their photographs in bright purple ink. When they head back to the house, she edges further around the tree and out of sight. She can still hear the scrape and swing of the ceilidh band, the laughter of her friends, the cries of her father as he directs one dance after another.
“Maybe,” Draco says, but he doubts that all the speculation in the world will help to solve the mystery that is Potter. Not that Draco finds him mysterious, he’s just... Draco sighs. “Oh, look at that. Time for the news.”
Harry wants to resist; he wants, in the politest way possible, to tell Esmee to mind her own business, to stand up and walk out of the flat with his dignity mostly intact. He tries his best, but Esmee’s encouraging smile is too much for him, and the words just come tumbling out. He tells her everything, from their work together on the investigation to their talk in the distillery, finishing with an account of the incident at Sage that makes him want to hex himself in the face. Esmee listens in silence, nodding and only occasionally interrupting him to cough into her handkerchief.
When no one can eat another thing, everyone returns to the house, where they stuff themselves into the living room and play ridiculous games by the fire. To everyone’s surprise, Mr Borteg is particularly adept at ‘Name That Quidditch Foul’ and wins himself a whole pile of Molly’s home-made toffee. Rose climbs up beside Narcissa and watches her sew neat stitches into a little embroidery hoop, and Harry watches from his sprawl at Draco’s side as Narcissa patiently shows her how it’s done. Hermione hold Hugo’s hands as he walks around the room, insisting on touching each person as he passes. She smiles at Harry and he smiles back, full of good food and pleasantly weary. When Needle and Kingsley curl up together at his feet to sleep off their Christmas treats, he watches their slow, contented breathing with quiet envy.
“Anyway, this is where the cabin is,” George says, sliding a glossy photograph into the centre of the table. “Angie wants to hike up that fell but I’ve got quite a few other ideas.”
In the darkest corner of the wardrobe, behind a stack of cleaning products, is a jumbled pile of green something, and Harry leans down to retrieve it. As soon as his fingers touch the rubber, he laughs.
With that, he hugs Molly and Arthur and hurries to the back door, pretending that he doesn’t hear the giggling that follows him all the way outside. In the lane, he draws his wand and waits, heart pounding. The bus lurches up beside him within seconds, and Draco has barely opened the doors before Harry is up the steps and catching him up in a dizzying kiss that tastes of sugar and rich, dark fruit.
“That’s not magic. Anyway, Mr Troughton is doing that. But I thought… you’ll know some people who can come and wave to her. You know lots of people.”
“I eat fine, I promise,” Harry says, heart twisting. “It would have been nice to have been six foot, but I don’t think it’s going to happen.”
Draco is easily distracted by the prospect of food, and Harry is able to steer him away from the stationery before he asks any more strange questions in front of the Muggles. Having counted out all the coins in his pocket, he rashly uses every last one of them to buy bread and milk and cheese and chocolate, hanging onto the hope that he really did see a tin of tea bags back in the cabin. With tea and toast and whatever Gertie has to offer them, they can’t go too far wrong.

„This is Harry. We know each other from school and I made his life hell back then and he mine. We quite hated each other and now we’ll see what comes off it…“
„Seriously, Potter. First, I served my duty and got cleared of any charges. I would be a free man if I had decided to stay in Britain. No need to go to Muggle Paris and strut around like one of the peacocks my father loved so much. Second, there would be better disguises that come with less discrimination. Third, no one cares anymore. You might still be a celebrity. I am not. I chose to start anew - not my problem you haven’t changed a bit.“
… He felt a gust of hot air on his face... there was smoke and ember glow of fiery beasts raging around him… he was scrambling for his dear life, climbing the pile of forgotten rubbish, when he saw a hand outstretched in front of him, promising safety and forgiveness…
“He was a security detail on my probation… I have noticed his hungry looks so I had to do something... and having a person on the inside is very useful.”
And then he felt somebody jumping on the bed and grabbing him in a bear hug. A dark-haired head with glasses and a stupid wide Gryffindor smile was assaulting him with kisses on any available parts that were not protected by the blanket and his pajamas.
“Mr. Malfoy, I assume you were informed about your release,” the man continued after casting an obscene amount of privacy spells at the door. “ There are certain conditions that need to be discussed immediately. I received a curious memory from Miss Granger she claims to acquire from you. The information you possess is beyond sensitive and it should not be spread around lightly.”
“And when I was at that concert... nobody would’ve known about me playing there until your arse was there and so were the reporters! Can’t you see that every time you’re trying to help it just costs me and my family! You stalled the trials and my father was murdered by the vengeful Auror because we didn’t get what we deserved!” he was screaming, angry tears spilling from his eyes, and fists clenched ready for a punch. “You fucked with my memories… you could just let me rot in Azkaban, but no, you had to go there and be a bloody knight in shining armor! I am not your little project, Potter! You need to stop!”
She moved her hand away slowly, her fingers trailing briefly over the burn on Harry’s palm. It was the last remainder he had of Draco. His silver cigarette case had left a mark on Harry’s skin when he carelessly touched it with his bare hands. Kawahara was right. The Aurors were taught to be observant, and if she had noticed that scar, others would soon start asking questions, too.
“Ahem,” the coroner made an audible cough, still standing at the threshold and not making any moves to get out of the sun and into the shade of the funeral home.
“But…” girl Weasley looked like she was about to burst into tears and Draco thought it would be a good idea to make his exit now.
“Narcissa, we came as soon as we heard,” she said looking at his mother sympathetically. “I couldn’t leave Teddy alone, so Vernon, his babysitter is here as well. I hope you don’t mind?”
“My love, you are finally home,” Narcissa whispered, kissing his forehead and steering him towards the front door.
He had hurt everyone, who was important in his life. Hermione wasn’t speaking to him, Ron was trying his best to bridge that rift, but it was rough. And then Sirius, how could he stop loving his godfather because he was queer, how could he go down that road, feeling selfishly upset about the things he had no say in, about the past Sirius had never shared with him.
"I apologize, but the DMLE is off limits for now. Not to provoke any more unnecessary investigations."Draco shook his head.
“You know, this is not how it works. It’s not a murder, Harry,” she said probably in the umpteenth time, “Narcissa Malfoy had identified the body and they found the hawthorn wand next to him. I am afraid, that was enough to confirm that it was indeed Draco.”
“What’s the fun in that? Since you’ve brought company... maybe you should share an enlightening tale of how you’ve drugged Potter to his best friend?” Nott asked triumphantly.
But he hid it, he denied it, he waved off concerns Draco had for him, and then Malfoy disappeared because he couldn’t stand Harry being so dishonest and reckless. Draco probably thought that Harry was this selfless hero that could do no wrong and he had tried his best to change his views and his preconceived beliefs to be with Harry. But in the end, Harry was the one to betray him, with his lies.
