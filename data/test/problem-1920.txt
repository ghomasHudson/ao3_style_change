Harry sees the split second of emotions flickering across Draco’s face, before he schools it into a mask of indifference. Lucius doesn’t move a single muscle.
“Because we ‘ave our orders. ‘Sides, we have to wait for lots of ‘em to be in the same place at once! We can’t just waltz down Diagon Alley and start nicking magic. We won’ get enough before we get caught.”
The elf puts her hands on Draco’s leg and closes her eyes. She starts humming to herself, and the air fills with a beautiful glowing light, almost like the gentle spring sun outside. When he risks a look at the wound, the flow of blood has stilled to a quiet oozing.
Hermione rolls her eyes at him, but she’s smiling. Harry can feel his own answering grin in the way his cheeks are starting to ache.
And that’s…almost noble. And overbearing as fuck. Also a bit daft, since Hermione is really good at breaking curses. On the other hand, she’s not a trained Auror, and she’s got more than enough to think about right now.
The Floo flashes, and Hermione steps out of the fireplace. She looks ten years older than she did a week ago. There are dark smudges under her eyes, and her hair has escaped from her usually neat bun and is framing her face in a frizzy mess of curls, but she still manages a small smile when she catches sight of him.
“I’m going to talk to Draco tomorrow. Ron said he’d told you he might be able to find out more about the cup. Do you want to come?”
“Probably…” He smiles, relieved at the change of topic. “Where is Hermione? I’d like her to view the memory.”
“Yes?” The man who opens the door is short and stocky. And a bit too familiar, he realises with a surge of disappointment. He’s standing in front of the guard who was so nasty to Draco, when they went to interview his father. Bugger! This bloke didn’t seem to like him all that much, when he first met him. He should probably let Ron do the talking.
Williamson’s voluminous belly sweeps his notepad off the table as he climbs to his feet. He’s got a cold and boring night ahead of him, and he doesn’t bother hiding his scowl. Someone snickers, but is cut off abruptly by Savage’s next bark of names.
He nods, dumbfounded. How the fuck does Ron know if Bludger’s here?  But then again, Ron’s usually right.
“Yeah. We’ll probably have to wait. Whatever it is that she’s doing with Malfoy and all the mud, she’s not doing it inside the ministry. She was able to tell me that much.”
“Maybe you don’t. Have you thought about bringing in an expert? Someone who knows about ancient artefacts.”
“Harry? Are you listening?” Hermione sounds like she’s been trying to get his attention for a while.
“Do you think you can do it on your own, or should I ask Savage to bring in a curse-breaker?” Harry asks.
“It’s been a while. I try to keep in touch, but he spends most of his time at the pub with his Quidditch mates, these days.” Mr Brigg takes a sip of his tea. “I haven’t seen him much since Christmas.”
“Thank you Mr Brigg. Please contact us, if you hear from your brother at all.” Ron offers him an Auror Department business card.
"That too." She waves a hand, as if wading through mud is a perfectly normal part of the job as an Unspeakable. Maybe it is. It’s not like he really knows anything about Unspeakables.
“No she’s not. Remember that howler I told you about? The one Mum sent to Percy in the middle of a Cabinet meeting? This is all about me, mate.”
“Hermione was brilliant! We thought we were going to need you to try and revive your Parseltongue skills for the snakey bits. But Hermione managed with a Translation Charm instead. The incantation was really complicated and it was written in some kind of code, so she had to translate it as she went along. But she did it! I can do magic again!”
Malfoy doesn’t look like he’ll be fine. He looks more like he’ll crumble into a heap, if he’s left alone. Is that what he wants? To be left alone so Harry won’t see him falling apart? So no one sees him falling apart?
Donovan smirks. “Going to gloat a bit at your old school rival? Can’t say I blame you. That Malfoy’s a stuck up little faggot.”
The DMLE is quiet when Harry steps out of the lift and makes his way down the hall to his cubicle. Donovan sneers at him from his usual place slouched against the wall next to the small tea kitchen.
Ron is walking a little more securely in his heels this time, and Harry has to walk quickly under the cloak to keep up with him. When they slip into the Beheaded Goblin, and Bludger smiles and pats the empty stool next to him in invitation. He even goes as far as buying Ron a pint. Ron bats long black eyelashes at him, tosses back a curtain of dark hair and dimples prettily. He even puts a hand on Bludger’s shoulder and leans in to whisper something in his ear. Bludger’s eyes immediately drop to Ron’s cleavage. Harry shudders and flattens himself against the wall, waiting for Ron to get some useful information so they can get out of here. It takes forever. Or at least long enough for Harry’s foot to start cramping. But, finally, one of Bludger’s mates gets up from his seat and says goodbye.
I am sorry to inconvenience you at this late hour. I am writing to you on behalf of my son, since I understand that you are on friendly terms. I will be brief. Draco needs your help. He has been taken into Auror custody, on suspicion of Death Eater activity. He is being held in the Ministry for the time being. Please, Mr Potter. I urge you to help him, if you are in any way capable.
Malfoy is still an arrogant prick, Harry thinks. But he can’t help admiring the way his shoulders stretch the fabric of his wooly jumper, when he turns his back on them and starts putting his boots back on.
Nothing happens. Bludger frowns at his wand, then holds it up and shakes it. Harry has to make a conscious effort not to roll his eyes. Time is running out quickly, and the stupid git can’t even pronounce a basic charm.
“Oh, Harry! Let me fix it for you.” Hermione grabs his chin in one strong hand and tilts his head up.
Draco glares right back. “That’s not what I meant, Weasley! It’s not true that you can’t help. You’ll be living here, right? I’m sure your in-laws have a computer you can use. Go on the internet and search for things about ancient chalices and snakes and magic. You’ll find lots of crap, but you might find something useful too.”
Lucius is quiet for a few seconds. "Why would you need my help with that, Mr Potter? Draco is a leading expert on ancient artefacts, is he not? And I imagine you have the collective resources of the Ministry at your disposal, by virtue of your... previous accomplishments.” He shrugs, and the motion makes the heavy iron chains that bind his wrists rattle. Even Lucius himself seems surprised by the sound. “No matter what the reason is, I can't help you unless you are quite a bit more specific." He concludes.
“I’ll help, if you need it,” Hermione cuts in quietly. “Your mother was perfectly polite to me that one time we met in Madame Malkins last year, and… Just tell me if you need any help.” She bites her lip.
“I think it’ll be easier to just show you.” He smiles at Draco. “That’s the favour I wanted to ask you. Do you think we could use your Pensieve again? It’ll be so much easier than getting clearance for the one in Mysteries.”
“The Mad Muggle?!? I suppose it’s best if I don’t ask.” he says, once he’s regained a bit of control.
Bludger is not an easy person to find. He’s not in the Beheaded Goblin when Harry and Ron go there on Sunday afternoon, disguised as a couple of middle aged Quidditch fans. They spend most of Monday and Tuesday reading through old cases, seeing if there’s any mention of the New Dawn or a chalice classified as a dark artefact. They come up with nothing, and in the afternoons they take Polyjuice and go to the pub. On Wednesday, Ron comes up with a slightly different plan. He thinks that the regulars at the pub might be getting suspicious of all the different newcomers, so instead of going in as a couple of blokes, he persuades the DMLE receptionist to donate one of her hairs, and asks Harry to wear his cloak. Perhaps a single girl will seem less suspicious.
He pours a bowl of cornflakes and sniffs tentatively at the milk bottle. It’s still fresh enough, so he gets a spoon out and carries his meal back into the sitting room to eat it in front of the telly. When he turns it on, all he can find is Top Gear, and he almost laughs out loud at his own expense. Watching Top Gear in his boxers while eating corn flakes for dinner? Pathetic! Draco would be appalled. Or not. He’d probably think of it as a fascinating anthropological experience… or put a stop to the madness by getting Harry out of his boxers as quickly as possible. He closes his eyes and imagines Draco standing in front of him, grey eyes light with laughter and a smirk playing on his lips. What would he say if he saw him like this? Probably something along the lines of ‘Take those saggy things off. And for God’s sake, don’t eat your cereal on the sofa, you complete savage! I have a better use for that pretty mouth of yours.’ And Harry would run his hands over hard thighs covered in soft cashmere, before unzipping–wait, no–unbuttoning Draco’s trousers and taking his cock into his mouth. They wouldn’t stay there for long, of course. Draco would pull him up and drag him to the bedroom and they’d end up fucking on top of the covers because pulling them down would be too much trouble. He opens his eyes again, and strokes his half hard cock. What he needs is a long, hot shower and a wank.
He hits the ground almost running, and flushes himself into the atrium, not bothering to close the door to the stall.
“The Chalice. We should drop it into the ocean.” Draco’s gaze is challenging, but absolutely sincere. And Harry can’t really say that he disagrees. Except...
“Hermione is planning to kidnap you.” Ron is leaning close enough for their conversation to remain private. “She says we need to take you out clubbing. To get your mind off things, she said. She’s taking Rose to spend the night at Ginny and Neville’s. Just thought I’d warn you.”
The hot water runs down his back, drumming against his skin and relieving the tension from his exhausting day. It makes the tiny cuts on his hands sting, but he really doesn’t care. It’s a small price to pay for the luxury of washing the grime away. He closes his eyes again, and imagines the small river of hot water trailing down his spine is Draco’s tongue. He grabs his cock and groans at the feeling of the hot water and the pressure from his fist, as he strokes himself. Images of Draco flash behind his closed eyelids. Draco pressing him back into the cushions and holding him there, taking what he needed and pushing it all back into Harry with his body and his words. Draco gasping and shuddering above him, coming with his arse clamped around his cock. Draco letting him hold him after, when they were both tired and spent. He gasps Draco’s name as he comes.
The interior of the Beheaded Goblin is similar to any other shady sports pub. The floor is a little sticky from spilled beer, and there’s a loud Quidditch transmission on the Wireless in the corner. The barkeep is wiping down the counter with a dirty rag. A few regulars are nursing pints of cheap lager. Ron slides onto one of the bar stools and his tight skirt hitches up a little higher than appropriate. One of the regulars turns and smiles at him. He's missing one of his front teeth.
“Yes, well. To be honest, I’m not so sure about that. It seems my presence was more of a provocation than I’d expected.”
"Thank you." Harry turns to Smith and lays the signed permit in front of him on the table. "Zacharias Smith, this is a signed permit from the Under Secretary to the Minister for Magic. It authorises me to administer up to ten drops of Veritaserum without your consent. You do have the option to agree to take the potion voluntarily."
"About the case... I've been meaning to ask you about a spell for sorting out ripped-up books. Ron said you might know one?"
“No, Ma’am. You don’t. Do I still have permission to have Hermione and Draco help me with the case? On an... erm… consulting level?”
“Maybe we should get some sleep first?” Hermione suggests. “Breaking curses and dismantling wards requires a lot of focus, and we’re not exactly well rested…”
Harry quickly snatches his hand back. Malfoy is standing in the doorway, looking distractingly different from his old self. Harry suspects he should have anticipated it after yesterday, but this Malfoy, with his small smile, windswept hair, sturdy khaki trousers and black, woolly turtleneck will take some time to get used to.
“You can go ahead and use the Floo now,” Harry says. “Officer Davies will escort you. But please don’t touch anything on the way.”
“Stop trying to Divine what she’s doing from the patterns in your beer foam, mate! Hermione’s brilliant. She’s been able to handle Malfoy since third year, remember?”
Smith sends him another disgusted glare. The he nods sullenly. When Davies approaches with the vial, he opens his mouth enough that ten drops of the potion can be put on his tongue.
“He wants to make an impression?!?” Ron explodes. “That bloody fucking idiot wanker can stick his precious fucking election so far up his arse he'll be puking ballots!”
“The sunrise?” Ron frowns. “That sounds like nonsense. Unless… wait a minute. Do you remember last month? That crazy, drunk bugger we helped Davies haul in for harassing a Muggleborn! Howard. He kept babbling about a new dawn and how the new dawn would solve all our problems. I thought he was just pissed, but what if that’s actually a thing? The New Dawn?”
He’s finally closing his hand around the small bag, when there’s a warm hand on his shoulder. He allows himself to lean into Draco’s touch for just a moment, before turning around.
“Why did you bring him here, then? He should be at St. Mungo’s!” This time Ron’s questions are posed right over his head, to Draco.
“Yeah, right,” Matt says. He’s got his hand in his pocket, and Harry can see the outline of his fist as he grips his wand. “Did you nick her face too?”
“Barging into the shed… Thinking that Smith was Malfoy...” Harry trails off. What does Ron think he’s talking about? Does he even remember what happened?
Dinner is a quiet affair. Ron keeps reaching for his wand. To set the table. To clean up when Rosie knocks her glass over. To send the dishes back to the sink. Hermione’s clearly noticed too, because she seems to be developing duelling-speed reactions to everything that might require a spot of magic. By the time they’ve finished their pudding, Ron is silently fuming, Hermione is biting her lip nervously, and Harry is busy entertaining Rose, trying to keep her from noticing her parents glaring at each other.
The Auror department is even more deserted. Donovan must have been the last one to leave. The only sound is the faint background noise filtering in from the DMLE and the ticking clock over the door to the conference room. Even the air freshening charms have been suspended for the night, and the office smells faintly of tea and dusty case files. He contemplates casting a locking charm on the door, but the DMLE officers don’t have clearance to come in here without an Auror present. Besides, it’s not like he’s doing anything wrong. It’s his case, after all. He just really hopes that Donovan has finished up the paperwork and put it in the case file before he left, but knowing Donovan, he probably hasn’t. He Summons the case, and leafs through the papers, but there are no arrest papers. What a lazy sod! Donovan’s desk is empty except for a notepad and a couple of half empty mugs. What the fuck has made him arrest Draco, then? He picks the case file back up and looks at the paperwork more thoroughly. The last thing added is the transcript of Donovan and his partner’s questioning of Jamie Cadogan. He skims through the part where Cadogan is informed about the conditions of the interview, given Veritaserum and asked to state his name and address, and the part where he admits to being at Kitty Tor. He already knows everything in here. It isn’t until page three that he finds what he’s looking for.
Cold numbness spreads through Harry’s body and settles like a lump of ice in the pit of his stomach. He starts to pull away, but Draco stops him with a hand on his chest.
Draco shakes his head. “It’s fine. Some minor damage to the base, but I managed to contain it with a few sponges and a bucket, and Martin can clean up the rest of the mess tomorrow, since he’s the one who started it.” He casts a Cleaning Charm on his muddy trousers. Then he pulls out the offered chair and busies himself pouring milk and tea and stirring in an obscene amount of sugar. Finally, he looks up.
He looks up into the stand, and finds a sea of red. It’s probably a bad idea to go up there. He had a chance to review Jamie Cadogan’s file this morning, and he’s been in his fair share of fights with fans of other teams.
He feels Draco’s hand press against his back for a fraction of a second, and thinks he hears a whispered ‘be careful’. But over the noise of the stadium, it might just be wishful thinking.
“It’s a dark artefact,” Harry says. “It’s supposed to be very powerful. Something that can steal people’s magic and store it.”
“Find it. Bring it to me. This is your last chance of earning my forgiveness. If you do not bring me the cup, your weakness and cowardice will be punished.”
“Yes.” Malfoy shakes his head and his gaze locks with Harry’s. “Yes, I think it’s real. The only problem is that it hasn’t been seen for centuries. The Dark Lord was looking for it, at some point. I don’t think he got very far.” He’s frowning again. “I think my father helped him investigate, actually.”
“It doesn’t really mean anything…” he hedges. “I mean… It just means that they haven’t done that particular spell before.”
“Oh,” Draco says faintly. He walks back to the bench and sits down, resting his elbows on his knees, and cradling his head in his hands. “Are you? Able to help me?”
“You’re right. She really doesn’t.” He sinks down into the chair Ron was sitting in before. “I’ll wait out here. Thank you.”
The blush starts below his collar, but he can feel the heat creeping onto his face. What is it about these Malfoys that make them get under his skin like this? He grits his teeth.
Ron is already making his way towards the pub. He’s wobbling slightly in his unfamiliar tight skirt and heels, and Harry takes a moment to be grateful that he’s invisible so Ron won’t see his smirk. He hurries to catch up and slips through the door with Ron.
“Don’t worry about me, Potter. I’ll be perfectly fine. It might be best if I calm down a bit before I go home, though. It wouldn’t be fair to Mother if she saw me this unsettled...”
Draco's mouth is sliding down his throat now. Kissing, licking, nipping. The small, playful bites are just hard enough to send jolts of pleasure and pain straight to his cock. He turns his head to give Draco better access to the soft skin over his collarbone, and lets his lips brush over a slender wrist, tasting the salty skin there. Draco's mouth stills and his body goes rigid. Harry opens his eyes and there it is, only centimetres from his face. The blurred smudge of the Mark is so close it doesn’t even form a recognisable picture. Draco's breath is coming in quick, shallow huffs. Harry leans in and very deliberately kisses the scarred skin. He can feel Draco tensing up even more, and then relaxing. He turns his head and kisses Draco's other wrist, and he feels more than hears him exhale a long, shuddering sigh. Draco’s hands tighten on his wrists, a warning to keep them where they are. He closes his eyes and gives in to the sensations Draco chooses to give him. Everything quickly becomes a blur of hot and sticky and more-yes-please-oh-fuck-now! until somehow he’s naked on his back with a pillow shoved under his arse, and he’s moaning as Draco sinks down on his cock. The tight heat makes him gasp, and Draco leans down and covers his mouth in a rough kiss.
"Of course, no one can blame you if you just happen to be at the right place at the right time, while you scout out the premises..."
He nods, even though they’re so close under the Cloak, that he’s not sure if Draco and Hermione will see. Draco presses his hand against the small of his back, and he allows himself to lean into the touch for a few seconds. Then he slips away from the relative safety of the Cloak again, and makes his way towards the sound of voices.
“Yeah. Or maybe we’ll continue with the murder case.” Harry pushes his chair back and gets up. “Only one way to find out.”
There’s a rap on the partition and Hermione peeks around the corner. She’s a little muddy and windswept, and she’s smiling. She tucks a strand of hair behind her ear and apologises for the interruption.
“Yes. Many years ago. Men in robes and masks came and asked about the book, and Mistress told them she didn’t know. And when they left, she told Blimpy they were not worthy and should leave us alone.”
The whole stadium errupts in shouts and gasps, and Harry turns his head to the game. The Tornadoes beaters have just performed a stunning  Dopplebeater Defence, and Harry finds himself cheering and shouting without having to act at all. The bludger zooms towards one of the Wanderers beaters, who has his back turned, following the trajectory of the two seekers, as they fly side by side towards one end of the stadium. He gasps as the ball speeds towards  the oblivious man, but just as Harry is about to close his eyes to avoid having to watch the man’s skull split open, he turns and avoids it by a last second Sloth Grip Roll.
The game ends almost an hour later, when Shannon finally catches the snitch, and the Tornadoes win 260-190. They make their way back across the moor with the other fans, lagers in hand and singing… well, more like shouting, but that might be better, because Harry doesn’t know all the words.
He grabs a handful of Floo powder and is gone in a shower of sparks, before Harry has the time to answer. “Bye,” he mumbles to the brightly glowing embers. Then he takes his own handful of powder, steps into the fire and calls out his destination.
“I have information that I want to share with you. All of you. And I sort of need to ask you a favour. But please, come back to my flat with me after. I can’t focus on anything, when all I can think of is getting you out of those clothes and into my bed.”
“If you’re not sure, we can wait,” Harry says. He sits on the bed next to Draco, his hand resting on Draco’s back. “You don’t have to do this today.”
But the good memories get clouded by the horrible ones. He remembers all the times he yelled at Vincent when he did something wrong in Draco’s eyes. And how he ignored his friends in sixth year because he didn’t think he could trust them, that they wouldn’t have understood that he had to do it, to save his mother. And the fire. Draco will never be able to forget the fire. Or the sight of horror on Vincent’s face when he slipped from Draco’s hand and fell into the flames.
I could hear the Basilisk’s heavy body slithering across the floor. I kept my eyes shut and began to run blindly sideways, keeping my hands stretched out. Voldemort was laughing when I tripped. Something heavy hit me then and I was smashed into a wall. I was sure the next thing I would feel were some fangs biting me and killing me. But that never happened. I could hear mad hissing and something thrashing wildly off the pillars. And I couldn’t help myself; I had to take a look. And you will never believe what I saw. Fawkes had punctured the Basilisks eyes.
That night we also had Astronomy at midnight. And then on Wednesday, we had History of Magic and Herbology. And this morning started with our Defence Against the Dark Arts exam, where we had to take an obstacle course that contained a Grindylow, Red Caps, a Hinkypunk and a Boggart. Draco was allowed to skip the Boggart. I think Professor Lupin was afraid of a repeat of the lesson we had at the beginning of the year when Draco’s Boggart turned into my dead body.
“That she loves your dad and all his questions every time she comes to visit you,” Neville jokes. Harry has to hold in his laugh and hides his mouth behind his hand. He hasn’t forgotten the last letter he received from Hermione this summer holiday. Her worries about Pettigrew’s escape and then all the complaints about Mister Weasley and the million questions Hermione had to answer during her week at the Weasley household.
The car wasn’t that happy with us and kicked us out of the car as soon as it was safe and drove off into the forbidden forest. Hedwig’s cage flew through the air and burst open, making Hedwig rise out of it with an angry screech, before she sped off toward the castle without a backward look. She’s still angry with me, won’t let me give her treats at all. Hermione is making sure she’s okay, but I kind of miss my owl.
Harry shakes his head and then sits down. “Sorry, it’s just,” he says before he falls silent. He can’t do this. Malfoy is his friend and once Harry utters the words that have been roaming inside his head for the last couple of months he won’t be any longer.
The nightmares are getting worse, by the way. The ones with Draco disappearing. They wake me up almost every night now. And I just have to get up and check that Draco is still in his bed. It just feels so real, the dreams. They scare me, dad. Do you think it’s a bad omen? Should I be worried, or is it just because I’ve lost him? Am I dreaming him disappearing because he doesn’t like me anymore? Because he hates me now?
“I’m sure he will explain. Now hurry up, we don’t have all day,” the professor snaps. It seems he’s in a bad mood again and even though Draco wants to ask a million more questions, he knows when to keep his mouth shut around his head of house.
Harry lowers his arm and lets his wand slip out of his fingers. The wand falls on the floor and rolls towards Pettigrew and Draco. Harry swallows as Pettigrew points his wand towards Harry again. There is nothing left that Harry can do to save his own life. He’s defenceless and lost.
“Then we have multiple options. We could wait for Draco’s body to expel of the dead foetus by itself. We only don’t know how long this will take. He could have a natural miscarriage in a few days, but it can also take weeks before it starts.”
But I will get to that because after Hagrid had come in he made a knot in uncle Vernon’s rifle and then he gave me a birthday cake. It was the first cake I ever had; at least that I can remember. I’m sure you would have made me a birthday cake for my first birthday. Hagrid turned on the fire and made tea and sausages. I didn’t really know who he was and why he was there so I asked. He got very angry at uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia. I was very confused. Hagrid said you were famous, that I was famous and he talked about our world until he realized I really didn’t know. He screamed at uncle Vernon some more and uncle Vernon forbade him to tell me. But he didn’t listen and told me I’m a wizard and gave me my letter. It was a letter to inform me that I have been accepted at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Then Hagrid sends out an owl to a Professor Dumbledore before uncle Vernon told him I wasn’t going. That’s when I found out they had known all along that I was a wizard. Aunt Petunia started screaming about you, mom, and that you ran off with dad and then got yourselves blown up. I got angry then; they always told me that you had died in a car crash. Hagrid also got very angry, saying that it was an outrage. So I asked him what had happened. He became very nervous but told me about the wizard who went bad, named Voldemort. And that this wizard was becoming very powerful. And Hagrid told me that when Voldemort came after you ten years ago on Halloween, he killed you both and tried to kill me. But that I lived and that is why I have the lighting scar on my forehead. It made me very sad. Hagrid said that Voldemort is probably still out there somewhere, without his powers. I hope he’s wrong and that the evil man is dead.
Harry leans against Lily and closes his eyes. He hates the butterflies in his stomach. If he can’t keep them in check, he might lose Draco for good. “I don’t think he’s gay,” Harry confesses.
Speaking of Draco, he still isn’t back, so I think I’ll go look for him to tell him what happened during my Deviation exam.
On Wednesday, the day before our flying lesson I talked about it with Hermione. We still are spending every afternoon together in the library, doing our homework. She’s the only person talking to me. I’ve been afraid to spend more time with most of the Gryffindor’s because I’m afraid Nott will hurt me. I think Ron is disappointed that I’m ignoring him, but I don’t want him to get hurt because of me. And when Nott or Malfoy make fun of me in class, he laughs just like the others. So, I’m also not sure if he would be a good friend to me. Hermione is the only one that won’t laugh. She just looks very angry every time something happens.
Post the first morning at Hogwarts was strange. Usually, it’s Draco that gets post. His mom always sends him care packages filled with sweets and cakes. At least she did for the last three years. But on our first day, there was no post for Draco, not even a letter to explain why his mother hadn’t sent him any sweets. But there was post for me, the one than never got any letters. Sirius writes to me often and it’s nice to read about his efforts to further fix up our house. He said Remus has brought him a box filled with old photos from when they went to Hogwarts and he looks forward to showing them to me. He even included a photo of you two smiling at each other as teenagers. I put the photo up on the wall next to my bed, next to the drawing of me and Draco that hangs there.
Harry laughs through his tears. “I’ll try. But not on this. I won’t let him hurt Neville or Iris. I promise I’ll keep them safe at school. You won’t have to worry about us.”
Harry grabs the frame and puts it down. His heart aches just to look at it. A small tear falls from his eye and he wipes it away in haste. He won’t cry. Draco isn’t worth it.
Harry swallows and plays with the whisk. "Yeah, he's…" Harry wavers, the word that just popped into his head scares him. The last time Harry saw a depressed Draco was when Draco was fighting his potion addiction.
This Saturday there was another Quidditch match. It was Gryffindor against Hufflepuff. I went to watch with my friends and even wore the Gryffindor tie, just to support them a little. I didn’t go all the way and pulled my green jumper on as well. Gryffindor could overtake Slytherin in the house championship if they would win this match, so I kind of hoped they would lose. Ron and Neville complained that it was unfair that Snape was the referee for the match because he would be biased, him being the head of house of Slytherin. Professor Snape scares me; I think he might even be able to read minds. He’s been extra horrible to me in Potions, blaming me when Malfoy makes a mistake. And I keep running into him wherever I go. Maybe he knows that I know that he wants to steal the Sorcerer’s Stone.
The girls start laughing again. Harry considers hexing them, but that won’t help him find Neville. “What’s so funny,” he snaps. “I need to find him.”
“I know,” he says instead. “About all that. It isn’t like you said. I don’t do like boys and girls. It’s just boys. Only boys,” Harry stammers.
Harry is rooted to his spot as Draco turns and walks away from him. The spinning motion of the word ‘ever’ was clearly there. It wasn’t a mix-up, it was deliberate. It’s not just now. Draco never wants to talk to Harry again. The sausage from that morning tries to come up again as Harry stares at the hallway Draco disappeared in. The colour drains from his face and then he hunches over.
I was more impressed by the Durmstrang group. They arrived in a ship that rose out of the water. Their headmaster is professor Karkaroff. Draco knows who he is. I’ll tell you about him just now. He has a goatee that finishes into a small curl. I think it looks ridiculous. But that was not the great part. Among the students of Durmstrang is a very special person, namely Victor Krum, the star Quidditch player from Bulgaria. And to our great pleasure, he sat down in Great Hall right next to our little group. Draco told him we’d seen him at the World Cup and that it is an honour to have him at our school. Krum was very kind and thanked Draco for his compliment. And then Greg said he’d love to see a Seeker game between me and Krum, but Krum kindly declined, saying something like he was only here to compete in the TriWizard tournament, and not to play Quidditch.
“I’m fine,” Harry says and turns his back to his brother. He can’t look at him and see the pity on his face. It will make it all real.
Dinner is a silent affair. Teddy looks between Draco and Harry and hardly eats any of his food. Just like Draco and Harry. Most of the food containers end up in the fridge for another day. Harry takes Teddy upstairs to get him ready for bed. Draco lets him. It’s easier that way. Draco shouldn’t be allowed to look after the boy at all. He should be in jail, locked away for life for his crimes. But no, the Saviour had given a good word for him during his trial, and Draco was let off with a year's probation at Hogwarts. And that was hardly a punishment, as it was the year he and Harry had fallen in love and Draco had started to believe that he could be happy.
Draco smiled and looked back at the potion. He would have loved to have seen how the potion works. For a moment he was tempted to get a spoon and feed it to the man in the cell. But then his father and mother would know he’d been down into the forbidden rooms. Draco let it be and made sure he would follow his father down when he would continue his work.
It was horrible. Professor Lockhart thought he was doing me a favour by letting me do my detention with him. I had to address the envelopes while professor Lockhart just went on about his fans, his fame and his books. Oh, he thinks he’s amazing because he’s won Witch Weekly Smile award for many years in a row. And I know he looks good, but he’s not that beautiful. He’s got nothing on Draco. But that doesn’t stop all the girl in school to gloss over him.
“I’ll be back in about an hour. I can bring home some Indian take-out. Maybe watch a movie and make it a romantic night,” Harry says.
It was only when Black returned to us that I learnt that Pettigrew had also stunned Snape and had escaped. It seems that Professor Trelawney her prediction came true. The servant is on his way back to the Dark Lord.
And then it happened. A high, cold voice said ‘kill the spare’. The words Avada Kedavra sounded. A green light flashed by me and then Cedric fell to the ground. As he was holding me up I fell with him. I landed on top of his body. I looked into his face and couldn’t believe it. His grey eyes blank and expressionless, his mouth was half-open like he was surprised. He was dead.
The week drags by. Draco hides in his room as often as he can, warding it to keep others out. He cries himself to sleep on most nights. The knowledge that he’ll be on his way back to Hogwarts tomorrow helps him get up now to join the others for dinner. It’s the only meal of the day he can’t skip. The only time he needs to show his face and take his place on the left side of the Dark Lord. Bellatrix holds the seat to his right. She’s still his most loyal servant. And just as crazy as the Dark Lord himself.
Zabini sits down next to Ginny and signs. “You are a fool if you think Draco had anything to do with that engagement. His parents arranged it all, in the hope he will come to his senses.”
Harry looks at the steps of the main entrance of Hogwarts. The Christmas holiday had sped by in no time. And the long train ride back to Hogsmeade had never gone this fast. Harry drags towards the stairs in front of him. He doesn’t want to go back inside and have to say goodbye to Draco. His fingers are cold and he has a sour taste in his mouth.
“I’m sure of it. Even more beautiful than Rose. Just because he would have had your beautiful grey eyes staring back at us,” Harry tells him.
Then we were moved to a differed memory. This one was the trial of Ludo Bagman. He was found guilty for passing information to Lord Voldemort’s supporters. Mr Crouch wanted to send him to Azkaban, but the crowd protested and they brought it to a vote. Nobody voted for imprisonment, they even complimented him on his win with Quidditch. Draco muttered that it was a disgrace, that Mr Bagman got away with his crimes just because he was a famous Quidditch player. I told Draco he could do the same once he became the star player for the English team. But Draco answered that he would never help the Dark Lord and therefore would never need to be acquitted.
“It’s okay, sweetheart,” Harry says. He’s knelt in front of Draco’s chair, and his hands hold Draco’s arms. Draco has no idea when Harry moved around the bed to comfort him.
“Can I borrow your book?” Neville asks on Saturday. “I’ve seen a small snake in the greenhouse and I just want to make sure it won’t hurt the plants.”
A familiar voice snaps Harry out of his thoughts. Malfoy walks by with Parkinson on his arm. Harry follows him with his eyes until he’s out of sight. He looks good in his black velvet dress robes and his hair falling over the high collar. He’s talking to Parkinson who laughs and Harry wants to punch her. She’s so annoying. The perfect little pureblood bride for Malfoy.
When they were all getting ready to go, Draco gave me a long kiss goodbye and promised that he would bring back lots of sweets from Honeydukes. Greg yelled at us to stop being so pathetic and that we can snug again when they come back in time for the feast. And we both knew he was right, but still, I’m so used to always be around Draco that it was weird saying goodbye to him.
It was Professor McGonagall that stopped him in the end. She came into the hall, took one look at the scene and asked professor Moody if the ferret was a student. When he said yes, she took out her wand and turned Draco back to himself. He fell to the floor, his braided hair all messed up and his face pink and filled with tears. I don’t really know what happened next with the professors, I just hurried towards Draco and took him in my arms and told him I love him and that I was sorry. He said he was sorry too and we kissed briefly. Then Moody appeared next to us and told Draco that he would keep an eye on Draco, that he should tell his father that he’s keeping an eye on his son and that next time he tried to hurt me he won’t get off this easy.
Harry stares at the empty space where Draco and his dad just stood. It’s done more often, people Apparating from the station. But this seemed a little over the top.
James nods. Harry thinks about it. He wants to take Draco. He would love it. He likes Quidditch. If only he could come. Harry’s mood drops. He won’t be able to take Draco. Draco’s parents won’t let him.
Oh, I also need to tell you about the strange thing that happened when I was looking at the teacher's table. Professor Quirrell was talking to a teacher with greasy black hair, a hooked nose and sallow skin. When that teacher looked into my eyes, a sharp, hot pain shot across my scar. I couldn’t help to respond to the pain and clapped my hand against my head. Of course, that was just another thing Malfoy made fun off. He said: ‘Your little scar hurting you, potty?’ I just looked at the table and tried not to cry. Why do they have to be so mean to me?
I turned back around the corner and took off the cloak and pushed it into my bag before I walked up to them. Hermione asked me if I brought the cloak so we could sneak around Peeves and Ron looked very excited about it. And then I realized that Hermione most have told Ron about the cloak. It was a secret and she told him. Are all my friends going to betray me? First Draco wanted to stop me and now Hermione had shared my secret with someone else. I was very angry at her at that moment, but there was nothing to do about it then, so I took out my cloak and we put it on. It is big enough to cover all three of us and we walked very slowly up the stairs.
I also told Hermione about hearing Malfoy cry the night before. She didn’t know what to think of it either. I just know that he didn’t come out of the dorm all of Sunday and that for the last two days he hasn’t said a word to me. He won’t even look at me, which is weird after all the staring of the last couple of months. And he looks a little pale and doesn’t sit next to Nott anymore, but has started preferring Zabini in class and in the Great Hall. I think Malfoy and Nott might have had a fight about something. It’s frustrating not knowing what about and if it has something to do with me giving Malfoy a black eye. He didn’t get that healed at the hospital wing, which is also strange. I don’t understand why he wants to walk around school with a black eye when it’s not necessary.
Harry groans and rests his head in his hands. He hadn’t even though about that yet and he doesn’t want to. He’s got enough problems as it is, with the second task coming up and a crush on a boy that will never love him back. He can’t deal with everyone else knowing on top of that.
In Astronomy, we are learning the different names of the stars and the movements of planets. I like looking at the stars at night, they are fascinating. Ron thinks it’s boring and always says he much rather stay in bed and sleep.
The pregnant man stands up and waves his hand towards Draco and Harry. “If you think those are faces of people that are happy and expecting, I wonder what you do at the Auror office because if you’re responsible for solving crimes, every criminal will get away with it.”
“Not sure if that’s ever happening,” Neville says. “Fred and George said she might be gay. And I’ve heard she was spotted kissing Luna the other day.”
When we came out of the tunnel Snape and Neville just arrived at the Whomping Willow. Professor Snape pointed his wand at Black right away and said he knew that Lupin would help him, that Dumbledore should have listened to him. Lupin tried to explain, but Snape wouldn’t listen. It was Draco who calmed down professor Snape and convinced him that it had all been Peter Pettigrew. Snape looked at Pettigrew in surprise and shook his head. Then he turned back to Lupin. It seemed that Lupin hadn’t had his potion yet that evening and Snape was just handing it to him when a cloud shifted and we were all bathed in moonlight.
It seemed like seconds had only passed when we reached the stretch of wall that was the entrance of our common room. Draco waved his wand and once we stepped in, we were greeted by our housemates. Most of them were cheering and applauding. Miles asked me how I did it and Warrington clapped me on the shoulder, saying he wasn’t that upset about not being a champion knowing there was another skilled Slytherin competing. They had food and were ready to party. Nobody believed I didn’t put my own name in and nobody noticed that I didn’t feel like celebrating. Nobody except Draco, who forcefully pulled me down to the dormitories after a short while.
After that things became a bit scary. Riddle asked me how I had defeated him before. He tried to keep me talking, but I knew that the longer it would all take, the more life was slipping from Draco’s body into Riddle. So I told him he was useless, that my muggle-born mother had saved me. Riddles concluded out of that that there was nothing special about me and send for the Basilisk. It came sliding out of the mouth of the statue that had opened wide to make a huge black hole. I shut my eyes and I could feel Fawkes take flight. I was going to die, I was sure of it. If Fawkes would take of what did I have to defend myself with?
“It’s just a stuffed animal,” Draco tells her. “Harry couldn’t help himself when he saw this one. Said it was perfect for his newest godchild.”
Harry swallows. He doesn’t plan to die. He won’t hurt his family in that way. But he has to stop Pettigrew. The rat will take Neville from him if he doesn’t. And maybe even his Uncle Sirius. Pettigrew sure would like to finish what he started there.
Draco would complain from time to time. And then Harry would remind him of all the things Draco had risked when he agreed to become a double agent. How he’d betrayed his own family for the person he loves. How he’d helped Harry find the Horcruxes and saved his life over and over again, until the final battle. How Harry had come back for him. How he’d fought to let others know that Draco was one of the good guys.
“So, pregnancy test, crackers and wine gums,” Harry says. “I’ll take the kids. Not sure if Teddy wants to come along, he’s busy with some elaborate art piece. But that also means he won’t bother you.”
“We have a quiz this afternoon in our common room,” Iris says. “So, I’m going to look up some facts about Hogwarts with Johanna this morning.”
“How do you?” Harry starts. No other words follow. How does Hermione know this? She hasn’t been in the library. Or did she see Harry there and just first wanted to talk to him alone before ratting him out to their friends?
And then Professor Snape pulled Draco and me in a hug. It was the weirdest thing that had happened all night. Professor Snape was hugging us and Ron and Neville were staring at us blankly. I must say I was glad when Professor Snape let go of us. It’s just weird, him hugging us.
That was the moment Professor Snape was suddenly next to me. He took hold of my shoulders and made me look into his eyes. He warned me not to do anything stupid, that it would be for nothing. He again said that Draco was still alive and that I just had to find him. I nodded and started eating the Gillyweed. Professor Snape smiled at me and said that he would not give me detention for stealing the Gillyweed from his office. Later I told him that Dobby had gotten it for me and asked Professor Snape not to take it out on the elf, that he had just wanted to help me and Draco. But at that moment, I didn’t care where the Gillyweed came from.
In that moment professor McGonagall ushers them all towards the doors to make their big entrance. Cedric and Cho lead the way, followed by Fleur and her partner and Krum with Hermione. Harry takes Parvati’s arm and they walk into the great hall. All the other students are already at their tables. Harry scans the room and scrawls when he spots the platinum hair of Malfoy. He doesn’t pay attention to the champions at all. His face is turned towards Parkinson, who is laughing again. Why is she always laughing when Malfoy talks. Surely he can’t be that funny all the time.
When Draco sits back down, he points at himself and then makes this strange movement with his hand. It looks a little like the sign for a dragon, but it’s slightly different. He still opens all his fingers when his fist comes away from his mouth, but instead of that just being it, Malfoy turns his hand around.
It was then that Hagrid came bursting into the office, to defend me, saying it couldn’t have been me since I had been talking to him only seconds before the kid was found. And then the headmaster surprised me by saying that he knew it hadn’t been me. That made Hagrid stop talking and he went back out to wait for the headmaster to finish with me.
I couldn’t sleep, so I took the Daily Prophet that Stan offered me. On the front page was a large photo of Sirius Black, an escaped prisoner. I had also seen him on the Muggle news. It turns out he murdered thirteen people with a single curse twelve years ago. He looked just like a vampire in the picture. Stan saw me looking and told me that Black had been a big supporter of Voldemort. And once Voldemort was gone and he was cornered In the middle of a street he blasted half the street apart, killing one wizard and a dozen Muggles. And after that, he just stood there and laughed, like it was one big joke. It seems that this Black is off his head. And he’s the first one ever to break out of Azkaban.
Harry smacks Neville on the back of his head. “Are you insane,” he says. “Just because he’s in Slytherin doesn’t make him evil incarnate.”
We also ran into Terence Higgs, who introduced us to his parents and told us that he had dropped out of his potions masters studies because he got signed by the Puddlemere United reserve team. I told him Draco was made captain of the team now that Marcus had graduated and Terence said the right man got that job. A little further we saw Adrian and Miles who waved at us while they cooked breakfast for their families.
When he reemerges, the first thing he does is look at Ron. He’s wearing that wet dog expression he always gets after a Pensieve  viewing, and shaking his head to clear his ears of liquid. But other than that, he seems to be fine. He notices Harry’s look and smiles.
One of the MLE officers, Jenkins, comes towards them at a jog. He’s broad and has a very impressive moustache that reminds Harry of Horace Slughorn.
“Draco.” Hermione reaches out and puts a hand on his shoulder. “I don’t think it was worthless,” she says quietly. Draco turns and looks at her tiredly.
But Draco? In a Muggle home? That ought to be interesting! Harry looks at his comfortable but slightly lumpy jumper and jeans combination. A restless, squirmy feeling lodges deep in his guts. No. If he’s going to sit around and talk to Draco like nothing has happened, he should probably at least wear something that doesn’t look like it’s been in the back of his wardrobe since he left school. And maybe he should try to tame his hair just a bit.
He holds out his hand, and Harry hands over the next charteque in the pile. He grabs a biscuit of his own, before he goes back to the file.
The door slides closed behind him, and he slumps against the wall, casting a thorough cleaning charm on his shoes. He’s probably going to get called into Savage’s office tomorrow and lectured about proper press etiquette. But really! Percy is so power hungry, he’s starting to wonder if he’s learned anything at all from his stint as one of Umbridge’s toadies. Ha! Toadies. He smirks at his own joke. The lift pings, and he steps out. Compared to the atrium, Level Two is a quiet haven. Gracie is using her wand to sort a stack of folders, and there are a few DMLE officers chatting over their desks, but no one seems to be in any great hurry. He catches Davies’ eye and sends him a smile and a wave, letting him know that he’s safely back. Then he makes his way to the Auror Department and sinks into his chair.
“Read this. The building is covered in all sorts of privacy and concealment charms. You should be able to see it when we get closer.”
“Yes. Of course I did.” He fumbles in the leather bag he’s carrying over his shoulder, and draws out a dented, brass goblet. Harry leans a bit closer to the window. If that’s the Chalice, it’s certainly nowhere near as impressive as he’d imagined.
The last button is finally undone, and the cuff loosens. Draco peels it away slowly, but still manages to take a sliver of burned skin with him. A hiss escapes through Harry's clenched teeth. Draco looks up at him, grey eyes intense with something that Harry can't really define.
Harry only just has time to kneel before a pair of small, round arms are flung around his neck, and his nose is buried in bushy red curls.
The glare Draco’s been leveling at him melts into something much softer, and Harry has to remind himself that this is a really, really bad time to grab him and kiss him senseless. He settles for a quick peck on the lips, and kicks the door open.
“Yeah. That’s a good idea. Wright doesn’t really strike me as the type of bloke who owns a lot of books, anyway. There could be something there…”
“There were two toothbrushes by the sink, and I heard what he said, when I came back from the loo. A bit odd having a Tornadoes scarf lying about, if you don’t like Quidditch.”
“That sounds like a reasonable plan. I should stop by the Manor and let Mother know about our trip. You should be able to reach me there.” The look he gives Harry is half challenge, half resignation. “The password for the Floo wards is ‘Martin Miggs’.”
Mr Granger convinces them to stay for lunch. Harry sets the table, only half listening to the fairly disgusting conversation between Mr Granger and Draco about various forms of tooth decay in Iron Age skeletons. Hermione is trying to convince Rose that she should wear socks, and Ron is at the kitchen table, trying his best to look as if he knows what he’s doing with Mr Granger’s computer. He’s making a decent effort, Harry thinks. But on the other hand, what does he know? The last time he used a computer, it was a big, boxy thing with a huge screen and a cord and a… clicky thing. This one’s much smaller, not unlike the one he saw in Draco’s office at the museum.
“Yes, Auror Potter, Sir. Blimpy didn’t see, but elf magic is not like human magic. Blimpy could tell!”
“I’ll ask if we can use the Floo.” Malfoy steps over to talk to the old witch behind the bar, and leaves Harry to the whirlwind of embarrassment and fatigue and pure want that is turning in his stomach. This is not good. This is not good for so many reasons! He takes a deep breath and wills himself to calm down. He’s revealed too much already. Enough that working with Malfoy is going to be pure agony. And he does still have to work with Malfoy if he wants to solve this case. Ron probably isn’t going to be able to do much without his magic. The churning in his stomach suddenly becomes a lot more physical, when he thinks about Ron, surrounded by healers, looking pale and determined and gritting his teeth, but unable to levitate a feather. Yeah. Apparating is definitely a bad idea right now.
A jolt of arousal goes straight to his cock, and a surprised laugh bubbles up from the squirmy tangle of nerves in his belly, before he can stop it.
“Thank you. I’d love to.” Hermione actually looks tempted to rip the books from the shelf right now.
"And that's exactly why I decided to do it. It's not exactly glamorous, you know. The pay is so ridiculous you'd laugh. And I only got the curator position because there were't any other candidates under the age of ninety. But I really enjoy it."
Hermione has been levitating the kettle and an extra mug over to the table, but now they hover in mid-air, while she turns and looks at Draco worriedly.
Ron nods. “Yeah, God knows what those old farts might decide. Nevermind how long it`l take them tol finish squabbling and actually reach a decision.”
“Oh! Yes. We did. I ended up burning my arm, but Draco healed it.” He sketches a small wave, trying to demonstrate that his arm is perfectly healthy.
Draco turns his arm over, careful to only touch the less-burned patches of skin, and starts undoing the cuff. Harry curses the stupid design of his shirt. All those buttons! What is it with wizard wear and buttons? He should have done what he usually does and thrown on a t-shirt, but this morning in front of the mirror, it had seemed like a good idea to look somewhat presentable.
Draco opens the door, and Harry is immediately attacked by a small bundle of bushy hair and bouncy energy.
“If you want to view the memory today, you should probably get back to the ministry. Hermione’s leaving early to pick up Rose,” Ron says.
Harry grabs a fresh memo-plane from the stack on his desk and jots down a quick message. Then he returns to the transcript he’s been looking at. There has to be some sort of clue there,some hint about who would murder an old pureblood wizard who’d fallen on hard times.
Harry unstoppers the potion and downs it in one go, carefully swallowing it all, and trying not to think about the slightly lumpy texture and the muddy taste. He watches as Draco dips slender fingers in the soft, golden salve. The first gentle pass of those fingers over the sensitive skin of his newly healed arm leaves him shivering. Draco bows his head over his arm, and applies the salve with gentle, careful movements. Maybe it's the almost-caress, maybe it's the smell of honey and chamomile. Whatever it is, it makes Harry's pain-clenched muscles relax, and his breathing evens out. Something warm curls low in his belly and he shivers again. Draco looks up at him through almost silver lashes. His eyes look darker in the low light from the fireplace.
Yes. What about the cup? He should hand it over to the Ministry, like he’s supposed to. The Department of Mysteries are probably itching to start examining it. But something makes him hesitate. Percy has been a good Minister for Magic in many ways, but still... He realises that he’s rubbing his thumb across the thin, white scars on the back of his hand, and stops. Giving an overbearing arse like Percy that much power is... unsettling.
They cast the spells on each other and grab hold of the bottlecap that Ron has unwrapped from his handkerchief. The familiar tug behind the navel comes immediately, and when they land, they’re at the bottom of a steep grassy hill, strewn with rocks.
Harry barely keeps himself from banging his head against the desk again. He should have known Ron would eventually take Hermione’s side.
It’s so unlike Malfoy that, for a second, both Harry and Ron just stand there, gaping. Malfoy clears his throat and raises a single eyebrow, making him look much more like his prattish, schoolboy self. Harry manages to shake all his Malfoy-related thoughts and plunk down into one of the chairs, watching out of the corner of his eye as Ron does the same. Malfoy settles in a much more comfortable looking swivel chair on the other side of the table.
“No. Yes. God, I don’t know. I was worried about you. About you. You’ve proved to be practically impossible to get rid of, and yet I was in there thinking about the most unlikely scenarios.”
“Really, Harry? ‘Out of your clothes and into my bed?’ That is such a horrible line! The fact that I’m actually falling for it speaks volumes. I should have been in Hufflepuff.” Draco shakes his head and turns to go back inside.
Very carefully, he reaches out and puts a hand on Draco’s arm. The soft wool of his jumper is a warm caress to the sensitive skin on his newly healed palm. He can feel the muscle underneath trembling slightly. Then Draco’s arm softens under his touch, and Harry leans in the rest of the way, brushing cold lips over warm ones, and breathing in the scent of fresh winter air and man.
Even on the broom, he can see how Draco’s shoulders tense. He pushes his broom so close their knees are touching. It’s a dangerous maneuver this high up, but he’s not having this conversation in shouts, and they’re both good flyers. He loosens his grip on the broom, steering one handed for a moment, as he reaches out and rests his hand on Draco’s arm.
“Your father has been controlling the New Dawn from his cell. The guard who was hostile to you is Bludger’s brother. Your father used him to get messages to his minions. And Bludger might be hiding in your summer house in France.”
“Yes, Auror Potter. You may involve them in a strictly academic capacity. No field work. Do you understand?”
He shakes his head, curls bouncing around his face. “Sorry, Auror Potter. I’m not allowed in there when they do experimental magic.”
The heavy door creaks open, and then slams behind them. Harry looks up, and there he is, Lucius Malfoy, wearing the same tattered, dirty robes he had on when he was taken into custody after the Battle of Hogwarts, and the same haughty sneer. He’s sitting on a wooden stool, and his hands and feet are chained to iron rings in the floor. By his posture, he might as well be sitting on a throne.
Lucius returns to the Manor. He reads loads of books and writes notes in a journal that he hides inside a hollow tome. There is something about snakes and references to ancient cults. Something about a ritual in a secret language, and using the blood of the victim to release the magic from the cup. But nothing about how to find the cup itself.
“I wasn’t. But things are looking a lot more interesting now.” Harry smiles in a way that he hopes is just the right mixture of seductive and friendly. He’s crap at these things, so he probably looks more constipated than smoldering, but Adam doesn’t seem to mind.
“Listen here, Harry! You do not get to blame yourself for this. I’m a bloody Auror. I know how to handle cursed objects, and touching them with my bare hands is not the way to do it. So get this through your thick skull once and for all, because I’m getting sick of repeating myself. This. Is. Not. Your. Fault!” He emphasises the last few words with none too gentle pushes on Harry’s shoulders, making him shake back and forth. There’s an odd buzzing in his ears, and Ron shoves him into the hard visitors’ chair before he climbs back into the bed and flings the blanket over his legs with a huff. They stare at eachother for a while. Rons eyes are completely sincere, as he meets Harry’s baffled look.  He really believes what he’s just said. Harry doesn’t. But he’s got brains enough to keep that to himself.
“Why the fuck not?” Harry shouts back. “It could have kept you out of fucking prison! You could have gone to Azkaban, you stubborn git!”
Draco raises his wand and starts casting healing charms. Harry watches, fascinated, as the skin knits back together, going from blistered to angry red to pink with each pass of Draco's wand.
He slumps down in his chair. He knows Ron’s right. Of course he is. But for some reason he thought that his friends would have a solution.
Harry does remember now. Tanned Bloke…No, Jamie, was released after questioning, because he was under seventeen at the time, and they didn’t have any real evidence of him being aware of what was in the crates he helped his uncle levitate.
“I hope that he’ll be able to help me solve a murder case involving an ancient artefact,” he bites out.
“Come on, Malfoy. There’s a pub in the next town over. Let me at least apparate you there and buy you a glass of Ogden’s Old. You look like you could use it.”
Cell 23 is almost at the end of the corridor. Harry stands in front of the heavy, wooden door for a second, collecting his thoughts. For the first time, a tiny sliver of doubt creeps into his mind. What if Draco’s actually done something wrong? He closes his eyes and takes a deep breath. No. He might have been willing to believe that a few weeks ago, but now that he actually knows Draco… No. He points his wand at his palm and draws a single drop of blood. Then he presses his palm to the door knob. It glows faintly, and when he mutters an unlocking charm it clicks open. He takes another fortifying breath, before he knocks gently, and opens the door.
“Dismantle the wards, then stay back and let you do the actual search, and be ready to call the Aurors,” Draco summarises.
Without even pausing to put on his shoes, Ron hurries out to meet them, and takes Hermione’s place on his left side.
Hermione is leaning so close to the book that it’s almost completely obscured by a cascade of curls. She fumbles for her wand on the table without taking her eyes off the text, and nonchalantly configures a napkin into a piece of parchment, and a teaspoon into a quill.
Their team mates clap and cheer and Ron hides his blush in his beer. Harry smiles. Ron will never change. The thought brings an odd little twinge of half regret. After all the attention the war has brought, after being accepted into Auror training with the best score in over a decade, even after advancing to full Auror in record time, he’s still surprised when people pay attention to him. But Ron deserves to be celebrated. When the suspect fled into Madam Merriweather’s Preschool for Young Witches and Wizards, Harry was almost prepared to let him escape to spare the children from witnessing a full on duel. But Ron saved the day with a well aimed and lightening quick stunner.
Three guards are waiting for them at the gate. Life in Azkaban is hard, even if you’re only there for an eight hour shift. The men look hardened and rough. They swipe Harry with a casual charm and when they don’t find anything suspicious, he’s allowed to step through. He takes a few steps towards the building, before he realises that Malfoy isn’t with him, and turns back. Malfoy is standing with his front against a wall, his palms resting on the bricks, and his his feet apart. Two guards are searching him manually, padding at his pockets and manhandling him into whichever position will give them better access. A third guard is casting a barrage of detection charms on him. Malfoy’s mouth is a grim line, and there are two angry red spots on his cheeks. It’s several minutes before they’re satisfied that Malfoy doesn’t pose a threat and let him pass the gate.
“Not the bloody point,” he mumbles into the napkin. The pain is so intense he actually contemplates snorting the ice water on purpose.
The ropes shoot from his wand as they’re supposed to, but Bludger manages to dodge them by diving behind the open shed door.
Mr Brigg opens the door a bit wider, and they step into the small, cluttered cottage. “I suppose you’ll want a cuppa?”
The backup team arrives in a matter of minutes after he’s sent a message to Savage through the Protean charm on his badge. Relief courses through him, when he sees Hestia and her partner Williamson Apparate in the square outside. Good. These two aren’t going to give him grief about wanting to stay with Draco. Hestia smiles and waves at him, when she spots him through the window. He looks to where Draco is sitting in a comfortable chair, transfigured from one of the hard backed dining chairs. He’s starting to get a bit of colour back, and the bandage is as pristine and white as it was ten minutes ago when he and Fifi changed it. The wound must have stopped bleeding. At least for now. A curse wound like that isn’t easy to heal, though. Draco’ll have to see a healer as soon as possible.
Narcissa looked doubtful. “I’m still not entirely sure whether I trust this - what did you call it? Scienriffic… advances?”
“This isn’t simple house arrest duty!” Robards puffed up all five foot four inches of his stocky frame. “Draco Malfoy has officially transitioned out of the Home Parole program. He’s going to be free to move about wizarding Britain again, and he needs a probation officer that’s personally familiar with him, so that when - “ Harry made a note of protest at this - “yes, when, he makes contact with Dark Wizards again, and commits crimes, there’s an unbiased observer there to catch him at it. Someone who can make a clean case of it in the Wizengamot. Someone who will be convincing in a trial.”
“Maybe we should try watching ice hockey next time, Ron,” Harry said. “The skates make it much faster.”
Sirius would have been delighted. He hated the Malfoys, Harry remembered fondly, and would have seen this as a prime opportunity to publicly humiliate his distant cousin.
Thank you for your owl. Yes, I would also like to meet with you as soon as possible. My solicitor informs me that the meeting must occur within seven days of being released from house arrest, which I believe is this coming Saturday. I am, therefore, at your disposal any day of this week, at any time.
“How -” Harry wet his lips quickly with his tongue. He had to get out of that habit. Robards kept reminding him that it was his “tell” - everyone knew he was nervous when he did it, and suspects picked up on these things. “How on earth did you decide to create a calligraphy business?”
“Still. Draco is gay, and he’s your son, and he’s perfectly capable of having children even if he doesn’t marry a woman, if that’s what he wants.” Harry let the smile drop off his face. “And you will support him and love him just as he is, regardless. No more trying to force him to marry someone he doesn’t love.”
Harry felt faint as all the blood rushed out of his head. He tightened his grip on Malfoy’s hair. He thought back to earlier this week, when he had imagined Malfoy begging. “Do you really think you deserve to suck my cock?”
“What properties?” Draco asked him, his dander rising again, the nearly human moment they’d just shared evaporating. “Surely you don’t think we still have properties?”
Malfoy finally turned his head and looked at him, and quirked a smile. “Because you saw me. In. You know.”
This chapter begins with Draco's backstory, many years before the first chapter. I hate when fanfic writers overly linger on past events, so don't worry - I'll get you caught up quick. A huge amount of this chapter will be filling you in on all the things Harry didn't understand from the first three chapters. I hope you enjoy all the easter eggs I've left in this chapter!
Harry conceded the point with a shrug. He and Malfoy lapsed into silence again. Minutes passed. The others on the field were singing songs and throwing conjured wood onto the fire. Harry had no idea where this conversation was going next, if it was going anywhere at all, and so he said nothing. But Malfoy was doing that thing with his mouth again, opening it and then shutting it, like he wanted to say something and thought better of it.
“Scientific. Yes. And you should. It’s just as reliable as magic, really. More, in fact. Not so many quirks.”
Malfoy’s breathing was hitched and rapid now. “Please, sir. Please let me suck it.” He was nearly frantic, but he didn’t move to touch Harry. “Give me permission. I’ll be so good. Please.”
At this, Neville could not help himself, and openly guffawed. Somewhere behind them, Harry could hear Ron bang his head against the wall. He’d hear it from him later, at the pub. Ron was always trying to tell Harry how to play politics in the department. Not that Harry ever listened.
By using the word “climax,” I am trying to imply there's more sex in this chapter, while also teasing a cliffhanger. I am a very subtle and clever writer!
To make matters worse, one of the chasers had a shoulder injury, and Draco was starting. Harry would be forced to try and ignore him the whole game, which was a near impossibility. Draco’s hair was tied differently, half of it up in a topknot, the rest flowing loose down his back, rounding past his sharp cheekbones and cupping his shoulders, right where Harry would like to grab him and give him a good shake.
Once they arrived back at his flat in Scotland, the next three hours passed in a blur. There were four tits,
Harry was already knackered after they’d wrapped up their last case. It had taken ten teams of Aurors, and they’d been living in the Black Forest for fifteen months, subsisting off rock cakes and jerky of dubious origin. Harry had celebrated his twenty third birthday hiding in a cave after running from the pack of werewolves they’d been tracking. He was stranded without his wand  for forty-eight hours. It was a near thing he was even alive, but he’d loved every second of it, and he’d been looking forward, on his return to England, to being assigned the illegal potions ring investigation.
It would have been funny if Harry wasn’t so exhausted by the end of the day, and when he finally came back to the office and saw Draco sitting alone in a chair by his cubicle, he waved him off.
Harry studiously ignored Malfoy the next several conditioning sessions, and was congratulating himself on his self control, when he realized that Malfoy was becoming angry.
Draco had entered the foyer and stopped, stock still, his lip reaching new heights on the side of his face. Harry took in Grimmauld Place with fresh eyes. It was true he didn’t keep it as clean as surely Draco’s army of house elves kept Malfoy Manor, but it was tidy enough. He hadn’t redecorated after the last purge of dark artifacts nearly ten years ago, during the war; he’d just moved in with his Hogwarts trunk and set up camp in Sirius’ bedroom. All his worldly possessions sat in the trunk still, at the foot of Sirius’ bed. It’s not like he had any reason to go round buying furniture, or replacing the peeling wallpaper. It suited him fine, as a place to live.
By the time they got back to the flat, Harry’s cock had swollen painfully in his trousers and was battering up against the zipper in an enthusiastic bid for freedom. Once the door was closed, Harry turned toward Draco in the foyer and shoved his pants off. Draco was looking up, at the light fixture, and then around at the wide expanse of the great room, and then down, at the marble tile floors.
Harry’s balls were pulled up tight, too, and tingling. Harry pulled out of Malfoy’s mouth and fisted himself, one, two, four pumps, until he came in great stripes all over his face, painting his nose and his chin and spilling over his forehead. When he was done, he breathed deeply and held Draco’s face against his groin, smearing the cum around a bit, and slowly came back to himself. He looked down.
Harry startled. Malfoy was standing next to his blanket. He was dressed in robes, all black, and sealed down the middle with a row of buttons that reached high up on his neck. And he was looking at Harry, expectantly.
Harry glanced over at him out of the corner of his eye from time to time. Malfoy was wearing khaki pants today with a blue sweater over a grey buttoned shirt. The highest button was done up. On the surface, he looked perfectly ironed and aristocratic and stuffy, his long hair done up in a top knot, tied so tight it was pulling a bit at his eyebrows.
Brilliant, Monday, three o’clock, Ministry of Magic Auror Department. Show the office secretary this letter. Thanks,  HP
Harry pretended to walk out of the locker room with all the others, but instead waited at the end of the lockers, behind them, so that as Malfoy finally headed out towards the door, Harry threw out an arm to stop him.
Harry’s eyes raked up the other man’s tall figure, finally meeting his face, his neck craned back a bit at an angle (when did Draco find the time to get so tall, Harry thought), a face which he now noticed was watching him with what could only be described as disgust commingled with a mighty disappointment.
“I’m not going to dignify that with a response,” Draco said, eyes rolled up to the ceiling so far they were practically glued there.
“You… I wasn’t… you have -” Harry couldn’t quite settle on which astonishing thing he had just learned to comment upon. “You work for muggles?”
Harry could tell Malfoy wanted to roll his eyes, but didn’t. Instead, he sucked his teeth and clucked with displeasure as he sat cross legged next to Harry on the blanket. He let one of his knees touch Harry’s thigh, just barely, and then pulled away. Harry kept watching the fire, and said nothing.
“Something tells me Ron won’t care whether this thing is a few inches loose,” Harry replied, tugging at the fabric.
Malfoy looked like he was trying to work something out of his mouth, but his tongue wasn’t cooperating. He opened and shut his mouth twice, before he finally said, “You came all over me, and told me to go to practice like that, and then you’ve ignored me all week like it was nothing. Like that was something you do all the time.”
He sat on the cushion on the windowsill in his breakfast nook, and watched the mist roll in from the seafront. When he’d rented his flat, he’d been sure that he wanted a cozy cottage type place, maybe upstairs from a pub, but when he’d told the estate agent what his budget was, she took him straight to the newest condos on the waterfront. They were modern, and had all the wizarding bells and whistles, and the shower dumped nearly a gallon of water on him every minute from five different directions.
“No, they are not,” Robards said, quietly. “You’re the only person on this team who knows him well. Everyone else either took bribes from his father when he was still alive, or is prejudiced against him. Hates him.”
Ron and Neville were nearly pink with glee by the time Harry caught up with them for after work pints. When he pulled a stool up to the end of their table, they were in the middle of regaling Hermione with the blow-by-blow of the morning meeting.
Harry knew he’d made a right mess of Malfoy, and that he was still covered in it. And so he watched him, for the first time, and for the first time, Harry noticed that he flew beautifully. He was graceful. He could dodge, and flip, and skate past the beaters; he was powerful and fast and aggressive.
Harry was nearly blind with lust himself, and something else inside him took over. Draco looked so small, standing there in the great empty hallway, with skin nearly as white as  the marble on the floor. He looked like he needed direction.
Hermione would tell him to ignore it. In fairness, Harry knew that this was the rational course of action.
. People could always read Harry’s body language somehow, and Malfoy must be on alert for any sign of Harry acting strangely, after how terrified he had been in the locker room. He knew he should stop looking, should put his feet back together and will his dick to relax, but between the sheer boredom of the meeting and the way the faint blush was now reaching the tops of Draco’s ears, Harry was driven to distraction.
One minute, Harry was trying to think what to say next, and the next, he’d pushed Malfoy up against the lockers. For a split second, Malfoy stiffened like he was sure he was going to be attacked, but then Harry put his mouth on the crook between Malfoy’s neck and
“I…..” Malfoy stopped, and now his whole face was red, and he’d pulled his knees up to his chest. “I want you to humiliate me again. Like you did on Monday. But in a different way. Ways. All sorts of ways.” He was breathing fast now, and he wasn’t looking at Harry. He was talking to his knees, like Harry wasn’t there. “I want you to touch me, but not the normal way. I want you to tell me what to do. To treat me like…. Like you’re better than me. To embarrass me.”
“Well, you won’t do it, will you,” said Ron, firmly, as if he could hear Harry’s brewing sense of self-disgust. “I’ll help you write the reports. We’ll make sure you look like you’re cooperating, and we’ll also make sure we don’t write anything incriminating that Malfoy doesn’t deserve.”
Part of Harry had been hoping Draco would do something stupid and romantic at the start of the match, like run after him out the tunnel, and throw his arms around him and beg him to be forgiven, and Harry would have said, “of course, Gorgeous, of course, don’t cry,” and kissed his pretty cheeks, and the crowd would have cheered, or booed, probably, but what would it have mattered…
“Sounds perfect,” said Harry, making eye contact with the blonde woman, who must be Lauren, looking his way. He gestured with two fingers towards her, and she came over to them, looking cautiously overjoyed. Harry put five more galleons down on the bar and walked out with them, trying and failing to smile, one  under each of his arms.
Draco stared hard at him for a moment. Now that the fervor of their coupling had passed, Harry was sure Draco would curse him, or hit him, or both, for what he was asking. But Draco tucked his chin down into the barest of nods.
Harry plucked two more tissues out of the box. He sat next to Draco, and held the tissues out. Instead of taking them, Draco turned his face towards Harry’s hand, and Harry wiped him off, gently. He rubbed all the mess off his forehead, and his brows. He rubbed everything off his nose and chin, the cum and the drool that had leaked out around Harry’s cock. The second tissue Harry used to wipe off Draco’s cheeks, drying the tracks the tears had made on his skin. Draco’s eyelids fluttered closed, and Harry wiped the tears off his lashes, too.

But Harry wasn’t fifteen, and Malfoy wasn’t fifteen, and Malfoy’s mother had saved his life, and when Harry remembered that he felt sad that Sirius was a bully all over again, even to people who maybe deserved it.
By Thursday afternoon, Harry had come to the realization that Malfoy was in a fit of pique when he slammed the door leaving the boardroom after their last preseason meeting. He reminded himself of his pangs of conscience on Monday, his guilt over cornering Malfoy; he told himself he was doing the right thing.
“An ill-u-stra-tor,” Draco said slowly, like he thought Harry might not be familiar with the term. “I draw things. For money.”
The fifteen year old Harry, still mad about Draco’s involvement with Dolores Umbridge, would have done it in a heartbeat.
The life ahead of them looked so quiet now. Babies, and children; holidays, and making love. Harry took Draco’s hand and squeezed it.
Narcissa Malfoy answered his owl immediately, and within an hour they were sat in a muggle coffee shop. She looked completely out of place and was fairly gawking at the green mermaid on the logo painted in the window; Harry made an order at the counter and sat down in front of her.
“I’m going to watch you come,” Harry told him, and as he did, Malfoy’s dick spasmed and spit cum out over the top of the lace panties, the fluid dribbling down the front. Malfoy squeezed his eyes shut and
“Possibly the only time I’ve bought a book for someone as recommended reading,” Harry said. “You’ll have to send Hermione an owl so she’ll believe it’s really happened. It’s about some muggle scientific advances. They’ve done incredible things with - well, with figuring out how to get people who can’t have children on their own to - to be able to have them.”
Harry nodded. “Yes, let’s,” he said, murderously. Robards shot him another look that clearly communicated not only Harry’s subordinate role in the Auror department but also the impending disciplinary action that would follow a single additional act of public disrespect.
This… thing. Whatever it was. With Malfoy. It had to stop. Rather, Harry had to stop. All the thoughts he’d had before, when his cock wasn’t doing the thinking for him, about how it was wrong to approach Malfoy, came rushing back.
Harry was so quick to anger. He knew it was a fault of his, and he didn’t care; he needed Draco to hurt. “There wasn’t anything to wonder about, Draco. I broke up with you because you’re a coward. We’ve nothing left to say to each other, unless you suddenly, by some miracle, manage to be brave enough to stand by me in public.”
Malfoy looked at him, clearly trying to master the shade his face was turning, and failing. “Potter.” His voice was steady though, and clear.
Robards paused to take a breath, and Harry seized his opportunity. “House arrest duty is junior auror training detail, Robards, I’ve earned the right to -”
Draco’s legs were flush with the baseboard now, and Harry knocked him down cleanly, helped him settle back. “It's okay, gorgeous. Let’s get your pretty little cock out.” He rustled in the acre of fabric until he had it exposed. It was hard and dripping.
But Draco would have had a cock for Harry to pull on, and the word “sir” would have been falling from his lips, and the whole lot of their nastiness would have been between them, all the mocking and humiliation, and when Harry came, his eyes were shut tight.
Harry touched him dispassionately for several minutes, Draco lying still and quiet. From time to time he made a soft noise or squirmed, which Harry encouraged gently. “That’s right, we need to get this soft before we leave, gorgeous, or you won’t be comfortable, will you?”
Neville grinned. “And I’ll help you write the reports if he does deserve it,” he told Harry cheerfully. “It’s odds on he will.”
“No thanks,” Harry said. “I think I’ll just walk to an apparition point and go back home to Scotland. We have an early practice tomorrow.” That was a lie, but Harry was intent on spending at least an hour here in Shoreditch before he went home, and he didn’t want Ron and Seamus knowing about it.
“Oi, I didn’t come all the way here for another Saint Potter lecture,” said Cho, sliding in beside Hermione.
Four days later was the first Quidditch match of the new year, and Harry was on edge and feeling deadly as he put on his gear, stubbornly ignoring Malfoy a few benches down, doing the same.
Ron rolled his eyes and turned his attention back to the football. “Can’t we watch something else? They hardly ever score in this game.”
Draco turned his gaze out the window, his arms still crossed. Harry knew, from the look on his face, that the window pane was grimy. Actually, Harry had thought to himself that he ought to have the casings and trim replaced, as they were quite old and cracked in a few places, and let the cold in.
The team watched him go, then slowly turned their heads to behold Harry, who knew, absolutely knew, that he had a stupid grin on his face, and he couldn’t do a thing about it.
For once, Harry had been viciously happy to be in the papers. Draco read the society section religiously. He was gruesomely pleased, as he read over the article, to see speculation that the blonde woman he’d left with might be his mystery date from Miami, and also that the photograph accentuated a slight bulge in his denims. As he had read it over breakfast, Harry had hoped Draco would be eaten alive by jealousy.
“Ron, we’ve talked about this. We don’t bring up war stories in mixed company.” She nodded in Seamus and Dean’s direction, who were both looking decidedly pale and as if they were trying and failing to avoid looking at her forearm. “It puts people off their night out,” she said, as if she were reminding him to put out the crumpets for tea time. She turned to Harry. “Can you tell me what happened, Harry? Only, it seemed -”
been in Knockturn Alley. That photographer had the good fortune of selling a photo to the newspaper of Harry with two very pretty young mediwitches leaving the nightclub, looking at once both wolfish and apathetic.
Harry looked at Draco, taking him in as if for the first time. Every bit of him was perfect; he had arranged himself just so - his hair wasn’t slicked back anymore, but it was sleek and flawless against his head, parted three quarters of the way across it. His robes, his shoes, his skin, his insistence on finding the least offensive chair in the room, the elegant disregard for Harry’s shabbiness - it all added up to a rather severe sensibility. Harry couldn’t relate to it. He didn’t care how he was dressed, or what his house looked like.
Harry stared from the card up to Draco, then back down at the card, then back up to Draco. Then he looked down at the card again, and a funny noise happened in the back of his throat, sort of like the noise a blender would make, but only if it was broken.
Narcissa seemed to consider this. She took a tentative sip up her frappuccino, screwed up her face a minute, reconsidered, and took another sip.
“Er, Malfoy, you’re going to have to be more specific.” Harry had no idea where Malfoy was going with this.
Harry shook his head in frustration. “You - yes, you do, the manor has house elves, and those have to be registered on your forms,” he said.
At this, Narcissa smiled. “I’ve found, from long experience, that is usually what it takes to convince my son of anything.”
With a start, Harry realized that while his left hand was still gripping Malfoy’s jersey to hold him in place, his right hand had wandered to Malfoy’s lycra athletic shorts, and was rubbing at the hard cock it found underneath them. Not rubbing. Massaging. He was gripping it, turning it over in his fingers, feeling for something underneath the smooth polyester of Malfoy’s Quidditch gear.
It was there. He was wearing them. Again. Harry pulled off Malfoy’s neck, nearly panting with want, and Malfoy gasped. Harry’s right hand grabbed the shorts and shoved them down. He and Malfoy, together, stared downward.
He was just sitting down in the kitchen to a bit of toast when his floo roared to life, and a delicately folded scroll popped out of the fireplace.
“Er, right,” said Harry, unprepared for the sudden fond look she was giving him. “Well. The reason I’ve called you here.” He bent over and reached into his bag. He extracted a book and set it heavily down in front of Narcissa.
Harry broke eye contact with Robards and stared at his reflection in the polished mahogany of the table.
Draco was crying. Two fat tears were streaking through the mess on his face, which bore an expression that was placid and far away.
Harry didn’t like the bragging that sometimes went on between mates, and he’d never been one to boast about his own performance, but he tried to see to it that he came after his partner was satisfied. But now, fucking into her slow and hard, the lace rubbing against his foreskin as he stroked out of her, he couldn’t help himself, and he came hard after two minutes inside her.
Harry rested his head on the wooden lockers, just above Malfoy’s shoulder, breathing hard. Malfoy wouldn’t look at him; he seemed lost in his own world, taking shuddering breaths and keeping his head pointed at the shower. Harry grabbed his chin, pointing his face towards his own, and Malfoy opened his eyes.
“I - I thought all manors have lands,” Harry said. “Isn’t that the income you live off? Renting the land to farmers?”
“Precisely,” said Ron. “And he’s looking a bit down in the mouth about it. We’re his mates, and we’re going to cheer him up.”
“No, obviously. We took them off first, that’s why they’re in his locker. Do try and keep up, Pucey.”
“Or you could hook us up with some tickets to a Quidditch match,” Ron suggested. “Don’t the Magpies have free skyboxes available every week for friends of the team?”
Sparing no time, Harry had immediately sealed his mouth onto the crotch of them and started tonguing at the rough lace. The texture of it, the ridges of the thread pulled tight over the girl’s smooth skin, made him want to drool all over her. And so he did. She was panting and bucking into his mouth, making quiet desperate noises until Harry pulled the underwear aside and entered her, and then she cried out, high and clear, while he drove his cock into her slowly, savoring the feeling of the lace on his shaft.
Every pair of eyes in the locker room turned, at once, to see Draco Malfoy clutching his knickers. “Those are mine,” Draco said simply, his voice steady. Harry was astonished to see that he wasn’t shaking, not even a little. This was not at all the romantic, Quidditch match declaration Harry had been hoping for an hour ago.
Naturally, he’d forgotten that the next day was meetings, booked solid, with the Creature department and the Wizengamot, processing the werewolves they’d brought in from Bavaria. And so again, Harry returned to his cubicle in the early evening, to find Draco sitting opposite his desk, looking quite hungry indeed.
“That’s right.” Harry started a slow wank with one hand, pressing Draco’s hips into the mattress with the other. “It’s good to feel sexual, isn’t it?”
“I’d heard that,” Draco said. He didn’t say he was sorry, or that he knew how Harry must feel. Harry felt unexpectedly grateful to him. He looked back down at the form, which had turned a bit blurry. Harry blinked twice, and it became clear again.
Dean and Seamus were right. Harry was spoiled for choice. The club was bouncing with people, dancing and eyeing each other up from across the room.
He rifled through his messy locker, looking for his gloves. They were hiding under some track pants he’d forgotten were stashed in there, and he was so distracted trying to get them on, it was a solid three minutes before he realized he’d been trying to shove the left glove onto his right hand.
“Do you really?” Robards said. “I rather thought, after you spoke for him at the trials, that you’d put the past behind you.”
Harry set their next appointment via owl the next day for half past eight Friday morning, which of course was the day an escaped erumpent, confiscated the night before from an illegal smuggling operation, managed to destroy half the atrium. He received an owl an hour before his appointment notifying him that all ministry officials were to do whatever work they could from home while the creature department employees rounded him up and set everything to rights.
A blimp had exploded - or as the report put it, “catastrophically deflated” - at a Muggle football stadium due to a case of accidental magic. No one was hurt, but whoever had caused the explosion had also filled the blimp beforehand with rubber ducks. It was all hands on deck for the entire ministry, and everyone from Kingsley Shacklebolt down to the greeting witch in the lobby was casting memory charms and trying to contain the unmanageable hoard of quacking, waddling rubber ducks trying their level best to escape the pitch.
Draco looked at Pucey steadily, and with a fair amount of condescension. Harry thought he must have learned it from watching Hermione at school; it was so similar to the expression she wore whilst discussing
Naturally, nothing of the sort happened, and Harry had spent the match more and more frantic with his own completely unexpected grief. Nothing could have prepared him for how much this stupid arrangement meant to him, how much he had wagered his feelings on it continuing, or at least not blowing up in his face the way it had.
There were too many unknowns here for Harry to rationalize, to understand. So when the meeting was dismissed, and they all rose to get to the pitch for practice, Harry decided to stop thinking about all of it, take his own counsel, and do what came naturally.
He and Emily had talked for all of thirty minutes before it became abundantly clear that they were both after the same thing, and they left the bar to kiss and fool around a bit in the alleyway. She led him back to her flat, and within five minutes Harry was face to face with just what he was looking for.
, Malfoy, and fuck your cowardly family. Come talk to me if you grow enough of a spine to stand beside me out there,” Harry gestured to the stands, and turned on his heel and walked out.
Harry couldn’t stand the feeling that crawled across his skin, just thinking about Draco with another man. He shoved it down. He shoved it down, he thanked the girls for an excellent evening, he took them to the shop and bought them both coffees, and then he walked down the road to the practice facility, where he lost his late morning and early afternoon to the rowing machine.
Hermione looked up at Harry, concerned. “Harry. We’ve spoken about this. You’re never going to replace Robards as head of the department if you can’t keep a civil tongue in your head.”
Harry felt the beginnings of a headache coming on. He knew it was going to be like this, but in all the chaos of the week, he hadn’t quite prepared himself for how frustrating this was going to be. “Where in Wiltshire?”
Harry woke up in his own bed the next morning, alone. He’d spent a few hours at Emily’s and then shown himself the door.
The other players were done changing into their scrimmage gear. Harry was interested to note that Malfoy changed in a shower stall, by himself, so that nobody else could see him.
Draco agreed, and Harry practically ran out to the apparition point, he was so desperate to buy a kebab and pass out at home.
Not ten hours before, Harry had taken, by owl delivery, the bespoke potion that he had ordered from Blaise for Draco. It was the modified Polyjuice potion. It would have given Draco… well, so much of what was in front of him, the round curves and the breasts with the large nipples.
“That’s how we made our money before,” Draco told him. “The lands were confiscated and paid off for reparations. How do you not already know this? Don’t you read the papers?”
Malfoy’s’s skin turned a bit pink. Not a full blush, but enough for Harry to notice, and after a minute or two, Malfoy put his quill down and clasped his hands in front of himself, his gaze fixed on Nelson, resolutely not looking in Harry’s direction.
Harry didn’t have Draco’s file with him - it was still at his desk at the ministry - so he put some parchment on a spare clipboard and tried to remember what was on the form of questions he was meant to ask at their initial meeting. He had done parole interviews before during his first year out of training, and it wasn’t difficult, but it was an awful lot of work transcribing it all afresh, with the result that he didn’t have time to shower or change into his Auror robes before he heard the doorbell go in the front hall.
The Monday morning team meeting had gone on for two hours already, and most of the team members were fidgeting in their chairs or engaging in the practiced art of yawning with one’s mouth closed. Clarence Nelson, the team owner, had droned on interminably about the team’s finances, marketing opportunities, and future sponsorship obligations, none of which Harry cared a whit about. He turned up whenever the team administrative assistant told him to turn up, and smiled for the cameras that pointed his direction, and let the press secretary release statements for him about this or that charitable endeavor.
This was a game they were playing lately, Harry gently condescending to Draco, touching him quietly until he came. It made Draco breathless with humiliation. Last time Harry had done this, Draco had been so overwhelmed he stuck his head under a pillow for ten whole minutes afterwards, trying to slow down.
. Harry couldn’t possibly do anything about this, could he? He knew he wasn’t going to tease him about it, wasn’t going to bully him, but could he, in all fairness, go to him as an equal and ask him to… Harry wasn’t quite sure what he was going to ask him to do with him, but his cock assured him it was something prurient.
He went with Ron and Seamus, as was his custom on Saturday nights, and waited while they got a bit tipsy at the bar. Harry had suggested they go out to a trendy outdoor muggle bar in Shoreditch built on top of shipping containers. Their usual haunt in Knockturn Alley wouldn’t do for Harry’s purposes. The few times he had picked up girls at that club, pictures of them together had wound up in
The next morning, Harry had a sinking feeling that he’d made a terrible mistake in telling Draco to find someone else to fuck him. What if Draco was out right now, doing just that? Harry would have to murder whomever it was, of course, or at least hurt them very badly, but that wouldn’t change Draco’s freedom at this very moment to suck whichever cock caught his fancy, to call some other man the things he called Harry....
, he thought to himself, even though they weren’t black. They were hot pink, a small disappointment quickly overcome once Harry realized they had the same thong shape he’d seen on Malfoy the night before.
Harry took the card in his hand. It was milk white and made of stiff cardstock. Whorls and scrolls of ink danced across it as soon as he touched it, resolving gradually into words. It read, “Black Calligraphy” and it had a telephone number underneath, and stranger still, an actual email address.
“Not every day,” said Harry, truthfully. “If they confiscated the lands, why didn’t they confiscate the manor, too?”
Harry scoffed at his reflection. “I’m not fussed about how I look. I can’t get used to formal wizard robes. This - thing -” Harry tugged irritably at his throat. “It’s confining, I feel like I’m being choked.”
Draco gave him an inscrutable look. “My services are contracted by Muggles. Quite frequently. You wouldn’t believe the amount of pounds Muggles are prepared to spend on wedding stationary. And it’s - well, it’s obviously a bigger market than wizarding weddings.”
Harry’s plans hadn’t taken him past this point, and he was now firmly on his back foot. “I thought we might have a chat.”
His shoes looked old-fashioned, like the high heeled slippers men wore long ago with a fancy white wig, only they couldn’t be old, as they were jet black and so shiny they must have been polished with petroleum. Draco wore black… tights? Leggings? Harry didn’t know what to call them, but they hugged the muscles of his calves so tightly they may well have been painted on. They disappeared into black breeches, which became a tunic of sorts, all made of soft black linen and held together smartly with a row of several dozen cloth buttons.
“For Merlin’s sake, get on with it,” Draco said testily, taking his eyes off the ceiling and fixing them on the floor.
Seamus huffed. “If you won’t at least try to understand, then don’t wa- AHHHHHHHHHHHH! TWO BLOODY INCHES SHY.”
“I have it,” said Harry. “I’ve looked over it, briefly, but I prefer to get a feel for things myself, if you don’t mind. It helps me organize things mentally.”
Robards leaned forward again, his knuckles cracking on the table under the not inconsiderable weight of his frame. “Auror Potter. Draco Malfoy will report to you for probation for a period of one year. You will surveil his house, his movements, and his communications. You will inform me of any suspicious activity, and you will build a case to put him in Azkaban, where he belongs. Is that clear?”
article, not two days ago. It wasn’t on the front page, but there was a full spread in the society section. A photographer
“Maybe Robards has a thing about Death Eaters,” said Ron grimly. “There’s so many that escaped punishment, he could want to make an example of them.”
Pulling at the bar had made things worse, not better. For one thing, he hardly knew Emily, and though she had been wearing panties, Harry had fucked many (well… several) women wearing panties before. That wasn’t what was really at the root of all this, then, was it?
Katherine frowned, taking in Harry’s apparent dejection for the first time. “Doesn’t look like it’s fun. What’s wrong?”
But what reason would Malfoy have to believe him? All through school, they’d antagonized each other, and made each other’s lives hell. Harry had testified against Malfoy’s father. What if Harry went to apologize, and Malfoy thought he was pressuring him, or bothering him, or threatening him just by bringing up the possibility of outing him?
Harry was on his way across the floor, ready to punch Pucey in his fat mouth, when a pale hand reached out between them and plucked the pink fabric out of the air.
. But he couldn’t form the words. Malfoy was still looking at him with his perfectly grey eyes, his face pink, and his heart thudding under Harry’s hand, which was still grabbing his jersey.
Oliver Wood was standing next to Pucey, and he flashed Harry a smile, reached out and knocked him on the shoulder in a friendly sort of way.
He, Ron and Seamus spent time watching a football match on TV while Ron and Seamus drank a few pints. Harry drank nothing. It was a sad consequence of his Quidditch career that he couldn’t drink more than once or twice a month and expect to perform up to standard, and last night certainly qualified as a cheat day.
Draco bit out a cry. Harry rubbed his free hand up and down Draco's thigh. “I’m sorry it took me so long to notice. Your cock needs to be wanked so much, doesn’t it?”
“What ‘things’ could you need to organize?” asked Draco, his temper rising. “Am I under investigation?”
Draco was standing rigidly on his front step. Harry noticed that he was wearing the same set of robes he’d had on the other times they’d seen each other, at the ministry, but now he had a chance to… take them in. Properly. And they were… they were…
“We don’t have any house elves, they were all freed or redistributed in our reparations settlement.”
“Harry.” He pulled out a second chair and put his feet up. “I’ve already ordered for you. Do you like frappuccinos?”
Draco stared up at the ceiling. He got so worked up by this, this new little game that they’d found; Harry marveled at it every time, that he always had to stop for a few minutes and breathe slowly. Draco called it “coming back downstairs.” Harry loved it. He loved it.
“So, explain this to me again,” Ron said through a mouthful of chips. “If they can’t use broomsticks to get to the ball, why don’t they just drive around on motorbikes? Wouldn’t the game be faster that way?
Malfoy turned his face away to look back at the showers. “Yes,” he said in a low tone, his voice catching with an involuntary groan. Harry rubbed his cock even harder up against him, slower now, more deliberate.
Harry glanced around, making sure they weren’t within hearing distance of one of Robard’s cronies. They liked to frequent the Leaky after work. “It’s not classified. Not officially. Robards wants me to dig up dirt on Malfoy.”
As he really considered this, Harry was stung by guilt. He wanted to go to Malfoy this minute and tell him that Harry would keep his secret, that he had nothing to be afraid of, and that Harry would leave him well enough alone, if that’s what he wanted.
“It’s still - it’s unfair Robards - oh, don’t give me that -” Harry had caught Robard’s rather dramatic eye roll. “I’m not being entitled. I caught Greyback wandless, for fuck’s sake, I’m better than the other aurors and you know it, stop treating me like -”
Harry wondered what he had on under his khaki pants. Were they the same as on Friday? Or were panties a weekend thing for Malfoy? Maybe something he had been planning to wear to a… a club. Of some sort.
His thoughts disjointed, Harry cast a quick  scourgify on himself in the locker room instead of taking a shower and changed into clean clothes. He left before Malfoy could emerge from the showers, and went home to eat instead of seating in the team mess hall.
At that age, Harry had point blank refused to allow himself to be used that way, and here he was seven something years later, facing the same treatment and taking it.
ed his way out of every problem in life (barring more recent problems, naturally), who was too good to have more than one pint with the team, who showed up to team meetings in bloody Oxford shirts with wool pants.
Harry opened his pantry and sighed in disappointment at the smoothies that had been prepared for him by the team chef. They were all on a strict diet, and Harry knew it was part of his paycheck to be fit and healthy, but flax seed, yogurt and spinach whizzed up in a blender wasn’t his idea of a satisfying meal.
He never thought Hermione was one for theatrics, but sitting in the front row at the head of a thousand wizards and witches, watching Ron take her hand, he was awed, as ever, at her instincts. She’d talked Ron into wearing the sword of Gryffindor, and he looked ferocious with it strapped to his side, knocking on his glinting black boots, the tall length of him splendid in the afternoon sun of the Great Hall.
They didn’t have much more to say to each other. Harry didn’t know if there was anything else he could say, but Malfoy stayed next to him, and he stretched his legs out so their feet were touching.
It bothered Harry in a way he couldn’t articulate, and even though he’d recently had sex, and was trying his best not to think about the situation sexually, he couldn’t puzzle out why he found it so interesting.
Harry had no experience with such places, but the thought of it made his cock fatten a little bit in his track pants. He shifted his feet so his legs were a bit further apart. All sorts of things could happen at those clubs, and as Harry thought about them, he continued to skate his eyes to the corner of the room, where Draco was sitting just across the big oak table.
Hermione was outraged. “Harry has broken up with someone he was taking rather seriously, Dean - I highly doubt that he would like to go looking for a random person to take home and shag.”
Harry followed him over, and when Malfoy sat on the couch, he took a fistful of his hair in his right hand and bent his neck back so he would have been looking upwards into Harry’s face, if his eyes were open.
Instead, Harry went up to the bored looking blonde girl with the short skirt and offered to buy her a drink.
Jealousy wasn’t the vibe he was feeling at the moment from Draco, however. It was sharper, more self-righteous. Harry had been aiming to say “serves you right,” to a very contrite Draco when they next saw each other, but instead, Draco was acting as if
He grabbed the file in front of him and made to leave, but he noticed something strange about the name scrawled on top. Malfoy had been crossed out, and in its place was -
Instead of looking for the snitch, Harry spent most of the scrimmage coming to the realization that what he thought was a quick hump before the game might have been more than he bargained for. It was only after their reserve seeker made a beeline for the post behind Harry that he got his wits back and managed to (just barely) grab the snitch by doing a neat backflip and catching it with his left hand.
“Yes, obviously.” The smirk turns into a small but genuine smile. “Will you Floo me, when you’re done?”
“But Ma’am,” Harry resists the urge to rub a hand over his eyes. They’ve been discussing this for almost twenty minutes, and Savage isn’t listening to a word they’re saying. He tries again anyway.
“Yeah. About that... I… I wanted to apologise for bringing you along in the first place. That wasn’t a fair position to put you in.”
“I’ll check back as soon as I can,” he says, already turning on his heel to make the jump to the DMLE. The last thing he sees before he Disapparates is Draco's face, pinched in worry.
“W-what?” His mind supplies a not at all helpful stream of memories of hands gliding over skin and mouths meeting, tasting, exploring.
Apparently, they’re going to the Grangers’. In between swearing and cursing and having to lean on both Hermione and Draco to limp from the spot behind the shed and into the house, he wonders why they’re not going to Malfoy Manor, and why that leaves him slightly disappointed. He’s known Hermione’s parents for years, after all, and up until a few short weeks ago, Malfoy Manor didn’t exactly induce a feeling of safety and comfort. But putting weight on his right ankle feels like stepping on broken glass, and he decides that he’s got more important things to worry about.
The crime scene is in a small cottage surrounded by an overgrown garden and a fence that might once have been white. Everything is covered by a slushy, grey layer of sleet that seeps into the fabric of their cloaks and trousers on the short walk from the street to the front door. The cottage is sitting on a dirt road on the outskirts of a Muggle village, and any hope Savage may have had of reassuring the public by sending Harry and Ron there is clearly in vain. There’s not a single person in sight, apart from the two DMLE officers slouching against the door. The older of the pair gives them a quick once-over and doesn’t bother asking for ID when he sees their red robes. He also doesn’t bother returning their greeting, but he does push away from the door enough for them to slip by. The younger one, Davies, who sometimes comes along on after-work trips to the Leaky Cauldron, greets them with a smile.
“I think I need you to be a bit more specific than that,” he drawls, “There are literally hundreds of thousands of ancient magical artefacts.”
“CSI! I saw it on the telly when we were visiting Hermione’s parents at Christmas. It means Crime Scene Investigators. It’s brilliant!”
Tobby? Harry can’t help wondering if he’s standing in front of one of Dobby’s relatives, but given how his old friend used to speak of them, he’s not sure if he dares to ask. Before he can make up his mind, Tobby disappears with an extremely muted pop.
The notebook doesn't look like much. It's small, bound in smooth, black leather, with the initials LM stamped in gold in the bottom right corner. It's exactly the kind of thing Lucius Malfoy would own, Harry thinks. Tasteful, and yet obscenely expensive and obnoxiously in-your-face about it. He reaches out to take it from its hiding place.
Hermione is biting her lip in that way she has. The one that means that Harry isn’t going to like what she’s about to say. “I talked to Draco and he said we could use his. We’re expected at Malfoy Manor at eight.”
“No, poor Percy, when mum gets a hold of him! You know how worried she’s been since I ended up in here, and now she’s blaming him.” Ron smirks, and Harry can’t help return it. The tension’s gone, and they move onto discuss if the crap hospital food is worse than the crap food in the ministry cafeteria, and whether Percy’s going to be even more of an arse if he’s reelected or if it’ll make him relax just a fraction.
A huge lump of ice spreads through his entire body, pressing on his lungs and making it hard to breathe. He gasps.
Draco doesn’t look like he’ll be fine. Actually, he doesn’t look like he should be flying at all. But he can still hear Draco’s words in his head, telling him that he’s not going to make him see a healer with his broken ankle, so insisting that they stay here and see a local healer would be arrogant as hell. Besides, the last time he tried to persuade Draco to do something he didn’t want, he ended up in prison. Trying again might not end very well.
“Maybe it’s not that book after all,” Hermione points at the diary. “Maybe it’s this one.” She draws her wand and starts casting spells on it. She dismantles a few hexes and when she deems it safe, she opens the slim book. A bunch of pages have been ripped out, leaving only the first few letters of every word.
“Do you want to ask the questions, or do you want me to?” Ron asks. This is a well worn routine. They go over cases by asking each other questions and providing the answers. Sometimes all it takes is someone asking the right question. Sometimes it’s not even necessary to ask, simply saying things out loud makes the last piece of the puzzle fall into place.
I never planned to write more for this story, but when thinking of something to write for the October 2020 prompt of the 12 Short Stories challenge, this came to mind. I've got one final instalment for this one in mind. I hope you all like these additions.
Harry closes the book and makes his way to their usual table. Malfoy will be there, and Harry wants to show him this book. And tell him that they can go and practice BSL in the DADA classroom. Uncle Remus told Harry they could use it as a place to practice. That way, nobody will be able to see what Malfoy and he are up to.
Harry doesn’t look up when Shacklebolt stands up and starts to talk. Another person Harry let down by running. By becoming an accomplish to a wanted criminal. Always on the run. Always looking over his shoulder. Until they made a choice and found a way to live their lives in peace.
And then Hermione gave us quite the scare. She screamed and almost dropped the milk. It turned out that Scabbers, Ron’s rat was hiding in the milk jug she just took from the cabinet. The rat looked dreadful. He was thinner than we’d ever seen it and it writhed in Hermione’s hands as though it was desperate to free himself.
“The git thinks he’s funny, remembering me off all the awful encounters I had with him,” Harry says. He walks out of the library and back towards the great hall. When he gets there he walks straight to Malfoy who is still sipping his tea. His eyes widen when Harry stops right in front of him.
Neville, Hermione and Ron noticed. They shake their heads and whisper among each other when they think Harry isn’t paying them any attention. But they don’t say a word to Harry, or tell him to stop. And Harry kind of loves them for that. They know him well enough to know that this is just something Harry needs to do.
I love watching Draco play. He’s really good and looks so beautiful on a broom. And now even more since he stopped putting so much grease in his hair and it falls more natural around his face. Mom, dad, I’m sorry, I’m hopelessly in love with him.
The class is all good fun.      Most students their Boggart is easily changed into something funny. Ron makes a spider use roller skates and Harry cranks his head to figure out how having Slytherin win the Quidditch Cup could be turned into something funny. Until Malfoy has to face the Boggart and his father steps towards him, shouting without making any sound. The entire class falls silent.
Oh, and this is also when I discovered the location of the Gryffindor common room, the portrait of the fat lady is their entrance. Hermione made me swear not to tell anyone since I’m not supposed to know. And I won’t, she’s my only friend in this school, I would never want to get her into trouble.
Draco looks up to see Harry’s face. His eyes are closed and he bites onto his bottom lip. He looks so vulnerable and hurt. Draco knows this is truly the start of the end. He’d hoped it would take longer. He thought he would have more time with Harry. But he should start facing the truth. This will end soon, Harry will leave, and Draco will just have to find a way to deal with it. Maybe he should look up his dealer, see if he can still supply Draco with the potions he needs to get by once Harry says his final goodbye.
I’m going to kill him when I find him. I really am. He was supposed to be your best friend. You trusted him with your lives, our lives. And he betrayed you. He’s dead. I’ll do it. I don’t care what will happen to me after. I just want him dead.
“Oh, sweetheart.” Harry strokes his hand through Draco’s hair and then places a soft kiss on his lips. “They don’t think that. They know you love them.”
For a short moment, I was afraid Draco would turn around and leave school and that I would never be able to say sorry to him. But he just looked furiously at Hagrid and stayed.
“Vincent,” Harry answers. Draco swallows and blinks away a tear. It has been years, but the pain of losing Vincent still stings. Just another person that lost their life because of Draco’s misguided actions. If only Draco had been a better friend. Or even better, just let the boy be. All he ever used him for were his muscles. And only when Vincent was gone for good, Draco realised he’d just tried to make Draco proud of him. That all Vincent ever wanted was to be a real friend to Draco.
“Of course, he does,” James says. “His mother was the same. Nobody could keep secrets from her.” James looks away for a second. Harry wonders how much his parents still miss them. They were all friends before it happened. Both hidden away to try to save their children.
Luckily for us, Hermione knew it was Devil’s Snare and that it hated light. She wanted to light a fire but complained she had no wood. Ron than screamed at her, asking if she had gone mad and if she was a witch or not. After that Hermione made bluebell flames come from her wand and the plant loosened its grip so Ron and I could pull ourselves free.
A beam of light shines into the compartment. Harry looks out the window. The rain has stopped and the sun is trying to fight its way out of the clouds. It’s so different from only minutes ago, when the Dementors had entered the train and almost killed Malfoy.
“What if we make a deal,” Harry starts. He looks back at Hermione who now swirls their potion around before adding some powder.
Harry blushes and looks back at his plate. His parents haven’t said a word about Harry’s crush on their extra house guest this holiday. Not since they got home only two hours ago. Harry is sure his dad will pull him into a private conversation before they are due back at Hogwarts. But for now, they are behaving. Even Sirius only gave Draco a questioning look before he returned to Lily to tell her that he’s making the pudding for Christmas dinner.
“There are spells to capture rats,” Ron says. “I’ve seen my mum use them from time to time at the Burrow.”
Draco bites his bottom lip and nods. Of course, his mother would notice. Just as she noticed that Draco didn’t want the Dark Mark on his arm. She probably already knows. There is no point in hiding the truth from her. There never was. It’s silly Draco thought he could keep this secret from his mother.
“You won’t be helping him by making him hate you,” Hermione says. And Harry knows she’s right. That doesn’t mean Harry is just going to give up on being Malfoy’s friend. He’s going to help that boy to become less lonely. Even if it’s the last thing he does.
That was the moment Sirius seemed to realise that Draco was here. He pointed his finger at him and told him that they would have a word about how Draco deflowered James son. Draco turned pink and said that James and Lily already know, that I had already told you in my letters. Sirius smiled at that, saying he might be wrong about Draco too, but that he still didn’t like the thought of us having sex at this young age.
Harry gets Draco to look at him again. “It’s just us now,” he signs. “Can you tell me why you’re scared?”
Harry is sure that Draco sits at his regular spot. Standing out only because of his platinum blond hair. Hair that features in most of Harry’s dreams. All the good dreams, and in some of the bad. Just so Harry can wake with a deep sense of longing for the boy he can’t have. Not that it matters now. The only thing that matters is that Draco is safe. Harry can’t let anything happen to him. He will never forgive himself if Draco gets hurt because of him.
“No, of course not,” Hermione says as she flips her hair out of the way. “If I did, I would have reported it the moment I figured it out.”
Harry doesn’t know how to reply. He knows exactly how that feels. It’s nice and painful at the same time. And a struggle to keep your urges in check, to not let the words you want to say slip out. If that is what Harry reminds Professor Snape of all the time, it makes a bit more sense that he dislikes Harry so much.
Harry rests his head on his knees and looks at the Quidditch pitch in the distance. Not that long ago he was on that pitch with Draco, helping him get into the air on a broom. Harry had never seen Draco that happy. He was so beautiful that day. It was the day that Harry realised he’s in love with Draco. And now Harry will do anything to get that back. He wants nothing more than to have another afternoon in the sky with Draco. To have him sit behind Harry while they fly through the sky. To feel Draco’s arms around his waist again. Harry wants to hold him close and keep him safe. Safe from the person that wants to destroy them all.
On my way to the Slytherin dungeon, Nearly Headless Nick caught up with me and asked if it had worked. He had persuaded Peeves to crash a vanishing cabinet right over Filch’s office. I thanked Nick for his efforts and told him it had worked, that I got away without punishment. To thank him I wanted to help him with the Headless Hunt, but I didn’t know how. Nick said it was okay, and that there was something else I could do for him. I could come to his five-hundredths death-day on Halloween. He said I didn’t have to if I rather go to the school feast. Only a death-day party sounded much better than sitting as only Slytherin at the Gryffindor table during a feast because the people from my own house don’t like me or pretend I don’t exist. And there would be no way to escape Draco at the party, seeing him being all friendly and nice with Pansy, Daphne, Nott, Crabbe and Goyle. I hate seeing him hang out again with the people that almost killed me last year. So I said I would come. Nick said I was allowed to bring a friend if I wanted to, so I invited Hermione, Ron and Neville.
“Alright then,” the matron said, “Mr. Potter, you are two months pregnant. Harry’s face became ghostly white as his brain connected the dots--the baby was Vernon’s. Tears fell from Harry’s eyes as he sobbed into Draco’s chest. “You have options,” the mediwitch explained to the clearly distressed young man, “If you don’t want the baby you can choose to end the pregnancy or I can assist you in locating an adoptive family, you have until three months to decide.” Harry was having a full blown panic attack by this point. Draco picked up his mate carrying him bridal style, sneering at the mediwitch and telling her to go to hell as he carried Harry back to their room.
It was several hours before either boy spoke again. Harry was the first to, he asked a slightly pointed question, “Won’t your father disown you, he expects an heir?” Harry asks nervously. “He might, I’m much more afraid he is likely to try and pressure you into carrying and heir,” Draco clarifies. “I don’t know if I could handle it...it’s such a woman-ish thing...” he says anxiously, feeling guilt and shame about not feeling like he could give Draco a family. “I understand if it’s not something you want,” Draco replies, holding Harry tightly “I think you should know first that many transgender wizards have had children, it wouldn’t make you any less of a man,” he adds. Harry kisses him softly in thanks.
Harry eventually fell into a restless, exhausted sleep. Draco held his sleeping mate, imagining a life where they raised the baby Harry’s bastard of an uncle had forced into his beautiful mate. He knew he could love the child as his own because it would be part of his Harry. He imagined them raising this little one, who he thought would be a girl, alongside Harry’s godson and two or three children of their own. Draco fell asleep thinking about the family he could have with his mate. Draco resolved to support any and all choices Harry made about  his pregnancy and to always hold him when he needed to break down.
Harry's relatives barely stopped the car at King's Cross, Dudley pushed him out and threw his cousin's belongings on the curb. Harry sighed and collected his things, heading towards the barrier despite being an entire two hours early. Once through the barrier, Harry stowed his trunk and owl cage before finding an empty compartment towards the back of the train. Harry laid down on one of the benches, deciding to take a nap while he waited for Draco to arrive. Draco also arrived a fair bit early, hoping to find his mate. The need for Draco's blood was becoming unbearable.
When Draco finally found his way into the compartment where Ariana was sitting crying her eyes out. Draco feels a strong need to comfort his mate. Before Draco can think, he has his mate in his lap holding her tightly. Draco takes a thumb and gently wipes away the tears. Harry looks up into grey-blue eyes. "You won't want me...once you know..." Harry croaks out between tears. Draco holds his small mate tightly, "Tell me sweetest," he whispers softly then squeezes her even more. "I'm not a girl, at least I'm not supposed to be..." Harry says blushing and crying. He hid his face in Draco's cheek. Draco rubs his back, "It's okay love," he whispers. Harry sobs himself breathless. "What should I call you?" Draco asks, "I assume you prefer a different name," he adds in a soft voice. Harry nods, "H-h-arr-ry," he stutters out nervously. "Harry," Draco repeats with a half smile, "Suits you." Harry falls into an exhausted and fitful sleep. Draco holds Harry close as the small boy sleeps for a few hours before waking up. "Draco," Harry says, his voice raspy from crying and from sleep. "I have you, sweet boy," Draco reassures him. Harry blushes softly and turns away.
Harry had tears in his eyes and curled himself up in his boyfriend’s lap. He had been holding himself together for so long, he let it all out as soon as he felt safe. Draco was still dealing with his own emotional turmoil, but his urge to protect Harry was stronger. Draco felt an insatiable desire to protect and care for the smaller boy who had allowed himself to be vulnerable and but his faith in Draco.
"Draco, I'm hungry," Harry whispered, blushing brightly and biting his nails nervously terrified to ask for what he needed from his mate. "I need blood," Harry mumbled under his breath, ashamed of what he needed from his mate, "I'm sorry." "Oh my sweet, sweet boy," Draco replied softly, running his fingers through Harry's hair to calm and reassure him once again as he spoke, "Never be sorry for needing my blood. Harry, baby, it's natural for you to need my blood. I am your mate you need my blood, just as I need your presence. A vampire needs his mate's blood for energy. A veela will die if he's without his mate for too long or if his mate rejects him. We both need the other. I love you, even if our creature inheritances brought us together I really love you."
"Professor, I have some requests to make on my and my mate's behalths," Draco said using the distant, authoritarian voice his father was known for. Harry curled into his boyfriend's side, trying to disappear. "Now what can I do for you, Mr. Malfoy, Ms. Potter?" the professor regarded her students curtly, she had a welcoming feast to get to after all. Draco glared holes through McGonagall's head when he heard her refer to his Harry as miss. Harry flinched slightly as he always had when people misgendered him. "Harry," he corrected in a soft nervous whisper, "Mr. Potter," Harry said with a bit more confidence. McGonagall nodded, face still expressionless with her mouth in a thin line as was her normal, "I apologize Mr. Potter, now will I be assigning you to the boys' dorm or should you request bonded quarters?" she asked getting to the point without missing a beat. "Shared," Draco replies confidently. Harry blushes a little, Draco squeezes his hand tightly. "I want to be resorted," Harry tells her nervously. McGonagall nods and places the hat on Harry's head. Finally the hat says in Harry's head, now you see I was right last time you belong in, "Slytherin," the hat screamed. Harry smiles and Draco hugs him tightly.
Harry places a soft kiss on Draco's cheek. Draco caresses Harry's cheek before pushing his lips against Harry's soft pink lips. They pull apart after a few moments, both boys blushing brightly and not looking at each other. Harry hides his face in his mate's chest, under his shirt. Draco held Harry, neither of them speaking for a long while. The pair was content to stay, wrapped up in each other's grip. Harry lets out a small relieved sigh, feeling safe for the first time in as long as he could remember.
Once they arrived back in their rooms Draco sat on the bed holding Harry tightly as the smaller boy brokedown. It was more than an hour before Harry’s tears stopped, leaving him breathless and beyond exhausted. His voice came out raspy and weak as he asked the question which had been haunting him ever since Madam Pomfrey had given him the unwelcome news a mere hour and a half before, “Do you want me to get rid of it?” “Harry, love,” Draco says in a soft, kind tone, “Oh Harry, baby, I love you and if you want to keep this baby I will love them like they were my own.” Harry wraps his body around Draco’s, arms around his neck and legs around his waist.
“I like you a lot...love you even,” Draco replies, “I will always support you and I want a life with you,” He explains, “Mother will adore you, father will take more convincing,” Draco assures, “I will make sure you are safe from Dumbledore and your relatives. You will have a family and you will be not only accepted, but embraced as yourself.”
Ever since his thirteenth birthday Harry had felt a burning feeling in his throat, an urgency. He felt a strong need for blood, not just any blood--Draco Malfoy's blood. The feeling made him uneasy. The last month of his summer was horrible. Harry felt hot and dizzy the whole time and worst of all as if half the blood had been drained from his body. The need for Draco was painful.
He knew what it meant. It meant he had to wait, his mate whoever he was--and it would most definitely be a man because Draco was 110% gay--his mate hadn't came into their inheritance yet, he was younger. Draco spent the next almost two months doing his best to avoid his father and staving off boredom by reading, gardening, and completing his summer essays. Finally at the end of July, the pull of his mate appeared. Draco knew who his mate was, Eva Lily Potter--the bloody girl-who-lived. He knew she wasn't a veela because another veela would've been drawn to his location immediately, the veela magic leading her to his location. Draco spent the final month of summer moping about and attempting to come to terms with who his mate was.
“My father would disown me for being gay,” Draco admits sheepishly. “Why?” Harry asks, grimacing as he thinks of how his relatives would react if they knew he was trans and gay. “It’s a very long story,” Draco replies in an attempt to avoid the question.  “We have an eight hour train ride,” Harry jabs back now leaning against Draco. Draco smirks coyly, rolls his eyes, and let’s out a soft huff before beginning to tell his story, though he lets Harry’s head stay against his shoulder. “I believe I was seven when we met, you might know her. She’s in the year below us, her name is Astoria Greengrass she’s in Ravenclaw. We had been betrothed days after her birth,” Draco explains. Harry gasps audibly, mouth gaping. “Shut your mouth,” Draco insists. “Astoria is alright, what changed?” Harry asks. “I don’t like girls that way,” Draco admits, going quite red. “Big deal? You like blokes,” Harry replied nonchalantly. “To my father it is,” Draco retorts. “So Lucius Malfoy is a bigot, whoop! Whoop! Shocked,” Harry jabs back with a snarky tone. “I’m heir to the Malfoy line, I cannot be with a man because I have to produce a son,” Draco corrected, “My father would be fine if I had a brother,” he amends.
“Can you help me with something now?” He asks hopefully. Draco nods. “Cut my hair?” He pleads. Draco gets out his wand and casts a spell which cuts off the long ponytail and gives Harry a short shaggy cut that suits him much better. “Thanks,” Harry says gratefully.
"Draco Malfoy," Harry said, trying to gain his mate's attention. "Eva Potter," Draco drawled in response. Harry flinched visibly at his mate's unintentional mistake by deadnaming him. "If we're going to be mates you should know my secrets," Harry explains tentatively, "You might not want me once you know," He admits sheepishly. Draco nods, unsure of how to respond. "I'm trans," Harry says bluntly, "I'm a guy, I want to be called Harry and treated like any other bloke," he added, cheeks bright red. Draco felt a strong urge to comfort his mate, to let Harry know he was loved and that Draco wanted him. Draco moved to the other end of the compartment sitting next to Harry before pulling the smaller boy into his lap, wrapping arms tightly around him. "It's okay," Draco assures him, "I've got you, you're safe with me." Harry sniffles softly before letting himself breakdown. He lets the tears stream from his eyes as he buried his face in Draco's chest. Draco held him close, soothingly rubbing his back. Harry cried himself to sleep in Draco's arms. Draco runs his fingers through Harry's hair and rubs soothing circles on his back, happy to just sit there and hold his mate. Draco felt an overwhelmingly protective urge towards the small boy in his arms. Draco knew his mate would have a lot to overcome and he wanted to be by his side through everything. Harry slept comfortably in Draco's arms for several hours, sleeping soundly.
Harry blushes a little at the thought of being pregnant. "I would like to have a family with you when we're older, I feel uncomfortable about the idea of being pregnant," he says sheepishly. "Harry, I would never force you," Draco assured, arms tightening around Harry. "I don't really understand a lot about what being mates means and how the magical world feels about trans and gay people because I was raised by muggles," Harry admits. "Mates means soulmates, destined to fall in love. Lady Magic chooses our soulmates the moment we are conceived, though until age 16 we don't know who we belong with. As for sexuality and gender, we are far different then muggles. No one in the wizarding world cares or judges anyone for being gay, lesbian, bisexual, asexual, or other orientations, apart from pureblood heirs who are expected to marry opposite sex and produce heirs for their lines. As for your being trans it is not exactly common or widely discussed, however there are various treatments which can help your body develop more like other boys and it is considered extremely rude to misgender or deadname anyone when you know better. The professors will help other students learn to address you and show respect. Hogwarts and the ministry have policies and laws to protect trans wixen," Draco told him in an effort to help his mate's confidence. Harry's relief was palpable.
Siri and I wanted to, but we wanted to ensure you were protected first, we owe James and Lily that,” he adds. Harry’s head was spinning, he was scared and confused. “Should we be going to Hogwarts?” He asks, no longer feeling he would be safe in the school. “Probably not,” Remus says truthfully, “Dumbledore is a dangerous man who only seeks his own political and economic gain.” “Can we get off this train?” Harry asks, desperation in his voice. Remus hesitates and then looks to Draco, “Send your mother a letter, let her know that you will be at her cousin Sirius’s home,” Remus instructs, “Don’t tell anyone that Harry is with us,” he adds.

Harry gets up and runs to the front of the train opening one of the teacher’s compartments to find a short man with brown hair and eyes who was deeply engrossed in a book.
"Do you want us to be boyfriends then?" Harry asks shyly. "If that's what you want, I'd like that very much," Draco responded with a grin. Harry kisses Draco on the cheek. Draco turns, pressing their lips together softly. Harry grins and pulls away after a minute. "Can you do me a favor?" Harry asks a bit before they are to arrive at the station. "Sure, sweetness," Draco agrees. "Cut my hair," Harry whispers. Draco obliges, taking out his wand and giving his boyfriend a shorter shaggy hairstyle. Harry rushes off to the bathroom, coming back with a wide smile. Soon the train arrives in Hogsmeade station. Harry and Draco walk off the train hand-in-hand.
There are other safeguards for young children, to protect them from exploitation. Children age six and under must be no more than three years apart in age and children six and under cannot be betrothed to children over age six. Children seven to twelve can be up to five years apart though no one ten or younger can be betrothed to anyone over age twelve. Anyone twelve or older must consent to their contract and the maximum age of the younger member of a match is fifteen. If both parties are over twelve than age differences of up to ten years are acceptable and age differences greater than ten years require approval by the department of wizarding child welfare.
"You feel better?" He asks hopefully. "A little," Harry replies halfheartedly. "I want to be a real boy," Harry whispers wishfully. "You are a real boy Harry," Draco protests. Harry shakes his head, "Look at me," he pleads sadly. "I see a handsome boy," Draco muses then gets out his wand and casts a charm chopping of Harry's long hair. "There," Draco tells him smiling. Harry's eyes widened and he ran his fingers through his hair relieved. "I will help you, sweet boy," Draco tells him.
"Dwaco," Harry yawned out as he woke up, sleep thick on his voice still. Harry blinked several times and looked up at Draco, realizing he was in the other boy's lap. Harry's facial expression was fearful, mouth agape and eyes wide, he scooted out of Draco's lap and curled up into the fetal position. "Harry," Draco whispers in a soft, calm voice, "I'm here when you need me." Harry's expression changes from fearful to shocked to elated to apprehensive to fearful again. "I told you?" Harry asks, "You didn't leave." he adds, astonished. "I'm not leaving," Draco confirms, tone reassuring and a bit forceful. Harry grins, then blushes, "Will you hold me?" he asks, weary and nervous--overwhelmingly fearful of the potential rejection. Draco pulls Harry into his lap, arms tightly around the smaller boy, protectively. "Harry, I'm not leaving," Draco tells him again, wiping Harry's tears from his cheeks. Harry snuggles closer. "Draco, are you not embarrassed to be my mate" Harry whispers meekly, unable to imagine his disgusting self as desirable, it was wholly unfathomable. Harry knew he was a freak. No one loved freaks. That he was unlovable, a monster. That was all Harry knew, what he'd been raised believing. The idea that someone wanted him made him queasy. It felt like a dream, a too-good-to-be-true sort of dream.
Draco writes a quick letter to his mother, sending it with his owl. “Is Dumbledore Harry’s magical guardian?” Draco asks, realizing why Remus was so concerned. “Unfortunately, yes,” Remus confirmed. “Harry, you cannot tell anyone where you are,” Remus tells him a bit forcefully. “Can he make me come back?” Harry asks terrified. “Yes,” Draco says at the same time Remus says, “No.” Draco looks at him confused. “Sirius and I have already prepared documents for an emergency custody order. It will be granted once we ask the goblins to unseal the Potter wills. He illegally had them sealed claiming that Lily and James had been drugged because they wrote him out of their wills or something like that,” Remus explains. Draco looks shocked. Harry just looks confused.
Harry looked up into Draco's eyes, still fearful. "I'm not, I'm broken..." Harry explains tensely, "I'm a submissive...but I'm not...pure," he explained, tears running down his cheeks and a bright blush turning his brown skin rosy as he told Draco in the proper terms, knowing most dominants wouldn't accept their submissive mate if they were 'damaged goods'. Draco held him tighter, squeezing him hard. "What happen?" Draco asks, running his fingers through the scared boy's hair, making an effort to comfort him. "My uncle...he..." Harry sniffles out, sobs quickly overtaking his ability to speak. "Harry, baby," Draco whispers in a forced calm tone, "It's not your fault if your uncle raped you." Harry lets out a breath he hadn't realized he had been holding, it comes out as a sigh. "You don't hate me?" Harry asks sheepishly, voice trembling. "Oh Harry! I want to take care of you, I want to protect you, to fall in love with you, to make you my husband, to spend my life with you, to raise a family with you, for you to know you belong to me and no one can take what's mine away or harm it. My Harry, my sweet boy," Draco assures firmly. Harry sobs into Draco's shirt. A while later Harry calms down, feeling completely safe for the first time in his memory.
On Harry's sixteenth birthday Uncle Vernon had feigned illness, sending his wife and son of to an expensive amusement park with several of Dudley's friends. Uncle Vernon had tied Harry to his bed with chains, leaving the boy naked and at his uncle's complete mercy. The cruel man took his time, showering, eating breakfast, even watching a television program. Harry's anxiety was painful, the waiting increasing his terror. Uncle Vernon returned, belt in hand. The large man whipped the boy hard, only stopping when the boy looked close to falling into unconsciousness. The man stripped, getting on top of the boy and thrusting into his tight front hole without any prep or lubrication. Harry let out a pained shriek, thrashing about, despite having his wrists and ankles bound. Uncle Vernon came inside the small boy, laughing maniacally, "I'm going to knock you up girl! Then you'll see that you are a women, a mother." Harry sobbed and shook with terror.

"Can I tell you one of my own secrets?" Draco ask. Harry nods, happy to learn more about his mate. "I always thought I was gay, except there was one person who I was attracted to who I thought was a girl, it turns out he's actually a boy so yeah...I'm gay," he admits, awkwardly, "My father wants me to give him proper heirs, marry a proper pureblood witch. It is my duty to continue the Malfoy line," annoyance clear in his tone as he rolled his eyes and he sighed audibly in displeasure. "So your father is homophobic?" Harry asks for clarification. "No, he's fine with me being gay so long as I produce a legitimate pureblood heir, though he might like you more than most wizards because you and I could produce an heir, albeit he will not approve of your blood status," Draco rebuts.
“I wish I knew if my parents would accept me...” he thinks aloud. “Of course they would, just look at who they named as your godfathers,” Draco replies sincerely. “I have godfathers?” He asks confused. “Remus and Sirius Lupin-Black,” Draco says, “How could no one have told you?” He asks, astonished. “How do you know?” Harry responds with equal surprise. “Everyone knows, godparents are publicly announced, it’s a publicly recognized honor,” Draco explains, “Anyways, Dumbledore must have spelled them not to seek you out. Sirius is my cousin,” Draco adds, “His husband, Remus, is transgender. They have three children and one on the way,” Draco tells him. Harry’s mouth is agape, eyes wide as he takes in the information. Then he was angry, he had godfathers who could have raised him and loved him. “How can I talk to them?” Harry demands desperately. “Remus is our new defense teacher,” Draco tells him, “I do believe he’s a chaperone on the train.”
Secondly, there are many laws to protect LGBTQ+ wizards and witches including those under age seventeen. This includes rights in relation to marriage, family, medical care, education, non discrimination, and all other areas. Third, these rights include you. You have the right to access affirming medical care, to be resorted if you choose because gender identity plays a significant role in personality traits and motives, to request placement with affirming guardians, and to be placed in a boys' dorm or a private room, amongst other things,” Draco explains. Harry looks at Draco eyes wide and mouth slightly agape.  "There are many things that can be done to help make your body match your heart and mind," Draco tells him. Harry looks skeptically. "There are potions you can take, surgeries, prosthetics, and binders," Draco explains, "No matter what I will help you and protect you," he vows.
Harry woke up early the next morning, his stomach lurching. He scrambled out of bed quickly rushing to the bathroom urgently. As soon as he got to the bathroom he wretches into the toilet bowl. Tears stream down his face. Harry sits there, clutching his stomach and sobbing uncontrollably. Draco awakened to his mate retching into the toilet bowl. Draco went over to the bathroom and knelt down behind Harry holding back his hair and wrapped his arm around his shoulders. "Its okay baby," Draco whispered into Harry's ear. Once Harry had finished vomiting he leaned back into Draco's lap sobbing against his mate's bare chest. "How do you feel, baby?" Draco asked him as he rubbed his back soothingly. "I think I need to see Madam Pomfrey," he whispered feeling terrible. "Okay love," Draco said, helping him up and then helping them both get dressed before carrying Harry bridal-style to the hospital wing.
“Are you my godfather?” Harry asks after bursting into the compartment. “Ari--“ Remus starts to reply. Draco bursts in after him, “Harry there you are, sweetness,” Draco looks relieved. “I’m sorry, Harry,” Remus immediately corrects himself as if it were nothing. “I am one of your godfathers,” he confirmed, “Siri, my husband, is as well,” he adds, “We would have given anything to raise you, but Dumbledore cursed us to stay away,” Remus confirmed Draco’s suspicions.
Once the two boys arrived in the empty hospital wing Draco sets Harry down on the nearest bed before heading off to find the mediwitch. After a few minutes Draco returns with Madam Pomfrey intoe. "Mr. Potter," the mediwitch greets the boy, before casting a diagnostic charm at him. The mediwitch lets out a soft, shocked sound at the results. The woman takes a few minutes to compose herself, looking from one boy to the other and taking one last calming breath before explaining. "Mr. Potter, Mr. Malfoy," she asks tenderly, "Have the two of you been intimate in the past few months?" Harry blushes brightly and hides his face in shame. Draco replies once he realizes Harry isn't going to, "No ma'am, we haven't. Is he-?" Draco becomes nervous and cannot finish voicing his concern. “Mr. Potter would you prefer if Mr. Malfoy left?” the mediwitch asked. Harry holds tighter onto Draco, shaking his head rapidly in fearful denial.
After a few minutes of torture, Harry managed to break his restraints and throw his uncle off him as his body transformed with his creature inheritance. Fangs grew from his canines, his skin paled, dark circles enveloped his eyes, and a deep insaciable bloodlust grew in his belly, painful. He threw his uncle to the ground, knocking the older man out. Harry curled up in a ball, sobbing and desperately pining for his mate. Draco Malfoy, Harry needed him. His mate was his ex-enemy and Harry couldn't help but want to be safe in the other boys arms, to be loved, to have a real family with him. The last month of Harry's summer was largely uneventful. His relatives gave him a wide berth, more petrified of the boy then ever. Harry was able to complete his summer assignments, eat a bit more than normal, and avoid beatings or rapes. For Harry Potter, that counted as a good summer. By August 31st Harry was ready to meet Draco properly, fearful of rejection and a tad hopeful that maybe the could have a life together.
“I don’t understand all of what you said or how it applies to me, but if you are willing I need help navigating all these changes and stand by me, I would love for you as my boyfriend to be by my side through this if you want to...still...” he says nervously, hoping he wasn’t asking for too much or embarrassing himself by blabbering.
Harry hugs the man tightly. Remus hugs back, feeling an intense need to protect the boy who he knew would face many of the same challenges he had. Remus was glad Harry would have Draco because he knew he wouldn’t be the man he was today without his Siri. “If you are willing,” Remus says a bit uncertainly, “We would like for you to come live with us,” Remus offers. Harry nods and thinks for a minute, biting his lip. “You would be safe with them love,” Draco whispers. “You’re sure Sirius and your children would want me around?” He asks, fearing rejection. “How about I owl Sirius and can come visit so you can ask him yourself,” Remus offers quickly. “Okay,” Harry replies relaxing a bit and making himself comfortable in Draco’s lap. “What about your kids what are they like?” Harry asks. “Our oldest, Anya, is eight. She is quite a curious child and very creative. Then we have four year old twins, Greer and Taylor, they are little trouble makers. They take after their daddy, while Anya is more like her papa,” he says smugly. “Are the twins boys, girls, or one of each?” Draco asks, noticing that this fact had been left out. “We’re not sure,” Remus explains, “We are letting them tell us when they are ready.” Harry grins at that, “I wish I had felt like I had a choice,” he admits. “Your parents would be so proud,” Remus tells him, smiling sadly as he thinks of his close friends. “Really?” Harry asks in slight disbelief. “Of course, they made me and Sirius your godfathers and we all were very close friends,” Remus reminds him. Harry smiles at that, feeling closer to his parents being around Remus.
On his sixteenth birthday Draco woke up in bone shattering pain, his wings forcing their way out of his back bloody and weak. He screamed and cried, overcome by the intensity of his first veela transformation. His mother came to his room, giving him a pain potion and washing his wings gently. After taking are of him, Narcissa just held her son, her baby, soothing him until he fell back to sleep. Lucius was furious he had destroyed countless family heirlooms in his insatiable rage. An hour later he thrust open the door to his son's quarters, still enraged. He crucioed his son for a full two minutes, before relenting lest he drive his sole heir into irreparable insanity. Draco was sobbing and begging by the time the torture ended. Lucius smacked the insolent boy across the face, then pulled him into an upright position. The Malfoy lord forced his heir to meet his eyes. "I will not have you marrying some mudblood brat or being a faggot!" the man insisted. Draco nods, desperate for his father to stop. "You will marry a good pureblood heiress and produce heirs," the older Malfoy insisted. Draco nods, not trusting his voice not to betray him. "Answer me boy!" Lucius demanded, "You will marry whatever witch I choose." Draco strives to summon a bit of courage for his reply, "Yy-yesss, fa-fa father," he replies in a stumbled mess of whimpers. Lucius smacks his son once more, knowing this one would leave a handprint-shaped bruise. The cruel man wouldn't allow his wife to heal Draco magically, his wayward son would wallow in the pain. Lucius slammed the door, stomping off. Draco sobs, curling up in a ball. Once he was alone again Draco felt the ache of his heart, his veela pleading for his mate. Draco didn't feel a pull towards a mate, just an empty longing for something yet to exist.
