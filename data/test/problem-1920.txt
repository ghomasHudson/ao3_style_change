Draco blinked rapidly. “You have a gift for vivid metaphor, Weasley.”
beard.”
“I just need to grab a few things at home, and I’ll Floo over. Is six fine?”
Harry turned to him, scrubbing a hand up the back of his neck and into his hair. “Fucking hell, Malfoy. He knew what I said about him. He
“Or you could keep going. That’s also an option.”
“Might need you to lube him up while I keep the cheeks open,” Malfoy said.
Draco pulled at the sleeve of his jersey and wondered if this had been a huge mistake. “I need to let Ted know I’m here.”
He chucked a thumb towards the door.
If Draco wasn’t sitting with them, Potter would eventually seek him out, and Draco would unfailingly be looking at him when he did; and there’d be a raised eyebrow, and a quick jerk of the head: want to get out of here?
“Potter,” Malfoy said firmly, hanging his jacket. “Thank you for lunch, but I thought we agreed-”
Something dark and swooping came to life in Draco’s belly, and he fidgeted in his seat. He didn’t want to think about that. Thinking about Potter liking him was a guaranteed path to getting hurt.  “What’s the story with Finnegan, and Potter, and my Quidditch jersey?”
kidding me,” Draco hadn’t even seen Potter coming out of the tunnel behind the other children. He looked - hot, as always, but furious too, his eyes raking Draco up and down, looking at Ted still squirming under one arm as Draco let him carefully down again.
Harry laughed, but Draco’s pickle happened to be back in Harry’s mouth, and so Draco tried all his swears out again.
The very idea was ridiculous, Harry thought to himself, not for the first time, as he sat down and flipped open the first of the waiting files. Hermione’s constant fretting that he was becoming anti-social, was burying himself in his job as a way to avoid dealing with the world at large, and such apparently catastrophic issues as his status as a bachelor, had been steadily driving him up the wall.
"It's Sunday."
want nobody to ride Malfoy. You just don’t want anybody
Draco felt his face heat. “I hadn’t meant to snoop, you know. That thing was going bonkers with bells, and it said Andromeda, and I-”
“Morgan – report!”
beside the stove to use for kindling later. The used tea bag landed with a soggy plop in the rubbish bin under the sink, and Harry gave the cup a brief rinse. “Do you want a lift in? I’ve still got a Ministry car from that job last Tuesday.”
“So you’re using a veto for Smith?” Harry glared until Draco struck the pen through the name with a dramatic flourish. “Fine, consider him excommunicated.”
Harry said nothing, his cheeks burning. Malfoy put his glass on the table. “Potter. I know we don’t know each other very well, despite how long we’ve actually been acquainted. With that in mind, I want to assure you that you don’t have to answer this question if you don’t want to. But…” Malfoy paused, a line forming between his brows. “Are you alright, Potter? Did something happen to you, to make all this-” Malfoy waved his hand between them, “-problematic?”
“Kreacher, or Oliver?”
Blaised ushered him into the suite behind him. “When will you start calling me Blaise, old chap?”
“I’ve heard this hypothesis before,” Draco said, feeling his blush make a sneaking return up his neck. Potter smiled, one of his horrible, charming smiles, and brushed two fingers across Draco’s temple. “What was that?”
"Look, I've never asked you why you always cook roast lamb on a Sunday for lunch, have I? Or why you always make sure the shows I like are on the telly, or any of those things you do for me. Sometimes people just do things, alright? It doesn't always have to make sense!"
It wasn't really a question; or at least, it didn’t seem like Malfoy was in any doubt as to the answer. Martin was only too happy to step aside and usher Mr Malfoy and his guest right through, ignoring the catcalls and boos from the unhappy queuers left relegated to the chilly street for a while longer. Inside, the foyer smelled like every bar Harry had ever been to, Muggle or magical; a musty combination of stale cigarette, beer, and disinfectant. Malfoy stopped briefly at the ticket window and exchanged air kisses with a woman he called Darling. She beckoned Harry over and both he and Malfoy were duly stamped on the wrist with the club logo in vivid pink ink.
“There he is,” Malfoy said, inexplicably smiling. “Welcome back, Potter. So, if I may sum up; you understand that even exceptionally talented people aren’t brilliant at everything, and it doesn’t make them any less talented. You understand that sexuality is not black and white, and that needs, and relationships, change over time. You accept your friends without judgement and are evidently willing to defend them at the slightest provocation. And yet, you hold
Potter laughed, and shooed Cabbage Head off. “Maybe we could start with a drink and see where it takes us.”
“Maybe escort me out of my robes,” Draco didn’t manage to finish that thought, because Potter’s mouth was on his again.
“Harry’s making the Face.” Ginny said, going back to her bacon. “You broke him, Hermione.”
Harry expected his face was probably doing something dopey. “How do you know that’s what I had?”
Merlin’s tits.
"Missed you too love. Breakfast?"
Draco was
“I’m not saying I’d reciprocate.”
“What’s a Top Gun?”
Hermione made another apologetic face. “Make that three, actually.”
Ginny mashed a bit of grilled tomato onto her sourdough with glee. “I’m definitely fine with it. Not to make it weird, but if you ever need someone to, I don't know, hold the camera while you…”
Draco sucked on Potter’s neck, and pulled his shirt out of its neat tuck in his trouser waistband. “No, I’m clean, very, very clean. That’s the point.”
“Okay,” Potter said, ever the teacher. “You’ll need to take off your coat and hoodie, then I want you to stand right where you are with your feet slightly apart, and your arms loose beside you.” Draco did as he was told, shaking the coat from his shoulders and setting it to hover just away from them, and did the same to his jumper. He could feel Potter’s eyes on him as he arranged himself in the requested pose, the fine hairs on his arms prickling with it.
“I have a question,” Harry asked, his nose smushed into Draco’s chest. “Is Blaise shitting himself with envy supposed to be a good thing, or a bad thing?”
“Which is…?”
“Why didn’t you tell me?” Potter stepped closer, and Draco felt his shoulders come up defensively. “You could have told me you wanted something more from this.”
“I’m not begging – I’m ordering,” Draco pushed back against Potter’s cock and succeeded in catching the ridge of Potter’s cock on the very rim of his hole. Potter hissed. “There’s a difference between the two.”
somehow pull tonight? The other person might be disappointed when they got past the wonderpants and found that Harry was, in fact, just average in the cock department. On the other hand, what if a prospective pull got a look at the old, loose, snitch-and-broom patterned boxers he normally got around in...well, that would turn anybody off. “Jesus Christ,” Harry said, twisting to the side to get a view of how the jeans plastered themselves to both his arse and his crotch. He was going to get arrested for public indecency.
Potter slid a scrap of parchment with the codes across the counter and through the gap in the kiosk’s service window. He hadn’t quite removed his fingers before Draco plucked it up, and so for an electric microsecond, they were touching.
Draco blinked at him sullenly, and took a large swallow of his vodka and soda.
Longbottom shook his head, eyes a little vacant. “Dunno, but I’m not game enough to ask, either. She’s not to be crossed!” It was good to laugh. The water felt good, though it was cold. The sand shifted beneath his bare toes. “What about your mum, is she making arrangements for you?” Draco blew out a tight breath, and shook his head. “How come?”
“Only normal,” Ron said sadly. “I finished the pot the other night, and it’s been so hot I haven’t been bothered to go out and get another one.”
Malfoy threw back the last of his own drink, and rose to follow Harry into the throng.
. Time to stop thinking and start doing.
“You’re not thinking of Throttlebottom anymore though, are you.” He was forced to admit, he was not. “So. Anyone you fancy at the moment?”
“I’ll give
It took Draco several minutes to overcome his laughter, but at least Potter was in good spirits again. “Welcome to the world of senior management, Potter. You’ll soon learn that there is a bottomless pit of agitation and complaint in even the most seemingly content workplace. Someone is always missing out on cake, or stealing a stapler, and everybody wants to have their problem taken seriously. You can hope your staff have a little perspective, but not all of them can see past their own cubicle.”
Potter waved his hand dismissively. “Oh, have a day off, would you. What happened? The last time you made that face, we’d lost the bid for the 2015 Headless Hunt World Head Polo Championships to France.”
“Hmm?” Draco looked sharply back at the Weasley’s, who wore matching smirks. It was unsettling. “What?”
Potter said it softly, matter-of-factly. Sympathetically. He never asked anything of Draco, never expected anything of him. Draco couldn't look at him, and so focused his eyes on the faded teal and salmon patterns of the ancient parlour rug, and felt his stomach knot and twist.
It was all one Division, under Robards, technically. Being in the Potions unit made things a little easier. Potter and Weasley were both in Field, so it wasn’t like they’d ever be partners. But there was often overlap. Shared facilities. Potter was an early bird like Draco, so his morning workout, following the Thames run at dawn, often found them sharing the gym. Sometimes spotting one another on the weights, while indulging in some good-natured ribbing. Sometimes getting each other off as quietly as possible in the showers after. That was more recent. Six months. Draco swore under his breath, and told himself to stop obsessing over it. So it was six months, he’d been fucking Potter for six months. It didn’t mean anything. And he was going to stop.
“What time do you want me?”
All Draco could see now were Potter’s eyes. The very edge of Potter’s nose touched his, and Draco held his breath. “How could I possibly know that, when you haven’t even let me kiss you?”
“You need to talk to him, Draco,” Granger reached across the table and put her hand on his wrist. “He doesn’t understand why you suddenly cut him out, and he definitely has no idea you have feelings for him. Not like this.”
“Oh,” was all Harry managed. Malfoy took him by the shoulder and turned him back around, and pressed close against his back again. His long fingers closed around both of Harry’s hips this time, and when Malfoy’s lips came to rest ever so slightly against the lobe of one ear, he felt gooseflesh erupt along his neck.
“Good luck, Draco. Be careful.”
, Potter. Do we have to wait until five to eat?”
“In what universe do you think Hermione is going to let you get away with having a pint with me, while she’s stuck at home trying to feed, bathe and put to bed those two banshees you call children?”
Draco barely had time to wipe his wet hands on a nearby washcloth, before Bog was gone and the folded note was fluttering to the floor. His Seeker skills were not completely rusty, and he managed to snatch it up before it fell victim to a puddle of sparkling wine on the tile beside the tub.
It took hardly any time at all. The water slipping down his back, over the swell of his arse and between it. It was almost like meditation, the pounding spray thrumming around him, over his body, his focus moving with the water, with the touch of his hand. The slippery thickness of his hair at the nape of his neck, the smooth length of his throat, the tendons flexing there, the jut of his collarbone. The swell of his chest, his nipple hard under a fingertip. He found he liked that, in the hours he’d spent thinking about himself, touching himself instead of sleeping, imagining Malfoy’s voice in his ear like a wet dream, whispering  “Are you ready?” and “Is that what you like? A hard cock in your mouth, and a couple of digits sliding into your tight hole?”. He did like it. He wanted it all.
"It's okay."
A small argument erupted about who had broken Harry the most, today and cumulatively over the past twenty or so years, while Harry stared into his now nearly cold coffee. Was he the most oblivious wizard in England? How had be been such a successful Auror? How was he Head of Misuse now? Apparently, he couldn’t see clues that Seamus bloody Finnegan could see when he was barely out of short pants. He should be sweeping up owl shit in the Ministry mail room rather than any sort of law enforcement.
at it Potter? Gonna report back to the Ministry about how fabulously unprepared I am for muggle living, and how much of a wonderful punishment this is for me? Just add it to your regular weekly report card Potter -
“Yeah, somewhere,” Ginny said through a mouthful of Draco’s wine gums. “She’s probably off making a flower crown for her lion headdress, or something.”
Harry sat squashed between Dawlish and some other auror on the Knight Bus-style minivan that had so far carted their tired, sorry arses across Britain for seven days. And thought wistfully about crumpets with honey, and Draco. It was the going away parts that made him want to just pack in the Auror business entirely and live off his inheritance, never leaving Draco's side, never even leaving the house if he didn't want to. He'd wanted to be an Auror since he was a kid, and he loved his job, but being away from Draco
He’d been manipulated, but Harry couldn’t find it in himself to be genuinely annoyed. “Fine. But you’re in charge of dealing with his inevitable tantrums.”
“Great,” Draco said, dazed. “No idea what the fuck you’re talking about, but thanks for the vote of confidence, I guess. Anything else?”
you.”
There were no other customers in the shop, as far as Harry could tell, anyway. He approached an aisle and lifted the edge of a box which declared it contained a Frolicking Feather. Harry’s eyebrows climbed towards his hairline. “It does
“Yeah,” Harry said, “and raspberry sauce, enough so we can have some with ice cream tomorrow if you feel like it.” Not-Mousse was his easiest dessert, given it was really just a lot of whipped cream with some lovely dark chocolate melted in, and a great dollop of Nutella for good measure.
“I promise I’ll behave. I promise I won’t let them split us up. I promise,” Harry swallowed, nervous. This was something new, a line he hadn’t crossed before. “I don’t want another partner. I don’t want anyone else but you.” He thumbed gently at the inside of Malfoy’s wrists.
“Of course we can wait,” Hermione said, in her calmest and gentlest tone. “Let’s find a table and order, and then you can tell us whatever you feel comfortable telling us.”
Draco hesitated a beat. “I’ll swap you some wine gums for a couple of the orange creams. I’ve also got Skips.”
“You’re very cranky,” Potter said. “I think you need a holiday.”
Draco held Harry a little tighter. “And you never will.” He kissed Harry on the top of his head. “Come on, let's do that last room.”
Draco gave him two fingers. “What could we possibly need a civilian consultant for—”
. Even if it’s your underpants, just err on the side of caution and make it green. Pierce?”
This time, for once, he wasn't thinking either of Pansy, or who was on the program tonight. Draco was thinking about how to make those planned conversations happen, or, one of them at least - how to talk to Potter and say things to him about what he was feeling. He'd thought about it
“No, you did not.” Andromeda’s voice was stern, but Harry thought he could detect a little amusement, there. No doubt Tonks had got up to equally ridiculous shenanigans as a kid.
Ron threw his hands up. “Do you see what I’m dealing with here, Harry. No respect.”
“Muffaletta sandwiches,” Malfoy said, as Harry sat down opposite him. “I made them myself.”
He sent the memo fluttering away, and pulled a roll of parchment closer to him. Draft regulations for the proposed national Exploding Snap championships. They promised to be both long and tedious. Draco smiled again, and dipped his quill in green ink. He loved his job.
Malfoy led Harry to a corner alcove, just big enough to fit three at a squeeze on a battered leather bench, and with a small table. Even so, Harry was painfully conscious of where Malfoy’s limbs were located, though Malfoy seemed not to notice.
Longbottom nodded. “Are you looking?”
“I meant sexy, of course.”
Potter stared hard at him in silence, then nodded. “Alright. I believe you.”
Well, that just made Harry feel even sweatier. A drink would be welcome. Five would be even more welcome, actually.
“Ugh,” Draco scratched a hand through his hair. “It just means I don’t do casual. I don’t sleep around, have lots of flings. You were different.” Draco looked away. “It’s not that I wanted to be a casual thing with you, more that I decided I couldn’t live with not knowing what you’d be like. Since I’d wanted you for such a long time. I thought I’d be able to manage it, going in with no expectation of more than sex, but,” Draco lifted his chin, and met Potter’s eyes. “I should have known better than that, since I already had too many deeper feelings about you before I ever touched you. I wasn’t careful with my emotions, and eventually I cracked.”
Potter took off his glasses, and rubbed his eyes. “Okay. So there are several things I want to address here. Firstly, why are you saying ‘canoe’ so often? Secondly, I’m sure you cope well enough with the green, considering how well you managed being all but smothered in it in Slytherin house for all those years in school, and don’t pretend you don’t know very well that it suits you. And third, doesn’t Scrivener understand that my risk reports are just recommendations for improvements? I mean, nearly all of the problems I identify with any given proposal can be easily rectified with a few amendments. In fact, the only proposal I’ve opposed outright in recent memory was the reinstatement of the Tri-Wizard Tournament, which in hindsight sounds a lot like it might have been one of your dummy suggestions to use up one of the Undersecretary’s two ‘no’s...”
“Sir?” Vicky stood at the door, a cup of tea in hand. Harry felt his ears redden. “Shall I come back at a better time?”
Teddy’s hand clenched in Draco’s hair again. “You’re not going to swear at him again, are you?”
Teddy mulled this over. “Nan and Auntie C told me I had to stop talking about my farts.” Draco pursed his lips for a long moment before responding.
him.” Draco raked a hand through his hair, and tried to hold on to his dignity. “Am I supposed to keep fucking him in the shadows then, too? Waiting my turn?”
. You will
weird. I’ve watched you do it a million times, you kick off your slippers when you come into the bedroom, and they go every which way around the room because you’re completely uncivilised, and then in the morning you put them back on again, but even if the left one is perfectly positioned to just slip straight onto your foot, and the right one is like, upside down and half under the bed, you always put the right one on first!”
“Yeah, well...I stopped seeing him a couple of months ago, like I said. I was trying not to get hurt, because I was certain he didn’t want anything more than a casual fuck. I didn’t know how to deal with it, so I just started avoiding him everywhere all the time until he got the idea.”
After all, he’d made such a big deal about Perkins being the expert, even though that had been an exaggeration, so he could hardly backtrack now. The fact that Potter had addressed the memo to him was purely because he was the senior officer in Potions Division, and thus was in charge of distribution of cases and allocation of work. So, really, there was no reason to question Draco’s decision to delegate accordingly.
Harry closed his eyes, and used every ounce of his willpower to pull away. “Draco, what if we - what if this-”
Harry gulped his drink. He wasn’t sexy. He wore cardigans and lab coats, and frumpy old pants with snitches on them. Who in their right mind would find that sexy?
Potter moaned theatrically. “Unf. There’s something about you when you’re barking orders, Malfoy.” That was about all Potter had time to say, because Draco had decided to shut him up directly with his tongue. Draco could feel Potter’s grin against his own lips, and so bit down, nipping Potter’s lower lip ever so slightly between sharp teeth, and grinning himself at the squawk of protest.
“Can’t say.”
“Tell us about the nude pictures, Draco.”
“Just doing my part,” Potter grinned. “There was a hair.”
“You’re useless,” Malfoy snapped eventually. He twisted, snatched the tie from Harry’s hand, and unrolled it with a hard snap of his wrists.
"Get a hold of yourself, boy. People will start thinking you're queer."
“This is the King Dong,” Malfoy said, ever so calmly, while Harry’s eyebrows made a break for his hairline. “Go ahead and touch it.” Harry looked at Malfoy, alarmed, and Malfoy gave him another of those slow smiles. “Feel the difference in temperature.”
“I know why,” Blaise said, knowingly. “Potter likes him. Draco wants to send him some pictures that’ll make up for whatever fool thing he went and said last night.”
Malfoy wandered out of the bedroom wearing Harry’s tshirt, and his famous silken robe.
Malfoy’s face widened into a grin, a sure sign he was about to start rinsing Harry mercilessly. “You
Draco was holding up a dark grey, leopard print jumper, that Harry had ordered from the 2009 winter collection because it had looked amazing on the model, but when it had arrived it just seemed busy and weird. He held it up against himself, and then looked at Harry incredulously. “This is my size!”
Draco looked from Granger down to his tumbler of gin and cucumber. He hated that, too. “Unlike Socrates, I’m not quite ready to sacrifice my cock to Asclepius, unfortunately.”
“No fuck,” Harry said. “Sleep.”
“It looks like we don’t currently stock the Sensual Lover,” Malfoy said. “I’m sure it’ll be the Sensual Lover, rather than the King Dong. From what I could see from the
Draco coughed on a mouthful of desiccated rice. “I — what? What are you— we’re not—”
Potter wandered down the short hall, and into the sitting room, looking at everything, touching things. “You have a mobile, now.” Not a question. Draco shrugged one shoulder as casually as he could manage. “Do you know where I was when I got your first message?” Potter didn’t wait for an answer. “Afternoon tea with your aunt and cousin. I dropped the phone right into a devilled egg, and said a couple of words that were not appropriate for children.”
Potter shrugged, just a lift of one shoulder, casual. “You’re here.”
He turned, bemused. “Why would I be uncomfortable?” Draco lifted his arms, as if to encompass Bellatrix, and Lucius, and all their school years. Longbottom snorted, and looked back out at the horizon. “Get over yourself. We’re friends, you dull bugger.” He took a deep breath, and shook himself sharply. “I’m getting out. M’freezing my buds off, and there’ll be no fruits on my vine, either, at this rate.” Longbottom started to wade back to the beach. “Don’t get hypothermia.”
Harry did.
“You memorised my schedule, Malfoy? I’m flattered.”
“Sorry sir, thank you. The files you requested are on your desk. Can I interest you in a cup of tea?”
” she said loudly, and with great gusto, and Ron made more gagging noises that threatened to follow through. “Anyway, why aren’t you speaking to him anymore?”
“Thank you, sweetheart.” Three years together, two of them living under the same roof, and four months engaged, and Draco still turned the most gorgeous shade of pink whenever Harry called him that.
It felt like forever before Potter finished. When his hands let go of Draco’s wrists, finally, he felt abruptly cold, and then the embarrassment of being half-hard set in. Draco quickly Summoned his hoodie and coat again, throwing them on as fast as he could manage while remaining faced away from Potter. “Any joy?”
“Oh my god, that would be another variety of ours. My eyes, your hair, can you see it?”
Harry closed his office door behind him and wrinkled his nose at the immediate and sour odour of ink, no doubt originating from the tall stack of files now residing on his desk. If Harry disliked one thing about his job, it was the paperwork; but then, he never had been particularly fond of it, not as an Auror and certainly not when he was at school. What he had learned, however, was that if he buckled down and got it done, he could play for as long as he liked in the lab without various department heads breathing down his neck about late reports. He
“Your tatt,” Own-brand Potter said, pointing at the Dark Mark.
make tea, which is a start, and I worked out how to make some juice by squeezing it myself. I've been practicing all week. And fruit salad, that's easy 'cause all you have to do is peel and slice really. I thought about eggs, but I figured more could go wrong there than go right, so I settled on toast instead. Those muggle contraptions make it hard not to fuck it up, once you work out the dials, and plugs. I wasted a bit of bread, but the birds don't seem to mind charcoaled toast…" His voice trailed off, and he gestured proudly to the kitchen table. "What do you think? Is it a good welcome home surprise?"
Easing himself onto his elbows, Harry looked at his third chosen item - the prostate one - and tried to convince himself to have one last go. Maybe those other things had just not been right for him. Maybe he’d just wanked off far too much already. With determination, he spread his legs and carefully lubed one finger, gently opening himself just enough for the slender wand of the tickler to soon slip inside. He felt his cock begin to firm up again. An encouraging sign.
“I will kill,” Draco seethed, slotting a finger through the envelope flap with fury, “every last one of them if I’m being called in again.”
! Right there!"
“I’ve missed you,” Potter said against his mouth. “Nobody argues with me in meetings like you do. And they’re all rubbish at sparring.” He pushed his hips down, and pressed his cock against Draco’s, which was hard between them. “My sheets don’t smell like you anymore, and I hate it.”
,” Harry replied. “I don’t need that visual. It’s confusing and arousing, and I don’t like it.”
He slid his fingers between Draco's cheeks, the butter sliding easily over his skin, and the first finger slipped inside his body effortlessly. Draco moaned and pulled at their cocks even harder, an expression of blissful pleasure on his face. The second finger entered him with an easy glide, Draco's hole virtually sucking on his fingers, and it was no time before he was practically fisting him, three fingers in, two of which were circling his spot, butter melted and dripping all the way to his elbow and smeared over every inch of Draco's crack.
“Yes!”
Harry made a face. “What are you talking about? It’s only been about twenty minutes.” Ginny picked up her paper serviette and covered her face, making a weird hooting sound that might have been laughter.
He wrestled off his slightly muddy and leafy outer robe as he eagerly headed for the kitchen, catching sight of himself in the hall mirror on the way. He frowned at the foliage in his hair but was too impatient to do anything about it. Yanking open the door which led to the dining room and adjoining kitchen, he allowed the ridiculous grin he'd been restraining all morning to run wild across his face.
“Ouff, yesssss,” Ginny rubbed her hands together, as Hermione took the pasta salad out of the fridge. “I was hoping you’d make this, Harry.”
The pub was noisy, but not so much that they couldn’t hear each other. “Probably be in Mungo’s tonight if you hadn’t blocked that last hex.”
Draco sneered. “I agree, you’ve been
“And now she’s shacked up with…?”
Potter entered the room with two glasses of water.
Potter led the way when they reached Mysteries, ushering Draco down the stairs which led to Level 10 and the courtrooms, then down another to Level 11. They each pressed their wands to the heavy iron door, and the access permits activated after a long, considered moment, allowing the door to swing open on creaking, aged hinges. The vibration of the ward magic was enough to rattle his teeth and set every hair on end, and Draco could see Potter grimace at the sensation as well, from his peripheral. The magic felt very old, and very, very powerful, and the room seemed to shimmer with it. “This way.” Potter touched Draco’s elbow lightly, and directed him towards a spot that, to Draco, seemed exactly like any other in the vast room. “Just here.”
When the box had been placed on his bed and enlarged from the size of a matchbox to the size of his old Hogwarts trunk, and Harry had eased back the lid, it took him several long moments to absorb what he was looking at. Fucking hell. It looked like there was one of everything from Malfoy’s shop, or at the very least, one of everything from the dildo aisle.
"Because you like it."
he thought he'd see there, her face…no. A bright, white-haired older man, sort of informally interviewing people, like Stephen Fry, and Michael Flatley, and Sir David Attenborough. He liked it, and Potter made sure it was always on at ten thirty on a Saturday evening.
“Have you got dust in your ears?” The family resemblance was uncanny. Draco looked terribly cranky.  “Our children. Teddy. Rosie and Hugo, should they fall on hard times.” He lifted a sheet that lay over a gilded, silk upholstered chair. “Some of it’s sentimental and family history, but some of it could be sold for quite a few galleons, if the need should arise.”
Draco had shuddered. “God, no. I want front row seats even less than Ron does.” Harry snorted, because that was certainly not accurate. “Anyway, there’s only one spare up there after we converted the other into the walk-in and expanded the ensuite, and I think it’s full of my shoes, anyway.”
Ted leaned heavily into Draco’s side. He was almost ten, and growing like a weed. Draco pulled him in for a proper hug. “I’m sorry I’ve disappointed you, little man.”
Draco lifted his flannel to his face, rubbing it over his neck and chin, before dropping it back into the water. They hardly spoke, not that there was any anger between them. Draco spent the hours of the day reading, books about potions and old family histories. It was indulgent, and he was contributing nothing to Potter's household. But Potter never asked anything of him, not even for company, although Draco could see that Potter would have dearly liked his company. And Draco never gave him anything, except a sort of silent companionship, which seemed to please Potter in some small way - almost as if he were just glad Draco hadn't left entirely. Draco had never said thank you. But he wanted to. He thought about it during most of his spare time. He composed things he might say, in his head, and what Potter might say back, and what his face might look like while they talked. He thought often of Potter's face. And Potter's hands. Draco lifted his own hands out of the water, and held the pruny fingers in front of his eyes, frowning. His fingers had always been long, and slender, and slightly pointed and aristocratic, like the rest of him. They were roughened now, a little, from the work at Hogwarts. But Potter's fingers were stronger. They looked capable of anything. Draco lowered his hands and let them disappear below the surface. He'd found himself looking at Potter's hands rather too often as well.
“Harry,” Ginny complained. “The hand was mine, why did you waste a high trump when I already
Draco raised his eyebrows in amusement. “You think I’m that devious? How dare you.” Potter made a face. “Seriously though, I really appreciate this.”
. You’ve got that look on your face.”
“Secondly, his little mate works at The Pheasantry Cafe at Bushy, and he always gives him an extra sausage with his full English.”
“Sort of. Not just here. I’m testing this place out for a couple of weeks, but I think I’ve already fished this catchment to exhaustion.” He picked at the beer mat with his thumb. “I’ll give it another week, I think.”
“Maybe I shouldn’t Silence it after all. Give Malfoy an excuse to flash his pants at you again, and slap you about a little bit.”
Draco stared at it, his eyes widening in horror. “Oh good grief. It does, doesn’t it.” He rubbed a hand over his face. “This explains why Orange Robes was so determined to get his lips on it, at least.”
“Standard operating procedure, Potter, don’t get excited. You’re still a ranking officer, and it’s my duty to at least make a show of checking that you’re not about to be poisoned.”
“Why,” Ron said warily.
“Not long now,” Potter sighed into his neck, his breath hot and moist. “Gonna make a mess of you, Malfoy. I know you love it,” Potter’s fingers tightened around Draco’s, and Draco was whining now. “You love it when I come into your office and make a mess…you love the crumbs, and the bent paperclips…you love it when I stack files crookedly, you love to come along and fix it all up, don’t you?” Draco cried out, a wordless agreement. “You love it most when I make you sweat, make you drip, cover you in spit, lube, when I come on you and in you, and it drips down your skin -
to a friend's birthday.
"You're welcome. But it isn't me you should be thanking. Its Alma Fivepennies you need to say it to."
Harry licked his lips. “Him.”
oyster forks.
“Or if you’d rather someone non-magical, there’s a new dentist at my father’s surgery who is very fit, and very available. He has excellent teeth, of course.”
“Come here or I’m coming over, and I’ll ruin your dinner.”
“Remember you said that,” Potter said ruefully, as he came fully into Draco’s office, and stood beside his chair. “Trust me?”
A platinum christening cup.
Malfoy wasn’t exaggerating about the crowd. As they sat there, their bottle rapidly draining between them, Harry watched the patrons pouring in like a sweaty, heaving wave. It was packed, the horde three deep, or worse, all along the sprawling bar, and the dance floor was a wall of barely clothed bodies and cheap perfume. He rolled the last, thick mouthful of mead around on his tongue. He’d become used to the kick, now, and the bottle had not been large, but the mead was potent and Harry couldn’t describe himself as sober just at the moment. They’d drunk rather a lot in a short span.
Harry had shrugged. “That can’t be helped. This is where the bedrooms are, unless you want them up on the fourth, with us?”
Draco smiled even more widely, and shook his head. “No. Of course you don’t. I’m sure this was the very first time.” Draco resumed his original course toward his own office, and Potter jogged along the hall to catch up.
“Agreed,” Draco said, pulling some parchment from his pocket again. “Can you use that to pinpoint a location.”
Harry realised he’d said that last bit out loud, and cleared his throat. “Yes, Malfoy, but there are other variables to consider. Do we start with the vagina or anus, do we use lube, do we test the original dildo only or also some from the bushes, do we use the King Dong as a control - it’s not just a matter of sticking it in and thrusting it around.”
Then he pressed send, and flung himself face down on the bed with a muffled scream.
“Anything else I can do to help?”
“Don’t you dare-”
“Do you actually have a point you’re trying to make, Malfoy?” Harry said, through gritted teeth.
“Mmm, but you’re not just colleagues, Malfoy. You’re former rivals that were obsessed with each other, and friends in that weird, competitive, hypermasculine way, and co-godparents, and also fucking each other on a regular basis.” She leaned forward and rested her elbows on her knees. “Did I miss anything?”
“Oh,” Draco said again. Bewildered. “Yeah.”
place. You’ve never offered. You never asked. Why would I think I was welcome?”
“Good boy?” Malfoy had absolutely no business looking so virtuous, when saying something with such wicked innuendo.
“No.”
That got a snort from Malfoy, and Harry looked up at him quickly and away again. “So what happened next, Potter?”
“I want you to do something for me, Potter. The horde is about to be let into the club, and it’s going to be humid, and loud, and filled to the brim with half-nude strangers who are here for the music but also are largely here to find someone to get off with. I want you to come out there with me, right into the thick of it, and just look. See how they react to you - they’re Muggles, so it's not going to be your reputation, or your magic. It’s going to be just you. Just Harry.”
“I suppose you think that was clever,” Potter said, raw, hot against Draco’s back, his mouth on Draco’s ear.
“Charlie,” Ron said, spearing a dumpling savagely. “I’ve got scars too, you know!”
“Why are you so proud of that,” Ginny asked, looking disgusted. “What’s wrong with it, that it’d be so memorable? Is it a funny colour, or just very small?”
“I’m a cheese man.” Harry grinned, and cupped Draco’s backside. “Nothing I like more than a big, round bocconcini.” Draco rolled his eyes, laughing as he pulled away with one last kiss to retrieve the pasta bowls, and the fine grater. “You know, my middle name is actually cheese. It’s true. James is short for Jarlesberg, you know.”
“As I was
Harry had also managed to find himself a pair of underpants that weren't too embarrassing - once again, thanks to his annual Christmas gift from Hermione, to go with the sensible ties and socks. Not that he was expecting anything to happen, to meet someone and have it get to the stage where underpants were being revealed. It was a practical issue, really. The jeans were so tight, and sort of low rise. Harry looked like a proper muppet with his normal cotton boxers spilling out over the waistband like foam on a pint. These pants of Hermione’s were also quite tight, and lower cut than he was used to. The thick waistband had some designers name on it, nobody Harry knew (which didn’t say much), and could just be seen wrapping around his hips beneath the jet black denim. They were doing interesting things to Harry’s bits, as well. The pants had sort of
Right. He was already a little bit hard just from the thought of playing with Malfoy’s toys, so he wasted no further time, uncapped his lube, and took himself firmly in hand.
Drinking so much on a Thursday was folly, and Draco was now paying for it with a hangover from the deepest bowels of hell. That was probably how he managed not to notice Potter until the man himself was leaning casually on the counter of his kiosk, heart attack inducing smile and all.
“You should try to come. People have missed you at Friday drinks.”
over their heads protectively. “What the hell is going on?”
Givenchy didn’t deserve the rough handling Draco was currently giving his, in his hurry to cover himself up. “Didn’t I tell you to get fucked already?”
, Harry couldn’t really say what, exactly, but it made him feel slightly giddy. “That’s the strange part, it looks really familiar,” Malfoy murmured, and Harry started to feel hot again. “I’ve definitely seen this before but I can’t quite place it.” Malfoy’s hair was clipped short at the nape of his neck, but was sort of long at the top, and he wore it flicked off to the right in a kind of deliberately tousled sweep. Harry had spent a lot of time staring at Malfoy during school, but rarely this close. His hair was still the silvery blond that Harry remembered, and his eyebrows were very dark, and thick, as were his lashes. It made Harry wonder what the rest of Malfoy’s hair would be like - his eyes dropped to Malfoy’s hands, one of which he’d raised to his lips and now rubbed his fingers absently against. Harry swallowed. Malfoy had the faintest of fine silver hair on the backs of this hands-
“I think I can manage.” Draco stepped down finally, and revealed he was carrying a large pad of paper and a biro. “Since you’re stuck here for a while, I thought it might be a good time to look at one of those lists.”
He turned and ran for the Floo before any of the hexes were able to hit him.
Harry shook his head. “C.U.M. – the Citizens United against the Ministry.”
Harry tossed the tie on his desk. Now he was starting to get pissed off as well. “Well, it doesn’t affect you, Malfoy, so I don’t know why you’re being such a fucking bitch about it.”
“Draco. You’re looking delectable as always.” Clementine grinned back at Malfoy, and then cocked her head at Harry. “And this is…?”
“Please stay and talk to me about this.”
Harry’s brain simply shorted out, then.
“Everything,” Draco said, raw, and felt a spike of panic. That was giving away more than he intended.
Well...“There are. The issue is, the state of them.” Oh, the
, but he was also pragmatic. He had basic needs which had to be met, and he wasn’t too proud to settle.
. Draco nodded, and sat.
“The kids?” Harry looked up from a portrait of someone blond and grumpy, with an enormous ruffled collar.
“Yeah,” Draco exhaled. Potter leaned in, putting his rough-tipped fingers on Draco’s jaw.
“I suppose I must have, once or twice.” He put down his biro - possibly his favourite of all Muggle inventions - and stretched, flexing his shoulders until he felt them pop. “What are you still doing here?”
“The poison,” Ron finished. Harry nodded.
"Cup of tea?"
“Minister Shacklebolt – to what do I owe-”
Without moving his hands or reaching for his wand, or so much as blinking, Potter had the office door slam shut, and the lock slid home with an audible click shortly after. “Any other objections?” Potter’s voice was soft and a little rough. Draco shook his head once, and closed his eyes as Potter’s lips met his.
at all three, whisking away the sticky lube. Another swish and flick, and a tarp was settling neatly on top of the whole lewd collection. For the first time in a long time, Harry locked the door of the lab behind him, and charmed it to open strictly to his magical signature. The very last thing he needed was the weekend custodian stumbling in and lodging a formal complaint with Facilities.
When Potter dragged him down to the floor, Draco at least had the presence of mind to pull a handful of towels with him; he dropped into the spot between Potter’s chest and bicep like he was designed specifically to fit there, and shoved a towel upwards in the general direction of Potter’s face. Quite half-heartedly, he swiped at his own torso, and he could feel Potter doing the same; his arse was aching in the best sort of way, and all Draco wanted to do was stay just as they were, forgetting the house elves who had been so rudely evicted, the mess they had made, forgetting the journalists and families, and staff, and Scrivener, all of whom should still be milling about the grounds of St Adjutor’s.
Potter looked at him seriously. “I’m flirting with you in a very direct and cheesy way. I’ve tried to win you over with subtlety, but you seem determined to ignore me.”
Draco stopped in his tracks, and his hands were tight on Harry’s shoulders, and his eyes were fever bright. “Maybe we can manage a quickie after all. Potter,
Helena’s tits. What the fuck had happened? Weasley knew better than to contact him on leave. They’d had a talk about it. They’d had several. Draco was in dire need of a break and Weasley had promised him there was nothing the department couldn’t handle without him while he was away. “Maybe someone really is dead,” Draco murmured, squinting at the elf again, who remained standing silently by the bed, staring at him.
Draco rubbed the back of his neck. “I don’t...sleep around. I believe in,” Draco cleared his throat. “Romance. Monogamy. Building something that lasts.”
Draco bit his lip happily and practically skipped to Harry's side, grabbing him by the arm and escorting him to his chair. He shook out the napkin and tucked it carefully into Harry's collar, smoothing it flat over his chest. He poured a china cup full of tea and a goblet full of juice, and filled a bowl full of salad. He counted out four slices of toast and transferred them to his plate, and proceeded to coat them with criminal amounts of butter. Harry simply sat there, in mind-numbing arousal, and tried not to let his mouth hang open. Draco had made him breakfast, and naked. Draco had been practicing all week so that he could get it right, so he could have a special welcome home surprise. He felt so fuzzily happy and in love he almost couldn't operate.
“She probably doesn’t even remember giving it to me,” Draco pursed his lips.
,” said Ron again.
This wasn’t that kind of problem. This was the kind of problem where Draco had fucked his life, as thoroughly as he’d fucked Potter’s body, and no matter what he did next the retreat would tear chunks of him off in the process.
Draco felt sick. He was being dismissed. This wasn’t an offer to stay the night, to curl up together, to rest together, to touch each other again until they couldn’t stop. Potter was grateful for his services with Weasley, Potter showed his appreciation with a little more warmth than usual, but in the end, when everyone had come, it was time for Draco to go home. Nothing was changing, except maybe Draco was becoming even more of a fucking idiot over time.
The silence grew long and uncomfortable. “You wouldn’t understand.”
Harry took a final swallow of water and pushed the glass back into Draco’s hands, and flourished dramatically, wandlessly drying all the mess from the bed, which included the water, the sweat, and several less savoury deposits best left unmentioned.
an idiot, anyway.”
“’Morning, Vicky.”
Draco jogged down the wooden steps of the stand, doing his best not to look anywhere but where his feet were going. He wouldn’t look for Potter in the stands. It didn’t matter where he was. He needed Teddy to see he was here, and that he stayed the whole day. He made it to the mouth of the the players entrance just as kids were starting to pour out.
his cock and balls, and pushed them together and forward, not ungently, until he was sporting a fairly impressive bulge at the front.
Harry stared at himself hard in the mirror. And not the regular mirror either, not the one which hung above the sink in his bathroom, which always
Draco gave Potter a small smile. There wouldn’t be a ‘later’, Draco could already tell. “I’ll see you then.”
They queued for the Floo, other discharged patients and departing guests looking at them curiously. Ron was grinning widely, too widely for a man who had a visibly battered Harry Potter clinging to his shoulder. “I knew it! This explains so many things from when we were partners. I can’t wait to tell Hermione.”
“Okay,” Harry said suddenly, before he could talk himself out of it. “Let’s go out.”
“One kink at a time, Malfoy,” Potter said.
“Er...thanks, Devlin. You shouldn’t have?”
“Being in love with an uncommunicative idiot who takes you for granted and never tells you what you mean to him until you basically hate him?” She rolled her eyes. “Yeah, sure. No idea what that’s like.” Granger sighed, and signalled for the elf again, and asked for a glass of sparkling water. “Listen, I know it’s none of my business. And I realise that I don’t really have a history of respecting other people’s boundaries, so I say this with full self-awareness.” When the elf had been and gone again, she continued. “I think you’re making a mistake with how you’re handling things with Harry. And Teddy,” Draco nearly stood up, but Granger held up one hand. “Please, let me finish. Teddy only has three living blood relatives, and all he knows right now is that one of them would rather be at the office than spend time with him.”
“Oh, alright, fine. Mungo’s.”
“Clementine,” Malfoy smiled widely at the nearest bartender, leaning against the polished benchtop.
onto the grimy rear windscreen of a parked van.
“Hey.” Malfoy slotted in beside him, and Harry choked only very lightly on his drink. “You alright?”
“First of all, I’ll have you know my arse is far from spotty — it’s perfect in every way. Poems have been written about it. Songs, even. I’ve heard a rumour of a sculpture. And secondly, my perfect arse should be somewhere hot and foreign, where I should be getting my equally perfect cock sucked by person or persons also hot and foreign.” Draco folded his arms over his chest and applied his best glare. “So this had better be good,
Draco was silent for a few moments, just watching him work. Ladle, stir, stir, stir. “You know, that whole incident with Smith was when I realised I’d fallen in love.”
Ron looked sheepish. “Please come back to the Aurors. I’m begging you.”
Draco hadn’t stopped urging Potter on, and finally Potter replaced his fingers with his prick again, pressing against Draco like a delicious threat. With a low hiss, Potter pushed in, and Draco actually laughed, a stuttering, breathy noise.
The pissing noise stopped, but sadly, a very long and loud, and slightly echo-y fart replaced it. Malfoy clenched his fingers around his wand.
Giant, sweet, gooey centre. Harry couldn’t keep the smile off his face. “Come and give me a kiss.”
“Just, what you said about when you came out. Sounds like it was a bad time.”
Harry stared at them. “Could we please get back to the bit where you started laying odds about me and Malfoy getting involved?”
Hermione sighed loudly, and unpacked the spring rolls. “If you die, Harry, I’m genuinely worried Ron will leave me for Malfoy.”
“We’re going to talk about this later, you know,” Draco gasped between long kisses. “You can’t just fuck me every time you want to change the subject.”
“Have a day off, Malfoy,” Potter kissed him again, and again, and again.
up there looking out for him, then Malfoy had plans, imminent plans, to
Draco looked at him, and narrowed his eyes. Potter's team was in Sourton. “I’m sure Agatha is perfectly happy with her assignment. Who wouldn’t prefer an exciting field assignment to plankton duty?”
Draco rolled his eyes. “No, with Smith - yes, you, fool. Merlin preserve us.”
His mobile was ringing. His mobile almost never rang. It was strictly for emergencies. Why was his mobile ringing?
Draco smirked. “I’m not calling you a liar, calm down. I’m saying I didn’t believe you could possibly have presented any type of sorting challenge, since you’re basically solid gold Gryffindor to the very core. But after seeing these shenanigans with Blaise...” He shook his head. “I’m starting to think the old hat may have been onto something.”
“Good. Then last additions, I want Oliver Wood, because I think he might hit it off with Rahim, and Kreacher.”
“Terrific,” Draco said darkly.
They discussed the logistics of a Malfoy-Granger-Weasley throuple over the rest of the rainbow beef, and by the time the last of the sweet and sour pork was likewise finished, they’d determined it probably wouldn’t end well, so Harry had better outlive the lot of them so it would never come to pass.
Once the children were safely buckled into the Granger’s car and away on their own adventure, the grown ups came through the hearth before setting off in Harry’s, stopping briefly to pick up Ginny at her flat in Strawberry Hill.
to talk to him about this.”
His first
The front hallway was a labyrinth of boxes.
"Sorry?"
“Yeah.” Harry abandoned the spoon and turned the heat off, and used both arms to finally gather Draco to him properly. “Dinner’s ready. Do you want parmesan on top?”
Harry flicked his nail against the ring pull on the can. “Don’t get excited. Ted had an accident, jumping off the roof to impress Victoire, and landed himself in Mungo’s with two broken arms and a concussion. Not to mention the teeth.”
a good boy, and he felt so good, and that he’d always known Harry would be so sweet and tight, and
It was hard to decide what was worse - that his friends had been betting on his love life; that they’d recognised something about Harry literally decades before he’d recognised it himself; that if he’d had a bit more of a clue, he might have been able to
“Yeah.” A flash of Malfoy pulling him into his arms in the laneway had gooseflesh racing up Harry’s arms. He stared at his eggs. Why had he ordered so much food? He should have stuck with something sensible like yoghurt and a pastry, like Hermione. He couldn’t possibly eat this. “We went out to a nightclub for a bit. A Muggle place I’ve never been before, somewhere one of his mate’s owns.”
There was movement on the pitch. The six teams of children were clustered in the centre with their coaches, one of whom was apparently Potter, receiving a pre-game lecture on safety and good sportsmanship. A whistle blew sharply, and four of the teams raced off to sit in their designated places on the sidelines, while the remaining two groups mounted brooms and got in the air, some of them a bit wobbly. It looked like Teddy wasn’t in the first round, so Draco concentrated on unwrapping his chocolate and not looking over at the barely visible back of Potters head. “So, Lovegood’s here?” Lovegood was alright. He could look at her without wanting to vomit, these days, and she was as dizzy and kind as she ever was.
“Fine.” Potter clenched his jaw, and started taking things from his pockets. Keys, a mobile, a packet of cigarettes all tossed onto the coffee table. “Let’s start with your outfit. Did Seamus put you up to it?”
But she wasn’t going to be able to fuck him the way he’d truly like, at the end of the day. None of her sort could. So, the fantasy of a wife he could tolerate and the production of at least one Malfoy heir to satisfy his mother was enjoyable, but brief, and Draco thanked her for her time and effort, and used a little wandless to whisk away the wet patch on her sheets before he left. A courtesy, the least he could do. She would never have been suitable, anyway. Muggle.
Draco flung his arms away from himself to gesture around the crammed bedroom. “Hundreds of thousands of pounds - a
Potter just stood there, calm and unreadable, his hand clamped like iron around Draco's wrist and keeping him there when he'd rather have been running the hell away.
“What sort of bird,” Ginny asked, as if she couldn’t have guessed.
Harry brushed his lips against Draco’s ear, his mouth wet. “Maybe you’ll have to give me a detention later.” Draco gasped, and his cock twitched unmistakeably. Harry raised an eyebrow and felt his own pulse racing. “
“Yeah. You’re determined to be a lonely idiot.”
Eventually Harry conjured himself a stool, and a comfy recliner for Andromeda, leaving Malfoy the standard visitors chair, and Malfoy went and got them all some treats from the canteen, prawn cocktail crisps, chocolate tartlets, and lemon drop biscuits, and a couple of cold cans of Muggle orange fizzy drink, which they sipped out of transfigured cups. Draco gave Ted a big kiss too, and sternly told him he needed to be much more careful in future, as Draco was counting on Teddy to look after him when he was a grumpy old man, which made Ted giggle and Draco grin. Harry loved them so much he felt nearly sick with it.
“You literally suggested I go for a nap and then
“No,” Theo rolled his eyes. “Just out last night, and he was too drunk to go home on his own.”
There was a very particular set of sensations which always accompanied a visit to the Burrow. There was the ever present smell of something cooking, and a delicious sort of warmth to the air no matter what the weather was outside. The chairs always felt more comfortable there, squashier, softer, like well-worn tracksuit bottoms. And the inevitable feeling that followed eating far too much, a sleepy contentment that made it possible to ignore how tight the waistband of your trousers had become. Ron wasn’t even pretending to put on airs; his shirt was entirely untucked, with a noticeable drip of gravy on the front, and Harry could only thank the hem of it for saving him from the sight of Ron’s now unbuttoned jeans, and pale, distended belly. Nothing could save any of them from Ron’s belching, however, which he was blaming unconvincingly on the local bullfrog population.
Harry pressed his fingers hard into Draco’s hip bones. “Call me stupid again, I’m really close.”
Harry rolled his eyes, and handed over the keys. “You’re a few days late returning one little Volkswagen and the administration is ready to toss you in Azkaban.”
“Pay attention, please.” Draco slid a thin folio of research notes into his satchel, and fastened the clasp. “Forget about what I said last night.”
Draco was to stay with Potter for awhile. He had no place else to go, no family left, no home for him at Hogwarts anymore. With the exception of the elf he employed, Potter lived alone and had plenty of space for guests. Draco arrived at Number Twelve, Grimmauld Place at tea time the following Monday. His luggage, the small amount that he had, was shrunken and kept in his left trouser pocket.
It was warm, and drugging. Potter’s hands pressed hard into the knotted muscle of Draco’s back and shoulder, the top of his spine, down down down to the small of his back, fingers spread wide over his ribs. When the tips of Potter’s fingers travelled far enough on his left flank to just catch Draco’s nipple, Draco allowed himself another rough sound of pleasure, and moved his hips down against the bed. He wanted Potter to feel it.
“Mmmhmm,” Harry followed Malfoy’s hands as they pressed the toy’s buttocks apart with one hand, and the fingers of the other slid smoothly into the gleaming rubber arsehole. A cursory three pumps of his fingers, and Malfoy retreated again, returning with the dildo.
“Right,” Harry said, like a gormless idiot. “Do you want to eat first, or do the balloons?”
“Draco, honestly, let’s just forget about that room! We can put Pansy and Ginny in together and just tell them to stop being so ridiculous. And, McGonagall probably won’t even stay. Or we can put Luna up in that little hotel - she’ll love that!” His prior sense of calm had left him. Maybe he’d packed it in the box with the half-dozen non-stick saucepans, or the one with all the fitness stuff. It was probably pressed between that DVD of abdominal work outs, and Joe Wick’s
“Let’s not test it, though,” Ron said, and he stabbed six fat chips and as much pasta as he could manage, and forked the lot into his mouth. “Wassinit ma’ae?”
“Free?”
The last time Draco slept with Potter, he felt his heart swell with emotion. He knew what that feeling was. He’d known for a while. It had been manageable before, and he’d thought it could remain so, but it hadn’t taken much to break him in the end. Just a few moments of affection. He’d immediately leapt to the conclusion that Potter felt something more as well. He was mistaken.
“I was thinking,” Potter said, his thumb making circles on the inside of Draco’s wrist. “Maybe we should have a bit of a dance. To celebrate our success – the hourglass is full.” Draco turned his head dazedly to find that the hourglass had indeed been filled, and gems continued to clatter down into the narrow neck of the thing, and were starting to pile up in the upper bulb. “I’m not very good at it, and I actually kind of hate it, but I thought you would probably be quite good, and you might like to.” Potter cleared his throat slightly. “Or, if you don’t, then maybe we can get a drink and have a quiet chat out on the balcony instead.” Draco looked at Potter, and Potter smiled at him, almost shyly.
"Go away, Potter," Draco whispered miserably. "Just go away."
Weasley rolled his eyes, and scooped the bits into an evidence bag. “It pains me sometimes to know that you’re my best.”
“Nothing happened,” Harry sipped his tea, and then added a second spoon of sugar. “We just slept. Spooned a bit.”
do anything else with your hair,” the mirror said wheezily.
“Right-o.” It was a curious sensation, the blunt feel of the dildo butting up against the opening. There was a resistance he hadn’t expected, the dong bending slightly under the force of his push. Harry seemed to have thought it might go in more easily; he used a little more effort, and then it breached, and the dong slid swiftly to the hilt. Harry was pressed shoulder to navel against Malfoy’s back equally swiftly.
“Yeah,” Harry mumbled. “Chinese. Mobile. Love you.”
“You’re not my boss, Malfoy!” Potter was already out the door.
“Breathing, Potter,” Malfoy was laughing at him, his shoulders shaking gently. “You must remember to keep breathing.” Harry did as he was told and inhaled noisily, his eyes wide. He’d certainly imagined Malfoy keeping it up, and now he couldn’t
“Like you invented shagging,” the mirror puffed, and the glass shivered and dripped rather violently.
“Not the same thing at all,” Harry muttered to himself. So what if he didn’t really go out much? And, yes, maybe it had been a little while since he’d been on a proper date...a few months...or maybe a year. Years. It wasn’t like he didn’t have a perfectly active sex life. Well, actually, he didn’t have anything near an active sex life, unless you could characterise a cursory evening wank in the shower as either ‘active’, or a ‘sex life’. Things had just become a lot more complicated since Ginny. Meeting people who were not secretly weirdoes, fuckwits or Death Eaters was actually a lot harder than it sounded, and he’d wanted to be respectful to Gin, give her time to move on, minimise the speculation about what had caused the end to what
“You feel good,” he breathed it into the tender length of Draco’s throat. “I’ll miss you.”
“Why do you still pretend you can’t dress, Potter? Any idiot can see you’re in a small fortune of designer gear.” They passed the Senior Auror’s office. “Well. Maybe not any idiot. Weasley wouldn’t recognise designer even if Karl Lagerfeld were kicking him directly in his no good, freckled face.”
“Tea, please,” Potter said weakly, and he shuffled into the office and slumped into the guest chair, shoving the stack of orange files onto the desk as if he couldn’t wait another moment to relinquish them. Draco bit his lip in an effort to supress a smile, and busied himself with tea making duties. When the steaming cup was eventually in Potter’s ink-spattered hands, he finally seemed to cheer up, although only marginally.
“We should probably have a talk, tonight,” Harry said after a long moment, where they just stared at each other, the tension of many unsaid things heavy between them. “Maybe I should come over.”
“Y-yeah,” Harry wasn’t sure Malfoy would even hear him over the music, his reply huffed out on a shaking breath.
“Well, what am I supposed to do?”
“Spend more time with you lot? I’d rather soak my head.”
Potter went slightly red, and then grinned sheepishly. “Yeah, okay. But I don’t do that all the time, or anything.”
“Yeah,” Harry said, “But-”
“Malicious compliance,” Malfoy murmured. “How clever. Hilarious.”
Taking a deep breath Harry wandlessly conjured some lube in his right palm. The hot prickle of his magic throbs in his fingertips, flowing through his arm from his chest, his heart. It’s intoxicating, and not something he has ever bothered to take the time to savour before. Malfoy’s changed that about him. Malfoy, Malfoy, Malfoy.
“We’re not, really. I think my parents just enjoyed the spectacle. Still, I’m keeping this.”
That sounded good. “Practically Nando’s,” Harry said, finding a place in the fridge for the pasta. “Have you got any perinaise?”
“Yeah, but I thought that was just her being a girl, you know.” Ron chewed forcefully. “Because they sit down, innit, so it doesn’t make so much noise. Whereas I’m coming from-”
“You’re coming Friday too, though - right?”
. From the Latin
“Yeah, that black leather jacket of-
to do it, but he
With what he hoped was an appropriately authoritative flourish of robes, Draco made his way to the nearby meeting room to address his staff. Potter, to his immense satisfaction, seemed inclined to do what he was told for once, and had filed in behind Draco, closing the door after himself.
“Hello, trouble,” Harry said warily, sliding into the banquette. Ron looked slightly guilty, which was even less reassuring. “What were you muttering about?”
Harry pulled the crisp packet back onto his side of the table. “I’m not special.”
Harry groaned. “You’re a sneaky shit, Malfoy.” Draco had specifically asked for risotto for dinner, as they soaped each other thoroughly in the shower in the late morning (and nearly starting round three as a consequence). A demand for Harry to cook something fiddly wasn’t unusual, but this time it was clearly also a trap.
. When have I ever minded?”
Potter stuck his head round Draco’s door at half eleven. “Lunch plans?” He caught sight of the chaos, and swore. “Fucking hell, what happened in here?”
“Always?”
Harry shook his head. Yes, far too much.
, hard, while he whispered softly against the shell of Harry’s ear that he was
There’d been no preening in the tent while looking for Horcruxes, that was certain. Dark circles under his eyes, face sharp from hunger and stress, and a patchy mess of teenaged stubble that, topped with a lopsided haircut courtesy of Hermione, just made him look dirty, and shabby, and more like a boy than a man. In his whole life, the only mirror he’d spent any real time looking at was the one he’d used to communicate with Aberforth. And Erised, of course, but he wasn't really looking at himself in either of those.
The helmet jolted abruptly to life and proceeded to deliver an almighty pulse directly to his crown, and it was absolutely far too much. Harry fumbled with the switch, and when blessedly still, carefully removed the cursed thing and flicked it directly off the end of the bed and onto the floor, tossing the lackluster wanking sleeve after it. He lay back for a moment, panting and staring at the plaster mouldings on his ceiling. That really hadn’t gone quite how he thought it would.
Harry shrugged on his outer robe, and patted his pockets for his wallet and wand. “I am a department head, Ron. That’s what that fancy dinner was all about, the one where you ate most of a whole roasted pig?”
“Bad idea. Bad idea to tell him you’re taking me to bed. He gets jealous, you know. Even of you,” Harry lifted a hand to his mouth, to try and stem the flow of words. His ribs did not thank him for it. “Oh god, make me stop! He’ll never forgive me for telling you that.”
“Yep, you’re him.” Harry smiles, tentative. “I’d like you to be.”
? Why had he done it? This was not part of the plan at all.
Harry passed a lazy hand over Draco’s body, cleaning charm tingling in its wake. “Honestly, I didn't expect to live past seventeen so everything after that has been a bonus, really.”
“Shut up, arsehole,” Harry laughed. He felt warm inside. Different from the afterburn of firewhiskey in his stomach, or the swelter of the heat wave. “I’m just saying, if everything that happened, hadn’t - like, if Voldemort had never been born, or drowned in a cave as an evil little bastard kid-” Malfoy snorted. “I think we could have been friends. You annoyed me,” Harry grinned. “But you were always a funny little prick, and obviously we still would have belted the shit out of each other on the pitch.”
Draco went to text Neville to ask for Potter’s number, but Neville had already sent it:
It was accompanied by a dim and slightly blurry photograph which was nonetheless clearly Harry’s note, row after row of crooked crosses, pressed against Draco’s chest, right around the heart area of a dark grey, leopard print Gucci jumper.
There was a rap at the partition, and Draco looked up to see Weasley leaning against the divider. “How’d you get on?”
“That…is a ridiculous plan.” Draco shook his head, and couldn’t help smiling at Potter. “Firstly, I don’t want the job badly enough to orchestrate this sort of drama, and secondly, what possible reasons will you give the press for your retirement at the age of thirty?”
“Oh yeah? What did he think?”
” Neville shouted from the sitting room.
,” Draco said, sulkily. “Not all the way nude, anyway. Maybe topless. I’m not sure.”
Harry twisted slightly to look over his shoulder at Draco, who was hovering on the top step at the kitchen door, looking decidedly shifty. He would have made a horrible criminal, he showed everything on his face all the time.
“You know a lot of this stuff is my inheritance, right?” Draco ran his fingers over the nearest chest. “Things handed down for generations. That I’m saving for the kids.”
“No, actually,” Harry said, a bit surprised. “Sorry – I’m just looking for some assistance in tracking down who purchased it. I assume you keep records of sales?”
Potter jogged into step beside him, and Draco took care not to spare so much as a glance in his direction. “Why do you resent my presence so much?”
Malfoy stood beside him, nodding. “Agreed. It’s consistent with the wand movements for the most common spell for these kinds of sex toys - the Muggle sort, I mean. Some customers get off on the novelty of it, the Muggle element is part of their kink. But most want enhancements that are built in with wizarding toys. There’s a standard kit of charms that most vendors will throw in with the purchase of a Muggle toy, for a few extra sickles.” Malfoy’s shoulder was almost touching Harry’s. “That right there, the slightly furry looking bit?” Malfoy ran a fingertip over a grey filament. “I’d wager that’s a Concealment charm of some type. Again, common in the adult market, for obvious reasons. Not everyone is open with their partner about their desires.”
“I’m wet through,” Draco said eventually, their kisses slow and lingering. Being late seemed a trivial concern when they could be doing this. They should quit their jobs to do this all day, every day. They were both richer than god, why shouldn’t they?
“You need to eat something.”
He smiled against Harry’s throat. “No. We agreed that this was going to be about looking, and so that’s what it’s going to be about.”
“You know why.”
“Nothing happened to me, to be clear. No traumatic events - no traumatic
“Potter,” Blaise came out to greet him before Harry even had a chance to approach his receptionist. “What an unexpected pleasure.”
“Nev’s going to have to swap beds.”
. One up the... would he need
he managed to fuck him through it, still hard for a little longer, just long enough, until it started to hurt him too.
Potter hummed noncommittally and maintained eye contact as he sipped his tea.
, and he’d always thought that’s what he was. But maybe he was like Malfoy. Maybe it wasn’t just about being male or female. Maybe it was much more complicated - or maybe it was simple. Just sexual. Just liking who you like.
Potter looked down at him for a long moment. He gestured with his wand, dragged the ottoman over, and sat on it, arms folded once again and jaw set. “Why don’t you start by explaining what part pureblood tradition is playing in this mess.”
“Yes.”
As he rounded the corner past the fish and chippery, he could already hear the sticky pulse of music. Throb was an apt name for the place by all accounts. Malfoy was easy to spot, even at this distance. He tried not to obviously stumble, and swore, low and long under his breath. Malfoy was leaning against the brick wall of a building slightly past the corner, lazily dragging on a Muggle cigarette. The neon pink of the club signage glowed down on him, and he looked...he looked like the perfect, impossible balance of casual and posh, Muggle and magic, of inviting and completely untouchable.
probably, of clothing, and accessories, and fucking - fucking cologne Harry, and jewellery! Just sitting in their bags and boxes! With tags on! Harry! Beautiful, incredible items! That are all in my size, Harry! Just sitting here! In their
Harry trailed his fingertips where he imagined Malfoy’s mouth to be, and exhaled shakily in the steam of the shower, his left hand stroking his throat and his right slipping down to slowly palm his cock. He was actually a little sensitive, after so many wanks the night before, which to be fair all occurred mere hours ago. That was a lot of wank in a short period of time.
It was a Wednesday, the last time.
They just stood there for a moment, looking at each other. Then Malfoy smiled again, and started down the stairs. Harry watched him go: graceful, lithe, an unbelievable arse both literally and figuratively. He wanted to do things to that literal arse that he literally barely knew the name for-
“Are we really about to do this, Potter? On my office rug?”
The owl returned nearly three hours later, which was astonishing considering it was nearly five hours by train.
Somehow, the word ‘pleasure’ took on all sorts of suggestive meaning when Malfoy said it, which Harry supposed was probably the point. Malfoy always did know how to provoke a reaction from him, generally one he would rather not have been having. Harry cleared his throat, realised he was still holding the box containing the Frolicking Feather, and shoved it hastily back on the shelf in order to fumble his Ministry identification out of a pocket in his robes.
Ron moaned. “Yes. Our dear Chief Warlock has got himself a front garden full of cocks, as you might have heard.” He followed Harry out the back door, closing it behind them, and through the garden to the rear gate. Harry unlocked the old, slightly battered-looking Volkswagen Polo parked in the laneway behind the house, and he and Ron slid in. The interior condition of the car was somewhat at odds with its exterior. The soft leather seats creaked comfortably, and the radio switched on automatically, filling the cavernous back seat with the latest hit from The Sneaky Tweezers. There was a pleasant smell of leather polish and carpet foam, and Ron immediately lifted the lever to ease the seat all the way back to stretch out the entire length of his legs. “Do you mind if I change the station? I can’t stand this Sneaky Tweezer shite. Whatever happened to decent bands, like the Weird Sisters?”
“Alright.” Draco wasn’t going to argue with that logic. “This has happened all over London, but our best bet is starting the search here. It's convenient and probably the largest volume of birds were taken from the Ministry Owlery. We need to start a cross query on the archives for any complaints, legal cases and so forth that relate to owls, the post system, animal welfare and birds generally. I think we also need to get into the Ward Room and see what we can find in the surveillance records. We need to interview the Owl Keepers and find out who was on the overnight shift, and when the last time was that the owls were accounted for.”
“Oh, get fucked.” Harry snorted. “I’m not that kind of hoarder.”
“Alright,” Draco said, and Potter kissed him again with his Earl Grey mouth. With those few words, the mood had changed, and it was no longer just another one of their tussles, a flirtation disguised ever more thinly by bickering; with every kiss and touch, Potter was asking Draco to believe in him, and Draco did his best to tell him ‘yes’ with clutching fingers and gasped breaths. He moved down Draco’s body, eyes closed, his hair a sweaty black tangle at his nape and brow. Where his glasses were now was a mystery, as Draco had not even noticed Potter taking them off. Draco forced himself to watch Potter, fighting his instinct to let his eyes droop closed. Potter’s mouth was red and wet, delivering sucks and bites down the length of Draco’s torso, his hands following where his lips had been, and when he sucked on the skin in the hollow of Draco’s hip, he thought he may very well die of it. Death by Potter. Draco wouldn’t mind if it happened this way. He may not have the distinction of being the first wizard to die by Potter’s hand, but he might be the first to die by Potter’s mouth.
Malfoy waved him off, and headed for the kitchen. “I’m sure I can find a glass on my own, Potter. You go ahead and get sorted, and I’ll be downstairs.”
“Trent,” he said breathlessly. Draco smiled, and this time Potter seemed to see his teeth, and his posture tensed.
It was a good thing Ron and ‘Mione were the sort of friends who let themselves in rather than wait politely at the front door to be invited. It helped that they had both a key to said door, and to the wards, and that with Draco’s absence there was a minimal chance of barging in on Harry in a compromising situation. As it was, Harry was face down on the settee where he had been pretty much since Draco had gone in the morning, and he was still in just his threadbare trousers. He had, eventually, pulled the soft knitted rug off the back of the sofa when he started to feel a little cold, but otherwise he’d basically not moved all day, preferring instead to wallow in the joyous misery of requited love.
Harry was shouted awake by Malfoy.
“Shit!” Harry turned away from the carnage, startled. “What are you doing home? I told Ron not to call you.”
He wasn’t going to ask Malfoy out, but he could still celebrate him. So on Monday morning, Malfoy was greeted by a small take-away cup of espresso and two lemon madeleines, the former with a small, silver-and-green striped foil bow on the lid - but no card. Harry’d made sure he had two junior Aurors on his side of the office, sat around their small meeting table to go through the particulars of an upcoming case. As such, he could enjoy the small look of pleasure on Malfoy’s face, and feel Malfoy’s eyes on him as he studiously concentrated on his meeting, and there was no chance for Malfoy to confront him about it before the Monday morning all staff briefing.
“Like what, the solid gold cauldron?” Draco raised an eyebrow. “Don’t think I didn’t notice
“Annoying Ministry Weasley and wife, and offspring,” Draco said loudly over Harry’s snigger. “One-ear Weasley et al, Granger-Weasley’s, and Beard Weasley.”
Apparently, that was a step too far, even though Draco had literally just said he hoped Zabini would both shit himself,
Draco could probably list every time Potter had found his way to the seat by Draco’s side, and put his hand high on Draco’s thigh under the table.
His hand skimmed over the buttoned fly. Harry's been half hard for ages, and it takes very little to bring him fully erect. He was right, the jeans looked obscene and especially now that they were straining under the effort to contain his thickening cock, but instead of embarrassed like he had been at the beginning of the night, he’s aroused. Excited. The hair below his navel is coarse under his thumb as he flicks the top button open, then the next, and the next, until his jeans are open and sliding down his thighs, the sleek briefs pulled taut across his prick.
Draco pushed the button to call the lift. “Right, so you’re thinking focus on the ward record between two and three, then?”
The wards surrounding the Ministry parking garage dragged over the car before releasing it, and Harry aimed for a parking space between a sleek silver limousine, and an old fashioned Mini which was the precise colour of peanut butter. “Between stealing my breakfast and ranting about Knobgate, I nearly forgot to ask you if there was an actual reason for your visit this morning.”
“Potter, I’m suddenly feeling rather exhausted.” Draco licked his lips, and kept his eyes on Potter’s mouth. Red. Wet. “I think perhaps you should escort me home.”
“The Devil Wears Prada.”
Harry had never actually been shopping for new clothes, unless you counted his first set of Hogwarts robes. It’d sounded weird when he'd told Hermione, but despite having access to his own money once he'd rejoined the magical world when he was eleven, getting himself some proper kit that actually fit him had never been high on his list of priorities, and frankly he'd felt slightly selfish anytime he'd thought about sorting himself out a nice pair of trousers, or a t-shirt that wasn't full of holes (or which was possibly actually a Dudley-shaped tent).
enough
. I'm calling for your help in getting some, erm, artificial assistance. I'm not sure quite what to ask for...something anatomically correct," Harry cleared his throat and used the sleeve of his robes to wipe the quickly rising beads of sweat from his upper lip. "I was wondering if that was something you might have at your shop."
Draco shrugged. “This is special occasion food. I seem to recall you made this for me when you opened negotiations for me to move in with you. And when you tried to entrap me into acknowledging our relationship.”
Draco was pressing slack kisses to his shoulder. “You've done something to me. Turned me soft.” Harry tightened his arms. “This is the real reason Blaise is jealous. You think of me, you want to do things for me that make me happy. If those things happen to include gorgeous and expensive clothing and accessories, all the better for me. Blaise wishes he had what we have.” He kissed Harry slightly more firmly. “I’d be happy with just the steak and pudding, and you.”
idea why.”
A throat clears pointedly at the kitchen door.
“You look like the bastard child of Elton John and David Bowie,” Pansy said, sipping a latte in his kitchen. She’d at least brought almond friands with her, otherwise he’d have told her to fuck off hours ago.
“Oh, my days!”
"You let Death Eater's into the school. You let a werewolf, known to be dangerous, especially to children, into the school. It was a sanctuary, and you let them inside. Thousands of children could have died that day. Thankfully, only one person did. It was a mistake Malfoy. I know it was. And I know you've paid for it dearly. But the Ministry is making a point. They could have sent you to Azkaban for it. They could have had you Kissed. Instead, they chose a symbolic punishment, one that would satisfy the hundreds upon hundreds of parents who were calling for action."
“-and the rest of us were talking about it-”
Harry could feel the tips of his ears getting hot, and he scowled at the board. Honestly, the constant embarrassment was making him quite cross. He was
Potters fingers tightened. "You're angry with me."
“That was an incredibly shit joke, you’re normally much better than that. Maybe I fucked the humour right out of you.” Harry pressed kisses to the top of Draco’s head, his hair a soft, slippery mess. “...You think I’m sexy.”
“One with an enormous sticky beak.” He paused, and Ginny hooted with laughter. “Similar situation with the location of the nest.”
“Well. You’re all knobs, so.”
“Going to write about it in your journal, are you? ‘Dear diary, this morning I woke up and Draco was already sucking me off. He rode me like I was a pony. Draco is so handsome and clever. I’m the luckiest boy in the world. Love, Spexy xoxo’.”
“But he was a Muggle, so he approached you purely because he was attracted to you.”
Drumming up the nerve to Portkey to the ground was embarrassingly difficult, and in the end Draco arrived far later than he intended. As was expected with his luck, the first person he saw was Weasley, who took one look at Draco and let out a low whistle. “Slytherin pride, eh Malfoy?”
Potter pulled back. “Did I—? Of course I knew it was you. I like you, you bloody idiot!”
“Thanks, mum.”
Harry stared at him.
. Harry did his best to imbue his glare with actual murder, but Ron remained frustratingly alive, and smug as fuck.
“That ship has sailed, Harry. You should have heard him going on, on Monday night. ‘Why doesn’t Malfoy think I’m the hottest Weasley? Do you think I should work on my arms more, or do more squats?’ Honestly.”
all the way down, and he coughed out a cloud of ice cold breath. “Salazars fucking saggy…”
“Cravats,” said Wedderburn. “Are they bad?”
Teddy grins at them both from his high chair, and yells nonsense, none of which sounds like ‘fuck’. Thank god. His hair shimmers, and abruptly turns from chestnut to ginger.
Harry sat up in bed with an involuntary, but deeply felt, moan. His pillows were unpleasantly hot, and had twisted into lumpy instruments of torture under his head during the night. It really wasn’t any wonder that he was feeling hungover and a little bit ashamed after the night he’d had. He tried to recall if he’d ever got himself off so many times in a row, even at fourteen, which he was fairly sure had been his peak wanking age. He couldn’t think of a single time that he’d brought himself off three times in as many hours. It was lucky he had any skin left on his palm, let alone his cock.
“Draco.”
Harry aimed a kick at him, which Malfoy dodged nimbly, laughing. “Arsehole. Like you’re any better.”
The Misuse of Muggle Artefacts Office occupied a small suite of rooms at the far end of Level Two. Small gold-painted letters marked their territory on the rippled glass of a faded wooden door, opening to a modest foyer that housed two plastic visitor chairs, a dusty potted plant, and a frazzled-looking receptionist behind a narrow counter. Harry’s office was behind the first of four adjoining doors; a meeting room that was barely the size of a broom cupboard squeezed immediately beside it. The third door led to an office shared by his four long-suffering field officers, and the final door led to Harry’s favourite place in the whole Ministry: the lab.
As soon as his food was gone, and Potter's, Draco was moving again. The sooner this was over with, the better, and if Potter wasn't going to say anything, not yell or tell him to leave, or anything else that might
and Draco didn’t stop until he was pushing in, too hard, too tight. Potter arched his back, snapped his hips up to meet him. He was so tight, so hot, Draco was coming too fast, he didn’t want it to be over. Potter’s eyes were bright and green, and wide open, and Draco was coming hard. Potter jerked himself hard between their bellies and when he came he called him
Ministry business, in which case,” Malfoy looked down at his potion, and stirred it until it turned thick and lucent, “in which case my answer will be ‘come back with a court order’.” He paused, looked up again briefly, and added, “and then probably still no after that.”
job.”
Potter sighed. “Come on.” Draco sighed too, and batted petulantly at a towel hanging from a nearby washing line.
“Perfect,” Harry said. This was easy.
“Quite,” Blaise said, leaning forward and taking a sip of his latte. “How much money were you hoping to raise?”
Malfoy shrugged and picked up his tea again. “Why not? Someone needs to do it. You can’t tell me that Granger hasn’t tried to get you back out there.” Hermione most certainly had. Ginny, too. But the idea of going out, looking for a shag, with his well meaning best friend and/or equally well meaning ex girlfriend looking on supportively, occasionally pushing him towards some likely target, was just - it was far too much pressure.
“May I have a bite?”
“And you promise not to judge me?”
“’Morning, sir. If I may, could I have the car keys back, sir? Fleet have threatened to send a Howler every hour starting at lunchtime if you don’t return them today.”
Honeysuckle was heavy in the mild breeze, and Harry felt a restless beat of emotion rise in his chest; not one emotion, really, but several. Amusement. Affection. Gratitude. Other things, that he’d been trying his best to pretend weren’t there. Trying for a long while, actually.
“What are you doing at Theo’s?” Draco asked.
“You enjoy pushing your tongue in, tasting her, opening her lips to get your mouth around her clit and sucking it?” Malfoys lips were so soft, barely brushing against his ear, just behind it.
“Okay, so I’m a bit hungover then, and it seemed like a reasonable move,” Draco made unconvincing agreeing noises as he unlocked his office door. “I
? Surely ten interesting things happened there before morning tea. Harry snapped on one glove. “Well...no.”
“What’s your take on the incident reports?”
Malfoy lifted the paper carry bag. “Well, Potter. Shall I get you set up?”
"You came."
obsessed,” said Ron, with feeling.
“Right. Alright. Here’s the thing. I have a bit of a problem, ah, letting go of things. And so, I mostly, well, don’t.”
“Later,” Draco seemed to remember he had hands, and groped his way to the drawstring of Harry’s joggers. They helped each other push Harry’s trousers down as best they could, considering they were unwilling, or perhaps unable, to stop kissing and touching each other, and Harry was three fingers deep in Draco throughout the whole operation. Draco was hard again as he urged, “Come on, please, I can’t wait, I need it,” and so Harry moved above him and between his thighs again, because he needed it too, couldn’t wait for it.
Potter sipped his tea. “I never used to think I was lucky – actually I would have said I was probably the most cursed bloke around, but I suppose you don’t survive Voldemort by having bad luck.” Draco cast his eyes around the office for a space to put down his teacup, and finally pushed it back into Potter’s free hand. Potter grabbed it awkwardly, narrowly avoiding a spill. “You’re leaving?”
“Tell me all about it, darling,” Draco said, and brought his chair around to squeeze them both onto the same side of the table, and they sat half turned in to each other, their knees pressed together.
“Again,” Ron put far more jam on than was reasonable, and got a great deal more on the table. “You must have hated that.”
Draco patted Harry’s bum twice, then a third time, which was more of a slap. “Come on, lover boy. Help clean me up before we get any more come on the cushions.”
as it flew. He wandlessly slammed the door closed, and added a Silencing Charm for good measure.
Draco didn’t need to be asked twice. He levitated a stack of orange files directly into Potter’s arms, where they landed with enough force to push him back a step. “I’ve been putting off meetings with personnel about operations matters for months.” Draco flicked his wand, and about a third of the flying memos swooped toward the door and commenced buzzing around Potter’s head, instead. “There’s a short preamble at the front of each file explaining what the problem is. I’ve scheduled all the appointments in Meeting Room 2 starting at half past twelve, which gives you-” Draco looked at the clock on his desk, then grinned at Potter, “-one hour to prepare.”
Harry closed his eyes and took a deep breath, smelled Malfoy in the thick air. “Other than nervous? I felt...a bit sexy, I guess.”
All Draco heard was Potter’s laughter, and then they were gone.
“Yes, very much I can see.”
“I-” Draco pressed a hand to his chest. “I don’t believe you.”
Potter shook his head. "No. I imagine kicking you out and leaving you homeless would be somewhat of a dampener on the possibility of getting another kiss out of you. And, I'd miss you a lot."
After several long moments of panting, one arm flung over his eyes, Harry Summoned his mobile and tapped out a brief message before he lost his nerve again.
“That’s hot,” Draco said, with annoyance. “Show off. Merlin, why am I such a slag for you doing wandless.”
Circe’s tits. “Again, I appreciate the kind offer, but I am truly just up for a night with my friend. Not up for any choking or pissing, or anything else.”
Harry gave him a wry look. “You don’t say.”
Potter looked at him carefully.
Fifteen pairs of bulbous elf eyes looked at Draco in alarm, as he slammed the door open hard enough to cause the hinges to creak ominously. Draco wondered whether there was a polite way of demanding they all get out without actually scaring an elf to death. The laundry room was steamy with fresh washing, round wooden tubs slopping over with soapy water as towels were scrubbed, and churned by invisible hands before being pushed through an enormous wringer, and dozens of clean towels were strung on washing lines which criss-crossed the ceiling, with more fluttering upwards every moment to peg themselves cheerfully to the line.
Malfoy slammed the file in his hands down on the desk, so suddenly and with such force, that Harry jumped, and paperclips and fastenings flew in all directions. “Doesn’t
“Coffee?”
Harry gave him a half smile. “That obvious?”
“Harry, I’ve told you a thousand times, we’ll get an elf service. We’ll get a whole team of them, they’ll dust and mop this place within an inch of its life, and we’ll spend a small fortune updating the bedding and linen, and the mattresses too, I’d imagine, and keep the windows open the whole week in the lead up so everything will be fresh and clean. I’ll order flowers in for all the rooms too, and some posh soaps. You love posh soaps.”
“I’m not gay, Potter.”
“You’re right. Time flies, eh?”
Draco squinted, then sneered. “Not like you, love,” and swallowed another shot of vodka.
another visit soon.”
By Friday, Harry wasn’t trying not to rub his morning wood on Malfoy’s arse anymore, either.
- there were easily a dozen decorative cushions, none of which matched. A cupcake caddy. A yoga mat. A set of neon bocce balls. Two backpacks. A set of fancy linen sheets with an eye watering price label still stuck to the front. Another yoga mat. Several novelty Christmas jumpers. An inflatable mattress for camping.
No one said a word. It was so quiet, Harry could hear the bubbles bursting softly in Hermione’s glass of posh grapefruit mineral water. Ginny and Hermione kept exchanging meaningful looks with one another. Feeling panicked, Harry tried his beans and eggs again just for something to fill the silence. “Are you sure,” Ron eventually said, sounding pained, “that it’s definitely not goblin porn?”
“Could this not have been a memo?” Draco asked in exasperation. Weasley was sniggering into a forkful of beans. Bog just looked at him and eventually vanished.
“A change you volunteered for,” there was real accusation in his voice. As if Potter had a right to feel slighted.
“Smooth,” Ron said. “Very smooth.”
Harry gave Malfoy a look. “Yes, even a hopeless case like me can manage to stand still and leer at people.” He’d meant it to be funny, but Malfoy fixed him with that piercing look again.
anything. But Ginny...professional Quidditch players were not generally known for their powers of deduction. What the fuck was Potter about, anyway? Was it a secret, was it not? He took a sip of his water and took his time responding. “Well I had a change of heart. I was visited by quite a persistent bird, myself.”
“I didn’t know you were in love with him.” Draco didn’t respond to that. Nobody was supposed to know that. He’d only told Pansy out of panic, so she would stop him from going home with Potter again. Granger didn’t look happy. “You’re incredibly stubborn, Draco Malfoy.” It seemed like she wanted to say something more, but wasn’t sure if she should.
“Hopefully,” Harry said, and made himself a bit of jammy toast.
“In the spirit of that,” Draco said lightly - too lightly. Harry forced himself to concentrate. “We really need to get the party organised for the next couple of weeks.” Harry groaned into Draco’s armpit. “Honestly, Potter, anyone would think you didn’t want an engagement party.”
“Fuck. Fuck.
“You’re not kidding,” Potter breathed, as Draco ground against his hip, and locked the door with a flick of his wand.
“Harpies thumped the Prides...best on pitch...Ginevra Weasley.” Harry grinned. “That’s my girl. Now...Cannons, Cannons, Can-...ah. Well, I suppose that’s a topic which might be best avoided.” He pinched the tabbed string of his tea bag between two fingers, and swished it in a slow circle around the perimeter of his cup. A neat stack of toast sat on a plate between himself and his newspaper, and the butter had melted into a warm golden puddle on top. Harry folded the paper in half, then half again, and propped it up against the sugar bowl so he could skim the classifieds, whilst cupping his tea with both hands. The mornings were getting just this side of nippy lately, and he would need to get into the habit of setting a fire in the old potbellied stove again, as the kitchen was large, and he was pants at Warming charms.
Lunch was ready. Potter served, making sure Draco had extra roast potatoes as always, because he knew Draco liked them. Draco couldn't fathom why Potter made such an effort. Why he bothered. They ate in silence, too. What on earth would they say, anyway? It was always like this, quiet. Only now it was tense and awkward, rather than comfortable. Potter was wrong, they weren't friends - Potter was just a stupid Gryffindor with a compulsion to save people, and Draco was just a idiot Slytherin who had made the grave mistake of falling in love with him.
“Of course,” Malfoy laughed into his drink.
He’d died in the forest once, would he have to die of embarrassment too, without having done anything even remotely sexually adventurous?
He thinks of dancing with Potter, of his myriad of dresses and whether he might like to wear some now or if they were only part of the movie.
Fake plan and confidence, Draco starts putting bowls into the dishwasher. He takes the biggest one first, because that one will be the most difficult to place, and fills up the rest as the landscape changes.
It's that, in the end, that is the most jarring; Potter never seemed to sit still a day in his life.
people. It’s just not the same with a layer of charms between everyone,
cradling Malfoy in his arms, gliding his hands over his spine and carding his fingers through his hair. They wouldn’t be having sex if Harry didn’t enjoy touching Malfoy, if he didn’t revel in the smoothness of his skin and how soft his hair is. Even the cuddling isn’t new, though this is the first time that they don’t have the excuse of having to catch their breath before they can move again. Malfoy is always tactile after sex, and Harry indulges him happily enough, but it feels different when they aren’t covered in sweat and gasping for air.
Yesterday, for example, Harry finally realised why his shampoo smelled different, and why it was familiar even in that change. It’s the same as Draco’s, slightly different to allow for their difference in hair structure, but the same fancy brand Harry always rolled his eyes at. He can’t deny anymore that it’s worth its exorbitant price,
Draco opens his eyes to glare at him, the effect ruined by the sun mercilessly shining down on him and making him blink like an idiot. Weasley isn’t intimated at all, but at least he is laughing too much to continue his threats.
Except for Harry, of course, trapped in here with them.
Well then, this is as close to a blessing as Draco needs! He takes the violin off its place on the wall, soothes the magic fluttering over its surface and takes a bow. He didn’t mean to
“Draco Malfoy,” Potter says, and Draco fears this might be the most formal and awkward question for consent he’ll ever receive. “Will you do me the great joy of fake marrying me so that we can see our friends and trick the system?”
you here. If you are that desperate to have someone to talk to, take your bloody owl and leave.” Potter points at the door, his entire body throwing Draco out, rejecting him.
. He tries to take as little as possible, to not look down at what he is eating, but they are far off concerns. Nothing is as important as defying Potter.
“Here is your kiss,” Draco murmurs, unaware of these memories tugged away in his mind, just wanting to be close to Potter, to not let him go without a kiss, even if it’s not the one they both wanted.
Potter’s cock feels even better than it looks. There is something soft like velvet about it, unforgiving and yet soft to the touch, and Draco loves the contrast.
In a matter of seconds, Draco is full-on sobbing, clinging to Harry like he might drown otherwise, listening to his soothing nonsense, and pressing up into the soft kiss Harry drops onto his forehead.
But if Draco had turned on the music, how could he have heard the singing?
Potter is a masterpiece, deserving of detailed study.
Oh? Is—is Potter
Starting this game in a dorm full of people more experienced and skilled than Harry at finding and exploiting particularly ticklish places, he had to learn how to fight dirty to hold his own. Of course, in the end they were all ruthless and no one was standing referee, brandishing about a book of rules to make sure everyone was being fair and considerate (that would defeat the point, wouldn’t it?) but Harry is quite proud of how well he adapted. Draco doesn’t stand a chance.
Everyone was talking about the war, was suffering and grieving and feeling very mighty, sneering upon Draco and his. Now, don’t get him wrong, Draco is all for sneering at those who deserve it—naive, goody two shoes who think they can save the world with only one spell and their rugged charm and crooked grin, for one; nevermind that the bloody bastard actually
Distantly, Draco is aware that this should be weird. They’ve spent the last days not speaking to each other after a spectacularly vicious fight; they should
Good question, what
clear. Draco would have understood her even if he didn’t speak a single word of English; everything about Granger exudes danger, her magic sharp and precise, waiting for the smallest twitch of intention to form the word.
“Understood,” Draco says. Some things cannot be conveyed in nod, however sincere and grave.
Yet another reason Ron should be the one to fix this mess and talk to Draco, he must have gotten good at explaining normal people things to fancy snakes. Hermione is only semi-passable at them herself, sometimes, so she is out, but Ron would be the ideal candidate.
Third, Draco read his letter.
“Come on, up you get.” Weasley nudges against his side, prodding him awake and dragging him out of that comfortably dimmed place where Draco could almost pretend Potter is here. “Don’t make me dunk cold water onto you.”
Draco has managed to hide from Potter for a week now. As well as you can hide from someone when the house you share doesn’t know personal boundaries and is insistent on pushing you together. Draco does his best to sneak out of the rooms they suddenly find themselves shut in, but Grimmauld has turned horribly on him, cutting off all his escape routes. It has been a week of tense silences and speculating looks from Potter’s side of the room that Draco did his best to ignore. If it were at all feasible, Draco would have gladly gone on like this.
Besides, if Harry wanted to get up, he would say something. Harry was never one to hesitate to speak his mind, certainly not where Draco is concerned. If Harry isn’t complaining, he must be fine with smothering Draco for a bit longer, or at least close enough to it that Draco doesn’t feel obligated to do the gracious thing and offer Harry a way out. Harry will have to forge his own escape route if he wants to leave; Draco, for his part, is very comfortable.
Dear Potter,
Draco almost feels like he could stay like this forever, the taste of Potter on his tongue as the man himself sings his praises, his fingers gentle in Draco’s hair except when he can’t help himself, when Draco does something clever that has him shouting, has him pull Draco closer and never letting go. Yes, that would be a life well spend, Draco thinks. All that is missing is seeing Potter, eyes blown wide from pleasure and mouth open in a moan.
Ron is still scowling, though he also hands Harry a towel to staunch the flowing blood and keeping him from bleeding out. That’s a good sign, right? Ron being furious with
Pansy has come to the same conclusion, and she leans impossibly closer, all her aggression and fight gone in favour of the prowl. “That’s decided then, we are going to have coffee and you will apologise to the Pandas.”
—” that’s how far Harry gets before Malfoy interrupts him.
“You aren’t supposed to touch Capt'n,” Draco says, because it’s true and just because Harry seems to be the exception to every rule Draco ever had, doesn’t mean he shouldn't know. Draco would have allowed Harry to hold her eventually — did in fact already promise him the privilege as part of his apology, though the very real physical implications of that promise didn’t hit before Draco saw Harry
else.
He doesn’t have time for the technicalities, not when Potter looks like he fears Draco got closer only so that his parting words would be all the more devastating. Draco presses their sides together and decides that will have to be enough, the unmistakable reassurance that he is here, that he isn’t going anywhere.
“It’s quite alright, Potter. I love how responsive you are, how sensitive. You looked magnificent.” Draco is definitely closer to purring than usual, but it’s okay, because Potter makes that choking noise again.
lost, that the word is a metaphor to enable you to better follow what is happening to your dear Potter. If my attempts to facilitate matter overwhelmed you.” Granger coughs, interrupting Draco and letting him know to tread lightly. She might not have the luxury of throwing him out, but there are ways to make his time here more unpleasant than it needs to be. Granger is scarily ruthless; she would do anything Pansy airily threatens, as long as it motivates Draco to cooperate. “If my metaphor confused you, I will refrain from using them.”
Draco watches her walk away, trying to remember why dignity is important and how it prevents him from just ripping the letter open like a giddy child, when Granger stops dead and turns around.
The singing will start now, he knows. He should have brought the headphones, should have drowned the noise out the only way he knows how.
Draco didn’t doubt for a second that they would kill Potter and dump his body in the Thames if that were the best course of action, but it’s nice to be reassured regardless. What can he say, Potter is a sore topic for him, and having such a strong reminder that Draco is far from alone in this disaster is much appreciated. It can get lonely, having a husband who makes no secret out of hating you.
Potter first. Draco has his priorities. (Granger and Weasley are more than capable of helping themselves, Potter might not be.)
Malfoy took a lot more time with his outfit. He’s wearing formal robes, closed high and dyed a dark blue, contrasting beautifully against his pale skin and shimmering in silver ornaments. They move in the wind, just a bit, his hair gently curling around his face and calling for Harry to tuck it behind his ear, trace over the silver pendants woven into a multitude of tiny braids.
“As for the more tangible parts than social constructs, not having sex isn’t going to hurt you. There is no negative affect to anything but your mind, and that is the toxic message from society, the internalised fear of revolting against the rules they try and force on us. The foreign matter you are fighting here isn’t the part of yourself you can finally see clearly, it’s generations of hateful and scared ideology.”
Draco is sure he had a point here, somewhere, something that then drifted off—journalist! Draco is a journalist. Reporter, if you prefer. Essentially it’s all the same anyway. He sniffs out people's secrets, what they seek to hide, adds a little drama and a lot of glitter (because, as he realised one week into his new job as gossipmonger, people are dreadfully dull. All the same, even their spicy, dirty secrets) then he pulls it all together under a catchy headline and voilà, there goes another masterpiece of an article.

The glass is disappointingly small, Draco feels like he could drain an entire ocean, salt and fish excrements included.
“Absolutely sure.” Potter nods, then he smirks, and Draco doesn’t think he wants to know what he thought of there. “200 % sure, in fact.”
Blaise is infamous for his terrible betting skills, despite their best efforts to keep the knowledge under wraps. That is mainly due to Blaise himself, who refuses to accept what they collectively decided must be an ancient family curse and insists on trying again and again, each time convinced that this is the time his fortunes change. It never does. It’s a good thing Blaise is undefeatable in any other form of gambling — perhaps it’s some twisted apology, or an attempt at cosmic balance, but Blaise is as unable to lose at cards as he is unable to win a bet (which led to some uncanny accidents to avoid a definite outcome when they experimented with Blaise betting on his luck in cards) — or he would have long since lost all his money to bets. As it stands, it’s only his dignity he is giving up on, which seems to be an acceptable price for his experimentation.
Theo rolled his eyes, muttering under his breath. He shook his head and looked at their leader with a head tilt. "Do we meet up in the library after Dinner?"
"Oh, I wasn't aware students would be arriving early." She had a strained smile, clearly four Slytherins with her alone made her uncomfortable.
No one made a sound, the silence was deafening. She saw how the old man leaned forward with narrowed eyes. Seems he was expecting something different. -Not today, old man- she thought with a smirk. She made her way towards her house table, Malfoy made space for her and gave her a smirk.
The bushy haired girl she recognized as the one who outed Weasley for the smudge on his nose almost ran to the stool and jammed the hat eagerly on her head.
"Pansy Parkinson, you will take a seat and you will be silent! One more word and you'll be dealing with much more than detention."
Maeve knew she was different from her relatives. She could do things they couldn't. Obviously she knew she was special, she should be the one in charge! She had the powers and everyone else were, they were mundane.
"Oh, a lady. Hello, love, I am Sirius Black and my friends are James Potter, Remus Lupin, and Peter Pettigrew."
Her birthday was next month she would finally be seven years old, she had to wait just a little longer. St. Grogory's primary school was not too far. She detested the school and all its staff. They were all incompetent fools.
"Malfoy?" Sirius asked in a confused tone.
Severus Snape would definitely become a hindrance to her progress and would have to be dealt with soon as possible. Dumbledore will no doubt be a thorn in her side and he would only continue to get worse. The three aforementioned Weasleys would be handled as well, she'll have no one come between her and her path to greatness.
"She won't, if she dares open her mouth and reveal anything, well... Hogwarts will soon find itself with an opening for Head Deputy. I'll talk to her and ensure she stays silent. And as for little Weasley, well for his sake, he had better keep his mouth shut as well, I'm not above making him an example if he ever disobeys.
"Well, you are his heir, in order to better prepare you for when you take over the family name, shouldn't he take you along with? To help you get a better feel of what is to come? If you ask him to teach you more of his position, well I reckon he'd be impressed with your maturity level and would feel more comfortable speaking to you about adult matters." She remembered the way he spoke of politics when they were on the train the night before.
Her eyes lingered for a moment on a student in the front that Maeve could see trembling, and on the Weasley's still smudged nose. Maeve shifted impatiently on her feet.
"I trust word of my speaking this way will not be spread about?" Though her tone spoke nonchalance, her eyes were harden as though to dare anyone to object. While most Ravenclaws were known for their thirst of knowledge, they also knew the line no to cross just to get answers and going against the short raven haired girl will be something that could cost their lives, they knew that much was true. Slytherins were known for their self-preservation, they knew power when they saw it and power meant safety. Opposing Potter would only mean forfeiting their lives.
'Braxton left the comfort of his home in the middle of the night after a heated argument with his father. He hiked into the woods behind his house. The only light to guide him was the moon that lay pale in the dark sky.
Still, she gave a smile that seemed strange on the face of someone so young. “I’m alright with what I am purchasing. Both Cauldron’s will be fine and the cost isn’t a worry, please just check me out so that I may continue my shopping.”
"Perhaps we should find out,"
Name: Maeve Alarica Potter
The old man eyed them with blue twinkling eyes, eyes that seemed to hold secrets. "Ms.potter, are you sure you wish to attend this trial?" He asked with fabricated concernment.
The teacher nods, her eyes unfocused. Maeve shakes her head in mock disappointment. "Say it, Mrs. Colt, say you understand." She whispers. "I understand." Her voice is almost robotic as she speaks. "Good." Maeve praises before walking back to her desk to get ready to leave.
"And now, before we go to bed, let us sing the school song!" cried Dumbledore. Maeve noticed that the other teachers' smiles had become rather fixed.
'One more month and I will finally be officially setting up the new rules in the Dursley household. They will listen and obey me, or they'll be punished harshly. I've already learned how to purposely inflict pain on others, without it being traced back to me. Tommy Fells still wont come within five feet of me, I take it as a win. I even successfully learned to command others to do what I want with just my voice. Samantha Pearling has given me twenty pounds within the span of four days. Soon I'll be in control.'
"You are either on my side, by my side, or in my fucking way. Choose wisely."
"I know defense against the dark arts mostly because my grandfather taught me, he wanted me to acknowledge the power of the dark arts and how to defend myself from them." Theo admitted, she smiled at him and wrote down both Draco and his strengths and then looked at Blaise.
Where dwell the brave at heart,
"I would like to know how you've settled in Slytherin? Are the students giving you a hard time? We can always have you resorted. You know your parents were in Gryffindor, wonderful people they were." He had a nostalgic look in his eyes, as though remembering the good times in the past. She wasn't fooled by the act.
Mouth parting slightly in surprise and eyes wandering up to her forehead where a faint lightning shaped scar remained, the goblins couldn’t get rid of the mark fully but at least the dark magic tainting it was gone. “By the gods, Ms. Potter, I’m terribly sorry for the inconvenience! I shall have everything ready for you. Please follow me to get your measurements done.”

"Of course, professor. When would she like to see me?" She asked in artificial politeness, a plastic smile plastered on her face. She supposed the plan she forged would have to wait.
"You can go get Dudley now." She told her aunt and then pointed at Marge who had collapsed once the magic lifted. "And you can clean yourself up. Its time for dinner." As soon as she finished speaking the three adults were up and going.
"Tell me Marge, do you believe in magic?" The young girl wondered, leaning her face closer. She ignored the startled gasp that left Petunia's mouth, focusing solely on the filth before her.
"So you had no idea your father, James Potter, was prongs? That he and his friends created the map?" Fred glanced at his twin, he didn't know what else to ask without seeming insensitive.
"What the --?"
1.) 42+13=55  2.) 28+13=41
"Yes." She replied rolling her eyes. She heard her aunt walking away before finally getting up to get ready for the day. She had a whole plan to set in motion.
~I do not have one, hatchling.~
Nodding at her appearance, she walked back out to the kitchen. The Dursleys went about their normal routine, carefully treading around Maeve, who seemed in a chirpy mood. They didn't want to destroy the peace.
She quietly giggle to herself when Malfoy had been called up as he swaggered forward and got his wish at once: the hat had barely touched his head when it screamed, "SLYTHERIN!"
Uncle Vernon hauled her case into the trunk and placed Loki's cage in between Dudley and herself. She cracked a smirk at her squirming cousin, her serpent merely lazily hissed at him.
Maeve laid on the small mattress in her cupboard room. She curled her lips in disgust. -how disgusting that I refer this filth as my room. A person of my abilities should be treated like a queen and nothing less.- Her parasite relatives were fast asleep, she could quite clearly hear her uncle and cousin snore. Its a surprise that the neighbors don't complain. She rolled her eyes, of course they wouldn't complain. No one had a backbone to even bother standing up to Vernon. -disgusting pig. How can I be related to that creature?-
And learn until our brains all rot."
"You lot can go about your day, might want to take a nap before our next class as it is astronomy and I would hate for you all to fall asleep and possibly not learn anything." She waved a dismissive hand and the surrounding group parted ways leaving her with her friends. "Such well behaved snakes, I quite like the way they obey without much thought." Maeve smiled darkly, her boys chuckled quietly from beside her. Together they made their way to the library as they planned to study history on their own, yet again. As said from before, Maeve refused to have her and her friends settle for less simply because their professor was absolutely dead.
A squat little witch with a patched hat over her flyaway hair stepped into view, she was professor Sprout, the head of Hufflepuff house. The three students knew they were quiet early, especially by the look on her round face. She eyed their ties, emerald green, with a wary eye.
McGonnagal cleared her throat. "Have a seat, Lady potter." She restated with the correct title.
"That's not fair!"
-Am I going crazy-
"I see we've gotten to meet the lovely Lady Potter once more, how delightful." After attending the court trial she could clearly hear the difference of Sirius Black's voice in person. He'd sounded so dull and drained as he was being interrogated, such a vast difference from the happy and cheerful boy he once was. Guess prison did that to people.

§Loki? Are you awake?§
"No."
"You wont forget a woman like her, easily anyway. Once you cross paths with magic, it's hard to see life the same."
He pulled out a blade and a parchment paper. -What is with parchment with these wizards? Are they that much out of date?- "You will need to cut your palm and spill a few droplets of blood onto the paper, it will reveal if your the real Maeve Potter. And then we will do the inheritance test." He instructed, handing over the gorgeous blade. "Nothing to worry about. After the blood is given the would will heal itself up, you'll hardly feel it." He assured, most likely seeing her hesitancy.
She recalled her next period being History of Magic with the Hufflepuffs. Hopefully they were more manageable, Ravenclaw was alright once she got them under her thumb. Hufflepuff might be a good house to snatch as well, they were said to be the most loyal.
Maeve woke to Loki nudging her with the tip of his tail, she smiled sleepily at him. She wanted to lay in, but knew that wasn't possible. At least Loki agreed last night to stay by her side.
The class was quiet as they read, only the sound of pages turning or quills moving as some were also taking notes. Maeve was one of the few who didn't bother taking any as she had a perfect memory and could remember just about anything. They had lunch after this and all she really wanted to do was make a big enough scene to ensure she had everyone's attention and then just go to the library. Hogwarts library had to have been magnificent, so many books to read about all the magic that has been here for centuries, perhaps even longer.
In a few hours, Marge would arrive and the Dursleys would struggle to make sure everything was perfect. Maeve was quite excited, the large whale hadn't been over in a while so she doesn't know of the change. It would be the perfect moment to show Marge exactly who ran the show.
Draco and Blaise exchanged looks, Theo was staring entranced by the green eyes beauty. She was making a scene, causing people to think. But was that a good thing or bad thing? Especially at a time like this. It wouldn't matter of course, they'd still follow her.
Maeve walked a little in the front, Malfoy and Zabini to her right and left with Nott bringing up the rear. Students in blue and green parted like the red sea and allowed the small group to step through first. Without knowing, Maeve carved a path for herself and others following in her and through that path, she begin the change in the Slytherin hierarchy, p lacing herself at the top of the pecking order.
"Something wrong, Potter?" Snape's voice drawled from behind her, she merely folded her hands upon her lap and smiled pleasantly.
Maeve ordered. She didn't like being ignored. She wanted to know who was speaking to her.
She quite liked the idea to antidote for common poisons, it may very well come in handy one day. It didn't appear very expensive either, neither was the Anti-Paralysis Potion, she would like to purchase both. Maeve placed both items in the small basket she picked up at the front.
Finally after waiting a solid five minutes Draco walked in leading the two other boys ahead of several other first years. Pale blue eyes landed on her and a wide grin overcame his face, cheeks flushing a rosy hue, Blaise and Theo glanced over in her direction as well before they also smiled. Seemed she was not the only one feeling lost without them by her side. They practically ran to get to her despite her not being that far from walking distance, but she knew as how that must have felt as she felt the strain of being away. It was similar to how she felt with Loki, yet different. Though she couldn't place her finger on it.
"Professor," She nodded politely.
Loki hissed in agreement. Deciding to get ready for the day, Maeve walked to her closet and pulling out a black long sleeved shirt and a black and white checkered mid-thigh skirt, knee length socks and her leather doc Martin's. She quickly changed, tucking the shirt into her skirt and brushing through her dark curls, placing them into twin space buns. Little baby hairs falling in curls down her forehead and her nape.
She took a few and munched quietly as she looked around the now crowded room. Gryffindors were loudly talking, Ravenclaws were speaking among each other, Hufflepuffs were a happy bunch and impossibly chirpy, the Slytherins that around her and at the far end of the table seemed distant and closed off. They gave a dangerous aura that warned people away, Maeve found it intriguing.
She unconsciously slipped back into the unknown language, tilting her head like a confused puppy.
"That old halfwit really thinks he can control you? He must be completely bonkers to assume you'd follow his orders and be alright with it." Draco said as he pulled out his charms book.
She widened her eyes a little more, throwing in the kicked puppy look she mastered. "We'll, you see, I'm trying to get my things up but there much to heavy for me. I was hoping you'd be of help?" She blinked slowly, fluttering her eyelashes innocently.
(It’s the latter, obviously it’s the latter, or they wouldn’t be friends with Theo, but Draco refuses to be grateful for their teasing for the whole evening, lest they get too used to it. He did hand Draco a way out, though, so perhaps Draco can afford a little more gratitude before shutting it down again.)

say Draco would have free reign about the house, no exemption agreed on. Draco is paying a high price for that deal, he wants to get what was promised. But he already offered to regard it as the favour owed, because when confronted with Potter about to fall apart Draco panicked, his brain circuited and he completely forgot the room was already his by all that is right and just.
Draco doesn’t visibly react, disappointing Harry’s hope that his crude and exaggerated choice of words would goad him out from behind his shields. Looking at Draco, meeting the open disgust and scorn, Harry realises that perhaps his gamble didn’t work because they were not exaggerated at all.
It’s a lot grosser in reality than Harry thought it would be, Malfoy stuttering against him and frantically pushing against Harry’s shoulder.
The renovations of Grimmauld are coming along well, Draco reassured him, but as far as Harry can see they are still living with nothing but the bare essentials, uncomfortable and sworn to be only temporary. For some inane reason, Draco insisted on not having any real furniture in the house during the process, and the first rooms he made livable again are the guest rooms and the countless parlours Harry didn’t even know about. Magic space, that’s what it must be, it’s ineffable. Or Grimmauld deeming him too plebeian to lay his eyes on the noble splendour.
Yours,
intend to spread my filthy half-muggle blood in the house — do you think I should? Malfoy might get a heart-attack if I set the accents right. He’ll be disgusted and scandalised in the very least. Then he’ll think I’m mental and maybe then he’ll agree to a divorce —” Harry can see it all so clearly.
Then there are hands on his arm and Draco flinches, hands clenching on the desk and eyes pressed together tighter, a jolt of pain shooting through his brain.
“Since you asked so nicely.” Draco bows, because it’s part of the performance but also because he needs to bend down anyway to push the drawers in and close the door again. He doesn’t know how the dishes will be washed, then, but Potter can do that bit himself. Draco did most of the job already!
I feel I’m saying that a lot, sorry, but it

And yet he clings to Potter, thinking of his smiles and how his eyes light up when he is happy. Draco thinks of Potter in that tower, yearning to go outside and yet more than ready to knock ‘outside’ out with a pan when it comes climbing in through his window.

Potter looks at him with wide eyes, starts lifting one hand like he needs to touch, to anchor and make sure that happened.
“Come on Malfoy, don’t pout.” Potter, that bastard, doesn’t see that Draco is totally not pouting but very unfazed about this all. “Do you
“Pansy, just go and make sure Granger doesn’t kill the badger, I promise Potter won’t jump me the second you are gone.” Malfoy sounds exasperated, like they had this conversation time and time again already, but Parkinson doesn’t listen to him.
I’m sorry, Malfoy. Take your owl and run away. Keep her safe.
“Got the badger,” Ron announces as he enters the room, now carrying the same cage he used when he first presented it to Harry.
. They have a long history of not getting along so spectacularly that they fancied themselves mortal enemies (maybe that was more Draco, Harry had an actual destined nemesis after all, whereas Draco always relished in dramatics to make the dullness of life more bearable) and Draco is pretty sure they tried to kill each other those first weeks after moving in together. Nothing was ever confirmed or admitted, and Draco wasn't clear enough on his own ambitions to recall them with any certainty, but he is sure no one would have shed a tear at a funeral.

He thinks of Potter as a lion, winding around Draco with his soft fur.

Harry sees Seamus hiding behind Dean, taking cover and peeking up now and again to take some well-aimed shots. Ron stands in the middle of the room, uncaring of being everyone’s prime target and reflecting most of the things thrown his way, sending them on to someone else. Neville and Hermione have taken up residence behind the couch, mostly safe from the battle and gathering ammunition up from the floor, only coming up from behind their shelter to unleash their combined forces onto one poor victim. But Ginny is sneaking up behind them, taking advantage of their distraction in picking popcorn from the rug to end their reign of terror and — someone yells and something falls with a heavy thump, and they all freeze.
“Harry Potter, nothing would make me happier.” Draco hopes that Potter doesn’t realise it’s the truth.
Still, even with all the best intentions, Draco knows it will be difficult.
Sure, first names are wonderful in the cover of the dark, but daylight has a way of exposing flaws and downsides with uncompromising honesty. Fantasies rarely live long in the day, no matter how far they reach in the night, and Draco was sure it would be the exact same with any progress they might have made in that nebulous space.
Harry wants to reach out, reassure them both that they aren’t locked in their rooms anymore, that they aren’t alone, but he doesn't quite dare. He doesn’t know how far gone Draco is, and there is stark difference between stroking a pet and suddenly being touched yourself. Harry doesn’t want to startle him, doesn’t want to make it worse. So he keeps his hands at his sides, watching Draco gaze into the distance and wishing he would wake up.
Potter. The realisation reaches Draco like it’s wandering through fog, but it does reach him. That is Potter speaking.
Malfoy is like a drug, Harry can’t get enough of him after getting a first taste, relentlessly seeking that pleasure again and always being met with Malfoy’s cold refusal. There are so many things Harry wants to do to him, wants to do
“Now, I don’t know how old exactly this bottle is, or for how long it has been open —” Harry frowns, pausing with his fork midair. Good call. “— but it says here to use within 8 days after first opening.”
(Besides, Potter wouldn’t hear any complaints right now, no matter how justified.)
“Thank you for ruining my surprise,” Harry says, and everyone goes back to hating the officer.
What Harry was not prepared for, however, was to be treated like a child throwing Lego about in a fit of temper. Ron doesn’t look at him with the annoyance reserved for screaming brats that everyone (including the screaming brat themselves) wishes would just go to sleep already, but it isn’t far off. The difference is that Ron makes Harry feel ashamed for the way he is acting, reminding him that he should know better.
It’s the truth, even, not a brag to make Potter envious. The violin is a wonderful one, light yet sturdy, soft in Draco’s hands and eager to meet his magic, to follow his suggestions and express his feelings. Draco never felt anything quite like it.
Well, this got really appalling, really quick.
“A relief?” Draco sounds odd, hollow, pressing the glossy pages of the magazine against his chest. He looks small on the giant couch, and Harry thinks he’s just said something very stupid.
Not that it’s relevant, a distraction in well-trodden paths of his mind, winding up and down in familiar waves, just exciting enough to keep most of his attention.

Still, despite how long Harry has been denying himself, there is a question here. Harry is
Harry isn’t capable of words yet. Not this early and not without whatever Malfoy took, so he settles on glaring at him. It’s a good glare though, if he says so himself, made more dangerous by Harry's sleep-addled mind and subsequent lack in restraint and impulse control.
so now that it is his own hair — not tamed, by any means, but much more manageable, softer.
The silence, however, is a tad uncomfortable. Draco doesn't usually share that story, he didn't plan on trusting Harry with it either. But there is something compelling about Harry, the way he patiently sits in front of Draco, willing and eager to hear what he has to say. Draco
The rest they cleaned by hand, standing side by side, pleased and exhausted by their triumph over the evil dishwasher, soap bubbles flying as Potter washed and Draco dried. It was nice, companionable, and Draco idly wondered why they didn’t do that from the beginning.
It’s there—that tiny part where he isn’t Potter—where Draco dares to touch, gently laying fingers pale against Potter’s temple. His skin is warm, smooth, clean and cared for even when Potter can’t do it himself.
