Seamus simply shrugged, lifting his backpack to steady it back on his shoulder. "Like I care?"
"Fantastic."
Harry grabbed him by the hair, gently but firm, and made him continue before he closed his eyes to relax. "You take it."
Harry forced himself to stand straight, his eyes locked – reaching for every feature of Draco's body, as if he was afraid he would miss them after tonight. "Should we go back?"
"Nobody wants to know about your love triangle. Very unfortunate you couldn't take part of it..." Snape looked down on them, his sleeky hair stuck to the sides of his face. "Please, continue the conversation elsewhere?" He raised his brows, though his expression remained the same; most terrifying. They both gave a quick nod, swallowing their fear as they were knocked down a notch.
"I don't know. I don't even know where my father is right now. I'm sure he's trying to put some blame on Dumbledore... Seeing his circumstances..."
Draco nodded, though he was barely listening.
Harry bit his lip, watching the boathouse from afar – for a split second reconsidering his actions. Looking at his feet he realized he didn't have much more to lose. He could either be happy or disappointed for going – and if he wouldn't, he would be so all the same. Harry considered this his last call. At one point he would have to continue living his life anyways. Especially since other danger still played with his life like all was just a game. He couldn't allow this to ruin him before all that even worked out. He was chosen, and probably meant to act that way. Harry growled. The thoughts of letting him go stung his heart. If he only didn't have to...
That night the boys slept in the room of requirements as per use. In fact, the boys were meeting up every following night for at least a week or two straight until each and everyone had gotten back from their holiday - so it was no longer safe. Suspicion grew quick between the halls of Hogwarts, no matter how the acts within the castle were a mystery to many all the same. Ronald took great care of keeping an eye on the brunette, and though Hermione could barely stay in the same room with him for longer than an hour, she tried to do so all the same. As if someone told them to. Harry claimed to be clueless about the acts they'd been suspecting him of, yet he feared they already knew. Ginny wouldn't look him in the eye. Even after two weeks of being apart, she kept her distance as if he was a criminal. Could she have told? Would she have told? As soon as every student arrived back at school, it appeared Draco had disappeared again. Like a ghost, he vanished behind the walls, and his touch remained nothing but a pleasant memory. Though the two didn't have many classes left together, he didn't seem to meet him around. Only every now and then Harry claimed to see him walking around in the corridors, heading down to the dungeons to get to the Slytherin's common room. Harry wished to call after him whenever he caught his eye, yet feared he couldn't for many suspected too much already.
Harry clenched his teeth now, again swallowing away some saliva, and crouched down to pick the ripped-off buttons from the ground. "I'm confused," he muttered. "But yes, I suppose,' he continued– nodding as he hid his face by pointing it towards the ground. "We'll come back later some time. Whatever it is that you need."
"Snape!" Harry called at last, stampeding like an ox. "Stop ignoring me, damnit!" He tugged the Professor's cloak, cursing at him – his head dizzy by angst. Snape kicked his elbow, tugging his cloak loose from Harry's grip; being suddenly cautious and askance.
"We are, Ginny, but-"
Harry drew his wand once more, pointing it at the walls ahead of him, knowing this would be the only way to receive mature attention.
Snape flashed his hand, flattened, veins popping on his forehead – ready to have it crossed Draco's cheek so he'd smack off his stool.
"He's fine," Harry muttered as he took a seat, filling his plate with eggs, bread and whatnot. Ron gave him a nod, smiling with his mouth closed, and waved his hand.
"Bloody hell, Harry!" Ron jerked his arm - shuffling back to Hermione, as if she was any safer to sit next to. "Mild concussion my ass."
"-Someone..."
"You piece of shit!" Goyle staggered, lifting his fists ready to throw a punch. Crabbe clamped on to his arms, pulling him down before he managed to strike. Harry stumbled backwards, confused by their pointless reactions – knowing they were never bright enough to see the names as an insult.
"Protego!"
"-No," Harry cut through, his voice suddenly a lot louder. "Please, no. I've got to go. I think I'm going to vomit." Harry rushed on his feet – taking his leave with his mug still half-full.
"I told you." Draco straightened his back. "I want you with me tonight."
"Stop it!" Harry yanked his hand away - drawing his wand as he took his position. "I want answers. From you, from Professor Dumbledore..." Harry drew a breath - his eyes glistening with pain and adrenaline. "I don't think I deserve this."
They discovered each other's bodies slowly; sharing slow and passionate kisses – resulting for pieces of clothing to vanish in rhyme. The bed turned messy. Their neatly flattened sheets were now crumbled together – their pillows pushed down on the floor. No matter his headache growing stronger, Harry clamped onto Draco – wanting more. His scar was burning; his head dizzy – and damn how he loved it. Draco hissed, pushing his teeth down into Harry's neck – biting his skin steady but slow, teasing the shit out of him.
It may have sounded a bit angry and forcing, but Draco smiled at it. He stopped, searching for Harry his eyes as if he was actually surprised by his insult and command. Nevertheless, he kissed his lips again, immediately kneeling down in front of him afterward to pay him in return. Gently. Harry his back writhed as well now. The desk behind him shoved over the wooden floor, and a high pitched sound got audible at it.
Harry couldn't stop smiling and stepped in - waiting for a few seconds - until he greedily wrapped his arms around Draco's neck, pulling him close for a hug. His eyes boiled with tears as they dangled away into the shadows of the tree - burying their faces in each others neck.
"I'm not drinking that," Harry immediately refused. One more drop of alcohol and he'd lose it. Draco just smirked, and pretended like he couldn't hear it – pouring in two small flasks, spilling half of it on the ground. It evaporated at instant.
"Again," Ronald muttered under his breath. "-a substitute teacher." He dropped his head – rubbing his forehead, fearing the worst.
"It's about Draco. Something happened between us, and I can't stop thinking about it. I don't think I can trust him. I mean, do I ever?"
"No, Harry," Dumbledore interrupted him calmly.
Neville shyly smiled, squeezing Lovegood's hand as he leaned closer. "Better than ever."
Goyle gasped for breath, probably trying to gather as much as audacity as he could. "Locomotor Mortis!"
Draco shook his head, what made Harry reply with a dissatisfied mumble.
Harry chuckled, drawing shaped in the blurry state; representing the ceiling. "Have you seen my glasses?"
Harry came to a pause. His wand lingered in his right hand, and he took a breath – reconsidering the situation, it seemed. "To do what?" he asked not persuaded just yet.
"One month," he began slowly, "of detention is what I am giving you for breaking the rules last night. Plus, as many points I can possibly pull from the Griffindor's scoreboard – for you never learn! I'll find you a fine punishment myself, and therefore I'm going to make you regret you came back to school this year. No more contact with Malfoy, for he is my finest student and you make his life even more miserable as it is right now!"
"At school, professor," he replied sheepishly as he looked around – progressing what just happened.
"Yeah," Ron continued. "It's quite a miracle you survived. It appears you've been sleepwalking."
"My dear Harry Potter," his smile was astoundingly.
"What?" Harry breathed. His legs were feeling numb. "Draco? Is he alright?"
'Mr Malfoy, Draco, what a pleasure again. I didn't expect you so early.'
Draco dug his nails into his skin, sucking him long and intensely – his tongue flicking gently along his tip; making sure he would feel it in his entire body. Harry groaned, cursing under his breath – his fingers pulling the blonde's roots as the tickles in his stomach grew stronger. Draco knew he wouldn't last for long if he continued. He could taste his pre-cum gradually filling his mouth.
"I want you to leave me alone," Draco gasped as his blonde hair stuck against his sweaty forehead. "Go!"
"Well fuck you," Ron growled as he bowed his head. Harry clenched his jaws, grabbing his bag – yet not to grab his books.
'What is it, Potter?' Draco smirked as soon as he pressed his lips onto those of Harry again. His tune was mocking, and it appeared that Draco desperately wanted to stroke his tongue along the edges of Harry's teeth again.
Harry stretched out his arm, catching Draco's wand as his enemy clattered against the walls and floor. "Not so sharp, are you?"
"Troubled, you are. A fool too." He grabbed Draco by the collar, pulling him off his stool to drag him out of his storeroom. "One more chance, or I will take my measures."
He took some time, wiggling the wire inside the lock - expecting it to work the same way as it did back when he lived at the Dursleys, yet it didn't. "What do you want that is inside here anyways?" he suddenly asked in slow phase.
"I wont," Draco secured him. "I just want you to go and sleep so we can talk about it tomorrow."
He grabbed her arm once reaching a silent corridor, pulling her aside to get her to look at him. "Ginny, what do you mean?" A frown dug into his forehead. His palms were sweaty, and his stomach turned as she gasped for breath.
"I'm sorry," Harry exhaled as he closed his eyes. "I am lost. I have no clue what's going on with me."
"Nothing..."
"You are the one trying to shine your ass of in the spotlights," Draco replied airy.
"What do you reckon?"
Nearly headless Nick stayed around, if just for a little chitchat, and followed Harry like a curious black cat as soon as he made his way back towards the Great Hall. Though Harry felt almost obligated to follow Malfoy, it didn't seem to feel as good as he thought it would, and so he made his return. Ron and Hermione were still eating. Ron - stuffing his face as always, and Hermione – now silent and absent. She seemed to be bothered. But who wasn't nowadays? Seamus and Dean sat next to them, above all laughing and chattering, and seemed rather merry than usual. Harry didn't feel like talking to either of them, though, and could barely find the effort to wave them a hand as they called. No, he'd rather take place next to Luna, Neville and Ginny – which seemed to be quiet, and enjoyed some peace while they ate.
"Yeah, no shit."
Warning: This chapter contains "serious" smut
Draco took Harry's hand, slowly dragging him along while he studied him from tip to toe. "Are you all alone?"
Harry scratched the back of his head, hissing by the pain pounding up on a specific area – only now realizing he was totally alone. "Y-yeah," he replied as he turned the shower off at last. "I think I dozed off a little."
"You what?"
'Damn,' he groaned. 'Fuck- This... Potter. Yes!'
The blonde rushed towards the bed, quickly pecking the brown-haired boy on the lips before he vanished.
"Excuse me?" Draco spilled with his voice high-pitched. "I am the victim here."
Harry stared at him, his lips pressed into a sour line – unable to speak now hatred and self-blame caused his lungs to cringe. "I know," he replied at last – shaking his head, wiping away the tears off his chin. "I know... And I'm sorry for that."
"Harry," she began as she leaned over. "Tell me what's wrong. Normally you are not as quiet. I'm worrying about you, alright?"
"Has Draco Malfoy been attending school lately?"
Draco pulled his tie, trying to loosen it, and swiftly opened the top two buttons of his blouse in fear of suffocation. His steps were quick and measured – as if he didn't want to be seen by any of his classmates. Or worse. As if he didn't want to see himself – afraid for his own shadow that followed.
The group spread out like butter on warm toast and watched from afar as Pomfrey checked the boy's temperature. "How are you feeling dear?"
Harry looked at him, trying his best to swallow – his voice raw and shaky.
"I recommend you to shut your mouth-hole. You already ruined my mood."
"You don't have the rights-"
He needed to talk.
Harry cocked his head. "How does he know?"
Harry gathered his strength and straightened his back as if he was about to perform an interview. Dumbledore could be the one to know, and he wanted answers.
"Yet no murderer."
Harry held his breath, taking a few steps back - fixing his robes as he watched his lover create a distance.
'Diagon-'
"I've seen you two." Harry looked at him, curious to whatever his response would be, and he raised a brow. "The other night. Don't pretend it didn't happen."
"Harry?" Hermione spoke as he hovered above his desk. She searched for eye contact. "You look terrible, are you okay?"
"Why?" Harry awkwardly giggled as he watched Goyle stagger into the distance. "What did I do?"
"What can I say? I am a lucky bastard. Besides, I haven't done anything wrong."
Draco granted him a brief smile, and shook his head as he repositioned himself on his seat. He was well dressed, as usual. Wearing a black suit and shiny shoes – his dark tie neatly tied around his neck. His blouse all buttoned up. "Well spotted," Draco replied as he rubbed his fine hands together. "Tell me how you have been doing."
Again, nothing he could lean on.
"Draco Malfoy did not survive the damage inflicted on his body. Once Severus found him it was too late. I am so sorry, Harry."
"I need this," Harry mumbled as he squeezed his knee. "You. We could've been friends forever by now, if they didn't steer you the wrong way."
Harry got up on his feet as soon as his body allowed him to. Shaking and sobbing, he tried to make his leaving as unnoticeable as possible. Having his hands cleaned by using the inside of his shirt, he closed his vest – covering the half of his face with the hood hanging from it. He was lucky to wear his normal clothes, now it was Friday night. After going down several stairs, ignoring any person he met (though there weren't many) he locked himself up in the girl's lavatory on the first-floor. Moaning Myrtle sang a song, doing her business on the very toilet she died, and barely noticed Harry's presence until he turned on the sink. Crying under his breath, he pulled off his shirt – cleaning his hands to get the copper stains of dried blood off his skin.
The doors opened in front of him once he opened his eyes. The crackling sound of stones grinding and changing position echoed through the halls, leaving Harry almost exposed – if anyone was the approach him soon. As the passage became all clear to go through, he made the smallest steps he could afford, making his way through the portal – allowing the wall to enclose him at once. The room was soundless. He was in the room of hidden things. He couldn't believe his eyes, finding objects he'd never encountered before. Closets, trophies, piles of books reaching up to the ceiling – wobbling to make the passage too dangerous. This castle would always be a majestic place full of secrets. How amazing, finding out different secrets each time. He wanted to stay here for a while. He wanted to go through the boxes stored with statues, kettles, tools. Who knew what was kept hidden here? A shuffling sound caused Harry to turn immediately. Birds flew above his head, creating spirals and layers of dust to move. He coughed, holding his hand in front of his mouth and nose as he narrowed his eyes – his glasses not fully protecting him now. "Malfoy?" he hissed as he arced his back, moving through a path of old mirrors. "Malfoy, I know you're in here. It's why the passage opened itself. Is this what you want?" He gritted his teeth together, holding a statue that was ready to fall down on him. "A game of hide and seek..." Harry sighed, the level of annoyance was raising once more, and he couldn't believe he'd fallen for this. A simple game of mind fuck. How long was this going to take? When would Draco be done with this? With their awkward experience, and whatnot. How could this still linger them two? Sexual adventures were standard once growing up. Probably half of the school encountered homosexual experiences, if it wasn't just for almost all of the girls. But not Hermione. Hermione would never kiss anyone – to Harry's believes.
"Then ask me specifically," Dumbledore responded.
"I do. I do understand." Harry used his elbows to get up, adjusting his glasses behind his ears. "You're afraid. You're afraid he'll make you leave if you fuck it up once more."
"Malfoy?" He was clever enough not to call his first name again – knowing he'd rarely (to never) do that. His palms got sweaty, and nervousness caused his heart to go crazy. "Are you sure?"
Harry quickly gathered his stuff, gritting his teeth together as he allowed his single book to fly back to its original spot. "I need to find Ron and Hermione. Have you seen 'em?"
"What?" Harry shook his head, his eyes boiling up with tears. An immediate headache causing a lack of breath. "Why the... What about what we said before? What about fuck everyone else! We are who we are right? What fucking changed! What did I do!?"
"We're not meant to be with each other, alright? In fact, I found someone else."
"Why not?" Draco seemed rather disappointed. His always porcelain pale face burst with a colour possible to be called "ravish me red", and his lips were swollen.
"Great," Snape muttered. "I love complicated..."
"Don't worry," Draco breathed. "Though I expected you to be less of a wimp."
"Harry, are you okay? It's past bedtime, and I'd like to freshen up a bit before hopping off to bed." Clearly Hermione's voice. "Are you surely alright?"
~ The door slammed shut. Harry rubbed his left cheek, burning with heat, cursing as he kicked the door.
Harry frowned, deeply encouraged to do some more eavesdropping – knowing his friends were hiding something, if just for him. Where they in love? Perfect, he muttered to himself – they ecstasy was gone. He would be a third wheel from now on. However, something as small as that couldn't care for now. Besides, it would be a benefit. Hermione and Ron running off together, every once in a while – to do whatever they had to do... This meant he would have some time of his own. Precious minutes, ready to be spilled. Malfoy would be his project, for now. School could hardly keep him busy, knowing his head wandered off into clouds every now and then. First he had to know what it meant. What they meant. And how they could fix it. Draco, floating around his head like radiowaves. He couldn't concentrate. Malfoy seemed to have created another way of approaching him. Sending messages around, through the walls, giving him hints. It even seemed like he managed to slither into his dreams. Though Harry could find this hardly unpleasant, for some kind of odd reason, it did keep him awake at night. If not in cold sweat, it would be by utter excitement – ready to ask for more. There was something up with this blonde-haired boy, and he had to know what. Hoping to find him outside, leaning against a tree, sitting on the grass – hopefully on his own – but in vain. He wasn't there.
Draco finally moved his ass, getting up at last, and approached him. Their eyes meeting along the way. "Friendly approaching is not appreciated, I see..." He wetted his lips and shook his head, tightening his blazer around his body. "I wanted to talk about the upcoming school year. I expect no nonsense?"
"What did Snape tell you? I got a shit ton of detention."
Snape allowed him to finish speaking, yet disarmed him with a spell once the last vowel left his mouth. "How dare you to raise your wand at me." Strange, how even now the tune of his voice barely changed. Ever so slow, ever so waspish.
Harry got up on his feet, rushing his hands through his hair – walking circles. "Why," he cried as he closed his eyes. "Why didn't you tell me?"
"No," Dumbledore replied once more - almost as if he felt guilty.
Harry held his breath – his eyes wide open as Draco too again his lead; opening the buttons of Harry's trousers like an eagle going for its prey. His breathing got faster, his palms went sweaty, and at the slightest touch near his private parts he flinched – his back quickly covered in sweat.
Drace turned his back, extending one of his arms - using a finger to secretly wipe a tear way. "It will be easier this way."
Harry made his leaving as quick as possible – almost afraid to look back, as if he thought to see it had all been a simple illusion. Though it wasn't even near nighttime yet, he claimed to go to bed anyways. If just to forget about what happened – for good. As both swallowing and breathing became almost impossible, he loosened his tie as well. With swift, tugging moves he pulled his buttons to open his cardigan, and with great hurry he rushed through the halls. He wanted to make his way up to the seventh floor – ready to hop into his dorms and vanish for the night. It was only then, right before meeting the painting on the wall, he saw Hermione and Ron standing to the side. They were kissing. Their lips touching, gasping for breath – hungrily – at every twist they made. Their eagerly grabbed for more, tugging their clothes as they went. Hermione groaned at Ron's touch, a smile tugging her lips as Ron made his way down her neck – characters making their way from their paintings, if just to snatch on ether one of them. It was almost sickening, how Harry stood there watching his best friends making out – he being the third wheel again. Standing there, Harry froze. His stomach twisting by jealousy; seeing the innocent bursting out of them. He wanted that too. He wanted to experience the same harmless, secret lovemaking. He wanted to be a part of it. Hermione, finally opening her eyes as Ron harked his teeth along the skin of her neck, spotted Harry on the stairs. She gasped for breath, unwell by the caught – and Harry stood there.
"I knew it," Hermione replied – shaking her head. "You've been so aggressive and absent lately. I understand how invigorating this can be... Or well I don't, it's probably a boyish thing, but you..." She clenched her teeth together. "Stop the fighting. Or whatever you are up to. Malfoy is a foul person, we all know that, but that doesn't mean you have to lower yourself to his level. If we are lucky, he'll get suspended one day giving us a reason to have a great party." She chuckled to herself – placing a hand on Harry's knee. "Don't worry about it. If Draco is planning on fighting you again, I know for a fact you will win. Besides, what a surprise. I never knew Draco had it in him."
"There we are."
"You're a big boy," Harry stated - pushing himself up from the floor with his elbows. Draco bit down his lower lip, seeming as if he felt rather pissed, yet pulled the brunette up by his arm - pushing him forcefully against the desk. His hands moved further down Harry's hips, and with his mouth closed he touched the edges of his own teeth with his tongue - making sure they all were covered with saliva. "Don't talk," he continued after.
Draco didn't reply. In silence he looked down on him, enjoying his power. Loving how he felt like someone at last.
"Tell me about Draco," Harry sighed as he dropped his attitude. He swallowed, hoping to make the following more easy to say, yet his voice was broken.
Hermione cocked her head, surprised but worried. She knew how easily he could get into troubles, but doing terrible things, what was that supposed to mean? "Tell me," Hermione gasped as he crossed her arms. Harry bowed his head further down, shaking no. "Tell me Harry."
"It's just through here," Draco smiled once he gave him a glimpse from over his shoulder. They ended up in an empty classroom. The same one where it all started about a year ago. Harry leaned onto one of the bookshelves, out of breath, as he tried to steady his messed-up glasses on the bridge of his nose. "Fuck," he breathed, wiping the sweat of his brow. He drew his eyes towards the blonde boy who seemed to be perfectly fine. "How on earth are you not out of breath. Damn..."
Harry pursed his lips now, glancing over Hermione's shoulder to search for the sight of someone too, but didn't seem to put any effort in listening.
"Well, you're a prick," Harry snapped as he turned his back on him. "Besides, I didn't ask for any of this."
"I presume." Snape raised his brows once more, shrugging as he prepared to continue his walk. "What could have possibly happened?"
"Harry," Ron started, folding his hands together as he leaned in. "I know you have feelings for her. I've known it from the very beginning. It's always been a battle between us."
"Don't worry about that, Harry. All that matters is that you're awake, and that you're okay."
Draco leaned against the desk, having put on his shirt already though he couldn't close it since it had no buttons left.
"What- Why are you here? What are you doing?" Harry breathed, grabbing his head – a sudden headache frying his brain.
"What are you implying? What are your real desires?" Harry his voice was soft – showing some weakness of being uncertain about this situation. The drug did not just befoul his breathe or motions, but also his feelings.
His roommates laughed, seemed to start throwing things at each other, and a sock landed right next to Harry's face. That's enough, he thought.
Ron chuckled under his breath and glanced up at Harry, lifting his brows highly enjoyed. 'Oh please, it was just a joke.'
"You're a sick bastard," Crabbe gritted through his teeth as he dragged his friend along.
Hermione appeared from behind the gate wielding a concerned frown. "Harry, please talk to me." She sat down next to him, grabbing his hand as she leaned in. Her hands were as soft as her words. She was calm and loving for once. "You know Ron and I will always love you, no matter what. Right?"
"Aren't we good enough for you?"
Draco gave him a single nod before he dropped his head. He remained defeated.
Draco looked up, smiling from ear to ear, walking straight up to the brunette; crushing his lips onto his for he seemed to have missed him too. Harry eased under his touch, gently grabbing his face to pull him closer – the taste of him sweet as ever on his tongue. He forgot all about the question, looking Draco straight in the eye once their lips broke, and he smiled. "I've missed you," he confessed. The blonde batted his eyes, a modest, genuine smile crossing his lips as he reached out to hold his hand.
"I'll be your King," Draco simply replied, a smug smile crossing his lips.
Harry got sucked away, in the end thrown out of a dusty fireplace, and he coughed as he rolled over to his eyes – not daring to open his eyes just yet. Had it gone wrong again? After all these years of no-trouble-traveling? He gritted his teeth, took off his glasses, and rubbed his eyes as he tried to breathe through his with dust stuffed nose. He was quite lucky though. At least his glasses weren't broken this time.
He didn't need to go far. The entrance to the room of Requirements was located at the left corridor. Walking closer, he did his former ritual, and the door opened in a flash – as if it was open already. Harry could hear a radio play as he got in. Music echoed among the endless piles of stuff. Someone had to be in here, and when Harry thought of the one thing (or more like person) he thought of Draco, and what happened the other day. Harry flinched as a crowd of woodpeckers rushed through the air – almost attacking him on the head – and he grasped for a vase he almost knocked over doing so. This place was a mess full of forgotten and hidden stuff. Filled with treasures. And Harry searched for his own lost treasure. "Malfoy," he called as he wandered through the "halls" of junk – his voice still low, as if he had to stay quiet in case anyone else peeked around. Maybe, if Malfoy was around, he wasn't alone. Who knew about his business here? Though the music appeared to come closer, a genre containing dramatic piano riffs and crying breaths of violin (something not to Harry's taste), he still couldn't find the source. "Malfoy," he hissed through his teeth, almost annoyed now – his head spinning by nervousness and headache caused by the terrible taste of music. "Where the fuck are you, man?"
Harry's heart skipped a beat, however he remained cautious. "What did Snape tell you?"
"Potions, was it?" Ronald asked as he raised his brows – trying to remember their schedule. "For you two, yes," Hermione stated proudly. "I'll be heading to Herbology. In fact, I'll be heading there right now. Professor Sprout wants to see me."
"Potter," Draco spoke – his voice surprisingly soft. He remained seated, his hands folded together as he sat bend-over. "You came."
Harry quickly nodded - wiping his nose with his sleeve as he walked to the side - another tear drawing down his cheek. "I wish you were a girl."
"That you weren't dead!"
"You were trying to get inside my head... You were a death eater all along."
"That's it?" Neville asked – raising his brows as if not impressed. Luna was simply listening. Her dreamy eyes stuck blank to Harry's glasses, but he didn't mind. He truly liked her, even though her weirdness. Harry gave a nod in return – his mug closed between his hands, as if he was holding a hot mug of coco during the winter. He simply felt sick, nervous and destroyed.
WARNING: PARENTAL ADVISORY EXPLICIT CONTENT COMING UP
"So that's it?" Draco muttered as he looked at the brunette's back. "We are going to pretend like nothing ever happened?"
"Since I finally realize what my real desires are," the blonde repeated cockier.
Draco pulled back, looking at Harry - loosening his grip. "We will figure something out."
"Fuck off," Harry scoffed – expecting this to be a joke. "It's been fun, everyone. Now give me my glasses and get out. Who took my wand?"
"About what?" the others asked at the exact same time. "Excuse me Harry," Hermione cut through as she stepped to the side. "You've been acting strange. What has been going on your mind? Where on earth have you been?"
Draco's expression softened, only now realizing they were holding hands the entire time – squeezing out their anger, their palms sweaty at their touch.
"No running allowed inside the premises"
" I want to hear it," Harry continued as he cried, "from you, from professor Dumbledore. For hell I care Lucius Malfoy tells me so." He sniffed and dropped his shoulders. "Anyone... Just tell me the truth?"
"This is my place," she yelped as he approached him – studying his body like she was a kid feeding her eyes in a sweetshop. "That's blood," she marked, pursing her lips to hide a smile.
'This is a Mimbulus Mimbletonia. It's a very rare-"
Draco brushed his fingers down his chin, and took his black briefcase – ready to leave the train, knowing this had been a bad idea. He quickly loosened the tie, shame taking over him, and took his first step to leave. "Get your balls out off your ass, Potter."
"I'm tired," Harry respond, shaking his head. "I can't eat, I can't sleep. I feel ultimately horrible." He pressed his lips, bowing his head to keep his eyes from watering, "I've done some terrible things, Hermione."
"Get out of the way, everyone. You are giving this boy a stroke with all the questions."
Draco batted his eyes, holding his arm as if he was afraid it was about to fall off. He shrugged, his lips pressed into a sour line – as if his mommy told him he couldn't get another cookie right before dinner. "Dude, tell me. What happened to you?"
WARNING: SMUT SMUTTY SMUT SMUT SMUT... Oh, and it's terrible
'Are you...?' Mr Borgin started.
"No, in no specific way. I want you to stay, here and forever."
"Harry," Dumbledore smiled at him, his voice soft and blessed by his wisdom. "We both know I'm not here to punish you, but I do wish to know where you've spend the night. We were most worried."
"Blimey Potter."
"Hah," Harry respond, his mind drifting off. "You're looking good, Longbottom. Feeling okay too?"
"Things have to end, Harry," Draco simply responded, not having the nerve to turn back around. "I don't expect you to understand. I just want you to accept it." Draco gritted his teeth, wiping his runny nose with the him of his blouse - stretching his shoulders to adjust his attitude.
"Harry?"
"Harry, you know you're always save with me, as in... I respect your every choice and action. Don't forget that alright?" She placed her hand on his shoulder trying to get him to look at her. Harry met her eyes, nodding gratefully – though a smile was barely shown. "If you're ready on telling me what's bothering you, do it? Alright? I've got to go now. I have an appointment with Professor Sprout. It's about-" She shook her head, her hair shivering to all sides in a hurry. "Never mind, I'll tell you later." She gave him a hug in a rush. "Goodbye Harry!"
Harry couldn't breathe. His cheeks fluttered bright red, and his book became of sudden interest. "Sorry, wh-what? Malfoy?" He scoffed, avoiding any eye contact. "What about him?" He couldn't afford it to speak out the word us.
"Of course," Harry nodded. "So you'll just be at home then?"
'Scared, Potter?' Draco smirked as he stroked his thumb along his lower lip to get rid of a smear of Harry's blood. He didn't seem to be disgusted by that.
'Please, now finish me,' Draco dared to whisper as his cheeks turned more red. Harry moved his lips up to Draco's and kissed them gently to stroke his lips down his chest afterward. He made his way toward Draco's penis again, desiring for the unfinished climax he was about to manage in hopefully half a minute. In a flash, Harry moved his lips around his erection again, sucking him faster than he had before – apparently wanting to give Draco that blessing climax as well now.
"Understood," Hermione nodded – struggling to get on the train with her luggage balancing on its wheels. Harry gave her a hand. Looking back and forth, he hoped to get a sneak preview of his white-haired enemy, but unfortunate. He wasn't around. Eventually, finding a fine spot next to Ron – who planted his ass next to the girl he'd been stalking for days – he waited for their journey to start. He was nervous. Very nervous.
Seamus couldn't hold his chuckle, and hid his face.
"Such as what, Harry?"
"And what is that?"
It's funny. No matter how hard you try you never seem to see everything that's going on. Harry would spend hours at night, speculating whether he and Draco would ever end up together, being the couple he wanted to be. Wouldn't it be great if they simply came out together, and made an end to all of this? Harry's thoughts were no longer his own. No longer did he wish to become the greatest wizard so in the end he could kill those that tried to kill him. He wished to become the greatest man. The man Draco would truly fall in love with - blemishing the fear that leaked from his pores; the twitch in his brow and the crack in his grin whenever he pretended to be more than he was. Draco wasn't the only one that wished to be free. Harry dreamed of such life all the same. No matter the fame, feeding him on sober days; he wished he could pass on his scar all the same for he would be granted a normal life.
"Potter!"
'Hears about what? The way you decided to have your revenge by slapping me on the cheek? He'll feel ashamed. I assure you. You used a flattened hand.'
Once the realization came there was no solid light source around, Harry grabbed his wand and flicked it – using Lumos, if just to find the flaws on the edges of Draco's skin. They both narrowed their eyes. Their lips burned after kissing for approximately half an hour, and the both of them noticed the happenings inside their own pants. The tension caused their teeth on edge. The eager to curse at each other became stronger every minute – if just by the way they seemed so used to. Never they could have thought for this to happen. The both of them, laying down onto a desk – shirtless, investigating each other's body, though their lower parts were still forbidden area. Harry suppressed the sensation boiling in his abdomen. The tip of his tongue rushed along the edges of Malfoy's teeth as he twisted his head, hands full of hair forcing the blonde to come closer. Their legs were interlocked. Malfoy on top, the tip of his nose brushing against Harry's cheekbone as he begged for more – his lips doing the talking without a sound.
"I- I don't know," Harry stammered, "Maybe a little, yes."
"I'm done," Harry muttered – trying to keep his face straight with anger, though his lips started to tremble and his eyes began to water. "I'm done with you." He took a big breath before he turned his back to him, pulling the sheets over his head. "I want you to go," he gritted through his teeth – waiting for the weight to leave the bed. Though a silence fell, he could not feel the blonde leave.
"After everything I've done for you. I could have gotten you expel-"
"I love you too..." came from the other side of the bed after a few minutes of silence. But Harry was already fast asleep...
Draco pressed his lips into a sour line, as if he was in true pain, and ripped his eyes off him. "It was an experiment," he spilled, his voice shaky – barely fed with confidence, yet a cry of laughter escaped his throat. "And as I thought..."
The school no longer felt magical to him. The reason of his presence here seemed a mere lie, and he was close to losing all of his friends. This place no longer felt like home. He no longer followed the education of witchcraft and wizardry. It felt like he walked the distorted path to his death row. He'd lost his appetite - just as his sanity - and thought of opening up to professor Dumbledore. He wanted to lay low for a while. Perhaps stay at the Weasleys, or any place else just to be far away from Draco. Luna confronted Harry the other day. She claimed his head was full of wrackspurts once more - an infection cause by tiny, invisible magical creatures - possible to be expelled by thinking positive thoughts. Depressing, reminding him he didn't have any.
"And?" Draco asked after a snort. Harry bowed his head, unable to speak – for he didn't understand what he was asking for.
Ripped by arms enclosing him, he tried to avoid Hermione's caring treatments – who immediately grabbed an handkerchief to stop Harry from flooding the pavers with blood. "Hands off," Hermione muttered as Harry tried to stop her actions – his thoughts still out of space. "It's just a nosebleed," Harry replied at last – taking the cloth to do the job himself. "Must be the weather," he muttered as he squeezed his eyes to keep the sun from burning his pupils. "Besides, I'm starving."
It's good to have you back.
Draco growled, casting another spell towards Harry's appearance again (he was standing on a distance) but missed again, as if he meant to. Several vials and jars broke, and many dried frog eyes rolled over the floor - though they didn't come very far.
"Don't worry," the voice said. Harry turned his head, looking for the one to hold him to the bed. The blonde sat down on the other side of the mattress; his shirt partially unbuttoned. "It's just me, alright?"
He, like the fragrant taste of rain, both destroyed and delighted him. For far too long he hadn't been able to enjoy his presence, yet now he was back everything seemed to be so much different. He took his glasses, rubbing his eyes before he took a rest against the wall – looking outside the window, trying to ease his mind with the view.
"Seamus. Malfoy. Where is he?"
"It's all in your head," Draco replied softly - guiding Harry onto his back. Harry could no longer respond. He was asleep...
He was covered in dirt from head to toe, his glasses barely see-through, and once the morning would arrive he would surely be cursed with his first ever hangover. Funny, how Hagrid managed to make Harry an even worse student - and neither of them cared. Truth to be said, his plans got carried quite elsewhere once he reached the nearby corridors of his rooms. Not just because he appeared to be a lot more wasted than he thought he was once leaving Hagrid's shack, but also because a person approached him from the dark - reaching up for his glasses to remove them.
WARNING: SMUT SMUTTY SMUT SMUT SMUT...
"I want to sleep with you tonight."
"You're at the hospital wing, Harry. You've had a little concussion." Hermione smiled down on him, happy to see him in a better state. He seemed calm now. Secured.
"Sorry?"
"W-what are you doing? Potter?"
"- Don't ever do that again," Harry sighed, letting go of him. "It's not funny."
Draco was lost, because before he could even finish his sentence, a large groan got audible, and his back writhed without his permission. Harry had covered up the tip of his penis with his lips, and started to press several kisses on it after smirking for just a second – realizing how priceless Draco's expression had been. He loved his naked body. It looked just like pale, precious porcelain.
"Draco, no, stop it! He will kill us!"
Hermione actually wanted to ask what Harry was up to, especially since h announced his doings with "it", but a soon as she threw another glance at her book, she decided just not to. So with a brief nod and a forced smile she turned, heading towards the common room after to leave Harry on his own.
Dumbledore rose from his chair that very moment, raising Harry's attention by a gesture. Harry cursed under his breath. His stomach needed at least a bit of content before he was ready to continue the day, and so he grabbed an apple – stuffing it in his pocket.
Dinnertime. It took Harry way too long to realize he hadn't seen Malfoy all day, and only as he walked into the great hall – meeting the blond halfway as he tried to escape in a hurry – he came to the realisation of missing him. Harry slowed his pass. He wished to talk to him, if just to nag about his absence, but caught something different – resulting for him to stop and stand still. Draco did the exact same, seeing his enemy ahead of him, but seemed too exhausted to give him his usual nasty look. He simply batted his eyes, his face pale by mental destruction, and turned his back on him – taking a second exit to avoid any contact. Harry dropped his tensed shoulders. Disappointment caused his eyes to drop, and he wondered with all he had dear what on earth happened today. For now he felt lost. Though he was meant to eat, his appetite was gone. He felt sick to his stomach knowing something happened with Malfoy. Never did he lose his condescending attitude, until now. Something was wrong, and Harry had to find out.
"We can't," a voice responded from behind. Harry quickly moved, opening his mouth to let out a gasp, a cry.
"Guys," Harry chugged as he sat down – his arms folding in front of him.
"Please, do some homework. Go to class. Borrow a library book. Your attempt was most disappointing."
"Harry, what have you done?" Ron muttered baffled – Hermione still holding onto him.
Harry shook his head – lowering his chin to look into his glass. The pulp of the orange juice swirled to the surface as he tipped his glass to the sides.
"As if I'd be interested in any of your fruity activities. Shopping for new pyjamas and picture books so your mommy can read you to sleep."
Harry sighed and blinked as he looked up at the ceiling, trying to remember what happened the other night. "How long was I gone?" He tried to remain calm as he pushed himself up - trying to find out what time it was.
"If I must."
'Plans changed,' Lucius replied as he moved to the center of the shop and glanced around. Draco followed him shortly after.
"Malfoy?" Harry stuttered as he turned to the side of his bed – ready to step out and go for a hunt. A hand from behind pulled him back onto the bed, causing Harry to twitch as he huffed in fear.
"What are you going to do?" Harry dug his fingers down his spine – his nails scratching.
"Malfoy," Harry hissed, rushing after him as he swore he could see him vanishing behind a corner. "Malfoy, wait!" His shoes echoed through the halls. Nearly headless Nick wandered around, his shadow creating a cold vibe around the area, and he wished to talk to Harry – if just to thank him once more for all of his help during their second year (he could never shut up about it).
"Is that what you were doing it for?"
Draco poked his side, chuckling – this being the actual first time Harry heard an honest chuckle from his ever so lasting enemy.
"A what?" Harry scoffed, shaking his head - ready to throw a comment if Draco did not pull down his guard once more. For a second the blonde went through his knees, as if he was really attempting to give him head any moment, and his fingers fold around the buttons of his pants. As his knees met the solid floor, a soft sigh escaped his throat, and he chortled - barely audible.
"Surely," Snape replied, his pointy nose creating more darkness than any of the window blinds. "You should be punished for your lack of self-defence. Look at yourself. Pathetic you are."
Later that afternoon he found some of his friends sitting in the great hall; reading books and chatting about the ball last night. New couples were formed, and others were broken. Hermione, for example, was sitting all alone – holding in tears while avoiding any eye contact. Harry wanted to visit, give her a hug and ask what happened, but got no opportunity since Ronald came around to spoil it. Hermione cursed, crying her eyes out as she hobbled away – Ron lingering at her feet as he spoke of his apologies.
"I'm not." Harry forced a smile on his face. "Just a little stomach ache, that's all."
"Shouldn't you eat, Harry?" Luna smiled at him – rubbing his back in all of the sudden. Though Harry appreciated her effort, he gestured her to stop as he straightened his back.
Harry wished to reply but couldn't. Not at first. He shook his head once more and turned away - freeing himself from his comforting touch.
"The same old song."
"But I want to," Draco continued, moving his lips down his jawline to kiss his neck. Harry closed his eyes, the frown increasing on his forehead.
The blonde took his space to rub his eyes, and pulled the sheets close to his chest – leaving Harry naked aside, his cheeks flushing bright red. "Don't-" he growled as he managed to grab a corner, if just to cover his parts. "I didn't dress."
Draco's movements stopped. The clacking sound of his shoes echoing stopped. Harry's heartbeat became almost audible through the entire space, and his breathing stopped. "Please, just tell me what you want."
Draco scoffed, serving him a grin before he moved down – placing his attention elsewhere. Grabbing the hems of Harry's trousers, he pulled them down – no longer willing to talk. He wanted action, just as much as he did. Harry flinched once more, his head heavy and warm – as if he'd been standing upside-down for too long. He wanted to stop him, hold his hands, take action himself – if just because he felt too strange to let the blonde to anything to him first. Draco held him, grabbing his cock as he bit down his lip – pulling his roots to keep Harry down – resulting for him to groan in vain.
Harry pushed the obstacles aside blocking his way – the path towards his sly fellow student seeming a lot longer than it should be, and once he was about to reach his destination, he slipped face flat on the hall pavement. Harry was left with a chipped tooth and a bleeding, swollen lip. Trying his best to crawl back up, friends gathered to give him a hand.
"You seem jealous," Harry replied – his eyebrows raising. He could enjoy this.
"Nothing at all. I am just concerned. They have also told me that if you did sleep in your dorms you would have quite a lot of nightmares." Dumbledore looked down at a piece of parchment. "And you seem to talk in your sleep?"
'Venting anger on books, I see?' Harry spoke then, revealing himself from between the bookshelves. He didn't seem to fear, though. A miniscule, challenging smile crossed his lips even - to Draco's frustration.
"Then tell me..."
"Is he awake?"
"Am I now?"
A sweet voice entered his ears from up close. Luna Lovegood dressed up like a poison ivy held his hand what caused him to turn. "You seem worried?"
"I'd ask you the same question," Harry snapped back as he scratched the back of his head.
Ron threw a glance at Hermione, barely able to keep his laugh in, and both followed Hagrid who gestured them to come out of the train and follow. Obviously they had to get out now too, and continue their normal business while their other musketeer was being punished a heartless soul.
Harry smiled as he led out a cry, nodding his head as he held the blonde's face. "I love you too, so, so much. I just don't know what to do anymore. You are driving me crazy." He looked up, his eyes red and irritated - as if he hadn't slept in days. "I can't go on without you."
"Did I make the right decision?" Draco's eyes were awfully widened – his hair roughly patched to the sides. Harry established himself – leaning onto the dresser to his right, finally able to look at his company. Though the answer would've been unsure to many, Harry knew he made the right decision. It was after all what they most desired - the both of them. Nevertheless Harry didn't answer. Not yet at least. Draco straightened his back, unbuttoning the first few buttons of his cotton white shirt – causing him to almost choke by adrenaline rushing through his bloody veins. "Please," Draco muttered, his throat sore by the filthy air he breathed.
"-You knew,"
"Shall I hold your glasses?" Luna asked as she got off her seat.
"Friends?"
'Well, the only conclusion that I can draw is that you've wet yourself,' referring to the large wet spot at the crotch of his pants. The spot had been a result of Harry's prank, though. As boyish as he rarely could be, he decided to put that specific spot under the shower after playing a game of quidditch.
"No worries. I want to show you something again."
"Why didn't you tell me?" Ginny cried, her fingers digging into his shoulders. "We seemed so real."
Harry's eyes became awfully small. No matter what he meant to say with that, it got his stomach turning. The taste of his lips remained on his tongue, and though it was venom, he wanted more.
Ginny called. She stood on her toes, softly knocking on the solid wood of the door – afraid to interrupt Harry's business. "Harry, we are leaving. Are you ready to go?"
Harry raised his brows. "About what?"
Harry softly closed the sliding door, resulting for Draco to swiftly flick his wand so the awnings fell down with a noise – granting them privacy.
Harry smirked and fixed his collar. "Fine by me. I still have to pass through that front door, though. I'm sure you can help me out?"
"Harry!" Hermione called – her judging eyes burning in Harry's back. "Stop this nonsense at once!" He had no clue whether it was about their fight, or him following Malfoy, but he couldn't care. Now his stomach was sick, and his curiosity took all of his attention, he simply went – knowing where to find Malfoy in case of losing. He was lucky once realising Granger didn't follow, and even though the arguments with his best friends, he didn't feel like solving them.
Harry raised his brows, shocked by his friends confession. "Oh, okay. I see..." Awkward conversation. "And when are you planning on telling Hermione? You better not break her heart."
Harry pursed his lips, narrowing his eyes as if the light was burning him. "Through the chimney. Obvious, isn't it? According to my poor appearance, as you would call it."
"Sir?"
"I don't want you to feel like this," he muttered, apparently caring.
"You and Draco. "
"You don't have to," Draco comforted him as he held his face. "You don't have to. You don't have to do anything. Right now I just want you to lay down and sleep. Alright?"
It seemed like the practice was cut off, knowing everybody was a little of guard for whatever reason possible. Harry had his own, resulting for him to wander around the castle with no particular goal ahead. Harry felt disgusted. His breath seemed sour, and he hadn't been shaving for days. His hollowed eyes gave him the impression he hadn't sleep for days. He wanted to visit Professor Snape. Draco's blood was still on his hands, if not under his nails, and he felt sick thinking about it. It was only later that afternoon he found Snape wondering through the halls of the second floor.
"I thought it was a simple rumour, but it's true. You are a death eater."
Draco didn't reply. He could only look at him, full of hatred as the red substance ran down his cheekbone.
Harry quickly hopped off his bed, grabbing his trunk along with Hedwig sleeping in her cage – trying not to wake her along the way.
"Since when did you get so affective?" he mumbled against Draco's lips.
Snape stopped, his eyes widening - his muscles slightly tensing as he sighed inaudibly.
He gritted his teeth, dropping his shoulders – giving in to his own lies. Who was he fooling? He'd been slumbering from time to time. Not even lecture could reach his brains now.
"What do you mean?" Harry barked in fear and defence. "Does your father know about us?"
"Are you going to leave?" Harry asked at last. A vein pounded right under the upper skin of his forehead, heavily visible. Draco didn't respond. He stared at his feet, defeated. It was like he was shrinking by utter shame. "Answer me," Harry cried, spit leaving his mouth unintentionally. Draco looked at him. His judging eyes stung Harry as they met, and he rubbed his cheekbone, right under his black eye. He hissed, as if forgotten he had any of the bruises at all, and batted his eyes again – trying to gather words from afar.
"Why were you heading for that boy?"
"Afraid that I wouldn't?" Draco stood at the end of the stretched boathouse, - hands in his pockets while leaning against the wooden wall. Harry sighed deeply, chuckling under his breath as he walked closer.
"Please, don't hide yourself from me."
The world stopped spinning.
'Diagon alley?' he asked nevertheless.
A knocking noise caused Harry's heart to skip a beat, and pull back – resulting his head to bump against the tiled wall behind him. "Yeah?" he tried to start with some volume – though a stutter was noticeable in his raw voice.
"I'm sorry," Harry muttered throughout Ronald's story, not even listening anymore. "Draco!" He hurried on his feet, bumping against others – ignoring their cursing and calling. "Draco!" His voice was raw, out of control. The blonde locked his eyes, his attitude calm and motionless, until he rose from his seat – turning his back on him as if he wasn't worthy. "Draco wait!"
"Stop being such a pussy," Draco grinned. "Take it."
His voice shut down as he grabbed his towel – turning his head over his shoulder to find the blurry shadow from no red-haired boy called a Weasley, but a white-haired tall guy, his skin as pale it made him forget how to breathe.
Harry had his wand drawn. His view, black by anger, caused all of his muscles to tense, and he threw a spell after he pushed Malfoy down to the ground – giving the blonde no possibility to respond in defence.
"Sorry," Harry continued as he investigated the shades of blood on the flowery patterned handkerchief. "I was thinking."
"Just take it."
"Sure?" Neville replied – full of relieve.
"Potter."
"I don't know," Harry muttered, watching the professor leave. "I really don't know..."
Draco stared at Harry with widened eyes - apparently having his wand dropped or put away cause he was rubbing his fingers along his knuckles now (the once that crushed Harry's nose seconds ago). He stared at him as if he'd just seen a ghost.
"Get him out of my face!" Goyle barked as he forced his eyes shut. Harry backed off, pensively scratching the back of his head – hiding his cold hand down the edges of his oversized jumper.
Draco shrugged, dropping Harry's hand as he walked away, rubbing his hands together. Harry was right. He would if he knew his son got into trouble, again.
Harry chuckled under his breath - snorting as he wiped a tear away. Shaking his head in vain. "How? How are we going to get through this?"
"I'm sorry, Harry." Draco turned around at last. No evidence of sadness left on his face to be read. He walked up, lifting his arm to hug him, yet stopped midway. "I have to go. I can't be seen outside. Not after all the things I've been caught for. They will have me expelled."
Dumbledore's expression merely changed until he looked at Snape. He was still standing in the corner as if he didn't want any part of it.
He thumbed the tip of his tongue along his chapped lips, and looked at his roommates – forcing a smile on his face as he got up from bed. "Excuse me."
"It must be here somewhere," he muttered as he crouched in front of the drawer. After some pulls he realized it was well locked, and there would be no way to open it unless they owned the key. Snape would be far too intelligent to leave his property easy to theft. No spell in their possession would work. "it's locked."
"How," Harry cried under his breath. "How could you! How could you lie to me..."
Harry fetched his blouse from the floor – along with his other missing uniform parts. "That is what you wanted?" Harry straightened his back – noticing the buttons missing from his shirt – and cursed under his breath.
"I asked you twice," Ron muttered as he stuffed his face with the last bits of crust, "-if you wanted a slice. You didn't respond."
The day came slowly to an end. After ignoring both of his best friends, not even granting them a single look, he scattered through the castle with his head held low. Hurt by the way his dearest friends kept him a secret, he decided to visit Hagrid around tea-time, thinking he could help him off his jealousy. Hargid was most famous for his loneliness, it seemed, and appeared to handle well during most circumstances. Maybe he could ease his pain, if just by serving him a small mug of gin. Hagrid made those mistakes before. Why not again? Though Harry barely liked the taste of alcohol, it took ease of the weight he carried on his shoulders – and it would numb his tastebuds in time anyway. Though his visit was short, and no alcohol came to it, it definitely gave him the capability to vent out his heart, and just talk.
Though breakfast was about to come to an end, Harry knew he would be able to gobble at least some scrambled eggs – right before his class would start.
"What, no? She's my best friend. Always has been. I'm happy for them."
"Take it easy," Ron supported him as he shoved a little closer.
Harry batted his eyes, avoiding any eye contact, and gritted his teeth as Draco's judgemental attitude fulfilled him. "Well maybe you should quit the wining and do something about it." Harry clenched his fists, ready to give him a punch, and approached him slowly – his nose ready to touch his. Their breaths stuck onto each other, but nothing happened yet. "Make my day," he continued. "You weak piece of shit."
"I still remember this," Harry commented breathlessly as he whipped the tears of his cheeks. "I will never stop remembering this." Harry could hear a weak cry. A cry from a boy he hurt so terribly with a spell he should have never used. He scoffed once more as he took his distance. "You are trying to punish me." He looked at the both of them. "Why are you doing this? The both of you..."
"Now tell me. What about Draco?" Hermione looked at him, her massive frown caused her forehead to wrinkle, and her nose came close to Harry's cheek.
"Leave!"
"Everyone knows already," Harry cut through. "You don't have to do this. It's not going to solve anything."
"Doesn't surprise me, really."
That night it became almost impossible for him to fall asleep. After two showers; trying to scrub all of Malfoy's blood off his body, he dropped to bed – paying no attention to Ronald rattling about his new girlfriend. No one seemed to know about Draco's health, nor did anyone ask about his leaving. Harry's eyes were red of crying, and his cheeks hurt – the salt of his tears having turned into some sort of acid, irritating his cheeks more at the minute. Ron was in the seventh heaven. His lips were swollen, his cheeks bursting red, and he smelled funny. Seamus and Neville seemed most interested in Ron's experience, and so he spoke with great detail – giving the impression to Harry as if he was close to feeling Ronald's tongue in his own throat, suffocating him with disgust. He wanted to say something, brawl at them – forcing them to stop. It appalled him, leaving him with agony knowing no one seemed to care about him. Wasn't his suffering visible? He turned to his side, mocking – trying to keep his lips from twitching as he held back more tears, his body bathing in sweat.
Draco laughed a bit nervously and clenched his teeth now.
"Of course they did. And no, no. Come on, it's just through here."
'Harry?' Hermione continued then - more accurate. 'Are you even listening?'
Draco held his breath – his remaining at the same spot. This time he did not answer.
Harry got up, deciding to take place next to the blonde – placing his hand down on his knee. "You're never this silent."
Hermione tugged them two along, planning on going home soon since her belly became to growl for some lunch too. However, a certain curiosity crossed her mind. "Don't mind me asking, Harry. But what's with the strange obsession?"
"No," Ron continued. "I'm a dork, she's a nerd. We don't mash up."
"Don't be afraid, you know a coward like me could never hurt you. The great Harry Potter."
"How did you get in here?"
Harry swore his head was about to explode by all the information dropping in - or it was the wideeye potion being given, again, a bit too much. "Malfoy?" Harry stammered as he grabbed Ron by the arm.
Once releasing his terrible rage by magic, he collapsed to the ground as the last spark of light left the tip of his wand – an unravelling sound of slashing blades echoing through. Unaware of the harm he caused, not having it used before, he parted his lips as his eyes filled with tears. Draco gasped for breath, laying flat on his back – his arms hanging down on a pile of fallen books. Harry refused to watch. He had no idea of the pain Draco was going through, or the blood dripping down his fingertips – leaving dark stains on the yellowed pages of the books underneath him. Draco cried, blood leaving the corners of his mouth as started to choke in his own blood; salty tears burning skin as they trailed down his neck.
"Well fuck you too," Harry snapped at him, getting up from his desk to move to another seat. He wasn't ready to talk to them. Not now.
"One night in one room is all it takes?"
"Yeah." Harry looked at Neville. He could see it whenever he lied.
Though everything warmed his heart, a piece remained cold - for no sign of Draco was given these days. Not an owl, not a present, not a smile before he left. Two days before the school was off was the last time he'd seen the blonde, and that was it. They did not speak ever since. Harry found it difficult to cope with, especially now none of his friends were around. Though drinking liquor with Hagrid was a great way to get his mind off things, having his blonde around would merry the place in an indescribable way. He celebrated Christmas, modest - his books up close, yet untouched - and he got quite a little intoxicated after he sang and danced among the edge of the forbidden forest. He felt sorry for Hagrid. How he lived buried away in his shack, disgraced by many. Harry cried out his love for his taller friend, blessing his retarded features and easy brain - leaving Hagrid astonished on his porch step. Tears were shed, and hugs were given until Hagrid ended up falling asleep - leaning against the door post - and Harry had to manage to keep his feet on the ground. Ignoring the few staff members and students wandering the empty halls of Hogwarts, he stumbled towards the common room - hoping he could snuggle right into bed once he'd arrive.
"Draco?" Harry gulped as his eyes began to burn. The boy behind the mask didn't reply. His hand remained lifted, waiting for the acceptance. "You know I cannot take that," Harry muttered as he stepped back. Peculiar, how everyone danced but no one seemed to notice. "Where were you?"
Harry woke up the next morning, close to the afternoon. His head was pounding, the alcohol taking its toll by giving him a tremendous hangover – no matter how less he'd drank, for all he could remember. Last night had been long and draining. Many things happened, too comprehensive to remember. Rubbing his eyes, he held another close to his chest. A bare individual, pale like porcelain, lay close against his chest; and damn he was lucky he remember that part of their night. A modest smile curled the inner corners of his mouth, and he buried his nose into the blonde's messy hair. Malfoy woke shortly after, nuzzling close against Harry's chest before he groaned with slight agony in his voice.
"This."
"Draco," Harry stuttered – his arms searching for his shoulders. "I-"
Harry laughed out of ridicule, shaking his head as he looked at his hands. "I have no idea what this has to do with what I'm coming for."
Harry showed his teeth, happy for those who'd been granted with love – as for he. His body still fed on Malfoy's lips, and he wanted more.
"I'd say you look poor anytime. Your hair looks like shit."
"Malfoy," he breathed, a drunk smile covering his peachy face. He looked disastrous. "You came!"
'Harry,' Draco gasped after Harry had speed up the head within seconds. 'I'm coming.' Harry didn't seem to listen and just kept rubbing the tip of his tongue along its thin skin. 'Potter,' he squeezed out now, not being able to keep himself from rushing his hand through his companion his hair. 'You're so fucking good- I can't-'
"What was it like?" Luna's protuberant grey eyes stared at him, wide and intimidating.
"Eh," Neville took his plant back in his arms, and shrugged.
"I see no reason why," Harry replied.
'I'm happy to see you too, Malfoy.'
Draco shoved over, his hand touching the cold wooden floor beneath their beds, fetching his glasses in a flick.
"Do I what?" Harry questioned in a light panic. It was hard to keep his sanity now both arousal and intoxication were on.
Hermione huffed under her breath as she looked away - still holding his hand. "I was so caught up with my own infatuation I totally missed yours." She drew her fingers through his hair as she tilted her head to the side. "I'm sorry,"she continued guilty. "I know I shouldn't call it that."
"Where am I?" Harry muttered as he slowly pushed the sheets off his upper body.
'You don't fool me, halfblood.'
Harry shrugged, staring at the tip of his fancy black shoes. He felt ridiculous for coming here. For still caring at all.
"Could you open?" he replied as he dragged his stuff along. Ginny pushed open the door, stepping aside to let him through.
"What happened?" Harry wanted to rub his head but hissed as his shoulder began to sting.
Harry shrugged, his body unable to find either rest or patience. He wanted to leave, look for Draco, and leave the eating for later. His mouth was dry. Even though he knew he was incapable of holding any stomach content, he couldn't withstand a glass of juice. Taking a large sip, he looked at Neville – still ignoring the question for all it was worth. What could he possible say? Yes, in fact I've been with him the entire night. Oh and we made out like two bitching puppies. No, not so much.
"Are you sure you don't want this?"
"Here," a soft voice came from behind – reaching out a blurred hand. Harry squeezed his eyes together, unwilling to take accept the helping hand for he couldn't see who was reaching out. His pair of glasses got put back on the bride of his nose; the vivid white picture becoming clear as day at instant.
Everyone was ready to get to their necessary exams. People were studying, groaning and pouting all over the place, and Harry tried his best to keep his attention stuck on his books – having people pointing at him. He was now famous for being a loner and looking like an anorexic hobo. Funny, how roughly two weeks could make your appearance change so drastically. Hermione hopped by. She was carrying a pile of books, hooked under one arm, and looked down on him worriedly. Harry pretended not to notice her. He wrapped his fingers along the edges of his parchment, and yawned as he read.
"Draco?" Seamus responded – full of disbelieve. "He's been gone for months. You got him expelled. Remember?"
"I know you've been feeling like you've lost us. Gosh, I'm sorry I wasn't there for you..."
Ron and Hermione were gathered out of bed that morning. Armed with sweets and presents they sat at the end of the bed, waiting for Madam Pomfrey to do her magic. After a small consumption of the wideye potion Harry gradually opened his eyes - waking in the exact same room as last night, though he had forgotten.
"Unfinished business," Harry muttered. "Leave it."
Harry smirked and pressed some kisses on his thigh now, chuckling shortly after.
"Potter!" Snape called, a twitch in his voice – he sounded angry. He grabbed Harry by the collar, investigating his face, the blood, enjoying his tears.
"Harry," a voice interrupted the sky. "Is it true?"
"Figured?"
And as quick as that Harry thought he would be safea gain – to his surprise and luck. Unfortunately, in the end it appeared he wasn't going to be left alone like he hoped so. There was one particular person in the shop that remained wandering there, and it was nobody less than Draco Malfoy. He gave the explanation to his father that he wanted to check something. Harry didn't know what to think of that, and it honestly got him quite excited. Spying on Draco was something rather interesting. The whole Slytherin scum was always full of secret. Unfortunately Draco headed straight towards the corner Harry was hiding in, and so he forced his hand to his mouth as the blonde came closer. His breath was pushing against the wooden cabinet door, and he wished he could close the crack in between. If Draco noticed someone was near, and he would investigate the cabinet, Harry would be doomed.
Come alone. No bullshitting me.
Madam Pomfrey sighed as the other nurses let go of the boy. She took the empty vial of wideye potion and gave it to one of the nurses. "We will try it again later. But not tonight."
"Off ye' go," Hagrid muttered as he softly pushed them forward. "He'll be fine ye 'no? Nothin' to worry about-"
"Nah," he muttered – ready to drop his forehead to the table.
Draco curled back his arms, frowning his brows as he took some distance – yet without leaving the bed. "Wow, easy there. What's gotten into you?"
"How convenient," Harry replied – the towel covering his parts for the greater good. "I'd like you to leave now. Goodbye." Trying to find the way out, his toes searched around for the edge of the bathtub. Meeting the ground, fabric wrinkled under his foot – buttons activating his pressure points, and he looked up as soon as he saw another piece of clothing falling down in front of him. "What are you doing?" He pulled his foot back – as if he thought to be safe between the small walls of the tub.
Harry scoffed softly, finally meeting her eyes again, and granted her a modest, grateful smile. "Me neither," he replied. "It was just a couple of punches. After that I scared him off." Liar.
"Potter," Malfoy stated surprised – a smug smile appearing on his flawless feature. Harry wrinkled his nose – his eyes shooting fire – and pushed Draco back in. "Hands off," Draco hissed – his judging eyes popping out. "I swear I wasn't taking a piss on you."
Harry cocked his head, frowning deeply. Was he asked to come for a silly chitchat? Like he could care. His wand hidden in the sleeve of his jumper, he wrinkled its hem between his fingers – nervous, no matter the circumstances.
"You started it," Harry continued - unimpressed. "I'd say it was some guilty fantasy of yours, and during the heat of the moment you just..." A cheeky grin crossed his lips. "...revealed your inner self."
"So what are we going to do?" Harry muttered, his back stiff and his body still moist by the cold sweat running down his spine. "We are possibly going to be expelled."
"Expulso!"
"Bye Myrtle. I'm sorry."
"What do you mean?"
Hermione lifted her brows indignantly, and it appeared that Harry was asking for another hit, again.
"Yeah, what about that?" Harry called as Hermione rose from their table. She didn't listen. After a quick peck on Ronald's cheek she left.
"Shut it," Draco scoffed, rushing his hand through his thick blonde hair. Burying his face in his neck, he trailed down his chest – his hand stroking down his inner thighs; resulting for Harry to keep his eyes tight shut. His cock was throbbing. He was nervous. Draco kissed his abdomen, resting his chin on his stomach for a small moment to look up at him. He sensed his tension.
Harry's mouth dropped, his face now pale. "Sorry?"
As he put them on again, he glanced around while trying to get on his feet. Curiously he thumbed his eyes along all the strange objects near him, and it didn't take long for him to realize he'd end at the exact same spot like he had years ago. Borgin and Burkes. Harry swiftly moved forward to get out of the store as quickly as possible, knowing he supposed to meet Hermione and Ron in Diagon Alley instead of Knockturn Alley, yet something blocked his way right before he got the change to pop up from behind a storage cabinet. Mr Borgin came out of the room that was attached to the store – probably linking to a space he stayed whenever he had no costumers coming around. He snorted dissatisfied, patting his dirty hands against his trousers, and he glanced through the shop suspiciously since he'd apparently hear Harry shoving over the ground when he got spit out by the flames. This caused Harry to gasp and quickly turn his heels to find a hiding spot elsewhere. Finding – what he thought to be – the same closet he'd seen years ago, he quickly moved towards it and hid himself between the poking brooms to keep Mr. Borgin from finding him. He didn't want the people here to know he was here. No one had to know about his little accident, and he didn't feel like talking to that filthy man of a Borgin.
"Inexperienced, fruit?"
Harry had nearly forgotten what kind of event they were reaching. The halls were decorated with pumpkins and candlelight, and Nearly Headless Nick was out for a cheer – greeting everyone with such excite he finally managed to be actually scary (He decided to pop up every time you didn't expect, shouting out as if he tried to sell a bunch of cheap flowers on a market). Not always very pleasant – though it did brighten Harry's mood.
Harry turned his head slowly as Hermione pressed her hand onto his twitching knee. "Right?"
"I haven't seen you in a while," he muttered as he scratched the back of his head - messing up his white, neatly cut hair. "You've been avoiding me."
"You are ready to do anything if just for a little bit of attention, or appreciation. Even from me. No matter how fucking queer the requirements." Draco brushed his thumb along his lower lip, almost as if he relived their first encounter – tasting Harry's blood on his tongue. Harry decided to make his way to wherever his safe haven could be, and snorted – trying his best to run away from his own fears.
"Seamus," Harry shouted, approaching his fellow student with a smile. "Seamus- Tell me you've seen Malfoy in the last five minutes."
"... that he's dead."
He continued doing his deed, pressing his pink swollen lips against the tip of the erection again to kiss it like a precious delicatessen.
'Because you're possibly the chosen one, it doesn't mean you're invincible or anything.'
"But you will be." Harry added coldhearted.
Her tender body lingered in his arms, shocking and shaking as her tears shed. Harry couldn't move. The way she pronounced his name struck him as lightning. He was eager to ask her; when, where, how? But his lips were sealed – for no sound managed to come from his throat, afraid to make it all real. Almost pretending as if he didn't hear it, he drew his fingers through her hair. "I do love you," he whispered; forcing himself in some sort of trance, as if he whished to believe his own lies. "Trust me, I do."
"Come on, you weak bastard. You're making a fool of yourself." Harry still pointed his wand at him, knowing they were alone for now. Harry rarely felt the urge to punish someone, or even take a mock. But now, seeing Goyle wobbling against the pavers, it brought him great pleasure. A weird kind of satisfaction that made him feel evil in the most pleasurable way. He'd always hated him. If just by his stupid manners and weak attitude.
"I want to hear it from you," Harry insisted as he took a step closer, yet to pick up his wand.
"What's the matter with her?"
"You'll see. I knew you couldn't let a secret rendez vous go."
Seamus turned his back, shaking his head as he gathered with his mates to talk as they walked away – leaving Harry without a word.
"I need to see speak to you today. Meet me in the train after we arrive a.s.a.p.
"You know the truth."
"You won't get far, pal. You are ruining yourself."
"-Because you are." Draco grabbed his shoulder, his eyes puffy and red. "We are."
The people were leaking out rapidly after they arrived at Hogwarts. Trunks and cages clattered against the obstacles around, and heavy chitchatting allowed the day to bloom with life and joy – now everyone was once again united with their friends. Hogwarts would always be there to welcome people home. Though Hermione's suspiciousness almost cost Harry his head, he managed to shake them off – telling them he'd lost something on his way in. Swiftly moving through the counters, afraid he wouldn't be on time, he wriggled himself through the last passing students making their way out – Harry his eyes strongly fixated on every end of his way. As soon as he arrived at the well-known Slytherin area, he took a deep breath before he entered. His heart pounded against his chest – his head spinning and his palms sweaty, afraid for whatever could come.
"I would've told you if I couldn't handle it. But I can, because I have no feelings for Hermione whatsoever. She's like my fucking sister. We've been friends for so long!"
"A group of Slytherins. They are outside. They obviously didn't tell me..." He batted his eyes defeated; knowing no one ever would, and thumbed the tip of his tongue along his chapped lips. "Malfoy seems very confident about it. I shouldn't go if I were you."
Draco tore his eyes off him. A massive amount of anger resulted for his muscles to tense, and for a split second he was about to grant Harry a massive punch – if just to punish him for his blindness. "Oh come on, you love the attention."
"Of course you were," the blonde replied in a sigh.
It was horrible to see Draco like this. Even though he was crowned as one of his biggest enemies, he never meant for this to happen. Though the reason of the beating was still vivid, Harry wasn't even sure whether he really wanted to know it or not. Did his father find out about their business? About his homosexual activities with the one person he wasn't supposed to spend time with? Though Harry was "praised" as the chosen one, the slumbering burden, he wasn't the only one. Draco was forced by the Dark Lord to complete several tasks, being threatened by the death of his family in case he wouldn't proceed. Draco barely meant to become a spoiled brat, but was simply created to – being a part of a pure-blood family tearing his youth apart. The boy without choices. However, Harry didn't know about this. To Harry he was just a boy, praised and tugged to a certain kind of perfection Harry couldn't put his finger on. Yes, he was attracted to him. Or at least it seemed like it, according to the last several months of spending hours a day thinking about him. Though Draco's leaving was one of his darkest desires about a year ago, he now found it one of his deepest fears – knowing he could be gone and treated like shit once he'd vanished from Hogwarts. Harry didn't like the idea of it. He spend most of his youth in his uncle's house, in a cupboard under the stairs, living with the most foulest people of all, and he couldn't forgive himself wishing it to someone else. Not to Draco, at least – wherever he would end after this.
Harry tried to open his eyes. Though this took great effort, and the lights seemed to burn his pupils,
"No, you don't. Not like I love you." She dropped her shoulders, biting her lower lip as she gasped for air. Her body shivered under his touch as he pulled her close into his arms – kissing her temple as he felt it easing her muscles. The two of them kissed, once or twice, and ever since chemistry seemed to have been growing between them. However, ever since the complications with Malfoy grew, their chemistry flew.
Snape bit his tongue – leaning onto his desk as he firmly closed his eyes; most likely wishing he could slap the boy across the jaw with a book or two (if not an entire series dictionaries).
"Who?"
Harry dropped his head, scoffing to himself as he rubbed his hands together – ready to claim his remark on Draco's silence. But then he kissed him, and Harry allowed. Draco dove on top, nailing Harry down to the bed with a slow and steady pace. He loved every single moment of it. Harry longed to ask for more. No matter Draco seemed nearly started with his actions; Harry couldn't wait to ask for more. And so he did. His hands guided down his hips – grabbing the hems of his cardigan so he managed to pull it upwards, removing it from the blonde's body. Draco hesitated. For a second he seemed to be forgotten of what he was doing, yet recharged straight after – helping him all the same by unbuttoning his blouse from the top; giving Harry the opportunity to get rid of his own. Their bodies met. The buttons of their trousers tangled up as Harry pulled him up close – and their lips burst together into a passionate, longing kiss; a rush of adrenaline and arousal fulfilling their bodies, for there was no more trouble to be afraid of.
Draco didn't reply. His sunken eyes stared down at his feet, and he quickly rolled down his sleeves – turning away from the both of them.
Draco stopped abruptly, his cheeks red and his smirk nearly glowing, "-Going to come?"
Harry held his breath while cold sweat drenched his body.
Nevertheless, he continued sucking shortly after. Harry clenched his teeth, realizing how his climax came closer and closer, and in time he almost reached it he managed to squeeze out the last warning.
Draco looked up at him loosening his tie. "Never," he simply replied – wrinkling his nose as he did. "I'm simply trying to understand the flair about you."
