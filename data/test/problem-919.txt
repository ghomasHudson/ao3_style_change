“Can I see Ginny? In my head I haven’t seen her in nine months, and I need to see her.” Harry asked as he sat up and winced in pain a little bit.
“That Mr. Weasley is what is left of the protective wards I had placed over Mr. Potter. Which leads us to the information we were dreading. The Dark Lord in using Mr. Potter as a vessel for damage. You three know Mr. Potter best, where would he go?”
The Malfoy family’s trial came to an end yesterday and the results surprised almost everyone. Narcissa and Draco Malfoy were released without a hitch, but Lucius was sentenced to a year in Azkaban. It seems that the Malfoy family has an angel looking out for them, and they seem to be working in over drive to get them off.
“Yes, they are different. With muggles they let you live on your own, and you are practically an adult. With wizards you are in between an adult and a child, and this means that you will be shadowing us, Narcissa and I, to take over the Malfoy fortune. Draco, I will be starting to show you how to run the finances, and when I think you are ready you will take over completely.”
“No, your mother did not, Draco. She did not give us permission to have sex on her dining room table. Do you know how bad that will be? Anyone could walk in at any moment.” Harkin whispered.
“Well, first of all, I said he might be alright, it depends on the case, and the damage already done. Second, Madam Pomfrey and I had to improvise a majority of the spells because they conflicted with the ones cast at St. Mungos. So I have no idea what is going to happen. After he wakes if he wakes; this is all very temperamental magic, Granger.” Draco explained, and Hermione slouched into the chair that Draco had just vacated.
“Yes.” Draco stated as he started pulled Harkin instead of the other way around. “I think Severus might still be here.” Draco stated as he pulled her towards Lucius’ study.
“Thanks, Tally, and don’t tell anyone about this even if they ask you, even me.” Draco whispered back, not trusting his voice, and he took the cloak from the small elf and she disappeared with a small nod. Draco put the cloak in his trunk and placed wards around it so only he can open it. Draco checked the time with a quick tempus charm and saw he missed dinner. He changed into his pajamas and crawled into bed and he fell back asleep.
Hey, sorry about the wait, but next chapter is here, and i hope that i will be finishing this one up soon and finish posting everything. I think i might have possibly broken the writers block that i had, plus life happened, and stress rather doesn't help writing really. but enough of my babbling enjoy the next chapter i hope you like it.
“Thank you.” Harkin stated. “Though I am tired and would like to get some sleep.” Harkin finished with a whisper as she turned and walked towards the door to the bedroom, and she closed the door and started towards the bathroom. Harkin slipped out of her school robes and turned on the bathtub. She turned on the bubbles as Draco walked into the bathroom.
Harry and Draco started gathering their clothes and pulling them on. When they were finally dressed, Draco pulled his school trunk out of his closet and started packing his clothes. Harry went into the other room and brought his trunk out and Hedwig. Narcissa then waved her wand and Harry’s trunk and Draco’s trunks disappeared, and then Narcissa took Draco’s and Harry’s hands and they also disappeared. When the reappeared, they were standing in the doorway of a house that Harry has never seen before.
“This morning Mione and I went into Harry’s room to get something in there that we thought we left, and found everything in Harry’s room packed up and gone. Well, last night I was barrowing one of Harry’s cloaks, and a house elf came and snuck it right out of my bag right in front of Mione and I. the elf then disappeared so we couldn’t question it or get the cloak back. So I figured it was Malfoy he was the only one who would have reason.”
“Why do you care? I am my own person and will do whatever I want when I want to without your permission, because I don’t need it anyway.” Draco said and his voice was raising slightly, and Harry noticed this for his ear was right next to Draco’s lips. Harry placed his hand on Draco’s leg that was right next to Harry’s elbow, and he could feel as Draco relaxed. “I’m sorry, it’s just irritating when people only seem to care about me when I’m doing something I’m not supposed to.” Harry not wanting to say anything just wrote I don’t across Draco’s skin, and he felt his lips curl into a smile next to his ear.
The next morning Harkin woke up to find Draco curled around her, and she snuggled deeper into him trying to get deeper into his smell and warmth. Draco chuckled as he buried his face into the top of her head and inhaled her smell as well. They laid like that for a while until Draco cast a Tempus charm to see what time it was, and they panicked for it was almost 8 o’clock, and breakfast was mostly over, and they should be getting ready for classes. Draco and Harkin jumped out of the bed and quickly headed to the bathroom to wash up before pulling on their school uniforms to head to their first class of the day.
“Yes, unfortunately, Professor Snape noticed the strain, and advised me to drop the charm for the sake of Harkin’s and the twin’s health.” Draco explained.
“Yes, but it wasn’t his fault. His father was an abusive arse, and I’m 100 percent sure that Thaddeus beat him. Theo did it to save his life.” Harkin defended. “And given my past I would be a hypocrite not to forgive him.” Harkin finished.
“Cissy, I’m wonderful. I heard that Harry was at St. Mungos by Arthur Weasley, and he only knew because he came for a check-up.”
Harry’s hands worked their way down Draco’s sides and to his waist. His hands then moved around and started working on Draco’s pants. They were unbuttoned, unzipped and off his hips in an instant. Draco magically pulled his curtains around his bed as he worked on getting Harry’s pants off, and when the two were finally naked, they both groaned as their rock hard erections rubbed together. Draco, being on top of Harry, started kissing his way down Harry’s jaw, neck, chest and abdomen until he reached Harry’s groin.
Harry curled into Draco on the couch, and Draco wrapped his arms around him pulling him closer and eventually into his lap. Harry ended up straddling Draco’s lap and Harry leaned his forehead against Draco’s. Draco chuckled as he closed the rest of the distance between them.
“I may be able to help with that.” Luna said as she walked into the room and up to the settee. “Is Harry going to be alright?”
When she woke up next, she felt fingers brushing a strand of hair across her forehead, and her eyes fluttered open. Her eyes landed on the pale hand brushing against her skin, and she whispered, “Dray…” She leaned into the caress as he tucked some hair behind her ear.
“Dray…” Harry moaned, and Draco’s lips found Harry’s. His lips moved from her jaw and neck, and she moaned as Draco nipped at her skin. “Mmm… Dray…. More, Dray…” Harry panted, and Draco’s rhythm sped up and nipped harder at Harry’s skin. “Yes, like that…”
“I know. I’m not and you weren’t, but Siri and James and apparently Draco.” Remus stated as he bowed his head. “I know Draco can’t find you here, but you should let him know that you are alright, cub.” Remus whispered.
“What are you talking about Remus?” Granger said, but Lupin wasn’t looking at her. He was staring at Draco, and Draco could only imagine what he saw in his eyes.
“Harry,” Hermione was the first to pull out of her stupor and hurried to his side. Harry stopped laughing and gripped Draco tighter.
“Well, there are a few ways. One we find and destroy the last Horcrux, but as for we do not know what it is, there is a second option. We put Harry under a stasis until we can destroy the horcrux.”
“I’m almost there. Promise.” Narcissa said as she turned towards he son. “A few weeks into school I got sick, or I thought I was, so I went to the hospital with to figure out what was wrong. Turns out your father missed one of the protection spells while we were in France, and I ended up pregnant.”
“No, he just needs some sleep and he should be good in the morning, Granger.” Malfoy chuckled as he carried Harry up the stairs. “Now, you know where the eighth year dorm is, right?”
“Potter! Who is it and why are you leaving my door open for so long? Let them in and get your lousy ads in here so you can make our supper. Dudley is going to be home soon and he’s going to want his supper when he gets home,” Vernon shouted, and Harry’s eyes went to the floor as he flinched because his best friend is watching him be treated like one of his house elves. Harry was ashamed of how Draco was seeing him be treated this way, when he seemed so confident and in power. Harry was ashamed that his best friend had to see him being be little by his uncle.
“Draco, how much did you spend on this ring for Harry?” Lucius drawled as he dug his fingers into his temples.
“I told you not to do something, and you did it anyway. Please, Draco, tell me that this won’t be happening often, because I really don’t want to have to find some other place for us to stay, because you and Harry couldn’t keep it in your pants. My sister may be alright with you being with Harry, but that doesn’t mean that I want her knowing that you two are have sex every night. Nymphadora informed me that she walked in on the two of you earlier.”
“I really don’t start the fight, I’m usually the one yelling. Once I get whatever it is out of my system I’m usually better. It’s usually better for everyone if they just let me vent, because once I get it out of my system I’ll most likely apologize because I realized whatever it was, was in fact my fault. But not always, just remember that.”
Rodolphus zapped him over and over with the Cruciatus curse, and Harry held his screams back, and finally, he got sick of not having any results, so he walked over to this table in the back of the room that Harry didn’t notice until then. Rodolphus picked up this short knife that was slightly curved at the end. “You know where I got this knife from, Harry.”
The next morning, Harkin woke up to Draco shifting in his sleep causing the textbook to fall to the ground, and Harkin looked up at Draco to see him tossing and turning in his sleep. She sat up suddenly at the realization that he was having a nightmare, and she started trying to shake him awake. “Dray. Draco, wake up, my dragon. It is just a dream, whatever is happening is just a dream. Draco!” Harkin shouted the last word, and she didn’t get any sort of realization out of Draco at all, he just kept tossing and turning. Harkin climbed out of bed, and nearly fell on her face as she lost her balance. She quickly grabbed a nightgown before hurrying back over to Draco. When she reached him, he was screaming, “No, Father, don’t not her, not them. Hurt me.” Harkin stood there shocked by what his nightmare was about, but she quickly snapped out of her stupor, and she took Draco’s hand in hers and placed it on her small baby bump. She tried to focus her energy and the babies’ energy towards Draco, to make his subconscious notice them, that they were alright, and soon he jolted upright in bed, nearly taking Harkin out in the process. She ended up on her butt just trying to avoid the swing of his arms with a small groan, which caught Draco’s attention.
“Help me out of this dress, Mipsy.” Harry asked, and Mipsy hurried over and started helping Harry out of the dress. She undid Harry’s corset, and she pulled the black corset off the top of the stack and started doing it up for Harry. When she finished, Harry pulled the black shirt off the stack before she unfolded the trousers and found a pair of leather skinny jeans. Harry started pulling them on, and Mipsy started helping. After a little while Harry had the pants on, and she laced up the combat boots that came with the outfit. Mipsy then took her back to the dining room where Lucius was waiting.
“How is she doing? Mother and I have been meaning to go over and talk to her to reconcile, but just haven’t had the time.”
“I am officially Harkin Jamelynn Potter.” Harkin stated as she moved away from the hug to look up at the men. “But you can still call me Harry, since Harry can be short for Harkin.” Harkin explained.
“Wedlock? What are we in the early 1900s? No, we’re almost into the 21st century, you don’t have to worry as much about having a baby out of wedlock.” Hermione stated.
Draco smirked as he kissed the side of her jaw and kissed his way up to her mouth, and she rolled her hips to let him know she was ready. Draco slowly started rolling his hips in a rhythmic way, and Harry started moving her hips in sync with Draco. Harry moaned as Draco hit just the right spot, and Draco’s arms wrapped around Harry’s waist as she shifted her weight on Draco’s lap, creating a different angle for Draco who moaned as she started sucking on the side of his neck. Harry gasped as Draco shifted and he came inside her, and she melted into his for support. Draco wrapped his arms around her and held her to his chest.
“I would, but you have to make it sound more convincing. With all this laughing I’m not sure if I want to.” Draco said as he started tickling her, and she started trying to squirm out of his reach.
“I’m not saying I’m not scared. I just am not going to hide in the shadows because someone is after me. Someone is always after me, I’ve gotten used to that in my five years in the wizarding world.”
“And before?” Draco wasn’t sure if he wanted to hear the answer, but he knew that he had to know. Harry looked him in the eyes, and he gave Draco a little smirk.
Everyone was sitting in the Great Hall after Harry walked out, when a silver doe appeared in the entrance to the great hall, and then Harry’s voice was coming out of the doe. “Ron, Hermione, Draco help, plea-” but the rest of the statement was cut off by a high pitched blood curdling scream. Ron, Hermione, and Draco were on their feet instantly running from the hall, while everyone else was covering their ears as the scream continued to echo throughout the hall. Finally, Dumbledore got his wand raised to remove the noise from the hall.
“As was I, darling, but I digress. I came up here to see if you were up to a little lesson on diner manners and utensils?” Narcissa questioned.
“It’s alright, Draco, darling. I still have my son, I still love you. Why don’t you go back up by Harry, dear? It’ll make you feel better.” Narcissa said as she turned and walked him out of the room. “I’ll deal with Mr. Potter’s friends.” Narcissa said as she released her son and walked back into the dining room. “Why are you making my son relive one of his worst memories? We have done nothing but take care of Mr. Potter. He is safe here and if you wish to stay to see him or ever come back to see him again off you do leave, you will not question my son about actions that he had no control over.” Draco heard his mother say until he was out of ear shout and could no longer hear. He continued to his room where he found Harry staring at him when he opened the door.
“Does it feel as if its’ warming up in here or is it just me?” Draco asked as he started loosening his tie, and he looked over to Harry to see she looked a little flushed. He then looked up at his mother, and she looked a little flushed as well. Draco was starting to wonder if the heat in the Manor was turned up. Draco was about to ask his mother about it, when Severus and Lucius walked back in the room.
“Thank you, Professor.” Malfoy said as he bowed slightly, and he turned towards Harry and took her hand, pulling her from the room. They followed Umbridge from the room, and they went in opposite directions. Malloy pulled Harry up the stairs, and Harry tried to ask questions, but Malloy wouldn’t answer any of her questions.
“She is the one that caused this. My dad wouldn’t be lying in that bed because of a snake attack if she hadn’t gone to the Ministry that day. If she hadn’t gone with that stupid snake.” Ron said.
“Yes, Mr. Potter is strong and seizes to surprise us, but I am still unsure whether he can come through this, even with Draco’s help.”
“Mione had a time turner third year. It’s how she got to all of her classes, and how we broke you out of the tower while saving Buckbeak.” Harkin stated then froze. “Oops.”
The Dark Lord was in front of them in seconds, and he started yelling at Lucius. Harry was in and out of consciousness, but she caught the jest of the conversation. The Dark Lord blamed Lucius. “Stop, it wasn’t his fault I did something stupid, and got in the way of Nagini attacking Arthur. It is my fault, there is nothing Lucius could have done to stop me. I’m at fault, not him.” Harry shouted before she felt the rest of her energy drain from her, she had just enough energy to pull the prophecy out of her pocket and let her arm fall. Lucius just barely caught her arm and the prophecy before it almost hit the ground. Harry felt the darkness take her eyes fluttered closed.
“I won’t complain. Promise, I’m only assuming that girls will be bunking separately from the boys,” Harry joked.
“Sleep, my love. You’ll feel better when you wake.” Draco whispered, but Harkin didn’t even have to be told because she was already falling asleep, and she felt her eyelids dripped closed and was asleep.
“Okay, I’ll be downstairs making breakfast.” Harry walked downstairs and past his trunk at the bottom of the stair where Andromeda levitated it downstairs the night before. He walked to the kitchen where he placed Teddy in his height chair, and pulled ingredients from the cabinet, and he started making food. By the time that he was done Andromeda was sitting in one of the chairs at the table.
“Anyway. I will be back daily to do a quick check up until you head back to school then it will be weekly. Understood?” Melody said.
“How did you calm him down after a nightmare? I’ve been with him day and night for the past six months, and I’ve never been able to calm him down after some of those especially get him back to sleep.” Granger stated. “What did you do to him?”
“Did Mr. Malfoy really put Harry in the position to be kidnapped by your insane sister?” Hermione asked.
Malfoy relaxed against the desk as Harry had, and Harry stood up and started pulling her clothes back on. She just finished pulling the last article of her clothing on when she felt someone wrap their arms around her waist and shoulders. She tensed, and she could feel the person behind her do the same and then start backing off.
Draco walked into the common room that the eighth years shared on the fourth floor, and he found Granger sitting in a chair next to the fire place. “Granger?” Draco said as he walked up to her, and she looked up at him.
“Draco, Harry. Dinner is on the table if you would join us, please,” Narcissa said through the door. Draco pulled away from Harry and looked to the door, and Draco undid the silencing charm and responded to his mother.
“No, that is not a problem, Cissy. I was just making sure it wasn’t a problem for you. I’m glad to hear that you are alright with your only son and heir being gay. You have come a long ways, Cissy since we were young and naïve.” Andromeda smiled at Narcissa and then at Draco and Harry. Draco sat back down on the couch next to Harry and pulled him closer. “Do you still want three rooms or do you want two rooms?” she joked. Harry looked over at Draco and then at Narcissa, and then Harry looked down to the floor. Harry knew there was no way that Narcissa was going to actually allow him and Draco to share a room officially.
“Potter, if you’re going to make that much noise what was the point in hiding in the nook.” Harry rolled her eyes at the voice. How had Malfoy even known that she was out and about?
“Draco, shhh. Okay, its fine, I understand. That’s the same reason why I didn’t tell you.” Harry looked into Draco’s eyes and smiled. What Harry said ran through Draco’s head, and it clicked.
“No, not in the normal sense of the word at least. I was rarely beaten, the only time that happened was when Dudley couldn’t find some other poor kid to use as his punching bag, and that was rare once we reached nine. The rest of my abuse consisted of me living in my cupboard for as long as I can remember. It was my bedroom and punishment up until I was eleven and my Hogwarts letter came with my cupboard on there as my address. My aunt and uncle kind of freaked and moved me into Dudley’s second bedroom where they kept all his broken or unwanted things. I was starved and locked in my room when I did something wrong or use magic when I didn’t even know I was using magic. I didn’t even know that I was a wizard until Hagrid broken down the door to this little shack that my uncle thought he could out run the letters from. They didn’t want me to go to Hogwarts and learn magic. They thought that they could beat the magic out of me. Merlin, why am I just spilling all of this personal information out to you? Even Ron and Hermione don’t know some of this stuff. They know some of it because of the way that I act sometimes, but they only guess about my past.”
“She was furious and all she saw was the blood. She dueled Ronald, and she won. The imbecile then fired a spell at her back as she walked away from doing more harm to him like she wanted.” Severus stated, and he saw the fury in Draco’s eyes.
“I never said I blamed Theo, love. I’ve known about how his treated him, and Theo is a great person, and would be a great older brother.”
“Longer than I care to admit, Potter, but long before I got this mark on my arm. There’s a reason I do what I do, Harry. That’s why I couldn’t tell her, Aunt Bella. You asked me once why I didn’t tell her. This is why.” Draco said as he placed his hand on the side of Harry’s face massaging his thumb against Harry’s cheek. Harry turned into the embrace, and his hands slide out of Draco’s hair and down his shoulders to the collar of Draco’s dress shirt. Harry pulled the Slytherin tie off and started unbuttoning the shirt.
“Yeah, this alcove is sound proof I once spent an entirety of my Father’s meetings in here laughing and no one noticed.” Draco said as he kissed her again and lifted her up onto one of the small shelves in the space and slid back inside her. Harry moaned and entangled her fingers in Draco’s hair as he trusted into her. Draco heard every moan she made right next to his ear, and he could feel as he was about to go over the edge, and moaned her name as he came. She screamed his name as she came, and she collapsed against him.
“Thank you, Draco. That would be excellent. I would love to go on holiday. Thank you.” Harry’s face lite up as he pulled away from Draco, and that’s when Draco realized why he wanted to be friends with Harry in the first place. Draco loved Harry, and loved watching his face light up when he got excited about something that he’s never had. Draco remembered the first time that Harry stayed at his house over the summer.
“No, Professor, not at all. I was talking to Harry about the potion that caused his appearance. I just wanted to let her know that I’m on her side if she needs my help. Do you need anything else, Professor?”
“No, Harry. That’s not what I meant. Are you alright with this?” Draco asked as he pointed at the bit mark. Harry laughed as soon as he realized what Draco meant.
“Harry has dreams sometimes about events that she later finds out actually happened. Last year she knew that he was coming back, that he was planning something, but she would only get fragments, so she didn’t know everything.”
“Well, I guess we should start with your treatment at the Dursley’s, shouldn’t we?” Draco asked Harkin, and she nodded. “Petunia apparently didn’t get along with her sister very well, because she definitely didn’t like Harry at all. Harry’s bedroom was a little cupboard under the stairs from the moment he came to live there to the time that Hagrid came on his eleventh birthday with his Hogwarts letter. Where she was moved into her cousin’s
“Yes, of course. Dobby would be honored to make Miss Harry Potter's food for her and her babies. Dobby won’t let anything happen to Miss Harry Potter or her food.”
“No, he can think about what he’s done. What he said, it deserves a little brooding. I’m done with being played for a damn tool, Remi. I’m not an object that everyone around me can use for their own personal gain, and sometimes that is all people want me around for.” Harkin whispered. “I know that Draco doesn’t think of me as a tool to use, but his father and mother. I can’t figure out one way or another if they want me there because of who I was, or because I’m Draco’s fiancé, or because they actually want me there.” Harkin finished.
“Yes, but it can wait until after breakfast, dragon. If you don’t mind me dragging you away from Draco for a little while, Harry, dear?”
“Draco, is that a Gryffindor tie?” Lucius asked, and Draco groaned as Harkin laughed out loud causing everyone’s heads to turn towards her. “What is so funny?” Lucius asked.
“Mione, you’re overwhelming them. Either slow down or stop talking.” Ron said as he wrapped his arms around her waist.
“Unfortunately, yes. And I have no idea what is rolling through his subconscious and if he can fight it off on his own.”
“Not if you put her back in her room with Teddy, and I write her a note saying I went out for supplies. She would never know the difference,” Harry tried.
“Mr. Malfoy, I don’t see why a woman would do this to that girl out there, what would be the point.”
Harry started unbuttoning Draco’s shirt, but Draco had the same idea because he pulled Harry’s shirt off over his head and then he just pulled his own over his head. They went back to kissing as soon as their shirts were off, and Harry reached up and intertwined his fingers through Draco’s hair, pulling him closer to him. Draco opened his mouth as Harry slipped his tongue into his mouth, and Draco groaned as Harry’s tongue was exploring his mouth. Harry pulled away suddenly and looked Draco in the eyes as a small whimper escaped Draco’s lips.
“First he forced his son to kidnap her, we can’t blame him he’s probably beaten at home. He’ll be staying at Malfoy Manor until he is old enough to live on his own. After he had her off school grounds he apparated to his home and tied Harry to a bed in their dungeon, where they took her wand. Lucius has it now thankfully. Later he beat her and brutally raped her. He then left her bruised, beaten, bloody, and naked tied to the bed. He had a house elf clean her and partially heal her, so he could come back later and take her to the Dark Lord, but Harry kicked him in the face and broke his nose. Then he brutally raped her again after breaking her arm. When he was done, he made her presentable, and took her to the Dark Lord where he dressed her up for his own entertainment.”
“He’ll forgive me.” Snape said as he picked up Harry. “Who is coming back to Hogwarts with me?” Snape asked as he turned towards Hermione, Ron, and Luna.
“Not yet you aren’t. But with time.” He pulled her along the dance floor, and she felt like she couldn’t move away from him, and she knew she was under some type of spell.
“Well, this would be so much easier if Severus was here to explain, but I will try. Severus created a potion to remove a horcrux from a living thing. You know what a horcrux is, right?”
Harry walked over to his owlery to give the letter to his new owl, Herald that Hagrid gave him after the war was over, and he tied it to his leg to send him off to Minerva. Harry then walked back into his room to find Teddy standing in his crib. “Dada.” Teddy mumbled.
“I’m wonderful. I have been getting to know the wonderful person that will soon be my daughter-in-law. She is very fascinating, and reminds me a lot of her mother at that age. I sometimes can’t believe that girl is related to James Potter, and then she proves me wrong. She’s a wonderful balance of the pair, though.” Narcissa stated.
The two boys have been on the team for five years and they are starting their sixth year at Hogwarts and have been inseparable for that entire time even when he was wrongly entered into the Triwizard Tournament in their fourth year, where Draco was upset at first, but eventually became alright with it. In their fifth year, somethings changed, and Harry got very distant for a while. Draco eventually got Harry to open up to him. They slowly got closer and closer to each other, and over the summer after their fifth year, Harry was only at the Dursley’s house for two weeks, before Draco showed up on his front door step with his mother.
“Dray…Dray...” Harkin tried to get Draco’s attention, and he finally looked at her. “This is not your fault, Draco. You are not your father, and you most definitely can’t control him. I don’t blame you, and nor should you blame yourself. Lucius is an arse, who can’t see through his past, and that has blinded him from the future; the path that you have decided to take. I love you, Draco Malfoy, and I do not plan on going anywhere.” Harkin stated, and he leaned in and kissed her on the lips.
Sadly things sometimes have to get worse before they get better, and i mean it is Lucius what were you expecting.
“I’ve been better. Where am I?” Harry asked as he looked around the room and his eyes landed on Draco. “Malfoy?” Draco could see as the confusion spread across his face, and Draco knew that Harry didn’t remember the last few days.
“Possibly. You are dismissed.” Draco waved his arm and the healer looked at Draco like he just killed his best friend in front of him without a second thought. “Leave, you’ve done enough.” Draco ordered again. And Draco walked over to Harry and he started writing. He wrote in one column the list of spells that he had to perform as the counter to the dark magic. In the second column he wrote the list of spells that the healers and nurses at St. Mungos performed to help Harry.
“I couldn’t, Cissy. You have already done plenty in regards to Harry.” Sirius stated, and he started to back away from them.
“Draco, I know you are a teenage boy, and sex is going to happen and I won’t say anything against that, but I wouldn’t be a mother if I wasn’t worried and concerned. Please tell me you are using protection spells.”
“Yes, that is true, but it does make you any less beautiful.” Draco said before kissing her lips. “You just need your hair and make-up done.” Draco stated and Mipsy appeared in the room.
“It’s just Draco. Sometimes he can be the most romantic and kind and loving, and then he can be the arse that he was like at Hogwarts before everything. I’m extremely sensitive right now, in a lot of ways, and he takes advantage of that, and then when we end up having sex in places that we should probably not be having sex in and his parents find out and he blames me for not trying to stop him. I just can’t believe that he can blame me when I’m the pregnant one, and can’t control my mood swings right now let alone when he touches me like that.” Harkin started and then her eyes widened when she realized what she said, and she looked over at Remus. “I’m sorry if this is awkward for you to listen to.” Harkin whispered.
“Harry has been brutally abused at the hands of his relatives and supposed guardians.” Severus bluntly stated, and McGonagall, Draco, and Ron gasped at the statement. Severus turned to Hermione. “Miss Granger you don’t seem surprised.”
“I have no idea what you just said, Harry, but say it again.” Harry looked confused by this comment, but then realized that he must have spoken in Parseltongue.
“I’ve been better, but I have been worse, so I guess not bad.” Harkin attempted to smile, but wasn’t sure if she pulled it off.
“Excellent, I wouldn’t want him distracting Harry from her task. Let us in, please.” The gates opened and they stepped through.
She was just about to turn down the hallway to go to potions when she felt a hand in hers and someone pull her in the opposite direction. She ended up pinned against the wall in the small alcove outside Snape’s storeroom. She was about to pull her wand out when her hands were pinned to her side and then dragged across the cold stone above her head. She felt the scraps across her skin, and she was about to scream when a mouth was attached to hers.
“Yes, Draco, they can come in. Just no one can see you inside this compartment. There are some massive wards around this compartment.” Narcissa stated, and she left the compartment.
Sorry, it took so long to post. I've been having a bit of some personal problems on top of moving and just life in general. so in light of not posting in forever i will post a couple of chapters for you today.
“Harry, you have to come back with us this year. Minerva said that it would be worth it to go back. Ron and I are going with or without you, Harry,” Hermione stated as she sat cross legged on the floor in the library of Grimmauld Place.
“Did they find it?” Harry asked as he looked at Draco and took his hand and started trying to get out of bed.
“The horcrux inside him, Mr. Weasley. Harry was one of the Dark Lord’s Horcruxes. He was unintentionally a Horcruxes. The night his parents died. A piece of the Dark Lords soul latched onto the only living thing in the room as Albus put it before he died.” Snape directed at Ron before he turned back to Harry. “How did you get rid of it Mr. Potter?”
Severus watched the couple interact with each other for the remainder of class, and he could tell that both of them were pushing their limits, but they were rather good at hiding that they were pushing themselves to hard. Severus assumed that it had something to do with Harkin’s baby bump that was nonexistent right now and during most of their time outside of the hospital wing and their private chambers.
Harry woke up lying on a bed in a dark cold room, and she was shivering. She couldn’t think straight and her head was spinning; she just hoped that whoever had her wasn’t going to do something painful. She tried to sit up, but her wrist caught on something, and when she looked at her wrist they were bound to the headboard and her ankles were bound to the bed posts at her feet. She started to struggle against the bindings, but the ropes just dug into her skin. She could feel as the ropes ripped at the skin around her wrists and ankles, but she didn’t care; all she wanted was to get free so she could run.
“No, Dray. We are not going to use these new powers for anything until we figure them out. Plus if we are having a baby we need to think about them too now. If we become parents…” Harry trailed off.
“Thanks, Nev.” Ron took Hermione’s hand and led her up to the seventh year boys’ dormitories. “Do you want to take Harry’s bed?” Ron asked.
“I don’t know what I’m going to do yet. I figured that I’d wait to make a decision for when I find out I’m pregnant or not.”
“I only killed him before he asked me to, and I made an unbreakable vow with Draco’s mother to kill Albus if he was unable to finish the act. I gladly made that sacrifice to save my godson. I unfortunately could not stop this from happening.” He said as he gestured to Draco and Harry. “I was too late, but I will do everything in my power to make sure no more harm comes to him. His father may have been useless, but I am not, and am only devoted to keeping him, them, safe. Lucius was devoted to the Dark Lord, and I have not been since he set his mind on killing an innocent boy of a dear friend of mine even if she wouldn’t speak to me anymore they were innocent, and deserved better than being killed by a man like the Dark Lord. I just wish I could have gotten my revenge the way Draco did.”
“Because I was similar to him, I understand where he is coming from, the only difference is I decided to change; to protect you, and to protect myself and my family, which you became a part of, not that that was in the original plan, but I love you, and I know I would do everything I possible could to make sure you are coveted and protected. Especially now.” Draco stated as his hands rested on her small baby bump, which made Harkin giggle.
“How can you be so sure? Your father said that he’ll be out by the end of the school year, and our wedding is over Easter holiday.” Harkin stated.
“Miss Potter, it is good to see you. I see you are adjusting well after your accident. How have you been?”
“That bloody chicken.” Draco stated. “You are the one that set it free.” Draco looked out raged, and Harkin kind of just wanted to laugh.
“Good point. Alright, here we go.” Hermione lifted the sword and plunged it into the cup as a ringing sound rang throughout the room. Harry covered his ears and curled into Draco’s side.
“Draco, Mr. Potter is not in danger from anyone in this room.” Severus said, but Draco turned his head to the side and growled at him, too.
“How do we stop it?” Draco panicked, and Harry started screaming. The sound vibrated throughout the room.”
“Mistress Harkin, yous awake. Master Draco is already up with Mistress Cissa going through the Malfoy accounts. Master Draco wished me to wish you his apologies, and to enjoy you breakfast.” The elf stated.
Draco walked into the back room with Healer Johnson behind him, and he walked right up to harry and took her hand. “I’m right here, love.” Draco whispered.
Meanwhile on the seventh floor, McGonagall and the rest of the staff hurried to the Room of Requirement. When they reached the tapestry of Barnabas the Barmy, they found Neville standing outside it. “Mr. Longbottom, we are here to help. Mr. Potter has taken a turn for the worst, and we must find this Diadem immediately.” McGonagall said as Neville paced three times past the wall, and a door appeared. Neville escorted them into the room, and they weaved through the stacks until they came across Hermione.
“Hey, he got me out of trouble with Umbridge, and he said something’s, and if he can prove he’s not lying I’ll believe him. Why what did you think we were doing? I’m a girl now, it’s not like I’m going to go around throwing punches.” Harry said as she started walking over to the closet striping off her clothes.
“Ronald, if she does want to tell us then she doesn’t have to. Don’t force her, or you might just lose your best friends.” Hermione stated as she wrapped her arm around Harry’s shoulder. “I’m not going to force you to say anything, Hun, but we’re just worried about you, and we’ll be there when you are ready to talk.” Hermione said to Harry. Harry looked up at Hermione and nodded at her, but then turned to Ron and scolded.
“Everyone is being just so helpful and kind to me with this transformation, and it is a little overwhelming with how much has happened and been overcome in the last two months. I’m nearly two months pregnant with twins, not to mention I’m female. I was kidnapped by Voldemort and raped by one of his followers, who wants revenge on me and is trying to kill me. I am bonded and engaged to my former school rival, and now basically living with him because I am pregnant with his kids. Not to mention that I can’t play Quidditch this year which is going to make this year a long drag, because that was how I could just be myself and have fun.”
“You’d be surprised, Potter, who you let in when you think they’re your friends. Polyjuice is a wonderful invention. I want to thank whoever it was who invented it.”
“He was wearing the locket? Why would you foolish children wear a Horcrux? They aren’t just simple light magic, they are the darkest dark magic we have in the Wizarding world and you are wearing it like it’s jewelry.”
“Yes, and imagine how our sex life will be when I am in my third trimester. No sex.” Harkin laughed as she walked back over and kissed Draco on the lips.
“That’s impossible.” Draco whispered, and he stormed out of the room and went straight to Severus. “What was that potion supposed to do?” Draco shouted.
“Yes, we have company downstairs, and they would like to speak to you and Harry.” She said, but the way she said it, Draco didn’t like what was going to happen.
“Raven,” Draco whispered as he pulled her into a tighter hug. “We should get ready for the day.” Draco stated putting off the conversation they should have.
Would he be disgusted by her treatment or would he laugh wing her face? She figured the best option was to stay quiet like she planned. She continued to let him pull her around the dance floor, and soon the night was almost over. She was pulled around the room and introduced to all of the Death Eaters, and at the end she was brought to a table where Snape, Lucius and Narcissa were sitting.
“Oh, cousin Sirius, how are you?” Narcissa asked as she pulled Draco towards the shouting man, who stopped yelling and turned towards Narcissa.
“Alright Kiddo, come here.” Harry said, holding out his arms for the little man. Andromeda handed him over to Harry.
Mipsy packed up the rest of the dresses, and Harry noticed that there was at least a small variety in color, not just Slytherin colors. There were a few blues and reds and purples and thankfully no yellows or oranges. Mipsy finished packing and they headed down to the dining room where Voldemort was waiting with breakfast for them. Harry sat down, and she looked at the food.
Harry woke and didn’t understand why she was so warm, and she felt like she was constricted. She tried to turn and found Draco wrapped around her, and she smiled before snuggling into his chest, but something felt off Draco was burning to the touch warmer than he should be, and Harry started to panic. Harry tried to pull away from Draco but his arms tightened and he moaned against the top of her head. Harry wasn’t sure, but she settled herself back against him and wrapped her arms around him and snuggled closer.
“Ah, the princess has to have her escorts back to her rooms, especially in her fragile stated I assume. Well, don’t let me hold you up.” Ron muttered, and he stepped aside. Harkin could feel Draco’s anger on top of her own, and she gripped his hand tighter, which he just squeezed back.
“To answer the first and last question, you are my prize for out witting Albus, so I will dress you as such. And to answer the second, I gave Narcissa guidelines as to what to buy and she went out and bought something’s for me to give to you.”
She smiled as she slowly opened the box so Remus couldn’t see, and she gasped. It was a very nice silver band with a ruby stone inlayed in the band. Harkin smiled as she closed the box and pulled Sirius back in for a hug. “He’s going to love it.” She whispered in his ear and pulled away. “This one is mine.” Harkin said as she wiggled the fingers of her left hand in front of Sirius, and he smiled as he took her hand to look at the ring.
“Love, I am the only person in the world who won’t, and if I do you are coming with me. Our bond makes it impossible for either of us to leave without the other. You’re stuck with me, Potter.” Draco whispered and then kissed Harry’s temple. “I’ll love you forever, love.”
“I do remember that skill while I taught her in school. I will let you know what I come up with, in the meantime I would like for you to act as if you haven’t had this conversation with me today, and continue with your normal correspondence with your parents and that does include Christmas holidays.”
Eventually everyone started moving again. Ron tried to pick a fight with Draco, but Ginny smacked him on the back of the head and pulled him into a carriage, apologizing to Draco as she went. “It’s not you who should apologize.” Draco stated as he climbed into a different carriage. Finally, everyone was up at the castle, and Harkin was already seated at the Gryffindor table worrying about Draco when Ron walked in before him. Hermione apologized again, and she pulled Harkin closer and rubbed her back. “Stress isn’t good for you, Harry.” Hermione soothed as Ron sat down next to her. Hermione felt as the air started to chill around them, and she looked around the room for Draco. Their eyes met as Draco walked into the Great hall, and he immediately started fast walking to Harkin. Draco could feel her cold slowly seep into the room, but it didn’t affect him like everyone else. He could tell Hermione was barely able to touch Harkin to keep her as calm as she was. Draco finally reached her and placed his hand on her back.
“It is not your fault, Harry. No need to apologize.” Voldemort said as he turned Harry back forwards. “Come along, Lucius. We have much to discuss.” Lucius followed behind.
The next morning, Harkin woke up alone with a tray of breakfast food on the table next to their bed. “Draco?” Harkin asked into the room, with no response, she was about to get up when there was a small pop and a house elf was standing before her.
“Harry, what’s the matter?” Draco said and he was across the room in a few seconds standing next to the bed. Harry took his hand and gently pulled him onto the bed.
“Unfortunately, Miss Granger.” Narcissa said as she looked at the clock on the wall. “Though, that took longer than anticipated. We should go check on Harkin.” She said as she walked out of the room, and Remus and Hermione hurried from the room to follow her to Draco’s room. “How are they, Mel?” Narcissa asked as soon as she entered the room.
“And you aren’t worried about that. The sword could do plenty of damage on its own let alone adding the others on top of it.” Hermione was on her feet staring Draco down at this point.
“Just breath through it sweetheart. Just breathe.” Narcissa whispered to her soothingly as everyone else just stared uncertainly at the two women. Draco finally snapped out of his reprieve, and he reached out and wrapped his arms around Harkin’s waist, resting one of his hands on her still flat stomach. Harkin released a breath that she was holding in and sighed as she leaned back into Draco’s embrace.
“There is no need to thank me. It is my duty as a mother to make sure my son is happy, your father hasn’t mastered this abilities yet.” Narcissa laughed, and Narcissa stood and took out Harry’s wardrobe and dresser and placed them on the floor and unshrunk them. She placed them against the wall, and called one of her house elves.
“Draco, calm down. She doesn’t want you to look at her any different, so she didn’t want us to tell you, or well, anyone, but we had to. Please, just come out in the hall with me for a little air.” Narcissa soothed her son and pulled him from the room. When the door was firmly shut, Severus continued.
“Well, the Dark Lord held a ball this evening in celebration of his new prize, Harry. Granted she looked beautiful in that ball gown like nothing had even happened but we’ll get there. The Dark Lord danced with her all night, and paid all his attention to her. Though some of the Death Eaters didn’t like that. At the end of the night, he tasked Lucius, Narcissa and I to escort her up to her room where we relayed your plan to rescue her. She’s at Riddle Manor, by the way. We fought and she stormed off, well we found her room and she allowed us access, where Narcissa helped her out of her dress and corset in the bathroom. When we heard shouting, Lucius and I rushed in to find very distinct bruises across her legs and abdomen. They were about the size of one’s fingertip. Upon further evaluation, I found scratch marks down her sides and back as well. She wouldn’t tell me anything, so I used
Soon Harry was standing in the room wearing a pair of skinny jeans, a very low cut blouse that her breast were almost hanging out of the top, and a pair of black combat boots. Mipsy disappeared, and a few minutes after Nott walked into the room, and he circled her as if inspecting her. Harry knew the real reason, he was checking her out, especially when he stopped in front of her, and he stared down her shirt. Harry flinched slightly as he brought his finger up, and gently stroked it down Harry’s jaw and neck, and he slowly dipped it into her cleavage. His finger made its way back up and behind her neck were he grabbed a handful and jerked her head to the side, so he could slowly suck on the skin right under her ear.
“No, he was almost completely drained of blood, which thanks to my mother’s wonderful potion stash he was given a blood replenishing potion in staggered doses. Then he was tortured by my father when he was almost better again, losing the blood he just replenished. I wasn’t surprised that he was sleeping a lot. The body can only take so much.” Draco responded.
Teddy was just like Harry, and he now understood what Hermione was saying. Harry came to the same conclusion Teddy was more important than a relationship right now. Harry needed to grieve before he thought about a relationship with Ginny. Harry could feel the little boy’s hands patting his cheeks and Harry lifted his face to look at the little boy. The little boy in his arms patted the tears running down Harry’s cheek and Harry started chuckling. This little boy is the thing that returned him to present day. The torture he endured to save the little boy and his grandmother; the dark magic that infected him slowly draining him of his magic and energy.
Draco walked over to the bench Harkin was asleep on, and he pulled her into his lap. Theo and Hermione sat down across from them, and when Narcissa came back, she had Pansy and Blaise with her.
Nott had her back in his arms and on the bed before she could even react. “That’s it. Punishment time.” Nott had his wand pointed at her, and he shouted, “Crucio.” Harry felt the pain immediately and couldn’t hold back the scream as her back arched, and the pain raked her body. As soon as it was there it was gone, and she fell back into a heap on the bed.
“Sorry.” She replied, and she leaned into him and rested her elbow on the back of his chair and ran her fingers through his hair.
“Yes, it would, but enough about that for now. I think we should get to some gardening, some of these plants do like their attention at a certain time.” Narcissa said as she grabbed her pair of gardening gloves, and Harkin grabbed hers, after she grabbed a pair of gardening coveralls from the cupboard to cover her dress. Narcissa and Harkin spent the rest of the morning in the garden, and when lunch came around, Narcissa and Harkin stood and walked out of the garden exactly like they had when they walked in. They made their way to the dining room and found everyone already at the table.
The next morning when they woke up, they went down to the great hall with the rest of the Gryffindors. When McGonagall saw them she almost practically ran towards them. “Miss Granger, Mr. Weasley. How are you? Welcome back to Hogwarts.”
“You are right.” Harry could hear the pause in his voice like he wanted to say something else, and she lifted her head a little to look him in the eyes, and she scooted upwards so she could kiss him on the lips.
Draco laughed at the small joke that Harkin had said, and they continued to work on the essay that Severus was going to assign them before they left class, but Draco was thinking about what Severus might want to talk to him about after class. He knew that it most definitely wasn’t his career appointment because Severus and him talked about how that was going to be something that they were going to do after the twins were born with himself, McGonagall, Harkin and Draco, since their bond was something unique they thought that it be best to talk about it all at the same time.
Draco thrust on last time, and he came inside Harkin as she tightened around him. Draco panted as he rolled them to their sides, and they curled against each other, when there was a knock at the door. Draco groaned and was about to get up, when Harkin kissed his lips, and she got up and walked up to the door and opened it. Narcissa stood on the other side of the door, and Harkin smiled.
“Malfoy Manor. Malfoy was trying to identify me because you cast a stinging hex on me.” Harry said as he looked at Hermione to see how much damage was done, because from the look on her face he had been in some serious trouble and some serious damage had been done. She trusted Draco Malfoy of all people to help her.
Harry was arched so much that it didn’t look possible that his body could bend like that. Draco thrusted himself into Harry, and continued for a while. Slowly Harry starts to unbend and leans his forehead against Draco’s shoulder, and Draco bent his head down to capture Harry’s lips in his own, pulling Harry’s face off his shoulder and pushing his back against the shower wall. Draco was about to slip his tongue into Harry’s mouth when Harry’s cum splattered their chests, and Draco came soon after. The pair slipped down the wall of the shower and let the water wash away all the evidence of their actions. Draco leaned forward and shut the shower off and leaned back against the wall next to Harry.
Hermione and Ron walked towards the Fat Lady, somewhere they haven’t seen in almost a year, but know the walk to from every part of the castle by heart. They stepped up to the Fat Lady and Hermione took a deep breath before saying, “Savior.”
“Mmm… Dray, we need to shower, and get dressed and head downstairs to your parents. Otherwise your mother would most definitely come up and interrupt us.” Harry whispered as she reached for her shampoo bottle, and she started lathering her hair.
“Yes, that could be an option, too.” Draco said as Harry wrapped his arms around Draco’s waist, and Draco reached down and pulled Harry’s legs back up around his waist. “You know if you would have just put your clothes on after I finished drying you off you’d be warm by now.” Draco whispered into Harry’s ear. Harry buried his face in Draco’s chest and muttered something that Draco couldn’t hear.
“It is too late for explanations, Siri. You broke my heart.” She whispered before walking into the other room.
“Isn’t that sweet. You’ve thawed his frozen heart, Potter.” Someone said, and Harkin looked up to see someone she recognized from their year, but she couldn’t think of a name.
“It was mostly Hermione. I just had gather the ingredients. Nothing too exciting or extravagant.” Harry stated as she pulled her arm out of Malfoy’s grasp. “I rather don’t like manhandling if you could refrain from doing that in the future I’d greatly appreciate it.”
“Bloody hell. I can’t believe it. He actually got Potter to cooperate, has that ever happened?” she said as she walked up to the bed he was lying in.
“Theo, just take me back. Just take me back and I won’t say anything, who was involved nothing. I’ll say I was unconscious the whole time. Please just don’t turn me over to him, please.” Harry begged but that’s when the door opened and another man walked in followed by another. He first man Harry didn’t know, but the second was unmistakable, Lucius Malfoy.
“You are welcome, darling. I do have to get back and help Draco finish going through the rest of the accounts today.” Narcissa said as she stood up and walked out of the room.
“Mr. Weasley, I believe that will get you a detention.” Severus started, but as Ron started to protest, Harkin stepped forwards.
“Then kiss me.” Harry whispered as he closed his eyes, and Draco obliged. He leaned in and kissed Harry’s lips and then he kissed down Harry’s jaw and his neck. His lips stopped at the juncture of Harry’s neck and shoulder, and he could feel Harry’s pulse point there. “Dray, you can…if you…need…to.” Harry whispered with panting breath, and Draco pulled away from him and looked him in the eyes.
Mipsy helped Harry into a corset and then the dress that she was going to wear for the day. It was a knee length, silver dress, and Harry didn’t know how she was going to last wearing just dresses for the rest of her life, or at least her time in his presence.
Her hair was much longer like she was trying to grow it out as long as it could be. She looked skinnier than she used to be, and paler, too. She actually looked rather sickly. Harry wondered if this was because of him or something that happened because of Voldemort or the war.
Narcissa looked at Lucius and gave him a questioning look. “Lucius, why do you want to talk to Draco? Can’t it wait until later, when Harry isn’t present here at the Manor?”
“So, my nephew has taken your virtue. Mmm…and he even knocked you up while he was at it. Lucius, you forgot to teach the boy proper protection charms; though, father like son, right?” Bellatrix said, winking at Lucius like she knew something Harkin did not.
“That sounds great.” Ron said, only not as enthusiastically as Harry would have liked. Harry turned back to the window as Ron dropped out of the conversation, and he turned towards his sister. They broke into a small argument that Harry decided not to pay attention to. The time past quickly as they grew closer to Hogwarts and soon the cabin lights were turning on as it got darker outside. They changed into their school robes, and the train came to a stop at Hogsmeade station.
“Stop talking about me like I am not here, please.” Draco hissed through retches, and Melody ran her fingers through Draco’s hair in a soothing manner.
Draco was out of his chair and on the bed cradling Harry as soon as he curled in on himself. “What’s happening?”
“What spells were used on Harry during his stay? Things that involve his treatment at St. Mungos, because if they cast one wrong spell, I might not be able to help him, and the entire wizarding world will lose a great person and asset to our survival after the Dark Lord’s demise. This is for Harry, and the rest of the wizarding world, Madam Pomfrey. I can’t risk it.”
“You aren’t allowed to do magic, Harry. He said that it’ll drain you, and make you tired, but there was a couple of good things that came out of this.”
Rodolphus then flicked his wand in Andromeda’s direction and then Harry was out. When Harry woke, he was chained to the ceiling, and he was dangling not being able to touch the floor, which was popping his shoulders out of place. Harry groaned slightly as the spell wore off, and he could feel the pain.
“I don’t know, love, but I just know that he will be there for our wedding. He wouldn’t miss it for the world, you know that. He’ll want to walk you down the alley.” Draco said as he brushed his fingers across her cheek. Harkin leaned into the touch, and Draco smiled. “Mother would probably want you downstairs to help with the preparations for the ball tomorrow night.”
“I’m sorry, Love. I didn’t want to do it, but she just wouldn’t leave if I flat out tell her that I’m with someone. I want to say that I won’t do it again, but first of all we both know that it will, and second now she will be bound and determined to figure out who I’m with.” Draco explained. “I’m so sorry, Love.” Draco kissed the base of Harry’s neck and kissed his way up to Harry’s jaw, while still slowly thrusting into Harry.
“Dray, you know what you have to do now right?” Draco nodded his head and took out his wand and cast a lubrication spell over his hand. Draco then reached around and slipped his hand between Harry’s cheeks until he found Harry’s entrance. Draco circled his finger around the hole a little bit trying to lubricate it a little bit, not wanting to hurt Harry, when Harry said, “Dray, just do it already, please.” Draco took his fingers and pushed two in right away causing Harry to gasp with surprise. “Dray,” slipped from Harry’s lips as the surprise spread across Harry’s features.
“Oh, Harry.” Lucius said before they completely walked out of the room. “I have that paperwork you wanted for whenever you want to fill it out.”
“Merlin, I hated that woman, and to insult my mother right in front of me was the biggest mistake she ever made. And the Dursley’s faces were priceless as they watched her inflate like a balloon.”
Harry thrusted his hips back and forth after his erection pushed his way into Draco’s entrance and settled into a smooth, rhythmic motion. “Uh, Harry. Yes, right there. Yes, please,” Draco screamed.
“Alright, while we are waiting, I’m going to take Harkin for a spin around the dance floor really quick.” Draco smirked, and Harkin stared up at him in fear.
“I know, I’m just saying you more than just stubborn, because you get it from both sides.” Sirius stated, and Harkin laughed again as she wrapped her arms around his neck.
“Worse now that he has gotten up and walked around, he literally just drained all the energy that his body had been compiling while he slept, and he drained it out of his system. If he keeps this up he’s going to slip into a coma.”
Harry went back up to bed and realized how light of a sleeper he had become. How was he going to deal with a roommate if a noise from the kitchen four floors down could wake him out of a dead sleep? Harry figured he’d deal with it when that came up. When Harry woke in the morning, Teddy was standing up in his crib looking at him with his favorite colored hair, blue. Harry climbed out of bed and pulled on his pajama pants and went to pick him up.
“No, not that. He would have known how to react to my outburst, but you were calm and collected, and Ron doesn’t know how to react to that.”
“Draco, calm down your emotions will affect her. Everything is fine just need to make sure that I cover all of my bases.” Melody stated calmly, because she noticed Harkin’s vitals spiking. Draco took a deep breath to calm himself, and Harkin’s vitals went back to normal. When Melody was done casting spells, she turned towards Narcissa and Draco, and she stated, “She is fine. It is just her body adjusting to all the change. The potion turning her into a girl, then being kidnapped and raped, which led her to get pregnant and the snake bite, which led to the bond. It’s just her body’s way of dealing with stress.”
When he walked in he met Professor McGonagall at the door. “Potter, eighth years are to sit at the house tables in the extended area in the back. It’s good to see you up on your feet.”
“I don’t think Lucius tried to kill Draco, he just didn’t want me and the abominations he thought the twins were to sally his family name.” Harkin tried.
“I’m here for you if you need me.” Harry took Draco’s hand and pulled him down on the bed so he was lying next to her and she rested her head on his shoulder. Draco just chuckled and wrapped his arm around her waist pulling her closer. “What’s so funny?” Harry whispered.
“He’ll be taken care of, Draco I promise. I’ll do it myself. We just have to get Harry out of harm’s way first, alright?” Severus said as he rushed over to the angry teen. Lucius and Severus then felt the burn of their dark marks, a signal that meant the Dark Lord wanted them at his side. “We have a problem. Narcissa, can you handle the rest of this, the Dark Lord is convening a meeting now.”
“Yes, it wasn’t the best experience. Which is why I never wanted to do it again.” Draco said as he gave Harry a look.
“Madam Pomfrey, please tell me there may be a chance that this could wear off or you or someone can turn me back.”
“I didn’t feel it was necessary Dolores, for the investigation into who is behind this is left up to Professor McGonagall, seeing as the student is from her house. The incident will be handled.”
They woke up to bangs and the entire house shaking, Draco was up and standing at the window before Harry could ask the question. “It is your friends at the order. Mostly the Weasley’s. And Granger. There is I believe Professor Lupin as well.” Harry struggled to stand up, and Draco was soon at his side scooping him into his arms. When they reached the window, Draco set him down to stand on his own two feet, but Harry still leaned against Draco for support.
Harry stepped out of bed and almost fell on his face, because he lost his balance. Harry righted himself as he grabbed the post of the bed. After the room stopped spinning, he tried to walk again, and he kept himself up as he walked towards the door on the one side of the room and walked into a bathroom. Harry looked in the mirror, and he looked awful.
“Harry, my mother may be intense, but she means well. I’m sorry, Harry, but you shouldn’t be afraid of her. I love you, Babe, and my mother knows this. She won’t hurt you if it means that I won’t be happy, because that’s all she wants, really. She just doesn’t want to have to explain to people about us, because, though she does accept us, she most likely does find that it is embarrassing to have a son that is gay, but she loves me and she can deal with that for me, because she loves me, Harry. That’s why she is the way she is, just remember that, love.” Draco ran his fingers through Harry’s hair and around the back of his neck, pulling him in for a hug.
“I didn’t want to start something I shouldn’t. Especially with you here.” Draco confessed when he walked back out in his uniform.
“Does mother not realize that having one of my professors trailing us at all times is going to be suspicious and weird for both of us?” Draco asked.
“Or I could just sleep with someone,” Harry joked, and Draco glanced up at him and saw the blush starting to creep into Harry’s cheeks. Draco laughed as he threw his towel to the side and pulled the still shivering Harry into his arms.
“Mr. Malfoy, please look at me.” Madam Pomfrey instructed, and Draco looked up at her. “I believe so, and this trauma probably isn’t going to help the condition she is in either. Some people are cruel, and I will let you know that Professor Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall will be notified and hopefully the culprit will be caught. In the meantime I should warn you that, Miss Potter may be extremely paranoid towards men until the culprit is caught, because if my suspicions are correct, he probably erased her memory.” Draco nodded, and he looked back down at her. “Just help be strong and patient with her. That is all the help I can give you I’m afraid. Now, head off to class, she’s in good hands.” Draco stood and took the note from her hand and headed out of the room.
“You found me?” Harry whispered as she looked at the bouquet of Snapdragons and Lilies. “Do you know what the meaning to these flowers are? Snapdragons mean graciousness and strength, while lilies mean purity and refined beauty. What are you trying to tell me, Draco?” Harry asked with a smile.
“The Dursley’s?” Narcissa questioned, and Harkin nodded. “Does Draco know? Would he be able to explain?” Narcissa asked, and Harkin nodded again.
“Harry, what are you doing? My mother is standing right over there,” Draco whispered as he looked into Harry’s eyes and melted into his hand. “What will she think about us?”
“You will always be my favorite.” Harkin whispered in his ear. “But don’t tell them that.” Harkin laughed, and so did Sirius.
while she was sleeping. She has informed me while still under Veritaserum that you only did it under the pretenses of your son’s happiness. Now I can accept this as the answer if it is the truth and not just Miss Potter’s assumption of the truth.”
Harry is different now, if only everyone else can accept it like she has, and new relationships are explored.
“No, but we need to know what the worst possibility is so we can prevent it, hopefully.” Draco said as the Healer walked into the wing.
“Then he had one of his friends do it for him.” Draco chuckled again, and this time, Umbridge turned directly towards Draco and walked up to him. “Is something amusing, Mr. Malfoy?”
“For Ginny and hoping that she understands why I can’t be with her and finds someone that deserves her in every way possible.” Harry said as he pushed memories towards Voldemort revolving around Ginny. The moment when he saved her in the Chamber of secrets, her dancing with Neville at the Yule Ball, her in D.A. showing off and being better than all of her brothers at fighting, every moment that they had shared together during last year.
“For Draco, and our new relationship and the future that we have with each other.” Harry pushed memories of the past week towards Voldemort and moments that Harry had with Draco before then anything and everything that showed the true feelings they had for each other.
“Wuv you, Hai.” The little boy tried, and Harry just smiled and kissed the top of the little boy’s head.
She found the nearest bathroom and bolted inside. She barely made it to the toilet before vomiting, and she heard Draco come in behind her, he came and brushed her hair away from her face and pulled it behind her so she didn’t get anything in her hair. When she finally stopped throwing up, Draco pulled her into his lap and wrapped his arms around her, and Harkin leaned into him and wrapped her arms around his neck. Draco leaned in and kissed her on the lips, but she pulled away from him. “I probably smell like vomit.” She whispered.
“Come lay down with me, Dray.” Harry muttered half asleep, and Draco laid down on the bed next to Harry. He brushed his fingers of his free hand against Harry’s cheek.
“Alright kiddo, num-num.” Harry set the one bottle down and uncapped the bottle that Teddy gestured to.
Professor McGonagall brought everyone to attention as the new first years were brought into the hall by new Transfiguration professor, Penelope Clearwater, Percy’s ex-girlfriend from Hogwarts. Harry leaned over to Ron, and he whispered, “Well, that’s going to be interesting. Wasn’t Percy the one that broke up with her?” Harry teased and Ron gave him a look that said he was glad that things were going back to normal between them.
Draco got Harry back in the bed and told him to wait here. He will be right back. Draco then made sure to cast a spell that allowed no one to enter or exit the room, and he was then down in the dining room, where he almost drank Harry dry, and he winced slightly before everyone entered. Draco stood there casually with his hand behind his back when they entered.
“Yeah, but it’s difficult for change to settle in and have it become the new normal.” Harkin stated.
“Don’t be, I killed my father and my aunt was no better than he was. She would have done the same thing to Harry.” Draco said with a straight face as they approached a wall, and Harry gave Snape a funny look.
“Let’s just say that Severus Snape is a unique creature, Ms. Granger.” Narcissa stated. “Now, don’t leave this compartment until you reach Hogwarts. Understand?”
“Malfoy Manor. The Dark Lord wouldn’t trust Nott with Harry again, and even with my Father’s indiscretions, he’s still better and more powerful than all of his followers that are free from Azkaban.”
“Are you sure, love? Because I can keep tickling you.” Draco whispered into her ear seductively, and Harry shivered against him.
“I won’t if I can avoid it. You two will probably be put on a watch list if they find out. Meaning if you step out of line even slightly they will take you down. Now another thing, this potion locks you into any magic that was irreversible before making any chance of you turning back impossible. You will be stuck as a woman forever there is no changing back.”
Harry stirred in Draco’s lap, and Draco wrapped his arm back around Harry. Harry wrapped his arms around Draco’s arm like a little girl with her favorite teddy bear, which made Draco chuckle a little bit. The way that Harry captured Draco’s arm had Draco’s hand resting next to Harry’s cheek, so Draco started stroking his finger down and across Harry’s cheek. Tonks rushed back into the room and pulled Harry out of Draco’s lap, and Draco and Narcissa were about to protest when Tonks held up her hand and pulled out her wand which made Draco jump off the couch and was about to start yelling when Harry woke up from being tousled.
“I just saw how sad you looked without him here. I figured I would try and cheer you up, but wasn’t sure if dancing would do the trick because neither one of us can dance.” She stated shyly, and Remus laughed, causing her to look up at him. “What’s so funny?” she asked.
“Please, just make an exception this once please. I need to get something from Harry Potter’s room for her, and she gave me the password. She doesn’t trust her things are safe, please.”
“As long as my father is alive, my family and I will never be safe.” Draco shouted, and Harkin jolted awake. “Har,” Draco whispered, and he was off of his bed, pulling her into his arms. “I’m sorry, Har. I am so sorry.” Draco whispered over and over.
“All of it. I met Andromeda in the hall, and she recognized me immediately. So we talked, and then she said she had to get here to talk to you, so I let her and followed behind her. I wanted to see what would happen. I do like the results, other than the crying, but I like the way that when you saw Teddy it reminded you of everything you were missing in your memories. You are going to be a great parent one day, Potter. I hope that I can see that, and our kids will be able to live civilly.”
“What’s wrong with it?” Harry questioned. “If we’re talking about size it is bigger than mine was.” Harry continued without looking up from her plate. When no one said anything, she looked up and took a sip of pumpkin juice, to find everyone staring at her. “What?” Harry asked with furrowed eyebrows.
“Yeah, their magic is strong. Har is fighting and pushing most of her magic to protect the baby. I think her mind and magic doesn’t realize that they’re safe.” Draco explained.
“Yes, you can continue.” Sirius said, and Harkin laughed as she wrapped her arms around her godfather.
Draco looked her up and down, checking her out, before smiling and taking her hand, and he lead her from the closet and down to the dining room. When they walked into the dining room, Harkin froze as she saw Sirius and Remus sitting at the table talking to Narcissa and Lucius. “Siri, Remy.” Harkin whispered, and the two men looked up at her and smiled.
Hermione walked over and rested her hand on Harry’s cheek. “Draco, calm down. His temperature is definitely climbing. He’s not that cold anymore. You won’t have to move away; you’ll just have to be extra careful. Harry can take care of himself, he always has. You two will figure this out if it ends up being a long term thing. His breathing is normal, he’s warmer lready than he was when I walked in.”
“Dad, I…we…uh…” Draco stuttered, and Harkin smiled and pulled her invisibility cloak out and threw it over them. Harkin then pulled Draco down the hall and quickly into their room, and she quickly pulled the door behind her and cast a locking and silencing charm on the room. She then pulled the invisibility cloak off, and she laughed as she pulled her knickers out of Draco’s trouser pocket and pulled them on. Draco chuckled, and Harkin looked at him. “We are going to be in so much trouble when they find us. Mum and dad are going to freak when they find out we did it on the table in the dining room. Why didn’t you say anything to stop me?” Draco groaned as he flopped down on the bed.
“We clean up, go to bed and worry about it in the morning. Is that alright?” Draco said, and Harry rested his head back down on Draco’s shoulder.
“First, Harry must change. Mipsy will take her to her room and show her a special gift that I got for her. Mipsy!” Voldemort shouted, and the elf appeared. “Take Harry up to her room and show her that special gift I got for her.”
“It’s alright. I’m not usually this emotional.” Harkin whispered. “It’s understandable that you would all be a little shocked at my outburst.”
“Your mother doesn’t want you wandering around without an adult with you until your father and Thaddeus are caught.” Severus stated.
“Alright I’ll follow you through, but I do have to get back to Remus so I won’t be staying for too long.” Sirius said, and Harry went through and appeared in the Manor drawing room and Sirius followed soon after. “Now talk.”
“I said I might be wrong about that I just know that he’s up to something but I don’t know what it is? It could have happened already but it also might not have.” Draco stated. “I want you to go talk to her, and see if I’m wrong.”
“Okay, then can I talk about it if you don’t want to?” Harkin questioned as she made Draco look her in the eyes.
“I think it’s because since we’ve been bonded, we’ve never been so far away from each other. You were in London and I was here in Wiltshire. That’s 90 miles apart.” Draco stated, and Harkin turned towards him and raised an eyebrow at him. “What?” He asked.
“I think I might have heard about Thaddeus Nott escaping custody a few weeks ago, I thought yours mother would have told you, because your father escaped as well." Melody stated and Draco looked furious.
“Yeah, I was just fixing you, Potter. Nothing to worry about. I was just leaving.” Draco walked out of the room, and back to the dorm he now shared with Potter.
“But if you would have let me finish, he will most likely gain most of it back, once he starts up where he left off, coming back in bits and pieces. That is the good news, Granger.” Hermione looked over and a smile slipped onto her face.
“Yes, I am. Merlin that is weird to think about.” Harkin whispered, and Draco just chuckled at her. “What?” Harkin asked as she turned back towards Draco.
“Yeah, we got all of the dark arts books up on the top shelves, and it is a lot less gloomy there now. I like the new style that Harry has going on in the house.”
“Well, Lily was beautiful even if I didn’t like her, it was actually one of the many reasons I thought I didn’t like her.” Narcissa chuckled.
Draco doesn’t know when everyone left, but he faintly heard the door closed and he was on top of Harry again. “Merlin, you know how to torture me already.” Draco murmured as he leaned back down and started sucking on Harry’s neck again. One hand sliding between them and took over what Harry was doing, and Harry was soon cumming over Draco’s hand. Draco came just from the smell and watching Harry pleasure himself earlier, and Draco licked the wound on Harry’s neck and watched as it healed on its own.
“Draco, come sit; we have some unexpected guests,” Lucius ordered as he looked around the table and indicated the seat next to Harry, since the chairs across from Harry were occupied. Draco glanced over at the men and then at Harry. Draco could see the fear and worry written across Harry’s face, and he quickly sat down in the seat and rested his hand on Harry’s leg to reinsure him. The meal went about very slowly, and when Lucius finally dismissed Draco and Harry, the pair was more than happy to leave as quickly and quietly as possible.
“Lucius, why are you doing this? Please not in front of our guest, can you talk to him in the morning either after or before breakfast, please,” Narcissa begged.
“Remus and I both have no coordination. Our significant others are the ones that have the dancing talent. So, I don’t know how well that is going to go.” Harkin stated.
“No, cub. That isn’t what I think at all. You are both important to me, both of you are my family, my pack, I can’t lose either of you. You saved him, cub. You saved him.” Remus said as he pulled Harkin into a hug as she started crying on his shoulder with her arms wrapped tight around his neck. “I already knew that he was going to come back. He will. They can’t take him away, not after what they did to him the first time. He’s going to make it out of it this time. I promise, cub.” Remus whispered in her ear, and he heard her sniffle.
“Stop interrupting, dragon. I was ashamed. There was no way my parents wouldn’t disown me for my transgression. I broke the rules of courting and those of pureblood ways, so without telling anyone about what the results were, I had Madam Pomfrey terminate my pregnancy from complete fear of my family, without even talking to your father about what happened. Now, before you judge your mother, think about how different I grew up from how you grew up. Sex isn’t as big of a deal as it was when I was young. I you were having sex before marriage when I was your age, no one knew except the two people involved. I couldn’t deal with the stress of having to tell my parents so I got rid of the evidence, the baby. I didn’t tell, anyone, not even your father, and until I was four months out of school. Your father, the clever man that he is, noticed how off I was, and questioned me on it. I, of course, pushed it off as nothing, but he would have nothing of it. Finally, he got the entire story out of me, and the shame came crashing down on me. once again not only because I got pregnant before I was married, but also because in my entire thought process about the pregnancy I never once thought to ask your father his opinion on the pregnancy. He was furious with me, and I pulled away from the relationship, I think in that moment in the entire time I have known him, I was actually afraid of him. That day was the only day, he raised his hand to me and yelled at me. I feared the man I loved, and I pulled farther away from him.
“Oh, I guess. Since you’ll be dead anyway. I plan to take everything she loves from her, starting with her husband, and then work my way from the oldest to the youngest child. You would have originally been after Ronald, of course, but you were the easiest target to do first. Lull her into a self-hope that you will be my only victim.”
“That’s not up to me, Molly. You can talk to Andromeda about that, since she’s the one raising him, not me. He’ll be over for Christmas that’s about all I can promise. Well, the train is going to be leaving soon so I have to go, I’ll see you over Christmas break.” Harry gave her a half hug as he walked away and over to Andromeda. “I fixed the wards last night before going to bed. You and Teddy are the only ones allowed inside the wards in anyway other than me. I don’t want another repeat of last week, you can let people in through the front door, but just watch who you let in, alright?”
“Cissy, I would love to but I’m technically not even supposed to be outside right now. Being an escaped criminal and all.” Sirius whispered.
“Yeah, everything after that gets hard to focus on and is really blurry. It’s giving me a headache really. Where are my glasses; that might help?” Hermione picked up a pair of glasses that Harry didn’t recognize. “How much am I missing, Hermione?”
“I don’t spend that much, father. I have money saved up over the years. Like I said, I’m not as stupid as you seem to think I am.” Draco stated as he pulled away from the door, and he glanced at his father. “I’m not the little boy you can push around, father.”
“I don’t know, it was a change, and I kind of like it long. It hides my scar better than with my short hair.”
“That sounds like logic that Miss Potter would use, Mr. Weasley. If we are just going to be throwing out blame because we think it is them we end up with people like Sirius Black.” Snape said as he walked into the hospital wing, and everyone turned to look at the man.
“Well, I would have been better this year if everyone wouldn’t have been against me, thinking that I’m a lying freak. I get that enough at home, thank you. Now, if you excuse me, I need to leave before I lose my temper and do something I will regret.” Harry batted Draco’s hand away and walked out of the room, slamming the door behind her.
“Well, you won’t be doing much talking. It’ll be more like screaming, Potter, so you don’t have to call me anything.”
“Yes, but apparently Lily forgave me, and she hoped that if anything were to happen to the four of you she would have someone. Someone Lily trusted to take care of her son, and now daughter, even if everyone else was gone.” Severus stated.
“No, I’m not, but I think you do deserve everyone an explanation.” Draco stated, and Harkin sighed as she sat up a little straighter against Draco as Narcissa stayed crouched in front of her.
“You know that Minerva won’t let you do that. She will write you a letter telling you to get your arse to Hogwarts this year. She isn’t letting any of us that were supposed to graduate last year get out of it. You have two weeks before the term starts, respond before you don’t have a room left.” Hermione went back to quietly looking through the books and organizing them. They finally organized the books in the order they wanted them by the end of the day. They got rid of the furniture and changed the curtains so the entire room was friendlier and less dark.
“You think that is true don’t you.” Lupin said as he grabbed Draco’s arm and twisted it snapping the bone. Draco pushed the pain away, but he heard a blood curdling scream come from upstairs.
“That’s alright, Madam Pomfrey. I’m in no rush to change back especially if it’ll do more damage than good.” Harry stated, and Madam Pomfrey nodded.
“No, I think I won’t.” Harkin said as some derby fell from the ceiling, collapsing right on top of her. All she could do was scream, before she fell unconscious.
“Ronald would like to apologize, but he would like to have a real conversation with you not in the middle of the great hall where everyone can hear. I am here to make sure he doesn’t do anything stupid, and you can bring Draco if you wish.” Ginny stated, and Harkin nodded as she stood carefully, and Draco quickly beat her upright to help her stand, so she didn’t fall over. The couple nodded as they were upright, and Ginny smiled as she turned and started shuffling her brother out of the great hall. Harkin saw Draco glance over his shoulder at Severus, and she nodded in acknowledgement, letting Draco know that she was alright with Severus trailing them. This all around seemed weird to Harkin, she knew her friends and she wasn’t sure she knew how to process what might possibly be going on right now.
“Draco, is Potter the one that you were doing in the shower earlier?” Pansy asked and Harry’s head popped up, glanced over at Pansy and then at Draco, who looked up at the movement. Draco leaned his forehead against Harry’s and pulled him in for a kiss.
“Yes, but we would like to be informed when you decide to leave. You might be used to doing whatever you want whenever you want, but you are part of our family, and also carrying the next generation of Malfoy and Potter. You have to be careful, you have to think about more than yourself, there are two of you now, Miss Potter.” Lucius scolded.
“I wish for the prefect to escort all of the students to their dorms and not to leave until your head of house states so. Your head of house will take roll call and you will stay in the dorms until farther notice.” Dumbledore said and then dismissed the students, and he turned to the staff. “As soon as roll is done I want the staff to find all of the students not accounted for. We will find who is responsible for this disturbance at punish them accordingly.” Dumbledore then dismissed the staff and they headed off to their required sections.
“Love, that’s amazing.” Draco groaned and threw his head back, and Harry screamed as Draco’s cum erupted inside him. Draco pushed forwards pinning Harry to the shower wall, and Harry’s arms wrapped tighter around Draco’s neck for support. After they finally caught their breath, Harry unwrapped his legs from Draco’s waist as Draco slowly pulled out of Harry, and Harry’s feet were on the shower floor again. “That’s the best shower sex I’ve ever had.” Draco stated as he reached over to turn the now cold water off, and he looked at Harry, who was shivering. “Let’s get out of here and get some clothes on so we can go eat.”
In their fourth year, they had the Tri-Wizard Tournament, the year that Harry realized his feelings for Draco, but not that he felt the same way. The Tri-Wizard Tournament was the hardest thing that Harry had ever been through: the dragon, the Yule Ball, trying to safe Draco from the Black Lake, the maze, Voldemort rising, him killing Cedric Diggory, and then the fact that Barty Crouch Jr. tried to kill him after he got back from the maze that he just survived, and then having to deal with Draco after wards. Draco has chewed him out at the end of every year for something or other, most of the time it is because he put himself in danger and didn’t need to.
“Yes, Potter. It is, my wife loved torture.” Harry bit his tongue as the pain coursed through his veins like fire. “Hurts doesn’t it.” He then picked up another knife that looked identical to the first one and threw it, and it impaled in Harry’s other shoulder. Harry could feel as the knife had the same effect only this one coursed across his skin. He felt like his was burning from the inside out, the pain rippling through him.
“Probably because it didn’t paint him in a good light.” Harkin joked, and Draco and Severus both laughed.
They gathered their trunks and owls, and started carrying them out onto the platform. Harry waved to Hagrid as they passed him on the way to the carriages. They climbed into the first carriage as it took off, and the carriage ride was quiet as they drew closer to Hogwarts and stopped at the gate. Harry pulled his things out of the carriage, and up to the castle. He placed his trunk with the rest of the trunks and headed into the Great Hall.
“Nagini, no.” Harry yelled and took two steps forwards and an arm in the way as Nagini struck. The first bit caught Harry’s arm but the second got Arthur as well as the third and fourth. Harry collapsed into Lucius’ arms and the man gathered her up and called Nagini to him. The snake slithered up and around Lucius’ shoulders and rested her head on Harry’s shoulder as Lucius ran past Arthur and to the lifts. They ended up in the Atrium where Lucius disapparated the second he stepped out of the lift and they were standing in the front foyer of Malfoy Manor.
“It’s a guess. The Dark Lord’s greatest fear is his death, it’s logical. I know of one he had as does Albus, and Potter was the one to destroy it.”
“Yeah, I heard that she was taking McGonagall’s position as Transfigurations professor. I wonder who got the other two positions that are missing this year.”
“Draco and I are practically married already, so I mean I kind of am.” Harkin stated as blush rose into her cheeks.
“Quiet!” She yelled and the room fell silent. “Alright, so this year we have a little change of pace. We lost a few professors last year and some of them were a good riddance, and some were very dear, but we survived. I would like to introduce my replacement as Transfigurations professor, Penelope Clearwater. A lovely student that left six years ago, and was very glad to take up the position in possibility of a temporary position or a permanent position until we have decide. I would also like to welcome our new Defense Against the Dark Arts professor, Luka Paxal. He is a British wizard that moved to France for a diplomatic position after he left school and is back to temporarily fill the position until a better candidate comes around,” McGonagall said as she glanced over at the Gryffindor table, and Harry knew she was looking at him. “And finally, we come to our New Muggle Studies professor, Susan Lockerd. She is a muggle-born that was a part of the Muggles relations office at the Ministry before Voldemort closed down the department. She has agreed to join us this year, and it is unknown if she will stay, but we’ll see how the year goes. Now, time to get to the feast. Begin.” She swung her arms out and the food started appearing on the table.
“Draco Lucius Malfoy, you better have not done what I think you did in the dining room.” Narcissa’s voice boomed through the Manor, and Harkin flinched. She was dead. She was so dead.
Harry wasn’t far behind as he came screaming Draco’s name in Parseltongue. Harry pulled out of Draco, and he rolled them to the side with Draco’s legs still wrapped around him. Draco’s one leg slid down and wrapped around Harry’s leg, and they laid like that until there was a knock on the door. Harry grabbed the blanket and pulled it over then in just enough time for the door to open and someone walk in.
“Both, it’s hard to tell everything, especially when you don’t know all the information.” Neville finished cleaning up his station.
“Perfect. You owl Fred, and I will owl mother.” Draco stated, and he turned towards Harkin, who was starting to look pale. “Love, are you feeling alright? You look a little pale.” Draco observed, and she looked up to Draco.
“Yes, I have the rest of my life to be with him. Thank you, Narcissa, for checking up on me.” Harkin said.
“Coward. That is what he is. He knew he could never beat her in a fair fight, so as she decided to be a good person, he stabbed her in the back.” Draco stated through grit teeth, and Severus knew that he had to defuse this before Draco did something stupid.
“Since it is the Dark that possesses his mind, Harry will be trapped in a small recess of his mind trapped with his worst fears. I hope Mr. Potter isn’t afraid of much and can fight them off efficiently because it may be possible for him to fight his way out.”
“Let’s stop talking about the worst possibility. We don’t even know the answer to these questions that you need to ask.”
“You may not want to stand so close to me, Severus. Thinking about Harry like that makes me thirsty.” Draco murmured, and Severus stepped back. “Thank you, I don’t want to have to talk about that just yet. Thank you for that sunlight potion as well. That was greatly appreciated.”
“Yes, Professor.” Ron gulped as he quickly turned tail and ran, and Harkin sighed before turning and started walking towards their rooms. Draco close behind her, and Severus followed behind them both. They reached their bedroom door, and quietly whispered the password before entering. Harkin hurried over to the bedroom door, and she practically slammed it shut, which startled both Draco and Severus.
“Oh, really I don’t see that going well, love.” Draco said as he slipped two fingers inside of her and her eyes rolled back in her head as she closed her eyes.
“That doesn’t make you fine, love.” Draco said as he stared her down. “You are pale, and you are running a slight fever.” He finished. “I’m calling Mel. I’m surprised she cleared you in this condition.” Draco stated as he moved towards the door, but didn’t get too far with Harkin’s hand wrapped around his wrist.
“I would have told poor Theo anyway if you hadn’t said anything. In fact, I’ll write him myself and see if he would like to join us for dinner tomorrow. Oh, and Draco, darling, you’ll be sitting at the head of the table.” Narcissa stated as she walked out of the room.
He found Harry lying asleep on the floor next to the bed, and he wondered if he had another nightmare and fell off or if he was trying to get out of bed and fell, hitting his head. Draco was then at his side and he lifted Harry and placed him on the bed. He looked him over for any blood and found none or any scraps of any kind. He sighed of relief and woke Harry up.
“He said the wedding band is interlocking with this one. So when we get married, he’ll slide the wedding band on and it will automatically link with the engagement ring.” Harkin stated.
“Our bond, you dumb arse.” Harkin yelled. “Our bond makes us one being. We are healthier with each other, and since I’m pregnant my system needs both of us to help keep my body stable. It is why Severus switched our schedules around and got us our own room to share.”
He feed Teddy the baby food and then carried him back upstairs for his bath and bed time. In the end both of them were covered in the baby food and soaked, so Harry finished giving Teddy a bath and put him to bed in his pajamas, and then he went to take his own shower. When he finished, he got ready for bed, and climbed in bed. He pulled that days paper off his night stand and started reading it. The headline read: MALFOY FAMILY OFF ON ALL CHARGES AGAINST THEM. Harry smiled as he read the headline, it meant that his letter worked, and he hoped that they would never find out per instructions in his letter. Harry started reading the article and it read:
“Not much, Mrs. Malfoy. I’m not very good at Herbology. I’m passing only because of Hermione. Why do you ask?”
“What if it’s too painful to go back? I lost everything there, Hermione. Ginny won’t speak to me, Ron won’t speak to me, no one who were friends with me before can look at me the same, Hermione. I just want to fix up Grimmauld Place and live my life out quietly, with Andromeda and Teddy here with me.” Harry said as he went through the books on the shelves. Pulling them off the shelves, dusting them off, and setting them in the piles on the floor, while Hermione organized them.
“Already brought up with the headmaster and both of their heads of house. They have access to each other’s common rooms and they have their own rooms. Though Harkin had one from before with her gender change.” Lucius explained.
“That may have worked if the Dark Lord never found out, but now that he does, he won’t do anything to sway Harry from his side. He will also move any remaining Horcruxes that he may have and keep them close.” Severus stated.
Draco doesn’t know how long he laid their just staring at her, before she started to stir, and when her eyes fluttered open, and she smiled up at him. “Hey, how are you feeling, love?”
Draco, Ron, and Hermione ran through the halls until they reached the Gryffindor Common Room. “What are we doing here? What help will this do?”
“Well, your mother went out to breakfast with my mother, and we weren’t hungry, so they went without us. Is that alright?” Draco asked. “May I ask who you are?”
“Six months ago, when you realized Draco wasn’t you, and you weren’t your father. He’s dead, darling, you don’t have to keep trying to impress him. Children are like flowers, you can only support them for so long before you have to let them grow on they’re own. We need to let our baby dragon spread his wings and fly. That doesn’t make him any less my baby dragon.” Narcissa stated, and Lucius just nodded in response.
Draco didn’t try to get him to repeat it, he just tried to get Harry warm, and eventually, Harry stopped shivering and his legs dropped to the ground. Draco let him go but Harry didn’t. “Love, if you want to stay warm you should probably put on your clothes.”
“I have the perfect one. Dobby.” Harkin stated and said house elf popped into existence next to her.
“Yes. I’ve talked to Severus. He will take custody of you, but you will be here whenever on break from school if you leave school. He will have every say in your care even if you wish he not know. We figured this would be easier than going through the trouble of having us gain guardianship of you. This will make getting permission for your marriage easier. Though because you are both still under 17 our rules are different than those of the muggle world.”
Another chapter down. Sorry i am awful at updating. real life sadly gets in the way of my writing. too much work taking up my time.
“Again, everything. Were you aware that Mr. Potter was captured by Snatchers six days ago as well? He was recognized immediately and taken to Malfoy Manor. The entire household had been emptied except three people. Narcissa, Lucius and Draco Malfoy. After the Dark Lord had Draco turned Draco ripped his throat out, and his father detained him locking him in his room. The Dark Lord then died. As Lucius helped the other Death Eaters set up the next base camp elsewhere Narcissa burned the Dark Lords body and released the prisoners in their cellar except one. Miss Lovegood, but she moved her to one of the guest rooms in the North Wing of the Manor and placed wards around the room to make it so Draco couldn’t find her while they made sure that Draco didn’t fed, unfortunately while Narcissa was out taking the people that they had had in their cellar to St. Mungos, the Snatchers came and dropped Mr. Potter off at the Manor where Draco unaware of his action do to the fact that he had never fed had them take Mr. Potter up to his bedroom and he dismissed the Snatchers before he changed his mind. Mr. Potter than came too and tried to escape Draco’s attacks, but was unsuccessful. Mr. Potter was subject to being Draco’s first. Narcissa came home and stopped him before he killed Mr. Potter, which she was just in time because Draco almost killed him a few more moments and Mr. Potter would have been dead.”
“It isn’t about whether either of us can dance; it is about making the other person feel better. Sirius was always the one who could dance, and he would always parade me around the dance floor, spinning and dipping and everything else that he could do, and it would make me laugh. That’s what dancing is really about. Making sure your partner is having a good time. Even in school when we would have a dance, and Siri and I weren’t even technically together, but James knew we would end up together, Siri would always parade me around the dance floor. Because he would see me sitting in the corner of the room, by myself, because James would have a date and so would Siri, and Peter,” Remus took a deep breath at the mention of their ex-best friend’s name, and then continued, “Peter would never go, because he didn’t like dances too much.”
“Yeah, of course. Have you seen the garden, yet? It’s beautiful. I actually helped Narcissa put it together.” Harkin boasted slightly.
Harry thought as Madam Malkin measured her and made a few uniforms for Harry. When they were finished, McGonagall walked them to Gringotts and took some money out of Harry’s account to turn into muggle money.
“Sev, please, don’t. It won’t help the situation and I don’t want to press charges. I just want to go and lie down, please.” Harkin stated, and Severus bowed his head.
“I did. He was torturing Harry after I told him to leave him alone. He disobeyed.” Draco said as he glanced at the werewolf for the first time.
They followed Ginny and Ron out into the corridor, and then they made a turn to head upstairs, and this through up red flags for Harkin, and she stopped immediately. “No.” Harkin stated, and Draco stopped as well. Initially because Harkin did, but then to turn towards Ron. “Did you place the Imperius curse on your sister, Ron?” Harkin asked as she finally saw the glazed over eyes that Ginny’s eyes shouldn’t be, and Harkin pulled her wand out of her pocket as did Draco.
Draco watched as his mother walked out of the room, and he turned back towards Harkin. “Did my mother pretty much just give us permission to have sex on the dining room table?” Draco questioned.
Ginny stepped up to Severus and whispered, “If this has anything to do with Harry I am there, and no one can stop me, Headmaster.” Ginny snarled the last word and walked past him. Ron shrugged as he walked past and Hermione did the same.
There was a knock on the door, and the two boys froze. Harry turned towards the door and said, “Who is it?”
“The usual goblin war. What else does the man talk about?” Hermione stated, and Harry started to laugh. Everyone at the Gryffindor table turned to stare at her, and she started to laugh even more.
“You are not a freak. You are a beautiful young woman, who just so happened used to be a man. You have had some awful things happen to you. Your life isn’t the most ideal, but you have defeated the darkest wizard of all time before your 16
Draco pushed his broom towards where Harry just zipped and zoomed faster to catch up. Draco leveled with Harry, and he looked over at her with a smirk. Harry looked over at Draco and she smirked back at him. “Feels like old times.” She said and zipped past him.
“I forgot about the side effects. It makes your body respond to hot and cold kind of like a reptile, where if you’re standing in the shade you’re cold and if you’re standing in the sun you’re warm.”
“Harry, are you alright? I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to…” Draco was saying before he was cut off by a kiss from Harry.
“Well, real parents or guardians will take care of you, and will worry when you just disappear without telling them where you’re going. They are informed when something happens to you.” Draco stated.
“Draco, dragon, I was wondering if you were going to join us, and I see Harry is alright. You gave us quite a scare, sweetheart.”
“Good point.” George said and he turned back to talk to Angelina. Harry turned back towards Ron and Hermione, and she caught Draco’s eyes out of the corner of hers and started blushing slightly again. Ron and Hermione both noticed, but Hermione was the one to bring it up.
“She’s doing well. Harry moved her and Teddy into Grimmauld Place with him, and it’s been going well. You can tell she is sad because Dora is gone and Ted is gone and Remus is gone, but she’s doing better now that she lives in Grimmauld Place. You should go and see her I think she would love that.” Hermione said, and Harry could feel himself slipping into sleep and eventually he did. The next thing Harry know is waking up in a bed in his pajamas. He sat up and looked around the room, and found that it didn’t look familiar to him.
“Yeah, I’m fine, Dray. I fine. Are you alright?” Harry asked as he started scanning Draco for injuries, but found none.
“Potter was in danger of the Dark Lord, and I didn’t realize that Draco and Potter’s bond was so pronounced. They are both under the stasis charm. They will be fine, Narcissa. I promise. As long as we find Ravenclaw’s whatever it is.” Snape said.
Hermione kneel down on the floor and brushed Harry’s hair away from his face. Harry’s eyes fluttered open, and they met Hermione’s concerned ones. “’Mione, what happened?”
“Yes, I was just having a nightmare.” Harry said as he curled in on himself. Draco pulled him into his arms, and held him there. He tried to calm him down but nothing worked. He laid down pulling Harry with him, and they laid there for a while entangled in each other and the blankets around them. Draco felt as Harry finally drifted off to sleep, and he pulled Harry into his arms and moved him so he was lying in the bed the proper way and he rearranged the sheets so they were draped over Harry.
“I think we better be going and getting Lucius to take you to the Ministry.” Voldemort said as he stood up and took Harry’s hand and pulled her from the room. They went and found Lucius sitting in the dining room eating diner. “Lucius, I have a task for you. I require you to take Harry to the Ministry so she can complete her task. I want you to make sure she gets in and out without a problem.” Lucius stood and bowed the Voldemort.
“Dray, you sure you want to continue. I have a feeling that she is going to tell your mother and I’m pretty sure your mother was serious about us not doing this.”
“A Malfoy made a public display of affection, and people don’t know how to deal with it. We haven’t been making public displays of affection for centuries because of our prestigious status in the wizarding world. We think we’re better than everyone else, and they don’t need to know what is going on. But that is going to change, because we don’t need to pretend in public. I love you and I’m going to show it when I want to, not when my heritage says I should.” Draco stated, and Harkin smiled at him.
“Shhh…everything is going to be alright.” Draco whispered as he held her against his chest. Narcissa and Lucius walked in to find them, and Lucius vanished the vomit as Narcissa walked over to Draco and Harry.
“Ah, Miss Parkinson no doubt, but I assure you, Professor. Harry and I are just talking. I felt that our conversation didn’t need the eavesdropping of the entire school since I noticed a small crowd gathering. Miss Potter and I didn’t need the information to be spread.”
“We’ll come back later. Alright? You don’t need all of us here right now. We love you.” Hermione successfully pulled Ron from the room and Snape started guiding them towards his office where he put the Sword of Gryffindor back in its case and placed the Diadem in a box with the locket, cup, diary, and ring.
