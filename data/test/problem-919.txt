He is surprised that Madam Pince hasn’t come hurtling round the corner with her finger already raised to her paper-thin lips, ordering Ron to shut his gob. She could be at dinner, it is around that time, but somehow Harry has the impression that she never eats and rather feeds on the fear of the first years that she terrifies.
thanks for reading :)
be doing now that it’s the bloody weekend, and then inescapably stressing when it doesn’t happen. For this reason, they are indeed usually his most unproductive time- the most anxiety-inducing- and he dreads them as they approach. At least in the week, he can pretend that it is okay that he lives in a sort of gloomy isolation rather than being someone who goes out every day, because, then, nobody does.
“Oh really?” Harry laughs, “You’re an animal lover now? I’ll have to tell Hagrid. He’ll be overjoyed. Maybe he’ll even let you join in with feeding the Blast- ended Skrewts now and again.”
At the weekend, Harry, Ron and Hermione take a trip to The Three Broomsticks after sitting in the cold all day for the Quidditch match. Ron is feeling miffed, he can tell, about not being allowed to participate this year, and claims that he needs to get sloshed to dull the pain. Harry knows it isn’t a smart idea for himself to fly, regardless of him being an eighth year. One little episode, and he could collapse off of his broom before anyone is any the wiser. That doesn’t mean his heart didn’t ache when, in reflex, he spotted the snitch before either the Hufflepuff or the Gryffindor seeker.
“Yes, yes.” She replies distractedly.
“It can’t be that bad,” offers Hermione, but as she says it, a pained snort escapes her. She and Harry glance at each other and he sees tears of laughter forming in her eyes.
Justin makes a sudden whiney noise at something Elliot says, and wipes vigorously at his eyes. He looks around in disbelief and snarls at the phone. Then, in an instant, his demeanour snaps from an all-consuming rage to a cold nothing. “Right then,” he says, chillingly calm, “Is that it?”
, he tells himself, only partially lying.
He and Ron are currently playing a game of Wizard’s Chess in the common room as Hermione reads through her Potions notes. He feels in oddly high spirits after his visit with Hagrid, and he takes in the atmosphere- jovial and animated tonight- with pleasure, rather than with anxiety. That is a start, he supposes, and smiles to himself.
Wandering on, he stops at a quieter spot underneath a shady tree and drops to rest against the trunk. Although he knows that he won’t be here long, Harry feels that if he returned home now, in this rare state of productivity, he would be letting himself down. There’s a girl about his age, with shoulder length brown hair which falls in waves, resting on her elbows a few feet away from him. She has a thick book out, and her mustard sandals are kicked off, discarded in the grass.
“What!” Hermione rubs at her face, which only serves to spread the ink further onto her forehead and her hands. “Agh!”
A light seems to swell before him- it must be bright because he can see it, even though his eyes are tightly shut and leaking. He opens them and, to his delight, sees the ball of silver from earlier. Granted, it could still be dark magic but he places some sense of faith in the beauty of the thing. It pulsates, as if agreeing.
, and still manages to feel a flickering flame of anger. Dumbledore. Snape. They were supposed to protect him- he was supposed to be able to rely on them- but what good had they really done him in the end.
, Harry reads; the wind howls louder.

“Stop, Seamus!” Dean says, “Shut up, will you?”
button.
He doesn’t see Malfoy once, or at least, not in person. There is a constant image of him in Harry’s mind, water droplets from his shower rolling down his icy skin as he stares daggers in Harry’s direction. Getting evermore crinkled in his satchel, the cursed papers feel like the weight of one thousand lead cauldrons. Even Harry after a Weasley Christmas dinner isn’t as heavy.
Malfoy to come near him, and that he only wants to know why Malfoy thinks he is too good to speak to the rest of them.
Then, something peculiar grabs his attention. He glances down only to see the same piece of paper being slid between the crack under the door. Dismayed, Harry thinks that maybe Malfoy just returned it without reading. So much for his great plan.
He scarcely manages to fold up the robes that he had purchased from Madame Malkin’s, and say goodnight to Cindy, before collapsing in the vast expanse of his bed. Finding that he’s utterly exhausted, he drops into a slumber almost as soon as his head hits the pillow. Dreams of white daisy petals, a love that doesn’t exist, and the impending
“Aha!” she says excitedly, “I see your tactic! Trying to change the subject won’t work on me Harry.” Damn it. “How come you were in London then ? Are you back in Scotland with the person you love?” She laughs again.
The cotton of his bed-sheets are blissfully soft against his skin, and he allows himself to be enveloped. Making way for his weight, the mattress dips, holding his sore body in its grasp- even though today feels like a good one, he still aches from head to toe. OK, to be fair, maybe he has been receiving other support as well- beds have truly been kind to him in his desperate, miserable hours of need.
And a second theory, worse yet, begins to brew and stew in his already bubbling brain. It is painful to consider, excruciating to contemplate. Certainly, though, it demands to be heard.
“Never. If I can defeat Voldemort, I can bloody well beat you in a game of Wizard’s Chess at least once.” And at that, Ron chortles, a deep and earthy sound that, in some strange feat of nature, is actually relaxing to Harry. Most people enjoy the patter of rain, or the crackling of the fire. Not Harry- no. He is unfortunately attuned to Ron and his ungraceful noises.
“Of course. Sorry, dear,” and he mimes locking his lips with a theatrical flare, finishing the performance by pretending to throw the key away. The affection on Dean’s face as his smiles down at him is too much for Harry to bear; it reminds him of the doting couple that used to live down Privet Drive, the poor sods. It couldn’t have been much fun- what with the judgemental and intrusive collection of neighbours on the street. This is all very odd, he thinks.
Ron turns to him slowly, his body language signifying to Harry, before he even opens his mouth, that he has some unfortunate news to share. His ginger head is stooped low, his hands are furrowed in his pockets and his feet are pointing inwards. He is the picture of defeat.
doing?” He doesn’t know how it happens- it is a complete accident- but the air turns sour within seconds. He supposes it is their human instinct, to concede to their animosity, and yet he can’t help but feel like he has massively fucking let himself down.
“What?” says Ron, confused, “Why?”
“Oh yeah, that’s good,” he tries to conjure up something interesting to say and finds nothing except, “The weather is nice today.”
“It was an accident,” he replies, not making much sense and not caring to elaborate. This earns him a frown.
, of all people- Harry will not allow these obstacles to surpass the friendship between the three of them, as he is a little scared he might have been beginning to do.
“And?” he eggs Malfoy on, tasting fire which tickles his throat.
Justin raises his eyebrows, and even Anthony stifles a laugh, breaking his grouchy mood. Having seen it used with Muggles, Harry is aware that you don’t usually have the person at the other end of the line playing out loud like this, but he doesn’t know how to change it, and he is too scared to signal for Justin’s help.
franchise, and that is about it. He does love it though- ever since him and Ron had sat down with a Butterbeer and gotten through the whole thing. He doesn’t own a highly classy, extremely elegant, pair of merchandised socks for nothing, thank you very much.
“How are you feeling?” Harry asks, desperate to know but the words tasting wrong on his tongue either way.
“Oi, shut that up will you, Justin?” complains Anthony from his bed. Harry had thought him asleep, but his wakefulness is apparent- though clearly fresh, judging from his still puffy eyes. The boy has massively come out of his shell in the past few days. Harry is glad, it has even encouraged him to do the same in many ways, but Anthony’s newfound ease with them also brought the knowledge that he can be honest-to-god unbearably grumpy.
Realising how bizarre the situation is, he sighs. Two rivals in the night attempting to find solace in antagonising each other, yet a pathetic bit of vomit brings them it instead. It is that, but still so much more- and so much less.
They don’t speak for a few minutes and he almost drifts off to sleep. Beyond him, the mountainous landscape is shrouded in dark clouds, and it is wonderfully moody. He had always thought of the wind as an agent of chaos, unpredictable and vicious. Now, he finds it soothing to be blown about. If only he had a tea, then he would be truly peaceful. Oh, and if the Slytherin across from him went away. Having your longtime rival join your midnight brooding is never the greatest source of relaxation. And yet, absurdly, he is- relaxed, that is. He thinks about how proud Dumbledore would be to see him not throttling Malfoy at the nearest opportunity, and isn’t sure whether that makes him want to do it more or less.
Malfoy just flutters his pale eyelashes mockingly, and Harry feels affronted by this
“Watch me beat you,” challenges Harry.
“You’re glittery, mate,” says Ron with amusement. He sits up and wiggles his long freckled nose humorously as he scans Harry’s face.
As they approach their reassigned dormitories and common room, Harry observes the unfamiliar surroundings warily. It is situated in the opposite corridor of the one which leads to the greenhouses, and he has never once thought to walk down here. To be fair to him, he would not be alarmed to find out that this entire area has been fabricated using Wizard Space whilst the renovations are underway.
Harry is pissed off by the wave of emotion that flares up at seeing Malfoy again. After an agonisingly long week of the furious desire to understand the meaning behind the ingredients, he thinks the list could now be scorched into his brain for the amount he has reread it. He even had had Hermione take a thorough look, pretending that it was something he had picked up from Justin. A sort of project that he and Harry were working on together. He had felt guilty at using Justin as an excuse but the embarrassment of the truth would have been too much to bear. Predictably, she had had no clue- something which infuriated her greatly- though was preening at Harry voluntarily doing work. Ron had practically had to restrain her from running to the library to start researching. On his part, Harry had had to bite down the comment that maybe he should let her go.
“Yeah, okay. I’ll get up in a second.”
“Seems like it, yeah,” he says, shrugging off the humiliation. If Malfoy won’t comment on it, then neither will he. “Is that a problem?”
He isn’t sure how going back to the Potions lab could help him, but his intuition is leading him there, so he is following it. There isn’t much he trusts in this world, but his gut instinct is almost always right. The only advice he would take over it is Hermione’s, because he is certain that in her entire life, she is yet to be proven wrong.
CW/TW: descriptions of a near death experience, multiple mentions of suicide and PTSD/ anxiety attacks
hiii hope you enjoy this! harry and draco get their first proper interaction and we learn a little about an issue harry is struggling with
Relief floods through him when she doesn’t demand any explanations. He isn’t sure how well she would take his newfound distaste for the Ministry and their often questionable practises. The Headmistress is a progressive woman, but he doesn’t want to risk offending her. And if he were to mention his own resident phantoms, the fact that they never leave his side, tailing him at all hours of the day, she would in all likelihood refer to him to St. Mungos immediately. Auror work doesn’t sound as appealing when the possibility of crumpling to the ground at any minor sign of distress is more feasible than a smooth run of the mission.
that is, Harry has no clue. It sounds a little lower than he remembers, not so whiny. Still just as infuriating.
“Malfoy… please tell me you- that that wasn’t what happened- you didn’t,” he murmurs, unable to open his eyes now, “Did you?”
. Harry does not understand the appeal, personally, despite the fact that his
Malfoy hurries to the store cupboard, and stuffs a plethora of various ingredients into his leather satchel. His hair is ruffled and parting in waves, nothing like his usual combed style of the daytime. He pours the contents of the cauldron into an empty flask, before shoving that in his bag too. It seems to be heavy, and the glass jangles together noisily as he moves about.
“Maybe,” agrees Ron but, likewise, without much enthusiasm. There is a sudden influx of noise as a group of Ravenclaw girls arrive in a flurry. As he watches them scurry to their dorms in fits of giggles, the new sigil and tie for eighth years is glaringly obvious. He hardly notices it on himself but he finds it a little jarring on others.
Remembering something that Dean had said, Harry is curious- was Malfoy not invited to this Slytherin meeting in Dean and Seamus’ dorm room? The question gnaws at him but he knows better than to ask. He is quite fond of his head, thanks.
When she says nothing, staring at Harry from his left hand side with those insightful brown eyes, he realises both Ron and Hermione are expecting him to answer. He doesn’t know quite what to do with this information.
The next thing he recognises is an iron staircase only two metres from where he is now, leading down onto another floor below. He knows it all too well.
if Malfoy were to give up this dumb facade. But then again, thinking of the Malfoy of the common room, he is not so sure anymore.
“It could be worse,” says Ron in a kind yet unhelpful manner, his eyebrows upturned and smiling at Harry weakly.
Suddenly, something hits him on the crown of his head. He lifts his hand up to feel, but there is nothing there but his greasy hair. As confused and dazed as he is at this hour, he is certain he felt it. His fingers pat the bedsheets around him, searching in the darkness for a clue. They fall upon something small, rough and wrinkled all over, and he comes to the bemusing conclusion that it is another piece of paper.
At ten AM, Harry is alone in the dorm and he trudges out of bed. He is walking to the toilet when he identifies a strange object at the foot of Malfoy’s bed. Suspicious- this habit never truly goes away- he goes to examine it.
(See the end of the chapter for
They chat aimlessly about nothing important, and it is brilliantly mundane. Hermione explains to them the benefits of studying an Arithmancy Masters, and Harry doesn’t even have to pretend to be interested, not when her face lights up so gleefully. It would be absurd to not want to listen.
Whilst Ron and Hermione can be overly inquiring, and too bloody observant for their own goods, he knows it ultimately is just because they love him as much as he does them. And he will be damned if he lets his damaged state of mind come between that. His utter lack of energy, the fact that he can only apparently find interest in the life and actions of
Scanning his eyes for the toy, he sees nothing. He pretends to not be looking and has a crack at just casually laying in bed, until he gives up and makes a cough to grab Malfoy's attention. In the back of his mind, Cindy the spider scolds him for forgoing the decision that they had made together.
“Yeah, it’s lovely,” says Harry, and you can’t imagine how incredible it feels to actually mean what he says for once.
“Why are you looking at me like that? Enjoying the show?” he demands. Whether or not being snappy will cause his investigation into Malfoy to be sabotaged, Harry doesn’t know, but he glares back at him anyway, not in the mood to tolerate any of their habitual bullshit. His head feels like it is being pulverized in a grinder.
Malfoy coughs slightly, and whirls backwards with abruptness. His heeled boot stamps on Harry’s foot and he resists the urge to yelp.
“A dickhead,” says Harry, not bothering to beat around the bush. After all, why would he for someone who supposedly
He wonders briefly whether him and Ginny would have ever gotten married. A fleeting vision of a stately country home, blooming with flowers gifted by Arthur and Molly, Harry’s Ministry briefcase by the door where he can pick it up easily on his way out. Two, maybe three kids stampeding through the house; they are most likely ginger. Nothing seems strong enough to be able to flush the Weasley genes out, not even the infamous Potter hair. A white picket fence, all seemingly lovely. Happiness. Laughter. But, then, Harry is depressed, his flashbacks leave him screaming all through the night. Ginny is fed up- with him, with being stuck at home, with everything. She wants to fly, to tour the world with a Quidditch team and work hard but play harder. Arguments. Divorce. Tears.
You know what? Good for him. It is probably more than he accomplished his entire four months at Grimmauld Place. Other than befriending Cindy and getting himself well-acquainted with the TV, that is. Important, adult things.
He and Justin share a glance, and Justin shrugs his shoulder before exclaiming, “Crap!” as his potion begins to bubble over. Chuckling, Harry rushes to help him and, hey, if they both burnt their robes in the process, who can blame them? It is all in the name of magic.
Harry takes a moment to answer, allowing the lapse in his brain to dominate for a second, and then does no more than grunt and mutter “It’s alright. Not your fault.”
It’s to their easy bickering that Harry dozes off.
This irritates him to no extent; he wants to tear his hair out in irritation. If he has to think for one second more, he will...actually, he isn’t sure what he will do. Cry, perhaps? Now more than ever, he just wants to shut off for a while. His brain is pinching with how many thoughts and anxieties are running through his mind like it is a fucking marathon. As they go, they trample his chance of sleep into the ground with painful kicks to his head. Probably looking like a right idiot, he flicks his temple in the hope that it might trigger some sort of
When they eventually lock eyes, Harry thinks that maybe Malfoy wasn’t expecting him to ever look up. He feels a smidgen of conceit that he, for once, was able to perplex the other boy. Malfoy is fidgeting, seemingly uncomfortable all of a sudden. His fingers fiddle agitatedly with each other. Harry is sure that he is doing it subconsciously and would be mildly horrified to be seen doing something so
He slides the note in between the closed curtains, head and heart pounding as one in a way which has nothing to do with his bloodstream.
, like he wishes someone could have for him.
No such thing happens. Another inch closer.
“Morning,” he breathes deeply, “I love days like this. Just makes you feel happy.” says Justin, returning the smile. He turns away from Harry to stare satisfactorily at the gently gleaming window frame. The paint is peeling a little around the edges, a formation of petal-like curls which are aglow with sunlight.
He gathers himself, or at least attempts to, “What’s that supposed to mean?”
. When he says that, he doesn’t mean that he got a low score on a test, or felt melancholy for an evening or two. No, not anything as superficial as that. They are so painful to live through that Harry almost reaches his breaking point.
Chiming in with her informative voice in full place, Hermione answers partly for him. “It’s illegal to perform Legilimency now without consent, unless it’s in a life threatening situation, or Ministry duty. They decided that it was an invasion of privacy, and immoral. It’s about time, in my opinion.”
. As his clothes drop to the tiles, he redirects his gaze away from his body. It hurts so much he almost expects there to be bruises all up and down his skin. Just needing to assure himself that it isn’t, Harry takes a reluctant peek through his eyelids. There is nothing, as suspected, but he finds plenty of other issues with himself to compensate.
Malfoy snorts and wraps his robes tighter around himself. They seem to swallow up his skinny frame, despite his considerable height. A clasp, detailed with the Malfoy family crest in opulent  jewels of green and white, sits in the middle and ties the winter cloak together. “What a lie. You’re about as fine as Filch is attractive.”
“Ah but Harry, I think you’ve forgotten something,” she says cryptically. A joke is coming, he feels it. Whilst he can’t even really consider himself her friend, let alone someone he knows her tells, this tone of her voice- the one which poses itself exactly as if it is building up to a crescendo- gives away her punchline without her even needing to say it. He doesn’t have to be her bestest pal in the whole universe to recognise this.
“Oh yeah, very. Can’t wait.” Harry says sarcastically, “My favourite part is when they string our guts up to dry. I think my intestines will look just great around Malfoy’s bed.”
It is the weekend now, and this is always a tricky time for Harry. In theory, they should bring him freedom, a sense of relaxation and a chance to unwind. In reality, however, it is often the prime time for him to fester in a cloud of depression, for him to think about what he
“I wonder how Rosmerta is doing these days,” comments Hermione as the woman in question comes out of the kitchen and passes by their table, levitating four trays above her. “You know, apparently Malfoy wrote her an apology over the summer?”
Malfoy just hums in agreement. His pale brows are furrowed; everything about him makes Harry wish he was an artist. Never has a person looked so intriguing. Maybe he will ask Luna her thoughts, she draws and he knows she couldn’t disagree. It is an objective fact, nothing more.
He stands up, straighter and more rigid than usual. Grabbing Harry’s bicep, which sends rippling sensations out from where they make contact, Malfoy pushes him out of his medical bay. He drops Harry’s arm as soon as he deems it far enough away, and gives him a gentle shove in the chest for good measure.
Malfoy is up first, as always, and Harry won’t pretend that he isn’t watching him, as uncomfortable as that admission makes him feel. His morning routine includes, and is limited to, spending a strange amount of time in his curtain-encased bed, before travelling swiftly to the bathroom. In the distance between the two, Harry barely gets a chance to register the other boy’s appearance. He is beginning to suspect that Malfoy deliberately moves so fast in order to ensure that nobody sees him before he has donned the groomed look which materialises in the bathroom. Harry thinks that is ridiculous. As if anybody gives two fucks about Malfoy’s bed hair. The twat needs to get over himself if he thinks any of them care that much because
“Ron, you didn’t really think that the workload would be light this year, did you? It’s the last year of NEWTs!” Hermione says, exasperated.
It becomes evident that the house doesn’t care for him to feel the sunlight which is attempting to break through the thick material, so he gives up with a huff.
Coarse, craggy bark comforts him, pressing into the stinging cut on his face and bringing him back to reality. Voldemort’s voice still surrounds him, as if it were happening again, but it quiets as the minutes pass. Smells of pine waft up his nostrils, gentle. This tree suddenly feels like the most substantial thing in his life and he wishes he could stand half as sturdy. He clings, sobbing, hoping it will do more than this. Hoping it will fix him.
Out here, in the muggy and oppressive air, he finds that running away from these problems hasn’t helped. If anything, it just makes him feel cowardly, which in turns reminds him of something he has been frantically repressing ever since it happened.
be giving Malfoy his own, complimentary setting. It’s unfair, and a clear demonstration of treachery from the castle- to make Harry have abhorrent thoughts about Malfoy and his fucking bone structure. Unbelievable.
“Just gotta add in these, and then I think we leave it to brew for a bit,” says Justin, sprinkling in the Holly leaves delicately, as if he is afraid too many at once will make the whole thing explode. Seamus’ escapades have clearly left him scarred for life. “Anyway, what were you saying? Oh yeah, it’s a type of sleeping potion. For me, not anyone else. I’m not dodgy, I swear.”
Assuredly the opposite effect to what he intended, this mitigates some of Harry’s edginess. It is belittling in the most delicious way. What does it say about him, that he feels at more home with this version of Malfoy- conceited and disdainful- than the quiet and complacent one of the last few weeks? He hopes that he has said his last farewell to that boy, the one with the evermore hollowing eyes and unresponsive expressions, though he knows that this is unlikely. The rest of Hogwarts wants Malfoy to fade into oblivion, and perhaps the git even wants the same. With the way he has been acting, it is all too probable. Everyone, but Harry, it seems. There is too much he still needs to know, needs to settle.
, of all people, really want to make out with someone at the Astronomy Tower though? The place has as much history for him as it does Harry.
ALSO QUESTION: would you guys prefer if i updated less regularly (every week-two weeks) with 10k+ updates, or at least once a week with 4k/5k??? because as much as i would love to, i probably can't do chapters this length every few days, because i won't have time for literally anything else in my life. trust me, i wish i could... lemme know x
him in the back.
Perhaps, when Harry called upon the wind for help, it took Malfoy’s caution too. He blames Neville.
He sticks his tongue out experimentally at the stranger opposite him and feels peculiar as it copies his movement. Surely this shell of a man can’t be the once brave and noble Harry Potter? He snorts at the preposterous title he had been donned by the Daily Prophet, and slams the door hard on his way out.
The door swings open and Malfoy saunters out, thankfully clothed. Harry releases a breath, which he hadn’t even realised he was holding in, at the sight of him fully dressed.
Groaning, Justin yanks his duvet off of his body and steps out of bed.
He eventually falls asleep to the eerie vision of Malfoy as a ghost himself. His burn scars glint dully in the light of the lanterns, his skin like mist. Then, dream-Malfoy fades into the air, till there is nothing but the stagnant air where his soul had once been.
Could it have been self inflicted? Purposeful.
Again, nothing happens.
His head is fuzzy with the blanket of sleep still blurring his thoughts, and he rubs his eyes. He observes spots in his vision as he opens them, an almost satisfying reminder of his mortality. Sometimes he wonders if he actually exists, or if he’s just going through the motions of an imagination. Apparently, as Hermione once informed him, there are groups of Muggles who believe they live in something called a “simulation”. Honestly, Harry could believe it with ease, after everything that he has seen.
The castle is larger than life at night; his bare feet icy cold against the stone floor.
hi hi hiiiii hope you enjoyed this one, i have lots of ideas and a plot that im very excited about to write so please stick with me as it all gets established :))))) this is a SLOWBURN so if that isnt your thing im sorry to disappoint but there wont be any proper good lovey-dovey fluff times between our two idiots for a little while.... but when it comes... itll be good i promise xoxo PLEASE LEAVE COMMENTS AND KUDOS AND SHARE ANYWHERE YOU LIKE :-DDD
As he does so, a biting wind hits him and his legs wobble. He ungracefully falls back on his arse but manages to throw his hands out backwards to catch him in the nick of time. Hot in the face, he tries to recollect his dignity from shattering completely by straightening his back and clearing his throat. It only brings more attention to it.
Harry gulps, not looking up.
, he tells himself.
Harry is disgruntled. Surely he can’t be walking away from Harry now? Not after Harry has put so much on the line in revealing what he knows. It was risk, but he had assumed it would pay off.
there is no sound.
Whoever the attacker was, they aren’t in sight. This makes him even more aware of the dark, all the opportunities it would give someone to hide. Somewhere far in the distance, a branch snaps and he whirls around. Logically, he knows it could just be an animal, but the terror that has struck his body tells him otherwise.
She looks especially beautiful today, he thinks, as he registers her warm smile and eyes which twinkle brightly. Dressed in a light cotton trench coat, with a white blouse that compliments the depth of her dark skin, he wishes that he was deserving of her friendship. She reaches out a hand to him, and they are apparating to the Leaky Cauldron in a whirl of colour.
“A little,” Harry admits; Malfoy’s lips curl upwards so slightly that you could blink and miss it.
You know when you wake up, and for the tiniest fraction of time, you forget who you are? Everything is beautifully unrecognisable, and you feel for a moment what it would be like if you existed but didn’t live. There is nothing and no-one that you remember. Sometimes, Harry wakes up and he hates this feeling. It frightens him, that moment where you fall back into reality. Today, he loves it. As he comes into consciousness, he revels in blissful ignorance, and all he knows is the duvet around him. He is not someone with any burden other than that of his cotton sheets.
“Oh, really?” says Harry, unconvinced.
“You really are shit at this game, aren’t you?” Ron pokes teasingly, although it is, in all fairness, a justified point. Harry is seemingly lousy at all games, as he has come to realise over the past few days- thank you to Malfoy for calling attention to his incompetence at Exploding Snap.
this is a bit longer than usual (6k) but i have no idea why because i only managed to fit it in half of what i wanted to!!! i guess you'll just have to wait for the next update to find out how i originally planned to do this chapter ;)
“Harry, let me get this perfectly clear. What you are saying is that you saw nothing that could indicate why Mr. Malfoy is in this condition?” presses Mcgonagall. As always, she gets down to the gritty business, all the while replacing Harry’s own shoddy charmwork. He appreciates that there is no mention of his own condition.
With the gorilla sounds of Anthony’s guffaws rounding up again, Harry makes the sage decision to ignore them, and flips them off as he does so.
Now, he converses with Neville, startled to discover that he has been dating Hannah Abbott from Hufflepuff. Over on their table, she waves at them with a beaming grin and Neville blushes furiously. Harry is seriously happy for him, seeing the glee as clear as day on his round face, and promises to himself that he will make more of a conscious effort to keep up to date with his friend’s lives.
He’s so different now, Harry notes. Before the war and throughout their school years, he had walked with such confidence. Even in sixth year, a lot of the time he had swaggered about, obviously feeling a sense of self-importance, however terrified he also was. But the current Malfoy, the one who is clearly feeling the impact of the war, much to Harry’s indignation-
brooding nocturnal stroll. No one had promised him that it would be free of other people, and yet he had naively presumed it would be. Trust Malfoy to ruin that for him. He frowns and almost groans aloud before he remembers the other boy’s presence. This bloody routine that seems to be forming, the one where Harry stumbles across Malfoy- it is really screwing with his head. At this point, he isn’t sure it is even accidental anymore.
Mcgonagall whips her wand twice sharply and it spurts out a vigorous jet of silver sparks, quelling the outbreak of discussion. “By this, I mean to say that we will no longer use the house points system. Students can visit any common room they choose, given that it is in the window of your curfew, and we have renounced the use of passwords.” Harry hears raucous whooping from Ginny and he irritably remembers Luna in the Ravenclaw common room. Already, gossip flits from person to person and he feels fondness at the childlike habits that he had resigned himself to never experiencing again. The horrors that he had faced over the past few years had certainly not made it difficult to forget the simple yet rich pleasure of childhood innocence. Rather, he had lived his life in black and white, aged beyond his years. He is unaccustomed now to the vibrant colours of youth and adolescence.
The next morning, Harry wakes up and something feels different. It takes him a while to figure out what it is, this odd fluttering sensation in the pit of his belly, but he realises that it could be some semblance of happiness. He had had an enjoyable evening yesterday, even after all the events of the day. He has also had his first nightmare-free sleep in a long time, and one he begs the Gods above is not his last.
Wind blows straight at Malfoy’s face, blasting back his hair and making him look rather erratic when he snarls, “Because it’s us, Potter!”
Inside his chest, his heart beats like an offbeat drum. He doesn’t mean it really, hopes that Malfoy doesn’t hear the question in his tone.
and she is right. He has fought much worse, from people miles more ill-intending than Minerva Mcgonagall.
“Thanks, Harry,” smiles Neville, pulling off his mud-soaked gloves. “This was a massive help.”
“As I was saying, there are no other off limits sections in the castle grounds this year, but I must implore each and every one of you to be cautious of the ongoing renovations in all parts of the school,” and the hall falls, if possible, even quieter at the mention of the war.
“No, I suppose not. After all, unstable magic does indicate one’s sanity.” And since when had he become so quick-witted? Where is the spoilt and hot-tempered boy of Harry’s school years? Harry knew how to handle him. He feels at a loss with this boy, all blank eyes and flat voice, in front of him.
Harry is more than a little interested. He wonders whether Justin would judge him if he asked for some too. It wouldn’t be like him to, but Harry really doesn’t like those moments of revelation- the ones where the other person sees through your shell, directly into the place where you are most vulnerable, and realises
“I’m just tired, Potter,” he says eventually from between his knees, as if that explains everything. Somehow, it does. Harry’s chest aches with the honesty of the statement. The least he can do is return it.
“I’m not!” But as he says it, the light in the bathroom flickers madly, before turning off. The slight smell of burning that wafts through the door really doesn’t help prove his point.
There is a hush of voices as Professor Mcgonagall briskly stands up to make her speech. Harry sincerely hopes there won’t be anymore mentions of death and destruction in this year’s edition. She cuts a stern figure in her swooping Headmaster’s robes but the hint of a smile on her thin lips informs Harry of her true sentiments towards the scene before her.
“It’s fine,” Harry interrupts, studiously looking at Malfoy’s bed instead. This makes him blush even harder for some god forsaken reason and suddenly, he needs air. He feels like he can’t breathe- every inhale is too big, yet somehow still too little. “I have to go. Sorry.”
Curiously, he then grimaces, almost as if he said something he didn’t mean to. This keeps happening; he wonders, for the millionth time, why Malfoy is so reluctant to speak these days.
“Malfoy, what happened?” he asks, throwing caution to the wind for this one moment. The wind catches it, whisking it away. There is no getting that back.
right out of his brain. Well, if Harry wanted Malfoy not to switch dormitories, he certainly has fucked himself over. Doubtlessly, he will wake up tomorrow morning to the news. In the midst the moment, he didn’t even consider this consequence, taunting the other boy senselessly. In fact, Harry isn’t even sure whether he was thinking at all.
It was purely luck that Harry managed to catch Snape’s memories that night in the Shrieking Shack and he loathes to think that Dumbledore ever really had a plan that involved telling him anything remotely useful. If you are going to have to inevitably die at the hands of a genocidal lunatic, it is always a good idea to come prepared, after all.
Every student digs in at the same time and noises of delight groan in mass unison over the plates of vegetables and marinated meats which splatter the tables. Dinner is a spirited affair, debates already breaking out over house loyalties as people switch between the house tables. Harry, Ron and Hermione just continue to natter amongst themselves and with their classmates.
Harry sighs, resigned. He would have assumed that the bastard would have gone to bed by now, even in spite of the fact that he wasn’t there when he left. They must be as insane as each other, to both be out at four in the morning. He feels a bit cheated, and more than a little pissed off. This was supposed to be
“Sorry,” he says, and then he looks immediately pissed off to have apologised. All of this is gripping to Harry, whose brain still hasn’t decided whether it wants Malfoy to piss off the edge of the Earth, or whether it should attempt to try and figure him out. He concludes that there is probably a happy median, and he will find it even if it is the death of him because he can’t live in this unsure, confusing, indeterminable state of emotion.
In a panic, Harry puts his ear up against the door, but abruptly comes to understand the mistake he has made.
Unfairly, he feels a bit peeved- the words have dragged up what he is trying to bury under the hatchet. Like he has been done a grave injustice, Harry slams the book shut and shoves it back in his bag. He will read it another time. Who knows? It might not even be the same Loughfowl that Malfoy was writing about in the first place, and then he will just be wasting his own time like a fool-  precious time, which could be spent brooding in his bed instead. Important things, of course.
Cindy watches mockingly from the comfort of her silken web, loaded with no burdens but that of her next meal. Nevertheless, Harry acknowledges that he would have still probably prevailed in finding a way to make this into a difficult task, had he been born a spider. He is just complicated like that, and Mcgonagall did always say that trouble followed him like a shadow.
Once he is done, he feels marginally better, like he has purged himself of whatever sickness was inside of him. Then, he wants to shake himself, furious with his own internalised hatred.
Certainty smacks him in the head. The potion requires Pensieve memories. It is so plainly obvious, Harry feels like a dunce for not figuring it out earlier. Merlin, he always knew he wasn’t the brightest, but now he wholly understands what Hermione means when she says him and Ron weren’t “destined for Ravenclaw” in that tone of hers.
“Definitely not true, then,” he jokes, although it comes out as melancholy.
Hermione picks Harry up from Grimmauld Place a week later. He thinks that Ron might have warned her of his need for space, since he was pre-empting a much earlier visit. Either way, he is grateful for the chance to process the upcoming year. All things considered, he reckons he has been handling it pretty well, if you can exclude, well, the crying fit. And the second. And the third. Not to mention that he has been dressed in the same clothes for five consecutive days. Recovery is a work in progress, as Hermione has always said.
He may as well own it, before he gets sucked into an inevitable spiral of disgrace.
Fine. He won’t play nice, happy Hogwarts then.
The words run rampant around the empty room, hitting Harry again and again as they lap him. He can’t help but feel hurt by that. Whilst he was being arrogant beforehand, he didn’t think Malfoy would go as far as to say he would rather
Harry walks back to the dormitory with the note clutched tightly in his hand and doesn’t put it down until the next day. Malfoy thanked him, even after saying he would never do such a thing- he can’t believe it. Finally, he feels a sense of progress.
Nevertheless, fatigue hits him, his body and mind not used to this setting, and he immediately knows he needs to leave. It wouldn’t do to have the amiable acquaintance, which he has managed to form with this sweet and pretty girl in the last few minutes, destroyed by his fucking trauma, and his fucking relentless sadness.
He looks Harry up and down once, assessing him as one might do a remarkably annoying child, proceeding to walk away only when Harry stares back at him blankly. Harry panics a bit, but watches his back and counts two steps in his head.
(See the end of the chapter for
His future. It is such an unfamiliar thing, so estranged. He supposes that, in all honesty, he didn’t expect to have one up until a few months prior. And even afterwards, in the gloom of Grimmauld Place, most days he still felt like he was a second from withering away. Now, Harry isn’t yet sure whether he actually exists. How can somebody not present have a future?
Now there is nothing. And this is what signifies to Harry that Malfoy is awake on the other side of the dorm, probably eavesdropping. It makes him irritatingly self conscious of what stupid things he might have been saying.
, offers him nothing substantial. A name, it appears. Unimportant. There is a third piece too, but Harry had taken one fleeting glance at the colossal black ink blot, and understood immediately that Malfoy had scribbled it all out, rendering it useless. Subsequently, those two are a no go and are not the cause of his growing headache.
“Yeah great thanks, you?” Harry lies and produces a weak smile. Justin appears a little frightened, so he thinks it most likely did not have the desired effect of reassurance.
When Malfoy opens his eyes, there is a softness to him that Harry has never once seen before. He suddenly finds it difficult to picture Malfoy being up to any evil deeds. To put it simply, he isn’t sure there is enough fight left in the other boy.
It must be centuries before his answer comes. After all his deliberating, the only thing Malfoy says is, “Do you promise? That you won’t bother me?”
How Malfoy manages to make Harry feel twelve again is unbeknownst to him. His steps are arrogant and large and Harry tries not to show how tired he is becoming by this chase. As casually as possible, he scurries alongside the other boy; a minor slash of irritation cuts through him when he realises how much shorter he is. Great. Mentally
. Vernon screams, hurling violent offences at him in a wild frenzy of both memories, and imagination. Behind his fake laughter, as Justin’s plonks himself in Neville’s lap, chuckling gleefully all the way, Harry's mind crumples into a wasteland of shameful anguish.
“Alright, yeah. Tough luck about Malfoy, what a ponce. Tony is alright though. I think he’s left already. An early bird, that one.”
He edges towards the sheet, noting the celebratory whoops and proclamations of disappointment from girls and boys alike, who have already read the list. Blaise Zabini marches past him, dark and striking features looking distinctly pissed off. Seamus and Dean cheer and embrace in a bear hug, appearing to have been roomed together.
“I understand,” Harry smiles, “I had a similar issue in summer- unfortunately minus the boyfriend thing,” and his face flares with heat when he realises how that could be interpreted.
“Fair enough, I suppose,” Harry offers civilly. Telling of Malfoy’s dissipating anger, the wind calms down, and in its place is a fresh, clear air. It alleviates some of the tension in his head. Grudgingly, Harry is impressed. It takes a strong wizard to do wandless magic, and a stronger one at that to control the elements. He would have never said that the git would be one of them, again proving that he will always underestimate Draco Malfoy.
“Ron! Help!” says Harry with a grumble, thinking of all the looks he will get once back indoors. He doesn’t need any more attention drawn to him, and Hogwarts seems to be disturbingly bored with the lack of action in the school after such eventful years. It can be assured that a glimmering Harry Potter would not escape their notice.
Harry turns to Malfoy to ask him where he thinks Zabini is going in the dead of night, but the twat has already gone.
“Yeah. Do you know what happened?” Neville asks harmlessly, unaware that Harry’s heart beats faster at the question. He doesn’t, not really, but that hasn’t stopped him from speculating frantically. “I know I shouldn’t gossip but sometimes you just have to wonder. I hope he’s okay. It might sound a bit weird of me to say, but I do.”
satisfied and he opens his mouth to retort, but Malfoy cuts him off resolutely. “Go and bother someone else. I’m busy, Potter.”
The tension in Malfoy’s body seems to triple tenfold. If Harry didn’t know the value of those parchments already from the reckless midnight Potions trips and the unorthodox spells being practised in the witching hours, the way that Malfoy stiffens now is a dead giveaway. He stalks towards Harry with a furrow in his pale brow. Harry gulps, considering that running might be his best chance of survival. However, with the fatigue in his legs from his solo escapade around Hogwarts, he probably would only make it as far as the end of this corridor before Malfoy
Shit. Harry forgot that Hogwarts is indeed in the midst of the vast and empty Scottish Highlands- at least that is what he thinks, its unplottable nature could presumably have it anywhere and he wouldn’t know- rather than central England. It has always felt so close to him no matter where he is, which is usually in the South, trapped its rich, snobby suburbs.
“Yeah, uh, he says that they said that we are an abomination of nature, and that they wish that I had never come into their lives,” he trails off dishearteningly and both Neville and Hannah audibly gasp at this. Widened eyes, Justin hurriedly says, “They’re kind people, really. I think they’re just scared for him because they live in such a conservative town. It isn’t really safe for people like us.”
“What? No!” exclaims Harry, “Does it matter? Can’t you just answer the question?” He feels frustration climb his spine; Malfoy is finally asking for answers he himself has been seeking.
Sauntering over, Zabini seems to say something which agitates him and his face distorts into an irritated expression. His lips curl and Zabini rolls his eyes, turning to walk back in Harry’s direction. They make eye contact. Zabini’s dark stare, sweeping cheekbones and robes which sweep behind him in a manner that suggests their expense, leave Harry fidgeting. What is strange is that Harry’s feeble gaze seems to have a similar effect on the other boy. He frowns and hurries away, tripping ever so slightly. Nobody else appears to have noticed but Harry feels bizarrely perturbed at seeing the Zabini facade slip. He has to remind himself:
It is a sunny day- unexpectedly so after the cruel storm of last night. Basking in the rays, like a flower after a long spell of rain, Harry contemplates the idea of running away to a hot country and setting up residence in the countryside there. He could spend all his days like this- warming the cold inside of him, and learning to unthaw his muscles from their broken state. He imagines a stream trickling through a wide garden, whose unending trees and tweeting birds are privy to his eyes only. Perhaps he would take up gardening, or something else physical in nature that could keep his mind at rest. The appeal of it almost has him running to the nearest Floo, and Harry has to restrain himself from rushing off with great difficulty. Logically, he knows that denying the orders of both Mcgonagall and Kingsley would spell out his death sentence in big, bold, underlined letters. His stay at Hogwarts must be endured, however depressed that may make him feel.
“‘Gotcha!” says Ron with glee, taking his King after only about five minutes of playing. He could be cheating, could have even made the rules up, for all Harry knows. But for now he is content to admit failure. He can recognise a lost cause when he sees one- it has indeed become a talent of his.
Nothing happens, except from a thudding noise which ceases to exist, and Harry realises that Malfoy has stopped shaking his legs. He almost wants to stomp on Malfoy’s foot to get it to do
“Nah,” he shakes his head again, “I’m sorry to break it to you. If it helps, I think it suits you.” He erupts into laughter when Harry glares at him, harbouring a secret plan that involves a whole army of heart bubbles and Ron also getting soaked in glitter.
“They’re a plague on this neighbourhood, Petunia,” he had blustered, pink neck looking as if it was about to burst. Peering through the grate in his cupboard door, he had watched as Aunt Petunia sympathetically agreed, rubbing his back in solidarity. Harry hadn’t understood his rage at all. On the days where he was forced to do work in the front garden, he often saw the pair, hand in hand, walking along the pavement. They looked head over heels in love with each other and, every few minutes, would lean in for a soft and intimate kiss. Harry had thought that Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia could learn a lesson from this affectionate and seemingly harmless relationship. Their marriage consisted of bullying Harry and spoiling Dudley, and that was about it.
Moving through the courtyard, he waves awkwardly at the numerous people who greet him. He feels awful about it, but he swears that he has never met at least two thirds of them. Indeed, Neville, Justin and Hannah are sharing a late lunch on an old and crumbling stone bench. Justin signals for him to come over, seemingly desiring to be saved from third-wheeling. Well, never let it be said that Harry doesn’t live up to his title.
Malfoy just snorts drily, “That’s nice, Potter. I wonder who that could be.”
“If you say so, mate,” Ron shrugs and slumps down on the nearest sofa, “Maybe when the professors stop giving us so much work, we might actually have time to practise.”
He is nearing a clearing, and realises upon further inspection that it is the same one in which he found Malfoy in the middle of the night, practising his strange spell. It looks vastly different to how it did then, with the silver beams creating an oasis of light for them. Now, the place has lost any ethereal quality that the night gave it, looking like any other muddy British path. It is almost impossible to combine the two images in his mind but, if he focuses, he can almost see Malfoy’s lithe form, wand poised, in the spot he had stood in then. Some things transcend reality.
“Go back to your friends, Potter. Seriously, have you ever considered it’s time to think about doing something else with your life other than obsess over me?” snipes Malfoy. This time he expects it when Malfoy rolls his eyes back deep into his skull. The fact that he predicted the other boy's next action leaves him internally grinning, even amongst the shock waves rolling over him.
“Thank you for that, Mr Murphy,” Professor Mcgonagall says wryly and Harry now witnesses a fifth year named Olivier shrugging cheekily in response.
A middle aged witch comes in with a Kneazle perched on his shoulders. Briefly, she scans Harry and he cannot help but tense. Then, with a twinkle in her eye, she offers a small smile and sits in the booth behind Hermione and Harry. He needs to learn to trust strangers again, though it is easier said than done.
In Malfoy’s eyes, something flares; it looks frighteningly like regret.
“You’re right,” he says defeatedly, and he stands up as if he were about to leave. “I’m being ungrateful, Elliot always says I am. I must be annoying you greatly.”
He is so deeply stuck in a mine of confusion that he is no longer even sure whether he would rather Malfoy stay or go. Undeniably, Harry does seem to have a need to crack Malfoy’s aloof demeanor, for it reminds him of himself in a way- that numbness. It unsettles him out to see the same sentiment reflected in bloody Malfoy, of all people. He needs it gone- a spark of
Harry laughs in genuine disbelief, “Really? I find that hard to believe.”
sorry,” surprising him. “As your head of house, I cannot help but feel like I-” she halts and glances at Dumbledore’s message, “Like
Harry jolts at the mention of the other boy. All day he has been repressing the need to go and check on him from afar or, at the very least, ask after him. The memory of him, paler than the very ghosts that live among them and unbreathing for the most part, is a stain upon Harry. He sees it even when he closes his eyes, imprinted on his eyelids.
He doesn’t move for a split second, and neither does the boy against him. There is one tense beat- the calm before the storm. They are simply frozen where they stand. Then Malfoy ruins it by shoving him right in the chest and, though it wasn’t particularly forceful, Harry feels the pain of it throughout his body.
Seamus looks up from under Dean, shuffles a little bit so that he is sitting straighter- but other than that, makes no apparent movements to remove himself from his entangled state. He grins, face flushed red and hair askew. Dean is surprisingly bashful, for the broad and masculine guy that he is, twisting his head away from Harry. His attempts at covering up his embarrassment are futile- Harry can see the heat rushing across his dark skin. Or perhaps that is just a result of his, uh, predicament. It looks rather comfortable from where Harry is standing.
“Was it that bad for you guys too?” asks Harry, “‘Mione, your hair is mad.”
He thought that the worst of his memories came from the battle. He thought that nothing could top the bleak recognition he had felt in the face of his death- he had stood there, alone, in the Forbidden Forest, eyes still seeing the chaos and gore from the fight, ears still hearing the screams of torment. But yet again, his mind has managed to surprise him. He’s grateful, truly.
Harry thinks he has finally embraced insanity, because there’s no way that he seriously felt the pricklings of joy at these words. It’s just that the picture of Malfoy only a day ago, defeated on the floor as he just described, versus the incensed and steaming boy in front of him is too much of a delightful contrast to feel anything but respite.
It is when Seamus moans, lightly but erotically enough that Harry begins to squirm, that he indicates his presence with a choked cough.
“Basically, they still haven’t been identified,” says Ron. “For some bloody reason, nobody seems to be able to give a proper description of their faces. Or at least not one that has led them to them. Nobody is coming forward with names, either.”
Feeling oddly nostalgic for nothing specific, he considers again the word memory. He reckons that Hogwarts has a lot of that. But what could it mean for Malfoy’s potion? Perhaps that he must recall an emotional moment in his past, as one must do to produce a Patronus?
Finally, heart hammering, he lifts his eyeline to meet Malfoy’s. Forget everything he has ever said- this wins first place by a landslide for the most difficult moment of his life. The weight of his head on his neck is heavier than a heart soaked in guilt.
Harry takes one final glance at the Astronomy Tower, remembering how vindicated he had felt seeing Malfoy’s trembling figure above him, wand raised at the man who offered him a chance, and decides for the final time he has no choice. It could be dangerous. There will be no more deliberating. He is formally investigating Draco Malfoy on the grounds of extremely dubious behaviour.
Malfoy’s eyes widen. He supposes the question doesn't particularly fall in line with their usual tone of conversation. But neither does Harry’s presence here, so perhaps all rules have been hurled out of the window.
“Malfoy?” Harry questions, the lack of response irritating him. For some reason, at his voice, Malfoy’s head snaps up.
Visions of the last few weeks: a sallow expression, words, clipped and unimpassioned. The way that Malfoy never seems to let himself feel- never laughs, never loves, rarely even hates. Only when Harry forced him to. How he refused to follow up any leads that involved his attackers, didn’t seem to care. The brewing of a Potion suspiciously similar to the Draught of Living Death. Maybe Harry had been wrong all along; there was no mystery, only another war-trodden boy with a blue heart and his own closetful of ghosts.
. “Forgive me, Potter, for being so bold, but I am curious. Is there any particular reason that you no longer have your eyes set on being an Auror?”
The last part hits him where he is vulnerable. Harry is constantly lying- to himself, to his friends, to Malfoy, and he doesn’t even know how it happens, or when. It just does, and he is the saboteur in this shitty cycle.
The confusion of it all- these terrifyingly unnerving emotions- could be the thing to finally crush him, if he lets it.
In a disconcerting twist of events, Malfoy is the only other person that confuses Harry as much as he does himself. It all used to be so simple.
“Did he? I’m surprised his conscience stretches that far. How did you hear about that, then?” he asks, as nonchalantly as possible.
again. Anything to end this awkward fucking exchange, that could have been completely avoided had it not been for Harry’s idiocy. Shit.
“Potter, I have no clue what you’re talking about,” he says in that posh drawl of his, looking straight past Harry rather than in his eyes. Harry realises he hasn’t heard his voice up until now, and it ignites something inside of him.
“I think I’m gonna have to leave now. I was only sitting here for a few, but it was nice to meet you and thank you for the daisies.” he turns to leave and she grabs his ankle, dragging her body through the thick grass as she does so.
“I am perfectly content,” says Malfoy with furor. His hair is tousled once again, thank Merlin.
“Not sure yet,” Harry lies and tries for humour, “Nostalgia?”
Alas, better safe than sorry. He forgets the Astronomy Tower momentarily, it could cost him his life.
Harry is disconcerted by how eerily similar the author’s words are to what he was thinking in Mcgonagall’s office earlier. If this is the universe’s way of telling him to get a grip, he doesn’t find it very funny. He frowns and thumbs the thin paper, contemplating saving this research for later. The words ring in his head. Triggering another premature midlife crisis is the last thing he wants to do at this moment in time.
no, his feelings towards the twat don’t extend to violence. Not anymore, at least. Even just imagining it, he grows nauseous- it hits far too close to the memory of sixth year Malfoy lying in a river of his own blood, as Harry bends over him, wand shaking in his unsteady grasp. No, never again. But the expression Malfoy is pulling now- one of miserable resignation- is what Harry witnessed only the other day. Malfoy curled tightly on the floor, surrounded by his school work, right before it got kicked away by the boot of the bullies.
hi hope you enjoy this!!!!!!!!!! xxxxx
“What! Really?” she huffs in amusement, “Harry, you really are a bit of a mystery, aren’t you?” And Harry finds that this makes him sound a whole lot more interesting than he actually is. Yeah, he killed a dark wizard. Big deal. He spent the entire time moping about it, and getting unnecessarily angry. Still does- even. In that respect, nothing has changed at all.There is not a single thing mysterious about him.
casual, he is sure of it. Despite the fact that he, of course, got the impression, when he last visited their most cosy and
Accidentally, he stumbles right into the Fat Friar when turning a sharp corner, and he spends the rest of the journey feeling like he just came from a snowstorm. The sensation is extremely unpleasant, and he finds himself shivering at every opportunity when he remembers hitting that large, cold belly.
However, he soon gleefully realises that there is a new, graceful handwriting on the other side. Malfoy has written him a note back.
“Harry, you do know what happens when a wizard loses or breaks their original wand, right?” she sniffs, glancing in at the small queue of customers waiting, “Because I would hope that you would recognise how horrible of a situation it is.”
“Alright then,” she says, conveying him her confusion. To her, the idea of simply just staying by the door in this haven of fiction and history, must be bewildering. “I’ll only be a few minutes, but don’t get too bored. Go and find Ron if you need to.” Then, she runs off into the horizon of the store and disappears from Harry’s vision.
There is little warning before Harry encounters the next shock of the day. All he sees is the light come to a standstill as they approach a clearing, which he quickly realises is not as foreign as he originally thought, and
Upon observation, he snorts, unable to contain his laughter. Malfoy has a soft toy. A dragon. It’s small, perhaps he thought nobody would have seen it, but it’s emerald scales have betrayed it’s master in their vibrancy. Under his amusement, he is relatively perplexed. Why the fuck does
with- him.
It's not Ron.
Daring a fleeting glance at the Slytherin table, Harry is met with nothing but the curious eyes of the first years and he whips his head back before anyone can question his actions. Ginny hits the back of his head with a piece of toast and he realises that he has been spotted.
At the call of his name, Malfoy’s figure pauses. On the crown of his head, that divergent lock of hair still pokes out rebelliously and Harry is bothered by it. Without turning around, he calls back, sounding like he couldn’t be less interested in what Harry has to say.
, Harry means talking. A direct contrast to the last fifteen minutes, Malfoy seems to decide that he has had enough of Harry’s company and scrambles to his feet. So jarring is the manner in which he does it, Harry begins to question whether he just made this whole exchange up. Malfoy straightens himself out and is striding towards the stairs when Harry calls out, unable to let this last point in his mind go.
“That’s true,” agrees Harry.
Without the iron glower on him, he finds he can breathe-
If only he weren’t a coward, then he would endeavour to talk to them about it all. But that’s a different life, and a different boy. He’s just Harry, who got lucky, and wishes that he hadn’t.
“Of course. I’m so sorry I ever forgot, oh wise one,” he says drily and she giggles, “Where abouts are you?”
On his way back to his dormitory, he spots Luna and Ginny heading up to the tower, giggling and intertwined in more ways than one. He groans, fed-up by this point and runs quicker. Crossing his fingers, he sends several prayers to the Fates that they hadn’t spotted him leaving it. Merlin, he would never hear the end of it from Ginny if she thought he was seeing someone. He repeats the action for good measure.
“You’ve said that already, you imbecile,” says Malfoy, pushing forcibly to walk past Harry. Try as he might, he finds himself blocked by Harry’s insistent figure. “How many times do I have to tell you to leave me alone before you actually start doing so?”
“That would be a sight to behold,” Harry laughs at the image, and Hermione chuckles with him, “Maybe it would, uh, bring out your bone structure?”
Observing the grounds, he feels disheartened. All around him are people doing what he cannot. There is a gift exchange in the distance, he sees someone’s boyfriend send up a flurry of shimmering pink bubbles in the shape of hearts into the air and a squeal of delight before the pair begin to kiss, embracing each other like it is their last breath. It must be their anniversary. On his other side, there is a group of first years playing tag. They have muddy knees and he can imagine the scolding they will get from their Professors as clear as day. One girl runs particularly hard, her feet hitting the ground like she is fighting it, and manages to tackle her friend, screaming “You’re it!” in peals of laughter. Rolling around in the earth, they get wonderfully dirty before collapsing in wheezes.
They get their robes measured, Harry still feeling the immature embarrassment that comes with the combination of an old witch’s hands, and his body. That never quite goes away.
He stands back, giving Ron and Hermione a moment together, and also himself some distance from the sheer number of books. They make him feel guilty as he thinks of his distinct lack of homework with shame, and he tries to recount his own. After a quick scour of his memory, Harry concludes that it is extremely likely that he has only completed one set piece as of yet.
Malfoy sighs, the life gone out of him. It is a horribly familiar sight.
“Hey, did you hear about what happened with those two blokes who beat up Malfoy?” Ron suddenly asks, and Harry groans internally. So much for not thinking of Malfoy tonight.
find himself getting punched. Then, he moves a fraction too much and it exposes his left forearm. The burn scars loom more ominous than the last time Harry saw them- the moon makes Malfoy even paler and they starkly contrast.
And he does.
After looking him up once and down with half narrowed eyes, Hermione turns back to chatting with Ron. His eyes practically sparkle as she pecks him on the lips just once, flushing all the while. Suddenly, a sprinkle of something white and glistening falls into Harry’s tomato soup. He looks up, confused, and sees that above Ron’s mop of ginger hair, is his own personal snow cloud. Giggling, Hermione scoops a handful and blows it into his face. A twinge of loneliness twists in Harry’s stomach at the gentle display.
For his own sake, he should also drop this whole parchment thing. It is probably just a shopping list or notes for his new novel
And then Malfoy just had to come into that Potions lab, disturbing the small level of peace that Harry had managed to build with Justin.
“One day, Ron. One day,” he warns.
“Hey, ‘Mione,” Ron reaches over Harry to poke at her with a wide cheesing grin plastered across his freckled visage, “You’ve got something on your face.”
He slumps against the railing, succumbing to the cold in the space where the warmth of a body had once been.
-------
When Harry sneaks into the Hospital Wing after everyone has gone to bed, he realises it could be, and probably is, his most illogical idea yet. Without a doubt, Malfoy will smirk, as if to drawl
Finally, it is just about legible and his hands are still enough to discern the scrawl of his name. He scans the paper frantically, eyes scouring the blotted ink letters, with feverish urgency. He just needs to know now. Someone, some
It’s only the second night back at Hogwarts, Harry contemplates, but it feels like he has been here for years already. Preparing for bed is a little easier tonight, now that he has befriended Justin. They brush their teeth together in the bathroom, Justin admitting that he also prefers the Muggle way due to his heritage. There is an unsual moment when Justin compliments Harry's hair, leaving him flushing scarlet. “I’ve always thought that it looks quite artfully messy,” he says, looking at Harry with a sparkle in his eyes. The effect is ruined when Harry hears Malfoy snort at the comment as if it were the most ridiculous thing he has ever heard, walking past them to get something out of the cupboard.
He looks different today, put together, and even more angular than usual. Sharp, as if he could cut Harry in two, maybe more, with just a glance. Dressed from head to toe in black, his pale skin and snowy hair stand out as starkly as the moon does in the sky. What ruins the effect is the swollen black eye, and the dark splatter of bruises which lead a trail down his cheek and neck, before disappearing beneath his high collar.
One of his biggest fears is losing Ron and Hermione. If they were to be taken away from him, a colossal part of him would go too. It is essential that he doesn’t fuck up this one
About to leave, allowing himself a smidgen of disappointment, Harry turns away. However, the tinkle that he had thought he heard earlier rings louder, alarmingly so. It almost sounds... panicked? His eyes seek out the silver light and find it vibrating in the air. Sucking in a deep breath, he moves a step closer. The ball seems to take this as a sign and glows brighter still, and then zooms away around a nearby blackberry bush. Some peculiar force tells Harry to follow, and follow he does.
Huffing and deflated from the rebuttal of his innovative suggestion, Ron slouches back and shrugs his shoulders. “I guess you’ll just have to be glittery until you use the showers then.” And this triggers something in Harry’s memory.
(See the end of the chapter for
Embarrassed but determined not to show it, Harry bites back, “Only as much as you’ve been stalking me.” It doesn’t sting as much as he would have wished, mostly because he knows it’s a lie. For the majority, Malfoy has instead actively been avoiding him.
A sip of his Butterbeer warms Harry’s insides, and alleviates some of the tight feeling in his stomach. Most of the time he doesn’t even realise it is there until it is gone. He supposes he is used to living with some type or pain, remembering Voldemort whispering in his head and the slow but steady poison that was wearing the locket. How depressing. He takes a second glug and the taste helps wash it away.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sneaking into the Hospital Wing the same way he did before, he prepares himself for backlash. He took it earlier, he can take it again. There are too many rogue thoughts buzzing around in his head for him to not vocalise a few of them. Besides, this worked for them last time, in that after the notes came a week-long era of peace.
“Right, I’m off to breakfast. Meeting Hannah and Neville, I think,” grins Justin, “wish me luck in being the third-wheel.” he departs, putting on his tie hurriedly and both he and Harry are stunned by it’s sudden alterations. Instead of being striped in the individual house colours, their ties are now transformed into a light orange, with a brown bear in the centre of the Hogwarts crest. It looks out of place, surreal, and something flips in Harry’s stomach at the solidity of his house being abandoned.
Harry expects him to demand why he is here, the reason for his bizarre company in the dark shades of night, why he felt the need to sneak in like some lewd fifth year visiting his girlfriend. If it were him in Malfoy’s position, he would doubtlessly be perturbed by his inexplicable behaviour. But Malfoy says nothing. Just blinks, breathes, shuffles.
“You could be right, Harry, but I don’t think things will ever be the same between us again,” says Justin morosely.
He hurries forwards, hand already reaching for the length of his wand. The thought that someone could be delivering their twisted version of justice, that he is too late and another life is lost, makes him move frantically. In all his haste, he trips over the small bump that separates the room from the corridor, and the door swings open as he stumbles onto it.
“Oh?” he says, trying to seem unbothered. From the way Neville nods enthusiastically, attempting encouragement, he isn’t sure it is working. Indeed, when he thinks on it, he is unsure as to why Neville thought it so necessary to tell
This is not unlike Hogwarts. He has come to recognise the castle as its own entity, regardless of the students inside. The sense of independence is something you have to respect and not fear.
The lanterns flicker in the dim light of the library, casting shadows upon the walls of books. It is pretty empty now, being a Sunday evening, just a few stray study-fanatics dotted around. This is fortunate for him, considering that he is covered head to toe in glitter. On the way over, he steadfastly refused to meet people’s gaze and Ron had tried his hardest to assure Harry that nobody was looking. Ron is not a good liar.
“It has been a difficult year, as we all know, and the hardships that we have all faced should bound us tighter than ever. Inter-house unity has never been so important in creating a more peaceful and accepting society. Let it be known that Hogwarts will not tolerate any prejudice towards any students, and this includes towards the members of Slytherin House,” Harry glances over at Malfoy, who is trying to seem disinterested at the speech as he stares at the ceiling. The fact that he is picking at his nails gives him away.
He feels a bit lost now, unsure whether to try and go back to sleep or not. Of course, it would be to no avail, but it is that effort that counts, right? He has lessons in the morning. With his Defence class at eight-thirty, it would probably be a smart idea to at least attempt a nap. But as Harry walks back into the room and spies Malfoy’s empty bed, sheets eerily untouched and gleaming in the moonlight, he recognises a lost cause immediately. Frankly, he cannot be bothered with the struggle of it.
Harry feels a rush of panic? In love with his ex? Was he ever even in love with Ginny? He doesn’t even know why he is contemplating this stranger’s words but somehow, they unsettle him. He frowns at her.
He clasps it in his fingers in disbelief, unsure whether he is dreaming. A flick to his arm isn’t helpful- since he is in a numb state tonight, he wouldn’t be able to feel anything anyway. When Anthony lets out gargantuan snore, he realises that this is indeed reality.
Too quickly, they come to an end.
Bodies congregate the area surrounding the posted information, swarming and cramming each other in attempts to see it first. An elbows flies in his direction and almost jabs him in the eye; probably would have, had he not developed a Seeker's instinct from playing the position for six years straight.
With Sirius in mind and once he collects himself, he glances sorrowfully around at the room that had once belonged to his godfather. He had kept up the posters of the comically large-breasted women, despite their ludicrosity, as a nod to Sirius’ hatred of the house, and to all the rebellious attitudes he adopted whilst trapped within its walls. Somehow, it eases his occasional guilt when he remembers that he has taken up residence in a place that Sirius would have seen razed to the ground given the opportunity. He’s the sole leader of the revolt now; he would be betraying the cause in taking them down.
“I hope you are all well on this pleasant night, and I trust that you have all had a safe journey here.” says Mcgonagall warmly, clasping her hands together, “There is not much to say tonight other than I wish you all a happy and studious year here at Hogwarts. Alas, there are a few important notes that I would like to touch on before we feast.”
- seems quiet and unassuming, even if he is still a pompous twat. His lean frame shuffles onto the end of the eighth year bench and Harry can just about see him reach out for a bread roll from where he is in the middle. The people around Malfoy lean away as he nibbles the roll, and Harry cannot make sense of the small flare of anger that sparks up at that.
Then his lungs fill with lead when Malfoy opens them again, and says directly at him, unforgiving in his glare, “It hurt a lot. So much so that I thought I was dying. Does that make you feel any better? Now that you know I was punished for my crimes in some way.”
Malfoy is alone. To his confusion, he is relieved. And surprised- though he shouldn’t be, considering alone is the boy’s usual state.
“Thanks.” Harry scrunches his face tightly as the pounding headache grows.
Although, secretly, he deflates a bit inside. He had been getting his hopes up, however stupid that may be.
“It’s quite windy up here,” he says, hoping Malfoy might provide an explanation but not feeling like demanding it. A violent gust makes his robes billow outwards, and he wobbles. Still quite unsure whether Malfoy will bite his head off, he tests the waters by moving to sit down opposite. There is no reaction, so he deems it safe and plonks himself down ungracefully.
He gets up, too fast at first. His hands grabble for the railing. From beside him, Malfoy regards the scenery. Ten minutes ago, it was beautiful, but now Harry has had enough.
“Harry! Answer it! The ringing doesn’t last forever!” Justin says sharply, shoving away the image of Malfoy listening in to some deep cavern at the back of his mind. His arms flail wildly in an exasperated manner like he thinks Harry is mentally deficient.
Touched by the genuine care and compassion in his tone, Harry smiles in response. He won’t give any of the minor information he has away, regardless, but it is a welcome sight to hear someone treat the other boy with humility.
Something stops him. He lets the question hang there instead, praying to whatever God is listening. And hang it does- for a bit too long, if you ask him.
Malfoy is in there, sitting at the desk by himself, and Harry inhales sharply at the image. In all the darkness, you probably wouldn’t be able to see him had he not been born with the same pallor as a ghost, and hair to match. What makes him the most startled is that Malfoy is wearing his glasses, and has his robes shucked off. They make him look so very different- much more approachable, the roundness of the frames softening the harshness of his facial structure- and they keep slipping down his nose. The perspiration in the room is making Malfoy’s shirt stick to his back, and Harry can see his backbones poking through the thin material like they are about to rip through.
It leads him around several trees, bushes, before Harry begins to wonder what he is doing. For somebody who has lived in the magical world for years, he is secretly still sometimes a little skeptical. Whether it is the magic itself or just his general distrust of his own brain is debatable. Whilst he had followed Snape’s Patronus back in the war, that was a legible thing, an obvious and undeniable piece of magic. A minute light ball, however, which could just as easily be a trick of his tired and anxious mind? He is not so sure.
It seems to get darker still, the horizon shrouded in shadow.
Suddenly, a ball of light grabs his attention. It travels through the air until it halts, hovering directly in front of him and beckoning him to come closer. It is curious, appearing to have come from nowhere, and looking suspiciously like the same light Harry had seen the first time he was here. Certainly, it has an uncanny resemblance.
Although, even as he thinks that, he distinguishes a feeling in his gut that says it isn't what he wants, or can do. Vastly losing every bit of the faint grip he has left on himself, Harry cannot fathom up a single logistical reason for Malfoy to not move. It would make sense. In theory, his transfer would be the best thing for them all. But his gut says
“Voldy has nothing on me, mate. Not when it comes to Chess,” says Ron. One of the things Harry appreciates most about his company is his understanding of Harry’s jokes, and how he takes what is uncomfortable to most in his stride.
It’s strange that he finds now that the pain comes from losing her as a friend, rather than from a lack of romance with her. They were never particularly skilled with that side of things anyway. Unluckily for Ginny, his experience with Cho did not seem to gain him any points in the kissing department and he was painfully aware that the whole time with Ginny, he was kissing like a child eating their vegetables, unwillingly, stiffly and with an air of ‘Can I go now?’. Looking back, it really is not surprising that their relationship came to an end. He’s certain that Dean, with his easy looks and built muscles, which Harry sometimes guiltily caught himself staring at as he sauntered past in his low-slung tracksuits, snogs like he was born for it.
“I guess I must’ve been walking too fast then,” he says. Malfoy narrows his eyes. “So sorry,” Harry finishes drily. He hopes the git picked up on the part of that sentence where he isn’t actually sorry in the slightest. From the unamused downturn of the other boy’s lips, Harry assumes he did.
This wasn’t the plan for this year. On the one hand, he didn’t particularly have one, other than try not to get yourself mixed up with another near-death experience lest you die anyway from the stress. On the other, he is rather peeved off that his mind has taken him on yet another rollercoaster. He did not expect to be so thrown off course by his own emotions, and he is someone who is used to that. This isn’t just a little crack in the course, like when he starts his days with a smile and ends them with a frown. No, it is as if someone has come and pulled the lever and now Harry is hurtling down a track with no brake to stop him and with no awareness of how it happened.
His chest aches. The clouds finally begin to part, only to reveal another grey sky underneath. He pushes his thoughts back down to where they came from, locks them away in the same chest he has everything else sealed in. Running away with wild conspiracies will lead you on a road which never ends if you’re too rash with it. It still wouldn’t be able explain the attack outside of the Defence classroom, or the spells Malfoy has been practising. There must be more.
Or maybe people are finally convinced of the raw truth: Harry Potter has lost the plot.
Proving himself a real pain in the arse, and Harry wrong, Malfoy starts striding down the corridor without so much as a pity glance in Harry’s direction. This won’t do. He is determined to get something out of this- at least some sort of justification for being suspicious. Otherwise, he will just feel like a twat. More so than usual, that is.
“Sorry, Harry. Ronald is just being a brute, as usual,” Hermione says but smiles amusedly as a peace offering. The Hippogriff-shaped light twinkles above her, gliding over their heads gracefully. He hadn’t realised at first, but they sometimes move in accordance to the mood of the room. Tonight the lights all seem to be glowing a tender gold, and they slowly sail above them with ease. Over Susan Bones’ ginger head, the Unicorn neighs and gallops in circles as she throws her head back in laughter.
Upon arrival, Harry squeezes Hermione’s fingers, seeking comfort. Every head in the pub twists to stare at Harry, gawking and judging like tourists at a zoo, who are trying to gage how to react to a particularly dangerous snake. Frankly, he’s a little surprised. Not to sound self-centred, but he had anticipated a screeching mass of both reporters, fans, and fundamentally anyone with a desire to use his fame for themselves. Instead, there is an awkward scrape of a chair in the silence, and slowly everyone begins to return to their conversation.
His round cheeks, flushed with innocence, have clearly not yet seen the fumbling first use of a razor. Harry cannot believe that a child this bloody young can be so desensitised to the question, as if it is an everyday occurrence and not some freakish defiance of nature which still keeps Harry up at night.
“There.” she grins widely, all-teeth and eyes glinting, “Ahhh, perfect. As pretty as a picture, Harry.” he flutters his eyelashes stupidly, feeling simultaneously more light and free than ever, the weight that comes with being a wizard lifted from his chest for the time being.
“But isn’t that a good thing?” he can practically hear Justin say. He doesn’t know what to tell imaginary Justin.
Wizards don’t use bathrooms often, he has noticed, and it rattles him. Ron says that he actively showers about once a month, and uses cleaning charms on every other occasion. Whilst Harry understands the level of practicality, he cannot help but feel disgusted. Call him old-fashioned,  call him a Muggle, but Harry would like to stick to a good ol’ plumping system, thank you very much. Cleaning charms always leave him feeling a little too squeaky; he is a fan of the insignificant, little facts of life, like allowing your hair to be dried naturally, or clipping your toenails just that slightest bit too jaggedly. These things are small, but usually manageable for him to comprehend. Which means a lot.
And then, miraculously, he breathes.
When coming back to Hogwarts, Harry had made a promise to himself and to Cindy the spider that he would ignore Malfoy. Unexpectedly, Malfoy then turned that on its head by being so bloody distant. Chiming in with his happy eyes and boisterous beard, Hagrid had then advised him to treat him as a stranger. Harry had liked that. It was a nice sentiment. Helpful, in theory.
He bunked all of his lessons today, choosing to spend the day in the greenhouses. Neville needed help with a personal Herbology assignment, which he is hoping will push him over the edge just enough to get him accepted to an esteemed degree course in Wales. Harry seeks him out for his reliable, hands- on attitude.
“Then why are you being such a prick about it?” says Harry bluntly.
Alas, Vernon’s insults prevailed and Harry had grown confused, and even a little scared, at the way that they made his stomach turn. Once, as he was on route to visit Mrs Figg, he had encountered a boy, a few years above Harry at his school, shirtless and lifting some boxes on his front lawn. He had just moved in, and it was a sweltering hot day. Harry’s heart had sped up in time with the bead of sweat that was dripping down the boy’s forehead. Conflict and fear had risen inside him, and he had sprinted off just as the boy had been about to greet him. Harry had vowed to never walk on that side of the road again and learnt, in obedience to his inner voice, which mocked him in a tone that sounded eerily like Uncle Vernon, the art of suppressing desire. The day that he first wanked over a girl, he had been hit by relief like a smack of fresh air-
“You get tonight at a push.” and she nuzzles into the crook of his arm, wound around her. Seeing their love for each other loosens the knot inside of Harry a little, but an ache of loneliness chimes up in replacement.
Some of the ingredients spark a memory in his brain- Snape’s nasal voice coming in flashes- but his exhausted self can hardly stretch his brain back to his near-fight with Malfoy this afternoon. Asking himself to recall Hogwarts Potions lessons from years long gone is a step too far into the past. For now, he needs to focus on the present, and the messy scrawl of words that are directly in his grip, yet somehow so out of reach.
“Hey!” shouts Justin and Harry swats at him. This boy is a pest, he swears. Their friendship is cancelled, over, called off- whatever you want to say.
In a rush of impatience, Harry snatches it and it tears right down the middle, obscuring a large number of the names. Fingers mildly shaking, he tries to hold it together. The sense of foreboding is tearing up his insides, a million jagged shards which cut him like glass as he breathes.
Harry thinks she had the right idea; he imagines slapping his past self, the twat, for even considering coming to this cursed castle. Look where it has gotten him.
Unable to contain it any longer, Harry yields to the belly laughter that has been brewing in him ever since they caught sight of Ron, and Hermione joins in, falling into his side.
Whipping out the Invisibility Cloak just before he reaches the door, he steels himself for what lies beyond it. He pushes it open, not ready but acknowledging that he likely never will be.
Collecting the map from where it was, tucked under his broomstick, Harry imagines himself flicking away these pesky thoughts. Logic has never been his friend. He doesn’t care for it.
“What do you mean? What did they say?” asks Neville. During the course of the discussion, Harry’s mind desperately tries to fill in the missing gaps. He tries, and fails.
- is in imminent peril, Harry backs towards the door, but is stopped by Justin’s clammy hand. He shakes his head, a plea in his face asking for Harry to stay. Hence, he sits down on his own bed and slips his shoes off.
Harry’s eyes widen and he prays that that isn’t why Malfoy is there. Could it be that the reason Malfoy hasn’t returned to their dormitory is because he has found romance? The thought makes him sick and he resolutely decides it is his duty to tell them to piss off, if this is the case. Would
Something occurs to him. “What has Malfoy said in all this? Surely he knows them or at least has a clearer memory?”
And as he reads it again, he thinks that your average potion would hardly require Phoenix ashes. He doesn’t even want to touch upon the elusive ‘memories’ part of the recipe, not with his head splitting open and his body wrecked with fatigue. Maybe tomorrow.
It’s a horrific sentiment, Harry wants to block his ears and never hear of such things again. “No,” he mumbles, his stomach lurching.
“Hermione!” he yelps, and she cackles, doubling over. Ron shoves his hat back on, as if it is his protective helmet.
“Do you hear that, Harry?” says Justin but Harry isn’t listening, not anymore. Some part of his brain, the bit which cares about his social life- his friends, his reputation- shuts off.
To Harry’s dismay, the moment is broken when the door creaks open, revealing Malfoy. His face blanches at the sight of them, and he doesn’t move for a moment.
They all share a quiet snicker at the idea. The level of toxicity currently residing in Harry’s socks is probably more dangerous than Voldemort himself.
thing in his life.
At the mention of Malfoy’s name, Harry’s ears prick up. As anticipated, he hasn’t seen him since their last incident. He has had more run-ins with bloody Peeves, for Merlin’s sake. The ponce is more of a phantom than any of the Hogwarts resident ghosts. By now, Harry assumes that he has formally moved dorm rooms, but Malfoy hasn’t been back to collect any of his belongings, which throws Harry off. The glasses case is still there.
His angular nose scrunches with temper. The air grows denser, but it is different to when he was in the dorm room.
He glances at Malfoy’s bed, but the curtains are drawn shut and give nothing away. This time it reads:
Malfoy nods, and they turn their back on the view in sync.
His cowardice is becoming increasingly clear, but there is not enough shame in the world to spur him to action. Instead, he will just focus on his routines. He will go on walks. Yes, go on walks, maybe visit Hagrid, be subjected to listening to Ron and Hermione’s loving bickering like the proper third-wheel that he is. And he will do the mandatory things too, as unbearable as they are. He will eat three meals, leave the bed even when he doesn’t have to, get a good night's sleep,
“Why do you say that?” asks Harry, undeniably curious.
It’s about to happen, and Harry would have probably let it, if it weren’t for his sudden moment of realisation. He lurches back and Justin falters, hand hovering from where Harry’s neck had ripped out of it. A wave of nausea washes through him and he walks backwards into his chest of drawers. His mind is spinning and he is confused- so extremely confused. Justin is a man. That is not him.
The expression on Malfoy’s face confirms his disregard for Harry’s eloquence.
He startles upon his entrance to the common room, encountering a shocking sight. Dean and Seamus are heatedly making out on the sofa, entwined in each other’s grasp and clearly assuming that they are alone. Harry is confused. He thought that they were both straight. Up until recently, he had even thought that Ginny had been going out with Dean. All pointers say otherwise now, as Dean moves his hand up Seamus’ shirt and begins to lean over him, pinning him to the cushions. The room is silent other than the obscene noises of skin against skin, and lips against lips.
At that, Malfoy snorts involuntarily and then tries to redeem himself by playing it off like more of a scoff. It doesn’t work. He ducks his head and Harry sort of feels bad for embarrassing him.
“Malfoy? Can we help you?” says Justin.
It happens now. Mcgonagall narrows her eyes, and the slight raise in her eyebrows tells Harry she doesn’t deem his display particularly impressive.
With a level of kindheartedness that must be superhuman, considering that Malfoy is all kinds of aggravating, Justin has been consistently patient with the twat. Most mornings he even bothers to wish him a good day, which usually goes unanswered, apart from one anomaly. Malfoy’s face had scrunched up and, looking like it physically pained him, muttered a quiet “You too,” before his skinny legs had scurried him away.
, he has to remind himself again, but the memory of Hermione’s words fall upon deaf ears.
That isn’t to say that Harry likes it. In fact, he would go as far as saying that he actively dislikes the jarring half-peace that has plonked itself in the hard-edged space of their fading rivalry. It is nonsensical; he is certain that even the most genius of people would be rightfully baffled by his reaction. But, funnily enough, it doesn’t shock him anymore, this adversity to letting go of a relationship to Malfoy, no matter how fraught with resentment it was. It isn’t that he enjoys the fighting and the animosity. No, that weighs him down, makes him feel like he is going backwards. Back to the war, back to being so wildly angry, back to fear, and running, and real, terrifying danger. But it still assuredly feels more natural, more normal than this odd, unsettling truce. The change is truly the most frightening thing.
Malfoy huffs in amusement. The response is hardly anything, but it is human, and he hadn’t realised how much he thought of the other boy as a robot until now. It is oddly comforting.
Then Harry’s suspicions about how deathly his stares are are confirmed when Malfoy looks at him, an unbothered, unfeeling mask on his face which Harry just wants to tear away in frustration, and his insides freeze. Malfoy’s right eye twitches a little, and he blinks slowly, before turning away. He gathers his books from his desk and leaves the room swiftly, not caring to say farewell to any of them.
