“Pain play, impact play.” Another surprised eyebrow-raise at his answer. Harry’s questioning look is met with another question. “Hair-pulling?”
“Not… Not your fault.” came Harry’s dazed reply.
He got hard, thinking about the way Blaise had ground against him on the couch and he gave in and reached inside his boxers, closing his hand around his cock.
"I do, in fact. Although I mostly keep it in my room." Draco noted with interest, that Blaise looked a tad flustered at the confirmation.
He grabbed his stuff and headed towards his room, nodding to Blaise in passing, who lay on one of the sofas with his feet on Neville Longbottom’s lap.
It had surprised him how similar muggle baking was to potions and while he was allowed to do magic again, he kept his baking mostly muggle, only some time sensitive situations were aided by magic. He was —  after all —  the only employee.
“So why exactly are you out without a jacket?” Harry asked, desperate to fill the silence left after the initial apology had been given. They sat in the living room, the kitchen had been too small for the two of them.
“For one, we are from all the houses and choosing one would be weird. Plus we can’t guarantee that there won’t be any minors present and I would rather not have alcohol around the younger years.”
Harry feels his cheeks heat up, feeling as though Chris had caught him staring at the retreating blond. “Uhm… yeah. We went to school together.”
When Harry started to drift awake, warmth greeted him, and it felt good enough that he simply snuggled deeper into his blankets, wanting to sleep for a few minutes more. As he drifted back to sleep, he imagined strong arms closing tighter around him, and he felt content.
Pansy took his hands and looked him in the eyes, “At least come to the meals, please!” she pleaded.
Harry got up and asked for the bathroom, following where Draco pointed. When Harry came back into the bedroom Draco was finally fully awake.
Suddenly he was falling and then there was cold, hard wood beneath him and Harry realised that he must have fallen off the bed. With a groan he heaved himself from the floor, watching as Malfoy hurried into their en-suite.
“I love you. See you Thursday.” he murmured before pulling away.
Pansy stopped walking, standing in the hallway like a frozen statue. “Excuse me?” she asked in disbelief. Although Draco wasn’t sure if she doubted her hearing or if she thought Draco mental.
Suddenly Harry wishes Malfoy would pull his collar tighter, so that he can feel his blood struggle to flow into his brain, but he doesn’t. Instead Malfoy leans his head closer to Harry’s and whispers in his ear, “Notice how I don’t have control over your legs, hips or arms? Try rolling backwards over the other shoulder while grabbing my sleeves.” Shuddering at the breath ghosting across his ear along with the slightest hint of being choked, Harry’s blood suddenly does struggle to flow into his brain, although for completely different reasons.
This chapter contains: canonical child abuse/neglect, a slight reference to bondage/kink, alcohol and a slight misunderstanding
“It’s not that bad. Snape was able to  heal most of them in time so that you can only see faint traces if you know where to look.” Draco tried his best to reassure.
They sat together in silence, Potter reading the potions book and taking notes, and Draco sorting his head. Memories still haunted the back of his mind and Draco didn’t doubt that he would have nightmares tonight, but above those haunting memories all he could hear was ‘
They were packing up, having covered quite a bit surprisingly, despite Harry being somewhat unable to focus after coming out.
“Uhm Professor?” Hermione was clearly hesitant, eyeing Pansy and Draco carefully, “Would it be possible for you to get those details off of Pansy instead of Draco? She knows most of it, if not all, and it would spare Draco from having to revisit those memories.”
“You really don’t know?” Again no words, but Harry manages to slightly shake his head. Malfoy snatches the empty glass from Harry’s hand, placing it on the side table, and swiftly straddles him. Leaning close to Harry’s ear he whispers, “I could make you see it, you know? I could show you just what you make me want to do to you.” He pauses, letting his breath ghost over Harry’s neck, grinning at the slight shiver running through the darker man’s body. Draco leans back in, “But you never answered my question.”
Harry winced at that. He had originally planned to spend Christmas at the Burrow, but after his break up with Ginny, his plans had changed. It’s not that any of the Weasleys blamed him for the breakup but things between him and his ex-girlfriend were rather awkward, and Harry could do without living with her for a month.
Just outside Draco reached for Harry’s hand again, “I like you too... More than. I didn’t get to-” he was quite suddenly cut off when Harry pulled him closer and leaned in to kiss him.
So now they waited as the rest of the class trickled out of the room. Pansy squeezed his hand in support and then motioned for him to step up to their professor.
That left Draco with a limited number of options: his formal suit (the only muggle fashion Narcissa approved of) and his small selection of wizarding robes, all of them bespoke and business appropriate. And all of them were too close to what Draco had had to wear during the war for him to be comfortable. Not only did it remind him of the war, but it was sure to remind everyone else of it too. Riding the train with the rest of the students would be a trial wearing either option.
Despite the obvious exhaustion, Harry didn’t fall asleep right away and Draco noticed. His bedmate kept shuffling closer before turning away again. Draco itched with the desire to pull him close. “Screw it” he muttered, turning towards Harry and throwing all caution to the wind — in a rather Gryffindor way no less —  Draco quietly asked, “Would you like to cuddle?” opening his arms into the semi-darkness. Harry didn’t answer but he did scoot closer and snuggled into his embrace. Within seconds Draco felt some of the tension ease from the man in his arms and it didn’t take long for either of them to fall asleep.
They all stared at Potter as he remained silent for uncomfortably long, neither answering nor reaching for his drink. Finally he said, “Maybe the time I was allowed to go to the zoo?” He didn’t sound sure and then muttered, “But then again I didn’t get to eat for a week after that.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Uhm. No yeah. Sorry I was just shocked. Thanks for offering it actually, I know you don’t have to.” Potter said.
“For now, yes. It might be crucial to extract some memories later on, should the removal of Morris not go according to my current plan, but as of right now it should suffice. Might you stay behind, Miss Parkinson?”
Not wanting to deal with any of the hate he was sure to receive in a wizarding establishment, Draco opted to visit a muggle hairstylist, once again unbelievably grateful that his muggle study tutor had insisted on visiting the closest town with him last summer. It must have been a bureaucratic horror to get the permission back then, when he was still on house arrest.
“I… I didn’t realise…” Harry drifted off, staring blankly at the empty glass he was still clutching tightly. “I guess it explains a lot,” he murmured.
“I´m sensing there´s a but coming?”, Harry asked, raising himself onto is elbows to look him in the eyes.
And Harry has to admit he was, Malfoy outranked him by a lot and he doesn’t know what to expect. Still he answers, “You wish” and attacks. They grapple for a few moments, neither managing to really bring the other down as hands fight for dominance and a better grip. Finally, Harry manages to break Malfoy’s balance and pushes him onto the mat, following suit to pin him to the ground with his own body weight.
Draco didn’t hear what Blaise said to garner the attention before he turned towards Harry and cast a silencing charm around the two of them.
Harry never noticed the mattress dipping when Malfoy snuck into bed half an hour later.
Harry eyes Malfoy for a moment longer, the braid had loosened during the warm up and a few hairs had escaped, framing his face beautifully. The last two years must have been good on him, because even Harry has to admit that Malfoy has grown into his former pointy face. Harry’s thoughts get interrupted by Chris asking him if he would like to partner with him.
Hannah's turn passed and she didn’t call on Draco, but on Terry Boot instead, who chose dare. One rather bad rendition of the latest Weird Sisters hit later and Draco felt his heartbeat quicken again, but once again he wasn’t chosen.
Fair warning: there is a mention of past Hermione/???, that is small enough that I decided not to tag the ship, so that this fic doesn't end up on the ship's listing. Check the end notes if you want to know which character she was with before reading or for any possible trigger warnings.
She caught his eyes and he silently screamed at her to return to her own assignment or to Pansy or anyone if it would only lead to her leaving them alone. He wanted to scream that ‘Harry isn’t ready you idiot!’ but he couldn’t, so he settled for a glare.
The ship is Hermione/Charlie :)
“How was dinner?” Draco asked, not having had the energy to go to the Great Hall himself after the previous evening. While nothing bad had happened, dinner still took a toll on his social batteries and he wasn’t yet at a point where he could make it every day. At least he had managed to go to breakfast and lunch with Pansy and Hermione the whole week.
Is this the first sign of The-Boy-Who-Lived turning his back on the Wizarding World? Or is there another reason for our Saviour being lured back to the muggle world?
In the case of..’
As suspected, Pansy sat at her favourite spot, one of the tables by the window facing the courtyard. When Draco saw that she was sitting with Hannah Abbott, the Patil twin from Ravenclaw and Hermione Granger of all people, he stopped dead in his tracks.
Draco interrupted her, “I was back to being a prick. I nearly insulted the git out of habit.”
“Draco!” Pansy said once he stepped into the loose circle of people and she practically threw herself at him for a hug.
No matter how many times Pansy, Blaise and Draco had joked about their collective queerness, all of them had had the foresight to not be too open about it before this year. There had been expectations on all of them. A marriage, no matter how loveless or arranged, had always been looming in each of their futures, but those expectations had burned within the aftermaths of the war.
(See the end of the chapter for
“That’s not true.” Draco said in a small voice, thinking about that day in September, years ago, where all he had wanted was to be his friend. Clearing his throat he spoke up, “I don’t hate you Potter. I understand if you still hate me, but I don’t hate you, not anymore. And even back when I did hate you, I never wanted you dead.” It somehow felt oddly important to drive that point home.
To the surprise of many, Harry Potter, instead of accepting one of the numerous job offers in the Wizarding World, has decided to study at a muggle University this fall. Despite his recent successes in the defeat of dark wizards and the offer of an accelerated introduction to the Auror corps, our Saviour has enrolled into multiple courses dealing in topics such as counseling, teaching and pedagogy.
Even though she hadn’t cleared her suggestion with Pansy beforehand, there was no objection. On the contrary, Pansy mouthed a silent “thank you” at her.
“I should be going,” McGonagall said but stopped just inside the doorway again, “The offer stands, Mr. Malfoy. Feel free to come by my office whenever you need something. Other than that I look forward to seeing you at mealtimes in the Great Hall again at some point. Have a wonderful afternoon.”
Relieved, Draco thanked the professor and then excused himself. There was no need to have yet another meltdown in front of her.
“Dunno. I thought about it, but then I just went to get tea.”  He reached up to scratch his neck. “Waking you up would have been weird. So I just… left.”
Even though it is undeniable that the wolfsbane potion has changed in appearance and efficiency, there are rumours that Draco Malfoy's long term partner Harry Potter influenced the decision of awarding the title. In reaction to the accusation Malfoy stated: “I was accepted to study under Master Twining before my relationship was common knowledge and even after I told her about it, she expected the same work and performance of me. I have worked hard for this Mastery and Harry had nothing to do with me receiving it.”
Draco had planned on getting changed himself anyways and simply shrugged. Together they stepped out of the Room of Requirement and headed for the 8th year common room.
After a while of silently working away, Potter spoke up.
Draco left the note deliberately vague, trying not to give away his identity. Before he could pack the gift away, Theo interrupted him with a reminder of the time. Hastily Draco pushed the pictures and the note under a stack of parchment and joined his friend for dinner.
“Have you ever done this before?” Draco asks unashamed, despite still straddling Harry.
The urge to apologize was strong, but Draco had promised to not pity Potter and so he didn’t. Instead he thought back to the admission Potter had made during the game.
The big table in the common room seemed too small with Pansy and Hermione spread out in one corner. Blaise, Hannah, and Neville were claiming the other side, with Susan joining in on their discussion every now and then. And then there were Draco and Potter, trying to find enough space for their assignments, quills, inkwells and potions books. In the end the two of them switched to the smaller table a few feet away.
As promised: This chapter is a bit longer than the last so have fun!
His heart beating faster, Harry ditched Ron and Hermione with the excuse of needing a piss and ducked into the closest bathroom. Safely ensconced in one of the cubicles, he pulled out the wrinkled parchment Draco had just shoved into his bag.
Before Draco could answer, there were lips on his. Maybe it wasn´t that hard to believe.
“As much as it pains me to say, I do agree with you.” drawled Malfoy and elegantly placed his hand on the table, palm facing upwards. Harry wondered for a short moment how the git was able to make this simple gesture seem haughty and as though Harry should be thankful to be allowed to read his palm. With a sigh he reached into his bag and pulled his divination textbook out. He looked from his textbook to Malfoy’s hand and back again.
“I know I said it before, but thank you.” Draco declared after a few minutes of silence. “For saving me. Not only in here, but at the trials too. I know I would be dead or in Azkaban if it weren’t for you. I owe you for that.”
Harry’s heart began racing and he was very glad that the leg Draco had thrown over him lay across his thighs and not his hips. As gently as possible, he turned them both onto the side and carefully pulled his arm out from under Draco's head, praying to Merlin and Morgana that the blond was a heavy sleeper.
His voice sounded steadier than he felt, although a slight breathlessness was audible in his words. The moment he finished talking, his eyes dropped to his books on the table. There was a slight ringing in his ears.
To his own surprise, Draco woke without much of a hangover. His head hurt slightly, but that could as well have been due to lying weirdly sometime in the night. Checking the time, he briefly considered staying in bed until lunch and then heading to the kitchen while everyone else was in the Great Hall, but eventually he decided against it. If he was to wait for lunch, he might as well go into the Hall, maybe he could tease Pansy some more. And he should probably talk to Blaise. Even though he wasn’t sure what exactly went on between Blaise and Neville — or how Hannah Abbott fit into the mix — he knew they should talk about the kiss.
“I just don’t get why you push yourself so hard.” said Harry over his plate of treacle tart. “You’ve been so focussed on studying that we haven’t had time for a date in almost three weeks.”
“I’ll… just leave you to it.” she said, not looking at either of them and turned to the door. Immediately Pansy extracted herself from the hug, promised Draco to be back in a moment and followed Hermione through the door.
The game continued and after a few moments Draco began to relax. Nobody was actually asking anything meaner than a few childhood stories and any touchy subject was avoided. Draco himself didn’t get called on a lot and when he did the tasks or questions were easy - eat a handful of Bertie Bott’s, What’s your favourite book?
The group of three sat down without really being noticed and despite his stomach feeling tight and the nerves nearly eating him alive, Draco reached for the porridge. He had had enough of sandwiches and bread if he was quite honest, so better use the opportunity while he could.
“We’re gonna try that again. Now, the truth. Where do you keep your second wand?”
In general the room resembled a common room, aside from the lack of house paraphernalia. There were multiple comfortable looking couches and armchairs arranged into little seating groups, inviting the students to sit down and talk. The ever present fireplace was sitting on one wall, and on the wall opposite stood a buffet of snacks and drinks looking somewhat improvised on the mismatched tables. In between the couches, in the middle of the room, was a larger area cleared for what Draco assumed would be dancing, although he didn’t hear any music yet.
“What are your plans then Harry?” asked Pansy.
“Well, are you gonna take it? I didn’t carry this here for you to just look at it.” she shrugged his awe off and pressed the plate into his hands. Then she reached into her robe pocket and offered Draco a set of cutlery, wrapped in a napkin. Draco took both and sat cross-legged onto his bed. Pansy carefully hung her robes and joined him.
By the time he reached the couch, the common room had erupted into hushed arguments as to what the saviour was doing in their common room and how he had even gotten in. All of the conversations stopped once more, when Harry unceremoniously plonked himself onto Draco’s lap, burying his face in Draco’s chest. Almost out of instinct, Draco put his arms around his boyfriend. He had recognised the haunted expression behind those green eyes and was guessing that Harry probably had dreamed something horrid and now needed reassurance.
When he emerged 5 minutes later Draco was awake too and he greeted him with a joyful “Good morning!”
Also this time there is no real new triggering mention. If you made it this far into the story you are definitely not triggered by references to disordered eating and a shitty homelife. Although there is a mention of Sirius being dead.
The stimulation soon became too much and Draco cried out with pleasure as he crested the peak of his orgasm, screaming out his lover's name while coming all over himself. Three strokes later Harry joined him in bliss, his come mixing with Dracos, and Draco’s name on his lips.

Instantaneously Draco’s mood changed, the earlier anger disappeared leaving room for heaviness and caution. “I am not ashamed of who I am, not anymore. There’s no point in hiding it and no harm in talking about it. You on the other hand looked really uncomfortable and I get not wanting to talk about specific topics. Life isn’t always sunshine and rainbows and some of that is no one's business. However, should you ever want to talk to someone about it… I wouldn’t judge you for it. For whatever happened to you. I have my own experiences with some shitty situations and although I won’t ever fully understand your experiences, I can at least promise you that I won’t pity you for them.”
“I’m fine Blaise. You can go with him. No need to cancel on your partners for me.” Draco murmured and gently pulled himself off of the other’s chest.
When he looked back to Harry, he saw him smoothing his hands over the fabric of his jeans, the vacant and shocked expression had disappeared.
Cookies safely stored inside his robe pockets, Draco hurried to his dorm, the halls still sent a shiver down his spine. Once he had reached his dorm, he pulled them out and gently laid them aside. He had his first planned tutoring session with Potter in half an hour and he hoped that the cookies would make for an easier atmosphere.
Shocked that McGonagall was apparently offering him access to the kitchens just so that he could have a decent, hot meal, Draco blurted out “Pansy and Hermione are working on that, They’re forcing me to breakfast tomorrow.”
Pansy grumbled something about “thick-headed asshole” and got out of the armchair, “For your sake I hope that you’re right, but I still doubt it.” She said and left.
Harry had spent some time with Dean in their makeshift common room, watching the other sketch away in his notebook, then trying to hold still after Dean asked if he could sketch his hair to try and get the texture onto paper, “As a challenge,” he had said.
Had Granger really just invited him? Draco Malfoy, ex-Death Eater? He could only nod , study meetings… people... He probably wouldn’t show, but it was nice of her anyway.
It had been a surprise for most of the students that McGonagall had continued teaching transfiguration despite her headmistress duties. While she didn’t teach all years anymore, she still taught NEWT level classes until the new professor had settled into their new job fully.
he thought and pushed the heavy doors of the Great Hall open to join Pansy at the eighth year table. Hermione shot him a surprised smile when he sat down and then continued her conversation with Potter. It was strange to see the two of them sitting in the Hall without Weasley, but the ginger had opted out of repeating his last year of school in order to help his brother at the joke shop. At least that’s what Pansy had said a few weeks back in one of her gossip rants.
The news surprised Draco. He had forgotten that Hogsmeade was this Saturday. It made sense in some way, it was the end of November and a lot of students needed to get their Christmas shopping out of the way. Sadly the news also meant that he had another parole meeting next week. His face fell at the thought of Morris.
Draco cuddled closer, glad that his tear ducts had dried out a while ago.
With a low growl, Draco pulls Harry close again, placing a few open mouthed kisses against his neck and instantly the mood changes from controlled to feral.
That was just enough time for a quick shower, and since most of the other 8th years were spending their free period outside the showers should be empty. Snatching his wand, toiletries, and towels he quickly rushed across the hall to the 8th years communal showers.
“I, uh, I’ve got some Firewhiskey and mead if you’d like?” And wasn’t that a stupid thing to offer. Harry nearly tried to backtrack and kick Malfoy out of the cottage but there was no snort, no scowl, no nothing. Instead apprehension and barely disguised curiosity were fluttering across Malfoy's face and a moment later he gave the tiniest of nods.
The workstation was practically spotless, when Draco’s brain wandered to the Christmas Party once again, reminding him of something.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry inhales some of his drink and coughs violently. “What??” he says once he’s recovered somewhat.
Harry lay awake for a long time after that, listening to Malfoys breathing change into soft snores.
“I forgave you long ago Draco,” Draco’s head snapped up at this, “That’s why I spoke at your trial; you never had a choice about this, and we were all just children — forced into a war that was never ours to begin with. And if you need to thank me for saving you, well I need to thank you for saving me too; for not identifying me at the manor, and for letting me steal your wand.”
With a nod,  they were kissing. Soft lips shyly pecking his, a tingling in his fingertips and electricity running from his lips through his entire body. Harry pulled away and without much thought, both of them rushed forward again to meet each other in a more heated kiss. Hands were cupping cheeks, burying into hair and caressing skin; lips parted to allow their tongues to explore each other's taste.
“I think I should tell you something.” he started, about to open up about the one secret he had kept from her for years. The breakfast table looked bleary through the tears gathering in his eyes. He felt his hands jittering in his lap, hidden from view by the thick tablecloth.
Malfoy catches him twice more, choking him lightly and telling him the way out a moment later. Harry is fully hard when he frees himself from yet another choke hold, but Malfoy is too slow to get up this time and Harry uses the moment to catch Malfoy in his own choke hold. He reaches around the pale neck, grabs the thick collar of Malfoy’s
“Could I have my hands back?” he asked tentatively.
“Harry,” Draco whispered and gently nudged him. “Harry, wake up. We fell asleep.”
He grabbed the hands trailing along his scars and lifted them, pinning them above their owners head, before hungrily kissing Harry again. He kissed his way to Harry’s ear, his voice rough with lust, and said, “Don’t you dare feel guilty about this. We talked about this,  they are a part of me and I am okay with that. So get over it and get with the much more important program.” He emphasized his point by grinding his hard cock down into Harry’s. The intense and commanding tone made Harry shiver and he nodded.
When it was half past 9 he put the buns into the oven, filled his display with the baked goods that were already presentable and turned the coffee machines on. Having changed into his jeans and button down, Draco unlocked the door and flipped the sign to open.
They start eating and the conversation drifts off.
Draco blinked in shock.
Suddenly Draco was glad that he was already lying on the floor, because by the way his head was swimming at Harry’s declaration, he would have surely fallen if he had been standing.
Occasionally he brushes his fingers against Harry’s prostate again, keeping the man on edge and watching him arch beautifully each time.
(See the end of the chapter for
Even the pain from his fingernails digging into him wasn’t enough to stop Draco from cowering in front of the looming form closing in on him. A mewl escaped him, when Morris leaned down and hissed into his ear.
“You said you could see… this, leading somewhere?” Draco asked, the phrasing having caught his attention early on. Harry only nodded.
“I need a favour,” Draco asked immediately after closing his door. “I overslept today and haven’t had breakfast. Would you bring me some food when you return from lunch?”
Without any warning, Draco vanishes Harry’s clothes into a neatly folded pile in the corner and the sudden onslaught of cold air forces another moan out of the Gryffindor. Instead of vanishing his own clothes too, Draco guides Harry to his bed, never breaking the kiss. He pushes the slightly smaller man onto his covers unceremoniously and maneuvers him swiftly into the middle of his bed, straddling him with jean-clad legs.
Harry could hear his blood pumping in his ears, subconsciously holding his own breath. When Malfoy breathed out it was with a controlled “woosh” and accompanied by his hand falling to his side. With a perfectly polite, almost friendly tone he said, “I am sorry for my outburst, it was unfitting of me. Please continue. You were saying something about my memory not being enough?”
They immersed themselves in the discussion and when the Hall began to fill slightly half an hour later and Draco became twitchy again, they got up and continued their conversation on the way back to the common room.
“You didn’t.” Draco had never heard Potter talk this gently. “It’s not your fault. You didn’t cast the Fiendfyre, you nearly didn’t survive it yourself. It was war and Crabbe was one of its victims. It’s not your fault.”
“Congrats?” answered Malfoy in between bites. Moments later his eyes went wide, a blush crept up his cheeks. He put the fork down. “What did I do?”
“Yes Draco, please. Oh my god please move. Fuck me, please!” begged Harry all while still grinding onto him.
“I know,” mumbled Draco, “but most of that isn’t from school. Courtesy of you-know-who and his followers.”
When Draco opened the doors to the Room of Requirement to actually reveal the potions lab, Harry’s face fell.
“hnnggg. Please. HARRY PLEASE”
“Malfoy! Wait!” Potter called, and hurried footsteps came closer. A hand reached out and caught Draco’s robes. With a herculean effort Draco managed to not flinch at the physical contact but scowled at the Gryffindor instead. He remained silent.
On the weekends however, he had to carefully craft scenarios where he could touch Potter without the boy-wonder growing suspicious of him. Thank Merlin that Potter was oblivious.
They ate in silence and Draco debated with himself on what to do next. Harry had looked tired enough before they had their talk and now he just seemed exhausted and barely keeping upright. Sure enough, not long after finishing a second scone, Draco felt the weight of Harry’s head on his shoulders.
After packing up two slices of apple pie he handed Potter the pie and Teddy his bag of cookies, winking conspiratorial at him. While paying, Potter mouthed a silent “Thank you” at him, glad that he hadn’t had to officially cave on his 10 cookie rule.
Unsure of what he was getting into, Draco took a seat and pulled one of the purple folders towards him. In it were a bunch of drawings and muggle pictures of tattoos. Some with very clear lines, analytical, clean, strong and most of those in shades of black and grey. About halfway through the folder the style changed abruptly. The lines were still clear but they were smaller and fewer of them. An outline here and there but most of the work was done in colour. Different colours and shades flowing into each other like wet ink. His attention caught on a tattoo of a single flower, the colours flowy yet blotchy and Draco knew that he wanted something similar. Determined he laid the folder back onto the small table, sending a quick glance towards Leah.
“I think you’re right, I joined the Death Eaters to make them proud, to make my father proud. And it was wrong. I believed in the Dark Lord because they — he — wanted me to believe in Him.” He broke off for a moment and then admitted in a whisper, “I don’t know what to believe anymore.”
“Draco?”
Two hours later they had reached the end of the market and were positively frozen despite holding hands. Neither spoke of the kiss as they started on the way back to the cottage. But after a few metres away from the distractions of the market, Harry’s brain kept thinking back to it and to waking up in each others arms. He figured he should open up about it and cleared his throat.
Harry opened his mouth, but that gave him pause. He furrowed his brows. His tone was slow when he asked:
Even more weeks passed of the school year and school had really started intensifying, however Harry and Hermione spent a lot of their downtime from studying studying Ron and Draco.

"It's alright Harry. I suppose it
"Of course you did. But you haven't become a Death Eater, your parents are fine, your mother is apparently incredible and Harry is a huge, brainless, bloody idiot. What else is new?"
"Harry—" She leaned over to whisper, her face gray. "Should we—do something?"
And he
Draco's lips twitched and he leaned back into his chair, crossed his arms across his chest.
"Malfoy! Wake up,
"Of course it was me, Malfoy. It's well known I hate your guts." Ron flashed a grin and flicked an olive at Draco's face. Ron's aim was impeccable, and the olive popped Draco right on his pointy nose.
"You wish, Malfoy."
for a more special moment.
He loved Draco.
Harry stared at Draco again. It was understandable to freak the fuck out when faced with someone's half eaten arm, Harry felt stupid for feeling surprised.
Narcissa sighed deeply and placed her tea down—schooled her features:
"Alright, I—Right." He shook his head at himself and bit his lip over a grin. "So the bond was different in me. Still doesn't explain why I'd die." He shivered a bit still at the prospect.
They both knew what was going on.
"Yes, I'm fine." Draco deigned to reply, and refused to flush.
Potter bit his lip and shook his head, gathered his wits about him:
It left Draco and Teddy alone, and Draco wasn't sure why he was still so unnerved.
When the full wolf finally emerged from the shadowed corners of the room, Draco's breath hitched. The wolf was a dirty gray color, and blinking up at Draco with such crystal green eyes—Harry's eyes.
The tears didn't stop this time.
Harry nodded, his own amusement showing through, though a small part somewhere in him bloomed at the fact Draco bothered to correct himself:
"Hearing a Slytherin tell me that, my first instinct is to be suspicious. However, that just proves your point
"And—we didn't know so—then when we came here to break the lust bond, we destroyed the Black signet ring and—"
"Of just how much we'd imprint upon each other." Malfoy elaborated, he sounded...
Harry felt a sharp pain stab through his chest as his heart stuttered to an inexplicable
"Mione, here we are." Ron called to Hermione, who was waiting in the kitchen, having tea with Draco. She bustled into the living room and took Harry off Ron, face pinched with worry.
"Do however you please, Kreacher. I doubt it would change much."
Everyone stared at him in utter confusion, including Draco, when his partner Smith spoke up:
Harry breathed a sigh of relief. He had very little idea about any of this as he dived into it, typical of him, and had worried that Snowflake would require some sort of special treatment that Draco and he might not be able to provide him with.
"Stop staring at uncle Harry and listen to me!" Teddy complained.
Though even Hermione was doubtful it would be the case here, she remained adorably hopeful that perhaps the boys would manage on their own. Pansy had been more realistic about it, but she indulged Hermione, just because Hermione looked rather fetching when she smiled.
"Nevermind, I know why he's glowing."
Draco dropped his head into his knees:
for me and I actually just don't fucking understand." Draco sounded exceedingly despairing.
he was talking about was. He pushed on:
"Stay. Can you? I don't want to be alone..."
"What the fuck Draco?" Was the only thing Harry could raggedly pant once he let go of Draco. "What the
Potter was great fun—to Pansy's shock. She'd thought he'd be prudish and sort of boring, but that didn't turn out to be true.
When lunch had come he'd been huddled in with the few other Purebloods who'd dared return to school and taken to a vacant classroom by a hall monitor, then they'd been told to take their seats and wait for their designated partners to arrive and the first lesson to begin. He'd just kept his head down and did as instructed, until he saw the other group arrive and managed to pick out a few faces and names.
"Oh? How come, dare I ask?" Draco felt Harry's smile pressed into the back of his shoulder.
Hermione and Ron grinned his way and the moment his cuffs were off and he was officially free from all proceedings, they both ran in to hug him. Draco heard himself chuckle softly and accepted the embrace.
Not even when he was chained to a cold wall and branded with an iron hot stamp
He promised Draco, he loved him.
soft."
"I wasn't. I, of course am aware that you're a Malfoy, you never cry. Unless you're horny."
that read
"Is that really what you think?"
Harry dropped to his knees in front of the blonde, so close now,
Potter was next, standing up on shaky legs:
Harry deflated, he couldn't keep to his waning anger:
"I think it is. It'll take about six months before the change is integrated. We can't break the bond before then." The thought of walking around with a constant erection for half a year made Harry want to weep.
Because Draco—the fool—was head over heels in love with Potter, and was doing precisely
change to the script.
"There's plenty of people. For one, there's you." It was a bit self-deprecating and pitiful, but Harry couldn't help it.
"Honestly, you lot, this is a library, have you absolutely no class or decorum?" Draco sneered and dusted himself off, entirely casually.
He was fucking awake.
"Brilliant. Hermione, give me your hairpin." Ron held out a hand, and Granger furrowed her brows, before reaching up and pulling two out of her hair and placed them in his hand.
And—it meant a lot to him, to make it count and be special.
"Even then I'm ten times more handsome than you."
"You've earned it now."
Now Draco doesn't like to cry often, but such a confession—well—
"Good, that's good, now if you can wake up for me that'd be lovely—" Harry subconsciously rubbed Malfoy's back in an awkward attempt to soothe him.
One of Kreacher's ears twitched for the briefest of moments.
Harry just nodded absently. Now that he was actually looking out for it, he saw all the same things Ron and Hermione used to tell him about, and he always felt giddy when it hit him all over again that interest was mutual.
see how it could've been
Potter rubbed at the back of his neck as he thought it through, a pinch in his brow:
it was
The story itself sounded casual enough, but the way Malfoy punctuated the word
many." Pansy explained.
"Yes. A bonding can be forced, but it can never be made to comply if the two involved love someone else. Your magic simply refused to accept anyone else except whoever it is you're in love with."
If he couldn't find any alternative way to reach Draco before his magical energy became a danger, he'd have to press the damn button. And even that didn't mean shit because he'd still have no idea how to physically pull Draco out from whenever he was.
Draco merely shrugged in response. He couldn't of left Harry behind.
Pansy looked at him and sadly huffed:
As they all sat in a thin silence, Harry dozed off thinking about how it all started and played out, so many years ago now....
Harry whimpered into their kiss, his fingers tangled in Draco's hair, combing across his scalp, peeling his mouth away only to aid Draco in removing his shirt, himself shoving at Draco's robes, his face enraptured and so hot Draco's cock jumped in his pants.
happening to him—his heart had gone numb with how fast it was slamming against his ribcage.
Hermione cast a non-verbal Protego around him—just in case. She did that often when they were out and about for too long and if he noticed, he never said anything about it.
Draco was scowling, because he knew that Ron knew that he knew that Ron was right. And it was a beautiful feeling really.
"You're not a dog Malfoy, I won't treat you as one." Harry finally spoke at length, after spending what he was sure was upwards of 20 seconds just gaping at the other.
He'd done fine pretending that the other wasn't there. His heart hurt enough on a daily basis just having to carry all of Malfoy's resentful glares and scathing comments around, he didn't fancy going through a baring session with him and getting mocked for each of his answers.
The ginger ran a hand through his hair in frustration. He
Harry wasn't sure how to describe what Malfoy's face did after Harry spoke—but it had Harry worried for a second. At first, he went whiter than paper, then he looked like he'd been tinged green, before finally his skin pinkened to the point it appeared uncomfortable. Harry could safely say it's the closest he'd ever seen Malfoy to being
Draco blinked, then smiled a dazzling grin, before his nose scrunched up in such an adorable way Harry's heart juddered, then he replied:
They...they thought...
The doors swung open and Draco came stumbling backwards, collapsing onto his arse while two guys Harry didn't know names off came trailing in, pointing their wands at him.
Harry shushed him. The way Draco said it, the way he was speaking, as if Harry was his, it made the little voice in Harry's brain screaming
They made it to the Floo, and Draco pulled Potter in, grabbed the powder and prayed to the powers that be that this doesn't end in spectacular failure.
He was about 99% certain that at least Hermione if not Ron had clued in on something by now, but Harry was less worried about that than he was worried about Draco himself also noticing.
It was only then that Harry realized he was holding Draco the same way one would a bride. Heh, he certainly didn't mind.
Draco's stomach flipped as he stepped into the old, creaky house.
He was losing him. He couldn't bring Harry back to their own world, he could never have him there again.
It had startled him then, to realize Malfoy wasn't made of stone like it initially seemed to be the case based on his dead drawl and cold sneers. To see the human side of Malfoy, under very unfortunate circumstances albeit, had been the inflection point that changed Harry's thought flow about it all. And while a million other things had been at the forefront of his mind then, growing to love Malfoy was always running in the background—it was always simply
Potter, on the other hand raised an eyebrow and straightened again:
Harry stared. Never before in his whole entire life did he ever see anyone
Harry walked on clouds the rest of that day, watching Draco and Hermione converse about magical theory and Draco finally take Ron up on that Quidditch debate from awhile back. And things were easier than Harry could have ever imagined.
Jesus Merlin. That was--The blonde couldn't help but smile:
from cold. No, his eyes were endless and intense like the afternoon sun. And deep,
"Potter! Please--my mother--they tried to--but she didn't--and they're gonna--and there's no one else--oh
Malfoy looked equally as uncomfortable as Harry, but he nodded all the same.
Everyone was still gathered round and staring, and Harry had a half mind to shoot a collective Stinging hex to their balls, but he refrained. Incapacitating nearly half of the DMLE would be bad for business, no matter how much they may deserve it. And they deserved it well and proper, make no mistake of that.
"I get it. It wouldn't have had to be this way, if something had been done about this
As he blinked upon the stone statues, Draco had to back away in utter horror, until he was stumbling over the rising hill he'd just descended and lost his footing, falling backwards onto his arse.
"Like hell there isn't." Pansy snipped—she fully intended to find out what the hell he planned to do.
The blonde didn't flinch at the statement the way Harry had been half braced for. He even seemed as though he felt similarly.
That had been arguably
"Same old same old."
"Right, of course. It's a lot smaller than magic cancelers I've read about. Very innovative." She mumbled, while Ron slowly started to pick his jaw up off the floor and turn to face Draco, who looked distinctly like a rabbit ready to flee upon the attention.
He felt like he was missing something
She couldn't blame him for keeping his head down—he'd done a lot of terrible things.
"Well if you take me out I'll die. Is that what you want?" Harry sounded horrendously calm.
"Harry!"
"Well? Or perhaps you'd rather some other Veela flutter in and whisk me away?"
but to shock him, much as the thought sickened him, he certainly couldn't let him tear an entire motel down and possibly kill or hurt innocent people.
But then that would mean that Draco wanted Harry, which didn't seem very likely. He acted like Harry didn't even exist, deigning to spend as little time as possible in the same room. Yet, there was no other way to explain the call, whether it was done consciously or not.
"I didn't realize, Draco." Ron opted to play stupid. "I forgot, I'm sorry." He had to remain elusive until the next full moon, when he'd do what he'd planned to.
And it was realizing that last one that had a smother of disappointment blooming behind his ribcage, he'd looked forward to sharing the secret with the world.
Harry bit the inside of his cheek, trying to reconcile with himself to be okay with that. After a second he let himself slowly nod:
"Share a personal problem and ask your partner's advice on how they'd handle it. Also, ask your partner to reflect back to you how you seem to be feeling about the problem you have chosen."
If Draco had found something in there—worse yet, if he
"I was wondering—if we might try to become friends." She got straight to the point and Malfoy spun around to gape at her. "Yes, I'm being serious." She answered his unspoken question.
"I see. So what would you do it for then, if not free?"
After all, Harry was the Boy-Who-Lived, he'd be fine. He always was. He hoped.
"No. It takes six months for the bond to adjust the change. We can only break it safely then."
"Whatever
"They planned this..." He muttered to himself, just to say something, just to distract himself from Harry standing not five feet away.
to talk it sounded sloppy and wrong because he couldn't fucking
leave now—now that he knew that Draco—he couldn't leave without telling him at least—
Draco leaned back, pressed into Harry:
Harry grinned as the answer dawned upon him. He turned back round to Ron:
"I—thank you so much, Harry." Kingsley sighed deeply, warily, his expression unclenching with deep relief.
"Of course not." Harry snickered. Apparently Malfoy
Of course, he never would've guessed the first person he'd end up actually loving would be Draco Malfoy. Harry questioned whether this was love too, since it didn't really feel deserved for him.
of me
Draco doesn't believe it, he looks up at Potter's table only to find him looking back.
Things would be okay for him, Draco felt hopeful, even if he was still a bit lost for direction.
Sam wouldn't give this up yet. He didn't quite know why he wanted to push this through to the bitter end when Draco had been a right bastard, but he supposed he just wanted to stop the maniac before he fucked his way into his own alcohol induced grave.
Ron's eyes were growing wide with horror, he was gawking, while Hermione's grew narrow with curiosity.
"Touche."
"He asked me why I kept using him as an excuse not to hang out with you guys—" Harry cringed when both Ron and Hermione glared at him over that. "—And I told him I wasn't, but that Ministry put me in charge of him so I had to stay close."
"Talk to me Potter? What about?"
going on, what's the best way to go about figuring it all out without outright just asking like a berk?"
Harry went cold. If they did that—Harry didn't dare think what would come of it. If the Ministry got word of what happened, it was entirely possible they would deem Harry an irresponsible handler, since he failed to use the device in the face of great destruction and let it happen, and could quite possible arrest Draco and haul him off back to Azkaban. And Harry—couldn't let that happen. Under any circumstances. No.
Not wasting another second, Malfoy read the next one:
to tell anyone what had gone down when he went to apologize to Potter—the girl would be lying if she said she wasn't foaming at the mouth to find out.
Draco had accepted, of course, even though he faked disgust at being a Weasley's offspring's godfather. He loved Rosie.
"Er yes—" Draco's response was not any more eloquent, as he put Teddy down.
Harry was extremely amused, especially because he knew the truth. He felt in on the joke, and it was doing wonders to quell his vengeful thoughts for the Stinger his face took.
"I love you." Harry muttered against Draco's lips. "Happy birthday."
why can't it be?" His eyes burned and everything was happening too quickly, he'd gone mad and Harry had left and this couldn't be real—
She smiled.
It wasn't a story to tell the grandkids (if they ever got that far of course, right now things were still unclear, Draco shouldn't get ahead of himself, happy and excited as he was), but if nothing else, at least it was unique.
"I've done
are deeply devoted to someone else—we can't force someone out of love and into a pressured bonding." She finally sighed and shrugged.
Sam straightened himself up and entered the bar he knew Draco would frequent at this hour.
"And I'd just heard her voice again." Draco's expression didn't waver from perfect porcelain and then, in that one moment he was the old, cold Malfoy again. Everything that being one meant, he embodied it.
"What else would you have me do Kreacher? You keep saying I can't access the wing, and I
"Harry Potter's life is in grave danger and I need your help to try to save him. You're his best friend, why else do you think I came here?" He repeated slowly, enunciating each word.
Godric opened his mouth to protest, then shrugged in agreement:
Over the second and third years Draco sobered up and felt the bleakness of prison set into his very bones, but he felt jaded against it all. It was in the fourth year that the misery had finally hit him. Even he didn't feel sorry for himself, even though he was the one underfed in a dingy cell. He felt pitiful about the fact that the one thing Harry had done everything he could to prevent had happened.
"The—tattoo? What tattoo?" He hadn't ever gotten any tattoos. He'd considered getting some to cover up the Mark once or twice, but never really got around to it.
Draco had gone stiff and sort of distant while he poured the three drops of Veritaserum on his tongue. He was quiet for a moment, lips pressed tightly into a line, but the potion ploughed too strong, and forced the truth out:
It was the pretty standard spiel that was always given at the start of the school year, Harry tuned most of it out. He was too uncomfortable within his robes, too heated. The hum of other students around did not take any of the edge off the cursed bond. He still felt needy and was tempted to rut into the chair, the pressure clawing at him, but even if he was to abandon all social decency, he'd find no relief regardless, so it didn't matter either way. Harry whined quietly under his breath and cursed the day some Black bastards created such a cruel, ruthless bond.
The next day Draco woke up with his stomach in knots.
"Is it good?" Ginny popped in the doorway, her red hair fluttering behind her. She was grinning but her good mood vanished when she saw the expression on Harry's face.
"Well, of course, it
It didn't hurt, it just fanned the flames of his desire while Harry whimpered into his mouth and tore himself away, dropped his head into the crook of Draco's neck, panting hotly.
Two weeks into her plan, Hermione was surprised to report how good of a friend Malfoy could make.
"You did not know what would happen." Grimmauld sounded caring in a way, which was a strange thought to think of his own house, Harry distantly mused. "My magic is sustaining you now, it is why I swallowed you into me, you would have died and I'd have been left bereft of an owner had I not saved you."
He turned his head towards Ron, eyes wide and swimming. Draco sniffed Ron, and immediately pressed a hand over his mouth and nose, quickly clambering away from Ron and backing himself into a corner.
The posture was so unlike someone who was asleep, so tense, that it occurred to Harry that Draco might not have been sleeping either. Could it be—?
Draco screamed into the damp, empty darkness.
As he walked back out into the hallway, he came face to face with Ron, who was dispersing the others back to their own offices.
The blonde nodded though his face twisted into a grimace that couldn't have looked more fake, if only because it couldn't reach his eyes:
"My mum and I, we're very close." Malfoy shrugged one shoulder.
Such a reply shocked Harry. He stopped, stared at Malfoy with the most beseeching expression, he was sure.
Draco stared at him.
"It was just a side effect of unraveling a bond." He settled for the lie. "Usually the blast is not so strong or forceful, but it happens sometimes, that it gets a bit out of control. It's alright."
What time even was it?
"Well, I'll be crying a whole bunch in the foreseeable future apparently. Thought to get it out of the way now why. So your her—hm, Gryffindorness, doesn't come prodding."
"Just look at him. You'll figure it out."
"After the war, I can imagine how McGonagall might be the teensiest bit upset at students going around breaking windows and damaging property."
And Pansy would
"My pleasure, Mr.Potter."
Fucking hell.
"Then you can—" Draco choked up when Harry licked his lips beneath him. His eyes zeroed in on the action, and he seemingly forgot what he was saying.
if he left this place, apparently the voice owner's magic, though Harry really had no clue how was it even remotely possible to exist
His eyes narrowed for a moment, though his mouth quirked up:
That was comforting, though not by much, because Harry's screams still rang in his ears and stung his eyes with pooling tears.
A whitehot pang of yearning bitterly struck Draco and he shook himself, smothering it away.
"Malfoy? What are you doing here?"
Draco scoffed and Potter snorted and it was all so humiliating, but Draco couldn't bring himself to be mad at Teddy.
"What do you mean by that?"
Godric supposed he could stop and give her a few moments of his time, put her at ease. She might be able to help him even. He retold the story of how he was—quite rudely—yelled at by the raven boy who had sent him off to find Draco Malfoy.
Draco's eyes swam, wavering with an emotion that wasn't desire for a flick of a second. Then he looked away:
"Does that mean—" Harry could barely get his voice out, his lungs shriveling with utter dread. "—that I have to stay here—forever?"
It took a while, but eventually, his knot softened up enough for Harry to be able to pull out and lie next to Draco on the floor.
Well, later was now.
This was it. Get through this and they were out of here.
Harry nodded, continued wiping the blood away. He deigned to speak through it:
All the pieces were falling into place, after such a long time.
And considering that they were who they were, they most definitely wouldn't be.
It managed to mollify him, but Pansy knew that as the game got more heated, that lie would quickly grow null.
It was gentle, and slow, they explored each other, Harry's hand coming up wrap around Draco's neck, and Draco's trailing up through Harry's hair.
Harry pushed himself to stand, his right arm searing further. He grit his teeth not to scream out in agony, and instead forced himself to call for Draco.
He didn't want to go impose upon Draco or wake him up for something as ridiculous as being unable to sleep without him. Like a Krup. Harry felt like a Krup.
"And you like him too and then you—messed up like this, Harry." She added.
"No. It was my choice to come with you. It was my idea to turn myself in. None of it is your fault."
"We need to be tactical about this. Voldemort wants me, so you'll deliver me to him, in exchange for your and your parents's lives and freedom. That's the only way anyone's getting out alive."
To see Harry so beaten down by some stress or another, to the point he would just exhaust all his fight and deflate to the state of mind where he just wished to be invisible and stay out of everyone's way.
In a few steps she was in front of him and tugging the letter out of his hands to read it for herself.
"Yes." Harry nodded, serious as can be. "Could you train a ferret to offer such a service?"
A rising wave of terror crashed over him and for a few seconds all he could do was stand frozen in the middle of the living room and cry.
Potter's hands slid down from Draco's arms to around his waist and he pressed them together, biting his lip again as his eyes searched Draco's face.
But Potter didn't look shocked or surprised at all. Instead, he smiled the coldest, most dangerous smile Draco has ever seen on him, and pointed his wand straight at Justin:
"Don't play dumb, do you honestly think you could look me in the eyes and lie that you're not
Harry nodded as he put his mug back down. That sounded reasonable enough:
"Draco, look at me, keep your eyes on me c'mon." Harry instructed, drawing Malfoy's attention to himself. Once Malfoy's eyes were on him, Harry stepped closer. He grabbed Malfoy's hands and linked their fingers. Malfoy squeezed Harry's hand, and Harry stayed silent until Malfoy had calmed down.
That was an understatement if Draco had ever heard one.
It was quite late into the night when Draco returned, knackered as always.
"Oh. Hi Malfoy." He murmured and Draco just nodded, unsure what exactly he was supposed to do with a sleep rumpled Potter. "D'you feel better?"
He'd always been a rather proactive person, mostly operated on emotion and instinct and—that might just be all Hermione needed to stir him into action.
this.
"Yes, precisely. We should get going now. We'll return tomorrow to continue."
"I have to keep all of you safe. Draco, you, Mione. Who knows what the wolf is capable of? I couldn't live with myself if I hurt any of you." Harry reasoned, hoping to mellow out Ron, but Ron was having none of it, though he said nothing, he let Harry think he'd mollified him, if only for the prat's peace of mind.
Potter.
"Don't bother trying to make it go away. Trust me I've tried everything short of turning myself into a eunuch." He bitterly glared down at his own crotch for a second before slumping forwards.
"Of—Of course—" Draco whinged out, voice failing him, mind spinning away from his grasp, still plowing into Harry desperately, chasing sweet catastrophe with reckless abandon and need.
Harry frowned. What was Malfoy apologizing for? The whole point of the situation they were in now was that his magic was unstable, not exactly anything he had any control over.
and tired of everyone avoiding everyone because some snake lunatic stirred up a war that swept us all up into it." Pansy declared and stood akimbo, glaring at each and every returning eighth year in turn, which was barely a handful. "Especially you two, Draco, Harry." She called out briskly.
Draco shook his head with a snort:
They met up during dinner a few days later to complete the essay, which Draco didn't feel super anxious about like he had assumed he would. That first lesson really seemed to have melted some of the ice between them.
It felt so long ago now. They've come an incredibly long way. At risk of sounding horribly sappy, Harry was proud. They went from reluctant Auror trainees to tentative colleagues to the best damn partners the DMLE had ever seen in only a few years. And somewhere along that line, Harry fell in love. He couldn't tell you how or exactly when it happened.
Standing up wouldn't do him any good, he was an easier target that way, so perhaps staying low was his best bet, at least until he made it past the thickest layer of danger. That plan in mind, Harry lowered himself to his stomach and began to crawl forwards, forcing his limbs to propel him onwards quickly. Grimmauld was starting to creak around him, which made his gut twist with fear. There were already blooming cracks on the walls, so Harry pushed himself to go faster.
Draco facepalmed:
"Leave me alone, I was eleven! What better did I know?"
The ball was a lovely affair. Little fairy lights were sprung up around the Great Hall, and all the tables had been cleared to make space—there was some butterbeer floating around.
The bed was too cold and wrinkled and no matter how much Harry tossed about, he couldn't get comfortable. Something was missing.
"You're painfully forgiving." Malfoy shrugged.
The bitter tang that this was the last time he'd have Harry sat lodged in Draco's throat like a knife in his windpipe, his nails scrabbling at Harry's back tighter, praying this to last as long as possible, in spite of the ache in his bollocks as he held on savagely.
And if something had gone wrong with the magic, that meant—
that was Malfoy!
People turned to
much shit.
"Hey Gin, we got another one!" Harry craned his neck and called out to the hallway, hoping to summon his "wife" into her office.
Harry sighed deeply and went back inside, shut the door, then leaned back on it. He was lucky they didn't have a warrant really, because had they seen the state of his home and learned Malfoy caused it, Harry was sure he'd have one hell of a time busting the blonde arsehole out of Azkaban.
"I'm laying perfectly still, so I'm not doing anything to you. Besides, you're the one who collapsed over me like an utter wanker."

that for how much crap you talked about his hair, you'd kill anyone who tried to change it, including Harry himself—"
Potter watched them, his expression unreadable yet still soft:
Draco swallowed half the cocktail in one gulp.
. Where are you going in such a rush anyways?" Parkinson slowly stood up and dusted herself off.
"That defeats the purpose of an
"They're welcome to try and see where it gets them." He pointed out and propped himself above Harry.
Harry, meanwhile, had one last thing to do before lunch break rolled around.
Draco wanted to yell at him. How could someone be so infuriatingly attractive yet so,
Malfoy coughed for a moment, then cleared his throat hastily, flushing:
So lost in thought though he was, Harry almost jumped out of his own skin when he felt a light grip on his shoulder, coaxing him to straighten up. Harry did, casting Draco a quizzical look, but Draco said nothing as he pulled Harry to stand and led him to the bed, his hands a constant touch upon the raven's shoulder and back.
to be a reason. A reason he was still alive, when everyone who loves him has gone now, moved on to a better place. A reason he was here now.
"It seems your son has come here with a wager for me." Voldemort spoke to them, sounding cold and indifferent. "A wager I'm afraid I can not turn down."
"I think you're the only one who stands an actual chance at
He couldn't even bloody apologize either—It would mean explaining he'd lied and then Draco would undoubtedly ask for the truth.
"If only I figured it out sooner, but well, hindsight is 20-20 I suppose." Potter chimed in, then fell silent to drink more tea.
Draco rolled his eyes, which was fair, Harry deserved that one for his vague, inadequate phrasing:
And if Potter appeared again, Draco would probably have to punch him
"Father?" Draco blinked and lowered his wand. Narcissa stepped out from behind her husband and gasped when she saw the state Harry was in.
"Knock over any paintings from boredom?" Draco snickered. When he had particularly long, work heavy shifts, he'd come home to more than a few paintings sprawled on the floor where Harry kept knocking them about to entertain himself.
Draco just watched him, heart pounding, as he waited.
"It's amusing."
"I see. Well, that explains what just happened with the both of them." She smiled mirthlessly. "Alright, so I get what you're trying to do, but they're too frayed around each other for it to work." She explained.
Draco was speechless, he felt floored. And proud. And grateful.
That was a complex question to answer, there's many things Harry valued in a friend, but at the most basic, he supposed there was one thing he appreciated more than the rest:
"They won't allow him to return to school unless someone is—chaperoning—him, as it were, and if he's not back in Hogwarts, then he'll be back in—"
when something is wrong..."
"What makes you think he'd have done
"Say, Draco," Potter began conversationally out of bloody nowhere. "I know about the past, but what's it like for you now?"
—" Draco admitted, feeling a smidge embarrassed.
Potter's reaction time had been slow—at first he just silently observed Hermione drape herself all over Draco with a profound sadness in his eyes, which had then sharpened into something akin to anger, which had then melted into a pool of resigned envy.
"...Should I force that though? Having sex I mean..I figured if I could just get them talking, it's alright, I hadn't meddled too far into it, but this..this is...a
Gods, he was an actual
and Pansy would claim that until the day she died. But Potter also looked incredibly—
that maybe Draco would lose the dazed, numb look in his eyes and start talking—about
It was most likely his nerves talking, but he couldn't help himself.
"Never
Life really was full of surprises.
"I'm alive Draco." Harry spoke, his brows furrowed and lips frowning.
And yet, it was perfect.
Bloody ancestral archair bonds.
And he wasn't alone in his hurting.
Harry felt a rock congeal in his throat, pressing on it so tightly he could barely breathe let alone speak. He tried to get something out regardless:
Grimmauld was silent for a long time. Harry decided to start walking again. He was feeling more comfortable here now, almost as if he
"Fair." Harry conceded. "Not
He'd known for a while that his friends had over six months to get over the grievances Draco caused them, and that they had managed it, but it was still so funny to him how absolutely shell-shocked Draco himself was.
"Try—touching it and I guess—asking for it?" Harry grimaced at his words, nose scrunching up.
This wasn't going to work.
Definitely love.
So no, he couldn't bear the thought of Malfoy dead.
"No—no, no just—let me—" He stumbled over his words and flushed, seemingly surprising even himself by speaking.
"How did—this place survive?" Malfoy asked once he joined Harry up.
"Uhm, left?" He appeared confused.
Draco forced his Lumos brighter, expanding it to illuminate the vast space around him, and his heart faltered and hitched as light fell upon the sight before him.
As Draco looked upon it, the king of the night sky, he felt even more assured that there was a reason for everything. A design to this world, an order.
Trying to settle into bed with a raging boner was difficult, but worse yet was when Harry would wake up only to find himself pressed down into the bed by some part of Draco. Sometimes it would be Draco's arm tossed around Harry, or his leg or his head. There was always something.
"Wow, thanks mate." Ron took it in stride and went to his own office.

Hermione had even picked through the memory via a Pensieve, to make sure they were repeating the exact things they'd spoken then, with one
They'd make such a cute couple—Pansy knew she was getting ahead of herself, but she couldn't help it.
Ron nodded and tossed Harry's robes to him:
Everything else could bloody well disappear.
Harry blanched.

"Why didn't you tell me sooner?" He suddenly pouted, leaning into Harry's touch.
"Yes, yes. Hmm...I suppose you're not
"Maybe
He shook himself out of it:
Harry grinned and arched an eyebrow:
"Yes." Harry affirmed resolutely.
When they rode out their highs, when Draco's vision returned to him from the Heavens above where it skyrocketed, he gently pulled out of Harry and just collapsed next to him, feeling boneless.
"I asked Grimmauld but—it said no. The only way to let me leave is if we can bond, but in order to bond we need the heirloom, which we don't have and the reason we don't have it is precisely how we ended up here. It's a paradox, a cruel irony made by those evil fucking ancestors—" Harry rambled, his pent trembling obvious. He let his hands drop from Draco's face—Draco immediately missed the warm touch.
So, Malfoy had something to hide. Something
It was just the consequence of the bond after all.
a rather random guest to invite, in his own opinion, anyways.
"Of course you won't Potter. Noble hero and all."
Too far.
certain that there was something
"Why haven't you—why haven't you claimed me?" Harry panted out after a while, as if he'd only just realized that Draco, indeed, hadn't done it.
Speaking of, Harry'd been lingering in the Ministry garden reminiscing long enough, he had to go find his idiot of a partner and see what trouble he'd gotten himself into this time.
"I'll be right back Zach, just see what he wants." Harry squeezed past his partner and grabbed Malfoy's shoulder, started pulling him down the hall towards his office, but Malfoy bristled away from it, which was...odd, but Harry didn't dwell on it and instead rounded off into the bathroom and tossed a quick locking charm once they were inside.
By the time he found himself at Potter's front step, he'd already thrown up twice.
Hermione followed his pathetic pining gaze to where Pansy had swooped Harry into a dance, and honestly,
What he hadn't known, is that McGonagall would introduce a new programme for all the 8th year Pureblood students, which was mandatory, that encompassed learning all about Muggles.
"Yeah, I know."
Harry collapsed against the door behind him, reality crashing through the pop in his ears while Draco pressed a hand over his mouth and buried his other in his own hair and tugged, pacing the width of the classroom.
The very first week of Harry's return had been surreal. Ron had never felt quite as high as those seven days. Taking Harry to see family, the hugs and tears and mended pains of the past year—it felt much too good to be true. Like a fairy tale. Like it was all just a happy dream Ron would wake up from.
He'd figure this out on his own then, consequences be damned.
"Okay. Okay." The raven mumbled, though he knew that he wouldn't forgive himself any time in the near future. At least Draco didn't hate him over it.
"Yes, I told you."
"It's not doing any harm either." Ron shrugged.
If Harry just watched this, he'd never forgive himself, all his promises to Draco be damned. He muttered the plan to Hermione, who swallowed and stood from her chair, a determined set on her face and her wand pointed up.
"Did you need something Harry?" Draco asked instead of pondering his musings any further. He was in no mood for conversation, even less so conversation with Harry. For a second a pang of guilt struck him, for Harry was painfully forward with his emotions and thoughts, so earnest. Draco—
"When did you last sing to yourself? To someone else?" Harry quickly read aloud, smoothly cutting Malfoy off, and gave him a pointed look to drop it. It seemed as if the spell didn't mind if they didn't finish their answers, only if they tried to lie. Small mercies, he supposed.
If Harry knew his husband at all, and he liked to think he did, Draco would marvel at the lengths she'd gone to, and won't have the heart to refuse her after that.
And she
"That's not for you! It's for—" He lashed out, but then choked up and cut himself off.
Suddenly the full moon comment made so much more sense. Of course Draco would more acutely feel that need on the full moon, when Harry was stripped down to the most barebones of himself.
glad you came." Potter admitted, swaying closer.
"No." Draco simply stated, obviously not very inclined to say more.
Draco insisted that Harry don't go get anyone until his bandages were removed, because lots of magical activity around a magic induced injury could sometimes cause hives. So for a few days longer, they just sat around the house, pretty much each doing his own thing.
Harry was silent for a simile of a moment, but when he replied he sounded just as assured:
to open his mouth:
Harry began uttering the incantations, doing his best to be loud enough to shatter the brittle silence, Draco joining in after a moment.
I won't survive that a second time." The blonde admitted bitterly. "It was my fault—
"Good. It was all worth it then." Harry concluded.
"Are you good to go back?" Harry finally spoke.
to admit it, Malfoy was bloody good, and the DMLE couldn't afford to lose him.
The girl appeared downright ecstatic when his story was done, her eyes lit up fervently, all her suspicion gone:
Worst of all, it sounded like he really meant it too.
"Got what?" He replied, almost as an afterthought—like he hadn't been paying attention and had only then realized Harry had spoken.
She couldn't do anything
like a predator stalking prey. Waiting for the perfect moment to pounce and claim what's his.
"Oh, great Grimmauld place, would you do me the absolute honor of allowing me to enter the most esteemed Ancestral wing?"
Harry swallowed and let himself wallow in despair for a moment. Then he explained in a gravelly voice:
Both Ginny and Harry
"Can you work on Astoria like this?" He countered with a raised eyebrow.
Except it was.
"You okay?" He muttered and Draco sighed and waved Harry's hands off him:
Malfoy!" Granger hissed as she practically jumped from her armchair and went to him.
You win some, you lose some, that's life eh?
A beseeched voice startled them into parting.
"I've been calling you by your given name for months now, and you still can't return the favor?"
"Because I was so
"He is?" It was quiet, Sam assumed far too quieter than Draco had wanted it to be.
It had to have been Harry all along, even before the call...even then...
He left Clara's training centre with Snowflake and an exhilarated flutter to his heartbeat.
"I can escape Malfoy. I've done it countless times now, I'll be fine, but your parents won't be if we keep wasting time. We came here to get them out, and that's what we're gonna do. Doesn't matter how."
to. And—you weren't well, I couldn't just—
"Now." Harry muttered to Malfoy, who steeled himself and yanked the cloak off, leaving them visible to everyone in the room.
"My best ones too!" He moaned.
"Well if you're so eager to bare your heart out to me then be my guest." Harry snipped back, his response lacking bite, he was just
Draco rolled his eyes and scowled:
The question had Draco frowning. Potter—cared? Draco had figured Potter had mostly invited him over just to appease Teddy, but that didn't seem to be true, which honestly made Draco very happy. So disgustingly pleased.
As he walked in, he was surprised to find Draco wasn't there to scowl at him for coming home at blind hours.
"About your arm—" Draco started after a while, his leg bouncing on the floor, jerking his chin at it. "I had to—regrow most of the skin and, well, those patches are going to be different in color from the rest."
is Malfoy
Right. Well. Harry supposed he should think of a way to get rid of the problem, at least momentarily.
And not just any person, Draco Malfoy.
"Don't you have wards?"
Why shouldn't he take his chances as they came to him?
Ronald? If those two could swallow their, might I input,
Ron nodded, and grabbed his right arm to haul him up and get him to start walking.
Just as Hermione and Pansy were headed to the Great Hall for lunch, planning ways to break the ice between Potter and Draco—they heard a great lull come over the Hall and hurried inside, just in time to catch McGonagall rising to her feet and clinking a spoon against a crystal glass to get everyone's attention. When she spoke, her voice rang out clear and warm:
When Harry made his way downstairs, he overheard voices drifting from the kitchen. He recognized the grating, bullfrog lilt as Kreacher's and assumed the other person must have been Malfoy.
slither his way out of it if he was sneaky enough.
And there were still things—there would always be, Ron knew, as he prepared to leave for work.
Harry choked on air at the question. He started to choke and Hermione pat him on the back to get it all out.
like Draco. Guys, I'm—in love with him." The words felt foreign rolling off Harry's tongue, but he couldn't stop them once they started, as if a wave of them roiled in his throat and demanded to spill out. "And at the time I really thought he'd never actually feel the same, I just didn't want him to ever find out, so I—got him to think that."
Draco took a deep breath:
Pansy piped up to answer Ron's question then:
Malfoy snorted, and Harry couldn't believe that this was the same Malfoy who'd been attempting to lie his way out of every question not five minutes ago. It was the tilt of Malfoy's head as he vividly described his room when he was little and all the peacocks that used to wander the grounds, how he played with them, it was the angle of his smile—sharp enough to be a distinct Malfoy smile, yet soft enough to be incredibly fond and the shade of his eyes when they rounded and warmed—Harry
"The life under the Dark Lord was cold and cruel. The Death Eaters enjoyed killing and torturing Muggles. I still see Charity Burbage's shadow every now and then, still hear the shrieks of the tortured captives in the dungeons for months. I hated myself when I used to think serving Voldemort was honorable because it was downright vile. They forced me to practice their evil ways, but I just could never do it. No matter how I think Muggles are weak and pathetic, I could never think of hurting them because they're as much human as witches and wizards are. But when I showed a small sign of inhibition, they tortured me instead. They made me watch small children getting tortured or getting ravaged by Greyback. Voldemort's inner circle took turns in using the Cruciatus on me, and sometimes they used Imperius to command me to do... things to the prisoners. There were countless of times Aunt Bella made me watch her torturing my mother, and even Imperio'd me to torture her.
Harry suppressed a self-deprecating groan, vaguely wondering what had become of his life, why he suddenly lost his tongue in Draco's presence. They certainly had seven years of witty altercation and acerbic imbroglios but Harry's will to come up with a sarcastic retort all but diminished. Then again, the new Draco couldn't really get a rise out of him enough to warrant the same acrimonious exchange.
, below it were the dates,
Harry snuggled comfortably on the loveseat, and glared at Malfoy when the blond stayed standing by his side. "Aren't you going to sit down?" He snapped. When Malfoy calmly shook his head, Harry pulled him and Malfoy landed on his lap with an squeak.
Harry had long forgotten the last time he had had a nice sleep—if he could even sleep at all. All the nights consist of fitful slumber and waking up drenched in sweat, his silky blankets tightly wound around his trembling body, the remnants of a disturbing nightmare still fresh behind his eyelids. He found himself sometimes afraid of closing his eyes, because when he does, the vivid projections of the Battle played in his mind like a lucid reality.
Harry grunted noncommittally before chewing on his food. In his periphery, he saw Hermione sharing a knowing look with Ron. Again with their sentimentally cloying uniform looks that always gratingly reminded him of his solo life. Harry's patience run out. He woke up on the wrong side of bed after all.
The Slytherin House had always been segregated from the other Houses before, more so after the war. The only upside of this prejudicial treatment, is that the rest of the students had pretended that the Slytherins don't exist. They were left out to themselves, were not given a single attention, were not bullied and hexed in the hallways. After a few months of this reprieve and practically ignored by everyone, Malfoy's resentment and bitterness at the sudden negative attention he was receiving wasn't a wonder.
"What?" He snarled at the second year Gryffindor, who squeaked upon seeing his red, irate face.
Five of the Slytherins stopped snickering and collectively looked up at Harry by their table, albeit with different expressions. Bulstrode can't hide the disgust on her face and Nott was glaring daggers at him. It was Parkinson who faked a cough and politely inclined her head.
That was when Ginny arrived.
“Are you both done?” He gritted. Pansy turned to him, eyes narrowing. She must’ve seen something in Draco’s face as she pulled Ginevra to her, whispering something then letting go. They shared an affectionate kiss on the lips and hands on each other’s bums before Ginevra made an exit.
With a heavy, plaintive sigh, Harry scooted even closer to Draco, relieved to hear the rumble of his chest as Draco chuckled against the top of his head.
There was a moment of comfortable silence, where Harry just stared off at the indigo that colored the sky at the wake of the twilight, the blinking stars blanketing its expanse, and Draco warred with himself, if the object in his pocket is worth showing or it would probably destroy the tenuous, temporary peace.
"Yes," Harry answered, voice bleat and hoarse. They stared at each other, Draco's eyes filled with emotions Harry was too frazzled to comprehend. Harry's mind was oddly empty, like a dam that had just been broken. Drained. Draco's eyes were coaxing, he realized. "I want..."
for the both of them."
"That's your recreational activity for almost seven years now," Harry piped. At Hermione's deadpan, he rolled his eyes. "You could be in the library and read
"Mother sent me a heads up last night. She apparently realised father's next in line. Severus helped her strengthen the wards yesterday. I was also heavily prohibited to chance on Hogsmeade. My life has turned so fucking barren and uneventful."
"What do
“How are you feeling, Harry?” Dianne asked him after a few moments of silence. Harry looked at her and shrugged.
Malfoy gently smiled at him,
Which should not be appropriate. But he wanted to anyway. And Harry just stood there, beside Draco, too tensed to make a move, warmth spreading in his belly, wondering if every moment with Draco Malfoy will always be this awkward.
At that, Malfoy turned to him, his eyes bored and impassive. "What?"
“He was so different from me. He was brave but not stupid enough to lead his family to their demise. He had a strong personality and conviction, so strong that he had converted some of the fallen creatures who were loyal to Saturnine to the Light. He was the kindest friend anyone could’ve wanted; the epitome of hero with so much love for humanity, as Hermione so called him. He was everything that I was not.”
Harry knew Malfoy was the only student to rival Hermione in Potions, probably even better than her, not that Harry would ever admit that to any of them, but Harry didn't get to appreciate how "in his element" Malfoy was during Potions before because he had been a snooty, stuck up git. Right now though...
awkward drarry is my religion :(( they're so cute :((
"That overgrown bat definitely out to get us. He probably has some kind of sadistic streak to make all of us fail or embarrass ourselves," Ron grumbled. The three of them stopped a few feet away from door to the classroom and the congregation of Slytherins.
But it didn't really do him good when all of his classes were shared with Draco Malfoy. No matter how hard he tried to focus, Harry always found his eyes wandering back to stare at the back of Draco's head or his profile. It was like there was something that pulled Harry to him, like a distant fantasy or an eerie beckoning voice from the end of a dark road that he was too powerless to fought back. Harry didn't know how much of his fascination showed through his face but he could see Ron's confused expression and Hermione's glare of frustrated resignation from his periphery. Harry doggedly ignored his friends.
"I don't have any afternoon classes tomorrow," he said. Harry frowned at Malfoy but nodded his head.
“You’re hardly normal to begin with, aren’t you? Scarhead?” Draco said, voice light with humor. He was immensely pleased at the tentative grin that broke the morose lines on Harry’s face.
Harry wondered if Malfoy was affected with what had transpired between them last night as much as Harry did. Did he stayed up awake all night trying to fathom what happened between them just like Harry did? Was he confused? Was he angry when Harry punched him in the face? Was he disgusted with himself after showing vulnerability before his once Gryffindor rival?
"We were two different people back then," Harry said pensively. "I wish the war haven't change the way we were before."
(See the end of the chapter for
"What do you expect from Snape, Hermione? Do you really not think he'd left the
"What? Here?" Draco incredulously asked. Harry bit his lips, face heating up as he nodded his head.
“I don’t know?” Harry sighed.
“Please let him...” she trailed off, pursing her lips before resolutely nodded her head. Draco didn’t waste anytime bolting out of the room.
let him feel safe, a little bit sad and sullen but safe and warm, in Draco's arms for just a few hours.
(he had wanted to erase that part but,
Severus Snape barely concealed his disdainful sneer before the whole teaching staff.
“This was... weird,” Harry said quietly, his voice hoarse from crying. “I came back to Hogwarts because I want normalcy. But you,” he said, the edge of his lips quirking slightly. “Draco Malfoy had turn everything upside-down.”
a little bit of angst (this was shitty bec i used my phone to update again)
"Who says I'm trying to be subtle?" Harry bluntly said and then soundly closed his mouth when Draco's lips pursed even more. "And I'm not spying on you. It's just..."
"Please Pansy, give the guy a break," Ginny said, holding her hands and pulling her towards the castle. "We're
They had all been the intrinsic characteristics of Malfoy's little self. And Harry—despite his belief that Malfoy had changed after the war—couldn't fault his (once) Slytherin rival for feeling bitter.
“What do you mean?”
He had been afraid he was going overboard with this little impulsive decision, him and Harry were not friends after all. He was prepared to shrug it off after Harry stayed staring at him, until Harry placed a hand above Draco’s and the stopwatch.
Draco was standing by the lake, a small stone clutched in his hand and the letter on the other. His eyes were far off and his usual prim posture eluded him. Draco was shut off and Harry doesn't know how to approach him. They just had their bitter fall out last night where he practically implied that Draco was up to something. And now Draco's in bereavement and might think Harry was here to add insult to injury. The last thing Harry wanted is for Draco to feel any more upset than he already was.
"I can understand about McGonagall. I mean, she probably needs some steamy—" Ron shrieked when Hermione pinch his side. "But imagine if the overgrown dungeon bat reads it in his lonely, desolate nights..."
Hermione's eyes took on a determined glint, and Harry suppressed a sigh for he knew what will progress next before Hermione could open her mouth.
His sheets wound around his body when he awoke, gasping and writhing. Nightmares always virtually intensified the feeling of being trapped in the event, his body wracked with spasms, bile rushed to his throat but his body too tired to muster the strength to throw up. Maybe he would die of asphyxiation this time, who knows.
“I’ve heard about the Histrionicus Potions from Professor Severus,” the Mind-Healer said. “So I presumed it went well?”
Draco just held him tighter, lips near his ear, whispering words that were lost on Harry. Harry gripped the front of Draco's shirt, swamped with excruciating agony, wheezing and choking at the heavily nauseating lump in his throat.
But there had been a lot of things to think about when Harry came back to Hogwarts. Harry was not safe from the swooning, simpering crowd of his hero-worshippers. There were eyes and ears, and sometimes hands (which were terrifyingly traumatic all the same), that always followed him. Harry understood their need to thank him, their need to shake his hands, their shameless gawking at him for being "The Savior of Wizarding World" or "The Conqueror of Evil" or whatever balderdash, but Harry despised the attention and their overt way of showing their gratitude.
Harry nodded his head, appeased at the somber look in Draco's eyes. Harry placed his head on the other's chest, the faintest of his heartbeat like a rhythm of hypnotic lullaby in Harry's ears. Arm thrown over Draco's torso, Harry closed his eyes.
"Oh Draco," Narcissa sighed, cupping Draco's face. "I told you not to worry for me. It doesn't do good for your sake and your NEWTs to dwell on things outside of your control. Moreover, Severus put up additional wards that will alert both you and him should I find myself in peril." Narcissa finally turned her cool gaze to Harry, acknowledging his presence. "I was not informed that we would be having a guest."
Draco groaned and hauled Potter out of the Room of Requirements.
And Harry felt wrong-footed.
It had taken out of control when the cursed
Harry stared at the innocuous book on top of his Defense and Charms textbooks. He stared longingly at it, battling in his mind if re-reading the sixth installment of
"Malfoy! It is you!"
"No. It was natural. Cathartic, even."
There was a commotion and verbal dispute that followed Malfoy's statement but Harry remained seated, detached while watching it play before him. Pansy Parkinson immediately stood up and defended Hermione, but that only spurred Malfoy on and spat all the derogatory terms he could think of. Ron, probably because of the
Malfoy didn't said anything as Harry led the way out of the Room of Requirements. Trudging along the corridors of Hogwarts proved to be an arduous task, Harry realized, as a group of Hufflepuffs and younger Gryffindors flocked him,that  even two months into the term hadn't waned. There was a shockingly relieved cry that bubbled out of him at the feel of Malfoy's hand on his, directing him away from the crowd and helping him navigate through the halls with ease and grace, as expected of the blond.
The day went by so fast. It was probably because all his classes for the day were shared with Draco.
"Well, I did not say that both the parties would consume the same potion, did I?" Severus said, his eyes glinting happily—or as happy as Severus Snape could get. Albus stared at the Potions Master in appraisal, the twinkle in his eyes is back.
"Draco, you're in fucking danger. Anyone from the outside could've penetrated the wards, Imperius'd a student, Polyjuice into someone like fucking Barty Crouch Jr.; anything could've happened!" Harry growled. "Hogwarts isn't even the safest place anymore when I've always almost died since I was eleven."
It wasn't just the shame and remorse that kept him up. It was Draco's face, contorted with disappointment, rage and open hurt at being accused of something he clearly regretted. It had only been a matter of time before Harry's inherent intrusiveness and penchant for poking his nose to things he's not welcomed would backfire at him. Draco'd done nothing this year to warrant suspicion. He had changed, far from the toffee-nosed, swelled-headed privileged kid of his past, and Harry still found this shockingly disbelieving at times. But the Malfoys recompensed for their actions during the war. More than half of the Malfoy fortune had expropriated by the Ministry, Narcissa was under house arrest and her wand was also confiscated, and Lucius was rotting in Azkaban, serving his remaining sentence for the rest of his life. Though the Ministry decided to let Draco have his Hawthorn wand for his NEWTs (a part of his stipulation), it was more useless than anything since it was heavily monitored by the Ministry. Harry thought Draco was trying harder than most to get by the year with impossible grades that will somehow overrule the mark on his left arm.
Draco quietly sighed, swept an overall look at Harry’s peaceful sleeping state, before slowly got up and padded across the floor. He looked back at Harry once again before closing the door behind him. He made a small trip to the loo to relieved himself and decided to visit his own dormitory before going back to Harry’s.
"If you've brought me here on Monday, Draco, I would've blown up this ridiculously melodramatic dark lair. Well,
"I am now," Harry grunted, slightly peeved to be woken up. Neville had a grace to look sheepish.
“Stop it! Don’t you dare think like that,” Granger exclaimed, face horrified and close to sobbing. Even Weasley paled sickeningly at the thought. “Can you not panic, Malfoy! He must’ve used the Invisibility Cloak to get out.”
The first time he laid in his bed, watching Draco in the Slytherin boys dormitory just across from theirs, pacing in front of his Slytherin cohorts, Ron had snorted.
"Harry!"
"Who told you to barge in unannounced inside my sleeping chambers, Draco?" Severus glared at Harry behind him. "And you brought the insolent brat with you?"
"Of course, I haven't," Draco short of snapped. He exhaled, physically reigning in his temper, and looked apologetic at Narcissa's slightly affronted face. "It's not surprising to have difficulties relaxing amid this...very importunate political affairs. After all, you're all alone here. With only wards away from jeopardy."
Harry stared at their enthusiastic retreating bodies in disbelief and he was thankful not to be Ron at the moment. Harry turned to Draco, still standing in front of him. He felt nervous, his voice suddenly deserted him.
"Who are you to tell me what to do?" Draco asked, the words were harsh but his tone was soft. He didn't sound so angry at all.
"Wait for me in the Common Room. And wear some bloody shoes," Harry gritted. There was a muffled padding across the floor before the door opened then closed.
"You will meet two times for each week for the next three weeks, both of you will take turns to drink the potion of your choosing, and you will record, in details, your experiences both personally and the effects of the potions in the relationship with your partner."
His dysfunctional childhood might be different from Harry's but in a sense, it was damaging all the same. Though the result of the awful experiences from their youths were vastly distinctive, with Harry having an overt sense of justice and Draco being a bully, but Draco was just as damaged as Harry, and Harry had never understood Draco more than at that moment.
Harry stared at Hermione, startled with her outburst. She was teary-eyed and panting after her long rant and Ron's arm curled around her shoulder, comforting her, and his face was somber. If Hermione was close to tearing up instead of looking stern and Ron was in serious mode, this was a subject that they had hash over for so long, just waiting for the right time to boil over and tip. Harry knew he had some issues with himself that he seriously need some pondering over and was deliberately refusing to acknowledge but it was not an excuse to let his best friends worry for his sake. He became so self-absorbed that the one thing that he prevented from happening inevitably did, all because he doesn't want to intrude into their lives as couples and worry them. But Hermione and Ron have always been there for him right from the start, not just during the heroic adventures but also in personal growths and developments, and depriving them of the right to let them know about his problems is not fair for them. Shame, embarrassment and guilt all gripped Harry.
"Oh, another article about Harry again?" Ron snorted, smirking at Harry and reminiscing the article last September where the Prophet had made a particularly intrusive speculation of how long Harry's bits was. Harry flicked a rice at him. "What's it about this time? His favorite flavor of lu—"
He should really stop and consider his behavior. But it was the reason why he wanted minimal to no human interaction during one of his "under the weather" days. He couldn't bear the guilt of snapping and raging at anyone who was intentionally just concerned. But sympathy had always grated on his nerves, and the look on Malfoy's face, the wary gentleness, had Harry feeling nauseated.
It was a soft command, though Harry never meant to sound it that way. Malfoy's face fell and he seemed to realize everything that he had done, because his eyes shone against the light, an unmistakable glint of remorse. Harry took everything in him to ignore the wild churning in his stomach and stood up, gripping Malfoy's arm tightly.
"Poor Potter," Parkinson chuckled, sounding pleased for Harry's expanse. "Quite bereft of a lover, aren't you? It would be a pleasure to show you what me and Ginny—"
Unless if Snape miraculously decided to be rational for once, realize that Harry and James Potter are two entirely different persons and learn to bury his childish grievances.
Harry started. Even if he wasn't really being subtle with his staring, he made no effort in making his presence known and merely contented himself with watching Draco work. Without his knowing, Harry walked toward him and sat beside him. Draco didn't look up, still focused on his essay, but he also didn't tell him to bugger off so Harry relax in his chair. The small distance between them didn't deter him from staring some more, enticed with Draco's sharp jaw and long nose, the tiny details of his face now that he's closer.
"Why don't we go back to the Common Room so you can rest?" Malfoy gently led him to the direction of the eighth year Common Room. And Harry, of course, acquiesced.
"You can come to me anytime you want. I'll be here to, er, listen." Draco stared at him, an inexplicable emotion crossed his eyes, much like the one when they were by the lake. Harry realised their faces were inches away from each other. But he didn't intend to kiss Draco on the lips just after he had bared himself to Harry. So he placed his lips on Draco's forehead instead, a gesture of assurance and respect and understanding. He thought he heard the blond gasp.
"Where... what are you..."
"I'm fine, just," Harry sighed. "I always wanted to say that to him for so long. It felt freeing and cathartic."
"We should be working on our potions right about now," Malfoy said. Harry's eyes snapped up to him, shifting his feet awkwardly. Malfoy tilted his head. "Are you alright, Potter? We can postpone it tomorrow if you want—"
Harry was too stunned to react. He hadn't any idea Draco went through something like that. It was because of his horror that he didn't expect Draco to whip out Harry's wand out of his side pocket, a manic frenzy overcoming his dazed expression that frighteningly reminded Harry of Bellatrix Lestrange, and trained it to a squirrel by the tree.
“Well, I’ve dated Harry Potter, bitch,” Ginevra shot back, earning a sardonic laugh from Pansy.
"It's okay, Harry," Hermione told him. "We all changed after the war. I'm sure Ginny would understand it."
potion needs to be brewed first since it's a core ingredient for
Harry watched her retreating back, feeling awful for angering Ginny and slightly annoyed at her assumptions. Harry doesn't want to lose Ginny, that's why he was postponing any time to confront her of the truth. But he also can't stand her demands, threatening him like that.
He had not said anything to his parents, just let the overdue sorrow of his late parents gripped him and his sad exhales to carry over the Autumn air. He hadn’t mind everything else in the world.
. The stopwatch certainly doesn't feel that way in his grasp, the vibrations rather felt like a calming buzz. Harry flipped the stopwatch, the golden surface glinting in the sunlight, a lone sunbeam momentarily blinding him. He pulled the object close to his eyes, grazing his fingers on the inscribed initials,
"Ehem."
Harry shifted and Draco loosened his hold. Harry turned around to face him, and he was hit with a paroxysm of emotion as he looked at those shockingly bright, grey eyes; looking at Draco was a heartbreakingly beautiful exploit, an intense melancholic longing weighing heavily in his heart. He was simultaneously feeling like he could cry in happiness and laugh in disbelief as he stared into Draco's gentle orbs; eyes like the waves of the ocean, lapping at him—rivetingly, enticingly—drowning him, little by little.
at the same time, that wouldn't destroy the purpose."
"The project, Potter. We'll going to have to report to Snape tomorrow for our progress last week."
Or Harry thought he knew Draco Malfoy.
"I'm..." he trailed off in the face of Hermione's knowing expression. "I'm distracted and I can't do my assignment when I do, you know."
Harry closed his eyes, as the onslaught of feelings he forgot he had assaulted him all at once. Lungs burning with the violent sorrow, a pathetic drive to whimper clawing at his throat to be freed, Harry about-turn as he heard Malfoy inhaled. He desperately clamped on the urge to sob, blinking fast at the prickling of his eyelids, unshed tears blurring his sight.
, "there's a reason the Sedatus Potion acts as the mediator between the pair. Professor Snape's instructions stated that the drinkers of both potions must not have a distance of more than fifty meters."
Harry drifted in and out of sleep.
“What?” Harry asked, voice embarrassingly high.
Harry stared at Draco's profile, a sudden apprehensive churn settling in his gut. Draco was so near but felt like miles away. He was otherworldly, so ethereal, and it isn't the perfect time to be thinking such thoughts but Draco was so hauntingly beautiful. Always so unreachable. Harry wanted to touch him, comfort him, but he knew it wouldn't be welcomed.
"Don't be silly, Harry," Hermione rolled her eyes. "Of course we're not. I mean, it's Malfoy," at that Ron grinned at her, "and I'm still a bit skeptical when it comes to him. But if Malfoy can bring you there, can comfort you, why would we be against it?"
When Draco had demanded they move to the Slytherins', it went downhill from there. Within three minutes of sitting down, Draco had managed to anger the usually laidback Zabini and make Bulstrode cry. When he had started flinging crumbs of food to an unsuspecting seventh year, Draco had received a punch to the side of his face, and in the process of moving Draco out of another oncoming fist, Harry was the one who was smacked in the face instead. Draco had become livid at the sight of Harry toppling over, and in his rage, Draco had a burst of accidental magic that hit two nearby fourth years and Theo Nott. In his attempts to resolve the brief altercation, Dumbledore had gently asked Harry to take Draco out of the Great Hall. Draco had taken offense to this dismissal and had went on to a long tirade about the Headmaster's bias against the Slytherin House before making a dramatic exit.
"For the information of your asinine mind, I have gotten an explicit authorization from the Minister himself, you foolish boy," Severus sneered back, his weariness on Draco's never-ending tirade was obvious on his sallow face. "If you—"
Draco looked at him sharply, grey eyes guarded and wary. Harry offered a lopsided grin.
"You okay?" Malfoy asked silently. Harry raised his head to stare up at Malfoy's grey eyes and all he could see was mildness, that is so unusual of the blond. It was a rare sight of Malfoy being so gentle and Harry couldn't find it himself to feel angry anymore. Just flummoxed and bewildered.
"What? Scared?"
Harry belatedly realized that everyone sat beside their partners. Harry found Malfoy the only student not staring at him, sitting in the front row, his back ramrod straight. Harry pulled himself and walked to sit beside the blond. Snape continued his discussion.
Harry nodded then swallowed. He looked at the expressions on his friends' faces. "What? Am I not allowed to be in a good mood? Do you rather prefer me brooding?" He added jokingly but it only made his best friends even more confused.
Draco looks comfortable and dainty, yet still managed to look prim even when uncharacteristically slouched. Harry could see the tip of his tongue poking out and the minute frown on his brows; he wondered how Draco made such a bland position be fetching to look at.
Snape perused another parchment. This time, he didn't read the contents out loud. The angry thinning of his lips and the sharp glare he directed at Nott and Neville were enough telltale of what racy things the pair had written.
"Are you just going to lurk there and watch me like a creep?"
“He was becoming rapidly obsessed with Draco Malfoy” ;)
I've always felt strongly about any kind of abuse and bully (maybe bec i've been bullied myself before). And Dumbledore's intentions in the canon of Harry being put in the Dursley's, literally leaving him in their doorstep, ignoring the years of abuse and bully Harry had gone through under his wretched relatives' roof was kind of... preposterous for me. I mean??? All that abuse for some bloody wards??? Lmao i don't even understand. And let's not really get into the whole fifth yr fiasco where Dumbledore 'had to' ignore Harry because he was afraid the dark lord might be spying on him through Harry. It was fucked up and it had my blood boiling in anger really
Aside from the fact that the Sedatus takes all of one's mental energy, Harry felt so burnt-out dealing with a person who was very unpredictable and close to being unhinged. Draco had been quiet and subdued when they came back to Hogwarts. But lunch proved to be more strenuous than he could imagine. Draco had been agreeable when Harry suggested they sit with Gryffindors, but he all but switched when they were actually surrounded by Harry's friends. If he wasn't being a total git by ordering Harry to spoon-fed him, he would began giving Ron an earful about proper table etiquette and chastising Hermione for bringing books on the table and for being an "insufferable know-it-all", all while merrily flicking bits of food to Neville's downtrodden face.
“Quidditch, used to play seeker,” Harry replied. “But it never really worked well. You know the only time I joined the weekend Quidditch game with the seventh and eighth years was... disaster.”
"Not bloody likely," Ron shook his head. "Every Death Eater, prisoned or on the run, had ended up bitten the dust. Reckon there's some vigilantes who take it upon themselves and do them in. Always the same, isn't it? Natural causes?"
The only upside to this emotional dispirit he seemed so incline to be under every time Halloween comes near was his friends' considerate distance.
"Potter is reading
It was not Hermione's decision to come back. It was Harry's.
With a bolt of speed, Draco bounded down the stairs to the group of Gryffindors lounging by the fire in the Common Room.
"Yeah. Just tired."
Or from Parkinson, who was outright gaping at him.
Harry turned to stare at Ginny's glowering face. He was almost eerily reminded of the same expression on Molly's face when she's angry.
"I'm surprise you knew psychoanalyze in the first place, considering you're not really big on the linguistic department," Draco said in humor, chuckling at the top of his head. The sound resonated through Harry, blinking back the prickling in his eyes.
“Yeah. A bit overrated for my liking,” Harry mildly rolled his eyes at that, “it was what everyone was talking about. Pansy and Millie were obsessed. So I just have to check if it’s worth the hype.”
“Yes,” Harry said, more emotion and meaning lacing the affirmation more than he could permit. “He was there during the Halloween with me. And brought me to my parents’ graveyard.” He wanted to tell her about Draco helping him to sleep but he wanted to keep the moment to himself, something he could treasure secretly.
"Okay?"
Harry squirmed in his seat. It was a good thing the armchair felt soft and comfy, not like the ones in Snape’s office that left his backside aching after the seemingly endless hours of detention.
"Don't be such a git, Draco," Harry said mildly, shaking his head up at the blond fondly, before pulling him down beside him. Draco grunted but Harry shoved a sandwich in his mouth. "I planned all this for you, you should at least be thankful."
"You shouldn't hide behind all these masks, Draco," Harry whispered. He belatedly realised he was moving closer and they were inches away from each other. But he didn't move away, and neither did Draco. "I don't know if it's necessary for you to be this impassive and subdued, like a fucking porcelain doll. Probably a Slytherin thing. But just like this, so open... you look so good. You should laugh more often."
"Well, at least you admit the last part," Hermione shook her head, smiling fondly at Ron.
“Wait, you shagged Justin before?” Ginevra gaped at her girlfriend, disbelief on her face. Draco would’ve shared Weaslette’s sentiment at the memory if it weren’t for the fact they had just done the dirty on his bed. “I expected better from you, honey—”
Harry didn't know what pushed him—probably just the effects of the
"I wasn't aware that the Slytherins were an inconvenience to you, King Weasley," Pansy Parkinson suddenly appeared, inviting herself to sit beside Hermione. Upon catching on the reference, Ron reached across Hermione to slap the back of Parkinson's head. She swiftly swerved from the attack. "And for your information, we were as much a slave as you mighty Gryffindors were, so don't feel so special."
Draco's face lost its antagonistic expression as fast as it came, a delighted smile stretching his lips, his grey eyes sparkling with mirth at Harry's easy acquiescence. "I'm glad you're pleasingly agreeable, Harry. We're just going to get rid of this scruffy clothes."
"Really Pansy?" Malfoy sneered, the disgust shining brightly in his grey eyes. "Frolicking with the filthy, know-it-all Mudblood. Couldn't you sink any lower?"
“It’s not a problem, and you’re not pathetic,” Draco said, reassuringly. “I understand the feeling of being afraid to show emotions. But it’s completely normal. Well, as normal as the Boy-Who-Lived can be. We were ought to express it, lest we feel like a walking, breathing husk.” He felt like he was baring his soul to Harry as much as Harry was wearing his heart on his sleeve. “You are not pathetic, and certainly not weak for having them. We were just born from circumstances that forced us to pretend we haven’t.”
"It's just the potion, Gin," he sighed tiredly. "Look. Can I make it up with you? Tomorrow? Hogsmeade?" Harry asked, hopefully to distract her and tell her the thing that he's been postponing to tell.
this is so overdue & i was under the weather when i wrote some parts, so i feel it was kinda all over the place but i rlly tried. & thank you so much for the kudos and comments. i love u all somuch :))
was eerily reminiscent of the Battle of Hogwarts, and it didn't help that it was published just a month after the Second Wizarding War. Reading it Harry felt clinical and detached from his emotions, and he can view the war in a different, more colorful and fictional perspective without having to deal with unnecessarily reminiscing painful memories.
“What is that for, Granger?” Draco snapped, glaring at the bushy-haired witch. “I don’t have anytime for this sodding—”
“Sleeping?” Pansy asked incredulously. “No student had ever slept while under the Augmentare. You didn’t, perhaps, knock him out, did you?”
Emotionally... there's obviously an apparent invisible wall between them that both him and Ginny don't know how to breach, too many scars that they don't know how to heal. Maybe that was the reason they just couldn't be together anymore; Harry was in love with her, truly, but they both had been just as unknowing and young.
Harry didn't know if Draco would took on his offer to fly. After all, they had not interacted amicably outside of their Potions project. But after mounting on his Firebolt and gliding through the air, there was no room for regret or embarrassment. Harry missed this!
. Harry watched him with a fanatic fervor. If it were in the past, Harry wouldn't even dare to acknowledge Malfoy's composed and relax bearing when brewing. But right now that he was offered a front row view, it was there for him to appreciate. Malfoy moved with beautiful precision, maneuvering across their miniature potion station with clear-cut accuracy while still looking delicate and cool. He looked like he was born for the Potions lab, the way he held the knife and stir the potion with his calculating, aristocratic hands.
slept.
"Bloody hell, Severus!"
“What do you mean where Harry went? Where is he?” Granger asked, standing up.
"And we have an audience," Malfoy shook his head. Harry stared at the spectators that were starting to crowd around them in the fourth floor corridor. Harry felt the searing rage multiplying tenfold. "Harry, please don't."
Draco's face, though was now wet with tears, suddenly twisted in a violent angry scowl that surprised Harry despite himself. "But I reckon it was Lucius fault. It was always his fault. I lost myself in order to reach his ridiculously high expectations. He taught me to be just like his image; the malevolent, prideful aristocrat, and what did that caused me? I lost the opportunity to be close to the one person I really wanted to befriend. All the Pureblood tripe he taught me at young age had made me into this bigoted and spiteful boy who lost his morals and sense of self-identity.
was periodically published two years ago, in their fifth year, and had recently gained fame after the latest book, the sixth of the installment, was released quite coincidentally a month after the war, which also featured the war between Saturnine and the demigods' dimension. Nobody ever knew who the writer was, who chose to remain anonymous.
"I miss you, Gin," Harry sighed against her auburn hair. They squeezed each other briefly before slowly letting go.
And after all, this is what Harry came back for: to find normalcy.
“Yes. It’s therapeutic.”
As expected, his vermillion
When Harry went to get the ingredients, he was thinking how he
had taken wind of these baseless assumptions. There had been a few Howlers and letters from supposedly concerned masses that assaulted Malfoy at breakfast. It had gotten worse that Dumbledore had to step in and announced to the entire Great Hall, and had later on sent letters to the Ministry and the
The most funny pair, if Harry wasn't currently angry at the noise that reverberated throughout the room, was Neville and Theodore Nott. The Slytherin was snapping orders at Neville to massage his shoulders while the Gryffindor, pleasantly grinning, had submissively yield to his commands.
, and had to stifle an inappropriate snort.
The blond git always complicates things, doesn't he?
Draco turned. He offered a half-smile before cooly saying, "I need to dress you up, Harry. We don't want to be in father's presence with that... rag you call clothes now, do we?"
Harry instinctively stepped back at the maddened glint in Draco’s eyes. “Draco. I—”
The silence progressed in Dumbledore's office, and for once, the Headmaster was speechless, the twinkle in his eyes had dulled. Harry sat down on his chair heavily, Malfoy put his hand on Harry's knee and immediately, Harry felt some of his anger ebbed away. Harry didn't know what had pushed him to shout at the Headmaster, he didn't even understand half of what he's saying. But all he felt was the searing rage that burned hot against his nerves and flowing through his veins, and the pure, unadulterated incense upon the sight of the Headmaster. It was worse than the anger he felt for Dumbledore in fifth year because it had been Voldemort's Horcrux. This resentment was Harry's and it was unwarranted but buried for years, and had been amplified.
' would fail to see the brilliance behind his very own suggestion. Severus stared at Dumbledore, the only indicative of his impatience was the sharp raised eyebrow and the thinning of his lips. Albus sighed heavily.
“You would?” Harry softly asked. It wasn’t disbelieving nor rejection, so Draco nodded. They stared at each other’s eyes for longer than necessary, until Harry looked down.
"Okay, Draco," Harry tried to make his voice sound as amicable as possible. "I'm just surprised. You haven't informed me beforehand."
“Back at it again, mate?”
"Um, Harry?" A meek voice sounded behind him.
"Study? Potions?" Ron snorted incredulously. "Yeah, I would when Snape concoct a potion to make his hair less greasy."
After all, Ginny was his friend first before becoming his lover. It would truly break his heart having to break that friendship more than having to close their almost nonexistent relationship.
"I'm not obsessing with Malfoy, 'Mione!" Harry argued. Ron shook his head, staring pitifully at Harry (which Harry glowered at) and pointed a fork at him.
The other two pairs were involved in their own bubbles. Zabini was trying to sneer at Ron disgustingly, but every time Ron said something, Zabini would laugh uncontrollably only to glare at the redhead again. Hermione was babbling excitedly about something to Parkinson, who was trying to look bored and uninterested, but Harry thought he saw intrigue and suppressed amazement in the Slytherin's eyes.
He knew sleep would lodged heavily in his joints and bones, but when he stretched, his body was more awake than ever. There wasn't the pounding headache that seemed to have temporary residence in his temple and the pinpricks of ache behind his eyelids. The sleep had been rejuvenating, so different from the lethargy that he'd always known ever since the hunt for horcrux. It was not a feeling he's familiar but just as welcoming. And to think it was because of Draco...
"What happened to him?" Harry was awake now, hurrying to put on his slippers but stopped short at the amused smirk on Neville's lips.
The amplifying potion felt so potent through Harry's veins, burning in their wake, tasting so vile and heavy on his tongue, grating on his nerves, obscuring his reasons. Harry repeatedly felt powerful under his anger and powerless under Draco. The feeling likened to a wild animal trapped behind a cage. While he wanted to rage at Draco, there was the helplessness in him that was caused by Draco's physical proximity.
And right now, he was terrified of having to deal with the same marred consequences. Harry could handle Dark Lords and Potions with Snape but emotions are on another, unreachable level.
"Mate, are you off your rocker?" Ron gaped at him incredulously. "How can you say it's a good idea? We're practically bound to the Slytherins—!"
Harry’s eyes glistened, shoulders stiff in an obvious attempt at preventing it from shaking. Draco wanted to comfort him, to touch him. When he raised his hand, Draco saw that it was trembling so he thought to put it back down. But Harry watched his hand, green eyes brimmed with unshed tears and longing. So Draco gently cradled Harry’s face in his palm, and Harry sighed.
"Malfoy."
"Harry?"
Harry scrambled for something,
Harry wanted to punch Malfoy as soon as he said those words. He wanted to get angry, to whip his wand out and sent a nasty hex at the blond's ugly, sneering face. But Harry forced a smile on his face, propelled by the
on his part!
"Just what?"
Pansy remained quiet, decidedly giving him the silence to ponder over the information. And Draco hated her for that. After a few hellish minutes, she spoke in a careful tone, “of course. There is no way of knowing. It’s a theory after all.”
"My Draco," she softly said, welcoming Draco with a hug, which Draco sagged against. Harry drifted his eyes away from the sight, feeling so much like an intruder. "It completely put me at ease to have you here, well and healthy, Draco. Though I suspected you haven't been eating and sleeping sufficiently."
Harry was met with a sight of Hermione and Ron bickering about Merlin knows what in the Gryffindor table. Harry sat in his usual place with a sullen sigh, staring at his best friends and grimacing at their daily dose of squabbling at the smallest of things. After the war, Ron and Hermione had decided they would continue to where they left off. And Harry was happy for them, sincerely, but there's just too much that Harry could tolerate in the couple's seven-year foreplay before he seriously feel sick.
"You're not seriously gonna psychoanalyze me or something."
"It's not even slavery, per se," Zabini drawled, sprawled on the loveseat opposite Harry's, looking bored. "Both the participants were under variations of emotion-stimulating and -repressing potions, but there is a power balance between the two as their emotions are congruous to each other."
"For this morning we will be discussing about the two variations of
Potter who had repeatedly defeated him in Quidditch, Potter who had a bunch of worshippers at his beck and call, Potter who was better at him in every single thing!
Potter admonished gently, his lips pursing and brows frowning in disapproval and it took all of Draco to not feel the need to contort Har—Potter's face back to it's pleasant,
Draco pulled his hand to Harry’s face, just as gently, and cupped it against Harry’s eyes. The touch was too soft, too delicate, and Harry breathed slowly, relishing the soothing feel of his elegant palm.
"To taunt me?" Draco asked softly. He was looking up at the heavy clouds overhead. The sharp breeze from the black lake and the oncoming drizzle whipped his blond hair, his cheeks and the tip of his nose tinted pink. "Make me feel like an utter shit? Tell me I deserved to get my father killed? That Lucius deserved what was coming for him?"
Ginny had brightened at that while Draco's arm around him tightened. Ginny nodded.
"Draco?" Harry called in as much casual voice he could muster.
“As you are. You still haven’t, since before the war,” Pansy said cynically, like a ruthless Professional mind-healer inanely pointing out the obvious. Draco’s lips tightened. More so at her next words: “Potter always brought out the best and worse of you, Draco.”
in his system. Malfoy must've seen something in his face because he tried to reach out to Harry, but the Gryffindor stood up and looked up at the grey clouds looming overhead, promising a drizzle.
He had just slept. He
“No, I—” Harry gulped. “He’s not actually a friend.”
"Do you want to go home, Draco?" Harry asked gently. Draco made a soft sound before he stood up and straightened some invisible wrinkles on his posh robes. He sniffed, turning up his nose and sneering at his father's casket one last time before he sharply pivoted out of the mausoleum, Harry following closely behind.
"I meant to say you were chastising me for purchasing the books
Of all things that was worth to fret over in Hermione's admission, it had to be that part. If it were Ron two years ago, he would've marched over her sister and gave her an earful about his anti-Slytherin prejudice.
idk what to make of this chapter. i dont normally like to write a chapter heavy on emotions but this needs to be done... i felt like i've overdone this chapter but at the same time i think something is seriously lacking. pls forgive me in advance im not really good at these things
(stream dynamite by bts, if you like kpop hehe)
"Because I let them in, Potter. Surely, your memory isn't so rusty as to forget how you acted like a good little Auror and tracked me down for the rest of the year?"
She stared up at Harry, her expression musing, "no Slytherins had ever jumped at anyone's defense other than their own, more so for a Gryffindor, and willingly take the brunt of a punishment."
Hermione slapped him gently on his arms and huffed, "I didn't know Purebloods have the same skewed perspective about gender and sexuality like Muggles. I certainly never expected it from you, Ron."
"Besides, you would be surprised who deigned to share your love for dear ol' Saturnine," Ron said as they sat at the Gryffindor Table, waiting for the rest of the students as it's still ten minutes away before breakfast starts.
"Have you not read Professor Snape's instructions about the Augmentare and Sedatus Potions?" Malfoy asked, sounding pleasant.
, calmly stood up and blurted philosophical things that weren't normally heard from him. This caused Malfoy to direct his hatred to Ron, and that propelled Zabini standing up too, interjecting how awful, wicked and rotten the blond was. Hermione stayed curling up in the sofa, eyes bright with tears.
"I'm just mocking you, silly."
Right. This is fucking weird.
"I mean, I still don't trust the git," Ron said. Hermione turned to him in warning. "What? You can't just take away the years of hating him, Hermione. He might've turned a new leaf, okay I'm all for that, but his presence still put me on edge. It's not so easy getting over those years. I'm not as forgiving as Harry here."
"I want to sleep," Harry quietly replied. Draco nodded his head. "I haven't slept for days." At Draco's sympathetic eyes, he added, "it's Halloween. I don't sleep on Halloween."
Malfoy so much.
Hermione disapprovingly frowned at him, "Harry, you can't be serious. You're not obsessing with Malfoy again!"
?" She asked disbelievingly.
"I will let you sleep," he repeated, more firmly. Harry didn't know if he could, but the assurance in Draco's voice invoked a wave of solace.
. The churning in Harry's stomach—that has nothing to do with potion now that he was completely sober—intensified, heavy with guilt and something akin to anger,
"No, it's my fault," Malfoy softly said in a broken whisper. "I was—I'm an... an asshole, to you, to Granger, to Weasley, to everyone," he was beginning to sound gibberish, "I shouldn't have said what I said in the lake! You don't deserve it. Please don't think... You're not... it's not—I'm so sorry..."
“And what did you feel? Was it the same as what you felt before when you flew?”
Harry remembered the disaster of his date with Cho in fifth year, and knew it would not bode well when Ginny said the cursed place. But Harry didn't want to quell the excitement and happiness in Ginny's eyes. It was the first positive emotion he'd seen on the girl's face. Begrudgingly, he acquiesced. With a final glare on Draco, Ginny turned and left.
With an already upset stomach, Harry flopped in his usual place in the Gryffindor table across from his two best friends. Ron was buttering his toast while Hermione was in the middle of unlatching the rolled Daily Prophet from the leg of the school's barn owl, which was gently nipping at her bushy hair. Harry picked a sausage, mindlessly stabbing it with his fork as his eyes moved along the Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw tables until they settled on the Slytherins', particularly seeking out Draco. He sat upright, shoulders tensed and jaws clenched. He was glaring at his plate as if the food offended him. His Slytherin cohorts who were usually chattering behind their cupped hands about whatever shenanigans they're up to, were now looking grave and staid. They also had their heads down, silently eating their breakfasts, though Bulstrode looked up to sneer at Harry and Nott gave him the two-finger salute. They probably knew what happened between Draco and him last night, Harry sighed.
To his surprise Malfoy interrupted him only five minutes in. “I think I understand now what you mean with the memory being present, but I… I can’t think of a good memory to use.” Malofy took a deep breath and then rushed out, “I can’t use my childhood memories, they have become too entangled in the war. No matter where I start I end up with father in Azkaban, with Mother slowly losing her mind in the Manor and I… I just can’t.”
He leans down, feathering kisses onto Harry’s neck, relishing in the moans escaping Harry. Feathering kisses turn bruising and Harry bucks his hips up to meet Draco’s. Taking that as his cue, Draco shifts off of him and slowly trails kisses along the line of Harry’s muscular torso, leaving love bites in his wake, his right hand caresses Harry’s ass, while his left is idly playing with Harry’s hair.
“Drink up.” Draco orders and Harry eyes the turquoise liquid. Recognising it as a sobriety potion, he drinks. The effects of the potion are minimal, as Harry hadn’t had that much alcohol. Yet he turns a tad nervous about what is about to happen. Nervous and excited.
Brewing without a sense of smell was weird, Harry kept expecting to smell something whenever a waft of steam hit his face, but he didn’t. Slightly irritated, he finished brewing and waited for Professor Sondulbas to make her rounds. She declared Harry’s potion as “well done” and bottled a vial for closer grading.
“Never have I ever fucked a guy” Draco said and swiftly downed another shot, raising the eyebrow again when Harry didn’t move to take his. “Well, well, well. Never have I ever been fucked then?” And despite it not being his turn and despite there being nothing wrong with his inexperience, Harry blushed at the question and shook his head. Draco reached across the table, took the shot out of Harry’s hand. “And yet, you want to ride a dragon. Interesting...” slurred Draco, throwing the shot back.
Potter, of course, did grab his hand and pulled him into a standing position. The skin to skin contact shocked Draco’s system and made him sway on the spot, which Harry seemed to interpret as Draco being too faint to walk by himself. So he pulled Draco’s arm over his shoulders, placing his own around Draco’s waist. Relishing in the contact and the resulting happy bond Draco simply leaned some of his weight onto Harry as if he was actually too weak to walk.
Clutching the strap of his book bag tighter, he moved to sit with Ron at their usual table. While he waited for the lesson to start, Harry placed his head on his arms, closing his eyes. The smoke always made his head hurt.
Harry partnered up with Neville and tried not to think about Malfoy’s analysis.
“I understand that the sound may be frightening at first, but I promise you it doesn’t hurt. Try slamming the ground with a flat hand if you don’t believe me.”
Potter had apparently pulled himself out of his own shock and raised an eyebrow at the friendly greeting. He chuckled slightly and nodded towards his companion, “This little man here”, he answered, bringing the boys attention to them.
They met yet again on Tuesday after dinner, Malfoy had said he needed to work on letting his memories become present and had left shortly after Harry cast his own Patronus on Friday. Harry didn’t interrupt the others' concentration upon entering this time. He simply sat down and started working on his transfiguration assignment.
As an afterthought he added, “I might show them to you, some day.”
Neville perked up. “Your father didn’t even live to see your birth?” he sounded incredulous.
Draco managed to reach the 4th floor before collapsing into an alcove — the world swimming out of focus.
They entered the common room and Hermione offered him to join her at the study table to get started on the new assignment. This was something Draco could do, so he nodded and went to the table.
Draco in return only huffed and shuffled into the bathroom, clearly not a morning person. Harry carefully categorized that info, although he didn’t know why he bothered. Harry left the room so his roommate could wake up properly, and went to put his prepared bread in the oven.
. The fact that Potter had also nearly killed him, was conveniently ignored by his brain.
His run-ins with Potter usually happened sometime in the morning, that way Draco was fine through most of their classes and the side effects of the pull didn’t bother him too much in the evening. Since the eighth year consisted of so few students, they had nearly every class together. So on weekdays, Draco simply waited for their classes to start before easily arranging some sort of run-in with Potter.
Apparently taking it as a challenge, Draco answers, “Oh trust me. I know what I’m doing.” and grinds against Harry for a moment. Draco pulls back again and resumes his questioning.
"There is a ritual that allows the bond to be altered." Kreacher explained. "However it involves a complete sealing of the bond."
"I—alright. Alright, let's try to be friends."
That's when it hit Draco like a herd of Erumpets. Merlin's balls, Potter described the Mark as a fucking
Draco shook his head:
Draco headed to the break room, strode right past his office, just like he did every morning. Harry wasn't coherent until he'd had some tea. And he was a lousy partner when he wasn't coherent, so Draco made him a cup every morning. It was as easy to follow as breathing—though Draco found breathing quite difficult at times. Only when he thought about Harry too long. Which was always. His chest shrunk further, pressing into his lungs.
The first year he'd floated through, barely even felt any of it. He was still hurting from losing Harry and there were times he was almost glad for his cell. It was as cold and hostile on the outside as he felt on the inside.
The rash had started splotching out visibly already. Of course it had. Draco squirmed. Harry was
"That's a loaded question." Harry affirmed. "Before—I think you were jealous to some degree, but
He was bouncing on his feet, antsy and worried, pleading with the powers that be for Draco to be safe.
Draco at this point.
Harry had no idea what to do.
Kreacher stared at Harry's splotched arm for a moment, then explained:
"I'm home." He muttered meekly as he came closer, looking a right mess.
"Now, talk." Ron barked after a few minutes and Draco looked down to where his hands were gripping the broom.
But it was awkward. Especially since, they had to return to Hogwarts the day after tomorrow.
"They'll thank us...
Harry quickly assessed his body language once more. He wasn't shaking, his eyes were focused and calm, he wasn't molting and he'd peeled away from the wall. His arms were still loosely curled against his chest, but his entire posture lost the tremble and taut strain.
"How long was I out anyways?" Harry's brows furrowed. He expected perhaps a day or so, given the way things were.
Finnigan, Thomas, Abbott, Davis-
Harry almost didn't even hear him—he was still reeling, while Malfoy read the next question:
Potter laughed, long and merry. Draco was certain something had popped somewhere—it wasn't him, he swears!
She also sent Sam a gift basket, even though that entire night turned out to be one huge lucky coincidence in the end. The boy got Draco thinking at least, which was more than Narcissa had managed with her thick boy for a long time.
"Mr.Potter? Are you alright?" The woman waved her hand in front of his face and Harry snapped out of it and nodded shakily. "I was asking whether there was anywhere you could stay while we do our work around here?"
Harry laughed:
face Draco.
"Wait—
"How did you even start telling Ted everything?"
"Okay, so the way to do this is to stand as you did during your wedding." Ginny instructed and Draco and Astoria took their positions and clasped their hands.
All the blonde really learned from this is that being around Potter made him emotional and way more invested in things he ordinarily would care little about, such as goddamn homework.
"You were having a—nightmare, I think, and your magic, it went shit out of control, almost leveled the house to the ground. But I managed to—get here and wake you."
Sam knew Draco as well as he could have gotten to know him in the few months Draco kept him around for sex.
"Anyways, as I was saying!" Teddy emphasized the point by crossing his arms across his chest. "Is it true you were viciously attacked by a hippogriff and managed to get away only with a broken arm?" Teddy's eyes were wide with wonder.
Malfoy read the next one:

"Nonsense. I am perfectly composed."

"Huh? Sorry, I trailed off." He flushed a bit and expected Draco to roll his eyes, but—Draco didn't. Instead he smiled, the smallest of grins, and repeated himself:
Harry mewled softly as Draco pet through his hair, tightening his hold on Draco, whom sighed softly into Harry's mouth.
By the time Godric and Salazar emerged into the tower that Potter and Parkinson were headed to, the kids were already there, as was Malfoy.
Ron snorted as he put his uniform on:
Draco dropped his forehead to the edge of the bed, a soft, pained whimper so quiet Harry wouldn't have heard it if he didn't feel overly sensitive and hyperfocused on everything grazing out his throat.
"Of course."

"He'll start Hogwarts soon, he'll get out there more and people will talk, about you and his family, me and his parents. I just want him to know the truth before any of that gets to his head."
"Is there something you've dreamed of doing for a long time? Why haven't you done it?"
"I don't tend to sleep well, and it's important to know not to try to wake me—because my magic gets a bit out of control." He said, figuring that to be the one thing that he'd had to lecture all his dormmates on.
The raven sneered himself, and briskly made it over to Draco, grabbed his shoulder and jerked him backwards. Before he dragged Draco away, Harry glared at Goldstein whose lip was curled up at them both.
Harry was perplexed. Malfoy had to be up to something, why else would he suddenly ask for help?
, careful to keep the ends at the same length. He enters the dojo with the customary bow and nearly stops dead in his tracks. Kneeling next to Malcolm is no one else other than Draco Malfoy, his posture rigid and his belt black. His platinum blond hair is tightly braided to his head, the braid stopping just between his shoulder blades.
The three of them went white.
Draco shook his head. It was best he left now, he'd been loitering around for far too long anyways.
Draco pleaded, throat dry as sand, shivers passing through him while a violent need tore at his insides, igniting every part of him.
Harry let himself smile:
Malfoy swallowed then spoke, his voice much more subdued:
Draco breathed deeply with a newfound determination, his many doubts dispelled with the breeze.
Harry shook his head to clear it of the fog and sat up:

Yes, that's good. Well, it

in them?" Pansy shot back.
He guessed Draco was much the same, though he stoically kept quiet and never uttered a word about it.
Once McGonagall came through on the Firecall, Draco swallowed the bile rising up his throat and forced his voice out:
His eyes were burning with a desperate, pent rage and Harry pressed his lips into a thin line as he slowly released his grip on Draco's wand arm. He gave him a curt nod, but hissed his mind through his teeth:
The flush. The hitch of breath.
Harry pointedly impressed upon Ron who just nodded hurriedly:
Draco and Harry both jumped apart, whirling around to face their inevitable
He blinked a few times and pushed himself up by his arms, turning around to glare at Pansy:
"Draco? What of it?" Ron repeated his question.

Draco shrugged:

but Harry perhaps just hadn't noticed?
That Harry loved him, but couldn't ever let him know.
"Alohomora this." He pointed at it and Malfoy obeyed without complaint, his wand hand trembling slightly still.
Harry clenched his jaw and gripped his wand tighter.
"Wait no!" He urgently muttered, snapping out of the whorl of emotions that overtook him at first. Ron startled and flinched back. "Those aren't ordinary chains, if you cast a spell they just squeeze him tighter." Draco explained.
"You will." He affirmed merrily.
Harry's chest swelled with anticipation of Draco's answer. Regardless of what it was, Harry and Pansy would proceed, but Harry still found his heart beating in his throat.
"Merlin and Morgana." Draco echoed Harry's thoughts while Kreacher dropped the likely twenty pound heavy tome onto the table, a loud thunk echoing around, then clearing off their plates and popping off.
He didn't need to look at the blonde to know he'd gone just as frozen as Harry.
Harry's world dissolved into a blinding white of a supernova blast and his eyes fell closed of their own accord, he couldn't help but press harder, his lips molding into Draco's. Harry  felt a hand grapple the collar of his shirt, gripping and bunching it into a fist, his own hand laying over Draco's on his shirt.
"Welcome, students, to Hogwarts. Those returning, and those new here." She started speaking, voice carrying through the hall without any charms necessary. Everyone always listened with rapt attention when Minerva McGonagall talked. She held a short, concise speech about all the changes and rooming arrangements which were hung up on the doors of the Great Hall so that everyone could take a look on their way out.
He wasn’t willing to explain that Mister Malfoy was his father, not him. That that was what his father had expected his “underlings” to call him, what his father had told him to carry as an honour. It didn’t feel honorable anymore, just dirty. The war and his family's actions had erased all traces of respect from his former pride. What remained was nothing but a reminder of his mistakes. And a reminder of his father.
“Malfoy?” came Harry’s concerned voice from seemingly far away.
“Can’t be”
Malfoy looks dead serious about it, not a single hint of mockery. No, instead his eyes wander across Harry’s body, and Harry finally understands what people mean when saying ‘undressing someone with your eyes’. At a loss for words, Harry just stares at Malfoy, mouth slightly open.
And as Draco looked at Harry with a sparkle in his eyes and excitement spraying from every fibre of his being, Harry blurted out, “Merlin I wanna kiss you.”
“Feel free to step through right away once you are done. I will be overseeing a detention tonight and the office will be empty.” McGonagall informed him.
What felt like hours later, the two pulled apart, desperately gasping for air. Harry leaned his head onto Draco’s shoulder, his legs still bracketing Draco’s, while Draco had his hands resting lightly on his waist. They just sat there, relishing in the bliss of the rather fantastic snog they just shared.
When they entered his flat Draco led Harry over to the couch in his living room then went to set the kettle on the stove to make some tea. When the tea was done, he pushed the warm mug into Harry’s hands and set some scones on the living room table before he joined Harry on the couch. He grabbed a scone and offered the second one to Harry who silently took it.
They had seen maybe half of the stands when Draco turned to Harry, “Thank you for coming with me. This is wonderful.” He said, smiling so warmly at Harry that the dark haired man felt his heart clench.
“You okay?” Harry asked, concerned. “The Great Hall freaking you out again?”
Pansy was true to her word, when Draco reached the study table in the common room there were only 4 people present. Pansy, Granger and Hannah Abbott he had expected, Blaise however was a surprise and a pleasant one at that. He would at least treat him well enough and while they weren't considered close anymore, they had been at one point.
“Good one. But I was talking about how we’ve been cuddling at night for the past weeks. Or well you hugging me in your sleep mostly.”
'Promise me to try, Draco',  he thought and instead of heading straight back to his dorm, his eyes searched for an empty table. Luckily he found one next to the wall, a bit away from the others. So he sat down and opened his book. He really needed to finish that damn essay.
He smiled, “Hello Teddy, it’s so nice to meet you. My name is Draco. What can I help you with today?”
And with the pleading look from Pansy and the enraged concern coming off of Hermione, Draco could only nod again.
Draco lay his utensils down and looked her straight in the eye, “Pansy, please. You’ve been bringing up food for me for weeks now. I know you’ve been trying to get some variety but it honestly isn’t your fault that I can’t bring myself to go to dinner. I’m really really grateful for your help, please don’t feel bad that it’s not a freaking feast every day. I don’t mind the sandwiches.” He picks his fork up again before adding, “Besides, it really isn’t supposed to be your concern in the first place.”
“I gather you know each other?” Chris asks him after a moment.
Saturday, November 28th 1998, evening:
Christmas morning Draco woke to presents from his mother, and an angry bond. His insides felt as if they were being pulled out of his chest, his hands and feet were ice-cold.
“Uhm. How about we ask for a place to talk?” Potter asked, voice full of uncertainty, when they finally stood in front of the empty wall.
Excited chatter rose around the room and stool legs scraped on the wooden floor. Harry looked underneath his chair only to find the name “Draco Malfoy” written on it. He dropped the chair as if it was burning him. From across the room he heard his name in a signature drawl. When he raised his head to look at Malfoy, the git only rolled his eyes and pointedly stared at the empty seat across from him.
“Yes!” moaned Draco in reply.  Draco stopped his teasing of Harry’s one nipple and moved his left hand down to Harry’s belt, hooking his fingers through a loop. Draco pushed himself off the door and pulled Harry to his bedroom.
Draco had felt the same way in the beginning, but he had found another motivation for studying the runes. Without really thinking about it, he started talking, “Yeah, but once you’ve got the hang of the runes you can start incorporating the runes into your everyday life or different fields of magic. There’s a reason why every wandmaker and alchemist has a deep understanding of ancient and contemporary runes. They still hold power and can be especially useful in magical fields with a focus on creation.”
“That… seems a rather time sensitive issue indeed,” croaked Draco. “At least if you see yourself getting with this guy somewhere in the near future.” He cleared his throat, trying to get rid of the dry feeling the news had left in it.
When Draco had nearly reached the door he turned  around again. “Professor? Why are you trying to help me?”
“Erm… I mean… If you wouldn't mind?” Potter said to him and oh. He wasn’t opposed to the idea? Mind reeling, Draco realised that this could be his chance to make up for all his wrongdoings against the man.
What?
The familiar gesture helped Draco to calm down, and after a few minutes his sobbing turned into sniffing and his breathing became a bit more regular.
“Did it scar?” The words were barely a whisper, just a broken and painful inquiry.
He felt himself nod and then muttered, “Sure.” not having really processed what had just happened.
This month of hiding had taken its toll on him. Draco had begun to avoid the crowded Great Hall, skipping essentially every meal except breakfast and the occasional snack he took from the breakfast table. He had gotten thinner, his lean body began to look gaunt.
Draco snapped his head around to look him in the eyes, “I am not going to cuddle with you!” he started protesting, but Harry just pushed him to the side a bit.
“THREE times a week?” Potter spluttered indignantly.
“Oh sure. Uhm. Never have I ever had a crush on someone I shouldn’t have.” he said, not reaching for his own glass.
We will have to wait and see.
It didn’t matter that Harry hadn’t behaved any differently that morning compared to any other morning before their kiss. Or at least that was what Draco told himself as he ascended the stairs to the Headmistresses office.
He turned in his seat to face Potter, “I… What?” His originally intended question refused to form on his lips the first time and he tried again, “Why would I be happy if you died?”
A soft “Malfoy?” pulled him out of his research 20 minutes later. When he looked up he saw Granger looking at him almost apologetically. “Could you help me with this specific rune? Pansy said you likely finished  the assignment already.” She pushed her parchment to him and pointed at the rune she meant.
“Not necessarily. I’m not exactly opposed to it but I am more into marks. Lovebites, bruises, rope marks…. that kind of stuff. That and some power play, some bondage.” Draco shakes his head and with more determination asks, “You’ve never tried choking then?”
