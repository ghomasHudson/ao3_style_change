“I forget that, I forget that you’re no longer the boy that needs me to fix things for him. Just be careful. Potter may be genuine but those around him will not be thrilled with your union. I’m sure.”
“He has been doing so for years, Harry, how did you start calling Father Uncle in the space of a night? Please don’t get me wrong, I’m very happy but I’m curious as to how”
“Not at all, my dear, sweet, lady. It is far too long since I was graced with a glimpse of your beauty. Your husband keeps you far too close”
“Beyond my own experiences with an abusive parental figure you mean. I have been reading a great many muggle medical books in childhood mental health” Severus admitted his sallow cheeks burning brightly at the admission. Remus had no doubt that his eyes would be full of love for the man in this moment. How anyone could miss the loving nature the man possessed was beyond him. “The wizarding world is sadly lacking. I never had much of a childhood myself, I was expected to be an adult too soon, like Harry, I feared that if I didn’t research I would not be able to help in the way that he needed”
“Something, awful, I am not sure how but somehow the will of Lord and Lady Potter has been tampered with. Can you heck to see if there is any spells or compulsions? There is also a spell that Lily created we need to see if it can be trusted” Albus said while Filius  looked around his eyes coming to rest on Harry.
“Harry? Are you okay?” Draco asked immediately as he saw them arrive and Harry moved away from Narcissa his cheeks burning red.
“He is rather looking forward to his wand. He says it makes him a proper wizard.” Harry chuckled thinking of his and Draco’s late-night conversation about the different types of wands and if he would have a similar one to either his father or mother. Severus heard the tail end of his statement and lifted an eyebrow asking,
“I want to kill them” Her dragon whispered suddenly speaking for pretty much the first time since the healer had been. A glance to her left told her that Harry had fallen to sleep his body held at an unnatural angle because of the brace.
” Josephine flicked her tongue wildly closer and closer to the lightning shaped scar on his forehead and Harry hissed in pain moving away from the snake head and clutching his head as his body felt as though it were on fire. “
“I see.” She hummed quietly looking over at Severus, who was studying the ceiling of the hall with great interest twin spots of red appearing on his cheeks, with a cat like smile and something nudged its way into Harry’s mind, but he didn’t know what it was all about. “Well, it is lovely to meet you, sit yourselves down”.
“You were on the ship for all of five minutes! We went on a cruise when our little Dragon started learning about piracy. He wanted nothing more. Even with Severus’ best potions he couldn’t stay aboard. And that was his sad end to his life of piracy”
“I forget how little you know of our world sometimes Harry. Do you know of the Summer King and his spring maiden?” Remus asked both ignoring Draco who was exhausting himself gushing over how accurate his pirate outfit was. It was truly an amazing thing if Harry were honest with a tri-corner hat and a cutlass that appeared to be real. The sleek blue tailcoat hugged his frame and he even had a fake wooden leg that when attached made his real leg seemingly vanish.
“...There...” Draco huffed pleased continuing to angle to hit that spot over and over while Draco’s hand slipped around his body and pumped him in time with the frantic thrusting. A white haze came over his mind everything but the pleasure he was feeling slipped away until he was chanting Draco’s name over and over. “I’ve always wanted to hear you shouting my name Potter...Always thought you’d do it well”
“We’re friends regardless of House.” Harry added with a small at the Irish boy and they seemed to be proven right when they sat at the far end of the Ravenclaw table, and nobody even battered an eyelid. It was a happy lunch with the four old friends happily chatting with their three new ones and it was made even brighter when the twins and Lee Jordon came over to them.
“What did she tell you mother? It must have been bad...” Draco said as he and his mother made their way through the back alley. All of the houses looked the same except for one. Smoke was pouring out of the chimney and the curtains were drawn. Cats, many of them, were sitting watchfully in the garden and Draco realised that they were at least half kneazle and it was likely that they acted as spies for the squib living in the home.
“Very good, Mr Malfoy.” She said before once again moving around the classroom. All in all, it wasn’t an overly taxing lesson, but it wasn’t as fun as Nino’s had been. There were given some homework on the principles of Transfiguration and then dismissed. They headed to the Ravenclaw dorm alone, Alice and Chao-Xiang having gone to speak with some girls from Hufflepuff. The common room was fuller than it had been the night before, but nobody paid them attention as they made their way to their room to dump their bags on their beds or rather, bed.
“Oh, come on Harry! I’ve read the papers! It’s all the gossip section has been going on about since you arrived back in the UK…Plus you had that whole huge crush on him back in school…Can’t really understand it myself but…Each to their own.” She laughed loving the look on his face her blue eyes dancing with merriment reminding him of her brothers, mostly the twins. Harry let out a laugh of his own the weight of the world leaving his shoulders when finally, the waiter came with their menus. “Oh! Great I’m absolutely starving! You’re paying right Harry?”
“There was no satisfaction to be had, but I had to see the truth with my own eyes” Severus admitted his dark eyes moving to Potter...Harry, who was being held in a gentle hug. It was as though the boy had fallen to sleep against Narcissa and he felt a sting of guilt for the distress he had caused. “Petunia was always jealous of Lily. She wrote to Dumbledore once begging to be allowed to go. Dumbledore handled it with all the tact you would expect. The jealousy festered and became hate. I have no doubt that Dumbledore thought some family bonds would come into play but there was none in her heart. Perhaps if the boy were a squib, she would have maybe cared for him at least some”
“Its just a friendly but the Honeysuckle Hummingbirds really are Japans best team and they only have one male. The keeper. Almost all are in the Japanese national team though the seeker is from Thailand” Draco commented stepping into the fire with Harry and taking enough Floo powder for them both before shouting “The Rose Stadium, Green Entrance, Ireland!”
“I want the spell to be checked! By an independent witness! I have no idea how they have done it but they have twisted Harry against me! It cannot be allowed! They were in the inner circle of the Dark lord, even you people must understand!”
“Not at all, Lady Malfoy. The spell itself seems rather straight forward. A prick of the finger that is all...”
“Parkinson, hardly surprising that you are with Malfoy, always wanting to be Lady Malfoy, ever since you were a little girl, but those…” Thomas growled sending his own look of disgust at the two Weasley’s and Seamus. Seamus was bubbling away with anger, but he was even shorter than Harry was, and Harry didn’t want him to get hurt.
“I know you have to say that Harry because you are living with him, but it’s quite alright, we’re friends you can tell the truth. Don’t you think Crow has a head shaped like a muggle lightbulb? The top of his head is much bigger than the bottom”
“Yer got some kind of problem, pal?” The Irish boy was smaller than Harry, but he was bulky from years of boxing. Ronan Finnegan was proud that his son had followed in his mother’s footsteps and had inherited magic, but he had wanted something between them, and they had fallen on boxing which had recently started becoming kickboxing, so even at eleven it was clear that there was muscle under his robes. Ronald’s face almost immediately matched his hair as he looked around for support before shrugging and gesturing to his and Harry’s joined hands. Immediately, Harry started to pull away in embarrassment, but Draco held him tightly. “What about it?”
Birthdays had never been important to Harry Potter. The Dursleys’ never celebrated them  he only knew what day he was born because of a school project so when he woke on the morning of his tenth birthday to a package wrapped in silver and green paper he was surprised to say the least. He thought it was a mistake at first but his name was written on the tag with swirly writing. Didn’t know how his Uncle hadn’t seen it when he had gone to work that morning but he picked it up and ran his finger over his name. The package seemed to tingle as he touched it and Harry let out a breath before taking it inside and tiptoeing to his cupboard. Once inside he hid the package under the thin sheet he had for a blanket and then hurried to the kitchen where his Aunt was shouting at him to wash the dishes from breakfast before getting out into the garden to pull the weeds.
So! This chapter went in a completely different direction to what I thought it would. I wasn’t expecting Ginny and Victor but that was the way it flowed! I hope you enjoyed!
“Maybe there is some Slytherin in you, Harry. We should have time to see at least the Quetzalcoatl before we must meet the others” Severus chuckled leading them down a winding path between other enclosures that had dozen of strange animals. The zoo was so vast that Harry was sure it would take days to see everything, but he kept looking here and there gasping as he saw unicorns and beasts that had the body of horses but the heads of birds. The reptile house came into view with the Dragon mountain standing proud behind the sign that proudly declared they had a breeding pair of Welsh Green Dragons Harry was more interested in the painting of what appeared to be a serpent that had feathers.
“You adults are the worst!” Draco’s clipped voice spoke out suddenly as he pushed in between Harry and his father. “You can see that Harry is panicking and yet all you do is ask questions. He doesn’t know you, why would you think he would answer you? No adult as believed him before, have they Harry? And now Dumbledore is here saying that those...Muggles forgive him! They should be begging for Harry’s forgiveness! Harry, ignore them, you don’t have to answer them if you don’t want to, just tell them were you would like to stay and then we can go and have more of Jinx’s hot chocolate in the kitchen while they argue until they are blue in the face”
“Aww, and you’re like the little brother I always wanted!” Pansy laughed throwing her arm around him and squeezing him tightly before they had to go their separate ways. Pansy and the Gryffindors to the DADA classroom and Harry and the Ravenclaws to the transfiguration one further down the hall.
“Don’t know but I’m sure Remus will go over it. Would you like a chocolate wand?” Draco asked pulling one from the pocket of his robe and Harry gave a laugh and a nod. His friend never asked him about his sessions with his doctor, but he was always ready with sweets to calm him down after. “Are you excited? You might finally be able to learn the guitar, if the teacher Madame knows is any good”
Once upon a time there was a Boy. The boy had raven hair, tanned skin, and the most beautiful green eyes that had ever been. Boy had no name. In the little village of Privet, he was known simply as boy. He had been brought up as servant to Master Vernon Dursley and Mistress Petunia Dursley. They were not the wealthiest family in Privet, but they did flaunt what wealth they did have. Boy was overworked and beaten almost daily by his masters, but his heart remained light and he shouldered the chores for the moments he could spend in the forest with his friends. A wolf he had named Moony and a cantankerous crow he had named Severus. More recently there was another friend he had made. A boy with blonde hair and blue-grey eyes who helped him with his chores and taught him to read and write. Draco. Draco was clearly from a wealthy family and yet unlike Dudley, his master’s son, he never shied away from work. Boy wasn’t stupid he knew that nothing could come of it, but he enjoyed the time he had in the forest with Draco.
“Oh? Don’t worry about him, he’s my pet…He does whatever I tell him, don’t you Kingsley?” She said softly and the Auror leapt to attention.
“Yes! Please father!” Draco beamed as Lucius rose from the table gracefully and took his coffee in one hand and the newspaper in the other. Lucius nodded serenely at him and gave a smile.
Alpha-Prince Draco Malfoy ran from the palace with anger pulsating through him causing his normally softly spicy scent to smell like burnt sugar and ash. Part of it was anger that soon the palace would be teeming with omega all desperate to try and win him and part was because of his out-of-control hormones. He knew that was the reason he should be mated as soon as possible, he was reaching his maturity and without an omega to help him through his first rut, his father would see him as a threat around his mother. He had been unimpressed with the courtly omegas that had already been presented to him and those that had been brought from distant lands so now his parents were turning to the commoners in the hopes of getting him a mate. It wouldn’t work, he knew that because his inner fox had already decided on a mate. At least he was sure it had.
Umeda introduced the idea of a wand to Japan during one of the many wars that were fought between seven lords. She believed that being able to focus her magic into a wand would be the best way to help her lover when against his enemies. It worked, with her help he defeated all six of the other lords and gained all their land. Following on Umeda’s example more people started using wands, but it was difficult and dangerous so Umeda decided that a school would be the best way to teach people her way of doing magic. When it was first opened it was only for those that were loyal to Emperor Hashimoto and Umeda and lived nearby. Umeda taught at the school until her death, her descendant teaches at the school today his name is Matsumoto Jun and he has the rather impressive eyebrows”
“Severus…I…” Whatever Remus may have been about to say was stalled by Harry and then Draco falling into the room through the floo, they were followed quickly by the Weasley twins, Pansy, and Nino and a man they didn’t know.
“No, you were having fun, Draco. It’s silly to stop. I just need a drink. I’ll be back in a few minutes…”
“Dear Draco, thank you so much for the family tree. I don’t really understand it but I am really grateful. I promise your secret is safe with me, I have nobody I could share it with anyway. You don’t have to bother your godfather, I’m very happy with what I’ve already gotten. Mrs Figg has told my aunt and uncle that I am helping her clean out her attic so she has gotten me out of the house and away from my cousin and his friends so I can read those books you have me.
“We will see you at Yule, Harry, enjoy yourself and take care of each other” She said as Harry breathed in her perfume. She gave him another kiss and then handed him off to Lucius who smiled and gave him a one armed hug.
“I wouldn’t have been as happy as I am with you, Dray” Harry said with so much feeling it felt as though the words had been punched out of him. Even talking about a world were he and Draco were anything other than friends was enough to choke him.
“I know, Pops” He sighed trying to smile but failing. His mind healer had been able to explain why he was so scared of something that should have brought excitement. It was hard to step out of the comfortable, warm bubble that had been created in manor. That he was afraid that if he left then he wouldn’t be able to go back and that he would end up going back to the Dursley’s.
“Muggles use them to travel I believe, it is not something that is needed in the wizarding world, Harry”
“Of course. Now run along” Lucius ruffled his constantly messy hair and then headed towards the breakfast room leaving Harry to run upstairs and get dressed. Draco was splayed out, starfish style, in the centre of the double bed his face buried in between the pillows. His soft grey night clothes rumpled as he snored lightly. Harry watched him as he dressed and wondered if he should try to wake him only to be stopped by Pansy coming through the adjoining door. She was dressed in a nightdress with a yawning cat in a nightcap on the front. Her bob cut was sticking out at odd angles and she was carrying a blue teddy bear by one foot. She looked at him through sleep crusted eyes and then dropped down into the bed, half on top of Draco who grunted in weak protest before moaning about ankle biting terrapins trying to steal his cupcakes and Harry let out a laugh deciding to let his best friends sleep.
“Uncle Sev” Harry hummed when he was chopping some mint leaves with a silver knife. Ever since that first day of potions with Severus Harry had fallen in love. It was like cooking and he had always enjoyed cooking. The Malfoy potions room was in a dungeon under the kitchen lit by old style torches that shone with a strange green/blue flame that didn’t seem to give off any heat. Draco enjoyed potions as well but not nearly as much as Harry and he found the simple potions boring so he had left an hour or more ago while Harry had stayed.
“Draco, it’s not...Normal for muggles to sleep in cupboards but I’ve always slept in the cupboard under the stairs. The Dursley’s have always told me that freaks don’t deserve bedrooms...Sorry, can you forget I said anything? It’s not important, its just a place to sleep...”
“Yes! Yes, very good! Take a point for Gryffindor…Now, Harry…Swish and Flick…Your father Remus was an excellent charms student...And I see you have his grace! Very good now combine the spell with the movements…Wing-Gar-di-um Levi-o-sa!”
“Kingsley helped. He took a potion that would make him seem to be under a compulsion spell and I…I said things…I told her that Harry was with us and that we had tricked him to believing that we were friends. I am so sorry Harry. It was a lie and I hated saying such things, but I assure you it was needed…”
“And they still wanted you to have the boy. Dumbledore can go suck a lemon drop, since he is so fond of them”
“Yes…” Harry saw a small brown snake laid near the glass close to him and slowly he made his way over and cleared his throat focusing on the snake before whispering “Good morning”
“Dobby! Stop that at once! Rocky!” Lucius barked for another elf who appeared with a crack looking at Dobby with his lip curled before saying with a bow;
“The snow, I’ve never seen it like this…Except on Christmas cards” Harry explained. He wasn’t afraid of Lucius in any shape or form, but he was a little shy and embarrassed sometimes, more so when he felt like he was saying something stupid.
“Yes, I imagine that a great many people are surprised that the greasy, dour, evil dungeon bat could possibly have feelings of a romantic nature.”
“That is something people rarely say, mostly because he rarely allows people to see it. Even Pants has never seen that side of my father. That he allows you means he likes you Harry. I’m glad, I want you to be happy here, I’m sorry about how I acted yesterday...After the visit from the healer, I acted cold towards you. I have a difficult time expressing myself sometimes...” He said quickly needing to say it but not wanting to upset Harry any more than he probably already had done last night. “I was angry, with your so called family for what they have done to you, but the will pay, Harry, one way or another, you are my friend and I will never let anyone get away with hurting my friend”
“I got six. Mine is still in my pocket and I owled one to Pansy already. I thought perhaps you might want to invite the Weasley twins”
“Yeah, but he doesn’t look nearly as good as you” Twin winks were sent in his direction and Harry rolled his eyes moving to attach a large collar of flowers around Moony’s neck. The wolf gave him a stare but accepted it yawning as he got up and stretched out his back. Severus let out a shrill sound fluffing out his wings and Harry laughed.
“Thank-you, I’m sorry for coming by unannounced. I did mean to send an owl ahead, but I thought I would come and see you directly. I went to see Dumbledore today. He sent another owl and I thought that I would respond to it. He knows that Severus and I were in Hogsmeade the other day with Harry and he is willing to take steps to make sure that I am no longer around Harry” Harry felt the werewolf’s amber eyes come to rest on him and he gave the man a smile while Severus barked out
“If you took a little longer you wouldn’t look like a pug in a wig.” Draco huffed under his breath while making sure she heard him, and Pansy shot back quickly.
“Very good brat, now this needs to be left alone for the night, now off you pop, I’m sure Draco is anxious to get you both into some trouble”
“Crow always does his peacock impression. Have you seen enough of the Snakes Harry? I want to see the Cheshire Cats!” Pansy said grabbing a hold of both their arms and dragging them away from the pretty green snake who, when Draco looked back, seemed to be waving the tip of her tail. He found himself waving back ignoring his mother’s and Pansy’s confused looks while Narcissa said;
“it was a birthday present, you’re not going to take it away from me are you?” he whispered fearfully and the woman smiled shaking her head putting his book back down before ruffling his hair.
“Stop it!” Harry whined grabbing his pillow and slamming it into Draco’s face. Not hard but hard enough to shut up the blonde boy. Draco huffed his hair flopping over his face before his eyebrows narrowed. “Sorry!”
“By what?” Draco asked the question but the way he smirked told Harry that he knew and he mentally growled knowing the Slytherin wasn’t going to stop peening but he couldn’t help but saying happily; “Blonde hair and grey eyes. Shut up and kiss me...”
The fear of having a wand with the same core as Voldemorts was now gone as Harry basked in the feeling of being complete with his wand. It felt, perfect, all the different parts making up this one wonderful whole. He beamed at his fathers and then the Malfoy’s and Pansy before grinning wide at Draco who flashed him back his own smile saying,
“Of course, a little friendly competition is never a bad thing, it keeps you on your toes. Speaking of toes, you are out here without even your slippers or socks. Your feet must be freezing, come on in and go get dressed. Why are you laughing?” A blonde eyebrow lifted a confused, yet pointed look flashing over the handsome face.
“Of course, Potter would want that. Even in death he wanted to be the centre of attention. He got his wish. The entire wizarding world mourned for him and still do” Severus scoffed though there was no real bite to his words. Maybe, if he had never gotten to know the potion’s master Harry would have been hurt by the words but now, he realised that Severus used sarcasm as a defence.
“Beats camping, so are you going to wash my back? I can’t reach it myself...” Harry turned so said back was facing him and Draco found himself looking at the perfect globed bum before walking forward.
“The Hummingbirds played well, but the Legion are getting better! They are a newer team and the manager isn’t used to telling them what to do” He said and Fred and George were happily telling him how they had been thrashed, while cheerfully admitting they had been supporting the Legion.
“We went to the snakes” Harry answered his cheeks turning a little pink. Draco sent him a questioning look and Harry whispered that he would tell him later. “What are Chimera?”
“Yes, I am rather surprised myself, but father says that life is funny that way. Always better to be surprised by life” Pansy shrugged with almost as much class and grace as Narcissa would use only she was a little immature and stuck her tongue out adding “At least I have friends, unlike you. Your daddy still paying for your friends?”
“Yes! La-Narcissa” Harry spluttered over her name his cheeks filled with a rosy red colour his hand nervously moving to his neck only to be caught and held by Draco’s. The blonde boy swung their hands back and forth telling his mother all about the game as they walked back to the beautiful manor Harry’s heart full wondering if he had ever been this happy before.
“I finished early and decided to come watch. Hey guys” Remus said nodding to everyone. Harry could tell that the man was awkward. Things had been very awkward between them all since Remus and Severus had deepened their relationship. Harry had felt strange around them. He didn’t want to feel that way, but he couldn’t stop Vernon’s voice in his head. He hadn’t even been able to tell his mind healer about it and he had been able to talk about almost everything else. “Its okay that I came, right?”
If somebody had told Draco a few years ago that he would be sitting in the leaky cauldron having a rather pleasant late luncheon with Harry Potter he would have had them immediately admitted to St Mungos for evaluation and yet here he was. Harry had changed greatly since school. He had filled out and although he wouldn’t be winning tallest man there was something altogether rather pleasant about his new appearance.
He was the reason I started writing in the first place so I lost all motivation what with losing Paul in November then my father in January then I started working on my original novel which I hope to publish through amazon in memory of my father. BUT I am hoping that I will have a new chapter of penpal out for you in February
“We give thanks to the earth for magic and having enough to eat to get us through the winter” Remus shrugged running his fingers through his hair and causing it to flop lazily over one eye. Like Severus he was looking healthier. Although he never went into details Harry knew that the potions his dad made him each month was helping his transformations. “It is mostly pureblood families that take part in the ritual, but the Malfoy’s have said that we can join their family with theirs. Severus will be joining us as well so you will get to be involved in your first ritual”
“Then trust me, mother, father, Severus and Lupin won’t stop until they figure this out, I promise” Draco promised him his lips ghosting over his forehead, over the scar and for the first time since it started the pain seemed to fizzle out and he let out a soft sigh and closed his eyes.
“Wandless magic, or natural magic, is raw unfocused, learning how to use it in that state is hard, rather like trying to catch an entire storm in a teacup. Everyone has the potential to do it but why when it is much easier and more effective to use a wand to focus your magic?”
Okay, Aiba Masaki (Masaki Aiba) is my number one favourite Japanese actor/talent/idol followed by Nino. He is so beautiful inside and out. He is just a beautiful ray of sunshine! If you have time search him on google and maybe look for ‘Very Danger’ when he was ‘playing’ with tigers.  As for the fic…Draco…Is a little more aware than Harry is…And is already getting complicated feelings…Nothing will happen while they are so young but I thought it was time to start building their relationship from friends/brothers or it will be weird when they do start getting feelings.  >.<
“Of course, you will all need the basics. I expect you all to do well. You will not be given special treatment.”
“You sure do apologise a lot” Draco frowned at the letter, he rarely apologised even when he thought the situation deserved it. He also couldn’t believe how awkward the writing was or that Harry actually wrote the ‘Ums’.
“I would also tell you something of your father but my memories of him are not the best. There is one that you should perhaps seek out however. He was friend to your father and the only one around in a fit state that can tell you about him in a more favourable light. Remus Lupin. In fact, Lucius it would be a good idea for you to reach out to him yourself, before Dumbledore has a mind to”
“Good night, Severus…” Remus smiled his heart a little easier as he kissed the centre of Severus’ chest before closing his eyes as the lights were put out.
Remus had always liked the village of Hogsmeade. It was as petty as a picture with small country cottage style houses with wooden doors and thatched roofs. In any season it looked like a John Constable painting and he had always wanted to be able to afford one of the cottages with the thatched roofs. He could imagine himself in a pretty garden with flowers creeping up over the door. He had only shared that dream with one person, Lily, who always teased him that maybe there would be a dark-haired man with a big nose inside. She was also the only one of his childhood friends that knew about his sexuality. He hadn’t been able to tell James, Sirius, or Peter, scared that that might have been one revelation too far even for his most accepting of friends and even if they didn’t mind they wouldn’t have accepted his attraction to Severus.
“Okay! We’re in the press box, best seats in the house! You see all the action! This way…Stay close!”
“Hey Pixie-dust, how’s my favourite little Sister? And the best twins in the world?” He asked picking up the three of them easily and spinning them around twice before putting her back on her feet and kissing each of their cheeks. The boys grinned happily drool running down their chins while Luna gave a happy musical giggle moving aside a stack of Quibbler magazines from the long bench at the table so he could sit down beside a collection of work robes and odd socks. The socks made him think for a moment of Dobby and the reason he now only wore odd socks as a tribute to his friend.
“Of course, they are, blood magic of the Goblin kind very ancient and not something people want to mess with, but of course Dumbledore likes to think he is above such things. I will be heading back to Hogwarts for a while, once you leave this room do not enter it again until I return”
The ring in the cracker had been a last-minute choice that morning. He had woken early and had found himself watching Remus in his sleep.
“Harry, you’re thinking too loudly” Draco sighed nudging him in the side and Harry rolled over so he could look at his friend. Draco was laid on his back, his hair splayed over the deep green sheets and his blonde eyebrows drawn together as he glared up at the ceiling.
“For the moment, we have Kingsley on side which I wasn’t expecting” Lucius said sweeping over to the table and sitting down in front of him and Harry. “Jinx, may I have one of your hot chocolates, if you please?”
“Dad, how did you…?” Harry spluttered almost choking on the potatoes. Remus let out a laugh piling sliced ham onto Draco’s plate. Severus just lifted an eyebrow popping a roast potato into his mouth.
“I think he may suspect, which is why he is so insistent that Harry be returned to those animals he calls his family” Lucius growled with more feeling than Severus was expecting him to show. Remus certainly looked surprised. “However there is no chance of us ever getting information out of him”
“The kelpie. Native to Scotland and Ireland” Severus hummed with a smile watching both Harry and Remus looking bewitched by the large horse like creature. “Another thing that likes to drag you down to the depths of the water and kill you. It would do best never to stray to close to water after sunset”
Please forgive my lame history of magic in Japan I just wanted Harry and Draco to learn a little wand less magic
“Y-yes, thank you” Harry smiled at his secondary father who was soon spooning pules of soft mashed potatoes onto his plate.
“Here we are my boy, hawthorn and unicorn hair, from the same unicorn that gave your mother’s core…” Ollivander explained and this time Harry felt the same buzz as he had just felt with Pansy as Draco flicked his wand and had dozens of butterflies made of light dance around the room. “I knew it! I knew it as soon as you walked in! It was calling to you!”
“Yay! Well done!” The green-eyed boy beamed at him flashing white teeth and Draco flushed happily preening under the praise.
“Boy! I found you a new story!” Draco announced happily jumping down from Nimbus, Severus perched on his shoulder. Boy smiled taking the empty bucket for firewood and together they moved into the forest collecting small twigs and branches while Draco read to him of mysterious Dragons and Prince’s with gleaming swords. “It is my birthday soon”
“Yes! Yes! Excellent! Five points to Ravenclaw Mr Lupin-Snape! Now then Miss Granger…” Flitwick turned from their group to go to the table where Hermione was almost falling out her chair. With a swish and a flick Hermione’s feather floated up from the table as well and was soon doing swirling patterns in the air. “May, may! Five points to Gryffindor Miss Granger, very good indeed. Now all together, swish and flick…Wingardium Leviosa!” Feathers were soon being forced up from desks all around the room though only Harry and Hermione managed to get the height. Draco could get his to reach his nose, but it was soon tumbling down. Pansy managed to get it to lift twice, while Seamus managed to get it to flip over before setting it alit in a puff of purple smoke. Dean Thomas waved the smoke away with a hand and the seven friends laughed ignoring the disapproving stares they were getting from Hermione. “Oh dear, too much force, Mr Finnigan, try with another feather…Those that have successfully floated their feather pair up and see if you can pass it to each other…Mr Lupin-Snape, Miss Granger as you both had the most height, I want you to pair up…Come along don’t be shy…”
“No, just…Wasn’t expecting it, is all” Ron grumbled awkwardly rubbing at his face and causing the dark smudge to creep further over his nose and left eye. Harry shrugged and then settled back against Draco’s shoulder listening to the clicking of the train as it rocked him back and forth. Draco patted fingers over his knee as he talked Quidditch with Fred and George completely ignoring Ron. Pansy and Seamus were talking about houses arguing about what kind of test they would have to do for the sorting. Harry watched the twins as closely as he could wishing they would just tell them but like all the adults in their lives, the twins just gave half smiles and ignored the conversation. “So, how do you know Malfoy?”
The palace was brimming with excitement, people having come from far and wide to witness the meeting of Prince Draco and his betrothed Lord Harry. Draco had lost count of the amount of people he had given false smiles to and thanked for their congratulations. He knew that all of them believed Dumbledore when he said that his and Harry’s union would finally rid the world of Voldemort, but he couldn’t deny he wanted to scream at them for being happy when he was so miserable. An hour into the ball the horns sounded sharply, and the palace crier cleared his throat announcing
“Then I will have achieved more than my grandfather believed I would” He said with a shudder remembering the bitter twisted old wizard who had denounced him rather thoroughly whenever he had the chance. He had been forbidden any recognition from the Prince line but his heir would still be entitled to it. There was no money, the old man had drunk it all away but there was a title and a seat on the council. “But this is all a matter for another time, for now I will look into the other matter, the prophecy...I can’t believe I never questioned by the meeting would be taking place there of all places”
“I’m glad you’re feeling better Uncle Severus” Harry smiled hugging the man tightly and burying his face into his neck. The herb and spice mix were stonger there and he breathed it in as Severus awkwardly patted his back.
“…Harry, Draco, Fred, George, and Pansy…We are going down to the changing rooms to meet the teams. Are you ready? Perhaps your new little friend will want to come as well?” Nino asked with a grin and Harry was positive that Seamus was about to pass out at the offer. Mrs Finnigan looked baffled, but she nodded under the look that Seamus was giving her. She didn’t stop sending Draco funny looks which only grew when they introduced themselves.
“I...Um...I...They...I...” Harry stammered feeling dizzy as he looked around at all of the adults in the room. No adult had ever believed him before, he was always just making it up for attention. Why should any of them believe him now? He was used to doing everything by himself. Vernon using the belt was just discipline because he was an ungrateful waste of space. Petunia hitting him with a frying pan because he had accidently burnt Dudley’s bacon was just a learning experience. The fact that he often went to bed hungry was simply because he was greedy.
“So I see, how would you suppose they would feel to know that he left the boy who lived in the care of muggles such as those? I have not seen as you have and nor do I wish to, but the very idea...” Lucius shuddered without opening his eyes and Severus was surprised by that. It would embarrass and hurt the boy if his peers were to know. He knew that for certain.
Harry followed after the elegant woman surprised when Pansy came and took his arm on one side while Draco did the same on the other. It was a strange but warm sensation to have them both beside him and he gave them both a nervous little smile his heart fluttering around in his chest. They walked through the restaurant ignoring the other patrons and soon they were back out onto the bright street. More people seemed to have arrived while they were eating and Harry found himself shrinking closer to Draco who squeezed him gently.
“You mean, my betrothed?” Draco soured even further. He had always known that he had been betrothed to Lord and Lady Potter’s son Harry but he had never seen him, in fact, there were rumours that he had died along with his family though the court advisor Albus Dumbledore assured them that Harry was merely in hiding until the ball away from political rivals that might seek to harm him.
“I promise, Harry, I will come and fetch you myself” Remus promised him gently both his hands on his shoulders as he peered into his green eyes with his warm amber ones. “And I am sure, if you need a little break your dad will let you use the floo on a weekend to come home. Even if it’s just for an hour or two.” Harry let the warm words wash over him and he smiled and nodded jolting when a loud whistle sounded. “That’s the bell, you will be fine, Harry! I will write to you, have fun and study well!” Remus pressed a kiss to his forehead and then he was given another kiss by Narcissa who hugged him tight.
“Of course. I will see you for dinner on Monday, don’t forget Filius, and do try to Floo your mother, when you don’t I’m the one that get’s to hear about it” Tormuld said cheerfully his gnarled fingers patting he teacher on the back and to Harry’s astonishment the professor actually seemed to blush.
“I’m not a witch, I’m a squib, my parents were magical but I didn’t inherit it. Now where did you get that book from?”
“They might do, at the moment though Dumbledore is doing everything he can to convince people that they have kidnapped the boy and are manipulating him”
“Malfoy manor has been around for a very long time, all of those that live inside have made their name on the walls here as soon as they have gotten their wands. You and Draco will have that pleasure next year” Lucius explained pausing in his steps to hold the lantern closer to the wall to show his own name with Narcissa’s beside it though it must have been done before the were married as she had signed it Narcissa Black.
“Don’t worry, I wasn’t going to make you wear one. Okay! I’m ready to get married” He announced walking to the door with Moony coming to stand beside him while Severus followed his sharp talons dangerously close to the twin’s faces.
“You’re very welcome Harry, merry Yule” Narcissa moved their hats and pressed kisses to both their heads before taking her seat at the table immediately getting Lucius to pull her cracker with her. Lucius gave her a fond look and held up his own and soon both Malfoy’s were wearing what could only be described as crowns. Narcissa’s was more ornate than her husband with shining jewels and her beloved butterflies. Her prize was a small box and she gasped with happiness when she saw earrings inside that were also shaped like butterflies but were etched on the bodies with Harry and Draco’s names. “Thank you, my love, I will treasure them…” She said lifting Lucius’ hand to her lips and kissing his fingers.
“My heart, I did tell you to tread carefully” He sighed coming to stand beside Draco his hand resting on his shoulder. “Mr Potter, you look very much like your father though I believe you have your mother’s eyes”
Goblins, Harry thought as they stepped out of the fire and into the grand reception of Gringotts bank, were some of the most interesting creatures he had met in the wizarding world. Lucius had given him a book about them and Harry was surprised to know that although the wizarding world trusted them to look after all their money they were often treated worse than dirt even by people who were considered to be light wizards. In his book it had told him about the various rebellions and Harry agreed with Lucius that there would come a time that there would be another one. His family manager Tormuld met them at the door. He was only a half goblin with less harsh features but he still had the large ears and sharp teeth.
“Mbali wishes to go as the Princess Ytuen and I will probably be her servant while her mother is queen” Kingsley answered, and Harry remembered the names from the book Kingsley had given him for his adoption. Ytuen was the youngest daughter of a tribal king. It was said that she was the first in the tribe to discover she had magic when a group of white slavers came to the village. She drove them back with lightening from her fingertips and she and the tribe faded into the mist saving those that they could by taking them into the shadow realm. Ytuen and her tribe were the only reason that African magic wasn’t lost during that part of history and she was still recognised by the African ministry of magic today.
Harry Potter walked down Diagon Alley with a confidence his younger self hadn’t had. It felt strange to be back in the UK again after several years in Romania on the Dragon reserve. After the second wizarding world he had tried to settle, he had taken Ginny on a few dates and tried to be just Harry. It hadn’t worked, everywhere they had gone had been a constant reminder of what had happened before, what they had lost. For a while he had helped with the clean up of Hogwarts and when the dust had finally settled in more ways than one he had known that he couldn’t stay. He needed to breathe to be free of everything and when Hermione and Ron had gone to Australia to find the Grangers Harry had talked to Ginny. She had taken it surprisingly well, at least as well as a red head with six brothers and a great aim could take it, it was obvious she had noticed the cracks that had formed.
“Its rather easy when you have studied them all your life, admittedly I think Latin and Japanese are my favourites but Mother insisted I learn French for that side of the family...”
“What about Kingsley? The Auror appears to have a soft spot for Harry and has been very helpful so far” Narcissa suggested lightly as she rubbed the tension from Lucius’ forehead “I know we are all wary of who we trust however for this I believe that we need to use everything at our disposal”
“Kaagaa’verkaan dech rehen ghekian awteer verden!” He vowed placing a hand on the crossed axes of him and his wife.
“Harry, dear, how do you feel?” Narcissa asked later when the home was their own again. Mrs Figg and Healer Hinchcliffe had stayed for some supper thankfully Umbridge had refused the forced invitation. Narcissa hated the woman with a passion and had done since they had attended school together. Umbridge had had a tender spot for Lucius and had genuinely believed that she would get him one day often stating that beauty faded but intelligence was for life. The toad had little of either but she was convinced otherwise. Both Harry and Draco had been quiet during the meal, Harry because of the awkwardness of the brace and Draco because of what he had seen. Her dragon hadn’t told her all but he didn’t need to she could see it in his face. He was hurting for his friend and angry that he had been so cruelly treated.
“She probably heard that Pants was going to be here and left as soon as pos...Ouch!” Draco cried out suddenly holding the back of his head with the hand that wasn’t holding to Harry’s and Harry saw a small shiny stone falling to the floor with a clatter before looking around and seeing a girl, the same age as them with a bob hair cut wearing a leaf green summer dress and sandals that seemed to remind him of the footwear a roman soldier would wear. Her expression was haughty but innocent while her eyes, blue framed with black eyelashes, were filled with amusement. “Pants”
“Very well, show the way, Mr Potter” Lucius gave him a smile his demeanour and dress reminding him of the heroes from the period films aunt Petunia liked to watch. Harry had never been allowed to watch them himself but he had seen bits through the gap in his cupboard door.
“Yes, this is also a vocal will, I will listen to it later. Perhaps you can listen with me” He said and Harry gave a nod while Severus’ shadow fell across the table. On the tray were not only drinks but also four of the largest glazed doughnuts topped with sprinkles and filled with Treacle that Harry had ever seen. They were as big as his head and would need to be eaten with a knife and fork. Harry’s mouth watered as he looked at them but he couldn’t help but wonder;
“I understand that” Chuck shrugged once again clearing his throat when he realised his voice was too high. “May I have some water?”
Potter-Snape family bonding time…I know that this is corny and whatever but…I wanted cute, fluffy, family moments. All three of them deserve it. The Peryton is my favourite non-humanoid fantasy creature. I’ve always thought how beautiful they sound.
“They are all so nice” Harry smiled with a mouth full of beef sandwich and Draco nodded. It was nice that Harry thought that, there was a lot of people, poorer families, that thought they treated their elves like slaves and beat them for fun. As if. Happy Elves made the best Elves.
“Sounds like a plan” Severus guided his strange little family to the line the smiling man looking a little bug eyed when it was finally their turn to be served but he quickly recovered spluttering
Phew! I never thought I would finish this part, can someone please switch off the sun or turn it down a little. I’m sorry if it was dull, but I had fun writing the three Chimera heads, I picture them to be like the fates in Greek legends the Maiden, the mother, and the hag.
“Yeah…It’s…Electrifying” Harry whispered with a nod positively buzzing with excitement. Cheering and chanting could already be heard with peddlers calling people to buy their goods.
“Your Granda wouldn’t happen to want a pair of Turtle doves’ would he?” Harry asked hopefully and Seamus almost looked eager before shaking his head and rubbing the back of his neck with a sad frown saying;
I swear I am not normally so bad with posting and I will try my best to get back into an actual rhythm again.
“I am aware of that Draco and they have agreed to take Harry into protective custody until more evidence is gathered” Lucius said turning from the window to look at them and Hestia seemed to get the feeling that as an Auror she was included in what had upset the lord. Draco on the other hand grew hopeful asking;
“Yes, she lives with us during the year, though this will be her last year. Run along children and have fun” Narcissa shooed them away and all six made a run for it before Bridget could say anything else. They left via one of the man side doors heading down through the garden to the pitch. The peacocks had all been moved into a large enclosure with a barn like building to protect them during the autumn and winter months and Harry missed them for the most part but was also glad that they wouldn’t be chasing them around the garden for a while.
“Yes father” He said stepping into the flames and calling out the name of his office still blushing as his face turned green before he vanished. There fire filled the room with a crackling sound for a moment before Tormuld smiled rubbing his knuckles.
“Michael Christopher was the eldest and Matthew Lawrence the youngest...My husband’s name was Stanley though every one called him Lee, his father was Stan you see made it less complicated. He was a butcher by trade had his own shop on the high street. He was the most handsome man I had ever seen. Sorry Harry, you don’t want to be listening to an old woman’s tales” She sighed rocking herself slowly as once again she started to knit her needles clicking in the silent attic as she counted the stitches under her breath. Harry wanted to ask but he was once again terrified that he had pushed too far and slowly he started reading through the book again until there was a hooting of an owl ad the fluttering of wings. “Seems the post has arrived, you are a handsome looking bird” Mrs Figg cooed as a huge but graceful Eagle owl flew in through the window. It was almost three times the size of Plum and had talons that were built for ripping flesh from bone however it landed carefully on the arm of Mrs Figg’s chair and held up its leg so she could take the letters from its leg. “Two letters today, ah but there’s one for me as well...Such pretty handwriting, here you are Harry dear”
Autumn soon bled into winter and when Harry woke up to the first signs of snow on the ground, he let out a happy squeak and ran from the bedroom ignoring the sleepy protests of his sleeping companion. He met a few house elves and woke a few of the grumpier paintings but he was soon running out of the main door and into the garden. His eyes were wide, his mouth wide in a pure circle as he looked at the fairy tale, Christmas card snow that was laid all around him. It was knee deep over the manicured lawns while the drive and paths were clear from all but a little dusting. Deep red breasted robins sat on the remains of former bushes and red berries glinted like jewels in the snow against the ever greens.
“Nobody knows, not really, there are rumours of course, there always are. But what we do know is that he went to your home the night he vanished to kill them and you finished him, it’s how you got the scar on your forehead” Her faded blue eyes moved to his hair line and Harry found himself smoothing out his fringe. His aunt had always hated his scar but he had always rather liked it looking like a lightning bolt.
“Is that so? If that is the case, I will look forward to welcoming you to Ravenclaw with open arms” The professor was positively gleaming as he seemed to bounce up and down on the spot and Harry found himself liking the man who clearly seemed to love his job and those he taught. He had met one other teacher like that.
“Oi, where’s Potter?” A voice sneered not too far from the bush he was sitting in and Harry carefully closed the book, where he had been reading about postage owls, and crouched down as low as he could. Dudley’s gang had decided that it was time for a game of Harry hunting now that he had been allowed out and they were bored which was why he was sitting in the bush in the first place. He normally went to the small playground on the next street over but the Gang knew about that spot and he had been beaten up more times than he could count there already. Dudley never came into Figg’s garden however because none of her many cats liked him and would spit and hiss whenever he got too close.
“Peace, my love, I had no interest in anyone beyond you” Lucius said quickly his arm sliding around his wife’s shoulders at the first hint of jealously his lips ghosting against her hairline. “As for Amara, she may play at being the perfect daughter the Edlund’s wanted but she is more a black sheep than her brother. His only crime in their eyes was to marry a muggle born. Anyway, I believe that we will give Mr Shurley a chance”
“It was one of Dudley’s old ones. It was gross when he had it, but he had stretched it all out and Aunt Petunia was trying to get it on me…”
“They aren’t as large as those Muggles, but they have a good likeness, come Harry dear…” Narcissa beckoned and Lucius pushed him gently forward chuckling at the expression on Harry’s face. Draco was positively gleaming as he bounced at his mother’s side.
“Dobby is okay Harry” Luna said with a calm certainty her tone sincere and certain. “He died as a free and noble Elf. As for me I’m doing okay, Harry, your godsons are using me as a climbing frame. They have an inner ear infection and have been clingy all day.” She informed him, and Harry gave a grin pulling faces at the boys until they gave him a grin and pulled away from their mother to instead sit on his lap babbling about something in rapid baby speech that seemed to be going nowhere fast.  Harry thought they were probably telling him about their favourite toys, but it was nonsensical, and he just listened politely while Luna made them tea. As always when he saw her, she looked serenely happy almost dancing around the kitchen.
“I wasss trying to ssleep” The grass snake hissed in displeasure shooting him angry looks as it curled its way up his arm. The yellow eyes unnerved him for just a moment and then he apologised having completely forgotten about the snake he had brought with him.
“Uncle Sev” Harry called following Severus out of the breakfast room with the shrunken package his mother had given him in her will. The teacher turned to look at him with a smile lighting his black eyes.
If anyone had told him a little over a year ago that he would have a photo of James Potter in his rooms, much less be honoured to have it, he would have shipped them off to Mungos without even the time it would take to sneer and yet there it was and he would often hold a glass of whiskey to the photo and thank the once bane of his existence whole heartedly. He nodded to the photo now, he knew that it wasn’t the same as a portrait, but he often felt the two in the photo responded and were perhaps pleased.
“Yes, me too, even if it is a little confusing” Harry took out his own orange smiling happily at the decoration. It was such a simple thing and yet it was another sign that these people loved him and included him in everything. “What does the orange mean?”
“Yes, the whole village is much the same, we shall have time to explore a little later, for now I see Lupin” Severus motioned to a corner table where a man with sandy brown hair and shabby looking robes. He hadn’t changed much since they were younger, Severus thought noting how pale and tired Lupin was and how his amber eyes moved from the door to the clock on wall. Several empty bottles of chocolate milk drink were scattered on the table around him and Severus remembered that Lupin was fond of chocolate and always seemed to have a bar stashed away about his person. Harry moved slowly into his side as he always did when he was nervous clutching tightly to Draco’s hand. “It will be fine, brat, I’m here. As is Draco and Jinx is only a shout away, nothing can hurt you”
“Did you enjoy your studies with professor Ninomiya?” Severus asked after dinner that night when they had moved to the potion’s lab alone. It was where Severus had wanted to go and Harry suspected that it filled him with a great deal of confidence to be there and that was what he seemed to need.
“I see, but that is a good thing, you wanted to see him that is why you wrote to him, isn’t it?” Severus asked casually and Harry nodded slowly, that was true, he had sat down and started a dozen or more letters only to toss them into the fire.
“Not personally but I knew of them, I don’t think there is anyone in our world that doesn’t know the names of your parents” Harry played around with the cat’s ear not knowing what he was meant to say to that. He still didn’t know the names of his parents, his aunt and uncle just called them the lousy layabouts that had died leaving hard working people to raise their ungrateful offspring.
“If that’s what you wish for. Jinxie ‘ere asked me to serve yer for one year starting from today. Anything yer need, I’ll be around, if yer want me to find summet, just shout my name, Ernest…Now get me outta this ‘ere box” Ernest grumbled, and Harry quickly set the box down and a tiny man dressed in doll sized brown trousers and a puffy shirt came out. He stood less than twelve inches high but unlike the elves he had hair and a ruddy sort of complexion. All his features looked perfectly humanoid expect for his ears which were a little big and pointed.
Narcissa smiled at the page aware that Draco was looking thrilled by the development. There was no doubt that the words read; I want to stay always with Draco Lucius Malfoy.
“I bought you the set of Boris the Brave for your first birthday. Before you went into hiding. I read you the first story of Boris going to find the witch. You loved it”
“There you are! Master Dumbledore is inside and waiting for you!” They spoke together, in perfect sync and Boy frowned in confusion as he was pushed to the front door of the Dursley’s home. He had never used the front door and the moment it was thrown open he was positive that he was going to be hit. Instead he was met by Petunia tittering in a nervous voice.
“See! Harry! If we were pirates, we could sail all around the world learning about different cultures! It would feed your nerdish behaviour and I would make a very dashing pirate” Draco announced happily nudging him in the stomach with his bony elbow. Narcissa and Remus joined them as he said this, and she ruffled his hair before announcing to the assembled party
“Urgh! How dare he!” The pale blonde huffed shooting Hagrid glares over his shoulder. “Just wait until I tell father!”
“You are great…You are the best…And I love you” Harry told them seriously meaning it. Severus and Remus flushed but smiled.
“Wow, Gin, thanks…Really, I didn’t…Wow…” Harry squeezed her hand back noticing for the first time the large diamond on her finger. “Wow, congratulations.”
“You will use one of the Malfoy owls, we have several in fact one of the snowy owls chicks has recently fledged she was to be sent to the Emporium to be sold but perhaps you would like her, I forgot that we haven’t yet given you a birthday gift” Narcissa said happily and Harry swallowed fighting tears that came to his eyes almost instantly. It suddenly felt overly warm and stuffy in the breakfast room and he was very glad when Draco stood up and took his hand saying;
“The last I checked I lived here but I am positive that it could be opened up as a museum, if people would enjoy being scowled out by dozens of disapproving purebloods” Draco said flippantly immediately going into defensive mode at the look Bridget was shooting everyone.
“Sweet boy, you need not apologise. It is not your fault. We will get you right” She said with a smile rubbing further up his thigh over his hip and Nino cleared her throat giving him a small sympathetic smile;
“Draco Malfoy. Pleasure” Draco said in a soft voice and Harry gave a nod before pulling his hand back and running his hand through his hair which was a lot better behaved than it used to be though that could have something to do with the fact it was a lot longer than it used to be and even the Potter hair couldn’t fight gravity. “...It has been a while, Potter...”
“Dragon, you must know that your marriage has been foretold. Your union will finally rid the land of Voldemort”
“Boy! Get up! Mrs Figg is here!” Petunia shouted through the door the next morning and Harry groaned getting up and stuffing his book into his hiding spot. He pulled on his glasses and one of Dudley’s oversized t-shirt before heading out. Mrs Figg was sitting awkwardly in the kitchen her eyes widening as she saw him emerge from the cupboard under the stairs but she didn’t say anything just sniffed and turned on her heel marching out of the home.
“He is a Poltergeist, a lot of the time he can be a laugh, but its best to stay clear of him if you can. When you come here properly next year, we’ll show you all the short cuts and things” the twins promised while they stepped out into a larger corridor that had more students. The hallway was huge with large iron chandeliers with candles floating above their heads. More candles lit the walls and the paintings and the doors that were on either side of them. “That is the history of magic classroom. It is the most boring class, always good to get some sleep in though”
“Youse is welcomes, Master Harry’s! I will tells them! Youse should be getting ready for the zoos now!”
“Because...You came all this way, I didn’t mean to trouble you. Honestly its no big deal...I shouldn’t have said that” Harry whispered softly “Can’t you just pretend I didn’t say anything?”
Ugh! I’m sorry! This chapter didn’t want to come out at all >.< I should have scrapped it all together but after working on it for a few days and liking some of it I just decided to roll with it. I promise more Draco/Harry moments when they are in the dorm, there is the issue of the sleeping arrangements after all…
Can the person who keeps leaving me nasty messages please kindly take a hop, skip and a jump out of my comment section? I know you’re a troll with copy and paste but yeah please go away and read something you do like? Thank you 😊
A young science teacher who had taken him under his wing refusing to believe the stories that were made up about him. He would allow him to sit with him in breaks while he marked homework. Dudley hadn’t liked that as it had meant that he and his gang couldn’t bully him so he had told the head teacher that Harry had told him that the teacher was touching him. The teacher had left the school after only three months of being there and Harry could only hope that he hadn’t gotten him into too much trouble. “Ah my next lesson is due to start, I should return to Hogwarts, may I use your floo?”
“Did the Witch learn to love herself?” Harry asked breathlessly his eyes shining as he listened to the tale. Earlier during the ritual, they had touched on the old legends but it had mostly been in Latin and although he was improving it didn’t often feel fast enough to learn everything there was to know.
The reason for my actions yesterday was the very idea that Lily’s son had gone through that, it was more than I could bear. I swore to your mother I would protect you albeit from afar, Dumbledore had assured me that you were well taken care of and I failed in making sure that was true. In fact, I thought of you as your father and...I am sorry. For all that you have suffered and that I made you relive it again yesterday but I had to see for myself” Severus finally apologised and then sat nervously in silence again pinned to his chair by the green eyed stare of the youth. Harry didn’t blink but his body did seem to relax little by little. “I hurt you as much as your uncle did by forcing you to relive that but please be assured that I will do everything in my power to make sure you never have to return to them”
“Yup!” Pansy let out a happy sigh her head resting on his shoulder. “I can’t wait to go to Hogwarts, but you have to promise me, even if we are in different houses, we will be friends, Harry.”
“I should say so” He hummed sniffing the aged whisky before continuing “The greater wizarding population will be on Dumbledore’s side. He is a hero still for what he did to Grindlewald”
“Of course, but do be careful, my heart, you’re not as young as you once were. Boys, take a few steps back…”
“Nope! My healer said I was ready to have my eyes fixed! I had the potions yesterday! It feels strange not to wear them, and my eyes still go a little fuzzy if I’m reading too much…” Harry stopped speaking flushing brightly as he seemed to think that he was speaking too much. The twins didn’t know the full story of what had happened to him, but they knew enough to know that he often felt embarrassed and shy as though he was waiting to be punished for speaking too much.
“Mbali” Narcissa hummed lightly stroking the photo. “She is a beautiful girl; you should be extremely proud, and I imagine that one day she will be a strong witch”
“Excuse me? Oh…The tea, yes…Thank-you” Remus smiled secretively at the nervous splutter Severus let out and poured the tea into the fine bone china cup that had delicate paintings of blue birds around the rim.
“You dare come into my house and point a stick at me! How dare you!” He almost screamed and Harry seemed to shrink even more. Draco moved to stand beside him taking the boy’s hand in his own. “You are one of them! Well I won’t stand for it! Get out! I swore when we took him in we would beat that...Ughnnn” The obese man let out a groan before sinking heavily to his knees his mouth glued shut in the same manner as his wife. Lucius twirled his wand around his fingers and then moved forward. His voice still calm as he spoke;
“Because you are related to the queen! I can’t believe that! But then I did think you were a prince!”
“And how long would it take to get such a meeting arranged?”  Lucius asked while Harry suddenly felt cold wondering if his parents were going to tell him that he was best left in Dumbledores care. Tormuld gave a grin. It was clear that he respected the Malfoy lordship more than he did Dumbledore as he bowed his head low exposing the back of his neck.
It is strange writing a Christmas part when we haven’t really entered autumn yet but hey ho…The twelve days of Christmas is something my group does. It is rather long and tiring and frankly I’m happy that this year we will have to cut back. 12th night cake is basically Christmas cake now but is made with baked marzipan and is soaked in way too much alcohol, you start making it months before Christmas and feed it alcohol the entire time, though it is a lot nicer than Figgie Pudding xD
“Um! Yes!” Harry said swallowing it down surprised to see that more food had been placed onto his plate. Narcissa was looking innocently at him but it was obvious that she had placed the food there. He smiled at her and ate a carrot as Lucius started talking to Draco.
“The would listen to me even less than Dumbledore would. The truth is, they trust me less then the wizarding population trust your parents” Lupin drained his chocolate drink and then stared at the bottle clearly wishing it was something stronger. His thumb nail scrapped at the name plate on the bottle while he continued to rub and clench at his chest. It reminded Harry of when he clawed at his neck. “The truth is Harry, I...I am a werewolf”
“As well as can be expected, they don’t like me because I am a Malfoy, and I am controlling Harry somehow and forcing him to do as I say. Which is strange since I thought we were turning Harry into the next Dark Lord, shouldn’t I be listening to everything he says?” Draco pulled a face looking as flippant as ever while Harry bristled as he remembered the cruel words thrown out last night and this morning. “We can deal with them though, right Harry?”
“I bet that’s what they did, I imagine that they even had yellow ones picked out in case we ended up in Hufflepuff. Are you ready to head back to the dorm and get our books, Harry? Ladies?” He said including Chao-Xiang and her friend who laughed and nodded pushing their empty plates aside. Harry was glad that Draco had included the girls. They were the only ones being normal and nice around them and he wanted peace in his house even if they had Pansy, Seamus and the twins outside of it. As they made their way out of the great hall Harry saw Ron sitting all alone at a table in the far corner his face dark and scornful as his top lip curled.
“The books here are for the use of Ravenclaw students only. They are not to be taken outside of our dorm; they contain many of Lady Ravenclaw’s private volumes.” The male Prefect standing beside Penelope told them sounding stuffy as he did so. His chest puffed up proudly as though he himself owned the books and they didn’t belong to the whole house. Harry was impressed though and he was itching to read some of the books which seemed to be even older than the ones in the manor library.
“I am sure, show it Cissa and she will be sending for the original. Actually I may do so myself, it is time I had a new photo for my desk” Lucius gave a rare genuine smile his grey eyes warming at the picture and Severus realised fully that his oldest friend truly cared about Harry and wasn’t just using him for gain. “We heard the will of Lord and Lady Potter yesterday. It was hard on the boy but your friend Lily she wiped the smile of Dumbledore’s face. She was as sharp as a knifle I can see why you liked her”
Harry snorted a little at the silliness of Draco’s accidental magic trying hard to imagine what an albino peacock would look like and how somebody could have them in their garden it sounded like a dream. The school had taken him on a class trip a few years ago to one of the stately houses around Surry and that had had Peacocks but the normal kind with blue feathers and pretty tails he couldn’t picture what an all white one would look like.
“Yeah! He’s our older brother!” The twins answered flushing so much they hid the freckles on their noses. Conner might not yet be a famous Quidditch player, but it was clear to Harry he was going to be one of the best.
He truly hadn’t expected to find himself in a quiet gay bar one Friday night. He hadn’t intended his feet to lead him there, he had just wanted a drink and that had been the only bar open. He had sat at the bar and ordered his drink before realising but as the evening had worn on and he had relaxed a great deal with the help of the alcohol he had realised quite slowly that perhaps he wasn’t as straight as he had thought.
“Muggles? How extraordinary!” Pansy’s eyes seemed to widen as her mouth fell open ever so slightly. “I’ve never even spoken to a muggle”
“I see. I believe that mine is coming soon but I can never be sure. My masters have never given me a date” Boy hummed without malice or jealousy. It was a fact, simple, and true. “What do you hope to have for your birthday?”
“Have any of you seen a toad? A boy called Neville has lost one?” She announced ignoring the startled expressions on their faces. They all shook their heads, even Ron, and she turned to leave.
Black and James had been the school heartthrobs, but Remus hadn’t been without admirers and to think that that gaze had settled onto him was more than he could believe. As they talked, he allowed himself to believe that all was well, at least for tonight.
“Draco, my sister is...A few vials short of a full potions set but...Don’t judge her so harshly as all that. Her mind was fragile since we were young, time with the dark lord was not an easy one. She would never harm you child” Narcissa knew it to be true. Bellatrix had always been insane and that insanity had been fed by their parents, her husband, and the dark lord but for all that she had liked to hurt her Narcissa was certain that her sister would chose family over all else. The floo flared breaking into her thoughts and she looked up to see a pale faced man she didn’t fully recognise. His hair appeared to be a washed out brown through the green of the flame. His eyes, a hazel colour searched the room for a moment before they settled on the sofa and Harry. “May I help you? Mr...?”
“Dad! Moony!” Harry shouted his face alight with excitement as he saw them. Soot was clinging to his chin, nose, and cheek but his green eyes were blazing with excitement. He looked like a child and Severus found his lips stretching into a smile as Remus positively beamed. “We went to a proper Quidditch match! The Honeysuckle Hummingbirds against the Celtic Legion”
“Watch this Harry” Draco said with a broad grin as Narcissa pointed her wand at a large antique looking lamp. The witch spoke in flawless French and the lamp burst into blue flame casting a light on the opposite wall which seemed to show a painting of a gate. All at once the gate shuddered and then slowly separated from the bricks to reveal a golden gate way with swirling writing over the top. The gates swung inwards to the wall and Harry gasped expecting them to hit but instead a bright light shone through the walls and people, dozens of them, dressed in brightly coloured wizarding robes were milling around. “Welcome Harry to La Belle Petite Volle” Draco smiled taking his hand once again and leading him through the gates.
“Being of somewhat sound mind hereby decree that this is my last will and testament. All other wills before this one are null and void and so forth. Right that’s the formalities out of the way. I guess if you’re hearing this, I’m dead. Don’t waste time crying about it, I can only hope that it was a good death and that Lily and my son are still alive. On the advice of Dumbledore, we are going into hiding today, there is something about a prophecy and such, I dunno but he said that you-know-who was gonna come after us and yup that isn’t good news, best if we make ourselves scarce and all that. All of my titles and monies go to my wife Lily Potter and to my son Harry James Potter if she is as dead as I am...”
“For you to practice on! You were pushed around by these muggles and you couldn’t do anything about it. Now you can push them around! Even if you don’t use magic you can punch them” Draco said grinning from ear to ear as he held up his hand and punched the Dudley shaped dummy sending it rocking back and forth and Harry grinned tentatively pushing the Vernon one sending it bumping into Petunia.
“I know” Remus smirked stretching out his back before looking around in some confusion “Where are the boys?”
“Masters and Mistress, there are aurors at the gate and Dumbles from Hoggywarts!” The shrill accent sound of Rocky the butler elf said from the doorway and Draco watched as his father stiffened into what his mother described as his battle stance.
In case you hadn’t noticed Potter, I am very blonde...” He said with a roll of his noble shoulders that caused his thin barely there chest muscles to react. It was a simple act but it got Harry hot and bothered and he moved forward again crushing his mouth to Draco’s. He didn’t have a great deal of experience in the kissing department but he had to admit that Draco’s were the best he had ever had. They felt so natural, so right, he thought he could probably get dizzy off of them. While they kissed his hand moved back down to cup and fondle the cock his body twitching in excitement as it continued to stiffen against his palm. Their moans grew louder but each of them swallowed them down into each of their own mouths and both hadn’t noticed that the shower had long since stopped spraying many minutes ago .
“Of course,” Lucius summoned an elf who appeared and then vanished quickly and quietly handing the startled American the requested drink. Chuck sipped it slowly allowing the cool liquid to soothe parched lips before setting the glass on the coffee table just as Lucius said “Please, you should relax. This is just about getting to know you”
“Harry? What happened child?” Severus asked and quickly Harry explained about the Chimera, what she had said, and the pain in his scar. When he had finished all five adults, Nino included, were staring at him with shocked faces. “Your scar started to hurt?”
And I believe that he wants Harry to be his greatest piece. I cannot pretend I understand everything but as we stay hidden it is as though Dumbledore acts as though it is all coming to plan. He said that there is a prophecy but heee did not let Lils nor myself hear it. I feel that he is building my son to be a general in a larger battle.
“About time! Luna has been on edge waiting for you to get your act together, I’m surprised she hasn’t already Flooed Hermione”
“Master Draco is a flatterer Little Master Harry!” Jinx squeaked happily grinning as she poured out the drinks and handed them to them “Would little Masters like something from the kitchens? Chocolate or...”
“Draco, calm down and change into some attire that will not attract attention” Narcissa said delicately folding her letter and setting it aside. She looked calm and composed, some would say cold, but Draco could see the fire in her icy blue eyes. She might have been the wife of a death eater and sister to Bellatrix Lestrange but Draco knew that his mother loved children. He would have had brothers and sisters to spare if she had been able to carry them but an old family curse prevented her from being able to carry more than one child.
“What? Why? Did she hurt you?” Draco asked instantly. His eyes running over his mother for any sign of injury even as his expression became afraid. Harry didn’t know much about Azkaban. He knew that it was a wizarding prison on an island somewhere and that its name alone was enough to make many would be criminals think again, but he did know about Aunt Bellatrix Lestrange. Draco had nightmares about the woman even though he would have only met her when he was extremely young. He had read things about her however and the things that she had done, that was enough to make him shudder.
Severus woke to the odd feeling of having another body next to his. He hadn’t been a virgin, however the concept of having a partner staying with him through the night was new and he stalled in the sheets unsure for a moment as to how to react. Remus was sleeping with his head on his arm his fingers pressed against the faded dark mark on his forearm. He looked peaceful with his light eyelashes splayed over his cheeks night-time stubble dusting his chin and top lip. Severus pushed his long bangs from his face with his free hand and then settled into the bed forcing himself to relax and just enjoy the moment. It appeared to be the right idea as soon he felt Remus’ lips lightly press to his arm as he woke slowly. A breathy whine pulled its way lazily out of his mouth as his limbs woke slowly shifting until their legs were tangled under the covers.
“I believe you, Aunt Cissy” Harry said quickly as the woman’s eyes filled with tears. Although she didn’t say more about what she had said he could see how much it was hurting her and it filled him with love. “I’m sorry that you had to go through that, Aunty Cissy. You and Uncle Luci do so much for me”
“I was casually speaking with my colleague professor Flitwick, enjoying my morning cup of tea before having to deal with the dunderheaded brats, when Dumbledore came over and asked if he might have a word. He spoke some drivel about Quidditch and the game that is being held. When I finally returned to my tea Filius had gone to his office. I admit that I was careless, I should have checked for additives but I was not expecting to be dosed by my esteemed colleague, almost immediately I found myself agreeing to let him come to Harry” Severus snarled his fingers itching to his wand as he glared at the headmaster who was standing silent but uncowed. His eyes were as sparkling as ever and Harry had to wonder if the man was altogether sane. “We came in through the floo in Lucius’ study, he was already sorting through this mornings mail. He was startled by my appearance and that of Dumbledore and wasn’t quick enough to react before Dumbledore used the Imperious curse…”
“Harry’s wand is just like Harry himself, one of a kind with a wonderful mixed family…The Potters, and Lupin and Snape…” Pansy said happily, and Harry gave a smile pointing our that all wands were pretty much one of a kind before adding.
“There isn’t a lot that we can gain from a single letter Draco, talk to him more coax out more information be a friend to him and then we shall see what might be done. It might be more interesting for you than reading about Pansy’s trips to all of the cafes in Italy” Narcissa smiled pushing his hair out of his face and Draco nodded, he had already decided that he would write back to Harry without his mother telling him so but he had wanted her opinion on what he had read. “But  suspect you already intended on writing to him”
“Yes, because we are, aren’t we?” Pansy shrugged looking flippant, however Harry could see that she was nervous about the answer even if she were refusing to show it. Pansy and Draco had only had each other for a long time, neither trusted people much less children that weren’t other death eaters’ so this was a big moment for her. Seamus blinked his mouth opening and closing like a goldfish before he pointed out
“Come on, Harry, let’s get your trunk onto the train.” Remus said taking one side and Harry took the other trying to ignore the Weasley Matriarch shouting about manners and Malfoys. He glanced at his Pseudo-Aunt and Uncle who were helping Draco with his things very pointedly ignoring the whispers that Harry had just noticed. Parents all over the station were clearly warning their children about the evil Malfoy’s. The thought made him both angry and want to laugh. The Malfoys were traditional, yes, but they were the most loving family he had ever met.
There will be Snape opening the package and a skip to the meeting with Lupin in the next part! I really hope that this was okay ^_^ Again Masaki (Aiba Masaki) is a member of Arashi and a complete but lovable idiot who loves animals and works with them a lot to comical effect xD
“Since you appear to have gotten the hang of handling your broom, Harry, how about a game of Muggle in the middle? I shall be muggle first” Lucius offered throwing the ball to Draco who caught it easily. “The object of the game is to pass the ball back and forth without the muggle catching it, if the muggle does so then the one who threw it becomes muggle”
“Is that allowed?” Harry asked happily. They had seen Hogwarts on their trips to Hogsmeade, but they had never been inside. He had been thinking that he would only get to see the inside when they started in September. Draco had been to the castle before with his father when he was younger but had only been in the main hall and the headmaster’s office and he couldn’t really remember much of the trip.
“Parselmouth…” Harry whispered nervously as both Severus and Remus turned to look at him with quizzical eyebrows raised.
“My dear elf, I had no intention of hurting him, or have your masters forbidden me speaking to Harry?”
“Thank-you, Professor, I...Forgive you?” Harry said and for some reason a weight lifted from Severus as though Lily was forgiving him for everything he had done. It was unlikely, there were some things that he could never be forgiven for “What was my mums favourite colour?”
“Remus, are you okay?” Harry asked when the Malfoy’s and Severus had left them alone in the lunchroom. The man was looking at the empty table with an unreadable expression on his face his fingers curled into balls. He had barely eaten anything at lunch and Harry sensed that he felt uncomfortable.
“Thank-you, Severus” Remus whispered and Severus just rolled his shoulders slowly. “Although my curse only affects me once a month the ministry view me as a dark creature and as such wouldn’t even return messages to the owls I sent them about you and my concerns” An animalistic growl left the man’s throat before he could get himself under control again. It didn’t stop the anger Harry could see in the man’s eyes or the sadness as he wrung his hands through his hair and chewed hard on his lower lip. “The only Auror that did reply was Kingsley Shacklebolt and that was only a few days ago. I am sorry Harry, but if I had been the one to take you, they would have screamed kidnap. I wouldn’t have even been able to argue my case before being thrown to the dementors to be kissed”
Lucius cleared his throat setting the book down at the edge of Harry’s bed. The green-eyed boy was watching him closely a sleepy smile on his face.
I am so very sorry that I dropped off the planet. Honestly I never meant to but I do have a legitimate reason. About a month ago I was rushed into hospital with chest pain. I was having a heart attack they did a bunch of tests and decided it was a one time thing but needed to have another test in a few days. Got to the appointment and it turns our it wasn't a one time thing it was caused by blood clots. They thought at the time it was due to the AstraZeneca vaccine.
“It wasn’t your fault, Mrs Figg” Harry said carefully patting the old woman’s shoulder as she hugged him as tightly as she dared. Even that caused him to flinch in pain but he didn’t otherwise react.
“Family is family Draco” Pansy smiled as the curtain finally twitched and then opened and Harry stepped out in robes of black edged in green that matched his eyes. They were tightly fitting, as was the style most favoured in Paris with a fullness at he hips and lower arms. . Harry looked completely terrified his face pale and pinched as he worried at his lower lip. Narcissa came out to stand beside him asking;
“Yes, I know, but my lawyers are keeping him tangled in the case of abuse of Harry and more recently of blackmail” Lucius hummed with a smile clearly remembering the missive he had received that morning before the adoption. It had been from his lawyers, Severus had recognised the seal, but he hadn’t said what it was about.
The great hall was almost entered with only a few sleepy looking Hufflepuffs huddled together on their table and a few more awake older Ravenclaws who already had books out and open in front of them. At the main teachers table Nino and Severus were sitting, Nino looking decidedly unimpressed at being awake so early, and Severus looking about the same as ever. He was reading through a newspaper while sipping a coffee and Harry knew his dad would be trying to complete the crossword before Uncle Luci, the same as they did every morning. Harry made for the head table with Draco trailing after him aware that the eyes of the few students in the hall were on him.
“My room? This can’t be...But it’s too big!” He said and Draco gave a shrug. All of the rooms in Malfoy manor were large, they held their own sitting areas, and bathrooms. Harry’s room was what would have been his siblings room if he had been able to have one and was almost identical in size and shape to his own.
“Filius Flitwick, Hogwarts” He called into the flames and not a moment later the charms teacher appeared as a floating head. He hadn’t changed much since she had been at Hogwarts, it seemed that he was as easily startled as ever.
“Harry, you okay?” Draco asked softly ignoring the teacher his grey eyes searching his green ones. “Do you need some pain potion?”
“For you, for allowing me to witness your adoption” He said his voice oddly baritone after the squeaking charms teacher. Again, it was book shaped wrapped in brown paper and Harry smiled “It is a book about traditional African magic. There are a few wandless spells within, but I trust that you and Draco will only use them in the presence of your teacher, hmm?”
I do not want my son to grow up that way. To be a pawn that Dumbledore uses. He is a child, a child who laughs so often, who loves his favourite toy Mr Nibbles the stuffed Rabbit that I make dance around his cot. Whom loves to cuddle into his mother’s hair as she rocks him beside the fire. He loves the nonsense poems by Edward Lear and positively delights in my singing voice (Which anyone would tell you in a miracle, Lily is positive I broke one of her best milk Jugs by singing).
“Yes, sorry…Just…Just a headache. Draco you should stay, I will go back to Dad and Moony” He whimpered rubbing at his forehead as it pulsated with pain. It was something that he normally only suffered when he had had bad dreams about a flash of light and a woman screaming and pleading.
“Cheeky flatterer” Severus laughed his face warm again and Harry felt happy he had managed to make the man relax once more. “Did you know your grandfather was quite the potioneer? He created the hair treatment that are taming those Potter locks of yours”
“Are we allowed?” Harry asked shyly his voice on the verge of vanishing and Draco cursed his distraction and moved closer to his nervous friend. He took his hand in his and Harry shot him a grateful smile his green eyes flashing more brightly than Masaki’s and Draco realised he was wrong Harry was the most beautiful guy he had ever seen. And wasn’t that a weird thing for a ten-year-old to think about his best friend. Masaki nodded happily saying in a loud voice
“Can you blame him? He seems to be rather attached to Harry already and you hurt him” Lucius’ eyes were steely as he leaned back in his chair his fingers holding the stem of his wine glass loosely and Severus felt his stomach knot with more guilt. He hadn’t inflicted the wounds on the boy but he as good as did by forcing him to reply them time and time again. However, he was not a man used to admitting fault and he had no idea how to apologise to Harry for what he had done.
“I think that maybe we should invite the Malfoys and Severus back into the room and talk about it” Remus sounded just as overcome as Harry and the ten-year-old nodded clearing his throat before weakly calling for Jinx. The house elf came immediately her large gnarled hand coming to rest on his as she gave him a smile.
“I’m extremely glad for that, Harry. You have made us incredibly happy being here” Lucius smiled guiding him into the house and down towards the rooms that they had used for their lesson with Nino. The main study was the same but when they went into the large white room Harry stalled as he saw the dummies. There were three of them as before but now they were made to look like the Dursley’s. It was obvious they were dummies, but they were so accurate that it caused his stomach to flutter for a moment. Narcissa was standing beside her son looking happy with her handiwork.
“I know Dragon, but I know that deep down your father means well. He does worry about you, Dragon. We can both see how deep you already are, we can see it in your face, in the photos. If things should end badly it will be you who suffers”
“Fond? You’ve practically stolen him Harry, he follows you as soon as he sees you in the garden.” Draco laughed and Harry grinned thinking about the Peacock he had taken to calling Francis. The bird was the youngest of the Malfoy peacocks and had taken a special interest in Harry loving nothing more than to sit with him having his neck stroked. “I have an owl, Ares, my family has a lot of animals though I wouldn’t call them pets really.”
“Harry! On your left!” Draco shouted throwing a few covering snowballs at his parents before diving onto his friend and knocking him down into the snow. Harry let out a muffled grunt, but his face was stretched into a huge grin.
“I’ve always loved the manor at night, the moonlight coming in through the windows, the peaceful silence of it”
“This is the best route from the Great Hall to the Ravenclaw dorm” Penelope told the first years leading them up a winding staircase towards one of the towers. The Gryffindors had been with them for a while but they had separated on a moving staircase with Pansy and Seamus telling them they would see them at breakfast the next morning. “You will be given a map in the morning along with your school lesson plan. Nobody is expecting you to know your way around straight away but if you can at least memorise the route from the dorm to the main hall you can find your way around from there.” Penelope led them up another flight of stairs and then stopped outside a painting of a beautiful lady on horseback. In one hand she was carrying weights and in the other a chaft of wheat. A golden crown was on her head looking almost like the rays of the sun. A flowing gown seemed to float around her and the horse and Harry recognised her from one of the paintings in the west wing of Malfoy manor.
Draco had the feeling that his father was talking about him. Narcissa had tried time and time again to get him interested in them but it just wasn’t his kind of thing. Harry didn’t say anything but a glance to his side told Draco that he was pleased. Nobody said anything further until they reached the pitch and then Harry let out a long loud gasp of;
“It’s only a game and I’m quick on my feet, I had to be with the Dursley’s, so I will be alright” Harry promised talking in a low whisper and Draco bit on the inside of his cheek fighting down his anger at the mention of the Dursley’s, it was something that he was getting good practice at doing, and he nodded at the plan.
“I believe he is a powerful wizard, but I believe he is also an old fool who has let that power go to an already inflated head. I believe that you and Harry are going to need all the help you can get, and I am happy to stand by you both.”
“And where have you been? My Duddykins has been looking for you all afternoon! He and his little friends wanted to play a game with you!” She raged and Harry caught sight of his cousin smirking through the doorway to the living room. They all knew what kind of game Dudley wanted to play with him, it was called Harry hunting and he almost always ended up with bruises all over his body or broken glasses. His glasses had been broken that many times that Harry was sure they were only held together by magic these days. He looked away from Dudley looking down at the floor.
“I have, I’ve been avoiding you, and unable to talk to you. I don’t, I don’t want that…But since…since your relationship. Since you had sex…All I can hear in my head is people…Muggles said some pretty horrible things…” Harry admitted slowly and Remus let out a breath moving from the desk to come over to him as well. Harry knew that his ears were burning brightly at the mention of sex and Severus had flinched just a little but seemed to carry on regardless.
“Show off!” Lucius snorted clapping him on the shoulder “Boys how about we show you a thing or two?”
Following Harry’s directions they eventually reached the centre of the maze and were amazed to find that the fountain had been changed to shoot chocolate milkshake from the nuzzle with glasses being held out by house elves, all kinds of desserts and treats were on the stone stools. There was a reward for the team for the fastest time and although they lost out to Blaise, Theo, and some other purebloods they did come second and each received a silver token with Samhain written on one side and the Malfoy crest on the other.
“Was Emperor Hashimoto a wizard?” Harry wondered out loud looking at the woman in the picture. The painting really wasn’t very helpful in giving an impression of the woman but the more he looked at her the more he could pick out features of her face. Like her eyes and her mouth.
“Dumbledore thinks I’m gonna be the next dark lord or something. Because my mum and dad wanted Sev and Rem to have me and not to let Dumbledore anywhere near me”
They left the reptile house and walked through the rest of the zoo. It didn’t have many animals but there was a large amount of people milling around and Draco made sure to move to the other side of Harry to hold his hand not wanting him to get nervous with the large crowd.
I have been writing when I can and when my mood has been in it but I’m deeply sorry if the chapter feels disjointed in any way! I haven’t watched fantastic Beasts so I know very little about the American wizarding system or school, so I won’t go into it too much, but I hope it was alright!
“I believe she said she would be near the Chimera enclosure” Lucius answered his top lip curling ever so slightly as he guided Narcissa around a muggle tourist that had stopped moving and was gazing up at the high walls. Harry felt nervous as eyes turned to watch them but soon enough, they were stepping through another door that muggles didn’t seem to see. A bubbly witch, sat in a ticket booth, smiled at them as she waved her wand to count them in taking the money.
“I accept Severus Tobias Snape and Remus John Lupin as my fathers” Harry announced swallowing nervously as Lucius held up the goblet and presented it to him.
“…Old Welsh family, Death eaters, but you’re talking about their son, Kaiden, I think you would be a good father for him.”
“Of course, I wouldn’t miss it. Um…Am I allowed to ask who the lucky guy is?” Ginny bit the corner of her mouth and then looked around the café once again before leaning forward and whispering despite the privacy charm.
“I’m sorrys master Lucius! Did he upsetten youse little Master Harry? Dobby is as coocoos as Dumbly of Hogwarts! Masters are too kind for lettings hims stay! Jinxes maken sures he won’t comes near youse again!” She promised squeezing his hand “Dunts lets Dobby scares you little Master Harry! Youse is safe and amongst friends!”
“No…She was really nice…She said…She said that there was something bad…Something inside me…It didn’t want to be tasted” Harry whimpered his scar throbbing as the four snake heads whispered between each other the male seemingly scolding Josephine. Masaki looked troubled his deep brown eyes watching the scene unfold trying to make sense of it.
“Of course, he had to get his intelligence from somewhere. Do you think I may be allowed to have a go at the dummies?”
The room itself was filled with flowers in long garlands that draped over wooden cupboards and the fireplace. The table was set for four but there were six high backed chairs with stuffed silk cushions. Intricate carvings ran up the legs and over the backs with the same swirling crest he had seen before throughout the house. China plates were laid out with pretty paintings over them and the table was covered with silver serving dishes filled with foods that Harry had only seen in the good housekeeping magazines that his aunt Petunia brought and spread around to impress the neighbours that she dragged in for coffee on a Tuesday morning. It was the kind of food that she tried to get him to recreate when they had guests. She had always gotten angry when he hadn’t been able to achieve it.
“No, but the Malfoys are one of the 28” Draco answered saying things that made no sense to him. He looked at the pale haired boy feeling extremely out of place in such a house. He still had no idea what had happened, why he was suddenly here with Draco, a witch policewoman and a strange creature that appeared to be cooing at him. It was all like a dream and he was glad when Draco took his hand. The hand felt real, warm and comforting, and he clung to it tightly as he was led towards the green doors.
“It has to be magic” Draco chuckled while Harry grinned with a nod. His skin was prickling with excitement his brain still struggling to believe that after this weekend he would have a father who cared about him. “Harry, you okay?”
“You as well, it appears that we may have started to grow up, Draco...” Harry smiled and he was almost positive that Nott rolled his eyes when Draco smirked just a little.
“If I touch you here does it hurt?” Tobias asked very lightly touching him on his hip and then the base of his spine.
“Sev, my dear and oldest friend, if you are hearing this message then I have died. I hope that I have had the courage to talk to you face to face before I died. I have so much that I wish I could say to you. I’m sorry. For everything that happened between us and I miss you. Nothing could take away what happened between us but I wish that we could move on, I have a son, Harry, James has made Sirius Black his godfather on his side but when it came to me, I couldn’t choose. James said that I should pick Remus but, in my heart, I wanted you so he only has one godfather but I hope that when you meet him you will be kind, as you were to me.
“Mrs Figg...She asked me if I would help her since I wasn’t doing anything useful” Harry muttered going through with the lie that Mrs Figg had come up with. Petunia sucked in a breath and Harry risked a glance. She clearly still wanted to rage at him but she knew how much Harry hated being with Mrs Figg and her many cats so it wasn’t as though he had been having fun had he?
To the outside world he acted as if the things he had seen and done during the war hadn’t affected him, however he couldn’t lie to himself and the night terrors had started almost as soon as Voldemort had died. Even the best potions had stopped working at their recommended dose and for a while he had been teetering on the edge of addiction to just get one night’s sleep. He had refused to in the end, positive that he didn’t want to end up like his Great Uncle Jasper, thrice removed, who had ended his days locked inside his own mind and had starved to death.
“Then I will be with good company, won’t I father? You think people have forgotten how you were in those last months at the Dark Lord’s side? A coward too afraid to stand up for his own family clutching to the robes of a mad man” Draco didn’t raise his voice, but his anger was there in every word. “You would think that you would have a better opinion of the man that spared you from Azkaban. Who spared you a lifetime of kissing the feet of a man who would sooner see you tortured”
“Yes, Aunt Petunia” Harry said bobbing his head before going to the pantry and getting the sack of potatoes. While he was carrying them back to the kitchen he didn’t notice Dudley’s foot until it was too late and he was falling forward his face smacking into the cupboard the potatoes going everywhere. The noise was enough to bring Aunt Petunia coming back into the kitchen shouting;
“A pear tree?” Harry Potter frowned as he sat at the Gryffindor table on a cold and wet December morning. The elves had just sent the food up from the kitchen and the mail had arrived with a large bulky package dressed in cheerful red and green paper. The owl that had brought it was unfamiliar but he had opened it easily enough surprised to find a glass box containing a miniature pear tree dressed with pretty ribbons. The base of the pot was white and blue fine bone China with the serpent Dragon flying around the base. “Who would send me a pear tree?”
“I’m sure the background checks will be completed by then” Remus was half teasing, but Harry could tell that his Papa was just as serious about the checks as his father and uncle. He had learnt over the last couple of weeks, since he had been adopted by Remus and Severus really, that the werewolf was very protective of him. More so around the full moon when he was closer to his wolf. Even with the potions Severus made and Harry had learnt to accept it rather quickly.
“Oh, I wouldn’t say that, I just like them from a distance rather than having them running towards me honking like a demon banshee. Are you okay? You seemed a little...Earlier...Your neck...” Draco hummed carefully his grey eyes moving to the spot on his neck that he always scratched and immediately Harry’s hand went to the spot clawing at it as he remembered what had happened in his aunt and uncles home.
“I believe that it is a brownie, Harry” Remus said in wonder peering into the box at the grumpy creature that was still looking thoroughly pissed off. “Brownie’s are sort of like House Elves, like cousins? Only they live in secret in the home and in exchange for gifts of milk and honey they will do chores. Fix shoes, and such…”
Seeing him today with Harry and Draco, the fond and genuinely happy smiles on his face as he showed the boys the village that they would one day visit brought back his feelings but he squished them down. What could a broken and twisted werewolf offer? He was unemployable, the curse made it impossible to be around people on the full moon and the small sum of money his parents had left him was almost dried up.
But I wanted to know if everyone thought this was too slow paced or fluffy so I can change the direction maybe... I'm sorry if that's the case 🙏 but please let me know so I can fix it
“Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington, at your service, sir” The ghost bowed and Harry gasped as his head slid from his shoulders almost coming completely away until it caught on a flap of skin which had clearly given the ghost his moniker as Nearly Headless. “I am the resident ghost of Gryffindor tower”
The snake opened its mouth revealing sharp fangs its head darting forward only to be stopped by the glass. Severus hurried forward and grabbed Harry’s shoulder pulling him back as the snake laughed. “
“Brownies are rare, Harry, and it is extremely good fortune to have one in the home. The last known family to have a brownie was the Knotts. It’s said that the Brownie found the Knott family treasure that had been lost for years!” Draco said excitedly having heard the conversation from where he was pretending to enjoy the drink.
Draco’s eyes were closed as he played his long fingers moving gracefully on the instrument. His teacher a tiny woman who was only an inch taller than the blonde was smiling as she nodded. The piece was beautifully haunting, and he held his breath afraid that if he even breathed too loudly, he would distract Draco from his lesson. When the song came to an end Harry applauded loudly causing his friend to blush brightly as he opened his eyes and lowered his violin. He gave a playful bow and then, after a nod from his teacher, put his violin away and came over to him.
“Well…Lucius Malfoy is your father and your father is Professor Snape…” The twins reasoned and Draco let out a sigh. They had been lucky so far, they had been expecting the press to get a hold of who Harry was before now, but they hadn’t, it was only a matter of time though. “Come on, what did the old coot do?”
“Not all, I only knew that I wanted it to be when the butterflies were most plentiful” Lucius said taking his wife’s hand and kissing the fingers lightly and Severus remembered the Malfoy wedding. There had been at least a million butterflies of all shapes, sizes and colours, floating around.
“I see, very well, now you boys go have fun I will send an elf for you” Narcissa rose gracefully and then moved around the table kissing Draco on the forehead before hesitating for only a second before doing the same with Harry her fingers running through his hair. “Go, enjoy yourselves”
“It is not a place to sleep!” Draco ragged hotly disturbing Narcissa who had been reading through her own letter from Mrs Figg. Her face was almost always pale but right now it was worse than it had ever been and she was chewing the inside of her cheek in an un-lady like way. “Mother, they are keeping him in a cupboard”
“Rocky please inform Minister Fudge that he is required immediately” Lucius said to the ancient house elf that was wearing a smart black and white pillow case. There was a crest on the front in silver and green silk and Harry recognised it as being he same symbol as one they had passed on the stairs when they had left the beautiful flower room. The elf bowed low and then clicked his fingers vanishing with a crack causing Harry to jump.
Harry screamed loudly clutching at her hand as they were pulled through the flames and Narcissa held to him tightly bringing him into her body so he couldn’t see the dizzying flashes of open fireplaces as they moved knowing that it could make him quite sick. In only a matter of seconds they jolted arriving at the fire place in France and she let them out gracefully, or as gracefully as one could with a confused ten year old clinging to their arm.
Severus had made an effort with his dress to appear less intimidating to Harry that morning. His wardrobe was rather limited to blacks and dark greys but he had put on a softer ensemble with just black trousers, boots, and the lightest grey shirt he owned. He wore no robe and he felt almost naked without it as he waited in the hallways of his oldest friends home. He hadn’t been able to forget the things he had seen in Harry’s memories and he had felt as though he had failed Lily for a third time.
“I’m sure he was just being dramatic on purpose. The rainbow snakes are known for being flamboyant must be hard not having anyone to talk to” Remus chuckled jovially while Severus’ dark eyes moved over the path the snake had taken. “Sevvie, what’s going on in that big brain of yours?”
“Harry, I have been convinced for many months that you would be in Ravenclaw. I would have liked you in my house but Ravenclaw is where you will do best. It is a good house, Harry, I am surprised that Draco was placed in Ravenclaw, not that you lack intelligence, but I have always thought you a true Slytherin.”
“The report claims that it makes it possible that the sufferer keeps his mind during full moons. I have looked into it myself and the theory is sound, he believes that he will have such a potion ready in ten years”
As Remus had predicted the Kelpies were under the water but there was a glass tunnel you could walk down. Harry stayed close to his father’s as they suddenly appeared underwater looking out at what appeared to be the bottom of a lake. The signs told them that it wasn’t only Kelpies but also Grindylows and Kappa swimming around as well as a fish called the faux mermen who technically wasn’t an exhibit but more of an employee who would clean the glass and make sure the other creatures were in tiptop shape. The fish had the lower body of a koi but the upper body of an almost humanoid. The strange little creature kept swimming to the glass and pulling faces before cleaning algae with a yellow coloured cloth.
“I would be hurt you didn’t trust me Severus but very well, I will agree. Would you like for me to go first?” She asked and Severus shook his head moving to the counter where he had a small collection of drinks, mostly gifts from the woman sitting in front of him. He poured a shot of whiskey and then poured in the truth serum into both glasses.
“Enjoying the chocolate, Harry dear?” She asked gently and Harry almost flew out of the chair his hand shaking so much chocolate fell to the floor around his feet. His face coloured his eyes filling with fear his body shrinking in a defensive way that was reminiscent of Dobby when he was about to start his dramatics only with Harry it looked very real. He dropped to the floor and started wiping it with the hem of his oversized t-shirt apologising loudly.
