The bedroom is what leaves Harry the most perplexed and makes his heart flutter in his chest madly. A neat wrought-iron bed is on the opposite wall to where Harry’s bed has always sat. The new olive green bedding looks fluffy and soft, even if Harry wants to scoff at the clearly Slytherin emerald-green-and-silver knitted blanket at the bottom of it. The room itself looks bigger somehow, but Harry can’t detect an expansion charm. It really is just the way the bed has been pushed to a different side to make room for a large chest of drawers, covered in small knickknacks. On the wall, instead of the photographs of family and friends Harry has encountered above the mantlepiece, there were two sets of four blue… photographs? Paintings? Harry remembers Hermione dragging him to an exhibition once and tell him about them, he knows they have a name he can’t remember, the paper getting exposed to light leaving it with that blue tinge. Whatever they’re called, there’s eight of them, arranged into two squares, simple floral motifs on each.
Harry leaves the store with a handful of shrunken bags, a mattress delivery time, and a delighted Malfoy who seems to have been greatly energized by the whole affair. Malfoy chatters about redecorating his bedroom now that he's no longer a "Wee Slytherin lad," (a phrase that sounds ridiculous in his posh accent) as Harry walks two blocks over to his new flat without thinking. As he comes to the building entrance he realizes he's just brought
Goyle was right. It was better to know. The potion was supposed to take five minutes to give its result; but was a great pile of nonsense. It took less than a minute for the potion to change from a swampy green to a bright cerulean blue. He was pregnant and Draco wasn’t even the slightest bit surprised. Bloody,
It did. Draco didn’t think that Braithwaite’s spell would result in any surprises, but he allowed himself to be led to the examining table. It felt odd, and off-putting, pulling up his jumper in that cold, unfamiliar room, especially with Goyle looking every bit as mortified as Draco felt. Thankfully, his belly was still as flat and taut as ever, and if anything, Marcus had been correct: he’d lost a couple of pounds in the previous few weeks.
Draco pulls his fingers nearly all the way out and then presses in again. He runs the pad of thumb around Harry's rim before pushing back in, teasing. He stretches Harry deeper this time, filling him up until his knuckles rest against Harry's arse.
This is the only thing Harry has - his identity - the only thing he could call his own. This is his choice. He holds onto Draco as he waits for his own blood to flow through his veins. He waits for Draco to wake up again.
"This is one of my favorites," Draco explains, stunned because he wasn't sure he would ever see this in person. "I read a lot about it during my studies. It's an allegory about love and loss. The candy pile represents the artists' partner who passed away from AIDS. You can touch this one, it's encouraged even to take some of the candy. It starts off weighing the exact weight as their partner and the shrinking pile represents the eventual loss of life.”
They both catch their breath and eventually Draco gets up, hissing when his cock slides out of Harry. Knowing that Harry is spent, he walks over to his wand and casts a cleaning charm on them both. He climbs back into bed and lets himself get pulled into Harry’s arms. His lips tingle and throb but he still turns to kiss Harry, as if to remind himself that this is quite real. Their noses bump and teeth clatter when Harry laughs and Draco tries to shut him up.
All bets are off after the dinner and cake cutting. There is dancing and laughter. They lose track of time, determined to get lost in the need to have a splendid evening.
The nightmares don’t go away. He’s accepted that he’s going to live with them for the rest of his life but he doesn’t let them dominate him. They are only reminders of his past and nothing more. He tries to focus instead on the lives he’s helped save with Draco compared to the ones he couldn’t save before he met him. Pansy was right: taking back the Citadel had been easy enough. Harry watched from a distance as everyone at the Citadel regarded Imperator Draco with a special kind of respect that even he knew Immortan Lucius had never received.
“I made a deal for safe passage through the Canyons. Though I’m supposed to be alone. That was the deal.”
Having her here now is all that he’s wanted. He remembers the day Sirius died like it was yesterday, even though he wants to forget. He vividly remembers the way she had screamed and smiled at Harry as she left him in the dust, laying in a pool of his own blood. He tried to crawl to Sirius' lifeless body but he couldn't move. He had never felt so weak, so pathetic and all he could do was cry and yell until his throat was hoarse. He was sure that he was going to die. That’s where Hagrid found him, passed out, sun burnt and feverish. He should have been dead. Hagrid told Harry as much when he finally woke up.
“New blood, eh? Heard he’s a real tasty one,” Gertie tells Draco, smiling and motioning towards the chair.
“Every time I saw you, all the time—nnh,” Harry sighs, eyes fluttering closed when Draco takes him back in his mouth again. “That night of the wedding, you looked so beautiful, so gorgeous. I wanted to kiss you so badly.”
A second later Draco sees blood and the werewolf falls at Pansy’s feet, a gaping hole in their head. Potter is there, shotgun in one hand and in the other is a pistol he throws to Draco. Padma runs into Pansy’s arms and they clutch each other, shaking.
Drago shrugs, feigning ignorance. “Hardly anyone can keep up with me at weddings. It’s not my fault I’m this way.”
It’s over in seconds, just as quickly as it started, with Draco pinned face down in the sand. The blood bag takes the gun and lets out three warning shots, all around Draco’s head before he feels the barrel of the gun push hard against the back of his skull. He closes his eyes and feels the fight leave his body.
At that moment, some of their friends walk into the kitchen, keen on eating the rest of the treats. Potter gets up from the table and Draco misses him already.
“Deep down I think I knew that she was gone,” he finds himself saying a few minutes later. The sun has started to set. “There was no way she was going to recover from the injuries she sustained that day. But I held out hope, the same way I was so sure I would see home again. She fought so hard to keep me here, far away from his clutches.”
“Merlin,” Draco mutters under his breath. He does not need the mental image in his head of Potter riding that bike. He’s seen it and it’s criminal. Once when Draco was visiting England, Potter had met him and their friends for a night out and had arrived on the bike. Draco pointedly avoided staring at how perfectly Potter straddled the bike, how his tight jeans were, practically bursting at the seams. That night Draco had wanked himself twice until he saw stars.
He looks across to Potter who has also gone completely still, holding the water container in his hands. He slowly moves, climbing down the Rig until he feels the solid ground under his boots. There’s no time to get the guns in the Rig, opening the door would be loud enough. Out of the corner of his eye he can see Luna and Ginny, huddled and slowly backing into the side of the Rig. Pansy is at the front, her arms spread in front them.
Instead, he takes Harry’s hand and leads them out of the kitchen and up the stairs. It’s late and his blood is thrumming alive in his ears because Harry is holding onto his hand, tight and so sure. When they reach his bedroom, Draco shoves Harry against the door. He remembers to lock the door.
Just then Potter drops the file on the dashboard and pulls back the muzzle, finally broken. He tosses it out the window and Draco looks at him.
It’s a lovely Sunday morning with Florence on the horizon and Draco looks at it with a longing in his heart. So much has happened here. They’ve decided to have a picnic last minute to join Teddy to watch him play while Aunt Andromeda and his mother head into town to do some shopping.
Draco relaxes at the table, rests his chin on a hand, and swirls around the ice cubes in his glass. The teasing is familiar territory for them. There are too many shared secrets and memories that the war shaped them to be. They share a plate of treats and it feels so simple and easy.
Draco turns over the postcard and it’s heavy in his hands. Printed on fine card stock, it has one of the paintings from said secret floor. From Mucha’s
Twenty minutes into their drive, it’s now or never. Draco turns the steering wheel and diverts the Rig off the main road.
Further hours in, when he’s the only one awake, the Rig starts to swerve sideways. Draco looks out and notices the patches of water throughout the ground. A bog. He eases off the pedal and maneuvers to avoid driving into a mud pile but it’s too late. The Rig comes to a complete stop, tires turning and engine revving. He looks at Potter and he’s already awake, looking out ahead.
He holds Draco close and shifts so that his face is in the crook of Draco’s neck. Harry is grateful that Draco doesn’t ever ask him to stay, knows him far too well that being at the Citadel for too long doesn’t sit well with him. The idea of finally having a place to call home is appealing but sooner or later his mind convinces him that he doesn’t deserve it. Still, Draco is always there to welcome him home each time. And knowing that he has Draco to come back to helps sooth the furious cold whispers that dwell in the back of his mind.
“The savior of the world can't stop himself from helping said world,” Draco teases. He brings a chocolate-covered strawberry to his mouth and takes a bite. Potter watches him, eyes dropping to Draco’s mouth.
He pulls up his scarf and pulls down his goggles. He knows he can lose them in the storm. He’s driven through them and made it out every single time. As they drive closer, he gets a thrill at seeing that there is no horizon and instead a wall of dust and wind, impossibly large and daunting.
“You need to take the War Rig up on higher ground away from the mud.” Potter says, turning to face him. “I’ll go. Buy you some time.”
Knowing he’s being watched, Draco slowly moves and starts the sequence to start the Rig. He reaches in between his legs under his seat until he pulls out a file and hands it out to Potter.
For dinner, Draco settles on serving beef stroganoff over buttered noodles that he prepares with small help from Teddy. Potter, wanting to make himself useful, goes about setting the dining table.  It should feel weird, but instead, Draco finds it comforting and familiar. It's not different than all the other times he ran into Potter whether at his aunt Andromeda’s home or at their friends’ homes. He’s content to let his mother ask all the questions during dinner, curious to know what Potter’s been up to. He's not ready to find out that Potter's been doing work at the Manor.
Draco arrives in London at 12:45 on a Wednesday. The first thing he does after he checks into his hotel is visit the National Portrait Gallery. He’s been away two years and luckily his trip back coincides with catching the very last days of a traveling exhibition that first opened in Madrid.
Aunt Andromeda looks as lovely as ever and Teddy trails behind her. He runs into Draco’s open arms and he hugs him tight.
They haven’t been detected yet. Draco forces himself to move but it’s as if he’s stuck, his feet fixed to the mud, wet and cold. An unbearable sense of dread washes over him. They are helpless like this. They stand perfectly still as the werewolves walk up closer, until one is right in front of Draco, and he stares into their eyes.
On the Gigahorse, Harry watches as the last war boy slams Draco against the door hatch. Even through the roar of the engines he can hear both of them yell as they fight over the last harpoon. There’s a brief moment where Harry doesn’t recognize Draco and the inhuman source of pure rage written all over his face.
It takes a while for the memory to joggle something in him, and when it finally clicks, he looks up at Potter, stunned. “That was you? The ambush attack on the Death Eaters in the hills past the Bullet Farm, that was you?”
Harry crawls on the bed and settles against the pillows and with a flick of his hand, his clothes are gone. Draco looks at him, raising an eyebrow and Harry just grins back at him. What a showoff.
“We can’t breathe down there!” eventually comes a voice. Draco looks back down at the open hatch on the floor and sees Ginny come through. She coughs and looks around the darkened sky.
Harry comes with a cry, untouched and all over himself. Draco’s thrusts become erratic when he feels Harry clench down hard on his cock, riding his orgasm. He leans down to kiss Harry through the last of the aftershocks of pleasure. He’s breathing hard, he’s so close, and suddenly Harry’s hands are on his face, pulling him close. His lips slide across Draco’s cheek, murmuring his name and sweet nothings, breath hot. Telling Draco he’s
He knows his lips are red and can feel Draco’s gaze on him, hot and fierce. Instead Draco pulls his hand back and takes a bite of his own. Harry watches him, with a warm smile on his face. Draco’s eyes widen as he chews. Harry lifts a finger and swipes a droplet of juice at the corner of his mouth.
No one says anything but then, the same back door creaks loudly and Ginny is there. She looks at them with a satisfied smile on her face as she takes Luna’s hand and climbs back inside.
“Are you alright?” Ginny asks Potter, looking down at his hand. “I can heal your wound if you would like me to.”
“Bolt cutters,” the blood bag says then, and with a flick of the wrist he’s pointing the gun towards Padma. With his other hand he lifts the chain that’s connected to the back of his muzzle.
“Yeah,” Harry says, trying to relax, trying to hide the fact that he’s blushing, “It’s just been a while.”
He only has a few more seconds before the werewolf is out of reach. Draco walks up next to Potter, who looks at Draco from the corner of his eye. Potter says nothing, just holds up the rifle for Draco. He takes it, settles the barrel over Potter’s shoulder and turns the scope.
Draco shakes his head, looking up at the ceiling past the giant skylights. He can’t see anything but his reflection. “I bet it’s gorgeous in the mornings.”
When Padma has him distracted, Draco takes his chance. He tackles the blood bag to the sand. They wrestle for the gun and eventually Draco wins again. He moves the barrel of the gun so that it’s directly under the blood bag’s chin. He doesn’t hesitate—pulls the trigger and it misfires with a pathetic sizzle. Draco frowns, confused before meeting the blood bag’s and he’s smiling at Draco. The next thing he feels is pain in his jaw and he’s on his back, eyes blinking back the scorching sun, his own hands reaching to grab onto anything.
“I sometimes come here still. When the days are harder. Helps me get my mind off things. Though it’s different when I don’t have my own personal tour guide telling me what to look out for.”
“Guilty as charged,” Potter says in the end, shrugging with a crooked smile. “In the meantime, I've been fixing up Grimmauld Place which is almost finished. I finished work on the top floor this Spring. I’m figuring out what to do next. I'm thinking the gardens?”
“Ah, yes, me,” Draco says dryly, rolling his eyes. “Clearly you had no plan. I saved your life that day. They would have bled you dry. I don’t blame you,” he then adds quietly. “For wanting to kill my aunt.”
“Not with your cock,” Harry says, his hands on Draco’s chest, wanting to touch everywhere. “God... forgot how good this feels. How you feel. ‘M not gonna last.”
“You’re right,” Draco says as he fits himself between Harry’s spread legs. He lovingly runs a hand along the underside of Harry’s thighs. “I fucking love it.”
He hears Luna softly sing behind them. Padma’s head is on her shoulder, fast asleep. They have a lamp light fire going settled between Padma’s legs. Out here in the desert, the night sky is beautiful. Moonlight shines off the sand and glitters like gemstones.
The marble is cold against his bare feet when he lightly pads into the kitchen. He has in mind what he could bring back up, realizing as well that he could eat something too. He pulls a bottle from the wine cellar and carefully settles an assortment of leftover treats, cheeses, meats, and fruit on a cutting board. He carefully levitates them and walks back up the stairs and to his bedroom. Harry is still on the bed, the sheets pooled at his hips and he looks over to Draco when he walks through the door. He sets the board and wine at the small table in front of the fireplace and tends to the embers.
“A lifelong reminder of what would happen if I tried to leave again,” Draco tells Potter, pointing towards the leg brace. It helps him stand, keeps him from suddenly falling over should it give out. He made it himself from scraps of metal. “Happened as soon as I came back to the Citadel after running away with my mother.”
“Hear that, Draco? My wife is looking for me. Do get home in one piece, alright? See you at New Years,” she says before leaving.
Dinner is amazing and they all eat to their heart's content. There is plenty to eat from and when the spread is all laid out on the dining table, Draco lets out a sigh of relief. The desserts are an assortment of small cakes and treats from a local bakery. The table’s favorite turns out to be the chocolate and pistachio-covered biscotti. He grins into his wine glass as he watches Potter and Teddy fight over the last one. In the end, Potter begrudgingly offers it to Teddy saying it’s only out of the kindness of his heart.
At times it feels hopeless when Draco looks at the rear mirror and sees the war parties trailing behind them. They wasted no time catching up to Draco and his War Rig. Death Eaters and polecats. They swing on poles fixed to the vehicles. He’s always hated them. This time though, Draco has his family. Hermione covers the rear of the Rig with Poppy. And one look at Potter, at his right, is enough to settle his nerves. They can do this.
Harry leans back on the bed and lets out a soft sigh. His hips start to rock down on Draco’s fingers shamelessly, trying to get more. He fucks Harry like this for a while, so sweetly and without rush. He crooks his fingers and rubs trying to look for that sweet spot. He watches the way Harry’s cock leaks precome at the tip, lazily leaving a trail on his happy trail. He leans down over Harry’s neck and kisses him there, on his collarbone. He loves the bittersweet taste of his sweat mixed in with soap. He continues laying kisses down Harry’s chest, moving to mouth at one nipple, softly biting it the same time he twists his fingers.
Draco fumbles for a bit to find where to sit after saying hello to everyone. He casually listens in on a conversation Ginny is having with Dean and Neville about the recent Harpies match. For the most part, though, he’s content to nurse his drink. Just then he feels hands land on his arms and he turns and Luna is there, looking at him with bright eyes.
By the time they go through two bottles of firewhiskey, Draco is perfectly content to melt into the couch. He feels a lightness to himself and giddy. One of the house cats, Phoebe, has climbed into his lap and lightly nips his fingers for pets. Pansy sits next to him and Potter sits on the floor between her legs. She lazily runs a hand through Potter’s hair all the while having a perfectly normal conversation with Ron about Ministry work.
“Draco, you’re beautiful,” Harry says as he touches him, hand finally wrapping around his cock. Draco bites his lip and spreads his knees, and slowly thrusts into Harry’s hand. Precome pools from the head and Harry presses the end of his thumb against the slit, watching intently when Draco’s hips stutter. It’s agony, how much he wants this to last. His strokes start off slow, teasing even. He draws precome down Draco’s cock with the pad of his thumb, lightly trailing the underside of his cock all the way down to his balls.
There was a reason why they did the supply runs during the day—why Draco grew up with tales of the dangers of the night. It seemed like a myth, a folk tale. Out here now, in the middle of the bog, it felt very real. Far in the distance behind them, Draco sees them. He has to narrow his eyes, adjusting to the flicker of motion: a large shadow moving through the fog.
Potter looks over the plains and stays silent. Draco has never felt him more distant than right now. He wants to reach out, wants to take Potter’s hand, wants to bring him back. Draco wants him to come with them.
Finally, he pulls off Harry’s cock, lips wet with spit and precome, and runs his tongue alongside his lips. He pulls his fingers free from Harry’s arse. The obscene squelch of lube makes his own cock ache, precome dripping from the tip.
Draco reaches for him and Harry lets himself be moved. Draco’s fingers softly pull at his hair again and he closes his eyes as Draco gently pushes his head down onto his cock. He rolls his hips when Harry wraps his lips around the cockhead.
“It’s worth remembering,” Potter says, so close and watching Draco. “I haven’t forgotten,” he continues, voice low. “I left a part of myself here, with you.”
When Potter doesn’t respond Draco clears his throat. "Sometimes hope is all that you can have in this godforsaken world. Without it you might as well be a half-life, waiting to die."
Draco drops a sugar cube into his tea and gently stirs his spoon. Mindful of the lapful of Harry, he takes a drink and sets the cup to his right. He eyes the rest of the picnic spread on the blanket with a sense of satisfaction. There’s a slight breeze and he moves his hand to his hat, careful to not let it get blown away in the air. The sun hangs high in the air, beaming down on them.
There was nothing for it. The Weasleys had gone all out to make him feel welcome, and the last thing Draco wanted was to be was the same prickly git he’d been as a teenager. “Please don’t be,” he said, taking her hand and placing it on his tummy. “Thank you for inviting me for dinner. You have a lovely home.”
The next morning, Draco was idly leafing through one of the pregnancy books that Pans had sent over weeks before, lazing about in the settee, when Harry Firecalled and suggested that the two of them meet in Café Quendryth. Despite all of Greg’s valiant efforts, Draco found his resolve crumbling the moment that the other wizard opened his mouth.
"Potter, are you ever going to show me your bedroom? I did help you buy everything in it, I think I should get to see the fruits of my labor."
Draco had to laugh. The last time he’d actually left Pansy speechless had been at Hogwarts. Her boyfriend at the time, a git of a Ravenclaw from the year above, had tried to kiss him, so Draco had hexed his mouth tight shut and cursed him with warts.
Harry follows Malfoy into the kitchen. He hops up on the counter watching Malfoy tweak lavender sprigs and rearrange cupcakes on their gold platters.
Finishing his tea, Draco had excused himself, wanting to get changed into his loosest black trousers. He had been holding his current pair up with a Sticking Charm for a week or so, and he wasn’t about to let Harry into that particular little secret. Reality dawned the moment that Draco pulled the trousers over his thighs and tried to force the clasps together. He sucked all the air out of his lungs, sent a fervent prayer up to Merlin, and tried his very hardest to get the two sides to meet.
In the attic, the most curious item he finds is a painting of someone in an Auror uniform, slashed up so badly Harry would be tempted to described it as Sectumsempra’d, if that wasn’t a ridiculous idea. He can’t recognise the face but the painting makes him feel weird in his chest so he leaves the exploration of the attic for a later time.
It seemed a little like an enchantment to Draco, the way that Harry could take a collection of ingredients and combine them into something truly delicious. He let his hands rest on his bump and wondered how he was going to tell Greg, Pansy and his mother that he was moving into Grimmauld Place in slightly under a week’s time. They’d decided the night before to leave it until after their twenty-week appointment at St Mungo’s. Draco could hardly comprehend that his life was changing as fast as it was, but it felt entirely right.
"This is not pretension, Potter. I can admit I have many pretensions but this is not one of them. Good bread is transcendent, it's a spiritual experience. I read that religious Muggles have bread eating rituals during their ceremonies, and they're on to something, Potter."
Harry grinned at Draco’s flippancy. “It’s a bit more than breaking bread. Molly’s roast dinners are feats of endurance, and she’ll take it as an insult if you don’t have at least two plates of seconds. Don’t eat breakfast! Are you sure that you’re ready for this?”
Draco shivered in the charm-cooled examination room as the witch had cast her magic over him, and then he’d wept at the sight of their baby. The umbilical cord was well-formed, and the amniotic sac was doing its job, nestling their baby and keeping them safe.
It truly was. Everything was homely, and there were photographs decorating every surface. Before much longer, Harry and he found themselves sat at a very long bench, extended by magic, with a very delicious dinner in front of them. There wasn’t any of the formality of eating at the Manor, and various insults, jokes and banter pinged around them as they enjoyed their food. It was only as Draco was enjoying his Apple Strudel that he realised that a person who ought to be sat around the table wasn’t. He gave Harry a quick nudge with his elbow.
“It’s pre-game nerves,” Draco mumbled, sleep beginning to overtake him. “Wake me for warm-up, would you, mate?”
“I know it’s chaotic,” Harry said, looking at the same pictures Draco was. “’Mione laughs at them all. Calls it the museum of my life. I can’t help it. I love photos.” Harry looked at the image of Hagrid, stood beside a Thestral. “A photograph album, filled with pictures of my parents, was one of the very first presents I was ever given. One of the first things that was truly my own, gifted freely. I’ve hoarded them ever since.”
“Oranges need to be peeled and all the pith needs to be removed. Don’t use a spell. He likes the smell on your hands. Nectarines and peaches stain. Be careful. And learn stain removal charms for when you can’t be careful. Learn the spell to cut the tops of strawberries off with the little zigzag shape, too.”
“First things first,” she said, her quill springing into action and scribing her every word. “Draco, how have you been? Is everything okay with you and the baby? Any niggling worries or concerns?”
"Merlin help me, I do." Malfoy sinks one hand into Harry's thick hair, tugging lightly as he leans down to kiss Harry again.
“What about the other father?” asked Hayes, not pulling her punches. “Is he planning to be involved with your baby and the pregnancy?”
“I’ve just vomited half my body weight,” Draco croaked in reply, sliding under the quilt, shaking even though he was fully dressed. “Bit of a redundant question, Greg.” He pulled the quilt up to his chin, casting a wandless Warming Charm on the material. Draco sighed and puffed out a breath. His mate didn’t deserve his snit, even though he was accustomed to Draco’s moods. “I
An indeterminate amount of time later, an hour or maybe a week, Malfoy says, "I need to go into Diagon Alley for a few things."
Ron comes home with a pizza just as Harry is lying prone on the sofa, perishing from both hunger and Malfoy related ailments.
Luna, having obliterated Harry's previous worldview, picks up her crochet again, hooking more stitches and humming softly to herself. They sit by Malfoy's bedside, quietly sharing the space, for most of the afternoon. Luna says goodbye sometime around tea, leaving Harry alone with a still-sleeping Malfoy.
Draco wasn’t entirely convinced by Harry’s warm words. Family, when he was growing up, hadn’t been this loose association of loved ones that Harry believed in. Family had been synonymous with blood, and ancestors, and surnames. It hadn’t been this ramshackle collective of wix, as diverse as the building that held them. Without even thinking, Draco took hold of Harry’s hand and held it tightly, nerves rolling through him.
Draco held Harry’s hand during their twenty-week appointment. He was certain that Mediwitch Hayes approved, though she didn’t mention it.
Harry kissed him; his own face wet with tears. “A baby girl,” he whispered. Thank you, Draco. Thank you for my baby girl.”
The easy answer would be since Café Quendryth. Harry had been so caring, so considerate and nothing had been too much trouble. Harry had brought cakes, tincture and fluffed up his pillow. He’d massaged Draco’s tense shoulders and he’d brought him cups of fizzy pumpkin juice whenever he’d had morning sickness. That’d be the easy answer, but Draco didn’t think it’d be the truthful one.
She sits at the table, glass of wine in one hand, quill in the other, reading from a four foot long roll of parchment while Malfoy stands in the kitchen chopping and stirring and saying things like, "The 1732 Dissolution of the Wizengamot is
, and Harry couldn’t have looked more wounded, had Draco have used his wand. “I did,” he said, raising his hands, more defeated than Draco thought he’d ever seen him. “I fucked you, and I left you. Yes, I did those things, and I’ve regretted it ever since! Fuck, but I’d liked you a long time. Even at school you were always there, always on the edge of things and then-"
the next day. Draco heaved a sigh, and flicked off his wireless. Harry was a free agent, and there wasn’t much point in feeling jealous.
Harry does. He doesn’t care if this is weird as hell, he does. And he knows Other Harry can hear it, there’s no way he can’t but Harry can’t stop himself from hyperventilating, because it’s real. It’s all real. Other Harry is…
“The thing is,” Draco answered, loading up, his fork, “I’ve been having a few funny eating habits these last few weeks.” He paused. Mother had paused in her eating and was looking at him intently. “It is- Well, the thing is- “
“If you wish,” Draco answered, privately thinking that Harry was fussing about nothing. It wasn’t as easy for wizards to get pregnant as it was for witches. For two chaps to get pregnant meant that their magic signatures had to be nearly identical in strength and capability, and Draco hardly imagined that was the case with Harry and he. Draco felt the tingling prickle of the Contraceptive Charm washing over him. It was odd. Draco usually loathed the feeling of other wizard’s magic – he’d utterly forbidden Cormac from ever casting Warming Charms over him – but with Harry it didn’t feel quite as objectionable. A
Harry pays for his quilt, barely listening as Ms. Quincy tells him the pick up day and time. Back outside on the slushy streets of Hogsmeade, Harry takes several deep breaths of cold air hoping to clear his head but it doesn't work.

. For them, Harry and he were just lines of text, copy to sell papers, but this – what the two of them had between them, their baby too – couldn’t be defined by scandalous headlines and cliché, tired words. Perhaps he was hormonal? Unquestionably, he was tired, the heavy dinner and the shock of the so-called
Bobbing tendrils of white cup shaped flowers in floating planters above the door caress their heads as they walk through the cloudy film. Which honestly, Harry finds a bit creepy. He doesn't want to be caressed by vines every time he walks into his bedroom. What if he forgets to water them and they decide to strangle him instead?
He is sandwiched between Hermione and Ron in a tight hug and he sinks into it, the warmth of it, the love of it. His friends. His friends who, in a few years, will have a tiny little smiley toddler and another baby on the way. His friends who, if the photographs in the wall are anything to go by, if what Other Harry has said is true, not only accept but approve of and love Draco Malfoy. His friends he keeps pushing away, despite needing them more than ever.
“Brush up on your Astronomy. You’ll go star gazing. A lot. And when it comes to star gazing and the many other outings he will drag you to, pack an extra jumper. Fleece-y. The thick kind. He is always cold, but refuses it to admit it.
In the morning he does what will be his new routine for the next little while, feeding Yip at the Manor, retrieving items Malfoy has deemed "essentials", picking up a pastry breakfast to surprise Malfoy because he wants to make Malfoy happy. He can admit it. He wants the wanker to smile that little happy smile he always gets when he's eating something he really enjoys. So he gets kouign amann because they never got to eat the kouign amann they bought the day Malfoy was attacked and Harry has not yet known Malfoy to not want a kouign amann at all times.
He wants to make something special for breakfast. Something besides porridge. Only Potter seems to love porridge, so perhaps something like porridge, something like… polenta. Polenta with cream and honey and the special Fiori di Sicilia extract Draco owl ordered that smells like citrus bathed vanilla, and a fan of sliced blood oranges. The red blood oranges will look very pretty on top of the yellow polenta and golden honey. He hopes Potter likes it.
exclusive about Harry and he that she’d dropped her wine glass. Mrs Zabini had been visiting, and the dignified witch had fixed the smashed glass with a Reparo, whilst chastising Millie’s mother for being “so frightfully provincial – all the young people are scorning life bonds nowadays”. Greg snorted with laughter. “Of course, neither Mils or I had the nerve to admit that we already knew.”
“I didn’t think that’d be so emotional,” Harry said, as soon as they stood outside of St Mungo’s. They’d both been given little images of their
"I don't completely trust them, I'm not an idiot, Dumbledore has asked me to try and sway them to join our side of things, right now they probably see this as a way to get me to Voldemort but if I can sway them things could be different."
Blaise glared at Harry. "Never do something like this again, or I will personally see to your suffering."
“I thought I had lost you, this all happened because of me! I should be the one comforting you but I’m too weak to stop crying, I have been so worried.”
Harry was shocked that it had been that easy to get the information since he has been asking her all week, Harry just gave her a grin. "Mione that's great, Charlie is a great guy."
Harry on the other hand had no idea what a wizard oath was, he didn’t want to seem idiotic by asking what one was and also was unsure whether he could trust whatever the other man said one was, but he knew veritaserum, had seen it used and trusted it a lot more than the oath, he just had one problem. How could he be sure that it would really be the serum he took and not some other potion and then continue to lie?
"Don't worry the order weren't the ones to save you" Harry smiled and let out a breath he didn't know he had been holding.
Draco nodded "Okay but about the kiss the other day, it clear by the way you have been avoiding me that you don't feel the same so let's go back to just friends."
"Th-anks" Harry's voice was croaky from the screaming plus the panic attack. Draco moved away from Harry.
Harry smiled "It's my goal to put everyone through the hell I went through, except the people that stood by me of course."
Draco chuckled “Of course not I had some fun before silencing" Seeing the annoyed look on Harry's face he adds quickly "I was supposed to come, next time wait until I'm here to leave".
"Fine" Harry threw his book to the floor and left Hermione by herself. He was sick of her getting back with that jerk, he knew it was her life and he had no place in how she lived it, but it wasn't the first time Victor had broken her heart and Harry always was the one to pick up the pieces just to watch her make the same mistakes over and over again. It pained him.
Blaise laughed. "The dark Lord told him to teach a bunch of SLytherins who have made his life hell, how you would feel if the roles were reversed."
"Don't worry the order weren't the ones to save you" Harry smiled and let out a breath he didn't know he had been holding.
Rita now had a devilish gleam in her eyes as she smiled wickedly at Harry. “Well Harry, let’s start at the beginning.”
Tom took Harry's hand and led him around the zoo; they saw lots of animals such as the Augurey, Clabbert, Chizpurffle, Erking, Horklump and many others. Harry had a wonderful time. During seeing the animals Harry and Tom spoke about their favourite things and just got to know each other better.
"I just wanted to say to not listen to what the others are saying, there being idiots…Why should you fight for them when they won't even fight for themselves? They have all gone bonkers, I'm on your side, and so is Luna by the way." Neville said this all blushing.
Harry waited for Luna to have her quill and parchment out as well before saying a word. “I’m here to tell the truth, because it’s about time I told it and everyone deserves to hear it.”
Hermione shook her head "I don't want to talk about it, besides you’re not really my real brother." She huffed.
Once Harry was dressed, she combed his hair before running her hand through it. He gave her a questioning look she responded. "It gives you the I just got shagged look."
Harry put his arms up in surrender “Okay, okay sorry" He gave her a smile to reassure her “so what are you doing here then."
With a flick of his wand the man had the room lit, Harry stared closely at the man was the tall dark and handsome type from fairy tales he had neat black hair, chocolate brown eyes, perfectly tan skin, his jaw line was sharp and perfectly fine lips. He was tall and muscled, Harry eyes widened as he realised who this man was. He didn't say anything just sat there in shock. Voldemort shook with laughter as Harry looked at him, "You have hair!"
He then walked away without another glance at Harry but even without looking at his face he knew Tom was upset.
Harry then hugged his best friend with a laugh “I’m here if you need me Drake" Draco leaned into the hug “I’m fine, just didn't get much sleep.”
Before Harry could say anything, Hermione had him in a bone crushing hug. "Oh Harry, thank Merlin you’re okay". Before Harry could complain she spoke “Harry what are you doing out of bed, you shouldn’t be walking around, in your condition”
No one said anything but continued to watch the three in confusion not once did anyone look away, they all seemed to be waiting for the secret to be found out but not one of the trio said anything regarding their actions. Harry complained about having to go to classes while Draco got the day off, Hermione made sure that Draco would be doing work so that made Harry feel a little better.
After Tom left the three went to Harry's room and got more acquainted. Harry learned Draco wasn't such a prat, he and Hermione still argued but it seemed more as fun then an actual argument. Draco learned about why Harry left the light and Draco told Harry about his home life. Soon Draco went home promising to return soon with decorations for Harry's boring room. Hermione and Harry talked about how weird it was to be in the dark lords home and friends with Draco Malfoy their school rival.
this. The sheets of his bed were cool on his heated skin and he let out a gasp as Tom practically ripped off his pants.
With Resolve he didn’t think he had in that moment he finally made eye contact with his maybe sworn enemy. That was all it took, looking at the man once again, after all the thinking during the week, this was when he finally knew what his answer was again, he was over the shock now and could finally answer honestly.
"Out of the question, Harry Voldemort is as gay as they come; he admitted it when I questioned him". Harry was too shocked to say anything, Voldemort was gay? That sounded weirder then him courting Hermione.
"What's the matter Harry, do I make you feel uncomfortable" Harry tried to speak but all that came out were rasping breaths as Tom once again nibbled Harry ear. "Tell me to stop and I will" he started to place kisses down Harry's neck, despite the fact that Harry's mind was screaming stop, his body reacted by tilting his neck to the side to give the man better access. A groan escaped as Tom sucked on the sensitive part of his neck lightly. The next thing Harry knew he was pulled from the chair and pushed against the wall and Tom claimed Harry's lips with his own. Harry gasped which Tom talk as an invitation as Tom's tongue explored Harry's mouth. He groaned Harry tasted faintly of cinnamon, Tom guessed Harry had been cooking once again. He pulled Harry closer and Harry's hands made their way into Tom's hair messing the usually neat hair. Tom smiled into the kiss and was shocked when Harry all of a sudden pushed Tom away. "Stop" was all he said.
Draco smiled “Even in your sleep you looked exhausted I left you to sleep in... Though you went and slept the whole day away."
Harry nodded and Draco smiled at him "Don't get me wrong it totally sucks, but I can't control the fact that you are falling for two people, I just have to try harder."
Harry and Hermione thought it was hilarious. When the three weren't pulling pranks and having fun they were in the library studying and learning new things about anything and everything. However no matter how much they asked Harry would not tell them how he had been injured; even Tom could not get it out of them, who joined them for dinner each night.
Sirius was in hysterics "Hahaha holy hell they still do that, I remember James trying to get Lilly's attention he did the same thing after he read about it in a magazine!"
“I couldn’t possibly,” Draco cut in, horrified by the idea of such familiarity. “They’d think me uncouth, Harry! What a breach of good manners. I wasn’t brought up to fall asleep in other people’s bedrooms.”
Asleep, Harry looked very young, almost like the seventeen-year-old who’d vanquished Voldemort. Of course, Harry was still only twenty-three, but he hadn’t had an easy time of it in recent years. Once the top Seeker in Europe, Harry had been injured when he fell from his Firebolt during a storm. Draco had been sat on the Reserves Bench and he could still remember the crunch of bones shattering when Harry had smashed hard into the ground.
It starts innocuously enough. Malfoy complains Harry doesn't have milk for the tea. So they go to the grocery store to get milk. And while they're there, Malfoy says, "Wouldn't it be nice to have some apricot pistachio biscotti to go with the tea?" and Harry agrees and then there's two types of flour, oats, dried apricots, pistachios and butter in his trolley. Then they get back to Harry's flat and Harry doesn't have a biscuit sheet. So they go get a biscuit sheet. And a few spatulas, some mixing bowls, measuring cups and spoons and baking parchment.
Harry’s hand curled around the bump, delighted and reverential. “I can’t believe you’re here. You, and our baby. I love you, and I’m going to keep that promise I made. I’m going to be the best – the best for both of you. Thank you for coming to Grimmauld Place, Draco. Thank you for being here.”
Ron leaves the kitchen laughing. Harry makes sure Ron's occupied in the living room with Hermione before turning around in Malfoy's arms. He tilts his head up for a kiss but Malfoy doesn't bend down to meet him.
He wakes up early Monday morning with disgusting breath, a headache, and vague memories of someone rubbing his back while he vomited several cupcakes into the toilet and Ron's too-loud voice in his ear as he half carried Harry to his bedroom. Harry's never been that drunk before.
"This is a terrible idea," Harry says. Ron and Malfoy look at Harry with similar expressions of defiance on their faces and the absurdity of Ron and Malfoy responding the same way to anything makes Harry feel more than a little hysterical. He laughs weakly. "This is a terrible idea," he tries again. Malfoy puts his hands on his hips. Ron arches an eyebrow.
Draco unattached the box and opened it up. Inside, nestled in blue satin, were a glass phial and a note.
Neville laughs. "You're barmy if you think I'm making a bouquet for Draco Malfoy. But I might stand in the same room as him at the next party."
– settle into his face. “And I promise not to harass you with owls in the meantime, though I do believe Elianna was beginning to fall in love with you. There’ll be no more fibrous fruit, however good it might be for you. Swear to Merlin.”
incantation. Greg sat up in his bed, wand in hand, and gave Draco an incredulous look. “Bloody hell Malfoy!” he grumbled, picking up his wristwatch and squinting at it. “It’s past two. We’ve got a fucking match tomorrow! We lose again, and Flint will have our arses.” Greg paused, narrowing his eyes. “And where d’you think you’re sneaking off to?”
"No, of course, Potter, excellent deduction. I decided to poison the Savior while under house arrest and Ministry surveillance. Thank Merlin you're on the case, they might never have figured out it was nasty Malfoy with the bloody—"
Draco hadn’t expected to be told any different, and he knew, really, that he ought to be devastated.
Harry feels shame warming his cheeks. Not only is he crouching in some rose bushes like a pillock, he hasn't made time to see Luna in months.
Harry looks up from peeling the label on his butterbeer to meet the looks on his friends' faces, knowing they're all thinking of everything they've been through, all the grief and terror, and he quietly agrees that yeah, a lot can happen in a year.
Draco wakes up with Harry's warm body flung over him, his hair tickling Draco's nose. It's divine. It's completely unexpected; an unexpected that started eight years ago and grew deeper and more far away with every interaction. Though Draco might have nursed a tiny impossible seedling of a wish that he could somehow have Harry's attention on him in some way other than disgust, he never thought it would actually happen. He never thought he'd be in Harry Potter's bed, snuggled up to him.
Draco finished his mouthful, took a sip of his tea and nodded. “A little bit,” he said. “An archetypical Gryffindor.” He took a deep breath. “But thank you,” Draco said, “for coming over today… And for wanting to be involved.”
"Hermione wouldn't let Ron and I shrink her books, she says the text looks funny when it's returned to size."
They enter a little shop Harry's never noticed before called Quincy's Quality Quilts. Inside it's brightly lit with neat rows of fabric stretching so far ahead of them Harry knows the space must be magically enhanced. It looks like Harry could walk the distance of the Quidditch pitch and not reach the end of the fabric displayed. He thinks there should be brooms available to browse from.
Draco bends over Other Harry, lips to the shell of his ear, and asks, softly, “Are you sure, sweetheart?” but Other Harry only nods.
Hermione is sitting at the table, feet tucked up in her chair and eyes crinkled at Harry over the top of her mug of coffee. "Some night," Hermione says, cryptically. "There's cupcakes still, if you'd like one for breakfast."
“This is Skeeter we’re talking about,” Harry answered. “She can spin anything to sound fucking appalling.” He swallowed the last of his beer and placed it on the table with a definitive click. “Okay, Draco. If you’re really sure.” Draco was. He nodded his consent, and Harry began to read.
Two minutes and a vigorous teeth brushing later, Harry sticks his head in Malfoy's Floo and says, "Do you want to get dinner?"
Draco slumped down into a sitting position on the bed. Massaging his temples, he huffed out a melodramatic sigh before responding.
Breakfast in the hotel dining room was a cacophony of noise and excitement. Puddlemere team spirit was buoyant, and everyone was keen to strike Montrose a brutal blow while they were still riding high on the Szymon Lewandowski wave. Draco picked at his unappealing toast and wondered how the world could keep on turning so relentlessly.
The next thing on Draco’s morning agenda was to Firecall Greg. “So,” Draco said, trying to kneel, and to place his head into the flames whilst at the same time negotiating the new reality of his bump, “you remember I was supposed to Firecall you before I did anything too rash? It might be a little bit late for that,” he said. “I kissed Harry,” he said, enjoying being the bearer of gossip, “and then, he just so happened to kiss me back.”
He stood, and pushed open the bathroom door, all of a sudden desperate for space. The walls were closing in on him, and Draco collided with Greg as he fell into the bedroom. Goyle was quick off the mark though. The Beater grabbed hold of Draco’s shoulders, and steadied him. He led Draco across to his bed and sat him down on it.
“You alright?” Greg asked, looking over at Draco. He’d vanished the Bubble-Head Charm. and his freckled face was filled with genuine concern. Draco felt all his vexation with the big oaf melt away, just like it always did.
"Yes, fine," Malfoy says, folding the sheet a little compulsively now. "Are you saying it's not good enough, apologizing because you wanted me to?"
He’s tempted to reply, to explain that it isn’t that simple, but he realises there’s no point. This Other Harry
but felt too nervous to actually read any of the articles. He was nervous, far more than he’d expected to be. Wizard pregnancies were notorious for being more problematic than those of witches and there were a dozen things that could go wrong.
Harry feels angry now, thinking of the eight feet of parchment he could fill with all the vile shite Malfoy's done since they were eleven. He doesn't know what to do with all this anger.
The only shared history Harry and Malfoy have that might be appropriate breakfast conversation is Malfoy's mother, but Harry heard Narcissa left for the Continent as soon as her house arrest had ended six months ago and Harry doesn't think,
“Mr Malfoy?” she said, giving his hand a firm shake. “I’m Mediwitch Gwyneth Hayes and it’s a pleasure to meet you.”
"Yeah but—" Harry gets interrupted by Dean and doesn't get a chance to say it's not weird that Malfoy's good at it, Malfoy would probably be annoyingly good at anything, it's that cooking—feeding people—is nice. Bringing cupcakes to a party is nice. Giving Harry porridge every morning is nice. And it's the niceness that's sitting wrong underneath Harry's skin, making him go to the kitchen to look for Malfoy, to say what he doesn't know.
Dinner was takeaway out from the local Chinese restaurant. Draco was pleasantly surprised to discover that his appetite, hidden deep in the doldrums for the last few weeks, suddenly re-emerged when Millie served him up a big plate of sweet and sour vegetables and spring rolls.
When they finish their morning cups Malfoy insists they get dressed and go shopping for pajamas, candles, vases, and flowers, in that order. Harry wonders if Malfoy will ever come over and not think of ten more things to buy.
They are now taller than Draco and wear long robes, full of patches of frizzled and flayed fabric. The collar of their robes are double lined with fur and Draco reaches out and runs his fingers through it.
He leans up and Draco watches him, eyes dark and pupils blown wide. He puts his hand over Draco’s cock, feeling his hardness through the thin material of his pants.
To his left he sees a pursuit vehicle ride up next to him and tries to drive him off course but the Rig sustains the push. He reaches for the shotgun he keeps to his right. In that moment he also notices that there is someone chained to the lancer’s perch at the front.
He’s left alone on the balcony with Potter. And he should feel nervous but there’s also a part of him that feels very selfish and very full of hope. He comes to stand next to Draco and lets out a sigh. Draco notices that the top collar of his shirt has come undone and his skin glistens with sweat. He’s staring again and Potter knows it because he’s watching Draco, too.
They’ve finished setting the plates back on the hood when they hear it: a howl that cuts through the night, foul and sharp. Draco’s body goes cold and his hands freeze.
After the war, there was chaos trying to round up the last remaining Death Eaters who fled to the south and east. It wasn’t easy. Pansy mentioned that the Auror numbers dwindled during the raids. Potter had lost a partner. And eventually, Potter had been removed from the active field and promoted to Head of the Aurors which... did not come without its cost. Office life wasn’t for everyone most especially for him. Not for Potter who had spent most of his life right in the middle of it.
After the war, Draco couldn’t stomach living at the Manor, despite his mother’s insistence. He could no longer bear the ghosts and pain that lingered within the halls. The great dining hall and cellar were the worst, and he couldn’t walk into them without having a fit of sorts, feeling his chest tightening. It had endured so much death and suffering that no amount of remodeling was going to change that. Things weren’t the same and the Manor no longer felt like home to Draco. And his mother couldn’t blame him, after everything they’ve been through. His father is still in Azkaban and his mother tends to the Manor hopeful that one day her family will return home.
He keeps his hands to himself while Draco fingers himself open. He loves the way Draco sighs at the first touch, brows knitting and mouth falling open in a silent moan when he finds that sweet spot. Sweat beads down his chest and Harry licks his lips.
Hermione drops the knife and Draco feels the whiplash of emotions and memories flood back to him of better days when they were younger. She looks older, of course she would, they are no longer children. The red markings around her eyes and cheekbones feel familiar and Draco thinks, tries to remember what they mean. Leader of Vuvalini, Guardian of the Many Mothers. There are hard lines around her eyes and her hair is wild, barely held together by a tie and loose braids, peppered with dust as it blows in the wind.
Hours later, after the reception dies down, in the early hours of the next day, Draco finds an empty balcony and goes outside for a breather. He’s sweating and tipsy from all the drinking and dancing. He tugs at his collar, not caring that he’s popped off a button. He leans against the stone railing, tilting his head back, and enjoys the light breeze.
“He wants us to go back from where we came,” Pansy says. She eyes Potter, curiously. “I thought you weren’t insane anymore?”
Just then, Baz rounds the corner with the rest of his cronies and Draco lets go. They grab the blood bag and the last thing Draco sees is the look he gives Draco—something akin to amusement. He doesn’t realize until much later that his knife is missing from its sheath.
Blaise moves about opening the wine bottle while Draco leans against the counter and looks at the spread across the kitchen island. Just about every possible hors d'oeuvre and pastry sits perfectly in trays and tier stands.
Blaise looks older too, their eyes sharp and watching Draco with familiarity. He pulls away from Hermione and walks towards Blaise, reaches forward and cards his fingers through theirs. When he blinks, he feels tears fall down his cheek. “I never thought I’d see any of you again. But I had hoped.”
“Well, there is the issue in that I wasn’t expecting him so I certainly don’t have a Christmas present for him,” he finds himself admitting. And it’s true. He hasn’t the faintest idea of what to do. He doesn’t even know if he should be thinking if Potter has gotten anything for him either.
His knees burn, the hot sand bleeding through his pants, but it’s all that keeps him grounded as he cries and
“I’m sorry,” Pansy says the following morning. She climbs on the motorcycle behind Draco and leans her head against his back and wraps her arms around his waist. “I really thought he would come with us.”
Draco lifts his arm from over his eyes and blinks, eyes adjusting. He sees Potter standing next to him, blocking the sun. He’s looking down at Draco with a calm expression.
Potter looks at him and nods, lifting his hand again. Draco works in silence, tying one half of the scarf around his hand, tight and delicate. He knows Potter is watching him, can feel his gaze but he continues his work without saying anything. Countless times he’s done the same, tending to injuries of his own, quietly and with deft fingers. Only after Draco’s done does he let himself meet Potter’s eyes. He lets his hand fall. There’s dirt and smudges of oil on Potter’s cheek and he wants to reach up and brush it away but he doesn’t. And just like that Potter is stepping away from Draco with a quiet thanks. Draco clutches the other half of the scarf.
Ron was up on his feet in moments, kissing his girlfriend and taking her coat, and Draco felt his happy mood drop a little. True, the Weasleys had been the epitome of kindness, but he’d been truly foul to Hermione Granger in the past. He was surprised when the witch didn’t go and sit with her partner. Instead, she marched over to where Harry and he were sitting.
Arthur was kind though. “Nothing to be sorry for,” he said, “there’s many things in life that deserve an apology, but in my experience, falling in love never requires a wizard to ask for forgiveness. You’re right. Harry won’t let you down. I’ve known him since he was a schoolboy, and there’s nobody alive that cares more for his loved ones than he does. He loves you too, but you need to bear with him. Never had a family of his own, and then the war came along. Not only dying to save the world, but then having to live the whole rest of your life as the Chosen One. It was the biggest of burdens, but I do think that Harry was getting there. Slowly, but surely." Arthur found Draco's eyes. "Harry was forging his own life, making an existence for himself, and then what happened?”
Goyle didn’t answer, but he did as Draco asked of him. The Wizard’s Choice brand wasn’t much different to the first pregnancy test, and the result wasn’t any different either. This time the potion turns a pinky purple, which indicated that he was about six weeks in. Quite honestly, the result couldn’t have been clearer, had
Harry finally arrived at ten minutes past, and he stepped into the café, his face broken wide into a smile and his arms wide in greeting.
Draco rolled up the message, gave Elianna a couple of treats and attached the treat to her leg. Then, without further ado, he opened the window. The owl flew out in feathery haste and Draco watched until she was nothing but a tiny dot on the horizon.
It’s hard to stop watching. Harry has fully claimed the armchair in the corner, he has claimed the reading nook by the window in the living room, he has claimed the corner by the cat bowl in the kitchen. These are the places where he sits and watches them. It’s where he watches them in the morning. It’s where he gets acquainted with the ways Other Harry and Draco interact.
Malfoy bends down and scoops up the shaggy mess of fur and coos—actually coos—"Silence, wretched creature," while Harry watches agog, realizing his jaw has dropped.
, without sounding like he's trying to pick a fight. Though Harry can admit to himself that maybe he is trying to pick a fight. It's patently unbelievable that Malfoy would make rock cakes for Hagrid purely out of the goodness of his heart.
Draco thought that he probably shouldn’t. Eating in a restaurant with Harry felt entirely too date-like, and he knew it probably wasn’t the best idea to be indulging in such behaviour. That being said, Draco knew he had to get over his Harry-pash, and get accustomed to the other man’s touches, kisses, and smiles. Platonic co-parenting would end up a big, terrific mess otherwise.
Mother would have noticed that he wasn’t drinking – she missed nothing – but she didn’t comment. Mother was complementary about Puddlemere’s final few performances, “although that infamous Louis St Clare doesn’t do your team any kindness with his notorious behaviours,” and congratulated him on the team’s position in the League. “Though I firmly believe you’d have finished far higher if you hadn’t been laid low for those final two games, Draco. A tragedy, really.”
His mind whirled, but then Draco remembered Greg’s words. Poor little orphan Harry, finally getting a family. Draco remembered the morning after they’d slept together, slept together in this very bed, and how Harry had called him a mistake. How Harry had said he wasn’t ready for them, for this.
Hermione's eyes light up. "That is exactly the kind of blood purity nepotist shite that makes me want to train flocks of birds to peck nonstop at its participants, but if you're telling me you'd swing the votes for me then I'd say I'm game."
Harry smiled at that, a gorgeous, knowing smirk that made Draco’s tummy twist and a warm, honied feeling radiate through his limbs.
He has no idea what else he'll do but right now he only feels a profound sense of relief. Harry clears out his desk of the few possessions he kept at work, an old quill he really likes, an extra pair of trainers, and a few bags of crisps tucked away. Ron's not at their work station, probably off interviewing people on Diagon, so Harry just… leaves.
Harry gives up then. Malfoy can wear his bloody sweatpants with a top hat for all Harry cares. He was just surprised, that's all. Surprised and a little annoyed at how good Malfoy looks in them.
Should he wake Harry by going down on him? For a second, Draco through that’d be sexy, and he had half-crawled under the quilt before he changed his mind. Draco liked a hot shower after sex, and possibly Harry felt the same.
In the end, Draco chose a soft grey cotton shirt that skimmed lightly over his middle, and a pair of his new pregnancy trousers. He examined himself in the mirror and frowned at the reflection. His bottom was definitely a bit softer and rounder than it’d been pre-pregnancy, and his hips looked like they’d spread a little. Perhaps, in the cold light of day, Harry would regret their kiss, but Draco could only hope that wasn’t the case.
It's a pale blue quilt with slowly shifting patterns of narcissus flowers, the stitches move serenely, as if in a soft breeze, outlining daffodils that shift and reform. It's mesmerizing watching the stitches slowly create new shapes across the fabric. Harry loves it.
the word, Harry. Bloody hell.” Draco felt his cheeks flame, and he put the bag down on the coffee table, and wished, fervently, that the floor would swallow him up. “What is this?” he asked, gesturing to the shopping. “This, and the energy tonic, and being here… Wanting to be involved. What are you doing?”
Malfoy is currently finessing some skin off the snapper fillets, working quite gingerly with a knife so Harry doesn't send a Stinging Hex at him.
Instantly, Draco felt his happy mood vanish. What was written in it must surely be incendiary, and no doubt Harry must be trying to warn him. His mind flew to every awful scenario. Had they got hold of pictures of his father in Azkaban? Stolen his medical records from St Mungo’s? Draco felt sick. Perhaps they’d gone to the Manor and shouted abuse at his mum. He wouldn’t put anything past those tabloid vultures. Draco settled Elianna on the owl perch with a treat, and then made his way back to the settee, heart in his mouth, and unrolled the paper on his coffee table.
“You don’t understand,” Draco repeated, though he wasn’t sure what he was trying to say. “My trousers don’t fit! I’m
Greg’s jaw dropped, utterly endearingly. “What do you mean?” he asked, clearly scandalised by Draco’s news. “How did this momentous event come to pass?” His eyes narrowed. “And when you say
She took measurements and Draco’s weight, and pronounced herself happy with everything that she saw. “As far as I’m concerned, you’re having a textbook pregnancy,” Hayes told Draco, smiling. “And how are your energy levels? Did you find the Energy Extension Elixir helped with those?”
in his larder, and Draco had taken one out. He’d placed it on his palm, struck at its presence and the small space it took up in the world.
Greg was silent for a minute. He fiddled with the label of his bottle, tearing off little strips before he cleared his throat. “I read the
“Says to get on your side,” Harry answered. He reached over and grabbed a spare pillow from beside Draco’s head. “Stick this under your belly.” Draco did so, moving the pillow around until he felt comfortable. He glanced back at Harry, feeling shy, but Harry kissed a line up Draco’s back, across his shoulders and over his jaw and, it wasn’t long before the desire of his lover made him forget his self-consciousness. Draco jumped once again when he felt Harry’s hand between his legs, lining himself and getting himself in position to push inside.
Harry shrugs. "I don't know. It's hard choosing all new stuff. You wouldn't understand, you inherited all your stuff."
"I think Malfoy wants you to stay for tea," Harry says, realizing the rock cakes are for Hagrid. Malfoy asked Luna what Hagrid would like for tea. Malfoy made Hagrid rock cakes.
"How come I know you're not stupid? That's an excellent question. I'm not sure there's a satisfactory answer."
Mentally, Draco shook the thoughts from his head. This was old news, and nothing he hadn’t already accepted. Harry and he were making it work, and both were being terribly adult about it. He must have been pulling a curious face, because Mediwitch Hayes looked at him with apparent concern. “So, just to clarify, that means I’ve no concerns whatsoever about later complications with their magic, as can be the case in a small number of wizard-wizard births. Please don't fret. There really isn’t anything to worry about.”
There was Pansy and Theo, with baby Cygnus at his Naming Celebration. There was Marcus and Greg, grinning wildly, taken when they’d swiped the Quidditch Cup two years before. There was even a very old photograph of Mother and Father, taken in front of the Manor, just before he’d been taken to ride the Hogwarts Express for the very first time.
alright. He didn't need Harry. Draco had money in his vault, he had family and friends who would help him, and most importantly, he was enough. He would love their baby enough for the two of them.
Ron gleefully takes a huge bite of the slice the moment Harry shakes his head no. Harry summons a couple butterbeers and they sit back with full bellies talking about Quidditch for the rest of the night. Harry doesn't have an answer to the Malfoy question but he does know he loves his best friend.
"I get the impression you ask out of a sense of misplaced and slightly begrudging obligation. Do you like helping?"
“Merlin, no,” Draco cut in, wanting to cut Pansy off from that line of thought. “I wouldn’t touch McLaggen again with a ten-foot broomstick,” he said, wishing that his best-mate thought he had better self-esteem than to go chasing his foul, egotistical ex. Draco wanted Pansy to take him seriously. “The baby is Harry’s,” he said. “Harry Potter is the other parent, Parks. My baby is going to be a little Chosen One, Pans. A baby Saviour.”
Harry linked their fingers together on his hip, and Draco squeezed hard on to them, hard enough to hurt, but Harry was relentless. Fuck, but it was wonderful. Draco was sweaty all over, and he could hardly breath with the intensity of Harry’s unyielding rhythm. He bit his lip, not wanting to cry out, but Harry caught onto what he was doing.
Harry gave the babygro an appraising glance, and then placed it down on top of the rest of his purchases.
Draco examined their encounters, one by one. They’d also been spending time together – shopping, evenings reading, watching the Muggle television and talking – but that surely was all for the benefit of their baby? It meant they’d know his voice and respond well to Harry’s magic. It was like Hayes had said: whatever you’re doing, it certainly seems to be suiting the pair of you. Surely, even coming here, enjoying a lazy Sunday with the Weasleys, was all about building up positive relationships for after they became parents?
Anxiety jumped through Draco’s body as he stepped into the hearth, and he felt peculiar, like everything was happening in slow motion.
“Oh, but they don’t know that. I got sent home yesterday,” Other Harry grins, “I could be terribly unwell.”
"Well, neither do I. My parents weren't exactly the perfect loving couple. I probably don't need to tell you my father is not a kind man."
At first, he’d thought it was the bed. The hotels that the higher-ups at Puddlemere chose for them were completely inexcusable, and this bed was the foulest of all. The mattress was lumpy and the sheets were thin. Maybe it was the sound of Goyle snoring beside him. Draco half-wondered whether to cast a Muffling Charm, but then decided not to bother. The prat would only be pissed off if it woke him up.
at us!... Fuck! I bet he follows Puddlemere. Bloody, bloody hell! He’s going to complain about the season.” Draco took a small step towards the exit. “And then he’s going to tell the
“Can you do the spells?” Draco asks then, and Harry wonders exactly what it means until the distinct scent of a cleaning spell hits his nostrils.
"Paté sucré," Malfoy corrects. "Only I'm not making her crust recipe because it was too thin last time. I like more bite."
But by Saturday morning, something from the trip is still niggling at Harry, like a raspberry seed stuck in a back tooth and no matter how Harry presses he can't dislodge it.
Louis St Clare would get his spot on the Puddlemere First Team; there wasn’t even a single Sickle of doubt about that.
When they pulled apart they both smirked at the look of lust on Harry’s face. During their talk earlier they had agrees to give the threesome a try after all, Draco and Tom used to get along before Harry and their love for Harry was the thing pulling them together.
Tom nodded "Yes your werewolf friend will benefit, I believe it's the main reason she is so passionate about this particular law, and she’s seen the damage first hand"
"I thought perhaps, living with muggles growing up, that you had likely never been to a magical zoo and that you might like the chance to see one. Was I mistaken?” Tom asked as he paid the attendant for their entrance.
Tom kept close to Harry for the rest of the night, he helped him study and when Harry announced he was going to bed, Tom followed stating he wanted to talk to the raven haired teen alone. The others made kissing faces as the two left causing Harry to give them the finger and the dark lord to smirk. He wouldn’t mind a kiss from Harry.
Harry chuckled before leading Tom to his favourite shop in Hogsmeade; he planned on getting all of his favourites.
Harry looked at Hermione as if she was Insane” Hermione this is the man who killed my parents!" Hermione shook her head eyes watering
Draco scoffed "why because I'm not Harry and you’re not trying to get into my pants? well guess what I'm loyal to Harry and Harry alone." Draco looked shocked at himself as he said the last past as if only just realising that it was true.
Harry then hugged his best friend with a laugh “I’m here if you need me Drake" Draco leaned into the hug “I’m fine, just didn't get much sleep.”
Harry sat on his bed as Tom shut the door behind him. Harry looked around the room with a smile as he realised that soon Draco would be back in this room and he wouldn’t be alone any more. Tom seemed to realise Harry’s train of thought and scowled. He pulled Harry’s chin to look up at him when he got closer.
Voldemort rolled his eyes. “Well as pleasurable as being your lord would be, since you decline, Voldemort or if you must Tom will be fine, but twist my name into some horrible nickname and I will reach down your throat and rip out your lungs.”
Harry woke and he felt much better, he thought he could run a marathon if he was a faster runner. Hermione came to visit, when she was satisfied that he was well enough she gave Harry the tour of the manor. It was huge! There were over a thousand rooms, there were bedrooms, studies, libraries, some were empty some had random things placed inside them. Harry was mesmerised he had never been in a house this big before. Outside he had a Quidditch pitch, lake and a stables. The land could fit three of manors inside and still have plenty room for everything else. Harry wandered where Tom got all the money to afford this place but then he thought about how Tom was the dark lord and could do anything he wanted.
Harry wished he had never left his dorm that next morning. He had woken Happy in Tom’s arms they had shared a quick kiss before getting ready for their classes. However their friends had noticed Tom leaving Harry’s dorm in the clothes from the night before.
"They call me the brightest witch of my age for a reason Harry... So what happened?" She wiggled her eyebrows at him.
Harry looked at his watch, Snape should still be in his office, it wasn't too long after curfew that the man would have gone to bed, but Harry did not know the man's habits and he hasn't brought the map, so he had to hope the man would still be in his office.
"How can I believe you, you have done nothing but try and kill me since I was nothing but a baby? How do I know you speak the truth and not trying just trying to get me to lower my guard?" He didn’t snark, or have any venom behind his words, he was merely being cautious not really believing the words he had just heard.
None of them would stop their teasing, not even when Tom death glared them. When Hermione and Neville had joined them for breakfast Pansy had blurted out that Tom and Harry had sex the night before.
"No one is born evil Professor, I dont want any more death, I can't - no one should feel this loss.."
Harry shook his head at the Tom Riddle looking Voldemort. "It's just your appearance came as a shock, you’re not a snake mutant anymore"
“You mean all three of us?” Harry question as the other two smirking at each other as they leaned forward and snogged each other leaning over Harry so they were in clear view. Harry’s eyes widened as he watched the two make out. He shared the same thoughts as Tom earlier, it was hot.
Harry leaned into Draco once he finished eating pushing the rest of his pancakes away; his head rested on the others shoulder, none of the others seemed fazed by this action, as Harry and Draco had done this kind of thing all the time. “I think I ate too much.” He had said with a groan. That was Tom’s cue to lean over and wipe Harry’s lips with his thumb, removing left over maple syrup from the, before placing the finger into his mouth with a hum. He gave Harry a smirk. “Sorry, Couldn’t help myself.”
Harry frowned at her. “I’m as good as! I’m only looking out for you, I hate seeing you get so hurt again and again.”
