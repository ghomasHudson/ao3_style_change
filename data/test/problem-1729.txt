“And I’m sure none of us will be able to sleep until we know what’s going on. You took quite a turn, Harry. I’m not sure you realise…” He looked at Sirius and imagined the same look on his father’s face. Sirius was the closest thing he had to a father, apart perhaps, from Arthur Weasley, and Harry probably owed him the truth.
‘That’s all I ask, Draco. I’m not here to make you do anything you don’t want to. I just want you to be happy. We all do.’ What was that supposed to mean? Were they talking about him behind his back? He hoped he wasn’t becoming paranoid on top of everything else.
Looked like he’d be getting arrested anyway.
‘Draco, you’ve just woken up from a near-death experience, which, by the way, no one is quite sure how you survived, and you want to talk about my girlfriend? Draco, I don’t have a girlfriend, I’ve never had a girlfriend. I haven’t had a girlfriend since Ginny.’ That was laughable, but now wasn’t the time for laughing.
‘I see. Well, have you thought about how it might affect Harry? If he cares about you half as much as you care about him, can you imagine how you would feel if the shoe was on the other foot?’ Draco sat very still as he thought about that. He noticed that Smith had filled well over a page of the notebook and was ready to turn over yet again. What was so interesting about this?
“No, you’re not. There’s dittany in the bathroom, go and clean yourself up. I’ll deal with Aspen.” She hesitated, her gaze flicking to the fox still dangling in the air.
‘Harry, please. That’s not important right now.’ Draco said. He suddenly felt very tired, as if the adrenaline from his panic attack had left his body all at once.
They could handle another child though, couldn’t they? He really thought their trip to the chateau was a real turning point for them. He could tell Harry about how he felt, and he knew that Harry had told him about some of the things he’d been dealing with too. They were strong, they’d already been through so much together, if they could use that strength to bring joy to a little girl who deserved the world…surely that could only be a good thing?
That night he didn’t sleep well at all. He woke up every hour with nightmares of his last night with Harry and the look on Teddy’s face when he told him he was moving away. Thankfully the night before he’d had time to brew a fresh batch of potions and they helped somewhat. Draco went to the Ministry with tired eyes and a buzzing in his ears from lack of sleep. He was hardly keeping his eyes open as he made his way up to Kingsley’s office. He’d only been there once before just after his trial when Kingsley promised he would be exonerated.
But he pushed these thoughts to one side as he focused on preparing for the long day ahead. First chance he got, he went down to the potion lab and grabbed a handful of Pepperups to put in pocket-sized vials for later. Pepperup was one of the few potions he could brew easily as none of the ingredients were restricted.
‘He hasn’t left your side the whole time you’ve been in. Slept in the chair and everything. The first week, I tried to send him home every night. By the second I realised that wasn’t going to happen.’ Draco looked to the other side, remembering the feeling against his hand.
“Tell me it’s real.” He could mean a dozen things by that, but he didn’t know exactly what he was asking.
Thankfully Spungen had had the foresight to supply a spare pair of Draco’s reading glasses since he hadn’t thought the bring any with him.
‘Why did you ask us here Hermione?’ She positively lit up with excitement at the prospect of being able to talk about something Draco presumed she had been researching.
‘I’m sorry. Things have been manic lately, between Draco and the orphanage and Teddy there’s hardly been a minute’s peace. Isn’t that right Rose?’ He cooed at the toddler and Draco tried not to think about what the sight did to him. He looked down at Hugo who was dropping in and out of sleep in his arms. He couldn’t believe how much he’d grown in just a few weeks.
He saw Malfoy sitting cross-legged in the middle of the room, looking right out into the garden as if there was a beautiful meadow view even though the brightness and warmth came from within the house. The first thing he noticed was that she had let her hair out again, like she had at the pub, and strands were blowing around her face in the breeze. He realised then that she had used a contained weather charm – a type of portable weather system which could be activated for a short period of time.
‘I spoke to my mind healer today. I’ve booked an international portkey to the chateau and we’re going to go away and we’re going to talk about it all. Everything. No holds barred.’ Harry snorted and Draco couldn’t help but whack him right between the ribs.
‘I’ll try it I suppose.’ He glanced up at her and was unsurprised to find her grinning at him.
Eventually, Harry’s knees become stiff. On a routine op last year, he’d been hit by a poorly aimed jinx which dislocated his right kneecap and it had never been the same since. Since he was neither use nor ornament to the research, he gets up and does a lap of the room, or a turn about the room as they would have said in the olden days. The kind of days when this room would have been considered modern.
‘You say that like it isn’t a long time.’ Draco didn’t want to think about what it meant that Harry had crossed the channel to explain himself to Draco. Instead he focused on the practical details.
‘See, now we can’t even have a normal conversation without disagreeing. What happened?’
The new line of work was much more playing on his knowledge of the dark arts. He was tracking magical signatures of any known Death Eater associates or sympathises. Analysing reports for any kinds of dark magic too advanced for the auror training. His father had often taken him into the basement of the manor to show him some of the dark artefacts the family owned or had collected. When he was older, his father had begun to tell him what some of the artefacts did and what Draco should do with them should the manor be raided, or should the family be threatened.
‘Why are you asking so many questions? He’s here because you just came back from school and we both missed you and wanted to see you.’ Draco mentally thanked Harry for not spilling the beans like he often did. He was always soft on the kid – not that Draco could blame him.
“Nuclear,” Harry corrected automatically, and winced when he realised how much he sounded like Hermione.
Harry was still woken up regularly at five in the morning by Aspen pouncing on top of him, trying to dig through the duvet and screaming with what Harry presumed was excitement.
‘You remember when I told you about my Aunt Bella casting the Cruciatus Curse on me during the war?’ Harry nodded.
‘Dad, would you go flying with me? I’ve been watching a lot of house quidditch and I think I’d like to get better at flying.’ Harry’s face lit up like Christmas had come again. Draco had always admired how much he loved quidditch, although he didn’t get to fly nearly as much as he used to.
Draco’s mouth fell open. “So you lied?! What the fuck, Granger. How am I the one trying to keep this as legal as possible? You could have told me! That’s going to look suspicious as fuck! Potter’s wand just
She leapt up from the table, sending cutlery flying everywhere. “YOU CAN’T ARREST HIM! HE HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT! Is this because he was a Death Eater? Because it’s
“What? No! Don’t put words into my mouth. I wouldn’t be here unless I really needed to be!” Harry winces when his words came out very differently than he intended. Malfoy looks furious. There’s a vein throbbing down the side of his neck which is flushed bright red. His eyes however are glacial as he stares Harry down.
‘Of course, Draco. I designed the contract to make it as flexible for you as possible. The immediate danger appears to have passed and I don’t intend to force you to be here if it will damage your health. All I ask is that you remain until the end of the week while I make some arrangements, can you do that?’ Draco hadn’t felt so much relief in a long time.
Having OCD is the bane of his existence. That, and having a boyfriend who can’t read more than three pages before getting fidgety and going to play quidditch.
He started gnashing his teeth at her the same way he had at Harry earlier. This time however, Harry could also see the tremble in his legs – his fox was afraid.
him. How dare he presume that there was anything he could advise Harry about. How dare he pretend like he hadn’t made one disastrous choice after another. How dare he tell Harry he shouldn’t pursue happiness when he had the one thing Harry had always wanted but had never had.
“Honestly. It was bad enough when your pathetic arse couldn’t just be fucking nice to him in the first place, but then you had to go and-” Pansy waved a sugar-speckled teaspoon around in her hand as she gesticulated, but Draco wasn’t really listening. His mind had wandered back to the pages of his father’s old books. He had quickly discovered that becoming an animagus was a lot more complex than he thought and required a specialist potion as well as a physical transformation. He had made it through a month of holding a mandrake leaf in his mouth even though it made him wretch each time it was disturbed from its position under his tongue – the resulting weight loss from his lack of appetite still hadn’t quite recovered – however he wasn’t making much progress beyond that.
‘Why not? He’s mine remember? You chose your side a long time ago. I’m only making amends.’ Smith was staring right at him, but his eyes were unseeing. It was creepy, and the hairs on the back of Draco’s neck stood on end. He tried to push past Smith, but he wasn’t strong enough. Hermione’s voice continued to rattle around in his skull.
“Where am I?” Draco’s voice was gravelly and low but at least he had a voice, which meant he was back in his human form, and suggest that the thing which had hit him in the back was most likely an un-transfiguring spell. As far as he could tell, his back had suffered no lasting damage, but the cold that had been brewing when he’d left the Manor had gone full throttle in the time he had been out. He had barely had time to register that he had finally achieved his transformation and now he didn’t feel much like celebrating. He was cold, he felt ill, and there was a general air of misery around him.
‘Well, you were always rolling over and taking the hits. And no, I don’t just mean with the healer training.’ Harry held up a hand to stop Draco as he opened his mouth to interrupt. ‘I just wanted you to have some faith in us. Stand up and show people they were wrong about you. I could’ve easily gone charging in and shot them all down, but I knew how much it meant to you that you worked hard and earned it. I wanted you to trust that I’d support you no matter what happened, and you didn’t have to be scared to just be you. I don’t know how that turned out so badly, but I only ever meant well.’
Harry passed Ron’s bedroom on the way to his own room. The door to Ron’s bedroom was still firmly shut; a sign Ron was still sleeping since he was incapable of closing a door behind him when he was awake.
Draco knows he has to finish his book organisation before he can let Harry show him the muggle stuff, so he quickly moves through the end of the alphabet. He even allows Harry to help him put the books back on the shelves, although he has to go back over and straighten them up afterwards.
‘Oh.’ He felt incredibly cold all of a sudden. ‘I see.’ Hermione patted his arm with sympathy before sitting down on one of the sofas and pulling her legs up underneath her. Draco would’ve winced at the creases she’d put in her dress, but he was a little preoccupied.
‘What about it?’ He pressed. She sighed and turned back towards him.
So, instead of getting on with what he came here to speak to her about, he chose another path.
‘You haven’t seen anything yet.’ Draco took the large key from the hook concealed in the hedgerow. He wasn’t too worried about hiding it since the whole property was so heavily warded. The key clunked in the lock and the door creaked horribly as it opened, but Draco thought it only added to the charm. He motioned for Harry to step inside before him and he couldn’t bite back the smile at Harry’s gasp. He followed him inside and let the door click shut behind them.
‘We’re going out, Teddy’s going to stay with Ron and Hermione for the night. No more questions, go.’ Harry left him standing there bewildered as he spoke to Teddy about going to his aunt and uncles. Draco was slightly concerned, Harry had spent so much time working recently, getting everything up and running, that he hadn’t spent much time with Teddy in the week he’d been back. Christmas was just days away, and Teddy wouldn’t be home for long. Still, he was intrigued. He and Harry hadn’t been many places at all, being worried a headline would appear somewhere and kick up yet more fuss they didn’t want.
“Potter, you’ve lost your mind! You can’t break into the Department of Mysteries! You’re the most recognisable face in the country, if not the world. More to the point, it’s
‘I suppose I will.’ He said feeling a little dazed.
All in all, it wasn’t the perfect send-off Draco had hoped for, but it was a fair amount better than he expected and as Teddy’s smiling little face disappeared into the distance, Draco held onto Harry with every fibre of his being.
‘Sorry, Draco. I really have to shoot.’ She said when Draco wandered in, still in his pyjamas.
‘Pansy!’ He said, raising his eyebrows, ‘what on earth are you doing here? More to the point, how did you get in? This is off limits to the general public.’ Pansy rolled her eyes and kissed him on both cheeks. He hoped that was witch’s lipstick and he wouldn’t have bright red-stained lip marks on his cheeks.
‘Why can’t we just get along, Draco?’ Harry asked him tiredly, rubbing his eyes beneath his glasses.
‘We should go up to bed, we can’t sleep here.’ Draco hadn’t even thought about what time it was, but he suddenly felt like lead.
“How do you know?”
When things were going right, Draco was quite competent and confident. It was only when things went badly…
‘Do you mind not disrupting my work for no good reason, Potter.’ Draco snapped. He was in a foul mood. He’d been over the moon yesterday when he’d officially signed a lease for an apartment just south of Paris starting in November. However, that excitement was short lived when he realised that on Thursday his little wolf would be going to Hogwarts for the first time. Draco finally understood why his own mother had wept for days before Draco’s first year. He felt like a little piece of his heart was leaving with Teddy.
‘Neither of us are perfect, Draco. You don’t need to put so much pressure on yourself. And really,’ Harry pulled away from him and surveyed the flat, ‘why do you still have this place?’
‘It was bound to happen eventually,’ Harry’s laughter died out and his face took on a serious impression. Draco waited for the inevitable.
“What rights?” The man said. “You think you have rights now?” He stepped backwards and two guards slammed the cell door closed behind him. At that moment, the bonds tying Draco’s hands released, but he didn’t move. He stayed where he had been dumped on the ground and stared at the man on the other side of the bars whose face was now half in shadow. Draco could feel his pulse thumping in his head, and his wrists stung where the invisible bindings had held them, but he was defiant.
‘Hm, ok.’ Harry didn’t sound convinced but didn’t push him. The pressure on his spine stopped and he was about to whine in protest until Harry wrapped his arms around him fully. ‘Go back to sleep Draco,’ he mumbled in his ear. Draco had no idea what time it was but that sounded like a good idea.
“No, it’s not like that. I’m fine.”
the dead? Because one would establish a moving connection with the other side and the other would effectively have us fishing for corpses.” The word had been niggling away at him, but he’d only just figured out why. The colour drained from Granger’s face and she pursed her lips in thought. She turned back to the watermarked pages and scanned them again.
‘Draco.’ His father repeated in the same flat tone.
‘WHY DOES EVERYTHING ALWAYS HAVE YOU BE ABOUT YOU?’ Harry roared. ‘Do you have any idea how hard these past months have been? Do you? I have to be at every meeting. I make every final decision. Every aspect of those children’s lives is my responsibility. I’m having to learn everything as I go whilst being worried sick about you because you’re not even trying to get better! Do you know how that feels? To be responsible for everything all the time? When does anyone ever do anything for me, huh? THIS IS HARD FOR ME TOO!’
‘You’ll feel like that for a while.’ Draco peeled his eyes open slowly to see a young healer standing next to his bed with a clipboard in her hands.
He went back downstairs in search of Harry. He found him in one of the offices with Helen and one of the admin staff he’d never bothered to learn the name of.
Teddy was coming home.
people. Especially since the rules, such as GETTING A WARRANT, don’t apply to you!’ Draco had never been so angry in his life. He’d spent an entire weekend not eating or sleeping or showering because he’d had an attack and didn’t have the right amount of potion. Yes, his new batch was ready a day later but by then he’d relapsed.
Draco pulled back first, and Harry sunk further into the bed, feeling boneless and completely relaxed.
‘What do I do?’ He couldn’t think of a spell to cast now that he was faced with such possibilities.
There was a rather bright flash of light and the fox jumped high off the table, the screeching starting afresh. Harry cursed under his breath.
’ Teddy read aloud. ‘But I’m terrible at riddles! That’s what Ravenclaws are good at!’
‘Draco, it’s February.’ He felt it like a stab to the chest.
‘You’re ok with it?’
‘He did?’ Draco couldn’t image why Harry would do that. Draco had barely scratched the surface with this case. In fact, he was waiting for Kingsley himself to come down and tell him to get his shit together. Maybe not quite in those words.
‘I don’t think so. I think you care.’
‘Of course she’d understand. She loved you very much.’ Draco jumped and twisted around to see Harry standing behind him, his hands shoved deep into his pockets and the collar of his charcoal coat turned up to protect him against the chill of the wind. His wand was sticking out of his lapel and casting a little light into the darkness. Even in the small glow it gave off he looked beautiful, if a little tired. ‘You didn’t come home to me.’ He said when Draco chose not to reply.
‘You’re such a pain in the arse,’ Draco told him.
‘Draco!’ She half-yelled when she looked up from the pages and saw that he was awake. ‘You absolute shit! I thought you were going to die!’ He didn’t quite know what to say when her eyes starting filling with tears. He felt awful for upsetting her. He tried to tell her so, but he was suddenly aware of how dry his mouth and throat were.
Draco was making a concerted effort to pay more attention to how his troubles impacted Harry. He was careful to always tell him when he was having a hard time, even if he knew that he wouldn’t be able to do anything to help. Harry still struggled to understand that sometimes he hadn’t done anything wrong and there was no reason for Draco to cry or freak out, but for the most part he did his best to make Draco feel more comfortable.
‘How did you get Daddy here? He hates the house now.’ He’d called him Daddy again – Harry had been telling the truth all those months ago. Draco felt like a bit of a fool. Teddy reached up for some glasses while Harry set the plates down on the table.
‘I didn’t want to lie to him. He would’ve found out eventually. I’ve had enough people in my life tell me things on a need to know basis, I wasn’t going to do that to him too.’ Draco understood that but chose not to reply. He didn’t want to relive all time times someone had made a decision for him
“Pansy!” He called as he raced through the Manor. He needn’t have shouted so loud as she was exactly where he had left her in the parlour. The only difference was that she was now curled in a chair with an old copy of Witch Weekly. On the cover was Potter, straddling a broomstick with a determined look on his face, and gazing into the distance after an imaginary snitch.
“No it wasn’t!” He exclaimed, probably too quickly. “People should get to hear you. It would be a crime to keep talent like that hidden.” It seemed important to tell her that. It didn’t matter that they weren’t yet friends or that at one point in time he had thought he hated her, right now all that mattered was that she saw in herself what he saw in her.
‘Ok…’ He felt bad that he wasn’t catching on.
‘What?’
“Do you think hummus goes with chocolate?” Draco asked him, completely oblivious to what he was doing to Harry.
“I’m sorry?”
The tiredness was going to be difficult to overcome if he was going to try it, but Granger was right, he had to keep trying.
‘You’re right. It was a stupid idea. I just-’
He shook hands with Arthur, whom he hadn’t had much chance to talk to all day, and he reassured him it was good to see him at The Burrow again. Molly attacked him with bear hugs and berated him for not coming to visit more often, only letting them go once he’d made his promises to stop by in the new year.
It meant Harry going alone though. Being the first one to see him when he got off the train. The first hug, the first smile, the first story. Draco would be second. He was always second.
which was just around the corner from Draco’s favourite quirky bookshop on
‘I fucking knew it.’ Harry hissed. ‘Draco are you mad?’
It was fine not seeing Potter throughout his house arrest. Even not seeing him, he’d still known that he was out there somewhere, probably not thinking about Draco at all. It was different knowing that Potter might not be anywhere at all. He could have even just ceased to exist. But now, knowing that even if he wanted to he couldn’t see Potter’s stupid scar and ridiculous hair, it feels different. He might ever see Potter again, and that would mean that he would never get to tell him that against all his better judgements he-
The sensation was less sickening the second time. Despite the feeling of his being breaking into pieces and reforming, he no longer felt like he was reforming into the wrong shape. It was still weird, and the process seemed to take longer than it had the first time but gritting his teeth and waiting for the waves of nausea to pass, he eventually found himself back on four legs.
As soon as he crossed the threshold into Luna’s house, he felt relaxed. Stepping into her home was like walking into a tropical paradise because although Luna had begun training to be a magizoologist, her house was filled with plants to rival Neville’s obscure tastes. She never locked her door to anyone, so Harry was free to walk right through.
‘She’s the best in the hospital you know. Pots requested her specifically because she wouldn’t discriminate. With your mark coming back…we were worried it was all going to kick off again.’ Pansy’s voice had dropped to a whisper and Draco felt uneasy at the implications of what having the mark burned onto his arm again might be.
‘Should I…?’ Harry had stayed routed to the spot the whole time, as though transfixed by the shock of Draco stripping and going to bed. As if it wasn’t something people did every day.
“But surely they’re still checking ID? Can we even still perform magic if we’re muggles?” Draco didn’t like this idea much, but Granger didn’t seem perturbed.
He was just deciding whether it would be safe to take the family time-turner with him, or to leave it in his Gringotts vault, when the floo flared. He didn’t even have time to register who it was before he was being yanked up by his collar and pressed against the nearest wall.
‘It’s not long now,’ Harry said with a grin after they’d pulled away, looking over at the decorations which still hadn’t been put up. Draco hadn’t wanted to do it alone and Harry had been off with him for days, so they’d just been left exactly where they were.
Draco was as red as a cherry, but Harry couldn’t stop grinning.
No longer sporting the abstract colours and loose silhouette of Luna’s wardrobe, Malfoy cut a severe figure. She was sitting sideways on an armchair, her tight, black jean-clad legs draped over one arm. Harry could see she wore very tall and thickly heeled black boots which made her thin legs look even longer, although her top half remained concealed. Over the wing of the armchair he could see she was holding a book one-handed, the pages propped open with her little finger and thumb. The text was tiny and dense, and Harry couldn’t make out any of the words from such a distance.
‘It’s ok, I love you too.’ Draco’s breath hitched. He didn’t know what to say to that. This was so much worse than he thought it would be. He loved Harry and Harry loved him, but Draco lied through his teeth about his issues and Harry went behind Draco’s back and accused him of a potions addiction. God, this was such a mess and now that Teddy had gone to Hogwarts, there was nothing distracting them from their own issues.
‘I er, I found my wand.’ He said hesitantly when he found Harry in his office. He was scouring paperwork, presumably some he’d just picked up.
‘Daddy?’ Draco wheeled around and all of his anger vanished when Teddy was stood before him in floods of tears.
‘Draco? Draco. Calm down, breathe. I’ve got you.’ Draco felt himself being pulled into the warmth.
‘Fuck off Harry, come here.’ He muttered with his eyes still closed.
“Potter…? Are you alright? You look frightfully grey… Harry!” He nearly fell face first through the doorway and into Lyra, but she caught his arm to steady him. Aspen cried and ran off when Harry’s arms went slack around him and he dropped to the floor. “Harry you need to sit down.” He nodded vaguely and allowed her to steer him into the flat and set him down on the sofa. He wanted to ask her how she knew where he lived and what she was doing here, but as he opened his mouth a wave of nausea hit him, and he clamped it shut until it passed.
‘It’s fine, Hermione. I understand. You’d better attack those flame-headed kids with
‘I think this rose window is my favourite,’ he mused as they stood beneath the South window. There were three rose windows in the cathedral – one of which was half covered by the organ – a shame, but it wasn’t Draco favourite anyway.
‘Draco?’ He couldn’t hear what Harry was doing over the spray of the shower and the blood rushing in his ears. He should’ve seen it coming. Of course he should’ve.
“You look very pale,” Lyra said, her face creased with unease. She reached out instinctively to support him when he swayed on the spot, but she wouldn’t have been able to catch him if he had fallen.
Draco smiled, his day brightened immensely by Teddy’s enthusiasm. He stroked Eltanin’s head lightly as he folded the letter back up one-handed and watch as he flew off, probably to hunt. Deciding that getting Teddy a broom for Christmas probably wasn’t a good idea, he went back upstairs to the study to pen a response.
How had he not realised it before? They had suspected that it could take a while for the spell to take root. Hadn’t they tried to wait for it to settle before they were ambushed by the Hit Wizards? But he’d been hit with that spell and he’d blacked out. The next thing he’d known was waking up in this cell. But he’d seen Potter in those moments when the world was slipping sideways. That feeling of being in two places at once… in the depths of the Ministry but simultaneously somewhere warm with Potter’s green eyes looking right at him.
‘Excellent. What can you tell us then?’ Kingsley said, taking a seat next to Draco in front of Harry’s desk. It was weirdly reminiscent of the first meeting they’d had when the Minister had offered Draco the contract.
He left Pansy and Blaise on the balcony of the first-floor parlour and explored the rest of the chateau alone. After taking a few wrong turns and getting lost, he eventually found what could only be described as the master suite, although it took up almost a whole floor. Draco was drawn immediately to the floor-to-ceiling white shutters – he could just imagine himself waking up in this room and drawing them slowly, letting the whole room flood with bright sunlight-
‘IT’S FUCKING MEDICATION!’ Draco screamed. Harry stopped mid-rant and stared wide-eyed and open-mouthed.
‘Right. Sorry. Anyway, aside from that, how are you feeling?’ She asked him seriously.
“Shhh, shhh. I’m staying here, ok? Just here.” He pointed to the sofa he was preparing to sleep on as if the fox could understand English. The fox was quiet, watching him with an unnerving gleam in its eyes. “I’m going to stay here until morning and then we’re going to take you home, okay?” It blinked once at him, its wide eyes shining in the tiny sliver of light coming in through the curtains. It seemed to be assessing what Harry was saying and, deciding it approved of his plan, lay down in the bed.
‘Draco my boy, you don’t have to explain anything to me. I understand. Even if I didn’t, you don’t owe me an explanation just because I’m the Minister for Magic. You’re entitled to your privacy. Now, as for your current state, is there anything you’d like me to know?’ Kingsley fixed Draco with a knowing look and Draco understood why Kingsley had been such a formidable Auror.
‘Yes. I needed to ask you if you’d watch Ted this weekend. I have business to attend to.’ Draco was surprised by how formal he sounded. It reminded him of his father, and not in a nice way.
“Yes. But not just sunlight. All light.” Harry qualifies. “And electrical!” Although it’s unlikely anything in this library will mention electricity.
He looked up and let out a cry of pain when he saw Harry and the man in a tight embrace, locking lips like there was no one around. Harry’s arms were curled into the back of the man’s coat like he was holding on for dear life.
‘Ok, ok. I’m not missing out on this.’ Harry strode over to them and joined their hug, turning it into a Teddy sandwich. Teddy started giggling just like he had as a child and it was music to Draco’s ears. The house hadn’t heard a sound like that for so long Draco suspected even the magic within the walls could feel it.
He glanced at the clock on the mantle. 9:26pm. Draco had promised he’d be back by 7:30pm and there was no sign of him anywhere. Harry had already sent a patronus to Hermione, asking her if she’d heard from him. The response had been “Bugger off, Harold. You know Friday night is date night. It’s not my fault you’ve got blue balls, his arse will be exactly the same at 9pm as it would be at 7pm.”
Draco had heard enough. There were pictures all over the page of him, looking suspicious as all hell. Of course, they managed to catch him on the one day he forgot to use either Polyjuice or a disillusionment charm.
‘No thank you.’ Spungen nodded and disappeared again. Draco realised Harry had stepped outside and was talking furiously down the phone. He was gripped with a sudden fear that it was Wood again. If it was, would Harry tell him? It would certainly be an interesting test.
Draco sucked in great lungfuls of air as he stumbled away from the pensieve. His heart was pounding, and his body was shaking. He realised now, now that he was getting better and he’d had time to come to terms with himself, that he hadn’t been protecting Harry from anything. He’d been lying.
‘I realise that; however, both were employed under the Death Eater occupation of the Ministry, and Mafalda was a confirmed informant. Unfortunately, the Ministry didn’t have the resources to send either of them to trial at the time, and they were allowed to go on probation.’ Draco heaved a sigh. The injustice of it all.
‘Oh.’ He sat back down at the table dejectedly.
He wrapped an arm around Draco’s waist and tugged him over so that he straddled Harry. The kiss was feverous and when Draco’s fingers wound their way into Harry’s hair an unsolicited moan escaped him.
Draco knew they weren’t about to jump straight back into a marriage that had been doomed from the start. He doubted they could even if they wanted to. They’d grown as individuals in the years they’d spent away from each other, and they understood how to be who they were on their own. Draco firmly believed they’d learned from past mistakes, and whilst they weren’t ready to be them again, Draco knew that one day, just maybe, they could be.
She sighed, but she was smiling too. “If it’ll shut you up, but I’m not saying I’m going to help.”
“Yes?” Malfoy calls from the far end of the room. All Harry can see of him is the gleam of his white-blond hair in the sunlight coming in from the only window. It makes him look angelic. How ironic.
‘I think so.’
Somewhere in the back of Harry’s mind, he knew that even now it would be impossible for him to part with this fox. He was more than convinced that it was magical; the way it seemed to understand him wasn’t just vulpine intelligence. He had witnessed the fox’s thought processes, watched it listen and react to Harry. It was wholly unperturbed by the magic in the flat, as if it was the most natural thing in the world.
‘I’m not an elf!’ Ella popped up over from under the table. Draco pretended to be surprised.
‘I love you.’ Teddy said, looking up at them with a smile.
The fancy coffee beans did nothing today however. He forced himself to drink it, but he didn’t enjoy it at all and he hoped it wasn’t going to set a sour tone for the day. He spent the early hours reading at the window seat, the only feature of the flat Draco could say he actually loved. Sometime around 7am, which was far too early from Draco’s experience, he heard light footsteps across the wooden floor.
“Well I’m telling you now,” he says while still picturing her without her signature frizz. “Now if you’re quite done disrupting my peace and quiet…”
‘He is a bit, but don’t worry, that’s not why I want to talk to him. I also think a certain someone should be doing their homework,’ Harry said pointedly. Draco stifled a laugh when Ella huffed dramatically.
‘Harry it’s…it’s perfect. Thank you.’ He slipped the ring onto his right hand and flung his arms around Harry and cried unashamedly into his shoulder. Harry rocked him gently as his tears soaked through his thick Christmas jumper.
His head hurt with all the questions and the constant drumming of Draco’s name. He had to do something about it, but it was getting harder to think or see straight. Ron was trying to get him to lie down again but Harry wasn’t having any of it. Sleeping wasn’t what he needed, he needed to get out of the house and do something about it. Something far away from that cursed tapestry.
‘What the hell are you doing here?’ Harry barked at him. He was wearing nothing but his underwear, he had total bed hair and Draco was finding it very difficult to take him seriously, even though he knew Harry could destroy him in the blink of an eye.
‘Listen to me,’ he took Teddy’s hands in his. ‘We’ve always taught you to be the best you. To be kind and considerate and always help people and you’ve done so well at that. We’re very, very proud of you. But sometimes there are things you can’t control and there are times when it’s not your job to fix it. This is one of those times. I’ll be ok, I promise you. That doesn’t mean I’ll get my magic back, and that’s ok, because I’ll still have you, and I’ll still have your dad, and that’s what matters.’ Teddy flung his arms around Draco’s neck and almost cut off his air supply.
‘Paying cars!’ He waved a toy car into Harry’s face with a cheeky grin. Harry feigned excitement to match.
‘It’s Potter, actually.’ She gave him an even wider smile.
That evening, just before they went to bed, Draco added the hair Granger had supplied to the Polyjuice. It fizzed and spluttered, his turning a murky green and Granger’s turning a reddish brown. Polyjuice wasn’t meant to work so well with muggles, that much was obvious.
He didn’t say it enough, he knew that much. He couldn’t expect Harry to know how Draco felt if he didn’t tell him so. How could anyone express this feeling? It was like his heart could burst with how much he loved Harry, but that wouldn’t sound very nice if he said it. Did everyone feel like that about their partner? That the world would just cease to exist if anything ever happened to them? He’d lost Harry before of course, but he had always been there. He hadn’t gone far.
“Is everything ok?” Harry asked Sirius’ shoulder when his godfather didn’t let him go.
He was nervous as he got ready to go to Harry’s. He knew now he was able to apparate in and out, but it didn’t feel quite right to do so. It wasn’t his home anymore and his mother always told him it was rude to apparate into other people’s homes.
He headed home to get changed before he went to pick up Teddy. Normally Harry fed Teddy before he went to Draco’s since Draco used to work late on a Friday, which no one hated more than him. Ok, Harry probably hated it more, but that wasn’t exactly a surprise.
‘Can you even take that stuff?’ He faltered. He hadn’t even considered that.
‘Ok, ok, I’m letting you out. Keep your feathers on.’ He opened the front door and Eltanin was off in a flash. Draco watched him for a few moments as he flew high up above the treeline and disappeared into the fog. He did hope it wasn’t so foggy that he wouldn’t find his way back. Then again, he was a magical owl after all.
‘I never got ‘round to changing it back.’ He said quietly. Harry scoffed.
Draco was on edge from the minute he stepped through the barrier. He’d taken a double dose of his potion, against his better judgement, and could only hope that he would hold up long enough for the train to leave before he had his inevitable breakdown. Pansy, god bless her terrifying soul, was waiting at his flat for him. She hadn’t hesitated when he’d ask her to come and he would forever be grateful for her.
When she was gone, Harry dissolved into laughter.
Draco was incredibly confused. He wanted so much to leave here and get Harry out of his head but every time he saw him recently, it was like Harry really wanted him there. He didn’t understand what had changed. Yes, Draco always complained that Harry was around everywhere he went, but he’d never tried to engage with Draco like this. In fact, Harry was often quite cold and shut off. Draco should’ve expected that though, Harry thought Draco stopped loving him.
Potter slumped lazily onto the sofa across the room. He seemed very tired and fell asleep almost immediately, while Draco’s heart was still hammering and he felt like he was on high alert. His hearing picked up all of the traffic noise outside, which suggested Potter and the weasel lived in a muggle neighbourhood. He could hear each rustle of leave and lashing wind. It felt so undignified to be sleeping in a pet bed on the floor of Potter’s home. So undignified that after an hour he still wasn’t asleep. Perhaps he couldn’t sleep here at all, he didn’t yet know.
Draco cried out but the only sound was an inhuman screeching. He blinked rapidly, trying to figure out what was going on, but then something sharp and hot pierced his back. He pitched forward and hit his head.
‘Do you think we’ll look this suave when we’re old?’ Harry asked him as his started picking some of the white out of Draco’s hair.
“Potter you need to calm down, I’m quite alright.” The breathiness in her tone made him look away from the fox to find her clutching her right arm in her left, faint lines of blood starting to seep through her sleeve.
It was the fifth door they tried that made Granger halt. There wasn’t anything immediately obvious about it, but when he opened his mouth to ask her if this was the right one, she held up a hand to silence him. And then he heard whispers coming from inside. It was a long rectangular room which was very dimly lit with what looked like a large pit sunken in the middle.
‘Of course.’ Draco said as he took the seat next to Harry. He could feel his eyes burning through the side of his head, but he refused to look. He regretted choosing to wear his muggle suit today. He figured it would be good to make one of his rare appearances at the Ministry an opportunity to show how much he had changed, and muggle fashion was an excellent way to do that. Harry, however, had always loved seeing Draco in this style of suit. Muggle formalwear was much more tight-fitting and tailored than its wizarding counterpart. Draco fought to keep the heat away from his cheeks and his attention on the Minister.
‘Draco, I’m your friend here. I’m asking you because you’re the most skilled potioneer I know. You also come highly recommended by people I happen to trust with my life. You don’t have to take the opportunity, and I will not blame you if you choose to turn me down, but I’m offering the contract to you first and foremost.’ Draco was gobsmacked. Someone at the Ministry recommended him? He could hardly believe it. Who would stick their neck out for him? Harry certainly wouldn’t. Not any more at least. Was there someone in the auror department he didn’t know he knows?
“Harry?” Their argument hung suspended in the air as they both stared at him. He didn’t recall making a sound, but something had caught their attention. He was surprised to notice Lyra looked almost as concerned as Sirius and he jumped when she touched his knee under the table. She jerked back violently as if she’d been burned.
“There isn’t a spell for fixing clutches you idiot! You know magic doesn’t work on muggle tech!” Harry pulled his phone out of his pocket and of course, like every clichéd muggle film he had ever seen, he had no signal. So much for calling a breakdown service.
Her head shot up from the book when she heard his voice and she smiled so big he thought her face might crack in two. The gap between her front teeth making his heart melt just a little.
‘Oh, right.’ Draco heard the curtain scrape against the rail and he let out a breath he didn’t know he was holding. He’d wanted a shower with a door anyway, not a stupid flimsy shower curtain. Stupid bloody curtain. Stupid bloody Harry. Stupid bloody day.
works just fine?’ Draco grinned cheekily.
‘Don’t you dare, Draco. None of this is your fault.’ He reached out and stroked a thumb across Draco’s right cheek and if it wasn’t just a little bit terrified of this situation, he probably would’ve melted right there and then. ‘Hell, if I hadn’t been such an arse to you, you never would have left in the first place. You have no idea how terrified I was when I saw you lying here. I thought you were dead. On the bright side though, if you’re the target of the neo-Death Eaters, you can’t be one of them. It’s done your reputation wonders.’ Harry joked but the implication was clear.
‘You’re right. I’m sorry, it’s just frustrating. Every time I go, they say the same thing even though I do everything they tell me and then I came home, and I thought I’d make the house look nice for when Ted comes home, and I can’t even do that because I put the decorations under a shrinking charm and-’
“And why would you?” He gives Harry a piercing look that makes him think Malfoy knows him better than he would like. Harry fumbles around what words to say in what order when Malfoy saves him. “Not all of us posh twats sit around in our massive houses ordering servants around all day. The novelty wears off by the time you turn ten.”
‘Looking at you like what?’
In the end he slumped back down on the unstable bed and closed his watering eyes, unable to fend off the scenarios he had been surreptitiously avoiding for ages. He saw Potter’s body lying cold on the floor in the Department of Mysteries having failed to make it through the veil. Draco had never actually been inside the DoM, so all his brain could conjure was the sight of Potter’s gaunt face crushed into the ground in a sea of blackness much like Draco’s holding cell. Then he imagined Potter reunited with Black – the same scraggly dark hair as he had had in those wanted posted when he’d escaped but now fuller in the face and wearing real clothes instead of Azkaban rags. He imagined the two of them sitting together, laughing. Maybe they were laughing at a bad joke Potter had told, or maybe they were laughing at Draco sitting there in the dark.
‘I can respect that, Draco.’ Harry said gently and Draco nearly fell apart. ‘For the record, I don’t think there’s anything you could do that could make me hate you.’ It didn’t seem to matter what happened, Harry always had the capacity for forgiveness.
Draco could tell that Teddy wasn’t faring much better than himself. His hair was a dull shade of brown instead of the turquoise it usually was, or even the bubble-gum shade of pink it sometimes turned when he was overexcited. Draco took a deep breath as he approached but didn’t have as much time as he’d have liked to compose himself because Teddy had clocked him and launched himself into Draco’s arms. Draco clutched him as close to his chest as physically possible without Teddy crawling inside him and resisted the urge to cry his heart out.
‘Would you…’
‘Alright.’ He said in the end. Teddy reached up and kissed his cheek, a highly unusual thing to do but Draco appreciated it anyway.
‘We love you too bud.’ Harry said with a fondness that made Draco’s heart swell with affection for his small, messy little family. He wouldn’t change them for the world.
Inside, the chateau was much as Draco had expected it. The hallway was almost completely white marble with a wide central staircase complete with gilded gold handrails. As he glanced around, the whole place screamed grandeur, but years of neglect had taken its toll. The giant crystal chandelier had fallen from the ceiling at some point, leaving a gaping hole in the ornate ceiling mouldings and a scattering of jewels across the floor that were so dusty they probably wouldn’t even glint should they be exposed to sunlight.
‘Ok.’ He said instead.
“My mother was particularly skilled at it, but I learned most of what I know now at university. I took an entire degree in it actually. It was rather fun.”
Hours and hours went by and no one came for him and it became harder to keep a level head. It shouldn’t have been surprising that he wasn’t going to be treated fairly. This was the same justice department which at one time had been under his father’s thumb. A few more hours and he would be in danger of losing his fingers, since the feeling still hadn't returned. The small space he had to wiggle his fingers in was not enough to keep his circulation flowing. He had tried banging on the thick metal door, but all it did was make his foot sore in the thin, leather-soled shoes he was wearing.
Two weeks passed in which little changed. Harry went to work, grabbed drinks with Ron, saw Hermione when she was free, and texted with Draco every day. He didn’t see Draco, and found that he missed him, so on a Saturday, he asked if they could get together between or after Draco’s dance classes or otherwise.
Draco swung himself up onto the window ledge, his legs dangling out over the edge.
He wondered when he would see Draco again. It seemed inevitable, since his two closest friends were dating two of Draco's closest friends.
He considered talking to Hermione, but he didn’t know what he would say, and really, it wasn’t his place to talk to her about any of this. That was Ron's job. Unlike Ron, Harry hadn't done anything wrong.
“Haha, very funny. I think I’m just trying to be his friend. I don’t know.” He considered it.  “I don’t know
Daphne glanced towards the head table. “I’m going to guess ten years. They seem happy.”
He’d resolved months ago to not be shy about this anymore. He was, generally, out of the closet, at least with his friends. But still, why had he admitted it to
Draco considered bluffing, but decided against it. “I really am.”
“I don’t mean that in a bad way. I mean…I’ve fancied you, a bit. Thought it was stupid, since you were with Gin and also since I thought you were straight. Never thought I would do anything about it, of course. Just fancy you from afar.” Charlie laughed, deep and contagious, so that Harry couldn’t help but smile.
Hermione sighed. “Why am I not surprised. That boy has no sense. You two need to keep an eye on him.”
“Right, but. I just hope you know that it’s okay. I mean, where I’m concerned. I want to see Ginny happy and you seem to make her happy and so. It’s okay. I won’t spontaneously combust if I see you two together. In fact, I think we ought to, ah. Try to do that sometime. Be around each other. All of us.”
His head was not firmly in the game, and that was a problem.
Draco was pacing in circles around the clearing. They would be found and captured, he thought. Tortured, probably. He knew how many deranged methods of inflicting pain the Dark Lord had, not to mention dear Aunt Bella. He realized he was muttering to himself, and tried to keep his lips pressed together. If they saw him talking to himself, they’d worry, although maybe they should be worried because Draco was almost positive he was losing his mind.
“I’m not going.”
There was music playing then, and people began to dance. Harry, thanks to his state of advanced inebriation, agreed to dance a bit with Euri, but they mostly snogged instead. Anybody and everybody could see them, but Harry found he didn’t care. He kind of wanted Malfoy to see.
Hermione’s chambers were modern and informal, particularly when compared to the rest of the members’ chambers. Draco had come here often enough for the earliest discussions regarding his candidacy. Hermione had been the one to urge him to run in the first place.
Kerrick spent the next day with Draco in the courtyard. For hours, they sat in silence, learning the way Sen felt in the world around them, learning to recognize what was there without seeing it. Slowly, Draco began to realize that while Sen was the same everywhere, while it was an almost physical, tangible thing that vibrated with life, it took the shape of things. The Sen in a rabbit felt like a rabbit. The Sen in a stone felt like a stone. The Sen in a flowering bush felt like a flowering bush.
He was probably overreacting, wasn’t he? He could stay until the end of Robbie’s set, tell Robbie he’d done a brilliant job, and leave – it didn’t have to be a big deal. He had to teach at 7:00 the next day, which was always a great excuse for calling a night early (although Robbie knew him well enough to know that was utter bullshit, since Harry had taught hungover and without sleep and, on a few ignominious occasions, still a little drunk).
“Well, we know a bit more now,” said Potter. “We know there’s a Queen and people who are on her side and people who aren’t. We know that you run the risk of getting kidnapped, apparently.”
“Sounds painful, Hermione. Please don’t do that.”
Harry exhaled so long that Draco was surprised he didn’t deflate himself. “Okay. Good. Brilliant.” He finally moved to get off the lift.
While none of the Weasleys besides Ginny seemed overly impressed with Draco, they all more or less accepted his presence beside Harry. And Mrs. Weasley even made him a sweater with a big fucking ‘D’ on it, which he wore for the rest of the day, rather proudly.
She giggled. “Merlin, Harry, I’m not in love with you, if that’s what you’re asking. I think you’re very cute, and you kiss divinely, and you’re someone new, which I’ve desperately needed. But that’s it. And I don’t, as a rule, date anyone. Haven’t since Draco.”
“Oh, that’s good,” Potter said. “What’s it going to do to me?”
“I’m going to work,” said Harry, before realizing that storming out was pointless. Ron was also at work. Ron was wound through Harry’s entire life, through every facet of it. Ron was inescapable. “Don’t come in today. And don’t stay here. Call in sick and go home. I don’t think I can be around you right now.”
Harry took a deep breath before replying. “He’s great. He’s gotten to be a good friend over the last few months.” And that was true. He did think Draco was great, generally, and he was a good friend. Despite whatever the hell was going on tonight.
.” He cleared his throat and looked down at the table. “I’m just so sorry,” he said in a smaller voice.
this way, not just Scorpius.”
The night gets worse, then better, then worse
“And the night?” Pansy said, waggling her brows.
“Malfoy, you could offer your arse to Harry. Just to be a good friend. That way he could fuck someone without having to put on jeans.”
“Um. No?” Potter said. “No, look.” He spread his hands out for her and Draco did the same.
The green eyes blinked, and then Potter was turning away, and then he was gone. “What? What’s wrong?” asked Ernie.
“Well, I’m a
need you. I can’t do this without you. Harry, please.”
“Well, that’s good, then, isn’t it?”
“Home?” Hermione asked.
“Harry,” Draco said, stopping for a moment. Harry looked at him expectantly, bright eyes fixed on his face. “I…you must know, don’t you? How I feel, that I – that I, um. Might love you, too.”
“Yes, well. Harry was an idiot, what can I say?”
William left four men behind to keep watch over the town for a fortnight, but it was almost certain that the Queensguard wouldn’t be back, not after Draco had used Sen once more, this time to create a protective barrier, like a
Harry found himself feeling warm. Damn it, Euri was so likeable, and really quite handsome. He felt his reservations about the evening slipping away.
Draco nodded. He looked so scared. “I just – I never want to hurt you again. Not even like this. I never – “
“He does something to me, that boy. Every time. It’s his only detriment.”
Remind me as they say
“Prat,” Draco said, pinching his waist gently.
There were occasional uprisings among the nobility. Plots that had to be snuffed out, grasps for power. No one seemed particularly opposed to William, but he was a new ruler, and they assumed that meant weak, and weakness meant opportunity. But after the first few attempts to unseat him failed miserably, everyone settled down, and things began to normalize. By the time summer had come and gone, the land was quiet and peaceful, and Draco began to wonder whether he should go home. The need for him here had abated, even though he knew William desperately wanted him to remain at his side.
Harry leapt up, trying to yank his trousers up at the same time and stumbling on his way over to Draco. “Would you hang on?” he cried.
William nodded. “That’s fascinating. I can see why it’s eating at you.”
“I suppose,” Draco said. He was trying very hard not to hold this against her, but it was difficult. Hermione was meddlesome, and sometimes it manifested in very aggravating ways, but this really took the cake. “You might’ve talked to me about it first.”
When they were about halfway up the endless drive, Pansy Parkinson came shrieking out of the door. “Oh Salazar, thank goodness!” she cried, literally running at them. She looked different than she usually looked in the Ministry, where she wore trendy glasses and smart, designer robes, and had her hair in a sleek black bob. She was wearing
“I don’t know. It was all so fast,” Draco said, just as Harry began to blink his eyes open.
Harry pulled Draco towards him once more, a short, sweet kiss, and then he collected the bags and called for the kids. Lily hugged his middle and James and Al each took a hand, and Harry held Draco’s eyes until the last minute, when he disapparated back to his own house.
“Oh, I, ah.” Draco shrugged. “I let her punch me in the face.”
Draco bristled. Only because this was supposed to be Slytherins and Potter, not a great big party. It had nothing to do with not wanting to see Blaise cuddled up with Padma. Nothing at all. “Oh, wonderful.”
“Come on,” Harry said. “Risks are kind of like…my thing.”
With another sigh, he resigned himself to sitting still while Frankie wove braids into little pieces of his hair, leaving the rest down. It was getting long, almost to his shoulders. Then she wove a garland of small purple-blue flowers together and settled it on his head. “Flowers?” he asked her.
He was out there, Draco knew it. He just had to find him.
“Helloooo, all you beautiful boys and girls,” said Daphne, stumbling over to them. Draco put an arm around her and kissed her cheek.
Malfoy smiled, a real, non-smirky smile. “Thank you. I – well, I’ve worked hard at it. And it’s fun, actually. I always danced, you know. Ballet, ballroom, tap.”
“I’m going to go find Draco, wish him luck,” Harry said into Ari’s ear. Ari put a warm hand on his back as he spoke and leaned towards him, then nodded, giving him a quick kiss on the cheek. Ari looked gorgeous tonight, and they’d had a brilliant shag right before Pansy and Sarah came over, and yet all Harry wanted to do was see Draco.
After Draco'd spoken the magic words – free drinks -- everyone suddenly seemed to agree that clubbing might be okay.
Short of that, Astoria had several backup plans. But there was no need to resort to those yet. Better to see Draco and Potter in action this evening at Potter’s birthday party, see how the next week or so unfolded, and then take stock of the situation.
“Fine,” said Draco. “You’re terrible. You’ll never beat me.”
In the afternoon, he got an owl from Pansy.

“More like…enemies to lovers to friends and then back to lovers and now to running mates.”
want?”
The creature didn’t return, but no one slept after that.
Draco, feeling that it was probably acceptable, leaned over and gave Harry a kiss on the cheek and Harry leaned into it, looking happy. “Don’t keep him up too late, ‘Moine. You know what a bastard he is without his eight hours.”
“Come on,” Harry said, nudging him.
Harry grinned and glanced around before taking Draco’s hand. “Come on,” he said, pulling him into a quiet corridor. He shoved him into a little alcove and then attacked him with his mouth.
Ron whistled. “That’s kind of hot, though, innit?”
And things that you know
“Yeah, we swear,” said Ron. “Can’t risk your wrath, Harry.”
“They were people.”
you?!” Harry cried.
“They’re called pounds, Harry. And I’ve got some already.”
“She took the kids to her parents’ house for the weekend and didn’t speak to me for three days.”
Charlie laughed. “It was alright. You’re a decent shag, I s’pose.”
He hoped Harry was still alive.
And last night, at the party, he and Malfoy had worked together, and talked together, and been on a team together, and it had all been so fun. Malfoy was
He kept walking past the blue room and the second floor, and took Ari up to the third, to the big master bedroom that used to be two separate rooms and held no memories of Draco at all. He let Ari fuck him nice and slow. Ari was careful to make sure everything felt good for Harry, and Ari’s mouth was gentle the whole time, and afterward, when Harry started to feel that familiar creeping sensation all over his body, he forced himself to relax.
“Yeah, well. Pansy’s lovely.”
Harry had no idea what to say and found himself staring open-mouthed at Malfoy. “I don’t –” He gulped. “I don’t
“Little? I’m 6’1, for your information. You’re shorter than me.”
Harry crossed his arms over his chest and looked around, spotting Pansy and Sarah behind him. They waved, and he shot them a questioning look. Pansy shrugged, looking as confused as he felt. He wished he could go sit with them, but staff and family was supposed to be sitting towards the front.
Harry’s eyebrows shot up for an instant and then he recovered himself. “Well, yeah. I still think you will, to be honest.”
“Hey, so, would you be able to meet in the Room of Requirement tonight?” he asked.
Theo Nott?
“Not with Charlie, and like I’d tell you if it
She looked up at him in shock. “I – I was. I’m not anymore.” She bit down on her lips again. “I’m sorry,” she whispered.
“Oh, damn,” Draco said eloquently. “When?”
“Are you ready?” asked Granger, poking her head into Draco’s office.
Francis and the Lights /
William stayed at the window, his eyes tracing the paths of clouds. He was, as ever, the very picture of a prince, of a king, with his broad shoulders and dark-gold hair, his serious expression and his fine profile. He was beautiful, and he was kind, and he was good, even if he was only human, with all that humanity entailed.
Then Harry pulled away, mumbled goodbye, and set off down the gravel path.
Then Harry realized that was probably the point exactly. It was meant to give the illusion of freedom, but it didn’t, not really. “Hang on,” Harry said to Cian, stepping back a bit.
“You want to go dance? Or watch?”
He didn’t use that word lightly. He knew that in many conflicts, many wars, there was no real evil besides the violence itself. There was only disagreement on a grand scale, good and bad on both sides. But
Suddenly a blue light appeared several feet away, growing larger and brighter until Professor Lupin and George appeared. It took Draco several moments to realize that not only was Lupin supporting George, who was unconscious, but George was also bleeding profusely.
,” He managed, nipping at Draco’s throat. “I’m gonna come if you keep this up.”
“Only because you need someone to talk to right now. Because of all your Weasley drama.”
Harry watched, still laughing, as the muscles of his shoulders rippled and he elegantly brought himself back down to the ground.
They were not. Once he got up to ground level and began walking, he found that a lot of them were actually quite rude and grouchy, and even pushy. At one point he glanced down at the map for ten seconds and some arsehole shoved him with his shoulder and snarled, “Hey, watch where you’re going!”
. “What do you want?”
It wasn’t a romantic kiss, or even a particularly passionate one. It was a nasty, brutal sort of business, more teeth and tongue than anything, mouth-to-mouth warfare that was sure to leave them both bloody and bruised. Malfoy’s hands were gripping his shoulders tight, nails pinching at Harry through the fabric of his shirt, and Harry moved his hands down to Malfoy’s slim hips, returning the favor, fingers digging deep as he could manage, aiming to hurt.
Draco never knew quite how to deal with it. He knew how to shout at Potter, how to strive against him, how to
“What is this?” he asked. “How do you know about this? Is there no food?”
“You’re busy,” Draco said, standing back up and shoving his hands in his pockets, feeling stupid.
That night, when everyone was fast asleep, Draco unlocked the chest he kept at the foot of his bed and carefully lifted out the silver Time-Turner. After the incident with Pansy in the cellar, he was afraid to skip directly ahead to the aftermath of the war. He decided he would not push the ruby quite that far this time, maybe ease into the future instead. He slid it over to the sixteen, and then moved the moonstone to seven. “The water of time flows downhill, but I will send it up the mountain,” he whispered, placing his hand on the indentation. “I will bend its path to my will.”
Theo looked at him for a moment, and then nodded. “Of course. Yes.”
“Euri, you didn’t mention that Zabini and Malfoy were

“Asleep in the tent.”
“I’m sorry, ‘Mione. I should have asked you to come. You could’ve helped. I’m sorry.”
you be his friend? Or will all your feelings keep interfering?”
“There’s owls,” offered Harry.
Harry nodded. “Yeah. I promise.”
“I want your mouth on me,” Harry said, his voice sounding hoarse. “If that’s okay.”
The meeting that night went exactly as Draco knew it would. He had to give a report to a roomful of Death Eaters and the Dark Lord while his father writhed on the floor. Then he had to leave without even saying goodbye. It was just as horrible this time as it had been the first.
But Draco would have plenty of time later to dwell on that and feel guilty. For now, he had to fix this for Harry. “Where?”
. William talked about you like you were some sort of savior before you’d even learned how to swing a sword! I’d served him my
“Behind us. Make one behind us,” Lia hissed at him.
“Fourteen months, if we’re keeping track. And I am. Makes me feel young and hip.”
Draco nodded. “Mysteries is going to have a field day with that information, huh? Doesn’t track with the last time.”
His phone buzzed. He glanced at it, and saw that Sarah had texted.
“And the longer we let the NMP grow and amass followers, the bigger of a threat they’ll be. If we quash them now, while they’re just getting off the ground, then hopefully we won’t have to deal with another movement like this for another decade or two. But Harry, make no mistake. There will always be another Voldemort. This is taught, sometimes, in pureblood families, and sometimes a wizard comes to the same conclusions on his own, like in the case of Tom Riddle. It’s something in all of us, I think, because we
“No, really!” she cried. “It is! It reminds me a bit of me and Harry, actually. It’s different in some ways, of course. Harry and I don’t have sex with each other for one thing,” she said, biting down a smile. “But in other ways, I think it’s quite similar. He’s the best at telling me when I’ve been stupid and getting beyond what I

Robbie looked murderous. “Fine. You’d better set up a time with me soon, Harry. We need to talk about this. You owe me that much.”

“We should alert the whole force, shouldn’t we?” Harry asked.
“You bloody said you wanted Katie back! I’ve thought of a way to get her back for you. What is your

and the room looks like a
Harry and Lavender exchanged looks. New case or reprimand? You never knew with Robards. He was an exacting bastard, especially when it came to following proper procedure, which wasn’t always their strong suit. They both turned back to go to the Head Auror’s office. “No, just you, Potter. Not Brown,” Peabody said.
“Anyway, even though the making him jealous thing hasn’t worked the way we wanted it to, it’s just been easier, I suppose, to keep the ruse up. Keeps things easy with Harry and Pansy, you know, so that the dynamic isn’t so awkward when we’re all together.”  She laughed, suddenly. “Besides, I’m saving myself for Ron
“You ought to hang out with us Slytherins some time, Potter. If you want to see how the other side lives. You’d probably get a shag out of it.”
Tears pricked Draco’s eyes, but he blinked them back. He wasn’t sure what had happened; it wasn’t obvious. There was no stab wound, no gushing blood. There were marks around his throat, so perhaps it had been strangulation. Or perhaps he’d fallen and hit his head. Draco felt bile rising up in his throat, but he gulped it down.
It was going to be a long night.
, for fuck’s sake, completely overhauling St. Mungo’s Healer training program, not to mention all the marathons he ran all the time. But no. All that wasn’t enough. So, he wrote a fucking musical.” The dark-haired man pauses, chewing his lip. “Which is lovely, by the way. So lovely, and I say this as someone who has seen it ten times. The choreography is top-notch. I’m not just saying that.  And yes, Harry is aware that everyone needs a creative outlet, and Draco never had one before, and Harry is very glad this has made him happy.”
In his little flat above his shop, Draco changed into something he’d purchased just for this occasion. He loved clothes -- expensive, luxurious clothes in particular – but due to his own views of himself as well as the expectations that his family had set, he mostly wore traditional, conservative wizarding things. His mother and father might have finally accepted that he was bent, but they would never,
“I…of course I do.”
“I needed to talk to you,” Harry said. He thought that was obvious. “About what we talked about last Friday.”
“That’s a good one,” Harry agreed. “My favorite part’s coming up.” He prepared himself mentally, and then went all out, snarling the lyrics over his imaginary audience:
“After I talk to Blaise. I can stop by yours. Would that be okay?”
Harry blushed and hurried to grab a towel.
“How about New Years Eve?” Harry asked. “What did you do?”
“You – holy shit. Fucking hell, Harry,” Draco said, reaching for his hand again. He squeezed it tightly and wished he could hug him. “Well, thank fuck you did.
They all traipsed downstairs and Harry headed for the floo.
Astoria laughed. “We’ll see. This is all very new to us. We’ve been committed to this marriage for over a decade. I think we’ll need some time to readjust.”
Scorpius nodded.
“Hah, she does love her Celestina Warbeck, doesn’t she?” said Draco.
for someone else. Merlin knew he didn’t usually get off on that altruistic shit. He wasn’t
“No, definitely not,” Draco agreed. “And when they looked to match Astoria up with someone, they chose me. For the name. Malfoys have been supremely influential for generations, while Zabinis –”
“Uh-oh,” said Draco, which earned him a light smack.
How do you measure a year in a life?
“I mean, I think you need to
“Keep talking, and yes, we’ll move onto slamming, and then you’ll regret being so cheeky.”
“I mean, I got a bit of a gay vibe from him when I first met him. He was definitely checking me out, maybe flirting a little, but –“
After all, Harry could have had Draco, once.
“And now?” Draco asked, hardly daring to breathe.
“You’re welcome,” William said. “We are happy to have you with us in March. Thank you for making the journey.”
, Malfoy.”
“No! I liked you. I
Potter nodded and held out his arm. Draco took it and caught a whiff of Potter’s shampoo. It smelled like apples.
“Oh, hey,” Hermione said when they were back at the booth. The girls were pissed, Harry and Draco were on their way to being pissed, and Hermione had her head resting on Pansy’s shoulder. “What’re you guys going to be for Halloween? Harry, Ron and I are going as Mario and Luigi, if you want to be Yoshi or something.”
“I love you,” Harry breathed.
“Listen,” Charlie said, turning around to look at him. The sun was almost down behind the mountains, and darkness was approaching fast. “When we get home, don’t freak out, okay?”
“Yeah?” Harry asked, smiling at the goofy look on Charlie’s face. “And that’s a good thing?”
“What the hell! I am not getting off with someone in the loos either! I am a grown man with children, not a teenager!”
Malfoy laughed. Harry realized he looked a little unfocused, like maybe he was a bit pissed. “I’m just fucking with you, god.”
Draco nodded and began to move slowly, carefully. Harry watched his face, how tightly he held himself, how he was forcing himself to be slow and controlled. “Draco, you’re not going to hurt me. I’m okay.”
Then Potter was spinning him around and running a hand over his arse, and Draco moaned and pressed his cheek against the wood of the door and thrust his arse back, feeling Potter’s hard cock against the crease. He moved against it desperately. “Fuck me, Harry,” he whined.
Still. Lake water, blech.
I'd like to have the time I lost and give it back to you
She sat up. “Wha?” Her eyes were bleary, unfocused.
Draco pressed his head against Potter’s skin, then licked it, tasting the sweat on his tongue, then bit. Potter practically screamed. “I’m going to come, Fuck,
“’Mione,” Charlie said into her hair as his eyes lifted to meet Draco’s. They were not blue like Ron’s, but a warm shade of brown. She pulled back and Charlie stood and offered his hand. He was clad in a casual black button-up, sleeves rolled to the elbows to reveal his tattoos, which were incredibly colorful and detailed and gorgeous. The one on the left was a blue-skinned dragon, and the one on the right looked to be a golden snitch in a swirl of green leaves. Draco wondered if he had tattoos in other places.
Harry put a hand down to his balls and groaned as he stroked over them. “I – I don’t know. We haven’t talked.”
“Ron!” he called. “Mate!” but his voice was lost in the crowd. Ron was staring at the stage, looking as flabbergasted as Harry felt. Dean and Seamus weren’t around from the looks of it.
Draco pulled his tunic over his head. He could rinse it out while he was here; Merlin knew it could use a good cleaning. He had scrubbed his other tunic in the river a few days ago and he could wear that tomorrow while this dried. He stepped out of his boots and socks and trousers and picked up his socks to give them a rinse, too. He was still in his socks from home, and they had matching holes near the toes. He wondered if Laurel could mend them for him.
She nodded. "I might’ve been able to ward him off, if I’d tried. I was just so surprised. I shouldn’t have been, but I was. I didn't even call out for help.”
“I hope so,” he said, sounding a bit shy. And that was cute, too, that this uber-famous man was a bit flustered and shy. Humble, in a genuine way. Humph. Not good. “Astoria, this is my friend Sarah, from Chicago.” He pointed to a girl standing next to him with flaming red hair who could’ve been Ginevra Weasley with a few tweaks here and there.
“You’re…” his throat seemed to close up. “Be careful. You have to be careful.”
“You can order out if it’s too awful,” Harry said.
Harry took a sip of wine. “So. I've got one more issue to discuss with you before we become friends. It concerns that stuff you said, about pressuring me into doing things?”
“Harry, I’ll always come. You only need to ask.”
“You could. But I’d have your guts on the floor by then,” said Frankie easily, giving him a smile. “You willing to risk it? And this fellow with me is a Senweir, so you know he could do much worse.”
"Will do," said Potter.
“Yeah, I guess. What did you get?”
“You just have to believe me when I tell you that I love you. Because I do. And I’m…” he cleared his throat and looked like he was bracing himself for something. “I’m going to leave her. If we don’t win, I’ll leave her after the election. If we win, I’ll leave her after our first term and I won’t seek re-election.”
Into the flood
Draco went to slip his phone back into the pocket of his robes when it buzzed again. Harry’d texted one more time.
“Yes, obviously, but why?”
“Hello,” said Potter, looking up at them with interest.
Instead, Harry set about getting pissed once more, because why not. He played spin-the-bottle and snogged everyone from Luna to Hannah Abbot, who straddled his lap and got him uncomfortably hard, which was her way of announcing to the world that she was single, apparently. Ernie was seated next to Daphne, of course, and was looking at Hannah like maybe he’d dodged a bullet.
“So it really wasn’t you, at that club. It was Cassius.”
He made his way down the hallway, looking around, poking his head into one room that appeared to be a guest bedroom, then walked around a corner and threw another door open and saw that it was a study. Books lined the walls, and a fireplace crackled cheerily on one side. There was a desk and a chair, and a couple of armchairs in front of the fire, and it smelled of old, softened leather, and of ink and parchment and bergamot and sage.
“It was Draco, Professor,” Hermione said. “He was in here, and we realized he hadn’t heard the news about the troll, so we came to get him, and then, well.”
Harry was abuzz with good cheer and adrenaline for the rest of the day. He and Draco had a wonderful time over coffee, and he could’ve sworn there’d been some flirting. On his part, definitely. On Draco’s part, maybe. It was difficult to tell. But it seemed a bit like flirting.
“I don’t even mean the things I say, really. Or at least, I usually don’t. I just say them because I know they’ll…”
“Can we watch a movie?” Draco asked. He had his arms wrapped tightly around himself again, and his eyes were pleading.
“I don’t understand,” Draco said, his voice coming out hard as granite. “I
Draco laughed. This felt exactly like talking to a twenty-something Pansy; he supposed some things never changed. They set up the game on his bedroom floor after fighting over who got to be white (Pansy won, of course). Draco sprawled out on his side, head resting on his hand, and Pansy sat leaning against the foot of his bed.
Everyone went silent. Draco turned to look at Harry, who was staring resolutely at the ceiling. “What the fuck does that mean?” Draco asked.
Potter only laughed and whispered a lubrication spell that left Draco’s hole wet and slick. A moment later, the finger that had been teasing the tight rim was breaching it, slipping past it easily. “That’s my answer to that last remark of yours,” Potter said, grinning.
Draco rolled his eyes so hard they might’ve gone around twice. “
, that’s crazy.”
“Could I – would you lay here next to me for a while? Could I hold you?”
bed,” Weasley said, looking deeply uncomfortable.
“Why are you so agitated?” she asked, eying him. “You’re freaking me out.”
, so stop being weird about it.”
“When he first told me, I immediately assumed he was lying, but then he said something that made me second-guess myself.” Harry fiddled with his mug and took a deep breath. Fuck, he did not want to say this, did not want to have this conversation.
“They’re hard workers,” Draco said.
. You do understand that, don’t you?”
“I – no. I’m not. Just…you can’t do that, you know? Not just with Ron, but, like, generally. With married men.”
Malfoy shrugged, his gray eyes meeting Harry’s. Harry wanted to brush away the lock of hair that was falling in his eyes. “Just ask him if he wants to talk. He might not, just…you know, be there if he does.”
Once they had the wine, the conversation seemed to flow so easily that they forgot to figure out what to eat, and the waiter had to come back three times before they were ready to order.
Draco played with Harry’s fingers, tracing over them and into the crevices in-between. Harry still got a thrill from seeing their hands together, from the moments when Draco let himself be affectionate in front of everyone. It didn’t always happen, but when it did, it filled Harry with an absurd sort of happiness. “Not especially,” Draco said. “I was hoping we could be alone for a while.” He smirked over at Harry. “I know we’re sort of alone at night, but other people are in the room, you know, and I’d really like to be with you in
“He wasn’t my opponent back then,” Draco said. “We were still friendly at that point.”
no Harry.”
it and he’d scream Harry’s name over and over, and beg him to keep fucking him, and his pale limbs would be trembling and shaking and he’d be just begging for more. His nails would claw at Harry, and Harry would just keep fucking into him, thrusting hard as he could, maybe keeping a hand at his pale throat or pinning his hands over his head so that he couldn't move…
His name would mean nothing to them, so why not? “Draco,” he said. “And that’s Harry.”
He was gaunt, wasting. His arms, as he held them out in front of himself, were so thin that they hardly looked like his own, except that he knew they were because of the Dark Mark he saw there when he pulled back the sleeve of his robes.
The cat’s fur darkened until it was a smoky, stormy gray.
“Oh, god,” hissed Draco. “Yes, alright. Fine. Just…hurry.’
Harry’s brain short-circuited and his head was filled with a sort of white noise. This, perhaps, was what a panic attack felt like. Or a stroke. One of those.
“Cars,” Draco said.
“The whole time,” said Blaise, patting Harry’s shoulder. “Poor Harry.”
And then Potter was fucking tickling him – and it was quite brutal, the tickling – and Draco was squirming and giggling and trying to make himself into a tiny ball so that Potter couldn’t reach any of the most ticklish parts. “Cease and desist immediately!” he shrieked, turning his head towards Potter’s leg and biting down.
“Deal,” Sarah said.
Harry looked at him with some awful mixture of pity and disgust. “I don’t want to hear it. You have a week. You two have a week, to tell her.”
And, complicating matters further, there was the fact that this was
“Then why are you behaving so strangely?”
“My darling Pantalone,” Draco said, untangling himself from Niran momentarily to drape himself all over Pansy. “You are so worried, and there is no reason to be worried. We are here, with all our friends, with
“I won’t,” Draco said. No use getting the poor man’s hopes up.
“If they’re not fucking, I’d be
Harry snored. Loudly. He mumbled in his sleep, too, and writhed about in dramatic fashion, skinny limbs flying every which way. Sometimes he fell off the bed entirely, landing with a loud thwump, followed by a mumbled string of expletives. Draco had taken to chucking things at him when this happened.
He gathered Sen once more, letting it spread out to his hands and his face, and felt his bruises and cuts burn as they healed. The world spun in the aftermath of that, and he almost fell, but he managed to stay upright. He let himself lean against the cliff for a moment, willing the world to become still and steady. He might have fallen unconscious for a moment – he wasn’t quite sure – and then he began walking towards the path. He took it slow, stopping when he got dizzy, leaning against rocks.
involved. We’re just friends. I have no right to ask him. In fact, it would probably be inappropriate if I did.”
His legs were shaking as he fucked into his hand again, and Potter turned around once more and he could see the gorgeous curve of his arse in the moonlight, and he closed his eyes and imagined shoving Potter’s cheeks apart, rubbing his cock against Potter’s crease, imagined the press of muscled flesh enveloping him, and then he had to put his hand over his mouth to smother the sound that was bursting from his lips. “Fuck,” he whispered, focusing once more on the figure below him.
The mirror was a big hit altogether. Many of the soldiers had never seen their own reflection before, save in a pond or a lake. Draco watched as several at a time took in the picture of themselves, a look of wonder on their faces.
“Your younger brother? Where is he?” Alive, please let him still be alive, Draco thought, too late.
Harry felt his stomach clench. “If it made you uncomfortable, you should’ve told me. Merlin knows I never meant for it to.”
. Harry was keeping Stormy inside. “No more wandering for you, Stormy,” he whispered, petting her. Before bed, he threw the collar into the trash bin. Good riddance.
“Yeah, well, it wasn’t.”
“I don’t know what the hell to think about all this. I truly don’t. I find the whole situation generally repulsive, yes. I don’t know that means I’m repulsed by you, specifically, but…I don’t know. I just don’t know. I am finding it hard to understand how you could’ve ever done that.”
“Right,” she said, nodding. “Right.”
“What’s there to say? You’re married. You have a child. Finally knowing what happened all those years ago may have completely changed everything I thought about my life, but it doesn’t change those facts.”
He felt Draco nod against him.
“Like, the god?”
Then, suddenly, Potter’s eyes were opening, his lids still heavy with lust. Green eyes met Draco’s, and Draco realized he needed to sprint away in the opposite direction immediately if he didn’t want a hex flying at him.
“You ought to know who you’re dealing with. On the one hand you have Draco-vengeance-is-mine-Malfoy, and on the other you have Euripides-come-hell-or-highwater-Fastbrook. This date could be the result of either one of them scheming,” said Pansy.
“Why do you think Niall broke up with me?”
“Yes, you know, like, depressing but not exciting enough to be a raincloud. Just one of those dreary grey ones that absorbs all the sunlight but never actually creates precipitation.”
“He got you out of the fire, Daddy,” Scorpius said quietly to Draco.
Harry sank back onto his pillow and pressed his nose against Draco’s neck. “Want to buy some ear plugs for us tomorrow in Brasov?”
. Fuck, that is so hot. I’m going to have a good wank or two just imagining it.”
But the war had changed Lavender, like it had changed everyone. She was sharper, harder, less prone to giggling. She was a clever witch, really. She was no Hermione, of course, but she was good at putting the pieces together and their solve rate was quite high. And she was braver than he would have thought, although she had lived through an attack by Greyback, and that couldn’t have been easy.
They spent ten minutes on hip thrusts, which were mortifying and also fun, and then Harry’s time was up. He swiped his card again, another two-hundred pounds, for another half-hour stripping tutorial with Draco Malfoy. He thought he probably would’ve paid ten times that amount.
“Harry, look at me.”
broke up with
Draco refused to laugh. “I’m not ticklish,” he said, scowling.
She laughed her little tinkling laugh. “Oh, no doubt. God, I hope I don’t do that to Scorpius.”
Harry took his place next to Malfoy. “All good?” whispered Malfoy.
She sighed. “How are you, otherwise?”
Draco hadn’t noticed, but it made sense. The enemy’s victories were bad for morale. “Are you able to help me?” he asked, realizing that they’d gone on several tangents, none of which addressed the reason he was actually here. “Can you teach me how to create a Sacred Door?”
“With you?”
He knew Hermione was probably a little lonely. Sure, she was friends with Katie Bell and Luna and Ginny and some of the other girls, and sure, she was going out with Zabini next weekend. But she was used to having Ron to always visit and call whenever she felt like it, and Harry remembered how strange that had been, after Ginny, to not have that one person anymore. To not have someone you could always talk to, at any time, night or day. But Harry could be this for her, maybe, for a while. While she needed it. “We’re watching movies and then I’ll probably make dinner,” he said.
She breathed a sigh of relief. “It is. I agree. He’s so reckless sometimes.”
“I think I’m already dead,” Draco said. “I’m almost certain this is hell.”
The Ministry was dark and deserted, of course, seeing as it was the wee hours of Sunday morning. Draco wasn’t a stranger to coming in when it was quiet like this. Sometimes, he’d solve some work-related puzzle or another in the middle of the night (he didn’t sleep very soundly since the war) and instead of waiting until morning to check his theory, he’d throw on his robes and head in.
had an eye for the gents. And the ladies. And any combination of the two, really. I get around, Potter, or hadn’t you heard?”
“Not – not anything to do with you,” he said hesitantly.
He was shocked by her offer, but supposed she was curious, just as he was. The notion of portals was infinitely interesting, and it wasn't like the two of them were here in Mysteries at seven o'clock at night because they hated researching powerful and obscure magic. “Yes, that would be very helpful. Thank you.” He cleared his throat. “I’m going to get a curry from down the street and bring it back. From that place with the green awning and gold lettering. Would you like something?”
The story only got weirder from there. The stomach-daughter killed the rest of the wives to get revenge for the slaying of wife number seven, and then married Bowen herself, even though he was sort of her father. She also banished the sixteen sons to the four corners of March, four to each corner. The sons were angry at their banishment and at the killing of their own mothers, but they could do nothing, because Bowen would only listen to the stomach-daughter. Since the sons had no way to act on their anger, their hearts turned to stone, and once their hearts turned, so did their bodies and eventually, they became mountains. And that was where March’s four mountain ranges – the Etherean Mountains, the White Mountains, the Bloody Hills, and the Horn Mountains, one in every corner of the continent - supposedly came from.
He shrugged. “Theo was cagey about it. Didn’t want to be seen as gay, you know. I tried to respect that.”
He thought of how it was strange that they were being so quiet, because usually he and Ron never ran out of things to say to each other, but at the moment, everything was hushed. It was almost making Harry nervous. He'd always talked and laughed through sex with Ginny, and Seamus, the two times they'd messed around, had made a running commentary about what they were doing, which had served as an odd sort of dirty-talk. Even Cian had been fun, and they'd joked around during their one-time adventure.
“Yes, indeed,” said Alexander, nodding to one of the older men in the long togas.
She smiled a little. “I don’t know. He was very sweet, actually. I was surprised. He was…a gentleman. We didn’t…you know.” She got pink again. “He wants to take me out next weekend. To dinner.”
“You were just going to keep talking,” Draco said, wide-eyed. “Like, forever.”
“Good point,” said Harry, hurrying to catch up.
“Oh, never mind! I take it back. You’re as big of a git as I always thought you were,” Pansy said, prompting Harry to throw a pillow at her.
They stayed there together in the kitchen for a long time, probably too long, given that everybody else was outside waiting for them. Finally, Draco pulled away and wiped at his eyes. “So, shall we go tell everyone?” he asked, taking Harry’s hand.
Draco sat up straight, moving his hands away quickly, and felt himself turning very, very red.
Malfoy sounded close. The blanket was moving faster, his breaths faster, his moans a tiny bit louder. “Oh, fuck,” Harry heard him whisper, and then he made a little hitching cry, soft and almost pretty. Harry watched as he arched his body up off the bed a little, his free hand clutching at the pillow beneath his head. Harry closed his eyes tight then.
I've grown so close to you
. I believe in the things I believe in because of
. It’s only…well. I like to dance, sure. I’m having fun. But I’d rather just hang out with you. So if you don’t feel like dancing anymore, we can go. We should go.”
Let me spin and excite you
“I’m not overweight!” Lawrence exclaimed, offended.
But he’d never told her about Potter. He’d never told
“I’m not sure.
She managed to sprawl backwards as a unicorn’s hind quarters came careening towards her. The unicorn drew up onto its back legs and so did the karkadan it was facing, and the two creatures kicked at each other, striking out with their powerful legs and hard hooves. The karkadan flew onto it’s back, crying out, and struggled back to its feet, cowed, now, slinking away with the unicorn’s horn at its throat.
Potter glared.
Draco got up out of bed and pulled on a pair of pajama trousers. “What are you doing?” asked Potter, sort of turning away at the sight of Draco in his pants, but sort of not, his eyes flickering down the length of Draco’s body. Hm, interesting. Draco wasn’t sure what that meant, exactly, but he filed it away in his head anyway.
“He talks to other girls, but that’s it. He’s loyal,” said Harry.
“You – um.” Harry ran a hand through his hair. “Oh, Circe. But why…why didn’t
Over the next two days, Draco began to feel like the kiss they’d shared was a figment of his imagination. Particularly since the entirety of it was playing out in his head on an ongoing basis. He’d taken the memory out and looked at it so many times that it had begun to take on a fantastic sort of glimmer, all the rough edges smoothed away, all the romance and drama heightened. He had to force himself to stop and remember how Harry’d thought Draco was being a dick to him at first, how Draco’s hands had been shaking, how he’d almost fainted at the end. Those parts of it kept it feeling
“Excellent,” said William. “Let’s be off then. I’d like to make it to Finlay by sundown.”
“Oh,” said Harry.  It wasn’t that he didn’t want to, because he did, because apparently Harry was a fickle bitch, but he didn’t want to do anything to mess things up with Draco.
,” Ron hissed. “She’s my fucking sister, Harry, I don’t want her hurt.” He took a deep breath. “But I knew as soon as you started up again with her that it wasn’t going to work. I’m not an idiot.”
?” asked Potter. “What were those things? What happened?”
He’d never met a girl so forward, so blatant about what she wanted. Who wore her promiscuity like a badge of honor instead of treating it like a dirty secret. It was slightly terrifying but also thrilling. And more than a little sexy. And really, people shouldn’t be afraid of admitting they liked sex. It was stupid to pretend otherwise. Harry was very guilty of that, of pretending like he didn’t have feelings that were, now that he thought about it, perfectly natural.
at some point between talking to Draco and the alley. Draco knew there were muggle drugs that predators slipped people at clubs, drugs that made them susceptible. Maybe that bloke on his knees had slipped something into Potter’s drink.
“Oh, I am well aware of Ron’s snooze habits,” Potter said. “One of the few good things about not rooming with him this year. Seriously, though. Thank you. It was – nice. Talking to you.”
“What?” asked Draco, confused and thrown.
Harry blushed twice, once for the word ‘loverboy’ and once for the idea that Euri was running around shopping for him. “No,” Harry said, trying to make it sound stern.
“Thanks,” said Harry, touching his lip carefully. “And I know you could’ve handled that on your own. I’m sorry, okay? It was none of my business, like usual.”
by Stephen King.
“Right?” Harry asked. “I kind of like her.”
“Probably the same reason you did,” Potter said.
Sarah snickered. “Probably not conducive to being fucked with my enormous strap-on, either, huh?” she said.
“That was a lie, of course. I needed you to laugh,” Draco said.
He knew how much Harry worried about being hurt by whatever this was. By this…
Harry felt anxious with Corner there anyway. He found himself itching for a cigarette, although he was trying to resist the urge. He sat back in his chair and forced his body to relax, hoping his mind would follow as Corner prattled on about some sort of television show about wizards that he was watching ironically, or something.
“Is there harm in trying? Certainly not,” Laurel said.
He pictured Harry, suddenly, the way he’d looked when Hermione and Ron and Draco came into the room. He’d been terrifying, frankly, almost in some sort of trance, hitting Blaise like that, over and over. And it wasn’t like Draco had enjoyed seeing Blaise in pain – he hadn’t.
“One, he does. Two, grow a pair! Stop being afraid of everything! Live a little, Draco, damn it!”
“Shut up! What?” Potter scrambled to a sitting position and looked around. “Oh, shit,” he said.
a big deal.”
“Come on, Potter. I’ll make you some tea.”
“No, it’s not that,” said Draco. And it wasn’t really. He wasn’t mad about that. It was more what it made him realize. “It’s that I don’t want a secret relationship. I want a real one.”
William looked relieved at that. “Which companies?”
“Swimming,” muttered Potter, lifting his head for a moment before letting it drop back down onto the dock with a thump.
And then they were in Harry’s bed, mercifully un-splinched, and Harry was all over him and in him and everything was heat and green eyes and smooth skin and Harry and Harry and Harry.
Harry was dating hot-as-fuck Cassius Warrington, Draco’s childhood crush. Cassius, who Harry thought was fit. Draco understood, suddenly, why Harry had almost beat the shit out of him in the toilet at the pub. Because Draco firstly wanted to beat the shit out of Cassius, but had no real reason to, considering he hadn’t talked to the prat in years. But secondly, he wanted to beat the shit out of Harry, and Harry was here, and available, and Draco’s fists
when he was up there shaking his arse.
“Your father has been my lost loyal servant. You are lucky in that regard. Because of it, I have decided that your punishment will be merciful. Instead of killing you, you’ll only need to watch while I kill Harry Potter. It seems fitting, does it not? For you to lose the thing that made you betray me?”
The moment Draco surfaced, he knew
“Hello Mr. Potter. Mr. Malfoy,” said Burgot, looking suspicious.
“I came to see
, not the point. The point is that I think I’m starting to feel more than that. Squishy. Warm and fuzzy. Stupid. All that stuff.”
“Trusting is hard. Knowing who to trust, even harder.”
Draco, fighting back tears and trying not to look at his father sprawled out on the floor, convulsing and half-conscious, would report on the location of the vanishing cabinet in the castle and gave updates on Dumbledore’s and Potter’s whereabouts.  After that, they would arrange to have Aunt Bella attempt an entry into Hogwarts the following week, an attempt that would fail (They’d try again, though, a fortnight later, and that time, it wouldn’t fail.).
“No, of course you’re not,” Harry said, taking his hand and kissing it. “But now that I’m thinking on it, you shouldn’t be able to bet on the ruination of your own marriage since you have so much influence over whether it ends.”
If I can't have you, I don't want no one
Their legacy's too hard to take
“I would say I was the least culpable one just now!” he protested.
Harry gripped Corner’s hips and lowered his mouth over the tip, circling his tongue around it. Then he plunged lower, almost to the base, and pulled back. Corner let out a low moan.
Harry sighed. “Okay, what about ‘Potter-Malfoy’?”
“Isn’t,” Harry said softly, and his body felt tightly wound, suddenly, so very different from the loose, sleepy way it had felt a moment before.
, aren’t I?”
Potter nodded, and something in his jaw tensed. He looked tired, Draco realized. Still obnoxiously attractive, but there was a hollow look to his eyes, exhaustion written into the lines of his body. “Maybe you ought to go home and sleep instead of wasting your time here, Potter,” Draco said.
I'm still tasting you
“Show me,” Draco said to him.
“But that’s just it, Harry! It felt like you hardly even loved me anymore - you just
you that? Why did he never tell me that? He really said that?”
“Draco,” said Hermione in a stern tone. “You’re never going to love him the way you love Harry. Admit it.”
“Shhh, don’t look,” Draco said in his ear. He petted Harry’s hair, and felt Harry start to shake against him.
Harry chucked the roll of parchment at Draco’s face, followed by the quill. “Come on. If I sit here any longer I’m going to lose my mind.”
“Well, you’re a very sexy plum,” Pansy said. “I mean, fuck’s sake. Too bad you’re bent.”
“I don’t know,” Ilana said. “That part isn’t yet written. Perhaps.”
Frankie shook her head. “He made an exception for her. It’s…complicated. Not my place to discuss it.”
“Go talk to him, maybe,” whispered Malfoy. “Seamus isn’t going to, I guarantee it.”
But that hadn’t been real. It had been the fairy tears. It hadn’t meant a thing.
Harry nodded, his green eyes so bright without the glasses, even in the moonlight. “Draco, I want –” He stopped, thinking. “I need –” He stopped again, and pressed his forehead to Draco’s, just looking at him.
of those best days on Ernie, that
Draco didn’t know if he was setting himself up to fail, but he picked up speed, pulling ahead of Harry on the track. “Bet I can beat you,” he called, looking over his shoulder.
Harry wasn’t laughing, though. It was oddly cute, the thought of Draco running. Draco asked him if he ever exercised. Harry had, on occasion, tried to lift a weight or two – Ron had a set in his room at the Burrow – but he’d never stuck to anything. Last summer, Ginny’d talked him into running with her a little, but truthfully, he’d hated it. “Ran once in a while last summer,” he said.
“Like a Catholic priest?” Harry asked. It seemed like superstitious nonsense, what a priest was likely to do.
“So, what if we plan to get together next Saturday night?” Harry asked. “We take the week, give everything some thought, and then you can have Pansy stay with Scorpius Saturday night, if she’s willing, and you can come 'round to mine and we can talk.”
again?”
He disappeared for a moment, then came back with two whiskeys. He put the one on the rocks in front of Draco. “Chilling it dampens the flavor and aroma, you know. You should try it neat, sometime, if you like whiskey.”
The dark-haired man gives the blonde man a look. “Piss poor joke. Honestly,” he says. “Anyone in particular you were wondering about?” he asks the man in the audience.
“Right, sorry. I just got distracted.” He hung his head.
I see angels and devils
“It’s a good feeling, yeah? Being liked.”
“Yeah, but we didn’t do it or anything,” said Ron.
Blaise and Daphne arrived late, moaning about how their babysitter had gotten tied up. Daphne looked beautiful as always (Daph was, sometimes, even prettier than Astoria, but with Daph, for some reason, Astoria had never minded) and Blaise looked quite well, if a bit stiff.
(Light on, light on, light on)
You realize, then, that you didn’t really have a question, that you’re just talking and talking without thinking, like usual. But maybe you can make one up.
“What the hell?” Harry asked. “You went through the same war I did. Why wasn’t that too close to home for you?”
“Yeah, I think…it’s probably complicated. But Draco considers himself to be gay,” he said.
It didn’t make her as happy as she would have thought.
Sarah rolled her eyes. “Fine. You dated forever ago; you don’t have to keep bringing it up, god.”
“Harry, we literally just started dating two days ago.”
“You’re only proving my point, Harry,” said Pansy. “You boys have, well…help me out, Daph.”
She sighed and poured more tea. “Draco, your logic is quite flawed.”
Harry waited with bated breath as Daphne drooped towards Blaise like a wilting flower, and he put his arms around her, and then, after a moment, kissed her so softly and tenderly Harry had to look away. "Come back to us, love," he said. "Please."
Harry, Draco, and Charlie settle into a routine, but it isn't quite working.
Potter very audibly gasped, then went entirely still.
Draco nodded. “I also have a few memories I keep up in the attic. Of us.”
Draco, once again, curled up behind Harry after they were done, his arms wrapped tightly around Harry’s chest, his breath tickling the nape of Harry’s neck, until Harry drifted off to sleep.
“God, you’re –” Potter said, lining himself up.
so good, that perhaps the universe was stepping in to show Draco that he didn’t deserve him. That he would never deserve him.
“When Bellatrix…” said Hermione, gesturing vaguely to her arm. “I wasn’t paying attention to him, obviously, but Bellatrix paused with me to make fun of him for it.”
People were mostly paired off now, having found their match. There were a few partner games that he and Potter were going to have to facilitate in a minute, although there was no reason why they couldn’t also compete. “You want to pair up with me for this part?” asked Draco. “I think we could probably clean up in some of the games.”
He felt Draco’s hands on his, and let him pull them away from his face, and then Draco’s fingertips cupped his chin, tilting his face up slightly.  “I want you to keep touching yourself,” Draco said softly.  “Let me see.”
She shook her head, her dark hair flying. “Absolutely not,” she said. “Didn’t believe it.”
The next Tuesday, Draco ran to catch a lift that was about to close, only to find Harry already on it. He considered running away. Instead, he steeled himself and got in.
Harry stood beside the table, his eyes on Draco. His gaze flickered across Draco’s face like he was searching for something there, and Draco’s breath caught in his throat. Harry seemed especially beautiful then, in his well-cut suit, with his bright eyes and his broad shoulders and his ridiculous hair. He seemed so beautiful, suddenly, that Draco almost couldn’t stand to look at him.
things, anyway.”
turned into a bit of a whore.
“Erm, yeah, hi. I’m Harry,” Harry stuck out his hand and the woman shook it gently.
“Yeah,” he said. “What...?”
“Not a date, Pansy.”
“I think so, yeah.”
“It’s nothing,” said William, and then returned to his place across the fire, where he looked out at the trees, keeping watch.
“I see,’ said Harry. He looked a little uncomfortable, like he wasn’t sure what to do with his body.
He didn’t want to fall in love with Charlie Weasley. He found himself stupidly, uselessly, clinging to memories of Harry that weren’t even real here in this timeline. Memories of a Harry who was entirely unlike the one Draco had spoken to tonight.
Harry blinked. “Well, that’s mad. I don’t even live there.”
Draco slipped out of bed and grabbed the napkin from his wallet and entered Evan’s number on his phone.
“I…well, yes, I’d fucking care! I’d be furious.”
He pulled Ron towards the loo, kissing him all the while, and when were inside, he apparated them to his house.
He managed to fall into a restless, agitated sleep, and woke early, while Astoria was still breathing deeply and evenly beside him. He slipped into the shower and got ready quietly, and left for Woad Hall without waking her.
Goddamnit.
Pansy huffed with irritation, which was ridiculous, because Pansy had no idea what she was talking about when it came to Quidditch, having decided early on to despise it and the way it distracted her various romantic partners.
“I hope they’re not serving rodents for supper,” he said.
“Yeah. Yeah, I’m fine.”
Give me both your hands
Sarah nodded fervently. “And why not? I’m adorable.”
“And Draco has a hard time letting go of things,” Daphne said. She took a sip of her fruit bowl drink. “That’s the understatement of the century, actually. He
“I’m serious,” he said.
Draco frowned. “Um, no.”
He shrugged. “Nothing in my life turned out the way I’d expected. And that’s largely my fault.”
He understood everything she was saying. He had certainly believed in their story for a long time, considered it the perfect ending to everything he’d gone through. It hurt to let go of it completely, to give it up for good. He was closing a door forever, he knew it, and it was always difficult to close a door, to make a choice.
“I don’t,” Draco said vehemently. “I know you’re only human, William.”
Harry nodded, and then, for the first time in a long time, saw Grimmauld Place through the eyes of a newcomer. It was rather terrible, if you weren’t used to it. “Yeah. Haven’t done much to fix it up.”
“I think I might already know the way to his heart,” Ginny said, smiling a little mischievously. “I ran into him at the underground track, and we talked a little.”
In case you think Harry's suit sounds insane, I got inspiration from this picture: https://i1.wp.com/www.lanieri.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Abito-in-lino-per-il-tempo-libero.jpg?ssl=1
“Come on, you stubborn arse. You’ll be sore as hell if you sleep on this stone floor.”
She flinched, a little, at that. It didn't deter her from arguing the point, though. Ginny was a stubborn one. “I didn’t break up with you because I didn’t care about you. I still loved you. I just needed some distance. Things weren’t easy, with us. You must understand that, surely.”
“Oh, right,” said Malfoy, looking distinctly uncomfortable. “I was sorry to hear about that.”
. They might like you, or they might just think you have a nice arse. Hell, they might just be bored. And even if they start fucking you regularly, you still don’t know. And they never bloody talk about it, either. If you want to have a conversation about what’s going on, you have to bring it up. And half of them are completely afraid of commitment.”
Malfoy was, after all, the boy who had stomped on his nose. That bore thinking about. But then again, Malfoy was also the boy he’d made bleed in the bathroom, to such an extent that Myrtle had shrieked about a murder. That was worse than a nose stomp. Although, to be fair, Harry hadn’t known what the curse would do, and he was fairly confident that Malfoy had known exactly what kicking Harry's face in would do. But, that was in the past. Everything was different now -- Harry was different and Malfoy was different, too. The war had made everything shift, a little. Harry often thought about the negative things -- the losses, the scars. But maybe there were some good changes, too. Maybe it had forced them all to reevaluate their beliefs and their priorities. Maybe it had forced them to grow up.
!” cried Draco, throwing himself into her arms.
He didn’t remember falling asleep, but he must’ve. When he woke up, it was still dark. He bolted upright and looked at Potter beside him, snoring softly. He should go back to his room, he realized. If he left now, he’d avoid all the inevitably awkward encounters that would come with the morning.
Draco eyed Harry. “Do you own anything besides shorts and t-shirts?”
it was cold out here.
Millie took a deep breath. “Theo,” she said. Everyone erupted into cheers and giggles and Draco watched, amused, as Theo looked down at the floor, seeming pleased.
Harry didn’t seem to hear him at first, but then what Draco said seemed to register, and Harry looked at him sharply.
“What –” Harry said, looking absolutely shocked. “What does this – um.”
Edwin glared but backed away. “Stay away from him.”
“Euri floo-called me tonight,” he said instead. No use putting it off.
“You look like you’re in a good mood,” Ginny said, smiling.
and Harry found his hands tied up over his head with some silky material that was attached to the headboard. The knots were loose, so he could probably get out of it easily enough, although he had no intention of trying. He very much wanted to see how this played out.
Malfoy smiled tiredly. “It won’t happen, I’m telling you, Potter.” His eyes skimmed down Harry’s chest. “I like your jumper, by the way,” he said.
Pansy had mixed feelings about Ari. She desperately wanted to hate him, but he was cute as a fucking button and also too fun to hate. He liked Harry a lot, too, and it was hard to fault him for that. As for what Harry felt, Pansy couldn’t begin to guess. He let Ari hold his hand, hug him, throw an arm around him. But there was something in the way he held himself, something that was different from how he’d been with Draco. He was a little stiffer, maybe. Not as affectionate.
They looked through the kitchen, which had been dramatically overhauled and modernized, and walked through the wine cellar, which had not revealed itself to the previous owners and was still fully stocked, They made their way through the parlor and the dining room and the downstairs powder room and the study. The looked at the library and saw that it had gotten a makeover, too, new lights and  refinished wood floors and bookshelves painted white. And, also helpful, all the books on dark magic were gone. They toured the rest of the second floor and then the third, and Harry saw that two of the smaller bedrooms had been combined to make a master, and it had a gorgeous master bath attached.
Draco tried to digest it all. “Thank you. But, well, look. I wasn’t that boy because we were
“Well, they might free me if they can’t sell me,” Potter retorted at one point. "And you'll still be stuck."
“Ernie and Michael,” said Harry. “They’re fine. Nice, I guess. Michael’s a bit quiet.”
Everyone said aye.
“Oh? What did you want to talk to me about then?” he asked. “Touch your bollocks, by the way. Gently.”
And then they were on a beach, and it was time.
Draco grinned despite himself. “So thoughtful.”
“Not – I didn’t mean that you’re in love with me! Sweet Salazar, I’m not an idiot.”
“I also feel like
“Thank you,” Harry said, and after a moment they stepped back and looked towards Hermione. Draco was perfectly still, watching, and trying to catch his breath, which seemed uneven and too loud.
He looked at the clock on the wall. It was only ten. He could go talk to Draco. He would ask calmly, rationally. He would tell Draco that he hadn’t believed it at all until Euri said the thing about the flowers, and that had thrown Harry. But he would tell him he
“You’re not having nearly as much fun as you ought to be having. This is a really good party.”
Linda loved her husband with all her heart, but he sometimes got stupid ideas in his head and, unfortunately for her, had enough money to turn them into a reality. A few years ago, it was the farmhouse and orchard he bought up in Michigan. It would be fun, he said, to be in the Midwest in the fall, to watch all the leaves turn, to eat apples off their own trees, to press fresh cider in the barn. Linda knew it would not be fun, but Greg dragged her up there anyway, and she spent a month with mosquito bites everywhere, swimming in the late summer humidity. Linda was stung by bees constantly (apparently, they really liked apple trees, and she tended to forget to look where she was stepping), and also got a mean case of poison ivy. By the time she flew home (six weeks before Greg flew home), she’d just about had it with Greg’s hairbrained schemes.
Harry regretted texting him at all.
Harry didn’t want to start something up with Charlie, though. He didn’t want to start something with anyone, because ever since the text exchange with Draco, he felt like he was in a holding pattern. He tried to tell himself that it didn’t mean anything, except that maybe they might be able to be friends again. But his heart didn’t believe that at all, and he found himself thinking of Draco all the time, especially in the shower, which was the only time he was ever alone in the tiny cottage.
Harry had a pretty serious concussion, but it seemed hardly worth the trouble at St. Mungo’s, considering everything else that was happening. Pansy’s partner, Sam, had questioned Harry briefly at his bedside, then left him alone in the dim room. They’d healed his head, but were also keeping him overnight for observation, letting him recover in the dark and quiet, telling him to keep his head still and to stay in a reclining position.
“Uh, Draco,” Seamus said. “When are you working?”
"Yeah, well. Everyone else didn't spend six years of school, not to mention the last six Fridays, watching you."
“That’s not why I slept with you," Harry said emphatically.
Draco dragged himself the last two or three feet, and without hesitating, jumped into the freezing water.
On Tuesday, Lavender was being normal again, so they went out to the pub, and met up with Blaise and Parvati. No Michael Corner this time, thank goodness. Harry had one glass of whiskey and then another and another, and finally flooed home pretty well pissed. He looked around at the silent, gaping chasm of his front hall and forced himself to walk through it and to his bedroom. All around him were dark corners, and in his head, the thing could be in any one of them. All of them. How was he to know? He could feel it watching, waiting.
Harry led them all inside, and watched as Scorpius looked around wide-eyed. “I like your house, Mr. Potter,” he said. “You
“You’re talking an awful lot about Harry today,” Ginny said, and Draco kept his head down, not wanting her to see the expression on his face. “How come?”
Potter seemed to enjoy it, too. As much as he kicked and glared and pinched, he also smiled, and that was nice. Potter’s smile was an incentive in and of itself to continue misbehaving.
He was such a bloody idiot. It just figured that he had ruined whatever was blossoming between Malfoy and him without even realizing it.
Harry told him and he was off and running, coming back with two different brown pairs. One looked shiny and new, the other looked like they’d been through a war. Harry liked the latter. The boots were big and clunky, but he liked the look of them, liked how, like the jacket, they didn’t look fresh off the shelf. They looked already lived in, in a wonderful way.
Not knowing what to do, exactly, he bowed. “Yes, Your Majesty,” he said, and she looked pleased by that, her little face relaxing a little.
“It’s true,” Harry said. “I’m saying it because it’s true.”
He blinked back into view.
Harry laughed and moved over to Draco’s bed, sitting beside him. Draco looked at him, so close that Draco could see his individual eyelashes, dark and long and lovely. Harry leaned closer.
Harry nodded. “But you don’t feel that way now.”
He felt like he was mourning them both – mourning the loss of Sarah, because if –
Harry feels stuck, and the Eighth Years discuss Easter hols
Harry snorted. “Right, you looked really scared, Malfoy. Look, it’s – whatever. I’m not your bloody boyfriend. You don’t owe me anything. We fucked around a few times, big deal. You’re allowed to do what you want.”
, he amended.
“Nay.”
your conclusion? Last night was...and you still  - you're
and glared at them as they went up in flames and disappeared with a flash of heat, leaving scorch marks on the desk.
Malfoy looked back up. “Double negatives, Harry? Come now.” He smirked. “So you’re saying I
“Work hard to improve muggle-wizard relations. Possibly expand the number of liaisons on both sides. Provide information about the magical world to a greater number of high-ranking muggle officials.” Draco sucked his lower lip between his teeth, looking thoughtful, and Harry felt a terrible urge to reach out and touch his mouth, to see if it felt as soft as it used to. Draco’s lips were adorably asymmetrical, the lower one full and the upper one rather thin. It made him look like he was pouting, and Harry’d always found that ridiculously attractive.
“I could’ve said no. I could’ve, and I didn’t. I let this happen, and it hurt you, and I’m sorry.”
Harry laughed. “Take it, you tosser.”
We got it wrong
Pansy grinned. “I know, right? They’re Astoria’s parents.” She wrote the names down.
Malfoy laughed and looked somewhat mollified. “Don’t tell them that, for Salazar’s sake.”
. How can I be jealous when I’m going to be there?”
Harry snorted. “Yeah, real smooth, Malfoy.”
“Your, um. Wait. What?”
“Well, yeah, but no. That’s not what I mean. I mean that I’d want us to be together.”
Draco and Harry in the aftermath of gettin' hitched
“Oh, okay,” said Greg, looking down.
The place was not totally devoid of hen parties, and Ron quickly moved towards one such group and bestowed a broad smile upon them and started talking to a couple of the girls.
“Me?” Harry laughed. “I wasn’t the one draping myself all over the wall and biting my fucking lip,
“Fucking liar,” Pansy said gleefully. Then she clapped. “Oh, I just
“Ron,” Harry said, frowning.
She laughed, and her pale eyes rolled around in her head. “A wizard? I’d have thought you learned your lesson after the last time.”
“Yes, I do believe it’s the first. Unless you count the time you refused to shake my hand on the train, or that detention in the Forbidden Forest.”
Draco shook his head. “God, Harry, I’m not even shagging her anymore. We don't sleep together. We don't touch at all, except when we're in public and it seems like we should, just to keep up appearances.”
Blaise looked at him with his brow furrowed. “Tell me this isn’t because I was
All my favorite songs are slow and sad
“Albus,” Harry warned. He looked back at Scorpius. “We have to take you back, Scorpius. I bet Pansy’s worried sick.” The last thing Harry needed was Malfoy hunting down his son and then claiming Harry’d kidnapped him or some such thing.
Draco sighed. “I’ve hardly forgotten. I simply don’t believe it to be as important as I once did.”
She sighed. “You’re welcome, of course. And I love you, too, Harry. I’ll always love you. You’re – well, you’re part of me.”
“You’re here because you’re the best at planning parties,” said Pansy, nudging him with her shoulder. Harry thought about the fact that she and Malfoy had dated. He wondered what that had entailed, and then hated himself for wondering. “And because you lend a certain animal magnetism to the whole affair that’s bound to get people interested.”
Draco stared at them, his brain scurrying around for an explanation, his heartbeat picking up until it felt like it was about to thump right out of his chest. William recovered from the shock first and stood, making his way down the steps that led to the dais, his gilded crown winking in the rainbow of sunlight that filtered in through stained glass. He cut an impressive figure in his fine robes and his crown, his golden hair shining around his broad shoulders. He’d looked like a hero when Draco and Harry had first met him; now he looked like a king. He passed by Hermione and went to stand before Harry for a moment, and then embraced him. “Welcome back,” he said.
Harry felt a shock of relief run through him. “Yeah, that sounds good. Want to come get me when you’re heading down?”
“I just
“How are you feeling, darling?” asked Pansy.
Draco laughed harder. “Is this your impression of dancing? Is that what this is?”
. Two, I finally understand you. Three, I met the fucking love of my life and she’s a goddamned witch and
Draco looked at Potter and Potter shrugged. Draco didn’t get a bad feeling from the girl, but it was too strange, her being all alone here, knowing they were coming, making them food. “Will you eat first?” Draco said.
“What if I’d handled it like that? What if I’d just let her bury herself in those projects, and been patient, and taken time to be with her in between? Why did I never think of that?”
, exactly, then something close to it. She began to come round to his on Saturday afternoons when they were trying to crack open some particularly challenging piece of magic, and then a few months into that, she’d invited him and Luna to dinner at the house she shared with Weasley. It had happened a good number of times since then, too. Those dinners were occasionally peppered with tension, because Weasley was still a prick sometimes. Other times, though, they were fine. Pleasant, even. Draco could talk to Hermione forever, and counted Luna as a dear friend.
“We were engaged twice,” she said, thinking. “The first time we were engaged for six days and then you broke it off. Then you asked me marry you again soon afterward. That time, we were engaged for eleven months before we were married.”
hex? Maybe a bat bogey?”
“What about this?” Euri asked, holding up something that had Harry immediately flinching. It was a suit that Ginny had gotten him two or three years ago, when she’d gone through a phase of excessive shopping to deal with the breakdown of their marriage. It was a linen suit in a shade that was almost burgundy but perhaps a bit brighter and more purple, cut to fit closer than most of Harry’s clothes, and even looking at it made him feel uncomfortable.
“So,” he said as they sat. “You have a good Christmas?”
It didn’t feel like just lunch.
She nodded seriously, like he hadn’t just mumbled his way though a non-answer. “I’m sure they’re thrilled by the prospect of taking you on. Robards in particular seems to be a fan of yours.”
“I think it’s too close to home. They’ve known each other for so long. It would be a bit…incest-y.”
“Kayli?” came a voice, and then another person came down the stairs, also stopping at the bottom. A person who wasn’t Potter.
Astoria laughed, too, and it was fake. “Did you want something to drink, Pans?”
Draco walked over to her and put his hands on her rosy cheeks and kissed her nose and then just stared at her, taking in how happy and healthy and whole she looked.
He didn’t know who to talk to, either. Neither Ron nor Hermione would really understand, and besides, Harry didn’t feel comfortable telling them about Blaise. Padma needed to know, but nobody else did. And it wasn’t Harry’s place to tell them.
Al brightened and hugged him back. “Yeah, me too. Plus your house is wicked. I’ve never seen anything so big outside of Parliament.”
Ron looked at Harry and shrugged. “Sure. Why not,” he said, opening his mouth. Harry saw that the thing was bright yellow. Ron swallowed it down.
“So, with regard to Friday,” Potter said once their food had been dropped off. “I remember talking to you at the bar, very clearly. Then I remember having another drink, and then chatting with another bloke, a guy with blond hair. I can remember all of that perfectly. We danced a bit, and I remember that, too, and then…” He was clacking his fingers against the table restlessly. “Then the next thing I knew, I was walking down a dark street by myself.”
On his other side, Harry reached over and squeezed his hand and Draco squeezed back.
Then it faded, leaving her exhausted and aching. She preferred the anger, but it was so difficult to hang on to it for long.
like him.”
“What did you mean when you said I am of the blood?”
“Draco, come on –”
Draco does a stupid thing, then he assumes a stupid thing
“What the
She sat at her desk, pulling off her plum robes with the scale of justice embroidered in gold over the breast, and brought her hands to her lap, eying him. “Is everything alright?” she asked, her brown eyes flickering over his face curiously.
“You’re an arsehole,” he said to his reflection. “On top of being a coward, you’re a fucking arsehole.” His reflection scowled back at him.
Draco laughed and shook his head.
“No,” he said. “Not really.”
“Oh, relax,” Draco said, patting his shoulder. “Hold still.” Potter stilled and Draco subtly flicked his wand at Potter under the bar and made his jeans and his top a teensy bit tighter. “There.”
how much mead you had or whether you’re sicking up all over yourself, and yes, Pike, I’m talking to you.”
“That’s terrifying,” Harry said, grinning. He could picture it, the two of them glad-handing and asking after one another’s children while plotting each other’s demise.
“But I don’t recall ever feeling this at home. I’m sensitive to this sort of thing because of my job.” And that was true – he had attuned himself to the feel of different sorts of magic.
A trip to Malfoy Manor isn't exactly what Harry expected.
“Come here,” Draco said, and Harry leaned over, finding his mouth for a moment. Harry began to move faster then, his hands on either side of Draco’s head, his forehead resting on Draco’s.
As he finished the final word, he felt the magic hit him, felt the sting of the hex.
“No,” Draco rasped. His voice sounded like it had been destroyed along with the rest of him.
They had another glass of whiskey in the sitting room, talking about what they ought to research, exactly, trying to brainstorm, and then Draco found himself yawning. He cast a
Lia nodded. “She's being tended to by Laurel,” she said.
Cassius chuckled. “Who’s your friend?”
Draco sighed and stood up from his bed to sit next to Blaise. He looked at him, wondering what kind of conversation this was going to be. Would Blaise be providing explanations? Would he lecture or interrogate Draco about Harry? It could be anything.
“They wouldn’t have. I thought…I thought I must’ve been wrong. Because it seemed like there was something there, between us. It felt that way, a bit, in the hallway. But when I didn’t hear from you, I decided you must’ve only pitied me, and then I read that you married Ginevra. I was angry. I kept thinking…well, you knew I was alone. You knew how much my mother meant to me. But you never even checked to see–”
it was important for Scorpius to have his undivided attention on a regular basis.
“What, you’re going to finger me to death? What a way to go,” Draco said around a moan as Potter curled his fingers up so they brushed up against the wickedly sensitive spot there. “Oh, fuck.”
“Oh my god, your face. You look like you want to punch me upside the head!”
“You too,” Draco murmured, putting his arms around Harry.
Draco and Harry's last year at Hogwarts comes to a close
Then I'll keep coming back
“Darling!” came Pansy’s voice, and Draco could’ve cried in relief. “There you are.” She looked at him. “Are you okay?” she leaned in. “You look a bit peaked.”
Draco blinked at it for a moment, shocked, and then it opened, and Hermione Granger stepped out, in her Department of Mysteries robes, looking absolutely thrilled. A moment later, Harry followed in his Auror uniform, his green eyes shifting immediately to Draco’s. “Hello,” he said.
Mostly certain, anyway.
“Well…I’ve had a lot of time to think about it since then.”
Potter took it and frowned. “I was working on some spells while you were asleep. I can’t do anything. Nothing works.”
“Yes, please,” he said, taking the cup she offered and sipping. It was just how he liked it, sweetened with loads of cream instead of sugar.
Harry shouldn’t have typed that last part. He really shouldn’t have. But it had been sent and he couldn’t take it back.
At the center of the rampart, Berold let out a piercing whistle – short, short, long. An echoing whistle came from off in the darkness.
“Shut it, Potter.” Draco glared at him in the mirror, which only served to make Draco’s eyes even squintier. He examined Harry’s reflection for a moment. “Your hair, my
Slowly, Harry brought his mouth to Draco’s, stopping before they touched. Now Draco’s breath was on his mouth, and he could feel the heat their flushed faces made together. He moved his nose against Draco’s, against the perfect, straight line of it and Draco’s hand moved up to Harry’s hair and he sighed.
with you, Harry?”
That God blessed the broken road
Draco soon felt Harry tighten up. “Fuck, I’m going to come,” he said. “I –”
Charlie had his mouth at Draco’s throat, and Draco was closing his eyes and moaning. Then Charlie moved out of the way so that Harry could pull Draco’s shirt over his head, and then Charlie returned to Draco’s mouth. Harry moved his hand to Draco’s belt and Draco whimpered as Harry unfastened his trousers and pulled them down.
open. They all looked up in time to see Weasley, Granger, Finnigan, Girl-Weasley, and Thomas strutting through the pub. Which could only mean…
Ari gestured to Harry’s face. Harry reached up and realized he was crying, and wasn’t that really fucking embarrassing? “Thanks,” he mumbled, wiping at it.
Potter was grinning. “You’re – you’re having me on. Arsehole.”
Draco huffed. “I just don’t want to spend my years at Hogwarts in some pissing contest with the other houses. Waste of time, not to mention immature.”
Harry took Draco’s hand and brought it to his mouth. “You kissed my hand the other night,”
after Neville’s stag. Love was weakness, undoubtedly.
Harry bit at his lip and wondered what he ought to say. “Yeah, not a new thing, is it?” She shook her head. “Look, ‘Mione, I know how important work is to you. I do. And I understand. You’re so passionate about it, and I know that makes you feel protective of it.” He cleared his throat. “But I also know that Ron misses you. I know he worries that you don’t…care about him the same way anymore.”
He looked at her, his pale brow furrowing. His gray eyes were dark and troubled. “It’s been difficult.”
Harry shrugged. “It was never real.”
“Harry,” Draco began, and realized a thing had been itching inside of him, needing to come out, and it was dangerous, and it was rash, and he shouldn’t, but – “I think I might be falling in love with you.”
Weasley frowned, and set down his robes, which he’d had draped over his arm. “You supposed to wake him at any specific time?”
“Yes, I’ve thought of that.” He had, of course. He hadn’t been sorted into Slytherin for nothing. “But, I – that’s not why. Not why I would pursue this.”
“Then…if I can't learn how to do it, can
“Goodnight, Draco,” said Potter.
“Excuse you, Lily Potter!” Harry exclaimed, laughing.
Draco just laughed, which Lawrence seemed to appreciate. “I hope you’re at least going to tell me all of Harry’s childhood secrets,” said Lawrence. “He
Lawrence just shrugged and pointed out a good-looking woman who was newly divorced and on the prowl. “That’s Vera Kim. She shares a lot of your interests, Harry,” he said. “Insists on running all over the place and only eats kale and whatnot. Very boring, all of that, if you ask me. What is the point of life without pleasure?”
“Good,” Draco said. “Glad to hear. Anything else?”
Malfoy’s tongue was hot and slick against his own, his lips wet and feverish. Harry moved his mouth down to Malfoy’s throat, which was soft and warm and smelled incredible. It was an oddly gorgeous part of him, all pale and long and elegant, with an Adam’s apple that became prominent when he tilted his head back against the snow. Harry pressed his mouth against the skin there, feeling dizzy and overwhelmed, feeling hot and cold all at once. Lightening was dancing through his veins, lighting up every inch of his skin.
Harry pulled up and looked at him, his eyes a little clearer. “It’s never cowardice to do the right thing,” he finally whispered.
“I’m trying to think if I ever saw them together,” Draco said. “During that time. They were both around, of course. I’m sure they were at parties together and things like that, but I can’t –” He stopped, blinking. “Oh.”
“Be honest with him,” said Hermione, as though she could read his mind. “Tell him the truth. Explain how much we need him. If anyone can convince him to come back here, it’s you.”
There was no way that Draco was going to get on one of those death-trap aeroplanes by himself. No way in hell. The prospect of doing that with all his classmates was terrifying enough. He certainly wasn’t going
, you git. Like a Mind Healer. Sarah says it’s been good. Although he is talking to Ari again. That’s a recent thing, I think.”
William nodded. “And I heard that you were in danger.”
?” cried Harry. “But that’s mad!”
Nothing.
He stood, feeling shaky all of a sudden. “I can’t go back. I’m never going back. This is my home now. This is where I live. I can’t –”
“Damn right,” said Euri, winking. It, too, was charming.
“Trying to fool me, eh, Potter?” said Draco.
“Yes, Potter, Ginny’s converted me. Surprise!”
Cassius looked annoyed. “How long is this going to take?”
Suddenly Charlie was there, pulling Harry close and getting all wet in the process, although he didn’t seem to mind. “I could swear you weren’t always like this, Harry. You really seemed to have your shit together, back when you were killing Voldemort and winning wars and everything.”
“Oh, good,” Draco said, sinking back down onto the pillow. He looked around. He was in a small room with brightly-painted walls of violet and ruby and a deep, emerald green. He was in a gloriously soft, high bed, stuffed with what had to be goosedown.  Nearby, there were tall windows facing the sea, and velvety green curtains drawn back to let in sunlight. “Where am I?”
“And you said…?”
“When, then?”
Yes, He did
“No, you’re not. I can tell that you’re not. You have that clenchy jaw thing going on that you get sometimes.”
Harry thought of Draco, at fourteen. He thought of himself at fourteen. He hadn’t known his arse from a hole in the ground. If someone he fancied had come along and shown him some screwed up version of sex and love, he might’ve accepted it as true. It might have taken a while to figure things out. And if feelings were involved, it might’ve always been tempting, even if he’d known it was wrong.
“To what?” he asked.
"You could, honestly," Harry said. "If you wanted. You have this whole world at your disposal. Probably others, too."
Draco sucked in a breath. Two days. He had two days to figure this out. He sent him the address and said to come at 4:00, which was an hour or two before Harry would get home from work.
Charlie poured them all a glass of tuica and they sat down around the kitchen table and told Harry all about their day. Draco was in a ridiculously good mood, all smiles, chatty with not only Harry, but Charlie, too. Harry reached under the table and squeezed Charlie’s leg in a silent ‘thank you’ and Charlie patted his hand and kept talking to Draco.
He glanced at his watch and saw, to his shock and horror, that it was quarter ‘til six. He was wearing a light blue jumper and gray trousers, but Pansy said casual, so he quickly threw on a pair of jeans, because muggles fucking loved jeans, and then he cast a cleaning charm over himself to freshen up a bit. Then he ran out into the lobby and asked the man at the desk the coordinates for the Nederlander Theatre.
The latter parts of the night seemed to blink in and out of focus, but at some point, Harry pulled Draco into one of the stalls and snogged him till he was begging to be touched. They jerked each other off frantically, messily, and then went back out to dance some more.
Harry and Draco give their classmates an introduction to SASS, then participate in an impromptu game of spin-the-bottle. Oh, and also, Harry realizes he's royally screwed.
“I wish I could go back,” he said. “Change the course of things.”
“So, I’ve been thinking of other questions to ask you,” Harry said, turning towards Draco. Draco wished he would take off his dark sunglasses so he could see his eyes. “And I want to know why you’re doing this. I mean, I think I know which issues you’re passionate about. But why this position? Why now? It’s going to consume your life, you realize. Why are you doing it? And don't give me the usual bullshit; I want the truth.”
Harry was quiet for a while. Draco peeked over at him and saw that he was staring intently at Draco, green eyes bright in the dim of the room. “Tell me,” he said.
“Lily, yeah. And no. We, um. We send them to muggle primary school.”
Class that morning dragged, and all Draco could think about was that Harry was coming to London with him. He didn’t know how Harry had broached the subject with Ginevra, or whether that had caused problems. He was still shocked, frankly, that Harry was doing it at all.
It wasn’t like last time. Malfoy was mostly under the covers, but Harry could see that his chest was bare and pale in the moonlight, his eyes closed, his head tilted back just like last time. And he could see the movement of his hand on his cock underneath the covers.
him? Was this a date?”
Malfoy looked at his watch. “Time to get back. You ready to be glared at by a bunch of parents?”
Potter didn’t answer. His scowl just became more pronounced, and then he stomped off ahead. “What, you’re just leaving?”
Draco himself almost didn’t want to risk it. But he desperately needed to feel something inside of him, needed more than just a simple wank, and this was the only time of day he could possibly manage it. He walked past the Potions classroom on his way out, just to check and see if Potter was there. He was.
“Yes. Now drop it.”
“Homemade bread. Homemade preserves. Tastes loads better, doesn’t it?”
The two already had a decent relationship, from the years that they’d engaged in an unofficial treaty regarding Rodderem and the mountains, but since the battle, they’d become closer. Kerrick had confided in Draco that while there were certain things William simply couldn’t understand, he still had his heart in the right place regarding the kingdom, and had a head for strategy and leadership.  “I think, if given the right guidance, he could make a fine king, someday.” Draco had wanted to roll his eyes, since William would obviously make a fine king, and a lot sooner than someday, but he simply told Kerrick that he agreed.
“No, he doesn’t,” Harry said.
Malfoy laughed, and then looked almost surprised by the fact that he’d done it. “Right. Well. Thanks again for returning my wayward son.”
Harry laughed and took a sip of his pint. “Yeah, I’m pretty chuffed about it. The previous teacher left all of a sudden for personal reasons and they needed somebody. McGonagall heard I’d quit the the Aurors and asked if I’d be interested. I hadn’t even thought about it, but when she said it, it just felt like a perfect fit.”
“No,” Harry said, because
Draco handed him his spelled passport, and the man wrote down some information in a little book and then handed him a key. “They’re split up between Rooms 5, 6, and 7, but supposedly Room 5 is the one with the free bed. Although, I dunno. Last night it seemed like they all passed out in the wrong rooms. None of my business, though, ya know.”
Scorpius looked up and grinned, leaping out of his seat. “Daddy!” he said, flinging himself at Draco. “You’re here!”
Potter’s eyes darted up to Draco’s.
Draco heard the crunch as his fist hit the side of Nott’s head, and it was as satisfying as it was horrible. Nott went down instantly and was still, knocked out cold. Draco stood up from the chair only to immediately have his knees buckle as flashes of rainbow light danced in front of his eyes, and he swayed, dizzy from moving too quickly after being tied up there for so long.
, but I know he didn’t act alone. You’re an American non-mag who just moved here a few months ago, and you’re never in the press or anything like that. He’s an Eastern European wizard who hasn’t been to the U.K. before, and yet he knew of your existence and where you lived and everything else? It’s not a coincidence, Sar.”
“That’s good news, Harry,” Draco said.
Harry hastily dropped Ginny’s hand, but it was too late. Draco stood and mumbled an excuse and practically ran out of the room. Harry stood there, feeling sick to his stomach, and Ginny was looking at him curiously, but he couldn’t make his face behave normally. He was pretty sure he was grimacing.
“People…so, strippers?” asked Seamus, looking hopeful.
Time for lunch.
Harry was silent for a moment. “Yeah,” he said. “So, what do you think I should do?”
“Yeah,” he said. “I know.”
,” Charlie moaned as Draco licked over the length of his cock.
“I suppose it doesn’t matter. You like kissing each other, yeah?” Again, nobody responded. “Answer me when I ask you a question, Malfoy,” he said, directing his fingers towards Draco’s neck.
“Uncharted territory,” said Harry. “You’re like the explorers of old, searching for a brave new world.”
She smiled, blushing prettily. “Oh, thanks. We had so much fun. And Ernie’s nice.”
Draco couldn’t reply, couldn’t do anything. Couldn’t breathe. He knew he was looking at Harry with wild eyes and his face was probably a mask of horror, but he couldn’t fucking

“That thing with Blaise only happened because I was furious with you, you dumbass! Jesus Christ, I didn’t even
“Internet? What do they serve there?”
“Um…” Draco was still frowning. “You’d want me to come?”
Potter. Harry Potter was one of a kind.
Ron glared at him for a moment and then moved to the side. “Fuck you, Harry,” Ron said to his back as Harry pushed his way out of the loo.
Bit by bit, he arranged the pieces, putting them in an order, of sorts. It still left him reeling, but at least he’d sorted through the basics: he was here, in his own timeline. And he was late for work.
When no one responded, Frankie snorted. “I hate to say it, Captain, but I think Big Ham’s version of the story beats yours by a wee bit.”
He watched as Draco looked down at his bare chest and gulped. He fucking
Malfoy shoved Cassius harder against the wall. “I’m not the one begging to be fucked,” he hissed, and Harry felt a burning wave of desire wash over him. Malfoy’s eyes glittered angrily as he snatched at Cassius’s hands and yanked them behind his back, biting into Cassius’s neck and then licking over it with a determined swipe.
“Draco,” Ginny said, turning to him with a wicked gleam in her eye, “how about you? Any public or semi-public shagging?”
I’m the brave one, he thought to himself as he rode the lift to the lobby. I’m brave. Having lunch with Harry isn’t scary. It’s just lunch.
Draco, just to see what would happen, let his legs fall completely open, giving Potter a view of everything, and moved his free hand to his cock and let out a breathy moan.
Potter didn’t look at him or say a word to him. He was still angry. Draco should apologize.
Potter sat up. “What do you mean ‘we both know what we’re getting into?’”
I hear it
He and Draco looked around and spotted Pansy and Hermione dancing not too far away and made their way over. “
He whispered the words and braced himself for whatever was to come.
Berold came hurrying over to him, frowning. “There isn’t anything there.” He reached out and felt it and grimaced. “Oh,” he said. “Surely we can get it off?”
“That’s right.”
?” Harry insisted.
Draco snorted with laughter. “I’m not the one with the fearsome pectorals.”
“Not all of us can spend our lives faffing about in our Manors while the house elves do all the work, Malfoy.”
He nudged Harry’s sleeping form away as gently as he could, wrapping him tightly in the covers. He tiptoed to his bed and pulled the trunk out from underneath it.
She sighed. “Is this what you consider revenge for his previous behavior?”
“Ugh, fine,” Harry said. “Eat them outside.”
Draco stood, chest heaving, feeling like he’d just run five miles. “Possibly. I’m thinking.”
He nodded. “Thank you,” he said again.
He shoved a forkful of pancake into his mouth and chanced a glance at Draco. He was leaning back in his chair, looking around at the conversation that was zipping around the table, but he wasn’t guffawing or giggling or even grinning like most everyone else. He was moving the food around on his plate, but not eating much. After a while, he looked over at Harry, and their eyes met and held for a moment, then a moment more. Finally, it was Harry who looked away, feeling hot.
“We, um.” Harry wanted to die a little bit. “Sort of messed around a bit before Ginny and I got back together. Right after the war. And then he got really weird about it. Kind of…”
, Potter.”
“D’you take them to the vet? Have they had shots? Are they fixed?”
“Draco,” said William, sounding rather formal. And he’d called him Draco instead of Dragon.
“Oh,” Harry said, stunned. “Does Astoria know?”
“Unfortunately not,” Lia said, her hands grasped tightly in her lap. Her eyes flickered over to Draco, her expression clearly saying what she did not:
Draco took the tip in his mouth again, pausing, his eyes on Harry’s, who was watching him with his own eyes half-closed. “Oh, god, you look…” Harry spasmed, thrusting into Draco’s mouth. Draco was ready for it, and he took Harry in, letting him fuck into his mouth. “Sorry,” Harry said. “But if you keep looking at me like that, I’m not going to last much longer.”
Potter blinked at him, his eyes owlish behind his glasses.
Draco stared at him again for a moment, and then something in him seemed to break. “I've wanted to see you,” he said quietly. “I’ve just…I’ve been feeling so awful. Guilty. Ever since I used the Veritaserum on Astoria. I haven’t been this angry with myself in a long time. And I don’t really know what to do about it, so I haven’t been doing anything.”
Potter looked uncertain for a moment, and then nodded.
Harry pulled back. “What the fuck? You just...” He trailed off, laughing, as he reached under the water, and Draco felt fingertips brush against his cock. Just that small touch had him aching. Harry’s fingers moved lower, trailing over his balls and then to his hole. A finger reached in and Harry’s eyes widened. “Wow. Okay. Well, this is certainly new and exciting.”
Suddenly, Malfoy’s mouth was on Harry’s hole and Harry thought he had maybe died and gone to heaven. Because nothing in this world should’ve felt so good; it had to be celestial in nature. Soon Harry was moaning and shivering and tingling everywhere, as Malfoy tongued his arsehole and rolled his balls gently in his hand. When Malfoy began fingering him, Harry started making some really mad noises, borderline embarrassing, and Malfoy leaned over him and began to whisper filthy things in his ear.
Harry wondered, for a brief moment, if he should let the whole thing go. Forget it and just be with Draco. Part of him wanted to. Draco’s mouth was so soft, and it felt so good to be here with him, so insanely good, but Harry knew he would never be able to live with not knowing. Not in the long run, anyway.
him, he was going to hand himself over. It wasn’t even a question of whether he would; it was more a question of degree. Because the more of himself he gave, the more this was going to come and bite him in the arse when all was said and done.
, about you. Mystery, magnetism,
Her face sharpened, her jaw tightened, as she leapt to her feet, her blade at the ready in an instant. “What is it,” she murmured, looking around as she took on a fighting stance, poised on the balls of her feet, ready to swing in any direction. She looked fierce and formidable in her leathers. He wondered if the thick material would protect her from being gored by a magical horn.
“Just tell me.

“That is
“Nothing. He’s nice.”
“Kiss me, and you will see how important I am.”
“We really don’t know of a single person who’s refused to show up?” Draco asked, unable to get over this fact.
Harry found himself worrying constantly about Draco and Charlie, watching them for signs of trouble, agonizing over making everything equal. He knew people did this – had more than one partner – but he honestly didn’t know
She tilted her head. Shook it. “No. I think you would not.”
Euri looked at him hopefully, and his face was so sweet, pink-cheeked and wide-eyed, his soft brown curls falling onto his forehead, tears clinging to his long lashes.
“I need to figure out how to get to a hotel. It’s called the Lumos House?”
“Yes, because it would ruin yours, too.”
“I know, I know.” The man looked at Draco again and grinned. Draco could see the flash of a gold tooth in the semi-darkness. “Not bad to look at, is he. Let’s see the rear.” He ran a hand down Draco’s arse and Draco fixed him with a glare that only made the man’s smile widen. Salazar, he hated being powerless. It felt like being at the Manor during the war all over again. He had no wand, and although he wasn’t skinny and noodley anymore, he wasn’t exactly a body builder. He considered trying to fight his way out of the man's grip and decided immediately against it. There were three of them and only one of him. It would never work.
He could say he’d been sick, maybe. People might not believe him, although he’d been drinking quite a lot very fast, so maybe they’d believe him for that reason.
it was one of the worst days of my life, but it ended up being one of the best, because it led to all this. If she hadn’t broken up with me, I wouldn’t have gotten to know you. I wouldn’t have fallen for you. And I wouldn’t be here with you now.”
She smiled at you boy.
“I like your eyes, too,” Draco said. “They’re so beautiful. You have very dark lashes, did you know?”
He walked into the room and looked at the two blokes standing by bikes in the back row. “Hey,” he said as he approached. “I’m Harry; I’m teaching the class. This is your first time, yeah?”
Draco pulled away suddenly, staring. It was Cassius, sans Harry. No Pansy anywhere. “Where the fuck did everyone go?” he asked.
“Every single one, to varying degrees.”
“William and Lia and Frankie and Berold are all fine.”
“Don’t the tutors look after him?” Harry asked.
“Oh my god, wait until you listen to him, though,” the blonde said. She turned back to Draco. “Say something!”
*****
“Do you believe me now?” she asked.
Draco pulled out his soft cock after a while and sprawled back on a pillow.
Draco didn’t care about the mess. Fuck the mess. He took Harry in his arms, fully, and kissed him rather frantically. But Harry didn’t seem to mind, kissing him back just as desperately. “Draco,” he whispered after a moment. “Draco.”
Draco rolled his eyes before taking a swig, then passed it to Ginny, who also took one. Draco immediately wondered if it was Harry. He’d never asked Harry or Ginny about that, in any timeline. “Never have I ever kissed a girl,” he said.
He felt a little sad then, because Draco would’ve loved it here. He probably would’ve gotten a terrible sunburn, and bitched non-stop about it, but he would’ve loved the energy and the music and the mojitos. Someday maybe Harry would bring him back to Miami, and take him to that Cuban restaurant right off of the beach.
Then the kids went to the corner of the room and Malfoy set up some rings across the floor. The kids had to do leaps over them, their legs arranged in a certain way. They seemed to love this, and were going faster and faster until one little boy wiped out and skinned up his elbow. Malfoy knelt next to him and patted his back, speaking closely to him until the boy calmed, and then went quickly over to a cabinet and yanked out a band-aid and some first aid ointment. Harry was tempted to give the scrape a flick of his wand and be done with it, but he refrained.
“I – yeah. I liked that a lot. Like, a
Draco cast a lubrication spell on his cock, palming it a few times and moaning. Everything felt good at this point, every touch ripped through his body like lightning.
“So, what? You wish you'd become my friend instead of the Weasel's?”
kissed Harry again, and touched him practically everywhere, and acted like…like he wanted him, like he cared for him, like he was falling for him, too.
“Look at it,” he said, pointing.
They made their way upstairs, everything tense and strange and heavy. Draco saw Hermione put a hand on Harry’s back as they made their way up the stairs, and he looked at her and tried to smile, and then she kissed his cheek. “See you in the morning,” she said.
No one came through the floos anymore, except for Draco, and even he only came on occasion. Draco didn’t know whether the fact relieved him or saddened him. A little of both, maybe. He tossed a handful of powder into the closest one, and gave the address of his flat.
He watched as Potter approached the man, ordered a drink for him, and pulled him into a conversation. Draco didn’t remember Potter being particularly charming in school, but he must have picked it up along the way somewhere, because within minutes of meeting Potter, men always seemed dazzled and ready to spread for him. Although, Draco thought snidely, it could be the mere fact of the Harry Potter name. All the men might’ve just wanted to shag somebody famous. Yes, that was likely it. Probably Potter was just as tongue-tied and awkward as ever and coasting on his fame.
Potter sighed, and Draco saw that he was getting irritated. “I know you have the attention span of a flea, Potter, but just give me another minute and I swear this will all make sense.”
Then they were dancing, lost in music, and everything was Harry, his mouth and his body and his flashing green eyes, and Draco thought he could die happy like this, in this Harry-cocoon.
“Sort of. Here, just…” She faced him, and held her weights down at her thighs. She was actually quite fit, now that Draco looked at her in her shorts and fitted t-shirt. She did have very lean muscles. Salazar, he hated her with every fiber of his being.
“I assume we have to wait to go public until our term is over?” Harry asked, nosing at his neck.
“Theo, no,” Daphne whispered beside him. “Theo. Stop. Please.”
"That's more like it," said Potter, grinning.
“Bet I can get you to talk,” Harry said.
Harry wanted to jump on him, honestly. Snog the shite out of him. He had no idea what Draco was thinking, though. “I’m proud of you.”
“Oh my god. The fact that you have forgotten your threesome is more than disturbing,” Draco said, giggling again. “And poor Katie and Chris –”
And the truth was, it was easier to leave that part out. Easier to pretend it hadn't ever happened at all.
and all, so it hardly matters and people will love you regardless, but. You clean up well.”
Potter kept sneaking bemused glances Draco’s way while he fielded Pansy’s onslaught of questions. It felt nice, like a shared joke. Draco had never thought he’d share anything with Potter, not t-shirts, not meals, and definitely not jokes. It was all so lovely that for a moment, Draco pretended that he truly had shagged Potter, in a conventional sort of way, and that there was nothing else to it. The nightmare didn’t exist, Potter wasn’t losing his mind, and he wasn’t here because he was desperate.
He stood up straighter in the little stall. He was a grown-arse man, damn it, and his cock was seeing plenty of action lately, thankyouverymuch. He didn’t need Draco. He didn’t want Draco. He would not let a single fucking thing happen between them. He would listen to Draco’s news and then he would get the fuck out of that pub.
had he been thinking?
, it’s way cooler than hanging out with Gryffindors, so… “
“Well…yes.”
“I can’t stay here,” he said, rubbing his forehead. “You’re all in danger while I’m here, and I don’t want –”
He asked Charlie if he would be interested in heading up the project. Charlie was excited, but also had some reservations. “I would miss it here. I would miss it a lot. But the Sanctuary here is at capacity, and we’ve got really talented staff, and I know they’d do alright. Lucas, though…”
Draco joined him in studying the ceiling. “I could –” he couldn’t say this, could he? Not now, at this pivotal moment between them. But the words slipped out before he could stop them. “I could show you.”
Even before he opened his eyes, Draco could feel the dull ache at his temples. Sunlight pressed heavy against his closed lids, and his limbs felt slow and damp with whiskey-tinged sweat. As he’d done countless mornings, he felt for the vial of hangover potion on the nightstand and, raising himself up onto one elbow, tossed it down his throat, trying not to gag at the sweaty-socks taste of it. It was cruel, to make a potion that fought off nausea so nauseating.
A moment later there was a hand on his shoulder. “I thought we were talking tomorrow,” Draco muttered.
They’d been having this conversation for two weeks. His father was insistent that Draco needed to show renewed loyalty to the Dark Lord in some fashion, and thought that luring Harry to the Manor was the way to go about it.
Everyone tries to move on
During negroni number three, Harry said he was a terrible cat dad because he let Stormy get lost again, and Pansy said he was a wonderful father and cats weren’t children. She then said she wanted a child, maybe, but not really, because it was too cruel to introduce a child into this world, because this world was a shithole. Harry said the world wasn’t that bad, just look at how they’d become friends, and Pansy said she wasn’t really his friend, she just felt sorry for him. Harry told her that wasn’t true and threatened to hex her.
, now can we?”
“All different. There were worlds that were fair and bright and lovely, where the people were so beautiful their faces made me cry. There were worlds that made me feel desperate and cold, where the surface was uninhabitable, so living things stayed underground. There were worlds that were mostly sounds, worlds that were full of colors I’d never seen.”
They were talking about Harry’s extra security detail. Draco had two bodyguards accompanying Harry to everything on the schedule and taking him home. He also had another guy watching Grimmauld Place. That incident with Harry’s roof had scared the hell out of Draco, and even though Grimmauld Place was more secure than the townhouse had been, he was still worried. He didn’t want any dark wizards going anywhere
Draco looked at him, then, his eyes pleading. “You’re drunk, and if you don’t stop right now, I’m going to take advantage of you and then I’m going to feel absolutely horrible about it. And I will definitely regret it.”
“Yeah, no. I know. There’s no way I would ever, you know. I would never.”
They looked at each other, smiling ruefully. “Soon,” Harry whispered. “We can slip into that closet on the third floor.”
A few moments passed, and Draco chanced another glance over, and saw that Harry was still looking, his brow furrowed, his eyes darting back and forth between Charlie and Draco.
He transfigured a piece of parchment into a blanket and huddled in the snow, shivering despite his warming charms. After a while, he rose and began to walk back and forth, just to keep his extremities from freezing. “Fuck this forest,” he intoned as he jumped up and down and wriggled his fingers and toes. “Fuck this forest. Fuckity fuck this stupid forest.”
Not all that innocent, though. They might fuck, mightn’t they? Draco supposed he hadn’t ruled that out yet, not entirely, although some voice in his head was warning him not to rush into anything, especially since he hadn’t fully had time to process what had happened between Harry and him at the pub.
Potter slid in a bit, and his cock was so much thicker than the fingers, and Draco moaned, his cheek resting on the wood of the desk, his hands still holding himself open. Potter moved further after a moment, burying himself all the way to the hilt, and Draco could feel Potter’s cock brutally deep inside, and it felt incredible. The feel of Potter’s heavy bollocks pressed against his sensitive skin was heavenly. He decided he could die happily now, with Harry Potter’s cock spearing him in half.
“I’ll be nice when your prick is in my arse,” he growled, casting a wandless lubrication charm at Potter’s fingers and then pushing his hips back.
But baby don't look up
Harry stared at the place where Euri had been, mind reeling.
So when she woke up, they talked about how crazy the night before had been, and then they used their hands and fingers to make each other come again, and then they went down to breakfast in the Great Hall.
You gotta be cool, you gotta be calm
“A game?” Harry asked, wracking his brain. “Like Exploding Snap?”
- Roald Dahl,
“I told you to meet me at Madam Malkin’s when you were finished! And what on earth is that thing?”
After work on Friday, Harry went to the tavern with everyone else, and stayed late with Annvi, the other new staffer. Annvi was incredibly sweet and also had a crush on one of the other staff members, Austin. They schemed into the night about how to get Austin to fall madly in love with her, then walked back to the cottages rather shit-faced. Harry passed out in the witches’ cottage on their couch, and they made him Nutella crepes and sausage in the morning before he apparated home.
“Well. Yeah,” Harry said.
Draco was already there, clad in a light gray suit, hair immaculately styled, playing with Scorpius. Draco was using his wand to fold pieces of parchment into origami shapes, and Scorpius was laughing and grabbing them.
“You sound surprisingly fine with it,” Pansy said.
“You have to hit this,” Pansy said, pointing to something that said “Enter”.
“You guys want to hang out?" Potter asked. "I’ve got a whole bottle of Ogden’s for the occasion.”
Frankie kicked at the back of her man’s knee. “Where?” she asked.
“Sorry to bother you so late,” Draco said, horribly embarrassed now, as he saw a dozen or so girls behind Lia, staring out at him and giggling. “I was going to take a quick rinse in the river, and I wondered where I could find one of those handheld lanterns? And, also, I saw someone the other day cleaning with something, some sort of soap, to scrub their skin. How does one get something like that?”
done all those things, after all. He’d presented Potter with the very worst version of himself for all those years. That wasn’t the sort of thing that was easy to forget, not really. Not in the long run.
“Well, thank you," said Potter. "D’you think you can round everyone up? Unspeakable Malfoy and I are going to work on the site a bit, and we wouldn’t want anyone getting injured.”
“Get up here, damnit,” Draco insisted.
Daphne looked back and forth between the two of them. “You’re sleeping together?”
“I know,” Draco said, tracing Harry’s eyebrow with a finger, making Harry shiver. Harry was still so damn horny all the time that eyebrow touching was practically enough to make him come in his dress robes. “Still, I’m glad it isn’t going to come to that.”
“It’s very…red,” Draco said, looking around. Good god, all that red really was quite overwhelming. The rug was mostly red, the curtains of the beds and the windows were all red, like the room was
Harry went and sat, and then was very forcefully hugged on both sides. He sighed into Hermione’s bushy hair. “This is so fucked up,” he said.
“Let’s see how you do with this first one, shall we?” Pansy said. She waved her wand and spelled away the smoke and fumes, as she had been doing periodically since they started.
Harry looked at him with a glassy-eyed expression, almost like he’d gotten drunk off Draco’s cock, and then he allowed Draco to pull him up, up, up, until he was straddling Draco’s chest, his cock heavy and red where it was sitting against his chin. Draco licked at it, tasting it, and Harry figured it out then, and got up on his knees a little and leaned against the headboard and guided his hard prick into Draco’s mouth. He picked up his pace then, fucking down into Draco’s mouth, and Draco let him, bringing his hands around to squeeze Harry’s firm cheeks, then to press a gentle finger against his hole, just playing with it, teasing.
“Hi, I’ve got a reservation,” he said, hating how unsteady his voice sounded. Fucking hell, Harry, he chided himself. Get a grip! “Potter, for two.”
“A prayer to whom?”
“You must be, to be able to call Sen. I haven’t meet another Senweir in so long. Are you from the mountains? You have the look about you.”
Harry and Ginny were together again. While they’d never officially
“Oh, Salazar, I don’t even know,” Draco replied, baring his throat. “Anything.”
It helped that Potter wasn’t in half of his classes. Potter was an idiot, so he didn’t take any of the difficult things, like Ancient Runes or Arithmancy or Advanced Potions, and Draco took them all. Draco’d managed to sneak a peek at Potter’s schedule, too, so he knew when he could have the room to himself. He had a free period after lunch while Potter was in Potions with the seventh years. After the first week or so, Draco took to studying in their room after lunch, savoring the peace and quiet.
Why would Malfoy do this?
William was still in his chambers when Draco set out to look for him. He was seated at a desk penning letters, dressed informally – for him – in a simple white tunic, brown trousers, and boots. “You’re here to tell me you’re leaving,” he said without turning around.
Not a loss forever, he reminded himself. It was an easy enough trip for him at this point. It was goodbye for now, not goodbye once and for all. And yet, even as he told himself that, he knew it would never be quite the same. He would never be at home here again. He would be a visitor. An outsider.
“Then I’ll search for that,” she said. She still looked like she was drafting a to-do list in her head, already itching to crack open books on death and the afterlife. “Come here tomorrow, okay? Or, no, I can come to you. I’ll come to your office and bring lunch.”
Suddenly, William grabbed Draco’s face in his hands, and leaned forward and pressed a firm kiss to his forehead. His lips were warm and dry, and he left them there for a moment before pulling away. “I wish you were staying,” he said, finally letting go. “To sit on the throne in my stead, or just…just to keep me company. I’ll miss you, when you leave.”
Harry’s eyes shot open and he was met with the sight of a very angry Mrs. Malfoy. She was back in her usual clothes – today, a powder blue Jackie-O style sheath dress – and standing over Draco’s sleeping form.
dead, that he’d managed to get someone else he cared about killed.
“I’m going to kill her,” Draco said through clenched teeth.
Blaise considered him for a moment. “That’d be good. I would like that. I think Ginny would, too.”
“Sweeten the things he sold at his bakery, I know. You’ve told me.”
“That’s ridiculous,” Potter said. “Of course I liked her.
She was just a girl, a pretty girl, who was probably flirting, he told himself. If anyone should be afraid, it was her, of him.
“Will not. She always used to repeat Celestina Warbeck songs, too.”
Finally, Draco took Charlie’s hand in his. It was big and warm and limp with sleep. Draco held it tighter and drifted off.
was shirtless, pantless Potter doing asleep in his bed?
He didn’t
“He was very nice,” Draco offered as he blinked into the sunlight.
to work alongside the Auror Department, necessarily, but the fact was that when it came to dark and dangerous magic, Draco was among the most knowledgeable in all of Mysteries. Draco could trace the origin of dark magic better than most Aurors, for Salazar’s sake, could sniff out the intent of the caster almost immediately. He had, frankly, a preternatural talent for it. He understood arcane magic too, was familiar with the ancient spells and rituals that few others remembered, the sort of things that might really wreak havoc on the world if rediscovered by the wrong witch or wizard.
He felt Draco nod and laughed, kissing his head.
He could do this.
“Hah, well. That’s true,” he said, and his cock twitched in his trousers, suddenly alert.
Come on show me if your love can
“Yes, but he was worried his parents wouldn’t be keen on the idea of their son dating a former Death Eater.”
“Future of the wizarding world rests on his shoulders, Ginevra,” Draco said.
“I can’t. We
. What about you, then? Who’s on your list?”
“Great heroes need great sorrows and burdens, or half their greatness goes unnoticed. It is all part of the fairy tale.”
“Yes, all right. I have to take down the Queen. Then what? Put William on the throne?”
Draco gave it one more good suck before sitting back on his heels and then standing and smiling out at the room. Everyone whistled and cheered again and Pansy was fanning herself. Draco gave a small bow.
Draco nodded. “Sorry if that’s intense. But
The next two cats showed up in the dead of winter, in the heated outbuilding that housed his woodworking tools. They were even smaller than the first one, just babies, both of them black and white. He’d fed them milk with an eyedropper until they were big enough to lap it up on their own, and eventually, they, too, went out at night to hunt. Unlike Stormy, they didn’t always come in during the day, but usually they did, at least to eat, and sometimes, when they felt like it, they’d laze around the house all day long. Harry called them Biscuit and Bean.
Harry leaned against him and took his hand, kissing his knuckles softly. “Yeah. I'm happy, too.”
He jerked away, staring at Malfoy’s face. “Get out,” he said. “Right now, you have to get out.”
“See?” said Harry.
He’d felt comfortable in the company since the beginning, but something had shifted after the terrible mock battle. The other soldiers – especially the ones that he’d healed – were friendlier, warmer, with him. He was getting to know them better, and it felt good, to be part of something like this, to be fighting side-by-side with people he cared about.
