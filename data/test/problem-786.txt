Once done, you could see the students on board rushing with precision and discipline to cool the canons, hoped into a life-boat, lower the life-boat onto the lake and make their way to shore by manually rowing, all within 10 minutes. Finally, Headmaster Frederik Anker made it to shore and walked confidently and with pride up to Headmaster Dumbledore and shook hands with the man.
''Greetings. I am Ragnok. I am the late Lord Charlus Fleamont Potter's financial adviser and current magical guardian of Heir Hadrian James Potter. I am here to speak to the person who took my ward.'' said the goblin without missing a beat, oblivious or not caring about the shocked face of the human residing in the mansion.
as the french call him. He is said to be the best duellist in all of Beauxbâtons and a language genius who can speak over 21 human languages and 6 magical ones. He already has departments in the French Ministry of Magic fighting to get him to work for them, on top of the Language Guild and the Potion Academy of the ICW offering fully payed apprenticeships. He refused them and offered them to other students who are just as skilled but not as well-off financially or as connected as his family is. He is respected and popular within the french society.” explained Blaise Zabini, surprising Hermione, Ron and Ginny, as he appear from behind them.
for a reason. She was quick, nimble, vicious and swift in battle. While second best duellist to Draco Malfoy in her year, Lilianne was the best under heavy pressure. Her strategic mind and skills was what made the decision for the Goblet of Fire.
“Now, ladies and gentlemen, this cup is the impartial judge who will decide who will become the champions for their school. Now, because of the high mortality in the past, the various Ministries involved, the three Head of schools participating and the many concerned parents, the only people allowed to participate will be seventh years who are seventeen years old. No one else is to enter. No exception.” the old man warned with a stern stare at the audience to impress his warning, not that it stopped the grumbling of the younger years; which shocked the Durmstrang delegation.
With a large smile, his head held high and excitement bubbling in his stomach, Harry made his way to the small office where Lilianne greeted him openly and warmly. He congratulated her for being chosen and wished her the best of chances. She shook his hand and wished him the same. Again, this was the only proper way to greet a fellow champion.
On top of this, Tom had threatened him and his positions. Obviously, he was not going to take this lying down or without a fight! He would show those two little bastards who he was and why they should respect the Great Albus Dumbledore! However, more worrying then either of them was Neville Longbottom. The boy was extremely influential and powerful politically speaking. With Harry not being in England, the second most prominent Light family was the Longbottom and Augusta had wasted no time with filling in the spot. She had as much power in the Light Party as him and only because most of their opinions matched that a civil war in the party was avoided. If the Longbottom boy left the Light Party, they would be very vocal as to why and would leave with all of his allies to the Dark (Albus never considered the Neutrals). And if he left the country like Potter… Best not to think about it.
Harry simply nodded and casting a Notice-Me-Not, he left the classroom for the Queen Anne’s Revenge to warn his Headmaster at once. The sooner this over with, the faster everyone could prepare. He felt a lot more secure and safe now that he had an idea of what to expect from Dumbledore and his sycophants. Their plan would never have worked if Ginny had decided to keep quiet or to participate. He had made sure of it, but the knowledge of who to look out for and what to expect of them would save him many headaches in the future.
There were some, however, who profited from not having Harry Potter at Hogwarts. First the Malfoy family, instead of sending his son to Hogwarts to make friend with the Boy-Who-Lived and thus having more influence, Lucius sent his son to the recently improved and better adapted school of Beaubatons Academy. It would allow Draco to learn more about his roots and be close to home enough for Narcissa. It would be beneficial to the boy, since the Malfoy family didn't have such a dark reputation in France; which meant that no one was intimitated by Malfoy's threats and forced the boy to fight his own battles and forced him to see the world differently. He gained true friends and learn that he could be great so long as he craved his own path instead of staying in his father's shadow.
he possibly could... Which was quite unfortunate for the pedophile as the large floor-to-ceiling was right behind him when he was sent flying backwards. If the blast of the spell hadn't kill him, the fall from the fifth floor to court yard below sure did the job.
''Mr. Ragnock, do you really believe that Harry would be safer at Hogwarts? With Dumbledoor as it's Headmaster? During the man's tenure, more than half of the electives have been removed, the teaching posts cut by more than half, the standards of education are a joke, bullying is waved off with a ''
After the party, Draco told his mother that he could not nor did he want to be courted by the man. Ricardo gave off bad vibes to the young man and made him feel uncomfortable. He did not like him at all and was not going to accept his courting offer. Not understanding what her son meant and thinking he simply was being immature instead of thinking like the next head of the House of Malfoy should. She argued that the man was rich, from a respectable family and was clearly interested in him and that given a bit of time to know one another they would be happy. Draco tried to explain that Ricardo had the reputation of a sleazy, no good, heavy handed and anger prone player. He knew the man was about to lose his place as the head of the Zabini family. He was not as secure of a suitor as his mother thought.
Unless your name was Molly Weasley, née Prewett. Molly was outraged that her son Charlie would marry a complete foreigner instead of a good and pureblooded english rose. She tsks at the Montracue's traditions, she argued with the choices of the bride, she butted into the preparations and undermined everything about the new home of the couple. Molly buldozed her way in and changed everything that Valeria had decided to make the home they would live in more like the Burrow (thus more English-like) and the wedding the way SHE wanted it. It didn't help that Ron and Hermione were helping her along. After Charlie had been called forth, along with his father, to his father-in-law to be told that if he didn't reign in his mother that there would be no wedding, the dragon-tamer put his foot down and told his mother to back the hell off.
It would not be until it was far too late that Albus Dumbledore would hear word that Harry wasn't coming to Hogwarts. He, of course, ran to the Minister of Magic to have him force the goblin Ragnok to change Harry's school, but the goblin was on vacation and not returning until September the second (No, mister Minister, Ragnok didn't leave just to spite you and your ministry. No, we can't overturn this decision. No, we will not call him back from his much needed vacation, the first one he took in the last twenty years. No, we cannot look into his files to see which school Mister Potter is going to attend. Because, that's against the law and would be breaking the Goblin/Wizard peace treaty of 1813. Yes, we know who you are...). Unfortunately for Dumbledore and Fudge, word of Harry Potter's decision not to attend Hogwarts made it to the Prophet and everyone was up in arms. Thousands of howlers were sent to Ragnok (which the goblin simply destroyed before the letters even had time to explose), to the Minister (he had no chance) not doing anything to bring back their boy hero and to Dumbledore for allowing such a thing to happen.
She knew that there was a chance that Harry would not be chosen as the Durmstrang champion, but that did not matter. If anyone asked why they suddenly came back to England after all these years, Rose would simply asked them why and how was this any of their business. After all, it is not like anyone there was their friend or a family member. They could use any excuses they wanted, the bottom line was that Rose came back with her husband and that was it. Of course, if anyone of authority, like the Head of the DLME or the Minister, were to push and insist, they had a multitude of reasons and excuses.
“Don't worry about Alcazar. He has no intention of ever hurting your friend. He isn't one for one night-stands or bragging about which girls or how many he brings into his bed. Alcazar has five sisters, twelve aunts and sixteen female cousins. The last thing he would want for them is to become another trophy on some bloke's hunting board.” reassured the Durmstrang student as he looked on his friend on the dancefloor.
All this because Harry Potter chose to go to another school... What a shame for Albus Dumbledore's plans.
It took every once of strengh and training in Rose not to break down in tears. She couldn't fantom how someone could be so cold and heartless as to announce that their sister had lost her life in such a manner. And that was nothing compared to what the man was asking Petunia to do to little Harry! The man, basically, told her to neglect and treat Harry like less than family and delibrately left the boy in the hands of a woman he had to know hated magic. Why else would he remind her of all the magical things that Petunia wanted but Lily had in such a way?
No! No! She would not allow her sister's child hurt or taint her own son by accident or otherwise. Besides, Vernon would never accept the boy in his house without using physical, verbal and emotional abuse to vent his frustrations. Even if they were safe from the terrorists, it would only protect her family if the boy survived the beatings from Vernon.
Harry looked out to the crowd to find his aunt and his uncle. Surprinsingly, they were civily, and even enthusiastically, discussing with none other than Lucius Malfoy, their host. The man was known to be a supporter of the Pureblood Supremacy ideology and was not a fan of muggles or muggleborns, yet seemed to enjoy speaking with his very muggle aunt Rose. His uncle was not tolerant of thoses who even believed in bigotry of any sorts. In fact, the Vaux De Villiers family, had a rule that at every five generations, a member of the family had to marry either a half-blood with either a muggle or muggleborn parent, or a muggleborn. They strongly believed that the new blood was the reason that their magic was so strong; while for the other pureblooded families, the magical abilities of their members had drastically decreased with each passing generation. The only reason that the Vaux De Villiers were nearly extinct today, was due to Simon Vaux De Villiers, uncle Alexander's father.
Alexander smirked at his nephew's cunning. This would cause unnecessary obstacles in Dumbledore's path once he received Harry's refusal. Ragnok had over an entire year's worth of vacation time stored up, Rose had always wanted to visit Germany (aside from her very secret and dubious work) and the Vaux De Villiers residence in Berlin could rival that of the Black's Grimmauld Place in terms of wards and protection.
The Vaux De Villiers were the pride of the dark families of France. The name had become over the centuries something typically french; if you truly wanted to explore France, you had to go see the great castle of
Dumbledoor tried to reason and manipulate Ragnok into seeing that little Harry's health, life and wellfare were best when in his hands. Ragnok was not impressed. In fact, he was down right furious. To suggest that a goblin could not care and treat a magical child properly, regardless of it's species, was down right insulting and shed doubt on the abilities of goblins to raise their own little ones. To truly make sure that Albus Dumbledoor had little to no influence in his young ward's life, Ragnok issued a recall of all the books, heirlooms and objects that belonged to the Potter family, as well as the exact location of Harry Potter before the end of the week. Should Dumbledoor refuse to comply, the charges of thief, of kidnapping and of child endangerment would be filed with the Department of Magical Law Enforcement and the seizure and immediate closure of the Dumbledoor's family vault.
Rose Vaux-De-Villiers, née Evans, was a woman who had seen many disturbing, dangerous, vile and horrifying things done by humans being to their fellows because of greed, lust and pride. She had worked for many years in a domain that forced her to witness such acts of cruelty and, to her everlasting shame, had done a few of them.
Hospital (Saint-Martyr hospital) to have the soul leech remove. It took less than three minutes to see that the soul leech was in fact a Horcrux and was immediately removed. Ragnok kept the soul fragment in a jar and promised to see if it could not be used to find any other made by Lord Voldefarts, as Alexander liked to call him. It would prove successful and the best thing was, that Harry would never have to hunt them down.
Everyone turned around and saw and squeletal warship rising from the depth of the lake. Large black sails rolling down and puffing up as they caught wind to bring the ship to shore, several yellow lights escaping from the multitude of portholes and the very intimidating 100 glimming and fully operational canons and at the top of the mast, the Durstrang Institute of Magic floated in the wind, made for one hell of an impressive entrance. Then, out of nowhere, as they were but a half a mile away from shore, the canons on deck rose facing the sky and, in a loud and deafening sound, each shot three times to signal the ship's arrival.
Harry wanted to so badly to get into the good grace of the Malfoy heir; both, because he wanted to help his friend's chances to have something with the girl that clearly made him happy, and because the young man was drop dead gorgeous. Skilled duellist, infamous reputation, an aura of confidence that showed that Draco knew his place in the world without being arrogant or narcissitic, all wrapped up in a beautiful body that spoke of hours of training.
Igor laughed as his friend once more had to let down another lady who wished to dance with Harry. Every little old women, little girl and young ladies wanted to have a dance with the young, desirable and good-looking heir that had no betrothal contract attached to him. Harry Potter was the most desirable bachelor in the whole of Europe and it was always a worthy entertainment to see him politely reject the persistent and determined ladies who nearly threw themselves at him. Especially when the ladies in question were of the age of their mothers.
Fourth year was the year Harry Potter discovered his sexuality. He discovered that women have no effect on him; they just didn't do anything for him. Men on the other hand... It all started in the bathroom. He had walked in on the girls Quidditch team showering one evening, thinking they were all done for the day. He seriously was shocked when he walked in and saw the ladies showering. So shocked that he had stood there for two whole seconds before running out yelling apologises to the ladies. It was later on in his bed that he realised that, despite having seen some very naked, wet and curvaceous young ladies, he didn't feel the need to take care of a ''special business''. Rather, he felt bad for the girls. Some of them were twelve and still growing; puberty was starting and it was scary, the last thing they needed was to have a boy judge them on their bodies. The next day, Harry went to each and every girl to apologise for the situation. A few days later, Harry walked in the bathrooms with his team to shower and get ready for supper. As he undressed, he started to notice just how muscular and well-endowed his friends were.
Lost in his thoughts, Harry never noticed the blond that had walked up to him until said blond started poking his chest. Looking up from his glass, Harry was met with two breath-taking molten silver eyes. Blond locks, surrounding an angelic oval face with high cheekbones and a lovely small nose, that caught the light of the sun and shone like liquid silk. Almost as tall as him, lithe body with lean muscles and a smile that mocked, charmed and challenged him, Harry was almost speachless.
Heir Hadrian James Potter, son of James Charlus Potter and Lily Amarylis Potter, née Evans, nephew of Lady (or Madame as they say in France) Rose Iris Vaux De Villiers, née Evans, and of Lord Alexander Simon Vaux De Villiers, and ward of Ragnok, Third son of Bloodspear and account manager of the Most Noble and Ancient House of Potter, had a very big decision to make.
Armand was a gentle, caring and patient lover; he had made sure to ask Draco what he liked and what he wanted. However, his skills and mastery of the art of sex were... Humm.... Lacking... The older boy tired after twenty second and had obtain his orgasm before Draco had started to feel any real pleasure (he didn't feel pain; it was a strange in-between). It left the younger boy unsatisfied. However, it was during the summer that Armand had decided to break their relationship, because, according to the french cad, Draco was simply not that great in bed... Instead of crying his eyes out, Draco had taken one of his ancestor's old wand, flooed to the nearest Malfoy villa, took a Magical Taxi (like the Knight Bus, but less crazy) to his ex-lover's house and proceeded to hex him blue, black and purple into the next week. Making sure, on his way out, to mention their little affair to his new, pretty and very much female fiancé and his parents, who turned out not that accepting of homosexual relationships. Less just say that the news of Draco Malfoy,
''I will take Harry now and you will leave as soon as possible. This is the last time we will see each other. Something we can both agree that it is in our best interests. Let's face it. We never even liked each other. Even as children. Lily was the only one who could make us civil towards one another. Goodbye. And good luck!''
Fifth year was the year of love in Beauxbatons. Marco started to date a sweet Swedish girl by the name of Olga, while Lilianne decided to explore and met several young men for a
“First, thoses are abraxans, not pegusies. Second, how on earth do you expect to pass your Care for Magical Creatures OWL if you can't even tell the difference?” snorted a second year Ravenclaw in disbelief (not that anyone could blame the kid).
The Durmstrang delegation made their way to the ship in silence. It wouldn't do to discuss your host in front of them; it was the hight of impoliteness and crass behaviour. Something some of the english didn't seem to understand, like that awful redheaded troll at the Gryffindor table. Granted, it would be impressive if any of the students of the english enclaves knew Norwegian, German or Russian, but it was better to be safe than sorry. Once on board, everyone started talking about their impression. So far, nobody care much for Hogwarts Headmaster's attitude, the students of the Lion House and his redheaded mascott with shitty table manners. They were, however, excited to see the famed library, to catch a glimpse of the giant squid living in the lake, to witness duelling master Flitwick duel and meet more of the students. So far, the snakes were pretty nice to them.
''... I'll be there in less than an hour. Don't leave the house. Do not answer the door or the phone. Close all the drapes and keep your family in the same room with an exit. Always keep a knife or something to fight back. I'll use our old code when I'll arrive.'' ordered the youngest Evan sister before hanging up.
''I will come with you to the hospital and speak with the healers. However, it is best to bound with your chosen mate as soon as possible. It will prevent the British Wizarding Ministry from removing young Harry if they ever found out he was raised by a single female muggle. The Ministry does not approve or see in the best of lights single mothers or children out of wedlock. Furthermore, the French Ministry for Magic will not refuse service to my species, just muggles. Something one does not find in Britain.'' said Ragnok as he sat down and pulled the necessary paperwork both she and Alexander will have to fill out.
The next morning, Narcissa was gone from England and Lucius Malfoy told Ricardo to go take a dive in the Channel with a cinderblock tied to his neck. Two weeks later, Blaise Zabini was made heir to the Zabini family and would take up the Lead of the family on his seventeenth birthday.
Alexander Vaux De Villiers felt it to be an insult to his family's honor to accept any sort of money when the family had sworn to protect and raise Harry. He gave his word as a gentleman that he would raise and protect Harry as his own child and when one does such a promise, then one pays and must own up to the responsibilities of raising a child. This inclueded any financial necessities. If they had monetary issues, than Alexander could understand the stipend as it helped the family with the strain of raising an extra child. However, the Vaux De Villiers were anything but poor! Raising and paying for one child would never even begin to chip at the iceberg that was the family's fortune; so it would dishonorable to accept any kind of financial help from Harry's vaults or family.
“Elite Potter, I know you are an adult. I know you don't appreciate being treated as a child, but this is for your protection. Herr Dumbledore has asked multiple times to have you come to his office as soon as the feast ended tonight. When I refused, Herr Dumbledore tried to arrange a meeting, again with you alone, for tomorrow morning. No matter what I said, the man would not let go and has tried to use many underhanded reasons. If he comes to you and tried to make you come to his office alone and you feel threathened in any way, shape or form... I give you permission to use force and magic to defend yourself. I have written permission from the French government, of which your are a citizen, that allows you to use any types of magic to defend yourself, barring the Unforgivables. The permission is a temporary tattoo that will rest on the back of your right hand. I expect you to never abuse your privilege and to use it wisely. Do I make myself clear?” asked once more the Headmaster, knowing full well he didn't have to worry about such things from his Elite.
However, not all was happy moments and smiles that year. For the first time in their friendship's history, there was true fear that it would broken for ever. It all started because of a scandal on the Hungarian-Romanian magical border. A caravan of Gypsies was making their bi-annual cross between Hungary and Romania; all was well until the caravan was stopped by a squadron of Hungarian Aurors who had to make a routine check. Unfortunately, one of the younger men of the caravan had something to hide and was subsequently arrested; again nothing out of the ordinary there.
No one agreed on which school Harry should go to once he turned eleven. Rose wanted to keep Harry away from Britain and Dumbledoor by enrolling Harry at Beauxbatons Academy. Both Alexander and Ragnok quickly veto against it. While french and of good reputation, the school centered mostly on etiquette, charms, enchanting and very little in defense, sports and had a abysmal transfiguration curriculum. Alexander had seen the results of Beauxbaton Academy when his sister had graduated; the french school had turned a promising young girl into another brainless and unoriginal spoiled brat that rejected her family's gifts as it was too
The second, would be the Weasleys. Since Draco wasn't going to Hogwarts, Lucius would never have to go to Diagon Alley in the Summer of 1992, thus never giving the diary of Tom Riddle to Ginny and having it destroyed (which saved him from the Dark Lord's wrath later on). Also, without Harry Potter, the twins would keep the Marauders map in 1993 and discover Peter Pettigrew posing as Scabbers, thus clearing Sirius Black's name and earning three thousand galleons each from the man for their help in his release. Even Percival got something out of it, when, on Halloween night 1991, his youngest brother insulted the muggle-born Granger, he was the one who noticed she was missing and rushed to get the kids into the common room, sent a warning to the teachers and got to the bathroom on time before the troll killed the poor little girl. He received a
“Headmaster, I know you don’t like me and that you don’t recognise my authority, but let me be very clear. If you keep on harassing Lord Potter or keep on hurting our country’s reputation, I will have you thrown out of Hogwarts and out of the Wizengamot so fast; you won’t have time to say Lemon Drop. Do I make myself clear?” asked Marvolo in a tight and strained voice, demanding an answer.
It only got worse when it was reported that Harry Potter, Boy-Who-Lived and heir to three powerful and rich families, was going to attend the party... UNACOMPAGNIED. It meant that many young witches and their opportunistic families were now cursing Dumbledore to Hell and back. His aunt Rose had the article cut out and spell-o-taped in her scrapbook of “
Third year was the year Harry Potter's name started to make it's way into the high ranks of the European countries. It all started with creepy looks and an uncomfortable behavior from one of the teachers, one Ivan Gorgowitz. A fat, balding old man that taught Card Magic,a branch of magic that uses special card to either predict the future (with dubious accuracy), connect with the spirit world (more than once proven to be true and rare) and help transmit messages from the gods, the deads or something else that was never human or good to the living. Dark magic for some, but for the Magical Gypsies, a true gift from the gods. It was during that year that Harry met Igor Vanslow, a brilliant Card Mage from a gypsie family. During the entire year, Harry, Alcazar and Igor noticed a strange pattern emerging within their year peers and the upper years as well. Boys from lower class families where often put into detention with Professor Gorgowitz, as they were apparently trouble makers and the teacher had such a efficient ways to deal with them. They entered as normal students, but left hollow and terrified husks. It took the trio less than a term to figure out what was going on. The man was sexually abusing the young boys who had no political power to fight against the man or be taken seriously by the Headmaster Karkaroff. Harry never liked the man, but when his friend and him had discovered that he willingly turned a blind eye to the abuse... Well, lest just say it didn't take long before Uncle Alexander was made aware of the situation. Two hours after Harry had sent his letter, Igor came running to him to tell him that Alcazar was in detention with Gorgowitz and according to his cards, the man was going to be the boy's death if no one helped him. With adrenaline pumping through him, ignoring whom he bumped into and dragging furious teachers after him, Harry raced to the teacher's private quarters and burst in at the very moment where Alcazar lost conciousness.
Then came the discussion of Harry's discipline, both Rose and Alexander did not believe in physical punishment. They did not believe that hitting, insulting or beating a child would teach him anything other than how to improperly deal with his anger. They did believe in making a child do some chores like weeding the garden when he did something wrong or something of the likes when a child misbehaved. They believed in a strict set of rules, clearly defined and understandable. They believed that a child could make his own mistakes, but that didn't mean that he could not be punishned.
During his fifth year, Harry noticed that more and more people were sucking up to him; much to his repulsion. Heirs and spares of noble and pureblooded families simpered, flattered and batted their eyes at him in the chance that he would look their way. Fifth year was the year where betrothal contracts were usually made in Eastern Europe and everyone wanted to snatch the young Runes and Duelling prodigy that was also the heir of not one, not two, but three Ancient and Noble families. The Potter fortune in itself caught a lot of attention, the Black fortune and standing got people going crazy and the Vaux-De-Villiers... Now that made them desperate. For you see, Uncle Alexander had asked Harry to be his heir as he could not have children of his own. Harry had obviously agreed, making him irrisistable to gold-diggers.
No one had questions and so, they were let go. Madame Maxime and Lilianne left the small room together after promising to sent Harry’s regards to Draco, making the young man smile. This caused a bit of a problem with Dumbledore. Immediately, the man requested (read demanded) to speak privately with Harry as he had some important information to tell him. Headmaster Anker wasted no time to tell his English counterpart that he was not going to have a private conversation with one of HIS students without his presence; especially as said student was their school’s champion. It was unethical and improper! How many times would he have to repeat himself?
Taking out a letter with green ink and a seal with a snake, a lion, a badger and an eagle, Alexander privetely thought that old Charlus Potter might have been the smartest man in his day and age when he chose Ragnok as Harry's magical guadian. The letter was soaked through in compulsion potions, loyalty potions, binding spells and a whole lot of other spells that had no place on a child's school invitation letter. Dumbledore was really desperate to have Harry at Hogwarts and to have control over him!
Fourth year was the year Draco came to the realisation that he was attracted to both the female population and the male population. It all started on a Saturday morning, when out of the blue, Draco had awoken before dawn and couldn't fall back to sleep. Unbeknown to him, Draco had caught the eye of an upper year by the name of Armand De La Fontainebleue; the seventh year found the young reclusive english boy to be absolutely delicious. It had started with one friendly conversation and, buy the end of the month, they were a couple. Of course, after what happen last year, Draco was far more guarded, not that Armand could or would blame him. They had dated for over four months when Armand started to let his hands roam in territories that was better to ask permission than ask forgiveness. Draco had made it clear that he was not ready or interested at the moment, but he was not oppose to some gropping and snogging, so long as it was over the clothes. It was a few weeks before the end of term that Draco finally accepted to give himself to his lover; he trusted Armand and he loved him. He felt safe, loved and felt ready for this. It had been... Not disappointing, but not great either.
''Rose! Why aren't you letting Dudley cry like this? Just leave the... the... boy... and help Dudley! He's not your son. Why should you pay him any time?'' asked Petunia as she rushed to her son.
To the goblin's surprise, the man was right. Hogwarts was no longer a good option for Harry. The education given to the students was severely lacking and useless. As a magical guardian and as a professional goblin banker, he could not send his ward to such a substandard school without shaming his ancestor and his nation. Such a poor decision would be a bad investment on his part; and Ragnok did not become the financial advisor and guardian of one of the Most Ancient and Noble families by making such bad decisions. But where to send Harry, if not Hogwarts.
“Oh, I don’t have the best grades or am the bravest. I’m a bit of a disappointment to my House. I entered the Tournament because I thought that, on the small chance, that I was chosen, I could prove that I wasn’t a joke and bring honor to my family’s name.” Said the young man with blond hair. “I’m just so shock and flustered that I’m the one chosen over everyone else in my year! It’s just… Wow!”
“Ja, Schulleiter!” they all responded firmly and authomatically. Hesitation or doubts would not be tolerated.
She tore the letter open and began reading. It would be an obvious understatement to state that she was shocked at the content of the letter, but she couldn't, for the life of her, blame the child. Hogwarts standards had dropped significantly for quite some time now. Many of the classes that she had during her school days where removed; Albus managed to convince the Board of Governers and the Education Department to removed these classes that were so important to the students. Hogwarts international standing was the lowest in the Great Eleven Magical Schools and it only kept falling. The students were lazier and more prejudiced with every year passing.
Rose was adament that Harry went to a muggle elementary to learn how to socialise and help learn about his muggle heritage; while Alexander though it was a terrible idea, as children were often time cruel and Harry could respond with accidental magic. Besides, unlike Britain, France offered a elementary type of school for wealthy elite families where children learned to socialise and learned about the basics such as math, reading, writing, french litterature and history. Thought not completely satisfied, Rose accepted to send Harry to
to be exact, we will have the traditional Weighing of the Wands. Where a professional Wandmaster will come and inspect your wands to make sure that they are in order. We will then have a small press conference. If there is any subject, you do not want the press to ask about, please warn your respective Headmasters and we will make sure to explain this to the press. If the press does insist on those subjects, we will be throwing them out. Now, is there any questions?” explained Leeman with a large smile.
Seeing this, Harry immediately took her in his arms and tried to console her. This was both surprising and expected at the same time. Harry knew fully well that Dumbledore had prepared something to try to control him like a puppet. That he would use sex and love as manipulation tools was a given. They were powerful tools if you knew how to use them. Many before had tried that very same tactic with him and countless others at Durmstrang in order to gain his inheritances and titles. Harry suspected that many had the exact same plan as Dumbledore and said so to Ginny to calm her down.
The couple refused to accept any form of payment, stipend or allowance from the bank, the trust fund for Harry or from any other sources. Rose insisted that she could provide her nephew with everything and if the rest of the Vaux De Villiers family felt it was unfair that they should pay for everything for the child and not receive anything in return, she would raise the money herself. She had more than enough to provide for her nephew and herself. No. It would be better to invest the money in Harry's future. The only thing that would be taken out of Harry's vaults would be either heirlooms, journals from previous family members and possibly the portraits of his parents. Nothing else!
The second man was named Daniel Leeman, half-blood who was Bagman’s second-in-command and the unofficial Head of the Department. Much more competent and fitted for the role, he was the person you went to when you need help or if you wanted to advance in the department. Ravenclaw alumnae, Leeman refused to simply accept the word of famous, rich, or powerful people without looking into a situation. He was the reason that the Tournament had not been allowed in 1994, when Bagman had tried to present the whole thing to the Minister of Magic with barely any thoughts or explanations. Leeman had made the research and proved that, had Minister Fudge gone with Bagman’s plan, the Ministry would have been screwed.
Albus looked at the students all waiting for the names of the competitors to be called out by him. All looked at him. All were focused on him. As they all should be. While the vast majority looked at him with excitement, awe, respect and joy; many more were looking at him with either mistrust (mostly Slytherins), disgust (again, mostly Slytherins) and bewilderment (the visiting students who could not believe this man would wear such hideous garments at such an official event). Albus almost frown when he saw Harry bloody Potter sneer at his robes and whisper something in that dirty Gypsy boy’s ear. What was wrong with his robes? They were all the rage in London!
Such a response would have been unacceptable at their school. If the Headmaster gave directions, you kept your mouth shut and obeyed. Especially when it came to security, it wasn't there because the authority figures had nothing better to do on a saturday night. Honestly, such lack of discipline from the English was not giving a good image of their school.
Once Petunia fed and changed her own son, she made her way to her contact book and look through to find her sister's number. It took her less than four tries before her sister finally picked up the phone.
For his part, Harry understood perfectly that while his words were taken into account, they meant very little to the blond. Only Alcazar's actions could determine the opinion of his dancing partner's friends. He couldn't even blame Draco for it. How many times had he covered for his friends or vouched for them when they got into trouble at school?
The Durmstrang student applauded with grace and curiosity at the young woman’s skills. Muggleborns were not accepted in Durmstrang and many of the students came from Old Blood and some from blood-purist families. Many had prejudices against those of Muggle descent and seeing that one was just accepted as a champion over many other of so-called purer blood, it led to reflection and no small amount of curiosity. If she proved to be skilled and powerful, then she might be worth marrying into a branch family or a third or younger son of a main branch. Power was power, regardless where it came from and it was not to be spat upon.
“Now, I know you must all be impatient to hear about the First Task. I will ask you all to wait until I am done before asking any questions. One, the Task is set up to test your courage and your skills. A champion must have the courage to face his or her fears and must have the skills to overcome the challenges in front of them.”
(Pass River, in english) in Brittany. The family's castle showed so much of the dark and less than glorious, but necessary parts of the French Wizarding World. Books, paintings, weapons, artefacts, armors, war engines, jewelry and so much more was on exposition for those who wanted to learn more about the dark in France.
She clearly loved her nephew and cared for his safety and health; she took immediate actions to make sure that her nephew could be safe and sound. She understood (maybe not in it's entirety) the ramifications of the duel between young Harry and Lord Voldemort and proceeded to make sure that her nephew's future was not in danger. Futhermore, her blood relation to Lily Potter, her obvious love for her nephew and the scattered toys and youngling necessities only made the blood wards all the more powerful. No one could offer better protection to young Hadrian than Rose Evans, soon to be Vaux De Villiers(except perhaps, Lily Potter herself).
It didn't take long before the toddler with a raven's nest for hair raised his head and looked up at his aunt and a bright smile came across his face. He raised his little pudgy arms and made a grabby hands motion to have his aunt raise him up. Without waiting, Rose took Harry in her arms and gave him the bigest hug she could give him without being crushed. She placed a small kiss on her nephew's forehead to offer a bit of comfort to her now orphan nephew.
Fifth year was quite an eventful year for Draco. To begin with, his language teacher offered him an official assistant job with full pay. Which brought him many acclamations from the staff, but many dark looks and rude rumors from the other students; either Draco slept with the handsome middle-aged man to get over his break-up or he slept with the teacher to make sure that he didn't fail his classes. Either way, he was a whore and was using the poor older man. Of course, none of it was true and no one was brave enough to taunt or say such things within earshot of anyone related to the Malfoy heir; lest they find themselves at the other end of his wrath.
Once the song was over, Draco sauntered out of the stage and went to his friends. There he was met by the manager of the Blue Covent who insisted to pay him for his show as it had brought in many customers and to ask him to come back. Draco politely declined and explaining why he couldn't come back, since he was technically a minor. The manager payed the teenager and was about to escort the trio out when none other than Ricardo Zabini showed up to “congradulate” the beautiful performer he had the delight of watching.
of November of 1981, when Petunia opened the door of her house to find her fifteen months old nephew on her porch like a bottle of milk. She honestly couldn't understand who would leave a child like this in the middle of the night without so much as thicker blanket or even ringing the door bell to explain what was going on. Who in the world announced that one sister, along with her husband, was now dead at the hand of a terrorist and that their nephew was the only protection they had against the madman and it's follower?
First, it had been the Marauders. Oh, she had loved thoses boys with all her heart! Sure they were responsible for a large part of her grey hairs, but they had been good boys. She bitterly cursed herself for not reigning them more and being a better Head of House. For, while they had been good-hearted boys, they also were bullies. She was not blind to their faults nor hers. She knew she should have done more. As for the twins... She gave them the discipline that she never given to the first group of pranksters; she, however, failed to see where their interests lied and encouraged them to pursue their dreams. It pained her that they weren't the only students she had failed, either. She felt old in her bones, so tired that even waking up was too much effort, she barely had any joy in her work at all and she was so sick and tired of dealing with Hermione Granger's holier than thou attitude and Ronald Weasley agressive and disrespectful behaviour.
Harry's first year was the beginning of his true fame; not the one that was spunned by a meddling Headmaster. Upon his first week, he was jumped at least four separate times by upper years whose families had to leave England after the Dark Lord's fall. He didn't win any of the fights, but he gave as good as he could and managed to break more than one nose in the process. He excelled in most of his classes; especially duelling, runes and defense. The only classes he didn't seem to agree with him were the dark arts class and history. Before the end of the first semester, Harry Potter was known as the most powerful first year in the school. By the end of the school year, the ravenhead boy was considered a genius in duelling and a prodigy in runes. He passed the second year exam with ease; he was now entereing third year in runes. He was friends with a boy by the name of Alcazar Montracue from Romania; a good boy from a middle class upbringing with (unfortunately for him) five sisters.
“Ja, Schulleiter!” responded Harry without hesitation, he understood the responsibility of such a privilege.
“Who cares? He's a Malfoy! Death Eaters the lot of them! He's dark. You can tell just by looking at the ponce! Probably got refused to entrance to the school, cause they're so dark! Dumbledore kick them out before they could curse innoncent students! He would have been into Slytherin, if he had come here! Just shows that he's evil!” cried Ron, face getting more and more red as he spew his bigoted vitriol at the jealous surging inside of him from Hermione's interest in the blond. “Besides, what the hell are you doing here, you slimy snake? Go back to your pit!”
Which was why, at this very moment, Rose was planning to have everyone (Sirius, Remus, Alexander, etc.) sent to Greenlane Place, the Vaux-de-Villiers’s townhouse in the heart of London. There, everyone would be closer to everything and would be able to act quickly if things went wrong. She wanted everyone one to moved out efficiently to help Harry and no man or god was going to stop her righteous fury if her nephew had so much as a hair out of place. Her entire armoury was being ship to Greenlane Place and her superiors were awaiting her arrival.
After his name was cleared and after Sirius had paid the twins for their part, Ragnok had invited the ex-convict to meet Harry in France. Completely ignoring Albus Dumbledore's attempts to speak with him and attempts to stop him from leaving the country, Sirius made it to France and finally had a chance to meet his godson. Harry and Sirius finally were able to bound as they should have been. They were joined by the end of summer by a man named Remus Lupin who turned out to be an old friend of Sirius and James.
Harry got up and made his way to his Headmaster to shake his hand. As was proper protocol for any champion. The man clasped the forearm of his student and placed a firm hand on his shoulder, signalling his blessing and approval of the competitor. By clasping, Harry’s forearm instead of simply shaking his hand meant that his Headmaster was recognising him as a warrior and not just as his student. It touched the young man deeply to be recognised as such in a public setting.
“Wait… what? Why would he do that? What would he gain if I were to marry you? If you did become my wife and we lived together, you would be force to follow MY directives. You would not be allowed to take money out of my vaults unless I gave you a sum by hand, you would not even be able to see your family without my permission. That’s how the law works in England! You would be my property for lack of better words. How does he expect to control me?” asked Harry, confused and quite pissed.
When Harry returned to Durmstrang, he was welcomed by his Runues and Duelling teachers with open arms; they had such high hopes for him. His runes teacher wanted for him to keep on studying as fast as possible to make sure her star pupil reached his full potential. By the ways things were going, Harry Potter could be the next Great Master of Runes and Wards before he hit his twenty-fifth birthday; an honor reserved only for the best of the best! His duelling instructor wanted to train Harry to beat Gellert Grindelwald's school record before his sixth year. Grindelwald's trophies had always been a source of pride and shame for the school. The school was proud to say that a student of their school had obtain his duelling mastery before he had completed his NEWTS in the matter, but felt great shame that this student used their great teachings to kill and commit such horrid crimes. Harry Potter was on the way of actually breaking the record; he already reached Grindelwald's number of wins for his first year. During that year, Harry and Alcazar tried out for one of the Quidditch teams; Harry made seeker and Alcazar became the game's commentator. The romanian boy had vertigo and hated with a passion flying, but was quite interesting when commentating with his sharp wit and sarcams. By the end of the school year, Harry was now half-way through his fifth year and was almost ready for his OWLs Runes, broke Grindelwald's number of winning duels for second year and was now seeker for one of his school's team. Life was good!
Unfortunately, an officer noticed them and started to run after them through the backalleys. They managed to shake the officer of the law when the entered a building through the back door, only to find themselves in the backstage area of the Blue Covent, a Moulin Rouge type of establishment for wizards. The girls were preparing themselves for their show and, to blend in and escape the officer, the three teenagers decided to pretend to be dancers by cross-dressing. It worked well! The officer left once he realised that he couldn't find the brats he was looking for and left. Unfortunately for Draco, he was grabbed and pulled onto the stage after being mistaken for one of the girls.
1996, Charles Lionel Weasley officially married Valeria Anastasia Montracue in Bucharest, surrounded by their loved ones and by Lady Magic herself. It was a day of love, beauty and happiness as two loving families joined in the celebration of one of their own leaving the nest and creating their own family.
Harry passed all his OWLS. He had nothing but O's and EE's on his tests; he obtained perfect and special mentions in Duelling. He even defeated Grindelwald's record and had a trophy to his name (Grindelwald's was finally removed and put aside). However, it was Runes where Harry truly shined. He received an offer to start his mastery at the start of the summer. To celebrate his nephew's accomplishment, Rose payed for her nephew to spend at least three weeks in South America to learn about the Mayan Runes. Seeing all theses new runes and ways of life, Harry decided to travel the world and learn as much about the runes and the cultures who created them.
wanted to cut stones to make castles faster and easier than the muggle way. The cuts were even and straight; it made for better and stronger castles, since there wasn't as much morter between them that could be chipped through if attacked. They cut expenses by half and got more money out of their work. For a time, the spell was held as a miracle spell for stonemassons and construction workers; but then... A war came their way, and like many other wars, humans, magical or not, showed a frightening amount of creativity in ways to hurt and kill one another. The country was divided in two and no one was spared; all had to fight. It was a stonemasson who used the spell against another being first; he wanted to protect his family from invaders. He cut down twenty-eight armed men in less than five minutes! When a general heard this, he demanded that all his men learned the spell and used it on their ennemies in battle. Before long, people were losing limbs like crazy and blood was raining everywhere. It was even called the Cutting Hex Battle. After the war, the Statue of Secrecy came along and many spell were labeled dark and it was to the new governments to regulate what they accepted or not.
Fourth year was the year of personal hell for Dumbledore, first off, he had to expel three students from Hogwarts after they had gang raped a first year half-blooded girl from Slytherin. It would have been swept under the rug if Snape hadn't been so damn focused on his snake and more on Harry Potter like he would have if the boy had come. The Potion Professor had noticed something odd about the girl and had found out the whole sordid affair. Of course, being the slimy... err...
Unfortunately, her other nephew didn't appreciate not being the center of attention and began to wail and throw a temper tantrum. Rose steadily ignored the boy and proceed to take some baby food to feed Harry. It only made Dudley angrier; to make sure that everyone knew it by throwing his toy at his aunt's head. It never Rose as she caught the toy mere inches from her head and kept the toy in her hand. This did not made Dudley any happier; it made things worse.
“Oh, yeah. Edward Teach, a.k.a. Blackbeard, was a half-blooded wizard who went to Durmstrang and when he retired and faked his death, he gifted his ship to his alma mater. Since then, the
It was then that Harry understood exactly what his uncle had meant before his first year. Even with a Light spell, one could do many terrible things.
It was clear they wanted to see what sort of man was the other was. Would they be the sort of man who had such a fragile ego that they would not tolerate his partner to take the lead once in a while? Would they be the sort to put the other in their supposed place? Would they throw the other away for not being sumissive enough? Would they simply fold and accept the dominance of the other? Or, perhaps they would accept the other's independance and enjoy to follow their lead sometimes? Or perhaps they would love the other for who they are and would help raise the other up instead of trying to keep them down? Well, now was the time to see...
This year was the OWLs year for Draco, Marco and Lilianne. Which meant that they had to work their butt off studying. They couldn't afford any distraction as the next year was their NEWTs. The french school had their OWLS during the sixth year as oppose to the other school who did it a year earlier. Draco wasn't worried, he had worked hard since the beginning and was no fool or slouch. He knew he would get good grades so long as he had discipline and worked hard. If only the same could be said for half of his year. For some reason, the purebloods never really put much efforts into their educations; they didn't see the point since their parents were either rich or could get them into any department of their choice in the government. However, during the summer, a new President of the Magical French Republic, who believed that one should get in on their own merits and skills, rather than their families or wealth, was voted in and all the purebloods who had passed by the skin of their necks the past five years were now frantic in their bid to get good grades. The other half of the year worked even harder to make sure that these lazy, bigoted and spoiled moronic incompetents never made it to power; the country was already doing poorly, no need to make it worse with theses fools at the helm. So everyone studied and worked hard.
Rudely and abruptely, Mrs Figgs closed the door of Mrs number 5 Privet Drive and ran as fast as her old legs could to her fireplace to contact Dumbledoor. Unfortunately for her, Mrs Figgs did not see Mr Whiskers, one of her many kneazles, and tripped over him and cracked her head on the edge of her fireplace. Hearing the commotion, Mrs number 5 and Mrs number 7 Privet Drive entered the old lady's house to find her unconcious and bleeding. The ambulance arrive exactly fifteen minutes later to pick up Mrs Figgs. Unfortunately for the old woman, Mrs number 7 watched a lot of medical drama series on television and believed herself to be a professional doctor and decided that Mrs Figgs's head had to be moved as her awkward angle could hurt her in the long run. This had the undesire effect to snapped the old woman's neck; killing her instantely. The first responders could only confirm her death.
''That would be I. My name is Rose Evans, soon to be Vaux De Villiers. I took my nephew Harry from my sister's house. She did not feel that she could take properly care of him and has given me sole custody of Harry.'' explained the young blond and green eyed woman as she pulled out the letter Petunia gave her.
“This summer, after we all came back from Charlie’s wedding, mom and the Headmaster pulled me aside and told me how important it was that I made you fall in love with me. How it was important for my family to get out of our so-called poverty that I marry you at any cost! Even if I have to baby-trap you! They went on and on about how I had to guide you towards the Light. My mom even proposed to brew weak to medium strength love potion to get your attention and later on, keep it. She was one step away from telling me that I should go to a brothel and learn how to please you in bed!” said the girl in a whisper, still terrified that someone would hear her despite her wards.
Both Rose and Harry ignored him at the best of their abilities. Why should they pay attention to that brat?
Within the first week of Rose taking Harry, Albus Dumbledoor realise that taking over the Potter's fortune and political standing was going to be harder than he previously thought. As it turns out, James never took the Potter Lordship and was even removed from even being considered a potential candidate. Charlus Potter, while a loving and caring father, was not blind to his only son's fault. James was rash, arrogant, spoiled and reckless; he didn't understood the true value of money and never made a sound investement in his short life. His eagerness to sell away the Potter town house, the cottage in Hogsmead and three-quarter of his fortune as the heir of House Potter to finance the Order of the Pheonix without so much a guaranty of return on the money or even a piece of the profit made it quite clear to Charlus that James was not fit to be the next Lord Potter. Therefor, in his will, he gave the Lordship, the fortune and the complete and total control of the Potter estates to his grand-child (regardless of it's gender). In the meanwhile, it would be Ragnok, the Potter's financial adviser at Gringot, that would managed the estates. No one could have access to anything other than the trust fund for Harry; most importantly, Albus Dumbledoor. Charlus Fleamont Potter made it quite clear that the seats and fortune of House Potter were never to be handled by the Headmaster of Hogwarts in any case or capacity what-so-ever.
Harry wasn't blind or stupid by any stretch of the word. He knew people had plans concerning his person and would resort to underhanded tactics to get what they wanted from him. It didn't matter what they wanted from him, money, fame, glory, political influence or power... They would never get their hands on him! He was no longer an heir; he was seventeen and an adult, he had gain his Potter Lordship, he had allies from France and the rest of Eastern Europe, he was a representative of a foreign country, regardless of the fact he was born on English soil. He had rights and he knew them like the back of his hand! No one was going to trap him and use him! Not the Ministry. Not the student population of the school. Not the trash that passed for the media in this country. Not the British society. And more importantly, not Albus Dumbledore!
Surprisingly, the man did not focus solely on Harry. He gave the same amount of attention to all three champions and showed no animosity towards anyone aside from Dumbledore. He did not fawn over Harry as Bagman did nor tried to get Harry alone with him like Dumbledore. In fact, he and Leeman were the only two British officials who showed any professionalism. They treated all champions with respect and equally.
“Oh, it definitely was a compliment! My cousin Isabelle assisted to the match and had near front-row seats. She said it was like seeing... Oh, what was it again? Ah, yes...
She quickly and discreetly (not really, it was pretty obvious) passed along the information to Ron and Ginny. All three couldn't believe their eyes. Ron couldn't believe that Harry Potter would sit and be friendly with slimy snakes. Obviously, Durmstrang had a bad influence on the bloke and it was Ron Wealsey's job... NO! Ronald Weasley civic duty to make sure that Harry Potter sees the light and becomes friends with good and light people, like him.
Immediately, the champion made his way to Lilianne and held his hand to shake hers. With a big smile, the French girl took the hand and offered her well wishes; then Harry did the same. The champion was absolutely excited to have been chosen and had never even thought that they could be. They had only entered because his friends had persuaded him to do so and had promised to do it with them.
So here is the next chapter. I am so sorry for the delay. Writer's block, personal events and work got in the way, but I finally have a chapter. Don't be afraid to tell me what you think of it and how the story could improve and as always... If you have ANY suggestions, I will always be open to them.
Draco had wished for a drama-free school year, but his wishes were ignored during the Yule break. During the traditional Malfoy Yule Ball, Narcissa had decided that it was time for Draco to appear on the market and had invited all the pureblooded witches of proper lineage (no muggle blood or poor people) and all the pureblooded wizards of marying age. It wouldn't have been too bad; his father was very strict and demanding of his suitor, so practically no one was good enough for Draco. Less time dancing and chatting with utterly borish and pretentious brittish fools. The only families who could really have a chance of being chosen were the Greengrasses, the Parkinsons and the main branch of the Zabini family. The Greengrass sisters did not care for Draco and he for them; if only Pansy and Ricardo felt the same.
Eveything was going well for the Boy-Who-Lived, until Alcazar stated that he could not return next year due to his father's monetary problems. Apparently, Ricardo Zabini had not digested the idea of being pranked well and had targeted his opponent's friends as a mean of revenge. Furious and disgusted, Harry sent a Howler to the Zabini shit and challenged him in a duel. If Harry won, then Ricardo had to give him the presidency of the company that Alcazar's father worked for; if Ricardo won, Harry had to marry the other boy's sister and let HER have complete and utter control of all his inheritance. Not stupid, the ravenheaded boy sent letters to his uncles and told them to write new wills to take him out as their heirs should he lose. Just to be on the safe side.
“Malfoy has a good chance to become the Beauxbâtons champion, but the one witht he most chances is his friend Lilianne Lacoursière. She is the most skilled and the valedictorian of her year for the last four years. As for Malfoy's best subject, it would be languages and potions. Beauxbâtons doesn't have a Head Boy or Head Girl; they have Year Councils.”
“If I send a letter refusing Hogwarts, Ragnok will still have to deal with the Ministry. One way or another, he will have trouble because of it. So, I'll write a letter on a truth paper. That way no one can say that I was influenced or pressured into going to another school and everyone will see that I don't care about Hogwarts or Britain's opinion.” said Harry, determine to own up to his decision with maturity. “I'll just make sure to send it at the very last moment to make sure that they will have the worst trouble to send someone to convince me otherwise. And if we just so happened to be out of the country on a family trip together... Well it's not like it's bad parenting if Ragnok and you guys bring me to another country to ''
Many had trusted Gorgowitz without questions simply due to the fact that he had been at the school for longer than anyone and as a veteran, they instantely believed his words.
“If you are my guardian angel, than I might not be too upset with dying.” purred Harry with the Potter trademark sexy smirk.
It shocked Dumbledoor, but it shocked the Brittish Wizarding World even more. A goblin in charge of an heir to a Most Ancien and Noble House? What sort of madness was this? The ministry (at the urging of the Chief Wizard of the Wizengamot) tried to overturn Charlus Potter's will; to no avail. The will was legal and accepted by none other than Minister for Magic, Alcazar Drimwald. The brave minister who had duel to the death Lord Voldemort when he was rising in force in the late 60's. This will was irrivocable and no one was willing to start a war with the Goblin Nation over the matter. So the purebloods and Dumbledoor bit their tongues and accepted this horrible decision with sour smiles.
The Hogwart students were blasé. They did not know that she was a muggleborn and they did not care that she was French. She was going to fail to the might of Hogwarts champion. The only true competition was Durmstrang and that was only because they had Harry Potter.
“Three, you will be allowed to bring your wand and anything else that YOU and only you have built for the Task. This will show us your skills in Magic. Now, we all know that cheating is as much a tradition of the Tournament as the Goblet itself. So, if you find out what the Task is all about and wish prepare potions or objects to help you, you are allowed to. We encourage you to do so. You cannot bring in people or outside help however.”
As Harry was making his way to his quarters, Headmaster Anker called out to him and asked him to meet in his office. Curious, but knowing that any questions would be answered, Harry made his way to the captain's quarter and sat down on one of the chairs. Soon, the Headmaster and the rest of the staff that had came with the delegation entered the office and sat in front the Head's desk. Understanding that this was a serious meeting, the dark haired youth wondered where the other Elites were. Surely, if it was so important that it could not wait until morning, the others would have to be warned.
Everyone stayed silent and turned their attention to the french students arriving; many hoping to see how well the french students fared in the cold climate of Scotland. It was well known that the Beauxbâtons Academy for Magic was in the south of France, therefor the students were not used to cold weather and would no doubt be freezing.
While his plans were not going as he had wished them, they were not completely ruined. There was still hope. He could still win back his pawn and his glory. If only that Petunia bitch had simply listen to him and not given the boy away. Curse her and her sister to hell!
Headmasters were extremely strict and tolerated no form of disobedience or dishonorable conduct from their students. Especially between students of opposite gender. Durmstrang had a very small female representation; however, the school made sure that NONE of their male students was ignorant in the proper etiquette. One of the most important lessons taught, by the school and Uncle Alexander, was that a gentlewizard does not hide himself away with an unmarried and unchaperoned young woman in a room. As such, it was quite the dilemma for Harry when Ginevra Weasley pulled him into an abandoned classroom for a “chat”.
Harry knew that Ginny had no bad or romantic intentions towards him. They had gotten along this summer at her brother’s wedding and he knew that she was head-over-heels for Blaise Zabini. She had talked his ears off about how much she loved the Italian young man. Ginny seemed nervous and worried, constantly looking at the door, throwing detection and silencing charms like candy during muggle Halloween.
The next morning, Draco took a long shower, went down to breakfast with his parents. Thankfully, neither of his parents ever found out about his wild night; it would not have been pretty if they had. His father may have understood even if he would most certainly disapprove; his mother... Best left unsaid! Hopefully, she will never find out.
Here is the fourth chapter. It's longer than any I have written so far, so please forgive me for the mistakes. Leave me your thoughts and ideas. I'm currently trying to find a way for Draco and Harry to meet. It has to be love at first sight and Harry is the dominant partner in the relationship. Any ideas?
Narcissa refused to listen and ordered her son to be courteous and respectful to the man when he would come and spend the day after tomorrow with him. Draco frustrately replied that he had plans and homeworks to do for his OWLS. Narcissa waved them off as unimportant and told him to be grateful someone still wanted him after that scandal with the french cad. Draco replied bitterly that nobody talked about it except the Parkinsons and that only fools believe what the Parkinsons gossip. Besides, this was HIS life, HIS decision, HIS future, not hers. He would choose whom he allowed to court him and not her. Narcissa lost patience and demanded that he stopped acting like an ungrateful child and man up for once in his life and to stop embarrassing her in society. Bad enough that he had been baited by some french tart, then dumped by a french cad, but he had the audacity to parade around Beauxbatons with a french half-breed and a french mudblood? Did he have any ideas what people in Britain were saying or how it made the Malfoy family look? How it made HER look? Her, Lady Malfoy? Draco simply replied with a furious, but calm voice that he was the heir to the Malfoy family, that he would one day that over his father and that he would be in charge of his life, his future and his aliances. SHE, Narcissa, was born a Black, not a Malfoy! A Black! She had no say in the ruling of the Malfoy House! She was there to give birth to an heir, just like any other Lady Malfoy before and to come. Draco proclaimed that unless Lucius forced him to be courted by Ricardo Zabini, he would never allow that filth to ever come so much as a foot close to him. He would have the friends HE wanted, unless the current Lord Malfoy, head of the family, told him otherwise. He would do as he please and Narcissa had no say in it.
From now on, Narcissa would be removed to a small cottage in a remote part of Germany with one house-elf until the divorce was finalise. He couldn't deal with her anymore. Her disrespect, her arrogance, her defying his position, her constant disregard for his autority in his own home (by that, he meant, her allowing people he had never met before into the heart of the family manor without his knowledge even after he told her not to)... She was to leave tonight and not come back. The divorce would be happening and if she dared to stall by not signing the papers immediately after receiving them, he would then call forth their marriage contract that stated that Narcissa had to give at least an heir and a spare to the Malfoy family. Only his love for his wife had kept him from forcing it upon her. By refusing to have another child after Draco, she had broken the contract. An annulment for breaking marriage contract was far more damaging to a reputation than a simple divorce, after all.
Blaise barely payed attention to the redheaded ogre that passed for a human that was his girlfriend's brother. How the hell someone as strong, beautiful and kind-hearted as Ginevra Weasley could possibly be related to something as vile as Ronald Weasley? The dark-skinned italian young man turned towards Granger and took a deep sigh.
Questions: 3- Do you have any good pick-up lines or flirting ideas that Harry could use for Draco? and vice versa? I suck at this and since I am single, I have no idea of how to do the scenes.
Petunia nearly jumped out of her skin as she heard her husband coming out of the bathroom; in a panick, the woman looked around frantically to spot a hiding place for the child before her husband saw him. Her eyes fell on the cupboard under the stairs and her mind was made up. She barely had time to close the door before Vernon made it down the stairs. Hushering him to the kitchen, she prayed that the baby would stay silent until her man left for work. It didn't take long before Vernon left in his shiny new car.
“A bit of both, but very different. The school is divided by three tiers. When a student arrives in at Durmstrang, they are placed in the first tier that is called the Recruits. This tier is comprised of first and second years. They are the youngest and are always mentored by students in the second tier. The Recruits are given a lot of time to adjust and help to make sure that they don't have any trouble and can follow the course load. The second tier is called the Cadets. This tier groups the third, fourth and fifth years. The third years don't have to mentor any students since they have to adapt to have elective and being without a mentor for the first time. The fourth years are given a first year to mentor them and they continue to do so in their fifth year when their charges enter second year. The last tier are called the Officers. This is the sixth and seventh years of the school. They don't take care of younger years officially, but it's hard not to for them. In the third tier, there is something like the Head Boy or Head Girl. But, instead of being just two students, it's more f a group of five of them. They are known, for lack of proper term, as the Elite. Only the best studetns, with multitple duels and seventh years can be part of the group. They basically have the same responsibilities and duties as Granger and Weasley, but each of the elite are lieutenants on board of one of the five warship the school has. They are the second in command to the teachers who act as the captain. The main warship, the
Harry woke up later that evening to his Uncle's terrified face. After berating his foolish, but heroic nephew, Alexander started telling him that Alcazar was safe and that he barely remembered what had happened. Karkaroff had been fired and arrested for his role in all of this when it was found that he had hid his employee's abuse of his students. Many other students, graduates and current alike, had come forward to tell their stories. They had send their gratitude to the young man for standing up and finally ridding the world of that miserable filth. Many teachers were shocked and appalled that they had helped the problem rather than helped their students. The news made the headlines of all the European continent; everyone knew what had happened and how Harry had saved his friend from a monster. So much for staying hidden!
After being honorably discharge from Her Majesty’s Royal Navy, Rose found herself with practically nothing. All her life she had trained and worked towards a career in the military and after only two years, she received a bullet in the arm. The result was that her dominate arm had lost 17% of its strength, which meant that her career ended on the spot. The military refused to allow her to stay on active duty and she did not have the education to have a desk bound job. It had been a dark and depressing moment in her life. No job, no experience other than the military and not place to live since all three sisters had decided to sell their parent’s house after their deaths.
Why twenty-one instead of seventeen? Because at seventeen, you are a child that still make stupid mistakes that could impact the future. You just got out of Hogwarts and now, with all the money you could possibly dream of and little to no supervision, you would most certainly spend it all on frivolous things. Furthermore, at seventeen, you were more influencable than you would be at twenty-one. At twenty-one, you have more experience in the real world. You have a better graps of responsibilities and you had time to make mistakes and learn from them. It wasn't ideal, as you could still make mistakes, but at least the purcentage was significantly lower.
The real problem was Severus Snape, Head of Slytherin House and Potter-hatter. Would he keep his mouth shut or would he go directly squealing to the Headmaster? The man had spent the entire summer complaining and grumbling about the idea of having mini-James Potter in school. He often said that he would rather face off a hippogriff herd than put up with the insufferable spoiled brat that Harry Potter would no doubt be. So maybe he would keep it a secret, just so Dumbledore didn't try and succeeded in bringing Harry to Hogwarts through his machinations. Besides, the child didn't need to be harrassed or bullied by a teacher, no matter what his father had done as a teenager. Furthermore, the young man was ambitious and had dreams; he was quite cunning to have sent his letter only a day before the deadline, thus giving him more time to prepare himself and less to his opponent. Snape was known to favor his snakes, since no one was on their side. He, however, valued and encouraged any and all students who had ambitions and was willing to work for it; just look at the annotations on the Weasley twins homework that helped them find books to better themselves and build their dream joke-shop. From potions to Runes to charms to economy to management to law, the twins owed much to the book references that Snape gave them. Harry showed some cunning, ambition and determination to achieve his dreams. It was something Snape could respect (albeit grudgingly) and so he would help the boy in his ambitions.
Before Blaise could sit with the rest of Slytherin House, Granger still had one more question to ask. How did he know so much about the other schools? Blaise simply replied that he had many cousins that attended the two schools and that he was the only one of the Zabini clan to have ever attend Hogwarts. Satisfied, Granger let him go and made her way to her table.
As for Ginny, she couldn't believe her friend had come to England after telling her the danger the Ministry and gold-diggers were to Harry's health. The young woman knew perfectly well that her mother had been pushing and plotting for years to have her marry the young heir of three ancient and noble houses, but Ginny had no interest in him. She loved Blaise with all her heart and was happy with him, she didn't want any other man. And yes, she was young and had all her life ahead of her and maybe her relationship with Blaise was just a teenage romance, but she was HAPPY!!! She was happy and didn't want to throw that away to become some trophy wife for a guy, she knew was gay, just so her mother and her parasite of a brother could get their hands on the boys money and influence. While, it was true that both Harry and Blaise were supportive of her dream of becoming a fashion designer and neither of the two cared or were against a woman working, she wanted to achieve her dreams with Blaise.
