a bit.
“Yeah,” Draco shrugged and then handed the cigarette to Harry to finish it off. “But when we
They lay together for a while, content and half asleep before Harry asked, “Want tea?”
“Babe! Have you seen my hoodie?” A yell came from upstairs, and Draco winced at the volume. How someone so small could be so loud, he would never know. Although, Harry did fill out over the last few years. Case in point, his hoodies were larger than Draco’s despite his superior height.
“Oh. Oh… Yeah,” Harry nodded slowly and slid lower into the couch so more of his legs were touching Draco’s. “I still see a Mind Healer once a month. Do you need a recommendation? ‘Cause mine’s great. She’s a squib and she studied both muggle and magical and –“
Draco laughed loudly and then gripped the sink to prevent himself from falling when he slipped on the wet floor. Harry caught his upper arm and pulled him to sit on the edge of the tub next to him.
will be so sappy they will beg us to stop. No one is going to doubt that you are
“Okay…” Draco said, only slightly bemused. “But you already fell for me? Without a love potion?”
Draco laughed and pulled him closer, careful not to grip the clover in his hand too tightly. Harry kissed him readily after pulling himself onto Draco’s lap and for a while, there was nothing but the sun, the scent of wildflowers, and the feeling of their lips, soft and tender against one another.
They shared smokes before. At other parties. At unrelated common grounds. And like always, they were currently talking about leaving for a shag before coming back to get properly drunk, so it wasn’t like there was any chance of heavy topics here. It was safe territory. Familiar.
“No.” Harry had a difficult relationship with snakes. On one hand, they had been his only companions during long gardening sessions before he knew he was a wizard. On the other hand, basilisk and Nagini soured their reputation spectacularly. Not to mention the whole Duelling club disaster and how negatively everyone reacted to him being a Parselmouth.
“I just wanted to impress you,” Draco muttered with a pout. Harry couldn’t help but grin at how cute he was despite his awful mood.
“Are there ants?” Draco repeated. “You keep brushing off the grass.”
“Like right now!” Hermione said in triumph, and then her gaze softened as she took his hand in hers. It was partly for comfort and partly to keep him in place now that the whole thing was coming together.
“So you could use my awesome hot body for your pleasure?” Harry asked and leaned forward, intending to steal a kiss.
Harry tilted his head towards the large bath, considering before nodding. “I could.”
“You have no idea how wrong that sounds,” Harry commented and then added, “And I don’t abandon you! I go to work! Not all of us can just add an extra room to the house and seclude ourselves for 20 hours a day like some Merlin-forsaken dungeon bats we used to know!”
“Okay. I can do that,” Harry said and nodded as his cheek rubbed against Draco’s silk pyjamas. “I
Harry’s shoulders slumped. “Look, Draco, I – I don’t think I can do this whole fuck buddy thing anymore.”
“Isn’t that weird? That we’re best friends now?” Harry asked and took a sip of his butterbeer. They were sitting on the floor of Harry’s living room, or rather Harry was sitting on the floor while Draco was lying down, staring at the ceiling, and questioning his existence.
“You know,” Harry said, passing back the cigarette to him, “We’ve known each other’s for years and I don’t think we’ve ever had a proper conversation.”
“And what’s the going on
They sat in silence for a moment and then Harry cleared his throat, getting Draco’s attention.
“Draco?” Great, now Harry was concerned about his wellbeing. He sighed and pulled himself up, face to face to the Boy Wonder.
“I had a session today and we talked, um, about stuff,” Draco said before cursing under his breath, feeling slightly pathetic. “We talked about you and how we started dating and I had some concerns –“
“Oh yeah?” Harry raised his eyebrows as he pushed Draco’s mile-long legs off a patch of the couch so he could sit down. “Maybe I should stop wearing it altogether then. You can have it all to yourself.”
“I agree with you,” Draco said quietly and then somehow managed to pull himself lower on the couch despite Potter’s overwhelming weight on top of him.
“You should have dropped that subject when you had the chance, Ron,” she said completely unapologetically.
“Another one or are we leaving?”, he asked, and Harry reluctantly took out another cigarette. He lit it with a single touch, still no wand in sight, and Draco really felt like he was going to be the death of him. Leaving was looking more and more appealing by the minute.
“Which one?!” he yelled back, hoping Harry heard him.
Hermione looked up at them from where she was making notes from a book to Ron’s left.
“You impress me every day just by being here. And living with
“Are there ants?” Draco asked and popped another miniature treacle tart into his mouth. He wasn’t as big of a fan as Harry was, but he did like it. It was a good dessert. Especially in this miniature, picnic-appropriate form.
Harry laughed again and when Draco went to kick his shin once more, he caught his foot and pulled it in his lap, pressing circles into the exposed skin of Draco’s ankle.
“Yeah? Well, I’ll try not to leave you again,” Draco said and stepped back into their bedroom. Harry’s clinginess insured he was basically stuck to Draco’s body so leading him around the house was an easier feat than expected.
“I – did you just say you love me the way I love you?”
“So, you gonna give me the hoodie so we can go to Ron’s or do I have to find something else to wear?”
“Yeah, oh.”
Harry woke up to someone playing with the hair on the back of his neck and an occasional gentle kiss on his jawline. Knowing that that someone could only be Draco made him smile, even in his still dazed state.
“What do you mean it doesn’t matter, Ronald Weasley?! This is Harry’s wedding ring you’ve lost! His
“Are they idiots?”
direct in case he spooked and really fled. “Like… like Pavlovian effect. Have you heard of it?”
He sort of wished he’d just
“I think I’ll stay away from baking, for now, thanks.” Draco shook his head as he extracted himself from Harry’s arms. “It’s clearly not meant to be!”
“Of course, you did.” Hermione rolled her eyes. “Of course.”
“I told them you had some days off starting today and they let me go no problem.”
“I can and I will,” Ron said in a determined tone followed by a frown. “When Harry remembers that other people exist and he can’t just lock us all out to sleep in the common room, I will get my needed beauty sleep and quit complaining. Until then, deal with it.”
“Want a drink, Carla?”
Draco just smiled and quickly changed into his pyjamas all while keeping an eye on his husband. Once Harry was only in his underpants he summoned his nightclothes and sent them flying in Harry’s direction.
“That’s gross.”
“Look, I think that you don’t realise that you blush whenever, whenever this
“Sure. You also don’t hog the blankets.”
“You’re home early,” Draco remarked. “No paperwork?”
“Using me as a bodyguard, huh?” Draco chuckled.
“Close the door, the cold is getting in,” he muttered and then smiled as his order was obediently followed. Soon enough a hand was carding through his hair. He opened his eyes to see Harry sitting on the edge of the tub, still in his Auror uniform.
Harry snickered and pulled Draco even closer, unable to disagree.
He couldn’t speak Parseltongue anymore, but he did sometimes understand the snakes when they spoke. It was like he hadn’t heard or spoken the language in years so he only half-remembered it. But it didn’t matter – he wasn’t looking for a snake.
“Good night,” Draco snuggled closer into Harry’s chest and grinned when Harry yawned again.
“We will, Finnigan!” he yelled back. “Thanks for the suggestion!”
“I guess that works too,” she muttered to herself. While she hadn’t intended to induce a semi-inappropriate make-out session between Harry and his boyfriend, it did work as a wonderful coming-out technique. Happy that was done with, she turned back to homework and successfully removed her worrying about her best friend from her mind for at least a little while.
“Hello,” Draco replied with a grin. “Will you join me, love?”
“I heard you. I just have, er, trouble believing?” Draco murmured. “You didn’t just say that to make me feel better, right?”
She took a big breath before speaking and cleared her through. “I think, well, I think we should talk about Draco and you.” She looked at Harry seriously and hoped he wouldn’t run away. Maybe she should cast a subtle sticking charm to his shoes?
“’Cause you love me so much?” Harry asked and intertwined their fingers, holding onto Draco’s hands.
“Me too.”
and in my opinion that gives you less hoodie right than me.”
“Missionary.”
“Good,” Harry said and proceeded to snog the living daylights out of him. He was a good snogger.
“It isn’t about the primary education issue,” Harry shook his head and took a few steps back. “It’s not about any issue – it’s not about
“No. He welcomed the destruction. Git,” Harry sighed and curled closer around Draco’s body. “He told me something about how grief shows we can love or some nonsense.”
“Nooo, don’t leave!” Draco mumbled into the pillow previously occupied by Harry’s shoulders. He made grabby hands towards his boyfriend which only went to show how close to sleep he was. “I’m cold!”
“I’m still not following,” he muttered, but
Harry carefully entered, wary of both the temperature and the water spilling, but soon he was seated comfortably between Draco’s legs, settled against his warm body.
Draco said nothing for a moment, still trying to gather his bearings. Maybe this
“Not this uniform, babe. It looks like a cow chewed it and then they dried it and let me wear it,” Harry dragged his fingers through his hair and laughed. “I’ll be over in a mo’. Leave the Floo open for me.”
Draco had a mere second to cast a Stasis charm before his potion was beyond saving as a considerable weight jumped on his back. He cursed and waved his wand before peering carefully over the edge of his cauldron and sighing in relief at the paused process.
It was Weasley himself who slipped it to Potter’s tea that morning and while everyone was eagerly anticipating a love-struck reaction, no one could react from shock at seeing Potter start choking, unable to breathe.
“Mm, something like that.” With one last kiss, Harry snuggled against Draco and promptly, easier than even in recent memory, fell asleep.
“No, no thanks. I, um, have my own, um, Mind Healer,” Draco muttered. “I like mine.”
The solution to the tense and awkward atmosphere in their common room was therefore proposed when the aforementioned two weren’t in the vicinity. It really was supposed to be quick and simple. A short-term love potion with the life of just barely over an hour would serve as encouragement for Potter and Malfoy to settle their differences and, maybe, if they got to it,
! He told Blaise that Potter was the most oblivious person to exist in the Wizarding World and the bastard hadn’t believed him. Which led him to this clusterfuck of a situation.
He grabbed his wand and cast a quick cleaning spell on his shirt and his trousers, but the chocolate stains were still there, and the oil had spread too deeply to be taken out. Now outright panicking, he turned to the mess of bowls and pans and spilt ingredients all over the counters and the floor and the table. He could barely even see the sink!
“Er, two things. One, do you want us to cuddle when we talk because I would really appreciate it and two, is there anything, in particular, you want to talk about?”
“Okay,” Draco simply replied. “See you soon.”
The grin they shared was blatantly stating the opposite.
“Okay. I’m glad you like them.” Harry drew careful circles over Draco’s ankle, hoping that it helped Draco feel less nervous.
“Okay, good.”
“W-what about Draco and me?” Harry muttered, his eyes panicked. “There’s
“Good. Your cold feed woke me up a few times though.”
Now it was Draco’s turn to stare at
“Are you sure you didn’t see it?” Harry asked, now from the doorway, and Draco said nothing as he buried himself deeper into the hoodie, catching Harry’s scent.
The door of Draco’s room was locked and warded when she finally reached them, and she sighed in resignation. She didn’t know how she expected this wedding to go peacefully but a girl can hope. Despite the wards, the sound of two bodies hitting the door was very much clear and she made her exit before she saw something she wouldn’t be able to forget.
“I knew you married me for my body,” Draco sighed and leaned back against the bathtub.
“We haven’t really been playing it…”
“We’ll take it.”
Harry felt his eyes grow wet as he pressed a quick but firm kiss to Draco’s lips. “Always.”
Less than ten minutes later they were sitting on Draco’s couch opposite each other with their feet intertwined.
“Are you in love with me?” Draco asked slowly. “Is that what this whole ‘proper conversation’ thing was about?”
“I don’t know? Enlarge a pocket maybe?” Hermione said icily but when Ron said nothing to that suggestion she asked, “And what do you expect me to do now?”
“Harry, hey!” she called, loud enough that more than a few heads turned, but she didn’t care. She couldn’t miss her chance. “Can we talk for a moment?”
“I’m so sorry, Draco,” he said with an apologetic grimace. “I promise I’ll be right back. Give me two minutes – if I’m not back, come rescue me.”
“That prank went so wrong,” Seamus whispered to Nott as they all made their way to visit their favourite Golden Boy. Nott was just about to reply when Hermione stopped dead in her tracks, her wide eyes glued to Malfoy who was currently kissing Harry very gently. It didn’t look like a first kiss at all, and it was that which made her
“I can be as sappy as I want when I come back home to someone like you.” Harry looked at Draco upside down and grinned widely.
“Yeah,” Harry’s voice was hoarse, and he spoke slowly as if he was afraid he’d stop breathing again. “She said I’d have to stay overnight just in case something happens, but I should be completely fine.”
“Yeah?” The huge amount of hope in Harry’s eyes should have been gross but Draco could feel something unravelling inside him.
“You do?”
“I kinda do though,” Draco interrupted even though it took an insane amount of effort. He took Harry’s hand and carefully intertwined their fingers. He tried to make himself look vulnerable but the very idea of it was painful. He’d have to learn though. He’d put it on the bucket list –
Finally, it was Malfoy who moved, casting a nonverbal spell on Potter which had him taking deep breaths despite the choking. Malfoy then practically dragged him to the Hospital Wing where he proceeded to stay. For hours.
“Oh, I couldn’t, Miss,” Carla declined quickly. “I
get drunk together that one time and she felt so
“Let’s,” Draco nodded in agreement, trying very hard to ignore the blush that arose as soon as Harry touched his face so tenderly.
But just as he was starting to find his will to live again, the kitchen door creaked open, and Harry stood frozen at the doorway. “Draco… I – what?”
“I’m not one of your sycophants, Draco,” Harry said dryly. “Would it help if I snogged you?”
“Didn’t see it!” he said and flipped a page of a book he was reading. “Is it in the wash?!”
“I’ll forget about them when I stop having back pains from sleeping on the couch!” he shot back and then added, for good measure, “I didn’t save the world for
His heart skipped a beat when Draco’s head appeared in the fireplace. “Did I wake you?”
“You’re half asleep,” Draco remarked when Harry yawned after that kiss.
“It’s not a snake, is it?”
“I have
“Take care of that, Ron, please,” Harry said with a nervous smile and then turned to leave through the left hallway.
Harry hesitated. Draco looked back at him, and their eyes met.
“I said that that
“It’s nothing bad,” Draco reassured quickly. “At least, I don’t think it is. It might actually be very good when you think about it. It’s not bad. I’m not breaking up with you.”
for him afterwards.
“I…”, Draco looked behind himself for a moment before turning back to face Harry once more. “We need to talk.”
“Yes, you hit my chin with it, darling.” Draco took a hold of Harry’s shoulders and led him to sit down on their bed. “Can you take off your clothes for me or should I help you?”
They stared at each other for a moment, both heavily uncomfortable with the situation. Finally, Harry grimaced and shrugged his shoulders.
“Sure, honey, whatever you want,” Harry easily agreed and pressed a wet kiss to Draco’s clean cheek before fishing out his wand and starting up the clean-up.
“You can’t leave me ever again,” Harry said seriously and then leaned to kiss Draco, only to miss his mouth and kiss his chin instead, hitting his teeth.
“Yeah. You’re saving me even when you’re not there, babe,” Harry murmured and tilted his head up for a kiss, readily given.
“No, you wouldn’t,” Harry protested. “How could you possibly know it’s my favourite – we literally barely use it!”
“Me too,” Draco agreed and laid down next to Harry who yawned and pulled him closer until their legs were all tangled up.
“I’m sorry, what?!”
“Potter!” Draco grabbed his shoulders and Harry had the decency to look apologetic.
'You don't get to say that.  No one does.  He wouldn't be proud of me, not now, not ever.  Look at what I have become.  A pathetic excuse of a person, not even a wizard.  Spending my nights crying on Harry fucking Potter!  I'm a disgrace to the Malfoy name!'  Staring down at that plain cardboard box on the table, directing all his fury to it.  'I can't even touch a wand, what does that tell you?'  He swept his hand over the table with force, sending the box, and it's contents across the room, where it bounced harmlessly off the wall, sending a picture askew.  The wand tumbling to the floor.
Theo knew that would be easy to run.  Put his head down and skulk from the stormy hallway.  Potter would be none the wiser, and he could be long gone before Draco gathered his wits enough to tell of his tormentor.
That infectious giggle, like a hundred tiny glass bells, ringing the clear sound into the sad little room, sparking off the hard stone walls, shattering the fear, the terror lodged deeply in Harry's heart.
Harry had seen.  Seen all he wanted so desperately to protect him from.  There was no Dementor, no murdered parents.  There was no Voldemort for Harry.
It moved.  He could feel it slithering under his skin, when the dreams came, when he was alone.  It spoke to him, in his head.  Whispering black words, promises of pain, humiliation, words of rape, of curses.  Draco understood that there was to be no escape from the ownership lodged deep within his body.
Bracing weak, trembling arms beside him on the bed, Draco pushed against the yielding mattress, his fingers gripping handfulls of blankets in his effort to stand.
Nott dropped to the floor like a cheap marionette whose strings had been sliced through.  He watched as Potter reached towards the red headed Weasley, taking something from him, knowing from the startled look in the Saviour's eyes that he was already long forgotten.
He was darkness, pain and fear.  A Dark Mark.  No.  Harry couldn't be around someone like him.
Draco could feel the tension in Harry, could feel his body thrumming with anger he was trying to keep in check.
'I...  I didn't...  I didn't know.'  He stuttered, swallowing down his rising fear.  Merlin...  What had he done?  'I swear...  I didn't know.'  She gripped his arm, as if to ground herself, or perhaps to stop him from fleeing.  Whatever her aim, he was glad of her touch.  'Milly...'
He toed the dusty path with the tip of his boot, cast his eyes around the loosely clustered groups of students setting off for their day out.  All those laughing, smiling faces, not an obvious care in the world.  Exams could be forgotten, tests and potions and endless essays.
'When will you see that this is not good for you, Harry.'  Draco's head fell upon Harry's waiting shoulder.  'You shouldn't be here with me all the time.'
They had found out his scheming ways and unspeakable behaviour.  Even they, the brave and noble house could never forgive such wrong doings.
'Don't.'  He grit his teeth together hard, his jaw protesting under the pressure.  He didn't trust himself not to draw his wand against his friend.
He almost stopped him.
It was a pity that his help had surfaced too late for the couple on the floor.
Nott had done this to himself, Harry reasoned, his grip tightening imperceptibly.  The cruel boy from the House of Slytherin had brought that abomination upon Draco.  Had demanded he relive his very worst days, his secret spilled for all the school to see.
'No!  You don't get get to explain, not now.  You had your chance.  You ditched my little sister.  You ditch the team.  You didn't come home for Christmas, I never see you anymore, and now you are defending that piece of shit!'  He pointed to Draco.
He had thought Draco was going to die in his arms, why could they not see?
Harry stood mutely beside the bed, trying not to look at Draco's body, trying not to remember the events of last night, the imagined images of torture that must have brought about his injuries.  He wanted to touch him, to be close to him once the potion was put onto his split skin.  But it wasn't done.  Yes, Draco wanted him to stay, wanted him near.  But surely that did not extend to touching him?
But Hagrid would doubtless be the one to find him. The big, gentle giant who had already cried enough tears over him.  He would take him up in his huge arms, careful and caring, even though it would be too late.  He would carry him back to his home, lay him on his bed and cover him with a fur blanket.  Again.
Just him.  Alone, tortured and bleeding.  And left to die in front of his very eyes.
It was all he had.
Perhaps tomorrow he would try again.
Harry knew Draco was clasping his hands tightly behind his back not out of stiff standing, but out of fear, fear that every pair of eyes would notice his constant tremble.  He could see the unshod tears, he could see the set of his jaw, and the way he shifted imperceptibly.  He could see the pain radiating from him.
The card shone brightly as Ron wiped away the worst of the grime from the golden frame.
'Harry...  Please...'  It was Ron.  Standing beside him, a mockery of understanding and concern, his hand already warm and squeezing him gently.  'Don't do this.'
He waited, waited an eternity for Seamus to say those four little words that would change everything.
'No.'
Harry.
'I...I didn't feel it before.  When you put it on me, because...because you were near.  I though the magic was in you.'
'I honestly don't.'  He raised his hands in supplication.  'But I've been watching him too.'  They continued to look on in silence from the corner of the crowded shop as Harry took his purchases over to the till.
'You saw me.'  Draco swallowed.  'I...  I was your nightmare.'  How could Harry bear to touch him after seeing that?  How could he stand to be so close and say those words?
'You need a bed, a bath.  I'm going to have to give you a full examination.  To be able to care for you, you have to be inside the castle.'
'I may not know what I need, but I know what I want.'  Harry spoke softly, following Draco's gaze across the castle grounds.
House arrest in some squalid little abode, his wand confiscated, his only companion a sullen House Elf that had better things to do than wait on his sorry excuse for a life.
'You'll drink?'
She would never touch him in quite the same way again.
'Theo, we have to go to the Great Hall.'  Milly whispered back, leaning closer still as students and there unending curious gazes streamed past.  'Professor McGonagall...'
It would happen again, and as soon as he pushed them back onto his face, he was assaulted with clouded vision once more.
It was almost like he had never left.  The bed where he had been placed still standing in the corner, the fire banked and burning brightly.  Draco could feel the stirrings of memory.  The pain of being against those sheets, the rough wool against his open back.  The fear of closing his eyes, the terror of being touched again.
'You don't always have to keep to the corners.  You have as much right to be here as anyone else.'
Murderer.  He was a murderer.
There were no pictures of his parents, no half remembered letters or gifts.  No graves to visit or house to grieve in.  No childhood toys or clothes that smelled like home.  Nothing that spoke of his past life, only the one he had now.
Draco knew, deep within his heart that he had done the right thing, the only thing he could do.
Draco shook when Harry drew his wand.  So many memories consuming him, almost pulling him back.
'I can come back later?'
Ron watched.
Then he was gone, retreating back into the classroom like nothing had happened, leaving Draco gasping for breath, his knees weak, his skin pebbled with cold dread.
'I didn't save you.'  Harry whispered.
'Perhaps one day.'  Was his whispered reply.
Neville found him slumped against the open trunk, the letters still in his cold clenched fist.  Tears still falling to the floor.  The boy had cried a river, his chest heaving, his entire body trembling, struggling to breath.
'I have to.'  Draco repeated, the pain holding his body in it's deathly grasp, his chest heaving from the effort.  He knew if Harry was not there, touching him, he would surely have given into the darkness of oblivion.  It hurt.  It always hurt.
'Is there a point to this story, Finnigan?'  Even Ron had started to glaze over.
They didn't hear it.
Even if it was at the expense of his own dignity.
'Almost.'  Draco quirked a humorless smile, laying his head upon Harry's shoulder.  'I'm never quite good enough.'  He finished with a sigh as his eyes closed.
Warm water cascaded down his shoulders, pooled at his feet.  Helping somewhat to ease muscles that had been coiled tight for days.  Keeping his nocturnal life with Draco a secret was never going to be easy.  But Harry knew that there was no other option.  Draco was not ready to face the world.  And perhaps he never would be.  It was better like this.  Just the two of them against the nightmares, the tears and the painfilled recovery.
'What if someone comes in?'  He asked, staring at the door that had only opened for the two of them that day.
Lonely was climbing into his own bed, with all the comforts the day had brought.  A full belly, a warm place to sleep, the sound of people snoring.  He had everything he had ever wanted.
'What do you think?'  Draco grinned, drawing Harry ever closer.
Be that nightmares of voices, imaginations of thirst, empty growls of hunger.  The wands again, always the wands.  And now the corridor.  The Boggart who was able to be everyone and everything all at once.
His eyes followed her as she cast her head this way and that, never once lighting in his direction.  He was sheltered here, under the shadow of the castle.  Perhaps unsurprisingly, his feet had taken him right back to where he had first led Draco so many months ago.  To watch the stars.
He pealed off his sodden clothes, dumped them in an untidy heap on the tiled floor and snatched up a towel.
'You love Quidditch, you love being the Captain.  I know you do.'
'Thank you.'  Harry said, once they were out of earshot.  'I couldn't think of anything to say to them.'
'You need to be sleeping.'  Harry informed him.
'Honestly, I can't believe it!'  Harry was indignant, huffing out his exasperation.  'I'm going to find out who made this and write a strongly worded letter.'  Once again turning the card, his own surprised face blinking up at him.  'It's not funny!'
Control, ownership. Pain and domination.  They were the only things he knew, were the only things his body had ever experienced.
Pain.  Washing over him, turning his world black.  Almost passing out.  Sucking in sharp gasps of air through clenched teeth that did little to combat the sudden nausea.  He would have fallen if it were not for Harry keeping a tight hold of his sweating hands.
'You should sit down.'  Careful hands guided him to a chair.  'Shall I fetch someone?'
'You need to look at it from their point of view, Harry.  I'm a Slytherin, a Death Eater...'
He allowed himself to sink into sleep, believed that this new journey for his friend would be a one off, a bout of temporary insomnia.
But he had to go.  McGonagall's excuse would only last for so long.  Ron and Hermione would come looking eventually.  They would find him here.  They would find Malfoy.
He would wait for time to turn itself around, for that drafty London platform to appear from the fog of screaming, the blood and the glass, the broken ink bottles and the boy sobbing.
'You are perfect, Draco.'  Harry tilted his head, pressed a kiss to blond hair.
'Do you not like it?  Me touching you.'
The Ministry had bigger concerns.  A wizard such as him could be overlooked.  And Nott was counting on it.
There was still work to be done, there were still hallways to patrol.
'I didn't tell anyone.'  Harry shrugged his shoulders.  'Ron's parents treat me like one of their own, and it feels like I have a family when I am with them all.  But...  They are not mine, you know?  I never had a family of my very own.  I never had someone to...to...'  He stopped suddenly, and Draco could feel his hair wet with Harry's tears.
'I...I am.'  He closed his eyes, Harry's Quidditch worn fingertips careful in their silent exploration.
'No.'  He shook his head, determined.  'It's mine.  It's all my fault.'
Wherever he turned he was reminded of Harry, and all he had left behind.
'T...thank you.'
'I know.'  She took his hand, twining their fingers together.  'I know.'
Strange how Draco had been the one all along.
'It's nothing much.'  Harry shrugged away Draco's question.
He had to tell himself that it wasn't how it was, not now.  Draco was better, much better.  He had only gone to see the gentle giant, only wanted to give his thanks.  But Harry felt he should be the one to thank Hagrid.  His first ever friend had already given him so much, and now he had delivered Draco from the clutches of death.
He finally breathed when he saw that everyone was still where they should be.  Hunched over bubbling cauldrons, caught up in conversations. The sound of footsteps must just have been his damaged mind playing tricks.
The memory of Malfoy limping from the common room, barefoot, with tears running down his cheeks.  The memory of Harry, his best friend, looking crushed by the words spat at him, the rejection, the distrust.  They all burned a hole in his empty stomach.
'Draco, no.'
'What's wrong?'
'Don't do this.'  Harry shook his head.
'Yes, I do, I did.  But...'
'Did...did you mean it?'  He had to ask, had to know.  'That you...you want this.'
'Are you quite sure you are ready?'  She asked, sitting herself on the bare mattress, wanting to reach out and touch the lonely child.  But she wouldn't.  She knew how it was.
'Harry, you don't know what you are saying.'  Draco felt his heart contract.  He wanted that too, how he wanted to just take Harry's hand in his, lead him from this castle full of ghosts.  They could be happy.  Couldn't they?
'Oh no, but he is not returning to Slytherin.'
'Ron!  No.  I...I didn't know anything.  I swear.'  She held up her hands. 'How would I have known?'
Death nothing more than an amusing jape at his expense.
He kept hurting him. He was the one who left him, day after day.  He was the one who had forced him to drink the poisoned water.  He was the one who had listened when Draco said to go.  That he needed to take a break, that he needed to sleep, to eat, to concentrate in his lessons.  And he had the nerve to call himself Draco's friend.
'I'm getting to it!'  Seamus allowed a grin to split his face.  'Anyway, Justin was looking for Madam Pomfrey.  He had come off his broom, thought he might have broken a finger...'
'No...Not the dark place.'  Draco trembled, his mind fracturing.  'Don't.'
Harry eyed up his Invisible Cloak, but figured the added danger of getting caught out of bed in the night might be more fun.  Slipping out of the portrait hole, quiet as a ghost, Harry set off for a nocturnal stroll.
Dean had spoken to him, was considering asking Ginny to become his fiancé.  It was fast, they were still so young.  But after the War, after everything, why wait?  Why not grab life with both hands and run with it.
'No.'  His word was final.  'It's this way or nothing.  Harry's knows that, this is the agreement.  He and I are not friends out here,'  He waved his hand weakly.  'It wouldn't work, it wouldn't be understood.  Harry needs his friends.  They are the only family he has left.  I am not going to take that from him.'
His eyes darkened with black bruises.  His once perfect lips cracked and bleeding.  His jaw broken, twisting at an unnatural angle, sparse blond stubble did nothing to hide the pain it must be causing.  His hair was matted with filth, and where it was missing there were bloody patches, his hair ripped out at the scalp.
It was worth it.
What if he were to fall so deeply?  What if his eyes closed, and it was all too late?  They would be caught.  They would be pinned in the horrified gaze of so many pairs of eyes.  All looking, all watching.  Harry knew he didn't care.  Let them all see the truth, let them watch and dare to pass remark.
'Ron...  He was wrong, he was being mean.  He doesn't understand, he doesn't know you.'
Reaching for the handle at his back, his grin wide and cruel.
Draco shook his head, squeezing his eyes tightly shut, refusing to allow his tears to escape.  'Don't do this, Harry.  Don't make me promises that you will have to break.  I...I cannot give you anything, I am not the person you need in your life.'  His voice tight, dry, lest he should break down and lean into Harry, beg him for just a moment of calm.
'I've left my book outside.'  Harry had to think fast, had to get rid of Filch and that blasted cat of his.
His darling Mummy.
'Have you been sleeping?'  She ignored him.
He couldn't breathe, couldn't make his voice work.  His heart pounding, his own arm throbbing at the imagined pain that press must make.  That thin trail of blood that caught the light, shining wetly against his skin, bisecting the darkness Malfoy would always wear.
'Draco?'  A whisper broke free, Harry stepping minutely closer, his footsteps rasping on the hard stone floor.  Draco flinched, his breath stopping, the tears stuck in his throat.  They had come back for him.  He had to stay quiet, vanish into the darkness.  They might leave him alone.  They just might.
'And Potter will follow.'  Pomfrey smiled for the first time that morning.
'I can see enough.'  Ron spoke, his words surprisingly steady.  'I don't need to look any more.'  He took a step, books crunching under his foot.  'I see you.'  Hermione went to touch him, to offer some comfort.  'Don't.'  He barked at her, roughly shoving her away.  'I bet you knew, didn't you!'  He snapped, turning his venom against her.
'No.'  Draco was quick to halt Harrys jerky attempt to leave him.  His hands pressed into Harry's back, drawing him close again.  'Not for me.  For you.  My...my skin.  I must feel horrible to you.'
'Don't.  Please, Granger.  Please just...  Don't be kind.'  He had to look away, fixing his eyes on the desk before him, on the words swimming across his battered textbook.  'Please.  Go.'  He could hear himself babbling, moments away from breaking down entirely.  Why were the voices always so close?
But Draco lived.
'What?'  Confusion twisted his face into a frown as he opened his eyes.  Harry was standing beside the bed, the dressing gown held open in his hands.
'Tell me what to think then, Harry.  Because from here it appears to be exactly what I am thinking.  Sneeking out in the middle of the night to spend it in his bed.'
He should have stepped in.  He should have walked into that Potions cupboard and took the glass from Draco's trembling hand.  He should have sat down beside him, put his arm around his shoulders and begged him to cry.
'I'm shutting up for the night.'  She told him, almost kindly.  Pausing as she considered her next words.  'I can walk you back to wherever it is you want to go.'  Her quick, curious glance told her that the fresh piece of parchment he had unrolled hours ago remained exactly that.  Blank.
There was no sympathy, no feeling, as the boy was dropped unceremoniously, naked, shivering, dying, onto the cold hardened floor of the Forest.  The figure in black stalked away without a backwards glance.
'I'd say that has changed, don't you think?'
'Draco is ready.'  Madam Pomfrey informed her.
'It's got nothing to do with you.  Or anyone else for that matter.'
His eyes flickered, Draco forcing them to part, to finally look into the darkness.
'I'm ruining your life, Harry.  One day you will see me for what I truly am.'
'You okay?'  He crouched down, not listening to the excited chatter that now filled the room.
'You kept it,'  Harry whispered into Draco's skin.  'The card.'
'I'm too broken.'  Draco whispered, his eyes filling with tears, unable to look at the boy sitting beside him.
Things would soon fall back into their rightful place.  Harry would return to his usual life, as of course he should.  And Draco, well, he reasoned that things would be very different from now.  He wouldn't return to Slytherin, Harry had been right about that.  He couldn't.
His name was scrawled on the folded page, torn hastily from a notebook.  Its edges ragged, the black ink barely dry.  He hadn't been gone long, Harry thought, feeling sick to his stomach.  He had been stupid, careless.  Sleeping when Draco had been feeling so very terrible, so alone.
'But...'
Nothing at all.
They had all taken solace in the mundane, the cliché of their old ways.
Draco had always though the idea absurd.  How could a person be a home?  How could someone make you feel safe?
'Does your father know what you became, Malfoy?  Your perfect mother?  Is that why they have fled?  Too ashamed to know they have raised a traitor.  A whore who fucks his way through the teachers to get what he needs?  Who's next, Malfoy?  Who are you going to drop to your knees for after Slughorn?'
'I don't think so.'  She replied thoughtfully, her finger marking her place within the book as she momentarily closed it.  She couldn't stop her mind straying back to Malfoy and the encounter from Potions that morning.  'I think Malfoy is going to leave him alone.'
It had been Harry. Neville watched him through one eye.  Harry wouldn't know, too preoccupied in being quiet.
'I...  I did it.'  There, the truth was out.  Spilled from bitten lips, from a voice filled with sorrow.  He had been foolish to think for one moment that he would be able to hide this miserable secret.  The pretty glass still sitting in his pocket, pooled onto the floor of the damp bathroom.  Calmly waiting, patient for the opportunity, for the privacy Draco knew would be his.
'No.'  The headmistress cut her off decisively.  'I will see to Draco's needs myself.  I shall also address the school in a moment.  But you will all have to wait.  My only concern is getting Draco comfortable.   There will be time for explanations later, I can assure you of that.'  McGonagall's angry determination spoke volumes.
They would talk in whispers into the early hours, until sleep claimed them both.  Until Draco would wake from another nightmare.
'I'm not surprised.'  Draco laughed humorlessly.  'I am a bastard who hates them all.'  He reached for him, tugged on his hand.  'Should you be here?'
'Yeah, difficult, you said.'  Ron snarled.  'But you never said why.  She used to cry over you, I would listen to her.  At night, when she thought she couldn't be heard.  You broke her heart, Harry.  And you didn't seem to care.'
'What do you want, Neville?'  Harry sighed, setting down his drink.  Their relationship was strained, civil, but not friendly.  Harry could not forget that he had spilled all of Draco's closely guarded secrets to the boy standing beside him.  He didn't blame Neville, it wasn't his fault.  It was purely his own doing, this was something he had to work through himself.
'Harry.'  A voice broke through the silence that continued around the common room.  Mouths agape in shock.  'Put down your wand.'  Neville.  Strong, steady Neville.  'Now, Harry.'  He was tugging on his arm, pulling at his jumper.  'Come on, it's all right.  Ron didn't mean it.  He's...he's upset.  Tell him, Ron.'
Harry bloody Potter stood beside her, fidgeting with the cuffs of his ratty jumper, his eyes downcast, staring anywhere but at him.  Then he did the unthinkable, raising his face to look at Draco, his green gaze meeting grey eyes.
He couldn't help but notice the old contents of Malfoy's broken bag now spilled across the floor, trampled over and ruined under uncaring shoes as he went to step away.
In his unfocused wandering, Harry had lit upon an uncovered patch of skin that Draco had not known was there.  Always so very careful to hide himself from Harry's view, he had allowed his top to ride up, just a little, just an inch.  It must have happened in his sleep, he didn't know, had been too careless in his movements.
'Not like last night.'  McGonagall told him gently.  'But it might be good for the boy if there was someone with him.  You were very brave to stay, Harry.'
'Harry...'  Hermione spoke gently.  'I think you should both go.  I'll...I'll talk to him.'  She nodded sadly, her palm already on Ron's shoulder.
'Look, Draco...'  She never got the chance to finish what she was about to say.
'It is enough for me.  And it is enough for Harry.'  She paused, allowing him a moment to collect himself, to wipe away his tears.  'Stay by the fire, see if you can get some rest.'  She rose gracefully, smoothing down her robes.  'I shall check on you later, and bring you something to eat.'
Or Professor McGonagall.  Would it be her?  Arriving with books under her arm, a ready smile on her usually stern face.  Only to find him, alone and silent under the water.
But the book on his lap was beyond beautiful, beyond anything he had ever held.  It's simplicity held a magic all of it's own, the golden embossed letters, the thick leather cover, the smell, the touch, the gossamer thin pages.
The slow fire began in his shoulders, spreading into his skin and causing his back to cramp with agony.
'She wasn't hurt.  I...I was so happy.  She...she would rescue me.'  A smile twitched Draco's tear stained lips, his eyes staring.  'Mother.  Please.'  A heart-wrenching sob that had Harry clench his teeth, almost afraid that he would start yelling for Draco to stop his shocking story, to scream at McGonagall and Pomfrey to get the Hell out.  But all he could do was listen.
'They are still at it you know, still slagging you off.'  Harry slumped down on the bed beside him, close.
The creak of old bedsprings had roused him from near slumber, the sound of feet hitting the bare wooden floor.  Someone was moving about the room.  He had cracked an eye open, annoyed at being disturbed when he was so close to rest.
He noticed that the blond was quick to pull his hand from where it covered Slughorn's, his pale face suddenly flaming.  So, caught in the act.  Nott's stomach lurched at the display.
'You won't let me.'  Draco answered.
'Yes, I grant you, that there had always been something remarkable about young Master Potter.'  His name making her smile.  'And yes, he has played a large, significant part in my, and in all of our lives, but that does not mean that you are not his equal.  That does not make you any less important to me.'
Darkness flooded his mind, that incessant hiss, thick like molasses, driping slowly into every pore, drowning him.  Down and down Draco spiralled  There was nothing left worth fighting for.
'No.'  Professor McGonagall agreed.  'He won't.'
'You too.'  Draco curled in closer, ready to listen once more.
Harry stood quietly in the doorway of the bathing room.  Watching silently, scrubbing a towel through his shower wet hair.
'And have word sent to the kitchens.'  McGonagall commanded.  'I want food and drink brought up to these rooms immediately.'
Mind made up, his heavy eyes cast downwards, he rounded the corner that would ultimately take him out of the Castle doors and onto the path that would carry him to Hagrid's home.
'Come on now,' Hagrid sniffed.  'I did nothing more than anyone else would have done.'
'No one will see you, Draco.'  Harry dropped the dressing gown around Draco's shoulders.  Pulling something from his back pocket, he proceeded to open an old piece of heavily creased parchment.  'Look.'  He set it down on Draco's legs.
'I...I...'  Harry couldn't get the words out, his wand hitting the floor in a shower of miscast sparks.  'I didn't...I wasn't...'  Harry looked on in dawning horror.  What had he almost done?  What had he become?
The blond boy slumped in a mess of glass and ink was only a figment, a trick of his overtired imagination.
'It has to be said.  I was a bully, a coward.  I do not expect anyone to see beyond that.  What...what happened to me doesn't change what I did to them, to you.  I can't ever be forgiven.'
'When you were a baby.'  McGonagall sighed as memories flooded her.
The man creature, his tormentor and torturer, the snake.  All his eyes would ever see in the darkness.
He had been on the very edge of sleep, his eyes drifting closed after a long week back at school.  Lessons crammed full of information that Neville realised he hadn't a hope in fully understanding.  Teachers eager and willing to put in all the effort required to get the returning students ready for the final exams, preparing them for that great wide world.
'It's not easy is it.'  He spoke.
'You will soon be missed by your fellow student's, Potter.'  McGonagall roused herself slowly with a cat like grace.  'Perhaps it is time you returned to the castle?'
He was meant to be tucked away somewhere with Draco.  Warm under piles of blankets, their shoulders touching, his fingers drawing lazy circles across pale skin.  Whispering, smiling, reading from whatever book Draco wanted.  They had all the time in the world to be together, it wasn't right, it wasn't fair.
Something wasn't right with the man with the long blond hair.
Tell them of Draco with a sneering contempt.  Tell them that he hadn't been thinking straight, that his head was in such a mess.  He was lost, that was all it was.  Alone.  Draco was there, had tricked him, been kind and caring.  Made him believe his lies and his games.  Of course it was wrong, of course the idea of Draco and he was anything but laughable.
'He...he found me.'
'I wish I had the answer, I wish I could tell you that it will all be all right.'  He softly.  'But you have to know that you are not alone, Draco.  I can't ever give you back all you have lost, I can't make it better for you.  But...but don't ever think that you are alone.'
'Never you mind.'  He grinned, shouldering his bag.  'You'll find out soon enough, anyway.'
'No, this is something else.'  Hermione shook her head, her knowing eyes not looking away.  'I wasn't there this summer.  I stayed home.  My...my parents wanted me there, I wanted them.  It was difficult.  But I did visit the Burrow.  It...it was horrible, Neville.  I couldn't stay there.'  She glanced to the floor, ashamed by her admission.  'It felt so empty without Fred.'  Hermione paused, searching for the right words.  'It felt wrong without him.'  Swallowing heavily, fighting against the memories.  'But they had a strength together.  Determination.  None more so than Harry.  But now?  Now I look at him and I'm not so sure anymore.'
'What...what if I am never ready?'  He stuttered, his feet retreating to the door, steadfast in his determination to not look at the wand that could never belong to him.
'You won't push yourself too hard, that you will take your time and not expect too much.  That you will let me help you.'
'Everyone?'
'I killed my parents.'
And when he did, Nott briefly felt his stomach give a funny little twist.
It was own face that stared at him.  Blinking rapidly, as self-conscious as always as the moving image of his hand scrubbed through unbrushed hair and looked around for an escape route from the golden frame of the Chocolate Frog card.
'Tell me, Draco.'
He had come across upon a book in the Library that might be of interest to Draco.  A novel by a Muggle author that he had liked, that he and Draco had yet to read together.
Tucked underneath his tower of pillows, ready to pull it from it's safe place the moment a nightmare brushed its razor sharp edges against his drowsy mind.  Harry's modest face, his almost grin, his deep green eyes...
Neville had seen red.  He had been so furious that he never paused to consider the reason why.  Had even asked if they were shagging.  No, he hadn't asked that at all.  He had asked if they were fucking.  There was a difference.
'Harry, we had to know.'
Knew that he would kill that monster, over and over and over again.
'Yes.'  His hands turning to fists.
Draco Malfoy, the child he had come to know, the one who was as suspicious and curious as himself, was leaning against a wall, his head bowed, his hands pressed to the rough stone for support.  Heaving, coughing and crying.
'Oh, tell us you speak the truth?'  The Fat Lady visibly deflated, gone was the air of panic that surrounded her.  'They say...  They speak of what they saw...'
All of that fell into deep and bitter memories as pain crashed over him when Draco shied away from his touch, a whimper torn from his throat as Harry spoke his name into the silence, Draco's body shrinking into itself when he touched cold skin.
He had to stay awake.  Only the light could banish them.  The light.  And Harry.
'Professor?'  A timid voice broke through her dark thoughts.  Turning her head, she saw the nervous figure of Hermione beside her.  Her face ashen, her bright eyes dimmed.  The girl who had once been such a firm friend to Harry Potter, a friend who had ultimately turned her back.
And then there was the Dreamless Sleep potion.  It had never failed her before.  He should have slept without worry, without the torturous dreams.  It hadn't worked. She had to return, to get Draco inside the school.  But that meant the short journey had to be taken with a fully conscious Draco.  A boy who wasn't healing properly, who could hardly bear to be touched, who had to be carried.
'Almost done.'  Madam Pomfrey spoke gently.  'You are doing really well.'  Her hand dipped to the base of his spine, rubbing more of the horrific potion deeply into an open lash wound. 'Let me put you under, Draco, please.'  Her voice thick with emotion.
He could remember so clearly what it felt like to be down there.  With his friends.  That long walk into the little village, a pocket full of jangling silver, begging to be spent on wasteful frivolities.
He pulled on his robes, plastered on a smile that had been perfected over the years and went to join his fellow classmates for breakfast.
'I'm not coming.'  There was no point in putting it off.
Milly's hand was still tight in his as the silent trio joined the swirling crowds that headed towards the Great Hall.
'Touch him, Harry.'  McGonagall instructed, a tight band around her chest.  She steadfastly refused to cry.
'Harry...'
Neville watched as Harry left the bedroom, listened as he let himself out of the portrait hole.
There was no other reason behind it, no rational explanation for the flashing change, the wild spin of a vanishing Voldemort.  Even in his tortured head, Harry knew that this was the stuff of his nightmares made flesh.
'Too much.'  Harry adds, his own hand covering Draco's.  Turning his palm, kissing his broken skin.  'I can't do this without you, Draco.  I just can't.'  He was crying again, silent tears spilling over Draco's fingertips.
'You can.  I want you to.'  He touched Harry's thigh.  'It belongs to you now.'  It had still been in the trunk, among his ruined things.  Opening that lid again had tested all of Draco's courage.  But he had to have it, he had to rescue it.  For Harry.
'It's just...'  She had hesitated, giving Nott pause for thought.  'Well, you know...  What with everything that happened...'  He had heard the usually stoic teacher stutter, something had rattled her.
'I wish I was better for you, Harry.'  Draco's whisper broke into Harry's thoughts, the overwhelming sadness and guilt welling inside of the blond boy as he tracked Harry's gentle path across his chest.  'I wish I was whole.  You deserve beautiful.'
'I have to do something.'  He looked at her, hoping the anticipation didn't show on his face.
And all that was left in its empty place were the shimmering echoes of screaming, of light and darkness, of cold dreams and warm nights covered in sheets and blankets and hot water bottles.  Oliver Twist and hushed reading, the smell of ruinous shampoo, and this, a single Chocolate Frog card.
Harry couldn't stop the sob that tore through him.
This life filled with magic and distance.  Harry Potter glimpsed from high windows and classroom doors.  Strange footsteps outside his secret door and incomplete homework, dreams and ghosts and memories that slipped whenever he tried to grasp them too tightly.
'I'm tired, that's all.'  He managed a smile for Harry, turning to him.
'I promise you, Draco, you won't have a nightmare.  It's a Dreamless Sleep potion.  I've used it before.  You can close your eyes and before you even know it, it will be the morning and I'll be here.'
And Draco knew.  His time was up.
He shook his head quickly, not giving himself the chance to change his mind.  Of course he wanted Harry, he always wanted Harry.  But for his own sanity he had to pretend that Harry Potter was not his world.
Or...  Or it could be Harry.  Waiting there in his slumber.  His hand outstretched, his bed unmade.  His smile, beckoning him closer.  Warm arms and welcome kisses.  Anything was possible, however unlikely.
'You cannot go on like this, you will become ill, and where would that leave you?  Where would that leave Draco?'
'Harry...'  It hurt when he found his voice.  But it didn't matter, because his faint breath had Harry open his eyes, red and streaming and painfully sore.  Draco reached for a smile, anything to let the stricken boy know that everything would be all right.
Harry didn't fail to catch the call the Fat Lady uttered as he and Draco slowly passed through, McGonagall still following at her steady pace behind.  'I'm sorry.'  The Lady's contrite words drifting as she swung closed, shutting them into the blessedly silent, empty common room.
'I'm not hungry.'  He told Harry, his speech improving day by long day.
'No.'  Harry shook his head, his fingers itching by his sides.  'I couldn't face it.'  He admitted, his cheeks heating up.
So it was with no small amount of shame that Draco raised his fist, poised to knock against the simple wooden door to Hagrid's home.
'All right then.'  Harry was still apprehensive.  Yes, Madam Pomfrey had indeed told the boys that Draco should perhaps try getting out of bed, perhaps try to stand for very short periods.  It was a thought that filled Harry with dread.  Dread that Draco would push himself too far, that he might cause more damage to his fragile, slowly healing body.  'But on one condition.'
The knot wouldn't come free.  His hands too frozen, his body shaking, coming apart.
'Yes, I do.'  Harry nodded, doing his best to keep up with her fast pace across the stone floor.
Only it was Harry.  His fingers gripping the door too tightly, his jaw set, his eyes red from crying.
'Come on.'  Neville urged, taking Harry's hand.
'Yes.  Thank you.'  He spoke, willing his eyes not to water, willing himself not to think about Harry as he sat on his chair, as he watched Harry's belongings being put into a tidy pile.  It would not do to dwell on the past.
'Yeah.'  He answered after a long pause, waiting for Harry to join him at the window.  'I guess so.'
'No.  No, nothing happened.'  He closed his eyes, hating the lie that spilled from him.  It was for the best.  Too much had happened this night already, there was no need to further add to Harry's worries.  'I...I think I was just tired.'
They would be out there, behind the heavy door of his room.
He was Harry's worst nightmare.
She helped him off with the pyjama top, buttons too small for Draco to manage alone.  Peeling it from his shivery skin, Pomfrey suppressed a shudder at the scars that covered his body.  They were healing, but...
There had been kisses, before.
The thought left a bitter taste in his mouth, his empty stomach turning over at the idea that Draco might be able to see where he stood, and who he stood with.
'We don't have to stay, Draco.  Not anymore.'  Harry stroked through soft blond hair, his fingers trailing gently down Draco's face.  'It's been enough.'  He could.  He could turn his back and walk away from his past.  He would never look back.  'Come with me.'
'Malfoy is crying.'  Hagrid spoke, instantly stopping the small group in their tracks.  'I think he's scared of the raised voices.'
Sparking lights of blue and red.  White hot, blinding light, like fine strands of spiderwebs lacing across his chest, stealing the air from his lungs, burning in his bones.  Wands and curses trapping sharp laughter inside his head, masks and grins and open clothes.  When would he be rid of it?  When would the shame be finished with him?
Whispered nonsensical words into his ear that Draco's tortured mind could not hope to comprehend.  He rocked him back and forth, careful with his body, gentle when all others had only inflicted pain.
'Yes.  A man can, but you, Theo, rarely are.'
'You lie.'  Nott laughed, stepping back.  'You always had a way with the truth, didn't you, Malfoy.'  Nott rested his arm on the shelf beside him, waiting patiently for the blond boy to turn around and face him.
'Your trunk has been located.  It is at the bottom of your bed.'
'I know you.'  Harry slid his hands up Draco's arms, rubbing gently.  'You forget.'  His smile filled with sadness.
A circle robes, of drawn wands, shapes moving ever closer, closing in around him.  Practice and pleasure.  That's what this was.  What it always would be.
Ron.  Hermione.  Even Neville. They had all been so cruel.  And now, he was no better.
'How long are you going to stand there watching me?'  Draco's voice in the quiet room broke through Harry's contemplation.
The night sky shimmered before him, bright and sparkling and so very beautiful.  Eash star placed in that ebony velvet blanket by a divine hand, perfect, infinite.
'Hasn't he been through enough?'
'Perhaps I'll stop.'  Draco whispered back, his eyes closing.  So tired...
'Come along, Harry.  We'll see if the House Elves can spare us some ice cream.'  Hagrid was pleased by the task given him.  His sensitive soul could not take the sight, or the sound of the boy on his bed.
'It's okay, Professor.  Really it is.'  Draco stopped him before he began tumbling into the hole he was currently digging for himself.
'Look, you said some really hurtful things tonight,'  She reached over for his hand.  'It's no wonder that Harry reacted the way he did.'
I hope, with all my heart that you will be happy again.  That you can make amends with your friends, and find the smile that I have taken from you.  For you, and only you, have given mine to me.
'Then what must we do?'
'You don't have to be.'  Harry sighed softly, standing beside him.  'Why don't you go back to bed?  See if you can get some sleep.'
A flash of blinding red light.  Crucio echoing throughout the corridor.
'It's you.'  Draco spoke, his voice catching.  'Of c...course I kept it.'  He swallowed heavily, his throat thick, his words dry.  So cold...  So thirsty...  That darkness...  Ever and ever closer, creeping and vile, and so very cold.
He was never surprised to find students out of bed on his travels around the castle.  They all believed themselves to be the first ones to ever think of exploring when all was quiet, they all thought themselves so very clever and brave.
She had no need to lift her wand and send a volley of warning sparks into the charmed ceiling.  She did not need to raise her voice and demand silence.  Her booted feet, striking the cold flagstones like the staccato rhythm of gunfire, was more than enough to stop the scurrilous gossip, the excited chatter.
'Thank you, Poppy.'  She stepped inside.  And that's when Draco saw Harry standing behind her.
'N...nothing.  I am n...n...nothing.'
Madam Pomfrey would take them away in the morning as she brought him breakfast.  Eggs, a slice of bacon.  Orange juice and toast.  A pot of tea.  Always enough for two cups.  She would pour it, sugar for her, milk for him.  And she would sit, watching, chatting as he managed a bite or three of toast, a swallow of egg.
And Nott had followed.
'Where do they think you are?  Your friends?'  Draco took the offered bowl, balancing it in his lap.  He asked the question that had been bothering him for days.  He made no move to pick up the spoon resting in the cloudy liquid.
'Not even then.'  Harry told him, sitting himself by Draco's feet, his hand unconsciously finding Draco's leg and closing around it gently.
He had fallen from her mind the moment he had been spirited away.
Enough was enough, it was time to end this madness.
Draco.
But still he packed his bag, dutifully shoving into it the books and quills he had acquired from his teachers, his own long lost to the bottle of shampoo that continued to haunt his waking thoughts.
It wasn't a blade, it wasn't something that was left for him, and it would never be an open door into the night.
'They all know, don't they?'  His voice almost silent in the quiet little room.
I am not leaving Hogwarts.  It is my home now, and perhaps it always will be.  I ask only this of you, please do not come looking for me.
He had gone.  Without a word, without a glance.  Harry had left him.
'I can't go back to how we were.'  Harry pulled away, held Draco at arms length, needing to see those silver eyes once again.  'Tell me we won't.  Tell me that we can do this, that we get through this.  I...I can't lose you, Draco.  Not now, not ever.'
'Harry...'
'Come with me.'  Harry caught Draco's hands and clasped them in his own.
Was that the last touch of water he had?  Was that the last time someone had cared enough to speak to him in such a way, to say his name?
The words spoken by McGonagall had made sense, the spells, the incantations.  The murder of his parents.  The horrific rape.  It all fit with what Draco had told them, with what was written before him.  But how was it possible?  He was dead, Voldemort was dead, by Harry's hands.  Dead and gone and never coming back.  If there was one thing Harry was certain about, it was that.  There was no link between them, no possible way Voldemort was still alive.
'My uncle threw them away.'  Harry swallowed at the memory.  'They were old, he said.  Old and smelly.'
'What if...'  He started, finally finding the words.
Because he had to keep it secret, the discovery, the admission of guilt would surely be Harry's undoing.  The boy was close to shaking apart entirely.  His hands trembling as they held his, his eyes heavy and far too clear.  Deep green eyes, huge and wide, shining brightly without the black frame and barrier of glass he was never without.  A sight he had been so desperate to see.  But not like this, never, ever like this.
Harry had been the one to give him back.
He found that the familiarity of returning to Hogwarts was a unexpected comfort.  People had died here, friends and classmates.  Harry thought it might be too difficult to go back, to see where his friends had fallen and not gotten back up.  To taste the fear of death again, to roam the halls that had seen too much blood.  But it wasn't like that.
He could hide underneath his sleeves, bunched up and covered under his clothes.  No one would ever know, no one need ever see.  He could easily conceal whatever ruin he made of his arm.
'Tell me where you are staying, Draco.'  Harry kissed his hair, letting his lips linger in the soft strands of Draco's blond locks.  'I'll come to you, like I used to.'
The figure emerged fully from the cramped cupboard with an unsteady gait, looming over his cowering son with his lips curled back, a grimace of pain and suffering writ over his features. His eyes sunken into his dark skull, his once flawless skin worn thin with decay and rot.  A flap of foetid meat carving a gaping hole in his throat, his very flesh crawling with unspeakable horror.
He kept it in his bed, pressed between the pages of Oliver Twist.
Harry could feel his fingers aching with the memory of that convulsing throat, the way Nott's flesh had moved and swallowed and gasped, a single, desperate breath squeezing up his windpipe as he had tightened his grip.  And tightened.  And tightened.
'You cannot keep blaming yourself for this.  What happend to Draco happened because of choices that were made long ago.  It is not your fault.'
'I do believe you.'  Draco whispered, his heart thumping out a new drum beat.  His words coming slowly, half afraid that he would shatter this moment in two.  'I don't know why you say what you do,  I can't understand any of it.  But, Merlin help me, I believe you.'
'Harry?'
Harry said friend.  And Draco knew now that he meant it.
Draco rolled up his sleeve.
'I know.'  Harry whispered, his free hand going to Draco's waist, tugging him gently closer as Draco's tears spilled.
Death Eaters in the halls, blood on the stones and murder in the classrooms.
The light was so very far away now.  He couldn't hope to reach it.  Blue, black and horrible scarlet flooded his vision.  It was in his throat, his ears, his eyes.  Choking, suffocating.  His hands trying to claw their way to the surface.  Breathing in the thick air, coughing, screaming.
Harry's sob tore its way from his body, refusing to be curtailed any longer.  He felt it rip from his throat, scratching and painful.  He could do nothing but follow it down into the darkness.
'Stranger than normal you mean?'  Ron spoke again, tugging off his thick coat.  'What I don't get is why he is even back?  And in Gryffindor of all places!  It's unheard of.  Dad said the rumour at The Ministry is that Malfoy's parents have vanished to the South of France, they can't find any trace of them at all.  So why didn't Malfoy go with them?'  Ron tossed aside his coat, almost hitting a second year student.  'He also said that Malfoy Manor is destroyed.  Like completely blown to bits.'
Water.  The thought had his parched tongue escape from his mouth, trying to lick some moisture into his painfully dry lips.  How long had it been since he last tasted water?  Surely the dream would end soon, they had never let him sleep this long before.
But the immediate danger was over.  Bones had been knitted together, internal damage repaired, flesh split under a whip had been drawn tightly closed, despite infection taking root.  His jaw had been cracked back into place and some of the more serious bruising around his throat was abating.
'Wait.'  Harry hesitated on the top step.  'How...how long was he asleep for?'  He didn't want the answer, not really.  But he had to know how long Draco was trapped in his nightmare for.
There was nothing unusual about that.  Three days in and he was still getting used to being back at the place that held so many memories.  Good and bad.  His love of Hogwarts and the people it contained ensured his return, but several days ago he was still debating whether it was the right thing to do.  Everything had changed, everyone had changed.  A summer spent grieving at The Burrow had cemented his place at the Weasley's side.  He was an honorary son and brother, a friend to the family.  His family.
'I...I don't think you should.'  Draco whispered, doing his utmost to hold it all together.  It was for the best that he push him away now.  It would hurt less this way.  He couldn't allow himself to get close to Potter, it was already too risky.
'Ron?'  Harry pressed, watching Ron's small movements, the way his fingers touched lightly upon his Queen.  'Are you listening to me?  Did...did you hear what I said?'
'I don't know you anymore, Harry.'  Ron spoke, staring at where Harry and Malfoy were joined.  His voice low, dark.  'First you dump my sister...'
'They will come to accept you, Draco.'  She said kindly.
Not the voice hissing sweet promises of redemption in his throbbing head.  Dreams of Mummy, ideas of Father and family.  Promises that would never be kept, and care that would never be given.
'Go, Harry.  You have to go.'  Draco pressed his hands forward until they came into contact with Harry's chest.  He pushed at him weakly.  'Don't...  Don't let anyone see you with me.'  He could now hear what had drawn Harry's sudden attention.  Feet, heading in their direction, coupled with near silent giggling.
He should have stopped them, he should have told someone, told anyone that might listen.  Got him help.  Thrown aside his own family, cast himself out into the cold.  But...  But what if they grabbed at his hand too?  Dragged him off and tossed him to that cellar?
'Oh my.'  Pomfrey gasped, horrified.  'He's...he's not awake.  He's in a nightmare.'
There was a darkness that surrounded him, a dry, dusty pall that clouded his shaky vision and clogged his throat.  He was so thirsty.
'You should.'  Draco murmured.  'It would be so much easier for everyone, for you, if you did.'
'Not all.'  A lingering kiss was pressed to the top of his head.  'Don't always think the worst.'
Harry curled his hand around the broken edges of the horror he found in Draco's pocket.  He let it dig deep, his anger numbing him to the pain.  Anger and something more.  Something desperate and aching.  He pulled it free, the glass glittering in the little bathroom where the water grew cold, and Draco grew colder.
He turned his gaze from the cold hearth, and trained it on the open staircase.  Hoping, wishing to see the face of his best friend.  They would apologise, Harry would grin, guilty and attentive.  Tell him that it was a stupid mistake.  Draco had indeed tricked him.  He loved Ginny, of course he did, and it was the hurt at seeing her and Dean together.  Engaged, no less.  And Malfoy was there.  Wicked and devious.  And he had fallen for the lies and the tricks and the empty promises.
He could still taste the blood, still remember the touch of a wet tongue, still feel the bite of that whip.
'You.'  The Boy Who Lived hissed, his face so close as he squeezed the air from his lungs.  'How fucking dare you.'
Harry pressed the glass to Draco's lips.
'Not...not your fault.'  Draco coughed, his throat closing around his words.
'Harry...'
'Come here.'  Draco closed the book, set it aside.
Harry was on his third slice of tart when the sound of hurried footsteps broke through their laughter.
Too early for Harry to be here.  The full night-time was when he would knock.  Knock and push the door sightly, his shy smile appearing around the heavy wooden door.
'I will pass on your words later, Miss Granger.  Should the need arise.  Now, off to the Hall with you.  And take Weasley with you.'
'Go...  Please.'  Draco sobbed.  It wasn't fair.  How could he let go after this?  Those strong, safe arms.  Sheltering him from all the horrors.  The nightmares that threatened to visit, the memories that would never be erased.  How could he survive being alone again after the warmth of Harry Potter?
His bed had been stripped, the covers thrown into a corner.  The curtains pulled back, allowing the late October sun to flood the room.
And photographs.  Tied together with a red ribbon, Draco had always cherished these few pictures.  Photographs of the three of them together, in the Manor, in the extensive gardens.  Moving, smiling, as happy as their life allowed.
From the darkest red, to the palest pink, there didn't appear to be anywhere that had been hidden from the inhuman punishment that madman who had believed himself a lord had inflicted.
'Neville, I...I...'  Harry stuttered, turning to his friend.
'Look.'  The boy on the floor spoke weakly, staring up at Harry.  His voice cracked, heavy tear tracks glistening on his pale cheeks.  'Look.'  He held up his curled fist, yellowed paper peaking out from beneath his fingers.  'Look at what I did.'
'Draco's home is here, and we are his family.'  Her voice contained an edge of steel.  She would not see Draco cast himself out into the cold.  'I shall do everything in my power to ensure his safety and comfort within these walls.  There is no need for him to flee, but in order for that to happen, we need to respect his wishes.  And if that includes him not having any contact with Harry, then so be it.'
'Harry?'  She crouched by his side, old enough to know that introspection and guilt would do her, or anyone, no favours.  She could, and undoubtedly would, visit that open wound later.  Right now there were more pressing matters.  'Harry, you cannot stay here.'
'Voldemort killed your parents.'  She patted at the tears on his cheeks.  'Do not think otherwise.  You could not have changed any of it, Draco.  Your Father and Mother were always at the mercy of the Dark Lord.  They would always die by his hand.  It was only luck that kept you alive.'
'No...no more.'  A sob.  'I...I'm sorry.'
Bracing themselves for trouble and a long detention, the boys gave each other a weary glance and stood as one, ready for the tirade to begin.
No.  It would not do to dream of such a thing.
'But what do I tell McGonagall?'  Milly pleaded with him, even despite knowing that once he had an idea in his head, he would never be swayed.  The Boggart was testament to that.  'And what about Draco?  What do we do about him?'
'I'm okay.'  And once again Draco forced a smile for the question, pushed a lie passed his lips.  'I'm doing fine.'
'Whatever you want.'  Harry whispered.  'Close your eyes, Draco.  I won't let anyone hurt you.'  He carefully ran a solitary finger over the darkest bruise.
The crackers had been pulled, the food eaten and the presents opened, all saving two that remained unknown, waiting for night to fall.
Harry traced the way the lash weaved over Draco's body, the tip of his fingers barely touching him, lest he bring on the plague of Draco's pain.
Fred could still be alive in this place.
'Are you prepared to give everything up for him?'  Ron glared in Draco's direction.  'Because I'll tell you now, that is exactly what will happen.  No one, no one at all will accept this.'  He waved his hand between them.  'No one will understand why you are doing this.  Why him, of all people, Harry.  Why?  You will throw your life away for Death Eater scum!'
He was so damned tired.
'He can't stand that.'  Harry murmured.  'I...I have to get out of here.'
Some of the many candles that illuminated the hut were extinguished.  The room enveloped in a quiet, comforting blanket of subdued light.    A hush fell over the four people who watched Draco.
He unfolded the scrap of paper carefully.
Ginny breathing softly into his ear, whispering words of giggling encouragement that turned his face scarlet.  Her small hand wrapped around him, the swell of her breasts against his skin.  She touched, teased, her once gentle fingers tightening in her growing frustration.  Almost painful.
Draco could be so easily forgotten.
'Y...Yes.'  His voice breaking on a sob.  He had no choice.
Under the unrelenting grasp of his fingers, Harry felt Nott try to swallow down a breath of air.
'Harry..?  Please.'  Draco could feel his heart pounding against his ribcage.  He turned his head.  Finally the long dark night, filled with fear vanished, and all he saw was emerald eyes, shining with heartbreak.
He was hurt, damaged, broken.  Dying.
'I...  No.  No.'
Men.  So many men.  Each one different to the next, each one with new ways to hurt him.  Some bare, some not.  And some simply watching.  Burning wands and cruel taunts, cracking bones and splitting skin.  Bright new ways to cause pain, to bring on the cold dreams and the thirst.
'There isn't anyone.'  He said the words without thinking, just grateful to have the room stop its sickening spin.
Harry folded the paper back up, careful with it.
Draco eyed him, knowing that he wouldn't be able to walk much further without help, even getting this far had taken the last of his strength.
“I love you too,” Harry repeated as if he was talking to a child. “Like, romantically. The way you love me.”
“What is it, Draco?”
“Does it feel like we’re going too fast? That we’re too deep in or, I don’t know, too serious too quickly?” Draco asked and then buried his slightly shaky hands in Harry’s hair.
! Just tell him everyone knows and stop this whole ‘we can’t look at each other if someone’s within the 5-mile radius’ thing.”
'Yes.'  Draco choked.
Had.  Had loved him dearly.  There would be no more letters.
He returned, whenever he could.  Told no one.  This was his little secret, his own dark sin.
Saw the way expensive fabric draped around a dancing corpse.
He gently wrapped Draco up in layers of fur.  There was a danger that it would stick to his weeping wounds, but that hardly seemed to matter under the circumstances.  It was likely that he would not see the morning, so the least the gentle giant could do was to make him warm, and hopefully a little comfortable.
There Draco sat, in the lonely darkness of the common room, just a brave little lamp burning the shadows away where he sat in his drafty chair.  An enclave, a halo of light surrounding him.  The room was chilly, the fire long dead, it's ashes turned grey hours ago.
Harry stopped, he had too.  Gasping for breath, his head hanging down, his chest heaving.  What a fool he was, running from the room like an army of Dementors chased at his heals.  He hadn't stopped running until the dead of night closed around him and he found himself out in the open, the stars cold company.
He turned his head from his fragmented reflection.  What did it matter?  They wouldn't see him, they wouldn't ever be on a street.  They lay, forever in that dark place.
'I'm fine.'  Harry cut her off, not in the mood for further explanations.  They would only be lies.  He couldn't tell her, he couldn't tell anyone where he had spent the night.  It was Draco's secret, one that Harry would carry to the grave if necessary.
Draco was sleeping.
'Are you happy now?'  Harry demanded, his eyes locking on McGonagalls damp gaze.  'Look at him.'  He put his hand on the back of Draco's head, holding him against his chest.  'You pushed him too far.'
'Moving from my care, returning to his lessons?  The boy is not well, Minerva.'  Madam Pomfrey rubbed her hands over her tired eyes.  'He cannot be allowed to push himself too hard.  You know as well as I that his injuries were most severe, I did not expect him to live, let alone come as far as he has.  But his recovery is slow.  That...that curse inside of him will not relent.  My fear is that he will try and do too much, and his body will react accordingly.'
'Harry...'
It wasn't the same.
Draco would have to pass him if he wanted to get out of the crush, if he wanted to wash away the blood from his hand and get himself a drink.
His Harry.
Draco's loose fingers danced slowly up Harry's arm.  Brushing over his dirt stained robes, his path a slow, sure one as he grazed his gentle touch higher.  Across his shoulder, over the pink blush of his swallowing throat.  A brief flicker of heartache caught in Harry's eyes as Draco's hand finally settles on his wet streaked cheek.
'Malfoy hasn't been himself either, Ron.  I think...  I think he's been ill.'
'I love you.'
Harry wordlessly sat upon the covers of his unmade bed, his legs drawn up, his head falling to his knees as Draco pulled the heavy drapes surrounding them closed.
But this, this staying away was madness.  Draco told him to sleep.  But how could he?  How could he get into bed and close the curtains and drift off?  Draco wouldn't.  He would lie awake, terrified of the darkness that lay in wait should he dare to close his heavy eyes.  The curse that held his body in its grip, waiting to pounce, waiting until his guard was down.  Waiting for the nighttime.
'For all the things I want.  For being this way, for wanting everything I cannot have.'
He didn't have his smile when he slid into the bed beside him.  He didn't need to lift his arm up any more for Draco to settle close beside him, his hand lacing with his.  Harry could remember the smell of his clean hair, the brush of the growing strands tickling his cheek as they sat as close as could be.
'No, just a knock.'  Another lie.  His arm throbbing under the blankets.  'Don't worry.  I'm fine.'
'Harry...  Don't.'  Draco sobbed, the anguish in Harry's words more than he could bear.  Useless to stop the tears flooding down his face.  'I...I'm sorry, no.  I...I don't t...think that.'  How could he take it back?  How could he make Harry see?  Coughing against the pain, pain that locked itself in his chest.  He wanted to vomit, wanted to scream.  Wanted to throw himself at Harry.  Didn't want to ever let go.
It was night when it hurt the most.
He had loved school.
'We are coming in now, Hagrid.'  McGonagall told him.  'We all are.'  She gave Harry a pointed look.
This pale, pathetic creature, with tear tracks etched into his sunken cheeks.  Would they be shocked at the way his hands always shook as he jambed the bottle under the tap, filling it clumsily, the water wetting the sleeves of his pyjamas.
'Do I frighten you?'  Harry had to ask.
Neville spied Harry leaning against one of tables, casually sipping from a glass that was doubtless provided by Seamus.  Pushing his way through the throng of students, he eventually found himself at Harry's side.
'It won't take a moment to fetch him, Draco.  I'm sure he would want to be here.'
'But?'  Draco prompted.  'What is to be done with me?'
Neville shivered, happily watching the goings on but wishing he had remembered to bring along his cardigan.  It was on the bottom of his bed, laid there to remind him to put it on before going down to the feast.  He had promptly forgotten.  He still had time, this impromptu party wasn't about to end anytime soon.  He could just run up to the room, grab his trusty cardigan and be back in less than five minutes.
Wait for Harry Potter to bump into his trolly once more.  Eyes huge and bright and green behind broken glasses.  Wait for his polite, shy question as he asked for impossible directions to a seemingly mythical place.
Too hard to fight.  So easy to fall into the waiting darkness.
The screaming had stopped, the castle quiet and still.  The very air sucked clean and spat out.
'I think you were right.  I think there is something the matter with Malfoy.  I didn't see it before, I don't think I wanted to.  But, that morning when he left...'  Ron shook his head, his hand that wasn't in Hermione's tight grip worried at a loose thread on his jumper.  'He wasn't the same person, and I...  I'm ashamed of what I said to him.  Of what I said to both of them.  He was crying, Hermione.  Malfoy was actually crying.  He was in his pyjamas and no shoes, and I stood aside as he left.'
Unseasonably warm for late September, teachers and students alike had decided to make the most of the early autumn sunshine and venture into Hogsmeade once again.  Harry had gone along this time, knowing full well that another excuse would result in uncomfortable questions that he had no answers to.
The strength in his grip was astounding, and Theo could now see for himself how this orphaned boy from the Muggle world had killed the Dark Lord.
Harry Potter rapidly blinking up at him from the golden frame, the ever present dark rimmed glasses valiantly trying so hard to hide those shocking green eyes of his.  He wondered what it would be like to see Harry without those glasses, to be on the receiving end of that naked green gaze.  A dream was all it ever would be.
They had tried.  Tried to save him, tried to not watch.  But it was all in vain.  The last memory Draco had of his parents had been terrible, too cruel to think about.  If only they had kept their silence, if only they had watched quietly as Draco had suffered.  They might have still been alive.
'Listen to me, Harry.'  McGonagall drew herself closer, her legs folding reluctantly beneath her body.  'You are who Draco needs, you are who he loves.  And there is nothing more important in this world than that.'  She spoke softly, taking his hand in hers, brushing some of the dust from his skin.  'Your family did you a great disservice, Harry.  Never forget that.  For they did not care to see the incredible young man before them, and because of that they have lost more than they can ever imagine.'
She was loathed to wake him from his slumber, he looked in desperate need of a few moments more.  But the evening was drawing to a close, the Great Hall no doubt already filled with dining students and teachers alike.
'Are...are you...?'  Draco stopped himself, he couldn't voice what he most wanted.
'I am always going to be this way.  There is no changing it.  You cannot look after me forever.  There will come a time when I have to get on with things, when I have to go it alone.'
'Not to worry.'  She told him kindly.  'I can help, it's what I'm here for.'  Sitting beside him, she carefully put the glass to his lips, tipping it slightly.  'You don't dream when Harry is with you, do you.'  It wasn't a question, she knew.
