The unpacking didn't take much time and therefore Draco found himself forced to rejoin Harry downstairs. He braced himself for an awkward meeting again, gently stepping down the stairs, perhaps if he didn't make so much noise, Harry wouldn't be alerted to his presence. Well the brunette bastard seemed to have impeccable hearing as he immediately poked his head out from the kitchen when Draco landed on the ground floor. Harry came out from around the corner holding two saucers, each precariously balancing a cup of tea. His hands slightly wobbled as he carried them, the china clattering with each step. Draco whispered a gentle 'thank you' as he took the cup from the man. A pretty white china tea cup, Draco mused. He brought it to his lips and sipped.
Harry's eyes shifted upwards to Hermione and then over to Draco. They shifted back down at his plate. "Quite."
"And what's wrong with him? He was perfectly polite." Draco scoffed, strolling along the dirt path back towards his home. Hermione ran after him, trying to keep up with Draco's accelerating pace.
"Yes, well, I just couldn't resist this one, could I?" He asked and patted Draco's hip, rubbing slightly and trailing down his thigh which caused the blonde to gasp inwardly and grip Harry's arm harder. He knew Greyback was watching Harry's hand stroke Draco's skin with jealous determination and he knew that Harry knew he was watching as well. The arrogance and possessive display of ownership caused Greyback's pupils to shrink and caused a gruff clearing of his throat to exit his lips. Harry only continued, "Thank you so much for keeping him company while I was busy. I hope to talk to you more soon, now if you excuse us." Harry maneuvered them away from the man and down to the open veranda, where other couples were gathered to chat in private. When they finally found an empty corner, Harry let go of the boy and smiled. "Well, I leave you alone for two minutes and you sneak around with other men, do you?" He teased, leaning against the marble banisters.
Draco has nowhere to go during the day. His work was mostly a night activity. Therefore, during the day, Draco more or less wandered the town aimlessly. He ignored the leering from the street urchins that roamed Knockturn Alley during the day, scowling at their outturned hands. He found himself skirting along the edge of town, a ghost in the shadows as he passed the homeless beggars on the streets.
"O-oh, uh…" Draco stammered slightly, taking the lollipop out from his mouth. Before he could speak again, Blaise and Pansy stepped in front of him.
Draco turned his head back to the boy in front of him, who knocked back another gulp of the liquid. "Do you want to try some?" Harry asked, holding out the flask. "It won't bite~" he teased as Draco shyly took the canister from him.
Harry simply rolled his eyes, chuckling. "Please, I can see right through that prickly exterior. You wish for a husband to put you in your place, be firm with you," Harry's eyes dragged over Draco's blushing face, "Dominate you."
"Not at all, I must be getting back to my companions anyways." Mr. Nott turned to Draco and took him by the hand, kissing it softly. "Until we meet again, Angel." He turned on his heel and sauntered off back to his friends.
"Excellent. Alright, it's Christmas time. What would we be doing?" Harry asked as he screwed the flask shut and let it fall to his side onto the couch.
"Just like you!" Hermione teased. "I just want to see you happy, Draco." Hermione's fingers threaded through Draco's hair, combing through the mess of bedhead. "You two would make a handsome couple, indeed."
Why did this boy make him want to fall onto his knees in front of a church and plead his sins to God?
"Your mother is in town, doing the shopping." Lucius said calmly, "Are you alright, darling? You seem slightly...frazzled?"
"Well, it's quite…" Harry began, "It's quite you, Draco," Harry laughed, sitting down on the couch and spreading out his legs, taking up as much space as possible.
Harry scoffed, letting a snide chuckle out from under his breath. "Yes, well. I should have expected a brat like you to not be capable in housework." The comment slithered out like a snake from Harry's lips, wrapping around the blonde's neck and making his cheeks burn. Draco couldn't blame Harry for his sour attitude towards him. He deserved it after all these years, but the remark still did leave Draco's mouth dry. He had endured his own comments from others: princess, brat, dumb blonde, snake, traitor-- and while Draco's responses back usually involved a hex or a spell, he found himself defenseless now and like a angered child backed into a wall, all he could do was spit back.
"I hope this tells you exactly what we are," Harry purred, his thumb rubbing circles into Draco's cheek. With tingling lips, Draco was soon left alone in his bedroom, Harry had left to his own. The boy wordlessly moved to the bed, still in a state of shock. He laid down, staring up at the ceiling before him. Slowly, he moved his fingers to his lips, brushing against them lightly as if he could still feel Harry's lips on his own. Draco smiled sheepishly, got under the covers of the bed, and blew out the candle.
A Saturday trip to Hogsmeade was exciting for any young wizard or witch. It was the only time students at Hogwarts were able to relax outside the walls of their precious school and actually be kids for once. Draco had put on his best sweater and baby blue parka, the one his mother got him from London during her last trip there. With a loud jingling from his pocket of a purse full of galleons, Draco practically skipped towards the main courtyard, where he would find Blaise and Pansy waiting for him already.
"Oh?" Draco asked as he flipped through the pages of the book he had picked up, eyes not even lifting to meet his friend's face. "And are these men of any specific concern for me or…?"
"I saw you looking at it in Hogsmeade. I thought it would make for a nice Christmas present." Harry blushed, averting his eyes as Draco began to undo the strings that tied the object together. Inside the paper glittered brightly in the sun, the moonstone hairclip that Draco saw in the window display.
"Like an absolute snow siren, now come on, I want to see the new brooms on sale!" Pansy said, interlocking her arm with Draco's and practically dragging him away. Laughing behind them was Blaise, who looked on with a fond smile. If Draco were to have to list two people that he could consider friends, he supposed it would have to be Pansy and Blaise. The two had been the first to walk up and actually have a conversation with Draco, other than the obvious "your parents are former Deatheaters?" conversation. The trio skipped off towards Hogsmeade, Pansy chatting their ears off the entire way and Blaise having to make sure she doesn't get too riled up. Draco's eyes would sometimes glance over to spot them looking at each other in a funny way and Draco knows exactly what those looks mean. He has often read about them in the tawdry and scandalous romance novels his mother keeps in her bedside drawer. Draco can't exactly deny that seeing the pictures of scantily-clad and beautiful men from a young age weren't a factor in his sexuality. He's happy for them, in a corny and sweet way.
"Well, if my unromantic sensibilities offend you so, why do you shrink away from me in such a way? Perhaps you just hate me so much that you can't bear being so close to me. After all, you did look quite comfortable with Mr. Nott." Harry's words and breath tickled Draco's neck, making goosebumps erupt across his skin.
"Oh yeah, it's great! I definitely love being considered some blond bimbo, training to be some pureblood's stepford housewife or something." Draco rolled his eyes and crossed his arms in front of his chest, huffing haughtily in a way that only made Harry slightly smirk and chuckle. It was amusing for him obviously to see Draco so unnecessarily wound up and tight. He had been like this since they met that one fateful day in the bookstore.
"You indulge in women's work?" Mr. Potter abruptly asked. Draco's head whipped around towards the man, eyes narrowed.
"Mm, perhaps two or three." Draco hummed, devilish smile aimed back at Harry. "If you get so lucky." Draco's eyes turned back towards the fireplace, memories of that first night together danced in the flickering flames. The silence between the two boys grew longer and longer until Harry sighed.
Harry's eyes darted over to his drawer. He rolled himself over, sheets wrapping around his naked torso and shifting down his body. With an outstretched arm, he clumsily opened his side table drawer, trying his best to remain quiet. His fingers scoured the inside until he felt a soft and silken material. With a satisfied feeling in his stomach, Harry pulled out the item. Draco's pretty white ribbon, lacey and dainty and preserved so delicately. Harry rubbed his fingers against the material, then bringing it up to his nose and inhaling the lingering scent of Draco's hair. Harry had kept it, not being able to bring himself to part with the ribbon. It was a memento of the first night they met. It was ridiculous, the thought of even keeping such a thing. Borderline obsessive.
"So what is it that is being kept secret from your old man, Draco?" He asked curiously, eyebrow raised as a servant poured his cup of tea out. Draco had never been able to lie effectively to his father, for those snake like eyes had always had a grip on it's beholder, but Draco had learned to soften the man with sweet words and pretty doe eyes.
"Well, it's quite a good thing you won't be my husband then." Draco mused, reaching out for the flask again and taking a smaller sip this time. He passed it back to Harry.
"Yeah, really," Harry nodded, "And besides, the lack of poison is really a good touch." A smirk curled on Harry's lips when he saw Draco's cheeks turn pink and a slight chuckle erupted from his chest.
Draco glanced over, lips wet with wine and stained slightly giving them a rosey red tinge. Harry had been staring straight ahead towards him, slowly bringing his crystalline glass of whiskey up to his lips, never breaking eye contact as the ice clinked with movement. Draco's body felt warm and fluttery, his foot tapping in anxiety as the two sat in utter silence. They hadn't seen each other since the Masquerade party, not since Harry had confessed in drunken stupor that he was intrigued by Draco, the boy with elven features and glassy doll eyes.
"Good morning," Harry muttered with a clearing of his voice which made Draco's eyes snap forwards, a bright pink blush on his cheeks and down his neck.
As the evening went on and the sky went from robin egg blue to a mix of burnt orange and raspberry pinks, Hermione and Ron found themselves invested in a particularly intense game of Bridge. Harry watched on from his seat, burning through another cigar. His eyes sometimes fluttered between the card game and the young boy seated under a grand Willow tree, completely enthralled in a novel he had brought with him (except for the times Draco glanced back at Harry when the older man wasn't looking). After about an hour of content quiet, Harry began to take a stand, stretching his legs and arms and neck.
Oh. Right. Most technology from the Muggle World hadn't been introduced to the Wizarding World; a fact that Harry had become quite familiar with when Ron's own father had asked him what the point of a telephone was when people could simply owl letters to each other. After all, what was the purpose of a television when picture books came to life and words could manifest in thin air. Harry had specifically remembered to bring a television with him the next time he was in the Muggle World and although he only can get spotty reception, it was substantial enough, broadcasting Muggle news channels as well as some reality shows. Harry supposed that Draco would have never seen a television before, considering Purebloods had always been known to cherish traditional wizarding methods of leisure and entertainment.
, he also must admit that getting calls at six in the morning to say the body of a dead woman was found outside of Knockturn Alley never was never what he imagined being an Auror was. She was a young girl, probably 20 or 21 years old. Pretty blonde girl with a slim build and short hair. Her neck was slit across and Harry didn't have the stomach to look at her directly.
Draco scoffed and let out a breathy, sarcastic chuckle. "Gentlemen?! That cad?? Trust me 'Mione, he is no gentlemen. Devilish brute more like it." Draco picked at the woolen materials, running his fingers through them absent-mindedly.
"God help us all," Draco sighed, feeling the unnerving stare of a certain older man on him. And this time, he smiled slightly at the thought.
Draco had been a child of extreme beauty, a child with good breeding. His parents had often joked they had raised a fairy or nymph or any other woodland creature of storytale instead of a human boy. Lithe figure, sharp features, brilliant grey eyes and icy blond hair, Draco was otherworldly. Porcelain skin, creamy and pale to the eye that rose to soft pink when flushed, Draco found himself at the center of attention within the young men in town when he was doing his daily shopping. A sweet fawn amongst a group of wild boars, Draco had never been like the other boys his age. While the others boys grew to be muscular and hairy, a true symbol of virility and blind pride, Draco had grown to be somewhat of a fair maiden, delicate and elegant. This fact was to his mother's delight, who desperately wished to see her child engaged and married by the time he was 16. Preferably to a man of wealthy means who would give her son a life of riches and comfort.
"Well," the blonde began, "Muggles seem to be absolutely enthralled with something called...soap-operas. I have no idea what they have to do with soap, but they're quite entertaining. Listen to this, the girl in this show fell in love with her husband's father! Isn't that mad?"
"Daddy, these robes are itchy." Draco wriggled in his garments as they reached the animal store, as a pet was necessary for any aspiring wizard or witch. There were many fine choices and Draco's snowy blue eyes sparkled at all of them as he ran his fingers across soft furs and feathers.
The Fat Lady began to whine, cracking under the look of Draco's charm. "Fine! Fine, but only because I can't resist against such a face, come on, go in!" Her door swung open and Draco smiled, tilting his head to thank her kindly and bowing his head, before following Harry inside.
The blonde child began walking towards Severus, making sure his godfather didn't see him as he saddled up besides him on the wall he was leaning against. The sudden addition made Severus peer over sharply, as if to scold a student, only to relax his glare when he realized it was his beloved godchild.
"You deem it women's work, but if you had ever actually gotten your hands dirty before, you'd know how tedious a task it could be." Draco spat out with as much venom and disdain as he could muster, not caring that Hermione was nudging him to stop talking.
Well, Harry doesn't know how much more fondness he could take. He took out his wand from its holster, a flick and a spell and he was being wooshed away.
"Yes, I spent two years living in Nice, I own a winery and vineyard down there." The answer was curt and concise, much like the man who gave it. The conversation ended as soon as it began and everyone began to feel uncomfortable with the silence.
"I'll come visit you sometime! We'll have tea and sweets, perhaps!" Draco spoke back as he stomped to his friends, attempting to ignore the heat in his belly as he remembered that one night in the Gryffindor common room. That one night with Harry Potter. By the time he met back up with Blaise and Pansy, the two of them were too distracted to notice his ever-growing red cheeks.
"After all these years, you seek me out. I'm sure it's because you've heard of my reputation," Draco smiled, his body pressing sweetly into Harry's. Harry remained stone still, confused and shocked at the sudden action. "Playing out some long-held fantasy, eh Potter?" Draco chuckled and Harry found his back hitting the stone wall, hands shooting down to Draco's waist to hold him steady as they fell back. Draco smelled like cheap candy perfume and cigarette smoke and cold winter air and it made Harry sweat.
Their conversation came to a resounding halt when the music abruptly stopped and all that was left was the scattering of feet to make a small hall in between. Draco and Hermione stood up quickly, smoothing out their clothing and Draco on his tiptoes attempting to see what the commotion was about. A red-faced, pudgey and stumpy man came forth from the main entrance and cleared his throat. In a booming voice, he announced. "Please welcome our esteemed guests, Mr. Weasley and Mr. Potter!"
"I assure you, I have no idea what you're talking about," Draco huffed, sauntering off to the next aisle. Hermione trailed behind, arms behind her back and teasing grin on her thin pink lips.
The brunette rolled his eyes, ignoring Draco's tantrum. He called out for Kreacher, the Grimmauld Place house elf, and attempted to not snicker at Draco's exasperation: his little foot stomping down on the ground and his mouth running like a jabbering little bird. "Kreacher," Harry began as the wrinkled elf appeared, "Take Malfoy to his room, please."
Draco has heard of the illustrious Harry Potter, in passing conversations while sitting in his father's lap as he discussed with colleagues or when his mother read the daily gossip columns in the papers. Harry Potter, the boy that survived Lord Voldemort's hex and, at the ripe age of 1 year old. His parents, Lily and James Potter, had protected their child and killed the once Dark Lord, only to die in the process. Their likenesses were carved in marble, statues were erected in the middle of Hogsmeade. They were deemed heroes of the Wizarding World. They were legends, visionaries, gods.. and yet, here their child was. An orphan in ill fitting clothes and broken glasses.
"As if you don't fantasize about being my wife. Bearing my children and worshipping the ground I walk on." Harry laughed heartily as Draco huffed frustratedly and let go of his arm, stopping off ahead of Harry, but still with Harry's coat around his shoulders.
"I heard it was going to rain. The newspapers said it so." Draco said softly, taking another sip of his wine glass. He wished for this awkwardness to dissipate, but the aura in the room was as thick inside as the air outside, muggy and murky and suffocating.
was his second thought as the flashes of cameras went off around him. It's been two years since he was hired to be an Auror and although Harry swears up and down that
"Care to explain what the Ice Queen was doing in our Common Room?" Ronald groaned, dropping the bags on the ground and plopping back down in Draco's now cold seat. The sight made Harry deflate and lay back, crossing his arms tiredly.
"And am I to simply ignore these characteristics? Simply marry a man regardless if he's an absolute brute as long as he can afford the mansions in Derbyshire?" Draco scoffed, "Now you're sounding like my mother, 'Mione"
. Completely and unadulterated. Draco Malfoy was a cute boy. He had always known Draco was attractive; after all, he's heard his fair share of girls at Hogwarts drool and pant over the blonde boy. Harry was always surprised that Draco never chose to date any of his many admirers since he surely had the pick of the bunch. But Harry had never really thought Draco to be cute. Handsome, sure. Reasonably attractive, yeah. But
"Um...I'm not sure. What do you mean?" Draco asked sheepishly. It was an awkwardly intense question to ask someone you barely talk to; to ask someone who you barely knew. They weren't friends, Draco thought. He knew that Harry and him weren't the chummiest of pals that gabbed on well into the night. So Draco found himself staring back at Harry awkwardly, stuck in place and stuck in a place he knew he shouldn't be.
Harry glanced back at the soup. It was innocent looking enough, just broth and floating vegetables. Harry went over to pull a spoon out from the utensils drawer and back to the soup, nervously looking down at it. He shouldn't be thinking these things about Draco. He wasn't who he was anymore and Harry knows that. Looking back down in the soup, Harry could see his reflection looking back at him. He delicately dipped the spoon in, bringing up a single mouthful of broth, one carrot chunk, and what looked possibly like celery. Harry could feel Draco's eyes on him from the sofa. Harry brought the spoon to his mouth, slightly hesitated, and then finally wrapped his lips around it.
So I have decided to continue this story because it seems that a lot of people really liked the first chapter! I hope this one doesn't disappoint! Please comment :) thank you!
"Um...Kreacher.." Draco began, a nervous smile on his lips as he walked around the room, "Is-is this really
"Well I'm not old, fat, or balding, but I have a bit of money saved from my parents." Harry sat back down next to Draco. He held out his palm, showing a small object wrapped in brown paper and string. It was crudely done, but Draco couldn't help but be fascinated.
It was Draco's 15th birthday and his mother and father were stuck in Germany, unable to come celebrate their only son's birth. The morning of his birthday Draco's heart felt heavy. He had received a message the night before. Lizzie had toted it in her mouth, dropping it in the lap of the blonde. Lucius and Narcissa sent their deepest apologies, their sweetest words and their most sincere promises for next year. Draco had always spent his birthday with his family, in their lovely home, but Draco supposed he was old enough now to be ok with spending one birthday alone.
, Harry thought as he walked around the body on the ground, tiptoeing around the strings of blood that pooled out in sticky globs.
Draco wakes up with abrasive sunlight glinting off the dirty mirror of his cheap hostel room. He doesn't know exactly when he had fallen asleep last night, and as he turns over, he remembers the feeling of a large hand petting him, running through his platinum snowy hair. It was affectionate and warm, something that Draco would remember nowadays. Mr. NoName was gone and it was better that way. The wake up the next morning, the uncomfortable and silent dressing and departing. The man had left the money on the counter, and wasn't that lovely? Most men nowadays attempt to skip out on paying Draco if they can, but that's just the nature of men isn't it? Taking without anything in return? Draco's known a lot of men in his young 22 years of life and he's sure that they're all exactly the same: beasts with no morals.
"Well isn't someone in a sour mood," Ron whined, "Seriously, Harry, what's got your knickers in a twist?"
"Fuck, well if any more bodies turn up like this, we'll have to put a statement out in the news," Ron cursed, "I'll have to tell the higher-up's about this, you know."
Draco couldn't bear to look at the letter before he flicked his wrist and sent it off into the world through his open window. He hoped the letter would reach Harry soon and that he would receive some sort of response. He had asked his parents before if he could invite a companion to the party and if they could stay for Christmas, but perhaps they were expecting Thomas Knott or another well distinguished boy from Hogwarts, not Harry freaking Potter. He planned to keep that little detail a secret until the night of the party, where his parents would rather hold their tongues than make a spectacle in front of their peers. Sure, Draco would never hear the end of it by the time the party was over. But when was the last time he was in a situation that he couldn't puppy dog eyes his way out of?
Draco gripped the paper in his fingers tighter as he walked through the stone arches that separated Knockturn Alley from Diagon Alley. The idea of actually going to Grimmauld Place filled him with dread and Draco had spent over an hour trying to decide what to bring with him to his new home. Draco contemplated in front of the mirror that morning: what does one wear to see his once enemy turned housemate employer? He doesn't remember his mother ever teaching him about this type of situation and therefore, Draco was left grasping for straws trying to figure it out. But, he knew that Narcissa Malfoy, god rest her soul, would be aghast to see her son wearing anything but the best clothing to see one's companions, let alone the boy he had once swore to destroy. Therefore, Draco had scavenged through his wardrobe, deep inside the back, to find the clothing he had been able to salvage from his estate before he was rather violently evicted. As it turns out, association with Death Eaters
As the two chattered on about the hair pin, Draco turned towards his right and saw Potter and his ragtag duo. They were entering the pub, no doubt for a bubbly and creamy butterbeer. Harry noticed Draco across the road and smiled slightly, a little wink aimed towards the blond. Draco blushed and the bright pink burned against his milky skin in a way that caught the attention of his two companions.
"Rumor is that the Princess of Slytherin got her very own room, bought that with daddy's money, Malfoy?" Ronald scoffed in passing, only to be slapped in the arm by the girl next to him. Draco has officially decided that she was his favorite.
"Can anyone tell me what you get when you mix golden holly and wormwood?" Snape's voice boomed through the room, bouncing off the walls and straight into the ears of his rather bored looking students. When he saw that no one else was answering, Draco's little pale hand shyly raised and caught the eye of his godfather.
Draco stomped his way back to his room, flinging his door open and shutting it closed with a loud clamber that alarmed Lizzie, who was sleeping soundly on his bed. Draco practically threw himself onto it as well, whining into his silk pillows. Who do they think they are?! How could they be so rude to someone they don't even know?? Draco's ears burned from how red his blush was, flustered and warm. He decided from there on that he hated Ronald Weasley, he hated Gryffindors and he hated the boy who made him feel silly, childish and bratty. He hated Harry Potter!
Draco changed into a baby pink sundress, one that flowed easily in the wind and accentuated his light curves. His hair was kept loose, except for the ribbon that was woven in and tied off into a bow. Draco packed a few novels he would like to read, as well as a hat incase the sun was too abrasive. The boy heard the carriage stroll up to his entrance and he was soon skittering down the stairs, heels clacking against the wood.
Somewhere along the way, Draco lost the rest of the crowd. Blaming it on the absolutely labyrinthine way the estate was built, Draco began to wander on his own. The entire mansion was an art piece in of itself. Draco had never been surrounded by so many priceless masterpieces; he felt as if he were in the Louvre. Beautiful paintings, enchanting statues, absolutely delicate china cups and plates. Draco's eyes twinkled with delight upon each one. Strolling slowly through the halls, the piercing silence was cut by the sound of his heels clicking across the marble tiles. The sunlight seeped through crystalline windows and shined against his flaxen blonde hair. As he walked through, eyes scanning through each portrait, he came across one in particular. A young lady, ashy blonde hair tied into a bun with her pale face turned downwards. She was reading, her eyes focused on the pages. Her pale skin contrasted with the lemon yellow of her dress. Draco found himself inching closer and closer, a hand reaching out as if to touch the paint.
"The music has begun and it would be rather unsightly for us to just leave the dance floor," Harry whispered in hushed tones, "As much as you may detest me, I implore you resist the urge to storm off as we do this." Harry scooped up Draco by the waist and hand, gliding across the floor in unison with the other dance partners. The music had flooded the room and Draco couldn't break eye contact with Harry. Resentment and anger bubbled up underneath as the two of them were pulled together, chest to chest. Draco searched Harry's eyes and found once again an emotion he could not put his finger on. The dancing had caused the two of them to pant, hot breath hitting each other's faces. Draco found his heart racing in a way it hadn't been with Mr. Nott. His entire body trembled as Harry's hand rested lower on his hip. His confidence shriveled and once more, Draco found himself feeling like a naive child, shy and embarrassed. Harry's eyes were cooly watching him, showing no sign of fluster.
"No! They're just friends! Geez Potter, obsessed with me much? Bored with your tragic little life?" Draco sneered, his nose turned up higher and arms crossed defensively. He doesn't know why he's being so rude anyways. He doesn't want to be rude to Harry. He wants to go back to that time, feel the heat of the fireplace on his face and stare into warm hazel eyes. But of course, all was fair in love and war and right now, on the outside, Draco and Harry were supposed to be at war. He doesn't know what it was about Harry that made Draco feel…. Small. Weak… childish and embarrassed. It was an unpleasant feeling and it made Draco want to lash out. It wasn't very "Malfoy-esque" of him, and he's sure his father would disapprove of such a tantrum, but the words spewed out like oil, slippery and wet.
Harry's shirt was completely unbuttoned, showing off his broad and tanned chest, what looked like it was sculpted by the hands of the great artists themselves. Draco's eyes never left Harry's chest, untamed black chest hair covered the expanse of skin, leading down further and further and further, down to the edge of his pants-
"Wh-what is that? What's going on?" She said with an annoyed growl. Her body rising from sleep and her curled hair falling messily around her.
The Gryffindor Common Room looked different when it wasn't pitch black from the night and shrouded in moonlight. It was warm, burnt oranges, fiery reds, bright yellows. It was brimming with energy, Draco could feel, as he watched Harry rummaging around a cabinet next to the fireplace.
After that night, Draco began accruing quite the reputation in Knockturn alley. 30 galleons for a handjob, 50 for a blow, 100 for a quick fuck, and 300 for a night with the prettiest boy you would ever see in your life. Draco hadn't been on the streets since then and with every man, Draco's anger began to disappear like a flickering flame in a downpour. All that was left was the curling smoke of a once lit fire and all the sadness a boy could hold. Such a life had given Draco time for contemplation and he found that he had no one to be angry with but himself. He wasn't the victim. He was the bloody problem. The boy had chosen to wear his dark mark with pride, all those years ago. He had chosen to treat others like scum, like rats scattering at his feet. He had chosen to fill his life with luxuries and riches, only to not truly appreciate them in the end. Draco was ashamed to admit that at one point in his life, a sickening and low point of his life, he had once been proud to be considered a future bride for the Dark Lord. It was considered an honor, after all. Now, the reminder of his behavior makes his stomach curl and the tea that warmed him and the bread that sustained him suddenly felt like ash in his mouth.
The silence between Harry and Draco was thick with tension, both of them simply staring at different things, avoiding each other's eyes.
Draco's face blushed and he whipped around to face his mother. "Unbelievable! How did you even hear about this?? Hermione didn't tell me until this morning!"
"Oh? That? Well, I learned it quite young as a way to convince my father of pretty much… anything?" Draco smirked sheepishly, hands coming down to undo his parka and place it next to him. The warmth of the fireplace was making him overheat in his new downy coat.
"Oh! So sorry to interrupt!" A maid had appeared with a pile of folded towels in hand. Her presence alarmed Draco and Harry and suddenly, the younger pushed away from the closeness, walking down the hall in an attempt to get as far away as possible. Harry wanted to call out, to tell him to wait. He turned to the maid and told her it was alright, it wasn't her fault, but by the time he turned back, Draco was gone.
Draco looked up from his punch and there he was. Thomas Nott. 17 years old, green eyes, dark hair, broad chest. Draco smiled and nodded.
"For the last time! Harry Potter and I are not! Getting! Married!" Draco exclaimed, repeatedly hitting Hermione with the pillow, ignoring her whining and giggles and gasping. Hermione armed herself with another pillow, retaliating promptly into what become a full out pillow-war.
"Come on, those are the types of men you like~ you always have enjoyed a challenge. Besides, I do remember him being dark, brooding, handsome-"
"Dinner will be ready in 30 minutes," a butler announced, bowing politely and leaving once more to the kitchen. Ronald glanced over at Hermione and smiled before he slapped his hands against his thighs and stood up. "Well! I'll be checking up on things in the kitchen. Uhhh...Hermione, would you please join me?"
"Oh, don't you know how to make me sound like a cattle being sold," Draco snapped at his mother, hearing the rumble of soft laughter in his father's chest. The action made him feel warm inside, affection swimming through him. Lucius brought a gloved hand up to Draco's head and tousled his hair affectionately, making Draco whine in annoyance, trying desperately to smooth his hair back down.
T.N., better known as Thomas Nott, was an 18 year old upperclassmen that Draco had met last year at a particularly rowdy celebration after Slytherin had won the Quidditch Finale. Before being swept away into the festivities, Draco noticed Harry's face, how it crumpled in frustration and threw his helmet down with vigor. A battle against Slytherin? This was Gryffindor's shining moment and in the last 10 seconds, Potter had choked. The Golden boy was suddenly decrowned and dethroned. Draco knew he should be happy for his house team winning and he was happy! He was delighted! But the sight of such a dejected Potter was slightly unnerving and suddenly, the sadness was once again creeping into the back of his mind.
Harry stilled, his lips curling into a frown. "The man is a liar and a cheat. I don't wish to see you consorting with the lowest of men. But I will say, you seemed quite comfortable with him, perhaps you're just as wanton as I originally thought."
"You'd have me be a child bride!?" Draco whined, his fingers gripping Harry's even tighter as they began to see the glowing lights of the party and the sounds of music once again flow. "And no, no no no! I will not elope like it's some shitty shotgun wedding." Draco and Harry began to see the guests once more. "We'll have a beautiful wedding. Nearly 300 guests. And it'll be here maybe, so my mother can plan it!" Draco smiled, and Harry was lost in his crystal eyes. He didn't even notice the guests around them, Death Eaters and criminals alike. Who cared anymore, the darkness that seeped into the room from the guests. Not when he had the most dazzling thing in his own hands.
The cat's elegant neck scooped down to sniff lightly, and finally, she nudged her head against Draco's hand, eyes closing in content as Draco excitedly began to scratch.
After about an hour, Draco and Hermione found themselves in a secluded area, away from the commotion of the party. They tittered away, making a note of the other guests and making fun of some of them. Hermione was pulled away by Ron and although Draco was happy for her, he felt slightly lonely now that his only friend at the party was occupied by another. Standing alone, Draco quietly sipped his champagne, watching the party unfold before him. A light tap on the shoulder alerted him. Draco turned around, only to be faced with the soldier from before.
"Now I know for a fact that's untrue! He adores you! The way he looks at you as if you were the moon and he a lonely poet wishing to write of your beauty! It's all so endearing. He's absolutely enthralled by you, Draco. I bet he fantasizes about your life together, domestic bliss~"
"Well…" Draco sat up, "I would like to keep the Malfoy tradition of a Holiday party. With music and dancing and games and-"
"Our little Draco refuses to become slave to love, it seems," Hermione attempted to speak over the sound of the entire hall and smiled, ignoring Draco's whining.
Hermione rolled her eyes in tandem and decided to just say, "Hello Draco, how are you doing today?" She was the polite one out of the group, the only one Draco had any inkling of respect for. She would've made a wonderful Slytherin, he thinks.
Draco could do nothing but gawk. "How dare you, sir! Disgusting man! I assure you I will never marry! Marriage is a certain death!" he pushed past Harry to the party, wishing not to let the older man see his trembling lips or shaking hands. Draco wished to go home, he wished to never see Harry Potter again, the man who has confused him and the man he hated and the man who made him feel a fire in his stomach and the man who sounded like deep molasses dripping on Draco's lips. Draco could only reach so far before he was once again pulled back, back onto the balcony and fixed between Harry's arms. Pinned down by two hands on either side of him, Draco could see what could only be described as pain on Harry's face. They remained silent for a few seconds. Harry spoke up first.
"Mother! Father! I'm home," Draco called as he entered through the door, untying his coat and setting down his basket. He heard the bustling of maids and cooks in the back kitchen and his mother's heels clicking down on mahogany floors.
"I...I really do love you, Draco." Harry wheezed out, his cheeks aflame and his palms suddenly sweaty. But Draco didn't seem to mind as he jumped up into Harry's arms, squealing and hugging the boy. Harry clumsily grabbed Draco's waist to ensure the boy didn't fall, laughing nervously as Draco began to litter kisses across his cheek, jaw, and neck.
"And how will we ever do that, darling dearest?" Ron smirked, bringing the sandwich to his mouth and taking a large bite, getting cream cheese on the corners of his lips. Hermione rolled her eyes with a small curling smile at the corners of her mouth.
"Mother, please," he whined, sitting down on his bed as his mother sifted through his closet and pulled out various garments for Draco to try on. "I was a child, after all."
"We don't like each other 'Mione. In fact, I am beginning to think Harry Potter finds nothing more than pleasure in torturing me," Draco drawled as he undid his braided hair and began to braid it again, anxious fingers getting tangled in silver locks. Draco's voice held slight sadness as he spoke and Hermione's heart broke in two.
He had little clothing to put away and the sight of how little space they took up in his new closet made him wince. It was pathetic, wasn't it? A sad sight. Draco tried to not dwell on the fact his belongings were all able to fit in one chest, deciding instead to focus on how he was going to display his momentos...if Harry would allow him of course. Perhaps he wouldn't cherish the photos of former Death Eaters to be hung up in his home. Draco hated the thought that Harry might destroy them, therefore the blonde shoved his photos into the bedside table drawer and shut them away.
"Well, I thought it was appropriate for a pretentious princess like you. Besides, I thought you liked all that fluffy crap, " Harry scoffed back under his breath, nearly downing his tea in one gulp, ignoring the scalding hot liquid burning his throat. Draco remained quiet, looking down at the amber tea in his cup.
"You're right," Harry shrugged, taking Draco's hand in his as they walked down the stairs, "Children can wait, but maybe we could run away together, get married now. There are some places that do that you know? We could elope."
Harry's eyes skipped over to Draco's. It made both boys freeze slightly.  Draco didn't exactly know what they were. They didn't exactly talk to each other, but they weren't very rude to each other either. Sometimes they'd exchange short quips before being pulled away by their respective parties. Draco had noticed that Harry wasn't like the boy he was the first time they'd met. He'd rather filled into his clothes, becoming stronger and more built (perhaps it was all the quidditch). As much as Draco enjoyed the boys in Slytherin, he finds himself having a preference of the boyishly charming Gryffindor men who look as though they're dumber than hammers but good Lord could they probably lift Draco up like a feather. Harry's lips slightly curled at the corners and Draco's powder blush wasn't very necessary now was it? His cheeks were already turning cherry red.
"I do. I really do. Thank you." Draco placed the stone in his palm as he reached out to hug the man, nuzzling his face into his neck. Snape let out a sigh and gently patted the boy's back before letting go.
Draco didn't say a word as McGonagall had declared that he would be spared, that he would be able to see another day. In some ways, it was worse than death, what McGonagall proposed. Perhaps she hadn't seen it that way, but what life was there for a former Death Eater? What else could be worth living now that everyone he's ever loved is dead?
"You'd be advised," Snape began in his usual rolling drawl, "To avoid anyone of the Lestrange family, Potter."
"Have you heard about the men who have purchased the estates down in Derbyshire?" Hermione asked as she ran her hands down the piles of fruits that were for sale, picking some up and bringing them to her nose to smell and then placing down again.
"Ah, well I met Mr. Malfoy at Mr. Weasley's gala, and the two of us seemed to have hit it off," Theodore grinned over at Draco, who blushed deeply and averted his eyes, trying to hide his growing smile. Hermione was less enthused. She hummed and nodded her head.
Draco noticed another boy next to the first, straight ginger hair and a splattering of freckles that made him look like a piece of paper that had ink spilled on it. They stared back at Draco with curious eyes, the ginger turning to the brunette and whispering things in his ear, then glancing back at Draco. This annoyed Draco slightly, knowing that they're probably talking about him.
It wasn't exactly an insult. But it wasn't exactly a compliment. Draco wasn't sure how to react. He's used to being fawned over and adored, but he was also used to boys like Ron who made fun of him for his "more than self-care" aesthetics. So when a boy like Harry gives him a half compliment half insult, Draco can't help but just turn bright red and stomp off.
"Thank you," he muttered back softly, not daring to look Harry in the eyes. He hadn't denied the first comment and Harry found it odd he didn't have his usual witty retorts armed.
"Business as usual, but I don't expect you came in here just to ask about that," Dimitri scoffed, carrying out a tray of stale breads that were left over from last night. "So what are you doing here, little bábika?" He raised an eyebrow, a knowing smirk like a particularly smug dog.
"O-oh, Theodore. What brings you to town?" Draco asked, twirling his locks of hair nervously, suddenly more school girl than a grown man. Theodore took off his army hat, holding it to his chest.
"Wait," Harry shot his hand out to grab Draco's wrist. Draco's eyes shot down to the offending hand and then back to Harry's face. He looked...hurt. Pained...Desperate.
"I mean…" Harry turned to Draco. "I mean do you ever wish you were someone else. Something else?" Draco's heart tugged a little at the question, his stomach tightening and fluttering all the same. What was he supposed to say anyways? He wasn't exactly well equipped to deal with a depressed Potter at 2 am. Part of Draco wished Harry would just say he was joking, wished he would just revert back to his slightly teasing, snarky attitude. That, Draco could deal with. This? Draco had no idea what to do. He slowly walked back over to Harry, fists curled tightly. He shouldn't do this. He knows he shouldn't. What would his father say if he knew what his precious son was doing in the middle of the night? With a strange boy in a strange place..not to mention Tom as well. But against all reason, Draco sat down gingerly next to Harry. He was a well distance away from him on the couch, but Draco couldn't tell if it was the heat from the fireplace or the body heat radiating off of Harry that made his entire being burn uncomfortably warm.
Harry's head snapped towards the door once the two came back from the restroom. Harry watched as Hermione took her seat once more, but suddenly Harry's eyes caught sight of Draco's eyes. They were puffy and pink, slate grey turned glassy as wetness stuck to his long eyelashes. Harry's eyebrows couldn't help but furrow in confusion and worry as Draco took his seat back at the table, eyes not dating to fall upon Harry's.
Before Harry could respond, Draco came strolling back towards them, gasping with delight as he saw Severus. "Uncle!" He smiled sweetly, hugging the man. Snape's stoic resolve broke slightly at the sight of Draco, allowing the boy to wrap himself around the man's chest. Snape did the same and patted Draco's back fondly, smiling ever so slightly. Harry didn't know Snape was even capable of such a facial expression. It was unusual on such a stoic face and Harry supposed he's one of the few select people who will ever be able to see such an expression ever again. But upon noticing Harry staring quite amusingly at them, Severus stiffened his back and gently nudged Draco back.
"Coming!" Draco smiled, picking up the crate and moving to the exit. "Don't worry, I won't keep you in here for too long! I promise! You'll live like royalty….what should I even name you? You look like royalty…" Draco knew that his new pet would not be able to understand him, but he suspected that she didn't necessarily mind his chatter as she laid down on the floor of her crate and closed her eyes. "Perhaps I should name you after the Queen? She's rather stylish. Elizabeth? Mmm...that's rather formal. Perhaps that'll be your full name. I could call you Lizzie for short!"
"Your posse seems quite protective of you," Harry drawled, leaning against the brick wall of the shoppe. "Must be nice to be a princess," he added with a small sneer that made Draco huff and cross his arms.
"Good morning, Mother," he yawned as he sat down at the dining table, breakfast already being brought in front of him by one of their chefs. A plate of poached eggs, two slices of toast, and a cup of tea. Narcissa had always insisted Draco eat slimming and simple meals (The boy had a tendency to gain weight and it tended to go straight to his hips. While Narcissa called them "child-bearing hips", Draco called them "nuisances".)
"Have you ever been inside the school when no one was there?" Harry said from his shoulder, walking towards the entrance of the giant manor.
Draco's cheeks rushed red at the mention of Harry. So, it was the golden boy cad who had decorated this disaster. The blonde sat down gently on the bed, small fingers running mindlessly against the sewn in creatures on his duvet as Draco's eyes moved inch-by-inch around the room. "Why did he think I would like all of this?" Draco asked softly. What he would really like to ask is
Draco couldn't sleep that night. The moonlight streamed through his drawn curtains, filling the room with a white light that reflected off of each surface and into Draco's eyes. He couldn't sleep just as he couldn't stop his fingertips from tracing his lips softly, feeling the tingle within them as he remembered over and over how Harry Potter had taken him by the waist and kissed him. With a frustrated groan, Draco tossed and turned in his bed, his hair splayed around him and entangled in all different directions.
"What are we not telling me?" Lucius strolled into the room, ever the lordly lion he was. He walked with the grace and poise that any distinguished gentleman would be expected to have. To others, Lucius came off as a fearsome and solemn man who was not to be trifled with. But for the likes of Draco, he was a kind and loving father. Once the accusations of being cronies with the Dark One had subsided, the Malfoy name was vindicated, if only to be rumored about in the back alleys and corners of different walks of life.
"You don't have to look so scared, you know," Harry half chuckled, slicking back the strands of hair that were sticking out. He was slightly amused to see Draco squirm. It was both entertaining and endearing to watch. He looked more...innocent now. Less sharp and malevolent. It was like growing up with an angry and vicious kitten only to realize years later that they were just scared. Draco attempted to calm down, sitting back in his seat and uncrossing his legs. Harry's lips curled at the corners, only slightly. "I'll be back late."
Before he could close the door entirely, Harry shoved out a hand and pushed it open. With a renewed energy and intensity, Harry pulled Draco closer and suddenly, their lips met. Draco's eyes shut closed, the air knocked from his lungs as Harry took his face into his hands, deepening the kiss and pulling Draco closer into his arms. Draco's lips were plush against Harry's and Draco could feel heat fall from his chest to his stomach, erupting into fluttering waves. Like a hummingbird, Draco's heart thrummed in his chest.
"Then perhaps we should work extra hard to find such a man for you~ the poorer the better since you seem to detest rich men," Hermione teased once more, which earned a sharp shove from Draco, causing Hermione to giggle.
"Well," Draco rubbed his neck sheepishly, "I may have thrown a particularly annoying tantrum until he became exhausted enough to say yes."
One would think, in a school as large and grand as Hogwarts, you'd be able to go your entire school career without seeing the same person twice. Draco didn't know if there was some cosmic force against him, or if he had really pissed off some celestial goddess. But for four years, Draco has nothing but terrible, shitty luck. Everywhere he turned, the ragtag trio were surely around the corner. Draco was sure to always  put on his usual "devil-may-care" attitude and hurl light insults. He bickered with Ron, like an Irish Setter barking at a particularly stubborn tabby. Hermione was usually giggling and trying to hide her amusement as Ron failed to outwit Draco's sparkling vernacular. Harry, meanwhile… Draco still cannot wrap his pretty little head around the elusive Harry Potter, The Golden Boy. They often shared glances, Draco would look away first as Harry stared him down. Draco would notice that Harry stared at him often actually. Whenever Draco was nearby, all eyes were usually on him. Underclassman, upperclassmen, even some particularly suspicious professors that Draco could probably flirt with to get a good grade in his class. But Harry was the only one that truly got under his skin.
"We plan a get-together of course," she said as she sat up, "You send out invitations, perhaps for a game night or a dinner party, only the four of us, you, me, Draco, and Harry. But we don't tell them that the other is invited."
"Fine, fine alright get in. But he better be gone by tomorrow morning," she huffed, her portrait swinging open to reveal the Gryffindor common room. Golds and reds plastered all over the walls, Draco felt himself swallow a little nervously as Harry ushered him inside. The room was cozy, warm from the blazing orange fire that was burning in the hearth. Charmed, Draco supposed, to burn all through the winter nights. He felt out of place, a snake in the lion's den. The snores of sleeping Gryffindors rang in his ears from upstairs and Draco awkwardly stood in the middle, watching as Harry plopped down on the couch and began undoing his scarf and coat. The lights were off and other than the glow of the fire, the entire room was dark and the moon light shone through the windows. Draco turned back to Harry and rubbed his neck nervously.
"But it has to be the right one, daddy," Draco muttered, his eyes never leaving the animals. He finally came across a beautiful Blue Russian cat, a sparkling gray coat and brilliant green blue eyes, Draco whipped around to his father behind him, attempting to put on the best "Please, Daddy~" eyes he could.
"Hello?? No students are allowed out after curfew!" It was Argus Filtch, the school security guard. He was known for prowling the school grounds at night, looking for any kids, like Draco, who had disobeyed curfew. Draco cursed under his breath and began to sneak out. He had half the mind to just let himself get caught and he saw the light of Filth's lantern coming closer and closer. About a second before Draco would've been found, he was suddenly pulled to the corner corridor. Draco's eyes shut as he felt himself be pressed against a warm body, solid and broad and smelt of tea and cedar pine. Hot breath fanned against Draco's face and neck, broad hands holding tightly onto his waist. It felt as if there was a large cloth or cloak surrounding him, heavy and thick and kept the cold away. Draco kept his eyes shut, trying to ignore the cold shiver of nerves that ran down his back as he heard Filth's steps pass right by them. How did he not see them? Draco wondered. After all, they were pretty out in the open.
"Malfoy!" Harry gasped out, fingers curling into a fist, white knuckled and red palmed. "I...I need a housekeeper."
"I'm done!" He exclaimed hurriedly and pushed out his chair with a loud screech, watching as the owl took off from it's branch in one powerful swoop.
Harry seemed to silence at that remark and Draco felt personally vindicated. He wanted to pat himself on the back for such a clever reply. Harry sighed, crossing his arms and taking in Draco's shaking body. He was only wearing a thin sweater, probably an attempt to make himself more appealing to Tom. Draco squirmed under Harry's gaze and in the dark, inky night, Draco could clearly make out his forest green eyes. Finally, Harry nudged his head to the side. "Come on, let's go inside before your Royal Arse freezes off." He pushes off of the wall that he was leaning against. Harry began to walk back inside without another word. Draco froze in place as he watched Harry walking cooly into the school, his wand drawn and glowing dimly at the tip to provide little lighted guidance. When Harry realized Draco wasn't following behind him, he turned his head back, "Are you coming or what?"
Slowly, Harry pulled away. Draco's eyes fluttered open and his pupils were wide as he tried to catch his breath.
"So, what did you two talk about once we all retired to bed?" Hermione asked with a mischievous smile on her lips, picking at the fruit placed in front of her.
Draco snorted and let out an exasperated "ha" as he closed his book. "Oh, wouldn't that be lovely, my mother will be thrilled!" Draco exclaimed sarcastically, setting the book back down and picking up his wicker shopping basket again. "If he's anything like the other extremely wealthy men who cooly and mysteriously buy mansions at the end of the road, he'll be nothing but arrogant and prideful."
"I believe a certain Mr. Potter will be there," Lucius smirked from behind his papers as he heard his wife gasp and begin to rejoice.
"Is that any of your business?" Draco snapped, his crystal eyes darting up to Harry, then back down to the ground. "I should go, really… I…" Draco turned on his heel, but was stopped by the hand that wrapped around his wrist to pull him back. Harry's eyes glanced down at the sleeve that had ridden up Draco's arm, the black ink underneath made his pupils widen ever so slightly. Draco immediately pulled down the fabric to cover it. "Let me go, Potter," He whined, pulling against Harry's grasp. Harry marveled at the way his hand completely wrapped around Draco's fragile wrist. His eyes turned up towards Draco's face and there, the image of the dead woman flashed in front of his eyes. For a second, maybe even less, Harry imagined it was Draco's dead and cold body lying on the stone ground, delicate neck slit across and crimson blood dripping onto milky skin.
The boy sat up in his bed and walked over to his closet, sifting through the different clothes he has. Finally deciding on a billowy satin shirt with a waistcoat and slacks that were tighter than they had to be, accentuating his doll-like waist and thin legs. Rubbing some rose oil into his soft skin and bending over to lace up his leather heeled boots. Draco began to fiddle with his clothing in the mirror, eyes glancing over to his dresser table and spotting a pot of lip rouge. His mother must have left it there on purpose and the thought made Draco roll his eyes. But, regardless, he snatched the pot into his hand and began to dab pigment onto his already pink plump lips and some on his cheekbones. Draco always did teeter on the edges of masculine and feminine, blurring the lines between the two and creating his own fashion. Draco left his room and found himself walking into his father. The man was an intimidating figure, taller than Draco by considerable inches. While Draco was a mix of his mother's soft skin, he had most definitely inherited his father's sharp bone structure. Lucius was a stoic man, one less inclined to show emotions through prose and more in actions. Upon seeing his son, Lucius' falcon-like features softened.
Harry and Draco landed back abruptly, making Draco fall onto his ass with a "oof". Harry extended his hand out to lift the boy up, but Draco simply growled and stood up himself, disregarding the helping hand and brushing himself off instead.
The two of them stood in the dark hallway, Harry stroking Draco's hair and Draco crying softly. The boy pulled his face up from Harry's chest and sniffled. "You're an asshole, Harry Potter. A right wanker." Draco's words came out harsh and weepy. Harry simply smiled, nodded and sighed. "I know I am, I'm sorry."
Harry nodded hurriedly, his gelled back hair beginning to fall out of place and he knew that Ron would be wondering what had happened to him back at the crime scene. But he didn't really care. In this moment, he could only really focus on Draco before him and the idea of his little body on the snowy ground, vulnerable and lifeless.
Draco quickly pulled back his fingers, cradling them in his chest as he whipped around and away from the painting. "I'm so so-" Draco turned pink in the cheeks as he was confronted with Harry, his arms folded and a quizzical raised eyebrow. Draco's sudden shock turned into annoyance. Harry cooly drifted from where he was, suddenly next to Draco and staring up at the painting as well. Draco's eyes shifted between Harry and the painting. The closeness was burning and Draco fought the urge to fidget in his spot. He turned his focus back to the painting, trying not to seem nervous. He took notice of the small details, the way her fingers curled around the spine of her book, the turn of her nose, the slope of her lips.
Draco bit his bottom lip and a gentle 'wait' made Harry stop in his tracks and whip around. The boy hadn't moved an inch from his place in the road, looking down at his scuffed up shoes and red rubbed knees. Harry gulped as he watched Draco brush the hair from his eyes and sigh. "I can't...use the Floo. I'm not allowed."
Draco's delicate features contorted into one like a scorn feline, eyes widening and metaphorical ears pushed down against his head. He yanked his hands back and huffed, "Fuck you, Dimitri!"
Draco stared back at the boy as if he grew another head. "What are you talking about?" Draco felt his skin erupt in goosebumps and the hairs on the back of his neck stand up at the implication of Harry Potter being his husband, even if it was pretend.
"Draconius Lucien Malfoy, but you can call me Draco." His smile was dazzling, Draco was sure and his hand was stretched out all inviting. He was certain that Harry would fall in love with him just as everyone else would, just like all other boys and men did.
"Perhaps it would be best if you two stayed the night. After all, it's raining quite harshly." Ron suggested in a lighthearted tone.
"If you expect me to clean this entire house by myself, you're sorely mistaken," Draco scoffed, turning on his heel to stare at Harry straight on. These years have treated Harry well, Draco thought as his eyes scanned the brunette's face. While Draco himself had stayed more or less the same in terms of appearance, it seems that Harry had taken on a new sense of style. A fine beard had begun to sprout on Harry's cheeks and chin and Draco wondered if it was intentional or if the man couldn't find the time to shave his morning shadow. His cheeks, no longer soft with childhood tenderness, have hardened and have become concave shallow pools on his face. His jaw has sharpened to a deadly point, strong and sturdy and making Draco's own stomach warm deep down.
"I had never implied that you were. I simply wished to inform you that was what you looked like at the time." It was deadpanned and stale and yet it cut deep into Draco's skin and the boy couldn't help but flinch.
"I can barely clean," Draco blurted. "And I'm useless when it comes to cooking. I would be a pretty shit housekeeper" He was blushing, pretty pink flushing his cheeks and Harry wondered what it would look like all over his milky body. He couldn't meet Harry's eyes, as if he was shy to admit he could barely care for himself. Harry smiled and sighed, brushing a strand of loose hair back behind Draco's ear.
"There has to be a way of getting these two lonely souls together," Hermione drawled as she fanned herself, the summer breeze flowing into the room proved itself to be too hot to bother. Summers in Derbyshire had always been scorching endurance tests, beating down on the poor residents of the town. She was draped across a lounge chaise, attempting to dab the sweat from her temples before it ran down and ruined her makeup. It would be a pity after all, since she was currently in the company of Mr. Granger. Hermione and Ronald had become closer as time passed and their infatuation with each other was nothing of a secret. The two often visited each other, taking leisurely walks around town or sitting down for afternoon tea. Today, Hermione was in Ron's drawing room, chatting with the man.
Narcissa clapped her hands, "Come now Draco, we MUST find the perfect outfit for you!" She exclaimed as she dragged her son up to his room, regardless of Draco's whines. "Something new, preferably, and something beautiful. Perhaps your father will lend you some clothing? Well, maybe not. I mean, after all you do look better in MY clothes," she teased, ignoring Draco's growing red cheeks. "Oh how I remember when you were a little thing and would try on my petticoats and lip rouges."
"You seem lost, thinking about something? Or...someone?" She smirked, causing the other to roll his eyes and tsk.
"Well! Perhaps we should show our guests the estate, Harry. That should liven our spirits," Ron blurted out, taking Hermione by the hand to help her off the couch. Draco took note of Mr. Potter's name, Harry. Mr. Potter stood up from his spot and walked up to where Draco was seated. He held his hand out for Draco to hold, a large and calloused hand that seemed it would engulf Draco's smaller, daintier one. This made Draco roll his eyes. The blonde ignored Harry's hand and simply stood up on his own, following the other two as they left the room. Harry retreated his hand, curling his fingers at his side as he followed.
Upon seeing Draco, Mr. Potter shot up from his seat, bowing deeply. Mr. Weasley bowed as well, except in a more natural and friendly demeanor. Hermione blushed vibrantly when Mr. Weasley kissed the back of her hand. Draco smiled at her, happy that she and him were getting along well. When Draco turned back to Mr. Potter, those dark eyes were once again staring at him, searching him, trying desperately to understand him.
"You don't know that, perhaps he'll be at Mr. Weasley's home! You should come with me!!" Hermione gleamed, gripping Draco's hands. "Please! Come with me please!! I don't want to go alone, I can't! I shan't"
"Oh, on the contrary, ma cherie~" Draco quickly skirted up to Dimitri as he was turning around, wrapping his lithe arms around the man's neck. Draco brushed his chest against Dimitri's as he nuzzled into his neck, the prickle of facial hair making shivers spark down Draco's spine. "I was just wondering if you were perhaps lonely? I mean after all, it's been a while since your wife left you~" Draco bit his lip and glanced up at the man, his cloudy grey eyes as sweet as a doe. Dimitri stared down at the boy, who wantonly clutched onto him, "Draco you know I shouldn't…" he brought a hand up to Draco's cheek, soft and supple, and stroked it with a calloused thumb.
"He's going on an outing, darling. Let the boy have some fun while he's still young." Lucius smiled as Narcissa sat down across him from, stirring her tea.
"Then I would say that you're in love with Mr. Potter and wish to carry his children, but it's pointless isn't it? You'd just deny it." Hermione said matter-of-factly, hugging an embroidered pillow to her chest.
Draco scoffed at the remark, had Harry completely forgotten about their shared tears, secret and shushed endearments and their passionate embrace, as quick and sweet as it was? Or perhaps he remembered and regretted it, regretted the entire event and decided to forget about it. Ronald and Hermione noticed Draco's angry picking at his plate of food, sharing concern glances and noticing that Harry was frustratedly puffing his cigar, the smoke curling around then in a hazy trance. The two of them raised their eyebrows in intrigue, shrugging slightly and turning back to their own devices.
"Harry where have you-" Draco was cut off by Harry's hand gripping tighter around his waist to the point that Draco worried that Harry's fingerprints would bruise the soft and milky skin on his hip. A glaring contrast of a blackberry colored bruise against alabaster skin. Harry stuck out his free hand to hold in front of Fenrir.
"So we have ourselves a regular Jack the Ripper, eh?" Ron sighed, "This is the third one this month! They're all the same too- blonde, small, prostitutes…"
"When little Draco was born, the Dark Lord was elated. He had been blessed by his Excellency upon his birth. Rumor had it that he was to be the chosen one, the bride for our master."
"Uh, here. I'll show you." Harry scurried over towards the large box tucked away in the corner. He wheeled it out to the front of the living room, feeling a rush run down his spine as he watched Draco's confusion turn into interest. The blonde scooted closer to the edging of his seat, blinking in surprise as Harry fished out another, smaller black rectangle from the drawer. He sat down gingerly next to Draco, making the boy scoot in slightly to watch Harry's actions. "Look, this is the remote," he began, "And you press these buttons to control it." Harry pushed the 'on' button which made the TV come to life and shock Draco entirely. "See, you can change the channels with the buttons as well," he demonstrated for the blonde, who watched with wide doe eyes and keen interest.
As a child, Harry never gave too much thought towards marriage. He was the only child of his father, after all, he would be receiving the family property. Nothing of the sacrament really interested him before. He enjoyed his alone time, reveling in solitude. A wife and children would only be bothersome and besides, he had never found interest in the empty-headed and superficial women he came across on his travels. Each one of them flashing wicked smiles and fluttering eyelashes the minute Harry had shown anything of his wealth. It was off-putting to say the least, these women groveling at his feet just because he was of good financial standing.
Draco's eyebrow raised and he crossed his arms, leaning against a column. "Oh? And here I was under the impression that I was a precocious waif," Draco hadn't mean such vitriol to spill from his mouth, but it came like a torrent, an unstoppable force. He watched as Harry swallowed, his adam's apple bobbing.
"I don't suppose you should tell your father. The thought of his son with a harem of admirers may put a sour taste in his mouth. You're truly growing up too soon, Draco." Narcissa sighed as she placed flower arrangements around the room, each prettier than the last. Their conversation soon came to an abrupt end when they heard the clicking of riding boot heels against the marble floor.
"I see you've met Mr. Malfoy," Harry deadpanned, eyes shifting over to Draco and Draco could swear he saw them soften, even just a little. "I'm sorry to be interrupting your conversation."
"Hi, I'm Pansy and this is Blaise, obviously you already know Draco, isn't he a doll?" Pansy smiled, glancing back at Draco who was pleading with his eyes for the two not to embarrass him. Pansy smiled and turned back to Harry. "You're Harry Potter right? I'd know you anywhere! After all, you seem to always be hanging around Draco anyways~"
"Where in God's name are we?" Draco huffed, looking around while trying to take twigs out from his hair and outfit.
Draco's face burned at the words he read. Harry was teasing him, that was for sure. If anyone else were to read this letter, it would sound as if Harry was writing to his fiancé. He was keeping up their little game of House just to get a kick out of the blonde. He could practically see Harry's smug little face as he read the letter, hands creasing the paper at each side. But if Draco read the letter right, and he was sure he did since he read it over ten more times, this meant that Harry was going to come after all. Draco imagined what Harry would be like at a party like this. Probably awkward and reserved in a brooding and dashingly handsome sort of way. No doubt all the ladies and gentlemen of the room will want to try their chances at seducing him. But Draco's heart fluttered at the reminder that Harry was his companion for the evening, no one else's. He tucked the letter away in his dresser drawer and with a flick of the wand, he turned out the lights of his room. Sleeping that night would be a troubling thing for all he could think of was the party and what Harry would look like and how he should dress and what to say and what to do and how he would introduce Harry to others. He tossed and turned in his bed, unable to succumb to sleep. He most likely won't be able to until Harry arrives anyway.
"I'm only 25 years old and yet you insist I am already elderly? Then perhaps it would be correct of me to call you an impertinent little child," Harry snapped back, lips curling with satisfaction at the sight of Draco biting his bottom lip. The younger huffed and twirled on his heel, stomping away. "And may I ask, is your fashion popular with boys? Or in fact, ladies, perhaps?" Harry added, his words digging and digging and digging into Draco's skin until he finally-
Draco stood up and began walking to the exit. Before he could reach to push open the door, he paused and turned back to Harry. "This was...ok. I liked it."
"Daddy said that you could sleep in any of the guest rooms," Draco added, gently sitting on the edge of his bed.
"Oh I was just uh… leaving," Draco muttered as he sharply pushed between Hermione and Ron to get to the exit.
This response seemed to please Lucius as he nodded and spread the table napkin across his lap, beginning to eat. "I assure you, anything my child wears will be gorgeous. Only the best for the Malfoy family." Both Narcissa and Draco let out little breaths of relief and continued on with their breakfast.
Draco woke up with unfortunate bags under his eyes from his insomnia and his hair tangled and flying every which way. He slowly sat up in his bed, reveling in the feeling of his bones and joints cracking and stretching under the new pressure. The sunlight was seeping through into the room and little birds birds chirped outside merrily. Draco reached for his sterling silver hairbrush and began working on his bird nest of hair, carefully combing through it. He had decided to dress slightly more casual, form fitting trousers with a clean white button down blouse, a loose black ribbon tied around his neck. It was lovely, Draco mused. It would surely make Mr. Potter tongue-tied. Before leaving his bedroom, Draco's fingers reached out for a small vial of perfume, dripping some of the soft oil into his neck and down his chest.
"Yes my little doe," Lucius responded tursely, fixing his cufflinks as they reached their landing point. Diagon Alley was all aflutter with other children and their parents, all picking up the newest books and supplies, cauldrons and robes, and in Draco's case, reserved goods. They passed by Ollivander's, not needing to visit the wand-maker. Draco had inherited his grandfather's wand, 10" Hawthorn wood, unicorn hair. A rather plain wand, Draco whined as he received the magical item, but his father was quick to remind him that unicorns were some of the rarest creatures of all, that their hair was as fine and silver as Draco's. He was quick to remind Draco that being a Malfoy meant being rare and elusive, being above them all. For an 11 year old, Draco didn't exactly understand what his father meant, but knew he didn't want to disappoint.
"Exactly, and then, since it's way too late at night, you invite them to stay in your home-" Hermione's face inched closer to Ron's.
"And I'm taking this!" Draco snapped as he grabbed a baguette, slamming the door open and letting it close with a loud clang of brass hinges. Draco bit angrily into the bread as he ruminated on Dimitri's words, stomping angrily down the road. All associates of Voldemort and Death Eaters were stripped of their magic, forced to live as a muggle in the world they used to know and love. Usually, a person accused of mingling with dark forces was stripped entirely of their magic and then killed in order to assure they could never come back. But for Draco, the boy who was given one last chance to live, he was granted simple incantations. His wand was confiscated and destroyed, insurance that he would never do any conjuring more advanced that simple levitation and manifestation. Sure, Draco could do cheap parlor tricks: bring objects to himself, make objects disappear, but other than that he was as defenseless as a newborn.
"Honestly Malfoy, it's a valiant effort," Harry added, watching as the blond stared down at his soup with disappointment.
Draco felt as if he were caught in a whirlwind as he watched Harry. The boy was so calm, so unbothered. He said things with such confidence it made Draco's head spin. Their inside joke rolled off of Harry's tongue as if it were truth and it made Draco's entire body tense and nervous. Did he truly feel this way? Was marriage in their cards? Was Draco meant to just accept an engagement at 15 years old without a formal proposal at all? Or was this a joke? A long-con that just adds to Harry Potter's repertoire of mentally fucking with Draco Malfoy. If Draco continued with this game of theirs longer, he can't help but feel that he truly was meant to be Harry's wife. If he one day came to realize that it was all fake, a joke that had gone on for too long and therefore lost its punchline, Draco doesn't know if he'd be able to take it. The way Harry touched Draco, so familiarly; as if Harry's hand had belonged on Draco's skin. It made Draco… it made him…
"None of his cronies could give him the notes?" Ron asked as he rummaged through a bag of candy, kicking his legs up onto the small coffee table in front of them.
"Ronald? Are we on a first name basis now?" Draco teased, causing the girl to blush and giggle much like she had drunk one too many champagne flutes.
Draco snapped his mouth shut, his eyes drifting down to the ground. The silence was uncomfortable, a thick tension wrapped around them and enveloped them in a state of limbo. Neither of them dared to bring up last night's events, as if voicing them would only reaffirm that it truly, actually happened. The silence was insufferable and Draco couldn't help but shiver as the sun took it's leave and the moon began to rise from its slumber. The wind picked up and howled, a chill running down Draco's spine.
"I'm not scared!" Draco chirped back. "I'm...I'm just cautious, ok? I don't want to get caught!" Draco huffed "Besides, where are you even taking me??" Draco was abruptly interrupted when he bumped into Harry's back with a little 'oof'. Harry had come to a halting stop in front of a particular portrait of a rather rotund lady, dozing off against a Corinthian column and dressed lavishly in a Greek toga. The light of Harry's wand made her groan and blink awake.
Harry couldn't help but chuckle at the sight. "For someone with such a sour personality, you are quite cute sometimes."
"I assure you mother, Mr. Weasley has more than been taken by Hermione, not that he suits my tastes anyways," Draco drawled, picking at the dirt underneath his nails.
"Don't be like that, he's quite kind. A bit goofy, sure, but kind nonetheless." Hermione snatched the letter back, rolling her eyes as Draco's face scrunched up in distaste. "He's sweet and funny and interesting-"
"Nonsense! You must stay at least for the night!" Ron smiled, escorting everyone into the dining room. "Please, it'd be such a treat to have two lovely guests in my home."
"Now presenting, Sir Draco Malfoy." The attending announced. Draco's stormy grey eyes met wild hazel green.
"Yeah yeah, let us in alright?" Harry rolled his eyes. Draco was slightly amused by the annoyance etched into the boy's face. Only 15 and already harboring much frustration. Not good for wrinkles, Draco's mother would tut.
"He's gone, coast is clear." The mystery man whispered hotly into Draco's ear, shivers erupting on that side of his body. Draco began to open his eyes and look up at his savior.
"That tastes like absolute shit," Draco muttered, passing it back to Harry. "If you're going to drink something, at least find something that tastes good."
As Theodore turned around to catch up to his companions, Draco hadn't noticed the scowl that left Hermione's lips. "What an insufferable man," she mused.
The owl took off soon after and Draco plopped down onto his bed excitedly, pulling Lizzie up to his lap and petting her softly as he wiggled open the wax seal that kept the envelope shut. Lizzie made herself comfortable on Draco's lap, stretching out and yawning before finally laying down to sleep.
Draco turned once more towards the man and finally Harry cleared his throat and spoke, "I wonder what's taking those two so long in the kitchen?"
"Why did you invite me on this stroll, Mr. Potter?" Draco asked with a slight bite to his inner cheek. He glanced over to the man, his face as neutral and stoic as always.
Harry peered his head slightly to the side of Draco, grimaced, and looked back to Draco. "L-listen," Harry stuttered. "I think you should come with me…"
Draco could only spot little bits and pieces of the two new guests from his vantage point, only feeling Hermione tugging him down to whisper in his ear. "That's your new neighbor you know, a certain Mr. Weasley."
"Come on now, no cold feet," Harry tutted as he grabbed Draco by the arm. Suddenly, in a flash of light, the two apparatted away.
As the carriage waited outside the manor, Ronald and Harry walked their two guests outside, taking their hands to help them into the compartment. Draco took one hand and one foot, tempted to simply haul himself inside, but soon an open hand was presented to him to take. Draco's eyes never left Harry's as he took his open palm and climbed inside the carriage. The man soon turned around and left, without a word being spoken. The carriage drove off and Draco was now too far away from the Manor to see Harry curl his fingers into a fist and then stretch them out again.
"W-what are we doing here?" Malfoy shivered, his blue parka suddenly not enough to keep away the cold front coming from the water. Harry seemed warm enough in his Gryffindor uniform, didn't feel the need to dress up for such an occasion.
"They better get fucking used to it I guess," Draco beamed back at Harry. The two of them stared into each other's eyes. They were dancing around words that they knew they'd probably never say. The static energy in the air made their bodies buzz and Draco wanted nothing more than for it to stop.
"Well, Pansy and I are just going to go and uhhhh look at somethings," Blaise said while hurriedly trying to drag Pansy away against her protests. "Make sure you return our Draco just as you'd found him, Harry~" thus, leaving the blonde and brunette alone in the exit of Honeydukes.
"In no way am I ever going to marry if marrying means being tied down to a man who is anything like you," Draco spat like a kitten hissing.
"Ron, please just shut up. I don't wanna talk about this anymore," Harry barked as he rushed towards the Floo station.
Hello everyone! Please comment with suggestions or if you simply enjoyed this chapter. It really encourages me to continue writing! Thank you!
"No worries," Harry said back quickly. "I suppose it would look bad for nasty old Filtch to catch the Slytherin princess out past curfew, snogging with an upperclassman," Harry scoffed back with a smug grin on his face, brimming with glee as Draco's cheeks turned redder than they were from the frigid air.
"I...I suppose so? Don't lots of people feel that way?" Draco asked, avoiding eye contact the best he could. He fidgeted slightly, hands wringing together in a way Draco knows his mother would tell him to stop.
Draco still has not spoken a word, too shocked to speak. He gulped softly as Harry pulled away, hand reaching up to straighten his coat and smooth back his hair. Draco felt his knees buckle, gripping the granite balusters for stability. He felt sick, he felt elated, he felt angry, he felt scared. Too many emotions to understand, so little time to do it in. Harry had walked away, disappearing into the masses of men and women, a mask lost amongst the other masks.
"Whatever. Let's just drop it." Harry said as he got up and matched towards his bedroom. Hermione and Ron were left alone in the room, the sound of Harry's footsteps echoing through the room.
Draco sighed dramatically, "Fine! Alright! I will admit, he is handsome." He said through gritted teeth, yanking out his ribbon from his hair and letting it flow loosely and freely down his torso.
"Oh fine, thank you Hermione. It's been a lovely day out I think, until I ran into your little mangy mutt duo." Draco huffed, crossing his arms. He glanced over at Potter who simply smiled wider. "You better keep them on a leash." He added and Hermione laughed and nodded.
"Oh yeah! Now that you mention it, it is a bit creepy how intensely he stares at you in class. Maybe he's some kind of pervert," Pansy shrugged, "Maybe he's got a fetish for pretty little blondes."
"I assure you old man, at my age my clothes are popular amongst the youth. The height of fashion back in London." Draco smirked, taunting the man in front of him. Draco was at least 7 years Harry's junior and the gap had made it all the more fun to tease.
"Lovely, sounds like an absolutely dreadful time," Harry sarcastically cheered. Draco giggled and Harry smirked down at him, "No worries. The night is young and there is plenty of mischief to get up to, princess."
"I believe you know exactly of whom I speak. A certain Mr. Potter? Debonair businessman and dashing gentlemen?"
"I have no problems believing it to be tedious work, Mr. Malfoy, but I believe as a male, you have a responsibility to work in the laborious fashion instead of at home," Mr. Potter's eyes traveled up and down Draco, finally his eyes falling upon his delicate frame and long hair. "But perhaps women's work is more suited to your tastes."
"If it's my body you want, then please let me know. I don't know what you want, Harry. I don't know and it's killing me." Tears began to spring from Draco's eyes once more. Harry felt like the air was knocked from his lungs. He watched as the boy in front of him crumbled, frantically wiping at his face to hide the tears that threatened to fall. Large, warm hands came up to Draco's cheeks, one hand sliding down to Draco's neck. The boy looked up at Harry, eyes glittering and wet.
The party was dull and the music made Draco's entire body buzz and vibrate. Pansy was talking his ear off about...something or other. The punch was warm and the entire room was beginning to get hot, bodies writhing against each other, dancing and singing and chatting. Draco longed to be a part of it. He wanted to join them desperately. But his mind was stuck, locked onto damn Harry Potter and his sad green eyes and his pursed lips and his sweating form and chest heaving and his look… the way he looked just ..defeated.
Draco frowned, avoiding eye contact with Harry as he came closer. "Of course!" He boasted, chest puffed out, "I-I knew that!" Harry watched as the blush on Draco's milky pale cheeks began to spread down his neck and up to his ears. Oh Malfoy, always trying to boast his own ego.
A maid came and provided an assortment of tea and cookies, cakes and pastries from France, all colorfully decorated and sugary sweet. Draco reached over to take one of the tea cups, not noticing that Mr. Potter had also been reaching for it. Their fingers brushed slightly and Mr. Potter retracted his hand as if he were burned. Draco blushed slightly, taking the cup as carefully as possible and bringing it to his lips. Mr. Potter watched with fiery intensity as Draco's plush pink lips curled.
"This shit is getting out of hand, mate." Ron groaned. They had just come back from a meeting with the head of the Ministry. Apparently, their Jack the Ripper had struck again; this time, attacking a boy just outside of the Leaky Cauldron last night. Harry tried to push out thoughts of Draco from his mind as he looked at the photos of the victim, pretty blonde hair and cold blue dead eyes. "What am I going to say to Hermione? She's worried that the streets aren't safe anymore." Ron rubbed his aching neck, groaning in pain as the elevator dinged on their floor. Harry rushed out first, startling Ron who jogged forwards to catch up. "I mean, what's up with this guy anyways? He has a thing for blondies? In my opinion it's a rather shitty fetish."
"Well~ how do I look~?" Draco teased, spinning around, his fur parka spanning out slightly as he twirled and the two pom-poms that dangled down in the front bobbed up and down. His smile was large, pretty blonde hair and pale skin clashing against the ice and chilly winter air. Rosy cheeks warmed up otherwise milky skin and beautiful grey eyes matched the greying sky. It was safe to say Draco looked as if he were a cherub and the rumor of him inheriting Veela blood was often thrown about the school. Draco wasn't sure if there were any Veelas in his family, but he wouldn't doubt it. He should ask his mother next time he visits, perhaps he could finally put these rumors to rest. ("No Veela blood in me, I'm just that beautiful~")
The tea was cold and Draco knew it was time to leave. He sauntered down to the little bakery in Knockturn, selling ruffage and old bread, but the owner was sweet on Draco, and Draco wouldn't pass on free sweets. "Hello Dimitri," Draco purred as he entered the door, the brass bell above him jingling in the air. Dimitri Polavich was an older and rough man, with dark black facial hair and a stout, strong build. He had rough hands from back when he was in the military, back in Slovakia, and Draco shivered every time they caressed his skin. It was a funny thought, that such an abrasive man, owned a little bakery now.
"Where, oh where, has my dear Hermione gone?" Draco asked, slightly fanning himself and willing his blush to go down.
"Please do try to look nice, Draco! There will be a multitude of eligible bachelors and I hope you catch the eye of more than one of them!" Narcissa yelled through the closed door, turning on her heel and leaving. When Draco heard the soft clattering of heels disappear, he tiredly threw himself onto his bed, whining into a pillow. It's not like he particularly wanted to go to the party. The only thing that would make it the least bit tolerable was the accompaniment of Hermione. Sure, Draco would not be opposed to the merriment of dancing and drinking libations, but he absolutely knows that his enjoyment will dissipate the minute his mother urges him to dance with random strangers.
"Found any thugs and miscreants, Uncle?" Draco mused, smug little smile on his lips that made Severus roll his eyes fondly.
"Harry! You're such an idiot. Why did you wait so long to tell me??" Draco whined as he buried his face into the brunette's neck. Harry simply nodded and pet the blonde's hair back.
"He'll find a husband in no time!" Narcissa smiled, fixing her hair in the mirror. Lucius simply tutted, "He has plenty of time for that, Narcissa. He's just a boy."
"I'm not sure," Draco lied, shoving his toast into his mouth to avoid any more questions. "I have many admirers, don't you know." He added with a huff, his nose turned in true pompous Malfoy manor.
"Well, since your hair has been growing longer, I thought it would be quite pretty all tied up," she smiled, sitting Draco down and gathering his long, silken hair up into a bunch. Draco had been growing out his hair since he was a child, having it a little bit past his shoulders. Narcissa began to hum as she ran her fingers through his blonde locks, tying the ribbon into a bow in Draco's hair. "There! Nice and pretty~" she beamed as she dragged Draco to a mirror. The ribbon was in fact pretty, bringing Draco's hair upwards and showing off his features. The ribbon was, in fact, quite delicate and made of expensive materials, far too grand for anything in Draco's daily wardrobe.
But if it wasn't these things that surprised Draco first, then the bed had definitely taken the cake. The bed was something straight out of a child's fairytale. White painted wood (covering the chips and dents) made way to a light blue and white duvet that was decorated with flowers and butterflies and other woodland creatures. The headboard was carved with swirling patterns and the entire ghastly thing was covered by a sheer sheet of dainty white mesh: a canopy bed.
"Pansy and Blaise are my friends, thank you very much. And I'm hardly a princess! My cousin may be a duchess but that doesn't make me a princess!" Draco stopped his boot like a petulant child, ignoring Harry's obvious smirk and lazy eye roll.
Please comment :) ❤️ I've been recently informed that Draco has grey eyes, not green so please forgive that little oopsie. If you see that in previous chapters, I'm sorry lol from now on I'll try to fix that
"He has to look absolutely fetching for tonight, Lucius, please do not ruin his hair! I assure that he'll catch the eye of many tonight, hopefully Mr. Weasley~" Narcissa hinted, wagging her eyebrow.
"Your luggage appeared here," Harry muttered, his hands tightly wound behind his back as Draco looked around the home. "I had it placed in your room." He added, watching with uneasy interest as the blonde dragged his fingers across the mantle of the fireplace, cringing at the dust that was collected on his fingers.
"And who's the one next to him?" Draco asked softly, noticing that the boy, the one to the now known Ronald Weasley, was still staring at him. It made Draco blush and not in the way he usually did when people stared. This blush made Draco hot in the cheeks and his entire body rejected the very idea of him. Draco had half the mind to stick out his tongue at the boy who was aggressively peering at him.
The cat, now deemed Elizabeth (Lizzie for short) simply meowed softly, rolling over to her side and letting out a rather large yawn. Draco only smiled in return.
"Draco, I'm...my little flower, I'm sorry." Harry leaned forwards and pulled Draco into his arms, letting him burrow into his chest and neck. Harry held Draco against him, letting little sobs wrack through his body and shake. "Sweet boy," Harry sighed, petting Draco's hair.
"You don't like it, do you?" Harry muttered sheepishly, "It's corny, I know but I thought it was pretty and I don't know it kinda matched your eyes and-"
"Well, at least you admitted it!" Harry teased back, absolutely enjoying the way Draco's scrunched up in unamusement. The blond recoiled slightly, attempting to keep himself calm. His parents did always say he had a little bit of a temper when it came to arguing, but Draco didn't want to argue right now. It didn't feel like all of those other times in the hallways or in class, it wasn't someone making a rude comment about Draco's lineage or his intelligence, not insinuating anything. Harry wasn't exactly insulting him. This confused Draco most of all.
"I'm simply saying, do you really not care for romance? You truly don't want a future husband?" Hermione asked as she and Draco walked down the road towards their homes. Draco mulled over the question for a second, biting his bottom lip.
"He's a guest. Let him in." Harry cut her off quickly, his words becoming more frustrated and annoyed.
"Wait, please, Draco come and stay with us for a bit," Hermione smiled shyly, trying to reach out to Draco. Her eyes caught the hair clip and gasped, "What a lovely clip! Where did you get it?"
"Of course I'm serious, Draco," Harry muttered, stroking the back of Draco's hands in his own. "Draco I…..I really am…." The words were stuck in his throat, "I really.."
"Kreacher doesn't take orders from non-Black blood," the elf rasped out, his beady eyes narrowing at the man. An issue Harry had found early when he first was moving in: while Harry was Sirius Black's godchild, he technically was not of Black blood. Kreacher, a house elf of tradition and solemn family loyalty, found no reason to heed the requests of Harry Potter: a man of no familial blood. While he does begrudgingly follow some of Harry's orders, he does so in a slow and unorganized manner. Harry sighed, wondering if Hermione would be smug if she saw him groveling to request something of his house elf.
Soup. It was vegetable soup. Harry turned back at Draco and cleared his throat, "Uh...I see you cooked?"
"Oh? And are you cooking all of this? Or shall we have a house elf do all the work so that we can save your precious manicure." Harry sneered, his eyes rolling at the thought of Draco doing any type of manual labor.
"I would rather die dirt poor than anything akin to your wife," Draco spat out, wriggling in Harry's grasp. "Your teasing will not get a rise from me, Mr. Potter. I assure you, I am not easily swayed."
Draco stopped in front of a large mahogany door. He turned towards Harry and finally, looking him in the eyes, spoke. "Goodnight, Mr. Potter" with a turn of his heel, Draco began twisting the doorknob.
"Well, I suppose I'll just have to tell my father about this, hm?" Draco pouted, huffing in an endearingly irritating way that simply made Severus chuckle under his breath.
The man approached closer, pinning Draco to the wall by pressing his chest against Draco's small frame. Draco's confidence was high and his inhibitions were low and perhaps if he wasn't drunk, he wouldn't allow the man to wrap an arm around Draco's slim waist.
Harry shrugged, "I didn't want to...complain? It's not that terrible," he murmured as he swirled his spoon through the broth.
"Where did you run off to, Draco?" Hermione asked as she found him almost running into them. "Last time I checked you weren't behind us!"
"You don't have to fake kindness, Potter. I'm not that precious." Draco leaned against the cabinets and Harry watched as he fiddled with the kitchen dish cloth. His shirt was slightly dirty, a pale yellow spot staining it's white fabric. Draco had tied up his now shoulder length hair, the loose strands around his ears flying every which way, no doubt from toiling over the bubbling soup. It was evident that he had worked hard on his project and the fact made Harry's stomach bubble warm and it wasn't just from the soup.
"Come on, just play along for a second. Don't be a fucking git." Harry whined, nudging against Draco's waist with his socked foot.
"Oh?" Fenrir went one step closer as Draco took one step back. "And where is this date?" He asked with a sneer.
As the trio came closer, Draco rolled his eyes, but tried his best to be cordial, something his father insisted he do no matter who it was he was addressing. "Weasley, Potter…" he nodded towards them, suddenly standing up straighter, legs together, fists curled in his sleeves.
"Yes, mother." Draco said dejectedly. He rested his cheek against his fist, looking down at his plate.
Draco wore the velvet green dress his mother had given him for his birthday. It hugged each and every curve on his body like a dream, making him seen impossibly slender and ethereal as his hair practically glowed in the moonlight. He looked darling in it, he was a pretty little thing with his hair done in a half bun and half down style. The hairpin that Harry had given him was stuck proudly in his hair and Draco relished in seeing his particularly catty relatives absolutely squirming with jealousy at the sight of it. It was near the time guests would arrive and already were the first few scattering through the manor, taking in the sight with wide and awe-filled eyes. Draco took up a glass of champagne as he waited for Harry to arrive at the party. He stood anxiously near the wall, watching everyone from the corner with his drink in hand.
"I think I'll take a walk," he muttered, only receiving half hearted 'hms' in response. Harry walked towards the boy, who's pretty grey eyes glanced upwards from his book to look back at him. "Would you care to accompany me, Mr. Malfoy?"
"Let go of me!" Draco fought against him, but when he realized resistance was futile, he calmed down and let Harry grip him with unsure but steadfast intentions. "Yeah, yeah I live...nearby," he muttered, nodding his head back further into the street.
"Hello snowpetal," he said back, words curling off his tongue in a thick Slavic accent. He was a man of his time, showing Draco the affection and care he would a young lady, and that included a multitude of nicknames and pet names. It amused Draco, and he wasn't opposed to being treated like a fragile porcelain doll once in a while, especially when his other clients opted to toss him around like a ragdoll. No, Dimitri was a kind man and a kind lover. Draco was more than grateful for it.
"Oh? And where will your husband be during all this?" Harry asked back, interested in playing along with this game of "future plans".
"I received a letter in the mail," Hermione glowed. It was the day after the party and Draco was still in a sour mood from his confrontation with a certain arrogant man and from the loss of his mother's ribbon.
Harry could believe that perhaps some were indoctrinated into the Dark Lord's army against their will. He wouldn't put it past Voldemort to do so, considering the monster was the reason Harry was orphaned at the tender age of one. And perhaps this is why Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy were deeply shameful of their Dark Marks. Something that they had never wanted in the first place.
A hand raised to cup Draco's cheek and it was as soft as snow, Harry noticed. Harry's thumb caressed the expanse of Draco's face, dragging down over his bottom lip, plump and pink. Draco's eyes were as wide as a startled doe, sweet and wonderfilled. Harry had frightened him, that much he knew. His feelings were scary, to say the least. Fingers trailing down to lift Draco's chin slightly, Harry sighed.
"I would never regret last night. Yes, yes, I might be a pig-headed man, but now that I have a certain kitten in my grasp, I fully intend on making him my bride." Harry's eyes were full of fondness as he stared down at the boy in his arms.
"Hm? Oh..yes that sounds great. Perhaps...Mione and I should go home for a bit, just so we can gather our belongings and change into picnic ready attire."
"It was from your neighbor, Mr. Weasley!" Hermione said as she passed the parchment to Draco. Draco glanced upon the sloppy cursive letter. "He's invited me to his home!"
"I pray that your first child be a girl then, if you cannot stand lewd behavior. All boys are little deviants waiting to grow into bigger deviants." Hermione tsked.
Stormy grey eyes snapped up and met warm hazel. Hermione stared Draco down, worry etched on her face. Draco looked down at the fabric clutched tightly in his fingers, so harshly that his knuckles turned pink and white. He let go of it suddenly, letting Hermione pluck it from his grip. Right, they were in town, picking fabrics. It must have slipped Draco's mind.
"Oh, I'm sorry. Didn't realize you were so invested in our pretend future home," Draco snorted, "Fine.. no party… maybe...maybe a family dinner instead?" Harry seemed to perk up at the idea, leaning closer to Draco, which made the boy blush slightly. "Yeah, a family dinner. A large roasted duck and maybe some potatoes and some carrots. Roast Beef and cakes for dessert."
Draco didn't notice when a hand slid up to grab his waist, startling him slightly and causing him to jump. The man whomst the hand belonged to began to laugh heartily, doubled over by the stomach. Draco could tell it was Mr. Weasley by his bright orange floppy mop of hair . Draco rolled his eyes. "You scared the living daylights out of me!"
Silence filled in the gaps of their conversations. Shifting eyes to one another only to look back at the fire in front of them.
Once Draco had gotten a good look at Harry, he couldn't help but feel his legs turn to jelly and his heart thump like a rabbit. Harry was wearing a tuxedo that was perfectly tailored to his body. The shirt he wore perfectly highlighted the toned and firm crevices of his chest as well as the elegant slope down to his waist. His slacks were practically painted onto him with how perfect they looked on strong and long legs. Harry's caramel tan skin glowed warm in the candlelight that was scattered around the manor and the moonlight bounced off ebony black curls. His lightning shaped scar stood out as if a proud medal and Draco could imagine he purposefully put it on display, as if to give a warning to all the former Death Eaters. Draco felt his own cheeks heat up at the sight and it definitely wasn't from the champagne he had been drinking. "I'm not some trollop that fools around with men," Draco muttered, his cheeks turning even more pink than the rouge he was wearing.
Harry could feel the dark and inky tendrils of annoyance climbing up his bones. He liked Draco. More than liked actually, was rather smitten with him. But that wasn't enough for Harry to forget that these people, Draco's 'family'  had been responsible for Harry's parents' deaths. They had wanted it, implored their master to kill the only family Harry had ever had himself. And yes, Harry hadn't known his parents really. He knows he feels no real connection to them, but they were HIS parents. They were HIS family. The longer he ruminated on the thought, the more bitterly he felt towards the man that had slithered up next to him. But Rodolphus took Harry's silence as interest, and thus continued.
"Draco, I know you snuck out from the dorms the other night… if you'd like to talk you can always come to my chambers-"
"I'll warn you now, Potter. Draco Malfoy is the closest thing I have akin to a son," Snape muttered candidly, his honest tone causing Harry to snap his neck towards the man and stare. "If I find that he has been….hurt in any way. I will not even put up a fight as I am removed from Hogwarts when they find your petrified body outside in the courtyard."
"Hello there~" Draco cooed as the owl dropped the letter into his hands. He set down the envelope on his night stand, smiling down at the bird. "What a beautiful girl you are," he smiled, stroking her feathers lightly. The owl cooed happily, yellow eyes closing slowly and extending her neck out so Draco can scratch her there. "Perhaps I should also get an owl, for long distance communication." Draco hummed. Lizzie meowed from the bed and Draco sighed. "No offense, Lizzie. But we both have to admit, you're a bit of a diva when it comes to things like snow and rain."
Sometimes, Draco wished he had died in that Astronomy Tower at Hogwarts. Perhaps then, he wouldn't be here, laying on a stained mattress, next to a man who he's forgotten the name of. Death sounded just as pleasant as dreaming endlessly, Draco mused, as he attempted to drown out the sound of heavy snoring next to him. Draco shifted onto his side, facing away from, what was his name for God's sake? David? Jonah? It doesn't matter really, they all meshed together at some point. Draco's eyes focused on the worn, leather wallet on the nightstand next to him. It would be easy to just take the wallet and pocket the money he was owed. Then, quickly and quietly gather his belongings off the floor and skulk off into the night. But he wouldn't, not after last time he was caught attempting to skip out with a customer's wallet (Draco still had a scar on the back of his head from how hard he was pushed down onto the floor, an audible crack that made his stomach jolt and bubble, little blue and purple circles beginning to cloud his vision as he felt his pants being tugged off.) And yet, laying here next to whatshisname was a little bit of a death itself, as Draco was forced to be reminded over and over and over of what he is and what he's done. The shifting of a body, the moistness of the mattress, the crinkle of a condom wrapper, thrown somewhere without regard. Draco sometimes wished he died in that Astronomy Tower. It would have meant more than what he is now.
"Nevertheless, those pigs can give you a comfortable life, Draco. One where money is not an issue! I just worry for you, my love."
Upon closer inspection, Draco could fully see the young gentlemen. Mr. Weasley was a tall and lanky redhead (borderline ginger). He seemed to exude a rather homely personality, kind and generous and yet slightly clumsy. He wanted to interact with the other guests, saying hello to each one who he passed and giving a few handshakes. Meanwhile, his companion was not the least bit as hospitable.
"Here. For your birthday," Snape said and handed it to Draco. "I assume you heard from your parents. I'm sorry they couldn't be here today. I would stay as well, but unfortunately I have work that I must attend to or Dumbledore will have a fit." He watched as Draco unwrapped it gently, not wanting to ruin the parchment paper it was covered in. The box held a small stone, cloudy grey with spiralling and swirling sparkles inside.  They looked like a storm was stuck inside the stone, dangerous and beautiful.
"Do you have somewhere to go, Malfoy?" He asked frantically, his words dripping from his mouth like jumbled puzzle pieces. He didn't know how they came out or how they fit together, but they did and Harry wasn't able to stop himself from saying it.
"Here we are, Master Draco!" Kreacher chattered in glee, throwing open the last door in the hallway, tucked into the corner of the floor. Draco walked into the room gingerly, ducking his snowy head inside. This room was not as awful as the others, but in fact, the rather stark difference in rooms had thrown Draco for a loop. While the other rooms reminded Draco something of the Slytherin Common Room, this one seemed to have been designed by someone else entirely. It was evident that someone had done repairs in this room before Draco had arrived since the disintegrating hardwood floor had been patched up enough that Draco didn't fear for his life with every step (it still creaked lightly but that seemed to be inevitable). A large white and pink carpet had been thrown down in the middle of the room and it reminded Draco of the rather large Persian rug in his grandmother's house-- antiquated and yet sickly sweet. His chest lay in the middle, a dark contrast to the cotton candy walls surrounding it. The walls were stripped of their peeling wallpaper and painted over with a light pink paint that reminded Draco of melted bubblegum. The heavy and moth-eaten window drapes were replaced with white doily lace curtains and accentuated a large bay window; all equipped with a cushioned windowsill that allowed for perching and looking outside. A white stone fireplace was built into the wall as well and Draco couldn't help but think it was quite garrish.
Harry was not a religious man and yet this temptation disguised in human flesh is on the verge of making him confess on his knees. It was a terrible temptation, a mere fantasy. Harry should know better and he turns in bed once more.
The cold of November hit the glass window, frosting up the outside. Draco's hot breath hit the glass and with every inhale, made the frost melt, only to freeze over again from the chill of the winter air. Before his eyes, Draco watched as letters began to take shape in the frost, reflected back at Draco. They seemed to appear on their own, a magical message in the ice.
"I didn't even think of that, Draco! I don't care if he's rich or bloody poor!" Hermione sipped her tea and set it back down with a clank of ceramic. "I didn't see you after Mr. Weasley arrived with his companion. Where did you go?"
"Don't cry, Draco. Please don't cry. You're so young to be so worried, my love," Hermione cooed, cradling the boys face in her palms. "You must tell him, Draco. You must tell him of your true feelings or you'll never know what could be."
"Don't flatter yourself, Mr. Potter. You're truly all the things I've called you, not to mention daft as well since you can't even find yourself a wife to put up with your attitude." Draco sneered, even though he relished in the way Harry's grip around his waist tightened and began to stroke softly.
In an attempt to hide his face, Draco buried himself into Harry's neck, hoping to restore some semblance of confidence. His skin erupted in goosebumps as he felt Harry's lips near his ear.
"And so what?! He's never going to like me that way, Hermione. He's never…." Draco's lips shivered as he tried to hold back the tears that threatened to drip. "I don't know," Draco whined, eyes watering and hands rushing up to wipe at them. "He confuses me! One minute I think he's so charming and suave and then the next minute he's the devil! How do I know he ever would want me for more than my body!" Tears flowed freely from Draco's eyes and rolled down soft cheeks. Hermione sighed and gathered tissue, patting down Draco's face softly.
Harry's mind began to wander, not wishing to focus on the idea of Mr. Nott any longer. He turned in his bed, the sheets drawing closer to his chest. Harry remembers speaking about marriage with Draco. How embarrassing he must have been. He remembers those soft eyes, icy and yet warm. They were wide, shocked and slightly glassy. Had Harry said something to offend him? Damn the alcohol, damn it all to hell. From now on, Harry drinks nothing but tea and coffee (and the occasional glass of wine). Harry definitely remembered speaking about marriage with the younger.
"Mr. Nott," said a voice that Draco could recognize from any crowd. The two of them peered over to the man dressed in all black, looming over them like death himself. Draco felt his heart race.
"Oh?" Harry's eyebrow raised. Attempting to hide his smile, he hung up jacket in the coat closet. "And what's that?"
"I'll be sure to do that. Come on now guys, before all the good candy is gone." She grabbed Ron by the sleeve and forcibly dragged him away and into the store, leaving Harry with the three other Slytherin. Harry's eyes didn't leave Draco's ever-growing pink blush on his cheeks. The blonde couldn't bare looking Harry in the eyes, knowing that those deep green eyes would be staring right back at him.
"Of course." Draco put the clip in his hair, the stones shining against the fine, silvery hair. "It's gorgeous. Thank you, Potter….Harry."
"Since you insist on dressing so scantily, it cannot be helped," Harry muttered gruffly, his cheeks growing ever so slightly redder.
"They can't hear you, it isn't like the photos or the newspapers here." Harry said as he sat up and walked over to Draco.
"What a foul mouth for one so young. If I had known any better, I would say I'm standing with a sailor." Harry smirked, causing Draco to shy away.
"I assure you, Mr. Malfoy and I have less to discuss than you imagine." Harry finally spoke, ignoring the confused and angry glare from Draco who simply stated at him. "I walked Draco to his bedroom, and then retired to my own."
"A shame, really. I was hoping to see the rest of the house," Draco drawled on, his fingers shifting and twirling down drapery and statues.
"Kreacher," he sing-songed. "Would you be so kind to show me to my room?" Pretty slate eyes were wide like a doe's and long blonde eyelashes blinked with innocence laced intention. Harry watched from behind the smaller man, amazed as Kreacher's straight deadpanned lips began to curl into a smile of too many sharp teeth.
"Good morning! I see you two have gotten comfortable with some breakfast!" In came Ron, a sweaty mess with his shirt untucked and buttons undone. Draco smiled fondly at the messy appearance until Harry appeared from behind him.
The entire mansion was covered in flowing satin drapery, crystals flowing from the ceiling, decadent foods being passed around. The outside chateau was littered with carriages, the buzzing of excited guests filing into the glittering estate. Footmen guided each guest into the main ballroom where lively and opulent pandemonium occurred. A string orchestra played jaunty music and guests were invited to dance along. Laughter and merriment filled the ears of Draco, who suddenly felt overwhelmed when he entered the party. Technicolored dresses and masks fluttered like leaves in the wind as they twirled around the ballroom. Draco had donned a white feather mask with golden trim, matching his otherwise angelic dress. He had felt embarrassed, he was the only one in a pure white dress and this had made him feel slightly childish. The other ladies, how elegant and regal they were in their beautifully vibrant dresses, dripping in jewelry that nuzzled into their ample bosoms. Compared to these women, Draco felt like a meager child, playing dress up in a room full of adults. In that moment, when he saw how these women were fawned over by the men of the court, Draco slightly resented his mother and her obsession with painting and dressing Draco as if he were a porcelain china doll.
It had always been within a gentleman's favor to find a bride that will be both suitable of class and wealth. This fact rang throughout England and was instilled in children from a young age. For those already married and have neither grand status or illustrious wealth, it was in their best interest to wish for their offspring's success in finding a marital partner.
Ah, of course. Harry must be missing his parents. Draco had always assumed that Harry would have gone with the Weasleys or gone with Hermione to their homes for the holidays, but perhaps he doesn't. Perhaps instead he just stows away here in the Commons, nursing a flask of what smelled like fire whiskey. It was a sad thought, really. The idea that Harry simply sat alone in front of the fireplace during Christmas, waiting for his friends to return. Draco always went home for the holidays, his family threw a huge Christmas gala each year and Draco always adored any chance to dress up and be admired. But Harry didn't have anything like that, he didn't even have parents to go home to. The sudden revelation made it easier to understand why Harry would have such a thing hidden away.
"I suppose so, but if patience is a virtue, perhaps I'm not as angelic as I seem." Draco's lips ghosted over the mystery man's only to be pulled away at the sound of a booming voice.
"Mm, perhaps instead of this clip, we should buy you a little vial of Amortentia. I bet it would smell exactly like Potter's cologne." Pansy teased, earning a snicker from Blaise and a little shove. Draco scoffed and crossed his arms over his chest.
"H-hey! Wait a minute!" Ron barked, fists curling, but Harry simply smiled and side stepped the two slytherins in front of him, leaning his head over to see Draco hiding behind the human shield. His smile seemed to double as he watched Draco's haughty nose turn up at the sight of him.
"Not at all, now that I've seen your posh little face, it's quite an exciting day, don't ya think?" Harry smiled, head tilting ever so slightly to the side. Draco tsked and rolled his eyes. The way Harry was staring at him, staring THROUGH him, made Draco feel nervous.
Harry tsked, shaking his head. "Already hated by the father-in-law, aren't I?" He teased, peering up at Draco to see him hide his face in embarrassment. Draco remained quiet afterwards, no quip back, no smarmy smile. Harry's eyebrows furrowed, smile turning to a sharp straight line as he watched Draco avoid his gaze. "Draco?" He muttered, his legs coming together and sitting up and leaning in. "Dr-"
Draco's head snapped up, cheeks turning pink. He averted his gaze, attempting to hide his face from his mother and father. Lucius' eyebrow raised in intrigue.
"Well, you'd be a shitty wife, I'll tell you that," Harry mocked, glancing over and then back at the fire. "Too prim and proper to be one, a bit too tightly wound if you ask me." He looked back at the blond next to him, a smile growing on his face as Draco's lips also curled into a little smile
In the back of Draco's broken-down little closet, he pulled out a heaving wooden trunk by it's metal brass knobs. He hit the floor with an 'oof' when the trunk finally was breached from its hold and Draco rubbed his ass, wincing as he did so. The trunk was made of shellacked maple wood, decorated with swirling clouds and delicate flowers. It housed the only momentos he was able to bring with him from his old life: photographs, postcards, clothing, and trinkets. He hadn't looked inside the trunk since he had first placed it in the back of his wardrobe, but he would be damned if he would leave it behind. He stood up from the floor, sighing as he did so. Draco gently waved one hand above the illustrious trunk and in a flash of soft light and golden sparks, it disappeared from its spot. This was the extent of Draco's powers now, simple parlour tricks. He was able to apparate things away, something that a child could do in their first year of schooling. The Ministry had deemed Draco a non-threat to society and therefore allowed him to keep the simplest of incantations.
"Ye-yes. Quite lovely, indeed." Harry's voice was gruff, as if he were holding his breath, as if he hadn't taken a single breath until this moment. Harry's voice was deep, as deep as the ocean and the thick forest just outside of Derbyshire. Draco suddenly realized he could get lost just by listening to Harry's voice. The thought made him anxious, suddenly aware that the hairs on the back of his neck were standing up and goosebumps erupted on his porcelain skin. Harry opened his mouth slightly to speak once more, but Draco had already fluttered off. He had needed to remove himself from Harry's side, lest he turn dark red and stammer over his words.
The question had Draco stop dead in his tracks. His hand, outstretched to push open the entrance, began to slowly retract and curl at his side. When he turned back to Harry, he saw how Harry wasn't facing him but gazing into the fire, deep in thought. Draco wondered if he did this often.
"Oh...uncle it's lovely." Draco sighed, holding the stone up to the light and admiring the reflections it caused.
Harry nearly tore open the carton, taking one between his fingers and bringing it up to his lips in a satisfied sigh. Smoking had been a new development and in recent years, Harry had developed quite a chain smoking habit. Hermione says it's a coping mechanism, Harry insisted it really wasn't. He had told her before, she doesn't need to check up on him like he was a child. It wasn't as if Harry had been a stranger to the woes of life and god knows he's been able to take care of himself for years. That doesn't stop her from coming over to clean his home once in a while. She had thought about hiring him a cleaner, but Harry had always thought it less than enjoyable to have a stranger in his home. Besides, Harry loved to mention, he had Kreacher, the house elf that presided in Grimmauld Place for decades (even if it was difficult to get anything but an annoyed grunt from the elf.)
Draco swiftly turned himself around, seeing none other than Weasley and Potter and a new homely little girl with frizzy hair. She looked studious, with her books in her hands and a quill tucked behind her ear. She was quite pretty and Draco could imagine him becoming friends with her more than the other two. Unsurprisingly, Ronald and Harry had ended up being placed in Gryffindor as well as the other girl (who he would later learn is Hermione Granger, greatest witch of her time), but Draco felt that she would be better suited in Ravenclaw.
Days in Nice, France were idyllic and quaint and Draco found that he rather enjoyed the countryside life. It was only a few days until Christmas, only a few days until their grand celebration, and Draco found himself wondering about a certain brunette. What was Harry doing by now, Draco wondered. Draco stayed up in his bedroom, reaching out for his wand and charming a piece of parchment on his desk. He had planned to write a letter to Harry. He would like to hand deliver it himself, but Floor Powder was notorious for its rather shoddy results when traveling long distances. Once the paper was properly charmed, Draco began to speak into the tip of his wand. His words were then prettily transcribed onto the parchment.
Draco turned his head slightly to the Gryffindor table. It was loud and rowdy and improper and yet Draco couldn't help but feel drawn to it slightly. The Trio was seated promptly there, Hermione's nose in a book and Ron and Harry messing around. Draco couldn't help but feel a little jealous of the skinship between everyone in Gryffindor. They all seemed so chummy and comfortable with each other and Draco has never really known friendship like that.
"Seems like a nice life we'd have together." He muttered, sitting up and stretching his arms. He stood up from his spot and walked towards the coat closet.
"A-actually, I have a date for tonight. Also, my friends from school will arrive shortly," Draco said as he backed up from the man. His polite smile struggled to stay on his lips as he lied through his teeth.
Upon hearing about the Masquerade ball being held in Mr. Weasley's estate, Narcissa began her energized frenzy to prepare outfits for herself as well as Draco and Lucius. Naturally, she had one request for her only child.
"If you wish to Christen your home with guests, perhaps I suggest a soiree of sorts?" Hermione smiled, taking Draco's hand in hers. "Draco here is a wonderful tailor! He can sew anything really! He could make his and my outfits!" Much to Draco's dismay, Ron's face glowed at the idea.
Narcissa gasped in glee and kissed Draco's cheek, staining his creamy skin with a faint pink tint. "Lovely! Come along," she smiled as she dragged Draco to her room, rummaging through her closet while Draco undoes the curlers in his hair and takes out the pins. His snowy locks fell down in waves like the ocean on the shore, loose and beautiful. He watched as his mother search, finally finding the dress she was looking for. "Here we are!" She said as she pulled out a white gown, straight in shape and form-hugging at the top. With lace embroidery woven into the fabric, the dress looked absolutely angelic. "I wore this dress when I first met your father, I was around your age you know. I assure you that it will bring you good luck tonight," she said as she helped Draco into it, tying off the bow in the back. Draco looked at himself in the mirror once it was dawned on him. He looked like something out of a fairytale, a fair maiden. Virginal, pure, untouched and perfect. Draco was absolutely embarrassed by it. He couldn't help but feel like he was dressed as a blushing bride. Perhaps this was his mother's intentions all along, dressing him for the part. Before Draco could protest, Narcissa swooned, cooing over him and smoothing out the dress.
I'm so sorry this update is really late, school started up again and I didn't have the chance to write. Please enjoy!! Comment if you liked the new update. ❤️
"The only two available rooms are the ones on the third floor. The ones that are across from each other." Ronald smiles and sighs, "I'm in awe of how brilliant you are, my love."
"That unsightly little miscreant is Ronald Weasley," Lucius tutted. "His father and I worked together at the Ministry of Magic. The entire family is a mismatched group." Lucius gripped the books from the counter and turned around in order to leave with his son.
They stood entwined for many moments, their heartbeats finally steadying. After a few moments, Draco finally began to loosen his grip. "Come on," he sniffled, wiping a rogue tear from his cheek. "My parents will have a fit if they realize we've been up here so long."
But then again, he's felt the swells of tears in his eyes while studying French art in the academies, gazing upon depictions of the Immaculate Conception, of the Pieta, of the Crucifixion. He's felt his chest constricting when he gazed upon the face of Mother Mary, her peaceful serenity balanced against sorrowful agony as she cradles her dead son in her arms. Harry doesn't suppose this makes him religious, he supposes it makes him human. And why shouldn't Harry have an affinity for the finer things in life, the beautiful and the divine? He's surely worked for them and he's used to getting the things he wants. Harry knows this is against the Catholic ideals of 'giving' and 'charity' but it's perhaps because he doesn't believe in God that he could justify his rather cold demeanor.
"Yes Draco, let's go now, we shall get you the cat. Now let's hurry along, we have other things to get." Lucius was already one foot ahead, aiming for the cashier.
Harry blinked, standing in the Floo portal of his home. Draco was laying on the couch, sprawled across like a particularly pampered cat, head in his palm. Harry walked inside the living room, beginning to undo his scarf and jacket. "Have you been watching TV all day?"
"Invisibility cloak", Harry answered back. With one foul swoop, he pulled it off the two of them, revealing the clear night sky. The stars were brightly shining around them and the chilly air hit Draco's fragile body like a ton of bricks. He wrapped his arms around himself as he watched Harry wrap up the "invisibility cloak" and tuck it under his arm. "I got it from my father...or well...I inherited it."
"God you're such a fucking tease," Thomas bit back, shoving his hands in his pockets and walking back inside the school. "Fucking bitch," he muttered as well, leaving Draco once again alone. Tears finally began to spout from his eyes and Draco couldn't help but cross his arms around himself to keep from full on sobbing. He was given little reprieve when he heard the sound of clanking footsteps coming near.
Flourish and Blotts booksellers was the only place to find Hogwarts' extensive reading list. Therefore, Lucius made sure to call them the minute they opened to reserve fresh copies. The pair strode into the shop and all eyes fell onto them. The attention on him made Draco's cheeks curl pinker than the blush his mother brushed onto him. Draco reveled in it slightly; he knew he was probably the prettiest thing most people have seen, thanks to his mother and father. Draco wasn't unfamiliar with the compliments people would give him, the pinching of his cheeks or the cooing and petting. He also noticed the look men would give him. Draco liked those the most. He didn't exactly know why, nor what it meant, but he had always noticed that he gained the attention of men and he knew that it made his stomach flutter and he wanted more of it. (As Draco grows older, he'll come to be repulsed by those gazes, making his skin crawl and stomach churn.)
"You've barely touched your food!" Narcissa whined as she watched her child pat down his mouth with his napkin.
Breakfast was already underway when Draco had finally strolled down the stairs. Hermione was at the dining table, butter knife in hand as she spread jam onto honey rolls. Her eyes lit up at the site of Draco, setting down her things and beckoning him closer. "Good morning, darling. I trust you slept well?" She smirked, making room for Draco at the table and passing him a cup of tea.
Draco smiled gleefully as he reached out to rub the chin of the cat staring back at him. Apprehensive, she pulled back from his touch, careful eyes staring back at him. Draco began to pull his hand back, not wishing to upset her. "I suppose you're a fickle little thing, hm?" Draco asked softly as she licked her paw, only stopping to "mrr" cautiously as Draco attempted his luck again, this time, stopping to let her sniff his hand.
Draco glanced upwards to find a man towering over him. He must have been at least his father's age, fat and sweating, beady eyes and a pig nose. He made Draco's entire body crawl and his wine tasted bitter. "U-um, No...no thank you," Draco attempted to give a small smile in decline. The man's face twisted into anger, "I don't see you with anyone else, what could possibly be the reason for your decline?" He spat out those words like venom from his tongue and it burned Draco's skin. "Sir, I don't want to dance with you, please leave," he scowled back, suddenly finding himself pressed against the wall, nowhere to go and being surrounded. Draco swallowed, but felt as if a rock was in his throat as a hand ran down his waist. Draco turned his head away from the labored and hot breath of the pig on top of him, bracing himself for whatever disgusting thing would occur.
"Welcome home darling," she smiled, taking the basket from the table and handing it off to one of the servants. "Look at what I found up in the attic!" She pulled from behind her a white Chantilly lace ribbon. Draco's eyebrows raised as he cocked his hips.
"And Harry would never admit that he craves affection and attention. His rough exterior drives away any potential suitor that dares to attempt to woo him." Ron sat back down on the couch across from Hermione, picking up a small finger sandwich.
"Draco you look precious! Where are you going??" Narcissa had just arrived from the shopping and was soon enough coming to greet her son.
. Draco remembers the trial like it was yesterday; he saw it in his nightmares and what he remembers the most were the eyes of the Ministry Members that stared at him, through him. Draco after the war had fled with his mother to their Southern French home, hoping to hide there from the authorities. Draco remembered with fondness what it was like for those first two months. Without his father at home, Narcissa had deemed it quite laissez faire in the Malfoy home and rules were thrown out the window. While Lucius had understood Draco's proclivities towards men, he had been quite adamant that Draco dressed and acted like a pureblood gentleman, keeping in the grand tradition of pureblood gentlemen of their family. They couldn't risk upsetting the Dark Lord, afterall. But upon escape, Narcissa had taken Draco out before they holed up at home. She took him from store to store, choosing the most expensive and beautiful outfits she could find and for those two months, Draco lived like a child once more. He laughed, and danced, and drew, and read, and sewed, and had tea parties with his mother in the garden. He wore glorious dresses and jumpers and skirts and heels and whatever else he could imagine and he ate with wild abandon, cakes and pastries and sweets.
Draco rolled his eyes at the term of endearment. "I suppose we should keep our intentions a secret for now?"
"How did you convince him to let me stay?" Harry asked, picking up and observing the knick knacks and toys that littered Draco's room.
"Hey! Don't ignore me!" Ron fumed, angrily trying to pull Harry away, but Harry was firmly rooted in place. "Come on Harry, you don't wanna deal with this brat. My dad tells me he's a real pain in the neck."
"Not all of us can afford delicious wines and french champagnes, princess." Harry rolled his eyes. "Perhaps that's your preferred Christmas beverage of choice?"
Nothing warms Harry's heart like the sight of a certain angel. Harry's not religious in the slightest, detesting the idea of it really, and yet he cannot help but believe that an ethereal being walks among them. Mr. Malfoy… Draco. He's nothing like Harry's ever seen before. Usually calm and stoic, Harry couldn't help but be embarrassed at his slight outburst at the night of the Masquerade. He doesn't know what came over him, but it must have been the Devil taunting him (once again, Harry Potter doesn't believe in the Devil). Draco Malfoy, cunning and sly fox, sweet and gentle doe, antagonizer of Harry's heart. And here Harry lies, in bed and staring up at his ceiling, reliving his aggressive confession over and over again in his head. It had been two nights since the party and Harry hadn't seen anything of Mr. Malfoy.
