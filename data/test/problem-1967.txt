Meanwhile, Draco’s letter doesn’t arrive by owl. Instead, his mother’s personal house-elf appears in front of him with a strict expression on her face, interrupting his dinner.
“Ha-ha,” Harry says drily. But nonetheless, he winks at Draco before going up to the other Slytherins and reminding them of
. High precision means that the model would only select answers that it was absolutely sure of, but will miss some results, e.g. for a given author, it would only guess fics it was certain to belong to that author. Meanwhile, with high recall, the model would select as much as possible that could be the answer--including fics by other authors, in our example.
“But I was wondering,” Potter says, tone turning serious again. “Was it a Gryffindor?”
Draco’s eyes sweep over all the expectant little faces. “...It is indeed ‘later’ in comparison to last night. I presume everyone has done their assignments and is thus free, then?”

Harry’s mouth flooded with saliva. Draco’s cock sprung up, thick and hard and Harry could already imagine how much it would stretch him, how deep it would reach…
Harry frowns. Honestly, he can’t remember, since he rarely looks at the map at night, and by the time Harry’s awake the next morning, Malfoy and the others would already be up and about.
As Draco wound the emerald scarf around Harry’s neck, he said, “I can cast a

Ron shakes his head. “Not good, mate.”
Draco doesn’t spend long entertaining them. He transforms back into his human shape and dresses. “Now, today I have come to invite you to a play date with the students,” he says to the thestral leader while patting the young thestrals sniffing at him.
“You have an entrance foyer?” Ron makes a face. “When did Slytherin get so posh?”

Draco’s head whips around, immediately seeing Harry leading a group of Slytherins out onto the balcony, some of them haphazardly dressed, others still in their sleepwear.

Pansy snorts. “You wanted to fight? With that kind of magical exhaustion all three of us have?”

Harry’s eyes crinkle and this time lands a more successful kiss on the corner of Draco’s mouth. “Don’t you think the best plug is your cock?”

In fact, Draco had not expected how much worrying about the Slytherins during class before had impacted him, how he keeps reflexively checking the bonds in his chest. He doesn’t have to do that as much anymore.
“How so?”

“Transform,” Robards commands, looking at Malfoy.
“The ex-Death Eater Fenrir Greyback is still at large,” Draco says gravely. “It is very possible that he will come here. Do not let him. Kill him at will, or send another creature to kill him.”
There is still a line of resignation and conflicted loyalties on Harry’s face. But...
Harry’s brow wrinkles in concentration. He envisions his magic as wisps of silvery light, like the wisps of a Patronus. A light breeze whirls around him as he gathers the magic, making him feel a little twitchy and needing to jump up and
Draco smiles drily. “What are you thanking me for?”
“That’s right, be flattered,” Harry said, tilting his chin up. “I save some memory space to remember you, instead of filling it with more Quidditch facts.”

Draco’s magic washed over them in a rather good cleaning charm. “Well, I must say,” Draco drawled, voice curling into Harry’s ears. “Not bad, though I’ll have to compare it with your arse performance later.”
Blaise nods. “Yes,” he says slowly. “We will tell McGonagall to reinforce the rest of Hogwarts.”

A small thin Auror steps forward and personally pulls off the black masks on the Aegis members, while another Auror snaps pictures.
Richard Garren smiles politely as he invites Aurors Michael Hitchly and Ellias Bartholomew into his office.
“Oh? We’re going to meet Harry too,” Neville says.
Harry’s lips quirk up. “I should have known how comfortable your bed would be.”
“Wha—” Harry’s mouth dropped. “No, no way,” he blustered and flustered. Draco wanted to squish Harry’s cheeks for how adorable he was being.
Ron points at Harry. Harry frowns back at him.
The languor of the weekend and the collapsed Hogwarts gets shaken off as the second year students try their best to learn the spells that Professor Flitwick has just taught them.
Years. Do
Harry pressed his lips together and nodded.
“Then why does Hermione—”
Jones opens his mouth to retort, but just at that moment, Professor Flitwick comes by.
And Draco’s hands are firm, solid, and when Harry looks at him, he sees that fond look of love reflected.
Hermione nods. “Yes, it’s probably better for you not to join them, you can make a greater impact influencing policy directly…”
“Morning, Draco,” Harry says.
Pansy laughs.

Only Pansy and Felicity remain in the Slytherin Commons, citing that they have things to do.

It’s Slytherin’s Creature. The Basilisk.
Because of that, the start of the Quidditch match is quiet… until the young Hufflepuff named Kim in the Slytherin stands starts to cheer for Ravenclaw. Kim’s friend, Maira, feels the need to cheer for Slytherin—the House of her big brother—quietly. The other young Slytherins have good affection for these two, and they start cheering for Slytherin and Ravenclaw in an alternating fashion.
It uncomfortably reminds Draco of his own reaction to the word “muggle” and any vague mention of muggleborns. Cheaters who have to be either assimilated, or excluded from their world.

Harry grins at the pictures. “What about a line of dragon soft toys? I want a pet dragon now too…”
Nolan’s father scowls.
Hermione glances sidelong at Harry, who is whole and well and chatting with Neville about the underwater plants he can see from Slytherin’s Common Room.
Draco raised one eyebrow. “Assuming you wake up in time. Honestly, I’d think you were still a teenager sometimes.”
Seeing the group head off, Draco walks to the castle. Inside, he lets his fingers brush against the wall. Hogwarts’ magic tingles under his fingertips, the magic swelling and rolling and following him up.
Draco asks Hogwarts. He feels an affirmative pulse. He slowly withdraws his magic, encasing it around just Slytherin instead, following Blaise’s lead.

McGonagall also moves in front of Draco. “Aurors, please, have patience. Clarity will be found in a moment.”
Harry’s face fell. “Yeah, I thought so…”
...It’s all his father’s fault! Causing Nolan to turn into a werewolf like this! Does his father know how painful the transformation is? Does his father know how disgusting Wolfsbane is?
Harry stops turning his head to look over and instead buries his face back in his pillow. “Then hurry up, Your Highness.”
Somewhere else…Garren has an inexplicable cold feeling.
Draco folds his arms across his chest, and the Hufflepuffs falter in their attacks. It’s clearly not working. Draco’s still standing.
Nolan pouts. “I wanted to say that to you, Mr Malfoy!”
Draco reddens slightly. “Not in public, Potter!”
"Okay."
“The Gryffindors? Or the Slytherins? They’re both fine. I think.”
Harry doesn’t pretend to be polite. He steps in first, eyes open as wide as possible.
Pansy obliviates them all. The rest of them gather the collected criminals, tie them up, and send them all whisking away via portkey.
“If you can catch me,” Draco says. “Harry.”
Neville greets Hannah first, and after their inquistory looks, Hannah says, “Yes, Harry talked to me too. And this is Maira….she has an older brother who’s in Slytherin. I think, for now, it would be best if she moved out of the House…”

Draco looks away, his heart skipping a beat at Harry’s smile. “Make yourself some hot pumpkin juice,” he orders weakly.
McGonagall continues, “An unknown dragon appeared and attacked them. It was able to use magic and even apparated through the wards. It is likely that it was a dragon animagus. Not long after, you arrived. Yes,” McGonagall adds when she sees Robards stunned look, “There are no reliable records of a past dragon animagus. But then we either have a dragon animagus or a dragon who can cast magic like a wizard.”
The next morning, Mary Green tries to visit the Forbidden Forest, her face pale with lack of sleep. Unfortunately, she bumps into Madam Pomfrey near the edge of the Forest.
: ...wait??? Did I just get a head pat??? What??? Why was that so quick??? Malfoy!!! Where is he?
“...Or I suppose you will become a Wizengamot member like your father,” Garren spouts, despite being perfectly aware that will be impossible for at least the next decade. He proceeds to name a number of Wizengamot members who could mentor Draco.
“Did you finish your Transfiguration assignment?” Malfoy asks.

The next morning, Draco wakes up first as usual. He looks down at how Harry is pressed up against him, absently brushing Harry’s curls. Usually he would get up, but right now, he wants to stay in bed with Harry.

And then it penetrated enough to brush against Harry’s prostate. Pleasure blossomed from deep inside Harry.
But it also means that unknown people are currently at the Manor.
Flitwick inclines his head. “Prior to the fall of Hogwarts, the students have been able to record the original layout of the various Hogwarts rooms.” He levitates a file containing a copy of the blueprints to Griffiths. “I believe this will be a great aid to the rebuilding.”
“Oh, and
Harry’s heart starts to thud in his chest. There’s exactly a week before Valentine’s. Maybe...maybe...He turns to Draco.
“Ugh, slow down, Malfoy!” Harry shakes off Malfoy’s grip, shakes off the haze in his mind as his brain finishes cataloging current-Malfoy.
Use re-sampling to make the total amount of words per author more balanced.
At the moment, one of Ron’s owls was nesting near one of the heating elements. Negesydd was a brown barn owl with spots of white. She was growing older and liked the more quiet environment of Harry’s house—at least when there weren’t kids around.
“It’s not like there’s

“Put on your cloak,” Draco says, handing Harry his glasses.
Harry settled down with a light sigh.
“You kids get away from here!” one wizard shouts at them. “This is a dangerous site! Don’t blame us if you get hurt!”
Draco tugs Harry’s hair slightly. “Git, then I’ll make you go to bed earlier.”
Draco smiled faintly and pressed a kiss on Harry’s nose. “You’re doing very well. Tell me how it feels.”
“Very well,” Evander Urquhart spells up a miniature Quidditch playing field and with the ‘help’ from his team members, goes through the match.

Harry wrinkled his nose. “What are you looking at?”
“Oh,” Draco breathed. His heart was too large, chest too tight, as he rolled over and wrapped his arms around Harry. He held his arms loosely. Harry was so close, in the quiet calm of the night.
Harry childishly poked Draco in the thigh. “I’m not scared!” he said, while not looking Draco in the eye. “I have some spare quilts so that we can each have a set.”

Unspeakable Nightshade’s face is dark, both in expression and due to the hood over his head despite the late evening. “I have determined that the Slytherins have been interfering with the building process.”
Outside the castle, Draco produces a broom. The two of them climb on, Harry hugging Draco from behind. They fly low and fast across the grounds and into the Forbidden Forest.
“Mr Malfoy!” Nolan cries.
Filch does so, and when Mrs Norris realises that Filch has become warm too, she no longer strains to stick to Draco anymore.

Draco huffs, shifting up into a sitting position leaning against the sofa. “
After Harry finishes the bake, he entrusts the cake to the house-elves for safekeeping and rushes back to his room to shower and clean away the scent of baking which Harry suspects Draco would be able to smell.
Draco’s heart felt like a little Harry-shaped-paw was gently scratching at it. He stood up and pulled Harry up against him and hugged him. Not too tightly, because he was afraid.

And if they can get into the Lestrange House—riddled with curses and traps thanks to the late Bellatrix—then Malfoy Manor is hardly safer.
Harry squeezes Draco’s hand in retaliation.
Harry ignores Malfoy’s tone. “Thanks for the—” Harry lifts the chess set. “Have a good day, Malfoy.”
Malfoy smirks. “Violent, I approve.” He takes a seat on the tall stool to Harry’s side instead. “Now carry on.”
In the weeks after the spring break, the final little touches are added to Hogwarts. On May 2nd, a small memorial remembering the first anniversary of the Battle of Hogwarts is held, including the reveal of a small, new monument to commemorate all those who had died defending Hogwarts.
Mr. Malfoy’s hand is warm, and firmly pats his head, ruffling his fur and stroking down to his shoulders.
“Let the Aurors figure out why.”
Draco’s heart feels inexplicably sour.
Ben Taylor suddenly spies someone else—“Creevey, where are
“Hm.” Draco rewarded him with kisses on his cheeks and nose and temple, and the base of his ear. “Let’s try just my fingers first, okay?”
Harry’s lips seemed to feel every single movement. A coarse wet tongue touched Harry’s bottom lip. Harry’s mouth parted automatically, and to his shock, Draco’s tongue slipped inside. Harry reflexively reached out to grab Draco by the shoulders.

With the finest care, Draco shampooed and conditioned Harry’s curls. Little moans slipped from Harry’s mouth as Draco massaged. He tugged a little harder just to hear Harry’s gasp.
“Hmm...If I said I dislike the sun in the morning when I want to continue sleeping, would you do something about it?”

“Be careful,” McGonagall finally says.
the Slytherins gain skills to protect themselves. As they finish, Blaise returns.
When Malfoy shows up again, Harry tells him he wants to turn the room in his own bedroom, and Malfoy says he’d learnt a spell that captures three-dimensional images. There are wobbly smiles on both sides, and their friendship is mended just like that. Harry is finally enticed over the grounds of Malfoy Manor where he and Malfoy pick up their seeker matches again, and the summer flies by.
His heart is racing. His chest is tight. He wants to smile incessantly and creepily at Malfoy…
Draco looks over the other students. He has learnt their names along the walk. How curious that all the werewolf students have chosen to stay behind at Hogwarts over the Winter Break.

Instead of protesting against Draco like he expects, Potter looks a little bewildered, endearingly so….how peculiar. With a touch of indulgent exasperation, Draco presses a hand on Potter’s back, pushing him to head back towards the castle.

“Are you going to work with them again…” one of the Gryffindor boys asks. “Didn’t Ben say—”
I get married into?” Potter says. “Do you also arrange marriages for the Slytherins too?”
While there will always be people who don’t listen and who prefer complaining without taking meaningful action, at least some people donate to the charities while others start new initiatives such as increased aid to help new muggleborn students and their families learn about magical society, and scholarships to support muggleborn and half-blood students break into careers that are otherwise populated only by purebloods. New “muggle-experience” tours pop up, as do “magical-culture-immersion” classes.
On Saturday afternoon, McGonagall calls a halt to the rebuilding and tells everyone to have a good rest.
Imagine: Draco's wings covering up all the kids....safe and sound and warm...

He had done it. He had had sex with his own adoptive younger brother, bareback. Charlie never thought he would do such a thing...but he had liked it, a lot.
Then, Hermione says, “Harry...tell us the
Harry reaches out and grabs Draco’s robes, his green eyes picking up all the low pre-dawn light. “Luckily McGonagall was there…”

,” she grudgingly admits. “It is impossible to separate your raw magic into dark and light...”
“You did good, you deserve a rest,” Charlie murmured, stroking Harry’s hair.
Draco’s smile deepens. “Good boy.” He shifts, raising a hand to caress Harry’s face. “You did very well today, for the most part… Should I give you a reward or a punishment?”

“We will be both fine,” Draco says.
Just as quickly as he transformed into a dragon, Draco is back in human form. Harry looks down (on accident!) and quickly looks up and away again as he gives Draco’s clothes back to him.
“Because I broke the rules,” Harry says with a grin. “Peak Gryffindor.”
? Should I give you half of my Gringotts vault?”
In the close proximity, Draco’s starting to tease out the elements of Potter’s scent. There’s a muskiness, And also a sweetness and baked goods, and grass, and books. And the reek of smelly Gryffindor boys.
“Promise?” Jamie asks.
” The slice of pain across the side of Draco’s face hits a moment later. Heart beating widely, Draco surveys the Slytherin Common Room, but it doesn’t seem like anyone here is injured.
Harry’s throat bobs. “They’ll say

Malfoy chuckles evilly, the
“About that…” Harry looks at Hermione carefully. “I’m dating Draco now.”
,” Draco rolls his eyes, but holds still as Pansy checks, poking his bare skin with her wand. “Blaise, summon me some robes for tomorrow morning, and my sleepwear for tonight.”
“Draco, please, please…”
Harry licks his lips, mouth parting. A mouth perfect for being Gryffindorish, and casting spells, and sucking cock.
Anderson narrows his eyes. He snorts. “That’s right, this is all a farce orchestrated by the Headmistress. If Slytherin can’t be in Hogwarts, no one can be in Hogwarts?
“No, Harry, I have to prioritise,” Shacklebolt says. “I know it is frustrating, but we all need to bear with it.”
Jamie’s eyes light up. “Merry Christmas, sir!” He scrambles to his feet, dragging Michelle up too. “You go wake the girls!” And then he races up the stairs to the dormitories.
This cannot be refuted.
Malfoy leans in closer, his arm brushing against Harry’s chest. A delicate finger traces the edge of the case.
When they attempt to put place in the second floor on Friday, the entire construction collapses.
Harry blushed. He tilted his head up to look at Draco. “Then I’ll give you a lot of hugs in the future?...Wait, you haven’t even said why you liked me!”
: Yep. And sleeping together is warmer in the winter.
“Yes sir!”
Narcissa takes one sip of her tea first. Then, she lets the teacup rest in her hands as she speaks, “Now, darling, how have you been? Your letters have been quite short of late. Some of your most recent missives were...quite confusing.”
Smart, but useless.

Harry grimaces. “Occlumency? I’m crap at that…”
Draco gives him an unamused look. “Do you want it or not?”
Harry makes a face as he finds a good place to snuggle against Draco’s warmth. “So...the moral is that I should call you ‘mum’ more often.”
The deadly hot flames change into pure red magic that stuns the Aegis members. The magic fades away a moment later as a tail sweeps across the surface of the water and flings frozen witches and wizards towards the shore.
Harry frowns. He shuffles closer to Draco. “No, I won’t. But what if I could turn into a phoenix? I
Not much information has been uncovered. They don’t even admit to attempting to destroy Hogwarts.
The privacy charm around them suddenly drops. Pansy smoothly re-arranges her face and steps back towards Felicity.
Over a thousand years, the separation of the magic of the four Founders has been blurred, twisting together to create new colours. Over a thousand years, the magic is Hogwarts is no longer solely of the four Founders. Instead, it is intertwined with all magic and sentiments of its thousands of inhabitants.
“Yes, mother,” Harry says jokingly.
Draco scowls back. “What, do you don’t want my updates?”
It will not take long before the last top floors are put in and the pointed roofs are tiled. That may have been his last time in McGonagall’s temporary office before she can move back into the castle.

As a dragon animagus, Draco’s marriage prospects would go up. This ability to transform shows his magical power. Not only can he transform into a creature larger than himself, but that creature is also magical.

Narcissa immediately puts a stopper on it and tucks it away.

Draco felt so powerful as Harry’s hole pulled him in deeper. “Love you, love you, love you…Fucking you feels so good.”
Then, for a brief moment, the magic trace of a dragon appears in the magic weave, before dissipating in a glimmer. Hogwarts’ magic rumbles under Draco’s hand, warm and familiar...
For a while, Draco had Harry. In a sense.

, it would have been quite nice if Voldemort didn’t try to kill me every year. And I would protest against not allowing first years on the Quidditch teams, except I got in, didn’t I?” Harry shoots him a sly look.
The other bonds stretch tight as his connection to Harry shortens. London smog irritates the back of his throat. Patches of bright lights mark the Muggle areas, and the haze of magic mark Wizarding London. Draco dives.
Draco’s eyes flick to the high table, but McGonagall is not there. Foreboding clenches Draco’s stomach.
“When?”
In fact, it was a

The team is filled with professional craft mages who have built many modern magical houses, and two people who have participated in the reconstruction of other magical castles on the Continent.
“We told you it would be fine,” Harry says.
Harry’s chest slowly tightens. Are they...here to protect them?
Harry tilts his head back and grins. “Draco, even your punishments are enjoyable.”
Malfoy stares at him. “What the fuck, Potter.”

Malfoy smirks, and slowly wanks it. It shouldn’t be possible, but it’s growing larger in his hand, the head of it peeking out whenever he tugs the foreskin down. It’s slick, shiny with precome and lube, and Harry’s hands twitch. He wants to touch—he whines, stares into Malfoy’s eyes, tries to make Malfoy understand that he wants it.
Harry’s eyes light up even more. “Wait, I can actually ride on you?”

Potter’s hesitant at first, and maybe to a human like him, a thestral’s teeth may look intimidating. But after Draco sternly tells them not to bite poor Potter, the foals take the meat out of Potter’s hands with exaggerated care, and one brave (or daft) foal even licks Potter’s hand, startling a laugh out of Potter.
Once class ends and they leave, Pansy immediately props an arm on Draco’s shoulder.
“What are you two talking about?” Weasley asks suspiciously.
“Have you not seen today’s

Harry cracks a grin. “You’ll be my trophy husband.”
Harry rolled his eyes, but his lips quirked up from its prior serious frown. “You’re such a git.”
” Potter says.
Jamie Ottley quickly looks up. “Good evening, Professor! We’re practicing for the rebuilding next week!”
In the Great Hall that morning, Professor McGonagall sits with the slightest slump in her chair, resisting the urge to rub her eyes tiredly.
Harry wriggles deeper into the blankets and closes his eyes.
He’s thinking about how he’s not entirely sure he feels safe in Gryffindor anymore. Not with Mason and Taylor and their friendship groups eyeing him across the common room. Not with how Creevey led those people to Slytherin’s entrance.
Alice doesn’t answer, but the Gryffindor boy does.
Draco growls, pushing Harry against the glass. Harry lets out a breathy moan. With a wave of Draco’s hand, Harry’s robes parts, revealing flushed-red cheeks. Draco toys with the plug with one hand, plastering his front to Harry’s back. Harry’s hips make tiny motions, and Merlin, it’s so fucking

spend most of the night awake, forcing many editors and journalists doing the same thing. She deserves to have a morning nap.
When Draco finally regained the presence to stop, he realised that Harry was in a half daze, half unconscious.
Draco doesn’t push them. They meet Madame Pomfrey outside the Forest and they all head back to Hogwarts. Back in the Slytherin Commons, Draco directs Blaise to help settle in their new ‘visitors’.
“Blaise and I will lead you,” Draco says. “Harry.”
Pansy glances at Draco. Unlike a few minutes ago, Draco is now composed.
McGonagall stands up. “If there is nothing else, this interrogation is over,” she says sharply.

“Eh, you think so highly of yourself.” Pansy flops down, accidentally-not-accidentally hitting Draco in the gut. “If you’re staying, then so am I,” Pansy says. “I’m
“No, you, don’t be sorry. But I’m not sitting at the Slytherin table anymore. Looking at Malfoy’s face...makes me want to punch him.”
Blaise greets them with a cool nod. “Good afternoon.”
“Recliner, Pansy,” he orders.
Malfoy nodded. “If I may. That will save me the long walk from the Manor front gates.”
“What are you talking about? You’re the key star in our plans,” Pansy drawls. “Come, let Draco hug you.”
Hermione gave him a sidelong look. “There’s more to being a good partner than being a good cook,” she informed him. “If he’s a good cook, are you going to marry him instead?!”
“Weeeeelll,” Pansy says.

“You—

But does Malfoy still keep in touch with any of them? Did anything
The uneasy feeling in Draco's chest grows. "I'll accompany you to McGonagall's office nonetheless. Alert me through the badge once your meeting is over."
Shacklebolt gives everyone a stern look. “The Ministry has decided to give this team two weeks. After two weeks, we will assess their progress and evaluate whether or not they are suitable. Among those conducting this evaluation will be the Headmistress of Hogwarts herself, the person who has the clearest knowledge on the nature of Hogwarts. We will also bring in a panel of expert magical theorists.”
Malfoy’s announcement.
. “I’m merely endowed with incredible genetics.”
Harry’s eyes widen, then a smile grows on his face at seeing the familiar creatures. Next to him, Draco sighs when a small thestral stumbles on its landing.
Later that day, Harry takes Draco to meet the Weasleys, with McGonagall’s permission. Hermione and Ron also come. To Harry’s surprise, a number of stern, unfamiliar looking witches and wizards are also waiting, each carrying a large box. The boxes themselves are made from gold, who knows what treasures are inside...
Slytherin of mine will take such an attitude, dear Potter,” he says sternly. “If you really wished to increase your height, then we could break your legs and regrow the bones longer.”

shoulder.”
After farewells, the two leave.
And so by the time Harry lifts the plate away enough, he sees a small, black hexagon box rimmed with gold. He blinks in confusion. “Ah? What the? When did you learn magic tricks?” He squints at it, and the plate in his hand inadvertently tilts.
Minerva decides to keep quiet for now. She’ll deal with it when Richard decides to tell the Ministry that he dueled a student who was supposed to be under his care.

Blaise turns to the three remaining third years. “Now, perhaps you can show me the spells you learnt. What is the first step?” he asks.

“...Why are you making such a weird expression?” Harry says, looking up from his lost game.

Unexpectedly, Grimmauld Place becomes a Project. Ron and Hermione stay there for a while before their trip to Australia, and Hermione fixes up the library and Ron spruces up the kitchen. Neville comes by to clear the garden, and Luna replaces all the old curtains and paints blue skies and clouds on the ceiling of one of the bedrooms. Bill and Fleur remove the old decor and certain paintings, and George and Lee Jordan put up new photos of Harry and all his friends.
Harry looks at Malfoy, horrified. “Are there

Harry cleared his throat. “I’m used to drinking milk when the kids are here. Molly keeps some cows, and I go and milk them every Sunday.”
“As both a Slytherin and a friend to Granger, I understand that your allegiances can be at odds.”
Not long after, the adult thestral returns with Draco walking alongside it.
Harry smiled brightly, half of it being relief. Now that Malfoy bought it up, that meant he was fine with it. “Yes, that would be great.”
, Harry thinks. Is Malfoy a manager? A lawyer? An errand boy? And why the fuck do the goblins like Malfoy more than Harry?
“Take it apart,” the Unspeakable orders.

Memory of the Slytherins’ nightly routine flashes in Harry’s mind. “There are two beds in the Eighth Year dorm.”
...but that doesn’t mean there hasn’t been any.
In one of Malfoy Manor’s drawing rooms, Narcissa Malfoy discards the evening’s special paper and takes the letter that her son has just sent instead. Her unease does not dissipate, Draco’s letter is not reassuring at all.
Draco’s mind flashes to the courting-muggles book that Pansy gave him for Christmas.
“Not until everyone pulls their head out of their arse and sits down to talk,” Harry counters.
Draco narrows his eyes, grasping Harry’s shoulder and squeezing not nearly as hard as he wants. “Harry! Potter! Why did you accept? Don’t you realise they used you as bait?? What if Greyback caught you?!”

He buried his head into his food, creating an appearance of a cute hamster with his filled cheeks.
“You didn’t listen to a word I said,” Blaise sighs. He pats the wall, and the staircase magic patterns seem to even out a bit more.
Knowing the true cause of the bonds, Draco feels incomparably warm and a little Hufflepuff-y. The Slytherins benefit from this by getting to have later bedtimes for a week. But then Pansy tricks him into telling her what he found out.

Draco outlines what happened. Pansy’s frown deepens.

Under the cover of the thestrals, they fly directly over the location. Draco looks down, his eyes flashing as the pupils change to dragon eyes. He can make out the irregular shapes that are Greyback’s crew. He can smell the stench of meat on them too.
Malfoy clicks his fingers and a large pile of papers appear in the air, falling neatly onto the palm of his hand. “Pansy, Blaise, and I will be working through this pile of papers that are

He couldn’t act towards Charlie in the same way he did with Draco.
about getting Charlie to join them, but Harry didn’t realise that Draco had known he’d like Charlie even before.
So Harry does. But this time, both of them step inside, and Draco closes it behind them. Harry has just enough time to balance the lunch on top of a pile of galleons before Draco shoves him against a conveniently empty wall and starts fucking his mouth with his tongue. WIth luck, and some seduction, Harry’ll have Draco fucking his mouth with his cock. The alternative is that cock in his arse, which, truth be told, sounds really good as well. There’s no way Harry can lose.
Draco may have taken down Greyback and Aegis, but he still has his own mother to contend with.
McGonagall’s heart freezes. “No...Mr Malfoy, what have you done?” she whispers.
Potter frowns. “We shouldn’t

Potter makes a familiar stubborn expression. “Okay, if you’re not, then I’m not.”
Maybe Draco and Potter haven’t...fully undergone puberty yet? Pansy laughs to herself. As she snuggles up with Draco again, she feels glad that Potter decided to join Slytherin.
This Tuesday morning is unlike other Tuesday mornings.
Pain bursts across his body again and again as they make it past the reduced number of
do you understand?”
, Taylor thinks. If Aegis can’t do it, he can’t do it either. It looks like Slytherin is here to stay.
After Hagrid promises he’ll let the thestrals watch in a roughly fenced area separate from the human guests, Draco submits to Narcissa’s final touches on his robes.
” Draco says pointedly.
Dinner in the Slytherin Commons is a subdued affair, and everyone is feeling the strain when homework time comes around.
“Take me out first,” Draco conceded.
To the riotous applause and the sparkling magical lights, Draco and Harry kiss.
, Draco thinks as he watches them go.
hanging between them.
“If I hurt you, I’m sure Draco will wake up,” Pansy says with a wink to Harry.
The lift reaches their floor and the two go to their quarters and climb back into bed, curling up into their usual sleeping positions.
“Oh yeah, I keep forgetting about that...anyway, finally done? You can’t delay the seeker competition anymore, Draco!”
Harry’s lips twitch even more, the corners of his mouth going up. “Master, huh? Then many of the younger Slytherins must be geniuses.”

: 🥺🥺🥺😢 (｡•́︿•̀｡) (ノ_<。) Mr Malfoy…
“Oh.”
Draco snorts. “You and Pansy clearly have too much time on your hands, developing strange worlds in your mind. How about you help Pansy with the two-way mirror charms?”
Hermione hates it whenever he mentions how he needed to die, even if it’s the truth. In this matter, Harry would side with Parkinson. If his death would bring back all the people who had unfairly died during the War, Harry would do it in a heartbeat.
And so the visitors get their second shock of the day as a silver-eyed white dragon suddenly rises into the air.
That evening in bed, once the lights are out, Harry says, “You don’t seem to like Charlie very much. I thought since he likes dragons and
(Yes, they had been housemates for over a year now, and Harry cooked for him, and gave him silly gifts, and had even tucked him into bed once, but how could Draco be sure it was attraction and not, oh, Gryffindorishness?)

Draco can see the conflicted expression on Harry’s face. But he will not compromise on safety, not right now.

“Not until you conceded,” Draco drawls.
Potter blinks. His cheeks redden. “Yeah, of course.”
They look as though
“I still recovered some magic overnight. Draco, you can use it.” He holds his hand out.
But Pansy and Blaise came, and Draco tries not to think about what kind of miserable fuck he would have been without them. And he doesn’t fault Greg for staying away—he knows Greg is happier working his community service hours than going back to school.
On Sunday morning, Slytherins coming down to the Commons for breakfast will find Pansy reclining on the Eighth Years’ throne sofa, tea and pastry on the coffee table, newspapers and magazines in hand, and her lips curled up in a smirk.
Harry joins the group of seventh and sixth years gathering around Draco and Blaise.
Higher ceilings, a new mezzanine floor, and the walls further apart. Harry never knew that rooms could grow like this in Hogwarts, aside from the Room of Requirement.
—lightly. “But right now, Hogwarts likes me.” Magic pulses under his hand.
Draco smiles in amusement. Aster Grace is a potions adept—one of the best, aside from Draco obviously.
Blaise holds back the distaste of heaving to crawl into the Hufflepuff Common Room. He spells his robes clean again once he’s inside.
“Isn’t it a little cold…” Harry wondered, but he followed Draco inside.
Draco’s smirk immediately turns into a frown. “Yes. Blaise has a good relationship with Hogwarts.”
,” Draco drawls.
“This is not Charms,” Professor Vector says somberly. “We are not fanciful. Such...
“That’s it, that’s it Harry. You’re going to come for me, aren’t you? Because you’re a
“It feels good...you’re so hard...so deep...ohhh!”
. Fondness flowed in Draco’s chest. But he wasn’t going to let Harry get away with it.
Harry runs a frustrated hand through his hair. Hermione is staring at him, daring him.
Draco hesitates, but he ultimately leaves when Harry threatens to throw a pillow at him. His chest aches as the distance between them grows, but it’s not entirely the bond. He wants to stay by Harry’s side, hold him protectively in his hands.
“They both hate
“...Yeah, he has.”
Malfoy looked down at him, his eyes a little soft and amused. “I’m flattered.”
: *huffs* I already have money!
“We are
“Pansy told me about a muggle custom.”
“Oh...Then why is Malfoy there? Shouldn’t it just be the professors?”
“I’m totally capable—wait? I can stay?” Potter’s eyes brighten. “Heh, I was going to stay anyway.”
Inside are the cracks snaking across the floor. Inside is the missing Slytherin Hourglass. Inside are the new supports and floor, and waters being suppressed below.
“Yep.”
After Draco leaves the room, Harry gingerly gets up. There’s still the feeling of magic not quite fitting under his skin, but
“Is there something?” Draco Malfoy asks.
Harry’s eyes fluttered closed again, a little sound escaping his mouth. It was tingly and good and if his Dom would just keep doing that forever and ever...
None of which is actually

“Solicitor Malfoy, Mr Potter went this way?” a brave person asked.
Draco has to grudgingly admit defeat.
“They can talk to Hogwarts, obviously,” Pansy says quietly back.
” Draco’s wings beat to the side, glaring at the thestral that has nudged his side mid-air. Then, he rolls his eyes. It’s the thestral leader…
,” Granger says.
When the two of them return to the Slytherin Commons, all of the younger Slytherins and visitor-students are sitting, watching the entrance.
Draco shoots her a sharp look and proceeds to round up all the Slytherins for the Hogwarts Christmas Fest. Everyone is dressed up properly in formal robes.
“The final NEWTs Potions brewing is done
Some of the younger, more savvy parents wonder...could they go up close to the dragon too like the students? Look, even that Harry Potter is riding on the dragon’s back!
family too.
“Draco, good evening,” Lovegood greets warmly.
“That’s right,” Blaise agrees. “If we build Hogwarts, Hogwarts must agree. And Hogwarts won’t agree if Slytherin is not included. The rebuilding of Hogwarts must be organic, not rigid.”
: *sighs* Eating my vegetables, making me do homework...You're such a mum, Malfoy.
RIght now, the sky is dark but the moon has not yet risen. Draco accompanies three Slytherin students, Nolan Larch, Mesa Wattle, and Martin Gamp. They join with the larger group from the other houses, as well as Madam Pomfrey. While Madam Pomfrey attends to the students from the other houses, Draco distributes the last Wolfsbane potions to the Slytherins.
Minerva rubs her temples as she thinks of all the Ministry’s papers and letters on her desk, all the things she’s stopping them from implementing at Hogwarts.
With loud footstops, he approaches them.
“Ordering me around, Malfoy?” Harry’s eyes crinkled in amusement. “I do remember that you had a sweet tooth back in school.”
The cart slows to a stop.
Harry immediately chooses Snap, because neither he nor Hermione can stand up to Ron’s chess skills.
They share a look of shared experiences, and another thin friendship thread re-establishes.
Warm fires crackle from the fireplaces around the Slytherin Common’s perimeter and many candles light the ceiling like a carpet of stars. Holly and ivy hang from the walls, and the scent of pine permeates the air.
“I can’t say I’m enjoying your sticky behaviour,” Draco drawls. “Is this how you behave with your sidekicks? I’m surprised you’re not out at Hogsmeade with them.”
Harry follows, but he’s still annoyed, the magic around him heavy. “I just

“Free snacks for hungry students?” Hedge says hesitantly.
“Oh.”

Pansy is one of the best at Legilimency. After all, there’s a reason why she knows all the gossip.
, are the Slytherins going to stop eating too?” Professor Coates scoffs.
Draco’s chest eases as he holds Pansy and Potter in his arms. There is no danger, only calm, and Potter’s rapidly increasing heartbeat.
Draco's eyes lower. He reflexively checks the bond in his chest. Of all his bonds to his Slytherins, the one to Harry is stretched tightest, because he's all the way up in the Gryffindor tower—
The Minister smiles slightly. “I received your letter. These two Aurors were coming down to question Mr Malfoy, and I took the opportunity to come along.”
“I need to go. Good day, Potter. Lovegood.”
“If you’re
Blaise acquiesces.
“Yes.”
Harry laughed. At that time, his stomach took the inopportunity to grumble.
...and he also ran to Draco just like the other Slytherins.
What is he going to tell her?

Draco sighs lightly. “Since we’re here, we can set down new foundations.”
the extra wizard space—even Malfoy Manor is resilient to Draco’s attempts to modify it, and his mother has to coax it to change. That said, with the knowledge of Hogwarts’ flexibility, he and Blaise had gone on to make much greater changes to the Slytherin Common Room.
Little shudders spread through Harry’s body. Draco revels in the little frown on Harry’s forehead.
: Ummm because your magic is unstable, don't want to cast magic on you (never mind that the bond is magic, that Hogwarts is magic...*cough cough*)
When they see Harry’s face though…Creevey’s eyes go red.
The statue—a figure of a wizard—makes a haughty face. “Meddling with Hogwarts’ magic, that’s what,” he grumbles.

The thought of visiting makes Harry sick, but he has to go early in the morning, if he’s to have time to suffer through the process
The Ministry event was on Friday the 14th, February, and Draco met with his colleagues first in the Mysteries’ tea room.
Draco smirks and pushes Harry along to be entertained by the younger Slytherins. Later, Draco will hear them compare the handwriting-correcting quills Draco gifted them all—of course, he bought different styles/versions for each person.
Draco pats Potter on the arm. “It’s nothing I can’t handle.”
“Let’s go.” Draco offered his hand. Harry took it.
Aster meets Felicity’s eye across the potions laboratory.
The corner of Malfoy’s lips twitched. “I said nothing,” he said mildly. “These paintings seem somewhat familiar. Who is the artist?”
Draco sneers coldly.
: *to Draco* I heard that you adopted Nolan...I also don’t like my family, can you adopt us too? 🥺
“It’s a little harder to expand the rooms lately,” Blaise says quietly to him.
She remembers back when Draco would write such long letters and tell her everything about his day, including all the times he provoked Potter. But now, his letters are brief, and only about how the reconstruction is going. Draco’s key role in the reconstruction has changed his reputation, so a number of other families are now more willing to open marriage talks, but Draco completely ignores Narcissa’s subtle hints.

Narcissa feels very conflicted with Draco’s indifferent and apathetic tone. It’s an aspect of her baby son growing up that she doesn’t quite like, but she doesn’t have a chance to talk to him face-to-face any time soon. She can only hope that Pansy is keeping an eye on Draco for her...
“Oh.” Harry deflates. “Then how can I help…”
,” Draco says pointedly. They might be cousins, but they are cousins in the way he and the late Nymphadora Tonks were cousins—Lovegood’s father is struck off from Malfoy family trees.
Shacklebolt smiles wryly. “You gave out the challenge for us to fix Hogwarts, so we’ll have to attempt that. I’ll do my best to give the Ministry a deadline, and if they cannot meet it, you will be put in charge.”
Later:
“We are of Gryffindor…”
be the only independent paper remaining?”
“No!” Harry sat upright on Draco’s lap and jabbed Draco in the cheek.
Pansy’s eyes glint sharply. “Of course.”
They enter McGonagall’s office. Inside, McGonagall, Kingsley Shacklebolt, Auror Hitchly and Auror Bartholomew are waiting for them.
“Is there a problem?” Draco asks.
Draco’s words make sense a moment later when he starts to strip.
. “No...I don’t think I should go back. They’re still mourning…”
“You write to the

Draco knew then, what Harry wanted. What Harry needed. Icecream, warm blankets, and sex.

“Rather than doing something drastic and removing Slytherin, we should be focusing on finding the people who hurt you...and the others…” Hermione trails off as she realises.
“The papers even speculated….It’s Harry, of course. With his messy black hair and bright green eyes.” Draco’s lips curl up.
Draco quirks his lips slightly and reaches out to grab Harry’s wrist. “Don’t crash into the wall, Potter. You need to save your brain cells.”

Nolan presses up against Mr Malfoy as the pressure becomes heavy.
The scowl on Garren’s face deepens. He darts forward, wand jabbing.
“Don’t be so maudlin, Harry,” Draco says lightly. “With all the students and professors in Hogwarts, how could it not be enough?”
Now that Draco has legally adopted so many children, he decides it's time to reveal (show off) his dragon form. It's a day full of fun and games, and Draco posing confidently for the camera.
“I think those are just tourists,” Harry says.
The next morning, Draco arises early as usual. A feeling of unease passes through him when a barn owl comes flying into the Eighth Year dorm room.
Harry hugged Draco’s arm. “Everyone, this is Draco. He’s my boyfriend!”
Harry immediately grabs the opportunity to sleep right next to Draco. He snuggles up, all warm and cosy. Draco pats his head and Harry drifts off to sleep, perfectly content. And when Harry wakes up the next morning, Draco (who had woken up earlier), is now patting his head again, his long fingers carding through Harry’s curls…
“What are you moaning about? Isn’t it just Charlie’s dick?” His other hand trailed down Harry’s back, down to where Weasley cock was penetrating him. He hooked one finger under the rim.

: *grumbles* Yes?
“Good doing business with you,” Pansy says briskly. “Oh, it looks like Jamie is drawing more dragon cards…”
“It’s clearly due to the enchantments on the Room!” Hermione replies in frustration.  “I already explained this years ago.

Ben Taylor leaves the temporary tent-office, clutching his letters.

Pansy writes down the changes and hands out the copies of the written schedule, and Draco notes down names of volunteers who will help with the Great Hall set-up.
“If I gave myself up earlier, would fewer people have died?” Harry says abruptly. “I needed to die. It had to happen.”
Draco liked how Harry’s eyes were brighter. How they were no longer red-rimmed like that day he’d shown up. He liked how Harry didn’t seem so far away anymore, how Harry
Draco helps set up all the warming charms, the weather-protection charms, the lighting charms, and also helps set a large even platform over the grass. Multiple ‘zones’ are set up, from the food section to a cozy section around an open fire, to various areas with the games the younger students have bought out.  The thestrals come to play, and Hagrid also brings over a couple of kneazles and crups for students to pet.

...Less than an hour later, the Slytherins are no longer working.
Draco eventually emerges from the bathroom and slips into bed on the other side. “Reading?”
“Hogwarts serves its students, not the other way around,” the Unspeakable says coldly.
“This is a matter of importance for all the students and staff currently at Hogwarts,” Hitchly says confidently. “Not only has he broken his parole, but he has broken common laws too.” He puts the file down in front of Robards.
“Now you,” Harry said.
“Fine, fine.” The Hufflepuff goes inside first, and after half a minute, finally lets Draco and Potter inside.
On the other side of the Great Hall, Granger is casting, “

Then, McGonagall stands up with a dark expression on her face. With a series of unintelligible words and sweeps of her wand, all of the incoming owls are pushed back and out of the Great Hall.

“This is

“Why do I feel like you’re a mama duck herding your baby ducks…” Harry sniggers.

Madam Pomfrey shakes her head. “Even newly healed patients must sleep, Mr Potter.” She recasts diagnostic spells on Draco. “He is no longer in danger due to magical exhaustion. However, he needs to rest to fully recover.”
“For?”

The sound of the clop-clop-clop of hooves makes Harry look up from the dangerous beast he’s supposed to be interacting with. His eyes widen.
The corner of McGonagall’s lips curl up coldly. “One person from each newspaper. Hand your wands to me, and I’ll allow you to take pictures of the aftermath. We have followed the Wizemgamot’s order, and the predictable has happened.”

However, the other meetings go longer, to the point that they have to schedule follow-ups.
“I remembered at the beginning when you and Hermione weren’t so…” Harry sighs, trailing off. “I suppose there’s no rule that my friends must also be each other’s friends. But future family dinners will sure be awkward.”
Their first stop...is the thestrals’ glade. They stir upon Draco’s arrival. The little ones trot to Draco’s side, but Draco nudges them away.

“No.” Robards glances briefly at the file Hitchly has given him. “No, none of these charges will be sufficient to imprison him. No, I won’t tell you why, but I’m sure you’ll read about it eventually….in the papers.” Robards looks at Hitchly. “Since you’re here, I can save the effort and directly hand you this suspension.”

Harry sucks in a sharp breath. “No! It is! Seriously Malfoy, you don’t know everything.” Harry hugs it to his chest, dust and chess-piece grumbles inside be damned.
“Actually, that’s a good idea,” Weasley says, none the wiser.
In the end, Draco has chosen to hold lunch in the rose gardens, as it truly is the most suitable place that was well chosen by past-Draco.
“And you’re going to be

.” Draco shudders. “And what is Potter doing in all this?”
McGonagall briefly closes her eyes and then opens them again to watch as the last of Slytherin’s magic is expelled from the castle, leaving nothing but rubble and scattered leftover magic.
“Brave Gryffindor,” Draco said lightly. He pushed in a second finger. At the brief tightening of Harry’s brows, Draco stilled his fingers and instead pinched Harry’s nipple. Harry’s eyes snapped open, his lips in a slight pout. Draco gave him a kiss in apology.
Nguyen gives him a sharp look. “Don’t be stupid. Oh, wait,
Harry’s eyes snapped open. He turned his head the other way and suddenly met blue eyes on a freckled face.
A tight squeeze and Draco spirals out right above the mountains, the loud explosion of his apparition echoing into the distance. A flock of birds take flight in shock and a number of annoyed creatures in the Forest grumble.

“But unfortunately, I have no intention of leaving, so I cannot escort you back. You’re a tasty morsel to many in the Forest, Potter.” Draco rubs his temples. “Damn it, you’ll have to stay.”
Malfoy’s eyes flicker to the cut out image on the desk. “Yes.”
“After reading your accompanying message with your order, we decided to upgrade your order, free of charge, to the extra-large size. For easy storage, we have included this space-storage box also free of charge.” Pansy hands over a square box, a two-handspans in size—though it fits easily in Hagrid’s palm.
The Halloween-set-up volunteer group returns at sunset. With all the Slytherins in attendance, they light the central fire pit and lay out the food that the house-elves graciously provided for their ancestors and passed loved ones and family.

looked better post-orgasm than Charlie.
Harry’s brows furrow. A moment later, lube appears on his fingers, and he starts to tug Draco’s cock. It takes almost all of Draco’s concentration to remain still and not fuck that circle of Harry’s fingers. But his cock shows his enjoyment nonetheless, growing as it stiffens under Harry’s ministrations.
After Mr. Malfoy leaves, Harley and Nolan make their way to the third years boys dormitory.
We’re going to see whether we can help!”
As the meeting concludes, Garren turns to Harry. “And how are you, Mr Potter? You’ve now been in Slytherin for almost two months.” He gives a nod to Hermione. “I understand your impulse to join Slytherin. However, this is not necessary, and I’m very sure the Sorting Hat will gladly return you to Gryffindor.”
“We offer you this magic,” McGonagall continues solemnly. “Four Houses to stand as one Hogwarts.”

,” McGonagall says in a very dry tone. “Teaching is much preferable to dealing with the Hogwarts Board of Governors at the moment. Go, I won’t delay your afternoon any longer.”

Nolan clenches his teeth, anger burning in his belly.

Harry is a little dazed as he wakes up on the weekend. It feels cold. He reaches out and pulls a duvet over him. Does the bed feel emptier than normal?
While the older students get to directly help out, the younger students come together to think of more things they could add to the new castle. Word is that if you tell Jamie Ottley in Slytherin, then there’s a much higher chance of it being included. This leads to the introduction of many students to the house-elves of Hogwarts.

As the Slytherin Building gets to the edge of the castle site, its movement slows down. Under McGonagall’s direction, some students and Flitwick start moving away the dirt and stone under it, so that it can slowly descend. Hogwarts’ magic tightens its hold, pulling Slytherin to the rest of the construction and slotting it into place.
“What are we talking about?” Blaise asks.
“I expect you to work together while the rest of us are gone. There will be some Slytherins with study periods around, too. I will
...Though by the end of the two weeks of the Easter break, they inexplicably feel sad to see children go. The Manor becomes sad and quiet without them.
“I’ll see them when I’m free,” Draco replies. “I appreciate your help, Professor.”
Draco looks at him, unimpressed, until Potter starts squirming.
Harry nods. He wraps Draco up in the robe and cradles him in his arms.
“No, Draco,

A huge urge rose in Draco’s chest to bite his lip for him. And so he did, kissing his future-husband very thoroughly until Harry was left dazed, lips red.

“I should...apologise.”
“I’m taller than you.”
There are a number of other students in the Hospital Wing, privacy curtains drawn up.
He gets down from the stage, only to be ambushed by Granger and Weasley. Both of them tug him hard, saying something that Draco can’t hear over the noise.
“I need to go,” he growls when Potter grips his elbow. Draco tugs away and starts limping out of the room.

Draco raises an eyebrow, and jabs Harry in the arm. “Because
Arousal and pleasure pulsed through Harry’s body. His skin felt hot, his hole was stretched so much. He felt like his insides were changing, changing to fit Draco, to make a home for Draco’s cock. Harry could barely think.

Only then does Draco follow Harry up to their bedroom. They complete their nightly ablutions and climb into bed together.

With an aborted moan, Harry comes too, his hole clenching and his cock pulsing onto the messy pillow below.

“Nolan, Harley, Aster, Mesa, these are the thestrals of Forbidden Forest.”
“Harry, you’ve done your potions assignment already,” Hermione says. “You need to work on your Care Of Magical Creatures assignment next. Since there is no Slytherin doing it, it would be easier for you to do it with Ron after dinner.”

Draco automatically looks up when the Slytherin passageway opens. Felicity Shafiq hurries in, mouth set in a frown as she heads over to Draco and his friends.

Draco narrows his eyes. “Repeat that again.”

Minister Shacklebolt begins: “Good morning students and staff of Hogwarts, panellists, Wizengamot Member Griffith, members of the press. It has now been two weeks since Headmistress McGonagall took over the rebuilding of Hogwarts. While Hogwarts has now since been declared an independent school, the rebuilding of Hogwarts must comply with Ministry safety codes. The school must be solid and safe for centuries to come. The Ministry has regathered the impartial team of expert magical theorists to analyse the new progress. As Headmistress McGonagall contributed to the report of the prior Ministry team’s evaluation, Unspeakable Nightshade will play the analogous role. Please allow the team to conduct their examination in peace.”

Slytherin has been an integral part of Hogwarts since the very beginning, and for all that Draco’s starting to realise that not all traditions are worth keeping, he finds it hard to imagine a Hogwarts without Slytherin.
Garren scans the Slytherin Commons, and turns his gaze back to Draco and his friends. “Call everyone down, I have some announcements and information about Halloween.”
“Hogwarts is over a thousand years old, not a little third year,” Blaise says.
When Draco wakes up, early the next morning, his mother’s owl is waiting for him. And as he reads the contents, his stomach flashes from cold to hot.

And the first thing she does is veto the Wizengamot’s decision to remove Slytherin from Hogwarts.

Harry has now confessed.
Draco is also secretly relieved.

Well, of course not, they’re better than you, after all. It’s understandable that you haven’t heard about the Ministry bill to remove Slytherin from Hogwarts. Since you don’t even know that, you also wouldn’t know what the Unspeakable department did. I suggest you return and gather some information first.”
He can bet the world that the Dark Lord hadn’t thought of

At this point though, Draco’s thrusts filling Harry’s hole, leaving it empty, filling it again, has started to become a comforting rhythm, and the little zings of pleasure are far from enough to bring Harry to orgasm again.

: We’re not!
Harry glances briefly at Draco, before looking back at McGonagall.
Narcissa gave him an encouraging look, her eyes searching.
Draco turns his head upon Harry’s approach.

Draco rinsed Harry off, and lifted him out of the bathtub. The huge white towel was large enough to wrap Harry up entirely. Harry looked up at him with wide, hazy eyes, smiling—and grouching a little—as Draco vigorously dried him off. He helped Harry into his pyjamas, slipped Harry’s glasses back on. They brushed their teeth together, and Draco led him by the hand back to their bedroom.
The Fat Lady rolls her eyes, snorting. “

Looping images of the reintegration of Slytherin and Hufflepuff grace many newspapers on Monday morning.

Hermione says, “I do feel sorry for them, planning and building a castle takes a lot more time than two weeks, and yet they had to prepare a new plan in just three days.”
: hehehe, teasing Harry platonically is fun
: *pushes Harry down onto the bed* Don’t call me mum. Call me daddy.
Draco doesn’t deign to answer, turning his focus to pampering Nolan instead. Nolan wriggles happily, throwing a wolfy smirk at Harry.
Madam Greengrass snorts. “
“Did you check my workplace? Did you ask my mother?”
Ducking into the cool Forbidden Forest, Draco makes sure that no one is watching, and transforms. The magic that pushes and crashes under his human skin expands and fills the large dragon form.
,” Malfoy drawls. “Is that so?”
Pansy cackles. “You better watch out.”
“Engaged? Our Harry is engaged?” George said, excited. Since he’d gotten engaged with Lee Jordan, his love-life had been the main source of gossip. If someone else got engaged, he’ll be released!
“Oh, fuck you, Potter,” Malfoy says as he takes the bouquet. “You don’t even know what these flowers
They are all wrong. Worse,
Potter looks at him in silence for a few moments, lips twisted in confused distrust.
“I’m not shy!”
“Go back to bed—”
Narcissa Malfoy occasionally donates to various charities
A moment later, the door is pushed open. “What was that?” Draco says, eyes narrowed in suspicion. “Something floated into the room.” His eyes fix on Harry. “Are you injured?”
“And his father is still alive.”
“HOW DARE YOU!”
He tried not to glance at Harry. He tried to do it under the guise of looking for traffic whenever they crossed a road. But then he met Harry’s eyes, and their fingers tangled, hands clasped, and Draco

“Nope, take it, and tell me no details,” Ron says, shoving the pamphlet at Harry.
“You two…” Draco is speechless about their contrived plot. Do they think it’s amusing to see him hug his ex-arch-nemesis? “Hug him yourself,” he retorts, and heads to the second bathroom to get ready for bed himself.
“What’s that expectant expression?” he says. “I can go see the thestrals whenever I want.” He smiles a fake soft smile. “If you missed them, Harry, just tell me and I’ll accompany you.”
Pansy surveys the students and leans towards Draco. “Look at them, you can’t control them at all.”
: *innocent* Huh?
Even though everyone tried to hold back their interrogations, they still did so nonetheless. They asked about when the two got together, why Malfoy gave him a ring, was Malfoy the one who wanted to keep this all a secret (no), could Malfoy cook (yes), did Malfoy win all the arguments at home (Harry wins, okay?!!)...
Blaise happens to be the only Eighth Year Slytherin sitting in the Slytherin temporary common room. Draco and the others are currently with McGonagall to work on the Great Hall, which technically spans three floors.
“Look at you, splitting open on my cocks,” Draco groans. “Fuck, is your arsehole ever going to close up after this? Fuck, look, my previous come is slipping out...”
As it is, weaving the connections does not take long. In front of Draco’s eyes, it’s enough to simply guide the main threads of magic: Hogwarts does the rest because Hogwarts knows best. Once the integration happens, it’s as though Slytherin has always been a part of Hogwarts.
A large creature flapped its wings against his window, blocking the sunlight.
“I don’t know,” Draco scowls. “If you’re not letting me sleep, then let me get up. At this rate, spelling armour-charms into everyone’s clothing may be the only option.”
But it was worth it.
Draco’s jaw tightens. “About how I treated you negatively during our past years of Hogwarts. And how I incited others to treat you and others the same way. You’re right, it hurts. We are all students of Hogwarts, as chosen by Hogwarts. I had no right to debate your right to be here.”
“At Hogwarts,” Draco repeats, his eyebrows raising a fraction in contempt.
Students wanting to duel Draco is one thing. Draco can deal with them. All the people he

And when Malfoy answers, Harry’s eagerly listening. The key, he realises, is to ask

Except she doesn’t.
Pansy groans, flopping her head on Draco’s shoulder. “How could I sleep with that racket?”
“But—you—Parkinson and Blaise—” Potter’s words garble together.
“You would never make it as a Slytherin.”

All the Gryffindors, of course, ignored his comment to flee. They’re all in various states on the floor, a few meters back from there they had been originally standing. Draco narrows his eyes, his teeth sharpening.

“So what, they still—aren’t you going to do anything, Mr Malfoy?” Nolan bursts out. He fists his robes, leaning forward in his sitting position. “If we let them go like that, they’ll just get more and more bold! We’re losing!”
A smile hovers on Malfoy’s lips. How could Harry even think of them as mocking? “I shan’t be taking fashion advice from

Harry participates in the clearing. “Finally, we can begin properly.” He looks at Draco next to him on one side, and Neville on the other. “Hm, it feels like after the battle again when we helped the rebuilding over the summer.”
“She didn't know. It was confidential. Kingsley only told her that I needed to visit the Ministry urgently...” Harry droops. “We almost had Greyback….And...wait...how did
“Breathe, Harry.” Malfoy’s strong hands gripped on his arms, keeping Harry upright.
After a long moment, Potter sighs. In a very quiet voice, he says, “Do you think there will be a third war?”
Malfoy thinks all his contract papers and legislation compliance forms would be much too difficult for Harry to understand (“Bah!” Harry says.)
“Hm…” Harry closes his eyes, snuggling closer to the source of heat. “G’night.”
Harry snuggled in, as though knowing, wanting, to keep Draco’s cock inside him.

“Good morning, class,” Professor Flitwick says in an upbeat manner, standing on his podium at the front of the classroom-tent. “Today, we will be starting a new topic that was not on the curriculum. Don’t worry, it won’t be tested,” he adds, much to Jamie’s relief.

Draco rubs Harry’s head, messing his hair up even more.
“Hm, not bad,” Malfoy looks over Harry’s shoulder.

“Understood.” Official #1 runs back, just in time for McGonagall’s lesson. Seeing how everyone is currently listening to her—and because of her sharp glare at him—Official #1 has to close his mouth and not interrupt.

No, no, they wouldn’t dare! They could only leave in disappointment.

different that the Slytherin dorm is now on the Hogwarts site.
Pansy flicks Draco on the forehead. “Don’t tease Harry like that!” She pulls Harry onto the bed and maneuvers him so that he’s sandwiched between her and Draco.
Harry’s smile brightens. “Thanks, Hermione.”
Harry is not a casual hand-holder. Then...then does that mean...
: Hmm, you would make a good father.
“Garren is not the Head of Slytherin, remember?” Harry says, frowning.
Granger is waiting outside the Great Hall. She avoids Draco’s cold gaze and looks at Harry.

Harry smiles knowingly at Draco as the two of them head back to Slytherin. Despite the scowl Draco is shooting at him now, he knows just how soft Draco is on the inside.
“Is this what you wanted?” Draco grunts out, his focus tightening in on his cock, on Harry’s arse, on Harry’s face.
In the equivalent of three floors, the stonework of the Great Hall rises with the help of wooden scaffolding and the transparent outline of the architectural plan.
“...Um,” Harry eventually broke the silence. “Aren’t you going to kiss me again, or do you want to go to sleep early?”

Harry is writing his Magical Creatures essay. Ron is doing a similar thing next to him, while Hermione is staring at her own work with a critical eye.
“Didn’t you bring your own friends? I was lonely,” Draco drawls, as his wand slashes. Greyback lunges at him and Draco throws a fireball right in his face.
“I was thinking waffles and ice cream,” Harry continued blithely. “A
“Yeah? It certainly felt like you hated us.”
Draco’s chest tightens. He can’t look away. His lips part. His grip on Harry’s hair tightens. “Harry…”
The bond suddenly stretches hair-thin. Did Harry just floo or apparate?!
“You kept trying to find out what we were up to. But we never gave in. Let’s see how

“Yes, like that,” Draco rasps. He starts to rock back and forth.

Draco pats Nolan’s head. “You’re still one of my Slytherins, and that will never change unless you want to denounce your Slytherinship and—”
The blood doesn’t hiss. Instead, the moment the droplets hit the flames, they dissipate into shimmers of colours as bright as the day, as deep as the night. The circle completes, forming patterns that weave through the air.

“Your words, Harry.”
“McGonagall will deal with it, she’s fair,” Harry repeats stubbornly. “It’s getting late...I’ll tell her tomorrow.”
Draco raises an eyebrow, and Harry’s cheeks redden.
The Slytherin renovations are almost entirely handed over to the Slytherin students, while the professors and alumni work on finishing the lower floors and starting building the walls for the ground and upper floors.
