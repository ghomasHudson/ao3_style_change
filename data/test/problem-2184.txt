Ron shrugged. “Probably. We didn’t see who did it though. The initial call was just that there was a Hippogriff in the family room, not that there was an attacker.”
You didn’t assault me last night. You breathed life into me, and dammit Draco, I really like you. I didn’t think, a week ago, that I would. But seemingly against all odds, I do. As the bard said, “
Agent Eta shook their head. “If I’m honest, I didn’t think it would. The beauty of magic is that if you use it against someone else who can do magic, it’s probably not going to work.”
“He went to the hospital looking for a Healer and left with a date,” Dean deadpanned. “That kind of chaos sounds
“I’m well. Lots of Flinitores around tonight, so I’m drinking elderberry lemonade. The lemon wards them off.”
“Dad?” Scorpius inquired, unable to tell if the man was awake or not. Harry didn’t really acknowledge him, but he did shift a bit, which told Scorpius he was at least listening.
As soon as they got back to the city, Harry announced that he was going to leave on the next flight out. Hassan didn’t argue, and so it was with a heavy heart that Harry packed up his things. The ride to the airport was as silent as the ride back from the festival had been, but when the time finally came for the two men to part ways, Hassan pulled Harry in for a hug.
“Are you carrying around a folder of blank pages?” he asked, reaching down to gather more of them. Draco got down next to him to help with the task.
Scorpius glanced around the dark living room, wondering where his dad might be. Teddy had mentioned him storming up to his room, so Scorpius headed toward the stairs.
“Or to marry,” he conceded. “So, what do you say? Come with me to the coast?”
The smile Draco gave him was brilliant, and Harry was happy to get lost in it. But Ginny and Seamus had started making gagging faces across the table, and Harry was getting annoyed. He was about to tell them off, when Neville started laughing.
“And what did you find?” his dad asked quietly.
He gave her hand a reassuring squeeze as they approached the hotel. Nodding to the welcome wizard, they made their way upstairs and down the hall to Harry's room. He unlocked the door and made his way over to the desk, grabbing his larger rucksack and stuffing it in his pocket with the aid of a shrinking charm. He turned back to Camilla to find that she had closed the door, and had
Scorpius frowned, reaching into his bag and pulling out the sandwich his dad had packed for him, handing it to Teddy who ripped into it before continuing.
“You know that’s not true. Agent Phi was the one who found the connection between the first two patients, and they also gave you the financial records that the third victim was responsible for.”
"There was a war, in England," he answered calmly. "They lost their lives fighting."
“So did he not pay you?” Luna frowned. Draco shook his head, still smiling gleefully.
Agent Delta unfolded the paper, which was clearly torn out of a notebook. Knowing that Agents Eta and Phi would get a hold of it eventually, Agent Delta read it out loud.
Hassan sat down next to him. "I think you look very good," he said reassuringly. "You are tall, and have very white teeth. Those are very important here. But anyway, it is fun, even if you are not the most beautiful man there."
“Will do, boss,” he teased. “Anything else you want me to get while I’m out?” he asked Draco, who shook his head. Satisfied, Teddy sauntered out of the room, and after conjuring glasses of water for both Scorpius and Draco, Adella left too.
“Hey dad, I brought your box back.”
“Thanks for that, Dad,” Scorpius said softly. “And for lunch,” he added, smiling as he opened it to find two individual sized chicken pies, along with a bunch of snacks and a thermos full of coffee.
Agent Delta was clearly in over their head.
There was an awkward silence for a moment, before Scorpius spoke again. “I’m really glad to see you again, Papa. I’ve missed you.”
Harry bit his lip. He wondered if she knew that the reindeer he'd purchased from her on that first day had been for Scorpius. He wondered if she'd expected them to have kids of their own.
Smith’s face twisted at that.
Agent Eta shrugged. “No, of course not. But problems do give up.”
It seemed Scorpius had stopped listening once he’d heard Harry’s name though, because he started knocking incessantly and calling out “Harry! Harry, I’m here! Let me in, Harry!”
“Thank you,” Scorpius said gratefully, and with a wink, she turned and left the courtroom.
"If you don't want to go in the sand, we can go see the rest of the museum," Draco suggested. Scorpius bit his lip and it looked for a moment like he was going to agree, but then a young boy jumped up in the middle of the pit.
Muttering under his breath, Hassan started up the car and drove off, not daring to look back. Harry gave him about ten minutes, to make sure they had gotten far enough away, before he started asking questions.
Harry nodded. “He said a few things that… well, he just gave me a lot to think about. But you don’t need to worry about it now. Go ahead and get your work done, I’ll take care of lunch.”
Harry nodded, trying to absorb all the information. He didn't know if everything Draco was saying made complete sense, but he'd gotten the important part; she was okay with the divorce.
“Yeah, I’ll do that.” Scorpius glanced at his watch and was surprised to see that his break was almost over. They settled their bill and packed their leftovers in silence. It wasn’t until they were back in the Atrium that Teddy spoke to him again.
Harry was rearranging all these purchases in his suitcase one evening, when Hassan knocked on the door.
“Scorpius has always been a compassionate person,” Harry said, trying to justify Scorpius’ decision. “He cares deeply for everyone he meets, and even more so for the ones he loves.”
“Another case? Do you think they might be related?”
“Are you warm enough?” Scorpius asked. He reached over and tugged a bit at the cloak, so that it covered his papa properly.
“I’m going to Paris tomorrow,” he blurted. Andromeda raised an eyebrow in surprise.
“Do you need…” Harry trailed off as Draco looked up at him. Harry crooked his elbow, indicating what he was offering, and Draco clearly understood from the way he shook his head.
“It was my pleasure. I had fun tonight, and I hope you did too,” he said with a smile. “I’m going to Apparate from here. Good night, Harry.”
“That’s what I’m hoping to find in the files I pulled. It feels important, and four years of being an Auror has taught me to trust my intuition.”
“Didn’t I tell you not to keep that cloak at the office anymore?” she demanded quietly. Harry rubbed the back of his neck, a nervous habit he’d picked up in the past few years.
He flipped through the pages to illustrate his point, when something caught his eye. Hidden between two blank pages were two small photographs—one of him as a kid, and one of his dad.
As he reached the top of the stairs, Draco turned toward the guest bedroom, but Harry stopped him.
Scorpius nodded. “I really hope so.”
“His lack of legal advice, coupled with the trauma from standing trial in front of a war tribunal as a youth, led my client to believe that he wasn’t allowed to speak, or that he didn’t have the same rights as any other citizen would. It’s frankly disgusting that our court could allow someone to be sentenced to life in prison without even getting the chance to speak.”
Teddy sighed and sank down onto the couch, gesturing for Harry to do the same. Ignoring him, Harry continued to pace. If he stopped moving, he was bound to explode.
Draco bit his lip. He’d have to consider his words carefully.
Potter stared at him for a moment, jaw hanging open.
Scorpius’ anger seemed to be ebbing away, but he remained silent, and another thought occurred to Harry.
“No solution ever forms itself.”
“Who’s a good boy?” Scorpius cooed, scratching the grey crup behind the ears. It was still quite small, and must be fairly young.
"Um, it was interesting," Harry mumbled, but at that moment, Scorpius piped up.
“You can’t keep dating him,” Agent Phi stated bluntly.
"I saw an advertisement for something called the Gherewol festival," Harry said. "What is that?"
“What do you mean he changed the potion?”
“I do love healing. But being the Unspeakable Liaison at St Mungo’s, I was doing a lot more surveillance and investigation than healing. I convinced myself that it was the only way to work in my dream career, since St Mungo’s wouldn’t hire me directly, but I wasn’t doing what I love.”
“The court calls to order Day 2 of the appeal hearing for Draco Lucius Malfoy. Today’s meeting should be short, I would simply like to confirm with Mr. Malfoy what actually happened 15 years ago. Head Auror Clearwater, can we bring the defendant in please?”
Harry laughed at that as well, waving goodbye to Draco, and then to Scorpius and Priscillia, before stepping out into the sunshine in Diagon Alley. For the first time in over a month, he wasn't thinking of Camilla.
"For me?" she asked, pointing at her own chest just to make sure.
Draco was ready to bang his head against the wall. Or hex someone. He’d prefer to hex someone, but instead he kept his composure and continued to cast Detection Spells on every single organ, muscle, bone and vessel he could think of. This poor girl had not only been Transfigured by an agressor, but had also been Transfigured back by an incompetent Healer.
“So, what do you think?” Scorpius asked as his father looked around the newly completed apartment in awe.
“Very well, we’ll join you in San Francisco. I guess someone has to keep you from getting married, yet again.”
Malfoy looked well. A little tired, sure, but he seemed strong and healthy. Harry didn’t usually notice things like that about other people, but it was a stark contrast to the Malfoy he remembered from the war.
He did not expect to find the man standing there holding a set of formal robes and nattering away about something or other. He barged into Harry's room, making the bed with a flick of his wand before laying the robes out on top of the covers.
“What changed?” Draco asked. Harry shrugged, not wanting to get into a detailed discussion about why school hadn’t been his priority as a teenager.
“What’s going on, Scorpius?”
“Okay, maybe I did pay more attention to you than normal,” Harry admitted, ignoring the way Ginny rolled her eyes at him.
Malfoy nodded. “A Healer’s job is always interesting. The human body can be very complex. Healing and caring for it even more so.”
"Harry, do you think you're subconsciously getting yourself into these situations? Is there a part of you that just desperately wants to be married?"
He was sure Harry’s admission that he still loved Draco had to do with it, but in a sudden spark of bravery, Draco turned to face Harry, reaching out and taking his hand. He squeezed lightly, and was reassured when Harry squeezed back.
The receptionist nodded and reached for a notepad, but paused once again.
“Hey kid. What are you creating this time?”
Draco didn’t look convinced, but he didn’t argue any more.
“Thanks for the soup,” Scorpius said. “It was delicious.”
Scorpius wasn’t paying much attention to the cross-examination, but from the satisfied expression on Harrison’s face, he gathered that his father’s story matched the evidence. He was just wondering how much longer the proceedings might last when the Chief Warlock stood up.
As soon as they arrived, Harry was sucked into a whirlwind of activity. He was introduced to a group of eldery people, whom he assumed must be the tribe’s leaders, and then shoved into a line with other men dressed similarly to him. Hassan was right that this wasn’t the same image of beauty Harry had been raised with, but it was hard to miss how proud these men were of the work they’d put into their appearances. Every one of them, while sharing similar traits, had their own unique touches, such as a differently placed string of beads, or handmade scarves and hats in beautiful, vibrant colours.
“I don’t know if that’s enough for me. I’ve heard that selling information about me to the
"Come, time for eating!" she said. Harry smiled, trying to ignore the fact that he had basically invited himself over for dinner. They seemed happy enough to host him, and if he hadn't just returned from Oslo, he probably would have made dinner plans with Camilla anyway.
Harry shrugged. “He knew you’d been arrested, but I refused to talk about why. I think I didn’t want to have to face reality, and I knew talking to Scorp about it would make it seem so much more real. I didn’t realise at that time how much I was hurting him.”
“Um, he didn’t have a lot of details,” Scorpius said carefully. He didn’t want to let on how much he knew, if it meant his dad would
Teddy nodded. “I used to fly with them whenever I was home from school. All the Weasleys are good, but they were both wicked fast. I think Harry’s slowed down a bit these days, but he still maneuvers a broom as if it was his own limb. Draco used to fly like that too, all graceful and powerful.”
"I don't think I would win any beauty competitions," he sighed. "I've always been a very scruffy kind of guy."
Harry laughed.
And then an idea occurred to him, and in that moment, Draco knew that he absolutely would accept so much money, and that he'd damn well put it to good use.
“I was,” he said proudly. “I’m sure if I had stayed, I would have been head by now, probably would have trained you myself! But alas, they needed me in Games and Sports, and I must say Penelope is a great second choice!”
“I don’t necessarily keep it here… I carry it everywhere I go. Leftover habit from the war, you know?”
Without a backward glance, Harry marched back into the sitting room and through the floo. He hesitated for a moment when he stepped out into his own sitting room before letting out a loud “What the fuck?”.
“Well, the culture there is very different. Did you know they don’t even fly? They mostly play muggle sports and use muggle transportation.” Harry took a moment to lament the fact that he hadn’t gotten to play football after all. Maybe there was something to be said for joining a group here instead. “And the lifestyle is really different too, people have to be really careful because of how hot it is. I probably spent most of the trip just renewing my sun protection charms.”
Harry smiled at her. “Of course I know. Anyway, I don’t think I would have been any better at partying when I was 22 either, so it doesn’t really matter.”
he did it! He’s supposed to rot in Azkaban, the fucking bastard!”
“I know. I was just hoping it could be less of a one night stand and more of a summer fling, especially when you mentioned you were planning to be in New York for a couple of weeks. I really like you, Harry, and I really wish I’d had a chance.”
“What?” Harry demanded, stunned that Bryan would say such a thing. “I don’t have feelings for Draco! He’s just a friend, and my—”
Bryan was silent for a moment, but Harry decided to wait him out. He was rewarded a few minutes later, when Bryan finally spoke.
“Which is why I asked him out on a date.”
Bryan stood up and shook Draco's hand.
"Okay. Time for bed."
“It could be. Muggle brands especially can cause micro-abrasions, almost like tiny paper cuts.”
. It wasn’t true, but Harry found he didn’t mind the assumption. Bryan was a great guy, and if he ever found himself in New York, he’d definitely send him an owl. But for now, they were going their separate ways—Bryan was headed home, and Harry had a couple of Malfoys to escort around San Francisco.
Teddy nodded, glancing over his shoulder toward the kitchen before saying “How’s your big case going?”
“I’m Draco and this is Harry,” Harry said quickly, grinning at the sound of Scorpius’ roaring laughter from the front row. Draco rolled his eyes but didn’t bother to correct Harry’s cheesy joke.
“I’ve put together a few papers for you,” Hassan said, handing Harry a folder. “I put my contact information and the information I have about the Wodaabe tribe in there, it might help you and your lawyer. I’m guessing you do not want to stay married?”
Scorpius had to sit on his hands to stop them from shaking as he watched Maphiane Harrison, the defence attorney that Teddy had recommended, stand up confidently in front of the court. Something about her posture, and the measured and powerful tone of her voice, helped to calm Scorpius’ nerves a bit as she started to speak.
in the damn thing. I know it sounds silly, but it’s every actor's dream to put their mark on
“I guess I just… I feel like an idiot. This morning when you said you were calling your lawyer, I still had this tiny hope that after the divorce we could still have something. I’m annoyed that I let myself fall for you.”
“Luna. How are you?” Draco seemed to gravitate toward Luna, and sat down next to her. Harry took the seat on his other side.
“Only milk,” Harry said, clearly trying to be stern.
He’s no longer a mission—I need to end this relationship before he gets too attached.”
“This is… incredible! Did you two really do this all by yourselves?”
“Would you like a kiss as well?” Draco asked, clearly trying his hardest not to laugh. Scorpius looked horrified, and he wriggle out of his father’s grasp, dodging the kiss before he slid off the bed.
"Well we used a combination of magic and muggle excavation techniques. There's a game area down the hall where you can try it, and then put a dragon skeleton together with the bones you find."
“Come on, ‘Mione—if he’s a supervisor he could be up to all kinds of things and get away with them too! Don’t tell me you’re not at least a bit curious about what that smarmy git is up to.”
“It’s not a big deal, Scorpius, I’ll use a drying charm later. Are you having fun?”
It's here! This work is actually part of a series, and you can now read the first part (along with art!), which actually inspired this work! Thanks so much for reading!
“Isn’t that an unfair deal, seeing as you want emergency shifts now?” the Head Auror asked, though she was laughing anyhow.
"Oh my god!" he suddenly cried. "You're that guy! The one who ended that war! Harry, you're a hero!"
“We were both idiots,” Harry said softly, kissing the top of his head. “What matters now is how we chose to move forward. I love you Draco, and I know I always will.”
Finally she took the bowl back and added more soup, this time filling the bowl right to the brim.
“I’m sorry I ran away last night, Dad. I should have stayed and dealt with the issue at hand, instead of leaving you in the lurch like that.”
show. An actor's Hamlet can be so defining and to have the opportunity to do it with Geoffrey Tennant! The man is a genius, and now that he’s left New Burbage to do some work in London; it's just such an incredible opportunity. (I mean—I’d work with him anywhere, but who wants to go to Canada?) I didn’t even know he had ties to the magical community!
Scorpius glanced at the door to the washroom, before looking back at Harry.
He watched as she leaned forward and picked up the journal, thumbing through the first few pages.
Draco turned to face Alfred Pertinger, 4th seat of Yorkshire in the Wizengamot, and his wife, who had rushed over to him as soon as he’d emerged from their daughter’s room.
"What are we doing?" Harry asked, aware of all eyes on them.
Draco nodded, glancing around. "Do you know if Harry kept any spare parchment and ink here?"
Harry turned to stare down the hall at the collection of identical doors, wondering which one might be an office. It was probably a very risky move to be snooping around in Draco’s flat, especially since he’d only said he was going to the washroom—that wouldn’t take very long. Though he wasn’t a Gryffindor for nothing.
"Has he gone out?"
“Okay, I’ll admit, I chickened out and only asked for three, which to be fair is still more than what I was initially going to ask for. But, he misunderstood me.”
“Oh, he paid me alright. He paid me 300
“Their beauty ideals are very different from what you must be used to back in Britain,” Hassan explained. “During the Yaake, they roll their eyes, and smile very widely, to show off that their eyes and teeth are very white. They also use the makeup to make their eyebrows look wide, and their noses long.”
Harry stood up and crept toward the door. He listened for the sound of approaching footsteps, but when he heard nothing, he stepped out into a sparse hallway with grey walls. There were a few doors to the left, with light coming from underneath one of them—that must be the washroom. To the right was the only personal touch he’d seen in this flat so far—Draco’s broom, which was leaning against the wall next to the front door. It was the same broom he’d brought on their second date, a sleek Nimbus 3000. The competition from that afternoon had brought back a feeling of excitement that Harry hadn’t felt since Hogwarts. There had always been a unique thrill in challenging Draco, whether it was on the pitch during a game of Quidditch, or in the halls of Hogwarts as they taunted each other mercilessly.
nice. I don’t know much about him, but we always seem to be up for the same parts.
“Harry,” he said, putting his spoon down. “I need to make it clear that I can’t be your Healer. I don’t take general appointments to start with, but it’s also strictly unethical to date a patient. You really should register with a different General Healer.”
been fantasizing about them getting married earlier, but even he knew that realistically, it was going to be awkward. Not wanting to make it worse, however, he shuffled into the room and set his bag down on an armchair by the window. It turned out Harry hadn’t changed most of the furniture in here. The linens and decor were all new, and at first glance the room looked very different, but Draco recognised the simple bed and wardrobe they’d share all those years ago.
“Thank you for your outrage, Harry,” Draco said once they were seated again. “It’s rare that people are on my side in this situation. But please don’t worry about me, I’m used to it. The important thing is that I’m here to help my patients, and that alone brings me enough joy to ignore the rest.”
It was partly the department’s fault too. Who in their right mind would put an intern in charge of Alternate Entrance Management with no direct supervision? Those were complicated spells for even the most brilliant Charms scholars—nothing a child should be trifling with.
“Um, it’s really hectic here at work, and I don’t think I’ll be able to get away for lunch today. I spoke to Teddy, but he has the same problem.”
He wasn’t quite sure how to explain that to his friends, though. Sometimes he thought about just getting it over with and finding someone to go out on a date with. But there was something holding him back that he couldn’t quite pinpoint .
Scorpius nodded, reaching forward and pulling his dad into a hug. As upset as they all were, Scorpius knew as he made his way down to the floo, that things were going to be alright.
.” The girls’ eyes all widened comically; Pansy actually spat out her water.
"Look Papa! Harry got me a reindeer plushie! He said his friend got to pet a real live one! A real live reindeer, Papa!" Draco smiled down at his son, but the smile was replaced with a frown as Scorpius continued.
“I have some work for you, since you’re clearly not busy.”
“Looks like he tastes better than the last arse I had to impersonate.”
“His journal. I didn’t realise its significance at first. I was just drawn to it because it was something of his. They were words he’d written, thoughts he’d had. The journal centered around a recipe for Polyjuice Potion. It had been catalogued as evidence that Papa had brewed the potion.”
Draco grinned, slinging an arm around Harry’s shoulder and pulling him close.
Draco prided himself on being eloquent and composed in all his dealings, but somehow, the pointed look that McGonagall gave him made him feel like an awkward teenager once more.
“I don’t understand. When would this not have been a real relationship?”
Harry moved up to the reception desk, the returned letter he’d sent the night before clutched tightly in his hands.
“I’m generally not supposed to talk about it. But I’m sure I can trust you.” Malfoy cracked the surface of the dessert, taking a small bite before continuing.
Three-dozen spectators watched as Draco arched back in his chair, tore his shirt up out of his trousers, unbuckled his belt like a horny eighth year, unbuttoned his trousers, and shoved both hands into his pants.
“My point exactly.”
The portion of Silverthorn’s statement that was submitted into evidence ended just as he was leaving the office, where the story was picked up in the interview with the Minister’s secretary. Having already read that, Scorpius again started to focus on the Wizengamot members rather than the case itself. A lot of them were taking notes of the evidence being presented, which told Scorpius that they were actually interested. He’d seen too many trials where the court paid no attention to the case, and it never ended well for the defendant.
"Scorpius, that's a very personal question," Draco said patiently. He turned to look apologetically at Harry, who shrugged.
“Why would I be jealous of you when I’ve got Dean?” Seamus laughed.
Harry nodded before getting up to look for the salt and pepper. He peeked into the fridge again on his way back to his seat, and was glad to find some cheddar as well.
“This isn’t properly filled,” Harry said, feeling more and more annoyed with every moment. He’d been leaning over to ask if she had anything to wipe the side of the bowl with, when he’d noticed that she hadn’t even given Draco a full serving. The man worked long and hard hours—a half bowl of soup wasn’t going to be enough to sustain him.
Harry wondered if Draco actually knew what Luna was talking about, or if he was just humouring her. He glanced at Hermione, hoping for a clue—if Flinitores were real, she’d know what they were talking about. She seemed just as confused as Harry, however.
As predicted, the
Mr. Taber was still roaring with laughter at their realisation.
The afternoon was a whirlwind of activity. He was surprised to find that the old Malfoy vaults
“Draco, we’ve been over this. Please, call me Minerva.”
“Dad.” His voice suddenly sounded stronger, and more alert. Harry’s heart clenched a little at the fact that his son was feeling defensive around him.
“Oh, you don’t have to do that,” Draco said hurriedly. “I wouldn’t want to spoil your evening.”
"He want to know how he can trust you," she sighed, looking a little resigned. Harry stared back, unsure how he was supposed to prove such a thing.
Draco didn’t respond, still staring at the bubbling cauldron.
Anyway, if you wanted to see about having a go with him, I understand if you’d rather not complicate things by being seen with me again.
Harry shook his head, grinning wickedly. “Come on, tell me. Did you find the one neat guy in all of America and scoop him up?”
“Fine. Follow me.” Relieved that his plan seemed to be working, Harry followed Malfoy up to the third floor. He wasn’t at all surprised to see the plaque pointing out the Potions and Plant Poisoning ward—Malfoy had always been skilled at potions. What did surprise him, however, was that they didn’t stop at the ward, but kept walking in another direction. There were no signs indicating what the rooms in this corridor were for, and they only passed one person before Malfoy led him into a small examination room. Harry tried not to let his disappointment show—he’d been hoping they would go to Malfoy’s office, but he figured an examination room made sense.
“I don’t know if sorcerer is quite the right word. But I think a solution might be forming itself.”
"I am taking you to participate in the Gherewol."
“But you can now?”
“What? Really? There’s no way.”
“You can’t know that for sure,” Harry groused.
Draco couldn’t help smiling as he thought about their dinner a few nights prior. It had been fairly obvious that Harry was suspicious of him, especially considering how many questions he had asked about Draco’s work. He’d spent most of the evening talking in circles around his profession, hoping to misdirect Harry’s attention. He’d done his best not to lie directly to his date; as natural as it was for him sometimes, Draco wasn’t a fan of lying. It
“They still don’t know who did it, do they?”
He'd picked them up at the portkey station, realising that if the love spoons were for marriage proposals, he'd better not give one to Draco. He'd still given them to Hermione and Ron, which led to them having a hearty laugh at his expense about the mess he'd gone and gotten himself into, but didn't think he was close enough to Draco for that.
Harry missed the rest of the talk distracted by the thought of humans recreating the magic of true love that dragons lived by. He vaguely remembered Slughorn telling them in their sixth year that no potion could create true love—they were all cheap imitations, meant to cause infatuation only. He also knew that soul matching bonds were more trouble than they were worth, and therefore very uncommon. Despite being such a natural process for dragons, it seemed humans had no way of identifying who their true love was. Was that his fate too? Was he destined to spend the rest of his life
Harry bit his lip. Bryan grew up in New York. He couldn't possibly know...
"Wash," he said, pointing at Harry's towel. Taking it to mean that he needed to shower, Harry sighed, grabbing his things and slouching into the washroom. As he was showering, he realised that his host had probably brought the formal robes for him, which mean they were taking him to some kind of formal event. With a sigh, he shot a shaving charm at his face, before returning to his room. Camilla's father was sitting on his bed next to the robes, humming happily to himself.
Draco glared at the potion he’d been brewing for two weeks. He knew Harry was already getting suspicious of his absences.
“Why would anyone want to Transfigure someone else into an animal?”
That sounded odd to Harry. Charles hadn’t even seemed to know what Malfoy’s specialisation was. The poor receptionist looked suitably chastised and apologised quickly.
“Zacharias Smith, Magical Games and Sports,” he said, offering Scorpius his hand. Scorpius’ jaw dropped as he remembered where he’d heard this man’s name before.
"For example, we still play sports with them. Many witches and wizards in Chad enjoy football and traditional wrestling. The confederation of wizards told youngsters not to participate in the sports with moldus, because they worried that they would cheat with magic. But it is commonly accepted that magic is not to be used while playing games here. The only magical game is duelling, but it is not popular."
“Harry, he can’t hear me! He’s too far on the other side of the pit,” Scorpius whined. He tried calling his father again, but to no avail. The sounds of the other families were covering up any chance Scorpius had of drawing his father’s attention from so far away.
"Oh no. What is it?"
"To be fair, I generally favour a darker green, but I appreciate the help, Scorpius," Draco said diplomatically. "I know Harry's buying a new apartment, maybe he can hire you for your decorating services someday too."
The receptionist was silent for a moment. “Did you mention something about Spell Damage?”
"Kroom-ka-kay?" he repeated, unsure of his pronounciation. She laughed, but didn't bother to correct him, instead shaking the box in his face. Laughing with her, he took one and bit into it. It was delicious. The cone tasted similar to a waffle ice cream cone from Fortescue’s, and was filled with a delicious cream filling.
“Malfoy, what are you talking about?!”
“Well, we don’t know for sure why Pertinger’s daughter was targeted. But Goldhorn brought up an interesting point when I was chatting with him yesterday. He said being turned into a creature made him think of the recent decision to cut funding to the Department for the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures. But that department is so big—who could possibly have taken such offence to the reduction in funding?”
Teddy nodded, then turned his attention back to the wireless, just as Puddlemere scored another goal. They didn’t speak anymore of Draco that night, but Scorpius still had thoughts of his father racing around in the back of his mind as he climbed into bed. He had to know
Scorpius tried not to react at the mention of his dad, but his papa pushed on.
"Okay. I'll need her contact information; floo address, owl address, and the apparition coordinates for her house. Does she have any assets?"
“Well, the thing is… um, Papa can’t… y’know…” Scorpius trailed off, trying to gauge his dad’s reaction. Surprisingly, Harry prompted him to continue.
“Why is everyone so intent on telling me I can’t? I can be good with children!”
Harry’s jaw dropped. He stared at Draco, waiting for him to laugh and claim that he’d been pulling Harry’s leg, but when he didn’t, a little bubble of laughter errupted from Harry anyway.
“He modified the potion to thwart them!” Scorpius exclaimed suddenly. “Silverthorn started transforming back into himself before making it out of the Minister’s office. I thought it had been some kind of miscalculation, but Papa must have done it on purpose, so that Silverthorn would be caught!”
Teddy had returned just as his papa had finished explaining what happened, confirming that he’d explained things to Harry, who had said he wanted some time alone. Scorpius had managed to wait exactly four hours and thirty-seven minutes before racing into the floo, hoping to talk to his dad.
Surprised at this new concept, yours truly decided to do some research. Renowned mind healer and researcher Cletus Rook, confirmed that asexuality is something he's seen before. "It's not common," he said thoughtfully, "but we don't know much about it, or why it happens. I've had students propose research projects to look into it, see if it's some kind of neurological defect, or the result of some kind of blood curse. The weird thing is that it's been mentioned in muggle healing literature as well, though bless their souls, they do their best to be optimistic and complimentary about everything, so they've just chalked it up to an identity and a natural occurrence. They're very nit-picky about their definitions too; to them it's the fact of not being attracted to people in general, rather than just not wanting sex. Either way, they're quite limited in their understanding of the human body. I don't know how it can be considered natural for a young, healthy man to not want sex."
“Oh, shut up!” Harry groaned as everyone else started laughing again.
“I, uh... well, I’ve been feeling a little itchy… um, down there,” Harry mumbled. He’d rehearsed the lie in his head while waiting in line downstairs and decided that sounding hesitant would make it more convincing.
what you signed up for, so I swear on my honour as a gentleman if you find time this afternoon to accompany me to lunch, I will refrain from assaulting you.
Draco stared at him for a moment.
“You’re welcome to leave a note for him if you want?” she suggested. “I can give it to his department.”
"Okay, your idea of finding food before your lawyer gets here is getting appealing," Bryan said after a moment. "Maybe we could, um, share the shower? You know, to save time and such."
He looked up as Draco walked back into the room. His tie had been loosened and he was no longer wearing shoes—Harry smiled at the sight of little Nifflers dotting Draco’s dark blue socks. Despite his relaxed look, Draco was still devastatingly attractive, and Harry couldn’t help admiring his long legs as he walked over to the bar cart in the corner.
Harry nodded. “I know, and I know you don’t have time to look up and try new recipes. That’s why I wanted to help. He seemed to enjoy the soup yesterday.”
“Yeah! Harry let me go on the water slide again, and again, and again, and again!”
“Perhaps one day. For now, the lodgings at the castle will be enough, I’m sure. If today’s students are anything like you were, I’m sure I won’t be having much free time anyway.”
Scorpius suddenly realised his dad had left to avoid a conversation about Draco. In fact, he’d neatly avoided mentioning his ex-husband earlier, when Scorpius had asked if he’d played little-league. He felt a little guilty that his dad was feeling uncomfortable, but now he and Teddy were alone in the sitting room and he could ask whatever he wanted.
“Harry! You’re alive!” Joel called, eliciting a smattering of laughter from the group.
“Thank you for being such good sports, gentlemen,” the host said quietly. “The only other volunteers were in the back, and I’d rather not leave children unattended where we can’t see them from the stage.”
“You barely spoke after I mentioned that Malfoy healed that girl,” Ron insisted.
“Harry! Thank you for the kite!” Scorpius called as Harry walked into the waiting room. Harry’s mood instantly brightened at the sight of him.
“I would,” Harry said simply, setting a bowl of hot soup on the island and turning back for the other. “If you asked now,” he added at the incredulous look on Draco’s face. “I’ll admit that I was pretty angry at first.”
“I think you might have confused a couple of words there,” Draco pointed out. “Epigeneology is a thing, but it’s not common at St Mungo’s. Generally, when a word has the suffix ‘-ology’, it means the study of something. For example, Magizoology is the study of magical creatures. Healing classifies a lot of disciplines this way such as physiology, which is the study of how humans bodies function, or psychology which deals with mental processes. As Healers, we apply these fields of study to diagnose and heal our patients.”
“And for the love of Merlin, please tell Harry how you feel about him.”
It seemed to pay off today, however, as he heard graceful footsteps approaching at the far end of the hallway. Harry squeezed himself up against the wall and held his breath as they got closer. The hallway was quite wide, but it was a leftover instinct from his Hogwarts days.
Deciding to ignore the personal notes for the time being, Scorpius spent the morning transcribing the potions instructions and the random numbers onto separate parchments. He was hoping to stop by Teddy’s office during his lunch break—his cousin was Head of the Ministry potion’s lab, and was bound to understand what the modifications to the original recipe would do. Scorpius couldn’t show him the actual book though, since Teddy couldn’t be called in as a consultant on a case that was technically closed.
“Puzzles have always been Ron’s strong suit,” Hermione said fondly. “Though he’s not patient like you.”
Wallackson court was an old wizarding community, full of beautiful homes. They weren’t quite as large as the Manor his family had used to own—he’d seen many pictures of it—but they were still grand, and probably worth a small fortune. Many of his colleagues joked that these days, homes like that were unaffordable to young professionals, and that the only way they’d ever own one was by inheriting the house or the money for the house. Scorpius often laughed along with them, feeling a little guilty that he had more than a sizable inheritance, seeing as his dad had no one else to leave the Potter fortune too. Teddy was set to receive the Black fortune when he turned 30—they had all decided it was easiest, since he was the oldest Black heir, and the magic around that vault and the house that came with it was finicky—and thus Scorpius would get the Potter vault, also when he turned 30. It seemed like forever to wait before he could call himself a millionaire (Merlin, was his dad really a millionaire?) but he knew most people didn’t get that much money over the course of a lifetime, and that he should be grateful for the opportunity.
“I’ll be better when you leave, knowing you’ll never talk to my son again,” Harry said coldly. Scorpius usually hated using his dad’s fame to get his way, but he had to admit that there were times when it came in handy. He watched with a smug smile as Smith mumbled something incoherent, before slinking out of the office.
“It’s fine, Harry,” Draco said calmly, putting his folder down on the table.
“I thought I was supposed to buy your wand,” Millicent mused. “Where did you get the money for it?”
His dad gave him a small smile. “Don’t worry, you won’t be sent out to arrest me for being drunk and disorderly in public or anything like that. I only did it because there was a war happening. A war that’s been over since before you were born, so please promise me you won’t get mixed up in any leftover tensions from it?”
“It has been fairly quiet. But I’ve been keeping busy—drinks at the Leaky every Wednesday with the Gobstones club, and supporting little-league Quodpot in the park every Sunday. I used to coach them, but my body just isn’t what it used to be anymore. So now I just sit in the stands, cheering them on and bringing snacks to their big games. I’ve been involved with the league for so long that some of the players are children of the players I used to coach.”
"Oh." She hesitated for a moment. "Oslo is nice. Is a big city. Many people. Lots of things to see."
“I did. I have the training of a Healer, and I admittedly do a lot of the same work as them. But in reality...” He hesitated, before chiding himself for being so cowardly. “I’m an Unspeakable. I was assigned to St Mungo’s, as a spy of sorts, to be able to keep an eye on what was happening there and manage very high profile or complex cases.”
Shaking himself out of his thoughts, he marched over to the floo and called his dad, telling him Teddy was unwell and Scorpius was sending him home. Harry seemed thrilled at the idea of having his godson over for the day, and even passed Scorpius a bag of Liquorice Wands to replace the Pepper Imps. After ending the connection on the floo call, Scorpius sat down to work again. Unfortunately, in the two days he’d been manning the emergency floo, two new cases had landed on his desk. He scowled at them, before putting the journal back in it’s locked drawer and turning his attention to the one marked “priority 2” which meant it was important, but not drop-everything-and-take-a-whole-raid-team urgent.
“Not exactly. It’s kind of… behind them?”
"No. Not married. Going home. Good night Harree."
“Well what department is he in? I can just go up and ask myself.”
“As if you would know what being married is like,” Agent Phi grumbled, putting an arm around Agent Eta’s waist. Agent Eta smiled at Agent Phi, and the display of affection made Agent Delta’s heart swell. They couldn’t begin to describe the feeling of relief now that they were free to do the same.
“You didn’t. Before I adopted you, you were raised in relative poverty. There wasn’t enough money for a training broom, or the registration fees. By the time I met you, you were just on the verge of being too old for little-league, so I just taught you myself.”
“Yeah. Oh, look at me, whining about my problems before the drinks have even arrived. How have you been?”
Harry cut him off with a gentle wave of his hand. As nice as he had been, Harry didn’t plan on remaining in contact with Hassan. He didn’t really mind what the man thought of him.
Oh. So that's why she had seemed sad that he was leaving—because she thought she had to leave with him.
They placed their orders, before Scorpius went back to nodding sympathetically as Teddy complained about how much he hated the management aspect of his job.
“Harry!” Scorpius whined. “I was watching that!”
"Tired?" she asked, and he nodded. Hand in hand, they made their way back to the house, Harry enjoying the peace and quiet. He couldn't help feeling a little guilty—this community had welcomed him so openly, and yet he was probably going to have to head back soon. The large gathering had reminded him of Weasley family parties, which had left a little bit of an ache in his stomach. Travelling was nice and all, but he was starting to feel that it might be time to go home soon.
“I never met your mother, but your father was a piece of work. I don’t blame you for changing your name, even I would want to run away from having that scum family’s history. Though you’re clearly just as disrespectful. In fact, I don’t know why Penelope hired someone like you, you—”
“She’s a great Auror and an even better boss,” Scorpius said loudly. “And yeah, I’ll take that emergency shift, no problem. After all, us Aurors, we’re all a team, and we’ve gotta support each other. In fact, I think I’ll even pop by St. Mungo’s and ask Merle how her spattergroit treatment is coming along.”
Head Auror Clearwater nodded, her face set. “No, we can’t. I think we can reopen the case on the grounds that Draco didn’t have legal representation the first time around, and that there was uncataloged evidence. But you’re going to have to prove that he actively worked to thwart the criminals he was working with.”
“It’s not an appointment, really. It’s a pretty personal situation that I need to see him for.”
“It sounds like this might be a sexually transmitted infection. Have your recent partner or partners been tested lately? Do you employ protection spells, or Muggle protection?”
“It’s alright,” Luna said kindly. “They’re already dispersing. Clearly everyone can already see that you’re a good match.”
“Everyone is surprised at my presence?” Draco muttered, turning to glare at Harry. “You said you told them!”
Harry shook his head. “I’m never really alone on these trips. I always find someone to make friends with.”
Harry nodded, reaching over to place the glass on the coffee table.
Over the course of the next couple of weeks, Harry met Camilla quite regularly. Sometimes he'd meet her in the market, and she would show him all kinds of lovely spots for lunch. Sometimes he'd take her out to dinner, always inviting her parents along, though now that they seemed to trust him, they didn't usually accept the invitation. One time she'd even taken him to a fesitval where they'd listened to lively music while munching on the Norwegian equivalent of a hot dog, washed down with beer.
Draco read the letter over twice more, wondering why he felt so sad at the thought that Harry was gone. He chalked it up to the thought of being sad that this week was over. He couldn't believe how much had happened in the last seven days. He'd been wary about this at first, but despite the few rough days, he had to admit that he was in a much better place than when he'd started. Sure, he still had to go back to his horrible apartment, but now that he would be working for Millicent, it wouldn't be long before he could afford a better place. And if he was going to get a wand, it would go a long way toward making the place liveable until he could leave.
The Head Auror frowned at this man, who was wearing an unnecessarily formal set of robes, the effect of which was ruined entirely by the stain on his tie. He turned to Scorpius, who had to make a conscious effort not to recoil at the sleazy air this man was giving off.
talk to him about it.
“Is this about Harry?” she asked gently. Realising he could no longer shove the issue aside, Draco took a deep breath and nodded. He took his hand back, and wiped his eyes.
“My room is almost as clean as yours!” Bryan pointed out. “And at least I don’t sleep until one in the afternoon every day.”
“No worries, Scorp. That’s why your personal Harry-train is here to carry you!”
“I… that wasn’t… I wasn’t
Oh what a show for Peevsy,
“What, should I go up to the front of the room and make an announcement?” Harry teased.
Harry bit his lip. He’d definitely missed that part of the conversation.
“Harry and Draco, sitting in a tree!” Seamus started singing. “K-I-S-S-”
“Oh, that’s good,” Harry admitted. Pleased, Bryan kept offering him bites of it in between inhaling all the ice cream he’d selected. Harry couldn’t help noticing that it was a rather intimate thing to do, but considering how delicious the cake was, he couldn’t be arsed. The kids probably didn’t care anyway; he’d seen them offering each other bites of their food throughout his trip, as if it was a totally normal thing to do between friends. After all, what did he know about being normal?
It was a simple enough case, and after having lifted the magical signature of the thief and taken down a detailed description of the heirloom, he was able to be back in the office within half an hour. Another half an hour later, the magical signature was submitted to the forensics lab, the item description had been given to the rare artefacts lab, and his reports were complete. With a relieved sigh, he pulled out his father’s old journal once more.
“Are you okay?” he asked softly. Bryan just shrugged, reaching over to sign the receipt the receptionist handed him.
Harry couldn’t help but smile at that. It had always been clear that Draco was a wonderful father, but this trip had served to show him exactly how close the relationship between the two Malfoys really was.
“What about your friends?” Harry asked innocently. “When can I meet them?”
“But I can’t—oh.” Draco was so absorbed in his thoughts about the case that it took him a moment to realise McGonagall was right—the patient’s magical core hadn’t caused the issue, so theoretically, Transfiguring her should work.
“You look great,” he said, giving his date a reassuring smile. “I’m excited for you to meet my friends.”
“Malfoy, I—”
"Okay. Let me see what I can do, I'll keep you updated."
"Thanks, Draco," Harry said, getting up from his seat and shaking his hand. "This is the second time you're saving my arse."
Draco shook his head. “I meant, well you wouldn’t have come to help
“So you’re saying I should send them to greasy burger joints all the time?”
He was just admiring the intricate woodwork that decorated the church, when Camilla tugged at his hand and pulled him to the front.
Harry nodded for his son to go on.
Many hours and a few hand cramps later, Scorpius made his way down to the labs. He spotted his cousin’s teal blue hair right away, and was surprised to see him playing with a paddle ball in his office.
Agent Delta scowled at the news. Agent Eta was married to Agent Phi, and not as part of a mission either—they actually fancied each other. It was a rare occurrence for agents to get on like that, but it seemed to work for them... so far.
how ridiculous their content can be sometimes. It's exhausting, and even worse is trying to find someone who's willing to
“He didn’t seem to want to talk about it. But whatever happened, it seemed intense. I just wanted to make sure you were okay.”
“That’s the same dragon we were smuggling out of the castle in our first year,” Harry said, pointing up at the replica.
This new information was still at the forefront of Harry’s mind as he got up to head home for the night. He wished everyone a distracted goodbye and already had one foot out the door when Ron and Hermione caught up to him.
“Well, I should—oh, sorry was there something else?” He turned back to face Harry, who was now mortified to be frozen with his arms halfway up in what was clearly an aborted hug.
“No, that’s not what I meant. Stay here, in America, with me. I was planning to go to San Francisco tomorrow, you should come with me.”
Harry got off the train and made it to his hotel in record time, stopping only to wash his face, put on a fresh pair of clothes, and grab one of the spoons from his suitcase, before racing into the village towards Camilla’s home. He paused outside the oor to catch his breath for a moment, and then knocked cheerfully. The door swung open to reveal her mother in a beautifully embroidered apron.
“I thought we could visit the American Museum of Dragonology and Creature Heritage. They supposedly have a dragon reserve somewhere up in the state of Washington, but I figured just the museum might be enough for us.”
"So, I forgot that I was supposed to go to Oslo tomorrow," he said sheepishly.
“Actually, we kind of only have seven months,” Draco mumbled sheepishly, surreptitiously moving his hand to cover his abdomen. This hadn’t been how he was planning to tell Harry, but he’d been so excited at the idea that he might write revolutionary books for children, and the conversation had not ended up where he’d wanted it to go at all.
tomorrow anyway. There was an attack at the house of a Wizengamot member.”
She stared at him for a moment, struggling to believe the generous offer.
"I don't think so, Scorpius. The egg is fossilized."
Draco closed the book and slid it back to the wizard, but not before admiring his own book cover.
“I assure you, I am no such thing anymore. Muggle brands are less delicate on the skin simply because Muggles cannot weave charms into the tissue. If you’re willing to be cheap about it, I’m sure you could find equally abrasive magical brands.”
Agent Delta snorted. “Not your problem.”
He was just wondering if he could shove this off on someone from magical creatures, or an MLE intern, when Olivia came up to him, looking anxious.
On this night of summer stars
Draco suddenly understood. Harry was worried about their relationship.
“Greengrass!” They all jumped at the sound of Head Auror Clearwater’s commanding voice. “I just wanted to tell you to take the rest of the day off if you need it,” she said. “Spend it with your father.”
“No, of course we can tell your friends. I’m sure a pub night will be lovely.”
“I've missed you too. Teddy and Harry as well, but you were definitely the one I thought about most.”
"Yes please," Harry sighed, relieved that everything seemed so easy. He grabbed an unfamiliar pair of pants from the corner of the bed and tossed them to Bryan. His friend—boyfriend? lover?—stood up and put them on. Harry watched as he made his way around the bed, and then flinched as Bryan slipped on something and crashed onto the bed.
“Papa where does this door go? Hello, anyone home?” he called, knocking on the door that connected the two suites.
“Well if you like the farmhouse theme, I don’t think it really matters where you have it. I eventually learned that it takes time to develop your own style. You just kinda collect pieces that you love until one day it suddenly hits you that this is home.”
“I don’t have long, so yes, that’s a good idea.” He turned toward the lunch counter, and Harry was about to follow, when Draco stopped.
“I think I know you well enough that those things won’t be necessary, Draco. For paperwork’s sake, send me your resume, and I’ll write down this meeting as our interview. Poppy said it would be ideal if you could start sooner rather than later so that she has ample time to show you everything.”
"Why do you have a new apartment?" Scorpius asked.
Malfoy nodded. “You have your own way of helping people just like I have mine. If everyone who wanted a career where they could help people became a Healer, a lot of them would quit very quickly.”
With one last hug goodbye, Harry made his way into the airport, paid for the next flight to London and settled into the lounge to wait. The flight was uneventful, and he managed to sleep through most of it, his worries about his new marriage having been eased a bit by what Hassan said. He’d made it all the way home, unpacked, and even sent an owl to Priscillia requesting another appointment, before one of his biggest worries finally hit him in the face:
“Yes. He was Transfigured into an Occamy, in the middle of a large parlour. Having no control over his modified body, he grew to fit the room, as a normal Occamy would. Apparently the Aurors had a field day bringing him in.”
As they stepped through the brass doors leading into the dragon history wing, they were greeted by a huge replica of a young Norwegian Ridgeback suspended over the hallway. Harry was reminded of Norberta and couldn’t help nudging Draco as Scorpius ran off to look at a display of a fossilized egg.
“Though it makes a lot of sense in hindsight,” Hermione added.
“That’s interesting. Most Healers usually say something about wanting to help people, or that it pays well.”
"Nydelig!" she suggested, and even though Harry had no idea whether it was the right word or not, he agreed. It seemed to be correct though, because she looked very pleased with herself and settled down next to him, helping herself to a krumkake as well.
"My name is Marissa," she offered. "I work here in the museum as a magical historian."
“Thank you for inviting us on this trip, Harry,” Draco said, once the Telly had been switched off. “I’ve always wanted to give Scorpius experiences like this, but it’s difficult as a single parent. I can’t help wondering if I’m holding him back.”
Deciding that he was missing some crucial information, Scorpius realised it was time to look at Charles Silverthorn’s case file and piece together exactly what had happened in the plot to murder the Minister.
“Well, I know he was Healing a patient who had been Transfigured. And he’s a supervisor, right?”
“I don’t believe that’s a muggle device. It’s hypnotizing.”
“No buts, Harry!” Hermione cut him off. “I don’t know what else I can do to get you to stop this obsession with Mysteries. Do you know how long it took me to convince Magical Maintenance to increase the temperature in that hallway to such an unbearable level? They hate doing anything that’ll piss of Mysteries. And yet that still didn’t deter you!”
Potter,
But one look at Draco’s face reminded Harry how exhausted his host must be. That was why they were here, after all, because Draco had seemed ill at the gala. If Harry truly trusted Draco, he’d leave him to get some rest, rather than imposing on him just for a chance to search his office.
After a little tussle with Camilla's father over who would pay the bill, and a short walk to accompany them all home, Harry said goodnight to the little family, feeling satisfied in a way that he didn't quite think was due to the food.
Harry grinned at that—he definitely was. And it felt
"Yeah, she said you have one a few doors down from mine. It should be keyed to your magical signature, so you can just go right up."
Draco looked up from the form he was filling out when an owl tapped on the window of his St Mungo’s office. He waved his wand to open it and the owl landed neatly on his desk. He untied the letter and offered the owl a treat, wondering if it could sense the magic that had brought it from the sixth floor of the hospital to the bowels of the Ministry.
“No way!”
As had been the case with their first date, the conversation was surprisingly pleasant and easy. They meandered their way through a farmer’s market, down a bustling street not unlike Diagon Alley, and finally decided to sit on a patio outside the local coffee shop, chatting all the while. It wasn’t until Draco started lecturing him about how unhealthy the sugary syrups in Harry’s blended drink were that Harry remembered why they were there in the first place—he was supposed to be keeping an eye on Draco.
“But you were just copying your friend’s house! You said so!”
home. It made sense to him. Harry had been angry, and even if he hadn’t, it had been 15 years. The place was bound to get updated eventually.
Malfoy snorted. “I don’t know which Healers you’ve spoken to recently, but it takes a while to gain the type of seniority that pays well. As for helping people, I’m sure everyone has that innate desire to make the world a better place. Training to become a Healer, and then actually doing the job, is difficult. You have to have more than a sense of decency to motivate you.”
“The case has been solved,” Agent Eta reminded him. “And he’s no longer sneaking around trying to catch you out. You said the relationship was strictly for professional purposes. There’s no need for it now.”
“...and so, Mr. Malfoy is now free to go. Court adjourned.”
“No wonder you guys are so pale,” Harry teased. He was glad to see Draco smile at that, though it didn’t last long.
“Yeah. The most unexpected part of this whole story, however, is that she’s started liking Hassan, and he likes her back. They’ve already started dating, and he told me he thinks she might be the one for him.”
“Do you want him in Azkaban because of his crimes, or because he hurt you?” Teddy asked. There was no malice in his tone, but Harry still felt as if Teddy had crucioed him.
“Thank you for talking to me, Dad,” he said gently. His dad nodded, pulling the blankets tightly around him and leaning his head against one of the pillows.
Harry nodded. “Me too. It seems I never get outside these days. I guess it doesn’t help that the Ministry is underground.”
"Well, I'm going on vacation," Harry said quickly, not wanting to break Scorpius' heart and explain that his divorce was now final. "How about I bring you back a souvenir?"
“You used to be an Auror,” he stated, realising with a shock that this was the man who had been in charge of his father’s case. His distaste for him multiplied instantly. Unfortunately, Smith didn’t realise that Scorpius absolutely didn’t like him, and seemed to take immense pride in being recognised.
“And the consequence would probably have been you suffering a serious injury, if not killed.”
“Why don’t you finish dessert while I go settle this,” Malfoy suggested, already getting up from his chair.
married, silly. Remember, we are celebrating all day?" Her tone made it clear that all this was clearly an amusing joke to her, but something in Harry's mind suddenly clicked.
“You know a lot about the case for a Healer,” Harry pointed out.
“I wonder why the attacker is Transfiguring people into animals. It seems a weird way to get revenge on someone.”
Off to find my own bottle of Ogden's.
Draco nodded, and joined him. “Emmeril Goldhorn. We have to do a lot of his treatment while he’s asleep, because he won’t stop talking when he’s awake. Chatting with him has been interesting, though, he’s a very sharp guy. He’s in charge of the Ministry’s finances.”
Hermione closed her eyes and pinched the bridge of her nose.
The cafeteria witch slid the bowl aggressively across the counter, which caused some of it to splash over the side. Draco didn’t say anything about it, instead reaching into his pocket and pulling out a couple of Galleons.
A moment later, the door to his room creaked open, and Camilla slipped in, still wearing her formal clothes, though her hair had been let down. She closed the door, then made her way over to the bed. Confused, Harry watched as she undid her zipper, and let the dress fall to the floor. She was just climbing onto the bed when his brain kicked in.
Harry didn’t sleep on the ride back to Hassan’s house - his mind was reeling with everything that had happened in their last few hours before leaving the tribe behind. He couldn’t help worrying that he’d really made a mess of things this time. Would they be okay with Harry just leaving and getting divorced from that woman? Merlin, he didn’t even know her name! He knew logically that there was no way they could force him to go back and live with her, but if she wouldn’t agree to divorce him, he might never be able to marry anyone else!
“I have to find something to prove all this, but Head Auror Clearwater said I can probably reopen the case if I do.”
Draco,
Just then, an owl tapped at the window. Agent Phi leaned over and let it in, accepting the missive that was clearly not for them.
Though Harry didn’t have a hope in the world of being able to follow the chanting, he mimicked the movements and facial expressions of the others. He’d been instructed to smile widely to show off his teeth. While it was awkward and a little tiring to hold his mouth open for so long, Harry found that the constant smiling was boosting his mood. It felt a little silly, but it was also fun and happy, and just made him want to smile even more.
Draco beamed with pride at that. After sitting together for a few more minutes, Draco finally got up with Scorpius nestled safely in his arms.
“Everyone thought that. The motive with this second attack isn’t very clear though. All I know is that the patient’s brother is an advocate for magical heritage spaces. But his organisation never made many enemies, so I—they’re not sure.”
"Yeah. I told them you weren't interested."
“You want us to join your vacation? But wasn’t the whole point of travelling to spend time on your own?”
“Don’t give me that look,” Agent Eta scolded. “Agent Phi’s partner was compromised. Someone needs to debrief their cases until they get a new partner.”
“Well, the thing about being a Healer is that regardless of any specialty or regular practice, all Healers are well versed in the various facets of Healing and medicine. Just like anyone else working at St Mungo’s, my skill set lies in everything from biomechanics to epigenetics, from endocrinology to pharmacology. Many people who knew me as a teenager tend to assume I work in potions, because of Snape’s mentorship, but overall my work lies in modern tertiary practice.”
Draco laughed. “Trust me, being in an above ground building does nothing to guarantee you get time outside every day.” He shrunk his broom and put it in his pocket, before nodding toward the small town just down the lane. “I’d love to take advantage of the nice weather today. Fancy a stroll through the village?”
“How old are you buddy?” the lifeguard asked, peering at Scorpius. Scorpius puffed out his chest, announcing proudly that he was five years and seven months old. Harry couldn’t help smiling at that, though the smile quickly disappeared when he realised the lifeguard was biting his lip.
“I’m guessing they don’t know about our recent dates?”
“The man took an emergency portkey around the world with his son in tow to help you file a few papers that I’m sure he could have just mailed to us. The way he was talking about you, he really knows you, and he cares a lot too.”
“It’s a rather high-profile case, isn’t it? It was all over the
Please tell me I'm right. I hate these things. And not just because the press seems to have a sixth sense for when
"Of course," Harry smiled, unsure why she was so surprised with a wooden spoon. Suddenly, she turned to her mother, chattering away excitedly and showing her the gift. Her mother's reaction was very similar to Camilla's and soon the two of them were speaking excitedly, and Harry had no idea what could possibly be going on.
“They seem very familiar with each other,” his papa said. Scorpius nodded, stepping forward to claim the chair Teddy had just vacated.
that I’ve seen in you recently is your habit of looking for trouble by once again skulking about on the ninth floor.”
Harry and Penelope both laughed at that.
“Of course I do,” Harry replied easily. “I know we mostly meet because I keep needing to get divorced, but getting to know you over the past year or so has been nice. You’re very different from the bully I knew at school, and I enjoy chatting with you.”
Agent Delta hesitated. It was standard protocol to exchange plans and updates with Agent Eta, in case either one was ever compromised—that way the other could take over their assignments. But Agent Delta’s recent decision had been a little… unorthodox.
Harry’s heart was racing as he touched down at the edge of the park, Draco landing right behind him. They’d been flying for over an hour, racing each other around the grassy plains Harry had located on a map the night before. It had been ages since he’d flown like that and he couldn’t help grinning at Draco. Draco grinned back, waving his wand at his windswept hair to nudge it back into place.
“Well, I do know of this one pub...”
He just hoped he’d say yes.
Before Harry could so much as nod, Draco had already walked off towards the hostess station. Deciding he might as well listen to his date, he finished off the last couple of bites of cream before joining Draco out front. He was once again surprised when Draco held the door open for him.
“I’ve decided to become an author,” Draco announced.
A man cleared his throat, and Draco looked up, shoving his shirt back into his trousers.  Two wizards stood on the other side of his table, arms linked.  One rested a hand on a barely-there bump, and the other's mouth opened and shut like a beached fish.
“Are you going back because of your new patient? What’s his name again?” Harry asked, sitting down on a well worn couch.
“Well, if you’re confident you can visualise a whole and healthy child, I’m sure you could Transfigure her incomplete body into a whole and functioning one.”
Draco flapped his wings and ran to join Harry in the middle of the stage. Harry felt surprisingly reassured that Draco was back by his side.
Teddy laughed. “I’m waiting for my Billywig propellers to finish stewing, there’s not much I can do until they’re done. So yeah, I guess some work would help. What’s up?”
“You look confused,” Head Auror Clearwater said as she pulled up a chair in front of Scorpius. He sat back in his chair, his mind still racing with unanswered questions.
“I usually eat here,” Draco said, pointing at the island. It was like he’d read Harry’s mind.
“EEEEWWWYYY EW EW EW! Why are you guys
Harry nodded, and downed the last of his drink.
Hermione narrowed her eyes at him. “And just how much time have you spent stalking around in front of their door to know that?”
For the rest of the morning, Harry’s brain felt as chaotic as Scorpius’ office had sounded. His thoughts were racing with memories of Draco, interspersed with the little he knew about the man now. He’d never really thought about what Azkaban would be like before—his thoughts about Draco had always revolved around lamenting their lost marriage, and holding a grudge against his betrayal. But Scorpius’ descriptions of Draco’s health had forced Harry to realise that he’d been in prison for 15 years. He hadn’t eaten properly or felt warm in all that time, and he’d been so isolated. Had that changed Draco’s personality?
"Harry. How was your trip?" Harry looked up to see Draco stepping out of his office.
I have to be true to myself and admit that I really want the chance to get to know you better and see where this goes.
“We’ll see about that. Personally, I believe that you can get anything to give up if you’re stubborn enough.”
Aside from the ill-advised drinking game, I thought last night was great too. There are very few things in this world that I love more than messing with the press and all those high-society snobs. I have to admit, I thought you were one of them not too long ago, but last night definitely set me straight. You have a wicked sense of humour, and I find I can be relaxed around you too. Dancing with you, it was the first time I didn’t pulverise my dance partner’s toes by stepping on them. I’d love to accompany you to lunch today. If you think Ellen is insufferable, I can assure you, you don’t know Tom well enough. I definitely won’t be “having a go” with him anytime soon; I was just being polite because he said he knew you.
“I keep grousing about how I wish Draco had trusted me back then, how he should have told me the truth about what he was dealing with. But instead of learning from how I was feeling, I turned around and did the exact same thing to you. I should have trusted you with the information you wanted, especially as you got older.”
was the consequence of not completing the goal, or
Bryan merely shrugged. Harry couldn't help wondering why he was being so quiet all of a sudden. Still pondering the question, he gave Draco his plate and then sat down next to him. He was still a little sore from the night before, having forgotten to cast a healing charm after his shower, and winced lightly. Thankfully Scorpius was too engrossed with his sandwich to notice, but Draco picked up on it right away.
"Are you the only one in your family who knows English?" Harry asked her one evening as they sat in the yard, digesting another delicious dinner.
“There are
Draco’s eyes were suddenly filled with guilt.
"Okay, what's the problem?" Draco asked, popping another chocolate into his mouth and sitting up straight.
“You bet it is,” he chuckled.
,” Draco muttered. Harry shifted his attention to Draco, who was now picking up the bowl without flinching, though it was still very precariously balanced. If his hands shook too much, he’d probably spill it on his folder, or himself.
Draco had been alerted of the case because of how high-profile it was, which was lucky, because the magic here was incredibly complex—most Urgent Care Healers wouldn’t have been able to manage it. Even Draco could admit that he was struggling, and he was probably the most skilled at Transfiguration in the whole building. He needed to consult a true expert, but talking to the only one who would even deign to give him the time of day was a rather intimidating prospect.
“That’s admirable, Harry,” Draco said gently, rubbing his back. He needed to get to the hospital soon, but he didn’t want to leave Harry alone in this panicked state.
“If you find them, can you bring me back one? Papa says we can’t keep a dragon at home, but I’m sure he’d say yes if you brought it.”
“There was no love lost between us,” Harry said bitterly. He tried to change the subject.
He could have sworn he heard Harry laugh, but as soon as he looked up, Harry looked away.
“Oh, okay. Well I guess I’ll just…” he trailed off awkwardly, and seeing no more reason to delay, he made his way over to the floo.
“What’s on your mind?” Bryan asked, sitting down next to Harry on the edge of a fountain at their third hotel. Everyone else was taking pictures of brighty lit orbs hanging from the ceiling, but clearly Bryan had no interest in that.
“Thank you for bringing me home, Harry,” he said softly. Harry was about to reply that he was happy to do it, when Draco leaned forward and placed a soft kiss on his cheek. It was such a chaste gesture, but at the same time it was so intimate, that all Harry could do was choke out a strangled goodnight and escape into the Floo. The spinning sensation distracted him for a moment, but by the time he stepped onto his own hearth, he had to face one inescapable fact—he was definitely falling for Draco Malfoy.
Thankfully, the server chose that very moment to arrive with the food, and the prospect of dinner seemed to shatter the awkward silence. Camilla's father started explaining to Harry what each thing was, with his daughter translating dutifully, and her mother kept placing more food on his plate. Happily reminded of Molly, Harry let her serve him a little bit of everything, and ate it all without fuss. He wasn't surprised to find that the food was delicious. Camilla's parents were also wonderful company, once they opened up to him. They told him happy stories about their life in the village, and by the end of the night, he almost felt like he had grown up with this family and their adventures.
“He searched high and low, wide and far! Draco climbed mountains—Harry pretended to fly upwards—and he searched the valleys!—Harry made a swooping movement—He called out for Harry, but still, he couldn’t find his friend.”
“Beats me. I spent all morning trying to find some kind of pattern in them. I put them there in case you’re able to spot something.”
Harry nodded, sitting down at the top of the slide and crossing his arms the way the poster instructed.
At least one of his missions was working out. Wishing they could both be that easy, he turned his attention back to the Auror reports.
Fuck. Bloody-buggering-fuckity-fuck-fucking-bollocks. They were
"Pippy?" The elf popped up in front of him, eyes wide.
“Well, you can ask as many questions as you want while watching the Telly,” Harry explained. “And the people on the Telly can’t hear you, only the people you’re watching with can.”
“Because I…” Draco sighed, putting his book aside with shaky hands. “It’s complicated. Harry, I wanted to apologise, for—”
“That’s a big stereotype, assuming that only girls are neat, and all just to avoid my question. Who is that letter from?”
"It's almost noon," he said, once again surprised he'd slept so late.
Harry pushed his plate away, no longer in the mood to eat (not that the broccoli casserole was very appetizing to start with). He stared at the wooden grain of the island, unsure how to continue what he’d wanted to say. He heard Draco’s plate scrape against the wood too, and a moment later, Draco’s frail hand covered his. Taking comfort in the small gesture, Harry started to speak again.
Geoffrey seemed impressed by you, honestly Harry, I had no idea you knew so much about theatre. Not to mention your insights on
“That’s quite clever of you to have noticed that Scorpius.” Scorpius beamed at his father’s praise, and not for the first time, Harry found himself falling in love with the obvious adoration Draco showed his son. He was clearly an attentive father, always taking the time to explain things to Scorpius or to make sure he was comfortable. It was obvious that Draco was making an effort to ensure his son grew up without the same prejudices and ignorance he had, and Harry couldn’t help feeling so proud of that.
Teddy rolled his eyes.
Draco took his pyjamas and shuffled into the washroom to get ready for bed, the silence weighing heavily. Once he’d put his things away and the time came to actually get into bed, however, things started to feel more natural. Without having to talk about it, they both got in from their own sides of the bed, Harry tossing an extra throw blanket over Draco for warmth, before Draco spelled the lights out. They lay there in silence, listening to each others’ breathing, and Draco thought he could almost be lulled to sleep by the familiar sound, if it wasn’t for everything that was racing through his brain.
Draco nodded. “It’s very sudden; I was surprised that they would write on a Saturday, telling me to start on Monday. But they have student apartments right next to the school in which they’re offering me a small private room, and since I have the money now, I’d better do it.”
“Because the defendant was not provided council at his first trial.”
“Are you here with anyone?” Draco asked. He probably shouldn’t monopolise Harry’s time, even though he wanted to. Thankfully, Harry shook his head.
"Harree?" she asked cautiously. "You drink too much?"
The naughty boys are laughing,
Harry was never going to forgive him.
up to something!” he added, focusing once more on Draco. For some reason, everyone else burst out laughing at that.
“But you both have to tell me exactly where to look. It’s going to be awkward if I’m the only parent in there and you’re not even giving me directions.”
“I don’t know how much longer it would have taken to figure it out if Harry hadn’t known Selpie. He pieced it together last night, when I was telling him about the case.”
“And what exactly is this
“It is time for us to go, Harry,” Hassan said urgently, guiding him to where they had parked the car. They had just closed the door when the shouting seemed to get louder. Harry craned his neck to see the elder who had been arguing with Daneri storming toward the car, a young girl following behind him.
I hope you had a good night at work. I’m going to get some sleep now, and I imagine you want to do the same. Will you come over this evening? Let me know.
“No, I’m not,” Ron agreed. “Which is why I was relieved when they called Malfoy in. He may have been a git in school, but as soon as he showed up everything started moving so much more efficiently.”
Creations are posted anonymously during the posting period. The creators will be revealed on
Harry frowned at that. It sounded unnecessarily protective of Scorpius not to trust his father’s magic.
“What are all these numbers?” Teddy asked, peering at the margins.
No. As Harry continued to ponder the question, he became more certain that Scorpius had just never given him the address. The poor boy must have been quite stressed about the move to forget something as important as that. Harry understood, remembering his own fears about living alone for the first time as an adult.
Head Auror Clearwater nodded, finally putting the pictures down and looking up at him.
“He has very advanced arthritis. Azkaban is very cold, and damp. He’s been sleeping a lot since he was released. It’s only his physical strength that was affected, though. His mind is still wicked sharp. I bet you he and Teddy are arguing about potions theory right now.”
On this night of summer stars
Harry nodded along, intrigued. He hadn't played football since he was a little kid at primary school, and even then Dudley and his gang had often made sure that Harry got as little playing time as possible. Perhaps he could try it here?
especially if it fucks with Rita Skeeter.
“What do you mean?”
moved out, but now he was seeing it for what it really was.
Harry nodded, glancing around the open concept flat. His gaze landed on the sofa, and he knew what he had to say next.
divorced. They already thought he was old. At least he hadn’t told him that it had happened three times.
His eyebrow shot up as the footsteps rounded the corner and he recognised
Agent Delta had to bite back a scowl as Agent Eta gave them a pointed look from across the table. They couldn’t talk in such a noisy, crowded pub, but Agent Eta’s meaning was clear. This relationship was no longer necessary, and should be cut off immediately. It was a liability to the department, and, frankly, unfair to everyone involved. Agent Delta had always thought of themself as pragmatic, but here they were, sitting in the Leaky Cauldron trying to avoid Agent Eta’s unspoken reprimand.
Draco hesitated. “I don’t think her parents thought what happened was the ideal option, but it happened anyway. Your friend and his contact in the tribe helped her sneak away and travel to the city, where she was taken in by a grassroots organisation that works to empower women to be independent. They’re teaching her a few skills to make her employable and setting her up with businesses around the city that might want to hire her.”
As had become his habit the past few days, Draco turned to stare out the window, allowing his thoughts to drift. The sky behind the London skyline was a beautiful blue. He couldn’t help thinking that this would be a perfect day to go flying.
“Sounds like you’re just creating more bureaucracy,” Draco pointed out. “I would be so frustrated to have to record every piece of mail I send.”
“It always unsettles me when the
Ron shrugged. “I dunno, and honestly, I don’t care. Tomorrow I’m going to have to deal with the media storm, so tonight I just want to get sloshed. Cheers!”
His expression hardened as he continued talking. Scorpius could now see the anger Teddy and his Papa had mentioned.
“That’s awful, Harry.”
Scorpius shrugged. “Seems like it. A fat lot of good any of this does for me,” he grumbled.
“A what?”
Scorpius raised an eyebrow at her, though he remained silent when she continued talking.
“Well, nobody’s perfect,” Scorpius said with a shrug. “What’s his name?”
Draco nodded eagerly, surprised at how easily everything seemed to be falling into place. As he reached across the table and shook McGonagall’s hand, he couldn’t help thinking that it was about time.
Scorpius shivered at the thought. His dad was definitely not going to be happy about this. He glanced back at his papa, who was contemplating the crossword on the back of the evening Prophet. He looked so serene in that moment, and Scorpius wanted to protect him from ever feeling any kind of stress again. He’d have to find a flat, and quickly, if he wanted to be able to take care of his father.
As a consolation for the fact that this was his last day in the beautiful apartment, Draco let himself have a bit of a lie in, which led to him falling right back to sleep. When he woke up again, he was shocked to find that it was almost 10:30. He rolled out of bed and padded into the bathroom to get dressed, making it out to the hall in record time. There was an apology ready on his lips for Harry, but the man was nowhere to be found.
“Do you mind if I ask about what?” Draco pushed.
“Well, not exactly… I mean, you guys didn’t meet through an app or at a club!”
Harry nodded, feeling proud of his son for being so mature. It was at that moment that Draco returned from the floo, and after a series of goodbyes, and promises from Scorpius to come visit whenever he could, Harry took hold of Draco’s elbow and together, they stepped into the floo.
Scorpius laughed. “You know he’s happy to cook for you regardless of your health status. But yeah, I can floo call and tell him I’m sending you over for some TLC.”
“I did it one day!” Harry groaned. They continued to tease each other as Harry locked his room and they made their way to the main entrance to meet everyone else.
He was still thinking about his youth, and how different it could have been, when they were walking around after lunch, trying to work off all the food they’d consumed. Since it was too hot in the afternoon sun to walk outside for a long stretch, they kept ducking into hotels they passed, admiring the elaborate decorations and entertaining themes. While most of the group was taking pictures of all the sights, Harry was happy to just hang back and enjoy the view.
Harry sat down in the soft leather chair in front of Draco’s desk, watching as the man sighed heavily at the papers he was holding, and slipped them into a drawer next to him.
That made Agent Delta chuckle. “I’m pretty sure he is, actually. But this way I can control how much information he has rather than having him snoop around the hospital. I’ve already had to Confund two receptionists.”
“Harry, look, we have muggle things in our room!” Scorpius interrupted excitedly. “Look, Papa said this is a— a—”
Draco nodded. “There’s a lake near the castle. But there’s also a giant squid in the lake, and if you’re not careful, he might reach onto your boat and snatch your passengers!” Draco teased, snaking a hand up the side of the floating and tickling Scorpius’ foot. Scorpius squealed in delight and turned to Harry.
Harry stopped flapping his wings and sat down on the stage to show his sadness.
Harry shrugged. “I didn’t necessarily mean I wanted to date someone from school. I just… it doesn’t quite feel right to start a relationship like that.”
Harry was still pacing when Teddy popped in through the floo. Harry took one look at his face and could tell that his godson knew everything that had been going on.
Harry thought he heard a little snort from Draco. He was definitely sugar coating how his marriage had ended. In actuality, Laura was a terrible woman who had only pretended to love Harry in an attempt to benefit from his fame and his money. Barely a week after they'd returned from their honeymoon, she'd started acting quite indifferent to him, eventually turning quite nasty any time he so much as tried to talk to her. She had been spending exorbitant amounts of (his) money, and didn't agree with anything Harry wanted. They hadn't even lasted a year before Harry had found another man in their bed with her, and marched straight over to Draco's office to start the divorce process.
“They’re beautiful pictures.” Harry jumped at the sound of Draco’s voice, and turned to see him leaning on the doorway. He nodded at the comment, glancing back at the collection of photographs before opening the door and pulling out a small casserole wrapped in foil. He carried it over to the oven and set it to heat. A quick peek under the foil told him it was precooked, so it really just had to be warmed up.
“I suggest you make yourself comfortable, Mr. Malfoy,” Adella chuckled, nodding approvingly at Scorpius’ gesture. “The mediwitch should be bringing lunch around for you soon, and I’ll come back to check on how you’re doing later in the afternoon.”
Harrison looked up again, her jaw set.
“The woman who picked you from that festival, I found out that her name is Zare. It turns out she picked you because she assumed you would take her back to the city with you. Apparently conditions have been getting more and more difficult for the tribe recently, and certain members have been seriously considering leaving their rural lifestyle and going to the city. She wanted to do the same, but her parents refused, and she didn’t think it was safe for her to go alone.”
“I’d better get going,” he pointed out, standing up to leave. “You need to get some rest.”
Draco was spared from having to answer when Ron leaned over and handed him a small green box with a white triangle on it.
“I have more space than Scorpius, and I don’t work, so you won’t be alone all day. I also promise to never serve broccoli casserole again.”
Malfoy chuckled. “I was just looking for an empty examination room. There are usually a few near the Potions ward because the rate of potion-related accidents has been going down in recent years. It’s actually an interesting development; the Healers who studied it noticed that fewer people brew their own potions these days, which means more people are using products from licenced apothecaries. Which is great news for the apothecary industry, but it makes me wonder about people’s potions skills these days, if they don’t need it for…”
Harry hummed appreciatively, popping the rest of it into his mouth. She offered him another one, and he happily accepted.
Harry sighed. He'd been thinking about that a lot recently.
Harry shook his head. “I think you’re doing an incredible job with him. You put so much care into even the simplest interactions with him, making sure he has the space and safety to learn, and it’s obvious that he feels the love. He’s a brilliant kid, and it’s entirely because of you.”
“But… you work at the hospital! You healed the victims of those Transfiguration attacks!”
“Talk about what?”
Draco spent the night in Scorpius’ room, crying in the corner as his son slept.
"No, I meant your last name. Why does it... Potter, Potter..."
“We’d definitely be dead by now if it weren’t for her, let alone passing school. When I think about it, I used to be pretty invested in school, especially in the first couple of years. I spent the summer before first year reading all my textbooks because magic was such a fascinating new concept to me.”
“Your honour, we are here today to discuss a case that was rushed due to external political influence, where evidence was overlooked, and where due process was not observed. I have requested that this be a closed court on behalf of my client, to avoid said issues recurring. For this case, I have testimony from expert witnesses as well as new physical evidence to submit to the court.
"He sure is, just like you," Harry said, when Bryan gave him a worried glance.
When Harry remained quiet, Scorpius moved closer, sitting down on the other end of the couch.
“I’ve already told you, it has to brew through the full moon.”
McGonagall frowned at him. “I’m sorry, Draco. You know I don’t trust your department. I refuse to have spies in Hogwarts.”
“Yay, dragons!” Scorpius cried, clapping his hands. He jumped up and Draco took his hand, leading him down a busy hallway with Harry falling into step next to them.
Ignoring the way Draco’s chuckle made his heart flutter, Harry dragged him into the Floo.
“Harry, Draco! I’m glad you’re here!”
“Mostly normal. Secrecy has a new intern who messed up the spells on my office, and someone came looking for me.”
“Well, when a patient is ill enough that we don’t have another cure, there’s usually an issue within their magical core, or else within their genetic makeup. Transfiguring their body into a healthy one wouldn’t last because the issue would reappear and make them ill once more. In fact, most Healers theorise that the body would degrade even faster the second time round.”
Harry was sure he’d be successful this time. They would be sitting among his colleagues, so Harry was bound to overhear something important, and he was sure he’d be able to convince Draco to let Harry walk him back to his office after lunch. It was foolproof.
“Billy Burgers is not a nice restaurant,” she pointed out. “It’s got hard plastic benches, is garishly coloured, and the food is cheap and greasy.”
“That’s sensible of you,” Draco said kindly. “Do you know why there are so many of them about?”
“I don’t think so,” Scorpius said, unlocking his drawer and pulling the journal out. “His writing is pretty neat.”
noticed about Malfoy was that he somehow still looked like a wealthy aristocrat in his lime-green Healer’s uniform. Most Healers Harry had met wore simple trousers and a plain shirt under their robes, but Malfoy was dressed in shades of grey—an ash grey pinstripe waistcoat over a light grey shirt matched with solid ash grey trousers. Harry would never have thought to pair a navy blue tie with grey and lime-green, but it seemed to be working for Malfoy.
, but no one’s ever considered how to make it wear off
“25,” Harry replied carefully. He glanced around to find all his new friends staring at him with wide eyes.
“You know what I’m going to say.”
still exist, they were just empty. He quickly rectified that by submitting the transfer request, and after removing enough money for the day’s errands and setting a few other financial affairs in order, he made his way down the street to Ollivander’s. It was now owned by his niece, who barely seemed to know who Draco was and was happy enough to sell him a beautiful chestnut and unicorn hair wand. Brandishing this beauty, he walked into the small cafe that the girls had chosen for lunch.
And what if one day he did fall in love with someone, but they didn’t love him back. It had felt like he was in the same position with Laura for a while, and quite frankly, had been an awful feeling. But if it happened once, surely it would happen again?
Deciding a brotherly hug would be appropriate, Harry stepped forward, but at the same time, Draco turned to leave.
Potter hesitated for a moment, before nodding.
People in romantic relationships knew all kinds of things about each other. They usually spent lots of time together, and even visited each others’ homes. Surely getting close to him would be a perfect way to figure out what Malfoy really
Harry nodded. “In a way, yeah. I also just needed a break from home. I just got out of a really messy divorce.”
“Where is Harry? Is he coming here as well?” Scorpius didn’t miss his hopeful tone, and it made what he was about to say next so much worse.
Harry smiled at that. “I remember feeling like that myself, the first time I lived on my own. I kept fretting about having a theme or something to decorate around.”
“That’s good to hear.” Harry paused to take a bite of his sandwich, and almost gagged on the disgusting taste. He ripped open the bag of crisps and shoved a couple in his mouth, glad for the salty taste. “Have you heard anything about who might be behind these attacks?”
“Harry,” Hermione sighed, her tone making it clear he was about to get a lecture. “You’re fixating on Malfoy again!”
“My apologies, Draco,” she corrected quickly. “When was this first meeting?”
Harry thanked whatever deity might be listening that he’d been an irresponsible adult since the end of the war and never actually registered with a General Healer. He didn’t get sick often, and when he did, a bottle of Pepper-Up, some of Molly’s root vegetable soup and a day in bed usually did the trick.
“Oh, I already ate,” Scorpius said with a grin. “Madge brought me pizza as a thanks for taking her emergency duty shift tomorrow.”
It didn’t take Harry long to become friends with all of his neighbours in the hostel he’d chosen. They all seemed to be enamoured by his accent, especially the girls. Harry kept a safe distance from them, his last three disastrous trips in mind. Thankfully, despite the difference in accents, there was pretty much no communication barrier. They spent the entire first morning he was there teaching Harry how to count out Dragots, Spinks and muggle dollars. If Harry had thought that Galleons, sickles and knuts were odd, it was nothing compared to American currency. It turned out that wizards in America accepted muggle currency as part of their own, and Harry was constantly having to convert first from Galleons to Dragots, and then from Dragots to dollars.
Harry wandered through the sterile hallways of St Mungo’s, following the signs for the cafeteria. He’d learned his lesson about trying to find Draco the last few times he’d come to the hospital, and owled ahead, letting him know that he wanted to take him to lunch. Draco had replied with a hasty note that he was too busy, but Harry had insisted, and they’d compromised by agreeing to have lunch in the hospital’s cafeteria.
Harry was having so much fun with her, that it was an odd surprise when he knocked a stack of papers off his bedside table one day, and read on the itinerary that he was supposed to go to Oslo the next day. He'd completely forgotten about that leg of the trip.
“Okay.” Harry watched as Draco followed his son toward their room. He had just reached the door frame when Harry felt a sudden spark of bravery.
Harry sighed as the door shut behind him. What on earth had he got himself into?
“I’m okay, thank you.” He continued inching along the wall, pausing for a break as he leaned on the handle to the pantry. Harry caught himself staring and turned to set the table, only to realise there really wasn’t a table here. There was only the sofa, and a few bar stools at the kitchen island. Was Draco really able to climb onto the high stools when he could barely walk? Or did he usually sit on the sofa and eat?
go on a few dates without selling me to
“Next!”
“You should eat first,” Head Auror Clearwater said sternly. “I told you that case had better not interfere with your work, and I won’t have a drowsy and hungry Auror on emergency duty.”
“I don’t think your mum was ever on a team, but Draco said she was a pretty good flier. Draco and Harry were Quidditch rivals when they were at school. They were easily two of the best seekers in their generation.”
Harry also found himself drawn to the beautiful textiles in the market. He found himself purchasing many brightly coloured scarves for all his friends, and a beautiful beaded purse for Hermione. While Harry was happy to pay full price for everything, Hassan proved to be a big help in haggling with the vendors, especially since Harry found himself buying so many things.
With a sigh, he pulled the stack of parchment towards him and started to write. He wrote his first letter and gave it to Pippy to be sent off with express Portkey post and then settled in to write the rest. Before long, he had sent letter making plans to meet the girls for lunch and Andromeda for dinner. She had been right in saying that his mother would have wanted them to know each other, and now that he really thought about it, he wanted that too.
“Yes, thank you. This cloak is wonderfully warm.”
“Sneaking a magical creature into someone’s house was harder than Transfiguring an unsuspecting victim into one?”
“Muggles have some pretty inventive things, you know.”
Back at school, Harry would have assumed that Draco was mocking him, but he sounded quite genuine in his offer. Harry cast about for a moment, trying to remember what one of the unfamiliar words had sounded like.
“We can do this Scorpius. We can help Draco.”
"Papa, do you think the egg will hatch? Will we get to see a baby dragon?"
“Draco, those books would be great to sell to adults, but children—” Theo trailed off as Draco turned the glare on him.
“I have one more trip planned,” Harry admitted as he opened the door to the outer office.
When Teddy finally returned to his seat, the Chief Warlock immediately stood and called a recess. Scorpius watched as the court filed out, all of them looking relieved that Teddy’s lecture was over.
“They were trying to create a Polyjuice Potion that lasted longer?”
“If your mother isn’t able to watch him I could help out. It’s the least I could do, considering it’s my fault you’re going all the way there in the first place.”
“Harry! Thanks for agreeing to come here. I know it’s not the most romantic lunch spot, but I don’t have much time today.”
“I’m sure he’s just stressed with work,” Harry said quickly. He suddenly felt bad about his comment on Scorpius’ cooking. The poor boy was trying so hard, working full time only to come home and care for a frail parent at the end of the day. Surely he could be forgiven for forgetting to season a casserole, right?
“Regardless, I’m investigating what happened so a list of people capable of this attack would be helpful.”
“I’m not sure how Scorpius will feel about me moving out of here,” Draco said slowly. “Especially if what you said about him being scared of losing me is true.”
“But you wouldn’t want to be a Healer, would you?”
“Lunch first,” Head Auror Clearwater said sternly. “Stretch your legs and get something to eat, and then you’ll have the whole afternoon to read. I’ll cover the floo until you get back.”
Harry’s mind was racing. Scorpius’ life had been threatened, and Draco hadn’t told him? Harry was sure they would have been able to keep Scorpius safe without giving in to terrorists—what was the point of being the most famous man in England if you couldn’t get the best security for your son? But even if they hadn’t, Harry would still have wanted to know. He thought of the times he’d taken Scorpius to the park, or the shops back then, and let him wander away on his own. What if something had happened to their son?
Harry nodded. He summoned a flyer he’d picked up while they were in the wizarding sector earlier that day.
“And of course the new intern panicked and called St. Mungo’s, even though I could easily have handled salamander blood burns on my own. So that meant I had to waste an hour at St. Mungos, answering mundane questions about what caused the explosion, and what was in the potion, and what I’m allergic to, as if Adella doesn’t already know my entire medical history.”
“I, um, don’t have a recent partner. I’ve never…” Harry trailed off, but clearly Malfoy got the gist of what he was saying.
“So I’ve heard. I’ve got time.”
“Shall we?” Teddy asked, motioning toward the door. Only on-duty Healers and Aurors were allowed to apparate in and out of courtrooms, so Teddy and Scorpius would have to take the floo.
“These images were found lodged inside a journal, which was originally submitted as evidence item number 26. These images should have been catalogued as separate pieces of evidence, but because the investigation was rushed by the Auror handling it, they were missed. This is of consequence, because of the code written on the back. To explain this, I would like to call Head Auror Penelope Clearwater to the stand.”
“This is a nice restaurant,” Harry said, feeling stupid. Of course it was a nice restaurant—anyone with eyes could see that.
“I’m always happy to meet former students when the opportunity presents itself,” she said genuinely. “It’s a wonderful feeling to see everything they accomplish. I always feel like a proud parent when I see headlines such as this morning’s.”
“Well, they’re attracted to auras of confusion and surprise. Since most people at this table are surprised that you’re the one dating Harry, there are a lot of them buzzing around.”
“Hassan, tell me I’m right.”
to get a letter from his parents.
“Merlin’s b—” he quickly stopped talking and glanced at Scorpius, but was satisfied to find his son still staring at the television. “These muggles are quite fond of noisy contraptions, aren’t they?” he asked, just as a loud honking came from the television, followed by the sound of Scorpius’ uproarious laughter.
“I wish I could have seen that. If he was as good as Dad, their games must have been thrilling to watch.”
“Okay, Harry!” Scorpius cried happily, shaking with excitement once again. With one last wave, Harry shifted his hips and allowed himself to slip down the wet plastic.
Hassan's house was small but comfortable. The front was an open plan kitchen, dining room and living room all in one. It was tastefully decorated and neat, and thankfully nice and cold. Hassan clearly had the air conditioning running. No wonder Harry's travel agent has said this man was a highly recommended host in the area. He showed Harry to his bedroom, which was one of two in the back portion of the house. It was cheerfully decorated- the walls were painted a similar warm yellow to the outside of the house, and the bedclothes were colourfully patterned. The furniture was all made of the same solid wood, but the best part of the room was the view. There was a lovely floor to ceiling window, framed by thick lavender curtains, which looked out onto an adorable little patio and a flourishing yard. Harry counted three large trees with different types of fruits growing on them, and numerous smaller plants around the perimeter of the yard.
Charles handed Draco an envelope. “This picture will change your mind.”
“Exactly. Personally, I believe that’s your solution.”
Scorpius broke into a wide smile at that.
"How can I do that? Doesn't it take time to trust someone else?" he asked. She translated for her father, who, despite his earlier fury, looked rather impressed with Harry's reasoning. He said something back, which caused Camilla to sigh exasperatedly. She replied to her father without bothering to translate for Harry, and  it sounded like they were having a rather heated argument, before her father finally seemed to agree.
"I have to get my things from the hotel," he pointed out. Camilla nodded.
“I promise to write regularly, now that I can afford parchment and ink,” he said, trying valiantly to lighten the bittersweet moment. “And now you all have an excuse for spontaneous trips to Paris.”
Harry knew she had a point. He knew he shouldn’t argue. But today, his efforts had finally paid off—they finally had a reason to push for a review of all activities in the Department of Mysteries.
“We’re all hanging out in the lounge,” Jackie offered. “Come and say bye before you leave!”
“Did you really arrive right on time for exams?” Draco asked curiously. “I would always worry if I wasn’t there at least ten minutes early. It takes time to find your seat and arrange your quills before the exam starts.”
"Oh no. Please don't tell me you consummated your marriage?"
“Oh no,” Harry groaned. “I hope it didn’t cause problems for them.”
Harry shook his head. “I know, but I want to. Unless… you don’t?”
Harry had seemed quite charmed by their first date, however. Draco had done his best to remain charming and confident, a strategy that had clearly worked very well if Harry’s blush at the end of the night was any indication. A small part of him dared to hope that he might actually be able to charm Harry Potter, but he squashed the thought immediately. He simply had to convince Harry that there was nothing to be suspicious about. Once he was sure Harry trusted him, he’d make some excuse and end their relationship.
Harry groaned and rolled over in bed, pulling his pillow over his head to drown out the knocking on his door.
Draco opened his mouth as if he was going to ask, when his face changed suddenly.
“You recognised the modified Polyjuice Potion?”
McGonagall sighed. “While human to animal Transfiguration is complex, it is manageable by most people who do their NEWT in Transfiguration. Part of our intrinsic magic records the original state of the human, so that when they are transferred back from the animal state, the caster’s magic restores them exactly as they were, without conscious thought from the caster.”
“So, how are you finding your new flat?” he asked casually. Scorpius shrugged, wondering what he could say about the place. It didn’t quite feel like a home yet. Granted, he’d rushed the process of buying it and moving in, since he’d needed a place for his papa. He didn’t quite want to say so to his dad, however.
“You left me at Slughorn’s Christmas party to follow him after he got caught by Filch,” she pointed out.
“I’m sorry too,” he said finally. “I shouldn’t have made you feel guilty last night. Even if you had stood up for Papa, I don’t think you would have been able to do much. They would have still sent him to Azkaban. You were trying to protect me, and you did your best in a shitty situation.”
“Hey!” came an indignant cry from the kitchen. A moment later Scorpius looked up to see his dad join them, offering butterbeers all around. “I resent that!”
"They generally need to be reserved in advance, and there is a fee to book them, but the group who was using them today cancelled at the last minute. Would you like to reserve it?"
Deciding he needed something to take his mind off of Draco, Harry made his way upstairs to get dressed. He flipped through his selection of shirts, wondering if he should wear the dark green one Teddy had bought him for Christmas. Draco had always said that Harry looked good in darker shades of green, and this shirt would match his favourite black jeans. He laid the clothes out on the bed, and even cast an ironing charm at his shirt before he realised he was dressing to impress. This was the kind of outfit he’d wear to a nice dinner, or on a date (not that he ever went on any of those). He was just going to go heat up a casserole at his son’s house. A fancy shirt was probably overkill.
They both laughed at that, and Bryan finally sat up as well. Harry was suddenly quite aware of the fact that they were both stark naked, and he couldn't help glancing at Bryan's body in interest.
“Dad…” Scorpius started to protest, but his dad interrupted him.
"Very soon," she whispered, biting her lip. It looked like she was trying to make a decision, but finally nodded.
“My, my, Potter. If you were really this desperate for me to look at your arse, you could have treated me to dinner first.”
"They wanted me to be co-owner of their shop?" Harry asked, incredulously.
Draco gave Harry another one of those looks before standing up and striding over to the stage. Harry hurried to keep up, casting one last glance back at Scorpius who looked incredibly excited to be seeing his two travel companions participating in this activity.
“How much longer?”
Predictably, Harry looked confused, but he gave Draco his attention anyway.
“Do you have the hair?”
“It hurts to have to recognise that I’m not worth knowing.”
“You should take your jacket with you,” Draco said. “I don’t like to say it, but things go missing pretty easily in such a public space.”
“I’m not old!” Harry cried, turning to Bryan. “I can’t be that much older than you guys!”
“I’m glad you’re standing up for your teammates, but Penelope can take care of herself, she’s Head Auror for a reason.”
The Chief Warlock nodded, clearly thinking something over. Finally, with a glance around at the courtroom, he spoke again.
“And don’t worry about Scorpius,” Harry added as he stepped into the floo. “He’ll come around.”
“Mate... my wife doesn’t think about me as much as you think about that git. Just let him go.”
A little thrown off by Scorpius’ outburst, Harry didn’t respond right away. The guilt that he’d felt seeing that old photograph on Scorpius’ fridge was back in full force. He really hadn’t supported Scorpius properly when they’d lost Draco, and clearly it had taken more of a toll on his son than he thought.
Scorpius nodded, staring down at his hands before he started talking. Despite his dad’s previous conviction that he never wanted to talk about his ex-husband, he somehow knew that his dad wouldn’t get upset at him for talking about papa today.
“We have a patient who was attacked in an unusual way. She was Transfigured into a Hippogriff. One of the General Healers Transfigured her back, but many of her internal organs and such didn’t Transfigure back correctly. I was up all night checking her organs one by one but I still can’t be certain everything’s okay. I was hoping you’d have a useful trick to help?”
Harry worried his lip. He knew he had to be honest with Draco, but this was embarrassing.
"What are we doing tomorrow?" Harry asked curiously. They hadn't planned much of an itinerary beyond today, but Harry had assumed that by now he would have seen all the big attractions and would have a better idea of how he wanted to spend his remaining week and a half here.
like Harry.”
Harry shrugged. “There’s not much to tell. It’s mostly just reviewing financial documents and writing reports to bureaucrats explaining that they’re wasting money.”
Draco snapped back to attention as Harry waved a hand in front of his face. He’d completely tuned out of the conversation in his desperation to find the attacker.
Harry nodded, and took the opportunity to look around as Malfoy flagged down the server. He didn’t pay much attention as Malfoy placed their drink order, though by the time the server returned with the bottle and two menus, Harry’s attention had shifted to the man in front of him.
"I... I'll call my lawyer. I'm sure he can help us out with this."
“I tried my best to make sure they were reassigned to good positions,” Harry was still babbling. “Like the Creature By-Product Inspection Group! They didn’t need so many people anymore, since most creature by-products are imported these days. But I recommended they get transferred to The Department of International Magical Cooperation, to do quality inspection for imports!”
He shifted forward to capture Draco’s lips fully, and it was everything he’d ever wanted. He moaned softly against Draco’s lips, before he felt something move next to his hand.
“I did,” Harry assured him. “I’m definitely going back as a changed man.” He grinned at Hassan, and was relieved when his host laughed at the joke. A changed man was definitely one way to put it.
“You can count on that,” she said, leaning in to give him a hug. The conversation lightened up after that, and they enjoyed a wonderful lunch, though Draco and Pansy both got teary eyed again when it was time to say goodbye.
“What are you doing here? You’re supposed to be in Azkaban!”
It had been a week since Draco had had lunch with McGonagall. He’d discharged the girl three days ago and spent the rest of his week cooped up in his office, contemplating how to catch the culprit. It had been peaceful work, but now was the time for urgency.
She beamed at that, though her eyes were a little teary. As much as he loved Luna and Millie, it was Pansy who had always been his best friend, and he knew they were going to miss each other immensely.
"Harry!" came an excited voice as he swallowed the last bite of his sandwich, and he turned to find a grinning Scorpius running through the door. Laughing, he bent down and scooped the little boy up in his arms, giving him a tight hug.
“I’m sorry for that, Luna,” he said genuinely. “Though in my defense, you
Over the next few days, Scorpius and Teddy made it a point to ensure that each of them had dinner with Harry at least twice a week. Harry’s statement about his family not needing to keep secrets had made them realise that they’d been spending a lot of time with Draco since he’d been released, and that Harry must have been feeling left out.
on her face.
“For a vacation?” she inquired. Draco shook his head guiltily.
“I can only hope that one day I will.”
“The two friends used to do lots of fun things together, like flying races…” he paused and looked at Harry and Draco, who both sprinted across the stage, flapping their wings wildly. Draco reached the end first and turned to Harry with a smug smile, but it promptly disappeared when the host yelled out, “Congratulations, Harry!”
"Sir is awake! Master is telling Pippy to give sir a letter."
“It sounds like you’re going to be busy,” Harry said. Draco could tell he was trying to appear casual, as if hiding something that was bothering him. “And living so far away too…”
“Actually, the suffix ‘-ology’ is Greek,” Draco interjected. “But I apologise, you were saying?”
“Of course. It’s a butternut squash, with carrots and roasted bell peppers. One of my favourites. Shall I serve up a bowl for you?”
Struck speechless, the man's partner wordlessly held out a copy of Draco's book.  Draco picked up his quill and dutifully signed his name, adding a quick note.
Draco glared at him. “I would make an
Draco, of course, was not surprised with the way his own living room looked, and immediately wandered out of the room, leaving Harry standing awkwardly by the fireplace. There weren’t any pictures on the mantle, which made Harry wonder about Draco’s friends and family. He didn’t talk about anyone in his life, and he’d even mentioned at the gala that he’d lost touch with his friends after school.
Harry cast another Cooling Charm as he crept down the hallway, checking every so often to make sure his feet were covered by the invisibility cloak. It was bloody hot under the thing. He hadn’t noticed this in Hogwarts’ draughty corridors, but now that he was in the bowels of the Ministry, the thick cloak was cooking him alive. Magical Maintenance was probably too chicken to come here due to rumours of Unspeakable experiments being done on unsuspecting employees who wandered too deep into their labyrinth.
Excited that the story seemed to be picking up, Harry started flapping his wings again.
“Oh Merlin, that’s hilarious. No wonder your neighbours have been concerned!”
delicious. He took another bite as Malfoy laughed.
Harry chuckled. It was an appealing suggestion, and if Draco was going to be here in an hour, they really did need to maximize their time. The shower proved to be big enough for both of them to comfortably take turns sucking each other off and then wash each others' backs. After a few cleaning charms made the previous night's clothes wearable again, they trooped downstairs to the reception desk, where a young wizard showed them the dining room and gave them both hangover and mouth freshening potions. Just as they were turning away from the desk, something caught Harry's eye.
It was a thrilling ride, though it reminded him a bit of the Chamber of Secrets. All too soon, Harry splashed into the pool, spluttering for a minute before he managed to right himself. He found that he could just stand with his chin above the water, and understood why the lifeguard wouldn’t want Scorpius to reach the bottom on his own. He glanced up at the platform and waved at the lifeguard, indicating that he was ready to catch Scorpius. With a nod, the lifeguard gave Scorpius, who was already seated and ready to go, a little push, and off he went. He screamed the whole way down, before splashing into the water right next to Harry. Harry reached out and grabbed hold of him, lifting him quickly out of the water. He was alarmed to see Scorpius coughing and spluttering.
I think I would have been a nervous wreck without you, so my thanks again.
“Shut up, Gin,” Harry said. “Draco has to work tonight.”
“That song will be stuck in my head for weeks thanks to you two. I’ve figured out how to get to the Dragon wing, it’s not far from here.”
“I’m thinking about how much of a loss the restaurant must be going into if it feeds people like you every day,” Harry sighed.
“Um, I’m just going to go to the loo,” Draco said awkwardly. Harry and Scorpius both watched as he shuffled across the flat. As soon as he’d closed the door behind him, Harry turned to his son.
"Uggh!" Camilla yelled in frustration, her father looking smug. "They decided that they want also to eat here now," she explained to Harry. Her tone of voice made it clear that they were here to keep an eye on Harry and Camilla. While his new friend seemed rather irritated by her parents' antics, he couldn't help thinking it was rather sweet. He longed for parents who would be so protective of him, and couldn't help feeling jealous of Camilla. Not wanting his dark thoughts to ruin the evening though, he turned to the host.
A few days later, Harry set out bright and early in the morning, catching the first portkey to Las Vegas. He hadn’t originally planned to start his travels there, but there had been a sale on portkey tickets and he’d decided to take advantage of it. Since America was such a big country, and he planned to see as much of it as he could, he’d decided to be a little frugal on his trip. Of course he could afford to do the entire trip first class if he wanted to, but the travel agent had assured him that staying in a hostel was an experience in itself, and that he’d meet fellow travellers that way.
. That’s what Draco did, though. The Polyjuice that the killer used to get into the Minister’s office wore off before he could get out, which was why he was caught. If he hadn’t been caught, they would have thought it was you, which would have set off a major international incident. This way, the political situation was mostly contained, even though it cost the Minister his life.”
Agent Eta burst out laughing. “How do you know he’s not doing the same?”
since he has already taken a liking to you, I thought I’d ask.
“That smells good,” Draco sighed, watching as Harry stirred the chicken soup. He’d made this recipe countless times over the years, anytime Scorpius had felt under the weather. Allowing the chicken and vegetables to simmer for hours on end resulted in a tasty and nutritious broth that was still light and easy to digest. He was hoping it would make Draco’s lunch a little more exciting, at least for today.
"That war really got to you, eh?" Bryan asked, leaning carefully forward and touching the scar the horecrux had made on his chest all those years ago. Harry was inexplicably reminded of the scars he must have left on Draco after the incident in 6th year.
Draco nodded, though he still looked unsure about something. Unsure why he was being so shy, he turned back to the witch behind the counter, whose cheerful expression had suddenly melted away.
Scorpius nodded. It wasn’t the official copy or anything, and he didn’t see any problem with that.
Teddy gasped at that. “That makes sense! I’ve been wondering why they would have wanted a less potent Polyjuice.”
Draco frowned at the thought, before shaking his head.
"Who did you think I was?" Harry asked, a little hurt that he wasn't who Bryan had been hoping for.
Harry's travel agent had told him it would be hot. He'd warned him to brush up on his extra strength sun repelling charms and to bring only light clothes. But nothing could have prepared Harry for
“Thank Merlin he wasn’t, but what if he was? I don’t wanna risk it dad, don’t worry about cooking for us.”
To scare dear squiddy hard,
“I didn’t realise so many logistics went into sending mail,” Draco mused. “Or that it cost money, to be honest. You’re right that we have an Owlery here, so I guess sending letters doesn’t cost more than the care for the owls.”
So what is the truth? Is this really a cry for attention? Or is there something more sinister behind this new information? And how will we know? While the obvious answer is to go straight to the source, Mr. Potter himself did not respond to any requests for comments, nor did his businesses PR managers. Until we know for sure what's happening inside his head, our thoughts and charms are with our ailing hero.
“I’m just being melancholy,” Harry shrugged. “I didn’t exactly have a normal life, growing up. I guess watching you guys is just making me wonder how things could have been different.”
It still felt a little disconcerting, however, as Harry led him into the unfamiliar kitchen and put the kettle on for tea. He looked around, soaking in all the details that made this place home for Harry and Scorpius. He smiled at the adorable snitch-shaped salt and pepper shakers, and the Hogwarts-house aprons hanging on the pantry door. There was a collection of photographs on the fridge, and while Draco recognised some from Scorpius’ flat, there were others that he’d never seen before, and he was excited to hear the stories behind them.
“I’m glad you’re enjoying it,” he replied. “This one was one of mother’s favourites. I figured you would probably have similar tastes.”
"It looks great!" Harry said, grinning at Draco over Scorpius' head. "I especially love that everything is orange and lime green."
“You... what? Are you okay? I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to—”
“Um… it depends what you’re talking about,” Harry said meekly, hoping that feigning ignorance might help. It didn’t.
have a brain. I was wondering if there was more to you than a pretty face.”
Under the summer stars
“Are you saying I’m trouble?” he teased. Harry shook his head quickly, unsure how to respond, but Luna spoke up.
“You’re welcome. Did you get to fly it?”
“Um, Merrick. He’s the best choice, good stats and all.”
That led Harry to another question—which department would Malfoy supervise? If he’d been called in to clear up a Transfiguration, perhaps it was Spell Damage. Or maybe Curses. Though he could have been the only supervisor available at the time of the attack—Harry didn’t know anything about Healer hierarchies at St Mungo’s.
The receptionist frowned. “I, um… I’m not sure about Healer Malfoy’s appointments,” he said slowly. “Perhaps if you told me what it was for, I could refer you to another Healer?”
What was really alarming him, however, was that Potter knew he’d helped the girl. The story had been all over the papers, but thanks to the media liaison for the department, Draco’s name had been kept out of it. He had to talk to Potter and figure out why the man was so insistent on speaking to Draco, but he didn’t have time to “examine” Potter’s arse right now—there was an urgent case coming in. It was a shame… Potter did have a rather nice arse.
Harry nodded, shoving his hands in his pocket, where he felt something odd. With a start, he realised it was the kite he’d brought for Scorpius. He’d shrunken it and put it in his pocket, but since Scorpius wasn’t in the office today, he’d completely forgotten about it until now.
Harry was dismayed to see that their table had been taken by a family with young children. He should have left his jacket on the chair to save their spot. Draco led them to a table in the back corner. Harry was about to suggest they not sit somewhere so secluded—he’d never overhear anything back here—when he remembered the interaction they’d just had. It was no wonder Draco wanted to sit far away from everyone else.
“So they miscalculated?”
"So?" Harry challenged, feeling upset that Bryan was acting like a fan instead of a friend. "Why do you care? You were across the ocean!"
“You’re still quite young,” Mr. Taber said, peering closely at Scorpius. “You must have many friends and family members still. It’s hard to understand this kind of loneliness until you’re in it.”
“Or to marry,” Draco said with a smirk. Harry snorted.
“It’s not a stereotype when you grew up in a dorm with six other guys,” Bryan laughed. “At that point, it’s proof. Most guys are a mess, I don’t know how I can be so attracted to them.”
“Ready for dessert?” Bryan asked, pushing away what must have been his sixth plate and standing up eagerly. Harry felt like throwing up just at the thought of more food, but everyone else seemed equally eager to attack the rows of cakes, ice cream, pies and various other sweets.
“No, it’s for reheating food that’s gone cold but supposed to be eaten warm.”
Harry laughed, even though seeing the toy reminded him of Camilla. Not that he had stopped thinking about her very much on his trip home. He'd sent Priscillia an owl from the international portkey station in Oslo, requesting the next possible appointment with Draco. He knew she'd never forgive him, but they needed to get divorced as soon as possible.
Scorpius nodded excitedly. He’d been bursting to tell Teddy about his discoveries.
“I’m going to my room,” he mumbled, before storming up the stairs. He heard Teddy calling after him, but ignored him in favour of slamming his door and flopping down on his bed. Even though it was still the middle of the day, Harry felt drained. He vaguely registered the sound of Teddy leaving, but even though his body felt like lead, his mind was racing through everything he’d just learned.
“You’d think the
“It’s been a bit of a trial and error,” Scorpius continued, aware that he was babbling to fill the silence. “Teddy and I have figured out a few meals that work, like grilled fish, or broccoli casserole, and I’ve kinda fallen into the habit of just repeating those.”
"But how you make money for travel?" she asked.
"Why not?" he demanded.
After a long night of managing the Ministry Head of Finance’s heart condition, the last thing Agent Delta wanted was to see Agents Eta and Phi standing outside Delta’s office door.
“What’s ritorical?” Scorpius asked.
“I’ll give you three guesses. I was almost not surprised when the Monitoring Spells tipped me off.”
them, and if Draco was to be believed, they loved him back. Taking a deep breath, he leaned forward, toward Draco.
“So what did you want to discuss?”
“He doesn’t belong in Azkaban,” Scorpius whispered. “I can’t just leave him there.”
“So... this
"Like what you see?" he smirked, clearly eyeing Harry up as well. Harry blushed, looking up to meet Bryan's eyes.
“He asked me to give you this note,” Draco said, handing Harry a folded sheet of paper. Still smiling, Harry opened it to find a short but heartfelt message.
“What’s that?” Harry asked casually as he put his things back in his bag.
It was Teddy’s turn to roll his eyes, but he stood up anyway.
? He marched up to the counter, and flagged down a cheery witch.
"Did you get anything for Papa, Harry?" Scorpius asked.
I could apologize for showing up unannounced and attracting media attention to us, but neither of us should have to apologize for what that rag writes. You're right in assuming that I know
“He’s got a point, Dad,” Scorpius said sheepishly. “You’re a brilliant seeker, and a half-decent chaser, but for some reason keeping just isn’t your strong suit.”
“Ha! It’s not my fault you’re too old for shots!” she jeered back.
“This one is just room temperature. Is it for storing room temperature foods?”
“Um, there was a war, in Britain. It technically went on for decades, but it got really heated while I was in school. A lot of us ended up fighting in it. When you’re trying to make sure you and your friends don’t get murdered, partying and having fun tends to take a back seat.”
Harry and Priscillia both started laughing; of course Draco would turn the five-year-old’s decorating skills back on Harry.
Harry was still seething, but he could feel a little curiosity creeping in. He didn’t want to admit it, but Teddy may have had a point—he was angry at Draco for lying to him, for betraying him. The tiny, rational part of his brain had registered what Teddy said. Draco had been blackmailed, as Harry had imagined a million times over, and probably didn’t deserve life in Azkaban for that. Deciding he needed more information, he flopped gracelessly onto the opposite sofa and glared at Teddy, arms folded across his chest. Teddy started to speak again, clearly understanding what Harry wanted.
“I think so. It was in his journal.”
"Really? They're delicious!"
"I travel," he said confidently. "I want to see the world, and I decided to start here."
“Mr. Taber…” Scorpius said slowly. “You said you call him in from the yard at night. Do you call out “Help”?”
“Thank you again for being there for me last night. I’ve been up all night thinking about your words, and you’re right (as usual). This is my way of helping people, and it’s important work.
So what do you say? We’ll have lunch with Geoffrey, and then later tonight, if you’re amenable, I’d like to take you out for dinner. No work, no press, no Tom and Ellen, no reading between the lines (and no shots!). Just us, getting to know one another and building a relationship.
Agent Delta hated being backed into a corner, but that was exactly what had happened here. Even if they hadn’t been working on the same case, Phi would probably still have joined their unit—Agent Phi and Agent Eta both had more seniority than Agent Delta. Deciding there was no point in arguing anymore, Agent Delta changed the topic.
"How they died?" she asked quietly, at her father's request.
Harry couldn't help smiling at that, relieved that Bryan actually did want him. He knew they couldn't have anything very permanent, since Harry would have to go back to the UK eventually, but it would have been very awkward for their friendship to have had sex but not actually wanted it.
“Ah. Did you know that Draco is in fact Latin for
“I don’t know how you deal with puzzles like that,” Neville mused. “That’s why I like plants. They’re simple and straightforward.”
“Healer Malfoy doesn’t take general appointments, you said so yourself,” she pointed out.
"Really? What sport do you play?"
Daneri mumbled something, clearly deep in concentration. He and Harry were sitting in the back of the car while Daneri did his makeup. They’d explained that traditionally men spent the whole morning getting ready, but that they wouldn’t arrive on time for any of that.
“Scorpius?” he called, wondering if his son was even home. Surely an Auror would have come to investigate the sound of someone coming through the floo by now? He glanced around for any clues as to where Scorpius might be, but the place was very sterile. It felt almost unnatural in a way. Scorpius wasn’t a slob, but he wasn’t the neatest person either.
