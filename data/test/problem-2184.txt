“Hullo,” he says back, head tilting curiously. He wasn’t sure what all a wizard would need black robes for, but this boy seems to be his age and getting the same thing as him, so it seemed logical to ask, “Hogwarts, too?”
The morning the broom is delivered it also comes with a letter from Sirius Black addressed to Draco. Hedwig nibbles at the piece of bacon Draco offers her as he shakily unfolds the letter.
“You will be coming down to the dungeons to get ready with me and the girls. You need an appropriate crowd to vent to, and we Slytherins are always eager to gossip.” Granger is opening her mouth to protest, probably to cite rules about inter house boundaries, but Eve hushes her. “I refuse to take no for an answer. You’re coming.”
Draco nods, beginning to understand, now, what Ollivander was saying. He wouldn’t mind seeing what other kinds of wands were out there. There had to be other wandmakers, right? He wondered what else was used.
Harry makes a pained noise, but otherwise doesn’t answer. Sinistra’s office is just ahead and the door is already open. When they pause at the doorway, waiting to be invited in, they see that they’re not the only ones that were called in. Vivian stands just within, her arms crossed, and when Sinistra nods the boys inside she looks back at them with wide eyes.
“Spoke to the twins before they could set they’re plan into motion. Thought I’d come have tea with the menace and let you in after she ran out,” Draco explains. He has no idea what the twins had managed to do to cause a riot this time, but Umbridge had stormed out like a bat out of hell.
“I gave Potter the Walkman you sent me,” Draco says quietly into his radio the first evening back in the manor.
Potter startles, looking down with wide eyes at a very furious-looking ferret. “Uh… sorry to insult you?”
since he’s intrigued how much like chemistry it may actually be like, and he snatches a book about developing one’s own charms. He eyes a book about something called Quidditch at some point, not even sure what that means, and decides to move on until he finds himself standing beside an adult man with flaming, balding, ginger hair and glasses. They appear to be at a section on Muggles, which Draco immediately finds hilarious and can’t help the snort that leaves him.
“There is a myth…” Mr. Davis begins, brandishing his wand and tapping a stack of blank, black papers. The papers fold themselves into little figures that move along to Mr. Davis’s explanation. “That only the one that a prophecy pertains to can retrieve their Prophecy.” Most of the figures appear to look one way while a single one steps apart from them and picks up a tiny, origami ball. It holds it aloft, victorious.
“Destroy trust in the Ministry, build trust with sentient life,” Draco offers and Eve hums in agreement. “I won’t disagree. That would be nice. Perhaps they will one day hear names such as ‘Parkinson,’ ‘Crouch,’ or ‘Malfoy’ and not feel trepidation at what is to come.” There was no beating around the bush… the Malfoy name had a reputation. Either an intimidating one in higher circles, or a hated one in all the rest. Draco hoped, one day, that reputation could be changed into something much kinder.
“Oh. Currently it is the centaurs scheduled for the final article,” Draco shrugs, taking a sip of his coffee. His had been sweetened to a delectable level. When he lowers the mug, though, Eve is giving him an unimpressed look. “What?”
“What is it now, Papa?” Max whines and Draco can’t help but agree with the tone. He had been in this museum, following around this strange, American, Muggle family for the better part of an hour, and he still wasn’t sure why he hadn’t left yet. Perhaps it was curiosity, fascination at these bizarre beings, like they were animals at a zoo. Perhaps because Max said friends should get to know each other and had jabbered Draco’s ear off.
“I just don’t like the idea of being somebody’s puppet,” Max replies flippantly and, as ridiculous as this conversation seems to Draco, he thinks he can agree with that.
“Harry… kissed me a few days back,” he ignores the loud squeal Max lets out when he says that, instead continuing on. “He kissed me, then ran away, and then he went missing because Mr. Weasley got hurt.”
Harry shifts where he’s rested his head against Draco’s shoulder, eying the radio in bafflement. “Why… did you do that?”
Draco found the rest of their house mostly competent despite all of that. Sophie was still his Transfiguration partner most of the time and he found he quite liked Daphne and her soft voice and love of classic literature. Tracey creeped him out, but she creeped most everyone out, with her weird obsession with poisons and acid and chaos. Blaise was also a very competent student, but he kept to himself so much that Draco had a hard time determining how he felt about him, and Pansy seemed obsessed with gossip and didn’t mind jumping back and forth between sides depending purely on which entertained her more.
“The young master… is too kind,” she finally whispers, pulling the book close to her chest to hug it and stare up at Draco instead.
“Nah, it’s fine,” Max says loudly, trying to brush everything off. “My mama knows how to make a better gumbo than him, anyway, so it’s whatever.” The pause feels weighted after that and neither Draco nor Potter attempt to fill it, certain Max has more to say. “It’s just… it sucks, y’know? Can’t do anything about it… Just gotta sit back and think about how much it sucks…”
“That…” but the blonde’s voice catches before he can even decide what he was about to say and he looks away, scowling at himself. What was he doing? Getting all emotional over some house elf. Of course Dobby would want to see Draco happy. It was his purpose, after all.
At some point they do end up losing Eve. She hurries on ahead while Draco and Potter linger behind. They are in a tunnel made of glass, aquatic creatures floating all around them, the light a faint blue from the tank.
“Now you listen here, Draco,” the Muggle man had said firmly, and a little desperately. “Tests are all fine and good, but don’t you measure yourself up to what they might tell you. Your intellect goes beyond what a test can measure, do you hear me? Do the best you can, but know you are more than just--”
Well, it looked like whatever Voldemort was looking for really was in the Hall of Prophecies, but this particular one, whatever it was, wasn’t just about Voldemort? This had to do with Potter, too?
“My father and mother originally could not determine whether to send me to Durmstrang or Hogwarts,” Draco explains, pushing his own textbook in Granger’s direction so she can snatch it up. “After Hogwarts was decided my father gave me this to ‘fill the hole in my educational system,’ I think.”
“Well, you may have to get used to it,” McGonagall sighs, looking between Mr and Mrs Nubble, “If he is to join us at Hogwarts this term.” She’s asking his foster parents, Draco realizes after a few beats of silence. So wrapped up in finding out about his past and his parents he had completely forgotten this was the original purpose of this visit.
“Okay. Show me one of your personal trickster gadgets I’ve heard so much about and we’ll have a deal.”
“Agreed,” Draco croaks, nodding, and the two boys turn away swiftly and keep walking down the hall, conversation left behind along with what they had just seen.
They mostly visit clothing stores, examining racks and shelves as Eve schools the boys on what is fashionable and what is affordable in Muggle culture. They walk around a bookstore, which Potter quickly loses interest in, but he doesn’t complain too much about it as Draco and Eve eagerly look through the collection of books. They eat lunch, Potter picking out a place that serves something called a “burger,” which Draco finds to be an unholy source of all things messy and immediately orders two more.
“Draco!” Harry exclaims, clearly relieved to see the blonde, and Draco offers a quick smile, hurrying forward to press a reassuring kiss to the other boy’s brow.
Max is laughing hysterically through the radio as Draco grows more and more frazzled, until he finally just forces himself to chew and swallow. Were they popping in his stomach now? He couldn’t tell, but a part of his brain was positively sure they had to be.
Draco Lucius Malfoy is found after he walks back into the Leaky Cauldron nearly seven hours after his disappearance. He is unharmed and content, but strangely quiet about his time away. Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy only care that they have him back. For weeks afterwards they do not let their son out of their sight, showering him in gifts for his stressful time around all those filthy Muggles, for that must be the reason he will not speak on it.
She also had tried to put the fear of Salazar into all of them, declaring that no one outside of Slytherin had managed to get into their common room for hundreds of years. Draco had thought that something to be proud of… until second year when he’d been made aware that Harry and Weasley would be sneaking into his common room polyjuiced as Crabbe and Goyle. Or, in fourth year, when Eve had blatantly dragged Hermione around in Slytherin dorms right before the Yule Ball. It made him think of how unlikely it actually was for no one to have gotten into their common room in such a long time.
“You still haven’t told my why you’re here, though…” Potter pushes, leaning forward. The suspicion is thankfully gone from his face, but in its stead sits some kind of pleading hope. Draco isn’t sure what the Boy Wonder could possibly be hoping out of Draco, but he goes ahead and offers his purpose.
They munch on M&M’s, visit the mall, sightsee, harass kids at a skatepark, and laugh with each other like they’re the only two people in the world.
“And they sure love showing off how much they know,” Sophie mumbles, half to herself, but Draco doesn’t notice her. Instead, he’s focused on the devious smirk growing on Pansy’s face.
“Any particular camp in mind?” Draco asks. Muggles had so many unique clubs and camps and organizations, it was intriguing.
“Alas, I am far from fully powered,” Huang-Jun eventually sighs, miserable, as he shrinks back down and rejoins the two boys, this time on Weasley’s shoulders. “If I had my Pearl…” the dragon trails off and Draco and Weasley share a concerned look. For the most part Huang-Jun had seemed rather upbeat, if cynical, but now…
“Yes, I think that’s enough,” Granger huffs, also looking rather embarrassed, but likely for an entirely different reason. After all, she was supposed to be the observant one of the Golden Trio. How could she have missed this?
“Now, who can see ‘em? Put yer hand up. Come on, now,” Hagrid says. Draco doesn’t bother, it is very clear he can see them with how he’s petting the skeletal equine. He does glance around to see who does, however.
“He just spoke his opinion. He’s allowed that,” Max tries to reason with Draco, but Draco knows better, and nothing Max can say will completely subdue his anger. Hopefully, however, it will calm him down enough for when Potter arrives.
“I bet it’ll be great in the winter,” Draco notes, nibbling at the remains of his bacon. “It’s so cold in the dungeons, and I love it. You can see the underside of the lake and everything.”
Bloody hell, You-Know-Who was back… It was hard to even imagine, but just looking at Potter was proof enough. Sirius doesn’t leave his godson’s side through the whole thing, but Draco gets up to pace over by the wall.
With how swiftly McGonagall walked and how no one dared step in her way they made it to Gringotts quickly. It was a massive building made of marble, standing out elegantly from all the other stores around it, with beautiful pillars and tall, bronze doors. McGonagall gently nudges Draco inside said doors when he hesitates, too busy staring up at the building.
They were an unstoppable, studying machine! And while they were still stressed, it was clear their study group was relieving some of their worries.
“Yet you didn’t,” Ron bites back, pouting as he sits behind the bushy-haired girl, grumbling about being unable to see around her hair and her attitude. Hermione ignores him. Harry hushes him. Draco kicks him.
his cheeks flushed, and there is a definite quiver to him that doesn’t seem to match with the image of Potter that Draco has in his head.
he says. He feels the other boys in the room looking at him and he knows he must have fallen back into Parseltongue. He still doesn’t know how he does it, nor knows what it sounds like, but so far he hasn’t had any issues.
“You should show that to Professor McGonagall. She would want to see it,” Sinistra says as she takes back her own card and Draco looks up at her quickly. McGonagall was back at Hogwarts? He hadn’t heard about that. He would have gone to check on her already if he had.
“I reiterate!” Draco had exclaimed, stomping over to grab his bag and drag it over to his feet where he can defend it properly. Little help that would do now, since the two boys have already gotten what they wanted. “Thieves! I will not associate with thieves!”
He snaps his finger loudly. “I got it!” he exclaims excitedly and Umbridge looks back at him, her expression wild and furious. “I may not have proof on who might be running the club, but I bet I know where they’re meeting.”
want to know,” Weasley is facing Draco now, his face like thunder as he leans towards the blonde, “Is what you intend to do with Harry.”
“IM?” Potter repeats, arching a brow and clearly attempting not to laugh as he hands back the camera. Draco narrows his eyes and snatches the camera out of his outstretched hand.
“I do not know, but this is surely a disturbing thought,” Dumbledore sighs, standing straight once more. He removes his wand and in one, smooth gesture conjures a black sheet that drapes over the body. Then he turns his wise, old eyes on Draco, head tilting just slightly. “What do you think, Mr. Malfoy?”
Except Potter couldn’t be found, which is how he now found himself sitting miserably in the library with Eve. He’d managed to run into the twins, who were rightly furious, and they gave him a few more details, but no Potter. No Golden Trio, actually.
It made Draco wonder what his parents may have looked like… Mr and Mrs Nubble had said they had found him on their stoop when he was an infant, swaddled up and wailing. They didn’t know where he had come from. All that they knew, from a quickly scrawled note left with him, was his name was Draco Lucius Malfoy, his birthday was the 5th of June, and he needed a home.
It seemed inevitable that they would connect. They would meet on their walks home from school at first, but then Hermione’s parents began calling the Nubble’s landline asking if Draco could come by and visit. It all felt very normal for such an un-normal relationship, bonding over bizarre events that had no obvious explanations.
It appeared the era of Potter’s “almost crying” had finally come to an end. Strangely enough, in the face of the raw, visceral grief, Draco feels relieved.
“He used it to save me from Crouch,” the boy whispers, turning his face up towards Draco. He’s not smiling, he’s clearly too wiped for that, but he looks a little serene. “Saving me all over again, Prince Charming?”
“I’ll back them up,” Sophie says, then jabs a finger at Draco, “Stop arguing, dumbass, and just get to work!”
“No room, my ass,” Potter snorts, and he moves inside. He shoves Draco’s feet out of the way, sitting across from him, but Draco stubbornly shoves his feet back into place against the Boy-Who-Lived’s gut. Potter grunts, then scowls, and Draco smirks.
Eventually, with all his persuasive skills being put to the test, the goblins had spilled. Bagman was deeply, deeply,
“Your child is a menace!” Draco had hollered back, not in any mood to even talk to the woman. She would probably end up saying something calming and sweet that would take away some of Draco’s anger, but he didn’t want to lose his anger right now. He was furious that Max couldn’t see how right Lucius Malfoy was.
for Neville!” Granger says, smiling brightly. “I mean, I’m happy for everyone that got the spell, but Neville’s been so downtrodden with the Patronus Charm, lately…”
Whenever anyone of the DA was spotted in the halls, near the evening, heading for a meeting, they would always say they were heading up to practice their wandless magic. They still wanted to be careful about being spotted too often, however, so it was meant to be used only as precaution.
It wasn’t a lie. All he was interested in was the truth, but the “truth” to Fudge meant something very different.
“You should be proud. I was emulating you,” Harry huffs and Draco smiles cheekily against his neck. “What do you know about occlumency?”
“We’ve won the last six years in a row, you know,” Gemma says, preening and smiling, a piece of veggies sticking out from between her teeth. Draco tries not to snort and Harry, he spots, makes a move at his own mouth to warn the prefect of the rebellious food. She startles, cleans her teeth with a finger, then glowers at the first years, her moods apparently like a pendulum. “So, don’t screw this up for us, alright? Every year I’ve been here we’ve won, and I intend to keep it that way until I graduate.”
“And then you found nothing on the subject anyway. You’re useless,” Draco snaps, then keeps climbing. When he gets level to Skeeter, however, she continues to talk.
It would just be his luck. Harry had issues with the Militus Charm and Draco had issues with the Patronus. Even Weasley had managed to finally form his Militus during their private meetups.
Besides… He doubts Edgecombe has given up just from a single spook. She’d seemed set on what she was doing once she’d really started moving.
“Hush, Malfoy,” Granger hisses at him when they get into hearing range, Potter plopping down with an exhausted sigh beside Draco like he owns the place. The blonde’s focus, however, is on the bushy-haired catastrophe in front of him.
“I was just in the Ministry. There were a few rumors, doubled with Longbottom telling me about the nightmare… It was just a matter of putting two and two together after that,” Draco shrugs, his gaze not leaving Potter’s. He realized a lot of his anger was very swiftly washing away and making way for unbridled relief, no matter how stupid Potter was.
The relief that washes over Draco is palpable and he hardly thinks as he hops right off Krum’s shoulder and launches himself at the bespectacled boy with a shrill squeak. “Holy--” Potter exclaims, but manages to catch the ferret in a furry, squirming mess. Draco can’t really hug him like this, but he curls up and presses as close as he can to the other boy’s chest where he is cradled in Potter’s arms. He can hear his heartbeat like this, strong and so very alive, and Draco almost doesn’t care that he’s a ferret anymore.
“No! That’s not,” Potter cuts himself off, frustrated, and finally just asks, “Is Max a boy or a girl?”
“It’s a Remembrall,” he explains, looking sheepish, “Everyone in my family knows I forget stuff a lot. This was probably Gran’s idea, actually… This tells you if there’s something you’ve forgotten. Watch, you hold it tight like this and if it turns red- oh…” Neville’s face falls as the smoke in his Remembrall turns scarlet, “You’ve forgotten something…”
“No, Potter, screw you! We’ve been sitting out here for at least an hour and you didn’t mention a thing! Low blow, boy wonder, low--”
Why don’t I believe you?” Potter speaks lowly now, the volume he’d been building before dropping into something dangerous. Draco shrugs, nonchalance generally good at infuriating the other boy.
“There wasn’t really a singular moment that I realized,” Draco admits after a time and Harry shifts to look back at him while still holding to his wrists. “There was no big eureka moment. It was multiple things that I saw, over time, that contradicted with what I knew about you, or Max, or Muggles, or muggleborns. Eventually I had to accept that what my father was, and what I had always envisioned him as, were not one in the same.”
Eventually talk of schedules pitters off and Draco and Hermione fall into their own conversation, murmuring about their first night and what they thought of their houses.
“Yes. Adults can be frightened,” Narcissa finally says, voice calm. So, Max’s mother had been right. Draco doubted she knew everything like Narcissa did, but it was good to know that there was at least
Draco stares back at it, though, and feels a connection to the creature. He can tell, without it doing a thing, that it’s a mischievous thing, and when Draco reaches out to it, it leans its head forward so he can pet it.
There were so many heirlooms and artifacts that belonged to the Black family. Photos – some hidden away, some not – of people Draco was distantly related to. History in the very walls of the building, yet Draco knew none of it. And he couldn’t really ask Sirius. Sirius wanted next to nothing to do with his blood relatives.
They lapse into another awkward silence, this time even more tense than before, and slowly more sweets are opened to nibble on. Harry offers Draco a few Pumpkin Pasties and a bite of Treacle Tart, and Ron quietly munches on Chocolate Frogs. Draco hated it. He should have stayed with Hermione.
“Uncivilized brats. The whole stock of them,” Umbridge huffs daintily, before offering Draco a smile. It sends shivers up his spine. “Thank you, Mr. Malfoy. You really are such a good boy. Come, sit with me. Some tea would do to calm both of our nerves, wouldn’t you say?”
Potter’s scandalized expression is completely worth the Earworm Jinx that lodges the “Macarena” in Draco’s head.
Which is also probably why it is such a chaotic mess when Harry’s own article drops in the Quibbler. It’s just over a week after the Lung Dragon article, people still in a murmur over that, but the moment Harry’s story is finally released to the public the whole school seems to explode.
Harry looks suddenly very shocked and Dean, loudly, calls, “It is called futbol and it is perfectly acceptable! Lay off!”
They all turn, then flinch backwards towards the bare wall when they realize the figures have moved. They still stand exactly as they were, but now their heads have angled so they can stare at them with unblinking, vacant stares.
Weasley sighs, head hanging, before he shakes it out and sprays water droplets everywhere, making Draco scowl and the twins step back. “Nothing to do about it, I guess. I’m gonna take a warm shower and let Hermione and hopefully Harry know how everything went.”
It was a Saturday night, with homework finished, and everyone in generally high spirits. They’d even got a visit from the Slytherin DA girls, who’d managed to weasel them all into playing a few rounds of Two Truths and a Lie. And when everything was settling, Harry simply… didn’t leave.
“Yes, ‘we.’ You’re important to all of us. Hermione was ecstatic when you finally got on a first name basis with her and she adores brainstorming with you, and Ron won’t admit it but you two kind of pull each other out of your bullshits and balance each other out, so…”
“Curious, mostly,” Draco shrugs, then turns the paper around and passes it over, letting Harry and Ron take a look at it. “It says here there was a break-in that day.”
Still, Draco offers an answer. “Because, to them, you are the enemy set out to disrupt their ideals. Dumbledore’s puppet, but they can’t keep track of Dumbledore like they can you.”
By the time Hagrid manages to control the nifflers Weasley is laying on his back on the ground, Potter lying beside him because he’s laughing so hard he can’t stay standing. The rest of the class, certain Weasley is okay and all is well, begin laughing too.
“Which part? The breaking into a Ministry department to illegally copy confidential files, or working with Skeeter?” Draco drawls. They were already this far in and Draco doubted Sirius would give up any time soon. This could all very well save Potter’s life and that should be enough for Sirius.
“I don’t understand, who are we waiting for? You never mentioned anyone else,” Draco hears Potter speaking in confused tones up at his godfather, who is smiling apologetically.
“Or you two can share the same room in the insane asylum,” Draco drawls. “Why are you so interested in the swamp’s secrets anyway?”
“What?” Draco snaps back, looking urgently over Max’s shoulders to see if their parents had attempted to follow. Thankfully, they were in the clear.
“You are such a show off!” Max whines, though there’s no heat behind it, just familiar teasing. “No human should be that good!”
“What are you guys doing here?” Ron attempts to whisper, but he’s much less subtle than the rest of them. Harry tries to hush him, but he isn’t listening. “
“We don’t know for certain that’s what happened, though,” Hermione argues reasonably, looking between Weasley and then Harry, who is peaking at her anxiously. “There’s too many variables we don’t know about your situation, Harry. Plus, while I don’t doubt that the Killing Curse and your mother’s love were pure sources of magic, they weren’t exactly raw.”
was wrong with Potter. That there were clues that added up to a picture Draco didn’t like. That the Wizarding World didn’t know. That the Boy-Who-Lived had only lived to be treated like something…
All three of them stand frozen in surprise, uncertain where this meeting might be going, but eventually Vivian moves to dig around in her bottomless bag and it urges Draco to pull his backpack off his shoulders and extract his and Harry’s extra Astronomy work. They hand everything in and Sinistra sets the papers to the side without looking at them, her blank gaze still on them.
Bellatrix shrieks, high pitched and painful, and Draco must still be disoriented because she manages to toss him off and into Sirius’s side, blood soaking into his white fur. Draco prepares to leap right back in, though, his world narrowing in on his enemy and his anger, but then his whole body is seizing up.
Draco was also warned that they had to be careful. Despite agreeing with You-Know-Who’s greater purpose as a whole, saying such things aloud was bound to jeopardize their family’s standings. They had to play into the public view.
The room around them also begins to shift. The plain, neutral grey splits once more into black and white, but then the black and white begin to curl and twist and writhe together. They never meld, but the whole room begins to convulse with them. The ghostly figure twitches violently, like it’s being electrocuted, then is violently torn to shreds in the air.
He still manages to get up in the morning, somehow, in an attempt to go back to his normal school schedule. It should be easy. The DA is safe. Dumbledore is still in charge. Umbridge has nothing. Edgecombe has been dealt with. Sure, the wandless lessons were probably going to be cancelled, but everything had played out the way Draco wanted it to.
“I have new sensors I set around my office. I know someone snuck into my office before and I wasn’t going to let any further pests escape,” Umbridge explains, like she’s talking about the weather, then she shoots a vicious glare back at Weasley and Longbottom. “Then, right as they were going off, these two hooligans showed up and tried to distract me.”
“There was a dark, evil wizard. Most everyone refers to him as You-Know-Who or He-Who-Shall-Not-Be-Named.”
“What?!” Harry yelps, even higher than when Draco had stomped on his foot, and when he opens his mouth to begin denying the claim Draco gives him a withering look that shuts him up.
“Does that mean you still want to knock stuff off tables sometimes?” Draco smirks and McGonagall doesn’t answer, just looks at him with a stern set to her face until the blonde ducks his head.
Which to pick? If he even wanted one… He doubted the Nubbles would be too ecstatic for him to arrive home with a new pet without their permission.
The portrait scoffs, a faint roll of her eyes that hardly makes her look improper. “Not with that man that dares retain the name of Black tromping around again, ruining the sanctity of my home, dragging in half-breeds and filth from all the darkest recesses of our crumbling society.”
Draco snorts, like he’s about to laugh, and a very, very small number of other students chuckle, but it very quickly dies out when they all realize no one else is finding this funny. Feeling a spike of panic Draco looks to Harry for an explanation. “Is he serious?”
Draco felt compressed and squeezed, like being dragged through a tube of some sort, everything trying to fit into a significantly smaller space and pulling. And then, as quickly as it all had begun, he was suddenly back to normal and could breathe again. He released McGonagall’s arm and braced himself on his knees, wheezing and panting, only half noting the breeze on his skin.
Draco shifts through the crowd as the twins continue to cause havoc, keeping Umbridge and her Squad as busy as possible. The blond makes a show of “fighting back” against some of the DA members trying to make things difficult, but he’s having a hard time keeping his grin down.
Draco would admit, he’d already forgotten the name of the particular store they’d been dragged into, because he’d immediately been distracted by
“Then make sure you, or your dad, actually deserve the job and no one will have a reason to kick you out,” Max growls back lowly.
“Knew it was a trick,” Draco mumbles to himself before gripping his cart handles tightly, taking a deep breath, then running as fast as he can towards the bricks.
“You can. You could have also done it as far away from us as possible,” Harry retorts coldly, hands clutching into fists as he stands beside Ron, the two staring down Millicent and Theodore. The twins also stand, one on either side of the two boys, looking defiant and ready to fight, and Draco, with a heavy sigh, joins them.
“Yeah, but just listening to you talk about it all…” Weasley trails off and Draco’s glare flicks to Potter when he snickers.
“Just because you’re all… besotted with the guy doesn’t mean you can drag us into it, too,” Weasley complains and Draco looks over, impressed.
“Sirius came to visit,” she explains before Draco can even open his mouth to ask, and he tries not to appear miffed that she read him so easily. “He’s been trying to get a visit ever since Harry was announced as champion.”
“Oh! That was ‘How are you?’” Hermione says eagerly, leaning around Draco to wave at Vincent before doing a motion with one hand - with her thumb up she moves it away from her chest then makes a small arch over her chest with the same hand - and says, “Good morning!”
He’s ignored, however, and Millicent continues, “You’ll definitely need it. Your own mother’s the potions master and you can’t even answer any of her questions?”
“He’s Cecil Duke, an Auror for the Ministry. He’s… actually, I don’t know why he’s here,” Draco says slowly, and Duke offers him a small smile. Draco’s never seen him smile before.
“Don’t be ridiculous, Zabini. He’s clearly a Dumbledore supporter and I would not sully the name Mal—”
“Rita Skeeter,” he says brightly, startling the woman as he continues to snap photos. Her eyes are saucers behind her bejeweled glasses, a hand flying to her wand as she realizes she has just been caught.
And then Harry’s disembodied head is flying into existence and Draco lets out a very manly shriek, only to be quieted by one of Harry’s hands covering his mouth.
“I told Harry he’d end up suffering, but he was going to like it,” Weasley grunts, waving a hand in Harry’s direction, and Harry offers a helpless shrug in return.
because you owed a guy!” he glares daggers at Potter, who glares right back. They may be on better terms, but that hardly changed that he was the most infuriating boy Draco knew. “Do you ever think it is possible to be too nice? Or too chivalrous? Or just… too Gryffindor?”
This, at least, has Potter stopping to think, biting his lip and fidgeting. Potter is stubborn, though, and Draco doubts he can change his mind in just one evening, so he lays off. “I’m not going to hound you over what to do like Granger, but at least consider what I’ve said.”
“What are you two cackling about?” Eve questions as she trots back up to them. Somehow she’s managed to balance three paper bowls of soft serve ice cream in her arms. She’d seen the cart for just a moment and had immediately hurried over without warning, leaving the boys to chat.
The flash makes Dobby yelp this time, much to Draco’s satisfaction, and the next few minutes are spent just sorting out all the little buttons and switches on the device. Draco takes pictures all over of his room and even allows Dobby to take a few, until it is time for Draco to finally go to sleep.
“And Max plays into this?” Draco questions, like he’s humoring a child, but Harry doesn’t take the bait this time. The other boy looks serious as he addresses Draco, brows lowered and shoulders set. It makes Draco pause.
This time Draco does look back, his brows furrowed in concern. He’d known about “daymares” from his Muggle family, but only a little bit. He’d experienced a few himself, as had Max, but he’d never known they were so prevalent in Eric.
“You can choose to love your relatives, let them be your family - that’s the ideal situation, don’t you think? - but, Draco… You aren’t required to agree with them because they’re your father or your mother. You aren’t obligated to follow them into their world if you disagree with it.”
Draco is just in the process of telling Sirius how he’d managed to get onto his Quidditch team in the first place, the older Gryffindor clearly offended that Draco’s father bought him his place, but both still laughing at the absurdity of the situation, when Potter comes downstairs.
A bolt of lightning crashes into the ground just a few feet to Draco’s left, making him shriek and leap away. He collides with Weasley, who’s managed to get to his feet too, and they both tumble back to the ground. The roar that echoes through the air sounds somewhere between thunder and a banshee, Draco covering his ears as he crouches on his knees.
And he doesn’t stop smiling. Not when he pulls Draco into a hug a moment later. Not when they’re sitting in the Knight Bus, trying to plan out their day. Not when they’re walking around London, snapping pictures. Not when they slip into a diner that has a dusty jukebox in the corner that looks weirdly familiar to Draco, but he can’t place why. Not on their way back to Privet Drive that evening.
Draco had not noticed, nor cared, about Sturgis Podmore when he had first shown up in the papers. He’d been caught sneaking, or attempting to sneak, into a door in a deep level of the Ministry and had been sentenced to six months in Azkaban.
it was driving Draco up the wall. Plus, there were contradictions. Some files claimed the Seers viewed the future, some claimed it was fate, and some claimed it was only a prediction. Draco was leaning towards the prediction idea himself, honestly, because some of these prophecies he was reading – which were so, incredibly old they had entered into wizarding public domain and could be written out – were so VAGUE. It sounded like the hokey fortune tellers Max had told him about in Louisiana.
He thinks, really thinks, about a time when he felt powerful, down to his core, completely justified and playing on his greater, personal purpose. A few thoughts crop up of him playing the Ministry and Umbridge like a fiddle, and while it does make him feel powerful and proud, he can tell it won’t be enough.
“Yeah,” Theodore draws out the word, “I don’t really get it, though. I overheard this Ravenclaw and Gryffindor talking just the other day about the severity of… they worded it way more impressively, but basically that it’s a big deal that we’re learning all this from a ‘gossip column,’ their words, and not our classes.”
“Alright, alright, we get it,” Weasley groans, rolling his eyes in exasperation, but then stiffens when Eve turns a glare on him, her wand still in hand. Somehow, Draco ends up dragged back in front by the ginger to make sure Eve can’t get to him.
The blonde stiffens at the way the other boy asks it, defenses flying up with a snap, and his eyes thin. Maybe it wouldn’t be so bad? Vincent and Greg had been cool, and most of the adults had been nice as well… Maybe the incident at the Leaky Cauldron, and a few of the run ins at Diagon Alley, had been random encounters. “You don’t have to whisper. Just talk normally,” he says, digging up his confident expression as best he could and keeping his voice steady, with only a touch of annoyance.
Granger and Draco had been sitting in the library on a Monday, attempting to work on homework in light of a truly dreadful article that had been published about Umbridge becoming High Inquisitor of Hogwarts. The Golden Trio, and Draco, had all been furious, and even a few of the other students at breakfast had looked uncomfortable, and Draco had glared death at the quote from his own father.
“She’s going to be happy to see you, too,” Draco says just as Columba and Tsuki coo from their cages up above. Harry and Draco smile for a moment, clearly entertained by the birds, before settling more comfortably into their seats.
“What?” he snaps, pointedly rubbing his ear when the girl finally looks up. She still doesn’t look apologetic.
“Excited for what?” he’d found himself asking, voice devoid of all feeling. His mother had been sitting there, he remembers that, watching him with her cool, carefully vacant eyes.
Rather than actually approach the real issue at hand, however, he instead says, “I resent that. Since when have I ever overthought anything?”
“Can you excuse us a moment?” Potter says back to the DA before dragging Draco away, Granger and Weasley close behind. Draco goes along with little fight, more interested to know what had bothered Potter this time. “Malfoy, what the hell?” Potter finally hisses as they all stop in a far corner of the room.
“For the time being, no one,” Draco says, standing up straight. “There was no body when I got there. At this point we do not have proof any curse was cast save my witness testimony.”
“I’ll be slipping into Snivellus’s office while everyone is down at the task and Draco will be getting into Mad-Eye’s,” Sirius explains.
“Ron! That’s amazing!” Harry exclaims as soon as Weasley’s eyes are open, the Boy-Who-Lived approaching his best friend to look at the changed eyes.
What the hell was Potter doing?! He’d ran away from the Order?! That complete and utter imbecile! He was in constant danger already! Running off without telling anyone could have been his death sentence is Eve hadn’t found him. Why would he pull something so, so stupid?!
Draco and Theodore aren’t paying much attention anymore, and when the tall, scrawny Slytherin is finally close enough, Draco reaches out to drag him closer by his arm. Maybe a bit rougher than was necessary, but Theodore had grabbed Draco first.
Issue was the following day was Monday and Mrs Nubble had work, which she never missed, and Mr Nubble would need to supervise Ada and Frederick. After some back and forth negotiating it was decided McGonagall would just need to look after Draco herself.
“That sounds like mean gossip that got twisted into something ridiculous,” Draco grunts, sitting back in his seat and slouching. He’d actually been kind of interested in what Leandra may have known.
“Yeah, but…” Now it’s Harry talking, and Draco looks to him sharply. The Boy-Who-Lived is hardly fazed by Draco’s glare, just shrugging and continuing on. “No one knows anything about centaurs, partially because of their secrecy. Ministry involvement or not, no one is really going to blame the Ministry for not getting the information out there.”
Draco huffs in faux offense, mostly just doing it for the show of it, before he’s changing anyway. He curls up against Harry’s chest, resting his head on Harry’s neck, wrapping his tail around Harry’s leg, and purring with all his might as the other boy readjusts to hug the snow leopard form just as tightly.
“A lot of people are reading these, then?” Draco also hadn’t been expecting that. He’d just wanted a few intellectuals to notice the articles and make some comments. Build up a stir. He didn’t think they would have built some kind of cult following.
“We have found their weakness,” Draco smirks back at him, pleased, and Potter’s blush momentarily resurfaces before he’s spluttering to change the subject.
Gone are the whispers. Gone are the hushed questions. It is the talk of the school, no one seeming to shut up about it, and Draco wishes he could just sit back somewhere and watch the chaos unfold.
With a silent nod Hermione leaves down the corridor, sparing the rest of them one final glance before turning around the corner.
“Alright, alright, I’m going! Pushy…” he replies before doing as he’s told and hurrying off. Harry and Ron have already set out, but they’re taking their time and Draco soon catches up to them outside, heading down a path towards a small hut on the grounds.
“Only in passing,” James repeats Draco’s phrase, still grinning, then slips past Draco to plant a kiss on his wife’s cheek. Harry makes a gagging face at the affection while Draco watches curiously. Mr. and Mrs. Nubble were not big on showing affection to each other, and Mr. and Mrs. Granger were very private, so Draco had little experience with couples and public displays of affection. Harry, apparently, had no such issue.
like me,” Max sighs and they sound so dejected. It makes something inside Draco twist uncomfortably.
“Oh dear…” Hermione says, eyes wide in her own surprise. She then glances at Draco. “They do realize they have classes to get to as well, don’t they?”
Draco does laugh at the images of himself and Potter surrounded by children at the petting pools, and then his breath catches when he finds it.
Draco cringes and Harry immediately begins to cackle under his breath. “As touching as your offer may be,” Draco begins slowly, “Please don’t attack a teacher for me.”
“And what about Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw?” Potter questions. His own eyes have hardened, just on the cusp of a glare, but not quite there yet.
A new vinyl from Eric by a band called Green Day, the record titled “Kerplunk!” and a note from Eric listing out the songs from best to worst.
“It's alright. Everyone needs practice and most people didn’t even conjure a full Patronus, so we’re going to have plenty more lessons on it,” Harry assures, offering a smile to his boyfriend.
He hears a couple people talking about it, occasionally, but he never gets a name nor a place, so he just has to keep looking.
When he hears the sound of shears snipping across the room he finally takes a deep, steadying breath and shrinks the radio, slipping it back into his pocket.
“Colin Creevey. Yes, I heard,” Draco nods. Everyone had heard, of course. The first-year, Muggleborn Gryffindor had been found frozen the night after the first Quidditch game of the season. “You were in the infirmary with that noodle arm,” Potter scowls unhappily, “so I’m sure you must have seen him?”
“I plan to infiltrate the Ministry.” Potter looks at him sharply, eyes wide in shock and momentarily forgetting he’s supposed to hate Draco right now. “I have a few suspects in mind that may have put your name in the Goblet, but I believe I could learn more from their… confidential files within the Department of Records.”
“Don’t think I didn’t see you talking to my boy earlier,” Lily continues, leaning away but keeping a hand on the blonde’s shoulder. “You’ve been such a sweet child. I am quite happy you and Harry met.”
“No… I still don’t want to open that. This was from last Christmas…” Harry says, looking away sharply and frowning at the mention of “the package.” The boy could hold a grudge, that was sure, even over things that didn’t really matter. He didn’t want to get Sirius involved, fine, but maybe the present from his godfather could be helpful? How could they know?
“She was hit by a dark spell, but we managed to interrupt it last minute. Neville thinks she’ll be fine, but she isn’t moving,” Harry explains, standing up and looking around at the Slytherins like he can’t believe they’re here, either. He’s vibrating with nerves and energy, ready for the next attacker, and when his hand curls into the fur at Draco’s shoulder it hurts a little bit.
The grin grows again, back to the original intensity, and he nods, hair bouncing with the movement. It was like every part of him was energized. “Yeah! You too, then?” Draco nods and the boy does a little hop that momentarily throws off Malkin’s work. “I’m really excited.”
Moody, or whoever the hell he really was - and Draco was beginning to think he knew who that may be - had to be regularly making and taking the potion to keep up his disguise. There was just one issue.
“Perhaps…” Draco sighs, glaring at another family of Muggle tourists as they pass by. “We will simply have to return at another time.”
“Harry! Are you--” But he doesn’t get to finish. With one more heave Harry is spitting something shiny and gold into his hands and looking at it in wonder. Draco lands a few paces away and stares in equal bafflement as the Snitch sits calmly in his friend’s palms.
It’s a little reassuring, but Draco still pouts. “I demand private tutoring. I refuse to fall behind because I had to play hero for you all.”
Draco’s groan of protest and growled, “you ruined it, Max,” are drowned out by the Muggles bright and vibrant laughter.
The shadow of the dragon’s head tilts and Draco gets the distinct feeling they are being laughed at. “I shall,” the dragon finally agrees, and the shadow begins to move in. Clouds curve around the body of the dragon as he emerges, curling around him leisurely, the storm properly subsiding as the giant creatures makes his appearance.
Slytherin sounded pretty good. Really good, actually. He knew what he wanted most of the time and went for it, using whatever he had at his disposal to do so. But, again, he had so much more to himself.
Self-consciously he looks at his hand, illogically concerned he will be able to see right through it, but Potter, still laughing, grabs it with one of his own and shakes his head.
“Would you like to know who managed to form their corporeal Patronus, Malfoy?” Granger cuts in, making the Slytherin perk up with interest. He ignores the grateful look Harry throws the Muggleborn.
“I was hoping to ask you a question, professor, but…” the blonde trails off, glancing to the side. “It isn’t a question to do with classes.”
and gives it an unhappy look, “But they’re human too. This almost makes them look like wild animals to be examined in a lab.” Draco stares at the book a moment longer, pouting, then decides to add it to his pile just so he can get a feel what the Wizarding World thinks of his upbringing. “Also, the Muggle money system is way better.” He really couldn’t let go of that last bit, could he?
“Alright, follow me. Tail up and not moving means stop. Moving up and down means come forward. Moving side to side means go back. Got it?” Draco says and waits to hear all four of them voice their understandings. He nods, trusting them to do what needs to be done, and shifts.
“I don’t know shit about possession,” Draco mumbles, pressing his face to Potter’s head, “but I know you’re not a threat. There’s no way. And if there is some way for Voldemort to mess with your head? I’ll do everything in my power to stop it.”
“Uhg, no,” Sophie growls, scrubbing at her face in frustration. Just a few feet away, in the water, Tracey’s head pokes out of the dark liquid, vines and algae already atop her head. She says nothing as she stares back at them.
“Slytherin has won the House Cup the last seven years,” Sinistra says once they’re settled, brooms set on the floor beside their chairs. “Part of this is thanks to our superior Quidditch team. I would like this trend to continue.” Sinistra pauses to take a sip of her tea. It is infinitesimal, but Draco thinks she looks a bit more relaxed.
Draco isn’t sure what that decisive action will eventually be, but he hopes it will have a less chaotic response if they cushion it with all their prior, smaller articles. Something like this was a long, drawn-out process, they couldn’t rush, because this wasn’t really about the facts anymore. It was about changing people’s opinions.
He felt ill, but this was what he’d prepped for. Worst case scenario, at least one of them could get out unnoticed and continue the fight against the Ministry as a free wizard.
The asshole-Slytherins were going insane, which meant the rest of them had to match it. Grudgingly. It was clear to anyone who knew what was going on that Draco, Pansy, Theodore, Crabbe, and Goyle were not happy with this. For the most part they took points to seem tough, but then all the houses - save Slytherin - had no more points to give, and the spells had started coming out.
“Having such a memory is the first step, but it also matters what kind of power you are pulling from,” Sinistra explains, eyes down on her Militus. She runs a single finger over the head of the cobra as she pauses. “There are different kinds of power we can feel – selfish power, selfless power, mundane power, power in hindsight, and so on – but it isn’t enough to consider
Harry is grinning in disbelief and Draco laughs in amazed delight and springing forward, hugging the other boy tight around his shoulders. “You did it!” he exclaims, leaning away, and Harry nods.
Draco is left standing there, in the middle of the corridor, with a hand coming up to touch his lips where just a few seconds ago Harry Potter had been kissing him. He doesn’t know what to say, what to do. He’s just… shocked. Shocked and… so… so incredibly, unbelievably, astonishingly
“Duh! We’re best friends! I may not agree with you all the time, but I’m still gonna stand up for you any chance I get! Then, when it’s all over and it’s just you and me, I’ll tell you how much of an idiot you are.”
“Did you know Muggles think black cats are bad luck?” a seven-year-old Draco announces proudly from where he crouches with Pansy Parkinson and Theodore Nott. Draco and Pansy had come over to the Nott estate to play with Theodore, which they and a bunch of other pureblood kids had been doing a lot lately.
“Is Harry and Granger’s love not enough?” Draco stops him dead with a growl, the ginger’s blue eyes widening and the fight very swiftly running out of him. “You mean the world to them, yet you act like it’s not enough. You need everybody’s approval, don’t you?”
He supposes he could call her his best friend. She was his ONLY friend, really, so by proxy she had to be his best friend. But he supposes he could do a lot worse.
“Well then, logistics of that notwithstanding… what did you discover over the break, Malfoy?” Granger sighs, pulling her jacket tighter around herself. Maybe Draco should have brought a blanket to sit on… but then again, he hadn’t thought they’d end up sitting on the ground.
He resists the urge to run his hands over the buzzed hair on his head, and instead hides the motion by adjusting the styled, long strands.
Snowflake slithers over his shoes, tongue flicking, almost like a comfort, and Draco smiles down at him. “Don’t tell the others,” he stage whispers down at the little, white snake, “but you’re my favorite.”
A moment later Potter is walking beside him, still grinning, and Draco makes a point of ignoring him. Potter, unaffected, shrinks down the radio and effortlessly drops it in Draco’s satchel’s side pocket.
“After we talked about defending against the Unforgivable Curses and I got upset with you offering to cast the Imperius Curse… I just wanted to put it all behind me. I’d said how to defend against the Imperius and that everything else you needed to find cover. I didn’t want to talk about it anymore, so I just… avoided it,” Harry explains, eyes flicking down to the floor.
“I’ve been considering letting other people offer some lessons,” Harry nods, voice a little vacant but more focused than before. “Everyone has different skills, so maybe different lessons could do us all some good.”
With conversation moving on Draco finds his eyes rolling over the rest of the High Table. Hagrid is throwing back his drink. He looks different in better light, more human, but still very hairy. McGonagall is speaking lowly to Dumbledore, who smiles and nods occasionally, and the man with the turban is turned away, speaking to the woman in the constellation robes. Seeming to sense his eyes on them the woman turns cold, calculating eyes towards Draco, looking at him thoughtfully and--
“These people… you just don’t understand. They’re still dangerous,” he tries to get Max to understand. Max may be a Muggle, but a Muggle that minds their own business. Not like Muggleborns. “Mudbloods,” his father had said.
dirty about it, if it was possible. He had always rubbed Draco the wrong way, and this just cemented his image in Draco’s mind.
“Really! We just want to talk!” he tries again. Rain has begun to fall, splattering his face like knives, and he squints against the onslaught.
“Oh, well, hand me over to Neville, then,” Eric says and Draco shoves the radio to Longbottom, even though the gangly boy is shaking his head frantically.
He flicks his tail up and down and can hear the careful, quick footsteps of his friends behind him. A hand peaks out from under the cloak, it looks like Eve’s, and they open the door into the Entrance Chamber and all hurry in.
“Oh, no, not at all,” Draco shakes his head, closing the next door when all it reveals is a room filled with floating orbs of water everywhere. “Many rooms connect to each other, and some must be reached by going through one of the other rooms, first, such as—Aha!” Draco turns back towards Weasley triumphantly, holding open the door.
Both Draco and Skeeter look down as Sirius comes running, shifting from dog to human fluidly, and calls up at them, “Harry says Bagman’s headed our way! Hurry up and get the last documents!”
Yes, that’s probably the best idea he’s got going for him, he just has to reach her office and get her attention, which he might be able to do if he…
Despite looking out of place, however, he is still perhaps the most welcome sight Draco’s had in a while, and the blonde smiles and moves towards his bed. Harry looks up as he arrives but doesn’t even get a word out before Draco is flopping down, face first, on top of the covers.
“I just… want to know what they say, you know,” Draco was saying. He wore a big sunhat on his head, given to him from Mr Nubble, to protect his pale skin from the sun, and too-large gardening gloves covered his hands. “I don’t have to respond to them or anything. I can just read them then throw them away. Is that too much to ask?”
A week later Draco ends up laying on the floor of the Astronomy Tower, laughing so hard he’s dropped the radio, as Max explains that Eric has taken his whole “mother bird” thing a little too far.
“I know the Swollen Tongue Hex, you know. How long do you think that leaf would stay in your mouth with a bulbous tongue hanging out?”
realized his own feelings for Harry? Him and Granger, anyway. Even the younger students had noticed.
Blaise shuts his eyes and takes a deep, calming breath, attempting to center himself. “’Stayin’ Alive’ again, huh? I’m afraid that has little effect on me anymore, I’ve grown quite fond of it thanks to you.”
“Please don’t patronize me,” Weasley sighs miserably, but still goes for a large slurp of tea while he mopes.
“Yes, I’m Draco Malfoy,” he replies. He wasn’t a fan of the redhead’s tone, but he couldn’t exactly place why, yet. It was unnerving. “Here, this is my scar,” he pulls down his shirt like he’d done so many times before, expecting the other boy would ask eventually, and Ron gasps, mouth hanging open. Harry is smiling.
“Thank you, Hermione,” Draco smiles, trying to show just how grateful he was to her, right as the walkie-talkie crackles to life. All three startle and Draco nearly drops the device as he pulls it out. They listen as Vivian’s disjointed voice filters over the connection. She hadn’t been wrong when she said the thing was garbage…
Crabbe and Goyle couldn’t catch a break. Draco hardly noticed them much anymore, they were just always on the edge of his periphery. They made good guards, keeping away any undesirables, and they also were good for Draco to rant to, but most of the time Draco went to Max for any form of substantial conversation.
“Can you cast it?” he asks, and Sinistra tilts her head. She considers something for a moment, then nods again and waves her hand. The furniture and items and decorations covering the center of her office all begin to move, settling themselves neatly against the walls, and leaving plenty of room in the very middle. “Didn’t realize you had a carpet…” Draco mumbles, eying the gaudy, faded, rainbow carpet.
Pansy and Blaise immediately snort, apparently the idea of Draco becoming a dragon far funnier than it should be. “What did Eve think you’d be?” Pansy asks.
They glance over at Luna in stunned wonder, before Leandra says, cheerfully, “No wonder you’re in Ravenclaw, Luna!” Luna offers the chipper girl a serene, thankful smile, but says nothing more.
Draco considers that. It wouldn’t do for anyone to find him with a Time-Turner he wasn’t meant to have. He was supposed to be the trustworthy eyewitness in this equation and something like that would paint him in a very poor light. Worse, it would surely set his father on him.
It had been a normal exam, all things considered. Hermione kept scrubbing a hand through her hair, making it a mess. Weasley kept making signs with his hand to try and remember what he’d studied. Both Crabbe and Goyle had their heads cradled in their hands in defeat. Daphne was sitting, perfectly still, and staring at her exam like it had been written in a different language.
“No,” Theodore is still humming and Millicent is smirking viciously over his shoulder. Beside them, however, Pansy is beginning to look a little anxious, but Draco really couldn’t care about her right now. “No, I don’t think I will. UP!” Suddenly Theodore’s forgotten broom shoots into his hand and he’s mounting it, pushing up and floating into the air. Draco doesn’t know what a graceful flier should look like, but he doesn’t think it’s Theodore.
The other Slytherin Beater, some boy with the unfortunate name Matthew Matthews, smirks at him from a distance and calls, “Game ain’t over yet!”
When the owls come flying in with their mail as they are finishing up their breakfast it is with the pleasant surprise that Tootsie is among them. She flies over them, dropping first an envelope in front of Hermione, then landing in front of her owner.
“As I said, once we have sufficient information, print whatever you please. In addition… any further stories you may have, every possible article you want to print, you will run it by me first.”
Harry snorts, derisive and self-deprecating, and sags in his seat. “No… Not really. I got mad and saw something I shouldn’t have.”
McGonagall was furious, Snape was furious, Dumbledore, who arrived not long after, was furious despite how calm he seemed. And Fudge kept refusing to believe that the greatest threat wizarding kind had faced in modern years had truly returned.
Potter doesn’t say a word. He just keeps his head down, hands curled tightly around his mug, his body clearly shaking.
Slytherin has two, new Beaters in the forms of Crabbe and Goyle. They’re dreadful fliers, but their brute strength makes up for it in their positions. And, with Beater bat still raised, Draco spots Crabbe floating some ways away.
“I can respect his desires to better the reputations of magical beasts,” Draco begins to rant, facing forward. Hagrid’s hut is visible just ahead. “But there is a difference between being an ally to their cause and acting like they’re harmless.”
“That’s really impressive. Both of you,” he says sincerely, his smile of amazement never leaving his face. “If you’re willing, you can lead today’s lesson. I was going to have us continue working on our Patronus and Militus Charms -” since Easter Sophie had managed to summon a frilled lizard Patronus, Johnson a cheetah Patronus, and Smith a bat Militus “- but I think this could do us some serious good.”
“Then they have failed as parents,” Max’s mother says firmly. She sounds like she wishes she could reach out and hold Draco, and Draco wishes she could, too. “It is a parent’s job to love and nurture. To give their children a better life than they had. Regurgitating the same, inane traditions and requirements they lived by will not bring about growth or satisfaction.”
“You might not want to tell anybody, though,” Blaise cuts in, sounding like he’s already over this discovery. “It’s associated with Salazar Slytherin and snakes, so of course it’s got a bad reputation.”
“Are you Tracey Davis? Draco told me about you,” Luna asks, head tilting to one side. Today she’s wearing earrings that have water droplets at the ends of them and a necklace made of bottlecaps.
When Moody does eventually appear, walking up to Dumbledore the second he steps onto the pitch, the two men speak lowly. Moody looks as grumpy as he always does, no suspicious activity, and after a few hushed words the DADA professor moves to the stands that house the rest of the faculty.
Conversation seemingly coming to a close, Potter takes a few steps back in the direction of the castle. There is no way to know how they should truly end this. This is the longest they’ve ever managed to speak to each other without biting the other’s head off, and they’d come close a few times. Was there even a civil way to end a conversation like that? If there was a guide somewhere, Draco didn’t have it.
“It means you can talk to snakes,” Blaise offers, not getting off his bed but leaning forward, eye flicking between Draco and Muddy. “It’s, like, a really rare characteristic. Usually it’s passed down through families.”
“Have I ever told you how jealous I am that you don’t have Religion class at your school?” Max asks one rainy day in the April of Draco’s third year, the raindrops making tinging, rhythmic noises on the roof of the Hogwarts greenhouses.
“And the sun is hot and the night is dark. Are you going to sit down, already, or just keep stating the obvious?” The sarcastic tone seems to do something to Potter, because he just seems to sag, before sliding into the seat beside Draco without another word.
you waste my time like that,” Skeeter demands, pulling her tacky, purple fur-lined, turquoise robes tightly around herself as she shivers and makes her way towards a fireplace the room has provided. “I thought we were going to get straight to work. Why did you drag me around Hogsmeade running your… silly little errands like that?”
It is the night before Easter Sunday when Draco is awoken by the sound of a scream. He’d fallen asleep at a weird angle, going back over some of the documents after changing into his powder blue, silk pajamas and climbing into bed, and now his neck hurt something fierce.
“Mr. Malfoy,” Madam Pomfrey says firmly, appearing by his bedside, her expression stern. “Glad to see you awake again. You passed out, but thankfully not due to blood loss nor a concussion.”
“I beg your pardon?” Draco turns startled, disbelieving eyes on the other boy, who shrugs right back.
The issue is Potter has no skill with taking down something like a dragon. The closest thing he has had to deal with before was the basilisk, but he’d had all kinds of back-up then and a very unique set of circumstances.
“Never-you-mind, handsome. Just know that I have my ways,” Skeeter hums, then sets the form to the door. As soon as it is in contact with the rusty metal the paper glows green before disintegrating, falling through Skeeter’s hands like sand, and a lock can be heard clicking open from within. Skeeter pulls open the door with ease, despite how heavy it looks, and all three of them swiftly step inside.
If Ebru had been telling the truth and insinuating what Draco thought she was insinuating, this pin was Draco’s ticket into the Records Department. Whenever he wanted!
A wet huff of laughter comes through the radio, followed by a sniffle and a clearing of Max’s throat. “Oh, uh… It’s a Native American term for someone who isn’t a boy or a girl. It’s kinda this umbrella term? Mama taught me it a few years ago… It felt so right…”
“I’m fine! I told you I’m fine! Once I get everything sorted out it’ll be fine!” Max’s voice screeches in the background.
“Excuse me?” Draco questions, not understanding the request or the reason behind Potter’s current presentation.
“What is it, dear?” Mr Nubble questions, noting his wife’s mounting confusion. The question draws all of the kids’ attentions and Mrs Nubble shakes her head and looks entirely at the letter.
“Time is a human construct, mom. Don’t let it confine you,” Eric says in reply, looking far too serious.
“Outside,” Weasley says, voice rough and low. Not quite a whisper, but clearly too spooked to speak much louder. “There’s… There’s people outside. A crowd. They’re moving straight towards us.”
“And Uncle Severus threw a hissy fit in response. As he does,” Draco snarls, looking towards the closed door as if his godfather were just on the other side. “Surely Dumbledore wouldn’t agree with this. As dreadful a choice as Snape might be, you still need the lessons.”
“You would know,” Granger grumbles and Draco rolls his eyes skyward. He really wanted this table, damn it. It was perfectly hidden away from everyone else and got the best light.
If they couldn’t get what Draco had asked for, he would survive. They weren’t required for his plan, but they would be helpful. He’d had this plan in mind ever since the Yule Ball, when he’d spotted Barty Crouch on Potter’s Marauders Map, but it was a bit of a long shot.
“That sounds very unlike you,” Draco purses his lips, eying Sirius skeptically, but the older man just chuckles in defeat.
“Move quickly and quietly, people, come on!” Gemma sounds more like a military sergeant than anything.
“It’s hard to tell,” Max admits, “But I think he found one of the baby birds under his back tire… Or, I guess… what was left?”
“Mad?” questions a girl to Draco’s right named Tracey Davis, her expression half hidden behind a curtain of brown hair, but still bored yet entertained at the same time.
“Trace can’t pick up a few things. Most magical transportation, for one,” Draco explains, releasing Potter’s wrist and turning towards his door. He opens it and waits for Potter to join him. “Care to grab the Knight Bus?”
“Yeah, I guess…” Harry shrugs, looking mildly distressed as he keeps glancing at the doors to the Great Hall, looking frantic like he always does when they hurry to the Gryffindor table and everything begins to slip into place for Draco.
” Then, she taps the tip of her wand to her own cheek and abruptly her face is lighting up with specks of light. They twinkle across the bridge of her nose, and the skin around them takes on a bluish-black hue.
Eric eyes him before snorting. “You may have fooled my family, kid, but a punk will always recognize a punk.”
“Plus, plus, plus!” Max suddenly springs forward, eyes sparkling with excitement as they remember something important. Draco takes a cautious step away, uncertain of the young Muggle’s enthusiasm. “Papa told me this, too, and I remembered that the astronauts put these mirror do-hickeys up on the moon so when you shine a laser at them they’ll bounce back at you!”
Potter had, in one of these moments, finally gotten to meet Max’s mother and father, who spoke so sweetly to Potter when they’d learned he’d been witness to a fellow student’s death. The Muggles had been told it was an accident, the only time they would be willing to pretend that was true, and when all was said and done Potter had been so emotional, he couldn’t leave the Astronomy Tower for nearly an hour.
Eric doesn’t appear to care much about any of this, scoffing at most everything his father tries to show him, but Max’s mother thankfully appears to pick up on Draco’s unease.
“We aren’t going to tell your mom, Neville,” Ron rolls his eyes, then looks down at Draco and Harry. “We aren’t going to tell anyone.” Then, with a snap, the ginger turns his blue gaze on Hermione, eyes narrowing. “Right?”
“Uh, ‘we’?” Draco demands, even as he follows after the other boy. He keeps an eye on Theodore’s steps, noting how they wobble on occasion but he remains upright. He should probably go see Madam Pomfrey…
“Proof?” Draco arches a brow, confused why Snape would come to him with this. Then, like a bolt of lightning, it hits him and he narrows his eyes. “This is because of last year, when I proved Sirius Black’s innocence, isn’t it? You did not take it so well.”
They make decent progress getting rid of all the decorations together when Luna and Tracey come in. Draco is back up in the rafters, removing some of the tinsel that had little lightning bolts hanging from them, when Luna says, “Oh look. Mistletoe.”
“The way Sirius says it… they didn’t much care about family. More about status, which was usually linked to family by default…” Harry explains and then looks away. “There was… Andromeda Tonks. She would have been your mom’s sister. Sirius mentioned her, she was disowned for who she married, and…” Harry bites his lip then looks up at Draco, eyes wet and sad, making the blonde take a step back. “Her and her husband were killed by You-Know-Who’s followers after… after your parents…”
Instead he stares at his feet, waiting for the Entrance Chamber to settle, tense from the atmosphere that still swirls around much like the walls. Draco can only think of one way to break it…
After hearing so much from Hermione about what to expect from her intensive reading Draco didn’t feel too bad zoning out for a moment and looking around. Hermione was hanging off every word from the professor’s mouth while Neville looked oddly nervous, still clutching his toad. Vincent and Greg look like they are trying to listen, but aren’t paying the closest attention. A few paces to the side the tall boy and fat girl that had snickered at Greg are joined by a lanky girl with short, black hair and sharp eyes, her expression somehow both glued to McGonagall while also flicking around the room. A tall boy with dark skin and closely shaved, black hair stands off to the other side, looking to be trying to avoid everyone, his arms crossed and expression closed off. Harry and Ron are in the back, paying close attention to McGonagall like they are being briefed on a mission.
“Pretty common,” Leandra says, “I don’t think I know of any pureblood family that doesn’t have something they pass down, although not all of them are magic. Sometimes it’s clothes or a normal book or a photo. Something with sentimental value.”
“I’m not already?” Draco smiles sweetly. Hermione rolls her eyes at that while Vivian barks a laugh at Ron’s reddening face.
“Most of the others reacted so poorly to the Slytherin students… I’m not sure how well they would take this,” Granger says honestly.
“A bezoar is a stone found in the stomach of a goat,” he begins, then pauses and his brows furrow, “I think it can save you from poison?”
“They’re lessons would be far too long if they attempted to use every method for every lesson,” Draco had argued, perfectly reasonable, but Harry had kept frowning.
They hardly slept, wanting to get so much done, and their grades began to suffer. They were crabby and stressed and randomly started crying to Draco over the tiniest things going wrong.
“’These people’ are mooching off of the system because they refuse to do something productive with their lives. They cause more issues than they’re worth. If we take away these so-called benefits that spoil them so much, it will be an incentive for them to get out and actually do something for society.”
The secrets were frustrating, but necessary, and hardly bothered Draco like they did Potter. He wasn’t directly affected by them, after all, and it wasn’t his own best friends who were having to keep silent. In addition, Draco had the benefit of a mission to keep him occupied, he didn’t have all summer to just sit around in a trash Muggle neighborhood with nothing to do but think.
“That’s not it at all. If, and likely when, the DA is found out, since I’m meant to be on the Ministry’s side, I cannot leave a paper trail. I have other things to worry about too, you see.”
“You’re right… I’m sorry…” Granger says slowly, her hands fidgeting with the corner of her book anxiously. Blessed silence seems to finally be acquired, but Granger doesn’t seem eager to just drop everything already. “That’s a good book choice.”
“I did,” the professor replies, pulling out her wand and showing it to Draco. It was smooth and straight, made of dark wood, with a slightly lighter handle. It looked very elegant, if Draco was being honest, and he couldn’t wait for his own. Did they all look the same? Did they not? How did one even make wands?
“Why is she asking for a husband, though…?” Draco asks, something not quite adding up. “I thought you preferred women?”
He’d received another package from Max’s family filled with a new pile of Muggle books, a vinyl record for the Ramones album “Acid Eaters,” a device called a Walkman with tons of “cassettes,” and a substantial amount of American candy.
“I named this one Lucky,” Draco says quietly, and Theodore looks at him, wide-eyed, then back at the thestral with the scar over its left eye.
Umbridge begins interrogating Harry like this is a casual ordeal, but with every answer she grows more sporadic.
“Oh, I intend to,” his father finally lowers his newspaper to smile at his son. It’s a small, thin movement and looks more like a smirk, but it means the world to Draco. “But these things take time. It is a game of patience and strategy.”
“You could be sorted into it, wear that gaudy yellow and black, and be their queen bee, or something. The dreaded Queen Granger, ruler of the mob.” Oh, now Hermione was holding her face in her hands, groaning at him but still giggling like a loon. Yes, Draco feels like he won this one.
But then the boy is smiling again, shaking himself out, again throwing off Malkin’s pinning, and laughs. “Oh, yeah! They’re really old and apparently drift slightly to the left, but they’re there. Dad’s taken me out flying a couple times, but mom doesn’t like him teaching me anything crazy.” The boy pouts at that last part, looking away as he probably remembers some incident, then turns back to Draco and smiles. This boy was just all smiles, wasn’t he? It was a little unnerving. Like a sweeter Ada, which sounded rather wrong.
but it looks like Potter might be pulling ahead. A dark shadow passes in front of them, but Draco is too hyper-focused on the Snitch and Potter’s hand is slipping back, the perfect opportunity, and Draco’s own encircles around the golden ball.
Umbridge taps her fingers against her desk in consideration, circling around it slowly to take a quiet, measured seat into her desk chair. She leans back, eyes narrowed, as she observes the fuming, shaking Harry, snarling at her like a caged beast.
“O-Oh, right… those…” Potter mumbles, his usual confidence while in the DA dwindling at the subject. It had to be a sore subject for him, it was for a lot of them, but… Tracey had a point. With dark wizards at their doorstep, and with incompetent DADA teachers the last few years, it would be important to know what to do.
Sophie, Hermione, and Weasley were awake, much to everyone’s relief. Sophie kept nodding off, but Pomfrey had assured them it was just an aftereffect of the curse she’d been put under. Hermione was going over the potions she’d be needing to take to recover, and Weasley was getting a step-by-step from his sister of all the stupid stuff he’d done.
“Prophecies are personal things. We record most information, but the prophecy can only be heard by the one it pertains to, and it can be passed on by that witch or wizard if they so please,” Mr. Davis explains.
“In her perspective it will be the Ministry that ruins her life, allowing someone like myself, or Dumbledore, to swoop in and pick up the pieces. Having a former Records Department employee on our side will surely be beneficial to us as well.”
Draco had private tutors. Every kid he knew had them. They didn’t teach him magic, though, but they showed him. He couldn’t wait to get his wand and start doing magic himself, but that was still years away.
“We’re going to the Ministry,” he says, digging out his father’s floo powder to drop into each of their hands. “Harry is walking into a trap, and I worry the Order won’t have enough time to pull them out. We’re going to stay stealthy and hidden as best we can.”
Potter examines Draco for a moment, like he’s seeing the blonde in some strange, new light, and Draco hates it. “No… I suppose you’re not. You’re just as human as me.” Draco hums in absent agreement, looking around at the trees that surround them. “Still a complete knob, though.”
Harry looks at Draco apologetically before he moves back to his spot he’d already claimed by Ron, occasionally glancing over at the blonde with pinched, worried eyes. Slowly Draco takes a seat on the ground, like most everyone else has done, and Hermione sits beside him, close but thankfully not saying anything. Greg and Vincent also move towards them, sitting nearby.
Draco looks away, chewing the inside of his mouth. His first thought is Hagrid’s hut, but Draco isn’t so sure if the Groundskeeper would turn them in or not. He liked Hagrid quite a bit, but he didn’t know him like Harry did. The only people he trusted here were Harry and Hermione…
“Worrywart,” Potter stage whispers from across the room, and smiles innocently when Draco glares over at him.
He’d pulled files on all the professors at Hogwarts, mostly as a precaution, when he’d been in the Records Department. Most said everything he already knew, and he’d avoided them unless he felt suspicious of them. These were his teachers and most, if not all, were probably innocent. It wouldn’t do to make things awkward unless he had to.
“That’s dreadful!” Granger exclaims, affronted by Leandra’s explanation, but Leandra can only give her a shrug.
“I’ll certainly survive,” Draco drawls, looking around at all of them. His eyes linger on their hands, where he sees prominent, red wounds. Fuck. “What about you all?”
“Hey, Nev,” Max will usually begin and pause long enough for Longbottom to meander closer to Draco and the radio. “Do you think mirrors reveal the truth… or show the lie?”
After a while, the twins announce an address for their new, permanent shop location. Students cheer out at them as they do so, ignoring the furious Slytherins around them, and Draco, in the midst of the confusion and chaos, just can’t resist himself.
Potter is crouching beside him a moment later, hand coming up to grab one of Draco’s shoulders in a vice. “Malfoy, are you okay?” he asks urgently and Draco waves him off dismissively.
“Seems unfair to expect someone to have control over something they have no control over,” he says, sounding conversational but also decisive. “Weren’t you the one that told me Slytherin was fine?”
Granger shifts to raise her wand, smiling despite the severity of the entire evening, and says cheerfully, “I’ve always been quite talented with memory charms.”
She was still upset about him doing all of this without expert help, was still upset he was unregistered, and it was only due to Dumbledore that Draco was being allowed to continue in this way. It seemed a small compromise for Draco to go to her seemingly-useless classes, but he’d allow it. It wouldn’t hurt to hear from a fellow Animagus, after all.
There were screams all around him, horrifying things, as people ran for their lives, swiftly turning into a stampede. Someone had nailed Draco right across the temple in their hurry, knocking him to the ground, and dazing him something dreadful.
“So can I,” he replies. It felt wrong having anyone else pick up this particular mess. Every single Muggle product in the entire mansion was Draco’s. The cameras, the photo album, the satellite radio, the punk vinyl records. They were Draco’s and they were his responsibility.
“He does seem eager for an excuse to get out of his house,” Granger agrees, looking a little downcast.
The room is tiny, smaller than most of the other offices, and cluttered with all kinds of knick-knacks and decorations. Medallions of varying types of medals and jewels dangle from the ceiling, shelves are stacked with books and scrolls and memorabilia. Every available surface has some kind of item covering it, be it more books, a handmade tea set, a plush rabbit, a sextant, a series of masks, and much more. There is a massive window off to one side with a telescope propped up in front of it, and across the room from that is a fireplace, a charmed, indigo fire crackling within.
“We can use those…” Draco says slowly, bringing a hand up to his chin in consideration. The Death Eaters wouldn’t know how to tell the records apart, after all.
“What? Did you actually forget?” Draco scoffs, but then Potter glances away. Nothing more is said, so Draco sighs and drops it. Whatever the reason is, Potter doesn’t appear up to talking about it. “Oh, very well, since you asked so nicely,” he says over dramatically, finally getting Potter to look up, “I suppose you may accompany me today.”
“Not according to that hat,” Draco shrugs, hoping the nonchalant yet blunt approach would work for him here.
Then it is finally time for dinner and Draco groans. “I hardly even flew today,” he whines, not caring how childish he sounds. His foul mood was still lingering but now he had nothing specific to aim it at. Especially after Vivian had stayed with him and helped him out so much. He could be angry with her later, but not while she was being so nice.
Crouch Jr. broke free of his control at the World Cup, however, and had cast the Dark Mark into the sky. He’d then been rescued by his “master” and Peter Pettigrew. From there they plotted a way to get to Potter and use him in the resurrection of the Dark Lord himself.
Max hesitates, Draco can actually hear their uncertainty, before they sigh miserably. “Is there nothing he can do? Maybe talk to someone of higher authority?”
Draco also hears… voices? Distant murmurs without any proper cadence or vocalization, like a distant crowd. It is the only sound in the room save their own groans of pain, everything else hauntingly quiet.
“He was like a furry noodle,” Potter snickers, offering no help at all, but Draco has to be at least a little bit grateful he didn’t go blabbing about what Draco had seen. Not even to his two, closest friends.
“What?” Draco blinks a few times in surprise. His grip on Potter’s wrist loosens some, his fingers a loose hook around the appendage. “Why…? I thought… Granger always went on and on about getting you and Chang together…”
He leans towards Weasley, attempting to distract himself, and sniffs around his mouth before leaning away with a nod. “Well, you certainly don’t smell like you’re eating shit anymore, so I suppose you must have finally pulled your head out of your ass.”
Right now, however, Draco does not know these things and all he sees is the Boy Wonder shaking, void, and being held together by his godfather.
“It” is a photo of the tunnel, Draco and Potter standing side by side. Draco’s looking up at the water, lights making his hair and face glow strangely, a dopey, amazed expression on his face as he watches. Standing beside him, Potter has a very similar expression on his face, but his focus isn’t on the tank at all.
Draco doesn’t know who moves first, if he drags Potter down or if Potter moves down himself, but a second later they are both on the floor, Potter curling both her arms around Draco’s neck and burying his face against Draco’s throat. Draco pulls the shivering boy into his lap with no further hesitation, holding on tight to Potter’s waist and not letting go any time soon.
“I was actually thinking we could revisit that chat we had about the Militus Charm,” Draco says, smiling like a politician when Granger turns a sharp look on him.
The boy stares at him for a moment before nodding to himself yet again and grinning. “Yep, I had a feeling. You must be muggleborn,” he says confidently and Draco arches a brow at him. No, he wasn’t. He was apparently pureblooded, according to McGonagall, he was only raised by Muggles. Except… the other boy couldn’t possibly know that. He probably made the assumption thanks to Draco’s near nonexistent knowledge.
Usually, if there is crying involved over the radio, it is Draco’s own. He was a crier, he could admit that now, but only around these Muggles, it seemed. They hardly judged him like other purebloods did and they were a relaxing force for Draco.
“Oh, what a sweet gesture,” the official coo’s, “Could I get a name so I can put you into our visitor records?”
“The native term is ‘Long,’ but Lung Dragon is not incorrect,” Huang-Jun replies. What Draco had swiftly learned from speaking to Huang-Jun was that he was remarkably eager to share as much information with them as he possibly could. He likely had never had a respectful audience, judging by all the horror stories he’d recounted of his time here, locked up in the Ministry.
“Okay, well… What about tea leaves? That was always an easy enough practice, yes?” Leandra urges, clearly trying to give the boys some confidence and failing miserably.
“He also isn’t here and can get over himself,” Draco snaps but shivers when something cold seems to pass over him. The ghost that had been covered in silver blood floated through Draco, the table, and Millicent before looking back at them. He is a dour, horrible looking man, and he looks at Draco as if in warning.
“No room, my ass,” Potter responds instinctively, smirking when Draco scowls, then sits down beside him. “Are you seriously reading a textbook right now?”
A few more moments pass, Draco moving to stands with Hermione and Neville, the latter keeping right in the center of the tower and away from the edge, and they quietly watch everyone around them. Draco recognizes the Patil twins talking together, Lavender standing nearby, and Greg and Vincent keep moving between looking over the edge and asking Neville if he wants to join them. It seems after their first introductions at the Hogwarts Express the two, large wizards had taken a particular liking to Neville and Hermione, but seem particularly fond of the boy. Draco suspects it is because they share a dorm. That or they want to protect the chubby, cowardly boy. Draco wouldn’t be surprised.
“What?” Draco questions when no one seems willing to say anything. Harry audibly gulps, working his mouth as he tries to figure out what to say. Theodore beats him to the punch.
Because Harry looks more at peace than he ever has before, mouth hanging open in slumber and a trail of drool rolling down his cheek and into his hair. He still clings to Draco, but one of his arms has come up at a weird angle and his leg has been thrown over Draco’s hip.
The other boy stares at it with open curiosity, his eyes wide as he looks at the device. “A radio?” he questions, just to make sure, and Draco nods. “I suppose I should have guessed it was Muggle-related.”
“And you three went to see him like the good, little children you are,” Draco hums, stepping back from the trio so he can address all three of them properly.
He cries for nearly the entire day, locked up in his room, and while most of Slytherin doesn’t fully understand why he would be so upset over this, Draco and Pansy make sure to sit with him through it all.
“Mean gossip?” Granger looks over, one eyebrow raised. “I thought purebloods were worshipped in wizarding society. Unless the Kader family is considered blood-traitors, too?”
For the past few weeks, when nothing seemed to happen following the article on Barty Crouch’s murder, Draco began to feel a little desperate. He was still incredibly suspicious of Alastor Moody, but he’d hardly changed at all. No fear. No acting out. No panicking. Nothing.
“It would appear so,” Draco nods, hands clasped behind his back. “Political climate as it may be, it would be rude to not greet my cousin,” he then begins to walk in Sirius’s direction, but not before he hears a snort from Blaise.
“Why were you there, Potter?” Draco hisses lowly. “You ran away from the Order. You put yourself in danger for no good
“Did you know sharks have sensors on their noses that force them to bite down when touched? Or that killer whales are actually dolphins? Or that a mother Surinam toad hatches her eggs inside of her back? What about that koalas have fingerprints that look like people’s?”
Draco had seen it in his mind, right as he was transforming, exactly what he was becoming. It was a little shocking to think about, he’d been expecting something smaller like everyone had been saying. He’d never expected to be… well…
“Do you think she won’t be happy?” Draco asks, his dark mood lifting and replaced by a striking sense of unease.
Maybe it was because of his trip as a ferret, but it doesn’t take him too long to begin reassembling his mind into his new body, at least becoming conscious enough to look up at a wide-eyed Eve. She’s taller than him now, but not as drastic as when he’d been a ferret. He feels big and powerful, but compact.
Pansy, across from Draco, picks up his posture and glances back. When she spots the table in red she sneers and turns back. “How much you want to bet they’re talking about the house cup?” she huffs with a roll of her eyes. Draco remembers reading about the house cup. Every house earned points throughout the year to eventually have one crowned the victor at the end. It seemed like an honest form of competition.
He has no idea who manages to get him to his feet and start moving him in the direction of the castle. Someone manages to get the Snitch out of his good hand, however, so at least there’s one less thing to think about.
“What if she’s going to the toad’s office?” Fred whispers urgently as they maneuver through the halls, the two Gryffindors flanking Draco to keep him out of sight of curious eyes, making it just seem like the twins were walking the halls, and Draco keeps his heightened senses trained on the Ravenclaw’s jittery footsteps.
He has to continuously slap at Potter’s hand, though, whenever he goes to snatch any of his chocolate.
Potter watches Draco’s hand fall back to his side, silent, and the pureblood waits patiently for some kind of reaction. He’d been expecting joy and gratitude, but Potter just looked thoughtful now.
Draco stiffens, hands tightening around the radio and eyes widening. “N-nothing is… wrong with me! What’s wrong with you?”
“Harry didn’t,” Ron points out, clearly accepting the idea that Harry was altered by the clashing of Love and Death.
Draco grinds his teeth and snarls. “These… vermin are overrunning the Ministry. Perhaps it is only a few hundred… ‘dollars’ now, but what of later? What happens then?”
“Excuse me! I wear glasses!” Potter yelps, voice cracking a little, and Draco has to set the radio down before he drops it, laughter making him double over.
Terry, despite the frightening appearance, is grinning and excited to show Draco and Potter around. “Why not start simple with some T-shirts?  Any bands you like?”
“Harry, I’m serious. What if this is all a trick from Voldemort?” Hermione questions, likely not for the first time, but Harry shakes his head, grinding his teeth in frustration.
“He woke up screamin’ bloody murder,” Weasley says and Potter cringes, ducking his head even further.
The fifth year boy’s dorm is hauntingly silent without the students, but he swallows his discomfort and waits for their return. He paces, stands, sits, fidgets, mumbles. He’s hardly even conscious of his actions until he stubs his toe on Thomas’s bed.
When they get to the aquarium the building within is dimly lit with families milling about. It doesn’t seem to be a high tourist spot, but it does seem popular with local groups.
“Give us the prophecy, Mr. Potter,” Lucius says coolly, somehow speaking over Longbottom’s wails and Bellatrix’s high laughter. Lucius’s hand is outstretched, a small smirk playing on his face, and Harry glances back at him in terror.
Harry and Ron give him blank looks and Draco quickly realizes his mistake. “Scooby-Doo?” Harry repeats.
“I’ll bring the notes I’ve gathered on it to our next study meeting,” Draco agrees, his smile a little softer. He knew that learning the Militus Charm wasn’t a favor to him, it was something that could truly benefit them all, but he still felt honored, like he was finally being listened to. Harry, seemingly sensing this, smiles back at him.
Oh… Oh! Right, the kiss. Merlin, yes Draco desperately wanted to talk about that, but not now. Not with how upset and out of sorts both of them were. Neither of them were in any condition to be talking about something like that right now.
He retreats to the back of the classroom, silent, and hardly pays attention to the rest of class. Most everyone else’s fears are bugs or clowns or vampires. Why did Draco’s have to be so… different?
The smile drops from Draco’s face as he realizes exactly what he has just invited upon himself. Potter is looking at him very strangely. “Uhh…” but the bespectacled boy can’t get anything out, because Max is trucking on ahead.
“You’re really going to do my hair for me?” Draco questions, sceptical but curious. He slips off his nice jacket and button up, grabbing a t-shirt instead, then drapes the towel over his shoulders. He doesn’t sit down yet, though, instead eying Sophie as she unloads her bag.
“They ignore the Trace for students during the school year, even during breaks, since they’re constantly surrounded by magic and it would be pointless,” Draco explains.
The effects ripple through Hogwarts for days to come. People approach Harry and apologize, though some still accuse him of being a liar. The trust in the Ministry, and Umbridge, further crumbles away, some students even demanding answers in their Defense Against the Dark Arts classes. They usually get detention, but it’s a start…
He cries. He cries for his cousin, he cries for his friends, he cries for his family, he cries for himself. He cries.
Draco shifts to rub the side of his face against Potter’s hair, like a giant housecat, and the boy’s words end on a sob, but no crying follows. So, because he isn’t exactly sure what else he can do, Draco begins to purr. It is loud like a motorboat, but something about it must put Potter at ease, because slowly his body begins to slacken, shaking fading, until he’s asleep once more.
“Mama’s sending me to camp in July,” Max is saying. They’d already talked about the difference in school years from one country to the other, plus differences in amounts of summer work, and were not moving onto personal matters.
One of them is shaking, but Draco isn’t sure who, and it feels so foreign and surprising, but so incredibly right and perfect and… it is over far sooner than it should be, with Potter releasing Draco and backing up quickly like he’s been burned.
“Guard dogs, then, whatever!” Max huffs, “I’m glad you have someone to help you. Now, where was I…? Oh, yeah! So, take painkillers, stretch when you can, and when you go back in for a follow up I want to know how the tissue around the socket looks! If there are any tears I have a few other notes.”
“Listen, Nev, I get it,” Eric speaks, voice soft in a way he so rarely is, “The world is scary. Things you aren’t familiar with are scary. Judgement is scary. And they’re scary not because you don’t know what will happen, but because you expect the worst. You have a vivid, hyperactive imagination that can build the worst case scenarios in your head, and then you can’t forget about them. They build up in your mind and never go away. Right?”
“Plus, I figured he would only want to join if he knew it was a sure thing,” Granger continues at a mumble, and Draco pauses at that. She wasn’t entirely wrong…
“You should totally get him back, though!” Max exclaims, suddenly incredibly excited, and Potter pauses in his pacing to look at the radio.
Draco heaves a deep sigh and nods in agreement. “Yeah… not really worth the risk.” Still, he makes a copy of the file and hands Mr. Davis the original, which he makes fly back to where it belongs. “Thank you for your help, nonetheless,” Draco bows his head and Mr. Davis nods back before going right back to work.
Abruptly, like the world is slowing down, Draco freezes at the new voice. His back goes stiff, spine rigid, before he manages to turn around and look for who has just interrupted his panicking.
“The magnitude of the spell is certainly impressive,” Draco agrees, twirling his wand between his fingers. He’d given up trying for the day, since the meeting would be wrapping up soon. “But actually inventing spells isn’t
“Yeah, no, you aren’t going blind, Max,” the boy wonder smirks, clearly trying to hide a chuckle that is bubbling up, and when he glances at Draco the Slytherin can only shrug and roll his eyes. This was just a normal, Max-level freakout. If it was something serious Max would get quiet and avoid the issue entirely.
Draco hopes the following month would be a bit more manageable. August he would be focused on getting ready for school, only occasionally going back to the Ministry. He may even get a chance to just breathe for a few days, but he isn’t so sure about that. He’ll have to see.
“Yeah, well, he’s still sorry. He’s a big baby, y’see, and he’s all worried what you’ll think of him,” James rolls his eyes, tone light, “He acts all cool and relaxed, but he can be almost as bad as Moony if he really gets going. Seriously…”
“It is lighter than usual,” Tana observes, the house elf significantly more comfortable around Draco than she ever had been before. He wonders when that happened…
Fudge eyes Draco closely, before taking in a deep breath and laying a hand on the blonde’s shoulder. “Your concern is exemplary, and your father would be proud, but it is unnecessary. The truth
“Miss. Granger? I believe she has already gone with her parents and assistance from Professor Flitwick,” McGonagall says after a beat of consideration.
He doesn’t know who starts moving first, if he’s being honest, but one second he and Potter are flying in weird formations around each other and the next they’re both bolting after a flash of gold in the sky. Draco blinked and he was moving, that was all there was to it, and he doesn’t hesitate to knock roughly into Potter’s side.
Most are for minor potions, usually medical in nature from a Hangover Cure to more serious, personalized concoctions for Mrs. Crouch, but a few are for ingredients. Notably, about two months before the visit, spread over a few weeks, are requests for lacewing flies, leeches, powdered bicorn horn, knotgrass, fluxweed (picked on a full moon), and boomslang skin.
“Or you might not have. Best to accept every advantage presented to us, don’t you agree?” the Slytherin says back, purposefully nonchalant about this. He didn’t want Harry making a big deal out of this. “It was a battle, Scarhead. People are going to get banged up. But we lived to see another day.”
“Alright, I fold, Hushburn gets this one,” Blaise sighs dramatically, clearly not actually caring. “She’s still a complete pain, though.”
“Plus!” Leandra perks up, evidently remembering something, “The Sacred 28 are historically European. I’m pretty sure the Potter side of your family has heavy Indian roots? I’m not sure specifically
“How… How could that have happened?” Hermione squeaks, eyes bugging out in alarm, and Daphne shrugs, chewing her lip.
“Yes ma’am, I do. And yes, Draco, I ride a motorcycle. I’ll show it to you some time if you’re so interested, but for now…” Here, Duke’s demeanor turns serious and he looks to Harry, “Rest. There is no reason for you to be in danger in this location, no one should believe you’re here, but be careful and return to the Order once you are feeling better.”
It turned out to be Dobby, who had overheard Moody and McGonagall talking about Gillyweed, and must have stolen it from Snape’s storeroom.
The diner is a little farther down the block and across the street with a bell that jingles when they open the door. While he was aware there would be no magic in this place it still throws Draco how strange it is
“Is there a problem, Draco?” Pansy asks, voice cheerful even though she isn’t smiling. She looks condescending, actually.
“You were rushing me all over the place…” Draco grumbles quietly, crouched behind some trees as he peers out at the Whomping Willow.
“So she could have been captured for that information,” Granger nods, hand coming up to rub at her chin in thought. “Could it also be possible she’s a dark witch, though?”
“I’m being personally attacked by someone who doesn’t even know what I look like,” Potter groans while Draco continues to roll around, laughing. “Oh, would you quit it?!” the Gryffindor snaps, taking one of his books and thwapping it against Draco’s head when he rolls too close.
“Yeah, to Harry, maybe, but that doesn’t mean you’re just as freaked out by failure as I am,” the ginger is quick to retort and Draco steps forward. He doesn’t pull out his wand, but he does point a menacing finger at the other.
Silence leaches through the room for only a moment before Max is sighing miserably over the line. “Sorry…”
“Well, I say good sir, what are you doing in my son’s closet? You’re scaring him, is what you are doing! Begone with you, vile creature. Begone!” Then he had shut the door tight and turned back to his son. “I’ll need to go strengthen the wards. Won’t be letting anymore of those ruffians back in here.”
“You don’t know of my powers,” Draco snarks, but their argument is forgotten a second later as, from around the corner, an ostrich comes running with a shrieking Dobby on top attempting to control it. Whatever the twins have managed, there is surely a story behind it… but the twins will just have to fill them in later, because Umbridge’s office door is crashing open and the menace in pink is rushing out.
Potter swallows, glancing down at the ground for a moment, and when he looks back up he seems to have gathered himself. “I’ll do what I can.”
“She’ll be a menace,” McGonagall sighs, stepping over and using the back of her knuckles to pet the eagle owl’s head. The owl seems just as happy with her as she does with Draco, pressing into the petting before returning her attentions to her new owner.
“This is a normal form of discipline here?” Krum questions, arms crossed and eyes narrowed, clearly displeased in his stoic way.
“I doubt my professors would understand that,” Longbottom mumbles and Draco can’t hold back his flinch. The image of his godfather immediately came to mind and his dreadful treatment of the cowardly Gryffindor. All Gryffindors were on Snape’s shitlist, but Harry and Longbottom especially.
All of the fireplaces in Hogwarts have not just the capability to fire call, but also to work as a floo. Usually, the latter doesn’t mean anything because there isn’t any floo powder in Hogwarts, and the fireplaces in the common rooms are monitored by the headmaster anyway, so no one even tries.
that my death doesn’t ‘affect you.’ Does lying make you feel better? Does denial make you feel surer of yourself? More powerful, maybe? Like you’re taking control, right?” A sneer doesn’t look right on Diggory’s face, but there it is, and it sends chills down Draco’s spine.
happened to prove it,” the muggleborn huffs. Weasley pouts at that and then the two of them begin bickering over the use of the scientific method and what it might mean for their tests.
It was a little endearing, but Draco would never admit that, and it gave him an interesting view into the cowardly Gryffindor’s mind he hadn’t thought would be so noteworthy.
“Hello, Malfoy,” Granger greets as Draco slips into the Room of Requirement. The Golden Trio are already there, moving around a few of the Death Eater dummies to be ready for the lesson. “Everything alright? You look rather pale,” the muggleborn continues, sounding more concerned now, and the other boys look over.
“Nothing,” Potter sighs, dejected. They’d wanted to get in a class as soon as possible, but they’d not been able to come up with a suitable location at all. So far, the Shrieking Shack was looking to be the most promising, but it was still a last-ditch option.
“It is not merely the beasts that concern me, but the instructor as well. He’s a big oaf with no experience teaching whatsoever!”
“Ooooh!” the sickly coo has Draco springing to his paws and rushing to Tracey’s still-visible side. He sets his paws wide and crouches, snarling at whoever has found them before he’s getting a good look, and--
“You fill the tub with these suds, use the candles, lower the lights, lean back with a glass of wine--”
Draco swallows the snarky response on the very tip of his tongue and instead takes a deep, steadying breath. “Yes, Max… I think it did.”
“In addition… after your adventure in the Department of Mysteries,” Sinistra begins as Draco takes the object, finding it to be some kind of ID card, “Ministry officials saw exactly what you are… Considering the circumstances, however, they were willing to give you a pardon.”
Harry pulls Ron and Draco inside, letting Hagrid shut the door, then immediately goes to the dog - Fang - to pet him. The hut is only one room with hams and pheasants hanging from the ceiling, a copper kettle on an open fire, and a massive bed in one corner covered in a patchwork quilt. Despite how cramped it appears, and it must be even worse for the giant man, it feels warm and cozy.
“Granger?!” Draco hisses, alarmed, then looks behind him to make sure none of the other Slytherins or Umbridge are nearby. The muggleborn huffs then lurches forward, dragging Draco closer and draping Harry’s invisibility cloak over them both.
That last one had Draco furrowing his brows curiously, but mostly he just felt overwhelmed. Right, McGonagall had said he was famous, but this was… This was a bit much, even for him. He loved being the center attention, but usually it was with only a handful of people over something unimportant.
“Fit for a beating,” Blaise suddenly says, and majority of their little group looks in surprise at the usually quiet boy. He glances up from his food and gives them all an unimpressed glare. “What? I’m not allowed to dislike people?”
Sirius had been given the other radio, Draco doubted Potter would want to speak to him much, and thus far had heard that Bagman, Fudge, and a few Aurors Potter recognized from the World Cup were walking around the Ministry. Why was Bagman heading this way, though?
“Well, hurry and use the floo. I’ll head out and see if I can hold Umbridge for longer. You have the Map?” Draco says and Harry pulls back his robes to show the Marauder’s Map tucked away inside. They both nod to each other, not wanting to waste more time, and Draco turns to hurry out.
Such things were honest concerns for the officials, Lucius had told Draco that in the past, so what could Jorkins have known? He recalled it had been Ludo Bagman’s department… Department of Magical Games and Sports.
Thankfully, or not, they soon are clambering up a set of stairs and ducking into an abandoned, dark hallway. All the other halls and rooms in Hogwarts were alight with torchlight, but this hall was dark and lifeless and cold. Colder than the dungeons.
Things do get momentarily interesting here when a first year, shaky and trying out on a school broom, goes too high and when they try to veer down nearly flies right off their broom. They end up grabbing the handle at the last second, falling downward, spinning 360 degrees around the handle, then landing right back on the broom. By the wide-eyed look on their face they’re just as surprised as everyone else. The twins immediately start cheering, getting the whole crowd of spectators to join in and make the kid blush and smile.
As he approaches the trunk he holds the sensor out to it and almost immediately it begins to buzz. Something was concealed here, then, that much was clear.
They shake hands and the reporter’s sharp nails dig painfully into Draco’s hand, but he just keeps smirking at her.
Hermione shrieks and the troll looks back at them, focus shifting yet again. “NO!” Draco yells and, feeling a burst of energy, raises his wand and calls, “
He sighs, resigning himself to his fate. He doubted he’d be able to go back to sleep, despite how much he wishes he could, and instead stares up at the ceiling. There is the sound of shuffling footsteps to his right somewhere, but he assumes that it is just Madam Pomfrey doing her job. Maybe he could convince her for another Calming Draught.
“Then why does it not FEEL that way!” Max groans loudly and Draco can imagine them throwing back their head in frustration. At least they were growing animated again.
It doesn’t last long, thankfully, because a few moments later Hooch is on the ground and separating everyone. Draco sighs, shaking his head. He couldn’t have stopped this if he’d tried, not if he wanted everyone to think he was still rivals with Potter and his pals.
“Are you two done flirting over there, yet?” snaps Weasley and Draco and Harry both startle, looking over. Granger and Weasley are both watching them, Granger covering a giddy smile with her hand while Weasley looks like he’s just been tortured.
“It’s amazing,” Draco breathes, stepping closer then kneeling on the carpet, wanting to see what the dark, spectral creature might feel like.
Potter tightens up, hands squeezing Draco’s hand and shoulder, his head pressing into Draco’s shoulder a tiny bit more forcefully before he loosens with a deep sigh. “I’ll tell you…” he begins after a few beats, “If you tell me why you were up here.”
“It was all fine and funny at first, but now she’s just reading the whole book,” finally Sophie moves towards the stool, dragging a normal, backed chair with her to set all of her things on. “If I have to hear one more, ‘and their tongues battled for dominance,’ I’m going to scream.”
“Draco…” Blaise begins, leaning towards Draco like he was talking to a particularly difficult child, “None of us give a fuck.”
“Not all would agree,” Sinistra hums and Draco hears her move from behind him. A moment later she is crouching down on the carpet beside Draco, looking regal the way she settles her robes and lays her hands in her lap. She reminds Draco of his mother, a bit, as she looks to her Militus in thought.
“It isn’t,” he huffs, pulling out his record on Beethoven. He looks over it, then puts it back. “Come on, this is the sphynx’s riddle! It’s the most famous riddle in the world!”
“Do you not have any homework you need to do?” Draco asks, curious. He tended to finish his homework as early as possible to leave himself as much free time as he could. Hermione, though, would usually spread her homework out over multiple days.
“I didn’t mention this before…” Draco mumbles, barely over a whisper, and he looks away. “But during the Welcoming Feast I made eye contact with Sinistra and…” Draco reaches up to grip his shirt, right over his scar. “Suddenly my scar started to hurt like it never had before. Then, just a moment ago, after you ran them off, my scar started to hurt again.”
“Freshly made Animagus will struggle with the melding of their human and animal instincts. Over time, you will know how to identify them and they will simply become another, minor impulse for you to control with little to no issue. For the first year or so, however, these impulses will be new and difficult to control.”
“Can you two be weird when I’m not around? Both of you together is exhausting,” Draco scowls, earning a pair of wide-eyed stares a moment later. It made him want to shudder.
Hushburn, then. He certainly hadn’t been expecting anything from her. And, logically, that must mean this was a Muggle book. It made sense. He wondered if Max or Granger had ever read it.
The voice isn’t one that Draco is familiar with. It isn’t one of the students, it was too deep and calm, but it cuts through the chaos as a Death Eater topples to the ground. Then another voice, also older, yells, “
“No wonder Draco continues to do it,” Eve drawls, smirking at Draco when he glares at her, before she turns and places a gentle kiss to Leandra’s cheek. “Well, Draco and I have a small project to do, so we will be off.”
“Maybe they don’t want to,” Tracey begins, pausing to toss some of her meat slabs to the thestrals keeping their distance. “So, they need to be tricked into learning. That’s how my daddy taught me vegetables are good for you. He’d sneak them into my food.”
“It, uh… It is Greek, Professor. Astron meaning stars, and nomos meaning law,” he offers, voice shaky, and Sinistra blinks once. Had she blinked at all up to that point?
just collapses on top of Draco, leaving only a weak, raw, crying boy who had seen death and ran straight towards it.
Theodore raises his hands placatingly, clearly not taking him too seriously but admitting temporary defeat as he turns back into the bathroom to spit out his toothpaste.
The drugged boy shrieks in pain and Draco spins to look around at all the possible entrances and exits. There is absolutely no way the Death Eaters missed that. There’s no way they aren’t charging for them right this second. They’re fucked, they’re fucked, they’re fucked.
“Bloody hell!” Draco exclaims, disbelieving he has somehow managed to become these people’s candy dealer. He chucks a bag of PopRocks at Weasley, Eve, and Granger, then falls back into his seat with a box of Junior Mints.
“Blaise managed a non-corporeal Patronus. Daphne and Astoria’s are a butterfly and hummingbird respectively,” Granger ticks off the students on her fingers. “Sophie didn’t get it last night, but Tracey formed her octopus at the last minute.”
“They didn’t- didn’t know! About LIFE!” Eric eventually manages to say, his voice watery and wobbly and it takes a while for Draco to properly understand him. “They- They- They were- were an innocent party! They didn’t deserve this!”
“Yes, yes, you have a big family of magicians,” Eve groans, rolling her eyes skyward, then waggles her fingers at Weasley. “We asked about you, though, dweeb. What’ve you got?”
“The Order? They’re on the way?” Harry asks, voice suddenly vulnerable, and Draco can only offer a nod when the Gryffindor looks down at him.
“I can’t believe this!” Pansy shrieks one morning in the Great Hall, a Witch Weekly magazine in her hands, breakfast forgotten in front of her. She’s flipping furiously through the pages, skimming with sharp eyes as her scowl gets deeper and deeper.
“Whoa!” both boys say in unison, eyes widening as they read over the article. “Hagrid! Weren’t you in Diagon Alley that day?” Harry asks, looking up with excited eyes. It is only then Draco notices how shifty Hagrid has become, looking around at anything but them and keeping his mouth shut.
“If you want to show someone what a thestral looks like, you will need to draw them,” Luna says, voice as airy and light as usual, “They only appear to those who have seen death. Including in pictures.”
They all continue to walk, Dumbledore leading as Sirius walks with an arm around his godson’s shoulders and Draco, on Potter’s other side, feels the boy’s hand re-latch itself to his robes instead.
“I’m not insulting him, I’m telling the truth! Get over yourself, your dad’s a jerk and you’re turning into him!”
Draco makes a point of eying Potter’s glasses before snarking, covering up how his heart speeds up, “Are you sure about that?”
“That’s why they thought it was a curse! It was on a path to becoming the fourth Unforgiveable, but then a dark wizard used it on an auror and,” giggle, “it didn’t make them want to kill themselves. It just got a song stuck in their head!”
you to tell me. I’m sorry about the other day. I don’t… like fighting with you anymore. Well, I never did, but it used to be because I didn’t like you and you were obnoxious and self-centered, but now… I just don’t like it…”
“They ran all the way back to the dorms and I brought all of our stuff back down,” Vivian adds, nodding and smiling, panic wiped from her face as she and Harry weave their lie.
“No! Of course not,” Harry is quick to assure, waving his hands around in some kind of motion to hopefully calm everyone down.
“We should head up to that building. See if the dragon is there,” Draco decides, flinching at the way his voice echoes. They turn and carefully make their way up the stairs, not wanting to slip on the damp stone.
The talk about dark wizards and their parents ends there and Draco goes to finally prepare for bed, feeling confused but, strangely enough, slightly liberated.
‘We always watch the humans. Your… ‘house’ is just easiest,’ Augi explains. Before Draco can ask another question, the merman looks behind him, further into the lake, as if he heard something. Draco cannot see any ears on him, though. ‘I am needed,’ Augi signs, looking back at Draco and staring at him for a few beats. Coming to some sort of decision the merman nods once. ‘I will get you help. Goodnight, Draco,’ he says and swims to the right, out of Draco’s view, in one fluid motion.
“People are staring,” Eve hums to him, winking over at some Beauxbaton student when she catches her eye.
“Flint? As in Marcus Flint?” Hermione looks to Draco’s face, her expression pinched, and Draco looks back at her with a tilt to his head.
“I’ve heard of weirder shit,” Eve shrugs, fingers hovering over a mark on Hermione’s chest that looks like she’d been lashed with a whip. It didn’t look pretty and Draco has to watch for a moment to see her breath again. “Magic’s fucking bizarre.”
Twenty broomsticks are laying out on the lawn, two rows of ten facing each other, and Harry drags Draco over to stand by a pair. They’re ugly things and Draco had heard plenty about how awful they functioned. Both Fred and George Weasley were very vocal complainers, and Harry had heard a lot from his own father on the subject.
“What is that you keep saying?” Draco asks as the wandmaker scurries off, “About the wood and the… the unicorn and dragon stuff.”
“She’s probably hiding out somewhere. You ARE pretty exhausting to be around,” Sophie smirks, her glossed lips sharp with the motion. She had such round, soft features, but was able to make some of the most cutting expressions. They almost rivalled Pansy.
He was eternally grateful he could access the Records Department whenever he wanted, now. All the research and information at his disposal. It left him probably giddier than he needed to be…
“What’s up with Malfoy?” says a voice off to the side. It takes Draco a moment to recognize it as Theodore.
“STOP!” Harry calls desperately, eyes wide in horror as he watches his friend be tortured right in front of him. Beside him Tracey’s support on Weasley has turned more into a hug as she tries to hide her face, while Weasley stares off like a vegetable.
“Malfoy? What are you doing h--” Granger cuts herself off with a gasp, finally seeing Draco and openly staring.
“I want you all to quit forgetting that the only reason Potter is in this situation to begin with is because someone wants to murder him!” Draco roars, Weasley snapping his mouth shut, Granger looking away, and Potter scowling even deeper.
“Most of which also happen to be illegal, making them useless in this court of law. Thank you, sir, now answer the question.”
“Oh, and these are for you, Potter,” Draco says as an afterthought, tucking his wand away and reaching into his satchel. He tosses a bag of M&M’s at Potter, who catches them and looks at them in surprise, before smiling knowingly at Draco.
“It’s the girls’ bathroom,” Harry gasps and Ron looks at him sharply, before also picking up just what that means.
Eventually, Draco is saved by his godfather demanding he go to bed already, ignoring Umbridge’s anger, and the blonde gratefully absconds to his dorm and bed for sleep.
“If I said ‘no,’ would you believe me?” Hermione smiles sweetly and Draco groans, looking skyward, as the bushy-haired Gryffindor giggles at his side.
“It’s true,” Eve nods, “There’s a lot about the other schools and wizarding communities that isn’t easily shared, including sentient magical beings. For instance, I’d say go speak to a Long for your final article, but I can’t think of a way you could do that.”
“I am not knowing of this Valkman, but I vill listen if I can,” Krum nods in agreement and Draco nods back just as Erik Satie’s “Gymnopedies” gets stuck into his head and he shoots a glare at a now-smirking Granger.
Granger, not fully paying attention to the conversation as a whole, says instinctively, “You could always use--”
“Just focus…” Potter sighs, sounding miserable, “Neither of us want to be out here with each other, but SOMEBODY ratted us out and got us all detention.” The pointed look Potter gives Draco shows exactly who he blames for this situation, but Draco simply shrugs.
“Rather intense man, wouldn’t you agree?” Draco says conversationally, opening up the book to look through it again.
“Why is Malfoy staying with us?” Potter demands, looking at Sirius and not Draco. “This was supposed to be our first holiday together and he has to come along and ruin it?”
Then Max begins reciting numbers and Draco nods to himself. Right, it was the one like Arithmancy. A specific study of math.
“Quick, take this before Papa sees,” Max whispers urgently, holding a familiar-looking device in their hands. They shove it at Draco, who cradles the large thing in his arms, surprised and uncertain what to do.
Skeeter blinks slowly at Draco, her sugar quill held loosely in her fingers, before she’s rolling her head backwards and bursting out laughing. “You expect,” she cackles as Draco looks at her with narrowed eyes, “You actually expect… a… glorified research paper is going to change that many minds? Darling, tell your parents to get their money back. This school is doing nothing for you.”
“You know him?” Eve hisses to Draco and the blonde glances over at her, then back towards Harry, who is carefully inching his way into the room, wand still drawn and eyes narrowed.
Draco didn’t know how to make himself understand, but he supposed he could start by trusting Harry to catch him when he falls.
“Tracey, please, we don’t have time for this again,” Draco hears as he’s walking down the halls. He’s heading for the Quidditch pitch where the final match of the season is meant to take place, but stops as he passes the swamp when he hears voices.
The hand on his knee moves to grip his wrist, squeezing until Draco looks over to find Potter smiling. “You were worried about them,” he whispers.
“Uh, what?” Theodore whispers as the rest of them fully clamber into the room, getting a good look at the two figures. The Slytherins are completely ignored, standing on the line between the split of black and white. “What’s going on?”
Draco doesn’t get a chance to start asking questions, however, because suddenly someone screams and in pours a hoard of translucent people, floating through the walls and looking down on the group of first years and offering greetings. Even Ron and Hermione stop arguing to look up at them all.
The grip on Draco’s robes tightens a little before releasing. “Come on, guys, let’s hear the poor ferret out. You know how much he loves to hear his own voice.”
Gryffindor is making its way to the goal posts, Draco just about ready to strike, when there’s a cacophony of noise from the stands and Lee Jordan’s voice is cutting through again. “OHHH! That is a nasty fall! Can someone check if he’s aliv--”
“What are you doing?” the blond asks softly and Harry shakes his head, looking lost as he gently lays his hands on Draco’s stomach instead.
Oh. Oh! Okay, that made sense. Draco nods and waves the wand much like he’d seen McGonagall do when she changed the Nubble’s chair into an ostrich. A small gust of wind ruffles his hair and Ollivander’s robes, but it’s weak and Draco doesn’t feel anything particularly special about it. Judging by the look on the old man’s face Ollivander probably sees that too.
“I’m sure you’ll do just fine,” Eve assures her girlfriend, and Draco absently wonders what these two girls did for their Valentine’s Day. Should he have asked? Too late now.
“I love her,” he says, grinning brightly up at the bird. He reaches up and scratches at her chest feathers, earning a happy little twitter that only makes him grin bigger. “Temperamental? Please, they just didn’t understand you, didn’t they?” he says to her sweetly and she hoots as if to agree with him.
“I can’t go yet. Umbridge expects me and the rest of her ‘loyal Slytherins’ to search the castle. Head back to Gryffindor. We’ll talk tomorrow,” the blonde says regrettably. There isn’t anything more that he’d rather do than curl up in his bad and sleep, but he has work to do and professors to trick. “Stick to your tower. Umbridge might begin making house calls as the night rolls on.”
“Danger junkie,” Draco mumbles, rolling his eyes, and Harry grins at him as they duck behind a corner, hearing distant footsteps.
“He didn’t!” Draco exclaims, a grin jumping to his face as he looks to Potter. The other boy laughs, bright and vibrant, and nods.
“Hmm, yeah… yeah, he says they’re all mostly liars, or something,” Max replies. They begin mumbling out some kind of mathematical formula, sorting out the numbers in their head, before scribbling out an answer.
“Professor Lupin, now…” Okay, Draco needed to be careful here. Lupin had been his favorite professor, but the Ministry officials on Fudge’s side all seemed set to crucify him for being a werewolf. Umbridge was likely the same… “His actual teaching methods were quite successful - I retained much from his lessons - but to find out he was a werewolf…” He leaves the rest unsaid, allowing Umbridge to fill in the gaps the way she wanted. The way that would win Draco her favor.
Potter heaves a deep sigh, the tension leaving his body some. “Fine, git. You really are a worrywart, you know…” Potter finally looks up at Draco, their eyes catching, and for a second the blonde’s breathing stops in his chest. The other boy looks so drawn and pale, yet there is something about the resigned, welcome look in his eyes that catches Draco off guard.
“You’re purring,” Potter whispers and Draco can feel the smile against his neck. He can also feel, and now hear, himself purring like an engine.
“Great! I have a bunch except for Ptolemy and Mirabella Plunkett,” Ron says brightly before turning an accusatory glare on Harry, who pointedly looks out the window. “It WOULD have been Ptolemy and Agrippa if Harry hadn’t messed me up with a bad trade.”
“Tana sees only this, young master,” she says, handing them over, and Draco looks down at them. The note is in significantly worse handwriting, which he always found funny, because now he knew it was written by Max’s mother.
Which mostly amounted to “Here’s an extra study session. Work on your homework. Voices down if you must speak.”
” Potter pauses for all of three second before he begins to hum. Then he stops, starts humming again, and then properly realizes the song has been stuck into his head.
“Yeah, little man, do your thing,” Eric sighs, sounding pointedly exhausted himself, before there is a rustling and the radio is handed over.
Potter barks a laugh at that, pleased, before he’s saying, “I’d rather we not find out, thanks. We already got Prince Charming, here, he doesn’t need the competition.”
“A fancy party? Oh! There must be other kids there if YOU’RE going, right? Make sure to try and make new friends! You need more than just me.”
That was when Draco and Potter had snuck away and Draco and Max got to hear all about Potter’s day, adjusted for Muggle ears.
“Another Weasley, eh?” Hagrid hums, glancing over Ron’s freckles and red hair, “I spent half me life chasin’ yer twin brothers away from the forest.” The man has begun pouring boiling water from the kettle into a teapot and setting out rock cakes on a plate.
“Hello?” he says into the device, but realizes a moment later none of the lights are on and no crackling noise is coming through like it had before. Right, he needed to turn it on… Wasn’t there a switch for that? Where was-- He smiles triumphantly as he finds the switch and flicks it.
Still, sitting in the Hogwarts Express, they had a momentary reprieve, the dark aura moving away for the time being.
He realizes McGonagall - that had been her name, right? - is silently waiting for him to say something, so he goes with the first thing that comes to mind. “What are you on, lady?” Perhaps not the most respectful tone to take with an elder, but the woman doesn’t seem to mind all that much. Her smile actually turns a little sad.
He eyes the card and finds a stern-looking man with a dark, scraggly beard and slicked hair looking up at him. The portrait blinks slowly, looking like a smart and powerful person. Underneath the portrait reads the name, “Grigori Rasputin,” and Draco knows immediately what’s on the CD.
“Indian…” Harry repeats, looking surprised. As he looks to Leandra, Draco takes a moment to look at Harry. Draco had never been good at identifying specific, cultural heritage through a person’s physical characteristics. Usually, he found out due to reputation, whispers, or accents. Draco was quite good with accents. But, he was dreadful with visuals, and with his family name being so famous for its prejudice… well, he’d never wanted to assume.
“So,” she begins, placing both hands down on her desk and clasping them together, “That is your offer. Play for the Slytherin team, or punishment.” Draco’s mouth falls open. He’d momentarily forgotten that was why they were here to begin with. Sinistra must realize that of course they would pick Quidditch over trouble and had manipulated the situation. Draco had to admit he could respect that…
“That’s ridiculous. We’ve already discussed that the Patronus and Militus aren’t opposites. Knowing one should not bar the other from existing,” the blonde assures, looking bored, and reaches out to ruffle Harry’s hair patronizingly. The other boy smacks his hand away, shooting him a glare, which Draco smirks back at.
“You got pissy and stopped talking to Weasley and I for a week?” Draco offers sleepily, eyes closed, but forcing himself to stay awake.
that it sends even Draco’s blood rushing with ice. Occasionally there’s a mumble of “…can’t believe they…” or “kept this secret…” or “he was their friend,” but Draco has no idea what they all mean.
“We… flew to the ground and walked back to our dorms, Professor,” Draco says slowly, looking back at his Head of House, and she stares right into his very soul.
“Alas, even I have forgotten why I originally came here. Perhaps I was hurt. Perhaps I was helping. I do not recall,” the Lung Dragon sighs in clear dissatisfaction.
Draco’s brows furrow. No, he didn’t have wandless tutoring tonight. He had a DA meeting… Then he spots the knowing smile on Dumbledore’s face and he flushes in embarrassment. Of course Dumbledore would know about the DA. He was
Draco, uncertain what to say to that, raises a hand and begins to card his fingers through Potter’s messy hair again. It’s surprisingly soft and fluffy, not quite the tangled disarray he’d been expecting, and he allows himself the chance to marvel at it.
“I didn’t--” Draco snarls, but looks away, glaring up at where the wall meets the ceiling. He runs a hand through his hair, messing up the part straight down the middle, and takes a growling breath. “I did not mean to snap,” he finally says through gritted teeth, looking back down at Tana. “That was unnecessary.”
“Yes, as do I,” Draco snaps, “As I was saying… I swore I would take regular photos of your trip out to appease Dumbledore. If we run into any problems, we simply take a photo with this hand gesture in it.” Draco then holds up his hand, all fingers extended up save the ring finger, which he holds to his palm with his thumb.
So, they’ve solved the communication problem with Granger’s enchanted galleons. The issue now, however, is finding a location.
“Hello?” Both boys jerk up, looking to each other before scrambling to hide behind a large armchair. Apparently, they hadn’t been as quiet as they had hoped. It didn’t help they hardly had a plan beyond “Get somewhere safe immediately.” They didn’t need to get caught and sent down to the dungeons when that was exactly where they needed to keep away.
“I had no idea,” Harry whispers, staring at the ground and allowing Draco to pull him around the castle. “I had
“I’ve heard that before,” Draco nods, finally lowering his book. “I just… I really like the idea of making something of my own. There seems to be near limitless possibilities when it comes to magic and… I just really want to take advantage of that.” Draco then flips through his notes to the pages where he had begun writing out spell ideas. They’d gone through countless revisions as he actually learned about magic and he shows them to Professor Flitwick.
“No, not about that. Like… how are you feeling…? About… Sirius…” Harry glances down, biting his lip, and Draco thinks he might understand.
“How can you tell?” Draco questions, but this time it looks like the twins are actually agreeing with their brother.
Inside the box is a stiletto-style, silver dagger laying on green velvet. It has a black handle and is inlaid with red gems; which Draco thinks Potter did on purpose. He still can’t take his eyes off the beautiful gift, not caring if it was cheap or expensive.
Gemma was probably the most harmless, annoying Slytherin Draco knew so far, but she wasn’t awful. He could at least sit in the same room as her for extended periods of time. He couldn’t do that with Percy, the Gryffindor prefect, he’d discovered rather quickly. William, the other fifth year, Slytherin prefect, was significantly more reasonable to be around. He didn’t lecture all the younger students every chance he got and instead was quite mellow majority of the time. Plus, get him going on his siblings, which he apparently had many of, and you could slip away from him if you were in trouble.
“Not going to give us the files, then, are you?” twin one questions meekly, playing up his kicked puppy look while twin two scuffs his feet and peaks through his bangs.
“I’m still on your side,” Draco says firmly, hand discreetly circling Potter’s wrist, pressing his fingers to the pulse point. “We just have to be smart about this. Which leads me to my second point… Potter, you need to keep control of your emotions. You have been known to explode in the face of adversity, which is marvelously Gryffindor of you, but here that will only bring you trouble.”
So, in response, he left the manor as much as possible. The Ministry was his usual spot, continuing to build up his reputation, but also focusing on Auror work or hiding away in the Records Department.
“I will be speaking in more detail to the captain, Marcus Flint, but we are in need of new players after many graduated or stepped down,” Sinistra sets down her cup then pulls out a sheet of parchment from a desk drawer along with a quill and inkwell. She begins writing with elegant, sweeping motions.
Draco and Harry get up far earlier than they would ever have liked, but they have to if they want to sneak out of the tower without being spotted. They slip out the window in the dorm room and fly quickly back to the Astronomy Tower. When they slip through the corridors, the sounds of morning bird song disappearing as they trek deeper and deeper into the dungeons, they find their common room not as deserted as they would have hoped.
However, where they had hoped for resignation, instead Potter’s brows furrowed, and he looked up suspiciously. Draco could groan. What now?
“Yua Hushburn,” Eve’s mother introduces herself, but does not stop giving Duke a hard stare. She was a hard one to win over…
Again, the hat takes its time, even longer than Vincent, and at some point the large boy seemed to grow panicked, like he had heard something he didn’t like, and his head turned back and forth. After that it was only a moment before the hat called, “GRYFFINDOR!”
He slips out to the grounds more often, taking photo after photo. He slips his camera out between classes, during meals, on weekends and breaks. He gets candid shots of other students and faculty, along with a few posed pics.
“Hermione, he was nearly killed,” Harry cuts in before Draco can retort and all the fight drains out of the young witch, along with all her color.
Draco considers their options for only a moment before glancing between the twins, an eyebrow arched. “Have any of those Whiz-bangs of yours with you?” he questions, watching as two, matching grins answer him.
“And it was with this girl from a nearby public school,” Max continues, ignoring Draco, and they sound more tired than miserable. How long ago had all of this happened? “I found out about it from one of her classmates… We grew up in the same neighborhood and… yeah…”
Draco knew better now, though. Duke had really laid it out for Draco, and even some of the pro-Minister Aurors had jumped in with their own complaints.
They send Hermione and Eve out with Harry and Longbottom first. Longbottom can manage the limp Gryffindor girl while also keeping the invisibility cloak in place, and when they get to the floos Eve can take her the rest of the way. After that it is Ginny and Luna, with similar methods, and after that is Blaise and Theodore.
“AND,” Draco says sharply against Harry’s interruption, squeezing the Gryffindor back against him tightly, “the most remarkable boy I have ever had the misfortune of knowing.”
“Whatever, Potter,” Draco snaps, not exactly an affirmative, but not a denial either. Then, sharply and under his breath, he curses, “Merlin.”
“Come along,” McGonagall says instead of replying. She begins walking towards the exit and Draco holds up the cage to Tootsie, quietly asking her to get inside while they walk around. The eagle owl hesitates, but ultimately returns to her cage, seeming pleased when Draco tosses the lock at the front desk none-too-gently. “I think it is about time we got you your wand.”
“You are more than welcome to, but I would advise against attempting any more advanced spells. In addition, as an underage wizard you are forbidden from using magic outside of school grounds or any designated areas.”
“Never took you for the ‘unregistered Animagus’ type, Draco,” Pansy purrs and Draco stiffens. “Thought you were smarter than that.”
Hey there everyone! Hope you're all well! So, new chapter, showing the beginning of Draco's very interesting summer...
Draco was only half listening now, his eyes widening at something the boy had said. He had McGonagall to answer his questions, sure, but she was so stern and intimidating that he wasn’t sure how to have a full conversation with her on everything he was interested in asking. Plus, she was OLD. It would probably do to make some connections with other kids his age, and this one seemed to know his stuff.
“What?” the nonchalant tone quickly vanishes from Draco’s voice, his arms unfolding and falling to his sides. He stares at Harry’s back for a moment before taking a few, tentative steps forward. “I am… hoping this is because of a miraculous improvement in your occlumency skills?” he ventures, but he has little hope.
“You two are too cute. It’s gross,” Draco replies, sticking his tongue out like he’s gagging, and Eve pulls out her wand. Draco reels back a little, stepping slightly behind the Golden Trio to stave off any thrown curses.
“Wait!” Leandra suddenly yells, slamming the Geoscript onto the table, then immediately flinching and patting down the book as if she were apologizing to it. “I think I’ve heard of something like this,” she says after she’s assured she didn’t damage the book.
When he is awoken an unknown time later, it is to a hand gently running over his back, carding through the fur, and a familiar face in front of him. “Good afternoon, Draco,” Harry smiles gently and Draco’s purring picks back up, too tired to feel embarrassed at the clear sign of his joy. It makes Harry smile a little brighter, anyway, so it can’t really be all that bad.
It was Sunday, when they weren’t even supposed to get mail, that Mrs Nubble finally had quite enough when the lone envelope appeared at the front door. She snatched it up and began writing a reply letter.
Draco doesn’t have a clue what happened after he was knocked out, but he has to assume things worked out well enough since he’s home and not in some Ministry cell or St. Mungo’s.
“Better than my father’s,” Draco replies and Sirius snorts. “Are you aware you look like Joey Ramone from the Ramones?” That turns Sirius’s snort into a surprised, booming laugh, his head thrown back. He throws an arm around Draco’s shoulder and they begin walking behind Dumbledore through the corridors of the castle.
Potter’s grip on his arm tightens and he’s dragged to his feet as they start to run. They have to move quickly before the werewolf notices them, but where do they go? Where can they hide?
There’s a long silence, no one saying a word, and Draco keeps his back turned towards the Gryffindor as Lucky finally approaches him, asking for attention from a familiar human. Then Eric’s sigh is crackling over the radio connection.
It turns out the first task is dragons, which Potter learned from Hagrid the night prior after he and Moody had approached Potter and Granger at the Three Broomsticks. Draco finds Moody’s presence a little odd but decides to keep that to himself.
“Oh, yes. Watch,” she says, and brandishes her wand. She holds it upward and gives it a few twists, and says, “
“That… that sounds completely preposterous!” Draco snaps, but he’s having a tougher and tougher time defending his stance, so he stubbornly shoves past the two Muggles and heads to a new display altogether.
“I am very sorry,” Draco breathes, trying to follow the dragon’s movements but swiftly growing dizzy. “We had no idea.”
Just about any Ravenclaw was good as well, since they often had their noses buried in research of some kind and wouldn’t pay attention to Draco. He’d even managed to get nearly a foot away from a Ravenclaw in the library, one time, without her noticing. But that was all they did. Research. And as interesting as that might be when he, personally, was doing it, it didn’t make a very interesting subject matter.
They slip out of the common room much as they had the night they went to the third floor corridor, brooms in hand and Draco’s backpack slung over his shoulders. Part of Draco wonders if they should really be doing this. Despite being located in the dungeons the Slytherins are the closest to the entrance to the Astronomy Tower, but there is still plenty of opportunity for them to get found out.
“Of course,” McGonagall says with a nod, face forward as she walks but obviously still paying attention to Draco. “You should note, however, that your supply list says you may not own your own broom as a first year.” Draco doesn’t care, he doesn’t care at all, so long as one day he’ll be allowed to try out flying. He loves being up high, has a habit of climbing every tree or climb-able surface he can come across, much to his foster family and Hermione’s dismay.
