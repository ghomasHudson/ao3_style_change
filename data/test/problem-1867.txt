“Nonsense. It’s the first time you’ve ever brought anyone to my bar Drake and he’s really fit at that.” Then she gasped dramatically. “Oooh is this a date? Please tell me it’s a date. Ahh! I have to text Bex-”
“I know I don’t have to, but I want to. I- argh, fuck.” Draco said as he collapsed back onto his knees on the floor still fully dressed.
Then a little while later, around the time that Draco always went to bed he had leaned over and given Harry one small chaste kiss on the lips. “Goodnight Harry.” Was all he had said before he got up and left the room and their second kiss had been over before it began… but still, it had happened… and Draco wouldn’t have kissed Harry a second time if he regretted the first would he?
“Oh I think he’s always had it.” Draco said flatly and not at all jealous. “I left him under it immobilised on the train once.”
“Right well. I thought you might like this room but erm, well if you don’t then you can choose another one.” Harry said, suddenly feeling a bit nervous as he gestured for Draco to step inside.
“Really?” Teddy asked, his now bright blue eyes wide in wonder and his hair turned a truly magical gold that sparkled in the light.
“Well I’m glad I met her.” Harry said firmly. “And I’m really glad you came back into my life again when you did. I think if it had been a year or even six months ago this might not have happened for us but now… things just seem to be lining up well I guess.”
“I think the time has come now for a bit of a change. The estate has remained the same for decades and although it has always been grand there has still been a sombre atmosphere about the place which has increased tenfold in the past couple of years.” She stopped herself like she always did when she came too close to the subject of the war before changing tactics.
Really, he should have known that the day was going too well and something else bad was bound to happen.
Even if it never became more than friends he would be satisfied with being an important person to Harry. That was all he’d ever wanted really.
Daphne seemed to read his mind and she reached over the table to give Harry’s hand a gentle squeeze. She didn’t linger though and spoke again as she withdrew her hand.
“I’m sorry I didn’t mean…” He started awkwardly but didn’t seem to understand what was going on or what to say.
She looked at him in mild surprise again but seemed pleased. “I see, well it’s very good to have your custom, thank you.”
“I have a pair of grey skinny jeans that I hardly wear, you can have them. They’ll be easy enough to shrink in the leg a bit or they can just gather, you’re not that much shorter than me. We used to be the same size around the waist… although we might have to shrink them slightly for you now.” Blaise said staring at Draco’s waist and frowning.
“Drake.” She said as she pulled back. She rolled the ‘r’ sound slightly in a faint french accent but her English seemed even more fluent than the other locals Harry had come across. “I didn’t expect to see you tonight. You said you were going into hiding for two weeks.”
“Plus having Harry Potter package up the owl orders is great for business!” George joked looking more like his normal self to reassure his mother. “I’m going to get him to sign each one!”
“What the one that just broke off her engagement with Malfoy?!” George frowned as if he didn’t understand why Harry brought it up.
“But what about you?” Draco asked, feeling pretty guilty that it was kind of his fault Blaise had a target on his back from Lucius now.
Half an hour later they were both dressed and ready to go. Harry in a pair of beige shorts and a simple khaki round neck t-shirt and some brown leather flip flops. Draco was wearing something ridiculous as usual which he described as a ‘romper’ when Harry asked him but Harry still didn’t really know what that was.
I just love the fluffy little moments like Harry and Draco eating pizza together in their PJ's in the middle of the night!
“Oh, right, yeah.” Harry said catching up to George’s thought process. “That could work you know.” He said slowly nodding. “Thanks.”
Draco gets realised from the hospital wing but isn't ready to face the rest of the school at mealtimes yet... So Harry takes him on another night time adventure!
“I’m not asking for any money back. I’ll still pay for them, I just don’t want them.” Potter tried to explain to the french receptionist in an exhausted fashion.
Harry frowned slightly, he didn’t really think that was necessary and was Fred just saying this now or had they discussed it.
Harry didn’t hide the surprise from his face. He’d heard on the gossip chain of the engagement months ago but other than that he knew nothing about Malfoy’s life and what he’d been up to since the war. When he realised who he had been speaking too in the shop though he couldn’t help but think what a good handsome couple they would make, she seemed kind of perfect for Malfoy and he was now wondering what had happened. Surely Malfoy’s parents would want the marriage to happen.
“I- I will never force you to Draco, but I- I’d really like it if you did.” Harry said softly scooting closer to Draco and pressing their foreheads together, his hand still resting on Draco’s forearm. He pulled back enough to use his hand to gently raise Draco’s chin and look into his eyes. “I know what’s there, I’ve seen it before on you, the night you pulled your sleeve up to show Dumbledore, if that helps you… I don’t know if it does but I know exactly what’s there and I’m still here. I want you, all of you and nothing is ever going to change that.”
“Yeh… had enough of fighting for a while, and it’s still a bit stressful amongst the aurors at the moment. To be honest this seemed like a good peaceful assignment and I thought you’d be happier when you go to school if you knew she was with me. She’ll be alright with me.” Leo shrugged.
George saw it too and spoke even quieter this time but Draco heard as he was right next to them.. “He’ll be fine Harry, just give him time yeah?”
Draco was wearing the same smart outfit that Harry knew him to wear as Pierre again except the cravat was different. He looked good and seemed happy, well rested.
“Oh I think it’s sweet that him and Harry clearly want this evening to go well.” Daphne said smiling and now having a good look round this room.
“So you really did kill a basilisk with the sword of Gryffindor? That was the most ridiculous rumour I’d ever heard I had no idea it was actually true…”
It wasn’t like he wanted time apart from Draco, weirdly he really, really didn’t. Except that maybe if he had some time alone he could have that wank that he seemed to desperately need just to relive some of the sexual tension he felt… But he wasn’t going to push Draco away and make some weird excuse for time alone if Draco was happy to be with him.
“Draco, change that back for me would you? I’ve always been crap at transfiguration.” He said with a smile.
“What’s the deal with the house elf? I got the impression there was a story there?” Draco asked. It wasn’t the question he had been planning to ask but there would be time for that and this one just came to him.
“All good.” Harry said smiling just as Kreacher summoned two more glasses and poured one red for Harry and one white for Draco. He knew what they liked.
Draco held his hand up to stop him. He wasn’t angry with him, how could he be, but he just couldn’t face it right now. Blaise fell silent and Draco turned his attention back to his mother who hadn’t moved and was looking fearful and sad. A look Draco had only seen on her during her worst times in the war and something he hoped he’d never see again. It pained him that he was the cause of this but she had sat back and let his father control him for years and he had to fight for himself now, fight for his freedom.
“Yeah… yeah I’m ok.” Harry said slowly, still breathing in and out but calmly now. “Sorry.” He mumbled.
“Did you know?” Ron asked casually. “I mean I figured… that day at the quidditch she was in your box with you so was that why he didn’t sit with us so he could sit with her?”
What was Draco getting at? Sometimes he wanted to know Leo’s thoughts on the war and how he felt now being forced to guard Death Eaters day in day out, but then he thought it was best not to know. No one talked about the war or the reason they were here and Draco certainly wasn’t going to be the one who brought it up. So instead Draco played it down.
Then they came to the most colourful bar Harry had ever seen. It was only small and quite shabby in some ways but the rustic charm made it look endearing rather than scruffy. It was essentially a modest wooden hut with a straw roof and it was painted every colour under the sun, all in pastel shades. There was no pattern or reason to the arrangements of colours; there were just random little segments of pink, turquoise, orange, yellow and green. Some patches were nailed on top of other bits where it obviously had been quickly repaired and some of the paint was flaking off in places.
“I swear to you Draco we’ll find a way to get Lucius out of your life for good. It won’t always be like this.” Harry said quietly. “I do get it Draco, maybe more than you think. I used to try and do everything myself, I still do often to be honest but I used to be worse. I would never have got through the war by myself you know, we all need people around us.”
“Merlin Draco, I’m so glad you called, I’ve been tearing my hair out. I am so so sorry, you have no idea, I was such an idiot, I’m sorry, please, I should have listened to you, I should never have-” He rambled on not noticing that Draco was continually trying to interrupt him until the man practically shouted.
Blaise was waiting for him by the backdoor. He looked at the box Draco was holding but didn’t say anything. Suddenly Draco got nervous but then Blaise gave him a small smile.
He watched as Malfoy crouched down to untie the rope securing the rear of the boat to the pontoon. As he did so he chatted over his shoulder to Harry.
Nope. Don’t think about that, Harry told himself. Concentrate on the book, get to know Draco, be his friend. Three simple things, he could do that.
“Thank you George, for everything. You’ve done a great job I’m sure and I’m sorry for just turning up here and being such a fucking mess.” Harry said honestly reaching for George’s hand automatically with his right hand before noticing it was pretty heavily bandaged. He hesitated and drew it back.
“It really is!” Ginny said, bouncing Rose on her lap. “It’s just stressful at the moment, this is the first year where we’ve actually had a shot at winning the league and I just want it so badly!”
“I wouldn’t have let that happen Fred and he knows that. You’ll always be important to me and he cares about me enough not to make me choose.” Harry insisted.
Ron rolled his eyes and held back a remark reminding himself that he had a job to do. “So who is this person and why do they need our help?”
Harry pulled away and looked at Draco seriously for a moment. “I want to see you, completely, please, can I?”
“As if I’d care!” She laughed. “But if you’d just bloody listen to me you’d know that you don’t have to rush-”
“I’m not asking you to.” She said quickly. “I was merely making an observation that's all. She told me she is a dear friend of yours and I hope that is true. You deserve to have someone looking out for you in- in a way that I have failed to do so.”
“So did you Draco.” Harry said, turning his hand underneath Draco’s so that they were palm to palm and then curling his fingers around the top of Draco’s hand gently holding it. “You could have become the full fledged Death Eater they were pressuring you to be but you didn’t. That would have been the easy choice for you, fighting against that was hard. You did the bare minimum you had to do to keep yourself and your family alive without ever actually fighting.”
“Er, sorry!” He said half mortified. “I er, haven’t actually eaten today. You hungry? Shall I fix us up some lunch?”
Then Draco stood up elegantly from the table. Everything he did was elegant, Harry thought to himself, just watching him do simple everyday things is beautiful. “I’m going to go have a shower and get dressed. I’ll meet you in your study?”
Draco seemed worried about Harry’s lack of response to his question and suddenly spoke again in a soft understanding voice that Harry had never heard him use before. It was slow and melodic, calming, almost hypnotic. It made Harry just want to listen to Draco for ages.
“Fine thanks love.” Hermione said back smiling. “Harry took Rose all afternoon so I managed to get all my work done. She’s really good for him.”
Daphne separated herself from Blaise and came over to hold Draco’s hand. “It really is her Draco and she’s her of her own volition, Lucius isn’t behind this.”
“Besides I will give you my entire vault if it turns out he doesn’t fancy you every bit as much as you fancy him.” Blaise said smugly.
All of a sudden he felt his whole body become stiff and he couldn’t move. Just as his rigid form began to fall backwards he floated into the air instead and his petrified body was laid onto the bed. He couldn’t move, he couldn’t speak all he could do was listen to Harry as he spoke.
Ron took a nice booth at the back and Harry went to the bar to buy drinks. He deliberately chose the least alcoholic lager on tap for himself but got Ron his favourite real ale and a packet of pork scratchings that he loved so much.
“Just a big gash in his foot that seemed to trail behind him but I fixed him up. He’s resting, it might scar but I doubt there will be any lasting damage. He can’t remember where he was though or who he slept with… I know he likes to have fun but he’s not usually so careless with it…” George said quietly looking down at his plate that he’d stopped eating too.
“Come on Harry!” Blaise said back, giving Harry a bit of a flirty look that Draco had seen him use countless times before on anyone who was vaguely attractive. “Where is your sense of fun and adventure?!”
“It’s lovely to meet you too, please call me Daphne, after all we’re all friends here.” She spoke in a warm playful tone as George straightened back up. “And I’m glad to hear Harry has been talking me up but you should hear what he was saying about you! I’m afraid he has given you a lot to live up to George, I was a bit worried he wanted you for himself!”
Narcissa was a little warmer and would sometimes ask the aurors polite but friendly questions about themselves as she would have done when getting to know strangers at a dinner party, nothing too personal. Williamson would always answer in an equally polite and friendly way but never gave too much away. Proudfoot however seemed quite happy to talk about himself, not in a conceited way but in an open and engaging manner often sharing anecdotes about what he and his little sisters got up to when they were younger. No one ever asked about the trial and certainly no one ever mentioned the war.
It's the 1st of September and Draco dresses in his Slytherin robes again to go meet the Headmistress and find out exactly how the repeated 7th year system is going to work.
Hermione wacked Ron over the arm pretending to me more cross with him than Harry suspected she was and then addressed Harry.
There was a slightly awkward silence once more and Draco wondered if he’d snapped a little harshly. Part of him wanted to accept the offer, he could pay for a few things after all, but he wasn’t even sure what to ask for in terms of ingredients as he wasn’t confident he’d know how to prepare them anyway.
“I think so.” Fred said softly. “But you still need to be the one to say it.” He reached out and put a hand on the back of Harry’s neck and rubbed it softly.
Saturday was a nice normal day now that Draco was slowly getting used to his new normal. He had sat down with Daphne last Sunday after last week didn’t go so well and they’d spent some time properly planning and thinking through the week to come up with a new routine they could stick to. Draco felt much better afterwards and the first week of their more structured days had gone well.
He sighed inwardly thinking of the plans he had to make his sitting room more homely. They would have to wait.
Harry chuckled and pulled Draco’s head back slightly so that he could look down at his face. Draco’s eyes met his and they were stormy grey with desire.
“Minister” Lucius said, bowing his head ever so slightly as he did so without breaking eye contact with the man.
“Seriously, even though it pissed me off that you were once again the exception to the rule and the centre of attention, I genuinely knew that you were telling the truth.” Draco said. “I always prided myself on being able to read you and your emotions, I couldn’t believe Weasley was stupid enough not to believe you.”
“Oh yeah right, cos he’s gay you mean?” Blaise said back. “Doesn’t mean he didn’t experiment with women first… but you’re probably right to be fair I expect she made the whole thing up.”
Potter had that flush back in his face again. “Er- right, erm, I-I don’t know, she did when Rose was born but she’s older now and she definitely has a bottle, but then er, I suppose Hermione might er, express? Erm, I really don’t know...” He stammered out awkwardly.
The idea was so laughable that Harry couldn’t believe it had even entered his mind. He was hardly in the position to date anyone when he was still recovering from the shock of being left at the fucking altar two days ago. Even if he was, this was
“I think that you were worried about dating because of who you are. You don’t like the publicity that much is obvious so your fame does complicate matters but also to be honest you do seem a bit clueless in the relationship department and clearly out of place with going out.” She smiled and gestured to their fancy surroundings and Harry laughed.
George sighed. “It is, or it will be anyway. We never fight you know that but he was just being a bit of a dick last night. He was in pain and cross with himself and took it out on me that’s all, said some things in the heat of the moment. He said afterwards that he didn’t mean them and he’s apologised but I can’t help but think there was some truth behind them.”
I guess you've realised by now that this story is all about those long conversations between characters and I really like making all aspects of their relationships 'real'. To me that involves drunken conversations about sex with your best mate in a bar and then more serious ones with your partner!
“Oh, well you’re welcome then. As much as it would have been fun to witness you yelling to Goyle that you were gay on top of a burning pile of furniture.” Harry joked.
“So let me get this straight, all your clothes got destroyed but you still bought yourself a luxury silk pyjama and gown set with what little money you had?” He asked in an amused and affectionate sort of way.
I've said before that I will only write smut for the sake of the plot and the development of their relationship but just for the sake of it. I'm writing about relationships and sex is a massive part of a romantic relationship. I wanted to convey all the insecurities and the feelings behind sex. I also wanted to portray how communication is important before, during and after sex and what it can do to deepen a relationship.
“Bit later for that.” Harry sighed, putting his fork down and running his hand through his hair. “Just tell me please, I’ll feel guilty either way but I’d rather know.”
Harry frowned again. “Erm, OK… a bit too defensive there Fred. You know it’s obviously fine if you are.” He pointed out casually.
“Thank you.” He said faintly. Then he took a deep breath and felt his strength come back so he spoke again in a normal tone. “I’m sorry, I just had a bad memory.”
That was when someone, Harry couldn’t remember who, had suggested that why do shots and the rest of the night was a bit hazy.
“OK then, if you’re sure.” Harry shrugged. Then his expression turned to something else that Draco couldn’t quite read. He looked like he realised something but then flushed slightly. “Just, er, do what you need to do and erm, don’t rush, you know… I’ll be fine here with er, with the TV.”
“Not an autobiography as such.” Harry continued. “There’s still a lot about my private life that I don’t want to include, but to finally tell the world the true story of who Tom Riddle was and how he was defeated, yes by me but also by so many others, even you guys!” He finished with a smile.
Suddenly Draco was on edge again. “Harry, what have you done?” He said quietly in a slightly low warning tone.
“Sorry, I would change back but I have another appointment straight after lunch and I was particularly pleased with my hair today.” Draco stated mildly arrogantly
Draco led him around the white stone path and around the pool area at the back of the hotel just in front of the beach. He got to the main pool bar and gestured to one of the shiny white bar stools.
“Helping to relieve your stress.” Draco replied with a mischievous smile. “It worked well the other day, remember?”
Draco took him by the hand and dragged him up two flights of stairs this time into the Master bedroom instead of the usual three and opened the door of their new room. Harry stepped in happily and looked around. It was beautiful.
“Of course.” Daphne said politely. “If you need some sort of impartial third party then I would be happy to stay while you talk to him? Obviously if you can’t say it in front of me then that’s fine too.”
Draco’s room was tiny, it consisted of a single bed, a bedside table with a lamp and a small wardrobe. Certainly not what he was used to. Some basics had been sent over by the aurors from the Manor such as clothes and a few of Draco’s old school books but there was nothing in them to really interest him and he found the four walls of his room very depressing. He was pretty much forced to be in there from ten o’clock at night until seven o’clock in the morning. Williamson always took the night guard shift; he took his duty very seriously and didn't like Draco wandering about. Draco never slept anymore, when he slept the nightmares came and he would wake shaking and shivering screams replaying in his head, sometimes his own, sometimes those of others. It would always take him a few minutes to remember that the war is over and he wouldn’t be forced to torture anyone today or be tortured himself -not physically anyway.
As soon as he started brewing things were going wrong. Draco was never clumsy, ever yet so far today he’d dropped two pairs of scales, broken three glass vials and knocked a whole cauldron of almost finished potion off the bench.
Fred was still half asleep but answered automatically. “It’s a potions shop.” He said closing his eyes again.
Draco went down the stairs and Harry leaned back onto the headboard of the bed happily. At least things weren’t awkward between them, that would have been horrible… and Harry could kiss Draco anytime he liked. That’s what Draco had said, that thought made Harry smile.
“Erm, well yes it does, er, Teddy is your family really.” Harry said nervously. “He’s Tonks and Remus’s son. You know, erm, your cousin.”
For the second time that evening Potter frowned at him and Draco reprimanded himself. He had long abandoned being mean to others and putting them down, he did not believe himself to be better than anyone now not like the way he used to. In fact he had rather a low opinion of himself these days with anything that wasn’t to do with his business. He was also genuinely trying to be nice. It was just easy to slip into old habits sometimes, especially regarding Potter and his friends.
The war still haunted him and he didn’t know why. It had been seven years, everyone else had moved on and were focusing on their lives now but he just couldn’t. What was wrong with him? He didn’t know how to live in a time of peace, he was still paranoid everywhere he went and couldn’t help feeling on edge. His magic had grown so much stronger after the war, he’d trained hard when he first joined the aurors and he got so much more control over his power. He could act when he needed to and trust that his magic would do the right thing in the right way. Over the past couple of years though he’d slowly started losing control of it. It was small at first but the more uneasy he grew the less control he had and now he felt like he couldn’t trust it. Couldn’t trust himself. Sometimes he felt like he should talk to someone about it but he wasn’t sure who that person would be. He looked at Ron with his wife and child, a nice home to go back to after work, a family surrounding him, a good steady job and he couldn’t help feeling jealous.
Draco relaxed a bit and looked back at Proudfoot. “Well Potions has always been my favourite but of course adequate knowledge of plants is beneficial to this subject”
Harry was also strangely fine too. There was a tinge of sadness when Harry looked around his bedroom at Grimmauld Place knowing that he would be back to sleeping here alone every night which he hated, sleeping in Fred’s bed last night had been so comforting and familiar, it was that he would miss more than anything. His four poster bed here was much larger and that made it feel so much emptier to Harry. Maybe one day he would find someone to share it with. Despite the fact that he still had absolutely no idea how to make it happen from here, Harry felt like he’d taken the first step towards securing his future happiness with this vague figure of a man and little children of their own coming into his head just that little bit clearer.
He left the two new best friends to it whilst he got up and had a quick exchange with JP. Then he came to settle himself back on the sand next to Harry who was happily sat with Biscuit resting his head on Harry’s thigh. OK, now Draco really was jealous of a dog, that was just great.
“Yes.” Draco said simply, then he hesitated for a moment a brief wave of familiar insecurity fluttering through him. “Do you not?” He asked cautiously.
“Hey, this just just arrived for you. It’s from Professor McGonnagall. I’ll leave you to it but when you’ve written the reply just let me know and I’ll seal it and send it off for you.”
“That’s the dowager house.” She explained. “My grandmother lives there, but don’t worry she won’t bother us. Also My parents and Astoria are having dinner with my future brother-in-law and his parents so that’s good!”
“Good.” Harry said. “We have a busy day today so one more night in here and then tomorrow we’ll sleep in our new room.”
Just then Kreacher popped into the hallway and did the most formal low bow that Draco had ever seen him do. He was even wearing a brand new crisp clean white rag instead of the dirty one he usually wore and he had a small navy necktie on too, clearly trying to make an impression. Draco knew from Harry that Kreacher had been given clothes but he just refused to wear them.
“What’s got you looking so serious George?” Bill called out from halfway down the table and a few pairs of eyes looked over their way.
“Good, sorry I was just checking. So what did it say? I presume they were asking you if you knew of my whereabouts?” Draco asked.
Then he felt a sudden crushing pain looking at Harry passed on on his bed. He was still angry at him and no doubt they would have to talk about this, but talk is what they would do. No more shouting, no more getting angry, no more making Harry force himself to try and control his emotions, his magic. That wouldn’t solve anything. Harry did best when he was just talking and being honest with Draco by his side reassuring him. That’s what they would do when Harry woke up.
That seemed to explain matters to her as she chuckled and shook her head slightly. “You English with your strange ways of saying family names. Harry is much better…. Well welcome.” She said with a warm smile.
Draco sighed. “Maybe I guess but the reality of the situation is we only agreed that I would be here for a month or two, we never discussed anything more…”
The party did indeed go on pretty much all night. Particularly since around midnight Fleur went into labour just as Fred had set off another round of fireworks. Of course Molly said it was all Fred’s fault! The Weasley matriarch then went into panic mode but Bill was calm and controlled as ever. He was getting ready to take Fleur to St. Mungos but the labour was just progressing too quickly for her to be moved so in the end he floo called for a healer and one stepped through the fireplace to deliver the baby instead.
“Wandless magic” Draco said to himself shaking his head slightly in disbelief as he sat down opposite Harry.
There was part of his brain screaming no, he absolutely was not OK with that. Fred was still part of Harry’s life, hell he is part of Draco’s life too they were supposed to be working on some new products together… Surely now every time he’d see Fred he’d think ‘you slept with my boyfriend’ and that was not something the possessive side of him was happy about.
“Harry? You know people usually wait until after work to come and raid our alcohol cupboard!” Fred said with a half smile but then when Harry looked up and made eye contact with him Fred’s face turned slightly more serious.
Harry and Draco had a bit of a serious chat over breakfast where they talk about Harry's issues for once.
He turned to the female house elf and used a polite but still authoritative voice. “Well in that case Hopsy thank you for staying on to look after Mother, it is appreciated. I trust that she will organise the terms of your employment but I shall leave that to her. However, whilst you’re in this house you need to appreciate that things work a little differently. By all means assist Mother with whatever she needs for the duration of her stay but Harry and I are the masters of this house so please respect that. Harry likes to cook so unless he asks for your assistance then just leave him to it he is quite capable.”
Draco felt really happy that he’d done something to help Harry and proud that it had been something he’s thought of and adapted especially. This is what he was good at, this is why he liked his work, seeing the smile on Harry’s face had definitely been worth the effort and the man deserved to sleep at night after everything he’d been through.
Hopsy was looking a little bit sad which made Draco feel guilty but she did need to be told. He was at least being polite to her which was certainly more than his father had ever been. Still he decided maybe a compromise was in order, change was probably difficult for her too.
He tried to relax Sunday but his nerves were getting the better of him. He knew everything was ready to open the shop for business Monday morning but it didn’t stop him spending the whole day checking everything and then double checking. He resisted the urge to floocall Daphne and go through everything with her again, she deserved a day off and Draco had to trust her that she had taken his instructions in and knew what she was doing. He meditated again before bed as he did every night but it still didn’t stop him lying awake most of the night thinking about how the next day would be his first official day of trading to the public. Would anyone actually come? What if this whole shop was a stupid idea and it failed completely? Only one way to find out he supposed.
Draco turned to him and raised his eyebrow in a playful way. “Got something to tell me Harry? Have you got a secret love child out there somewhere?!”
Draco wasn’t sure of Harry’s routine in the mornings or what time he usually got up but if last week was anything to go by then he probably slept in. Although, he had been on dreamless sleep then and he wasn’t now. Draco was still a bit worried about that, there was obviously a reason why the man relied on it so much and seemingly has done for years. It would be hard to just stop it and he had seemed tired yesterday. He didn’t want to risk waking Harry up but at the same time he really did need to get a move on if he was going to move all his stuff, set up a new potions lab here and get to work on the orders he’d received yesterday.
Oh well, he had no idea what pre-wedding stress was like and Astoria plus Mrs Greengrass were a force to be reckoned with, it probably was a bit difficult for Daphne at home he’d have to cut her some slack.
For the first time since he had arrived he felt glad he came. This is exactly what he needed. He could actually be selfish today for the first time in his life as there was no one else here to please. There was also no one bossing him around either. He had no schedule, no one telling him what to do, what to eat, where to be.
“Not at all Auror Proudfoot, you’re just in time for afternoon tea. Let us sit.” Narcissa gestured to the modest round glass table to her right. They each took one of the elegant black iron garden chairs, that were more comfortable than they looked, before a house elf suddenly appeared wearing a frilly yellow apron, that Draco had never seen before, and pushing a trolley.
“It’s not pity Draco, it’s just what people do when they care about each other. Please let me help you, it’s not charity it’s called friendship and you can help me too… It doesn’t have to be one sided... We all need help from time to time and there’s nothing with that, please… You can’t live here, it’s not suitable… I- I’m worried about you. I can help you fix it up… or better yet, just- just come and live with me? It’s a big house, loads of space and lots of food. It can be temporary if you want, just until you-”
“George? What did he do?” Harry asked interested to see if this was going where he thought it might.
“Yeh, she mentioned Malfoy actually, confirmed the split but said they were still friends or something, it was a bit odd actually but…” Harry trailed off and noticed that the twins were avoiding his eye. He once again felt like he was missing something.
“Ok, well honesty is good but I’m glad you’re ok with it.” Harry said slowly and then shrugged. “Still you know how to find me now which not many people do so come anytime I guess.”
Harry, realising something, jumped in. “I should say that the letters I believe were actually written by Narcissa Malfoy, Lucius’ current legal wife or Narcissa Black which is her birth name and the name she will be returning to once her divorce has gone through. However, Mr. Malfoy was making her write the letters. I’m not quite sure how but Ms Black can fill us in. She is currently at my home with Mr Black, Mr Zabini and Miss Greengrass who are our other witnesses.”
If it was any other time Draco would be thinking about the fact that this was the first time he’d actually seen them together and how good they looked but right now all he could think of was that Daphne was alright.
“We’re playing at home so you have your box Harry plus my players box. Really no excuse! Bring whoever you want.” Ginny said casually.
“Merlin Potter is there anywhere you haven’t looked?” Draco finally looked at him but his eyes weren’t the beautiful silver ones that Harry had seen last night. Instead these were the cold grey stones that he remembered from school. The eyes of Lucius Malfoy.
Harry stroked the top of Fred’s short ginger hair but it wasn’t really long enough for him to run his fingers through it.
Brewing was not going to happen today, he just wasn’t in the right frame of mind for it. Fortunately he’d worked for so many hours on Monday that he was all up to date with his work. He would take the day off today and then work all day Sunday on the new commissions that had just come in to make up for it. He paced around upstairs in his flat and waited until it was an acceptable time to floo call Harry.
“Well if you need your confidence boosting then you're actually better looking than him, it’s your eyes… they're even nicer than his.” Harry’s voice seemed more relaxed there and there was a definite warmth to it.
It was quite casual tonight really, just Blaise and Daphne round after all but he actually found himself hoping for an excuse to dress up more formally in all the different muggle style suits he now owned as well as multiple sets of different dress robes. He paired the jeans with a tight white V-neck t-shirt similar to the one he’d worn at the quidditch except this one was made to fit him properly and was a much nicer quality. Then he hung a loose black shirt over the top with the sleeves slightly rolled up. You could see his black leather wand holster but it didn’t much matter. He still wore it primarily as he didn’t want to see what was underneath but everyone tonight knew what was there and liked him anyway which was comforting.
Harry coughed into his beer and spluttered a bit. It was not very elegant but it made Draco smile, when has Harry ever been elegant? Draco couldn’t help but think Blaise could have been smoother. He hadn't expected this to come up in the conversation so soon, weren’t they supposed to be deciding what to eat? Still, now it was out there he was eager to hear Harry’s response.
Potter broke out in a cheeky grin that Draco couldn’t help but smile at. He could get used to seeing Potter’s face like that, he thought to himself.
Harry used to see Hermione at work pretty much everyday too. The three of them often used to have lunch together at the Ministry and then there were pub nights with other Ministry colleagues, the twins and old school friends every Friday night too. Then Ron and Hermione had started wedding planning which had taken a bit of their focus and free time. Harry was happy for them of course but there were only so many conversations about flowers and colour schemes that he could take. Not long after the wedding Hermione had become pregnant and she hadn’t had an easy time of it. She’d been quite poorly during it and ended up taking maternity leave early so she was no longer around at work. Ron had often left early to go and look after her and he hardly ever joined pub nights after that. The others also started settling down and doing their own thing so pub nights had just slowly stopped over time.
“You already made your coffee.” Draco pointed out looking at the empty mug on the floor next to him.
Harry stood as well taking Fred’s hand and allowing himself to be led to the sofa. They sat down on either end of the small sofa and half turned to face each other. Fred shifted their hands so they could be comfortable but they didn’t let go of each other.
Harry said the stuff he’d been rehearsing in his head. It was true really, all of it, he just left out the fact that he had already realised he was in love with him and that they were living together… oh and that it was Draco Black née Malfoy.
Clearly by the time they reached the top floor landing Harry had clearly been overthinking this. Why were their bedrooms on the top floor again? Why did he have an anti-disapparition jinx on his house? Maybe he should reconsider that...
Blaise sat back in his chair again and spoke confidently. “I always thought you were the most stubborn person I knew but you might have met your match with Harry. You can’t vanquish a dark Lord at 17 without a fuck ton of determination. Winning you back is hardly the most difficult thing he’s faced and he won’t back down from a challenge. You really think after one fight he’s just going to give up and walk away?”
Draco abandoned his half drunk cup of coffee on the bedside table and leaned forward to capture Harry’s mouth in a kiss. Those words had been everything he had wanted to hear and his heart was beating out of his chest. Harry floated his own cup so he could also focus all his attention on their kiss at this moment. This is what mattered, the two of them, that was more important than anything.
“Will you- will you stay with me?” He said to the man standing besides him, supporting him as always.
“To you and Draco.” Daphne said as she raised hers and Blaise added “and your magnificent home together.”
Harry stepped forward quickly and placed one hand on the back of Draco’s neck draping his arm around the uninjured side.
The rest of Thursday was very uneventful fortunately and the new couple had a lovely normal evening in as usual. Friday rolled around with yet another night of Harry sleeping in Draco’s bed which was fine. Harry was sleeping much better which was good, Draco was sleeping slightly worse but it wasn’t drastic and he did like knowing Harry was sleeping. Draco still valued his privacy though and sent Harry out whenever he needed to get dressed and they very much still showered separately.
Blaise was looking at Lucius too but with an unimpressed expression like he was just dirt on his shoe. It was a look that Blaise gave people a lot and most people thought he believed he was above others but Draco knew he didn’t really feel like that about most people. Lucius might be the exception though. Blaise was still using his wand to control the trunks but Draco knew he’d be ready to use it against the older man if he needed to. Hopefully it wouldn’t come to that.
Then he felt the familiar warmth of the slight rough skin of Harry’s hand rest gently over the top of his and give it a little squeeze. Without realising it Draco lifted his head to look into Harry’s eyes. What he saw there was enough to make his heart stop beating. He saw genuine care and he wasn’t sure if anyone had ever looked at him the way Harry was right now.
Draco sighed and put his head in his hands. “Oh well, it was always too good to be true anyway. Maybe it’s best to end it this way before anything really got started. I don’t think I could bear to lose him once I knew what it was like to actually have him.”
“That’s not entirely true.” Harry said quickly before he could stop himself. She turned to look at him in surprise once more. He hadn’t really thought this through and he couldn’t exactly stop and discuss it with the other people involved now. He hesitated slightly and glanced at Draco who didn’t look convinced but he gave one short sharp nod anyway.
“Better put some actual clothes on then I guess, if we’re going to the market.” He said quickly, standing up and walking back into the bedroom area.
Harry’s breath caught in his chest as he watched Draco’s beautiful silver eyes sparkle and then darken in the centre with obvious desire. “For what?”
“Of course he is!” Said Fred summoning a brightly coloured box from George’s open bedroom door whilst he carried on talking. “When we played it was Ron in Moaning Myrtle’s bathroom with a Mandrake!”
“What happens to you?” Draco said quietly, finally finding his voice and looking at Harry with a mixture of emotions running through him.
“You did.” Draco said fondly. “You have faced the most evil wizard of all time Auror Potter not to mention a couple of his friends, I’m sure you can cope with my mother. The fact that she hasn’t said she disapproves means she approves she’s just not ready to say it yet.”
“You’re spending an awfully long time looking at my outfit, is there something wrong with it?” She asked with a playful smile.
“Graham?” Ron questioned. “Who the fuck is Graham? Merlin Harry, how many people did you involve in this before you came to me?”
Waking up today was the first time that he didn’t feel that worry lurking under the surface. He knew at least that it wouldn’t happen today, or tomorrow for that matter or the next few months, the next few years. Hopefully now that day will never come. For today he knew that Lucius Malfoy was waking up secured to a bed in St. Mungos.
Once the black headed man had recovered he looked at Blaise suspiciously. “Why the sudden interest in my love life Blaise?”
Before the war, was what she had avoided saying, nicely rescued anyway and Draco couldn’t argue with the need to start new traditions.
Draco was still eyeing him carefully but then elegantly moved off the fireplace and took one step forward to close the gap.
It did mean though that Harry and Draco were free to get started on Draco’s mail owl orders for the day. Harry had agreed to help Draco so they could get the first round of dispatches done quickly and then have the middle part of the day to work on the book together. Harry was due at Hermione’s at three so Draco would have time to do the second dispatch then before working hours were done. Then they were both actually planning on being out tonight but separately.
Admiring the complete look he was happy. This was the outfit he’d bought with Pierre in mind and would be wearing to all his appointments. Hopefully his customers would just see him as a man of habit and routine who owned multiple navy slacks and white shirts rather than a poor man who could only afford one outfit. He was dressed in simple navy slacks with a brown belt and brown shoes with a white shirt open at the collar but his neck was covered in an elegant patterned brown and blue cravat that added some style to the outfit. His sleeves were ever so slightly rolled up but any glimpse of the dark mark was covered with a specialised wand holster that he never took off. It was a lot thicker than the normal models so it covered the inside of his left forearm completely and was made of leather with two bands that held it in place around his wrist and just below his elbow. It was charmed so he could change it to any colour. Usually his preference was black but as Pierre he wore brown leather belts and shoes so he changed it to match.
Who wants to see Harry and Draco curl up on the sofa together with popcorn and watch Lord of the Rings?! I do!! <3
Harry shook his head in amusement. This is definitely not where he thought this was going but he would give his little prince anything he wanted. He returned a couple of minutes later wearing the, now clean, outfit Draco had requested.
“Well I dunno, if you really want someone to spend your money on then maybe I should start charging you for them.” Draco said, pretending to be annoyed.
Then Draco broke away again and looked at Harry slightly nervously and slightly mischievously. It was an odd combination. “Will you humour me with something?” He asked.
Harry trailed off and then suddenly became aware of Draco’s change in posture. He was sitting stiffly, tense in anger and his eyes were no longer soft but a sea of swirling grey like a stormcloud waiting to erupt.
Then he cleared his throat and looked up at Draco again. “It’s not control if I’m asking for your help in making a decision.”
Daphne nodded gently. “She told me everything and I believe her Draco but you should hear it from her. She’s not here to hurt you, she’s here because she misses you and she cares about you darling.”
“Sure, I get that. If that’s what you want then I hope you find someone, I’m sure you will.” Harry said honestly. “But you know that George will never leave you behind right? Even if he does move out and get married or whatever, you’re still always going to be his brother, his best friend and his business partner. You’ll still see each other everyday.”
Draco swallowed thickly inches away from Harry’s face. He spoke so quietly that Harry barely heard him but there was still no mistaking the words. “The- the only future I want is- is with you.”
Harry ordered a pint of cobra, whatever that was. Blaise indicated he’d have the same but then when she looked at Draco he had a mild panic. Was he supposed to order this snake drink too? He didn’t know what he’d be ordering and he hadn’t had a chance to look at the menu. Surely muggles had wine but he didn’t know what sort they had, he didn’t do what would go best with the food either.
Harry grinned. It might not sound like a lot but from Ron it meant the world. He could go home to Draco tonight and tell him that everything really would be OK. He also felt hugely relieved at not having to hide anything from his best friends anymore, he actually really hadn't liked that but now he didn’t have to.
Harry sighed again and held out his hand to wandlessly summon the bottle. He took a swig as Fred and George chuckled and then he said reluctantly. “Yes, you may have a point!”
He shook his head slightly. “No, not yet. I nearly have so many times but something keeps holding me back. I think he does love me too. I just- well I think it’s a bigger deal for him than it is for me and I’m not sure if he’s ready to say it back or not. I wasn’t even sure if he was ready to hear it but if I don’t tell him soon then I might go crazy.”
“You- you sure?” Ron said quietly looking up at Harry as Rose was gripping onto Harry’s finger and gurgling.
“Thanks.” Draco said sincerely. “Guess there is nothing to do now but wait.” He sighed wondering for the hundredth time if Daphne really was OK and what on earth his mother was saying to her.
“IT IS FUCKED UP AND I’M SORRY, I’M SO FUCKING SORRY BUT I DIDN’T KNOW WHAT ELSE TO DO. I COULDN’T SAVE CEDRIC, I COULDN’T SAVE PERCY AND REMUS AND TONKS AND THE 47 OTHERS WHO DIED THAT DAY, AND SIRIUS DIED BECAUSE I MADE THE WRONG CALL, BECAUSE I FELL INTO VOLDEMORT'S TRAP AND I COULDN’T SAVE HIM BUT I CAN STILL SAVE YOU. I WILL SAVE YOU. DON’T YOU SEE DRACO? I HAVE TO SAVE YOU BECAUSE I THINK YOU MIGHT POSSIBLY BE THE BEST DAMN THING THAT’S EVER HAPPENED TO ME IN MY LIFE. I HAVE TO PROTECT YOU NO MATTER WHAT THE COST BECAUSE I THINK IF I LOSE YOU I MIGHT JUST LOSE MYSELF. I HAVE TO KEEP YOU SAFE BECAUSE I KNOW IT’S ONLY BEEN FIVE FUCKING DAYS SINCE WE KISSED BUT I THINK I MIGHT BE FALLING FOR YOU ALREADY AND I CAN’T LOSE YOU TOO…”
“It always matters what you wear Draco, you know that as well as anyone and you’re clearly worrying about it otherwise you wouldn’t still be in your dressing gown at 11 o’clock in the morning!” Blaise countered clearly amused.
“OK.” Draco said, he’d get the full story in the morning but for now it was late and it seemed like everything was fine. “I’m going to get your sprays OK and then you can sleep here tonight. Let’s get you under the covers.”
His orgasm was definitely the best one he’d ever had on it’s own and he couldn’t believe how intense it was. How real what he was imagining felt as he cried Harry’s name when he spilled into his own hand.
Daphne came down into the potions lab at lunchtime after knocking on the door so that Draco could let the wards down. They had agreed to close the shop for an hour each lunchtime so that Daphne could have a decent break. Some of the other smaller shops on the street did this too so most people knew not to come during lunchtime if they only had a short time to shop. She told him that generally speaking it had been quiet outside as a whole but pretty much everyone that passed had come in to have a nosey and they all had good things to say. She sold one expensive perfume and one cheaper eau de cologne as well as some basic potions. One lady had also ordered a calming lavender themed large gift set to be delivered next week. Draco’s spirits were lifted immediately. It had clearly been a decent first morning.
“Erm, no.” He said sheepishly. “Kind of forgot I guess and it’s still early, I didn’t think it would be this hot yet. Been keeping out of the midday sun so far and I deliberately covered up yesterday when we were out on the water.”
Draco hesitated and when he spoke his voice was little louder than a whisper. “Did you really mean it when you invited me to move in with you or were you just saying that?”
He stepped back from her and took a deep breath. “I guess I just feel a little alone at the moment which is ridiculous because I see you almost everyday and I’m used to sleeping alone it’s just… well I thought maybe I wanted to go out and meet someone with Blaise and I just couldn’t do it. It was awful, guys coming on to me left, right and center-”
“I’m not saying it wasn’t accurate, it was, and I know I was a right brat, but to read about myself like that in your words, to really see myself as you would have seen me... it stung I’m not going to lie.” Draco carried on in a slow, calm voice taking moments to breathe deeply when he needed to but otherwise controlling himself well.
I'm trying to write it so that different small groups and pairings get together at different times. No Blaise or Daphne today but don't worry they'll be back and at at one point I'll finally get the six of them all together at once!
Breakfast today was a slightly less serious affair than yesterday but they confirmed their plans for the day and engaged in light conversation which just came naturally to them now. Afterwards Harry had gone upstairs to get ready and Draco had gone to talk to Kreacher about dinner plans tonight. As Harry predicted Kreacher seemed very excited about it but also slightly nervous and Draco assured him that it really didn’t need to be anything grand.
Then he added in a voice that was so soft Draco wasn’t sure later if he’d imagined it or if the words had really left Harry’s mouth.
Daphne was true to her word and left him alone in the bedroom for about an hour. He didn’t even know how he felt anymore, everything was conflicting and nothing made sense. Was it possible to feel completely full of emotion but hopelessly empty at the same time? His life at the Manor for two years had been completely regimented. He’d had a strict routine, he’d known exactly what he was doing every day and nothing ever changed. It had been completely void of emotion, cold and empty. He’d spent every evening dining with his parents, living a lie to their faces being forced to watch everything he said and did, planning, scheming and patiently playing the long game. He’d hated every second of it but at the same time it had been what he knew, familiar, easy in a way and he almost missed it.
“Potter I think we’ll be spending adequate time together on this project, let’s not push it shall we?” Draco said flatly.
It's not as good as others I've seen, I've kept it simple in terms of the shape but I thought I'd share it with you so you can visualise the layout.
Harry couldn’t help but let out a small low laugh at how well Fred could read him. “Er, yeah I did actually.” He admitted.
He knew realistically that probably wouldn’t be for a while. Draco was probably holding back for the same reasons that Harry was, you always had to play it a bit cool at the beginning and this certainly was the beginning. They hadn’t talked about any feelings or admitted any sort of attraction for each other, it was far too early for that, but Harry felt sure that one way or another it would happen eventually.
“What?!” Draco’s eyes went comically wide in surprise and his mouth was hanging open for a second in a very uncharacteristic way which made Harry laugh again. “I-I don’t understand, how could you not know, well, anything… I grew up knowing all about ‘the-boy-who-lived’ and you, you didn’t know? Why…?”
“Does he have a name?” Harry asked Draco, still looking at this beautiful creature not quite believing it.
“Thank you for clarifying the events for us further Mr. Potter and your account does indeed tally with the testimony we have already heard from Mrs. Malfoy.” The Minister said before turning his attention back to Draco once more.
Harry was quite happy with the soup, it did have depth of flavour and the cheese on top was really nice. Everyone else seemed to like it and Harry got a lot of pleasure in watching Draco in particular enjoy the french cuisine. Draco looked over at him approvingly and placed a hand on his thigh and gave it a gentle squeeze.
“I’m not sure, but there’s a lot of liquid on the floor. To be honest it doesn't look like he had a chance to drink much of it at all.”
“Thank you.” Draco said in a quiet sincere voice. “For everything… last night was just… Well, just thank you.” He said smiling at Harry softly.
He hadn’t seen his parents since Easter having returned to school for the term with his mother’s wand. He had tried to get his wand back from Potter thinking then at least he could return Mother’s to her when he found her, but that hadn’t worked out too well. His mother’s wand had been left in that room somewhere, now destroyed by the Fiendfyre that had almost killed them and Potter had kept Draco’s wand so now Draco was wandless again.
Harry was still sleeping deeply next to him but it was early and Draco was in no hurry to wake him. He liked being around Harry but this little pocket of time first thing in the morning when his mind was alert and fresh was precious to him, it was his time to think, to process. He was still surprised at how well he was coping in his new relationship. He hadn’t been lying to Harry when he said he wanted to take it slow, he’d been worried that at some point he would freak out about all this ‘coupley stuff’ but he hadn't yet. He didn’t like change and this new bedroom was yet another change but somehow, with Harry by his side he thought he could face anything.
He had a fair few suits, when he’d started buying them he always stuck to black, grey or navy but Fred had convinced him to get some coloured suits too even if they weren’t quite as bright as the ones he favoured! Harry normally found himself mixing and matching different items from the three pieces suits just to add a pop of colour without being over the top.
George looked at them and grinned. “Right well I guess that’s my cue to leave. I’ll go give Verity her lunch break seeing as it looks like you’re slacking off this afternoon brother!”
Draco’s heart was almost thumping out of his chest. There it was, Harry had definitely used the male pronoun but didn’t even seem bothered about what he’d just revealed. Deep down he’d known it but it was nice to finally have some confirmation from Harry himself.
Everything Harry said or did seemed to surprise him in a very good way. Harry seemed almost protective of him already as if he would stand up for him if anyone did happen to see him or give him trouble today. The thought of it made Draco swell with pride. It almost made him want to forget about the invisibility cloak and tell the world that they could sod off because Harry Potter himself wanted him to be there with him in his VIP box.
Harry kind of corrected himself and looked slightly flushed. Had he been about to say the ‘l’ word? Draco’s heart was pounding in response to that but he forced himself to stay cool. He might be wrong, after all Harry was just talking about ‘people’ not him specifically. Even if he wasn’t wrong if Harry wasn’t ready to say it then Draco certainly wasn’t going to push it. To be honest he wasn’t sure if he was ready to hear it and he definitely wasn’t ready to say it back which would probably hurt Harry.
“I’ve never even properly been in the drawing room though Kreacher, Harry only uses it for floo calls and it doesn’t feel right to sit in there…” Draco trailed off. “Can’t we just have drinks in the sitting room? Please?”
He knew then that he had to pull himself together. Draco was calling for him and he had to be there just like he promised he would. Draco had been so strong telling his mother, he’d been amazing. This was Harry’s time to be strong too, for both of them. Besides, there was a little part of him that wanted to see Narcissa’s face.
Thanks so much to all you lovely lovely people for continuing to read this and sticking by me even though I've made you wait!
Blaise was looking at him carefully again but he seemed to believe him. “Well Harry is paying tonight so eat as much as you can.” He said in his dry but humorous tone.
“Well we both agreed that homeschooling can sometimes be quite a sheltered experience for children, especially for an only child.” Harry replied. He looked at Narcissa as he said it but he kept all judgement out of his voice.
“She’s fine Draco, it’s not her don’t worry.” Blaise answered hurriedly. “Her mum just sent an owl, it’s her Grandmother. She died in the night so Daphne hurried back home. She was worried about you though and the shop so I told her I’d come and take care of it.”
He placed his hands carefully on the desk and George sat opposite and started to heal him. He cast a numbing charm on the affected areas on his hands and neck and then he started applying the salve to the skin that Draco could no longer feel.
“Well you say you're a regular customer of mine, I do have a number of anonymous clients and I understand completely why you would prefer that. However, if you choose you can let me know your particular account number and I can simply add it to your regular invoice. If not then you can pay in coins when you pick it up next week, I don’t mind.”
Harry was laughing too. “No, that’s not what I meant. I’m definitely not into women but I couldn’t think but think she might be a good match for you George.”
Draco shifted awkwardly in his seat but the others seemed to understand why Draco didn’t want Ronald involved and they didn’t push the matter.
When Harry got back home, accompanied by Ron, Boot and Roberts, Kreacher informed him that everyone was in the drawing room upstairs. Harry led the way and opened the door first. He immediately found Draco’s eyes and smiled at him, putting all the tenderness and comfort into his look whilst Ron couldn’t see his face.
“I’m sure any bedroom will be fine Mr Potter thank you. This house is much nicer than I remember but I do know my way around.” She said formally but it was friendly. “And there’s no need for that, I shall simply ask Hopsy to bring some things over for me if having another house elf around the place will be acceptable to you?”
“What has this book got to do with me?” Draco asked flatly. He didn’t know how he felt so he chose to just give no emotion whatsoever.
Draco noticed that Harry was trying to keep his voice casual too but he could hear it cracking slightly. The man definitely wants children, no doubt about it, thought Draco. That was important information to consider.
Three hours later he was sitting at his desk in the study/library surrounded by notes and feeling much better about the whole process. He’s stuck some of the notes onto the wall where he’d assembled some sort of chapter list and outline for everything he wanted to include. He was going to order a load more parchment paper, ink and some more fancy quills that he could use for dictation and they would magically erase and alter words too. He knew his messy writing and scribbles would never do.
Draco cast some sneaky looks at Potter as he threw everything he needed into the blender and turned it on. The man was at least blending in a bit more today in shorts and a t-shirt but they didn’t exactly go together. He looked like he just pulled the first top and bottoms he could find out of his suitcase and then chucked on some flip flops. He could see now though that Potter had definitely put some muscle on his once scrawny bones. He wasn’t exactly hench or anything, he was still short and lean but his body was no doubt very toned.
Although as he looked over to Harry’s side of the bed he realised that this morning was different for another reason too. Harry wasn’t sleeping soundly next to him, in fact he wasn’t there at all. Just as Draco started to get worried the door opened and Harry walked in already fully dressed and carrying two cups of coffee.
“Of course.” His mother said as if she was offended. “Lucius would never let me free them before but you really think I would want to force control on another creature when I know what it feels like?”
Draco raised his eyebrows at him. “Hmm let’s see, bigger bed, dressing room, better shower, more storage, one less flight of stairs to climb, the real question is why aren’t we in that room already?”
“You got something to tell us?” Was the first thing she said as Blaise just stood next to her sporting a massive, uncharacteristic grin.
“I wasn’t trying to be nosy, I promise, I was trying to do something nice for you.” Harry spoke quickly desperately trying to defend himself. “I was looking for glasses for the wine and then I thought I’d cook for you. I thought maybe you hadn’t eaten-”
Draco followed the lead his father had set by rising to his feet, trying to look more confident than he felt. He sensed his Mother rising beside him too and the three of them stood to face their inevitable doom. Lucius crossed over in front of Draco to stand between his wife and son but slightly in front of them to face Kingsley Shacklebolt. Kingsley had the two aurors either side of him but slightly behind.
Heading back upstairs to get dressed he felt much more awake. It was always easier to get ready after a caffeine hit. He put on some old jeans and a hoody, he would only be working in the back on his own and as much as he did like that he knew how to look good these days, he definitely did still like to be comfortable.
She looked like she was considering that and then the corner of her mouth lifted slightly. “That is a wonderful idea. I think it would be quite cathartic to demolish it and build something new in its place. Afterall I shall need somewhere to live and given what you said at breakfast it needs to be big enough so that my grandchildren can come and stay with me I expect.”
Ron shrugged. “I’m delegating, it’s what good leaders do right? Proudfoot can handle it, we can go if there’s trouble but I’m going where you’re going... partner.” He added with a cheeky smile. “Besides I’m curious to see Malfoy- erm Black, Merlin that’s weird.”
“Er, yes maybe given that you have to look at his bright shop opposite you every day.” Harry laughed nervously.
He felt like he was doing something really wrong, like sneaking in somewhere where he didn’t belong. Except Harry had told him that he was welcome…
He decided for now to ignore Harry’s obvious desire but he would definitely have fun teasing him when their guests were here too. “So what’s on the menu?”
It was quiet for a moment until Harry’s stomach rumbled loudly. He realised that he hadn’t had anything to eat today as Draco had woken him before he’d had breakfast and now it was lunchtime. He didn’t often get that hungry but then he had been eating more since quitting his job and didn’t usually skip meals anymore.
“Well yeah…” Draco agreed. “When you came back with- with Diggory… saying that He was back, I honestly was with everyone else, I had no clue about any of it and I absolutely could not believe it, even though deep down I knew you weren’t lying I wanted to believe you were...”
This here was his home, his home with Harry, and he’d never felt happier in his entire life than he did in this moment as Harry perched on the arm of his chair and kept his arm around him whilst Draco drank and chatted with his three favourite people in the world.
The manor had hosted a number of Death Eaters over the past two years and most of the planning for the war had been done here. The Dark Lord himself had taken over the master suite after Lucius’s failed attempt to get the prophecy had landed him in Azkaban the first time round. Fortunately that suite was in the West Wing away from Draco’s own. The Lestranges had the next biggest suite in the West Wing which had meant his mother was forced into one of the smaller guest suites in the East Wing next to Draco’s. His father had been quietly livid about it when he got broken out of prison but he was too scared to actually voice his opinion. Everyone knew who the real master of the house was at that point.
“I’m the one who can’t make you happy, I’ve always known it but I’ve been selfish keeping hold of you for this long… George has been telling me to end this for months now you know, he said you would never look for true love as long as you had me. He’s a sappy romantic just like you, but I’m just not like that and even though I knew he was right I just couldn’t bring myself to do it... He gave me a pretty hard talking to when I moaned to him about you not staying over on Wednesday. He said I was being selfish and he’s completely right... I wanted to keep you for myself knowing that you were giving yourself exclusively to me and I could never give you that back.” Fred sharply withdrew his hand from Harry and buried his own head in his hands.
Truthfully he hated sleeping in his own bed at home all by myself and had taken a much larger dose of dreamless sleep potion every night at Grimmauld than the small dose he usually took at Fred’s. He had known the minute he left the restaurant last Saturday that everything Daphne had said was spot on but it didn’t make the decision to talk to Fred any easier.
Fred came over to give Harry a big sloppy kiss on the cheek which he whipped off dramatically and Fred laughed just as George joined them in the kitchen.
“You do that.” Draco said pretending like he wasn’t bothered even though he hated missing an opportunity to see post-run Harry.
Good answer, thought Draco, at least he’s not entirely opposed to the idea of being on a date with a man and a Slytherin man no less.
“I’d expect nothing less from a financial man!” Draco said before calling out again. “Blaise, back door.” He said gesturing behind him and locking the front door with a swish of his wand.
Daphne smiled again and elegantly sat down at the table. “I hope you like my choice of restaurant.” She said as she sat.
“Sorry!” George apologised. “I can just see what he meant that’s all.” He said with a bit of a mischievous smile.
And hope you liked the little sexual tension moment at the beginning of the chapter and the little romantic moment at the end!
“Well you know I don’t really like it Ron, I can’t relax and enjoy the game when I know I can be seen. You can’t really blame me after some of the headlines they’ve run over the years…” He mumbled. “Besides the players box will be packed with all of us in it and it’s not just that but I’m also bringing a friend.”
“Just do me a favour ok?” Harry said sternly. “Never tell him they offered it to me first, I don’t want him to know that and act surprised when he tells you his news!”
Teddy and Andromeda come round to Number 12 Grimmauld place and meet Draco and Narcissa for the first time.
“I am slightly concerned about how much time you had to think and plan last night though. I hope you still managed to get some sleep?” Draco asked casually.
Also will they ever get a chance to work on this damn book when there is so much going on in their lives at the moment?!
So I've not had the best week and I really loved being able to escape to the Caribbean with Harry and Draco on this little adventure, I hope you do too!
“Yes my mother moved back there after the war and my maternal grandparents live out there still. Daphne and I visit them at least twice a year and last time Draco came too.” Blaise said back in a friendly manner.
The meeting had actually served two purposes really well. He was genuinely impressed that the man could make a unique blend of products and thought that it would probably end up being the best gift he’d ever given Hermione. He definitely was already planning on giving more business to the shop.
“Anything.” Draco said suggestively, returning Harry’s gaze confidently and even being so bold as to squeeze his grip on Harry’s thigh.
“Draco?! You here… did you make it in OK?” Came the slightly worried tone. Harry, Blaise and Daphne were all looking towards him without being able to actually see him.
“Yes because apparating here takes so much time away from your busy work schedule.” Draco muttered, rolling his eyes.
Draco told Harry that Dean had been surprised to say the least to see him there but Draco told him about his relationship with Harry and even came clean about becoming Pierre. Apparently Dean had taken it well and Harry vowed to himself that he would take him to the pub one night soon and talk to him properly but was pleased with the outcome so far.
“I can convince you further.” Harry said with a smile of his own. This time he reached up to Draco’s face and he trailed his fingers up it and through his hair as he was so fond of doing. “You know the other main difference between me and Ron in the field over the past few years?”
At four o’clock Draco had just finished his appointments for the day and was just transforming his facial features back into his own when Daphne came into his office looking worried about something. She didn’t even sit down like she usually did she just hovered by his desk for a minute until he looked up. Immediately when he saw her face he knew something was wrong.
“Weasley doesn’t like you being friends with them?” Draco asked, a bit irritated with that thought. “That seems a bit petty.”
“Yeah, he’s the best.” Draco agreed. “They send me a parcel twice a year too, for Christmas and my birthday that Mother organises with Blaise and he sends it to me through the muggle post.”
“Draco, there’s a difference between control and guidance.” Harry said gently. “I know you would never want to make me do anything but you need to accept that you do still influence my decisions. It’s in a good way though. I want to take your opinion into consideration because I respect you and what you have to say. Not to mention you’re annoying astute about things…. You seem to know what’s -what’s best for me.” He mumbled and half laughed.
“I want to give you the opportunity to change that. Use the book to tell your real story too and that of the Malfoy name.” Potter explained calmly looking into Draco’s eyes with those beautiful bright green ones that were now soft and full of empathy.
Blaise sighed as he knew realistically that Draco was right. Daphne looked crushed too not knowing what else to suggest.
Harry was mildly confused about what had just happened and felt like he was missing something again. “He’s gone to Bill’s?” He asked Fred who just nodded.
Harry cut her off quickly. “I know it doesn’t and he knows that too. He’s not using it as an excuse but- well maybe his words will be better than mine. Here.” Harry said, taking the letters out of his back pocket and giving Hermione the one addressed to her.
“Yeah it does.” Harry said leaning up to kiss Draco on the tip of his aristocratic looking nose. “Come on then, show me.”
“Yes that would be fine, thank you. If you don’t mind I do like to avoid the crowds, would I be able to come first thing like today while you are quiet?” He asked looking behind him as he could sense the street outside getting slightly busier and a couple of witches were looking excitedly into the window of the new shop.
Suddenly Teddy started getting cross as he thought he was being ignored and his hair was turning red slowly. Harry knew from past experience that it would be a bad thing if they left it until his whole head of hair was an angry shade of red.
“Fair enough, it does make sense.” Harry said honestly. “It’s just strange that’s all. This whole thing is surreal, you’re just so… different. You don’t even look the same.”
First note:  I know nothing about Caribbean tourism and local livelihood/poverty so this story may not be an accurate reflection on real life there at all. I have done zero research on that area I'm just using it to show Harry and Draco each how much they care and how they are both quite kind, sensitive and caring. I just thought it made for a good story that is all so please keep that in mind for this chapter and the next one.
Then it struck him. Of course, that bastard had an invisibility cloak. So it was possible… but if ‘The Saviour’ had been there the whole time then why didn’t he intervene? Say something, do something! The idiot was a man of action who reacted on instinct, this Draco knew. That foolish Gryffindor ‘bravery’ would have kicked in so maybe Potter was making it up, but then why would he do that? Draco was more confused than ever now but his thoughts were once again interrupted by the man leading this trial.
“I- well yes I kind of made it yesterday and Ron was obviously happy about it and no doubt told everyone…” He half rambled and then got back on the right train of thought. “But like I said, I haven’t signed a contract and it’s not too late to change my mind if you don’t think it’s the best thing for me, for- for us… you know, with my whole ‘hero-complex’ thing that you pointed out to me.”
“Yeah I can see that.” Harry said kind of awkwardly. He didn’t know too much about Blaise’s personal life or what his relationship with his mother was like but he heard rumours about her which were kind of shocking. “Would you ever want to settle down with someone though long-term just without marrying them?”
Potter sat at the bar with his head in his heads until Draco presented a green looking drink in front of him. To his surprise Potter took one look at it but didn’t give any reaction at all before taking it and drinking the whole thing.
Draco was looking around him at Harry’s room properly for the first time as he ate and when he spoke it was slightly hesitant. “Harry… why do you have a single bed?”
He’d noticed something very odd though when he had been in the drawing room on Thursday and it was to do with the old Black family tapestry that he’d kept on the wall after the renovations. Obviously he already knew that Malfoy was on it and after spending so much time thinking about him this week his eye was drawn to his face. The face was the familiar face of his youth however under it his name no longer read Draco Malfoy. Now it very plainly said Draco Black.
They all shared some wine and talked for a while. It was slightly stiff and awkward with Narcissa there and everyone was tired but the twins’ jovial attitude was helping to ease the tension and lighten the mood a lot.
“This is really good Harry, you’re a very good chef.” The way Draco said it was almost like Draco found his cooking sexy. Draco had been teasing him all day and although Harry was enjoying the dinner party part of him couldn’t wait until they had the house to themselves again.
“That’s true I suppose.” Harry agreed as he followed Fred out of his bedroom and back out to the lounge.
When Teddy reached him, he simply put his arms around Harry’s legs. Harry knelt down so he could give Teddy a proper cuddle. He was about to ask him what was wrong when he heard the familiar voice of Miss Violet, Teddy’s teacher for the day and felt a delicate female hand on his shoulder.
“OK so maybe he cares a little about me because we’re friends but how do I know if he wants more or not?” Draco asked, feeling a little insecure but reminding himself that this was Blaise and Daphne, they would always help him with no judgement.
Harry frowned. “I wasn’t that bad, it was mainly just Snape’s methods. I still got an E in my O.W.L.s and sixth year I was better than you anyway.” He said cheekily knowing he’d have to confess the reason why at some point today anyway if they were discussing that year in their education.
He didn’t like being feeble though, it wasn’t him. He was insecure a lot of the time, more so than people thought but he was still a Gryffindor for a reason, he always found courage from somewhere when he needed it and this was the time.
Harry laughed. “It’s great that you’re willing to give Blaise a chance, he’s genuinely a good guy but no, for the millionth time, we are just friends I mean it.”
Draco was torn. On the one hand he knew that Daphne was a very good judge of character and he trusted her opinions on things, she was never usually wrong. On the other hand she might have been at school but she was always in the background of things. She didn’t truly know what had gone on between the two of them over all those years of history. Potter had every reason to hate him, Draco thought to himself bitterly, and no one is that good of a person to just forgive and forget no matter what they might say.
Obviously he wasn’t thinking romantically, that was ridiculous, he just meant that being simple friends wasn’t quite enough for him. He could be friends and with Daphne and Blaise but Draco… he wanted to be special to Draco for some reason. He wanted to matter to him, to be an important part of his life. He had no idea why he wanted this, but then hadn’t he always had Draco’s attention? He always made it out like Draco antagonised him but then hadn’t he sometimes initiated their petty interactions at school? He could have just ignored Draco but he’d always wanted the man’s advances for some reason.
Potter didn’t volunteer any information about how he was spending the day and Draco didn’t ask. After breakfast they went their separate ways. His meeting with McGonagall went well. Really she just wanted to know how things were with him after the whole Smith incident and if anyone else was causing any trouble. He reassured her truthfully that things were going better than expected for him even if he left out some of the things he saw still hearing from other students in the corridors. No one else had openly confronted him yet so it was ok. He gave her the letter for his mother and she said she would send it on and then they just spoke about his classwork. The Headmistress seemed pleased with him so far and he found himself oddly satisfied that he’d met her approval.
*warning: nightmare scene here involving death. It's not graphic but just thought I'd warn for it just in case.
Blaise laughed as Draco tucked into his eclair and waited until he’d eaten it all (which didn’t take long) before looking at him slightly seriously again.
“Anyway, I spent most of seventh year just trying to stay hidden from anyone and everything and in my solitude I was reexamining everything I ever knew about myself. So yeah, the answer to your question is I finally admitted it to myself that year but even then I was too scared to actually do anything about it or tell anyone, not with Death Eaters in the castle.”
Then he moved Harry’s hand into his lap and caressed it with his other hand whilst he paused and took a deep breath. “The third scent I didn’t understand at the time. I thought it must be to do with flying but then I never loved it as much as you did. I only joined the Quidditch team to have more competition with you, and I’d even given it up that year, so I wasn’t sure why I would smell it as strongly as I did in the love potion. I suppose maybe all these years later it finally makes sense.”
“Well you are so damn sexy in your uniform, Auror Potter.” Draco replied with the twinkle back in his eye.
Blaise cleared this throat and stood up straighter looking at Draco. “I promise if you tell me now that you know that you have enough to get this place up and running as a business and that you can live comfortably here then I won’t bring up money again, but I mean comfortably not just getting by. This place needs to look good and you need to have a good quality of life. However, I also need you to promise that if you start struggling in any way, your life here, your health, your business, anything, then you will be sensible enough to come to me. If it helps you then think of it as a business arrangement, make an appointment with Harper, come to the office and we’ll do it all properly as an investment or a loan whichever you want and I’ll treat you like any other client.”
“Yeah it’s beautiful now.” Malfoy said fondly and when Harry was just about to question the use of the word ‘now’ he explained further. “When this place came on the market two years ago they snapped it up because of the location but it was a bit of a dump. They got it cheap though for that reason and did it up. I helped do most of the painting on my days off.”
Draco turned his head to look at Harry and there was a single tear rolling down his cheek. Harry reached up and wiped it away with his thumb and then leaned over to kiss the spot on Draco’s cheek.
“What fancy new bar?” He said in surprise, it wasn’t like Ron to know about these things. “I’m not going anywhere that isn't muggle.” He added.
“I will not let you do this Draco, you are my heir and you will obey me even if I have to force you to, everything you’ve done can still be undone.” Lucius looked menacing, he had a battle stance and his wand was pointed at Draco’s chest.
Draco was twitching slightly in his seat and looked a bit uncomfortable still. Harry was nervous too really, they both knew today was the day that Harry was going to tell Ron and Hermione and truthfully Harry didn’t know how it was going to go but he was doing his best to reassure himself as well as Draco.
Draco watched as Harry stood there and closed his eyes tightly. He brought his hands over his face too and just repeated those words to himself “I can’t lose you too. I can’t lose you too.” over and over again like a mantra. He was breathing deeply and slowly as he chanted and as he did so everything in the room slowly stopped shaking and things returned to normal.
Fred took the boxers that Harry had thrown and started getting dressed too. “Well I know how much he wants to look like you but I just feel like black is such a boring option! He’s not making the most of his abilities!”
“I am impressed so far. I hope you don’t mind a chef’s table but I’m afraid I don’t really like being in the public eye. I guarantee you that otherwise you would be on the front page of The Prophet tomorrow and they would probably be distasteful about that fact that you moved on from Malfoy quickly and you’re dating me now or something. I wouldn’t want that for you.” Harry said honestly and slightly awkwardly.
Daphne nodded. “Meet him as Pierre by all means but even if he does work out that it’s you I really don’t think he’ll care. I’m not sure why I know that but I just have a feeling.” She said with a twinkle in her eye.
“I just like watching you.” Harry said fondly. “You’re really beautiful you know.” He said as he reached over to trace a line down the side of Draco’s face. His skin was smooth but his jaw was sharp, it was a delicious contrast.
Harry seemed to be thinking along the same lines as there was an awkward moment of both of them just standing in the hallway.
Harry was taken aback by that opening and shutting his mouth a few times frowning at Malfoy. “You- You mean you.. You don’t know?” He stuttered out eventually.
After Harry left yesterday he’d broken down and cried in his room for hours like a pathetic baby and he hated himself for it afterwards. It was hardly the first time he’d cried in secret, he’d always been emotional but he’d been trained not to be and he could always hear his father’s voice in his head every single time, “Malfoy men don’t cry”.
“It’s complicated and I don’t want to get into it all to be honest.” Potter said looking down at his half eaten plate and twirling his fork whilst the others carried on eating.
Malfoy gave Harry a long hard look and didn’t reply immediately. Harry was half worried he’d see a look of pity there in those bluey-grey eyes but there was none. When Malfoy did finally speak his face settled into a soft understanding look that Harry didn’t recognise.
The other rather annoying thing was that Potter was fashing that stupid family crest ring, he was even wearing it on the right bloody finger. Draco thought to himself as he automatically rubbed the gap on his finger where his heir ring should be. Lucius still had the proper Malfoy family ring of course but here Potter was bragging that he was the head of his own old wizarding family. Potter probably had the bloody Black family ring too, surely it would be in the vault, Draco thought bitterly. It should be his, then at least he could be the head of one wizarding family even if he wasn’t going to pass it down to anyone.
She didn’t even look up from her magazine to see the gesture though. “Good morning Draco dear.” She said politely.
Draco shook his head in amusement. No matter how many hints he had dropped Harry still hadn’t got it. He’d been too embarrassed to admit it at first but now he found he wanted Harry to know.
“Draco, I’m sorry! It’s just automatic, hard habit to break but I’ll try harder. I’m sorry.” He said quickly.
“R-Riddle was going on about my cousin and Professor Lupin, calling her a blood traitor and him a werewolf... That kind of stuff, it wasn’t nice obviously and he brought me and my mother into it too. Everyone was taunting us, it just brought it back…” Draco went quiet again. “I can’t believe they had a son, and he’s my first cousin once removed or something… I, erm, I didn’t really think I had any other family left. It’s weird.”
“Oh honestly Blaise it wasn’t like that, it was only a kiss. George has been a perfect gentleman so far.” Daphne insisted but Draco saw the corners of her mouth turn upwards softly as she seemingly remembered the moment.
“Professor Dumbledore died at Hogwarts on the evening of the 30th June 1997. However there are some events of that night that are yet to be clarified. There were Death Eaters in the castle that night Mr. Malfoy. Could you please inform the court how it is that they came to be in the school grounds.” Kingsley asked, looking directly at Draco.
After breakfast Harry went to his study and did a couple of hours writing whilst Draco greeted Graham and the two of them went to brew in the basement. Harry asked Kreacher to pop in and ask Graham what he liked to drink whilst he made him and Draco their usual mid morning lattes. Turns out Graham is just a simple tea man so Harry put a teapot, milk, sugar and a mug on a tray and floated it down with a tray of cookies (also bought from Tesco this time) and a cinnamon latte for Draco.
“Of course.” Draco smiled back. “You don’t have to avoid alcohol completely if you don’t want to. It's just about not using it as a coping mechanism but enjoying the taste alongside food or having the odd social drink or two with friends is probably fine. Only you can judge that though.”
Annoyingly Harry did have a point again but Draco really didn’t want to get yet another person involved in this when they didn’t have to be. The twins had already known his identity for the best part of a year and had done nothing with the information. Also the fact that George and Daphne were sort of dating now, even if it was early stages, meant that Draco trusted him more and the man was further integrated into the group.
“Oh, I didn’t know you knew that about me.” He hadn’t really meant to say that but he found himself thinking out loud.
During the day Friday he visited Gringotts under his businessman disguise to withdraw money from the vault that was under his business name, the same name that the shop was registered in. He would need the money to give customers change after all. Friday evening was the night the three of them had decided on for their regular dinners but Draco didn’t really want to be seen in public again so soon with Daphne, it would rather defeat the point of their staged break up which had indeed been on the front cover of the Prophet that day. So they went back to Blaise’s posh penthouse flat in the heart of London’s financial district and ate the food he’d picked up from one of his favourite restaurants.
Harry and Ron exchanged a nod and a knowing smile before Harry followed the Head Auror out into the corridor and into the larger office next door. He sat down on one of the chairs by the large desk while his boss made two quick coffees in his small office corner kitchen and sat himself down the other side of the desk from Harry. Robards put a coffee in front of the empty chair next to Harry and started drinking the other.
Harry trailed his kisses up Draco’s neck and then over his sharp chiseled jaw slowly finding his way to Draco’s mouth. When their lips finally met it was with more passion and intensity than they had before. It was rough and slightly messy but in the best possible way. Their desperate need for each other was obvious and they both seemed to want more.
“It’s fine Harry.” Draco said much more confidently than he felt. He didn’t want this to be an issue, not here, not now. He lent over and kissed him to make sure Harry knew it was OK. “I missed you today.”
Draco sighed inwardly. He actually could understand that. He absolutely hated messing with the bookings and told all his staff never to swap guest rooms unless they absolutely had to. But maybe there was something he could do about Potter’s situation…
“Fuck Daphne.” He said quietly after she’d been quiet for a moment. “Why is it that everything I allow myself to feel safe and happy, Lucius does something to remind me that he’s still watching my every move and controlling my life.”
Sometimes he still felt slightly out of place at Weasley family dinners as he wasn’t technically family, despite how many times he’d sat round this very table now. He was the only one who wasn’t a Weasley since Hermione had married into the family. Sometimes he wished that he could marry Fred and then it would be officially his family too but he knew that wasn’t what either of them really wanted. Other times though like tonight he felt stupid for doubting it as this was the family he’d chosen. He loved every single one of them and he knew they loved him unconditionally too.
“Not at all.” Harry said stubbornly. It was the least he could do if he was the cause of Fred’s drunken state.
He felt the familiar sick feeling building up his stomach as a vision of himself on the back of a broom holding on to Potter for dear life came into his head with the fire swirling up all around them. He collapsed onto the ground shaking. Great, another bloody thing that he used to love was now ruined for him, he thought bitterly. This day really couldn’t get any worse.
Draco looked genuinely grateful. “Yeah that would be great actually, they don’t hang properly in here.”
.” He said, giving her a bit of a look as if they were sharing a private joke. “Just make me whatever, you know what I like..” He said dismissively and started to walk away towards the small raised decked area to find a seat.
For any Death in Paradise fans, I basically picture Draco's beach house as the one the chief British Detective guy has in that!
“Anyway,” Draco said, focusing back on the important thing but still with despair in his voice. “So what if Potter isn’t officially an auror anymore he still has connections at the Ministry, he always will. Weren’t you supposed to be explaining to me how exactly he knows who I am and why everything’s going to be ok?!”
He bought all his potions and product ingredients via owl from a wizarding company so maybe there was a food equivalent. Muggle shops were an option but he didn’t even know where they were or how to get to them and he didn’t even know how to use muggle money. He might have to start dressing as Pierre more and explore the wizarding shops, surely that would be safe.
Except Blaise was undoubtedly very attractive too and yet Harry had simply acknowledged that fact once and not given the man a second look. He’d felt nothing when Blaise walked so closely with him arm and arm earlier, yet when Draco had wrapped his invisible arm around him earlier as he stumbled from the cumbsy apparition landing he’d definitely felt something.
Featuring amongst other things the rest of the dinner party, a tipsy insecure and overthinking Draco, some smut, some romance, some domestic fluff, Harry and Draco talking about Sixth year and a brief trip to the Burrow for Harry.
He was falling in love with Draco, hard and fast. This was it, it had to be. This aching feeling in his chest where he felt like he could cry and dance all at the same time. This feeling in his lungs like he just wanted to breath all of Draco in like a drug and live on it for the rest of his life not needing any other sustenance.
Suddenly everything Draco had been feeling and thinking just disappeared. In that moment all he could see was Harry’s pain and nothing else mattered. He rushed forward quickly and was suddenly on the floor holding Harry in his arms. Harry was lip and unresponsive.
“Yes him and Blaise are having drinks in the sitting room.” Daphne said as they both stepped out into the foyer.
Once they were out into the fresh air and away from the crowds Draco lifted his head to look around him at what he thought might be his last ever look at the school that had been his second home for the last seven years. As they walked across the ground Draco spotted a figure standing by the lake not so far away. He recognised him immediately having watched him so closely for all those years, yet, on the other hand this model of him was like a stranger to Draco. Potter was looking down into the surface of the water, just standing there. What was he doing down here alone and why did he look so lost, Draco wondered. He looked again and realised, he not only looked lost but he seemed completely broken. Draco could almost recognise how he himself was feeling in that dejected stance and emotionless face. He didn’t think he’d ever seen that look on Potter though and it confused him. In that moment he could almost have… compassion for this man before him but it must just be the situation unsettling him.
“No.” Draco sighed and looked at the ceiling again. He never seemed to be able to look Harry in the eye when he was being vulnerable and confessing something. “I know it’s pathetic but I told you I was a selfish lover. I received without giving much and I didn’t really care what my previous partners thought of me. I didn’t like anything that felt too intimate, so… there’s a few things I don’t have… experience in.”
It was only a short kiss but it was one simple way of confirming to Harry that this was right and he was sure Draco felt it too. Coming home to find Draco and just effortlessly kissing him just felt natural. Harry pulled back even though he didn’t want to.When he did he found that Draco was still looking down at him slightly, given that he was a little bit taller than Harry, and he was smiling. His hands were still resting, lighting on Harry’s hips.
“No matter.” Draco said casually. “I was thinking some tea notes would mix well with the scents of books, grass and forest floor and make it slightly more feminine. She probably has green tea then or peppermint, maybe both... I’ll make it work.” He finished confidentiality smiling at the impressed look on Harry’s face before speaking again.
“Graham… something or other, begins with ‘P’ I’m pretty sure.” Harry said scratching his head as if trying to remember. “He was a Slytherin so you might know him, three years below us.”
Once Daphne had left Draco warded the back door too and checked all his security measures. He looked over the diary again and made himself a to-do list on his desk. He frowned a little when he realised that Potter’s notes were definitely lacking. All he knew was that he wanted a bespoke gift basket for a friend but he guessed he’d just have to find out the details from him in the morning. There was a note to say that he would most likely be arriving just before the shop opened to avoid the public and would prefer to leave through the back of the shop afterwards.
“Of course.” Miss Violet said but she wasn’t put off. “We have set a homework assignment which might be a bit challenging for Teddy. I wanted to make sure I talked it over with you properly as I know how invested you are in Teddy’s education. Perhaps you’d like to meet me tonight and I can go over it with you?”
Once the burns ointment had been applied to the skin liberally he bandaged Draco’s hands in murtlap soaked bandages and then placed a dressing on Draco’s neck too. “They should be fine by tomorrow, the numbing charm will wear off in a few minutes. I guess I don’t need to tell you about pain potions, presumably if you want one you’ve got them.” He said casually.
“I assumed the house was just abandoned now. Knowing the Black family there will definitely be protections on it to stop it falling into the hands of someone who isn’t the Black heir and I’m not no matter what my name is so I didn’t even try. I don’t even know where it is but I never thought about what happened to the house elf but if he really is Potter’s then Black must have named Potter as his heir in his will. If he filled out all the paperwork the goblins and the Ministry would have accepted it. A male that is named as heir will always take precedence, everything would have shifted the moment Black signed his name in blood on the paperwork. Now Potter’s children will be heir to the Potter and the Black families unless he actively names someone else, but why would he?!” Draco had been calm when he explained it but as his own words sunk in he felt himself getting angry once more.
“Er, désolé Monsieur, but ze breakfasts of champagne are part of ze package platinum zat you booked. Zey are non-refundable.” Came another familiar voice of Tibault who Draco knew was on shift this morning as he was in charge of the rotas.
What about now? What were Draco’s parents like now? Draco had spoken using the past tense, Harry thought that this had all been his childhood, all pre-war, surely the horrors of the war were enough to shake Lucius from his old ways, and Narcissa too. They hadn’t fought in the battle, Harry thought that had been an act of redemption. Surely the man didn’t still treat Draco in this way…? But then why had Draco left…? Why was he no longer a Malfoy…?
This was ridiculous, Harry shouldn’t be worried. Draco had his own life and a business to run, he didn’t have to come straight back here as soon as his shop was shut. He was probably just finishing for the day, getting things in order, maybe talking to Daphne. Yes, that was it, they were probably just in the back talking together, afterall Harry didn’t know exactly what time Daphne usually went home and Draco called it a day and it wasn’t like they’d agreed a time he had to be home by. If something bad had happened his band would be glowing hot around his ankle and it definitely wasn’t. Everything was fine, he told himself.
Fred spoke up again. “Harry, you know we don’t ever judge you, you’ve been through a hell of a lot and if anyone deserves to drown their sorrows in whiskey it’s you…”
Fred and George were both rolling their eyes. “Oh mum will definitely throw a party!” They said together.
His mother had stepped up first conjuring an elegant floral wreath of rare dark roses symbolising thankfulness to the deceased without a word. Then she had turned back, placed a hand on Draco’s shoulder briefly and walked to where the aurors stood to wait for him. That left Draco alone near the grave for a few moments to say goodbye. It was strange. He didn’t really
George shrugged. “Well I really don’t know anything about her but if you like her then she must be alright and I can’t really afford to be fussy. I just thought she was a bit out of my league really.”
“Of course that should continue Harry, that’s very generous and fair.” Draco said quietly, still too stunned to process what this meant for him.
I actually wasn't going to have them be officially together so soon but I just couldn't wait I want them to be together!
Blaise continued as Draco turned round to look at him. “Whilst I agree that you should never wear a completely white top the cardigan prevents that too. From the back and the sides there is no white at all, the white is only on the front and it does indeed remind people of your skin tone but that is a good thing in certain situations.” He said grinning.
“Good morning to you.” He said cheerfully. “Sorry I was late, rather a lot going on at home at the moment.”
“Well, I enjoyed my first week off relaxing for the first time in ages and spending time with everyone but I’ve definitely made up my mind about the book so thought I may as well get started on it.” Harry answered him, still taking little sips of his coffee.
Harry was laughing along with both of them immediately feeling happier and back at home here even though he was worried that this might be the last time he was welcome.
She had obviously told her husband to apologise and had been listening to the conversation, but Harry didn’t mind, he had expected it really.
He’d written this part but he couldn’t be bothered to go and get his notes upstairs. Draco could read them later properly but for now he was more in the mood to actually talk to Draco and tell him about this for them, not just for the sake of writing the book.
“Sorry for what?” Harry asked, sighing slightly but really pleased to finally be alone with Draco in their room. “Sorry that your Mother hates me?”
“Yeah, honestly we don’t really know anything about him. Reckon something happened but like we said, he’s very private and we really just want to focus on the products so we don’t ask.” Fred explained.
He always loved looking at Harry when he slept, he looked so peaceful and happy. He sat down on the floor leaning against the chaise longue Harry was on and started to read over the contract from the Ministry.
Blaise had an effortless but honest charm about him that always made him say whatever he thought and get away with it. He was excellent in all social situations and always knew how to get information out of people. That was why he was so successful at talking people into bed with him and talking others into making investments.
With Lucius likely desperate for any information on how to get to Draco it was too risky to tell anyone who didn’t already know anything anyway. So yes, so many reasons not to tell them, some  one which were outside of his control, yet he still felt guilty. So guilty for keeping something this big from then that he decided on a whim to give them something small and hopefully he wouldn’t regret it.
Harry blinked several times and seemed to wake himself up more before coming to kneel next to the fire.
Harry knew he was right really. He’d seen Draco cry and he’d still attacked him even if Draco had attacked first... their relationship then had been too messed up, too bitter, too hateful. He wasn’t sure what he would have done exactly if he’d known about Draco’s situation but there was no use in wondering. Instead he amused Draco by telling him about asking Dobby and Kreacher to tail him and how Kreacher had been back then.
. Draco had sort of… become friends with him. Even though the friendship wasn’t going to last any further than the nine days Harry had left on the island Draco felt some sort of weird responsibility to make sure he had a good time while he was here. Making sure Harry had a great holiday
“Are you two done talking about me like I’m not here?!” Draco said walking over to the table where Blaise was now taking a seat.
Draco’s voice was quiet and sad. “Yeah. I’m a right bastard aren’t I? I honestly do think he was just trying to be nice… I’m such an idiot Blaise. I have Harry bloody Potter, a man that I fancy more than I’ve ever fancied anyone in my life, coming round to check on me because he was worried, bringing me wine and then trying to surprise me by cooking me dinner and I drive him away with my stupid defensive anger. I mean seriously? How many people in this country would kill to be in my position? I bet they wouldn’t tell him to fuck off.”
It was Draco’s turn to nod now but he didn’t speak. His throat was still dry and his head felt foggy, he was working hard to keep it clear. Harry reached up to kiss him and then stepped back pulling the thin material off the back of Draco’s chair and throwing it over himself disappearing into his surroundings.
“If you say so Harry but just because I’m straight doesn’t mean I can’t tell that he’s pretty good looking!” George laughed.
Draco followed him thinking that Harry would probably be down any minute but he was confused at what Kreacher said. He knew Harry said he didn’t spend much time here for a few years after the war but where had he been staying up until a month ago and why the change? That was strange.
“Yeah it’s fine, I didn’t have that much and it was hours ago now. I’m all good I swear.” Harry said honestly.
Harry had confessed to Draco that talking to Hedwig when he was shut away in his bedroom during the summers at Privet Drive had been the only thing that kept him sane half the time. He hoped that at least Draco would realise he wasn’t the only one, it was yet another thing that brought them together despite the differences they’d had in their childhood too. Harry loved Gandalf, he really did. Partly because he was a beautiful owl with a very nice temperament, but mostly because he had been a gift from Draco. However, when he saw the way that Draco looked at the owl he’d had since childhood it did make him miss Hedwig.
He sighed again and put down his fork. The beef was really nice, his favourite thing of the night so far but he wasn’t used to this many courses and he already felt full.
Ron half shrugged and nodded again but he didn’t say anything, he just sat drinking his drink. He did look slightly dejected though.
“Yeh I know, weird one right?!” He chuckled and then turned slightly more serious. “She also is weirdly obsessed with books, loves that old book smell you know?”
“The jeans on your legs helped, the glass didn’t really get through them I guess or there were only small shards but your knees looked like you’d knelt in the glass first. Your top though was pretty thin and the big glass just cut straight through it. You must have been quite unlucky to just collapse right onto the big bits… I dunno. We binned the top, not really worth repairing to be honest. The biggest shard was impaled in your right hand, it went all the way through, pretty nasty.” George explained when he saw Harry looking.
Also, some more good news, one of the reasons I took so long getting this chapter out is I was really taking the time to map out the rest of the story and most of the ending is actually written now too so I can confirm it will definitely be finished and hopefully it won't take me as long to get those chapters out. The next few still need to be written though and I am due to move house in two weeks so please carry on being patient with me! I'll get there!
He had received a few other practical gifts from him and his mother for the upcoming school year which he had graciously accepted. True, they weren’t amazing gifts but they had hardly been able to go out shopping and they would undoubtedly be useful for N.E.T.W.S which he was determined to do well at. The best present had come after Leo had left them and he was currently staring at it against his pale skin with his mother’s words still going round in his head.
“Well I’m sorry moved myself in and robbed you of that opportunity.” Draco said sarcastically but his smile wasn’t hiding how happy he was.
“Well I can’t take any chances now can I after the last time Harry decided he needed a lunchtime shag, saw way more than I wanted to that day.”
“Well…” Harry said slowly. “The twins have a new shop assistant that they hired on a temporary basis when Fred was off. They don’t really have enough work for him now but I get the impression his personal life isn’t that great. George said he needs the salary so they feel like they should continue to employ him full time but really they struggle to fill his hours, I was thinking he might be able to help you out too, work between the two shops. Like maybe if you’re here on a Friday doing owl orders, he can work alongside Daphne so she’s not alone, restocking and stuff…”
Then Harry did take his glass and quickly downed the rest of his first drink. Ron was still chuckling to himself oblivious. When Harry sat the empty glass down on the table he turned to Ron and looked at him as serious as he could.
“Yeah, guess so.” Draco replied then he paused for a moment and continued. “I’m so sorry Harry, you were telling me about your awful past and yet you had to comfort me… I should have been comforting you. I just didn’t know how… I- I…” Draco swallowed again and still looked like he was fighting back tears.
“I like spoiling you.” Harry said back smiling and leaning in for another kiss, this time he lingered slightly.
“More or less.” Harry said. “I was going to set up an alarm system we use in aurors when we’re monitoring or scouting areas. It’s a subtle one that won’t alert anyone else around or the person who is trying to break it or whatever, that way we can get the element of surprise. Basically there’s a band that you can wear on your wrist or ankle and it will glow hot when the area under surveillance is triggered by something unusual but no one but you would notice it. You can charm the band to be triggered by a person if you speak their name into it when it’s set up and it also acts as a sort of sneakoscope. In addition to it being automatically triggered you can press it too if you notice something and all the others in that group will glow hot so it’s a good way for us all to communicate with each other if we need help. Say if Narcissa or Lucius turn up at the shop again, during work hours Daphne can subtly press her band under the counter and we can all be there in no time or if Graham hears something odd at night he can press his.”
“That’s good.” Harry said smiling. “He was just going through a bit of a tough time at the beginning of the month but you make George happy so he’ll love you for that so you have nothing to worry about.”
was blaring out of the open french doors. Charlie and the Chocolate factory, a classic. He wondered why Harry had chosen that film in particular though.
Harry was quiet for a moment as he looked at Draco clearly thinking over his words. After a short while he spoke softly again. “You really think that?”
“It was good.” Harry said with a smile. “You were right and erm, well I’m still a bit nervous about it but I’m definitely single now and we’ll see what happens.” He said elaborating slightly.
She didn’t show any sign of surprise, her face was just showing a mild curiosity.  “I believe you made that clear in your invitation Harry, should I be offended that you’re so certain you don’t want to date me that you have to bring it up again?”
It was around 4 o’clock in the afternoon when Harry and the twins both received notes from Ron telling them to come to the Burrow for dinner tonight as he had an announcement to make. Harry’s letter also said that Ron had heard his news about quitting and wanted to talk to him.
Gandalf had been sitting on Harry’s shoulder during all this and supervising his work. He seemed to have become quite attached to Harry already and Harry was fond of him too, he seemed to have a nice temperament. Harry settled him back into the largest cage but left the door open as he had with all the others. The window was closed for now but Harry told them all he’d come and let them out later that evening but they couldn’t hunt too much today as Draco would need them to be well rested for his deliveries tomorrow.
Here, Harry and Draco are both secure in their sexuality and they both know what they want deep down even though they can be a little confused sometimes. Their relationship has always been passionate and intense so I wanted to keep those emotions at the height of it all and it makes sense for me that they would almost have a sort of whirlwind romance... anyway I'll shut up now before I say too much! (Probably too late!)
Yet in that moment there was some small part of him that wanted to finally push his father’s wishes out of his head. He was exhausted, too tired to think, too tired to put on his mask. He wanted to break down and tell the man looking at him that he had never really had a choice, in any of this. That he had been forced to take the mark. That he had been threatened over and over again and pulled in every direction until he no longer knew his own mind, own wishes, own feelings. Then, just as he opened his mouth to speak, still unsure of what exactly he would say, he felt his father's eyes upon him too and his years of Malfoy upbringing came back to the forefront of his mind. He snapped his mouth shut and simply bowed his head to the Minister in the manner that he knew was expected of him.
“Well you were right to have your suspicions about me that year weren’t you?” Draco said bitterly after Harry’s earlier confession of seeing what he’d gotten up to in Diagon Alley before school had even started.
“Yes I thought so too.” She said quietly. “I gather Lucius is not a nice man and I expect he is quite controlling.”
It was still quite early but it was apparent now that neither man would be going back to sleep. Harry got up and slipped his checked flannel pajama bottoms on and wandered to the kitchen. He made a strong coffee for himself the muggle way with freshly ground beans as he usually did when he had the time, he was a bit of a coffee snob and this just tasted so much better. He’d bought a proper coffee machine for Fred and George’s like the one he had at Grimmauld Place but really it was mostly for himself. He brewed a tea for Fred the muggle way too and added milk to it the way he liked it and took the drinks back to bed. He doubted George would be up yet, that man slept through anything.
He noticed that Harry took a while to respond and wish he could properly see his face. “Erm, yeah guess so, sometimes, would be nice one day.” Harry replied.
“Well you didn’t sleep last night it’s understandable.” Draco said gently. “And I know how much you hate paperwork so it’s not surprising that it put you to sleep.”
“Boot and Rogers you’re coming with us to Harry’s. One of you take Mr. Zabini, the other Miss Greengrass. Collect any evidence you can, you know what to ask and Harry reckons they’ll be cooperative. If all parties agree then collect memories too so grab the vials and relevant forms for those before we leave. Harry and I will take Mr Black and Ms Black.” Ron outlined the rest of the plan and there were nods all round.
Weirdly Fred never came to Grimmauld even though it was bigger and Harry had a TV. Harry didn’t particularly like being there alone but he was a very private person and he didn’t really like having people over anyway, even Fred. It was strange and he knew it didn’t make any sense but it was just how he felt. Fred never questioned it, he had never once invited himself over or asked Harry why he’d never been invited, they had just settled in to Harry going to Fred’s. George seemed to like having company too and they could easily get the privacy they needed with silencing charms even though Fred and George didn’t seem to care much about privacy! Harry did though.
“Harry, this is your home, come back whenever you like.” Draco said in an amused way. “Besides I’m sure Daphne would like to see you too and Blaise of course, they’re just as much your friends as mine now.”
When he got back Harry didn’t seem to be home and Kreacher confirmed that he had gone out. Obviously he knew Harry had his own life and could go as he pleased but so far he’d always told Draco when he was going out so it was a bit strange and Draco couldn’t help but worry and wonder. He put it to the back of his mind though and went down to make some products. There was one new thing in particular that he wanted to try.
Daphne went out the back door first and then Draco followed. He wasn’t overly cautious as he was dressed as Pierre but this was just habit and the front of the shop was already closed and locked up for the night so this was easier. Draco put all the usual security locks and spells on the place before they left and then turned to walk to the post office.
“But seriously,” Draco continued. “I have a whole new level of respect for them now. They really did a lot for you and the wizarding world in general really. I know they will probably still hate me and I won’t blame them but I- I hope they can still stand by you in this too, with us.”
Never in one day had he had such a roller coaster of emotions and it was the first time in years that he’d properly allowed himself to reflect on the past. Draco had freely admitted that his persona at school had basically been a complete lie and his home life was nowhere near what he’d portrayed it to be. He’d never admitted that to anyone before and he actually felt right that the person to confess to had been the person he’d antagonised the most during that time. Blaise and Daphne knew little bits of course but it had mostly been small pieces of the puzzle that they’d put together over years of knowing him and little bits of information he had given. Yet in three hours he had told Harry more than even his best friends knew. It had surprised him that he revealed that much, he hadn't expected to but he found that he wasn’t worrying about it now, he didn’t regret it.
“Other than that though, I wanted to be exactly like my father, it was what I was brought up to be and the only thing I knew. I wanted to be the aristocratic business man, heir to the Malfoy fortune and everything that went with it which I guess is why I repressed my sexuality. I knew I would be married off to some beautiful respectable pure-blood witch and we would have to produce an heir and I thought that’s what I wanted or I was trying to convince myself I suppose.”
If any of you super talented people free the desire to draw some fan art inspired by my stories then do let me know, I'd love to see it! I am useless at drawing :(
“For years I told myself that I didn’t want to know so it didn’t matter and then when I met you again and we talked about doing the book I thought it would be healthy to slowly unravel everything again and make sense of it all piece by piece. I had imagined there would be memories that I had repressed but I never knew I had the answers in my head all along. I never realised how much I’d witnessed but shoved aside in a mental box somewhere to be forgotten. How could I not remember a massive whole interaction like that?” He questioned as if it scared him.
That startled Draco, he hadn’t meant to show his annoyance he thought he’d been discreet. When had Harry learnt to read him so well?
“OK. OK” Blaise repeatedly slowly as he soothed Draco running his hand firmly up and down his back. “That’s OK, Draco, I can help you, we can get you some food and you can rest, it's OK…. Let’s go upstairs.”
“Merlin, Zabini, it was just that one time. Let it go.” Harry snorted, shaking his head. Under his breath he muttered “I’m going to kill George.”
… I don’t think I was ready before but you’ve helped me see Harry. What I witnessed on its own didn't make sense to me but after all these weeks with you, all these conversations… I get it now and I think this was the best way for me to understand. You started from the beginning, we both did, telling each other things from our childhood and it was all leading up to this. Our separate paths were intertwined in some ways our whole lives and you’re right, in some weird twisted way of fate I was important. What I did was important… and- and for the right side too.”
There was another pause in the conversation where Harry and Draco just relaxed into the sofa. Draco seemed content now and he was looking around his surroundings a bit more.
The first part could still be changed if anyone has any amazing ideas?! Or I can use them for their second date maybe!
The confession had been liberating and for the first time in his life he wanted to tell someone everything and just completely let it all out. He ever thought that person would be Harry Potter but life had a way of surprising you sometimes. Harry had reacted perfectly to everything, he wasn’t as dramatic about things as Blaise could be and he didn’t mother him like Daphne tended to. He had just been there patiently listening, ready to jump in when needed. Draco knew that Harry wasn’t as eloquent with his words as he was so it actually made sense to him that the man’s gut reaction was to offer physical comfort.
“Yeah I guess so.” Harry said in a slightly exasperated way. “I still don’t really understand why he had to make things so difficult and didn’t tell me more while he was alive but in his own way I suppose he did know what he was doing. There was this symbol that kept coming up on our adventures, it was in the book, it was on a grave in Godric’s Hollow and we’d also seen it around Xenophilius Lovegood’s neck at Bill and Fleur’s wedding.”
“I wasn’t that bad.” Harry muttered. Draco smiled at him again and Harry spoke up a bit more seriously after a second to process this information. “That must have been hard for you though, to deal with that with Lucius and everything else.”
“Yes, but it’s fine, I’ll still see them… around.” He trailed off as he seemed to be thinking when he would see them properly again. “I know you're quite private about your home Harry and you said you never had people over before… I wouldn’t want to do anything you were uncomfortable with.”
“Your shoulders feel less tense today. Did you enjoy your massage last night?” Harry asked whilst rubbing Draco’s slender shoulders during their morning shower together. They usually did this when Draco was working from home and had a bit more time.
“You only answered one of my questions.” Harry pointed out as they’d both taken another long slurp from their straws. “I want the whole story of how you came to be here.”
Draco opened the door and Blaise stepped in. Before Draco even knew why he just crumbled into Blaise’s arms.
Draco sat up too as they both rested their backs against the headboard, legs stretched out in front of them under the covers still.
“But my favourite has always been Italian food. Some of the best memories I have are of my childhood holidays in Italy. We have a villa there with our own vineyard, it’s so beautiful, all the colours… and the air. It’s not like the Manor. My father was...
“Ok.” Harry said slowly. “Well… I need you to know that he’s still always going to be a part of my life, he’s one of my best friends and I can’t lose him so if that’s going to be a problem for you then I guess we need to talk about that and work out a way to deal with it as I can’t lose you either.”
Ron got back from work around five and Rose was just getting up from her afternoon nap then. Harry went to get her whilst Hermione greeted her husband and then they all had drinks in the lounge together. Ron made an early start on the beer grabbing one for Harry too and he seemed in very high spirits about their impending night out together. Harry thanked him again for handling the case so well and they both said they were pleased at how well it had got wrapped up in the end.
“Yes and Yes.” Draco said flatly, not looking up. “We established this yesterday Potter, do keep up.”
Harry swallowed thickly but didn’t say anything. Draco laughed again feeling very much on top of the world. He withdrew his face but stayed close next to Harry on the sofa not allowing them to lose contact completely.
Sorry to those who don't like long chapters but that seems to be the type of writer I am and I have had people saying long chapters are good so... I just can't help myself!
There was no doubt that Harry Potter was powerful but he was also damaged. Draco could see that now. The carefree Potter that had been holding casual conversation was gone now and Draco was beginning to think that he didn’t really exist, not deep down. He was an act. The real man truly was one wild sea of emotions that he was constantly fighting to control. Hadn't that always been the case? Hadn’t Draco himself always been able to tease Potter’s anger to surface when just moments before the school boy had been happily laughing with his friends. The man was clearly no different in some ways, yet in others he had changed a lot. Harry Potter was truly fascinating and Draco was now beginning to think he would very much like to see more of him.
“Well a couple of owls would hardly be able to take twenty parcels in one day would they?” Draco answered back. “I’d need to buy at least five I think which would be expensive, and then I’d have to prepare and coordinate different deliveries on different days so they could take at least one a day, plus all the cages and the treats, also where would I even keep them?”
“Well you were always the creative one with names at school, I’m sure you’ll think of one.” He said rolling his eyes. Then he turned slightly more serious. “So what do you think about the room? Is it too coupley?”
“Nothing better to do.” Draco shrugged and he became aware that his tone was slightly bitter. Merlin, why had he just admitted to Potter that part of him would rather be working than sit at home alone. That was just great.
“Thursday?!” Draco said in alarm, sitting up sharply in bed. “So I was asleep for…” he trailed off in disbelief.
“Yes so am I actually.” Draco said honestly. “I did have a moment last week where I thought someone might have been watching us go and it made me a bit uneasy and this will be cheaper in the long run so thank you. These aren’t your present though.”
“I know and he knows that too. He’s a selfish idiot sometimes but he’d never truly get in the way of my happiness not when it came down to it. He’s just feeling a bit insecure at the moment. I think he just didn’t want anything to change but now it might do. He was happy with you and now he feels like you’re going off to find someone and then I will too and he’ll be alone...” George said quietly. “Not that anything has happened yet obviously, I haven’t even met Daphne! I guess it was maybe just a bit tackless of me to mention it.”
Harry thought for a moment before he sat up slowly against the bedhead and looked down at his lover. “Draco you do realise that you can never be just like anyone else to me. You don’t need to worry about that… about competing or anything.”
“Ok, well, erm great.” Harry stammered. “I’ll be downstairs then in the kitchen then making dinner and then we can talk, but er, just take your time and erm, there are fresh towels in the bathroom, just use any and make yourself at home.”
“You really never even looked in here?” Blaise asked sceptically as Kreacher started pouring the wine and then set out serving the starter.
Fred met Harry’s soft gaze for a moment before elaborating. “It was only ever a matter of time…” Fred trailed off but then gathered himself.
After a while Fred had ended up telling Bill and Charlie too with Harry’s permission as he was pretty close to them and they’d already half worked it out. Bill had been a bit worried about someone being hurt too but he hadn’t gone on about it once they’d assured him that wasn’t the case. Charlie had a very similar reaction to George, so it was nice to be able to relax a bit around him too. Some others of their friends like Lee and Neville had figured out that Fred and Harry were sort of ‘friends with benefits’ during the occasional pub nights that still happened but most people just thought Harry was happily single and Fred liked playing the field.
“I’m really serious about my privacy and this is a case OK? So you’re bound by confidentiality not to disclose any details on my home to anyone ever, even when this case is done. If you do there will be consequences for your future employment here at the ministry.” He said in a serious and slightly scary tone. They both nodded seriously. When he spoke again he softened his voice significantly. “But as it happens I do trust you to be professional. I’ll side you along Auror Rogers and Ron can take you Auror Boot that way you’ll be able to come inside but not repeat the address to anyone anyway.”
It was Monday morning and Harry was sitting at his desk in the Ministry sorting through all the messages and the case files that he missed on his week off but his heart really wasn’t in it. He’d like to say that his week off was a lovely much needed holiday but it wasn’t like that at all. It had been more like a forced week of leave to get him out of the way after a rather unfortunate incident with a member of the public. Him and Ron had been on a fairly standard scouting patrol after a report from a witch who lived in a small wizard village. Harry had the familiar sense that someone was watching them and his gut was telling him that something wasn’t right. Suddenly there had been movement behind them and he’d distinctly heard someone start a spell beginning with ‘A’.
Draco’s voice had dipped a bit in the middle and Harry could tell that he was cracking but by the end he sounded just as angry as he had done before. Harry was half worried that he might start hexing him if he didn’t leave. Maybe he should leave… but how could he just leave Draco here now knowing the conditions he lived in.
Harry considered for a moment and then said with a serious looking face. “Please give your fiancé my best regards.” He said with a polite bow of the head.
Just as they’d arrived early to avoid the main crowds, they stayed in the box for a while chatting and reliving the best moments of the game letting the rest of the stands empty before they made their move. As such their walk back from the box to the grounds with Draco under the cloak again was easy and no one bothered them. Harry didn’t need to take Draco back to Daphne’s as he could picture his destination clearly this time so could apparate himself under the cloak. He was a little disappointed not to have the excuse to touch Draco again but he pushed the thought to the back of his mind.
“In that case I’m going to invite him over to the estate Saturday night. You’re invited too of course, and Blaise I think. We’ll cancel Friday so you can have some time to yourself and do this dinner on Saturday instead with Harry. You’ll do better if you don’t have work to think about the next day.” Daphne was clearly formulating this plan on the spot out loud.
“Erm, well nothing specifically other than they know about Draco and they’ve been helping out a bit.” Harry said, not sure how much to reveal about Draco’s business.
He stayed until Fleur came to pick Victorine up and asked very politely if he could come back to Shell Cottage and talk to her as well as Bill when he came home. She had been surprised but agreed very enthusiastically and told Harry that he simply must stay for dinner. Harry agreed because he knew how good Fleur’s cooking was now.
“But how could you…?” She started again looking at him as Draco sunk back into the chair by his desk.
“Oh right, yes, ok then Harry.” Hermione said quietly. “Will you tell us though, you know, erm, how the dating goes?”
