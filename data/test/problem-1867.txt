“Whoever it is, make them go away.” Draco says, voice tinged with exhaustion. Harry knows he looks forward to his one day of rest each week. The therapies really are grueling work. He is already coming up with excuses in his mind on how to get their unwelcome guest to leave when he opens the door and a surprised gasp escapes his mouth.
"I won't be able to live with myself if I don't avenge him. I should have stopped it in the first place and I didn't." Harry says honestly. The guilt he feels is bone deep, drenched within every aspect of his being. There are things he can't say to his wife. Things that make the burning pain even brighter, more palpable.
"Draco, please, I love you. You have to trust me on this-" he tries to draw nearer but I fumble away from him.
I took a few liberties regarding the Wizarding World for the sake of the plot. Please, just go with it ;)
Harry sits anxiously at his desk, staring at his hands. Today in particular is one of the slowest days Harry has ever encountered. He waits with bated breath for his lunch time, as that will be the moment he finally takes down Draco's killer. He is 100% sure he has pinpointed the dark Wizard's location and there is a thrill coursing its way through his veins. Thinking of Draco is difficult though. It hurts with a raw, unhinged type of pain Harry has never experienced before. It makes this moment bittersweet.
But Potter knows we are coming. We are ambushed by about five light-bringers. I recognize Ron Weasley, Dean Thomas, and Seamus Finnegan right off the bat, but can't really catch a good view of the other two. One is most certainly a female, the other male. I'm fighting only to survive, taking care not to hurt anyone too badly. My fellow team mates fall into step behind me as I try to lead them in the opposite direction of where I know the camp to be. I figure the best way for me to survive is if we don't find Potter and his camp. But the other side is too fast, they descend upon us quickly.
“Draco,” he says quietly. They are sitting at the table enjoying tea and scones together, and Draco looks up from his book in question.  Harry steels himself, vowing to be straightforward with the other man, telling himself that this is the second chance he will not squander, and says, “I want to sleep with you.” Draco nearly chokes on the scone he has just taken a bite from, and he takes a moment to chew thoughtfully before swallowing quietly and raising his eyes to Harry’s.
“Harry, we haven’t spoken in days and now suddenly you’ve cooked my favorite meal? I can’t remember the last time you cooked for me, so I’ll ask again, what’s going on?” She looks at him expectantly, her manicured fingers tapping on the table, a clear sign that she’s peeved.
He's not disappointed, the toast is lovely. They sit together for a while, the only sounds being the crunching of toast and sipping of coffee. Draco is lost in thought, wondering how exactly to proceed from here. Does he just sort of awkwardly watch Potter for the rest of his 24 hours? He knows the Gryffindor won't last that long without experiencing some kind of withdrawal at least. And how to convince him he needs more help once it's all brought to light? Unless he's wrong, which is certainly within the realm of possibilities. He questions himself again, wonders why he is even doing this, becomes hopeful that maybe he is wrong. Maybe he caught Potter on a bad night, nothing more. But he knows the signs, is adept at recognizing them. He's done this for so long that he is fairly confident in his ability to notice things, even the smallest things others may not notice. For instance, the strained way that Potter is biting at his toast, the way he is looking around restlessly, the small droplets of sweat at his temples. The clammy git is already going through it and it's only morning. He must have it bad.
“That’s a great idea,” the Mediwitch agrees, “he’s had a calming draught and it should last a few hours. But Mr. Potter? Please get him back here in one piece. And if anything happens, promise me you will bring him back immediately.”
"You want me to spend 24 hours here?!" It sounds almost too loud in the room, the echoes causing Harry's head to throb again.
“Potter, you know how much I loved those pajamas!” He sounds as though he is only half-way joking.
"Because he did, and that's all that matters."
"It's okay, Draco." he tells me.
“I’ll gather up your discharge paperwork, happy to see you’re awake and thriving.” She says, turning from both men and making her way out of the room. Draco releases a breath as Harry wraps him into a warm embrace. He breathes him in, somehow marveling at the fact that the man can still smell like a hint of sandalwood underneath the sterile smell of cleaning charms.
“Afternoon, Mr. Porter!” The young cashier smiles at him, tossing her light brown hair behind her shoulder.
The holding cell in Azkaban is dark and damp, with a sort of chill that seeps through my skin and wraps itself around my organs. It is barren save for a tiny, wooden cot that sits in a corner somewhere behind me. I sit on the ground with my knees up, arms wrapped around them in an effort to keep warm. In the back of my mind, I can hear father's voice chastising me for sitting in such a vulnerable position. For showing weakness. But unfortunately, I have no fucks left to give.
“Henry,” the man says, “you’re like clockwork my man. Same as usual?” Harry nods, returning the smile. He pulls American muggle money from his own pocket. Lost amongst the crowd and shadow, an exchange is made. Harry takes the pill and swallows it down in one fluid motion, allowing the bitter taste to wash over his tongue and throat.
“Okay,” Harry agrees, “but if you need to stop, just let me know.”
They lock eyes momentarily before springing into action. They had been planning their course of action for so long that both men know exactly what they need to do. Lunch time was just beginning, which gave them one hour before anyone would notice they were gone. They were not exactly authorized for their mission, but they each still did have permission to work on the case. They would just need to tell the story of how the wizard was apprehended a little differently from the truth.
“Sounds perfect, Potter.” He finally says, seeming to soften up a bit. Harry feels his shoulders sagging in relief. They do the rest of their shopping mainly in silence, and Harry does his best to ignore the building pain and tension in his body. He feels like a rubber band, stretched so taught he might snap at any minute. And his vision is slightly blurring at the edges. No, he doesn’t feel well at all. The fifteen or so minutes that it takes them to gather up all the ingredients for their two meals, plus some eggs and more bread for breakfast in the morning are grueling, and Harry is glad when they finally make their way to the cash register to pay for their food.
Draco has been in some sort of fight. The dining room table is flipped on its side, one chair completely in pieces, another on its side, and the third one oddly missing. A few paintings are crooked where they hang on the walls, and some framed photographs lay broken on the ground. The kitchen itself is a horrible mess of broken glass and crockery. The tea kettle lays shattered next to the table, two mugs flipped over with what appears to be tea soaking into the cream carpet. Harry blinks against the looming memory of blood, so much blood soaking into pavement below his feet. He takes a closer look at Draco, who’s got a fresh cut on his cheek, and thinks better of reaching out to sooth the wound.
He surprises me when he grabs me by my shoulders and pulls me up into his arms. We lay in a tangle of sweat and heat as the clouds finally give way to raining down on us. He laughs, the sound of it bringing a smile out of me.
"The ministry....made things difficult." He finishes blandly. There is a stretch of tense silence that lasts several moments before his wife tries again.
"My head is killing me....but otherwise fine." He says. I stare awkwardly at him for a second.
“Well, I didn’t know for sure, Ronald, so it’s not something that I could just spit ball as a thought without you freaking the fuck right out, don’t you think?” She spits back, exasperated.
Harry stares at the letter in his hands. His vision blurs through his tears as he sniffs unceremoniously. The letter arrived about two weeks ago, and Harry has not received another since, nor has he responded. It’s a bit crumpled at the edges, and Harry does his best to smooth it out tenderly. His hands are shaky. He sits at a small table for one in an efficiency somewhere in Muggle America. He really hasn’t gone too far off the grid, has he? He’s just made sure to lose his wand (it’s safe and sound in Grimmauld Place) and change his appearance a bit. He has dyed his hair with muggle hair dye, to a slightly less dark brown color, and he wears contacts instead of glasses. And that’s all it takes to go missing from the Wizarding world, apparently.
“Well…erm…” Harry says gracefully.
The End :)
"Harry, this is some kind of crazy dark magic..." Ron almost sounds as though he is in awe. Harry isn’t sure how he feels about that.
“I just, can’t be a part of something like that anymore. I’ve been given a second chance at life and I owe it to myself to just be….
Draco’s words from the previous night resound in Harry’s frazzled brain as he disapparates desperately back to their flat. He can only hope he isn’t too late.
He sucks in a breath. "Okay." He says.
When he enters the room, Draco looks at him as though nothing else in the universe exists. His lips quirk up into the tiniest smile before drawing back into a thin, tight line. Harry feels his pulse quicken and he is overwhelmed with emotion. He chokes back a sob and draws in a shaky breath. Draco is the most beautiful thing he has ever seen. He is pale, skin stretched so thin he appears hollow, and he is visibly tired. His shoulders sag heavily into the mattress, and the dark circles under his eyes give the appearance of a skeleton. He is fragile and thin, yet his eyes are determined, fierce even. They are the same vibrant grey that Harry remembers, so bright they look silver in the harsh light of the room. Draco is strong. Harry knows he will be able to move past what has happened and live a normal life again. He just knows it. He can’t accept any other reality.
Two hours later, Harry finds himself stumbling groggily to the bathroom to relieve himself. The headache seems to have subsided just a bit, enough so that his thoughts are allowed to turn for the worst. Dark thoughts threatening to intrude upon his blurry consciousness and ruin his overall tranquil mood. Harry can’t bear it, so he finds his way back to the kitchen and pulls the whiskey glass out of the sink. He pours himself two fingers and adds a few ice cubes from the freezer. Then he sits at his small table yet again and pulls out the letter. He sighs as he reads the words over and over, taking comfort in the easy feeling that settles into his soul, the way that the dark thoughts just slip away and the world around him appears slightly fuzzy at the edges. Once the uneasy feeling has fully subsided, about two whiskey drinks later, Harry finally starts his day.
“Did you not allow her to see him while I was in there?” He asks the mediwitch, commanding her attention instantly. This one is different from the one who let him in originally to see Draco. The previous one had seemed caring and kind – this one, not so much. She shuffles a bit before righting herself. Her dark red hair is tied back into a tight bun, bright green eyes covered in thick make up as she looks back up at him. She is curvy and a bit plump, and awfully short.
“No.” Ginny’s shoulders begin to shake.
“It’s my turn, now.” She tells him, a furious glint in her eyes as she turns to look up at him. Her eyes are red and her tears are stained with mascara. Her fiery hair is pulled back into a tight, high pony tail, although some strands have begun to escape in no particular pattern, making her look almost comical. Harry dares not laugh, even though he wants to, neither out of nervousness nor at her appearance.
"As I'll ever be." I answer. The importance of this very moment is not lost on me.
“Hold on - slow down, ritual? Children? You need to start from the beginning... And Draco, just go at the pace you are comfortable with. I’m not in a hurry.” At this point, Harry has pulled a chair up close to Draco, placing his hand gently over his wringing ones. Draco is caught in some kind of despair and Harry’s heart aches. He doesn’t know how to fix it. Part of him wants to scoop him up and never let go, but the other part doesn’t want to cross some unknown boundary. This is uncharted territory. Draco stares down at their joined hands with wide eyes, almost panicked. He decides that since Draco doesn’t pull his hands away from him, this is a good start.
His hand forced, Harry looks each of them in the eye and states, rather simply, “Ron, Hermione….I’m gay.” There. Like a band aid, Harry figures, now it’s out there and they can get on with either accepting or disowning him. He only hopes they can make up their minds quickly. Ron stands and stares, mouth gaping and shutting like a fish out of water. Hermione, on the other hand, nods resolutely, depositing the contents of the fresh takeout onto the small table at the far corner of the room. She then turns to Ron and takes the bags from his hands as well so that she can place them on the table.
"Fuck," he says elegantly, watching the prone man lose consciousness. The blonde twink that had been undressing the unconscious man moments before stops his disgusting ministrations and surveys his surroundings. Draco deduces that he only has a few moments to act. He wraps his coat around himself tightly and charges at the other man, figuring the element of surprise will give him the upper hand.
My heart breaks at the seams as my mind races with these horrid thoughts. I'm so caught up in these terrible thoughts that I don't even realize there are two vibrant green eyes staring at me. He seems thoroughly pleased to find me sitting across from him.
"My being there had nothing to do with you, Malfoy." Harry says. He really doesn't want to get into it right now. He needs a drink. He needs to get the fuck out of here and as far away from anything that reminds him of his past, and quickly. "Just let me go and I'll be on my way!" He screams, and it comes out harsher than he intended.
He just needs to think. There has got to be a way out of this. What was Potter doing in the same club that Draco frequents from time to time? Was he looking for him? Draco thought he had covered his tracks and disappeared from the Wizarding world without a trace. He did not want to be found. He's worked so hard to make a new life for himself. He's got friends, and a life here. And it's been so many years, what could they want with him anyway? Draco's first thought is to go through the Gryffindor's pockets to see what he can find, there's got to be a clue somewhere.
"I will," he lies, "just give me time to chase this lead and when this is all over, I will see someone." She sighs with relief, retreating back to her side of the bed. Harry feels much better when the weight of her arms, her stare, and her presence have left him.
Harry should feel at home here. He should be grateful for the family he has. But his mind is racing with thoughts of the case. In this moment he finally realizes what he has been doing wrong, why he hasn't been able to get the incantation right. The incantation is ancient, rooted in deep, dark, and highly illegal magic. Harry needs to have dark feelings to use it. It is possible that he needs to direct his feelings of revenge toward locating the dark wizard that killed Draco, rather than simply casting clinically and hoping for the best. These spells are fickle at times, highly connected to the emotions behind it, much like unforgivables. He can barely contain his excitement-
Chapter 6: A World Away
“I take it, today didn’t go so well….” Draco says cautiously. Harry only nods, relishing in the smell of sandalwood that assaults his nostrils as he enters the flat. The takeaway containers from earlier are nowhere to be seen, and the flat is back to its pristine condition. Such a contrast to Draco’s desk at work. “Shit, Harry, I’m sorry…” Draco says genuinely. He runs his fingers through his white-blonde hair, and takes a step closer to Harry. The smell of him, the body heat that emanates from him, the sleepiness in his eyes, it’s almost too much for Harry to bear, and he closes the distance between them, stepping slowly so as not to scare the other man away.
Harry looks over at the empty desk on the other side of his spacious office, the one that used to belong to Draco. He tried to keep it as intact as possible but eventually he couldn’t take the weird looks and sympathetic glances anymore, so he had allowed the desk to be cleaned out. He regrets this now, as he can barely remember how it used to look. Draco was a messy partner, so his desk was always cluttered and filled to the brim with paperwork. The paperwork was his so-called “least favorite” part of the job, yet he was so infuriatingly
“No, Harry, that’s an excuse and you know it!” She screams.
"It's getting harder to sneak away....Voldemort knows there is a rat among us. He doesn't suspect me, at least I don't think he does."
“After you,” Malfoy cuts into his thoughts like a hot knife through butter. Harry blinks over at him before leading the way out of his apartment and the comforting feeling he has attached to it. They go to the same grocery store that Harry has been frequenting as of late, its location conveniently situated just along the way back to Malfoy’s flat. Harry prays that the staff will not mention anything about his usual purchases there. He’s fairly confident that they won’t, as they typically don’t say much either way.
."  He pulls me into a bone crushing hug, and I notice there are tears in his eyes. His hand tangles in my hair and for a moment we just breathe each other in.
"Yeah, but you're
"What is it that you would like to know?" I ask.
“Well actually I was looking for Ginny,” Harry tells him, “I nipped out of work early but I can’t seem to remember where she said she would be.”
they did." I mumble, drawing a slight chuckle from him.
“Relax man, there’s no one out to get you… maybe you’re just a little paranoid?” His dance partner asks, placing a hand on his arm. Harry stares at the hand for far too long. Maybe that’s it, it’s happened before so it’s not completely out of the realm of possibilities. He just needs to get a grip. He can feel his heart beating so rapidly in his chest that he thinks it might burst out at any second.
"What have you done?!" I repeat, louder this time in the hopes he will give me a straight answer.
He finds fresh pressed clothes and Auror robes waiting for him on the coffee table, folded neatly. As if he needs to feel
"Good thing then, because you're rubbish at keeping promises," I hope my joke is enough to break the tension and it is. He laughs before crushing me back into his arms for a breathless kiss.
Another diagnostic spell reveals that a very specific timer spell has been placed on the documents. So when Dresden banished them it was only temporary. Meaning who ever this K.S. person is, they are bound to come and try to collect the documents any minute. If Harry stakes out the place he could easily catch them. He figures that this is very time sensitive, so it is highly possible this person may even be planning on coming to retrieve the documents today. He spends some more time digging through the documents and familiarizing himself with the blood ritual, something called “Sanguinum Purgo,” when a small photograph slides out onto the ground at his feet. Brimming with curiosity, Harry bends over to pick the photograph up. It is clearly an old photograph, slightly faded on the edges, but the magic is still ever present. Dresden looks much younger, happier, and healthier even, as he stands next to a young teenaged boy who looks oddly familiar. In the picture, both smile and turn toward the camera, with Dresden draping an arm around the young boy’s shoulders. They are standing inside of someone’s kitchen, although Harry doesn’t recognize it at all. He stares for a few minutes at the repeating sequence of events in the photograph, his heartbeat speeding as a dreadful realization slowly bubbles to the surface of his addled mind. Everything suddenly clicks into horrifying clarity as he finally recognizes the young boy to be none other than Kingsley Shacklebolt.
"Yeah. I kicked ass." He jokes. We both chuckle lightly. He grips his head with one hand. "Ow." Our fingers remain interlinked, however, and it's something I am very aware of.
"What happens now?" I ask him. He gives me a sad smile, eyes veering from my own to a point somewhere behind me.
In this moment Ron finally comes rushing over. "Good job mate, that was so fast! I've found nothing though, this case is going to prove a bit difficult for us--
Harry is able to trace the magical signature of the payment transactions to the cottage where Dresden had been hiding out. His stomach feels heavy, as though he had eaten rocks for lunch instead of delicious curry. He doesn’t feel like he is any closer to solving anything at all, just incurring more unanswered questions. He gives Mary a very large sum of money to continue Annie’s payments. It’s the least he can do since he feels somehow responsible, even if logically he knows that he isn’t. Mary thanks him profusely, and Harry stresses the importance of keeping the status of his donation strictly anonymous. He is assured that Annie will never find out and, even though Mary gives him a funny look when he requests this, neither will Ginny. He feels honestly tired and desolate as he makes his way back home. With this new piece to the puzzle, Harry knows what he has to do next. He really has no other choice.
“Just give me a moment so I can get dressed.” Harry swallows again and nods at him. He can’t help but peak into the room. It’s also neat and tidy, but Harry’s heart sinks as he notices that Draco’s bed is not dressed. His sheets and blanket are laid out on the floor in a corner of his room, complete with pillows, as if the man has been sleeping on the ground instead of in his bed. When his eyes turn back to peer into stormy gray ones, Draco’s face is flushed with embarrassment. “It just….feels more normal this way. I can’t sleep otherwise.” He offers, before turning on his heel and shutting the door behind him. Harry can’t help but feel as though he has invaded a deeper part of Draco, a part that no one else was ever meant to see. He is almost shaking with rage, partly from the indignity of how Draco was treated, and partly from the life that was stolen away from him as well.
"Okay?" I mirror stupidly. I was expecting a bit more fight than that. But maybe Potter is tired of waiting, too.
“Will this be all..?” She asks, surprised, presumably because there aren’t two or three bottles of various alcohols in the shopping cart. Malfoy exhales softly next to him, opens his mouth as though he is going to ask a question, but Harry quickly cuts him off.
"Enjoy your last few hours, Ferret." With those words, he is gone in a flash. I unceremoniously wiggle about until I am at least in a position that doesn't
Harry sits in the waiting room at St. Mungo's. He is tired and on edge all at the same time. Draco is stable, those are the only words he has heard from the mediwitch caring for him, but it's enough for Harry. He will wait until the blonde wakes up, even if it takes days. Yes, Harry isn't going anywhere, not until he can look into the silver orbs that have haunted his nightmares for months on end.
“This isn’t what it looks like.” Draco says quietly, “Harry, I just need you to listen.” Harry nods against the pain in his throat, but Draco doesn’t let up. He surveys his surroundings. The flat is in complete disarray. There are definite signs of struggle. It
“Hey buddy!” Harry tells him before planting a kiss on his forehead. He puts him back on the ground, ruffles his black messy hair, and watches as he rushes into Draco’s arms, whose smile is genuine as he returns the hug tenfold. Albus gives Draco a kiss on the cheek and steps away, grabbing Draco’s hand and pulling him toward the large decorated Christmas tree they have set up in the living room.
Harry hasn't thought about Ginny. He hasn’t thought about anything since he discovered that Draco is alive. He sighs heavily. She will have to understand, won't she? She knows how important this is to Harry.
Along the way back, Harry ponders what he will say to Draco when he wakes up. He more than likely will be confused, possibly even traumatized. Who knows what he has been through this last year. Harry shudders, remembering the state of him when he found him. He sits for what feels like at least a few more hours before the mediwitch approaches him.
Harry breathes in deep and decides to let it go. He is too consumed with ultimate happiness and pleasure to care about such mundane things as his friend knowing the intimate details of his sleep cycle. He considers, very carefully, how he would like to speak to said friend. He is his wife’s older brother, and that more than likely trumps their friendship a thousand times over. He needs to placate his friend so that he feels Harry has Ginny’s best interest in mind. He doesn’t want him to be suspicious of….well Harry isn’t sure what, exactly. He doesn’t know if things will be as they were. He hasn’t had a chance to speak with the flaxen haired man who is separated from him by just one tiny wall. He doesn’t know if he is even the same man, or how what he has been through must have affected him.
“Harry,” She begins, her eyes watering slightly as she is overcome with emotion. Harry just stares awkwardly, waiting for her to finish. She reaches into her purse and pulls out a photograph. She hands it to him, tears falling fully from her eyes. Harry takes it and looks at it in confusion. It’s a sonogram. A tiny, indiscernible fetus does flips and wiggles around before stopping and starting again in the same trajectory. The connection is instant, and Harry feels the prickling of tears in his own eyes as he looks back at Ginny and then down at the sonogram again.
He barely wants to know what else Draco had to go through. He casts a cooling charm on his hands, reaches for Draco’s again.
Harry stands and stretches languidly before padding into the kitchen to make himself some toast and eggs. His head is pounding. He fumbles around in the medicine cabinet and finds a rather large bottle of ibuprofen. It’s half empty, so he makes a mental note to buy more at the grocery store later. Hands still shaking, he takes three pills from the bottle and washes them down with some whiskey that sits on his counter from the previous night. He blanches as the warm liquid burns its way down his throat, then finishes off the rest and places the tumbler in the sink. He makes another mental note to do the dishes today, perhaps when his head is feeling a bit better.
“No I – AAAHHHH!” The scream sounds animalistic and startled, and even Draco looks surprised that he has made such a sound. He doubles over then, landing harshly on his knees and lurching forward unceremoniously. Harry jumps into action immediately. He will be damned if something happens to Draco on his watch ever again. He rushes to his side, helping him to stand.
“No,” Draco says, “I’ve been too ashamed to tell anyone.” Harry squeezes his shoulders gently.
“I do but…don’t you remember the last time we were here?” Draco’s voice is husky, and it sends strange sensations vibrating throughout Harry’s entire body. He does remember, quite suddenly and quite vividly, the last time they visited this particular establishment…
"Potter," I croak, a broken smile spreading across my lips. "The others?" I ask.
“How do you know him?” Harry asks hopefully.
"I'm sorry, Potter, I can't let you leave like this. I have a feeling you've run from something, it's the only explanation as to why you are here. And with no magic, we might just be an even match." Malfoy snorts at that, as if using his short comings for humor would somehow make Harry feel better. But that's not right, because since when did Malfoy care about how Harry feels? And since when did he have a sense of humor?
"Wait...my mother she...what?"
Once inside, Harry puts away his groceries. He pours himself a double shot of rum, washes it down, and then forces himself to drink a glass of water. He can’t stop the tears as they fall from his eyes, so instead he wipes at them furiously and sinks down to the carpet. He makes a mental note to vacuum tomorrow, even as sobs begin to escape him and his body shakes with emotion. He gasps for air, screams, slams his fists into the wall behind him. It lasts only a few minutes before he composes himself and climbs to his feet. He finishes the glass of water, tosses the dishes in the sink, and makes his way to the bathroom, where he grabs a quick shower. The water doesn’t stay hot for very long, but Harry doesn’t mind. He doesn’t need a lot of time to wash up anyways. People are yelling at each other next door, the muffled sounds of it drifting through the walls as Harry dries himself roughly with a towel.
A few moments later, Draco emerges from his bedroom, head held high as he practically stomps over to sit opposite of Harry in an equally plush love seat. Harry has a momentary, unbidden flashback – of himself in Draco’s lap on the loveseat, as he rides him mercilessly. He reels from it, blinking as he shakes the thought away. He really shouldn’t be here. This is dangerous territory. Even worse, he recognizes the look in Draco’s eyes as he stares him down darkly. The other man is daring him to say one thing more about the bedding on the floor. He’s a wounded animal, caught but still standing his ground. His bravado doesn’t match his whimsical pajamas, light blue top and bottoms with golden snitches whizzing around to and fro. Blue really is Draco’s color. Harry tries to smile, and it works. Draco is disarmed momentarily, and he melts like a lump into his seat, seemingly relieved. “What’s the news?” He asks interestedly.
Chapter One: A Lonely Company
“Did you hear me?” Draco’s voice cuts in. “Because your face is not conveying the emotion I thought it would.”
“Sorry,” he says, handing her the new cup, which she drinks from cautiously. Satisfied, she takes a bigger gulp and then tucks in to her meal. Harry doesn’t make a move to eat, just fidgets in his seat as he watches her, trying to find the right words to say.
“Wait, Draco, what did he do to you?”
But Harry feels nothing. The only thing that finally allows him to harden beneath her and reach his completion are thoughts of a man who died long ago. Harry remembers the weight of a hard body pressed against his. He thinks he can still smell him; the earthy, spicy scent of sandalwood and a hint of something entirely unique. The minty, sweet heat of his breath. He can feel tight, lean muscles on his fingertips. Taste chapped, full lips against his own.
“Your healing process is not my business to tell to anyone.” He says, and he means it.
More time goes by. As I have more time to think I become increasingly anxious. What will Potter really think of all this, of being outed by a sleazy magazine with an even sleazier writer? Was he even planning on making our relationship public knowledge? Do we even have what could be considered a relationship? Now that the war is officially over, he can probably go back to his life as it was before. We could go our separate ways and chalk it all up to a tense situation. I mean, of course two boys would fuck each other to relieve stress during a scary, uncertain time, right? And what if Potter realized after all that my crimes are unforgivable? That I am just an unworthy monster incapable of being loved?
He turns his attention to the waiter, who has come over to take their drink order. He feels Draco’s eyes boring into him, but doesn’t look at the other man until the waiter has left the table to fetch their drinks. He pretends to look at the menu, but he can’t really make out any of the words. He is going to let Draco order for him anyways, and they both know that, because Draco knows how to read French and Harry simply doesn’t. Besides, Harry doesn’t really care what he eats at this point, he is just happy to be there. A lump forms in his throat as emotions he has been trying to suppress fight their way to the surface.
“Hold on,” Hermione says, “you can’t just rush Shacklebolt in like this, they’ll bring you down before you can even get a word in edgewise.” She flicks her wand at the documents, watches as a duplicate set forms in front of her. “My set will be temporary, but it will be enough for me to get started on my research. Harry, bring these to the ministry, and Ron, you stay here until you get the go ahead.”
, Dresden was actually healing. And there was Annie to think about, she was such a sweet girl, and she wasn’t getting any better wasting away in Mungo’s. So even when Dresden died there was Annie to think about and of course, the money involved should we find success. I figured it would be easy enough to persuade Draco to continue with me once the documents were brought back.”
“We can’t make any promises, but we know what to do now.”
He cries out, releasing Draco’s cock from his mouth to pant against the other man’s thigh. Draco begins to thrust his fingers faster and faster, adding a third and making Harry feel like he is going to explode. He pulls away from Draco’s ministrations finally, flipping himself over, mouth colliding with Draco’s as he impales himself in one steady motion onto Draco’s leaky, rigid member. Now Draco cries out, the sound muffled against Harry’s mouth as Harry begins to thrust himself up and down on Draco’s cock in a traitorous rhythm. Draco’s cock stretches and fills Harry, with a burning pleasure so good that it brings tears to his eyes and a sting to his throat. Harry swallows the emotion of it all, kissing Draco with all his might as his cock slides against the other man’s stomach. Draco reaches in between them to stroke him, matching Harry’s thrusts. Their mouths disconnect as Harry takes in gulping breaths, but Draco is relentless, sucking at Harry’s throat, his free hand on Harry’s hip, helping him keep pace.
"Don't die." I am so serious it's painful. My eyes are pleading with him.
“Okay, I’m ready.” And Merlin, he is so gorgeous in his outfit, it steals Harry’s breath away. The robes are a bit big on him, but otherwise he is absolutely stunning. It occurs to Harry that it probably doesn’t matter what Draco would have chosen, he is beautiful in anything. He gets choked up at the thought, overwhelmed suddenly with a flood of emotions. The fact that Draco is standing right there, that he’s alive. It feels like a new beginning of some sort. Harry’s heart swells with the hope of it all.
Draco, for his part, doesn’t break eye contact as he takes in Harry’s words. Then he sighs quietly as if relieved, and nods, a small smile appearing on his lips in a delicate manner. “I’d really like that, Harry.” He tells him, and all is well with the world again. And even though their first night together is absolutely uncomfortable, and Harry wakes up with horrible back pain, he thinks it’s completely worth it.
“Draco is in the hospital.” Harry says dully, “they have to do an emergency procedure. He didn’t look alright… he-he was in a lot of pain.” He has trouble finishing the sentence, as if the words are sticking to his mouth.
“Do you remember…Sunday, just before you excused yourself? ‘
Harry thinks he quite likes her. She seems to really have Draco’s best interest at heart.
I'm staring death right in the face and I'm fucking terrified
“Please-“  He pleads, shuffling to catch up to her.
"That remains to be seen." I can read between the lines of that statement. If the information I have shared about this next attack checks out, then I'll be pardoned. They know I am the only double agent who has held true to their side; all others have betrayed them. This truly is their last shot at having the upper hand on the dark side. If I haven't betrayed them like all the others, I will be pardoned. Do I even deserve to be pardoned? Probably not, but I hang desperately to the idea that I could live a somewhat normal life after this war is finally over.
"Potter," I warn, seconds before my orgasm rips through me. I try to pull away but he holds me in place, swallowing down my cum like it's the most delicious thing he has ever tasted. My knees threaten to buckle out from under me. He pulls away, wipes his mouth with his hand, and flashes me a grin. His lips are red and swollen, eyes sparkling with something I can't recognize. I am almost hard again from the sight of him. With determination, I push him onto his back on the ground and return the favor. When he climaxes, I realize that maybe my cum
“Listen, why don’t we go back to the bar? I’ll buy you a drink.” His dance partner says, and it’s clear to Harry that this man is invested.
"Voldemort is planning to send scouts nearby tomorrow. He has an idea of where you and your friends are located, but thanks to me, doesn't know exactly where you are and is tired of coming up short. But the idea is to scare you off, have you retreat to Hogwarts. He has connections there that will allow him past the wards...and then he's coming for you, Potter. He will be there himself."
“What would you like to know?” Mary asks him, eyes wide with sincerity.
Harry finds himself staring at the sonogram she has left with him in the wake of her absence. He knows he needs to look up and face the man who shuffles in his seat not too far away, but it’s difficult. He wants to bask in this small moment of pure happiness before navigating the complex dynamics that have suddenly been thrust unto his new and tenuous relationship with Draco. He hears the heavy thud of cane that indicates Draco is walking over to him. He swallows before staring into tumultuous silver eyes with his own pleading hopefulness.
"I'll do my best, but I can't make any promises." He tells me, trying to smile. I can see he is holding back tears.
He brings Draco a mug of tea; two sugars and a splash of milk, just the way he likes it. Draco sips gratefully, moaning softly at the taste. Harry watches his Adam’s apple bob as he gulps the liquid down. He can’t help but notice how sexy Draco is in this moment. Draco catches him staring and smirks at him.
And then I hold back my tears so hard my eyes bulge out of their sockets from the force of it. After about 15 minutes of this torture, I'm startled as a head appears in midair right in front of me.
Once Potter is secured in the bed, Draco closes the door with a soft click and finds his way into the kitchen. He pours himself a glass of water, drops some Alka Zeltzer and gulps it down, before stripping out of his heavy coat. Despite the chill of the outside, he feels devastatingly hot. His heart is pounding a mile a minute. He stumbles over to his bathroom and runs the shower, scrubbing the gel and make up from his hair and face respectively before climbing in. He finds himself finally relaxing as the hot water pounds over his sore muscles.
Once everyone’s bellies are full the brim from delicious roast and sweet, sticky pudding, it’s time for the Christmas Eve tradition of exchanging gifts. Harry’s heart pounds and his head fills with nervousness as he removes the small, neatly wrapped gift he had hidden in his pocket. He and Draco had purchased joint gifts for everyone else, and Harry watches as Draco swishes his wand, and everyone’s gifts come floating out from where they were sitting underneath the Christmas tree to land in front of them. They spend the next half hour exchanging and opening gifts, smiling and thanking each other for the different assortments of trinkets and treats from each other, and hand knitted sweaters from a certain Weasley matriarch. Harry can’t help but chuckle as he notices the look on Narcissa’s face as she inspects her own hand knitted sweater, silver like her eyes, with shiny little golden lights spread across the stitching.
“Oh, Harry, that’s great news!” She says genuinely, “He’s been through so much….” She glances back over at Draco, who sleeps peacefully, blissfully unaware of the horrible awkward tension in the room. She turns her attention back to Harry and motions for him to sit down with her at the table to eat. Her belly is round and low now, and she is a bit breathless as she sits heavily down onto the chair. She begins to remove the containers of takeout as she updates Harry on her research.
He looks at me and sees me entirely. "It's okay Draco, I know." Tears form in the corners of my eyes even as my orgasm rips through me unexpectedly. He is not too far behind me, moaning in wanton pleasure before collapsing on top of me. He whispers a cleaning charm and tucks me back into my clothes as I lay boneless on the ground, tears falling silently. And then he is pulling me into him.
“Bullshit, Harry! A good husband believes his wife when she tells him she has nothing to do with something. A good husband turns the case over to someone else when it becomes a conflict of interest!” Tears of rage are falling from her eyes steadily.
Harry works his mouth down Draco’s neck to the sensitive spot of his collar bone, sucking gently, enjoying the beautiful sounds Draco makes as he pants harshly into the air. The warm puffs slide just past Harry’s ear as a tongue darts out, making contact with the shell and eliciting a heady groan from Harry as his breath is momentarily taken away. The men are working with muscle memory, each of them having mapped out the other’s sensitive areas long ago. And it’s really not fair, Harry thinks, that they had to be separated from each other for so long, that it took something absolutely horrible happening for them to realize that they wanted only each other from the very beginning.
Now, I sit on a chair next to Potter's bed in the sterile, much too white and bright room. My left hand holds his at his side, while my right idly flicks through The Prophet as it lays balanced on my knees. I'm not sure how long I sit there. I've gotten so good at waiting these past few weeks that it barely phases me now.
have some of that information is way above their pay grade. Harry hasn’t spoken much with Draco since their awkward lunch together. He wonders if perhaps something in the Malfoy library could be of any help. He figures he at least owes the other man an update, even if it’s to say he hasn’t found a whole lot. He struggles with the reality behind these thoughts: he just misses the other man terribly. And so, if Draco wants to keep things strictly business, Harry will have to do just that. The other man made it clear that the ball is essentially in Harry’s court, as much as Harry doesn’t want to face that fact. He just can’t seem to stop thinking about him. Decision made, Harry heads over to Draco’s flat.
he wants to say,
“He liked to really scare the kids, and me. I spent most of the time terrified, until one day I tried to put on a brave face. So to punish me he…he made Polyjuice. He tortured this little girl, and the whole time she thought it was
Harry is forced out into the blistering cold weather without his coat, which he realizes was left draped over his seat inside the bar. It's foggy and wet out, and the streets have cleared for the most part. That's just great, Harry thinks, his luck is impeccable. It's extremely difficult to keep his eyes open at this point, and he can barely move his limbs. The slimy blonde git is basically dragging him along toward an empty alleyway on the side of the bar. The light doesn't quite penetrate back here, and it's eerily silent save for the slight whooshing of the wind around them.
“Nothing really…not much has changed.” Harry answers him honestly. He follows Draco’s line of sight, to the silver wedding band on his left ring finger. It makes Harry feel self-conscious, guilty almost. He fiddles with the ring nervously and Draco looks away.
“Potter,” he says dangerously, “I don’t want your charity sex.” But this doesn’t deter Harry, only makes him want the other man more. It’s a challenge, one Harry is more than willing to accept. He grabs Draco by the collar of his robes and pulls him up to a standing position. Their lips crash, and Harry feels like he is melting from the heat that emanates from both of them. He begins to remove Draco’s clothing quickly, wanting to feel his skin, to kiss him everywhere. Draco breaks the kiss breathlessly and pushes Harry away.
He purposely forces himself to put all his energy and thought into assembling the best turkey club sandwiches he has ever made. He fries up the bacon, slices the tomato, lettuce, slathers the toast in mayonnaise with just a dab of mustard. He takes a moment to admire his creations, and they really are spectacularly assembled. Malfoy moans in agreement as he takes a bite, nodding his head emphatically. Harry doesn’t like the way that sound makes him feel. He doesn’t like the light in Malfoy’s eyes, the way his hair falls into his face, giving Harry the urge to run his fingers through it. He can barely stomach a few bites of his own sandwich, and his anxiety begins to spike as the other man eyes him with concern.
But the words are stuck in his throat.
“Like I said… I don’t remember the attack. I just remember waking up on the floor of the living room in that cabin. Potter he didn’t move me from there, not even once during the entire time he had me. And I was there for what, a year?” Harry nods, his heart is breaking into a million pieces and he is sure this isn’t even the worst of it. He needs to stay strong though, or risk both of them falling apart. Draco needs him to be strong in this moment and he can’t let him down.
“In light of not sounding like a know-it-all, I’m not going to say that I knew this already Harry…but I had, erm, suspicions, for a while now.” She tells him. Harry thinks that she sounds even more like a know-it-all now that she mentions it. He narrows his eyes at her.
On his way out of the hospital room, Harry runs into Narcissa Black Malfoy. Her soft lavender robes billow around her at the waist, pulled tight above it in a fetching manner. Her eyes are sparkly silver, the same as Draco’s, and Harry realizes just how much he looks like his mother. Everyone says he is a mirror image of his father but that’s not the case at all. They share the same angular features, hair and eye color, even the same mouth shape (that delicate bow and arrow that Harry just can’t forget). She tries to be regal as she thanks him, but there are tears in her eyes and her mirth is palpable. He tells her that it wasn’t a problem, and that he would have stopped at nothing to find Draco’s killer regardless. It’s the truth, after all. He is pulled into a surprised embrace, and it’s tighter than he thinks should be humanly possible, but somehow not uncomfortable.
“So she’s ‘Narcissa’ now?” He says cheekily.
"Well you shouldn't, then," my voice lowers a few octaves as I look away from his face. "I'm a monster."
“Talk to me, please Ginny, what are you thinking?” Harry asks finally.
Potter. He looks like he's been crying.
“Yes, I’ll marry you,” Draco breathes afterward, slipping his ring onto his left ring finger with awe. “In case you were wondering.”
“Thanks mate, I needed a good laugh!” Ron slaps him on the shoulder before exploring the kitchen, making different noises of approval as he appraises the food choices. “I think mum will be impressed.” He nods over to Draco, whose shoulders seem to visibly relax.
"You know you can't do that. This is bigger than me, Potter. You know that. You know you are the only one who can end this war. You know you have to be the one left standing-"
“Ginny,” he says it almost pleadingly now, “Protocol would have been to take you in and question you under Veritaserum, but I’m doing it here, at home, and I’m going to leave this out of my notes once I confirm-“
I sit in a holding room with two nameless Aurors across from me. My arms remain bound behind me, stinging with pins and needles. One of the Aurors, the male, clears his throat, accomplishing in getting my attention. In front of me on the table is a small vial filled with a clear liquid. The female Auror attempts a smile as she picks up the vial.
“Good,” Harry starts, “I’ve um… I’ve got some follow up questions for you, from our conversation last night.”
Draco’s shirt is becoming something of a nuisance, Harry realizes, as he fumbles for the third time on a particular button that just refuses to come undone. In fact, all of Draco’s clothes are nothing but a barrier, and without thinking, Harry grabs his wand and banishes the clothes right from Draco’s body. Draco lurches a bit against the cold air suddenly, looking scandalized. Harry drinks in the sight of him, long limbs, slim muscles, with the thinnest, white-blonde hair leading down from his abdomen to a heavy, erect cock, long like the rest of his limbs, pink and full, with a drop of pre-cum at the tip that smears against his stomach. Harry’s mouth waters the sight, and he has half a mind to drop to his knees right then and there, but Draco’s voice interrupts his suggestive thoughts.
"Fuck," says the angel, just before everything turns black.
“Ginny, if I had done that, someone else would be interrogating you in a cold office at the Auror station. Don’t treat me like this, you know I have to follow any leads on this case!” Harry is angry now, and he uses that anger to help bolster his courage. Ginny deflates at his words, placing her head in her hands.
"They've become dangerous," he sighs, carding his hands through his tangle of curls. "They are operating outside the grid, not following any rules. Calling themselves the "light-bringers." I fear they are lowering themselves to the level of the Death Eaters." He flinches a little, casting a furtive glance at the mark marring my left arm. I shrug helplessly. It hurts but he's not wrong. He reaches out, fingers gently caressing the mark as I shudder beneath his touch, trying desperately not to pull away. I know it's his way of trying to sooth the burn. "I do my best to keep them in check, but I'm losing my grip."
It's been a week since the final battle. It was down to Potter and Voldemort, and while obviously Potter did win, he sustained really serious injuries. Healers had to place him under a magically induced coma for three days in order to save him. But when they ended the coma, he stayed unconscious. It was up to him now, the healers said, although his vitals did look promising and he has been growing stronger with the passage of each day.
Potter flashes me a gleaming smile before rushing me and pushing me up against a tree. It is always like this. He is rough with his desires and then tender in the afterglow. We complement each other well this way.
"I'll owl her..." He says distractedly. "Did you speak with Shacklebolt?"
"You saw what happened..." I repeat dumbly. "I don't even know how to do that, Potter."
"Don't worry, I've got you." He says in mock reassurance, and he is grabbing roughly now, jostling Harry further back into the alley until he is satisfied with their privacy. He then pushes Harry down face first into the freezing, muddy ground. The worst part is that Harry can still feel all of it, even as he loses the ability to move entirely. He does his best to move his head so he can at least breathe. He is dying inside, the feel of the hands worming their way into his jeans terrifying him to his very core.
"Draco," his tone is deadly serious, "listen carefully to me, because this is the last time I say this to you..." I force myself to look into his angry emerald orbs, and will myself to stop shaking. "You are a
Don't hesitate to let me know what you think!
“I was so scared to lose you! I still love you, Gin, you’re my best friend. I was too scared to admit that I was gay, and even worse, in love with a man that you and your family have a history with. I’ve never even said those words out loud to anyone before. I just didn’t want to lose my family. You guys are all I have.” He sobs openly, and for a minute the room is filled with only the sounds of their sniffling as they both blow their noses.
"At least it started after we both finished." He smiles, before nuzzling his face into mine. I wrap my arms around him tightly. It is there, wrapped around each other underneath the stars, that he tells me of someone he had lost to the war earlier in the day. He goes on to tell me more things I never knew about him. About his childhood and the shitty family he was forced to live with. About others he has lost to the war. He admits to me how much he worries for his friends.
“Don’t bother.” Draco cuts him off.
"What the
"It's not your job to keep them in check." I reply, "go easy on yourself, Potter. You're doing the best you can." His shoulders seem to sag in relief at that. I change the subject by telling him some things about my childhood, of some of the more mild things I have been forced to do as of late. He looks at me without judgment, and it is all I can ask for.
Instead, I pull him back down and wrap my arms around him once again.
He thinks for a moment that he’s fucked things up, somehow. “I thought you liked this place?” He asks, worrying his top lip with his bottom teeth. Draco watches the motion with a strange look on his face, one that is oddly familiar, and one that sends heat coiling up through Harry’s abdomen to his cheeks.
Draco seems delighted at the prospect of being able to get out, if even for a little while. He is much more calm and relaxed, his shoulders are no longer tensed up and there is a soft, happiness to his features as opposed to the sharp, tense look he had been wearing earlier in the day.
“Oh.” Draco blinks at him, “Come on in.” He steps aside to allow Harry entry and then shuts the door quietly behind them. The flat is neat and tidy, and while it’s always been modest in size, the décor is modern and bright. Harry remembers how surprised he was the first time he came over. The memories continue to flood as he steps carefully into the living room and takes a seat on the plush couch. Draco follows behind and tilts his head toward his bedroom, where the door is open and light pours from the inside.
"No. No, I can't...I can't lose you too." He takes the few strides over to me and his arms are around me in a flash. We shake together for a little while. He has lost almost everyone he loves to this war. I don't want to check off another box on that list. I knew this would happen to him. To me. I was a selfish prick and now he has to pay the price.
"You have a nice smile." He says casually.
“Wight here, Wose!” Albus yells, and the two toddlers hug like they haven’t seen each other in years, even though it was just last week that they had their last play date. Hermione and Ron dust the soot from their coats and greet everyone with a hug.
“Do you love me?” She asks quietly, and Harry is relieved at the question before answering without any hesitation.
"All I've got is bread and butter." Draco responds lightly, "but you're welcome to make some yourself if you'd prefer. Cooking is not my strong suit. I mainly survive on coffee and takeout." He doesn't quite know how to respond to the offer, so he continues with the self-depreciating humor. This is foreign territory between the two of them, and he wonders how long it will last. At his words, Potter gets up from the table and works his way into the kitchen. Draco keeps his eyes fixed forward, sipping from the still warm coffee and resisting the urge to stare at Potter as he tinkers around in the kitchen, fixing what will presumably be much better toast than Draco could ever dream of making himself.
“Alright,” he starts, “if you’re sure…it could be a few hours before Malfoy even wakes up.”
“Yes, I do,” Harry says fondly, forcing himself to look away from his delectable cock and make contact with darkened silver eyes, “That’s why they are folded neatly on your bed.” And Draco laughs slightly, before a devious look crosses his features.
"Hi," he says it so softly it's almost a whisper. Yet I can't help but jump out of my skin from the surprise. I clutch at my chest and try to pick myself up off the floor in a grateful manner.
“Were you working as Dresden’s accomplice?”
"We will do what we can to protect you, Draco," the female Auror says, when it's all said and done, "we can put you in a holding cell in Azkaban and remain as tight lipped about your capture to the press as we can. We can't throw you in a permanent cell without a trial, though, so a holding cell is the best we can do. We will keep it under wraps so no one should be able to find you. We will allow Mr. Potter to say that he and his band of misfits killed you when they captured you." She smiles sadly at me before flicking her wand to remove my bonds. I am surprised by the kindness I have been treated with.
Later, after hours of intensive interviews and diagnostic tests determining that Potter is of sound mind and body, he is finally discharged from St. Mungo’s. Granger and Weasley did stop by at some point during all of it to invite Potter -no, Harry- to stay with them, but he politely turned them down. He had then asked that all other visitors be told to wait until he is discharged to speak with him. He wants to see his friends, he explains, but right now there are more important things he needs to do. Things, he whispers feverishly in my ear when we are alone again in the hospital room, such as getting me into his bed. I shiver in delight.
The wards tingle as Hermione and Ron floo in to the living room, their daughter Rose bouncing excitedly from between them. “Hi aunt Ginny! Hi Uncle Harry!” She greets them, “where’s Albus and Draco?”
“Fine, fine,” Harry starts, “but how do you
“Bloody fuckin’ hell, Potter, you look exhausted,” Malfoy tells him from the sink, giving him a look that says he knows what happened in that bathroom. “Why don’t you try napping for a bit?” Harry thinks that sounds like an amazing idea. He nods and mumbles his agreement before grabbing his duffel bag and turning around to head into the guest room. Just to be sure, he finds his pants again on the guest bathroom floor where he discarded them earlier and searches the pockets thoroughly. He then searches through the rest of his clothes, coming up empty handed once again. He feels suddenly more tired than he has ever felt before in his life. He takes a few deep breaths to calm his frazzled nerves, then strips off his boxers and climbs into the surprisingly comfortable bed.
He stumbles into the living room and finds a fresh pair of boxers and pajama bottoms sitting on the couch along with the pillow and blanket. Even when she is royally pissed, his wife still finds ways to take care of him. No dinner though, and while his stomach is rumbling pitifully, he is too tired to do anything but cast a quick cleaning charm, change his clothes, and pass out unceremoniously onto the couch.
Potter's sullen face is the last thing I see as the darkness surrounds me.
Harry doesn’t know how to respond. He hadn’t really planned this far out. He swallows the lump in his throat and has the decency to nod his head before clearing his throat. “Yeah,” he says finally, “Everything is fine, I just thought I’d check in and update you.”
“No.” This time it’s almost a sob. Harry feels like the biggest asshole on the entire planet. How could he ever have thought she would betray him like this? How could he ever have thought she had anything to do with any of this?
"Did they make you look good, too? I swear if Skeeter messed this up..." he trails off and I look up at him in surprise.
“Now let me see that sonogram you’ve been hogging.” Draco tells him, snatching it from his loosened grip.
“Is that not what we’ve been doing?” He seems genuinely confused, and Harry sighs before trying again.
to be so mean to her. But he knows it has been rough for Mrs. Malfoy this past year. He looks over to see a look of intense approval aimed at him from the fair haired witch. She nods at him, and he blushes, and then the moment passes and she steps past him to get to Draco.
"Have you spoken to Ginny? She's probably worried sick." His friend continues. He slurps at his own coffee, blanching as the bitter, cold liquid touches his lips.
"Yeah." He says it with determined resolution.
“I cleared it with the Mediwitch.” Harry tells him, “she says as long as I’m on top.”
“Harry,” Draco interjects. A smile blooms across his face, and it is absolutely breathtaking. He runs his hands up along Harry’s robes collar softly, up until he is cupping Harry’s face in his hands, and says, “do shut up.” In an instant, rough, chapped lips are pressing fervently against his. Harry’s heart floods with the painful, needy
so goddamned much. I struggle to breathe for a few more seconds, willing my heart to slow down its treacherous pounding around my rib cage. My worst fears have been confirmed. And although I knew from Potter's face the night before that this would be what awaits, there had been a tiny part of me that had hoped maybe it wouldn't come to this.
I awake in terrible pain. My arms are bound behind me, stretched much too tight underneath the weight of my torso. My neck is craned and my head feels like bricks have been piled high on top of it. I'm cold and wet. I blink against the pain as my vision comes swimming back into focus. A survey of my surroundings reveals that I am in some sort of hut and clearly it has been raining or something because I am laying on my back in the mud.
“Draco…thank you so much for trusting me enough to share with me. I’m here for you, if you want to talk more. I promise I will never judge you or your process. I love every part of you, and I only want to help in whatever way I can.” Harry says, pulling the other man into a hug. Draco nods against his chest.
Harry just stares at him for a moment, unresponsive, until Draco starts to squirm uncomfortably. Then, he asks, “How do you figure?” Merlin, but Harry could be such an idiot at times.
“I’m so sorry, Ginny,” he tells her sincerely, “please, look at me-“
"You piece of shit coward, you fucking DEATH EATER SLIME," he starts, sounding much too loud as I gasp unsuccessfully for air. "WE ARE GOING TO KILL YOU." He laughs, easing up a little so that I may take in a few mouthfuls of air. "We are going to make an example of you, Malfoy. I'm going to LOVE every second of it." He backs off entirely and I fall to the ground, landing harshly onto my left shoulder. With my arms bound behind me, I am unable to move gracefully, so I choose not to move at all.
"If you were expecting gourmet food, you'll be sorely let down." He says instead, attempting at humor, and slams the plate of darkened toast onto the table. Potter eyes the toast as if its got mold growing on it. He gulps down some more of the coffee. Seems to think a long time before he speaks again.
Harry snaps out of his flashback with tears in his eyes. He remembers the way their partnership soon proved to be unparalleled in the Auror world. Malfoy was dedicated, had worked so hard to erase his past wrongdoings. Despite the fact that he wasn’t well liked to begin with, he was so good at what he did that he soon commanded the respect of the other Aurors. Not to mention he was a fantastic partner; intuitive, reliable, and selfless. They were so good together, they were almost unstoppable. Draco's smile could disarm him in an instant. He remembers the skillful and strong way that he fought, his unwavering sense of justice…
“Bottom’s up,” she tells him, gulping the contents down quickly, “let’s do this.” She slams the vial down, smashing it onto the table angrily. Harry grabs the other vial and tips it back before casting a quick cleaning spell over the table. “Go ahead then, Harry, ask me.” She dares him, eyes like daggers as she stares him down. Harry has a sinking feeling that he’s made a mistake, somehow, but it’s too late for him to go back on it now.
“Draco, are you okay?” Harry asks, a sinking feeling in the pit of his stomach.
“Isn’t it though?” Ron glances over at the clock hanging on the wall, an antique that Draco had hung there long ago. “It’s half past three, and Harry, you’ve been working non-stop since yesterday. Maybe it’s time to go home and talk to your wife, yeah?”
“Harry!” she returns, “Get the
“And you think that, what – Ginny had something to do with it all?” Draco looks almost appalled on her behalf.  Which Harry finds surprising because he’s thought all this time that Draco hated her.
“Oh, that’s perfect, then.” Ginny answers, before turning toward Albus, who is hanging tinsel around Draco’s shoulders. “Albus! Make sure you put your teddy in your room, honey, you don’t want to lose it!”
“See you later.” He says carefully. Draco shrugs before looking away. It’s so frustrating to Harry that he doesn’t understand what he could possibly be doing wrong. He sighs quietly, choosing to say nothing further for fear of fucking things up even more, and turns toward the door. He doesn’t hear another sound as he steps out and shuts it behind himself.
“What shall we eat, then?” He asks, and Harry beams at him.
"What is there to discuss?" He scratches at his head, voice growing much too loud for their bedroom. "I have worked tirelessly and now for the first time in a year I may have a lead on his killer. I hardly think there is anything wrong with that Ginny, he deserves justice." He works hard to temper his voice and calm his nerves.
of ruining moments.
By the time I get to visit Potter in his room at St. Mungo's, The Prophet has already published a story about us. I've been held back from seeing him for a few days with all sorts of court proceedings and paperwork. Who knew being pardoned could be such a tedious endeavor?  The Prophet story depicts a torrid love affair in which I am somewhat heroic, if a bit misguided. It talks about my good deeds and how I ultimately had a hand in helping Potter defeat Voldemort. It talks about Potter's ability to see the good in everyone, his willingness to give me a chance against all odds. It even mentions my mother very briefly. I scoff at the article, but butterflies are raging inside my stomach at the thought of being outed for all the world to see. I wonder what Potter will think about all this if -no
I can only hope that Voldemort wasn't feeding me misinformation about his plans.
“Gin…I-We um…weren’t expecting you.” Harry says lamely. He scratches at the back of his head in nervousness. He really hasn’t seen or spoken to her directly since she kicked him out. Their only interactions have been through letters and paperwork finalizing their divorce, which was amicable, at least on paper. Harry has not forgotten that Ginny holds all the power here. With just a few simple words, she could turn her (and therefore Harry’s) entire family against him.
I am so happy I think my heart will burst. My smile is wide and bright as I stare at him indulgently. A mediwitch enters the room and murmurs something softly as she runs some diagnostic tests and checks Potter's vitals. She remarks how everything is looking good, begins to say some other things quietly. But he doesn't miss a beat. His eyes are on me and only me, waiting for my response.
Harry sends a Patronus to Ron and Hermione, who Apparate into the flat moments later. “Oh, Harry!” Hermione shouts at the sight of him. “Are you okay? What happened?” At her gentle touch to his shoulder, Harry falls apart. The tears come full force and he is helpless to stop them as his friend wraps her arms around him as best as she can. Her belly makes it quite difficult to do so, and Harry thinks for a moment that she must be due any minute. Ron surveys the area, and Harry can hear his muffled shout of surprise when he enters the bedroom. He fumbles around in his pockets and produces the documents, tiny once again for portability. Hermione takes them from him, and with an easy flick of her wand they return to their regular size. She studies the papers for a minute, stares at the picture for far too long, and then realization is made clear on her face. Harry sits down heavily on the couch.
He impales himself on my cock in one swift, breathtaking motion. We both cry out at the force of it. I lose control in this moment, flipping us over so that he is on his back with his thighs wrapped around my hips. I kiss him hungrily, moving my hips in a steady rhythm. I thrust my cock deep and then pull back almost entirely before slamming into him again and again. His hands are tangled in my hair as he murmurs words of encouragement against my lips.
The next morning, Draco and Tilda are sat in the dining room having tea together. Draco looks much more relaxed than he had the night before. He had taken Harry’s advice and called her in today to talk about the cutting. Harry leaves them to their privacy. He can’t stop thinking about the night before and everything that he has witnessed. Draco has been acting so very strange, and, for all intents and purposes, it is almost as though he is continuing to uphold some part of the ritual. It stands to reason that his trauma has caused him to cope in such a strange way. There is even a possibility that his magical signature has been somehow altered by the blood ritual, since they know nothing about it, and it could even be compelling him to continue to uphold the parts of the ritual that don’t morally compromise him. But there is a sinking feeling that Harry can’t escape, that Draco knows more than he lets on, or even worse, he has been somehow involved. Even the mere thought of it causes his insides to twist with utter horror.
“Lay back,” he tells him, and Draco hesitates, but gives in when Harry pushes a little harder. Harry assaults him with hot kisses, pressing his hard length against him as he does so. He works his way down to Draco’s lengthy, hard cock and wraps his mouth around him hungrily. Draco bucks shamelessly into his mouth, fingers tangled in Harry’s messy locks of hair. The fingers tighten and pull up until Harry finds himself staring into half lidded silver eyes. Draco begins to nudge Harry to turn until Harry understands, and he lines himself up so that his cock is now in Draco’s face as he takes Draco’s in his mouth again. He feels wet heat begin to wrap around him and he moans around the length of Draco’s manhood. Draco’s hands press firmly into Harry’s buttocks, urging him to thrust deep into the blonde man’s throat. Harry summons a small vial of lubricant from the nightstand next to the bed and presses it into Draco’s hand. After a few moments of shuffling behind him, he feels Draco’s slick finger pressing against his entrance. Harry moans at the wonderful pressure, relaxing and allowing the finger entrance. He quickens his pace on Draco’s cock, sucking full force as he thrusts up into the finger and then down into the searing throat below him. It’s almost too much, and then a second finger soon joins the first and it is all Harry can do to stop himself from coming.
"Will I be pardoned?" I ask her, feeling disgusted at the amount of hope my voice is laced with. She flashes another sad and sweet smile.
They sit this way a little longer, the silence stretching on into awkward glances at anything but each other’s faces. Potter hisses a bit more, winces, until finally Draco is unable to stand it any longer. He steels himself before standing and going to the medicine cabinet. “You can take some Tylenol now, as it’s different pain reliever from the Advil, so they can be alternated.” He says softly, handing the bottle to Potter, who accepts it rather gratefully. The broad shouldered man grunts in acknowledgement before gulping down a couple of the pills with the rest of his coffee. He looks as if he’s ready to puke up the contents of his rather puny breakfast. Draco catches his own grimace just in time and moves instead to gather up the dishes and bring them over to the sink. Potter barely notices him and he prefers it that way, focuses on scrubbing the dishes mechanically and drying them before putting them back in their respective cupboards. Something about muggle housework really calms Draco down and helps him to relax. He’s content as he goes about cleaning up.
"I love you," he moans. I can only gasp in response. I want to tell him how much I fucking love him in return. I have never been in love before him and I will never love again after. I want to tell him to find happiness when the war is over, to find someone else to love and to be true to himself. Who gives a fuck if the savior of the wizarding world is bent? Every wizard in England owes him their ass if that's what he wants.
"And when did you begin this relationship with Potter, as a double agent, I mean?"
“Because I’m gay.” Harry has never said those words out loud before. It is at once liberating and terrifying. He waits, with bated breath, while Ginny digests that information. She looks tired and defeated as she stares off into the distance.
"I won't lose you." He whispers into my ear. He kisses the tears on my cheeks. I squeeze his hand in return as I drift off to sleep.
“Yes.” He shuts his eyes against the onslaught of emotions.
“Oh, that’s a money maker right there!” George chimes in. “I bet the idea came from all the celebratory drinking you and Harry have been doing since his big promotion?” Draco’s eyes are filled with nothing but pride as he smiles over to Harry again.
of it all as he surrenders himself to the kiss with a strangled moan. He has missed Draco so much he can barely stand it. He chokes back tears as he deepens their kiss, wrapping his arms around Draco’s waist and pulling him flush against him. Electricity seems to spark between them, sending tingling sensations throughout Harry’s body. Draco shivers against him, seemingly feeling it too. He wraps his hands behind Harry’s head and tangles his fingers in the messy locks of hair there.
to make Draco change his mind. Because he can’t lose him now. Not after everything they have been through.
“Mmm. Sleepy…” Harry tightens his grip on the other man and wraps his legs around him. Sleep overtakes him before he has the chance to think about anything else.
“I just want you to know Harry, this wasn’t anything personal…”
"Okay, maybe just one..." he says, allows the blonde to grasp his shoulder and lead him back to the bar.
Everything happens much too fast. Harry finds himself standing inside of a small cottage in the middle of nowhere. A fireplace is burning, and soft yellows and oranges accent the walls. It smells of hot cocoa and it feels too hot and stuffy. It looks much too….homey to belong to a cold blooded killer. For a brief, terrifying moment, Harry wonders if perhaps there is a family -wife and children or even a family pet – also present within these walls. That would certainly make things… complicated.
"Draco..." he says. He is frozen in place as his teammates surround us, drawing nearer. I see the female is Granger, coming in hot and fast, wand at the ready. I raise my wand again in an attempt to spur Potter into action but he does nothing, just looks at me resolutely. I have to think. For a second I consider attacking him, if only for appearances, but I don't get that chance as Granger's stunning spell hits me square in the chest.
“Logically, yes, but there are parts of me that don’t answer to logic.” He says cryptically.
Harry really doesn't care what happens to him after the fact. His tunnel vision is trained solely on vengeance. He is not thinking about how this could possibly ruin his career or even his life if the ministry were to investigate his actions too deeply. He feels a bit bad that he has dragged Ron into this, and his one regret would be if his best friend suffers any negative consequences. But they could throw Harry in Azkaban for the rest of his life and it wouldn’t matter to him in the slightest. He wouldn’t change his intentions right now for anything else in the world. Something very precious was stolen from him and he is going to do everything in his power to avenge it.
“I’ve been working on a hangover cure potion, but without the bitter taste or the side effects.”
“Oh.” Awkward silence follows.
“Come here,” Draco says huskily, and pulls Harry up to him for another passionate kiss. His hand slides down Harry’s chest before wrapping around his cock and pumping him firmly. Harry groans at the contact, tongue sliding against Draco’s deliciously. He missed the taste of the other man, he missed the feel of his body against him, he missed everything about him so much, and he wishes he could stay in this moment forever.
Light seeps through the tiny crack under the door as I wake from a fitful sleep. I have no idea how much time has passed. I notice, with a slight tinge of sadness, that I am in a much more comfortable position than I was before Potter had found me. He must have taken the time to position me carefully before he left, and my heart wrenches at the thought.
“Please, Harry, let me finish,” he is beseeching, and Harry clamps his hand over his mouth, trying to fight the tears that are threatening to spill.
“Not yet,” Harry says, “things have been….awkward at home and-” And Harry doesn’t know why he’s telling Draco all of this.
"How long have I been out?"
“I wasn’t sure how you would react…” He starts, but Harry reaches out, lightly touching the cut on his cheek before pulling him into a hug.
He allows himself to puke out all of his insides until nothing comes out any longer, and even then he continues to dry heave for quite some time. He washes his mouth out with water and some toothpaste, using his finger as a brush (damn him for forgetting to grab his bag from the other side of the flat). Harry resolves that even if, and that’s a big IF, he has a problem, he is not going to sort it out with a man he hasn’t seen in years and who used to be his enemy. He will get through the rest of his allotted time here and then he will figure his shit out on his own, as he always has. He doesn’t need help, and certainly not from an ex death eater. He feels odd with that last thought, as if it isn’t true or he’s done something wrong by thinking it. But it is true, isn’t it? He reminds himself. He needs to get a grip, and fake it with gusto. He plasters on the best smile he can muster, wipes his watery eyes, runs wet hands through his hair (it doesn’t help), and makes his way back out into the dining room. Malfoy is already clearing out the dishes.
"I've been thinking lately, Malfoy," he starts. He is so close to me that I can feel his breath on my neck. He looks determined and there is a darkness about him that I hadn't noticed before. It scares me. I am not one to back down, however, so I square my shoulders and look down my nose at him. I still have an inch or two on him so at least there's that.
Draco stops to look at him, waits for some kind of response. Harry’s mind is racing. That’s a lot of information and there is at least one inconsistency. There aren’t any missing children that he can think of, yet according to Draco, there should be quite a few. So Harry voices that opinion, which, seems to be a bit of a mistake.
“We need to get you to St. Mungo’s.” He says calmly, biting back the turmoil that rages inside of him. Draco nods pitifully, gritting his teeth against whatever pain he is feeling. He leans heavily on Harry, but he is warm and solid and still breathing. Harry grabs onto him then, pulling him close, stating “Hang on!” He aims his wand at the unconscious Shaklebolt and reinforces the stunning charms before disapparating himself and Draco to the hospital.
“Oh, they must be thrilled.” Draco says again, and all of this just feels so stilted, and wrong, and it’s painful for Harry to bear.
“Why?” She asks, words laced with agony. Despite his best efforts, the words slip passed Harry’s lips against his will.
"Drake McAfoy?" Potter laughs, plopping heavily onto a dining room chair and taking sips from the coffee Draco has laid out. Draco wants to respond in kind, make a joke about Henry Porter, but realizes at the last second that Potter wouldn't be too keen on knowing he's gone through his personal belongings.
“I’m in love with you, Draco,” Harry confesses helplessly, “I love only you, and everyone else just pales in comparison. The moment you strode into our office confidently those years ago, I was never going to stand a chance. I fell head over heels-“
“Alright mate, let’s bring the bastard in for questioning.” Ron says, his eyes alight with blazing fire.
When Ginny arrives at home, Harry has dinner ready for her. It’s her favorite, although Harry knows this will do nothing to soften the blow, in fact it might make her even angrier. Still, he needed something to do since he was going mad just waiting around for her. She eyes him suspiciously, rightfully so, before plopping down heavily onto the seat across from him. Harry tries to smile at her but his face contorts into more of a grimace than anything else. He instead busies himself with pouring her a cup of tea, two sugars and a splash of milk, just the way she likes it. She takes it gratefully and immediately takes a sip before blanching.
“Easy mate, don’t take the bait.” Ron’s voice gently coaxes Harry back down to earth. “Do you need to get some air? I’ve got this if you need to get away.”
It is Harry who orgasms first, unable to hold out any longer. He bites his lip and rests his head against Draco’s shoulder as he empties himself into him, the pleasure coiling around his insides and causing him to see stars. His hand continues to pump Draco passionately, and Draco cries out with the intensity of his own orgasm, spurts of hot liquid shooting out onto his stomach and chest. Harry pumps him until he is spent, and they both collapse onto the couch in a messy heap of exhaustion. Draco squirms around underneath him until they are laying chest to chest. He wraps his arms around Harry lazily tracing his scar with his fingers and stroking down his face before working his hands back through his hair in a comforting fashion. Harry grips onto him tightly and sighs into his neck, feeling suddenly very tired. Sleep overtakes him almost instantly.
The next time we meet, Potter is on me before I even have the chance to say a word. I am late yet again, an excuse on the tip of my tongue. The look in his eyes is furious, just before he leans in. And then we are kissing and touching and undressing each other under the storm darkened sky.
“How do I know I can trust you?"
Harry finally decides that perhaps he is ready.
“I know,” Draco replies, “and I might keep the hair, after all.”
a child.” He whispers. And then his body begins to tremble, his breaths becoming shallower and quicker until he is panting in a frenzy. “I…I can’t breathe!” Draco shouts in a panic, thrashing about on his bed, a wide and terrified look in his eyes. Harry is shocked, angered, and completely desolate. He wishes he had a time turner so he could go back and kill Dresden over and over. He would do it the same way Dresden did it to those kids, torturous and fear inducing.  Not just for them but for Draco, too, so Draco could have the satisfaction of watching him die over and over.
“No.” She deadpans.
"Emotionally." She interjects loudly. "I'm not talking about the case, Harry. Although that is something else altogether we need to discuss."
monster." He smiles. "How'd you know I was watching?" At my lack of response, he continues. "Well it's done. I told the prophet we killed you right there on the field."
Potter stares at me. "Will you be scouting?" He asks finally.
“Get some rest,” she tells him, “there are some pillows and a blanket on the couch for you.” With those words, she proceeds to walk down the hallway before slamming their bedroom door. Harry has really bollixed things up this time. He feels so awful but he is so exhausted, he figures letting Ginny have some distance would probably be for the best. Better not to approach her when she has made her expectations clear.
“Ugh…okay…DresdenisrelatedtoAnnie.” It all comes out in one breath. Draco just stares and stares.
He is patient when he answers me. "They chose their side, Draco, but you're just a kid. The sins of the father and all that." I swear there is a twinkle in his eye. "I'm not going to lie to you, you will betray your family this way. But I can see your heart, Draco, I know you're conflicted."
He is asleep before his head hits the pillow.
"The bathroom's right over there," he says, as Potter rubs his wrists awkwardly, "your clothes are in there, too, but you're welcome to anything in the wardrobe....there's a glass of water next to you on the night stand and there's Advil in the bathroom medicine cabinet. I'll have breakfast ready for you when you're sorted."
It's afterward, as we lay in a heap of tangled limbs on the ground, that I become very serious. I have some information that could completely change the outcome of the war. It won't be a pleasant conversation, and I know it will absolutely ruin our moment. I am
"Yes, yes, Gryffindor's honor. I'm fine, Malfoy, you'll see." Draco finds himself staring into vibrantly blue eyes, and it feels weird to him, because Potter's eyes should be green. It's now or never. Potter could choose to run out and report him, and Draco would have it coming honestly, life has been too good to him these past 6 years or so. Karma was bound to catch up to him at some point. His fingers brush against warm, smooth skin as he unlocks the handcuffs with a soft click. He blushes, taking the items and tossing them into the drawer of the nightstand next to him. He backs away quickly, feeling strange.
“No, we’re uh, still trying,” Harry answers, voice coming out much too scratchy, “but Hermione and Ron are about to have one, a little girl.”
“If you want to save him, you have to let me go. You have to let us continue, or he’ll die.” Shacklebolt says it desperately, eyes wide with sincerity and cheeks red with emotion. Harry doesn’t even dignify him with an answer as he turns back around and leaves him to plead to the empty air of the cell.
“Are you not hungry?” The blonde asks around a mouth full of sandwich, bits of crumbs sticking to the gloss on his lips. Harry can tell the other man doesn’t eat this well most days. He fights the sudden impulse to wipe the crumbs off his lips with his thumb. He feels a sudden and familiar tightness in his abdomen and freaks out for a moment.
"We've done all that we can… it's up to him now as to whether or not he wants to wake up."
"Yes, Malfoy, just like that...fuck...so good." His words spur me on; his tongue is hot velvet again my skin. I reach between us to grab his prick, hard and weeping as it lays stiffly against his stomach. He grunts at the contact, head falling back onto the ground. My mouth follows him, kissing down his neck to his collarbone, and then down to his nipples as I pump his cock harshly. His nails rake down my shoulders as he moans shamelessly.
"It worked. They are all back at Hogwarts. They don’t understand entirely what is going on, but they trust me. The Aurors are with them...and we will be ready." I nod, taking in a deep breath.
"I've been thinking about that...It can just be our secret. You can become a double agent. Give me information so I can kill Voldemort. And then I'll speak on your behalf when the war is over. But no one else can know right now, it's better that way. I’m not sure others would trust you. Plus, it would be the only way you won't outwardly betray your family. It will keep them safe." His words make sense, but it seems too good to be true.
His anger builds until he can feel his own magic in the air around him. This has happened a few times before, one of those times helping him to defeat Voldemort. The magic feeds his rage and vice a versa until he is nearly unstoppable. His magic cackles in a thick, palpable sort of way around him, like the static of electricity in the air right before lightning strikes on unsuspecting victims. His body strums to life as it courses shockingly through his veins. Harry is not sure how to control this gift he has, but he is happy it is happening now. Fueled by his anger, Harry finally says the words he has been wanting to say without a second thought. He aims his wand with perfect precision, feels the words with every fiber of his being, and more importantly,
“Ugh, Harry, you know I don’t take sugar in my tea.” She says cryptically. Oh, that’s right, Harry thinks, it’s
“I’m fine.” He snaps, and flinches, as he hadn’t meant to sound so harsh. Malfoy raises an eyebrow at him, but says nothing. He looks almost as though he is judging, and that won’t do, as really, Malfoy is not anyone to be judging Harry. If anything it should be the reverse. He catches himself before going down that ugly road, which could only lead to arguing; he is too exhausted to argue. Plus Malfoy is doing his best to be kind, and so far Harry can’t figure out any ulterior motives to his actions. The slimy git seems genuine, which is annoying as hell, honestly.
person who is worthy of love. You have done right in this war. It wasn't easy and you had to do some things in order to survive, but it was not your fault. I love you, Draco Malfoy, and I'd love to try and have a normal, public relationship with you. That is, if you'll still have me."
Finally, she turns back to face him. “Hi, Harry,” She starts, “How is he?”
Harry nips into his office quickly, making sure to avoid everyone else like the plague. He just needs to
“Hi,” Harry says apologetically, a small smile playing at his own lips.
He, on the other hand, is perfectly calm. He tells me that he knows the truth. He tells me it's not too late. I can come to the side of the light. I will be protected. I lower my wand. I want to believe him more than anything. He looks so genuine. With my wand lowered he doesn't move a muscle. I figure if he were lying he would have grabbed his own wand and hexed me by now.
He looks angry for a moment as he pulls away from me.
"They won't," he shakes his head, "we won't...this plan is iron tight, and the Aurors have been really supportive." He nods, as if he is trying to convince himself. Then he looks determined before he says, "like I said before, Malfoy, I won't lose you." And it's enough for now. My anger is mostly deflated anyways, and all that's left is a sort of tired indifference. I've done enough, I think. It's out of my hands.
"Isn't that right, darling?" Ginny's hand is on his arm. Everyone at the table is looking at him expectantly. It isn't hard to fake a smile as he responds.
"Okay," Potter says, and he sounds suddenly tiny and helpless and there is so much pain behind the words that it's almost frightening. Draco has to look away, the emotion in Potter's eyes is just so intense and vulnerable suddenly. He isn't even sure of his own motivations behind what he is doing. True, he is afraid that Potter's untimely death would somehow be connected to him if he were to continue. But is that really enough? Something about seeing him, face down on the cold stone floor in some back alley, it really effected Draco somehow. More than he cares to admit to himself.
“Exactly,” he states, “Please, don’t use me as an excuse to mistreat a Malfoy.” His words are pure vitriol, and the mediwitch has the sense to avert her eyes. She stumbles out an apology with tears in her eyes, and shuffles away again. Harry sighs. He hadn’t
He feels hot breath on his ear, scorching tongue licking the shell of it as his rapist pants against him. "You're so gorgeous." He whispers throatily, and Harry tries his best to look away. Ahead in the distance, a tiny light seems to dance in midair. Harry focuses on that light as it moves up, illuminating the face of what could only be an angel. His angel leans against the wall in the far back of the alley. He has sharp, angular features, and hair that is so blonde it looks white is slicked back with purple and blue glittery gel.
“You don’t.”
“Well yeah, she told me she just wants me to be happy,” he smirks, “besides, if I
“Draco..” Harry says, without direction, voice cracking.
and he saw
“I guess.” He answers lamely. The Mediwitch returns with their paperwork, wheelchair in hand, and is surprised to see Draco is up and walking.
“Uh-what?” Harry asks, slightly caught off guard. Draco just looks bored now.
“See… Annie?” Harry asks, confused.
“Check again, Potter, I’m not lying.” Okay yeah, judging by the dark look Draco is giving him, Harry deduces it was a pretty big mistake to doubt him. Draco probably feels very vulnerable right now. He doesn’t want Draco to think that Harry thinks he is crazy. He switches tactics.
Potter gets onto his knees before me. I am in awe of him as he dips his head, taking my cock, hard and wanting, into his mouth in one swift motion. There is nothing tender in the way he grabs my backside, nor the way that I tangle my hands into his hair. I can see his cock, stiff and leaky as it presses up against his flat stomach, and it's almost too much to bear. He licks and sucks with abandon. The pleasure wraps around me in warm tendrils as I buck helplessly into his mouth.
“You’re reading too much into this Draco, I’m just hungry.” He tries to reassure but Draco doesn’t seem anymore convinced at his words. “This is not a conflict of interest. I’ll exhaust every lead I need to,” his voice is lowering but he knows it’s the truth even as the words come out on their own accord, “whatever the cost. Because you and I both deserve to know the truth about why Dresden did what he did, and who he was working with.” Draco seems to mull this information over in his head before nodding hesitantly.
“Don’t worry about me, mate. I couldn’t sleep even if I tried. I bet Ginny would be relieved to get a good night’s sleep, for once. I am going to owl her right away. Besides, Hermione needs you more than Ginny needs me, I gather. What if she has another one of her late night cravings, or gets another Charlie horse?” The smile he shares with his friend is sincere. He is happy that they are having a baby… Honestly,
“Good, because there’s something I need to tell you, that you can’t tell anyone else, not even Weasley.” Draco’s eyes are dark and smoldering. Harry holds his breath, nods his head. “I think Dresden was working with a partner.” Draco says quietly, eyes boring holes into Harry’s soul. “And I think…I think it was someone from the Ministry. Potter, you can’t trust anyone.” He finishes, at Harry’s lack of response.
“Hi Harry! How are you, my boy?”
“Did you know Augustus Dresden?”
“About two years.” Harry answers shamefully, feeling tears pricking at the corners of his eyes. Ginny seems to contemplate that information for a bit, realization dawning on her freckled features.
“Sanguinum Purgo is a complex and highly invasive ritual. The spell literally binds itself into the blood of the pureblood wizard. Over time, it compels the wizard to carry on his or her part of the ritual. Eventually, Draco would no longer need the chains. He would be cutting his own arm and slaying the sacrifices himself. The compulsion becomes stronger and stronger after the first 10 months, and the consequences of denying these urges are usually fatal. It had been so long that I figured Malfoy would be crawling out of his skin with the need to carry it on. I was, quite frankly, surprised when he denied and then attacked me once he realized what was truly going on. I didn’t even have time to defend myself. I just didn’t think there would be a need to do so.”
floor of St. Mungo’s is cheery and friendly when Harry approaches her. She seems to recognize him right away, and inquires about Ginny immediately. Harry returns her smile and tells her Ginny is doing well, even though he doesn’t know that for sure, and remembers what a shitty husband he is. She introduces herself as Mary, and asks how she can help him today. Mary has long, strikingly dark curly hair that is pulled back into a messy, low ponytail. Her nails are bright pink and cut short, and she smells of strawberries. Her eyes are light brown, with slight wrinkles at the ends of them made apparent when she smiles. She is thin and short, wearing dark, tall heels that clink harshly on the ground as she walks. Even with the heels her lack of height is quite noticeable. She appears to be in her early 40’s.
“Just give him some time, Harry, he’ll come around.” Hermione whispers in to his ear as they make their best efforts at hugging. Harry feels a startling sensation against his abdomen, of Hermione’s belly twitching and pushing against him. “The baby’s kicking, Harry!” She says happily, grabbing his hand and placing it on the spot. Harry is simultaneously horrified and fascinated. He feels a slight twinge of sadness, at the thought that he may never get to experience this with a partner, but he pushes it down and smiles brightly at Hermione.
He takes a step forward at that, and now the look of worry is unmistakable. I swallow thickly, my heartbeat quickening as he takes yet another step toward me.
“Harry,” he starts, “drop your wand.” Harry forces himself to loosen the hold on the wand squeezed tightly in his grip, trying not to wince at Draco’s authoritative tone of voice. Draco promptly removes the wand from him with his other hand. Harry knows that this is a losing battle. He could never bring himself to fight against Draco, even with the fresh sting of betrayal ringing in his veins. So Harry tries his best to calm down instead. He knows some wandless magic, but even then it’s too risky to try it right now when Draco’s guard is up. Draco is an excellent Auror for a reason.
"Lucius Malfoy was killed in battle. And as for Narcissa, she...well she fought alongside the Aurors. She is alive, although a little banged up, but nothing too serious." She tells me. I blink in surprise. It hurts that father is dead, but the sting is not as bad as I thought it would be. He is the reason my family was caught up in this mess in the first place. He died thinking I was on his side, that I died for his cause. And as for mother...well...that is the last thing I ever would have expected from her.
"No, I haven't been assigned to do that. But I will most likely be part of the attack on Hogwarts. Just remember, Potter, do what you have to when the time comes."
Mochi wanders into the kitchen, meowing softly and jumping on the counter, getting in the way as Draco tries to get the damn toaster oven to at least turn on. "Yes, yes, I get it, you want attention," Draco mumbles, pushing the cat off the counter only to have him jump back up and meow harder. Sighing in defeat, Draco strokes the kitty's soft fur until he is purring like a freight engine. "I wouldn't suppose you know how to use the toaster oven?" He asks. The cat meows softly in return and, satisfied with his morning attentions, jumps off the counter and abandons Draco in the kitchen, leaving him to figure it out on his own. He does eventually get the thing on and throws 4 slices of bread into it, before turning back to finish brewing the coffee.
“Nothing I…just wanted to…” The words die out in his mouth. He is an awful liar, and besides, he can’t hear his own thoughts around his heart’s pounding in his ears. Ginny’s face is beginning to redden with anger as she stares him down unblinkingly.
Malfoy draws nearer, and Harry can smell him. He smells clean, and earthy, with a hint of spice that Harry can't quite place but knows it's uniquely Malfoy's scent because he remembers it from Hogwarts. And he looks...well Harry doesn't want to admit how he looks. Angelic would have been the term he used last night when he was drugged out of his mind. He's wearing makeup again, but it's not as prominent, just a touch of black at the eyes, bringing out the stark contrast of ice grey, and some gloss at the lips. His hair is no longer gelled and glittery, but hangs rather loosely around his chin, framing his face with fine white-blonde strands. And he's got some muscle, but mostly he is tall and lean and has limbs for days. He's dressed in a pair of black tight pants and a black t-shirt with the words "Deja Entendu" written on it. There's a gold stud in his left ear at the helix. He's aged well, and whatever he's done for himself in the muggle world, it seems to suit him. Unlike what Harry's got going on these days, he's sure he looks like a wet puppy in comparison. And he can't imagine what he must smell like, booze and sick, most likely.
“Yes.”
“Well I am not really supposed to be telling anyone this…but since you saw the picture anyways, maybe you can help me. Dresden is the wizard who kidnapped Draco, the one who attacked me yesterday. I can’t seem to find any information on him, though.”
The first thing he does is begins to make the report on the events of yesterday, according to the story that he and Ron came up with.  Ron works for improper use of magic, and was assigned to this case a year ago when it first happened. Their notes need to match, which thankfully, is easy enough given how much time and effort both men have poured into this. Harry feels grateful to his best friend once again. He couldn’t have done this without him.
“Given the damage to your magical core, it may take up to a year for you to fully regain your strength. It will impact all aspects of daily living, including walking, which may require a cane for the first few months. But Mr. Malfoy, you’re very lucky, given the nature of the destruction the spell had caused to the very configuration of your blood. It could have been much worse, but we were able to reverse it completely. Now, the body and magic just need time to fully heal.” She smiles warmly as Draco nods some more. Harry chooses this moment to clear his throat and a run a hand through his wet hair. Silver eyes lock onto his, white teeth sparkling in a dazzling smile that steals Harry’s breath away.
"You definitely shouldn't trust me, Potter, but things will go much more smoothly if you just cooperate. This is what I do, and I can show you proof of that. At least, so you can see that I know what I'm doing. Just let me help you, Potter."
"Oh not only do I have the ability, Malfoy, but I'm a lot more perceptive than you think." His smile is saccharine and I suddenly feel my reserve slipping. "This war, it's made me realize a lot about myself and about what I want..."
He takes a deep breath, pastes a smile on his face, and looks up to meet Draco’s eyes. What he sees there is difficult to make out. Draco looks at him curiously, a slight frown set in his lips, shoulders a bit tensed. This is the one thing Harry was hoping would not happen. Draco seems to neutralize his face then, clears his throat, eyes flickering around the room a bit. It looks as if he is trying to think of something to say. His hands are folded tightly on the table, elbows hanging off of it in the picture of perfect elegance. Harry would have laughed if the circumstances were different.
“Okay,” he says, “I won’t tell anyone.” Draco nods, visibly relaxing.
“Well I just assumed-“
"It's okay, Malfoy," his fingers glide, feather light, up around the side of my jaw and to the back of my neck. I feel his palm flatten on my skin there, as his fingers tangle into my hair. "I like it," he whispers, seconds before crashing his lips into mine.
The rest of the guests filter in slowly, and by the time dinner is ready to be served, the house is full with laughter and cheer, the smell of delicious Christmas dinner, and children getting into all sorts of mischievous adventures. Everyone gathers around the table to eat, and Harry’s heart is full as he marvels at what a wonderful family he has. All of the Weasleys save for Bill are here. Ginny and Dennis sit close to each other, holding hands. Neville and Pansy smile happily, Pansy with her hand on her swollen belly. They are expecting twins, and Neville looks happier than he has ever been. Narcissa sits regally next to Molly and Arthur, having become quite friendly with them as of late.
"Harry..." Ginny's voice is soft as she repeats his name again, but there is a tired and weary edge to it. It's too dark for him to make out her face but he knows she isn't happy. She sits next to him in the bed with her knees drawn up, arms wrapped tightly about them. She rubs sleep from her eyes. She doesn't act concerned, only sighs with little patience.
“Harry?” Draco asks, shuffling slightly under Harry’s heated gaze, “is everything alright?”
“No,” she tells him, looking a bit confused.
Draco pads into his kitchen and grabs a can of cat food from the pantry. He hears the tinkling sound of the bell attached to his cat as the cat meows his way into the kitchen. "Hey, Mochi, sorry I forgot to feed you earlier." Draco says guiltily, stroking the cat's soft fur. The black and white feline purrs in appreciation and meows softly before tucking in to his newly offered meal. Cat now happy, Draco sneaks into the bedroom where Potter's jeans are hanging from a chair. The man is snoring quite loudly, with some soft groaning and whining interspersed between snores. Draco grimaces, remembering what had happened earlier in the evening.
“I don’t know him directly,” Arthur says, “not really, but a long while back, I’m talking maybe when Annie was a few weeks old, he tried to make contact so he could see her. Let’s just say it didn’t go over well.”
"My...my family?" I ask when she doesn't continue speaking. She pauses to look at me. There must be something in my eyes that spurs her on to answer me, although I can tell she is uncomfortable.
“You’re in love with Draco, aren’t you?”
“I just told you I had no idea, Harry. Veritaserum? Is my word not enough? Harry, am I a person of interest in your investigation?” Her words grow louder and more emotional as she speaks, her words coming out a mile per minute.
When there are no more gifts left to open, Harry takes a sweaty hand and pushes his gift over in front of Draco. Draco eyes it with interest before handing Harry his own small, wrapped gift. “You open yours first.” Harry tells him, and Draco nods as he scoops it up with his own hand. Everyone is talking softly to each other as they admire their presents. Harry is so nervous he can barely stand it, but he does his best to put on a brave face as he watches Draco unwrap the gift with cautious care. Draco gasps softly at the golden box revealed from underneath the wrapping paper, and he opens it to reveal a small snitch with zooming wings. He reads the engraved words out loud:
“Thank you,” Harry tells her, padding his way to Draco’s bedside.
“Ready?” Malfoy asks softly, once Harry has stopped packing and begins to zip up his duffel bag. He nods reluctantly, not really wanting to go, but knowing he can’t back down now. He needs to prove not only to Malfoy but more so to himself that he can do this, even though in the back of his mind he’s got a plan for how to cheat his way out of the entire thing. Harry fancies himself a man who plans. He’s got back up plans for his back up plans, although he hasn’t always been this way. It came with his Auror training, where he was taught that the difference between life and death is the ability to always have a plan, to be steps ahead of your perpetrator. And Harry was good at it. Having spent so much time just “winging it,” it felt good to be in control, to map out his every action and relieve the pressures of the unknown. That is, until he met HIM…
"Yes I do, Draco. Don't try to tell me how I feel." It still feels weird to hear him call me by my first name, although I can't quite pin point when exactly he started using it. At any rate, I haven't been able to bring myself to call him Harry. At least not out loud.
Potter's messy pockets turn out to be quite the gold mine of information. In his wallet, Draco finds an ID, with the name Henry Porter (Draco has to snort at this), and an address that Draco recognizes as being in a rather shady part of town. He finds his glasses (still the same broken ones he's always had), some cash, loose change, a grocery reward members card, and a bank card. All pretty standard stuff. Deeper in the pocket is a crumpled letter, which Draco begins to read, but then feels rather guilty about once he is half-way through. So Potter has gone off grid, interesting, but why? There are some crumpled receipts from the grocery store. Potter seems to eat healthy but he buys a lot of alcohol. A small piece of paper with the name Jim and a phone number scribbled on it (Draco raises his eyebrow at this). A few tiny empty baggies, and one tell tale baggie with a single pill that Draco is very familiar with. He immediately takes the pill out of the baggie and tosses it into the garbage disposal, then stuffs Potter's items, including the empty baggies, back into the soggy pockets.
Have I really been so transparent? I steel myself for whatever will follow, as I am too tired to deny him the truth. I feel two fingers, firm and strong, touch my chin. I almost lurch at the touch, forcing myself to meet his gaze.
“Never a dull moment,” he says lightly, “Was there something you needed? Molly won’t be home for a bit.”
. “Fuck! Ginny I-“
(See the end of the chapter for
“I’m listening.” He says genuinely. And Draco sags in relief. He removes the wand from Harry’s throat but keeps it pointed at him. Harry’s heart aches against his better judgment, wanting to wrap Draco in a hug and tell him everything will be okay. He reaches up tentatively to rub the sore spot on his neck, and Draco blanches, looking regretful for a split second before composing himself once again. The pieces come together in Harry’s mind and he is at once relieved and exhilarated.
Harry sucks in a breath at the pleading in Draco’s voice.
I'm not sure how much more time has passed before Potter comes back into my room. He hisses when he sees me. "What have they done to you?" He whispers frantically.
Draco looks at Harry sympathetically before casting a quick Muffliato. “Listen, P-Harry,” Draco says, his voice just barely above a whisper, “I need you to know something. I never stopped thinking about you…I never stopped
Harry thinks a baby may help make him feel anything other than the misery haunting him day to day. He is excited at the idea of making a tiny little human that he can love unconditionally. Someone he can help mold and shape into a proper wizard or witch someday. His mind often drifts off with thoughts of a future daughter or son. But they have been trying for so long, the idea seems almost unreachable. Both have been cleared by mediwitches, and both have used magic to aid in conception, but to no avail. They have been told that these things take time, that there is never any guarantee. Harry and Ginny don't talk about it much, only continue to try month after month.
“The best part? All completely legal and blood free!” Draco jokes, and laughter erupts from around the table. Ron slaps his hand on Draco’s shoulder in a friendly gesture. Harry knows it has taken a lot of healing to get to this point, but Draco can genuinely joke about the past now, and he has graduated from all of his therapies. He still has just the slightest limp, but no longer needs a cane for support, and no other lasting effects. The limp isn’t really noticeable unless someone is paying close attention, however, it’s the bane of Draco’s existence most of the time. Still, that limp pushed Draco to become an amazing Potions Master, so although Harry would never say this to Draco in a million years, he is almost glad for it. Draco has never been happier than when he stands in front of a cauldron that bubbles with potion.
“Kingsley Shacklebolt.” The man says wearily, and then, his eyes connect with Harry’s and he asks, “Why am I the one sitting here? Draco Malfoy is the one who stunned me and tied me to a chair!”
“Well I don’t exactly have any other leads, do I?” He says defensively, shivering against Draco’s withering look. “You know Annie’s been sick, with a-“
“Draco, you should never feel too ashamed to tell me anything. I meant what I said before, I love you and every part of you, cutting included.” Draco blanches slightly, but he relaxes under Harry’s touch. “Call her.” Harry encourages, “she is only here to help.” And Draco merely nods.
“Wow!” Albus marvels.
In the past, Harry was always content to be the one to receive, although there were a few times that Draco did the receiving as well. So his heart beats with nervousness now as he tries to remember how to do it right. He can’t stand the thought of hurting Draco, not after everything he has already been through. But he would never deny the other man his desires. He nods at him, places a small kiss at the corner of his smiling lips, and summons a small bottle of lubricant.
The Head Healer on the 4
Mochi climbs up onto Potter’s lap, earning a surprised and rather delighted expression from the dark haired man. He scratches the feline behind his ears, earning a loud purr as the cat rubs his face into his hands. Draco introduces him as Mochi, and earns himself an almost amazed look from Potter. They chat for a few seconds about the cat, Draco explains how he rescued him as a kitten when he was abandoned in a box on the side of the highway. Apparently muggles do this sort of thing really often, which was a hard thing for Draco when he first learned of it. The momentary distraction ends all too quickly when the cat decides he’s had enough and scampers out into the hallway.
"Don't mention it, really," he answers, and because he can't help himself, he adds, "and for fuck's sake Potter, take out those unnatural contacts and put your glasses on." He hears a slight chuckle at that, as Potter, awkwardly having wrapped himself back up in his blankets and blushing like a school boy, disappears into the bathroom.
“He’s…but wait…” Realization dawns on her eyes, “I had no idea about any of this, you know that, right?” She says, anger returning to her features. She looks affronted.
“We were supposed to go see Annie today.” She whispers, wiping at her cheeks before wrapping her arms around herself. Well fuck, Harry is the worst sodding husband on the entire planet. He’s been so wrapped up in his own shit that he hasn’t stopped to consider that his wife has been going through a lot as well. Annie is Ginny’s best childhood friend. They grew up together. Annie has been sick for a long while, is hospital ridden, something terminal. Harry can’t remember what exactly the illness even is. He hasn’t been to see Annie even once, although Ginny has really been wanting him to lately.
“No problem,” Harry says, “dinner won’t be served until 6 o’clock anyways.”
“We can’t risk it.” Draco says again, “
“I’ve been thinking a lot about this Harry. A mother is what I have wanted to be more than anything in this life. And we both have wanted this for so long. And although I’m still so pissed at you, I know that I won’t always be. I’m more upset that you lied than about anything else. I don’t care that you’re gay. I didn’t tell anyone else about why we divorced because even in my anger, I knew it wasn’t my place.” She pauses for a second to blow her nose on a tissue she has pulled out of her purse.
Thus begins the waiting. Harry refuses to leave Draco’s side for the entirety of the two weeks that it takes Draco to fully heal. Other visitors come and go, and Harry passes the time mainly by reading books to Draco, or catching up with old classmates that come to visit. He is surprised to find that Pansy Parkinson and Neville Longbottom are engaged, but also thrilled for his old friend. Mrs. Malfoy visits frequently. She brings fresh baked bread and cheese for Harry to eat, warm tea for him to drink, and shares stories about Draco’s childhood.
The ride to his home is rather uneventful. Harry spends most of his time going between utterly perplexed and downright impressed that Malfoy can drive a car. He can’t operate a toaster oven but he can somehow drive a car? The wonders never cease. Malfoy is living in muggle America, he has a career and what seems like a life, owns a cat, and can drive a car. It’s almost too surreal. Through the haze of the crippling nausea and headache, Harry devises a plan. The plan should get him through the next 24 hours without a hinge. He fancies himself to be rather clever, and catches himself before a devious smile forms itself on his lips. He chides himself for the situation he was in the night before. He’ll do better moving forward. He certainly won’t be accepting drinks from strangers anymore. But honestly, he will be okay. He just needs some more time away from everything and everyone to gather himself. And even though every inch of his body and soul are screaming at him for a drink or a pill, anything to take the edge off, Harry ignores it and continues with his delusion.
“I’m glad it’s you.” She tells him sincerely. “I spent so much time mourning the loss of my son and now that he’s back….I just want him to be happy, and I think you can give that to him.” Harry’s eyes widen with understanding. He nods, takes her words into consideration, and before he can stop himself he says-
Harry lands clumsily in their living room, Draco hanging heavily onto his side. He has done his best to keep the flat tidy enough to Draco’s standards, although he truthfully spent most of his time by Draco’s side at the hospital. Draco staggers to the couch and gingerly sits down on it. He closes his eyes, letting the cane drop to his side. Harry walks into the kitchen and finds the enchanted tea kettle and two mugs.
"Yeah well, being a hero isn't all it's cracked up to be. It sets the bar really fucking high, you know?" He responds instead, winking at his best friend playfully. Ron chuckles lightly and shakes his head.
Harry sucks in a deep breath. He can literally feel the tension leaving his shoulders. He doesn't feel sorry for what he has done. In fact, he is more satisfied than he has ever been in his life. Even killing Voldemort pales in comparison to this feeling right now. For a brief moment he considers telling Ron about the missing documents. But he isn't sure if that's important, and besides, he just wants this all to be over. No loose ends.
“No it’s fine, let’s just get this over with…please continue.” He grits out, pointing in Shacklebolt’s general direction but still refusing to look at him.
“I’m so sorry, Draco,” Harry starts.
“It doesn’t make sense though. You essentially got away with it, and the oath was fulfilled once Dresden died. You could have destroyed the evidence the moment it became available again. Why were you trying to continue the ritual?” Ron asks, the confusion evident in his voice.
After the war, the wizarding world was left in chaos. Aurors worked tirelessly to wrangle Deatheaters and copycats alike. By the time Harry finally finished his training, he only caught the tail end of all of that. The fun cases, the ones that used to get his blood pumping and adrenaline going, seemed to have died along with his partner. An era of mind numbingly boring peace followed. Apart from the case he had secretly been working on for the past year, Auror work consisted of dealing mainly with petty crimes and corporate greed. As a result, work is agonizingly slow most days. This week was no exception, despite Harry feeling like a rubber band about to snap.
The cottage itself has been heavily warded to the point that it takes Harry a few minutes to actually breach them and make his way inside. It still retains some of its comforting qualities, a small fireplace in the living room, along with a large china cabinet filled with different assortments of crockery, and a quaint little kitchen. But further investigation reveals the darker side of what was going on in that home. The chains that held Draco to the wall in the living room are still in the same exact spot, and some rather sinister supplies lay strewn about in the storage closet: some rope, buckets, and knives are the most visible. Harry finds the large metal tub that Draco described when talking about the little girl who was skinned alive, and it is rusted to the point that the rust reminds Harry of blood, and he dry heaves a bit. He supposes he can question some of the patrons of the muggle village nearby, as perhaps one of them has seen something that could be useful.
“Yes,” Harry responds, doing the same with his own ring, “I’ll marry you too, if you care to know.” This draws a chuckle from the blonde, who grabs Harry’s hand in a vicelike grip and looks at him meaningfully.
Hi lovely people! Sorry for the lengthy time it took to update, there were some things that came up in my life but I should be back on track now. Thanks for reading, and please feel free to let me know what you think!
“No.” He bites down on his tongue so hard that he tastes his own blood.
“Aren’t you going to eat?” She asks suspiciously, before eyeing the food as though he has poisoned it. “What’s going on?” She narrows her eyes at him, dropping her fork with a clink on her plate.
Her words grow louder and angrier as she speaks. Harry tries to get a word in but she waves him off and continues, “Harry, I had to find out from Hermione that you killed a man today. The
“But, I don’t understand…” Harry starts, but stops himself and nods for Draco to continue.
“Draco I-I never knew you felt that way.” Harry says honestly, because he really had no idea. “You seemed to want to keep things a secret just as much as I did…” Harry is absolutely dumbfounded.
I would just like to say thank you to everyone who has read, commented, and given kudos so far.  Only one more chapter to go after this one!
"Alright, Draco, I promise."
about it?”
But he knows there may be a long road ahead of them to ever get to that again. Harry doesn’t have time to dwell on this though, because the next thing he knows Draco is speaking.
"It's none of your business, Malfoy. You've had your fun, now just let me go." Harry says, but the emotion behind it is gone. Part of him wants to just give up and let the world swallow him whole.
“I’ve figured out what the blood spell is called,” Harry says fervently to the Mediwitch on his left, the same one who had treated Draco before. “Sangiunum Purgo.” He tells her. Her face pales and she swallows thickly.
"Okay?" He repeats, dumbfounded.
“No, I can tell you now, at least some of it. I just don’t want this to happen to anyone else,” Draco removes his hands from underneath Harry’s and runs both through his hair many times in rapid succession. When he places his hands at his sides, Harry tries not to think about how much that action hurts.
Once seated, Harry closes his eyes, lets his head sink into his arms and works to slow his breathing. He just needs to calm down. It would be almost impossible for him to have really seen who he thought he just saw in the crowd. He must really be losing it. A gentle tap on his shoulder brings him out of his reverie. Harry looks up into bright green eyes, not too different from his own (when he isn’t wearing color changing contacts, that is). The blonde’s smile is disarming, and Harry feels an overpowering sense of affection for the man as he nods at him and accepts the glass that is being pressed into his hand.
About an hour later, both men are hunched over on opposite ends of the couch, grasping their bellies, caught in the throes of hysterical laughter. The takeout containers lay forgotten on the coffee table. Harry realizes, as the laughter dies down and a comfortable silence begins to settle around them, that now there really is no reason left for him to stay. He is struck by the ease of this afternoon, how seamlessly the men worked together to find solutions, how much fun they’ve had together, and even the simplicity of being able to be on the same page about what to eat. These are things that have never been quite so easy between him and Ginny. He feels Draco’s gaze, heavy and persistent, on the side of his face as he begins to clear his throat.
When he leaves again, the cold emptiness I feel is unbearable.
Ron seems satisfied with this answer. Harry can tell he is very tired, and his shoulders seem to visibly relax.
“I knew I came here for a reason, you fucking genius.” He smiles widely, and Draco returns it tenfold, silver orbs sparkling with purpose. Harry realizes, with a sort of crazed dread, that now there is no reason for him to continue to stick around. But he isn’t ready to leave Draco’s presence. So he scrambles around in his muddled brain to come up with any excuse to stay just a bit longer. “Why don’t we get some takeout and strategize?” He asks dizzily. Draco’s eyes narrow at him, and Harry can see the gears turning. Draco knows that Harry is up to something and that is a terrifying thought. He holds his breath and waits for an answer.
Chapter 4: Another Eternity
doing it to her. Mine was the last face she saw before she died, the face of the man who killed her. He used Cruciatus on her…she was tiny, Potter, and then he used his wand to slice off pieces of her skin, one by one, until she finally bled out. He had her in this giant metal tub, it looked so cold and uncomfortable…” Draco wraps his arms around himself, lowers his head onto his chest, closes his eyes, seemingly caught up in a torrent of pain and memories.
At that moment, Harry thinks, maybe this won't be so bad. He'll just stick it out and prove he doesn't have a problem. Because he doesn't, not really. He's just been going through a bit of a rough patch. But he can stop any time. He just needs a hot shower, some ibuprofen, and a proper breakfast. He'll be out of here in no time. He can thank Malfoy by doing this, show him everything's fine, and be on his way. What could go wrong?
"Maybe you shouldn't laugh right now." I joke. My smile is wide and he returns it in kind. Then his eyes shift over to the Prophet laying on the ground.
His Addams apple bobs as he ponders that information. But still he says nothing.
His notes were always succinct, neat, with the right amount of detail, and always grammatically correct. He was always the one to complete it for them when they were partners, under the guise that Harry was too slow, or not detailed enough, or whatever other excuse. But Harry knew the truth, he just wanted to spare Harry the trouble. He was selfless in small ways like that, ways he would never care to admit to Harry out loud. Unbidden, Harry suddenly remembers the day he and Draco were forced to work together.
“He’s awake,” she starts, and then a worried look crosses over her face, “but he is very confused and disoriented. Tread lightly, Mr. Potter.” Harry only nods, breath hitching at his throat, the thought of getting to look into swirling grey eyes again spurring him forward.
"Draco..." he starts, reaching out for me. I allow him to. His hand lands softly on my knee and he gives me a gentle squeeze.
“Is there anything at all that you can tell me about this blood magic that could help us understand what the ritual might have been?” Harry plunges, full speed ahead.
"Is he...?" I can't even finish the question. The thought is too excruciating.
“You should follow up there before anything else.” Draco says authoritatively. He nods his head enthusiastically, lost in the throes of Auror-hood. “Find out if any of the staff there has seen Dresden or heard from him in any way. I’d think if he was that invested he’d be keeping tabs somehow.” As annoyed as Harry is that Draco is trying to take over the case, he’s loathed to admit that this is brilliant. He’s been so obsessed with the prospect that he would have to question his wife that he didn’t realize he needed to follow up at St. Mungo’s first and foremost. He really misses being Draco’s partner again suddenly, and he actually aches from it. The pain hits like acid in the back of his throat but he swallows it down and turns to face Draco, his face only inches from his.
He sits at the table with his breakfast and forces himself to finish at least half of the meal, despite the way his sour stomach protests or the way the nausea hits him in waves. When he’s had enough, he places the dishes in the sink to pile on top of the others. It hasn’t exactly gotten out of hand, but the dishes have started to pile and there is a slightly unpleasant odor that surrounds the area. Harry scrunches his nose at it before walking back over to his bed. Another mental note to do the laundry at some point, as the bed sheets are starting to smell a bit too. It’s times like these that make him miss the Wizarding world the most, as he could go for a simple cleaning spell right now. Regardless, he feels very tired, and with the pounding head and sour stomach combination making it difficult to stay upright, he decides that now is as good a time as any for a quick cat nap. He pays no mind to the digital clock on his nightstand, the red glaring numbers reading 10:00am.
"What does that mean, Draco? Why are you always so cryptic?" He shakes his head, and I can tell that he knows exactly what I mean.
"If it comes down to it, you'll kill me or let me die to protect our secret." I explain to him slowly, as though he is an idiot, because I can't help my self-destructive behavior. Chalk it up to pride or something, but I have always been this way.
"Good. Your friends stopped by to check on you." He nods.
“Mmm, it’s good.” She says around a mouthful.
“Are you Draco Malfoy’s family?” She asks, but Harry knows that there is no way he can be mistaken as a Malfoy. He looks at her, conveying this with a raised eyebrow. She says nothing, just stares blankly.
The documents. Harry’s heart sinks into his stomach. Of course, Draco was
The efficiency itself is quite modest in size. It’s one whole large room, with a bed, a table, a bathroom, and a small kitchenette inside of it. But that’s all Harry really needs. He’s got a decent sized wardrobe for the few clothes he has brought with him. It’s still an upgrade from when he was a child, having spent so much time in a cupboard. The rather minute size of the apartment is comforting at times, in all honesty. Not a whole lot of upkeep, and the rent is very manageable. All in all, he is happy with it, despite how unsafe others may deem the area.
A soft knock interrupts his train of thought. Harry looks up from his research, sees Ron standing in his doorway. He is clean cut and tall, hair brushed back out of his eyes as he chats with Harry mundanely about things. Harry finds it hard to pay attention. All he can think about is this case and the bomb that Draco dropped on him earlier at lunch.  He wishes for a friend that is outside of their tight inner circle so he could vent to this mystery person every time he has love troubles, judgment free. They compare notes with each other to make sure they are on the same train of thought and Ron is amazed at how deep it all seems to go. Harry chooses not to tell Ron about the documents or Draco’s theory about Dresden having a ministry official as a partner. It hurts Harry to keep things from his best friend, but he also trusts Draco implicitly, so there really was no choice in the matter, at least not for Harry.
“That’s fine, really, go home…and Ron? Thank you, for everything.” Harry pours every ounce of gratitude into his words. His head is still in the clouds and he doesn’t think anything can bring him back down.
“That’s all, Mary, thank you.” Harry begins to gather the bags and toss them back into the shopping cart as Malfoy pays the cashier, an odd look on his face as he nods at her. He clearly wants to say something but doesn’t, much to Harry’s relief. There’s something so grotesquely domestic about the experience that Harry has momentarily forgotten how much excruciating pain he is in as he ponders the thought. If anyone had told him seven years ago that he would one day be grocery shopping in muggle America with Draco Malfoy of all people, he would have sent them straight to St. Mungo’s. He waves goodbye to Mary as they make their way out of the grocery store, and Harry feels so much relief as his lungs fill with the fresh air of the outside and the threat of being found out is fading slowly behind him.
“It’s Kingsley.” Harry finishes Draco’s sentence, watching as the blonde’s beautifully chiseled jaw drops in shock. Harry holds his hands up in surrender. “He came by to talk with you about reinstating you as an Auror, but instead tried to kidnap you. Does that about sum it up?” Draco shuts his jaw with an audible click.
been the most delicious thing he'd ever tasted, because I feel the same way about his.
Just a warning, this is me trying to write a slow burn, which I have never attempted before. Please heed the tags and warnings. Thanks for reading, and feel free to let me know what you think!
By the twelfth night, it finally starts to happen. They are laying on the ground together after another round of mind blowing sex. Harry thinks that maybe, eventually, he could get used to the hard ground in the same way that Draco seems to take comfort in it. Draco turns to Harry thoughtfully, chewing his bottom lip worriedly, and Harry just stares at him openly, trying to remain as approachable as possible.
"I'll make sure that we do go to Hogwarts, and when he comes for me, I'll be ready." He stares grimly toward the distance. I wish so much that it didn’t have to be this way. I want to tell him that I love him and that he’d better be careful.
“That’s good,” Harry starts, “was the donor making deposits into a Gringott’s account?”
I hear him suck in a breath before he pulls me close again. "You are not a monster, do you hear me? You are doing what you have to. Your heart is in the right place. I don't care what you've done. Nothing will be able to change my mind."
“What made you believe he would go with you?” Harry asks. His heart pounds thunderously in his chest, and for a moment he doesn’t want to know what Kingsley will say. There is a part of Harry, deep within him, that worries Draco had something more to do with it all than he ever let on.
“I um…erm….he’s fine. Healer says he could wake at any minute now. Procedure was a huge success.” She smiles at that, and Harry smiles confusedly back. Over at the entrance, Ron continues to stand and stare.
Chapter 7: Epilogue
And just like that, my secrets spill out for all the world to see, one by one. I explain to them why we never told anyone what we were doing, to protect my family at all costs. I tell them each and every bit of information I ever shared with Potter in order to circumvent horrible attacks and minimize damage. I tell them about the things I have been forced to do or turn the other cheek away from. I have hurt people, tortured them, stood aside as innocent victims were tortured and murdered. I beg them to throw me in a cell in Azkaban, it’s what I deserve and more. I beg them to make it look like I died so that the Death Eaters don't catch wind of my betrayal. I stress the importance of this next attack that has been planned, that it could be the end all to this war. It might just be the last chance for Potter to kill Voldemort once and for all because Voldemort plans to actually be present. I stress that if Voldemort finds out that I am alive and being held captive, he will most certainly cancel this attack.
“Alright, Potter, enough of the mushy stuff,” he says, pulling away abruptly and dramatically fluffing their pillows, “Besides, I have a cushioning charm to cast.”
“Harry… do you even remember what we were supposed to do today?” She asks sullenly, backing away from him, fresh tears falling down her cheeks in thick, perfectly round droplets. Harry’s heart sinks into his stomach as he tries desperately to remember just how terribly he has fucked up. He knows it’s not sex – Ginny’s ovulation has already passed. He can’t for the life of him think of anything else.
It’s a good plan, and it worked almost too easily. Kingsley now sits in a daze in the holding cell, with Harry and Ron across from him. He has taken the Veritaserum without a fight. He just looks tired and old, and he shivers pathetically in his seat. Harry feels disgusted and angry. He had trusted this man with all his being. Kingsley was here for him all the time that Harry thought Draco was dead. He watched him grieve, provided comfort when he was in need. And to think that all along he had been involved, possibly the whole reason Draco was taken in the first place, it made Harry’s stomach churn with acid.
“I’ve tried to be there for you, been so supportive, Harry, but you’ve been so distant and self-absorbed. You don’t talk to me anymore and I-I don’t know how much more I can take.” She turns away from him, begins to walk toward their bedroom. Harry runs a hand through his hair.
“Ginny…” Harry says eloquently. Her lips straighten into a thin line. Harry thinks it’s going swimmingly so far. He gives himself a miniature pep talk, things like you can do this, and, you’re a grown man, she’s a small woman, but it’s not helping much. He takes a deep breath, then a sip of his own tea, and yet another deep breath. When he looks into Ginny’s eyes, the anger has been replaced by something much worse: sadness.
"Don't mention it Potter, really." He says, attempting a smile, but really only succeeding in an odd sort of side quirk of his mouth. This is going to be more difficult than he thought. But he knows how to be professional. Treat Potter as another client, he thinks to himself, remain professional. Help him help himself, the sooner that happens, the sooner they can part ways. Potter gives him an odd look at that, but it's clear he is just feeling some discomfort as he winces again, playing with the crusts of the toast left on his plate and controlling his breath so that it comes in slow, even puffs. This must be difficult for the raven haired Gryffindor, to be suffering from withdrawals in the midst of an ex-enemy (Draco's not sure if they might still be enemies, although Potter did speak out for him at the trials, so maybe not? Who’s to say, really?).
Harry wakes himself up to his own screaming, nearly falling off of the couch in the process. He blinks owlishly as he takes a deep breath, fumbling around for his glasses. He has never experienced something like this before, the way one of his most precious memories morphed into his most hated one all in the same dream. Draco being alive must really have fucked with his head, not that he’s complaining. He half expects Ginny to be standing there next to him, as she often is whenever he wakes up in a fit. But she is nowhere to be seen. Serves him right, probably.
“Yeah.” Harry agrees, much too tired and frazzled to fight his best mate on this.
The cold wind whips savagely against my hair and neck. I'm dressed in my full Death Eater attire, complete with mask and hood. I've been assigned, last minute, to scout detail. The Death Eater who should have been here in my place was killed last night during a routine raid for supplies (victims). Voldemort decided it was a sign I was ready for more responsibility. The look on my mother's face was heartbreaking. She and father tried to volunteer to go in my place but I stopped them, telling Voldemort I was so grateful while reassuring my mother it would be okay. I couldn't risk them being hurt or possibly running into Potter. Voldemort's pleased expression was revolting.
"Your Weasel friend paid me a visit." I chuckle with no humor as he rushes to me. "What are you doing here in the light of day, Potter? You're going to get caught." He takes his wand out and with a swish my pain subsides.
"Alright mate, are you ready for this?" Harry wipes the tears furiously from his face and squares his shoulders before turning toward his red headed best friend. Ron stands tall and clean cut in the doorway. He has been instrumental in helping Harry with the “case,” mainly because he is his best friend but also because, in Ron's own words, "the blonde git had really started to grow on me." Harry clears his throat briefly and nods his head.
“Potter? Close your mouth.” Draco drawls, a slight smirk playing at his features.
Potter passed out in his car. Things just got a lot more complicated. Decision made, Draco pulls out of the parking lot and onto the rather empty road. He drives the 15 minutes to his home, and once again finds himself half-dragging, half-carrying an unconscious Harry Potter, this time to his spare bedroom. He removes the cold, wet clothes from Potter carefully, making sure to leave the boxers on, and wraps him tightly in the blankets. The poor git is still looking clammy and shivery.
I knew this would be my fate eventually. I just didn't think it would be so soon. My heart pounds so quickly I think I might faint. He wants to save me, and I want to let him so badly that it fucking hurts me down to my very core.
“I want you inside of me, Harry.” Draco whispers into his ear. Harry pulls back to look into his eyes. All he sees is certainty and trust and so much
He tries for a moment to put himself in Draco’s shoes. He has survived over a year’s worth of magical, physical, and psychological trauma, and almost lost his life for it. He is just trying to get back on his feet. And here comes his lover complicating everything by trying to throw a child into the mix. Rationally, Harry sees how this would be crazy to ask of the blonde, who has already been through so much. But the rest of Harry, the parts that can’t be bothered with rational thought, are screaming inside, pleading with Harry to do something,
Draco takes in a deep breath and peers directly into Harry’s eyes. Harry is afraid of what he sees there, the raw vulnerability of a man who once wore a shielding mask so well. It is honestly terrifying. He worries for a moment that maybe Draco really is broken, and maybe he will never be okay again. There are so many conflicted emotions whirling in his mind, but the most worrying is the intense guilt he feels.
floor right away!” She yells to the other Healer at her side, a tall gentlemen that Harry doesn’t recognize. She turns back to Harry, “Mr. Potter,” she starts apologetically, “we’re going to have to ask that you wait here for now.” She holds onto his shoulder, stopping him from moving forward as other Healers begin to wheel Draco out of sight. “Mr. Malfoy has to undergo an emergency procedure. We will let you know once you can come up and see him.”
