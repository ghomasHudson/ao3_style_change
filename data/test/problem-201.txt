This was possibly one of life's cards, right? The most trusted adult you can count on actually hates you. Okay, Harry did a lot more with a lot less. Even if it is, he knows that Snape will listen to his doubts, even if it was the stupidity and antics of the little celebrity.
"Mudbloods are inferior to purebloods," Malfoy apologized, shrugging. Ron looked annoyed, but nothing more. It is just a term for them.
That is to say, elsewhere, there was another Harry Potter; He did not know if the same as him, dumber, balder, more intelligent ... but that was not what filled his face with life, nor did his eyes dance with joy.
Okay then: grab the letter before anyone else and don't be such an idiot as to open it in front of the Dursleys; go to Diagon Alley the next day and visit the bank, answer the letter, get his school supplies along with the trunk, the uniform ... Damn, he had to get himself some clothes, he was n't going to spend another five years with clothes twice as many. its size. He had to talk to the goblins about the change from galleon to pounds. If you remember correctly, a galleon was equal to seven pounds? Well, you have a lot of questions and you really hope you have all the answers. If you're lucky, your experience negotiating with Griphook will do the trick, although I wish you could speak to anyone but Griphook.
At least for the simple fact of being identical to the Harry Potter of his world - except for the glasses and the hairstyle.
"Why should I care about anything about you, remember me?" Petunia raised an eyebrow and went back to her work, ignoring him.
"I lost my cologne and took some of the other Potter's." I didn't want to smell like you after a workout.
"And now" Harry smiled at the two children and spread his arms, as he had seen Dumbledore do a hundred times, "let's celebrate this new friendship!"
Probably for this reason, the Malfoys were influenced by Harry's ideas, those in which he disapproved of everything related to Voldemort, since anyone could be the next on the list of the most evil wizard in history, even with an unbreakable loyalty that many abject ones had been mentioned.
"I'll do a test run with Mr. Weasley first." McGonagall pointed at Ron and urged him to come closer to her. "All right, now let's see if he hasn't changed his house already."
"I don't even know why I came here," he said dismissively. And since this talk is over, I'm leaving.
Harry felt himself being watched from top to bottom. McGonagall's gaze scanned him so carefully, and he could almost feel the magic registering that there was nothing behind his intentions. And he couldn't blame her, after seeing her for the first time months ago, little by little she had stopped suspecting him.
Harry, of course, wanted to know what was going through Draco's mind, and although he had a small suspicion what caused Draco's recent behavior, he decided not to press, on the contrary, it was convenient for him to start moving his cards. The initial idea was for Draco to slowly get used to his presence, but now he just wanted to invade every one of Draco's thoughts, he needed to replace all his memories with new and more beautiful ones, some where he is a king, and they all surrender to him. tribute to him.
When he saw Voldemort's body completely dissolve and the wind carried the ashes away, Harry ran alongside Draco's evicted body. His face looked gray, stiff, wrinkled ... very contrary to the indescribable beauty of who had become his platonic love. Narcissa, from what she knew, passed away confronting Bellatrix. Lucius stood next to him, simply staring at his son's lifeless body with a pained face.
-Yes Yes. Enough. —Draco enjoyed when Hermione got nervous and began to blush with the effusiveness of whoever was hugging her; it was the effect of the Harry Slytherin.
Well, he wouldn't tell you that, in his universe, he managed to score almost 200 points in less than an hour. Someone please tell Saint Potter - yes, he loved that nickname - that misfits choose many ways to kill time, and one of them is to train until the bones bleed.
"Good, I'll help you." Draco, for the first time in the morning, fixed his gaze on Harry and saw the other almost jump with joy. The faster you go, the sooner I'll have the room to myself again.
I want to thank all those people who read this story from the beginning, I thank from the bottom of my heart all the comments, kudos, favorites, bookmarks, etc., that they dedicated to my first long-fic of this otepé that I love, to all who believed in this premise that I had never read and was born by a fanart that I am in love with, and which soon, I will bring another fic, because I love my Harry Slytherin, it is very cool.
He walked over to Principal McGonagall's office, simply as a formality to advise her that he would advance his plans and leave that night. He reached the statue at the entrance, recited the password, and waited for the wall to open so he could climb up to the address. Behind the desk, the witch was observing some documents on the table, and without saying a word, a magic pen wrote on the parchment that floated near her.
"Redheads, freckles, more children than they can support." Malfoy lifted his nose. Or maybe for being recognized as blood traitors. You decide which one you like best.
"At last wake up, Mr. Potter," Madam Pomfrey said, entering the door, holding a small earthenware mug in her hands. He had us all worried. Here, drink this.
"But Harry," Ron looked at him in alarm, "Slytherin is the house that You-Know-Who was in, and besides, everyone there was Death Eater." It's the house of evil. ”Malfoy scowled at her last statement, but said nothing, seemingly unable to disprove that.
And just as Ollivanders' eyes fell on his forehead, on his still covered scar, Harry decided to step back and speak.
If there was one thing Slytherin excelled at — besides cunning — it was in the loyalty they felt — at least to members of their own household. At an early age, he learned that Hogwarts could be very cruel to those who were selected for the green and silver house; So, thanks to the social harassment they felt, they had little or no regard for students from other houses than their own.
Draco felt tired, annoyed, annoyed and above all confused… he didn't know why he was there, behind a granite pillar near the door of the infirmary, hidden and afraid that someone would recognize him.
"How cruel," Harry said, and although he did an act of drama by bringing his right hand to his heart, he kept smiling. Anyway, this will keep us together for a long time and that's enough for me.
"Why do I have to share a room?" —He questioned more angrily, it really was an invasion of other people's property all that.
There was no Hermione. Pansy did not enroll in Hogwarts, and Blaise lived in England. Nor was Nott, who passed him his homework when he was too busy.
"Are you ready, Draco?" She finished putting on her forearm protectors and asked with a grin from ear to ear in the locker room.
"I don't know why you say it, we're dating right now," he replied sarcastically and the smile was dismissive.
"I'm sorry, anyway." Ron shifted uncomfortably in his place and then reached into his worn jacket, pulling out a fat gray rat that was fast asleep. A strong gust of air burst into the compartment suddenly and it took Harry a second too long to realize it was because of him, and he controlled his magic quickly as he swallowed hard, his throat feeling dry. Ron looked at him with wide, confused eyes. That ... was it you? Are you okay?
When I wrote this chapter, I felt like I wanted to scream with excitement. It's just that Harry G. started working, and honestly, he's too desperate to do things ... it was almost obvious that he was going to tell him that he liked him to see him right away.
And although deep down he was grateful, he could not feel a sincere tranquility, because he was not the one who managed to placate everyone. His presence only diminished the harassment towards Draco at times ... but he never managed to dare to do that.
"No one knew you, I decided to do some research and apparently your parents enrolled you in Dumstrang there," Harry replied. That was the first world I came to, and there was no point in being there.
Harry's tiredness and anger demanded that he leave that place, but his Gryffindor sense — in addition to the streak of self-destructive instincts — forced him to turn around to face the other. Sure, it was him, the lightning-shaped scar on his forehead was very obvious, and he had the same green eyes, but the other one in front of him, exuded all an energy so different from his; not because he was a member of the least loved Hogwarts household - the war and all the years past showed him that not all Gryffindors were noble and brave, and not all Slytherins were treacherous - but because of the tone in which he spoke , the posture when walking and that greedy smile that he showed proudly.
It was incredible and disconcerting to think that, for Harry, a month and a half ago he had seen tired faces and hunched shoulders, and now he was seeing them many years younger, full of life and with bright eyes. It didn't matter who he looked at, or how long it would take, one thing was for sure: Harry would live day after day trying to keep the smell of blood, dust and destruction from his senses, and when he saw his friends, families, teachers , first you will see them preparing for a war, accepting death after a long fight that they would not win, before realizing that no , they were not preparing for a war, but for a quiet school year, for a family dinner or to head to the common room to play explosive snap.
"Well ..." the redhead put Pettigrew back in his jacket, and Harry didn't know whether to thank him or warn him without sounding insane, so he just fell silent as he searched for a topic of conversation, although Ron easily helped him when he returned. to speak-. Don't worry about that, I also have a bad memory with animals, but in my case, it's with spiders. ”Ron visibly shuddered and Harry smiled at him in understanding. They're horrible, insects that shouldn't exist, trust me. ”When Harry didn't say anything else, Ron cleared his throat. So where have you lived and all that? Do you have a magical tutor? What did you say your last name was?
When a door to his right opened, Harry looked in his direction and saw the goblin just urging him closer.
He raised his eyes to the window in front of him and was immersed in the dark blue sky outside. Noticing the time, he decided it was all he could read for that day; he would have to get up early to train on the court a bit before school, as the next game against Ravenclaw was getting dangerously close.
Although there were times when he remembered him and fell a little more into that maelstrom that slowly separated him from sanity.
"Get rid of me for a whole year for the next seven years, and after I finish school, it will be for life." Harry cleared his throat and checked the time on the television news in the living room. I will have to return, in these seven years, for at least two weeks, but I will leave as soon as the deadline is met, and they will not even know that I am here. They will not hear from me at any time, and they will be able to tell the neighbors, if anyone asks, that they couldn't take any more with my horrible behavior and they took me to a reformatory.
It was torture, because they were physically identical to the naked eye; But if he paid a little more attention, the ambitious look in Harry Slytherin's green eyes was his biggest difference and hopefully, he saw him in Salazar's house cape.
His voice was safe, firm ... he did not waver when he told her what he felt because it was born from the bottom of his heart. He couldn't just hold back from expressing all the emotions that evoked in him when he was with Draco.
And it was when he exploded without warning, exhaling a moan that died in his mouth when he felt Harry's lips on hers again, completely melting into the warmth he felt.
He didn't want to push him any more than he already assumed he was, and he understood her reluctance to make contact with him. It would give him time — just a little — to clarify his ideas; although that did not say that he would retire. He would continue to move on Draco's map, stepping into its periphery at intervals, so that he would not conveniently forget what had happened between them.
"How ironic magical life," he commented, looking out the window at the landscape. Blood supremacists call Muggle-born or half-blood Mudbloods, and when they least want to realize it, it's a half-breed along with his Muggle-born mother who destroy one of the most powerful wizards of his time. two other boys, and while Ron smiled a little at him, Malfoy looked uncomfortable. Harry was happy about that, actually. If Malfoy was uncomfortable with the truth, it's because he knew there was something wrong with blood supremacy, and he will use that little doubt to his advantage. I guess blood supremacists are nothing more than a bunch of adults scared of losing to new blood. By the way "Harry stared at Malfoy," never use the term 'Mudblood' in front of me. I don't care if you think that Muggles or Muggle-borns, or half-blood for that matter, are inferior to you; I'm a half-breed, my mother was a Muggle-born, and I know decent Muggles. I don't want you to insult them so lowly by calling them 'Mudblood' or any derogatory term. Please.
But he never imagined an answer like that; Draco was looking at him with a scowl on his lips, and there was something in his eyes that he had never thought to see ...
-Thanks. —Maybe it was because he was feeling overwhelmed, but he wanted to be a little grateful with such a disinterested gesture and he got a reward that he never thought he had.
And even when they were fined for a lot of money and real estate seized by the Ministry, the Malfoy family did not fall into financial ruin; her parents wanted to start a new life in France, and as soon as they finished signing the necessary documents, they packed a few things that they considered essential and left - leaving one of the vaults in Gringotts at their disposal. But he, somehow, wanted to start one from scratch for himself , a new stage where the ideals of his family were not the cornerstone of his philosophy of life, and that, instead, all that would mark a new path to travel. .
"Even so, we had almost the same stitches, Ginny did her best not to leave us behind." Ron took a seat on the bed, trying to modulate his voice.
"Stay away from Malfoy." His voice went from calm, to total fury. He clenched his jaw more than he wanted, but it was either that or start conjuring and then regret it.
And so, after a frankly awkward car ride to the Leaky Cauldron, Harry walked over to the Leaky Cauldron counter and waited patiently for his turn, a little surprised at how many people there were, though after some thought, he remembered that It was the same the ... first time he came. This time, luckily, Hagrid is not screaming his name, his hair was covering his scar very well, and not many people in the place are interested in seeing a child alone in that kind of bar, besides ... Yes, there is the devil's turban. He stopped the weary sigh that almost came out of him and smiled sheepishly as Tom approached.
Going to Diagon Alley will be easy. He will ask Tom if he could open the passage for him and he will just be 'Harry' to everyone but the Bank ... and Ollivanders. Well, two people acknowledging it. Also, he had a month to go shopping, but he would rather go alone this time. He loves Hagrid, really, but the man is not responsible enough to take care of a child. The affection beats in his chest when he remembers the first time he was in the Wizarding World with the half-giant, and no, it is not something he would do again, even if he knows what to do and where to look now. Wait, Hagrid hadn't picked him up on his birthday to take him to the Alley? No, Dumbledore had sent it because the letter had not been answered. Great, now you also have to respond to a magic card without Hedwig. Did Diagon Alley have a mail center? Would the Wizarding World really get to that level of stupidity, not having a mail center?
"My guardians are not exactly fond of ... the Potters." I don't really know much about inheritance, ”he apologized, though the goblin didn't seem impressed. Anyway, I really want to do my school shopping as soon as possible. Maybe we can save the reading of the will for another day?
Oh, Harry was on Privet Drive, in his closet under the stairs, and staring at his body for a few seconds, possibly nine or ten years old.
-Thanks! Harry walked over to Hermione and hugged her tightly, burying his face in the fluffy strands of her auburn hair. You are the smartest girl I know. But don't tell Pansy, I'd kill myself to praise a Gryffindor.
He flew towards them and only managed to see the victorious smile of the other Harry saying three words in a serious and possessive voice.
Unable to lie to him anymore, before starting his final year at Hogwarts, he decided to be frank and tell her his concerns one night in the darkness of his room in Grimmauld Place; he was totally honest about how beautiful it was to be with her, because as time passed, he felt a black mist slowly bubble up inside him, quietly whispering a name and surname that he could not get out of his mind.
He loosened his brightly colored tie a bit, trying to help him breathe better and control himself, but he couldn't, and he felt that if he didn't, he would explode at any moment.
"Knowing that you will stop treating me like a criminal." I want to live in peace for the rest of my time here.
The smell of lavender incense relaxed him, and that was when he remembered that he was playing a Quidditch match, checked himself, and was even still wearing part of his sports uniform, except for the arm and leg protectors.
Eventually, they began to talk about the different realities that existed, Draco was the one who asked the questions, and he dedicated himself to answering all the doubts he had and made jokes about the alternate versions of themselves, especially those that were in some other House other than Slytherin - no one could judge them for it, it was very funny to imagine with the personality of someone in the Hufflepuff house -.
In the three nights since she followed Draco to the infirmary after the Gryffindor game — and watched him sob outside the dungeons for longer than her heart liked — things had changed between them. Usually he and Draco used to talk about a lot of things they had in common because they belonged to the same Slytherin house even when it was not in the same universe, like Professor Snape or the nights of smuggling spree in the dungeons—, they ate mid-range snacks. night while laughing at things that happened throughout the day and even discussing training strategies for the Quidditch team.
"But that can come back," he said nervously. The war is over, we have changed and we can now treat each other with the cordiality that we should always have ...
Perhaps he was the catalyst when he arrived in that world and, in some way, made him see the obvious competition he had and the immediate possibilities of not acting. But let Merlin judge him if that wasn't funny; his heart fluttered at the slight waves of magic that the other Harry released without being aware of it, because it only happened when he saw him or Draco.
"Too elusive," he replied with a chuckle. Sometimes you hold yourself back too much. From the little I have talked to Pansy, Hermione or Blaise, you were very different before the war started; you were too Slytherin ...
And the calm face in front of him, along with the slightly wicked laugh, reminded him that it was all worth it to be there, in that moment.
"About ten o'clock." Harry kept stuffing things into a small portfolio he had for his classes, but he kept looking at it.
Draco didn't answer him, and he didn't press for an answer at the time, either. He tossed a coin into the air, and it hadn't yet fallen to decide what would happen. And, as if the events of the day of the Quidditch game never happened, he and Draco got back that trust and communication that took time to build.
He could perfectly see how Harry Gryffindor's face went from annoyance to disbelief, then serious. It was a very juicy offer, irrefutable of being the other and had given too many hints of his obvious intentions with Draco Malfoy of that world; He could almost see that the other was keeping the victory in his pocket, after all, who had been able to score so many points on his own in a school game?
And although he had in mind that the other Harry was with him most of the time - a minor jealousy inconvenience that he managed to overcome when he had a sexual encounter with Draco - he always tried to be neutral with himself. For the first time, he would try to listen to his reason.
Draco was beginning to believe in that strange Murphy's Law he read in Muggle books in the library. Or, rather, confirm that he was irony embodied in person.
"So Death Eaters are part of this blood supremacy thought?" Both boys nodded silently, and Harry, despite already knowing this information, smirked. It was always going to be fun to hear about how stupid Death Eaters were, chasing blood supremacy and kneeling before a half-breed . Without saying anything more about that, he turned his attention to Malfoy. The term that you use, 'Mudblood', is incredibly disgusting. Are pureblood supremacists using it, too?
"But it wasn't your fault, almost immediately Draco found the snitch and caught it." Hermione put on her conciliatory voice, and scowled at Ron, who just shrugged his shoulders.
Although, it could also represent your home; As captain, he had a duty to strike up a conversation with the Gryffindor Harry and find out how he is doing, exchange a few words and end with a good wish for his speedy recovery.
"Thank you, and goodbye, ma'am." I recognize that you are a good director and teacher, much more than the silly version of you ...
Draco watched Pansy disappear down the library hall. They were the only ones he had left in the whole place with whom he could have a decent conversation, something where they exchanged ideas, ironies, criticism, complicity… they were the only ones whom he could consider friends. He also had his few Quidditch teammates, with whom he trained and enjoyed one of his favorite activities in the world.
He felt slightly nervous at the depth of the other's gaze. And with all that, comfort and confidence still prevailed that little by little, the other won over him.
"I assure you, you won't have any complaints about me," Harry said walking to the closet and hanging the Slytherin cape in its place.
"I have a deal that, if things go according to my plan, it will work out for both of us," Harry said, smiling briefly and avoiding balancing on his feet.
He opened his eyes, and felt his heart race again. The best — or perhaps worst — ideas came when one more was drowning in solitude. Why stay there, lamenting? His answer was within the reach of a book. Although his Draco fled from that world and went with the other Harry, he could search for another Draco to suit him; one who loved only him ...
A few days passed since the arrival of that Harry; And if most of the students did not find it strange to see a version of Harry with Slytherin colors, walking and smiling arrogantly at everyone who looked at him, it was definitely the work of a powerful entity to see how that same Harry Potter always walked, everywhere, alongside Draco Malfoy.
Listen Harry… I'm very happy to see you like this, smiling. You more than anyone deserve happiness. And believe me when I tell you, that I will support you in everything you need. Go get him, and don't let him go until he gives you an answer.
"Unless you have super strength or something." Fred raised his eyebrows. In that case, we will kidnap you and you will be our guinea pig until the end of time.
He had been running away — again — from the Harry Gryffindor since the night of the Quidditch game; and also, he marked a distance with Harry from his house so as not to get more confused than he already was - although this was fiercely shot down the night they shared the most extensive talk he had ever had with the Slytherin version.
As they continued to talk (of simple, easy things, for the sake of not having a completely awkward journey between two so-called strangers), the train had already passed through various fields and forests, and when he thought there were just under three hours to go, Harry looked at toward the compartment door, just as Draco Malfoy passed by, without his two trusted bodyguards. After thinking about it for a second, she got up quickly, surprising Ron, and yanked the door open. Malfoy, who had drifted very little, turned with a frown.
So he decided to go back to his final year at Hogwarts; he wanted to graduate and eventually find some potions course he could take, start his business, and slowly begin to clean up the stained family name he carried. He knew it was easier said than done, but he was very stubborn; It would show the whole world how wrong they were about him.
"Thank you very much." Harry grinned at both of them and then trotted over to the wall, and when he crossed the barrier, the feeling of nostalgia hit him hard.
He ran like a maniac, almost tripping over his own feet. As he got close to the library doors, he saw Draco's silhouette walking in the distance towards the dungeons; for a second, his soul was calmed, more altered again when he remembered that he had not seen him eat since the afternoon snack.
"Right now, if it can be, actually." Harry shrugged at Petunia's gaze. You have denied me too much knowledge about the world that I will be a part of from now on, and I only have a month before classes start to catch up. And "he added when he saw that Petunia seemed to protest," it's less time you'll have me here.
The fury inherent, but suppressed in his being, was released when he heard him speak. And, like when he encountered the Harry Slytherin days ago in the bathroom, formless magic exploded; he was sure that he tried to conjure a repel , but having his instincts unleashed, he collided with the barrier that the other Harry formed and that was what made him lose his balance and fall into the void.
"They told me I should go to Granwoots Bank to exchange the pounds for ... the currency here." I guess that's in that alley, too?
They managed to reach a truce when Draco tripped over a tree root and decided to wait to dry for a while, resuming his route back to the village. Draco started to tell him about how difficult it was to redo the Harry Slytherin diary, and although he showed a disgusted face, he didn't have enough courage to stop him from talking about his alter ego. Sneakingly, he suggested eating and drinking a beer in the little tavern with the dripping cauldron; remodeled after the war, it became an attractive place of entertainment for the young population who used to visit the small town.
Over time he confirmed that Hermione was a very intelligent witch. He had topics of conversation — on an intellectual and magical level — that he didn't find very often, not even with people from his own house; That, together with her arrogance, typical of the title that gave her " The most outstanding witch of her generation ", made the moments they had to spend together enjoyable. Although not enough to, perhaps, continue with that strange truce once they finished that task that McGonagall vehemently entrusted to them.
The sun was beginning to set and the light in the streets was slowly disappearing. The curfew would come soon; Harry didn't want to have problems with McGonagall, much less that Draco had them after all he did to be okay with the headmistress, so he chose to pay the bill and leave the premises for the castle. On the way, Harry saw the other shrink a bit from the cold that was left of the winter and did not hesitate to offer him his sweatshirt; he saw Draco hesitate a bit, but allowed him to place it on his shoulders and thanked him with a nod of his head.
"Not surprising really," Hermione said casually, though she soon regretted saying it, as Ron and Harry's gazes rested on her insistently. He pursed his lips and Harry was about to wand the truth out of him, until he decided to continue. I mean, he told me that, in the other dimension, he was the best hunter at Hogwarts, and even many professional teams wanted to recruit him since he was fourteen years old.
Upon entering, he cast a little privacy spell and walked directly to the sinks to turn on the faucet and drink water to pour it on his face; The cold sensation briefly distracted him from his feeling of anger, and he was grateful that he had the peace of mind for a moment just to know exactly what he was going to do.
"Preserving the purity of the blood is important so that the family name is great and respected, the power of magic is as strong as it was from the beginning," Malfoy said, although he did not sound very convinced, to which Ron scoffed.
Draco is finally going to face Harry! In a non-violent way (I hope). I think with this, Draco is going to know who he wants to be with ... before it's too late.
"Case solved," McGonagall said, walking toward the exit, urging the others to follow. I need to take you to the dungeons and introduce you to your head of house, get you more uniforms, and order your school schedules so you can work on doing your portkey again . It will be a problem to be able to distinguish yourself from the other you ...
"Pass, I need to save my best cards for you to help me in the finals," he replied with a wink. Besides, I have to go back to Blaise, I left him alone in the common room surrounded by pure first graders who have driven him crazy.
Although, when the questions came about who made him feel good, who made his heart beat with glee or with which he felt confident enough to throw himself into the void and trust to be caught ...
He was the one behind Draco's decision. He didn't know how, but it was clear from his cynical acts that he was aware that Draco asked him to stay away, and that scowl on his face was only one of pride and self-reliance.
And it not only boiled down to that, it was what his other self said without any shame - because more than one expressed his concern about why they were together, if he did not know about Draco being an ex Death Eater -, and yelling at all lung, he answered with a smile.
Draco felt a strange twinge inside him, it was his instincts speaking; something was not right. And he always trusted them, so she crawled over his bed, trying to get as far away from him as possible.
He walked until he was in front of the journal that Harry left on the table; He remembered how recently he told him about the mechanism that the diary used, basically, you had to write details about where you wanted to go, but data like Hogwarts or other worlds were not enough, Harry used to write Draco's personality traits, followed by some variant high school like him in a different house or on his family in general to differentiate one world from another. Sure, everything was linear, he couldn't skip one paragraph from another.
With the letter well hidden between his waist and his pants that were held around him by a rope, Harry approached his aunt, taking advantage of the fact that Dudley and Vernon had left. He actually had no way (legal, anyway) to get close to the Leaky Cauldron, and he actually needed to start moving himself.
"We went to McGonagall to see what he would do against the other Harry, because of course he did something to throw you away and hurt you." Harry noticed that Ron was still in his Quidditch uniform, and that most likely he hadn't eaten yet… hence the annoyance he seemed to express in his words.
He begins to think if his 'save-the-people-thing' can be suppressed, and simply ignore the wizarding world and escape to America or Australia as the best plan for his second life chance.
"And you," McGonagall said, looking at the Harry who had the cloak with the Slytherin house crest, "I would like you to explain the reason for your so… unexpected and not so friendly visit."
He barely returned to his room and Draco was no longer in the room; he guessed that, like lately, she was avoiding him. He decided to shower and attend the first class of the day; he would have to skip breakfast and survive on the snacks Pansy gave him. It would be a very tiring day now that she thought about it, because between the classes she had to attend - in which, except for Draco and Hermione, most of them were bullshit - and the creation of the diary - of which it was almost complete - , his time was saturated.
For an instant, everyone shuddered at the harshness with which the Slytherin Harry spoke. He was selfish, and although he did it so that Muggles would not find out about his world, it was very irresponsible in the first place to request his help to create such an artifact, because although it was not entirely wrong to use it - because it was the first of its kind, unless it was known — it led to the use of very ancient magic, difficult to classify whether it was forbidden or not.
With a weary sigh, an appointment for tomorrow after lunch, a thousand pounds in one magic satchel, and a thousand galleons in another, Harry left Gringotts and looked down the busy main street. His stomach clenched from hunger, but he was actually a bit thankful that his body was used to little or no food right now, because the less time he spent in public in the Wizarding World, the more time he could have privacy.
"Mr. Ollivander, I hate to be rude, but I've actually had a very long day and I have to come back soon." Maybe we can ...?
And he had the misfortune to meet Harry Potter who, physically, was similar to him, but they were so different at the same time.
McGonagall left the room, leaving the two of them alone in total silence. Draco had already explained the rules of coexistence at Hogwarts, everything that could or could not be done outside the castle, a brief history of what had happened in that world regarding Voldemort and the obvious discrimination that he would notice regarding the repudiation against Slytherin members.
"Draco?" Harry's husky voice was heard in the distance, almost like a low whisper behind a haze of desire. "What are you…?"
"Great!" Harry exclaimed, and both boys turned to see him with frowns in annoyance and confusion. Harry just smiled at them. It's cool and pure chance so that I have two completely different wizarding families to ask about the wizarding world. Isn't the world a small place? ”He didn't wait for an answer as he addressed Malfoy. So why are Weasleys considered blood traitors?
It was not something sudden, rather, it was a gradual transition; as if the fruit of something he had tried to deny for a long time emerged in him. Yet it felt as natural as breathing.
And then he got lost in the crowd, although he knew exactly where to go: Gringotts. He should talk to some manager or whatever first, he really wanted the power of his key and to know exactly how much money he had. Reaching the large building, he simply continued on until he reached a small line of people in front of the main counter, and waited his turn without looking at anything but the back of the man in front of him. He knew better than to stare at one of the goblins.
He walked back to the dungeons; it was a blessing that everyone was busy with dinner, for he would not have the patience to deal with someone who wanted to ask him about the unfriendly face he carried. When he got to the room he shared with his partner, he collected the few belongings he considered valuable: a photograph he cut out of the school newspaper, just as Slytherin was crowned champion after defeating Gryffindor; He took out of his drawer the Snitch that Draco had given him that day and took in his hand the journal that he would take home.
They both laughed a bit at that joke, since Potter has a bone that has not yet been healed seemed a miracle, because for the last few years, the Golden Boy lived on the border between Quidditch - sport with quite a few unsafe points - and quest to eliminate Voldemort and everything he stood for. Soon the laughter ceased, the silence grew between them, and the awkwardness of an encounter appeared.
He also couldn't be alone in Quidditch because the Harry Slytherin had set out to fill a vacancy as a hunter - and he had to admit they needed a good one - so he was accepted almost unanimously after a brief audition.
He felt his body being shaken. They weren't smooth movements, and maybe they were far from kind… He clenched his jaw, willing not to let his impatience get the better of him this time at least. She continued with her eyes closed and her face buried in her pillow, preferring to smell the mold than face reality in that moment.
"Why do you smell like that?" He really wanted to not sound so gross, but if something characterized him as a Gryffindor, it was saying or doing things before thinking about them.
"Well, we Slytherins take our promises very seriously, but if you need to, we can take an unbreakable oath."
"Nothing?" Ron seemed completely disappointed, and he swallowed his desire to tell her that the situation that for the rest of the wizarding world was a matter of celebration, for him was easily the worst thing that could have happened to him. Ron was eleven years old, he reminded himself, and he had to be grateful that Ron couldn't really see the importance in that matter. After all, no child eleven or younger should see the importance of adult issues.
He regained his courage and approached again, only until the light could shine on him and give him a better view of what was happening at that moment.
"You're right," Harry replied to the accusation to the surprise of Draco, who was still glaring at him. I just ... I wasn't expecting you.
It was a detonation inside him. Something that completely collapsed the invisible barriers that he refused to cross.
Thaks everyone for reading! They are wonderful, for loving this fic baby as much as I did when I wrote it.
"The Death Eaters were the ones who helped You-Know-Who, Harry, who were all Slytherins," Ron repeated slowly, as if Harry hadn't heard him the first time.
Even with Draco they had a strange ritual, because in the month of October, just after entering the school year, he and his best friend had a habit of playing hide and seek, trying to hide from each other, but always trying to find the other. Was there a winner? No, they were doing it just for fun.
-So what? When there are no more completely pureblood families, because it will happen, will they start marrying within their own family to retain power? 'Harry made a disgusted face along with Ron, and saw how uncomfortable Malfoy looked.
He wanted to last longer ... he wanted to prolong that moment for the rest of his life ... but being a person with little experience in sex, he couldn't contain the coming he had when Draco caressed his testicles, pressing his thumb between them.
"And I'm not going to be friends with an idiot Gryffindor, thank you very much," Malfoy replied, taking on a more confident cauldron cake. He frowned, looking at Harry with growing distrust. What House do you think you will go to, Potter?
Draco, Ron, Hermione, Harry… and even the other Harry sighed regretfully at that. They couldn't disprove that this was true, in all the years, whenever tragedy loomed in the wizarding world, the Golden Trio were involved to their noses. And for some reason, Draco — apparently — joined that golden rule in his sixth year.
"How noble of you." McGonagall smiled politely, then undid that smile to stare at him. Now, I want the real reason, Mr. Potter, if you really are Harry Potter. Do not force me to use the Veritaserum .
"How long did you last in each of the universes where you were?" Draco lay down on his bed, being as comfortable as possible.
With a speed worthy of a Quidditch hunter, Harry got up from the table, leaving his plate half eaten and ran out of the room and a desperation that he could not understand rose in him, where did he begin to look for him? He didn't have many options, but all the places were so far apart that he became desperate.
Harry stopped smiling a little, barely showing a small shadow of the happiness he exuded earlier. Slowly, she dropped him back on the floor, and took a step away from him, marking a distance that automatically tormented Draco's calm.
"Mr. Potter, it's a pleasure to finally hear from you," said the goblin, Bustlesong apparently, as Harry settled down. He is supposed to have come ten years ago for the reading of his family's will, but apparently the circumstances were surprising enough to let him pass his absence. Did they tell me you had questions? I have worked with the Potters since Henry Potter, your paternal great-grandfather, was a child.
Draco rolled his eyes at the memory. A small part of his mind did wish he had the possibility of polygamy ... although that would be a very utopian world, and to be honest, he did not feel prepared to be with two Potters at the same time; And of course he agreed with Pansy and Blaise, above all. However, it was difficult for him to be able to unite the scraps of emotions within him.
"I need to keep Mr. Harry closely guarded, I don't want the Ministry to get involved at the moment," McGonagall replied as she conjured more and they settled onto the newly appeared bed. And you are the prefect of the house.
And Draco ran out of there, leaving Harry with the proposal in his mouth and his hand on his heart. He ran until he collapsed near the dungeons, he wanted to calm down a bit before entering the common room, he did not want to risk someone seeing him in that state and starting to pressure him to say what happened.
Kisses with Ginny were good. The caresses were much better ... but whenever he was with her, he felt that something was missing . It was an ephemeral sensation compared to everything that emerged when he was next to her, but he couldn't ignore it; it was a constant reminder that something was wrong.
-I did it. I had to explain again what happened so that she could write it down on a scroll and keep it under lock and key, ”he replied, putting on his Slytherin uniform. By the way, you and Granger will have to help me research local and Muggle books I can get, all about dimensions. I will be able to give some names of course, but I didn't really check much of it ...
His racing heart and trembling hands were unequivocal proof that nervousness was slowly consuming him. He paced back and forth, playing with the edge of the fountain in the center of Hogsmade, and every now and then he squeezed the little package in his trouser bag ... and yet Harry didn't know what else to do. to lessen the anxiety I felt.
He just hoped Ron and Hermione could answer his questions, and if the situation called for it, he would go directly to Percy. Although now that you think about it, it would be a lot quicker to go straight to Percy and ask him for books than to wait for Ron to stop complaining about studies and for Hermione to read the books herself before recommending them, and, Merlin, she loved her best friends. , but he definitely couldn't afford to waste time. The sooner everything about Voldemort is destroyed, the less chance he will have to return in the near future.
"I know how to take care of myself." They taught me martial arts, and my ... magic acts a little ... wrong ... when someone tries to take me by surprise. ”Harry smiled innocently and started walking, almost reaching the main street before turning around and saying hello. waving to the bartender. Thank you!
But there was definitely another Draco out there. Perhaps alone, unaccompanied, feeling that he was missing a Harry.
Although, deep down inside - and she didn't want to accept it at all - she had begun to enjoy the presence of Harry Slytherin. He pronounced himself proud to be friends with Draco, to appreciate him even with the mistakes that more than one already told him —because by that time, all of Hogwarts knew about the visit of that Harry from another world—; and Harry… he wasn't paying attention to anyone but Draco — and McGonagall. In addition, he always had gifts for him at all hours of the day, which included sweets, fruit - green apples in particular -, the odd book of potions that were very difficult to find ... and, above all, the nightly talks that managed to distract him a bit. Of the disastrous life I was living
-Was you?! Draco yelled taking a couple of steps back, a veil of annoyance flashing across his face with a blush.
"Really… you don't give way without profit in return," Pansy replied, without losing the grace of an ambitious girl. Rest assured that you will have them tonight in the common room.
Although the smile of satisfaction that was born in him when the Harry Gryffindor saw him with that air of arrogant puritan, nobody could take it away. Much less the crushing defeat he gave the pompous Gryffindors at Quidditch.
"What happened to the thing about me leaving you alone?" Harry's voice was serious, but not incriminating.
And now he was there, trying to read one of the most coveted manuscripts the Harry of his house had given him without succeeding, and it was a waste. He threw a tempo in front of him and saw that it was nine thirty at night; that day, in particular, had already become eternal.
As he walked down the hallway that led to his bedroom, he remembered that Pansy promised to leave him some sandwiches in exchange for his notes, so he returned to the common room and was surprised to see someone's shadow cast on the fireplace. Few Slytherins returned to Hogwarts. Most of them were new entrants, and so it was strange to see someone in the dungeons when it was dinner time, more specifically in the common room.
"Honestly no," Harry replied, moving closer to Draco, but still not touching him. I just ... I don't want you to disappear ...
It was on a Thursday, two months after the war, that Harry felt an emotion beyond melancholy. The book he picked up for that afternoon was blue and thick paste, the pages seemed to have been treated with feathers, as they were not worn or strange colors, and he could still make out the title of the same engraving with gold right in the center of the cover .
"Wait until you hear me out, I know you'll be interested…" he said and when he saw her paying attention, he continued, "so I bet I'll score more than 150 points on my own before you find the golden snitch." If I don't make it, I won't get involved with Draco anymore.
"Blood supremacy," Ron chimed in, giving Malfoy a dirty look, before looking at Harry as seriously as possible, which was too much actually, as Harry had rarely seen Ron so serious on an issue. -, is a type of thinking among pureblood extremists who believe Muggle-borns or half-bloods are weaker than they are just because they don't come from a purely magical family.
"I don't know, my head hurts a lot," he answered, rubbing his eyes. What happened? I remember playing Quidditch… and from there everything is blank.
He retraced his steps. He had decided to leave on Monday after saying goodbye to the few people he had a friendly relationship with, but it wasn't worth waiting for Draco to say "Goodbye." He did not need to relive again the agony he felt when the Draco of his world passed away in his arms with a goodbye.
Shortly before entering the school, he underwent a magical procedure to remove the dark mark from his arm - even when he was warned that it could have sequelae - because he felt that it was necessary to get rid of it if he wanted to continue; it was painful, not like it had a point of comparison, but I could swear that this was how it was to feel the cruciatus curse and the sectumsempra together, agony inside and out. Fortunately, her advanced knowledge of the dark arts - sponsored by Aunt Bellatrix - was enough to keep her from losing consciousness or going mad.
Thank you all for continuing to read Dark Wishes! I am pleased to announce that we are in the final stretch, since we only have two more chapters and a small epilogue <3 And of course, I have in my heart all the favorites, kudos, reading lists and comments that have made this precious baby that I do with so much love.
It was a wound that burned inside; like the bitter taste of defeat, but as deep as skin that is lacerated by the fire of a curse.
The weeks passed, and he did not come to greet him. He didn't want to take a wrong step, but he wanted all the harassment directed at Draco to stop completely. For this reason, he decided to always be everywhere where the other was; In the large dining room he sat very close to Draco, in the classes they shared, he decided to be at the table behind him, in the hallways, he decided to walk at his own pace so that they would see him near him.
Without thinking, he told Hermione and Ron at breakfast the next day about the note Draco sent him, Saturday's date at Hogsmade and how this was an opportunity he was waiting for, how it was a godsend. Quite contrary to what he thought would happen, Ron looked conflicted, but he told him that he supported him in everything he decided, and even encouraged him to confess his feelings again; instead Hermione, her a gentle look, almost melancholic and only with a small smile on her lips that indicated a remote happiness in her.
"Sure, it won't kill you to return the favor by buying me some sandwiches, right?" Draco said, showing him the scroll that he had already memorized. While he promised to be a better person, that did not include doing charity.
Harry felt the world open a black hole under his feet and suck him up. It was worse than feeling eaten by a Dementor, it was almost as exasperating to see his parents reflected in the mirror of Erised and not be able to hug them.
It might have been a simple question asked by an innocent Ronald Weasley out of curiosity at the time, but the whole room darkened, the office lights flickered and dimmed, and the air coming in through the window seemed colder.
Draco stood in front of the stone that gave access to his house, smiled a little and recited the temporary key.
Harry made himself comfortable on the bed to remain seated. Soon, he saw Ron and Hermione rush in and they ran straight to his bed; Hermione was the one who pounced on him and hugged him; he reciprocated the gesture and Ron just stood next to them on the other side of the bed.
"That's ... amazing." Actually, surprising was that Harry had never thought that there was actually a will from his parents that had to be read. He shook his head and cleared his throat. Actually, right now I just wanted some basic answers about switching from pounds to galleons, what if it was possible that I had my key myself, rather than someone else? From what I know, my guardians are not magical, so only I should have access to it, right?
He was really trying not to get into fights over trifles, but they couldn't force him to call someone differently so soon. It was a complete paradox, how do you call someone who is totally new to you so differently than you usually did?
"What we can know is that you shouldn't be here." McGonagall's voice was serious, and at no point did she lower the wand that pointed every so often at the other Harry. How do we return you to your world?
"Good evening… Harry," he said curtly, but gave him a smile so as not to make Harry feel bad, after all, he was the one with the problem. He was the one who had to figure out what to do with the current situation.
Think of a man dressed from head to toe in black, greasy shoulder length hair, aquiline nose, black eyes that he is really looking into his mind, an annoyed look full of hatred-
But the Harry of that world had to open his big mouth. It didn't take a rocket scientist to figure out what it was that had Draco so confused at the moment — even when something similar had already happened a few weeks ago.
Harry frowned as he remembered the words Hermione said to him in the morning, just as she and Ron escorted him to the doors of Hogwarts at 10am. It wasn't silly, Hermione knew more than she seemed, but that day, she didn't want to think about it too much ...
With each step Harry took, he left a crack in his previous footprint. For some reason, the windows were vibrating and the loose gravel was constantly shaking, making an incessant jingle that only made Harry's headache worse.
Anger consumed him completely. Anger, sadness, revenge for harming a loved one was the main engine for the fight against Voldemort to be final.
"And what am I supposed to gain?" Petunia still wasn't looking at him, but Harry knew she was already interested.
"They can't," Harry from Slytherin replied. When traveling between universes, I fell into a black hole and what I used as a portkey was destroyed by mistake . Then he took out a mock newspaper that was partially destroyed, opened it a little, and many broken leaves fell to the floor.
However, apparently life was still pawned with him, collecting bills that were not his ... or so he wanted to believe not to accept that streak of bad luck, because having a Harry - who was not a Gryffindor - being installed by McGonagall in his room, it was like one of the worst jokes in the world.
"Draco, come out with me," Harry said after taking the last drink from his mug. Draco looked at him with a raised eyebrow, as if he didn't understand his words.
"That's the most sensible thing you've said since I got here," said his counterpart, and walked over to him. I could give up everything I know to be with Draco one more time, what are you willing to do? She looked him up and down and smiled, smug as always. Nothing. Like you have for eight years.
"A chaos, that happened," she replied, leaving her place next to him again to head back to the exit. I will let your friends pass, I think you will feel more comfortable for them to talk to you.
"Honey, if I was you, I'd suggest a threesome," Pansy said, when midnight came and they were alone in the Slytherin common room eating fried foods and drinking some of Nott's smuggled brandy. But it is obvious that neither of them will accept it, because they both want you only for themselves. Draco, the next thing I will tell you will be very Hufflepuff of me, and may Merlin and Morgana forgive me: Until now, you have been divided, you must listen to what your heart tells you and feel what is going on in your mind.
But when Draco approached him the day before after Potions classes and told him that he had to talk to him, his hope increased a couple of points to radically fall into the void after hearing something that left his heart hurt in moments.
He opened the journal to start writing; the first few pages were full of parcel writing for trial-and-error tests at the time of creation and he came to a sheet torn in half, frowning, unable to remember when he did it. He shook his head and slowly, the feather he had hidden in his raincoat began to scribble; little by little the newspaper began to emanate a bright yellow light, almost as warm as a sunset on the beach ...
He wanted to remember what happened after the kiss they shared, but shook his head to better deny the image that appeared in his mind; from just evoking the events of the previous night a little, he felt the warmth of his lips again from the fervent contact; it was enough to evade the other's insistent gaze. He tried to suppress the slight trembling in his mouth and the blush on his face as he looked out the window, hoping, now, to see a sea monster that would scare him away.
He decided to make a stop at the candy store, buying some flavored sweets and ice cream for that hot season that was slowly beginning; spring had come too fast, the endings would soon begin and Harry had every intention of never parting with Draco again. Afterwards, they continued walking to the grounds of the house of screams, stopping to look at the old construction that was seen in the distance.
And as if it were an echo, his voice was the one he least wanted to hear at that moment. He tried to avoid the annoyance caused by the you are instead of you see , since one inferred a certain time, and the other indicated a permanent fact.
In those moments, he was convinced that life had something against him. He had lost his parents at the tender age of one year; Impossible to remember them on his own, there was always someone who told him about them and with all that, he continued to feel empty. Bear living eleven years and summers after that age with relatives who never gave a show of affection. Being teased his early years at Hogwarts by going against Potter nature and belonging to Salazar Slytherin's house.
Not to mention that, even though he was a little shorter, the Harry Potter in front of him had a stocky, worked body ... as if he were the fruit of a lifetime of hard labor.
"None, ma'am." I just want to advance my plans. I hate goodbyes and if I leave on Monday, rest assured that I will break more than three hearts when I leave.
"That's exactly what I mean!" Harry sighed wearily. I am Harry Potter! And what the hell does that mean then? I've lived my whole life with Muggles who didn't like magic, so I've lived my whole life not knowing that I had magic, or that there is a whole world of magic, where apparently I am famous for defeating an evil wizard with problems. of self-esteem by feeling threatened by a silly one-year-old baby. What exactly does the magical world expect of me? There are five or six year olds who are more knowledgeable about magic than I do! Did you know that there are books that tell the story of how I defeated Voldemort? ”Harry took a deep breath before continuing to speak, ignoring the look Ron was giving him. I didn't even know that my parents had died in a war, because my relatives told me that they died drunk in a car accident! And it turns out that they are bloody heroes, and that there were thousands and thousands of people who knew about it, except for me, their son! And what, the wizarding world expects me to come to Hogwarts and become the most capable and powerful wizard that ever lived? Well let me tell you, they are insane. All magicians who believe that, especially adults. I am a boy, I am just Harry, I am not the savior, nor the most powerful, nor anything else that stupid books have said about me. You understand what I'm saying, right?
May the existence of other alternate worlds teach them not to wish for impossible things, for Harry, at some point during his last vacation before returning to class, thought for a few moments how things would be if he had been friends with Draco since first grade.
"You were an idiot with them, I couldn't just stare," he said, shrugging his shoulders and soon he felt his cheeks swell, probably from a spell cast by the other.
"You can try to use it, although to be honest, in my universe I am good at potions, and I discovered a long time ago together with my colleague an antidote so that the effect of the Veritaserum is completely nullified." It's a prototype, we don't know how long the effects will last… so you'll have to take my word for it for now.
"It wasn't the fall," he said, rolling his eyes. I've known this for a long time, before going back to eighth grade. That's why I broke up with Ginny, but she was coward enough ...
A few days after that, his eyes were already used to Draco's silhouette. It barely entered his peripheral vision and had involuntarily already scanned everything within ten feet, detecting some anomaly that he could patch up to make his stay at Hogwarts more bearable.
Harry Slytherin put his hat on the desk and looked at them all smiling. It seemed certain — and even petulant — that this was going to happen.
His voice was different, calmer, more meticulous… a Slytherin posture I hadn't seen in him for some time.
He squeezed his chest, trying to keep his heartbeat from sounding so strong, at least so he could ignore how wonderful it was to feel Harry's rough caresses.
He sighed and continued cooking chicken and potatoes for his uncles, appreciating the chores he once hated when he was (was, is?) A child. Despite being back in his ten-year-old body, Harry felt his magic running through his veins, with all the strength he had since ... before he died, basically. He was sure he was in full control of her, and that there wouldn't be any kind of explosion at any slightest provocation, but whatever accidental magic he didn't let out was piling up and making his skin itch uncomfortably.
He remembered when he caught Draco with the piece of journal sheet he had, and was elated to discover what it contained.
Can you imagine how much I loved writing this scene? It was very beautiful, I had not developed a lime for a long time and I am quite satisfied with the result. Thank you so much for all your nice comments! The votes, the favorites ... all that makes me feel that they love my little baby fic and makes me very happy <3 Thank you for continuing here.
She hid a smile as a group of redheads rushed past her, the woman ordering everyone to hurry before the train left, and she actually did wince when Molly Weasley was talking quite loudly about Muggles and platforms that, for any non-magical beings present at the station who gazed in bewilderment at the peculiar family, did not really exist. She approached shyly behind the matron and almost gasped as she watched the twins wait their turn to walk through the wall after Percy, Ginny clutching her mother's hand as she asked to go to Hogwarts, Ron leading their own cart ... The family really looked good, and definitely not at all tired from a war looming over their heads.
"Oh sure, but he and I are a team," he replied calmly, as if nothing affected him. He does not worry because the hunters, thugs and the guardian do our job. Draco, as captain, knows that he would only have to be the last resort for the match to end.
Harry seldom used that tone of voice with someone other than an enemy. It was the same one he used when Harry from Gryffindor challenged him in the bathroom ... that voice was only to stand up proud as an honorary heir to Salazar, the one who distinguished him and for what everyone called him Emperor ...
He slammed the book shut and ran out of the library to reach the newly built Slytherin common room. He had to do a lot of research, he didn't know how long it would take to realize the crazy idea that shone in his mind like lights in the sky on Saint Patrick's Day. He couldn't really think clearly and ponder if what he would do would be catastrophic, if it would somehow alter the world he lived in; but morality went out the window as soon as he remembered how much he longed to see that smile again.
"You seem to be in an easy position, Potter," he said, adjusting his brown dragon leather gloves that became so special in an instant, as Draco had lent them to him days before, when hers broke in a forced fall while standing. in training-. You are the search engine of your house, you easily earn 150 points; the real protagonists are the hunters, who we tear our lives to constantly score.
“When you are here, you will reign over all who live and move, and you will achieve the highest honors among the immortals. There will forever be a punishment for those who insult you, those who do not try to propitiate themselves with your spirit with sacrifices, celebrating the rites piously and offering you the gifts that are proper to you ”.
"There's no particular reason," he replied, looking down the hall, making sure no one peeked near where they were.
This Harry was surprise after surprise; it felt like slow, but constantly growing a strange, spontaneous, light affection ... almost as natural as breathing. He never really knew what that day would come, the banalities it would tell him, or all the new things it would teach him.
"I suspected it," she whispered with a rueful face. I mean, sometimes he talks in his sleep, and I didn't know if I was hearing well or it was just my imagination.
He enjoyed spending time with Pansy and Blaise between classes and at meals in the Great Hall; but he definitely preferred being with Draco over anyone else.
"I'm an orphan." Harry couldn't help a small laugh when Ron looked at him with a painfully awkward look, opening his mouth to surely apologize, so he shrugged. It's OK do not worry. I've been an orphan for so many years for it to be a painful subject.
"I didn't see a memory to see if what he was telling Draco and me was true," Hermione replied. But as things were today, I don't think it's entirely a lie.
"Hey," Harry said awkwardly. Maybe he didn't think too well ... -. Uhm, I saw you in Madame Malkin the other time and… you… did you seem familiar to me? ”Harry struck himself thirty-seven times mentally. Sincerely .. .—. I am Harry, Harry Potter. You are...?
He wasn't especially prone to pressure. Throughout their coexistence he learned that the Draco of this world, unlike the counterpart of his universe, worked very poorly under pressure; he became insecure, not very calculating and even gloomy; he had to have control in order to think clearly.
He walked down the hall until he reached the common room, filled with such deep green and black… he felt drowning in them, as if being there was something so alien and exciting at the same time. He soon saw Draco standing right in the middle of the place, turning his back completely to where he was standing and slowly approached him.
"I'm not interested in anyone else, it's because I love you that I'm still here," she answered, looking into his eyes. I could give you a kingdom, you could go with me when we get the journal restored. You would no longer be an outcast, you would have the world and myself at your feet.
Harry opened his eyes, barely recognizing the sly voice that answered him. He got up slowly, turning his face, hoping that this was not a lie, much less a sign that he was going crazy again; there, near his feet, was Draco sitting looking uncomfortable, even though he wanted to show one of his haughty looks.
Harry held his breath for a few seconds, feeling his hands sweat slowly; He could almost think he knew why he got there ... but he decided to ignore it. It no longer had a case.
Although Harry did not say a word to him, he did not greet him in the great hall, much less choose him as a classmate in class; but he felt like his eyes were always following him. At times, he felt like prey in the eyes of the predatory Harry.
Coming out of his thoughts, he moved closer to Mrs. Weasley, and mustering up all the shyness that he actually lost a few years ago, he smiled at the woman when their eyes met.
"These last few months have been completely insane." Draco responded by moving a little closer to him, but Harry could feel a wall growing between them again. I wanted to get through this last bloody eighth grade in peace and in return, I received more emotions than I have ever experienced in my entire bloody life.
In addition, he took the opportunity to tell him how the diary worked once it was finished. He wanted to share with Draco, everything that was essential in his life, and that gadget that led to him was one of the most special. Soon, Draco fell asleep in his bed, consumed perhaps by the ravages of stress and the little rest he had seen him take; She made him comfortable on her bed, sheltering him in the silk sheets she had and sat close to him, as much as she could so as not to disturb his sleep, now that she managed to get it.
Regret never hit Harry so hard as it did at that very moment. In truth, he was complaining that he was nobody's hero, but then he goes and tries to help anyone on his way. And Draco damn Malfoy was one of those. Awesome, give Harry an award for being the most selflessly stupid person in the world.
He stepped to the side quickly to avoid being hit by Ron as he looked at the big engine and the platform full of wizards, witches, and students of various ages and Houses. Compared to the first time he arrived, where everything was too much in a short time, things were quiet despite the crowd and noise, the day was sunny and everyone's excitement was almost palpable in the air. He smiled wistfully, although he snapped out of his stupor when Ron moved to his side and, followed by him, Molly looking at him with concern.
"No," Harry replied, and handed him a chocolate frog he had kept, "but do you want a chocolate frog?"
Eventually, that affection for convenience evolved into a real affection; Harry's precarious childhood was starkly contrasted with the life full of opulence and love that Draco had - because his parents probably spoiled him too much, and would not win a father of the year award, but no one could deny that this child grew up in an environment full of love, at least from Narcissa — for this reason, Draco dedicated his entire life to teaching Harry everything he needed to know — even with jokes in between regarding his appearance; and Harry could not refuse to accept all that interest that the other professed towards him.
And even with all the hubbub, laughter, teasing, and beer smuggled into the school, he couldn't help but feel concerned about who the Harry of his world was. He was shocked to see everything up close, the fall was huge, and although news reached him that he was fine, there was something about him that did not allow him to feel comfortable until he saw it.
In front of him was his reflection. Like a mirror, a magic mirror that revealed a very different version of himself.
"Anyway, Ron, we were coming to tell you that we'll go to the middle of the train." The twins looked at their brother, who nodded. Fred continued. It has a giant tarantula, so be careful.
-I just wanted to know how you were. It was a very hard fall, ”she answered quickly, ignoring the slight twinge in her stomach as she felt him close.
Walking around the place, he almost knelt in gratitude when he saw a mail building with owls, close to the apothecary, and he hurried there to send confirmation of his presence at Hogwarts. He guessed he got something right, so Hagrid won't actually be looking for him, since Privet Drive hadn't been invaded by owls or thousands upon thousands of letters. Well, one less problem, there are nine hundred and ninety-nine to solve.
He stretched his arms up, feeling the muscles in his back relax little by little after hours of being in the same position. Hermione did something similar, snapping her fingers one by one and breaking the stiffness in her tired legs from the time they spent sitting.
Time was just a concept that lost its value to them when they were together. The timelessness in which they coexisted was just a product of the magic that seemed to glow between their bodies.
Despair tasted bitter; worse than polyjuice or the screech of a baby mandrake being ripped from your home.
A wave of energy emerged from Harry and spread throughout the site, smashing the windows, dislodging the doors, and fracturing all the porcelain in the sinks and toilets. His face felt numb, his brow furrowed and anger running through his veins in an inhuman way; he thought briefly, that perhaps he had exaggerated his reaction. It was a fact that he was upset ... because he felt in those words an unbreakable truth, something that he had a hard time admitting, the cowardice of not accepting from before that swirl of emotions that Draco Malfoy caused him; He took a deep breath before calming down, but still had a face that evidently betrayed how angry he was.
Harry expected any reaction from Draco; he could tolerate a stabbing hex, or an everte statum like he did in second grade… maybe he would even put up with a sarcastic, self-centered grin like the one he always had before sixth grade.
And with that, Draco watched them walk away towards the kitchen. Outside of the honeyed spectacle he witnessed, many questions ran through his mind that perhaps none of them would answer him, but he had every intention of finding out. Seeing that there was no one around, he approached the entrance of the infirmary and opened it very slowly, avoiding as much as possible any unnecessary noise; He entered and in the distance, he saw Harry's bed being illuminated by a small table candle, enough to indicate where he should walk.
And Harry kissed him. The other's lips moved calmly over his and he didn't know how to respond; It was a light touch, almost soft and comfortable, transmitting in that tremulous caress an infinite affection that he never believed anyone could give him.
Slowly, Harry stopped kissing him gently and the other's teeth snapped shut from moment to moment, biting his lower lip. Draco tried to ignore the storm of sensation that threatened to wash over his mind; he wanted to find out if this was part of a sweet nightmare, a product of his tiredness and lack of food. Until a tingle on her lips brought him back to the present, only to focus his gaze on the emerald gaze that was staring at him.
"Mr. Malfoy, hurry up." I need you to teach him all the house rules, I don't want him to take advantage of something and mention that it didn't exist in his world.
In three days it would be his birthday, and all Harry cared about was trying to grab the Hogwarts letter without his relatives noticing. It wasn't that it was an impossible task, but life (previous ...?) Taught him that it was better to be safe than sorry. And if Harry was making carefully thought out plans for all the scenarios to come, well, he's damn cautious.
They began to talk about things that happened in previous days during classes; about the commotion some students from their grade house down with owl-bought artifacts at Weasley's Wizard Wheezes, how Filch had been angered by how they left Mrs. Norris flustered with such fuss and the look, albeit angry, also resigned from the principal, subtracting 50 points from her house for misconduct and behavior.
Although he was a bit in conflict because he recognized that perhaps, in other circumstances, he would have wanted to meet the Hermione of his world, just to know if it was worth treating and getting involved with her; Because the Hermione of this world was a nice person, they talked a lot when they were together, and it was refreshing to meet someone else who was just as smart as Draco.
He felt himself falling, but he felt no pain. He felt like he was in a boat, so to speak, only the water was beginning to drown him more and more and more, and he felt his lungs melt and his heart begin to beat slower and slower, working to keep the blood going. circulating in vain. All Harry was melting, as he fell like rain in a storm
Harry stopped abruptly where he was. That voice was like hearing himself echoing endlessly outside Hogsmeade, near the screaming house. But she swore he hadn't said those words.
"You don't owe me an explanation, sometimes you do." Harry listened to her, and held her closer than he ever was. It smelled of fresh strawberries with a bit of field and sun; Still, it wasn't enough to make him feel good. He felt like a small child lost in the middle of the sea of new sensations, clinging to the only emotional stability table he knew. Harry, you must do well. You deserve to be happy".
The thud on the back of his neck snapped him out of his thoughts, and he looked at his aunt trying to remember why he was fond enough of her not to lock her and her stupid husband with their silly son in the cupboard. It took him too long to remember a reason not to make them all his slaves, but he still left a neutral mask over his face as his aunt yelled at him to hurry up and ignored the viciously amused look on his cousin's face. .
Clarification, your preferences will not alter the order or the outcome that the story will have, because I am telling you, dear ones, that we are already halfway there and I have already written in a notebook until the epilogue. I hope to have time these days to write the remaining chapters and post them more frequently.
"The Gringotts Bank, and yes," Tom beckoned to him and they both headed towards the back of the bar, Tom pulling out his wand when they reached the brick wall, and Harry grinned. He actually missed the place. I don't remember much the pound prices on galleons, but hope it catches up with you. I'll save you a room. When you finish your shopping, just come back and I'll take you there, will you be okay? '' Tom seemed hesitant to let him go alone, but he hit the pattern on the bricks anyway and the wall swung open, exposing Diagon Alley. He smiled at Harry's astonished gasp.
He clenched his hands in an attempt to control his impulses; he felt hurt, confused, disappointed ... the sadness that inhabited his heart was a prelude, a warning that soon life would slowly drain from his body, much like the day he faced Voldemort and had to die to save his world.
Soon he landed on the hard concrete; He smiled, grateful enough to still feel his entire arm — remembering what a boneless limb looked like is something he vowed never to experience again. He rose in one piece, admiring the dawn that was slowly gaining ground in the morning darkness and, in front of him, the untamed Hogwarts building in the middle; He could barely make out the differences between the building from the last castle to this one he saw in front of his eyes.
Ahhh, how I love all your comments :) They make me smile, and continue this beautiful story that arose thanks to a fanart that I saw between these two Harry's who are stealing our hearts.
He decided to take time to think about what he really wanted. It was more than obvious that he liked both Potter boys, and curiously, for completely different circumstances from each other; the Harry with whom he grew up, meant the constant in his life, he was the one who had seen him in almost all his facets - not to mention the obvious rubbing they made many weeks ago - and therefore, it could be said that he knew him. On the other hand, the Harry Slytherin, the one who came into his life as an intruder three months ago, gave him the stability he so badly needed, he was the carrier of a calming energy, being with him was almost as natural as breathing.
Everyone cheered around him. It felt repulsive; he never wanted to be part of that damn prophecy, he only did it so that there would be a future with the one who now lay without a pulse in his arms.
Well, at least now they did have reasons to deduct points; not that always, the house of Gryffindor received extra points awarded for excuses and very unlikely reasons.
Therefore, seeing Draco from afar kiss the other Harry was worse than a cruciatus ; he experienced, again, one of the bitter tastes of life.
If anyone could hear that, it would be one of the strangest ironies; the stone moved and allowed him to enter. The first step he took was the one that was heaviest, as if he were entering another world very different and very similar to himself. It was no secret that, upon entering Hogwarts, he was almost selected to belong to Slytherin, which is why, sometimes, he wondered what would have happened if he had not insisted to the Sorting Hat not to place him there, how different his life was. wearing green and silver instead of red and yellow.
With Blaise things were different. Contrary to Pansy, he did not tell her details - it would kill him to tell her things about his sex life - he listened carefully to the brief story that he summarized and only received a short sermon from Blaise: «How confused of whom to choose ? It bothers me to admit it, but you have deep feelings for the Harry of Gryffindor since the Triwizard Tournament. Just do that and that's it ».
-Whatever. Draco just nodded reluctantly and sat on his bed and pressed the bridge of his nose; everything that happened that day was too much. He just wanted to go to sleep and make that headache go away.
—His best was 320 points in a school game against Ravenclaw. Apparently the meeting only lasted 3 hours.
He always gave him his space, tried to make him lower his guard, so that he could intervene by making sure that the other took into account his existence, even when there were times when they were not together. The tactic he had planned since he arrived in that universe and saw how things were, was taking a nosedive after almost reaching the cusp.
And without saying goodbye to Hermione, he ran out of the library to go to the owls to send him towards the only person he was interested in seeing at that moment.
—With this diary, it was almost three months of preparations. He believes it with the help of Muggle scientists who were guiding me. They put the ingenuity, I the magic. Harry dropped the journal on the desk, the sound echoing across the room. Eventually I had to obliviate them .
The Slytherin, of course, the Gryffindor had been on the run since that day, when everything got out of hand.
It didn't really matter all the history he had learned, from the earliest records in Ancient Egypt to the beginnings of dark magic and the massive witch hunt of which the Muggles fell victim. For some reason he didn't really want to think too much, the writers of books on the history of the British wizarding world (even the ones he read so far) believed that the unintended adventures of a one-year-old baby with a dark wizard were much more. interesting to fill more than three chapters per book with falsehoods or half-truths and increasingly ridiculous theories, than to explain why dark magic did not work well with certain wizards and worked too well with others, or why even wizards and magicians Muggles did not go to war despite the clear enmity between them, or explain blood supremacy from an objective point of view and not completely despise or praise it, or ...
He opened his eyes for the first time since Draco gave him the blowjob of his life and was delighted to see the instant he swallowed his cum.
If only they knew that what arose two years ago did nothing but grow inside them; like a little flower that, in the midst of adversity, begins to bloom.
He wanted to interrupt them in that instant, separate them, claim Draco as his own and take him away from that place, that world… that Harry.
"Whatever you need, mate," Ron said quite confidently. He took her hand and squeezed it hard. We are best friends, we will always be there for you.
Draco's eyes widened a bit in surprise and he thought for a few seconds how that Harry knew that it was all due to a headache, and also that he knew what his favorite midnight snack is.
-Sorry Sorry. No ... I'm not a rodent lover — especially rodents that are actually Death Eaters hiding like the cowards they are . He smiled forcibly. I'm sorry, really, I won't hurt him or anything, just ... I have a bad memory with some rats and ... You know.
Or at least it had been until the Harry of his world ruined him and now he couldn't even see him without thinking about how he succumbed to his deepest desires.
Harry thanked the taxi driver again when he helped him place his trunk in a wheelbarrow, and after paying for the ride and tipped him for the extra help, he entered King's Cross and walked slowly to platform 9¾. She wasn't going to deny that she felt a little guilty for wanting to run into the Weasley family again, and that she was going to take full advantage of Molly's solidarity to get close to Ron again; at the end of the day, the first time and thanks to being close to Harry, Mr. Weasley was almost killed by Nagini and then Fred had been killed in a battle that if Harry had been a little quicker or a little more knowledgeable could have been avoided . He shouldn't get close to them again, or Hermione for that matter, but he actually realized that he was very selfish and that, as he fought in blood and sweat to kill Voldemort strictly asking for help only when he knew he won't be able to alone, he he deserved to have his best friends by his side, although he greatly wished he wasn't as close to him as last time: he doesn't need to put them in even more danger.
But the Harry Slytherin did not respond to the hint of a fight and relaxed his body slightly, leaning his body in the sink closest to his.
Hermione expressed to him with concern and curiosity, the - not so - recent obsession she felt towards Draco, and Ron reminded her that he looked just as rough as he was at sixteen. At that time, he had the pretext of being suspicious and following him because they were at war and the other had radical ideas, but now ...
"That's where you're wrong." Harry smiled coldly at both of them, even though Malfoy seemed to want to get out of there. The man who betrayed my parents, giving the information of where we were hiding, was a Gryffindor— Harry crossed his arms and controlled his magic. That same man was with them at the time, and Harry's magic wanted to kill him. And when he looked out at the landscape, ending the conversation, Harry thought that the bravest man he ever knew was a Slytherin.
"I don't know, I think there are still bones to break," he commented with a rather serious face that he immediately broke with a smile.
Many times he thought about what it would be like to die: would he feel something? Would it be quick and painless, or will it die slowly and tortuously? When he heard the curse come out of Voldemort's mouth, Harry cast his own killing curse, not bothering to move and accepting his death as easily as he would accept a glass of ice water on a hot summer day.
"Sure." Harry's stomach clenched as he remembered he was about to see Pettigrew, but he kept smiling kindly as Ron settled in. So, Ron, right? I am Harry.
-Can I sit with you? The rest is full. ”Ron's voice snapped him out of his thoughts and he saw the redhead standing in the compartment door, glaring at him shyly. Only then did he realize that the train had already left. Harry smiled at him and pointed to the seat in front of him.
"Well, I can't blame you for everything, I couldn't do much either," Ron said with a small smile and a lot of blush on his face. That Harry is unhinged, how can anyone score so many points alone? He could avoid Jimmy, man, Jimmy! You know he's one of the best punchers and he didn't even get a shot at him.
"Well, it seems he's still in prime condition," Ron replied, perhaps a little afraid that there had been the possibility of moving him so radically.
Harry's eyes were bright, and in them, he saw reflected the desperation and longing that his words lacked. Harry's desire was palpable, as much as the uncontrolled magic that danced between them, but not hurting them; Draco felt heat rising to his cheeks and a buzzing ringing in his ears. He dared to speak so that he could undo the lump that formed in his throat.
After Draco had left him with the confession without answering on the day of the Quidditch game, anxiety and sadness filled his days, believing and firmly thinking that it was all over, that he had been late and that, without a doubt, his Slytherin counterpart had managed to separate him from the only thing that managed to anchor him to the present. So when he received the owl with Draco's message in days past, he felt a sense of elation that he couldn't explain.
"It's for that very reason that supremacy exists, then," Malfoy spoke. If they marry between pure bloods and have offspring, the family will remain pure. If you break that chain, marrying a Muggle or Births with dirty blood , are avoiding the magical power of the family go your way, making weaken or, in the worst case, become extinct.
He sees the tears come out of those eyes, a broken double-sided mask on the ground and blood on his neck ...
"Oh, he was quite nerdy and pathetic," she replied pulling a bag of gummies from her drawer and popped a handful into her mouth. His parents were still alive, and Cho Chang became his girlfriend since the fourth year.
He felt how slowly he began to lose patience with the emotions that emerged from within him. He couldn't control the exaggerated looks — as Ron and Hermione said — that he directed at Draco, nor could he help getting closer and closer to him to smell the peppermint scent coming from the blond. They were impulses that he wished were not so evident, but he finally failed in the attempt, because only in that way could he enliven his soul, at least in those moments.
And so they did, they walked a little through the streets of Hogsmade in silence. It was difficult to break the ice after so many years arguing at the first opportunity, but not impossible once they started discussing Quidditch, how the Slytherin team had improved with Draco as their captain.
Going through his Hogwarts list, he decided to start with the books. Entering Flourish and Blotts, he decides that in addition to the first-year books, he will take the opportunity to buy some about the history of the Wizarding World and some more about defense, enchantments and potions. Snape completely screwed up that matter for him, and it actually all started with three unanswered questions and everything was on the wane from then on. Maybe having the answers could actually make things a little easier this time.
Draco threw a snowball created from his wand at him and Harry met the attack with another. They declared a small war that soon ended with their clothes wet from the melted snow due to the heat.
By dusk, Harry had already gotten his uniforms, some wizard casual wear, and some pants and T-shirts his size. He was terribly tired, both mentally and physically, and he certainly believed that he might pass out at any moment if he didn't eat anything, so he hurried as hard as possible to get to Ollivanders, and thanked Merlin, God, whoever got him into this. Damn again, the store was empty. I couldn't stand any more crowds for today.
Draco couldn't process the information he was hearing, he was totally skeptical when Harry — the one from his world — entered the common room and saw him next to his double. He thought it was a hoax, that one of them was using Polyjuice Potion and it was all a joke. But when the Harry wearing the Slytherin crest approached him and said that he would gladly answer all his questions in front of the school principal, he had to give some credit to what he saw.
Because time kept ticking by, and that afternoon, after months, he and Hermione finished helping Harry Slytherin with the diary.
He knew that if he continued like this, he would end up plummeting toward an uncertain and dark destination for him. The feelings he has for Draco were taking him into a spiral of emotions that descended and rose madly.
Harry opened his eyes and felt a deep headache; It was hard for him to ignore the aching stab a little before he could even straighten up. From experience, he knew that this was because he passed out after a heavy fall; He blinked many times before slightly regaining consciousness and location. She recognized the fluffy bed in the school's nursing room, the sunlight slowly dissipating through the window, giving way to the first navy blue blankets that covered the sky; from what he deduced that it was already night, most likely a few moments before dinner. He looked around and there was no other student or person there, he was alone.
Time passed and the night already haunted him; his gaze was fixed between the hermetically closed door of the infirmary and the bundle of nerves that were his hands. Now that he was alone, he thought about what he would do once he got inside to see how Harry was, because just a couple of days before, he had demanded that she get away from him.
He had already turned around to leave, it was best to control himself at that moment before committing something stupid.
Draco ... never did anything. He neither cast spells, nor insulted them, nor did he cast murderous looks.
He devoted himself to studying, doing his part and thanking every night, because one more day at Hogwarts was one less day left to get out of there. Away from those crazy ideas, escaping from those feelings that were slowly trapping him.
The complicity in which the act was consummated was being shattered when they both heard that voice alien to them. Draco separated from Harry when he heard the footsteps coming dangerously close down the hall; He was surprised to learn that his mind forgot where they were, and that this was not right. He stood up from his place and the two saw each other for a few moments. Draco was contemplating how Harry looked after the incredible blowjob he gave him; Harry was panting like crazy, and his cheeks swirled a reddish color that resembled a couple of apples.
"But that's stupid," Harry said, frowning. I think it is impossible for a complete pureblood to marry another complete pureblood. From what I read, there are few pureblood families left ...
Fuck, he was completely insane. From the moment he realized that he was actually going to live it all over again, from Quirrelord to Sirius and Dumbledore ... Yes, definitely insane.
"Because I know about my parents, about that world, and about the war that killed your sister." Harry internally rejoiced when Petunia froze at his words. I don't care that you lied to me and hated me for something I couldn't even control, but I need your help for… ” first time , she wanted to say, but quickly corrected herself“… one last time: I need you to take me to Charing. Cross so that I can enter, uhm, that world and thus begin my education. I don't need money from you, the school provides everything, or that's what the letter I received this morning says and I 'm not going to give it to you; In case it is not so, I will handle it myself. But I just need that last favor.
Oh ... I wasn't going to be able to buy Hedwig. Even if it's not the first year, not with the Dursleys. He could easily go to Grimmauld Place for years to come, but all he knew so far about the Fidelius was that he needed a Guardian who was truly loyal and not a bloody rat. So no, it wasn't really an option. Besides, he was sure that Kreacher was there and his loyalty, whether the elf liked it or not, was with the Blacks, and not with Harry.
His life turned into chaos recently; Between studying for the EXTASES, the confession he received from Harry of the Gryffindor house, the proposal of Harry from his house, and the intensive research sessions for the diary, he ended up sleeping before nine at night.
At that moment, she decided to see him and could see how a vein on his forehead stood out. Perhaps out of a bit of anger, and it was not for less, that a Slytherin was told that, it was considered almost an offense.
"Vaults?" In the plural? - Well, Harry was a little more surprised now than when he spoke of the will. As far as he knew, he only had Vault 687, which already had a lot of money in it, but if he was lucky and actually had other vaults belonging to the family, maybe there would be something from his parents that he could have. Oh Merlin, that would be great ...
I would see them again, all of them. To his parents, to Sirius, to all those who died without Harry being able to do anything. I would ask their forgiveness, and I would finally rest in peace after seventeen years without rest. The darkness was taking over his soul and mind, and Harry felt himself smile. He certainly wouldn't miss his uncles or cousin, but he wished Hermione and Ron all the luck and happiness, as well as their families. Merlin, the Weasleys were Harry's family from the time he knew them, he greatly hoped they would survive and be able to thrive.
"Didn't you have to go to McGonagall first thing in the morning?" Draco wanted to avoid as much as possible contact with this Harry. Too many things moved inside her to reveal the weakness she felt when he was close to her.
Questions you may never receive a satisfactory answer to # 23: why do wizards have to leave the wizarding world (I highlight 'leave the wizarding world') to the muggle world to ENTER the wizarding world AGAIN (I highlight 'enter the wizarding world again ') to catch the train to Hogwarts? Isn't it easier, I don't know, for each magical family to have some kind of transporter from their homes to the express? Or that the platform had hundreds of chimneys, like the Ministry?
Draco couldn't answer anything, and instead, he stumbled off his bed and grabbed the first change of clothes he found in his closet, walked to the bathroom and slammed the door.
He approached stealthily, he didn't want to scare anyone, and he didn't want to get any unpleasant surprises either. He wanted to tell Pansy and Blaise that their plan to scare him away had utterly failed, but on the contrary, he was almost petrified as the silhouette of the person rose from its place and was right in front of him.
On the other hand, Draco was surprised by the outcome of the events. It was strange how, the day he was least expecting some approach from the Harry of his world, was when it happened, and boy! His legs became a jelly-like mass the more Harry insisted on savoring his mouth as if it were the elixir Felix felicis ; He closed his eyes and tried to keep up with the kiss, biting the lips he had raved about for a long time.
I feel nervous, and well, thanks to all the little people who caught up with all the chapters of the fic.
There where his Draco had him as his best friend and his personality was vibrant and charming, the one he recently met carried a loneliness in his soul that he could feel, and it was a privilege to be there for him, to help him forget what ailed his heart .
-It's not a game! Harry exclaimed in obvious annoyance. I'm being serious about this… with you. I want us to go out.
Merlin bless you, he pleads as he steals some burnt chicken and continues to plan his life with, which Hermione would be very proud of, wit and reason.
"I foolishly followed you here," he said, showing an annoyed face this time. And you deliberately came back here without telling me something.
"How can I help you, little one?" Tom frowned as he looked behind Harry. "Where are your parents?" Are you lost?
—Believe me I won't… I don't have a damn diary, and it's really you who worries me, because you do have one and you left me…
He could count the spasms of Draco's breathing, mesmerized as his chest rose and fell subtly, giving him an almost ethereal, sublime look.
When Harry finished and turned his attention back to Ron, he smiled sheepishly, completely embarrassed by his slight loss of control. Ron had pressed his back against the back of his seat and was staring at him with wide eyes, clearly uncomfortable and not knowing what to say.
As he turned the corner, he found the figure of a Hermione Granger accompanied by Ron Weasley. He wanted to smile at her, hug her, he really had a good friendship with her version of the other world ... but he had to understand that nothing was the same here.
Harry saw his counterpart turn around and walk out the way the door originally was. He exhaled all the contained air, feeling the pressure in his chest decrease; he was feeling tired, and now he would have to go to McGonagall to explain that the boys' bathroom on the third floor needed to be repaired.
He wasn't going to be Draco's best friend, first struck by lightning, really , but Harry would also try to save him and his mother. To his father, if the man shows that he really cares about his family at any time in life and not just when it is the last thing he has left. Thanks to Dumbledore, he actually began to think that not everyone deserves a second chance, but this , all this starting over in a new life and doing things right and knowingly, was a second, maybe a third chance to Harry and the whole damn wizarding world, and possibly he would be a hypocrite if he was able to ignore Draco and close the only window on him when all doors led to certain death.
"Ah, Harry Potter, I figured I was going to see him soon." Ollivander tilted his head slightly to the side, his pale eyes shining brightly. You have your mother's eyes. I think it was yesterday that I saw her, with the stretchy willow wand, ten inches long. Perfect for enchantments. Your father, on the other hand - the old man had a blank look that, if Harry hadn't seen it before, he would surely have flinched - mahogany wand, flexible, ten inches. Little more powerful and fair for transformations. The wands chose the correct wizards, of course. ”Harry almost repeated his words along with the man, but he thought that would actually be a problem, and disrespectful, so he just made his eyes more surprised when he heard them. It is the wand that chooses the wizard, Mr. Potter.
"I've been living in the muggle world since my parents died, ten years or more ago." Harry bit his lip, avoiding flattening his hair over his scar. By the way, you actually know my name for sure. My parents fought alongside yours in the battle against Voldemort.
They took a seat farthest from the entrance, in the remote corner where hardly anyone could see or even recognize them, they ordered a round of beer while they waited for the sandwiches to start eating.
Harry felt that all this was going wonderfully; things were too different from this world and hers. And in all that talk, he saw an advantage and a similarity: here, it was evident that the other he did not get along with Draco - for the simple fact that in that world he stayed in Gryffindor, not to mention the blond's bewildered face when he saw him in the Slytherin common room, quite obviously not expecting it; and the other more significant ...
"Harry told me how he feels about you," Hermione said, breaking into her train of thought. I was really surprised… and now I see that this Harry also has feelings for you.
"Don't promise things that you won't be able to keep." McGonagall smiled. If with a Harry Potter in this life, the things that happened in the world were the most unusual ... he did not want to think what would happen with two. Although this one deserved the benefit of the doubt. After all, he belongs to Slytherin, and they are distinguished by their common sense and cunning. Tomorrow I'll wait for you in my office first thing in the morning to clarify some things, good night.
And as if he had drunk an elixir from Felix Felicis , the Harry with whom he shared a bedroom, he crossed the doorframe and greeted him with a smile on his face.
At the end of class, he did not wait for any of his friends and left the classroom in the direction of the nearest bathrooms. He tried to suppress the anger that ran through his veins as much as he could, but failed in miserable ways as he saw the mess of screams opening on the surface of the newly rebuilt castle.
-Already. It seems that neither you nor I are going to give in on this, right? Draco leaned back against his pillows and looked up at the ceiling. Why better not call you differently?
Starting the Hogwarts grounds, Harry stopped and Draco only stopped a couple of steps later, perhaps not feeling him walk behind him. Her heart beat rapidly, and the anxiety in her body increased her breathing; Like a hurricane about to make landfall in a storm
There was no day that Harry was without Draco. Little by little, with a lot of effort from both of them, they became the best of friends.
"Understood and noted," Harry replied after a few moments, and that emerald glow returned again. He walked to his closet and pulled out one of the Slytherin capes McGonagall had made for him the night before. Come on, get dressed. If we hurry, we can get to the third class.
The sound of a doorknob turning alerted him and he ducked closer to the dark part of the pillar; only half of his face peeked out, seeing the great door open and from there, two people came out together.
In the beginning, the only person who understood him was the Draco with whom he grew up, that pretentious and conceited boy whom he won his heart; his eventual death brought him to the brink of insanity and later, when he thought he would not find someone else, the Draco arrived from whom he slowly came to appreciate him. It hurt to have to leave him, but maybe it was for the best.
Harry watched as Minerva McGonagall pinched the bridge of her nose before looking at them again; his face was totally frowned, it was evident the disgust he felt at that moment. They were all in the most elegant office of the school, it was she who occupied the chair behind the desk of the Headmaster of Hogwarts and at their sides, were the restored portraits of all the previous directors of the school; Apparently, nothing was able to calm that great annoyance that I felt.
And he hadn't realized he was crying until he saw the tears fall on the elegant tailored suit his best friend was wearing. The black, dusty, wet and torn fabric that went with the social wardrobe of a funeral.
—Precisely because I changed, everything I felt for you was in the past. Draco radiated calm with his touch, and for some reason, it didn't reach his heart. I was trapped for many years when you rejected me in first grade, and that's why I couldn't let you go ... and all this that happened made me realize that I shouldn't stay there.
And the only way to know is to have seen it. No one knew those little details about him that Harry from the other world knew so well; He did not know how to feel about it, something similar to affection arose below the annoyance he felt, even understanding and pity, because he vaguely remembered his reaction when the indiscreet Weasley asked him about the Draco of his world and as something very similar to the lust for blood flowed from her magic.
He walked over the scaffolding to Hogwarts, there was only one way to find out if this was the world he came from.
Almost immediately after meeting, Draco approached him that day of September 1 seven years ago making him an offer of friendship; and although at first Harry knew that he was conditioned by seeing the pampered face full of ambition, he did not care much if with it he managed to learn more about that world of magic that was denied him for eleven years.
Those present were amazed at the quick decision the Hat made to assign him to a house. The determination that Harry Slytherin carried was admirable, so much so that the Hat was so blunt in its decision.
He began to follow him, very slowly and at a safe distance so as not to be seen or perceived. It was fortunate that all the students were together in the great hall; That way, he wouldn't have to deprive himself of talking to Draco and exchanging some more furtive glances.
Who was the Harry Gry expected to turn out like this? Slowly, his Slytherin nature was revealed, the one that does not care about anything ... and that is the result.
" Okay, let's go out. See you on the main street in Hogsmade on Saturday at 11am. If you're not at the fountain by that time, I'm leaving. "
He tore a piece off a sheet and wrote a phrase on it — not even knowing if that was going to work — then tucked it into his robe pocket. Afterward, he took a scroll in front of him and wrote:
The sight that greeted him was the cobwebbed stairs he had never missed, and seconds later, the voice of his aunt knocking on the door next to him and yelling at him that it was time to make breakfast.
Harry smirked. The answer was so obvious that it was absurd, but perhaps, it was worth clarifying to Draco how the situation was inside him, exposing himself a little - again - to let the other know his feelings in other words to properly convey his message. He got up from his bed and decided to approach the other, knelt down and raised his hand, until it rested on Draco's neck, feeling the texture of the skin in that area, and allowing himself to be enveloped by the warmth that emanated.
"It is not the house of evil, as such." Who-you-know was there? Yes. Did he do it because he was exclusively evil? No. As I understand it, they place you in one House or another depending on which characteristics are best suited to you, ”he said calmly, catching a chocolate frog in his jump. You are brave? Gryffindor. Are you loyal? Hufflepuff. Are you smarter than average? Ravenclaw. Are you ambitious? Slytherin. I am sure that the Houses of a school of magic do not define good and evil. From my own experience, I could say that good and evil within a person are formed according to their life experiences and perception of the world. So, "he chewed on the chocolate frog's head before speaking again," no. I don't care which house it stays in. I know my parents will be proud of me in any case, as long as I focus on passing subjects. And if they're not proud of me for staying in a house other than Gryffindor, "he shrugged," it's not that I really change anything in me. I mean, they are dead .
And little by little, a cold war against Slytherin began on the part of the other houses; more specifically against Draco Malfoy. They whispered hurtful words to provoke him, sometimes they hid their things from him and even, very covertly and on rare occasions, they had the audacity to push him or put his foot on him so that he would trip.
He didn't say anything on entering, knowing that Mr. Ollivander liked dramatic entrances, so he just waited ...
"Then the sweetest thing I'll say is that you're wonderful." Ron lifted Hermione's hand and kissed it. And that I want to eat a piece of cake.
"How was your herbology session today?" He asked with mock disinterest as he sat on his bed and brought a handful of treats to his mouth.
"Ron's right, Hermione," Harry said resignedly. I had to be focused on catching the snitch, and instead, I was guarding a position that does not belong to me.
I know readers are divided, but I hope you liked the ending. And of course, there is a little epilogue;)
Harry, on the other hand, kept pacing back and forth, looking over the journal. He opened it, wrote things about it without mentioning a word with a conjured pen, and when he saw that there was a flash of light, he closed it immediately.
"Yes, from the beginning the sorting hat placed me in that house," Harry replied, smiling. And Draco couldn't have been of better help in dissuading me from belonging there.
"If it's about being with Draco Malfoy, wouldn't it be easier for one with an easier personality?" Draco asked, almost in a whisper, as if afraid of the answer he would get. Like that Draco Hufflepuff you met before you got here, he was seen to be nicer, or fool, than I am.
He sighed, weary, perhaps a little resigned to the plan he had drawn up and to which he stuck. And although he was thinking of other alternatives - he even contemplated talking with Hermione and Ron more deeply about his feelings, because if they knew something, it was that this new obsession with Draco was not only to keep an eye on him - to, again, get closer to him, he decided that it was time to stop for a moment.
"Really… it's lucky I'm in one room." I never imagined you would feel all that to cross dimensions, it was agonizing, ”Draco said as he hugged his body fully.
The heat increased between them, and Harry, who was too connected at that moment, decided to increase the caresses he gave Draco; He unbuttoned the other's pants in a hurry, and while his mouth was dedicated to kissing and licking Draco's sweat-beaded neck, his restless hands ran over the skin of the other's slim abdomen, quickly sliding their movements towards the penis — already something. hard — that he was trapped in the boxer briefs. He pulled the elastic just enough to be able to lower it and free the member; He turned his gaze downwards for a moment and let out a moan of pleasure as he corroborated that Draco carried perfection everywhere: a nice penis slightly darker than the rest of his body with a pink head stood up and submitted under his caresses.
When many Slytherin students decided not to return to finish their studies, McGonagall decided that each of them could have their own room, or share it with a person if they did not want to be alone. Blaise snored a lot, and he couldn't share a room with Pansy since he was a woman; so Draco decided to have his own space, some rooms where he could feel calm if he wanted to cry in the middle of the night —because he will have a hard face all day, but there were times when he couldn't take it anymore and ended up frustrated in his bed—, or simply wake up reading in the calm of solitude.
Hermione and Draco saw Harry leave the library and until he heard the door close, he let out the air that was contained in his lungs. Relief came to his mind at intervals, thinking about what his life would be from now on; He would have the afternoons free, again the bedroom would be only for him, he would no longer wake up listening to the adventures of a Harry Potter ...
He was greedy. He loved Harry from the other world for all the unconditional affection he gave him from the first moment they met, he went out of his way for him night and day, looking at him with those soft green eyes, giving himself without any hint of shame or shame. Those weeks of living together had given her fun and sincere moments; he was happy and confused, because he knew they would soon finish fixing the diary and that Harry would go away.
"You were looking for the snitch, but the more they scored Slytherin points, the more you seemed ... more distracted."
Harry, never stop looking for me. It was the last he heard from Draco as he fell right in front of him.
Harry's eyes widened when he heard the annoying doorbell he remembered from his uncle's house. He was about to complain, really, Harry was having his moment as he embraced death with open arms, and being interrupted by a memory as strong and annoying as that disturbed him to hell. A damn moment of peace was asking, please.
He turned the yellowed and time-gnawed pages, one by one, tirelessly reading the letters that intertwined one by one, forming sentences, ideas, hypotheses ... and with all that, he continued to miss the memory of Draco more and more; she could still feel him by her side, whispering in the quiet of their shared room under the moonlight streaming through the small window, some paragraph she might have found interesting on her walk through the library.
"I don't have it," Harry shrugged, "but the vault number is 687. If you check whose vault it is, you'll know who I am." However, I would like to speak to a manager, is it possible? I have some questions. Please, ”he added, relieved when the goblin just stared at him and then nodded before leaving. Harry stood still while he waited for the goblin to return.
It was a very unusual scene to see and believe would ever happen. He could see how dimples were framed in that optimistic grin that Harry had on his face. I was betting that couldn't happen in a million years; at least not such a kind act directed toward him. It was no secret - at least for Pansy and Blaise - that Draco was drawn to Harry's green eyes, the emerald that went perfectly with the colors of Slytherin, and that he never tired of looking at whenever he got the chance. .
"It only confirmed a few theories." Harry shrugged, but he was actually telling the truth. There were very few times that Harry had the key to his vault in his previous years, so he thought it was normal, until he found out that Hermione had hers. Galleons can be exchanged for pounds, right? British pounds?
His core of magic vibrated. I had not felt that cramp just above my stomach for months, as if something was compacting and stretching it infinitely at incredible speed; It was very similar to the first few times you appear, feeling your whole body turn into a shapeless jelly-like mass.
As much as he tried to concentrate, he had to reread the previous paragraph because he had not understood anything and despair took hold of him step by step. He really wanted to forget everything that had happened in his life lately and just wanted to study peacefully for his exams and finish that school year with the best grades.
"Draco…" Harry was silent for a few moments that brought him back to reality. Then she heard him take a deep breath and continue— Is there something bothering you lately?
"All I remember is my mother's death." Harry narrowed his eyes when Ron looked at him pityingly, he didn't mean for his statement to come out so gloomy, but he really had no other way of telling it, but as he didn't really want to. talking to it, he took advantage of it. Anyway, how many siblings do you have? They seem like a big family.
"Believe me, as soon as I have it ready, I'll go." The other was unfazed one bit by all the residual magic, one filled with dark energy. But not without taking what is mine .
"You were with the other ... you went out on a date and they kissed." Harry was just whispering, he didn't know how to feel, maybe a little jealousy and doubt, but he definitely won the surprise for having him there in front of him.
He approached with slow steps, wanting to know if the other was awake or not — he wanted it to be the last, he didn't want a head-on encounter; but life is not very friendly to grant his wishes, so Harry's green gaze quickly met his, with enough light to see a glint in them through the glass of his glasses.
