"That name comes up on quite a few of the poisoning incident reports." Harry sighed. "We're getting close now; I can feel it, but it'd be easier if Snakeskin Potions wasn't a shady supplier too."
"Ron has gone," she said. "Do you both want to come back in and I'll let you know what's going on."
"Do you think he's asleep?" asked Hermione, looking uncharacteristically unsure.
To his relief, although he was sore and a little light-headed, he actually felt okay; it was hard to believe the nightmares of delirium were less than 48 hours behind him. Harry was right though; he owed his thanks to Granger and Madam Pomfrey. In fact he guessed he owed them somewhat more than just thanks. It was not a situation he was overly comfortable with, Malfoys preferred to have favours owed to them rather than vice versa, but there wasn't much he could do about it other than adhere to the social niceties and hope a situation would arise in the future to balance the scales.
Malfoy was in the centre of the tap room, surrounded by prostrate and cowering customers and the debris of broken chairs and tables. He was shaking, his gaze fixed on an open door behind the only wizard remaining on his feet, although perhaps saying he was on his feet was an exaggeration, rather he clung to the remnants of the bar, his dirty robe glinting with shattered glass as a puddle of escaped beer grew around his feet.
Potter made a bee-line to the archway on the far side of the main office and followed a curving corridor until he reached a mahogany door that declared 'H Potter' and 'R Weasley' in curling brass letters.
It was dark, the floor hard stone and gritty under his cheek and palms.
Potter, wide-eyed and shocked. Potter, who shouldn't be in the Manor. Potter, who didn't seem to see Greyback closing in on them.
Harry realised he'd been dismissed. Even so he found it impossible to leave the room and transfigured a small table into an armchair. A drink could wait. He lowered himself wearily onto the squashy cushions and watched intently as spells flickered and flowed from the healer's wand.
"I don't think I can go through losing someone else," said Harry, his voice coming out gruff and shaky. He sincerely hoped he wasn't going to cry again.
One scourgify later, Harry stuck his head in the floo and practically begged Hermione to press the Minister for a decision as early as possible.
"I had to be sure," he said simply.
"I'm just saying, mate, it takes a bit of getting used to."
Greyback. Draco felt sick, sure the sound of his own heart would give him away. He tried to breath as lightly as possible, painfully aware that the smell of his perspiration would act like a magnet to the werewolf.
"You can wait here," the elderly volunteer lady told him. "He'll be in x-ray for a while and then they'll make a decision on whether or not to admit him."
"Just try and keep his temperature down, Harry. I'll get Madam Pomfrey to you as soon as possible."
"It'll be better if I tell him, you know that."
"You don't look well, Malfoy. I'll get Madam Pomfrey to see you as soon as she's allowed."
Severus Snape was indeed expecting Draco. A chair had been thoughtfully placed before his portrait and the man himself stood within his frame behind a similar chair, robes cast over one shoulder and an austere expression on his face.
Ron gave a low whistle. "Not like the ferret! Maybe he's trying to repay some of those life debts he owes you?"
"It doesn't really matter what I do or say, does it? They want to see me back in Azkaban and they'll stop at nothing to get me there."
"I hope," he gasped, "...that Snape doesn't have a portrait in here."
"I wasn't sure she'd agree to treat me."
He chewed his lip, considering, weighing up the risks of getting involved in a deal that could be withdrawn at any moment if there was a swing of political power within the Ministry, against the possibility of being allowed to use magic again. There was no choice really, not for a wizard. He sighed.
Harry took it, eyeing him warily.
When Draco opened his eyes his first impression was that it was morning...at last. He took a slow breath of the cool, damp air, feeling the grate of his ribs and finding the taste of blood in his exhalation.
It wasn't Potter, of that much he was sure; he always knew when it was Potter. After all, the Gryffindor had spent years following him around, and the familiar vibration of his magic that announced his presence was individual and unmistakable. It was a vibration he hadn't felt for a long time and had thought he would never feel again, until two days before when he'd suddenly become aware of the familiar ripple trailing behind him.
"Professor Snape," said Potter calmly. He met the dark gaze steadily, walking to stand behind Draco where he laid a hand on his shoulder. A ripple of magic passed between them, warming Draco when he hadn't even realised that he was cold.
So that was why they were there. Draco was grateful to her. It was becoming a habit, he mused, not one he'd ever expected to acquire. He was about to enquire how many premises they intended to search when his thoughts were interrupted by a crackle of sparks, the sound of Weasley shouting and the crack of apparition. A bulldog patronus skimmed past his leg and hurtled out of sight.
"Shall we get on then?"
"I owe you an apology," blurted Harry, with Gryffindor honesty.
"Your training is the reason you survived Azkaban; it's the reason you survived the Dark Lord." Snape sighed. "The reason behind the training was deeply flawed, but that does not make the lessons themselves any less valuable. You need your wits about you now more than ever."
Much later, when they were dressed and ready to leave the office, Malfoy pulled him in for a lingering kiss.
Harry, safely esconsed in an archway behind a concealment charm, watched Malfoy approach. He would have preferred it if they'd been able to work together, but could see the merits in a solo approach to the more undesirable establishments. It was just that the other man seemed so on edge, although that was understandable, bearing in mind his recent ostracisation from the wizarding world. It didn't look as though his nerves had settled in the time they'd been apart.
In response, Granger's otter patronus leaped past him, dissipating the remnants of the spectral bulldog as it did so. She approached him then, turning him gently with a hand on his arm. He felt her fingers run across the back of his jacket and heard the frown in her voice.
"Potter!"
It was strangely peaceful, sitting on the bench in the dappled shade, feet planted firmly on the floor in front of him and an inoffensive expression on the pugnacious face that was not his own. I'm hiding in plain sight, thought Harry with a little huff of amusement, his glamoured fingers curled squat and hairy on the muggle newspaper resting on his lap and his memories winding back to countless daring exploits when he was anything but in plain sight, unseen beneath his invisibility cloak back in the days of Hogwarts and Voldemort.
"Yeah, sorry, I was..."
"And this is?" He drawled.
"I'm fine, Granger."
Cont...
"Malfoy didn't do anything."
"Thanks."
"Look Harry, I know you feel sort of responsible for Malfoy, but you can't forget he's still the same lying git he always was!"
"Give him this...and this!"
Malfoy's teeth chattered, his fingers transferring their grip to Harry's forearm, where they danced like small flames against his skin as tremors wracked Malfoy's frame.
In an odd sort of way it was nice, that close physical contact with another human being, even if it was Draco Malfoy. It made Harry realise that since he'd split with Ginny there hadn't been much in the way of physical contact, other than the odd hug from Hermione or Luna or back slap from Ron and, well, one or two brief encounters of another nature. He'd felt too emotionally bruised to even consider expanding his existing circle of friends let alone anything else. So yes, it was odd but nice, this contact that would not have occurred under any other circumstance.
The warmth of the shoulder slap and grin Potter directed at his best friend pulled unexpectedly at Draco's emotions, bringing a slow trickle of regret for what might have been if his life had been different, mixed with a hint of jealousy and a hefty dose of resignation. He sighed and raised a laconic eyebrow.
"You mentioned a deal?"
"Hot, Malfoy."
"It does if the supply is being poisoned by a rival supplier. A bad reputation travels fast whether you're legal or illegal. Customers soon find another source."
Potter stared back at him, clearly frustrated. He dragged a hand through his hair with a sigh. "We'll move on then. If you're sure?"
The inadequate little word seemed to hover in the large room, floating with the grey dust motes stirred up by the energetic spell work. Azkaban. No doubt the source of at least some of Malfoy's nightmares.
When Harry pushed his way back through the door, a steaming mug of tea in each hand and a packet of chocolate digestive biscuits floating behind him, he saw an unmistakable look of relief pass over Malfoy's face before his features settled back into their current drawn expression.
Harry's hand was dislodged and it slipped across the smooth skin of Malfoy's stomach and dropped onto the sheet between them. He considered and regretfully rejected the idea of replacing it.
"Does this mean you're taking a chance," he asked quietly.
"Actually, it's very good. I'm just not hungry right now."
"The kettle's just boiled." He said awkwardly. "Try a cup of tea first."
Malfoy's face went very still.
Too close to cast, Draco twisted and punched Romani in the face with all his strength. The wizard fell backwards to the floor, kicking out and causing Draco to stagger in Potter's direction, then Romani rolled and came up to his feet with blue lightning streaking from his wand. Draco raised his hand to cast another "Protego" over Potter, realised it was too late and with no idea why he did it, stepped in front of the curse. It hit him between the shoulder blades with an icy thud similar to being struck by a giant snowball.
"A relief to us all," noted Draco in a rather snotty manner.
Malfoy pulled off, looking at him with a considering gaze as the air settled icily around the places where his warm mouth had been. His lips were wet and shiny and Harry made an embarrassing mewling sound at the sight, unable to stop the instinctive rise of his hips.
Harry gritted his teeth, thinking The Daily Prophet would have a field day if he was finished by a magical tornado created by Draco Malfoy; he didn't think Malfoy would have much chance of surviving the incident, regardless of whether or not he survived the tornado. He gathered his reserves with determination and threw everything he had at the funnel. It staggered in mid-air, slowed, and finally began to sink, until it reformed as a harmless, burnt-orange chair.
To say Draco retreated in haste would be an understatement. For someone who'd spent his life behind a false front since his formulative years, to be suddenly so exposed was a deeply unnerving experience.
"Can't wait to get out of the office to be honest, mate."
When he opened them, Malfoy smirked at him and flexed his hips tantalisingly before raising one of his legs over Harry's shoulder and guiding Harry to his entrance. Harry whined helplessly, his hips moving of their own accord as the urge to mate with the man beneath him became overwhelming. He forced his way slowly into the ring of hot muscle, then deeper through further resistance until he was fully sheathed and Malfoy's lips were parted, a pink flush on his cheeks and his cock hard and weeping between them.
"Ah, Potter. Still sneaking about I see. You always did have deplorable manners."
He rushed out of the lift as soon as it stopped, bursting into the aurors' office to be met with a hushed silence that warned him Robards was not far away. Sure enough, seconds later, the man's voice boomed overhead.
"Draco. Draco...come on, darling. You need to get up now."
"I'm sorry," he repeated, feeling rather lame. "I didn't think."
(See the end of the chapter for
And Harry did, hips thrusting upwards jerkily as he emptied himself in searing spasms.
"As well as can be expected. His physical injuries should heal completely within the next week, but he must take it easy." Madam Pomfrey regarded him sternly. "I must insist on bed rest for at least two days."
The office was surprisingly empty, containing two dark wooden desks piled high with scrolls and boxes, a chair behind each desk and two uncomfortable looking hard chairs, presumably intended to discourage visitors from over-staying their welcome.
"So?" Malfoy's cheeks warmed.
"Do you agree? To the conditions? I have the fine details written down."
"It's alright," Malfoy bit out, turning around sharply. "Just a bit of a misunderstanding."
"Harry."
Ranworth nodded. "Good places to find customers for something illegal."
"Malfoy..."
"I don't think I'll say anything to Ron, not yet. You know how he is."
Potter scowled at him. "Lifts, Malfoy. Before this crowd gets ugly."
"There wasn't any point buying much. No magic, remember? But there was one thing." He turned to face Harry. "Lethe River Water."
"You gave a bloody good impression of it," said Harry angrily.
Potter huffed a laugh, soft against Draco's throat, fingers busy with belt and button.
Harry nodded mutely, confused as to why his throat was suddenly tight and his eyes burning. Madam Pomfrey's grip tightened.
Potter went without looking back and Draco nodded, stepping carefully past Hermione. He sank gratefully into a chair, rubbing his fingers over his throbbing forehead. His headache was much worse and the dim lamps in the kitchen seemed brighter than before, their yellow light surrounded by a feverish glow that quivered in time with his pulse.
Harry frowned, struggling to regain a sense of professional detachment. It had always been difficult to remain detached where Malfoy was concerned and this was not the meeting he had envisaged.
Draco took a look around, briefly entertaining the idea of simply apparating as far away as possible. Then he shook himself, took a deep breath and followed the others.
Something of Harry's trepidation must have shown on his face because Madam Pomfrey laid a hand on his arm.
The room was dim and quiet but for the sound of the birds' dawn chorus. Oddly comforted by the feel of Malfoy's hand in his own, Harry's head began to nod and it wasn't long before exhaustion pulled him down into fitful dreams.
Harry frowned; it wasn't the answer he'd been expecting. Malfoy's eyes narrowed.
Potter. Slipping silently into the room. Draco started with shock.
"It must be quite a bind, having to save everyone all the time."
"I don't get it. Why would you give me Romani's name if you knew it'd incriminate you?"
There was a group of people waiting for them outside a second warehouse. Draco observed the muggle policeman with surprise, then noted the presence of Granger with a sheaf of papers she appeared to be serving on an irate-looking man in a cheap suit.
Harry snorted. "Yeah, 'cos we're always polite to each other."
"I know." Ron sighed, resigned. "Probably best if I keep my distance though. But if you need me, I'm here."
"Yes, there, " he whispered.
A long suppressed hurt and anger bubbled up and boiled over, taking him quite by surprise and Harry clenched his fists involuntarily, torn between rage, bemusement that he still felt that way when so many other, bigger things had happened in the intervening years, and an overpowering irritation that despite everything at least part of him still wanted to snog the face off Malfoy.
They ducked into a quiet corner just before they reached The Leaky Cauldron where Potter cast a hasty but powerful glamour that left Draco with brown hair, glasses and a light beard.
She looked momentarily surprised, then nodded.
Potter's pupils were huge and dark and his gaze was fixed on Draco's face as the tip of his tongue came out and dragged slowly across his bottom lip.
"Really Potter, did you listen to Snape at all? Oil of Quintessence is the extract of poisonous plants. Its extremely difficult to prepare and a tiny drop can be fatal."
"What's going on?"
"No." Harry protested. "It's not that. They won't all like it, but they'll get used to the idea...it might take a while, but they will."
"Do you want me to ask for another room' til we're done?" Potter sounded resigned and actually started shuffling scrolls around as though he was planning to move there and then.
"To be quite honest, it's probably just what I need."
Malfoy nodded. Harry was rigid, his balls clenching in anticipation as Malfoy slowly positioned himself and then lowered himself until Harry was nudging against his entrance.
"What's this prat doing here? Why is Malfoy in your kitchen?"
"What...Where did he go?"
Before his eyes the chair was transfigured into a potted plant, a plate of spaghetti and then an angry cat that spat and clawed at them. Malfoy cast spell after spell, multi-coloured energy crackling around his tall figure as he scribed elegant movements with his hands. Harry thought it just might be the hottest thing he'd ever seen.
"That stuff, as you so eloquently put it, keeps the wheels of power turning. Never underestimate it."
Shaking with anxiety, Harry apparated back to Grimmauld Place and flooed to the Ministry. He stormed towards his office with such a scowl on his face that no-one spoke to him and a nervous-looking witch in the lift actually tucked herself into one corner and pretended to be reading The Daily Prophet, even though she was holding it upside down.
The energy streamed around them and Malfoy made a surprised sound of pleasure as Harry pulled him closer still, moving his hands down to gently massage Malfoy's arse.
"Merlin!"
"It's okay." Harry pushed his glasses further up his nose. "It's not your fault." He considered accioing a blanket but decided it wasn't worth the risk. "I'll get you some blankets."
"You need to let go of him, so we can levitate him to a suitable place for Madam Pomfrey to work."
The long, elegant corridor of Malfoy Manor faded away and Draco found himself staring over Potter's shoulder at the landing in Grimmauld Place, the top of the steep staircase a mere step away. He stood, shaking, his chin hard against Potter's collarbone and the thumping of the other man's heart knocking against his ribs.
"Mmm. Well, I'd better get back. I'll let them know you'll be in tomorrow morning."
"I'm quite capable of getting in trouble all by myself. Made rather a habit of it actually."
Harry scowled at him and didn't bother respond. Instead he gestured to the door to Detention Cell 1. Malfoy took a quick look inside and shook his head. It was the same in Cells 2, 3 and 4. None of the occupants spoke and none of them appeared to realise they were in the presence of the wizard who had blown their pub apart mere hours before. Harry deduced that the character who'd been able to smell his way past Malfoy's glamour was not in custody.
"I didn't know," he said, feeling rather lame.
Potter met his gaze. "Potion smuggling."
Granger sounded unsure, maybe even concerned, looking quickly over at him as she checked the wizards and witch were all securely bound and immobilised.
(See the end of the chapter for
"So," he said, gripping his hands firmly together to still their shaking. "What precisely do you want me to do?"
Harry swallowed. "I know. It's just sometimes I find it hard to remember that. We hated each other for such a long time."
"Unheard of," it muttered testily. "Call himself a descendant of the Black family! Where's his sense of pride!"
"Any reason for that, Auror Potter?"
"Yes, thank you."
"You've done remarkably well getting him this far. Please rest. I may need your assistance later."
He didn't expect the ex-Death Eater to ask for help, so it was a surprise a couple of hours later when he heard his name. He took the stairs two at a time and found Malfoy in the doorway of his bedroom, clinging onto the door frame as violent shudders shook him from head to toe.
Harry dragged a hand through his hair, feeling bone-weary and disappointed and completely disillusioned. What had the war been for? He was sure it was something to do with equality and not being ruled by tyranny.
The nervous grin on the second man's face gradually faded, replaced by an uneasy frown. He stepped forwards cautiously and sent a small ball of light to hover over the proceedings. When the ferocity of the attack was revealed to him, he shuffled anxiously.
The taller of the two men took the steps in a hurry, the faint light emitted from the end of his wand showing Draco's crumpled figure.
"Yeah."
By Potter's expression of mingled guilt and embarrassment, it was obvious he was about to launch into a Gryffindor-style analysis of his comments to the Weasel, a subject better avoided in Draco's opinion. He butted in smoothly, cutting Potter off in mid-sentence.
Harry shrugged, acquiesced; it was true enough
"I'd really rather go home."
Harry raised a hand at the argumentative look on Ron's face. "Just for a few days. See what else we turn up before we start throwing accusations around."
"Fuck," said Malfoy again.
Draco allowed himself to be led through a dark doorway and into a surprisingly modern-looking room. Potter lowered him carefully into an upright but comfortable leather armchair, sliding a cushion behind him so that Draco was upright enough to breathe but reclined enough to relax. There was a brief silence then Potter suddenly blurted.
Harry flinched and grimaced. "Too late for that now."
"About yesterday..."
Kudos feed the muse!
When Malfoy appeared in the kitchen, somehow looking sleek and groomed even in Harry's tatty joggers and faded t-shirt, it was fortunate his gaze went first to the pan boiling on the range, because Harry physically flinched at the pain behind the other man's sophisticated mask. That's all it was, he realised, an elaborately crafted camouflage that he'd previously been unable to penetrate and of which he had not even been aware.
Draco took the remaining stairs at a run, dashed into his room and locked the door both magically and physically. He faced the wall, his hands flat against the lumpy wallpaper. How could he have been so stupid? He dropped his forehead against the surface, pressing hard as he ground his teeth.
Malfoy gestured at himself, leaning closer until Harry felt the whisper of his breath on his face. "The question is, will you take a chance or not?"
He observed it for a while, rolling the smooth wood between the pads of his fingers, a little frown on his face as he gave it an experimental flick.
Draco swallowed, nodded despite the throbbing in his head and escaped out of the door before he did something unforgiveably stupid like bursting into tears.
He buried his face in the familiar fruit scent of her hair, which was pulled over one shoulder in a loose tie.
He poked at his serving and slowly ate a few spoonfuls in silence.
Harry felt his cheeks heating. He dragged out the visitor's chair and dropped into it with a defensive frown, unable to think of anything that came even close to an excuse for that particular decision.
Potter didn't look too sure about the situation, chewing at his bottom lip again, which for some reason made Draco feel slightly breathless and overly warm.
Potter smiled at him, cool as cucumber, displaying no hint that he'd just been performing fellatio on none other than Draco Malfoy.
"It's true; he used the cruciatus curse on me. But he did it under duress, Harry, and his heart wasn't in it."
"I don't think he'll be able to cause any trouble for a few days."
"No, no! That was, really good, really. I didn't think I'd be, able to again...not after..."
And Malfoy was gone, turning on his heel and letting the kitchen door swing to behind him. The space in front of the range where he had been was suddenly far too empty.
"Go easier." Draco snorted. "Right. A nice, easy ride right back to Azkaban. I'll give it a miss, thanks."
Harry's feelings veered sharply from frustration at the lack of progress in the case, to an unexpected disappointment that Malfoy may be involved. After all they'd been through, after making a stand for him in front of the Wizengamot, Harry had hoped that Malfoy had changed his ways and was making a respectable living somewhere.
Malfoy looked surprised, then mildly irritated. He rose to his feet.
She eyed him with disappointment.
Malfoy lowered himself into Harry's chair and dropped his head against the backrest, his long legs sprawling before him, the hint of lean muscle and the outline of his knees beneath the denim of his jeans absurdly attractive.
And as promised in the last chapter...
"No. He handed in the box of stuff late last night and went off home. I was flicking through this morning and there it was."
"Ready?" he asked, evading eye contact and not offering any indication of where they were going.
"It's not that," Harry interjected quickly, torn between his desire to protect Malfoy and his loyalty to his best friend. "He's been a help so far," he said in a placating tone.  "Let's not alienate him for the sake of it. We'll check it out and decide what to do when we've more facts."
Regent's Park was a tranquil oasis, with a gentle trickle of people strolling or jogging along the wide path; it felt a million miles away from the bustle of the city streets and the crowds pouring in and out of London Zoo. It was an unlikely place for a stake-out, but if Harry's informant was correct then there just might be a glimpse of elusive potion smugglers making a trade. It was a long shot at best and the itch building at Harry's hairline told him his disguise was close to disintegration. It seemed he would have to return on another day.
"Like fuck he is! I should break the little bastard's neck right now."
"I know, it's Malfoy. I'll be careful, I promise."
(See the end of the chapter for
"They didn't need to see me. Apparently my smell is very distinctive."
"Of course not, but when did the Ministry ever see sense? I did try, but they were adamant. You both report for duty in the morning."
That just made it all worse. Draco held his breath and fought to keep himself together, wondering what it would be like if the sympathy was because Potter actually gave a shit rather than because he was embarrassed that his best mate had less manners than a Death Eater.
Malfoy met each thrust with vigour, pre-come white on his belly, his fingers digging into Harry's flesh and his legs pulling him ever deeper. His eyes widened, storm grey and beautiful, pupils blown as Harry rode forcefully over his prostrate.
Cont...
"Malfoy. Still finding trouble then."
"On every occasion when someone was killed or injured, samples were taken of the potion where some remained. They all contained the same thing, Oil of Quintessence."
"I've made a list of the bars and restaurants, muggle and wizarding, where pure-blood visitors from overseas like to hang out. Some of them are for members only of course."  He kept his voice cool and impersonal as he unrolled the scroll and pointed to the bottom of the list. "You'll no doubt be familiar with these haunts."
When Draco awoke the next morning, his suit and shoes were floating outside the bedroom door. He plucked them from the air, the unmistakable thrill of Potter's magic caressing his fingers, noting the clothing looked free of creases and ready to wear. It was almost depressing, the thoughtfulness of the gesture above and beyond that necessary between ex-rivals.
He came back to himself briefly to find Potter stroking his face and looking at him with a soft and curious expression in his eyes. Draco wanted to watch him for longer, but it was warm and comfortable and he was suddenly very tired. Unthinking, he turned his face into Potter's chest and fell asleep.
"I think I might go to bed."
He gestured at the unconscious bodies.
Not knowing what to think and unable to shake off a feeling of intense disappointment and confusion, Harry miserably accepted that he was hopelessly emotionally compromised and reluctantly flooed back to Grimmauld Place.
"Malfoy?"
More anxious by the second, he rushed away, Ron trailing behind him, looking rather puzzled at the sudden haste. A few minutes later and cursing himself at every step, Harry burst into the office, the door slamming into the wall and rebounding with the speed of his entry. Malfoy, still seated in Harry's chair, raised a laconic eyebrow.
Harry swallowed the venom he felt and settled for a cold glare at his boss.
"If it wasn't for him..." Ron snarled.
It was therefore with a sense of foreboding that he stepped past the gents' toilets in the middle of the park and allowed his feet to lead him along the same path through the shrubbery that Malfoy had taken four days earlier. It seemed somehow inevitable when Malfoy was there, stepping through the wrought iron gates by the bushes, his face white and surprised as he saw Harry.
The unexpected concern in Potter's tone seemed to flay him to the bone and strip away his fragile defences so quickly he may as well not have bothered constructing them. Merlin, thought Draco, I can't do this any more; it's been years and it's never going to end. He didn't trust himself to speak; Potter was the last person he wanted to see him break and the Ministry was the last place he wanted it to happen. He gave a sharp nod and lowered his head, letting his hair fall forwards as his eyes stung.
Potter grimaced at the weather and shrugged his agreement.  "There's a nice caf round the corner. I came down here a couple of times when I was working on the Muldoon case."
The male nurse leaning over Malfoy asked in a grim tone.
"Try something else," advised Harry.
They landed in the dim shadows of a small warehouse, a residual smell indicating to the experienced nose that it had been used for the storage of herbs and minerals.
"I didn't see you, not after the trials. Everything was..."
Malfoy stared at him for a moment, the fullness of his lips drawn tight. Then he gave a small nod.
Harry was awakened by a feeling of intense distress. He sat up, gasping, his mind struggling to find the remnants of a nightmare that didn't seem to have occurred. Confused and disorientated, he'd already swung his feet down to the floor before he realised that the emotion was not his own.
Malfoy shuddered, withdrawing his hands from Harry's arms and rubbing them down the sides of his trousers in a nervous gesture.
"Sir..." began Harry.
The other man went completely still, the kitchen so quiet Harry felt as though he'd gone deaf. He waited for the snide comment that never came. Instead Malfoy blinked and swallowed and lowered his head as he shoved his hands into his pockets.
That's enough, he told himself sternly. It was time to concentrate on business. Potter, for whatever convoluted reason, had helped him out initially and it was now his duty to complete his part of the deal. Even if the Ministry hadn't been involved, there was still a matter of magical debt to honour.
"Quite sure." There it was again, that edge of desperation.
"You in trouble." She warned him in a raucous whisper.
Harry snorted, half laughing, half crying, twisting his fists into the soft blue jumper and inhaling the smell that was pure Malfoy. He pushed into the lean frame, holding him tight and letting his hold on his own magic ease to allow it to flow with the other man's.
"Do it again! Try the chair."
"Lethe...?"
"Hang on," he said. "Just want to say something."
"I want you," he said. "I want to fuck you all the time."
His pride and feelings were smarting. Ron's face had already spoken volumes without him uttering a single word and Harry had been more than pleased to leave him in charge of the last seized warehouse.
"Well, it's a start I suppose."
"You need to go to St. Mungo's."
(See the end of the chapter for
"Not really."
"Malfoy, you alright in there?"
"Let's get it over with," snapped Malfoy, heading for the grate. "Step aside, Weasley."
He loaded some bacon onto a plate and brought it over to the table, summoning a loaf of bread as he passed.
Draco leaned against the shower door in as nonchalant a manner as he could manage. After all, he had nothing to be embarrassed about, it was only Potter and it wasn't as though they hadn't seen each other naked before in the communal Quidditch showers. Behind him the shower head sputtered into silence, dribbling a last few ice-cold drips down his back. He shivered involuntarily, feeling his nipples tighten. Not the casual effect he'd been after.
"Oh...so...you want...this?"
"That, Weasley, is a correctly presented essay. I don't expect something written with a broomhandle dipped in cheap dye. Or did an impoverished spider from your trunk collapse in your ink and enjoy its death throes on your sub-standard parchment? A blessed relief from the daily grind of being a Weasley spider, I'm sure."
"Wait." Harry snared his wrist, wrapped his fingers around it. "Don't go." He raised the wrist and kissed Malfoy's knuckles. "Upstairs. Please."
It was a typical old-style London cafe that Potter took them to, the coffee available with or without milk and no fancy frappes or skinny lattes in sight. Misted windows, scarred formica on the table tops and the type of chairs with tubular chrome legs.
Robards agreed that Grimmauld Place in Harry's custody was as good a place as any, then sent him on his way with a request for regular updates and a reminder that he was in line for the Head Auror post one day and shouldn't let any past history with the ex-Death Eater colour his judgement.
It was true enough, Draco's resentment had built up during the day to the point of explosion, piling on top of years of anger and hurt and fear until he felt the slightest thing would send him over the edge. If Potter wanted a good punch-up, he was happy to oblige. After all, there was no doubt that would be the result of any so-called sparring session; they were both far too competitive for any other outcome.
Draco watched him from his position halfway down the staircase. It seemed as though the hair tugging was neither solving the problem nor making the unruly hair any tidier and so after a minute he broke the silence.
Then Potter's hands were on his ribs, sliding slowly down to settle on his waist, pulling him closer.
"Mine," said Greyback with a growl.
He saw the determination stealing across her face and put on his most earnest expression.
Cont...
It was just Malfoy hadn't said he was hurt and he used to make such a fuss about everything...but that was then, not now, his inner voice reprimanded. In fact, Malfoy hadn't exactly made a fuss when Harry had found him in Regent's Park, and Harry still didn't know exactly what had happened to him.
He moved swiftly, had reached the top of a short flight of stone steps when he heard the scuff of a shoe against pavement behind him, much closer than expected. There was no time to react before the curse hit him between the shoulder blades, its impact so great that he was thrown forwards and down. His natural agility, honed by years of Seeker training, enabled him to tuck into a defensive position as he fell. If it hadn't been for the pillar at the bottom of the steps there was a fair chance that he would have rolled, recovered himself and attempted an escape. As it was, although he threw himself as much to the side in mid-flight as possible, the tip of his left shoulder slammed into the upright structure, and in turn that physical impact altered his trajectory enough that his temple met with the stone with an audible crack. Without making a sound, he sprawled onto the cold slabs behind the pillar, limbs splayed in a boneless manner and only the glimmer of his pale hair visible in the shadows.
Harry ate his portion of the delicious bolognaise, acknowledging but sadly unable to fully appreciate the fragrant aromas and flavours of one of Andromeda's specialities. He cleared away, made a floo call to Hermione and then took a shower himself. That accomplished, he found himself back at Malfoy's open bedroom door, wanting to join him but with no idea if that would be an acceptable move.
"It won't take a moment," said the volunteer kindly, obviously mistaking his reluctance for distress. "I'll bring you straight back to him."
He wanted to say that he was fine, but the growing waves of heat and bouts of shivering were becoming impossible to hide. He nodded and slid a little lower in the chair, as much as his ribs would allow, and let his eyes slip closed.
"So no-one knows but us?"
From that point onwards, the night steadily descended into nightmare as Malfoy's fever ebbed and flowed, and without the benefit of magical or medical help the man deteriorated rapidly. Within an hour, the shaking was followed by a bout of wide-eyed, feverish activity when his temperature soared and he rarely knew where he was or that Harry was present. It was a pattern that was to repeat itself over and over again.
"Quite alright, Potter. I am irresistible after all."
"I'll get that drink now," he said.
First Malfoy was reprimanded briefly, which made an unrepentant expression that was pure Lucius appear on his face.
"Right," said Malfoy, in a dull tone that caused something in Harry's chest to clench a little.
Ron Weasley chose that moment to open the door.
Tbc...
Nothing.
"But Madam Pomfrey...?"
He wasn't sure how long he stayed there, the auror in him piecing together some theories about the sort of attack that would leave that type of injuries. There was no doubt it had been vicious in its ferocity.  Eventually a small sound alerted him to the fact that the other man was regaining consciousness. Malfoy raised a hand, his fingers scrabbling at the oxygen mask fixed to his face.
"Oh," muttered Harry. "Not since the Manor, where you were tortured."
"So we have something in common after all, shit relatives. Good to know."
The library door opened on silent hinges and a bright bar of light fell across the unlit room, illuminating the gleam of polished floorboards until they crossed into the dark patch of shadow in which Draco hid.
"No," admitted Harry. "But he looked pretty beaten up. I thought he ought to come in and get checked over."
"Go on."
After a moment he shifted the hand upwards and gently moved a few strands of hair away from Draco's heated forehead. His green eyes were intense, full of unspoken questions. Draco imagined they would be along the lines of "What was that?", "Why didn't you?" and maybe even "Why now?" Thankfully he didn't say anything and Draco was able to catch his breath, although Potter's meandering fingers did nothing to slow the pounding of his heart or lessen the throbbing in his groin.
"Hermione, I don't think he's well enough to be up to anything."
"It seems that you are still not yourself, Draco. It might be advisable to call on Madam Pomfrey before you leave."
Hermione pursed her lips and turned to the Floo.
Malfoy shook his head slightly, his eyes grey as storm clouds as they met Harry's for a brief moment, then slid away as though he'd lost interest in the sorry proceedings.
Grey eyes met his, the misery in them acute. It was odd, thought Harry; it was probably the longest the two of them had ever spent in close proximity without fighting.
Malfoy came to a halt, scowling and gesturing at Harry. The nurse looked distinctly relieved.
"Well you are, so you might as well make the best of it."
He stretched out a hand, stopping just short of Malfoy's wrist; the physical sensation of the glowing current beneath the man's skin was exhilarating and left him breathless.
Malfoy snorted. "As if you don't know."
Hermione wasn't quite wringing her hands but it wasn't far off.
"I still have yours," said Harry carefully.
Malfoy watched him, his expression softening.
"Do you need to sit down, Malfoy? Yeah, of course you do. I'm sorry. C'mon, it's just through here."
"You're beautiful," he breathed suddenly, shocking himself as much as Malfoy, who froze, his cock jerking against Harry's lips.
"Potter! In my office now. And bring Malfoy with you."
The bowls flew back to their place on the dresser and parked themselves neatly on the shelf. Two cheap ceramic dishes hurtled towards the table and rattled to a halt.
It was Weasley, puzzlement in his voice and an odd look on his face and immediately Potter stepped away and strode off into the warehouse, his cheeks now flaming.
"I need to take some details from you. If you could just follow me."
"Really fucking hot."
Malfoy sank back into his chair and grimaced.
"Shit!"
"Everyone got that? Good."
"You're afraid of losing your friends? Because of me?" He sounded resigned, almost as though he was expecting a dismissal.
"Wasn't him though."
She faced him then, hands on her hips, reminding him powerfully of her rather bossy Hogwarts persona.
Draco pushed away from him, panicking.
"Potter."
"We're fine, Ron."
"Are you together?"
"We had an agreement, remember?"
"Calm down, Ron."
She stroked his arm soothingly, nodding.
"No," he had to admit. "Why would he? It's not as if we're friends."
Minutes later they were in Diagon Alley with Draco's heart thudding and a sick feeling in his stomach. Believe in the glamour, he told himself; no-one knows who you are. It was a weird feeling, being back on a wizarding street, far more so than being in the Ministry. The last time he'd been in Diagon Alley, he'd been hexed twice and someone had thrown a piece of masonry from the Gringotts' repairs at him. The hatred had been palpable and far too visible.
Malfoy thrust hard then, hands twisted in Harry's hair as he rutted into his throat with sharp gasps.
"Yes, sir."
"You," breathed Potter, "...are gorgeous. I want to fuck you into the wall until you come for me."
"Give me a shout if you need anything."
That was it then, the small area must be where the stunning spell had hit.
Fuck! It's no use, Potter." Humiliation painted Malfoy's cheeks red. "My magic isn't there anymore, you can see that!"
"No. Well...maybe. It's not as though it would be the first time." Granger's frown pinched as she regarded Draco's expression. "I'll make sure he knows what really happened," she said quickly, then added in a different tone, "Are you hurt?"
"When were you planning to ask? After we'd shagged a few more times perhaps?"
The boys' irrestible attraction increases, but will they ever understand each other?
Bearing in mind that he was a former Death Eater trapped in a deal with the Ministry, his name was in a ledger tying him into illegal potion supplies, he was shagging the auror who had custody of him and that auror was none other than the saviour of the wizarding world, Draco should have been having a conniption beneath his icy Malfoy mask.
"You don't say," muttered Draco. Out of the mouth of gnomes.
"You're never going to grow out of that, are you, Potter?"
It was the truth anyway; Malfoy looked as though he was about to faint and the day was warm, muggy; if the man was cold he was probably in some sort of shock.
"At least sit down," protested Harry.
Malfoy's grey eyes narrowed dangerously. "Then why the demonstration?" It was obvious from his expression he wasn't going to let the matter go without further explanation.
The words were without heat as Ron's anger faded away, replaced by a weariness that Harry hadn't seen since the Forest of Dean.
For some reason the mention of hats prompted a crystal clear memory of Malfoy in the snow, white flakes on a grey fur hat, cheeks pink with cold beneath eyes ice-blue as the winter sky. By the time Harry actually realised he'd been insulted, it was too late to respond. He raised his head to find the other man was watching him with a surprisingly gentle smirk on his face. He flushed; Malfoy always had been a distraction, one way or another.
"I never said it was a coincidence," noted Potter defensively. "I was on a stake-out a few days earlier and you walked past, so yeah, I wondered if maybe... Then I went back yesterday and you were there, and you know the rest."
"Of what? The name Malfoy on a ledger? A ledger without a date? And no indication which Malfoy?"
"I'll try, but like I said, it is Malfoy."
Cont...
Draco shivered and pulled his jacket closer around himself, eyeing the insidious creep of dark clouds across the uncomfortable looking grey sky with a feeling of foreboding. He hoped it wasn't an omen.
He stood on the bluestone blocks of the spiral path, a sea of wild flowers around him, and concentrated on breathing past the lump of panic that constricted his throat. As if things hadn't been bad enough already; now he had uncontrollable wandless magic and he'd positively thrown himself at Potter, who had inexplicably kissed him and then undeniably come to his senses and retreated in horror when he'd realised he was not only snogging a Death Eater, but the despised Draco Malfoy no less.
"Yes," said Draco quietly, finding the delicate tickle of magic had brought a lump to his throat; it seemed such a long time since he'd felt any magic at all other than the roiling discontent of his own constrained and frustrated magical core. "It's nice to feel it again."
Harry moved one arm from where it was wrapped around the other man's waist and gently stroked the head tucked into his shoulder, pushing away soft strands of hair until he could see the side of Malfoy's face.
He untwisted his fingers from the warm material and wiped his eyes, trying for a shaky smile.
"You helped me when no one else would. But it's more than that. Much more. Now it's up to you if you want to believe I've changed, if you want to trust me or not. I am what I am and this is it, Potter; this is it."
He tugged distractedly at his hair, almost tearing out a tuft as his voice went up a pitch. "Merlin, Hermione! What must he be thinking? I've got to find him and try and explain...apologise!"
"Are the wrong sort."
"Bringing you here...I didn't think...Hogwarts was always home to me..."
"Any Slytherin would know that about fifteen years ago the potions departments in Durmstrang and Hogwarts went head to head in an international potions competition. Hogwarts won of course, but for some of the parties involved the intense rivalry never died."
Potter jumped, clearly unaware of Draco's presence until he spoke.
Despite its physical beauty, that pale hair caused a cold shiver to run down Harry's spine, bringing to mind the smooth slide of Lucius Malfoy's blond mane against his cloak, and the slicked back shine of the younger Malfoy's head on that very first day at Hogwarts. "You don't want to be making friends with the wrong sort." Those words had been the start of years of enmity that sputtered out in a molten puddle of confusion and fear around about the time of the fiendfyre.
In truth, at first it was concern that kept his gaze locked onto the other man, but as the hours passed and the pained creases on Malfoy's face smoothed out it became more that Harry found his gaze drawn in that direction for no particular reason other than Malfoy was...interesting.
"How'd it go?"
With a quick smile she was gone and Harry was left alone with his thoughts and a sleeping Death Eater on his path.
"Harry?"
The sparks gathered, became a warm coil in Draco's gut that made him lean in a little closer, the rapid thrum of Potter's pulse against the side of his face testimony that he was similarly affected. Then the kitchen door opened and Potter stepped quickly away as Hermione emerged.
" Harry...?" He asked quietly.
"What?" he snapped testily. "Have I grown a second nose or something?"
"I understand that, Mr Malfoy, but you really do require medical care. If you sign yourself out the Trust can't be held responsible if you take a turn for the worse. You shouldn't be by yourself."
"Don't worry, Potter, I was well tutored in social niceties."
"Just look at what Ranworth seized though. That poncy handwriting on the order looks a lot like Malfoy's. Merlin knows Snape shoved it under our noses enough!"
Thirty minutes later they were back in Harry's office. He shut the door securely and turned to Malfoy.
"Thanks for...he wouldn't have gone for it if I'd lost my...you were...and I'm sorry, what I said last night, it wasn't..."
"Thank you, Mr Potter, but that won't be necessary. You can hardly stand yourself. What you need is a hot drink and a lie down."
"I'll wait here."
Ron shrugged. "We're partners, 'nuff said."
Malfoy nodded, two gentle pushes of his forehead against Harry's collarbone, then unfurled his fingers from Harry's t-shirt and rolled onto his back. He looked completely wiped out and listless and Harry stared at him in a considering way before summoning his glasses and their street clothes. Glasses on and clothing reduced to the size of a small sandwich, Harry got to his feet, stuffing the packet into his joggers' pocket. He leaned down and held out a hand.
In the hours when he hadn't been sleeping himself on his transfigured bed or chair, he'd found himself watching Malfoy more than was strictly necessary, although he supposed that wasn't too unusual in the context of their shared history.
With a last puzzled glance, Ron was gone. Harry turned to Malfoy immediately.
"It was every time we came into contact, but only if it was, you know, skin to skin. I got a blast of whatever he was feeling."
He must have dozed because it seemed to be only seconds later that someone touched his forearm and gave it a little shake. Draco flinched, scooting further into his corner before he could stop himself.
The words were muffled by the mask, but unmistakable.
That was true enough, although Harry wondered if the spots had grown freely on the youthful Malfoy or were cultivated by his parents and upbringing. Only time would tell.
"Yeah." Potter pulled him closer and kissed his jaw. "I didn't mean to put you through anything else..."
Pushing himself to his feet, Harry strode after him, remembering to walk with a ponderous gait and fervently wishing that the legs of his disguise were as long as his real ones. Malfoy drew steadily further ahead, until the path twisted and turned through some bushes and he disappeared from sight. By the time Harry got to other side of the leafy screen, the arch-enemy of his school years was gone. He dashed through a wrought iron gate onto the street, cursing, only to be brought to an abrupt standstill by the harsh blatter of a big motorcycle. Malfoy swept past him, curled over the handlebars so he appeared as one with the machine. He rode like he flew, thought Harry, full of arrogance and natural grace and thumbing his nose at the world.
"But...?"
"Not here," said Potter simply. "Do you recognise the place."
Something wet and cool slid between the cheeks of his arse and Potter's fingers followed, stroking, teasing. Then the heat of his body was gone as he dropped to his knees, hands pulling apart Draco's cheeks and his tongue wet and warm, licking, dipping inside.
"Well, you'll just have to wait. Stop whining."
It wasn't too long coming; the other wizard flexed his fingers, took up a textbook-perfect stance and threw out a barrage of spells. As far as Harry could see, none of them had any effect. By the end, the wand was smoking and Malfoy's face was flushed with exertion. He turned to Harry, his eyes wild and desperate.
"Of course," she said carefully. "Romani may not have actually kept anything illegal in any of these warehouses."
"He's angry, Harry. It will take him a while to accept that Malfoy is working alongside the Aurors, with you in particular. The damage done by the Malfoys is very personal to the Weasleys, but if it helps save innocent lives, I'm sure he'll come around. Just give him some space."
He rocked back on his heels, huffing a disgusted breath.
"Did you use magic, before the ban?" Harry enquired.
That was met with a snort.
Harry suppressed a grimace. "Be careful; the customers..."
"Go on." Harry stood too, walking around the desk and propping his hip against it, trying not to think about the way Malfoy had looked, right there, when Harry had his mouth around him.
As he spoke the nurse stepped away from the bed and Malfoy's body was no longer obscured. Harry caught his breath in shock. The other man's torso was a mass of weals and bruises, the clear imprint of a boot sole easily distinguishable. Despite his auror training it made him feel physically sick; how Malfoy had remained upright so long was a mystery.
Hermione's voice penetrated his thoughts, tearing him away from his pensive contemplation of Malfoy's pale face. He looked up to meet her gaze, noting the puzzled line between her brows.
"Malfoy?"
Malfoy stood. He wandered over to the small window, turning to face the sunshine so that his head and shoulders became a black silhouette.
Draco blinked, frowning.
Draco raised an eyebrow. "So what, Potter?"
He took a gulp of tea, scalded his tongue, tried not to care that his hands were shaking as he set the mug down.
Harry nodded, dragging his thumb and forefinger through the stubble on his jaw in an unconscious gesture of weariness.
"Let's get on with it, shall we?"
He pushed a ledger in Harry's direction and Harry's heart sank.
Feeling for all the world like a schoolboy again, Harry swallowed hard and tried to pull himself together.
It was odd, he thought as the panicked gallop of his heart slowed, how even the touch of Potter's thumb sent sparks through the aura of his magical core. But it had always been that way between them, some strange intensity affecting their every interaction so that each insult, every spell, each collision on the quidditch pitch was more powerful than it should have been.
He ran his fingers through his hair in a distracted manner, flicking his troubled grey gaze in Harry's direction.
Harry stepped closer, his voice deepening as he found the words.
"Tea," said Harry unnecessarily, balancing a mug on the wide arm of Malfoy's chair.
His eyes stung. It was all his fault. He'd treated Malfoy just like everyone else did and now Malfoy would finish his work for the Ministry and then he'd leave and Harry would never find out what could have been between them; instead he would be alone once more.
Behind Harry, Robards pushed forwards.
Malfoy regarded him warily, a slight pout to his mouth that drew Harry's gaze despite his best intentions. Harry gulped, trying to articulate clearly.
"No," he blurted, his voice shaking with the thumping of his heart.
"It didn't make any difference though, did it?" said Harry bitterly. "Not to the people I loved."
"Has Malfoy spoken to you at all, about his recent injuries?"
"You're not well enough to leave. That's not what I meant."
Malfoy took the mug carefully in both hands, although even this precaution couldn't disguise the way his fingers trembled. He sipped and closed his eyes briefly in appreciation before turning his gaze on Harry.
The garden and the brick wall beyond seemed to be sliding to the left, in the same vaguely nauseating fashion things had been for most of the day, apart from the few seconds when Potter's lips had been on his and the whole universe had centered on right here, right now. Draco had to conclude that Madam Pomfrey had been right; he should have stayed in bed. The whole tornado thing could probably be blamed on exhaustion. Potter? Not so much.
Snape eyed him haughtily. "The Ministry is filled with incompetent buffoons. You, however, are neither incompetent nor a buffoon. Remember your training, Draco."
Harry stuffed a piece of bread into his mouth and nodded vigorously.
"No need. Please repay me by taking all the time and help you need for a full recovery. And remember, my door is always open."
Potter sighed and levitated the boxes from one desk onto the floor, then flopped down on the chair behind it.
Malfoy had done nothing wrong, she insisted. He'd managed to throw a couple of effective shields, without either wand or word as far as she could recall, being a little busy herself at the time.
"You are investigating Snakeskin Potions. You want to know everything I can remember about Crowfoot, Dangelos and Smithson, especially anything that will assist you in tracking down their current whereabouts. Am I missing anything?"
Malfoy, who had nightmares about Greyback, who had recently suffered some trauma that he'd not disclosed. The connection was flooded by Harry's shame and guilt as he pulled back.
"Harry?"
Potter drew in a sharp breath, nodded, fully aware of the hidden meaning when he replied, "Always."
Malfoy dropped his gaze to the floor, speaking softly. "I don't think I ever hated you, Potter. I hated what you represented. I resented the fact that you got away with everything and I hated that you were always better than me, when my father wanted so much for me to be the best at everything. But I never hated you."
"They'll have to believe what I tell them," said Harry shortly. "We wouldn't have Romani without your help."
Draco found his cheek against the wall, Potter still jerking inside him and his breath harsh pants on the back of Draco's neck as his hand milked the last come from Draco's cock. Then Potter pulled out, his semen a hot rush down Draco's thighs as Potter dropped back to his knees and turned Draco to face him. His eyes were almost closed, lashes dark as he kissed Draco's stomach, the swirling magic from his lips spreading to clean the stickiness, before turning him again to lap at his arse. Draco cried out as the warm tongue breached him, licking deep inside, the tip of Potter's tongue hitting its target with unerring precision as Potter's fingers curled around his cock, slid up and over the top in time with the flicks of his tongue. Helpless, shaking and crying out, Draco fell over the edge with a surge that filled Potter's hand and made Draco's vision fade. He slumped backwards, sprawling naked across Potter's lap and grasping at his thighs in an attempt to stay connected to reality.
Indignation at this ridiculous statement made Harry's face flush.
"Why would that matter?"
Eventually she gave a huff of satisfaction.
"Not a chance, Potter."
That thought was disquieting, particularly when he ran his gaze over the other man again. He certainly wasn't ugly. But, you know, it was still Malfoy!
Draco stared at him in disbelief. "Not of you."
Draco came to a halt halfway up the staircase, remembering belatedly that he needed to breathe. His knuckles gleamed white against the dark wood of the bannister as his mind raced. So what if Potter had saved him? Potter was a natural saviour. And so what if Potter fancied him, wanted to shag him? He no doubt saw the same pretty boy others had. He was admittedly more polite about it, because after all it was Potter, but it didn't mean Draco was anything but a quick shag, the scratching of an itch that had started years before.
They stayed there for some time in silence, until the burn in Harry's thigh muscles told him it was time to move. He scrubbed at the gritty feeling in his eyes with the palm of his hands and then pushed himself to his feet.
"Let's keep it that way. I'll tell Malfoy not to identify anyone he only recognises from seeing them in the pub."
"Not tired of the mantle of saviour then?" There was a hint of mockery in his tone.
Potter, the witch now bound, began to twist around rapidly towards the noise, but at the same moment Romani leaped behind Draco and cast again over Draco's shoulder. Ice blue fire crackled past his right ear, heading straight for Potter.
It didn't seem as though the ex-Death Eater was going to move or speak and Harry took hold of his upper arm in a firm grip, unsure if he was offering mute support or simply preventing Malfoy from backing up into him. Even clothing could not stop the emotional transfer of fear and horror, so intense that Harry flinched as he peered around the other man.
2 days later.
Harry grimaced. Ron's hatred of anything related to Death Eaters had reached epic proportions.
"He paid a high price for holding back. You shouldn't judge him too harshly."
Draco pretended to ignore him. He pulled a pack of cigarettes from his pocket and lit up, keeping it casual, hoping the smoke would steady his nerves and that his hand wasn't shaking too noticeably.
"First thing tomorrow," he said. "You can start with some simple wand work. "
Even the customary snark was missing and there was a vulnerability about Malfoy's features that made something uncomfortable twist in Harry's gut.
He supposed Malfoy had grown up, not just physically, early indications suggested that he'd matured mentally as well. Perhaps they both had.
Potter regarded him for a moment longer, the red stain on his cheekbones making his eyes seem greener than ever. He'd grown into himself, thought Draco; he was taller, broader across the shoulders, his t-shirt tight enough to show the play of muscle beneath the fabric. His hair was more styled but still unruly and the short beard suited him, defining his features and balancing the effect of the thick, dark eyebrows. Belatedly Draco became aware that he was staring and he looked away quickly.
She pulled a scroll from the pocket of her robes and placed it on the table. It didn't look as though Malfoy was intending to answer, keeping his eyes closed and his head tilted back against the slats of the chairback.
"Oh, er, sorry Malfoy. I thought you..."
"Can I?" Potter - hoarse in his ear.
He started to get up, the customary graceful movement arrested abruptly as he straightened. Despite the way his lips pressed into a straight line, he couldn't stop the small noise that broke free. He stumbled forwards and Harry moved without thinking, catching him under the arms so that Malfoy fell against his chest, his head heavy on Harry's cheek and the hiss of his breath warm against Harry's neck as he swore.
Draco gasped, the brush of his cock against the cold wall almost tipping him over the edge. Potter snorted a laugh behind him, pushed back in, fast, rough, grinding over Draco's prostrate with unerring accuracy.
Cont...
"There's some things we need to talk about. You might as well sit down."
Ron imitated Snape's derisory drawl.
Sorry it's been a while since the last update - working 24/7 at the moment :(
"I am, Ron. But that doesn't mean I'm going to jump to conclusions."
"It's barbaric how she has to cry like that, when a simple episkey or a potion, but of course you would think I meant...never mind."
"Only if you want to?"
"Rude. Be throwing poor gnomes around next like scarhead." The gnome hurled a clod of earth at him, took the hand of a sprout coloured gnome child and stamped off.
He raised a hand at Harry's expression.
Hermione swallowed, unconsciously rubbing her arm.
Draco ate, a study in calmness as he cut and chewed a bacon sandwich, forcing each mouthful down in the hope it would still the anxious clench of his stomach. He observed Potter surreptitiously from beneath his eyelashes, noting in a rather hopeless way that Potter's rumpled morning hair looked so incredibly soft that he could almost feel the texture of it beneath his fingertips.
Harry found himself gesturing in frustration and tucked his hands into his pockets.
"Calm down!"
"You're on, Malfoy."
"Tea," murmured Malfoy quietly behind him, his voice heavy with loss. "Cures everything, so Mother used to say."
It was strange that even after so many years, part of him was still enraged at the way Malfoy and his friends had treated Ron and Hermione, at the hurt he'd caused by running to his father and Rita Skeeter telling lies about Hagrid and Buckbeak, about Sirius and Lupin and so many other things.
They hurtled through the bewildering maze of shafts, Harry completely aware of the soft puff of breath against the back of his neck and the fresh tingle of magic from Malfoy's hand. The connection between their magical fields was less powerful since Malfoy's outburst of wandless magic, but was still clear enough that Harry could pick up a jumble of conflicting emotions.
"You know what? It doesn't matter where you live. I'm taking you to the nearest NHS hospital, so you'd better tell me now if any of these injuries are magical, 'cos they don't look magical."
"Believe me, Potter, you couldn't possibly say anything worse than the papers already have."
An imperious hand gesture cut him off as Robards rose and walked ponderously around the desk, closing in on Malfoy until he was mere inches away.
A couple of minutes later the group re-emerged.
"Oh, Harry!"
Harry stopped abruptly. Fascinating? Malfoy fascinating? Merlin, surely he didn't think Malfoy was attractive? Did he?
"It's likely any medical assistance will have to come from Madam Pomfrey. It makes sense as she knows your medical history and if you're not at St Mungo's maybe we can keep the press out of it."
"You ready, Harry? Robards says you have a brief for the team and then we're going out in the field?"
"What?" Harry stared at him. "I'm not going to lock you in!"
"Okay," said Harry. "I, er, don't know many details though. We lost touch years ago, we just met up again recently."
They walked in companiable silence until they reached the lifts, then Ron mentioned casually that he'd spoken to Hermione.
Malfoy swayed into him, their mouths meeting fiercely as his long fingers curled into Harry's hair.  A firm butt cheek in each hand, Harry pushed his tongue deep, Malfoy opening to him, their hips pushing forwards in a slow grind that was exquisite and frustrating in equal measures until Harry broke away.
They apparated straight to Grimmauld Place, setting off a shock wave of concern that rippled through the house and served to increase Harry's anxiety ten-fold.
"If there's any change, you bring him straight back." The nurse turned his attention to Malfoy. "Other than that, see your practice nurse in a couple of days to get that dressing changed. You can pick up your prescription at the desk on the way out."
