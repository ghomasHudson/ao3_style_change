He'd failed.
As he reached the manor doors, he gave himself a reassuring smile as he opened them with determination. His breath hitched with pure surprise; the doors opened to reveal no other than Harry Potter.
It was true. He was only human. He made mistakes. But that was the problem. He'd made too many mistakes, ones that he couldn't come back from.
“But I wasn’t alone.” He said firmly. “No, I had the stars.” His lips curled into a small grin.
All that he had fought for, all that he had lost, all that he had found. It had all happened so that he could be here. So that life would lead him down this path. He was free.
He hums feverishly sucking up and down his shaft. “I can’t wait. Ahhhh. I need to be in you Now!” he shouted and Draco nodded frantically. His head fell back. He couldn’t think of anything except how good it felt to have Potter touch him that way. So, demanding. Plentiful with want and need.
“I can’t feel it.” he cried out hysterically, his whole body shaking in pure despair. “I can’t feel it.” he screamed as Weasley but a comforting hand on his shoulder, his own face stained with tears.
Theo pulled back the covers, patting the spot next to him for Draco to slide in. Carefully Draco, slipped in beside him as Theo, pulled the covers up to submerge them with warmth.
Several seconds later and Draco finally regained the ability to speak. “Let her go.” He said lowly, his voice wavering in fear. Not for himself, but for Kat.
that you’re thinking. Your nose twitches uncontrollably whenever you’re in deep thought.”
He cautiously approached his father’s cell. At least they’d made alterations so the prison was somewhat liveable. He understood those who agreed with the inhumane conditions that the prisoners used to endure, claiming that they deserved it. That didn’t necessarily mean that he agreed with them.
Well, that was all kinds of wrong. Being a Slytherin was about knowing when a good lie was warranted in a particular situation. Sadly, this pathetic excuse of an interrogation didn't qualify.
Draco was in the library attempting to defeat a particularly violent piece of potions homework. He growled, like hell would his homework be victorious, he was the king of all things potions.
“What has he done now?” he questioned.
He sighed. “Well, I think it’s a commendable idea.” He answered and Hermione gave him an angry look.
“Draco..” he whispered. “What’s wrong with you.” He asked pleadingly. “If they’ve done anything to you, I swear I’ll kill them. I’ll kill every last one of them.” He spat out angrily, his eyes alive with fury.
After all, no matter how many times a snake shed its skin, it would always be a snake.
Draco was sitting in front of the Great Lake that same very evening. He had his sketchbook on his lap and a pencil in his hand. It was a beautiful night he mused. Quiet and peaceful, just how he liked it.
“Don’t tell me you never felt that?” Potter asked desperately.
It felt nice, safe, to have another person hold you. A person that you trusted, that you loved. So Draco let it out, he let it
concern.” She bit out. “Anyways, I was here first, so do us both a favour and get the fuck out.” She snarled.
“What are you going to do?” she accused lightly.
Maybe on the outside he appeared calm, but on the inside, on the inside... well, he'd rather not say.
, it was the fact that a crazed madman wanted to kill his family and himself if he failed to kill the Headmaster, ruining the lights fighting chances in the process, perhaps aiding the death of his boyfriend.
“Dark forces attempt to penetrate this castles walls. But in the end, their greatest weapon… is you.” The old crow concluded, and Draco looked up, straight into the burning green eyes of
There was seven of them.
Ever since he were a little boy, he’d been lonely. He hadn’t had many friends, and the ones he did have his father never let him play with. It had hurt him more than he’d ever care to admit.
Something changed.
As the dark mark’s shock flowed through him, the first thing that Draco felt had been relief. It was over. It was really over. He truly couldn’t explain how it felt. To not have anyone tell you who to be. To feel a weight be lifted from your shoulders. To be free. It wasn’t an illusion, no, he was really free. He. Was. Free.
why he didn’t identify him back at the Manor. He must realise that Draco was on his side, Hermione and Weasley obviously did. But as he stared into his hopeful eyes, Draco knew without a doubt, that Potter’s words were full of a deeper meaning. He knew that Potter was asking why Draco specifically saved
“I don’t want to talk.” He mumbled.
Draco shrugged. “I don’t care. I still have to stir the potion, whether he shows up or not.” He snapped, before stomping out of the common room.
“Nothing in particular.” He answered, suddenly feeling quite shy. He’d never shown his artwork to anyone.
His aunt’s eyes glistened with tears, “that would be lovely.” She answered in relief and Draco smiled, he had stuck the landing. He repeats, he had stuck the landing.
Potter shrugged. “Worth it.” he declared proudly.
“Please. Stay.” Potter asked and Draco sighed and sat back down.
He briefly wondered if Draco had misjudged him. He glanced at the red faced guy. So, maybe Macmillan
Draco stood up to face the baffled eyes of Ronald Weasley. “Not a word.” Draco threatened and Weasley nodded before they made their way into the classroom.
Potter let out a defeated sigh, “can’t you see? It is my concern. Everything you do is my concern. You will never not be my concern. Draco please listen to me.” He begged.
“I’ll tell you what.” He said calmly, “tomorrow evening, you pick some girls and boys if you want, from your year that you like the best.” If the ignorant kids didn't want to make friends with Kat, then he'd make them for her.
He glared at him. “That’s what I said.” Draco pointed out, his attention still on the device. It was just so immersing, so complicated, He felt it his duty to figure it out. Nothing was too big for Draco Malfoy to figure out. He was sure of it.
Draco was starting to understand what Blaise meant by his obvious flare for the dramatics.
you so.” Kat bit out.
A soft pulsing was vibrating gently on his chest. He looked down, picking up the ring that hung silently from it’s chain. It eloped him in it’s warmth, it’s protection thrumming through him.
“Are you in trouble?” a meek voice asked.
She smiled at Draco, “hello, Draco. I see that the wrackspurts are still as potent as ever.” He blinked at her, because ‘wrackspurts’ were the only things that he couldn’t understand. But when he’d brought that up Luna had just laughed and said, ‘that’s the whole point Draco.’
that. He even could have that with Potter. If he’d just allow himself to take the great leap of faith, instead of carrying on like a coward. Maybe, just maybe if he allowed himself, he’d have a chance at something real.
“Good.” He carried on. “Make sure you’re there at exactly seven sharp and I’ll be there to greet you all.”
He turned to face his boyfriend, because of course it was. Somehow Potter always knew when he was upset, was always there when he needed comfort and a shoulder to cry on. It was more than he deserved.
She rolled her eyes, “I wasn’t asking what you were doing before you got here. I asked what the hell are you doing here?” she growled.
“Draco, who’s judging you? What’s going on?” The frantically asked.
“What, why?” he asked.
“Something.” Theo snapped. “Anything!”
It felt right. Potter was giving his all, kissing Draco with all the passion that he could muster, and Draco couldn’t help but kiss him back. He needed this. Even if it was just for a moment. He needed Potter.
Was he blind or just stupid? “Obviously, I was having a lovely breakfast with my new Hufflepuff friend before you rudely interrupted.”
he was.
He was a monster. He was cruel, ugly, and foul. No better than the Dark Lord himself. In fact, he was worse than the Dark Lord. At least he believed himself to be doing the right thing when he committed his misdeeds, Draco knew what he was doing was wrong, but he still did it. He was a coward.
That's when it all clicked. He finally understood. She wasn't mad, no, she was afraid. She didn't want to lose him. Neither of them wanted to lose him. He felt horrible. He felt ashamed.
He was deeply engaged with his work when he felt a new presence in front of him. Hufflepuff's! It had to be the Hufflepuff's.
“You are a very special young lady.” He said between tears.
So that ending broke my heart. Harry's insecurities are staring to make an appearance. A lil teaser for the next chapter: Drarry, Drarry and did I say Drarry?!
“What? Do you not like me back or something?” Draco didn’t answer.
him and all the death jokes. They were absolutely ghastly.
Was he really that transparent. Didn't Blaise realise? It was obvious that Draco didn't deserve it. It was something that wasn't up to him. His choices had been taken from him a long time ago.
Kat sighed. “That’s a shame. I hope that when you get a new one, you’ll be able to draw something happy.” and he thought about telling her that was unlikely, but decided against it.
Draco’s eyes widened. “I said go.” He repeated, urging Potter to listen to him. Why didn't Potter just listen to him? He could save them
Potter crouched down next to him, tears falling from his eyes. “Draco?” he whispered in pure disbelief. His features wide with shock.
“No, I could never do that?” she said sadly and Draco wanted to shake some sense into her.
Hippogriff’s. Disgusting creatures. They deserved a punishment worse than death. He hated those bloody chickens.
“You’re not. By the way. Fine, that is. I know you think that you’re strong, and that you don’t want to hear it. But, it’s okay not to be okay. You need closure. Whatever or whenever that may be. You really need it.” His father said.
Who knew that Theo was quite the charmer? Not Draco.
your interactions with Potter in your sixth year?” he asked.
Pomfrey nodded. “How are you feeling?” she asked.
What the hell was he meant to say to that? So maybe, just maybe he was spending all his free time with Ms Pritchett. But what was wrong with that? They were simply bonding and helping each other to heal after a devastating loss.
He wanted his Potter. The one who told him stories about his childhood. The one who spoke of his hopes and dreams so passionately. The one that made Draco feel like more than a disgusting Death Eater. Where was he? Where was
What did he want him to say? What the
“And now,” he carried on, “now you’re bloody telling me that I have to give Kat the portkey and maybe never see her again.” He roared, his face plastered with complete despair.
He sighed, “I have no problem with Potter.” He stated simply.
She held him tightly as Draco shook violently with tears. He could bare understand it. He’d done this? He’d helped Kat? It couldn’t be true. It just couldn’t. “You
The Headmaster sighed knowingly. “Are you sure that you’re alright, Mr Malfoy?” he asked in concern.
.” His father admitted and a tear rolled down Draco’s cheek.
“Malfoy!” a cold voice boomed, and he felt his heart stop. He kept on going. He couldn’t face it. He couldn’t face him.
It was raw, passionate, and full of longing. Draco sighed, pulling Potter closer. He needed this. Needed
With a choked gasp he turned the paper around. ‘
That was a lie. She was more Draco's than anyone else could ever hope her to be. He knew he was being selfish, but what was the point of martyring himself off if he wasn't going to receive any gains?
His words sent shivers down his spine. Draco knew that he should run. That he should walk away and never look back. But he couldn’t. He wouldn’t.
Bloody Hufflepuff’s!
Draco growled suddenly feeling anger rip through him. “Then you can tell
that he had to stay strong because no one could fix him. But he was tired of waiting. Tired of having to be the one to fix himself and everyone else. Tired of being strong. And for once, he’d just want it to be easy. To be simple. To be helped. To be
Harry abruptly got up, making his way to the edge of the cliff so that his gaze was overlooking the sea, Hermione followed suit. “I
“Last time I checked I wasn’t talking to you like you were a bloody animal. Stop being so dramatic, Theo.” Draco criticised, dramatic was a title only reserved for Draco.
When was Potter not completely out of order? It was like second nature to him. Perfect Potter really wasn’t all that perfect if you asked him.
“First?” he asked sceptically. Visitors? While he looked like this. How so very unseemly.
Draco stared at him hoping that if stared long enough then maybe he could stare Potter straight out existence. He reasoned that the odds probably weren’t in his favour, but he was willing to try. Merlin! He sounded like a Hufflepuff. He was definitely spending too much time with Kat. Father would be so disappointed.
Not speaking to Potter was a safety blanket. A protection for Draco’s heart. He’d denied Potter communication all because he was scared. Well, he wouldn’t be scared anymore. He couldn’t.
be standing in my home in the next five minutes, or so help me I’ll drag you over here faster than you can say howler.” She said with the upmost defiance and conviction, before shoving her head out of the flew as the connection cut off.
So, the final chapter before the epilogue! I hope this almost ending is a fitting one :)
He gulped. “You haven’t done anything. You’re absolutely perfect. They’re just very deluded and prejudice people, who will stop at nothing to get what they want.” He snarled out that last part.
Draco took a deep intake of breath, “you’re obviously not able to put together coherent sentences. I’ll speak to you once you’ve learnt better vocabulary than that of a five-year-old.” He snarled before turning to leave.
cowardly leave the battle. Part of giving up was accepting that it was okay to start again. Opening his arms meant staying true to himself, to what he believed in, to
Draco shrugged. “I can’t say I’m all that bothered.” He quirked. “Anyways, how’s the potion coming along?” he asked, taking a seat next to Weasley.
“Quite sure, yes. Anyways, this is the hardest and strongest potion on the list. If brewed correctly, we’re guaranteed an O.” he declared in triumph.
She sighed. “I don’t know.” She breathed out. “I used to wake up sometimes and feel really, really sad. I didn’t have any friends in my old school. They said I was weird.” She said sadly.
“What’s this?” Potter asked sceptically, picking up the sheet and reading over it.
sprawled across his forehead.
“What do you mean I’m not happy?” he questioned, part of him already knowing the answer, but not being brave enough to admit it.
He couldn’t help but notice the similarities between her and Kat. They were so similar but yet so different. He felt awful for how he’d treated Hermione in their past years. She didn’t deserve it, none of them deserved it.
So, he’d done the only thing he could’ve in that moment. He’d smiled. One that wasn’t forced or manipulated. A genuine, heartfelt smile which said all that he couldn’t express.
Draco kept his gaze fixed firmly on the ground beneath him. He couldn’t look up. If he did, then it was all over. He wasn’t strong enough. He couldn’t deny Potter.
Draco nodded. “Me too.” He replied quietly, trying to forget about what he had just done.Theo gave him a small smile before leaning in. His lips brushed Draco’s carefully, with caution. Draco breathed in before deepening the kiss. He didn’t particularly feel anything. He couldn’t feel anything anymore. But he needed this. He needed something, anything. He needed to feel something other than emptiness.
Well, they had to have been if the downright hellish riddles Theo had seemed to have adapted was anything to go by.
She gave him a searching look, “I mean that you’re not happy.” She reiterated. “I see how you look at people. I know how you act.” She said matter-of-factly.
He should’ve tried harder to get Draco to come with them. He should’ve pulled, tugged, done anything to keep him safe. But he hadn’t. Because he was a failure. When it came down to it, Harry Potter was a coward.
She shook her head, “I guess not. Would it be so hard to believe that I genuinely wanted to sit with you.” She queried, and for the first time Draco Malfoy wondered if Hermione Granger was stupid.
Draco gave them a small smile. “Thank you. Both of you.” He said as earnestly as he could.
Her eyes shone with surprise, “Thank you, Draco.” She breathed and his name fell from her lips with minimal effort, but it was quite odd.
She shook her head. “but Harry Potter—” she started and Draco cut her off.
“I made a choice.” He carried on. “A poor one, and if I could go back and change it I would. But I can’t, so I have to adapt. I have to follow the wishes of the Dark Lord, and so do you. We’ll die.
She stared at him; her eyes wide with embarrassment. “Draco.” He sniffed. “I didn’t mean for you to see me like this. I didn’t mean for anyone to see me like this.” she told him and Draco vowed not to embarass nor upset her any more than she already was.
Just then, the door swung open and Potter came stomping in, followed by Hermione, Weasley and the Weaselette.
The tears were running freely down both of their faces. “The second I’d done it, I realised how much of a mistake it had been. I was a coward. A freak. A puppet. I was making my father’s choices not my own. I feel dirty. Worn. Used. I’ve been marked. My soul blackened. And I regret it. I’ll always regret it.” Potter finished.
chicken when you were shoving my mum’s homemade roast into your fat gob a few days ago?” he prompted, and Draco, once again, shook his head.
Okay, maybe he was expecting that in the sense that he already knew. But he hadn't by no means expected her to admit it so quickly. She was fearless.
Draco’s eyes filled with tears. “I’m sorry.” He choked out.
Draco arches against him. He barely knows what he’s doing. He just knows that he has to be closer. To have this with the person who accepts him. With the only person that he feels safe with. Who he feels at home with. Potter looks at him with determination, with pure awe and admiration as his hands move all over his back. His kisses become more demanding, and then he grips Draco’s arse, pulling him onto his lap. He was dizzy. He closes his eyes once more, and he can still feel him, can smell him, can’t taste anything but Potter. It’s harder now, louder.
He realised that right now Wizarding society was broken. People had lost family, friends, themselves. But, it would heal. They would all heal. They’d already begun healing. The smiles dusting many of the students faces proved that.
Draco glared at her. “Yes, we’re all absolutely bonkers, so why don’t you save yourself from having to endure our madness for any longer and take the bloody portkey.” He suggested with brute force.
Draco shot her a confused look, “Lie to you?” he asked.
No Theo, he wasn’t bloody listening to him. He had the whole plot to kill his Headmaster thing to think about. Seriously, people could be so inconsiderate.
Draco nodded, pulling the portkey from his pocket. “I can’t explain there’s not enough time.” He held out the portkey. “I need you to take it.”
Draco could do nothing but let the tears fall down his cheeks. He was awestruck. He realised that Potter hadn’t been his enemy. No, his biggest enemy had been himself.
“I can help you Draco, please let me help you.”
Potter, who looked murderous scoffed. “I can’t
He finished up his hair with a drying and setting charm, before looking at his reflection intently. Well he didn’t look…bad.
It pained him to be this vulnerable to someone. To give his heart so wholly to another. To have his whole life residing in one’s hands. The thought was terrifying. But if Draco had learned anything, it was that in order to love it wasn’t a matter of letting go of the fear but holding it close and embracing it.
“Stop this at once.” He ordered his manic aunt, his voice wavering, vomit crawling up his throat.
“I’m sorry Mrs Weasley but I—
“No, no, no. You don’t understand. I’ve done something bad. I’m going to do something bad.” He choked out, gasping deeply for air.
Draco wanted to scream. He wanted to tell Potter that he didn’t want to. That the nights kept him sane. That
He was tired of it. He was tired of his father always acting as if he was above everyone else, as if he were always right. Well, he wasn’t. Not this time.
It was all to much. It was all far too much.
Draco kept his eyes firmly shut. “I’ve been confused. I’ve just been so confused.” He started what Draco assumed was a long-winded explanation. “I’m meant to be the Saviour of the Wizarding World. I’ve meant to save everyone. I’m meant to get the girl. Marry Ginny. Become a true member of the Weasley family.” He sighed. “But it’s not like that.” He admitted.
Draco turned away from him. “That won’t be necessary.” He muttered trying to not let the guilt he felt consume him.
“Or is it Potter?” Blaise finished for her, and they both exploded into laughter.
He tried and was very sure failed to mask his confusion, as he secretly told himself to do better at this whole parenting thing. He gave her hands a squeeze, “what does that have to do with it?” he enquired.
She took a deep, wistful breath. “I remember the first time I knew that my love for your father was real.” Draco felt his stomach flip, not entirely sure he wanted to hear all about his parents love.
Draco’s heart sunk as he entered the Grand Foyer. The reconstruction work on the castle had been phenomenal, but just because you could no longer see the blood stains, didn’t mean that they weren’t there.
“I’m fine.” He said trying to come off as emotionless as possible, his heart hurt painfully in his chest at the action.
Draco felt his cheeks start to heat up. As he gazed down at the little girl who made him feel so safe.
He sighed before stepping away from Draco, “this is the person that you are without the manipulation, without the lies nor the deceit.” Theo gave Draco one last glance, “this is the person who you were before the world told you who you should be.” He whispered those few, parting words, before making his exit.
Draco rolled his eyes, “hunting hippogriffs” he bit out sarcastically and both boys glared. “What the fuck you
He shook his head profusely because it wasn’t meant to be this way. He didn’t deserve to have Kat here. She needed to be at home. She needed to be with her family. Not with him. Not with the man who had gotten her killed.
Wait, a second! Always followed him? Well, that was kind of... sweet.
that you’re going to hurt me.” she told him
He couldn't lie to her. Not anymore. Especially when she'd shown nothing but concern for his wellbeing. What kind of person did that make him?
Several seconds later, he opened his eyes, tears were trickling down his cheeks. The room was alive in colour. Surrounding them all were tiny little dots, the colour of the rainbow.
He pointed his wand under Draco’s chin. Crap. “
Draco arched against him. The way Potter looked at him, the way his hands move demandingly over his skin, drawing him closer. It’s perfect. His body is hard and real, thrumming with heat and desire. His kisses turn more passionate, as he turns them over, gripping Draco’s arse and pulling him onto his lap.
Draco had always had a sneaky feeling that the greasy haired git had always been jealous of his dazzling smile. Who wouldn’t be? It was fabulous.
The battle was in full swing. Rubble and plaster lined every inch of the floor, the walls were cracked and burned. The nights air smelt musty, but the breeze was cold, chilling him to the very bone. Curses, hexes, and jinxes were flying at and over his head, and Draco quickly brought up a shield. He’d rather be safe than sorry.
She gave him a reassuring pat. “Don’t worry, Draco. I’m not sad anymore. Well, not really.” She carried on. “It just means that I get two Christmases and two whole birthdays!” she said excitedly. “Mummy and Daddy still fight when they see each other, I think that mummy doesn’t like daddy’s new girlfriend.” She decided.
They stayed wrapped around one another as the sun came up. A new day, which symbolized, need, forgiveness and a deep understanding.
tell you is how much happier you were with him.” she reassured.
He was digesting the talk he’d had with his father several moments earlier. It had hurt him more than he could ever imagine. He thought that at the very least his father would listen to him. That he would try to understand him. He never would have thought that his father would brush off his words in such a way.
When he entered the Slytherin common room, he was dismayed to find all eyes on him. He sighed; couldn’t he catch a break?
Theo sighed. “You have to give me something here.” He was right. Draco did owe him something, but if he were honest, he had nothing to give.
. Draco could understand that. He could really understand that. He tried to picture himself in Potter's shoes, tried to feel what he possible felt.
His bed was uncomfortable. Why in Merlin’s name were satin sheets uncomfortable? What was the point in buying the best if it still wasn’t good enough? It was decided. Screw being a Potions Master! Draco was going to become a satin sheet expert, and that was that.
Sure enough, Kat turned to face her an evil look residing in her eyes. “Oh yes, we can be very, very scary.” She pulled out her wand. “Would you like to see how scary?” she questioned innocently.
What was he meant to say to that? What did Potter
“I’m a Hufflepuff.”
He watched with no regret as the light left his aunt’s eyes. That bitch had killed his best friend.
Draco glared at him, “What on
Pansy shot him a sad look. “I know you don’t. But you should. One of you is going to end up seriously hurt and I’ll bet my last Knut that it’ll be you.” She attempted.
Draco sulked. What was wrong with him? Draco knew that he was sarcastic, it was his proudest personality trait after all. But what was this? Wasn’t he trying to divert attention from himself, not encourage it? Self-preservation and all that Slytherin crap.
After several seconds, the boy nodded. “Okay, I
He’d made a choice. One out of fear. Out of pure desperation. Gone was the feeling of pride. Rejected was the tug of loyalty. Crushed his ambitions lay.
She pulled away from him. “Promise?”
His body shook with realisation. It all made sense. When Dumbledore offered him sanctuary but he’d refused. When he was having second thought about Rosmerta but went through with it anyway. Whenever his friends offered him help, but he’d ignored them.
Seriously? You had
In a spilt second, he felt strong arms pull on his own, lifting him up and seating him firmly onto the broomstick below him. Draco opened his eyes to the sight of the back of Harry Potter’s head.
Draco peered down at the small boy; he couldn’t have been older than twelve. He wondered what in Merlin's name was up with mini twelve year olds wanting his attention
Had he been this naïve when he was thirteen? No, not at all. He was just a mean, manipulative, little boy. So… the classic thirteen-year-old.
He sighed, “okay, tell me what’s wrong.” He told him and Draco decided to continue to act completely detached.
Kat shook her head, “I want to see the look on your face when you open it. So, open it. Open it. Open it!” she ordered excitedly.
tell me you’re riding that muggle death-trap Draco.” His father bit out angrily. “I swear to Merlin if you are I’ll—”
“Kat.”
Oh he hated her. How he hated her! He'd never liked the Weaselette, he'd always seen her as something close to a bully. And not like Draco had been, no, she was worse.
your fault. You sacrificed your memories. You sacrificed your love. You sacrificed your life so that Potter could live. You saved him by doing that, and by extension, you saved us all.” he finished as tears started to spill down his cheeks.
Potter nodded, “Draco this is Andromeda Tonks. Andromeda this is Draco Malfoy.” He gestured between them and Andromeda smiled in welcome.
He had hope that he was strong. He had hope that everything would be okay. He had hope to carry on. He had hope in life. He had hope in
This one was clever, but not clever enough. That was questionable actually considering she was a Ravenclaw. Didn't they have to solve riddles to gain access into their common room or something?
The aroma of freshly cooked sausages hit him like a tonne of bricks, and quite frankly it made him feel sick to his stomach.
His father let out something acute to a squeak, “Ah Potter—
Her words startled him. He knew for a fact that he wasn't the person she thought him to be. It was hard, being like this. Putting on a mask that he had become so accustomed to wearing that it seemed less of a mask than a second skin. Going through that everyday, being someone that he hated, but continuing to being that person anyway. It was harder than anyone could ever imagine it to be.
Draco knew that he shouldn’t walk towards it. That he shouldn’t draw any more attention to himself than he needed to. Alas, he found himself involuntarily walking slowly towards the pillar. His feet taking soft, curious steps as if they had a mind of their own.
Draco, just problem.” She chastised, glaring at him intently. “A Potter problem to be exact.” She finished with a knowing smirk.
what it’s called.” He spat out in annoyance, half of it directed at Potter, the other half at the stupid muggle device that had deemed itself too presige to cooperate.
She gave him a knowing look, “Different.” She said simply.
.’ Look that she knew he hated with a vengeance.
. We have a chance to do better. To be better than we were yesterday. You can’t go back and change the beginning, but you can start where you are and change the ending.”
Reluctantly, he scooted a little closer to the girl so that his knee was just touching hers. He opened the page onto a sketch of the lake, long, glowing, and vast. She gasped, a small hand flying towards her mouth.
That was the million dollar question. How
“No, that’s okay. You can keep your toilet.” He croaked quietly but firmly.
It wasn’t fair. None of this was fucking fair. And he felt like he was going to explode.
“So are we Draco.” Pansy sobbed out sadly and Draco’s heart clenched.
If were all to expose criminals to the same way in which they treated us, then we would be no better than them. Those who were not kissed were forced to spend part or the rest of their lives completely cut off from the world. Wasn’t that punishment enough?
be forgotten.
Draco opened his mouth to speak when… BRINGGGGGGGGGGGGGG
good enough for him. He didn't think he'd ever be. But he wanted to try. He wanted to try so badly.
Despite his better judgement he made his way towards the alcove and was shocked to find a crying Hermione. It unsettled him deeply, for as long as he'd known her, Hermione had always been so brave and strong.
“I want to be different. I want to be better. I want to become someone that I can love and be proud of. But I can’t” he sighed defeatedly. “I can’t and it’s all your fault. You taught me how to be this. You pressured me into getting me the mark. You filled my head with all these toxic ideas ever since I was a child. I never stood a fucking chance.”
Severus’ features softened whilst he contemplated his answer. “Well, I must say Mr Malfoy, you never fail to surprise me. I admit, that does sound like an acceptable plan.”
“You want to help?” Draco bit out unkindly. He felt his cheeks start to heat up, he wanted to make Potter understand. Somehow, he
“Uhm Mr Malfoy, sir.” A shy voice asked and Draco groaned. You had
But although vast, they felt empty.
, dating a Potter? It’s quite so very unthinkable.” He huffed.
Draco pulled back hastily, barely comprehending what he was hearing. He saved her? No, he had killed her. He was the reason that she was dead. She’d still be alive if it weren’t for him. His best friend would still be here to make him happy.
He returned Draco’s nod, “it’s nice to see that you’ve finally decided to pay your father a visit, son.” He said, trying and failing to hide his glee.
“Of course, I thought of it.” she said and she glared at him. “Besides, even if it doesn’t, you walk out of it with a kiss. It’s a win-win situation.” He decided.
Draco pondered this. “I’m not quite sure, I just know that I am.” He decided to shy away from the whole truth. He didn't need Weasley to help him, not when they'd just become friends.
Something inside Draco snapped as he marched towards the scene, “Stop this!” he growled, “stop this at once. You’re hurting her.” he yelled.
There was nothing wrong with him. This was war. Things happen during war. People die, people live. Shots are fired, shots are lost. It was normal. He
This girl had only known him for just over two days, and already she was buying him gifts, doing all that was in her power to make him smile. It was kindness that he shouldn't have and quite honestly, a kindness that he didn't deserve.
Draco beamed. “Well I’m extremely happy to see you.” he said honestly.
“Draco is not stupid.” Kat barked, glaring at the boy.
“Come back to me!” he yelled and the bloodied figure, “I need you. Please, please come back to me.”
. It had almost killed him to get here. To make it to this moment. But he had made it. He had
“Is it really?” she asked and Draco nodded. “She’s stunning, you look just like her.” she mused.
“Who?” he asked, with genuine interest.
Traitors!
“Is that supposed to upset me?” he narrowed his eyes at her. “if you hadn’t noticed, I couldn’t care less.” His lips curled into a sneer as he watched her waver, “now if we’re quite done, I’d like to go to bed.”
He looked at hesitantly, “I was?” he whispered quietly, as if he was struggling to believe what she was saying.
He was almost there. She was right in front of him. He was going to make it. He was going to save her.
“Of course, not you idiot. The Hufflepuff's! Stop stealing the Hufflepuff's.” Smith exclaimed and Macmillan nodded. A nod? Really? A bloody nod! Was this guy mute or something?
Draco had to admit, the Headmaster had that one coming. You don't simply interact with a man that's just gone off the edge, and expect not to get burned. It just wasn't possible.
Mudbloods following him.” he finished, lying straight through his teeth.
Kat’s eyes turned to stone. “Ever since someone thought it was okay to harm our Draco.” She growled and the other Hufflepuff's nodded frantically, their eyes ablaze with an anger that Draco had no idea that Hufflepuff's were even capable of.
Ahhh so they've kissed!! Harry went OFF! Put Dumbledore in his place, Harry! A hint for next chapter: Blood, lot's of blood.
Suddenly, the walls started to shake and Draco turned his neck just in time to see that a mound of rubble was just about to collapse over a Weasley twin.
Hermione slapped him on the arm. “Hey!” Weasley shouted, rubbing his injured arm. “What was that for?” he gave her a scathing look. It was her own fault, no one should come between a man and his chicken.
He laughed. “Hush Draco. Instead of telling me to ‘shut up’ why don’t you pay more attention to getting that stick out of your arse.”
She gave him a curt nod. “Yes.” She answered simply, with a hint of suspicion. “May I ask why you’re here?” she questioned. Her voice was tired, and Draco’s heart broke for her.
The courtroom broke out in celebration, and Draco’s heart had clenched with relief. It was over. It was all over. He had looked up into the crowd of smiling faces only for his eyes to settle on Potter. Because of course, it was always Potter. They had shared a smile that was only reserved for the two of them, and for the first time, Draco felt as if the future was bright.
He scoffed. “What an ever so informative analysis, Healer. So far I’ve learned nothing.” He retorted giving her an annoyed look. “Wait!” he said frantically. “I think I’ve actually learnt something. It’s small but it’s there. Maybe if I just focus my energy on the wrackspurts then I could just….”
Draco looked his uncle dead in the eye, “well” he started, “I wasn’t planning on telling them, so unless you’re stupid enough to say anything, I think I’ll be okay.” He mused.
Listening, even if it were only for a few moments. He had to know. He had to know if Potter was safe. Potter gave him hope. If Potter were alive then everything would be alright. The Dark Lord wouldn’t take over. And Draco would be okay. Even if that was in Azkaban. At least he would be alive.
Hermione rolled her eyes. “What am I going to do with you?” she tutted, but Draco could see the affectionate glint in her eye. Well, that was new. Had it always been there?
Draco raised an eyebrow, “and what game would that be?” he questioned, he had a sneaky suspicion that they were playing a game right now.
When Draco entered the Slytherin common room the amicable chatter came to a stop.
Theo narrowed his eyes, taking a step closer towards him. “That’s the fucking problem Draco. You haven’t done anything!” he accused, and if Draco was secretly planning his death, then so be it.
Draco sighed. “I really don’t know what to say other than I’m sorry.” he said genuinely. There truly wasn't anything he could say. After all, he seemed to have been to one to cause this mess in the first place.
Father would be so proud. Draco was following in his footsteps.
It wasn't so much that he didn't want to share his artwork more than he was certain that he wasn't very good at it. Art was his sanctuary, it was a place where he could express himself and not be judged. Showing someone... well, that ruined everything.
“I didn’t know if you were even alive. I prayed you were. I begged and pleaded every day. It almost became too much, I almost let go. But I realised, that I had to carry on. That I had to keep strong. The sooner the war ended, the sooner I’d see you. You were the only thing that kept me going. What keeps me going.” He whispered his eyes laced with emotion.
But he had to keep going. He couldn’t go back and change the beginning, but he could start where he was and change the end. And he chose to be good.
Theo looked at him in shock, “and how do you feel now?” he asked.
Hermione glanced at Weasley before turning to look at Pansy and Blaise, she let out a sigh, “ we
Quickly, he pulled his wand own, his body slowly filling with anger and resentment. “Get out of my way.” He ordered.
Piggy opened her mouth to speak but was abruptly cut off by Kat. “Yes Draco, your signal was
Ms Pritchett took a step back, collapsing into an armchair. Her face was red, her eyes were puffy with tears. She looked to be in a state of disbelief. “No. I don’t believe you. It can’t be true. It
After transfiguration, Draco brushed any attempts that Vincent and Greg made for him to join them in the common room. He gave them the pathetic excuse that he needed to do something. And that is how Draco now found himself, sketchbook in hand, sitting under a tree. Alone.
Potter stood up abruptly. “Now he doesn’t even do that. When I talk to him, he walks away. When he sees me, he walks in a different direction. He doesn’t respond to my touches or voice. And it’s only been a day. It’s only been a fucking
Pansy raised a triumphant brow. “Shut up.” He mumbled.
“Why doesn’t it matter?" he questioned intently.
Kat was his saving grace. She was the light in all the darkness that surrounded him. She’d taught him bravery. She’d taught him determination. She’d taught him love. She showed him how to be
Macmillan nodded. “Yes, that.” he told him, and Draco wanted to hex him.
He shrugged. “Sorry if this sounds crude, but I honestly couldn’t give a fucking shit what that noseless bastard thinks.” He bit out defiantly.
was he now?
He had done what was necessary.
He shrugged. “Why change perfection?” he preened, not believing his words in the slightest. But they were funny, nevertheless.
He was too baffled to speak. Is that really how he sounded? It was unseemly. Draco shook his head, wait a second…. He had done WHAT?!
He missed his mother dearly. He even missed his father. But they’d never had a Christmas like this. Despite how wonderful the Christmas were when he’d been younger, they’d never been this… warm.
Draco chuckled. “Yes, they’re stupid.” He took a deep breath. “I just want to tell you how grateful I am that I found you that day outside the Slytherin dorms. You’ve changed my life for the better.” He choked out.
He was ready to risk his life, to lose it all in favour of doing the right thing. Of staying true to himself. That was his Hufflepuff talking. The part of him that he secretly never wanted to let go.
So that’s exactly what he did. He followed the scream.
Her eyes widened, glistening with something other than desperation, something that looked a lot like acceptance. “Take me to her. Take me to my little girl.” She asked in defeat and all Draco could do is oblige as he held out a hand to take them both to a place he’d never wanted to go back to.
It worked! It had actually worked. He felt relief rush through him knowing that one more innocent world be safe.
Draco shrugged. “I don’t know. This. Life.
He turned slightly red, “yes well, I guess that’s what I’m doing.” he decided.
Draco wanted chocolate.
(See the end of the chapter for
He growled, “Well, I’m
How was wrapping presents not some kind of sport?
His mother sighed, reaching out to grab his other arm. “I don’t think any of us can truly trust our feelings. But if they’re real, we’ll know.”
It sickened him that in a few days’ time, Draco would betray the man he cared most about. It had to be done. There was no other choice.
A child. He was best friends with a child. It was pathetic. Absolutely pathetic!
He munched half-heartedly on his buttered toast when he felt a small tap on his shoulder. He turned around swiftly to find a smiling Kat.
She cackled. “Silly boy.” She gave him a toothy grin, “don’t you know that sharing is so much better?” She moved closer towards him whilst shooting him a predatory glance, “besides, I think you’ll do quite nicely.”
Abruptly, Draco stood up and started to walk back towards the castle. He was a coward. Draco was dangerous. He was a Death Eater. Draco had to save him from himself.
He shrugged with disinterest. “What’s it to you?” he asked with a slightly accusatory edge to his voice.
“It’s been a day Malfoy. Only a day since you ‘broke’ off whatever the hell was going on with you two and Harry’s a mess.” he gave Draco a look of concern.
He took a shaky breath, he was ready.
Not like this. Not anymore.
Death Eater.” He snarled, trembling where he stood.
He didn’t want to breathe. Not anymore. The one thing that he’d thought about. The reunion that he’d so desperately craved. The one and only person that had kept him going, was gone.
“I don’t think that’s a good idea.” Draco choked out, full of guilt.
She sighed angrily, “That’s enough.” She stated and Weasley nodded.
Potter was treading on deep waters now. It was one thing to insult Draco on his own. But to bring his friends into it? That was an all time low.
“Let’s start on the potion.” Draco suggested and Weasley nodded, both knowing the sooner they started, the better.
“I’ve been well.” He choked out as formally as he could.
He felt the warm hand of Pansy entwine with his, as he cried silent tears. The Headmistress carried on, “she helped those who she could. She loved those who needed it. She accepted those who couldn’t accept themselves.” She choked out whilst pulling out a ‘Draco Malfoy Pride’ badge and pinning it onto her robe.
Weasley looked at him as if he were stupid. “To the land of chicken.” He said as if it were obvious, and Draco thought about asking what in the hell that was, but decided against it.
A smile as large as space lit up her features making her eyes sparkle. “Hi Draco, whatchya doing?” she asked, curiously peering at his sketchbook.
Potter sighed. “If you’re wondering how I got in here, and I know that you are, you gave it to me in second year.” He answered and Draco gave him a confused look.
When she’d first told him that, he’d barely understood it. Maybe it was because he was seven at the time, or maybe it was because he just wasn’t that smart. He gulped, yeah, it was probably because he was only seven. Draco wasn’t anything but smart.
It wasn’t right to align himself with The Dark Lord. It wasn’t right to bare his mark. It wasn’t easy to have his home ripped from him. It wasn’t easy to see his mother withering in pain at the hands of a crucio. It wasn’t as easy as to flock over to the order and leave his mother to die. It wasn’t bloody well easy to renounce everything he was brought up to believe, but still be trapped in a destiny that had already been decided for him. So, Draco didn’t have a choice between right and easy. He had a choice between life and death, and he’d chosen the latter.
He sighed, not much fancying talking about his health much longer, “What’s the time?” he asked.
He glanced at the excited first years. Them all so naïve, almost ignorant to some of the pained faces around them. They just saw Hogwarts for what it was. Not a place of blood, death, and battle, but a place that many went to learn, to smile, a place that we could all call
His hand was on the door when the Headmaster called out “Mr Malfoy.” Draco turned back round. “Please do look into controlling your Hufflepuff's, we wouldn’t want anyone else to suffer how poor Mr Smith has suffered today.” His eyes twinkled with mischief.
Well, she had nothing to be ashamed of, and he was determined to make her see that. He lifted her chin gently, so that her eyes were locked onto his. “Now you listen to me and you listen to me closely.” He told her seriously.
The bird was beautiful.
Of course, this thing with Potter hadn’t got any less confusing. He continued to meet Potter every night at the Great Lake, watching the stars until they were hidden by the sun. Potter told him his biggest secrets, his deepest fears, what made him happy and what made him sad. They never spoke of the Weaselette incident.
“Who am I partnered with?” he asked absently, as he looked around the classroom. Judging by the red-faced Weasel and the empty space next to him, Draco made an educated guess.
Draco shook his head. “It’s alright Myrtle. It’s okay.” He reassured the quivering girl, before turning his attention back on Potter.
to be wrong.” He bit out in frustration, squeezing his pencil tip so hard into his hand that he was sure to draw blood..
He stopped a few steps in front of the pillar and took a deep breath. “Who’s there?” he asked, embarrassed to find that his voice started to waver.
He entered the Great Hall in a haste, his shoulders sagged, his eyes were baggy.
Draco could took a deep breath. He had to calm down, he couldn’t make a scene. Not now, definitely not now.
In all honesty, he had actually started to become quite partial towards the Hufflepuff's. Maybe it was their innocent smiles, or excited laughs, he didn't know. But whatever it was he felt the need to squash it. And he had to do it now!
Was this what he got for being a little bit truthful? How rude. If this was how people were going to act whenever he told the truth, then he would cease to do it. He’ll become the classic lying, scheming Slytherin that everyone used to think he was.
the time.” that was something that he so desperately wanted. Optimum happiness. It sounded like a dream.
She nodded, “I’m scared she admitted.” and Draco felt his face start to flush. It was the worst thing to hear that your child was fearful.
“Morning.” Potter greeted huskily and Draco turned around to face him.
“Am I?” he asked playfully.
Draco couldn’t sleep.
“You can’t stay here!” Hermione shrieked. “They’ll kill you.”
It was over. Ruined. He was ruined.
He sighed, “you’re right, you’re right.” he repeated. “I’ve just received some unsavoury news from home, that’s all.” he admitted truthfully. Because it wasn't a lie, not really.
“Draco,” his mother spoke softly and Draco eye’s snapped up immediately. It was the first time his mother had spoken to him in over a year. His mother, his beautiful, brave, compassionate mummy. “Come.” She whispered, nodding her head warmly.
Moaning Myrtle. He'd heard all about her, but he'd only managed to catch a few glimpses of her over the years. That was mainly due to the fact that she hardly ever left her bathroom. And well, it wasn't as if Draco was actively looking for her. She wasn't someone that you particularly wanted to find.
The Death Eater crossed his arms, glaring and him intently. “And what do you think you’re doing?” he sneered.
that Draco’s nose twitched whenever he was thinking. Draco didn’t know anything. He had no bloody clue. He didn’t know what made Potter happy. He didn’t know what made him sad. He didn’t know the names of his parents or what his childhood was like. He didn’t know why he liked Draco. Or even why Draco bloody liked him. He didn’t know a thing!
He sat down on his bed, running a tired hand through his silvery locks, what could he do? Perhaps he could seduce the Death Eater in question? Draco shook his head at that, it had too much potential to go wrong, plus Draco wasn’t admittedly looking his best. He could devise a plan to trick the Death Eater? Draco sighed, no that wouldn’t work either, it would take too much time.
He wasn’t going to be subjected to the ‘Potter tried to provoke him using first year insults’ incident part two. Not a-bloody-gain.
Hermione was his friend. The friend who had forgiven him for his previous vile behaviour. The friend who tutored him in transfiguration and sat with him in the library. The friend who comforted him when he was sad and vice versa. He wouldn’t allow his aunt to do anything to her. He couldn’t let it happen. Not again.
Draco shrugged. “Not that it’s any of your business, but I was running.” He answered.
wait for you.” He whispered, before closing the door, praying that Potter would come back to him.
His mind became fuzzy, his eyes became glassy as his memories were ripped from him. He forgot the smile that Harry only saved for him. He forgot the endless nights they spent wrapped around each other under the nights sky, the stars their only witnesses. He forgot Harry’s laugh. He forgot how Harry felt as he made love to him. He forgot their days together, their notes. He forgot the first time he’d told Harry that he loved him…
“I’ll
He came to a stop as his eyes fell on Weasley and Hermione, they were both sitting on the Grand stairs, they both looked defeated.
Draco smiled. He remembered when he was a first year and the castle seemed like a colossal, daunting establishment. He was awfully familiar of it now, but he still found it to be quite large.
Of fucking course he found that hard to believe. He wasn't as barmy as everyone else apparently was, he actually remembered the git he used to be.
He gave her an embarrassed look, “I’m sorry for breaking down like that.” He apologised authentically.
Draco flipped them off. “That is none of your business.” He informed them whilst mentally reminding himself to ask Potter about a potential Daddy kink.
Draco was walking back to the Slytherin dorms, his heart heavy and his shoulder sagged.
He was taken aback by that. As far as he knew, he was quite similar to everyone else. Morally wise, okay maybe he was a little different, but everything else was the same.
Draco shook his head frantically. “I don’t care. I don’t care.” He spat out in panic.
Draco started to laugh manically. “My condolences, but I’m afraid I don’t care much as to what you want. I’ve spent sixteen years of my life caring and look where it’s gotten me.” He seethed at his father. “I’ve betrayed those that I care about. I’ve broken relationships that mean much to me. I’ve got the symbol of everything I fight against tattooed on my arm. And that’s all because of you.”
“Everything’s going to be alright, dear one.” She reassured as he pulled himself from her embrace.
He shook his head looking down at his feet. Why didn’t she understand? Why didn’t anybody understand?
But it didn't matter, Draco was a lying expert.
Draco took a deep breath. “He’s kind to me. He tells me wonderful stories. He’s patient with me. He doesn’t ask for more than I’m willing to offer. He makes me feel special. He makes me feel safe.” He said, half-admitting it all to himself.
His father was right, he’d done it to himself.
I’m doing?”
Madam Pomfrey tutted, “I see that almost dying hasn’t changed you one bit.” She observed.
“I’m here too.” Harry told his father, mischief dancing in his eyes. And Draco braced himself for whatever he had planned.
“Do you seriously want to die?” Severus asked him seriously and he shook his head.
He felt his skin start to prickle. “But now I know that you were wrong. That I was wrong. The Dark Lord isn’t strong. He isn’t brave or admirable. He’s weak. He cowers behind his followers. He’s merciless, cruel, and wrong. And I hate it. I hate him.” he declared.
It was if he were in a dream. A beautiful dream that he never wanted to end. Potter loved him. Potter
He took a shaky breath, “I’m Draco Malfoy and I—
“Where are you going?” Theo questioned, eyeing him sceptically.
Liars. The lot of them were liars. Draco just had to make friends with over two dozen mini little Hufflepuff’s. He had to just get to know every single last one of them individually. A few Gryffindor, Ravenclaw and Slytherin first-years just had to join the Draco Malfoy Pride. And of bloody course Draco just
tell me what I feel for you. You’re my rock. You’re the reason I wake up in the mornings. Why I keep on fighting. You saved me Draco.” He whispered before bringing him for a kiss.
“When I stopped caring.” Draco answered blankly, before pushing off the wall and walking towards the dungeons, leaving a worried Severus in his wake.
Pansy eyed him sceptically. “Are you sure?” she questioned. “Because it always has something to do with Potter.” She said, and that was true in a sense.
Draco was outside on the school grounds, the Death Eater’s running manically in front of him. Victory dusting every last one of their features.
it’s true. I saw it when I looked into his eyes. They were full of bafflement and misunderstanding. They weren’t his eyes. They weren’t
The knowledge hurt him. Scared him, even. But he’d realised something. This time, he had a choice. He really did have a choice. He could choose to be selfish and put the girl who was like a sister to him in harm’s way. Or, he could get her out of Hogwarts. He could get her to her family where she would hopefully be safe.
Well, she was wrong.
Draco smiled slightly as he put his pencil to parchment for the first time in days. He finally knew what to draw. Something that made him happy.
He found himself laughing at that. A chicken... what?
.  What was she doing here?
Sometimes, just sometimes he wondered what would happen if he confided in Severus. If he told him all that was wrong in his life. Would Severus listen? Would he understand? Would he
That made his heart swell. Draco loved his mother more than anything, she had always been the one person that had stuck by him through thick and thin. The
Draco opened up his sketchbook, basking in the new smell. It was divine.
He wasn't even sure if he wanted to.
“Not so fast.” Slughorn boomed, and Draco wanted to hex the man where he stood. “I have yet to announce the project that you and your assigned partners will have to complete.” Draco cringed looking between his assigned partner and the twinkle in Slughorn’s eyes.
Draco was in hell.
The person he’d always been too afraid to be. Theo’s words rattled inside his head frantically. He’d never thought about it like that. He’d just assumed that had changed, that war had morphed him into a different person.
Potter frowned slightly, “I didn’t have any toys. Or family. Or friends.” Draco sighed, he knew how that felt. He wished he didn't but he did.
Pansy glared at him all through transfiguration and he convinced himself that he didn’t care. Because he didn’t! Care, that is.
Maybe Draco was overreacting, maybe Theo wasn't going to ask what he thought he was going to ask. He probably wanted to know what hair products Draco used, he couldn't blame him, His hair was flawless.
“Language, Ronald!” Mrs Weasley tutted and Weasley turned a deep shade of red.
No problem Potter? Really? That vein on your forehead threatening to explode days differently.
In all honesty, he would have left even if he had no where in particular to go. Theo's questions were becoming too much. It was
“Onwards.” Weasley shouted dramatically and Draco laughed before following him to the kitchens.
Draco took a double take, it wasn’t just Hufflepuff's. No, it was
Draco shifted in his seat, “Of course not.” He attempted to come off as genuine.
“I’m not outwardly renouncing the Dark Lord. I’m helping him.” he said quickly in an attempt to divert the heat from him.
Draco sighed out dramatically. He was exhausted. Being nice was so overrated.
Death was supposed to be far less painful than this, he thought.
“And what exactly was I meant to be doing?” he asked.
Suddenly, two arms wrapped around his waist, picking him up and turning him around. Draco’s heart stopped as he looked into the eyes of Harry Potter. Silvery grey on emerald green. He could hardly believe his eyes.
The Headmistress took one last strong breath, “we’ve been given a second chance. It’s time we forget how to survive and begin to learn how to live.” She finished and the entire hall erupted into applause, tears dusting all faces.
And Draco wanted to survive. Yes, survival now, he could live later.
Potter took another step towards him, “I want you to talk to me. I want you to tell me what’s wrong. I want to help.” He said honestly.
“You act like you’re fine. You laugh when you need to. You smile at myself and my friends.” She started. “You act like you’re happy. But you’re not. I know that you’re not.” She finished.
It all clicked.
a coward.”
Weasley took a deep breath, “calm down mate, why don’t we take this outside yeah?” he said carefully.
With a deep breath, Draco walked out of the common room and to the only place where he felt truly free.
It wasn’t perfect. It was far from perfect. Potter would call him names, Draco refused to speak to him. It was unexpected, fragile, and scary. But it was also wonderful. Their nights made him feel like everything was okay. That there was no Dark Lord or that he was a Death Eater. No, Potter made him feel like Draco. Just
give me any more excuses. You
He shrugged, putting on the façade that he knew all too well. “I made my peace with that fact a long time ago.” He mocked. “Life just becomes so much greater when you accept such fickle things like that.” He said.
Draco let go of the body as two warm hands wrapped him into a strong embrace. “It’s okay. It’s okay.” The loving voice of Mrs Weasley repeated over and over soothingly.
Where were they? Where were they? He absently thought as Draco grabbed hold of a velvet green coloured box. Found them.
“Malfoy.” An ugly sneer snapped him from his thoughts.
He sighed; his father wasn’t finished yet. “Stupid Potter.” He mumbled. “Stupid Potter, and his stupid hair and his stupid scar.” He bit out and Draco couldn’t contain his laughter for one second longer.
“That’s quite the surprise you gave me there." That was an understatement, he was still attempting to catch his heart that had conveniently ventured into his mouth.
But the nights, the nights, they were something to be treasured. They made him feel special, wanted. Draco didn’t speak, nor respond. No, he just listened and felt. He listened to the gentle deepness of Potter’s tone; he felt his heart skip a beat whenever they hands fused together. Potter made him feel safe, accepted, wanted. He couldn’t give that up. He wouldn’t give that up for the world.
He knew that it was a lot to ask. He knew that a Death Eater like him hardly deserved something as beautiful as happiness. But he was willing to try.
Although, instead of walking out the doors he took a sharp turn left, an annoyed look dusting his features as he made his way towards the Slytherin table, to Draco’s complete dismay and surprise.
Nathan narrowed his eyes at him. “Really? Because that is exactly what a crazy person would say.” He declared, and yes it was decided, he was officially a crazy person.
He looked the same as he always did. His eyes were molten silver, his jaw fixed, mouth red and pouted. But something was wrong.
“Why?” she questioned.
“Really?” his daughter chirped out, bouncing up and down in her seat. “That would be wonderful.” She mused, giving Harry an almighty grin.
His relationship with Potter had been going from strength to strength, and it were those moments spent with him, that Draco felt happiest.
“That wasn’t very nice.” Kat pointed out and Draco’s heart swelled at her innocence.
Blaise tutted. “Now, now Pansy. No need to be so dramatic, Annie here is obviously extremely scared.” He said patronisingly.
Draco and Potter were sitting by the lake, the stars above them, shimmering in the moonlight. Their hands entwined together; palms sweaty.
Draco pulled abruptly away from her, suddenly feeling a wave of anger pass through him. “I never have a fucking choice.” He shouted. “I thought I had the choice of choosing to become a Death Eater. Well, I bloody didn’t. I thought I had a choice to not kill my Headmaster. Nope, don’t have that either. I thought I could chose whether or not to let Death Eaters into Hogwarts. Oh, would you fucking look at that. Still no bloody choice.” He spat out hysterically.
Hearing Potter so distraught, so confused, and knowing that it was because of him was a terrible feeling. He didn't know what to do. He could hardly say anything, even if he were permitted to talk to Potter. There was nothing he could possibly say that would make this any better.
His father remained silent for several more seconds. A silent Malfoy… that was never a good sign. Draco braced himself for the worst.
“I don’t give two craps if it was unhealthy or not. It was mine. He was mine.” He howled, tears glistening the crests of his eyes
Obviously not, so Draco better remind him, and carry on to spend the rest of their days reminding him. “Of course, but don’t let it go to your head.” He started. “I can stop thinking about you just as quickly as I started.” He threatened light heartedly.
a ray of sunshine. Questioning and doubting Draco's every move, he just
He took a deep breath as he faced his father, putting his hands safely into his robe pockets. His father looked well considering. His hair was a little longer, but was still prestige, nevertheless. His pale skin was lighter but not sickly. His eyes were sunken but still twinkled with light. All and all, Draco was quite pleased to see his father as close to healthy as he could possibly be whilst in Azkaban.
He was tired. He was so bloody tired. Of everything. Of the pain. Of the suffering. Of whatever he felt towards Potter. He didn’t exactly know how he felt, but he knew that it was quite strong. There was no point denying it. Draco Malfoy cared about Harry Potter.
Nevertheless, Draco’s eyes filled with tears and he wondered what he had done to deserve such a beautiful friend.
“Are you okay?” Kat whispered in concern, her ‘Draco Malfoy Pride’ badge shining proudly.
Draco howled, rocking back and forth, not knowing what to do with himself. Not knowing how to deal with the pain. “He’s gone. He’s gone.” He sobbed out as he desperately clutched the ring that hung round his neck.
“Goodnight Draco.” She gave him one last genuine grin before disappearing into the dorm.
“We heard what he’d done to you and we wanted revenge.” A mini Hufflepuff boy said angrily.
Draco shook his head violently. “No, no. Not Potter.” He sputtered.
Stupid Hufflepuff’s.
“Chicken date?” Draco questioned. “Are you sure that you’re doing okay Weasley?” he mocked.
“It’s also rude not to share.” Weasley countered. “But you don’t see me telling Malfoy off for his lack of manners.” He pointed out through mouthfuls of food.
Now he knew better.
His father shook his head, his eyes wider than Draco had ever seen them. “You must not think like that. I will not let you.” He spat.
he felt it. And that was something he had to do on his own.
He shook his head. “Don’t worry Draco, I’ll never do anything to hurt her. I love her.” he chirped before walking away, a spring in his step.
“And why don’t
. Draco seemed to hurt everyone he touched these days. But hearing that he'd hurt Potter. Knowing all that he had done to him. He realised that hurting Potter was worse that all the others he'd hurt combined. It pained him that he didn't know
Draco patted the ground next to him. The small, little gesture meaning so much.
He glanced down at the floor, “yes well, you can tell them—
his mother back.
His father shifted slightly where he stood, and Draco wondered what in Merlin’s name he wanted. Their last conversation hadn’t been exactly ideal, and the Malfoy heir hadn’t spoken to his father since. He hadn’t wanted to.
Draco shrugged. “What’s wrong with being a little mad. Normal is totally overrated.” He teased the baffled girl.
Several minutes later and Draco realised that no matter how much he wished it, Potter was here to stay. Reluctantly, Draco collected his artwork and got ready to leave. Like hell was he staring here with ‘I take pleasure in insulting Draco Malfoy’ Potter. He stood up quickly ready to leave when a voice stopped him in his tracks.
, and then tells Draco off for a simple cordial greeting. It was typical. So fucking typical of him.
“There you are!” Kat sighed out as soon as Draco got outside. “I thought that you’d never come out.” she walked up to him quickly, a giant smile lighting up her entire face.
Draco took a quick glance at the man cuddled next to him and felt a sinking feeling in the pits of his stomach. He knew what he wanted to do. Of what he had to do.
So, the Hogsmeade weekend had crept up on him out of nowhere. He was getting ready for his date with Theo. Well, he would’ve been if he hadn’t been dragged into an empty classroom by a red-faced, angry Snape.
Defeated, Draco nodded. “I’m just so confused. So many of my friends are telling me all about this great and wonderful romance that I shared with Harry Potter. But I can’t remember any of it.” He looked up at his mother with pleading eyes, “how do I know my feelings are real if I don’t remember how I got them?” he asked.
It was a bit like the students back at Hogwarts. They’d fake every scream, every cry. Draco was seen as somewhat of a hero back at the castle. That thought couldn’t be more unsettling. He wasn’t a hero; he was a fraud who had gotten them all into that situation in the first place. He’d been the one to let Death Eater’s into Hogwarts. He was the reason that Albus Dumbledore was dead. It was all his fault.
, for all that you have done. And for saving my son. You will always be welcome in our home. You’re a part of us now, you’re stuck with us for the long run.” She said authentically, squeezing him that little bit tighter.
Kat’s eyes widened, shining with fresh tears. “You’ll help me make some friends?”
“Draco Malfoy Pride!” he shouted deliriously, waving the purple badge around frantically.
He couldn’t. He knew deep down that his father loved him. That he wanted nothing but the best for him, despite the twisted way in which he showed that. He’d been so close to loosing everything. He
It was if he was cursed. Crabbe let out an almighty cry as he began to loose his grip. Instinctively, Draco reached out a hand, grabbing his hand with his own. He hand was wet and sweaty, but Draco hung on as tightly as he could.
Victory had never tasted so great!
What to do,
He wanted to cry. He wanted to yell. To shake his mother and beg her to stop. He wanted to tell her broken he was. That some nights he desperately wished he’d fall into a peaceful sleep that he’d never wake from.
He took a brave breath, “You may have made your choice, but you made my choice for me.” He gestured to the mark that was ingrained onto his skin.
“Why do we need all of those?” Jerry butted in and Draco saw red, he pulled his wand out waving it at the boy frantically.
Several moments later, and his father turned back to Draco giving him a curt nod. Draco breathed a sigh of relief, as he smiled his father before standing up and turning to Potter. He gave Potter a nod similar to that of his father’s as he followed him out of the Great Hall, and away from his parents.
His eyes gleamed with glee, “I’m going to become a chicken specialist.” He declared proudly, and it was out in the open. The two words Draco had been waiting for.
She shook her head. “Don’t thank me, it was a team effort.” Draco chuckled she was such a Hufflepuff. “Anyhow, I best be getting back now, it’s almost curfew.” she told him and he agreed, it was getting pretty late. The last thing he wanted as for her to get in trouble because of him.
to be coming to an end.” Draco commented. “Because why else would Ronald Billius Weasley actually be doing potions work?” he teased.
Suddenly, the door clinked and Draco’s heart sunk.
Potter narrowed his eyes at her. “Calm down?” he snarled. “You want me to fucking clam down.” He swore. “Well, guess fucking what. I’m. Not. Fucking. Calm.”
“Well there was that one time you shaved all of Blaise’s hair off because you feared it was nicer than yours.” Pansy countered.
He was just about to give up and throw a rather large rock into the late when Potter plumped down next to him.
grey.
Potter shook his head. “But it hurts Hermione. It hurts so much.”
He couldn’t speak. The Weasley’s felt that strongly about him? He didn’t know. He never would have guessed.
She howled with laughter, pushing her face so close to his that their lips were almost touching. “If you get a chance..” she said in an odd calm tone, “Say hi to the little voice in your head for me.” His aunt sneered before returning back to Kat.
“Don’t you DARE call any of them that!” He roared, pointing his wand at his aunt.
“It’s not our fault you two are acting like sensitive little Hufflepuff's.” Blaise spat back.
Draco carried on. “I understand that it must be disheartening knowing that you were tossed into Hufflepuff because you was hardly wanted by the other house. That must’ve hurt but it’s okay.”
“But do I think you’re dirty? No. Do I think that you’re tainted. Of course, not. Will I stay away from you? No chance in hell.” He carried on looking straight into Draco’s eyes. “You’re not a terrible person Draco. You’ve apologised to Ron and Hermione, you’re even good friends now. You help those in need. You make people happy. You stood by me even after all the crap I’d put you through. Hell! You’re even best friends with Hufflepuff’s.”
That hardly mattered. He felt his restraint dwindle as he glanced at the arm where the dark mark lay, covered by his robes. He was no longer Draco Malfoy, Slytherin Prince. He was weak. A follower. He wasn’t anything but a single choice.
Potter mutters a wandless spell before his inserts one finger deep into Draco’s heat. “Fuck!” Draco whimpers, arching up against him. He pushes in further and Draco clenches around this thick, lubed finger.
Her face lit up as soon as her eyes landed on Scorpius. “And who do we have here?” she teased, grabbing him from Harry’s hands and spinning him around. “Have you been a good boy Scorpius?” she asked as Scorpius nodded frantically, clapping his hands with glee.
Draco was on his way to track his next Muggleborn, when he heard a cry come from a hidden alcove.
Her entire face lit up as she passionately went off on a tangent about her first encounter with Professor Snape and that she didn’t think he was as bad as everyone had said. Claiming that all he needed was a mug of hot cocoa and a hug.
He pointed his wand at him in threat and hopefully power. The Headmaster carried on but Draco paid him no mind, the ring that hung safely around his neck started to pulse. It hot and heavy. Reminding him of what he was. Of what he could never be. Of all that he was going to lose.
Suddenly Draco shot up, eyes wide with possibility. It could work! It could, it could, he was sure of it. He needed to be quick, it needed to be planned accurately. He only had one chance. But it could really work. He could really get out of here.
Draco rolled his eyes, “I know. Stop acting like I’m stupid, I
He could say that he’d made a family in the Weasley’s, they treated him as if he were a part of it anyhow. At times, he felt guilty of how he used to view and speak about them, but now he felt as if he was making up for it. He was immensely glad that he had distanced himself from his bigotry views, that decision had allowed him to love and befriend the most wonderful people.
And he knew that he was going to continue to be strong. It was the only choice he had.
“SHUT THE FUCK UP!” Draco screamed jumping to his feet, ignoring the startled looks he was receiving. “IT’S JUST CHICKEN FOR MERLIN’S SAKE!” he screamed again, as Weasley rounded on him in a blink of an eye.
She shifted closer to him, entwining her hand with his. “No, you’re not.” She said defiantly. “You’re the strongest person that I know.” she told him, and no, no, NO! That wasn't right. That wasn't what she was meant to say.
“Okay.” Theo said as Draco started walking towards the bathroom, promptly ignoring Potter’s angry gaze burning holes in his back.
he offered him help.
And for the first time he realised that he and Potter weren't all that different. No they were just two boys, that were born into a web of impossible expections. They were just two boys that the world had set their sights on, telling them
He nodded. “I know. I should’ve realised the manipulative bastard that Smith was long ago.” He admitted again and Draco was weirdly proud.
He still hated Potter. He hated Potter with his whole being. But after all, you could still hate someone and need them just as much.
Draco shook his head, edging closer towards the boy. “Let me let you in on a little secret.” He whispered dramatically. “Lavender isn’t as hung up on Weasley as everyone thinks she is.” He stated simply.
Draco felt his insides heat up, “You saw me yesterday.” He pointed out rationally, reasoning that maybe they both had a few attachment issues.
It had been months since those joyous few weeks that were the Christmas holidays, and it was now only a couple of weeks before the end of the school year.
“I told you things Malfoy. Things I’ve never told anyone before. Things I want to tell you and only you.” He started. “I was vulnerable with you. I told you that I needed you. And you left me. Why did you leave me?” he whispered that last part, his voice wavering and breaking.
He’d said it one and he’ll say it again, who needed the Saviour of the Wizarding World, when Draco had a mob of angry little Hufflepuff’s?
Draco shook his head.
As if sensing his insecure nature, Harry entwined his fingers through Draco’s giving them a small squeeze. The gesture was small, but he’d never needed it more.
He couldn't do this anymore. He just couldn't. The resentment that he felt for his father had become all too much to handle. He had to get it out. He had to let it
Potter brought a hand to his chin, lifting his head so that Draco’s eyes were on his. “You told me to go.” He reminded him and Draco sighed.
him. But how? Why? Potter had everything. He had people who followed him. Who cared about him. Who
“Over my dead body.” She spat out, before turning her attention back to the matter at hand. “Face it you and Harry are head over heels in love with each other, nothing can change my mind.” She said stubbornly.
She gave him a small smile. “Of course, it is.” She started. “Sometimes I’m not happy.” She mused.
It had been a rocky journey. One filled with bumps at every turn. He’d survived, then he’d lived. He was weak but then he’d found strength. He’d lost but now he loved. And if you asked him if he would go back. If he would change anything. Then, his answer would be no.
Draco let her go, “You’re right, I’m not.” He sighed in defeat, “but I have to be.” he sighed out.
He smiled. “Morning.” He replied softly.
His mother squeezed his sweaty hand, “maybe, but it’s the first time that you’ll be going back since the war. Doesn’t that bother you?” she asked in deep concern.
“Malfoy!” a cold voice boomed and Draco whipped around to face an angry Harry Potter. Why was Potter here? It couldn't be. Had Potter followed him? But
Hermione clamped a comforting hand onto his shoulder. “Isn’t that a good thing?” she asked hesitantly.
Draco didn’t particularly like himself. Sure, he thought he was decent looking. He hair was so blond it was almost white, sprawled neatly across his head. His jaw was strong, lips red and pouted. His eyes were pools of mercury silver. Okay, he was attractive. Some may even go as far as to say drop dead gorgeous. Fine, Draco was ‘some’ but his opinion was the only one that counted. Anyhow, it helped that Draco was always right.
The Hall was left in complete silence, disbelief plastered on everyone’s faces.
Kat clapped her hands with delight. “I just knew that it would be perfect.” She admitted proudly.
As he’d grown older, he’d realised that her words didn’t matter, no, it was her actions. She could’ve just left him cry or told him to get over himself like his father had. But she didn’t. she made sure that he knew that he was loved. She made him believe that no matter what, it would all work out in the end.
If he thought that avoiding a bunch of Hufflepuff's was hard, then this was impossible. How in Merlin’s name did you look the man who you plan to murder in cold blood in the eyes?
Potter cupped Draco’s draw, stroking it gently. “I’ll tell you one thing.” He started. “You’ve never been more beautiful than you are in this moment.” He whispered earnestly before smashing his lips onto Draco’s.
Myrtle screamed. “Bad man, bad man. Stay away from Draco. Stay away!” she yelled frantically, and Draco felt the need to console the frightened girl.
it. Please, make it stop. Somebody make it stop.
Draco shook his head, “you’re right, I have gotten lots of gifts before.” He started and her face fell. “But I have never gotten any gifts as special as the ones you’ve brought me. Thank you. Thank you so much.”
He shot a few curses and hexes as well as successfully disarming his aunt. Serves the crazy bitch right.
She gave him a quick thumbs up before turning back towards the phone. “I’m here grandpa.” She told his father, and Draco smiled. He wouldn’t admit it to anyone but the interactions between his father and his daughter never failed to make his heart swell.
Theo tightened his hold on Draco, holding him even closer than before. “Me too.” He sighed. “Me too.”
“You left me.” Draco cried out. “You left, and I thought you’d forgotten about me, that you didn’t want me.” He shamefully admitted, hanging his head down low.
Hermione put her hands on her hips. “What’s so funny?” she snapped dangerously.
“I know what you need.” Potter reassures him, whilst stretching him to completion. Draco’s eyes roll to the back of his head in complete pleasure.
So many had come and gone making promises that had always been broken.
Draco sighed; this wasn’t working. “Do you really think that I’d waste my time lying about this?” he tired a different approach, he wasn't a Slytherin for nothing.
Potter gave him a tight squeeze, “how I just love it when you cooperate.” He teased snuggling closer towards him.
peculiar. But I still can’t supply an answer to your question.”
Weasley scoffed. “Now I know you’re going barmy. Harry’s not here.” He remarked triumphantly.
. He still had hope.
Draco took a step back, distancing himself from Potter. “I don’t know.” He chocked out, suddenly feeling extremely hot. “I don’t fucking know anything anymore.” He admitted, feeling more confused than ever.
Tears were falling freely from his eyes now; Draco slowly lowered his wand. “I don’t want your help!” he bit out. “Don’t you understand? I have to do this. I have to kill you.” He pleased desperately. “Or he’s going to kill me…”
To his classes. To the dungeons. To the Great Hall. To the Quidditch Field. They even thought it proper to follow him to the bloody bathroom!
Theo shook his head reaching over and placing his hand atop of Draco’s. From the corner of his eye, he could see Potter sit up a little straighter as he stared at them intently.
His father blinked a few times, taking in his broken state. “Draco, I really think this outburst is completely unjust and inappropriate.” He spat out and Draco’s blood turned to stone.
There was only one thing left to do.
The whole table erupted into a chorus of protests.
No, he’d never been alone, he’d had the stars. They’d always been his friends. He’d played with them, laughed with them, confided in them. They made him feel safe, wanted, loved. He’d always believed that there was someone up there, watching over him and keeping him safe.
He was questioning him? The 'I can barely string words together' Weasel was actually questioning Draco's potion making abilities. Draco Lucius Malfoy! Were they talking about the same Draco here, because he obviously hadn't meant him.
“Do what?” the girl asked, and he could swear that she was floating closer towards him.
She gave him a small nod. In light of her slowly relaxing posture around him, Draco attempted to divert the conversation towards a much more pressing matter.
Not up for discussion Draco’s arsehole. Who did he think he was? Who did they both think they were? Telling Draco what to do. Acting as if he had to follow whatever they decide for him. As if they were his father or something. Well, Draco hated to break it to them, but since he didn’t follow his father’s orders anymore, they could go and suck his left toe.
Potter shook his head, taking a few steps towards Draco so that their lips were almost touching. Gently, Potter clasped their hands together and Draco forgot how to breathe. “He took the wrong person.
“Draco Lucius Malfoy!” A familiar voice spat. “Why did I have to find out from a bloody Hufflepuff first year that—”
“You bitch!” he screamed, pointing his wand at her. “I’ll kill you.” He threatened with conviction. “I’LL FUCKING KILL YOU!” he roared spitting out a multitude of spells that she ever so easily blocked.
Draco rolled his eyes. “The kitchens are always open.” He informed.
“Maybe not, but I’m not sure that was every really me. I just can’t go back to being that narrow-minded idiot.” he admitted almost honestly to Weasley which shocked him to no end.
you feel about him?” he enquired genuinely, wanting to hear her say it herself.
?” he sobbed, admitting to himself that he was broken. His heart was smashed, cast aside.
“You really are a naïve child. What do you think the Dark Lord would say to that? You’re ever so lucky that your aunt is keeping the little event that happened at the Manor a few days ago to herself.”
“You will choose one of the designated potions that can be found in your study books, once you have chosen, you will have until the end of the Christmas term to complete it.” Draco inwardly groaned. Three months. Three months in the Weasel’s company. That’s not even mentioning having him as a work partner in class for the whole year. Could his life get any worse?
“I’m not.” He answered simply. What else could he say? Lie? He was affirmative that he was that of a transparent nature.
He pulled away from Pansy to face the worried stance of Blaise. “Are you okay?” he asked hesitantly.
“Stupid, boy!” Bellatrix screamed before his body was hurled from the floor, slamming onto an opposite wall.
Draco opened his mouth to object, but quickly closed it. Where was the lie? He’d been obsessed with Harry Potter since he was eleven. Hell, he’d been obsessed with Potter long before that.
Potter was dead.
Harry sat at the edge of a small pond, gazing up into the nights sky.
Merlin! They were just going around in circles. “It’s just surprising that’s all.” she shot him a glance that urged him to continue. “I’m not that good of a person, why would you ever want to sit with me when there’s so many other better choices?” he replied, albeit a tiny bit insecurely.
He answered him in the only way he knew how. He threw at Potter the first hex that he could think of. He missed.
He couldn’t change anything. He couldn’t do anything all over again. He couldn’t stop it.
“Then what’s going on?” she pushed.
Four silent words were plastered onto the drawing’s back. Four words that spoke an abundance of truth.
Mrs Weasley shook her head, pulling him in for another hug. “No, thank
“Well, Draco, since you’re acting like an antisocial dim whit and refusing to accept any Christmas invitations, I’m staying here.” He proclaimed, scooting closer towards Draco.
Draco nodded, not sure of what else he could say. He feared that she’d react like this, he was used to it.
With a shaky breath he caught the eye of a confused Potter before fleeing the Great Hall.
“Of course, you’re drinking it.” Draco answered and Weasley sent him a death glare. “Don’t look so pale, Weasley. This is not a potion without an antidote and even if there wasn’t one, depending on the potency of the potion, we can manipulate it’s timings and effects.”
Potter laughed. “Because bread goes off after a few days. The contraption is useful, and muggles don’t have magic.” He reminded Draco gently.
Draco looked at him in bafflement. “Then what’s your problem?” he asked.
Draco scoffed. “That’s an outrageously long name for a game. But I must say, it does sound quite interesting. I’ll have to give it a try one of these days.” He mused.
He let out a dramatic sigh. “Not saying that I forgive you, because forgiveness is something that has to be earned.” He started. “But where is your little leader Smith?” he enquired.
Draco narrowed his eyes at them. “So, are you both here to tell me to back the hell off?” he spat bitterly.
He was such an idiot. He wanted to ask for help, he wanted to so badly. Why couldn’t he do it? What was wrong with him? He knew that he should stop this nonsense and confide in the Headmaster. But he wouldn’t, no, he couldn’t. And he didn’t know why.
They casually made their way towards the Hufflepuff dorm, the little girl talking his ear off as they went. He’d learnt that she had two younger brothers, that her new robes were extremely itchy and that she was quite partial towards chocolate frogs. He grinned slightly as she said that, as he found that he too had quite a liking for chocolate frogs.
A boy glared in question, and Draco decided that he hated him.
“Are we going to keep talking about Draco’s arse or are why going to talk about why it called us in here?” Big-mouth Jerry commented and Draco growled at him.
She looked up at him with pleading eyes once he had finished. “Does Potter know?” she asked hesitantly.
Potter’s eyes turned cold. “Don’t you
She was wrong, there was everything wrong with him.
He sighed raking his brain for the softest answer possible. “Bad people are coming to Hogwarts. People who want to harm people like you. I’m doing this to keep you safe.” He said honestly.
