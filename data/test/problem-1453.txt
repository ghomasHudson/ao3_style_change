"It worked." he said, relief hearable in his voice. "Good job, Kreacher." He added.
"People always do. Slytherin is the house with most prejudice against it. It did produce many dark wizards, more then other houses but it also produced the most healers and potioners. I for one, would be proud to be in Slytherin."
"I’m sorry, my little prince. I didn’t want us to do anything you would regret later and I triggered that flashback, didn’t I? You are safe with me and I want you and I’m not rejecting you, do you understand?"
I exchanged a few letters with Harry during August, so we got to know each other a bit better. I knew everything about his abusive uncle and aunt from Hermione but reading in a letter from Harry how good day it was, when his cousin left a whole sausage on his plate and he was allowed to finish it, made my heart ache for the boy.
Besides being headquarters for the order, Hogwarts also became refugee camp for anybody afraid of remaining death eaters coming after them and people who lost their homes in the war. Some of the older students decided to stay and help out taking care of others and rebuilding the school.
"Do you feel better?" Harry asked as he pulled away.
Soon they arrived at Snape’s quarters, the door was protected by a password, but Harry knew it from Draco. Snape’s office and laboratory were total chaos, as far as Harry was concerned, there wasn’t any system in where what lied.
"You are clean Draco, you were hurting yourself. Is this about your magical core?"
"You are big." Draco whispered, running his fingers up and down the eight inches long member, his touches featherlight and appreciative.
Harry’s warm hand took Draco’s chin and gently turned the blond’s head to face him.
"Well, it’s true. I’m Harry Potter, nice to meet you." Harry says and Weasley’s jaw involuntarily drops.
"You just always kept watching and teasing him. I thought he would notice but he was totally oblivious. Like when you climbed a tree to mock him about Triwizard tournament. You know, I saw you climbing that tree, waiting there for him to pass around so you could catch his attention and talk to him." She laughed softly.
"You really are totally drunk." Draco sighed and stood up. "It’s late, let’s sleep," he said. He moved to the other side of the bed and slipped under the covers.
Harry explained to Hermione everything he knew about Draco’s condition and he could see it affected the Gryffindor girl greatly. She had only been under cruciatus once and it scarred her mentally enough for life.
"I’m glad, Draco." Harry smiled into Draco’s hair. "Merlin, you are still shaking so much. Do you know why you passed out in the bath?" Harry asked.
It was over, they have finally killed Voldemort.
"I see. I thought the two of you were dating?" Draco asked, curious.
"Alright Draco, legilimens."
"I found a ministry owl, trying to get through our wards. Draco is being summoned for trial," she said and casted tempus. "We have two hours and twenty minutes to get ready and get to the ministry, otherwise he will be declared fugitive and guilty."
Suddenly Draco froze, his body going rigid. "Please master not today, I can’t take the curse anymore, please…" Draco begged, tears caught in the eyelashes of his closed eyes.
My visions started in my last year at Hogwarts and at first, I didn’t really pay attention to them. We didn’t have any seer in our blood line that I knew of and I thought maybe it was just my mind playing tricks on me because I was stressed. But then they started to come true.
"You don’t want me. The Dark lord had me and I’m damaged goods and you don’t want me." Draco whispered. He wasn’t going to cry but he couldn’t help it.
Next to me Hermione looks like she wants to start writing down notes. Good, the sooner she starts getting familiar with the Dark Arts the better. Who knows when exactly we will encounter Voldemort and he is not picky about which magic he uses either.
"Good, good. So I should go find Luna."  Hermione said and stood up.
"Yeah, just me. Let’s get you out of the water, okay?" Harry asked and Draco nodded. He slowly helped the blond step out of the bath and handed him towel and bathrobe.
Draco nodded and Harry slipped under the blanket. He lied on his side and pulled the blond closer to himself, spooning him from behind. He pushed one of his arms under Draco’s neck and wrapped the other one around his body. Draco’s skin was so cold that a shiver ran even through Harry.
"Yes, but he has much more bad ones. He is selfish, jealous, unreliable, rude and I must have been blind not to see it."
"This much food will be here every day, breakfast, lunch and dinner. I know you aren’t used to this. Eat well but slowly or you will get sick. Also, manners and impressions are really important here. See how others look at those boys over there." I glance at Crabbe and Goyle and how students sitting around them are trying to hide their disgust over them overstuffing their faces with pork chops and mashed potatoes. "Also now is just as good time as any to tell you I’m not letting you go back to your aunt and uncle. You will not have to worry about food or eat scraps ever again." I tell him quietly, so that nobody else would hear, I don’t want to embarrass him.
"Accident... but I have failed you." Harry whispered. "We are soulmates Draco. We are supposed to take care of each other but I hurt you." And I hurt you again in this life with sectumsempra, he thought.
"No, not really. He usually hides it when we are together but when he thinks I’m not looking I can tell he is in pain, he has nightmares, he is hesitant to do even little things,  worried to upset me or you." Harry sighed. "He is different. I’m glad that he doesn’t hide by the asshole façade anymore but he isn’t himself either. I don’t know what exactly happened to him but he is hurt a lot. Not only his body and magic but his soul too." Harry explained quietly.
Harry shaked him with more strengh by both shoulders. "Wake up Draco, you have to wake up!" and the reaction was almost immediate, Draco’s silver eyes opened, he scrambled up into sitting position and away from Harry, his big eyes scanning the bedroom for any potential intruders. He was breathing fast and his eyes were full of tears. Just looking at him like this was making Harry's heart break.
"I want to belong to you. I don’t want to be free, I want to be yours." Draco whispered and dared to look at Harry’s face to see his reaction. Harry was looking at him in such a loving way, like if he really was something valuable and precious.
I'm sorry it took me so long. But at least it's a little bit longer one. Enjoy.
Hermione noticed he was getting sick. "Draco! Draco, are you okay?" she asked, concerned.
Draco, on the other hand, seemed to have become thinner. He seemed delicate and fragile, making Harry feel the urge to protect the Slytherin prince. And this time, in this life, he was going to do just that. There were too many lives in which he failed, too many times his ego didn’t let him get close to Draco, too many times he watched him die and once he even caused his death. Harry remembered it all when he was about to cross to the afterlife.
Harry immediately let go of him.
From then on, we fall into easy conversation about Hogwarts and how excited we both are about the school starting tomorrow.
"You too?" Harry laughed.
"So now you are harbouring dirty little death eaters, whatever." Ron muttered and stormed out of the room into the kitchen.
"It sounds like a fairy tale." Draco commented smiling.
I will be grateful for any kudos and nothing makes me as happy as comments. In real life, people aren't very supportive of me writing, which is partially the reason I used to get discouraged easily. But as a part of my New Year's resolutions, I decided I'm no longer going to care and I will just do what makes me happy.
Harry’s voice calmed Draco down, one hand stroking his hair while the other cradled him. Each pass of Harry’s hand over his hair making warmth spread through him. He was dizzy and sleepy and still painfully hard, but he didn’t want to interrupt the moment. He shifted slightly to be more comfortable, but it didn’t help much.
"Believe me, I’m sorry to do this too, Mrs. Granger. But there were numerous cases of misconduct during the trials after the last war and we were too lenient, letting many Death Eaters escape. Therefore new rules were made and any accusation of being connected to Voldemort must be investigated and disproved," the elderly with explained.
"I can’t do it, Harry. I thought I will manage but I can’t. I won’t be able to stay there a minute, let alone ten." Draco pleaded, swinging his hand in the direction of the prepared pyre.
"I guess not really," she answers, frowning.
It all made sense now, the baths, the flinching, the insecurity, Draco being scared when Harry took of  clothes the other day.
"Seems we’ve got almost everything, just Ollivander's left now. We need to get wands."
"Draco, you are…" Harry started.
He run a bath, it was scorching hot and he hissed as he lowered himself into the water. It hurt a bit but it felt good too. He started to scrub his skin. He will get clean, he will wash away the traces of the Dark Lord.
"Huh, alright. I guess that makes sense," Harry smiled. "I need to go back to the Hogwarts, talk with The Order. Draco, I want you to stay in the house and have a rest, I need to know you will be alright."
"That was brilliant Draco! Did you see Weasley’s expression?" Harry asks.
He knocked and when nobody replied he opened the door. The room was empty and Harry frowned. Maybe Draco was in a bathroom.
"I did. I did serve him."
"Oh." Draco wanted to forget yesterday’s events. In fact, he was doing rather good job of it. But now he remembered, getting shouted at and beaten by Weasel, passing out in the bath, Harry finding him, helping him, seeing him naked. Draco blushed and realized he was still naked under the blanket.
He missed the manor but he feared it as well, it was filled with too many painful memories covering up the happy ones of his mother and of playing there with Crabbe and Goyle. Even the memories of running around the mansion with his childhood playmates now had a bittersweet taste because one of them was dead. They were unseperatabe, Crabbe and Goyle, and he couldn’t really imagine one withouth the other. They weren’t that clever and he couldn’t talk with them about everything but they were loyal. And Draco was missing them.
I can see that she is remembering not only Harry but also all the others who died and she is about to cry. It breaks my heart to see her like this and I hold her tighter. She is my best friend now. The only other person I was ever this close to was my mother.
"Oh, nice to meet you Michael. Please have a seat." Harry said and beckoned to the seat opposite him and Draco. "So did Hermione explain the details to you?"
"No, my little prince, he was wrong, he was so wrong in a way he treated you, he was wrong to hurt you, he was wrong to speak to you like that." Harry tried to explain.
Draco felt he wanted more though. His heart hurt thinking that Harry is probably at the moment with little Weaslette, comforting her after the funeral. Merlin, he was a terrible person, Weaslette’s brother died and yet Draco was being jealous about her being with Harry.
"Like this, see? I’m not going to do anything, you don’t have to be scared, I will just hold you like this. Is it okay?"
"Oh, I’m sorry. I got lost in thoughts for a while." Harry apologized.
Necessity has no law. Remember it and brush up on your latin, there is more than enough latin books lying around. Also, the exact location of our dormitories is secret, do not share it with other houses. If somebody finds out, obliviate them or if you can’t do it yourself, bring them in to be obliviated."
And so, here they were, Luna gathered all the wood and organized it around a small platform, which was Draco trying to avoid looking at. It looked suspiciously like the pictures of muggles burning witches and wizards, only it wasn’t on fire yet.
"Then just do it, I’m yours." Draco breathed and nibbled on his neck. "You can do anything you want to me," he whispered as he undid the buttons of Harry’s shirt and trailed kisses down his chest and stomach. Gently he took Harry’s hard cock into his hand again and Harry sucked in a breath. Draco looked up to see his face stiff with concentration, muscles tense.
Father frowns, considering my question.
"Are you sure this is good idea Draco? We don’t have that much time. Today is summer solstice and the ritual has much higher chance of succeeding if we do it tonight. And Luna was kept prisoner in your house…" Hermione said.
Harry went to sit besides Draco, placing one of his hands on the small of the blond’s back to keep both Draco and Harry himself anchored. It was just so natural for him to keep the Slytherin close, preferably within hand’s reach.
"You think you forced me into touching you?" Harry realized, his eyes wide with surprise.
"It was similar, he made you lose contact with everything else, you were contained only in his room, your only contact being with him. People in situations like that often form a bond with their abuser."
"It’s not so bad. Nothing feels broken, I’ve had worse." Draco said as a matter of fact.
"I don’t know Ginny. I’m sorry, let’s talk downstairs, alright?" Harry asked because he didn’t want to stress Draco with further conflict, especially one with another Weasley. He stood up but Ginny didn’t look like she was going to move.
"Shh, just a dream Draco, nobody is going to hurt you, you are safe here, it’s okay." Harry continued whispering comforting words while he held the blond boy. His presence was calming Draco and he continued until all of the blond’s sobs quieted down.
"As much as Dark Arts are evil. If you are serious about studying and becoming somebody in the wizarding world, either Slytherin or Ravenclaw are your best choices. In my opinion, Hogwarts curriculum is quite basic, but you can study more by yourself with the help of your upperclassmen and teachers. And for that both Slytherin and Ravenclaw are perfect. I myself consider career in politics or healing – therefore Slytherin. If you were into arithmancy or runes, Ravenclaw would be better."
"You think it’s funny?" I ask and almost make a remark about his family being poor and easily recognizable, but I stop myself because of Hermione and Harry.
He crouched in front of the sobbing blond. "Shh, it’s over Draco, he is dead. He is not going to hurt you." Harry whispered.
"Of course, Draco." Harry said and slipped back under the blanket. He again pulled the blond boy against his chest and wrapped his arms around his slender body.
"Alright then, I'll be back tomorrow night. Be good, stay inside and have a rest." Harry said as he stood up and left.
They stayed like that for some time and eventually Draco stopped shivering.
"Yeah, we probably overdid it a bit. Ginny tried to snog me but I didn’t want to, it just wasn’t right." Harry said and Draco paused for a while, surprised Harry rejected Weaslette’s advances even in drunken state but quickly resumed massaging.
"Hermione, I think you knew but you gave him chance anyway." Said Harry softly.
I must thank mother later for that brilliant idea. She only lifts up her eyebrow at the  display of lack of manners and we leave for the King’s Cross station.
Harry prepared his wand, he knew he will need all the focus and power available and even though he was quite skilled with wandless magic, for this particular spell, he didn’t want to risk it.
"You begged somebody to stop and to kill you." Harry explained.
"That doesn’t erase it," he protested quietly.
Harry’s cock brushing against his through the thin material of the little clothes they had on made pleasure pool in Draco’s lower belly, the friction almost paralyzing him. He involuntarily arched his back and moaned. But then Harry moved away and all of it was gone, he wanted to get close again but Harry’s firm hands were on him, pressing his hips down and preventing him from moving.
It was already four days since Draco took the potion and he was still sleeping most of the time. Hermione told Harry not to be worried. That Draco’s body and magical core are just healing and using all energy to do so, making him tired.
Professor Flitwick’s Charms aren’t bad and neither is Professor McGonagall’s transfiguration.
"That’s dark magic!" Hermione gasped.
After the feast, Dumbledore has another speech.
Harry wanted to hug Draco and hold him till he stops crying but he already felt like he was crossing a line. If Draco wasn't shaken from his mother's death, he would hardly let him this close, allow him to touch him like this. In this last hour, he had touched Draco more than in the last seven years altogether.
We wizards know better then to fuck up with time, trust me we do. But when it’s question of Earth ceasing to exist and fucking up with time a little bit, I would screw time anytime.
"I don’t think it’s your fault at all Harry." Draco chuckled darkly and Harry frowned. "Didn’t you say yourself that I always die young?"
"No wonder you didn’t want anything to do with me, when you have those two cuties living with you," the guy said and alerted Harry and Draco of his presence. Draco’s body immediately went stiff, and Harry started comfortingly stroking his back. Draco didn’t like strangers.
"It was sad. Everybody was devastated but George looked like part of his soul was missing, he didn’t talk, didn’t cry, he just was there. Ron ignored me and kept his distance. Molly was crying the whole time and went to lie down a bit early. The rest of us stayed and had a drink."
"I’m Hermione Granger, friend and classmate of Draco Malfoy. I will be presenting defence."
Harry slowly slid off Draco’s underwear and took his erection into his palm. It was average in size but nice shape and lovely pink colour. Its head was already leaking precum and Harry spread it along the shaft instead of lubricant.
"You’re being so good for me," Harry said. "Don’t worry about anything, just relax and keep looking at me, alright?"
My original plan was to cast a cushioning charm and soften the impact when he hits the ground but suddenly I feel like I can’t let the boy fall. He will be traumatized about flying for next few years and that will not do much for his confidence. I imagine how much more useful could confident Neville be.
"I hope I’m in Slytherin with Draco." Harry says.
"Harry…" he whimpered, sounding so small, when he finally recognized the black haired wizard.
"Hermione, how sure are you that this will work?" I ask the bushy haired witch as I turn the watch around in my fingers. She is looking haggard and thin, her expression haunted. She has long ago given up on taking care about how she looks and so did I. After all, we are either fighting or hiding all the time.
(See the end of the chapter for
"It’s alright, nothing to be sorry for. Just relax Draco, I only need to see your chest, okay? Just a few quick healing spells, nothing to be worried about." Harry said in  a calming voice.
"I swear Hermione, I will do everything I can no matter what it costs."
Harry only now took in the crying form of the blond boy next to him. Draco’s face was drenched in tears, his arms hugging his thin frame in a vain attempt to stop the tremors running through his body.
"We will be together. I will take care of you, I promise." Harry reassured Draco. "I will be with you the whole time, it will be okay."
"So which house would you like to be sorted in?" I ask.
"You are a good person Hermione." Harry said.
"Yes, master Potter? What does the half-blood require of old Kreacher?" the elf asked and Harry was positively surprised there weren't really any insults in Kreacher's question.
"Transfiguration is some of the most complex and dangerous magic you will learn at Hogwarts," she says. "Anyone messing around in my class will leave and not come back. You have been warned."
"Wow, can I see your scar?" Weasley asks and I want to slap him. I always thought he was an idiot but asking somebody you just met about scar they got when somebody killed their parents and tried to kill them triumphs every single stupid thing he ever said in front of me until now.
For a second, his broom hangs in the same spot but then Neville tilts it slightly to the ground and begins to descend.
"Alright then, are you ready for the time jump of your life?" She asks and I nod.
"There is nobody here, only two of us and the old house elf. It was just a dream, Draco, just a bad dream." He said and pulled the shaking boy into hug. To his surprise Draco hugged him back.
"But I wasn’t kidnapped." Draco frowned.
"Yes, Draco. Friends. I can’t promise nothing bad will ever happen again but I take care of my friends and I will do my best to protect you. Now let’s heal those bruises. " Harry said. He placed his palm gently over Draco’s bruised skin making the blond gasp.
"I already did, Draco. Besides all the insults you have thrown my way and me yours pale up when we consider I almost killed you and if Snape wasn’t there at the time, you would have bled to death." Harry said as he reached for the other boy’s hand to hold it. "I’m so sorry I hurt you like that Draco. I swear I didn’t mean to, at the time when I learned the spell, I didn’t know what it does."
"Eight galleons." He says and I hand him the money. "You are rather knowledgeable about wandlore for one so young and you have good instincts too. If you feel like learning more later, come find me young Mr. Malfoy. I would enjoy teaching you."
"But that doesn’t mean you have to find me attractive." Draco mumbled.
"Can you stay with him a bit?" I ask Hermione, knowing that she will take care of Harry.
Harry was sitting on the bed, wearing black formal wizarding clothes and he had a sad expression on his face.
They start laughing but stop when they see that I’m not joking.
"But why, Potter? Don't you see I have no future? If my father wants me dead, then every remaining death eater would try to make sure to make it happen. Or maybe you will just send me to solitary cell in Azkaban fast enough to avoid that? Let me tell you I won't last long in there either," spat Draco.
"I will miss you." I whisper into her hair.
"Harry…" Draco whispered as he looked into Harry’s emerald eyes and leaned into the touch.
"I see." Draco said and looked relieved.
"Don’t go." Draco demanded and he caught Harry’s wrist but soon realized he wasn’t in a position to demand anything.
"Okay, can I be honest with you guys?" I sit on one of the desks and let my expression show that what I’m going to talk about is quite serious. "It’s about Quirell and his turban."
"She doesn’t hate me. I listened in to her thoughts on a few occasions. They have such a unique pitch they are basically impossible to ignore even when I tried to. But will someone finally tell me what purification ritual am I to undergo? I might need some mental preparation for that, you know?"
I make sure that he doesn’t see it as I write Mr. Ollivander a cheque for thousand galleons. It's more then some people make in their entire life but I am a Malfoy and if there is something I don't have to worry about, it's money. Harry wakes up Hagrid who meanwhile fell asleep on the chair and we leave the shop with our new wands.
Draco placed his hands on Harry’s chest, feeling his strong heart beat and tucked his head under Harry’s chin. Harry wrapped his hands around Draco’s lithe body to hold him close, one hand at the nape of his neck, the other around his waist. Week ago, such a closeness would be unimaginable, but now nothing could feel more right then holding Draco like this, knowing that both of them found comfort in each other’s touch.
"Definitely. I will go check on Draco."
"Okay then, in that case, let’s just pack it all."
"But I let him do it and sometimes it felt good." Draco cried. He knew he was fucked up well to ever enjoy what was between him and Voldemort. To come when he was being raped.
"I’m sorry. I’m so sorry," Draco whispered and buried his face in his palms.
"I should apologize to her and Weasel next time I see them." he sighed.
"Yes, totally!" he almost jumps in excitement at the idea and I know it’s because he has never met any other wizarding kid before, never had a friend because of his abusive muggle relatives. "I’m here with Hagrid but I’m sure he wouldn’t mind if you joined us."
"My name is Draco Malfoy." I extend my hand to him. I must not butcher my introduction this time. Better keep it simple.
It takes Draco a moment to process what Harry said. If from Harry’s point of view they didn’t see each other for so long then it’s really no wonder that he is over their petty arguments.
We stand by our broomsticks like Madame Hooch instructs and say "Up". Mine and Harry’s immediately jump into our palms and Harry grins at me happily.
He leans closer to me and I take my wand out of my sleeve, then I place the tip on his temple.
"Get out Weasley, you are no longer welcome here," he says and Weasley finally picks up his few things and leaves.
"Good, yeah, Ron went home to prepare everything for the funeral. It’s tomorrow, he probably already sent you an owl. I’ll go to the Burrow later for dinner today. How are you? And how is Draco?"
"Yeah, Snape did quite a good job patching me up on the spot and then mother hired the best healers in the country to finish the healing." Draco explained.
Harry pulled him against his chest and Draco’s body immediately melted into his. Harry saw that the Slytherin was growing more and more distressed as the time of the ritual was approaching.
By now Harry is hugging his knees to his body and looks like he might vomit soon. I cast notice me not charm around the three of us and another stronger shield around Harry, hoping it will make a difference. Then I put my hand on his back and draw calming circles. It’s good that we are at the back of the class and nobody would pay attention to us even without my notice me not charm as they are too busy grilling Quirell about his experiences with fighting Dark Forces and vampires in Romania.
"We might have to go through it all. We will have to take more then just the research anyway. If we are going to continue what Snape started, we will also need all the literature he used and even his notes regarding other subjects could be useful. Also the ingredients to eventually make the potion and for the pain management potion. Do you think it’s okay to take it? We are basically stealing this…"
Harry didn’t really comprehend the scene in front of him, it was like it took them only five minutes to become close and already have secrets to laugh about together. It didn’t make sense but it made his chest warm up pleasantly. It was good to see his best friend and his soulmate getting along so well, it was much more than he hoped for. He left the room dreading Draco would have another melt down because of Ginny and returned to see him laughing without a care in the world. He knew Draco’s good mood wouldn’t necessarily last long but he was still thankful to Hermione.
But before Harry's thought fully reached the dangerous territory, he heard gasps and realized they were no longer alone. Although regretfully, he pulled away and kissed Draco chastely on his cheek. Draco whimpered and Harry chuckled quietly.
"Yes, I was keeping myself pure for the arranged marriage with some witch. Lot of good it brought me. I don’t even like women. I don’t know if it’s ridiculous or sad." He chuckled.
Harry saw Draco was right, little bit of blood was seeping through his pajama bottoms. Harry’s hands traced the waistline and his eyes connected with Draco’s. "Is it okay if I…?" he asked and Draco nodded.
"Very well, Miss Granger, please continue."
(See the end of the chapter for
"Alright." he nods.
"Harry, I just want to tell you that I’m grateful for your hospitality and for saving my life. Thank you."  Draco said and bowed. Suddenly he was being pulled up and sat on Harry’s lap. Harry’s strong arms encircling him and embracing him. And Draco hugged him back, burying his face in the crook of Harry’s neck, breathing in his scent.
"You did what you had to survive, my little prince. It’s not your fault or your choice that your body responded in a ways it did." Harry said and felt Draco hug him back.
"Mother, I just got dizzy a bit." I explain but she isn’t buying it. I used to be a cold little brat, never appreciating my mother and everything she did for me.
"Understandable, Miss Granger, I agree with you about everything," the Head Warlock said, her voice trembling and wiped her eyes with a handkerchief. "Let’s vote, everybody in favour of dropping all the charges and complying with Miss Granger’s request?" she asked and every single member of Wizengamot raised their hand. "Then it’s decided. I’m very sorry, Mr. Malfoy for what happened to you and for this trial. May you need anything more from us, don’t hesitate to ask. That is all," she said and dismissed them.
"Draco, are you in there?" he asked but nobody replied so he opened the door.
"Do you know who this is?" Harry asked and gestured towards Draco.
"It’s complicated. But I think it’s only right that you should know if I do."
She went to the bedroom and lied on the bed. Anyway, she was strong witch, she didn’t need to marry the first wizard she liked, she had plenty of time to find somebody who will be good for her. Who will be brave, clever and caring. Somebody who will appreciate her for who she is.
"Hello, would you like to sit with us?" I ask her. Wow, what a friendly fellow I am.
"Thank you Harry," said Draco and expected the other man’s palm to disappear but it continued it’s journey on his chest.
"So, you, me and I know she is still mourning, but we can try asking Ginny." Harry suggested.
"That’s okay too, Draco. You can stay with me. I can take care of you until you feel better. And then we can go back to Hogwarts together, I’ve heard that all students are going to repeat the last year in order to graduate. We can go back together." Harry smiled, already imagining them taking the Hogwarts express together. Maybe they will be eating chocolate frogs together, does Draco like them? Or maybe Draco would fall asleep with his head on Harry’s shoulder, missing the whole way while he looks out of window and Hermione reads some incredibly difficult book.
Harry was swimming in the sea of memories. There was Voldemort everywhere, his voice coming in from the myriad of directions, it was dizzying. He decided to focus on them one by one.
They weren’t close, Harry couldn’t stand him and he was not even gay. The thing is, maybe Draco wasn’t gay either because he wasn’t attracted to men in general. He wasn’t attracted to women either. The only single being in this universe that he was attracted to was Harry Potter.
"I don't deserve it. I.... just don’t." Draco said.
"You were just a boy, I’m not troubled by the past."
"Strange how our ways of thinking changed." Draco noted. Harry simply nodded and continued.
"It’s time to put it to use Draco." She says and I hug her.
It didn’t surprise Harry that Hermione Granger was one of them and he didn’t doubt Ron would also be here, if he wasn’t mourning the death of Fred.
I’ve forgotten many things about my first year of Hogwarts, but one of the things I couldn’t forget even if I tried, is the clumsiness of Neville Longbottom.
Draco was getting sick.
"Very good." Harry said and placed one last kiss on Draco’s forehead before he stood up and left the platform.
"That’s not true, there were dark wizards in all of the houses. What about Thelius and Ubras Elin? Hufflepuffs proven to be Death Eaters. Ravenclaws Elexone Awys and Ezor Ball? Even whole Armstrong family attended Gryffindor and they turned out to be murderers."
"Now, let’s start. You claimed not guilty. So you didn’t try to murder Albus Dumbledore?" Robards asked, tilting his head as if he was curious.
Draco sat on the chair in the middle of the courtroom. Hermione placed her hand on his shoulder and gave him a small smile.
"Sleeping, I made him drink some pumpkin juice when he woke up for a bit."
"I got what I deserved, it’s okay."
"By any means necessary. You are not setting foot inside that house ever again. You are special and they treat you worse than a dog. I will not allow that." I say and he looks at me like I’m the most wonderful being in the whole universe. It flatters me. Taking on a role of his guardian and guide is more satisfying than I expected. He is sweet and naïve and I want to protect him.
"Draco, I’m getting an idea you are not talking about bruises from quidditch practise."
"Not much." Harry admitted.
"Nevermind." He dismissed it. "I have to get to work. You two can watch but don’t interrupt." Draco said and kneeled on the floor. He pointed the wand towards his palm and cut it a bit. Blood started pooling in there. He set his wand aside, dipped his index finger in the blood and started to draw what looked like alchemic transmutation circle on the wooden floor. Kreacher joined him on the floor, also dipping his finger in Draco’s blood and filling the circle with symbols.
"Harry, whatever happened, you can tell me." Draco whispered softly, holding the eye contact.
"Yes, yes. Kreacher will help Slytherin prince!" the elf nodded enthusiastically and even jumped a little.
"Yes, Harry."
"It was about… " Draco started and paused. "I’m sorry… I can’t tell you," said Draco weakly.
"But I liked what he did to me. I even liked him. How could I like him?" Draco shuddered and pressed his face against Harry’s neck, trying to hide there.
"That’s not very much Slytherin like. I usually protect my own skin." Draco stated.
When we touch the ground, the are whistles and people are clapping.
"Ron, be reasonable, we would have told you everything later." Hermione pinched in.
"Harry…" Draco called his name again and clutched onto Harry’s shirt. Harry pulled him into embrace, wrapping his hands protectively around the blond.
"Alright, fuck destiny." Draco chuckled.
Draco’s vision got all black, he couldn’t see at all. He tried to rub his eyes but it didn’t help, his head hurt and he needed to lie down.
Harry was walking to the kitchen, getting ready to talk to Ron about what had happened. He was angry at the redhead but understood that Ron acted mostly out of surprise and fear that something happened to Harry.
When he was younger, he didn’t realize that his admiration might be more then just that. He would watch Harry’s unruly hair, imagine touching it but he thought nothing of that. He would be staring into Harry's eyes, thinking they are the most perfect shade of emerald green and not worry about what it meant.
"Poor Draco. We were never friends, more like the exact opposite but I would never wish this upon him."
"You have nothing to be sorry about, I was the one to scare you, I should have explained." Harry said and brushed hair away from Draco’s face. "Now, I will get under the blanket with you and hold you to warm you up, will that be alright?" Harry asked.
"Nice to meet you Harry, come visit us anytime at the manor, all friends of Draco are always welcome." My father says and Harry looks sad.
"She is," Harry admitted, "but she is more like a little sister to me."
"Full glass," he said and the entire Wizengamot started murmuring.
"Yes, absolutely, we will not miss him." Harry’s aunt answers and slams the door shut.
The class murmurs and Weasley and Thomas look annoyed.
"Yes, it’s not recorded well but there were seers in our blood line, the last one being Septimus Malfoy. Draco, are you telling me…."
The truth is, Draco thought, Harry and Weaslette looked good together. Ginny’s long ginger hair, pretty face and full breasts were ideal contrast to Harry’s masculine features. Her body, unlike Draco’s bony one, must be soft all over. Harry probably loved hugging her, kissing her, getting lost in her softness.
It was surreal. Harry walked through the ruins of the broken castle as if in a dream. Voldemort was dead and Harry was back. He looked around, his friends were comforting and healing each other but one person he was looking for was missing, the most important one.
"Curious, curious indeed. Little Slytherins coming for pranks, tell us more?"
I finish my little speech and I’m worried to look at Harry’s reaction. Did I just fuck up my chance at friendship with him by disagreeing with Hagrid?
"Yep, that’s why I did it, he looked way too pleased that McGonagall caught me reading."
"What else did the healers say Draco?" Harry asked patiently, not showing his raising worries.
"Uncle Vernon was a bit angry about Hedwig flying in and out of the house and I wasn’t allowed to let her deliver letters anymore."
Hermione cleared her throat, she was also crying, she hurt Draco by showing this memory but at least she will help him be free. "Madame Head Warlock, I believe that was enough proof of Draco’s innocence. I expect all the charges to be taken down and formal apology to be delivered to Draco. This is not how we should have proceeded with this trial," she said, her shoulders shaking. "Furthermore, I want all the Malfoy’s assets and hereditary titles, including the place in Wizengamot to be officially moved to Draco Malfoy. His father is criminal but Draco is not and neither was his mother. It wouldn’t be fair to touch his inheritance and Draco will not be paying any war reparations. And my last requirement is that all the witches and wizards present today take oath of secrecy about the last memory we have seen."
"That’s not what this means. Draco, look at me." Harry said but Draco turned his head. He wasn’t able to meet Harry’s eyes.
He turned to Draco. "Are you alright? What happened?"
"I got angry and my magic accidently burst out a bit." Harry shrugged his shoulders, trying not to make a big deal out of it, not to remind Draco what made him angry in the first place. Not to think about Voldemort touching what he had no right to…
"Draco, no, not like this, you aren’t well yet." Harry tried to protest but as Draco rubbed tendons in Harry’s neck  and pressed  their bodies closer together in a way that their growing erections were nestled firmly against each other, Harry’s resolution to not let this proceed got weaker and weaker.
"Draco, " Harry breathed out and held Draco's hands in his. Draco’s hands were beautiful, slender wrists and long fingers. Harry wondered if Draco played piano. The blond didn't try to get free and that assured Harry that his presence is indeed in some way comforting to the other boy. "You are not pathetic, you've been hurt, you lost somebody dear to you and your father tried to kill you. It's okay to cry."
"Shh, it’s okay, I’m not angry, I just want to hear you say it one more time Draco. Tell me."
"I don’t know Harry, I think he was maybe right." Draco whispered.
"I’m fairly certain it will work. It has to work. It’s the world’s only chance Draco. Otherwise, your vision... "
Harry pushed the blanket to Draco’s waist and finally got a good view of Draco’s chest. There were angry purple and blue bruises covering his lower ribs, looking now more severe then yesterday night.
Draco’s thin body was all tense against his, he was also quieter then usually and Harry wished he could do something more than caress his back to calm the blond boy but there weren’t many options at the moment. There wasn’t much time for much mental preparation, they needed the ritual to work and if Harry had to chose between Draco’s mental health getting more damaged and Draco possibly dying, he was willing to let the mental health get another blow.
"I don’t care about destiny Draco. If anything, the fact that I was able to save you twice means that it’s possible to change." Harry said and pulled Draco closer to him again.
"Can I … can you kiss me?" Draco asked and blushed. He knew he was asking for much. But despite his history with the Dark Lord, Harry didn’t seem to be disgusted with him. No, Harry held him and caressed him and now they were making plans together.
"Good," Harry said and leaned above the blond boy to look into his eyes. "Just keep an eye contact with me and think about the memories that you want to show me. I don’t want to hurt you. It will work the best if you stay relaxed and let me in."  Harry said softly.
Draco’s breathing slowed down and he released his grip on Harry’s wrist.
"I know, I know. You have told me thousand times." I smile.
Draco nodded, his hands gripping the sheets. He was lost in the sensation of Harry’s hand moving on his cock but he kept his eyes fixed on Harry. Harry’s other hand was exploring his body, tracing his ribs, nipples, collar bones, as if Harry wanted to memorize all of him.
On the second floor the door to the room where Draco was sleeping wasn’t closed. The blond wasn’t sleeping peacefully but seemed to be having a bad dream. At first he was only frowning and moaning softly but soon he started trashing in the bed and his whimpering became more frequent. Harry didn’t want to disturb him but he couldn’t let him continue having this nightmare. He sat on the edge of the bed and reached out to shake the blond gently.
"No, my little prince, you didn’t deserve it. And after we heal you with the potion we can get you help in Saint Mungo’s."
After Harry left the room Draco went to the bathroom to run himself a relaxing steaming bath. He set on the edge of it as he watched it fill up, sometimes checking the temperature with his hand. When there was enough water, he removed his clothes. As he did so, he noticed his reflection in the mirror.
Harry was no longer hard, he wanted to show his Slytherin prince exactly how beautiful he was and how much he wanted him but this was not time to play around. So he moved to lie next to Draco, leaving one hand on his waist.
"You have your mother’s eyes, Harry Potter. I remember the wand I sold her. Ten and a quarter inches long, swishy, made of willow. Nice wand for charm work. Your father had a mahagony one, eleven inches, pliable but powerful." Ollivander says as he measures Harry’s wand hand.
"No, thank you, Mr. Ollivander. I’m nothing like my father." I say and he is surprised. Probably doesn’t get many people refusing to try his wands. I hope I didn’t offend him, I didn’t mean to.
"That’s different, Ron. I was at the Hogwarts when Harry came there." Hermione tried to reason with him.
is a light spell, used for cleaning but what do you think happens if somebody points their wand at your eyes and casts it? Most of the wizarding families, especially the ones with long tradition, understand this and continue to learn both Light and Dark Arts. But I guess yours is an exception, you are a Weasley, aren’t you?" I ask and look him up and down. To Harry and Hermione, it looks harmless, but I can tell he knows I’m judging him.
"I know what you think Hermione. He was a prat sometimes, but he wants to talk to you and apologize." Harry explained, looking at Hermione with a hope that she will understand and give Draco a chance.
"Hermione, I’m glad to see you too. How are you? Ron is with his family?" asked Harry.
Good, with Voldemort prancing though the Hogwarts, I’m not very comfortable that Harry and Hermione don’t know even basic defence. But they will learn, we can even have first session this weekend.
His delicate bones were visible, fragile shoulders and ribs to count. Platinum blond hair was partially covering his face, his lips were parted and he was breathing faster, arousal clear in his eyes.
Hermione pulled Ron away. "Ron, stop! It’s not like that! Harry took him here to protect him. Look, Harry is alright. We were just at Hogwarts to pick up something. Draco didn’t do anything wrong." Hermione said and looked at Harry who was already kneeling down next to Draco and murmuring finite incantatem to get rid of the ropes.
He always admired the Gryffindor, felt almost magnetic pull towards him, wanted to be his friend. Circe, if he didn’t butcher his introduction back in the first year, they might have been friends but he wanted to impress him so much he went overboard. When he failed to become Harry's friend, Draco settled for trying to catch his attention, even if it meant insulting him and his friends. He would do anything to have Harry’s eyes on him.
Harry thought blushing Draco was quite cute. He undressed and got under the covers with him. He was just reaching for the switch of the lamp when Draco stopped him.
Suddenly he looks a bit discouraged. "I don’t know latin, Draco. I don’t know any spells. I don’t know how to fly. I don’t know anything. Wizards seem to talk a lot about pride. I’ve never made anybody proud. I’ve mostly made my uncle and aunt disgusted or angry."
"I’m sorry." He mumbled, embarrassed.
When Harry returned from the Burrow, it was after midnight. He didn’t mean to stay over so long, but he had to calm down distraught Mrs. Weasley and explain to her why is Ron unconscious and why Hermione wouldn’t attend the funeral tomorrow.
"Unfortunately, yes, he has to be awake. Also any mind altering spell would render the ritual useless." Hermione explained, feeling sorry for Draco.
"Mother, father, do we have any seers in our family?"
"It’s that good isn’t it?" Harry asked and laughed a little. "Kreacher never bothered making pancakes before but now that you are here, it’s Slytherin prince this and Slytherin prince that. "
"Draco, stop it, you are hurting yourself." Harry said as he approached the blond who didn’t show any sign of hearing him. So Harry sat on the edge of the bathtub and caught Draco’s wrists, forcing him gently to stop. Draco gasped and jerked at the contact as if only know he realized there was somebody with him in the room.
"I will be going then, I shouldn’t be late to the funeral."
"Alright, I will be right in the next room if you need me. Good night, Draco."
"You are in love with him." Hermione stated, not at all surprised.
Draco pulled Harry’s hands away from his face and their eyes met.
"Most curious, most curious indeed, 14 inches long, snake wood with basilisk’s horn core. I thought I will never be able to sell it, as only the descendants of Salazar Slytherin have the ability to wield this wand. Rumour has it, it was Slytherin himself who made it." Ollivander explains.
"The fire won’t burn you. I won’t let anything bad happen to you little prince. You said you trust me."  Harry said as continued caressing the blond’s back.
Harry moved to lean back against the headboard and Draco kneeled between his legs. He massaged Harry’s member through the thin fabric of his pants a bit and then unzipped them. He pushed them down along with the underwear and freed Harry’s erection. His eyes widened.
"I overheard a bit of what you two were talking about, Draco, are you hurt somewhere?"
"But it’s your first kiss, it should be special."
If that by any chance works out, then my parents and everybody else will not die and the world will not be on a bring of destruction. No, I don’t feel the crushing weight of responsibility at all.
"Harry… " Draco breathed, relieved. He was confused, for a second he thought he as back at the manor. He leaned closer to Harry but hesitated, remembering being pushed away before. He backed a bit and tried to cover his erection in embarrassment.
"No, I don’t." Draco replied, his voice hoarse. His throat was dry and he undid two of his shirt buttons, trying to get more comfortable.
"Let's go home. " Harry said and Draco thought he could barely breathe, let alone stand or go anywhere but it didn't matter because Harry already had them apparating away, back to the bed in his room in Grimmauld place.
"Yes… and no. You don’t understand. I am dirty." Draco pulled away his hand from Harry, hugging it close to his body. "You shouldn’t even touch me, you wouldn’t if you knew what things I’ve done. I am disgusting." Draco whispered and hid his face in the palms of his hands.
"Flattery, flattery. I’m serious Draco."
Thank you for your support, kudos and comments. They mean a lot to me.
"Does it feel okay, Harry?" Draco asked with a uncertain voice, looking up at Harry from under his blond hair.
Draco’s breathing was growing ragged. Harry could tell he was getting close. He traced his thumb over Draco’s soft lips, he wanted to kiss him senseless but was afraid to stop watching his reactions in case something went wrong.
We arrive to the small house in Surrey and my parents stand behind me when I ring the bell. Tall bony woman with a very long neck opens the door and looks at us. She is surprised because we look like a perfect muggle family, no wands or brooms in sight, just expensive car and clothes and polished looks. She is impressed.
"Wait, that sounds... how long were you there, Potter?"
"Yeah, past lives."
"Yes." Draco agreed. He wasn’t worried about the potion. He trusted Snape’s expertise and Hermione’s brewing skills, it was going to work.
"I trust him." Harry whispered back. "Also I recognize some of it. He is drawing upon his blood’s power, upon his ancestors, using his own magic in only minimal amount. It’s actually very elegant."
"Not at all, my dear Hermione. There are many types of Weasleys, some of them are idiots but some of them are clever and useful." I say and go looking for the redheaded twin terrors.
"Not at all, Draco. It’s good for him, the elf looks much happier then before and I get to eat too. Here, have another piece." Harry said and fed Draco another piece of the pancake before the blond could even try to protest. Just in that moment Hermione ran into the kitchen.
"Shut up, Hermione! It’s always like this with the two of you!" Ron shouted while standing up. "I see the way you look at each other, like you two know things that nobody else does, like you two have secrets together that dumb Ron wouldn’t understand. But I’m not dumb! So tell me, and tell me the true, how long have you two been fucking?"
"Yes, on some subconscious level I must have. But I longed for your company as well. And you, even though we were supposed to be enemies, never seriously hurt me. When it mattered, you protected me not caring that it put you at risk."
"Draco Malfoy, that was some excellent reaction and quick thinking. And the way you handled two brooms! You helped fellow student even though he wasn’t from your house. Ten points to Slytherin!"
"He admitted he actually admires you quite a bit."
"Is Malfoy hurt? I mean, is Draco hurt?" Hermione asked.
"Yes," I say and Harry nods. "I heard there are empty positions of Seeker and Keeper. I myself would be interested in trying out for Keeper’s position and I think, Harry would be an excellent Seeker, he has the reflexes and eyes for that."
"Michael, this is Harry, he is the tattoo artist I told you about." Hermione said.
Auror Robards stood up and approached Draco Malfoy giving him a small glass with clear liquid. "Do you agree to be questioned under veritaserum?" he asked and Draco nodded. "Good, then drink this, all of it."
"Then, let’s proceed." Hermione said gravely. This was the only memory she doctored a tiny bit, erasing Draco’s Dark Mark from his forearm but she knew nobody would notice. She did a perfect job and even if she didn’t, the content of the memory was too shocking for anybody to pay attention to Draco’s arm.
"I’m starting to get why you dislike Dumbledore." Hermione says as she helps me put Harry to bed.
My mother takes in how malnourished and small Harry looks and how old his clothes are and presses her lips into thin line. I’m bit afraid she will hex the woman and we will have to pay ministry to cover it up like we usually do, for which we don’t really have time at the moment, we have a train to catch. But my mother is an embodiment of self-control like usually.
We continue our lesson and it’s soon quite obvious that me and Harry are the best flyers in our year. Madam Hooch even allows us to separate from our group and have a race around the Black Lake.
"I couldn't let you die Draco. " Harry said softly, rubbing gentle circles over back of Draco's hands.
We board the train and when Hermione Granger passes our compartment, I smile at her.
"I don’t have a wand, I lost it." Draco said and faced Hermione and Harry sitting on the bed. "Can either of you lend me your wand? This spell I’m thinking of, it’s blood magic, only I can do it."
"Since we are doing this friendship thing, we shouldn’t lie to each other you know?" Harry said as he sat on the chair across the table from Draco.
"Good." I say and let my fingers run through the mess of Harry’s hair. It doesn’t look like it but it’s really soft. He looks better now, his expression relaxed. "Quirrell will be dealt with."
"Nice to meet you Harry. I was wondering, I don’t know that many of the other first years, would you maybe like to do a bit of shopping together?"
"Harry… Please, make love to me." Draco pleaded, pressing his body closer to Harry’s.
"Yes, it’s a complicated spell but it doesn’t take much energy to perform." Draco explained. "Besides, Kreacher will help."
"I want to try flying. I really do," he practically jumps with excitement. Jeez, little Harry is way too cute.
"I was taller than you until last year!" Draco pouted.
Draco nodded. "Harry, kiss me…" he muttered and Harry obliged, leaning over to kiss Draco gently. They let their lips slide against each other, movements slow and deliberate, unhurriedly exploring and enjoying the sensations.
"Draco, are you okay in there?" Harry  knocked on the bathroom door. "May I come inside?" he asked. There wasn’t any reply but he could hear water slushing around quietly. "Alright, I’m worried about you, I’m coming in." he said and opened the door.
"If anything happens, I will help you, I’ve got my wand with me. Alright, let’s do this." I say and let go of his broom handle.
Harry took a step closer and caressed Draco’s cheek.
Harry knew Lucius Malfoy was a cruel man but he didn't think he would ever turn against his own family, especially against his heir. He was shocked by Draco's words. He kneeled next to Draco and pulled the crying boy into hug. Draco didn't put up any resistance and just continued crying.
"It feels absolutely bloody amazing." Harry marvelled and sighed happily. Seeing Draco, kneeling on the ground, touching his feet was making him feel all kinds of things, the situation was strangely intimate yet it felt so right. He thought, not for the first time, how beautiful the blond was.
"I would love to but my family is very strict. They don’t like magic."
"You just don’t have to try so hard for me. I’m not worth it. Besides can we even change destiny?" Draco mumbled against Harry’s chest.
"No, at least not physically but... he looked so broken when I got there. Couldn’t even stand by himself."
"I’ve flown before but Harry is really amazing, this was actually his first time on the broom. Congratulation on winning our race." I say proudly and put arm around his shoulders. He blushes and leans into my side mumbling thanks.
"I know if somebody can make it, it’s you Draco. Just remember all I’ve told you about Harry and use it, don’t let Dumbledore see your thoughts and make sure you gather strong allies."
Draco nodded but his head was still spinning with images.
"Flying? Wow. But what about the last thing he said?" Harry asks.
"Okay, Harry." Draco agreed and averted his eyes.
"Ron, don’t talk to her like that. She haven’t done anything wrong." Said Harry
I thank him and step aside so that Harry can take my place and chose his wand.
"I can’t do it. Not anymore. Not for him." Ginny whispered between sobs. "I would mess up. I’m sorry."
"Thank you so much, Harry. That would be great, also if I stay here, I can fully focus on Snape’s research."
"You will need to relax, release all your barriers. Do you trust me?" Harry asked.
Just as the last time, he is nervous and jumpy and pushes off hard too early. He rises higher and higher without any control over his broom what so ever.
"I’m serious Draco, did you get hurt during the battle? Do you need to go see a healer?"
"There were many more lives after but we were never friends again and things weren’t peaceful anymore. We were always on the opposite sides, always fighting. For some reason I couldn’t grasp at the time, it always felt strange to look at you, meeting you was different from meeting anybody else, it hurt me somehow, but now I think I know why." Harry said and smiled sadly.
"We will find out. Alright then, I better get down and deal with Ron."
"Wonderful, Slytherin team has practise twice a week on Tuesday and Friday morning, of course the final decision about you joining the team lies with the Captain but I’m sure Mr. Flint will be delighted to have you two."
"I’m so sorry Draco, I hoped this wouldn’t be necessary but…." Hermione said softly and then continued speaking to the Wizengamot confidently. "I’m deeply disappointed in a way we treat the ones who were hurt during the war.  Draco Malfoy is a victim and yet, he is treated like a criminal."
Harry waited a bit but then pulled out of the hug and guided Draco towards the small wooden platform.
"I said eat, Draco," Harry said firmly. "Or should I feed you?"
"I don’t want a mind healer. I only want to be with you." Draco said and gasped, realizing what he just admitted.
"Lucius Malfoy found out that when Voldemort asked Narcissa to check whether I was alive, she lied. He was angry and killed her. Then tried to kill Draco, that’s when I arrived. Thank god I managed to shield him but Lucius escaped." Harry explained.
So he rested and read. He wasn’t able to focus very well though. His thoughts kept going to Harry. He was drunk on finally getting Harry’s attention. The way Harry held him when they slept, the gentle tone of his voice, his warm hands -  it was what Draco always wished for.
I focus on the matchbox in my palm and transfigure it into cute little red pincushion with sixteen needles stuck in it. McGonagall is delighted.
He wasn’t going to last much longer, the pressure was building, his balls full and drawing up. And then he was coming, wave of intense and all consuming pleasure flooding his whole body as he emptied himself into Draco’s willing mouth.
"Of course, Professor."
"More like emotionally manipulated… but yes, that’s the gist of it. You didn’t want me and I made you touch me and I’m sorry."
"No. My father did." Draco replied, shaking. His heart was beating fast and he broke cold sweat. The veritaserum was too strong, he was getting dizzy.
They were now both lying on their sides, facing each other.
"Harry…" he breathed out.
In a minute or two the buzzing stopped, and Draco breathed out. He set his wand down and dared to open his eyes to look around himself.
"Beautiful reaction. Most curious method young Mr. Malfoy, it seems you and your wand chose each other. It’s ten inches long, hawthorn wood and unicorn hair core, springy." Ollivander says.
"No, he wasn’t. He has no right to talk about you like that." Said Harry and tightened his hold around Draco.
"You are worried about me. You don’t need to be worried about me." Harry chuckled but enjoyed his fussing.
"I wanted to do this for you ever since we were in a third year in Hogwarts." Draco admitted, blushing. "I wanted to... " Draco didn’t know how to continue, he managed a small smile but his eyes were troubled.
"Draco Lucius Malfoy, you are being charged with quite heinous crimes, including murder of Albus Dumbledore, murder of Narcissa Malfoy and being Death Eater, therefore torturing and killing muggleborns, muggles and serving Voldemort. How do you plead?" Griselda Marchbanks’s voice thundered through the courtroom, making everybody focus on her.
Draco wasn’t able to walk on his own so Harry carried and gently lowered him on the bed. He lied down next to him and pulled him onto his chest into a hug.
"I just didn’t get a chance to hand it back to you yet." Harry explained and Draco looked a bit annoyed.
"Fucking Ron Weasley, just how strong did he have to kick you? Asshole." Harry cursed angrily.
Hermione coughed a bit. Her face was coloured pink with embarrassment upon seeing the intimacy between Draco and Harry but she was smiling a bit too.
"You letting me kiss you like this, letting me bind you, trusting me with the ritual, you don’t know how much it means to me Draco. You don’t know what you do to me." Harry whispered into Draco’s ear and stroked his hair. "How do you feel?"
"I don’t know, maybe there is other way. But Snape is quite adamant in his notes that the fire purification and then taking the potion is the safest way to go around it. And I honestly don’t know how much time we have to look for some other method with the state Draco’s in."
"Shh, no, no Azkaban. We will go home, Draco." Harry said and Draco pressed himself as close as possible to the black haired wizard, as if touching him could wash away all the humiliation and pain he was feeling.
(See the end of the chapter for
"The next memory is the one of Narcissa Malfoy’s death." Hermione said and glanced at Draco. He looked small, frightened and breakable. She was incredibly sorry that she had to put him through this but she had to fight for his freedom and just simply saying he didn’t do it wouldn’t persuade the Wizengamot.
"Yes, but…" Harry was going to say something but Draco put his fingers on Harry’s lips in indication to be quiet.
"Yes, Fred’s funeral." Harry said and went quiet for a while. "I will be gone all day but there is something I want to do before leaving."
Harry knew he should give Draco some privacy but still his eyes were scanning over the blond’s body, looking at the scratch marks. But soon Draco was wrapped in the thick bathrobe.
Malfoy was just sitting down on a chair when Harry entered kitchen. Harry noticed he looked in pain but as soon as Draco saw him enter his expression changed to neutral.
"Now, may somebody explain to me what just happened?" he asks.
This time, things really are different. Ollivander didn’t offer Harry the twin wand of Voldemort, so if they face each other, the wands will not cancel each other out. Instead, he got Slytherin’s wand, which I’m pretty sure is much more powerful if Harry masters it properly. But I don’t even want to think what happens if he doesn’t. So there we are, already messing with future and there is no way to know if it’s a good thing until it will be too late to do anything about it. Fuck.
"Draco, you cannot sleep in the bath. Come on, wake up." Harry said as he got closer. He summoned one of the big towels to hand it to Draco as he was sure the blond would be embarrassed about the situation Harry found him in.
I find Fred and George Weasley in one of the unused classrooms, making some kind of explosive candies.
"You are new, so you don’t know it, but our house is very loyal to it’s members, we won’t go running to teachers just because you said something controversial," one of the older girls says and smiles at me. "What’s said at the Slytherin table stays at the Slytherin table."
"Ron, what have you done? Are you mental?" asked Harry.
"I’m Harry Potter."
"Mrs. Dursley, if you don’t mind, we would like to have Harry over during the Christmas Holiday, would that be acceptable for you?"
"As I said, the first life I remember, we have lived in the times of peace but that was the only time. After that, the lands in which we lived were plagued by war, sickness and poverty. I don’t know if I should call it destiny, bad luck or if it’s some kind of elaborate curse but you’ve always died young, never older then twenty. I’ve seen you die so many times Draco and I couldn’t do anything or didn’t get there until it was too late. And the last time you died, it was my fault." Harry said and covered his face with hands.
"So what else is there in Snape’s notes?"
"Do we have something for Draco for the pain?" Harry asked Hermione, who started rumbling in one of the boxes.
Draco looked down at his lap. "I have been for some time." Draco admitted and bit his lip.
"There, all done. " Harry said and run his palm across Draco’s skin again, as if admiring his handiwork.
"No, Harry. You yourself suspected there was some destiny or curse or whatever at work here. And you know what? I think you are right. I think I was supposed to die like that. I think I’m supposed to die young this time as well. It only makes sense with how screwed up my life is. Maybe you went twice against destiny saving my ass in The Room of Hidden Things and in The Forest. And maybe you and Granger are going against it again, trying to save me now."
"The dorms have rooms by two, you have been assigned them randomly. If you take the corridor on the right, you will find the name tags on your doors. Feel free to ward them for privacy. Aw, look!" the prefect says, pointing at the window. "Even the squid has come to say hi to our lovely first years."
"Prince, huh?" Harry asked teasingly Draco.
"And I will start preparing everything for our Slytherin prince." Hermione said with a spark in her eyes.
"Yeah, he has made himself enemies on both sides. I’m not going to tell anybody Harry. We can just tell everything up to the point of you hiding him, if anybody asks, just tell that after shielding him he apparated away. "
"Hermione, tell me this is just a dream." the redhead whispered as angry tears started to run down her cheeks.
Hermione had already casted all the necessary protective spells on Draco and they were waiting for it to get dark, as the ritual had to be performed on the night of summer solstice to be most potent.
"Kreacher," Harry called.
Draco nodded and Harry casted the spell with a swish of his wand and a whisper. Draco expected rough ropes digging into his skin but instead got cool soft silk binding him, his arms were bound behind the pole, his body to it and then there was silk tying his legs together. Draco breathed out in relief, his movement was restricted but he felt calmer now and safer, knowing he cannot compromise the ritual and ruin his chances at getting better like this.
Harry uncorked it with his teeth. "Drink this, it will make you feel better," he said as he poured the small bottle's contents into Draco’s mouth. The blond obediently swallowed.
I used to be so concerned about my appearance, I was good looking proud pure blood from noble family. Now none of it mattered, nobody cared about my family, those who did were all dead. And we had no time to mourn the countless dead. Weasleys, Greengrasses, Boneses, Bagshots, Aldertons, Nettles… and so many other families, completely wiped out. And that’s just wizards, if we were to talk about dead muggles the numbers would be in millions. So cruel was the reign of Voldemort.
"Harry…" Draco whimpered nervous and scared.
Draco entered the courtroom with Hermione behind him, Harry was already sitting on one of the benches besides Wizengamot members. Draco was nervous even though he had a big vial of calming draught just a few minutes ago. They didn’t have much time for preparation, Hermione only extracted a few memories from him, she was so quick he wasn’t even sure which ones, and talked him through main points of his defence.
"You seem different Potter, older somehow," Draco remarked and pulled his hand away from Harry’s.
"Harry, Draco, this is Michael, he is here for the tattoo." Hermione introduced the boy. They have been looking for a way to erase Draco’s Dark Mark for days without any success until Hermione came up with idea that maybe it could be transferred instead of erased. Only they would need a volunteer.
Draco only now realized they weren’t in the room alone and hastily moved away from Harry’s lap, he scanned the room for a place to hide away from the girls but there wasn’t any and the two of them were blocking the door. So he stayed sitting next to Harry, who placed a hand on the small of his back as if to say that it’s okay and he will take care of this.
"Okay, but he will have to apologize. What he did was unacceptable."
The whole Wizengamot went silent. This was not what they expected the trial of son of such a well known Death Eater as Lucius Malfoy was to go like.
"Hermione, how are we going to find it?" Harry looked around exasperated.
It seemed so long but then it was over, it must have been, because suddenly he could no longer hear the crackling of fire and the silk binding him disappeared. As soon as the restraints were gone he drew his knees up, hugging them, he was shaking, not able to stop. He thought about getting away but couldn't move anymore. The fire was extinguished but he was afraid to open his eyes and fighting an urge to vomit.
I decided to take into account a opinion of Homoho3, who wrote in her comment: ”alright boys enough with the chit chat now K-I-S-S”.
"No." Draco whispered. He was lucky Robards phrased the question like that, if he asked whether Draco ever was a Death Eater, the answer would be different.
And he was so gentle, so caring and he didn’t even hate him. He saved him, offered him friendship and protection. Harry was everything Draco ever wanted and more. Maybe if it wasn’t for the last year, Draco might have gathered his courage and confessed his feelings for the Gryffindor even if he didn't believe in favourable outcome. But now he was damaged goods, ugly and dirty.
"Okay, then close your eyes and try imagining yourself succeeding at the spell. You made it and you are holding perfect sharp needle in your fingers. Imagine the details, how shiny it is, how it would hurt if you pricked your finger, how you can put the thread through the hole in it. And don’t force it, relax." I instruct her and notice that Harry is also listening. He, so far, made no progress with his match.
"It’s alright, it’s my house now. There isn’t anybody here."
Harry decided to go back to Hogwarts to look for Snape’s research about Draco’s condition and also to recover ingredients needed to brew the potion that Draco was used to taking for pain.
"Hermione is right. Absolutely brilliant. The windows look much better then before. They are bigger, aren’t they?" Harry inquired with a smile.
"Draco didn’t kill his mother, he loved her dearly and she loved him." Hermione stated. "Narcissa Malfoy was a good woman, good mother and she played crucial role in defeating Voldemort. She died a horrible death at the hands of somebody she trusted, her husband Lucius Abraxas Malfoy. Her son had nothing to do with it."
"Madame Head Warlock, you can see that Draco is under considerable stress, may he be excused for the next part?" Hermione tried asking, her eyes pleading with the elderly witch.
"I could have fought him more." Draco stated.
Hagrid is a bit embarrassed about the whole episode and changes the topic quickly.
"What are you talking about Hermione?" Harry asked, wrapping both his arms protectively around Draco, who was still unable to catch his breath.
Bell rings somewhere in the shop as we step inside. I go to the counter first because I can see Harry is a bit nervous about wand shopping.
"Bit nervous but safe." Draco replied softly, leaning into Harry’s touch.
"Ron, it’s not like that, me and Harry, we are just friends." Hermione tried to explain.
"A bit? They are broken into such a tiny pieces that they are impossible to use reparo on." Hermione exclaimed.
"Azkaban?" Draco asked, voice barely hearable.
Dear Merlin, Harry wanted him so much, wanted to devour him. Fuck him deep and hard until he forgets that Voldemort ever touched him. And then make sweet love, soft and tender. Make him come over and over again, until he wouldn’t even be able to leave the bed, all limp and blissed out.
"I will tell you a secret but you must not tell anybody." Harry said, his eyes glinting.
"He is so beautiful." Harry whispered. He could hear the windows coming back together and cracks in the walls getting filled but he couldn’t take his eyes of Draco to check.
"Ginny, trust me I wouldn’t have wanted you to find out about me and Draco in this way." Harry said.
"This is not what we agreed on." Harry said and pulled Draco’s face closer, kissing the corner of his mouth. "I like this. But not if you’re only doing it because you think you have to." He said and looked into Draco’s eyes sternly.
"No, he was right…" Draco mumbled between hiccups. And Harry thought seeing the little Slytherin prince hiccup would be adorable if it wasn’t for the severity of the situation.
"Draco, you just don’t understand, do you?" Harry asked and caressed his face, tracing his fingers gently from his temple to his jaw. "You are my soulmate. We were made for each other."
"Sure, but where are you going?"
He opens his mouth to protest but Harry stops him.
At first their lips just brushed against each other but then Harry deepened the kiss and all Draco could think about was Harry. Harry’s warm lips, Harry’s hand pressed into his back  pulling him impossibly closer and the other one tangled in Draco’s hair, Harry’s smell. It was like a sensory overload, all that mattered was Harry surrounding him and exploring his mouth.
"No, I finally see things clearly. Great Harry Potter, fucking his best friend’s girlfriend and playing house with death eaters." Smirked Ron and then looked Hermione in the eyes. "I wish I knew what a slut you wer before I started to like you. It’s over between us. You just couldn’t help yourself but spread your legs for the savior, huh? How was it? How did it feel to have-"
"I also mentioned long time exposure."
When it was done Kreacher moved to kneel on the opposite side of the circle facing Draco and placed his hands on the outline of the circle. Draco did the same but only with one hand. He took the wand in the other and pointed it towards his neck. He closed his eyes in concentration and started murmuring spell neither Hermione nor Harry recognized.
"Feels good…" Draco said softly and Harry could feel him relaxing in his arms.
"It just hurts all the time, Harry… I’m so tired. I miss my mum. I miss Snape. I miss the old me," he whispered and Harry felt his heart breaking for the shaking blond boy. Draco used to be taller then him but over the past year they both changed. Harry grew up and filled up a bit, he was no longer the scrawny kid with ideal build for seeker. Year of camping with Hermione and Ron toughened him up a bit and he gained some muscles despite not always having much to eat.
"Harry, I didn’t expect you back so quickly, but I’m glad to see you," Hermione said.
"Oh, Draco. That’s not it. Don’t be scared." Harry only now realized how he scared the blond boy. Draco must have confused Harry’s actions for something sexual.
Draco sat down and stared at his breakfast. He was hungry and it looked quite appetizing, it were his favourite blueberry pancakes, but Draco knew his manners and since Hermione wasn’t down yet, he decided to wait for the witch. Anyway, the food was put under stasis charm and wouldn’t go cold.
"Stay." Harry commanded and Draco relaxed again against his body. Being held by Harry was like a dream, Draco never thought he would ever love someone so much, hadn’t even known he had it in himself. But with Harry wrapped all around him, his chin pressed into his hair, his hand on Draco's neck, stroking the fine hair there at the nape. Merlin, it was too much.
"Harry… I need to go." She whispered quietly, hurt obvious in her voice.
"But Harry." Draco whimpered.
"Yes, I am perfectly capable of taking care of myself." Draco smirked. "I’ve done so for 17 years and look how well it worked." he chuckled.
"Of course, master Malfoy," Kreacher said but kept throwing suspicious glances in Draco’s direction.
"You cannot 'fix it'. You want to know what is wrong? I will tell you what is wrong. I have nerves, muscles and magical core damage due to the long time exposure to the cruciatus curse. That's what you wanted to hear? Happy now?"
"But he liked me. We were lovers." Draco said, barely audible.
"There isn’t any... My mother asked Snape to do some research to come up with potion that would help and he was working on it but he is dead now, so no luck there. I’m also out of the potion he gave me for managing the pain, I used up the last of it during the battle." Draco explained like if it didn’t really matter to him.
And then Draco let out a moan that was almost Harry’s name and came, climax burning through his body as it tensed in pleasure. Harry found it fascinating that the blond managed to keep their eye contact through his orgasm, looking all wide – eyed and blissed as he spilled himself into Harry’s palm.
"Are you staying with me tonight?" Draco asked, hoping for a positive answer. He enjoyed sleeping together with Harry, he almost didn’t have any nightmares that way.
I hold out my arm for him to measure and he explains about the magical cores of wands. I know all of it and I also know what wand I want - my old wand.
Draco didn't remember falling asleep but he woke up to hushed conversation between Hermione and Harry. He was between Harry's legs, slumped against his chest and felt so comfortable, safe and warm, he didn’t want to move. But at the same time he thought he should move, it was so intimate. He started moving away but Harry just tightened his arm around Draco's waist, resting his chin on the top of Draco's head.
"Draco, what did you dream about?" Harry asked and Draco looked up at him. Hair was partially covering his face.
"But…" Draco started to say something but Harry didn’t wait for him to formulate the thought and interrupted him.
"But I don’t mind the bruises anyway." Draco said quietly.
And I'm sorry for what I'm putting Draco through. At the start of the chapter, he is clingy but mentally, he is doing very well, considering everything. But he is really shaken up by the trial. It's like nothing good ever lasts for Draco.
"Alright, alright. Let’s get to the grounds then."
"You are serious, aren’t you? Shouldn’t you let know one of the professors instead of us, little Slytherin?" George or Fred ask me.
"Look, I will not force you to tell me anything but I want you to know that I will be there if you need me. I will listen and I won’t judge you." Harry said and maintained eye contact with Draco, who was slightly frowning.
"You are serious, aren’t you? You aren’t making this up?" Draco asked.
"He beat you." Harry realized and his eyes widened.
"Harry…. please, stay with me? I’m still cold…" Draco asked softly.
Harry rubbed their groins together and Draco’s breath hitched.
With the combination of the hot water surrounding him and the potion Harry made him take earlier in his system, the pain he usually felt was just a dull remainder at the back of his mind. This was as good as it gets for Draco.
"It was more of a group effort, really. Besides what he was wasn’t really alive." Harry explained. Draco shuddered and looked worried, so Harry continued. "But don’t worry, this time he really won’t be able to come back."
I'm thankful to any of you who follow up when I post new chapter. Your comments and kudos motivate me tremendously. Please let me know what you think of this chapter ^^.
He approached the girls who were watching the whole interaction between him and Draco and chuckled. "Are you two ready?"
My father starts laughing but I know he isn’t laughing at me. He is happy, which doesn’t happen very often, about the idea of using my connection to Harry for strengthening his political career. He doesn’t yet know how much I plan to influence his political career myself, but all in due time.
"Damn it Draco, stop avoiding the subject, how can I fix it, if you don’t tell me what is wrong?"
"We should try for Quidditch Harry, you are going to love flying."
Harry walked over to Draco and pulled him up into a hug. Draco seemed so calm, talking about this as if it had nothing to do with him, as if it was all about somebody else but now, Harry could feel him trembling in his arms. The blond boy started sobbing and Harry held him tighter.
"Yeah, I woke up early. And you don’t have to wait for her, she is working on the research."
When we enter the Slytherin common room, I’m struck by the nostalgy. The walls made of carved stone, windows looking into the Black Lake, the black concert piano in the corner, the gothic feel of it all. The black leather armchairs and sofas and our big stone fireplace, filling the dungeons with warmth. Oh, home sweet home.
"Actually, I heard you practise a bit of Alchemy professor, I’m very interested in it myself but all the Alchemy books are in the restricted section."
Dear readers,
Now, Harry was in the kitchen, reading Prophet when he heard movement in the bedroom upstairs. He went to see Draco with a small tray of food.
"Do you remember my father’s walking stick?" Draco asked timidly.
"Damn it," cursed Harry and ran out of the castle.
After Dumbledore’s nonsense speech everybody claps and cheers and Harry asks me whether Dumbledore is a bit mad.
Draco watched the memory with hands covering his mouth, trying to hold back the tears but it didn’t work, he couldn’t stop them. Harry was fighting the urge to get to his side to hold him, comfort him, do anything but interrupting the trial wasn’t in Draco’s best interest so he held back.
I shared my visions with her after I rescued her and Weasley. At that time, I didn’t care about her, but I needed an ally.
"Not going to forbidden forest is reasonable but not doing magic outside of classes is nonsense, just don’t get caught. " Blaise says and I agree.
"I never found out why you did it." Harry said quietly.
"We can't keep kneeling here, let me help you to one of the beds, alright?" Harry said and pulled the blond boy up. It was so easy, Draco lost a lot of weight, he leaned onto Harry as if he didn't have any strength left to carry himself but Harry didn't mind. He helped Draco to the bed and sat himself at the edge of it. The blond was still crying and Harry couldn't get himself to leave the room.
(See the end of the chapter for
When my head stops spinning I realize I am lying on the floor. It is a nice dark hardwood floor - our floor. I look at my hands and they are small like when I was a child. Check my forearm, the dark mark is gone. It worked, it worked, I am back in the Malfoy mansion and I am eleven years old kid again.
"I asked how long have you two been fucking?!" Ron thundered.
"I thought so." Hermione smiled.
He looked into the blond’s eyes, they were full of not only want but also trust and dependence. Draco really was special. No one had ever got under his skin so much.
"It’s targeting nerve endings, all of them at once, in a way that feels similar to being burned by fire. It’s painful sensory overload, forcing body muscles to flex and spasm as a side effect. Overtime there are tears in muscles and nerves, first tiny ones then they get bigger. Even when the curse is not being performed, one slowly stops being able to control their body. Because of the damage, low intensity pain is constant and the spasms occur any time body is under stress. Similar with the magical core and one’s mind, it’s like it has been teared and sticked together way too many times. I’m actually quite lucky to be alive and relatively sane."
"Draco, Hagrid definitely didn’t mean that. If you want to be in Slytherin, then I would like to be there with you too."  Harry says and gives me a big smile.
Head Warlock Marchbanks was angry and so was Harry. There were always so many incompetent idiots at the ministry. If he thought he could help Draco in anyway, he would be right next to him but Hermione was handling the situation better then he would. He would have hexed Robards. He still might.
so here I'm with another chapter. We didn't get anywhere with the main storyline but get a lot of relationships developement between characters.
"Focus boy. You might yet have a chance at not spending lifetime in Azkaban if you reply no to my next question." Robards barked. "Draco Malfoy, did you or did you not serve the Lord Voldemort?"
"Some of them probably already have their own guesses but they wouldn’t go against Dumbledore since he is the one who hired Quirell."
"Where did that come from?" Hermione asked with raised eyebrows, but Harry ignored her.
I hope you will enjoy it.
"I’m so sorry for what happened to you Draco, I’m going to do my best to figure this out." Hermione said to Draco who still wasn’t in any state to respond.
When he arrived back at Grimmauld’s place the whole house felt noticeably different, calmer but charged with energy, it’s air cleaner, even Walburga wasn’t shrieking her usual insults. He knew better then to credit Kreacher's house keeping skills for the improvement even though he probably helped. Before Harry died, he never believed the whole thing about pure blooded superiority but the true was old blood and the magic tied to it was indeed special. He could almost feel the house trembling because it was occupied by what it and also the old elf recognized as true heir. Kreacher called Draco Slytherin prince, how fitting .Thinking about Draco as a prince brought a smile to his face. He should go check on him.
Draco Malfoy was getting used to living at Grimmauld’s place. It was not by any means home, it was a while since he could call any place home. The Malfoy manor used to be one until the Dark Lord and his death eaters poisoned it with their presence. He never had what one could call good relationship with his father but he only started hating him when he allowed their family manor to be desecrated like this.
"Yeah, don’t worry. It will be like yesterday." Draco mumbled and blushed a bit, averting his eyes from Harry.
"Elm and dragon heart-string, 14 inches, doesn’t bend easily." He tries to hand me a box but I refuse.
"It’s perfect. Hawthorne - crataegus is rather curious tree? Isn’t it? If you touch it without thinking you will get hurt but it has medicinal properties and symbolizes hope. This is great wood for healing and potion making. Rumours say it can protect you from vampires and dark curses. How much is it?" I ask.
"But he…" she started and paused, remembering the times he insulted her.
"I’m sure some of them know and can’t act on mere suspicion. But you can. If you would just get his funny turban off, I believe there would be enough proof to get rid of him."
"I don’t keep up any occlumency shields around you anymore. Go on," Draco said softly, full of trust.
"Of course the great Potter would just forget everything," Draco smirked. "But for what’s it worth, I’m sorry about all I have done to you. I truly am. Will you forgive me?" he asked quietly and looked into Harry’s eyes.
"Good Draco, it will start working soon. I’m sorry I wasn’t here. We’ve got Snape’s research, Hermione is going to work on it," Harry whispered as he held the sobbing blond.
"Harry, let’s not sugar coat it." Draco snapped and pulled away from the hug. He sat up on the bed and pulled up his sleeve. "You see this mark? It makes me exactly what Weasel said. It means I’m Dark Lord’s little bitch. Dirty little death eater. Weasel might not be the brightest tool in the shed but at least in his assessment of me, he is correct."
"Well, don’t worry Harry, anythin’s good as long as yer not in Slytherin," Hagrid says and I stop.
"I don’t know what I would do without meeting you in the Diagon Alley. You are my first friend Draco."
"It's not safe here, we have to go. " Harry explained as he tightened his hold on the blond's body. Then he aparrated the two of them to the sitting room of Grimmauld's place.
His eyes travelled lower, towards his chest, there were a few bruises beginning to form there, courtesy of the Weasel. Weasel might not be the brightest tool in the shed but he certainly wasn’t blind and he had a good intuition. He saw Draco for what Draco really was. Voldemort’s little bitch… Draco shuddered, did Weasel know how dead centre right he has been with his insults?
But then he felt Harry’s strong arms around himself, holding him tight, it was the only thing that could have made him feel better and it did. It seemed Harry always knew how to make Draco feel better. Draco hesitantly returned the hug and Harry shifted him onto his lap. Draco buried his face into Harry’s neck, his eyes still closed, drinking in Harry’s smell. He smelled like forest, moss and wilderness and Draco was quickly becoming addicted to it.
"I guess I forgot about them." Hagrid admitted.
"I can’t wait to make an ally of the little eleven year old Hermione Granger!" I say and actually laugh for the first time in several weeks.
I steer them to the back of the classroom so we would be as far away from Quirell as possible. In other classes, we usually sit in the front and Hermione gives me questioning look but doesn’t protest.
"That would be good next step, yes." he agreed.
"No, I want to see it go away." Draco shook his head.
Other students are looking forward to Defense against Dark Arts class but I’m nervous because I know that Quirell has Voldemort stuck at the back of his head. It’s revolting and I don’t want to be in the same room with him. But I cannot just skip it and even if I could, I wouldn’t send Hermione and Harry there alone.
"What are you doing?" Draco gasped, his eyes widening.
I have a plan of course, how to get him away from his lovely family but there are many things I need to set it motion for that - like capturing a rat, getting justice for one prisoner and getting my parents on a same page, so that they would support said prisoner. Because I’m not sure Dumbledore would, after all, he never showed much interest in the case of Sirius Black.
"Yeah, he can take this one." Hermione said and handed Harry one small bottle of potion.
And then they were alone, just Draco and Harry. "Are you ready, little prince?"
"As much as I deemed necessary." Robards smirked.
"Harry, we aren’t even friends 24 hours and you are already playing the friendship card, Merlin, you should have been sorted into Slytherin."
"Draco, shhh, you did nothing wrong. You aren’t dirty, you aren’t a whore." Harry said softly and caressed Draco’s back.
"And who might you be, young lady?" asked the Head Warlock, arching her eyebrows.
I would like to thank all of you who are keeping up with my updates. It makes me so happy to know that you guys are reading and enjoying my story.
"H-Harry…" Draco stuttered. He was somehow getting confused whether he was enjoying being touched by Harry like this or whether it was making him uncomfortable. Probably a bit of both.
"I know Hermione. And I know the little you will love all the books I will let her borrow from the Malfoy library. You will end up even more clever and knowledgeable than you are now, if it’s possible."
"Well, you will never get sorted in there, you’re a mudblood." Ron mumbles and Hermione freezes. Ah, so she already knows what that word means. She is hurt and looks like she might start crying soon. I remember myself calling her that in the original timeline and I regret it tremendously.
"Oh, I heard you grew up with muggles, that’s rather unfortunate," mother comments and Harry nods.
"She is beautiful." Draco said admiringly, not meeting Harry’s eyes.
"Yes, Harry. I’m sorry."
Hello my dear readers, I hope you will enjoy this chapter, I really tried hard with it. If you like it, please consider leaving comment or kudos. Thank you.
"Ancestors would be so proud of the Slytherin prince. Kreacher must go tell mistress." Kreacher squeaked happily and disappeared.
"Not at all. Classifying spells into Dark and Light is a wizard made concept, most of the time there is nothing about the spells themselves that make them so. You can use dark spells for good, for example secare
All eyes in the room focused on Draco and he hanged his head in shame.
Harry pulled Draco up and kissed him, tasting himself on the blond’s lips. "It was perfect my little prince, you were perfect."
"Take care and make me proud son," my father says while placing hand on my shoulder. For Lucius Malfoy, this is very affectionate gesture. I’m almost touched but actually a bit annoyed, all this talk about pride is what helped to fuck up my head when I really was eleven.
"The first memory I will present is the one with Albus Dumbledore, Draco was tasked by Voldemort to kill him, which was an impossible thing for him to do, considering the difference in their powers. True is, Voldemort just wanted to make Draco’s father Lucius suffer, by sending his son on an impossible mission he was doomed to fail and then punishing him. Let’s see the memory of the confrontation between Dumbledore and Draco Malfoy."
"At least the water wasn’t cold this time." Harry sighed and placed a hand on a smaller of Draco’s back to lead him out of the bathroom.
But in later years, he started to put the pieces together. His obsession with Harry, his constant need to watch him, his jealousy about anybody in Harry’s vicinity, his desperation for his attention – he was madly in love with Harry. But he knew that Harry would never love him back.
"There’s not a single witch or wizard who went bad who wasn’t in Slytherin. You-Know-Who was one."
He could barely hear Harry's voice talking to him, saying, "You’re going to be okay little prince, you’re going to get through. Just a little longer."
"It was damn hard climbing that tree!" Draco laughed as well. He felt lighter now that he shared his secret about having feelings for Harry with somebody.
"I’m sorry I wasn’t there to protect you Draco. It won’t happen next time, I will take care of you," whispered Harry as he caressed the blond’s back. Harry was so angry at Ron at the moment and he needed to feel Draco breathing and relatively alright in his arms to calm down. If he went to talk to Ron now he might do something he would regret. He felt so protective about the little Slytherin prince. It was like if the blond had talent for landing up in situations where he ends up hurt. Harry continued whispering softly comforting reassurances until Draco’s heart wrenching sobs reduced into quiet hiccups.
During his lifetimes, Harry kissed so many people he doesn’t even remember them all, yet none of it compared to kissing Draco. Having the Slytherin prince on his lap, holding on him for dear life, their bodies pressed together and their mouths and lips moving in unison was perfect. And the sweet sounds Draco was making were slowly starting to steer Harry’s mind towards other activities then just kissing.
"I’m glad you came back and killed him." Draco whispered.
The class eventually mounts the brooms and gets ready to take of. I prepare my wand and keep watching Neville, he might be awkward and not very good at magic but in the original timeline he killed Nagini and that counts.
He quickly found her.
"No, Harry, please, no fire." Draco whimpered. He was scared of fire. Just a mention of it reminded him of fiendfyre in the Room of Hidden Things and how he almost died it in. And how Crabbe did indeed died in it.
"Oh, the little Slytherin that keeps annoying our Ronniekins! We’ve heard all about you," one of them says and I honestly have no idea whether it’s Fred or George, I could never tell them apart.
He couldn't help but notice how thin did the blond get, he could count his ribs without any problem if he wanted to. Harry and Draco, they had such a long history. It should feel strange comforting somebody who was supposed to be his enemy for so many years but it didn't feel so. He only felt relief that he managed to shield Draco from that curse, relief that Draco was alive.
I enter Madam Malkin’s and the shop assistant asks me if I need robes for Hogwarts. I say I do and she ushers me onto small stool to take my measurements.
"It’s alright, Hermione. I have to go drop Ron there anyway. I will pick up your things and you can stay in the bedroom next to Draco’s, if you would like?"
"No, you are not. He has no idea what he was talking about."
"Well, it’s definitely better then asking Ron." Hermione remarked.
Harry sighed. There was no use skimming around the topic anymore. "It’s a fire purification ritual," he said simply.
"No, how could I be angry at you? You didn’t do anything wrong."
"So am I. After all, you made this. You are fucking nineteen years old and you made this." I say and wave the pocket watch in front of her face. It’s the most advanced time travelling machine that the wizarding kind has ever seen. It has it’s limitations though, according to all our calculations, the maximum possible range for me to jump without it killing me is 9 years. The most important difference between ministry approved time turners and this is, that I will not appear in the past as I am now, but my consciousness will travel back to my eleven years old body. Me in this time will stop to exist as well as this whole timeline because it will be rewritten by my actions. Or at least that is our plan.
"You are too thin. Eat." Harry commanded.
Harry caressed Draco’s cheek. "Anything. It’s alright, just ask."
My mother is alive again, I am so overcome with emotions and I hug her, blinking away the wetness threating to overflow from my eyes.
There is still a lot of chit chat, they have a lot of issues to go through but at least they do kiss.
"I should put him to Azkaban personally. See to it that he suffers and gets a Dementor’s kiss." Harry growled. "Since when did he beat you Draco?"
"Then no further questions Mrs. Head Warlock." Robards said to Marchbanks and went to sit down on the bench.
"Master Malfoy is lying to my half blood master. He must be hurt for he flinches in pain every time he moves," Kreacher said and placed the coffee mugs on the table. Harry raised a questioning eyebrow.
Harry breathed in sharply and pulled away to look at Draco’s face. His eyes were glazed, pupils dilated so much they were almost all black, with just a thin ring of silver around it. Harry placed his palm on the blond’s forehead and as expected, it was hot.
"Well, Kreacher keeps calling him that. And he certainly does how the aura." Hermione laughed as well.
"He was your first? " As upsetting as the whole thing was, Harry needed to make sure.
"What house do you think you will be in?" Ron asks Harry, clearly ignoring both me and Hermione.
"And you made the carpet muddy! Aren’t you and Granger proponents of house elf’s rights? And here you are making poor old Kreacher’s job more difficult. Sit down, let’s take of these shoes." Draco said and pushed Harry to sit on the bed.
"That’s enough Ron! You will not be talking like this to her. You are delusional!" shouted Harry.
"You have no scars from when I cursed you in the bathroom, I’m so glad." Harry said sounding relieved and Draco realized that’s what it was probably about.
"I understand. I hope we can still be friends Ginny. I’m sorry I didn’t make my feelings clear to you and that you found out like this." Harry said and pulled away from the hug.
"I’m sure he deserves a bit of luck. What will it feel like? Will it hurt?" Harry asked, concerned.
"You are not angry at me?" the blond asked quietly.
They stayed like that for a while but then Harry moved slightly away to be able to see Draco’s face.
Ollivander hands him more and more wands but none of them is the right one and they are both growing frustrated.
"What… happened? Harry?" He mumbled sleepily and Harry was glad to hear his voice.
Harry asked her if she could make sure Ron doesn’t spread around that Draco is staying at his house because it would put them in danger and Mrs. Weasley promised to do that.
"Maybe you could still use one?" Harry smiled at the blond.
I’m sharing room with Harry, which is just perfect. Our trunks are already there. We each have carved wooden four poster bed, there is another fireplace and nice big window facing the lake.
"Yeah, I never dated at school, I was worried my father wouldn’t approve. He was supposed to arrange a marriage for me. That’s how it usually works with pure bloods. But then the Dark Lord chose me to be his whore. So yeah, he was my first and only. First blowjob, first fucking, first everything. Or maybe not everything. He never kissed me." Draco admitted and hated himself for the sadness that crept into his voice.
Mother is surprised at such a display of emotion from my father but seems genuinely excited about the whole thing as well.
"I don’t think that’s true Draco, even in this life, when the Snatchers captured us and you were supposed to identify me, you didn’t. You looked at me and you knew and said nothing. Slytherins can be very loyal." Harry said knowingly.
Harry was swept with a sudden wave of warmth. Draco, with his childlike neediness and longing, wrapped up in a fluffy blanket was simply precious.
"It wouldn’t be so bad if I died, it would save you and Granger a lot of trouble, you know?"
"But the boy has been living with Death Eaters for two years! He could have useful information, we have to question him!" Robards exclaimed and if Harry didn’t have full arms of Draco Malfoy, he would probably cast crucio on that idiot.
She expects me to take one match and change it but somehow I’m in a mood to show off a bit, particularly because I catch Gryffindors Ron Weasley and Dean Thomas smirking at me. They think McGonagall might throw me out of the class. How mistaken they are, McGonagall is going to love me.
"You think you blamed me for killing myself." Draco guessed.
"What did you say?" Harry asked, not sure whether he heard well.
Hello dears,
"You added a garden? How?" Harry was amazed. "Nevermind, come here. I had no idea you could do magic like that."
Luna was smiling dreamily and nodding while Hermione blushed profusely and avoided his eyes but replied that she was ready. They spread evenly around the pyre and it was Harry who casted incendio. The wood immediately caught on fire as the conjured up flames lapped hungrily at it. Harry saw Draco growing stiff as he became surrounded by fire and his breathing was getting ragged but there was nothing he could do. He nodded at Hermione to start the incantation and she did, while him and Luna repeated after her.
"Certain." The blond whispered.
"Yeah, I’m okay now." Draco replied.
He was just on time to step in front of Draco and shield him from killing curse thrown at him by none other than Lucius Malfoy. As soon as older Malfoy saw him he changed into familiar black smoke and disappeared. Harry quickly scanned the surroundings for any other death eaters but they were alone.
"Good, you are doing so good Draco. Now I will use incarcerous, don’t get scared, alright?"
Harry kept one hand steadily moving on Draco’s shaft while the other one gently pushed his tights further apart. He reached down, playing with Draco’s balls for a while and then past them, circling the tight opening there with one finger then pushing at it but not quite entering.
They considered Harry acting as Draco’s defence but quickly decided Hermione would be better. Not only she knew more about the wizarding laws but she was also muggle born, which would again make the accusation of Draco being a Death Eater less believable. Harry could be always summoned as a witness if needed.
"Just what in Merlin’s name are you guys laughing about?" Harry asked as he re-entered the room.
"Are you sure you are strong enough to do the spell Draco?" Harry asked worried but Draco looked determined. His back was straight and there was glint in his silver eyes.
"Alright then, Harry. Owl us your address, okay? Have a good rest of the holiday and if your relatives change their mind about letting you visit, just send an owl," father tells him in a friendly manner and then we tell each other our goodbyes.
"I will talk to him. Hermione, can you prepare the potion and the ritual?"
"There is something wrong about the professor teaching Defense." I say, not sure how I could explain I know he has a parasitic evil wizard hiding under his turban.
"Yes, Harry. " Draco agreed eagerly. "You know, I’m not made of porcelain. Get comfortable, I will take my time," he said, pretending to be confident but blushing adorably.
"In a coffee shop, he works as a barista to make some extra money after school. And technically, we did poison him, that is some strong sleeping draught he drank. But it will eventually wear off." Hermione shrugged her shoulders. "Do you want some? It probably won’t be pleasant."
Draco knew what was coming, by now, all of the calming draught he had before lost it’s effects. He was sobbing loudly, his hands pressing on his mouth only doing so much to muffle his voice. He was trying to disappear into the chair, shrink himself to nothing.
"My mother grew up here... this house, it’s breathing dark magic."
"What can I say, Slytherin through and through." I smile.
Harry looked away from Draco onto the intruders and frowned a bit. It was Ginny and Hermione, the former looking beside herself with anger. This wasn’t good.
"You killed yourself." Harry whispered, holding Draco’s hands tighter. "You weren’t even twenty yet and you decided to take your life with a dagger." Harry’s voice hitched.
"On the shelf you can see our House Cups, we have a six-year streak winning, even though Dumbledore clearly favours Gryffindor. We do not tolerate slacking, everybody works to bring in as many points as they can. Learn the rules so you can break and bend them and not be caught. If you need help with anything, ask. We take care of our own. If you don’t have any questions, go to your rooms and sleep. You have a big day ahead of yourselves with lessons starting tomorrow. We are your second family now, make us proud."
"I wouldn’t know, I was never with anybody else." Draco whispered and felt Harry stiffen under him.
Draco felt Harry tensing and then liquid heat was spilling down his throat, Draco closed his eyes as he swallowed everything. He continued to suck gently until all the aftershocks of Harry’s orgasm subsided. Then Draco pulled of and his eyes fluttered anxiously over Harry’s face. "Did I do okay? Did you like it?" he bit his lip, fear and hope tangling inside him.
He looked like he wanted to say something more but whatever was in the cup started working and his head dropped to the table with a thud.
"What are master Draco’s wishes?"
"What do you mean you’ve had worse?" Harry asked with a piercing stare and Draco looked away.
"I do, Harry." Draco whispered weakly. "I just can’t do this. I’m… scared." his voice broke.
Harry looks at me all nervous,  I smile at him and nod in what I think is encouraging manner. He looks back at the wands and puts hand above them, just as I did before. He closes his eyes and lets his hand hover above them for about one minute and then one of the wands jumps into his hand. He smiles and gives it a swish.
"Then let me heal them for me. I will be calmer that way, less angry with Ron, I don't want to fight with him today."
"I’m sure Fred wouldn’t mind if you went to pay your respects on a different day. I can explain it to the other Weasleys."
"Now, that really is extraordinary Mr. Potter! So boys, would you be interested in joining the team?"
"Atonement… partially. I've done terrible things... You have no idea." Harry said and there was this terrible sadness in his voice. "Also, I owed it to your mother, she protected me when the only thing I offered her was an information whether you were alive. Then there is the bathroom incident when I accidentally almost killed you with sectum sempra." Harry said and Draco shuddered. "But that’s not all. I regret not taking your hand when you offered me friendship. I always had friends and especially Hermione covering my back, without her, I wouldn’t have made it so far. I wonder how much different it would have been if we were friends. I know that you had your Slytherins but somehow, you always looked a bit lonely. I might be wrong but they seemed more like your followers then your friends."
"We will start soon. It will be scary but I will be close the whole time. You don’t have to worry about anything, do you understand?" Harry said and kissed his neck.
Hermione took a deep breath before replying. "Attempted murder of Albus Dumbledore, murder of Narcissa Malfoy and being Death Eater, therefore torturing and killing muggleborns, muggles and serving Voldemort."
"Let’s get you to eat something, I have chicken broth, meatballs with mashed potatoes and canelés for dessert."
"I did see a few healers, mother brought me to them secretly. But you see, this is not really common condition. People usually don’t get long time exposure, they either go crazy like Longbottoms, so whoever tortures them gives up or becomes bored. Or they simply die."
"It was a good life in time of peace and prosperity. You seemed so happy and I thought we would be friends forever, I thought we knew everything about each other but I was wrong." Harry said and paused. He was determined to tell Draco but still, it was hard, remembering those events.
Draco knew there was somebody talking to him but he couldn’t quite make the words that person was saying. He looked up but his vision was blurry, he was feeling light-headed and he couldn't see through the tears. Where was he?
"I still want you inside me Harry…" Draco mumbled sleepily but his eyes were already closed.
"I think if we follow Snape’s instructions we can help him a lot. He will feel better when his magic recovers and when he isn’t sick anymore."
But Harry just laughed and let go of blushing Draco, that was once again hypnotizing his plate of pancakes. "Just sit down Hermione and tell us what you found out. Snape finished it?"
"Yes, oh yes." Kreacher smiled at Draco and Harry thought that for the first time the old elf didn't look mad, evil or majorly pissed off. "The Slytherin prince, true heir to The Most Noble and Ancient Houses of Black and Malfoy." the elf said happily and did a small courtsy.
When Harry apparated to Draco’s bedroom in Grimmauld’s place it was already late night. Because of the loud noise, Draco dropped the book he was reading.
"I think this compartment is getting rather stuffy, I would kindly like to ask you to leave Ron Weasley." I say, my voice is ice and I pierce him with my eyes.
"What happened Harry?" Draco asked.
Harry was holding the shaking blond, drawing caressing circles on the smaller of his back. But the forest was no longer quiet, he could hear somebody approaching. It could be friends but it could be as well enemies and Harry wasn't going to stay around to find out.
this time, we have chapter fully from Draco's POV, we will get a first glimpse into his thoughts and  what he was doing this summer. Hope you will enjoy it.
"You fucking death eater, you will explain to me what have you done to Harry and why are you snooping around!" Ron shouted as he kicked the blond boy curled up on the floor. Draco’s face was wet from tears and twisted in pain, his arms and legs bound by magical ropes.
Hermione entered the kitchen with a brown-haired guy trailing behind her, finding Harry with Draco perched on his lap, feeding him apple pie. It wasn’t unusual to find them close like this, most of the time Draco was clinging to Harry, craving the closeness and Harry happily obliged him. At first, she was embarrassed at the sight of Harry holding and petting the blond but she quickly got used to it. Their relationship was very sweet.
My parents are walking down the street and I wave them over.
"You were punished more then enough for that tree incident. Moody, I mean Barty was horrible to you."
The witch shook her head and stood up to leave the room. "I will leave you to it then. "
Powerful surge of dark green sparkles come out of the wand’s tip and Ollivander’s eyebrows rose even higher than I thought possible.
"That’s it, Draco. You are doing so good."
"Okay Hermione, I will take Draco to bed and I will be back down after."
"I’m naked and I’m cold." Draco complained dragging the blanket up all the was to his nose while still shivering strongly.
"Good. Then I will go to my room now and let you sleep. Good night, Draco." Harry said as he untangled himself form the blond boy and sat up.
Hogwarts has meanwhile become a headquarters for the order. The school year wouldn’t normally be over yet but this year, McGonagall decided to finish it early and send students back to their families. She also became the headmistress as the position was empty after Snape’s death and other teachers unanimously voted for her.
"First years should note that the forest on the grounds is forbidden to all pupils. And a few of our older students would do well to remember that as well. I have also been asked by Mr. Filch, the caretaker, to remind you all that no magic should be used between classes in the corridors. Quidditch trials will be held in the second week of the term. Anyone interested in playing for their house teams should contact Madam Hooch. And finally, I must tell you that this year, the third-floor corridor on the right-hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a very painful death."
Hermione sighed but smiled. She felt like huge weight fell of her shoulders, she had crush on Ron ever since she first saw him in the Hogwarts express but maybe that is all it was. A childhood crush, something that was not meant to be.
"Oh, Draco…" Harry gasped, surprised how pleasurable the touch was.
"Yeah, exactly. The design will be kinda similar to this one, only more decorative." Harry explained, gently pulled up Draco’s sleeve revealing the Dark Mark and Draco looked away.
"Yet it was me making you upset. Let me repair the windows. Kreacher!"
She frowns. "Surely you don’t want to become friends with that imbecile Ron?"
"Good night, my little prince." Harry whispered back.
"Is something the matter? You don’t like pancakes?" Harry asked, frowning.
"And you Kreacher, I want you to clean up a bit and make meals for Draco. If you slip any poison into his food or harm him in any way, I will set the portrait of Walburga on fire and then deal with you. You also aren't allowed to tell anybody he is here." Harry said sternly.
When Quirell enters the classroom and starts his lecture, Harry looks quite sick. I discreetly cast a dome shield around him but Hermione notices it anyway.
"My lack of self-control is not your fault, Draco." Harry said and frowned.
"Alright, accio Draco’s wand." Harry said and the wand came flying straight into his hand. He handed it over to the blond.
"I want you to see them, Harry." Draco insisted.
"I have to ask you for a proof," the Head Warlock said sadly. One look at the blond sobbing boy and the way he held himself and she knew Miss Granger wasn't making this up.
"Maybe we could come pick you up when it’s time to get on the Hogwarts train? Your muggle relatives wouldn’t be able to get to the platform anyway, only magical folk are allowed there," father suggests.
I have to warn you, there is another violent non-consensual sex scene in the third memory. The memories are in italics (I learned a new word, thank you Gimmichi). Skip it if you need to.
"What did I say, Potter?" Draco snapped but his eyes looked worried and vulnerable. He reminded Harry of a small scared kitten, trying to look scary when it was itself feeling scared.
"Thank Merlin it worked!" Hermione said and collapsed onto chair with relief. "We really needed to have it done now. We don’t have much time."
"It’s really not your fault Draco. You couldn’t help it. It’s common reaction in kidnappings." Harry said.
"Then let me explain the nature of Draco’s service to Voldemort," she said, looking the Head Warlock Marchbanks straight into eyes. "Draco didn’t really serve Voldemort, he was used by him. Voldemort took liking to Draco and because of that, abused and tortured him terribly, using him to satisfy his sexual needs. Draco Malfoy wasn’t perpetrator of torture, he was a victim," she said and there were many gasps across the courtroom.
Draco wondered if Harry would be like this if he knew everything. If he would be so kind to him if he knew Draco was a dirty whore.
"Absolutely." Draco whispered.
Draco was clinging to Harry and his legs were shaky. Even leaning on him, Draco was unable to walk so Harry picked his little prince up and carried him home.
Draco was dressed in a dark grey muggle suite and white shirt, magically altered to fit him. They thought it would be better to wear muggle clothing to appeal to the judges and dismiss the idea that Draco considered muggles and their culture worthless as many Death Eaters did.
"It’s hurting him to be here." Hermione states, looking at Harry, concerned.
"He wasn't always an asshole. He has some good points."  Harry said and shrugged.
"No, you are in no state to decide that. I’m not taking advantage of you like that." Harry said firmly, his voice tight and husky.
"How much do you know about how exactly cruciatus works?" Draco asked.
"Make it two coffees please, Kreacher," Harry said to the old elf who murmured something about filthy half bloods but moved on to make those coffees. Harry focused on the blond, who frowned a bit hearing the elf's quiet insults.
Just a warning, this is the chapter with the non consensual intercourse, it's in the italics, if you wish to, skip that part.
"Yeah, I have no reason to lie. It was strange experience. But I’m glad I came back, there are so many things I still want and need to do here."
What was Harry’s sex life like? Draco wondered what kind of woman or man would Harry pick for himself. He must get many offers, not only being the the Chosen One, but also being so handsome.
So he carefully peeled of Draco’s pyjamas, revealing his white underwear, long legs and two skinned knees. He smiled, if skinned knees are Draco’s biggest problem then life is good. He healed them in second.
Harry just looked after him and sighed.
"I will stay with you until you fall asleep. And even after, I will be in the house, checking on you. And when you wake up you will feel better." Harry explained as he drew Draco even closer, breathing in his smell.
"Please don’t go, don’t leave me Harry," he whispered against his neck and the needy tone Draco used went directly to Harry’s crotch. Draco was placing open mouth kisses down his neck and Harry stifled a moan.
"I will get you some muggle fever reducers, Hermione said no more potions," Harry said and was going to stand up but Draco held onto him, trying to snuggle closer again.
"Madame Head Warlock, we have heard some of Draco Malfoy’s answers but he wasn’t given space to explain himself and now he isn’t in any state to do so. I suggest we view the memories I collected as evidence and proceed after."
Some of these fantasies were absolutely innocent, like having a picnic on the edge of the Black Lake that ended up with a Harry kissing Draco or going on a date in Hogsmade, holding hands. Harry filtered through these quickly with a smile, getting to the ones that were no longer so innocent. There was a lot of fucking, it was like if Draco imagined them fucking everywhere in the Hogwarts castle. Abandoned classrooms – check, used classrooms – check, dungeons – check, astronomy tower- check, on the teacher’s table in the Great Hall in the middle of the night - check… In these fantasies Draco always bottomed and Harry had him in every position imaginable. But it wasn’t just that, Harry – in Draco’s fantasies, was rather kinky and dominant, he enjoyed playing with Draco, making him beg, spanking him, tying him up, fisting him… It was so hot. Harry closed his eyes, he couldn’t take anymore.
"Yeah, Draco’s friend died there, Circe, we all almost died there. He is scared of fire, wouldn’t even go close to the fireplace when he was freezing." Harry sighed.
When they apparated back to the Grimmauld’s place, it was already evening. They could hear shouting from the sitting room. They quickly hurried there.
"So you will send me away into nuthouse." Draco frowned.
Second chapter is here my dear readers, hope you will enjoy it! I will be very thankful for any comments (I'm very interested in your opinions) or kudos.
Harry took hold of Draco’s chin, whispered the incantation legilimens, and then Harry’s mind was swimming through hundreds of memories, no … not memories, they were too blurry for that, these were fantasies.
"I did but-" Draco started to reply but was stopped by Robards.
"I care for you little prince. Be good and rest a bit. I’ll be back soon." Harry said and both him and Hermione left.
But Hermione disagrees with me. "But he is genius, it says so in all of the books!"
"I can feel the wards strengthening, nobody can follow us here. We are safe Draco, nobody will hurt you here," Harry was comforting and hugging him.
Part of Harry’s mind was screaming to be careful not to push Draco too far but as the blond’s body melted into his and his hands clutched onto his shirt, Harry knew he didn’t have to worry.
And I am finally making my father proud.
The 9 and three quarters platform is packed with Hogwarts students and their parents. Soon I spot the familiar bushy hair of little Hermione Granger and I can’t wait to talk to her. We say goodbye to my parents and my mother hugs both me and Harry. He is surprised by that but returns the hug.
I was really absorbed in writing this chapter, if you feel like, let me know what you think, I will be glad for any feedback. I think Draco deserves a break and maybe even vacation in Italy.
"Fuck, I didn’t expect the trials to start so quickly, what are the accusations?" Harry asked, frowning.
It was strange, to be at Potter’s house… no Harry’s house. It was by no means stylish bright town house, not at all, as soon as they apparated here, he could feel the old magic of the Grimmauld’s place. It was undoubtedly quite dark and powerful, but somehow not harmful and even somehow noble. Compared to the stiffening poisonous atmosphere of the Malfoy manor, this was like a holiday retreat.
"Is he alright?" she asked, concerned.
"Yeah, I prefer hands on approach these days. Especially with healing, it’s easier this way." Harry said as he moved his hand all across Draco’s chest.
"You have no idea how much self-control it takes not to fuck you into the mattress right now." Harry growled and brushed his fingers down the ridges of Draco’s spine all the way to his perfect ass, cupping and stroking it.
"Mine." Harry whispered softly and cupped Draco’s face to kiss him again. "Gods, you are so perfect for me, every single thing about you is beautiful, and you want to be mine." Harry kissed him, deep and possessive and Draco moaned. "And you thought I wouldn’t want you when there is nothing in the whole universe I want as much as you."
"What is it?" Draco asked, curious.
"I’ll stay with you no matter what. I don’t want to force you to show me your memories."
"I find you so attractive. I thought you knew how beautiful you are. You always seemed to know when you were striding through the Hogwarts corridors with your chin held high."
"I’m alright, elf. No need to wake Harry up, I just slipped a bit. I must have been still half asleep, will you make me a coffee?" Draco asked.
I, of course, already learned this so I quickly turn my match into needle and open a book of advanced transfiguration under the desk, not to provoke McGonagall too much. I thought she would be too occupied by helping other students who seem to be struggling  quite a lot. But unfortunately she isn’t.
"You know Harry, the fire will not burn him, there are spells for that." Hermione started to explain but then stopped when she realized what Harry meant. "It’s about the fiendfyre, isn’t it?"
"Defence would be normally quite useful subject but like this, we won’t learn anything. If you want, the three of us, you, me and Hermione, can try learning by ourselves." I say and he nods.
Draco cried out, the pain lashing from his arm through his body, leaving him shaking and gasping. Harry’s left arm around him tightened so he wouldn’t writhe around too much.
"But he didn’t do anything, did he?"
." I whisper and see him blink a few times.
"The Battle - it was utter chaos, hexes and curses flying everywhere. In the middle of it, we ended up facing each other. We were firing spell after spell at each other and I decided to try to disarm you with expelliarmus. But you used a very strong shield spell. The second our spells collided, the impact send us both flying in opposite directions. I fell on some people and that softened the impact but there was a wall behind you and you collided with it. Despite the loud noise of everybody fighting I swear I heard your skull crack. I apparated next to you in a second, you were bleeding and I immediately started with the healing spells but the wound was too severe and I couldn’t save you." Harry said and fell quiet.
When Harry disappeared, Draco thought maybe he could get over it. Or maybe he will just end up dead before ever seeing Harry again. But Harry, who came back after the year they were separated was too much.
"Circe, Draco, if you slipped under the water you could have drowned. What if I didn’t come to check up on you?"
"You should have let him kill me, " Draco whispered. "Why did you save me anyway? Why did you save me back then in the Room of hidden things? Why couldn't you just let my father finish me off?" he demanded, angry.
"Yes, but the tables have turned. Now you are my adorable little prince." Harry laughed and tightened his hold around Draco’s waist.
"Yes, besides other things."
When then lesson finally ends, we get out of there as quickly as possible, dragging dizzy Harry between us. We try to avoid crowded corridors and mostly succeed.
"What are we doing here, Potter?" Draco asked, suspicious.
"I asked, how much did you give him?" Hermione asked again, anger obvious in her voice.
Draco just let it happen, too tired from seeing those memories again to try resisting.
Draco nodded but wasn’t sure. He let his cheek rest against the hard muscle of Harry’s chest.
"Can anybody back this up, Miss Granger?" asked the Head Warlock.
"I’m not the one that had their heart broken by Harry Potter." Draco chuckled. "At least not yet. " he added much more quietly.
"How come?" Draco asked surprised.
"Of course I want to. Close your eyes, Draco." Harry whispered and Draco obeyed. He could already feel Harry’s breath against him and soon their lips met.
"It was about the issue that later became known as Statute of Secrecy in 1689. The battle broke out during the council where the Statutes were being talked over, the opposing sides only meant to discuss the issue but as more supporters of each side arrived, the atmosphere became more tense and fight broke out. Most of British wizarding community at the time was on the site and the conflict quickly escalated. You were firmly against the Statutes, demanding that the muggles should be educated about wizards and respect them. You and your family were maintaining ties with quite a few influential muggles at the time. I was supporting the Statutes because innocents were getting hurt and dying in the witch trials and I didn’t think muggles could be taught anything." Harry explained.
"Yes. He called it discipline. Said he will yet make a proper Malfoy out of me." Draco said and dared to glance at Harry, who was clenching his fists, his knuckles getting white.
"Draco," Harry said and placed one hand on the blond’s shoulder. "There is nothing dirty or disgusting about you."
"Just how much veritaserum did you give him, auror Robards?" Hermione barked at the auror.
"Silencio! Stupefy!" casted Harry wandless. "I said that’s enough, Ron." Harry sighed and looked at crying Hermione. The witch was shaking and hugging her thin frame, Harry wished he shut up Ron faster, so she didn’t have to hear all this nonsense. Harry hugged her while she sobbed.
Harry was watching Draco in fascination. The spell was intricate and long and Harry could feel power being drawn towards Draco and into the circle. There was low buzzing in the air and Draco’s hair was starting to float.
"I’m so sorry Harry, I don’t know why that me in the past did what he did, I didn’t know I had a past life like that." Draco tried to explain.
"What do you mean?" Hermione asked worried.
"I’m not hungry." Draco mumbled and snuggled close to Harry. He still felt exhausted, headachy. He buried his face into Harry’s neck and breathed in his scent again. He smelled so good, yes, that was what he wanted, not food. Before he could stop himself, he licked Harry’s neck.
(See the end of the chapter for
When Hagrid finally appears, he brings along beautiful snowy owl as Harry’s Birthday present and Harry can’t stop thanking him. I have nothing against Hagrid anymore but he is surprised to see me and slightly wary of me. Harry doesn’t notice that and soon all three of us fall into friendly chatter while we shop for cauldrons, books and potions supplies. I feel so light, it is fun being eleven again, sharing Harry’s excitement for going to new school and starting to learn about magic. Plus the world is not on a bring of apocalypse anymore, which is a pleasant bonus.
Me in an eleven years old body changing the future of wizardkind. Attending Hogwarts again, yay.
Hello my dears,
Hello dears!
"It will be all okay Draco. Just don’t blame yourself. I can see it's bothering you, I will find out a way to erase the mark. I promise."
"Draco, I would never hurt you like that. I’m not going to take advantage of you, that is not what this is about, do you understand?" Harry asked.
"I want to know what it feels like. Besides does it get anymore special then kissing your soulmate? Or… maybe you don’t want to? It would make sense if you didn’t want to kiss someone like me…" Draco said quietly and averted his eyes. He was going to stand up and move away but Harry didn’t let him. Draco could feel one of Harry’s hands holding his waist firmly while the other one moved onto the nape of neck, slowly guiding him closer.
"We have all the time in the world for that. Rest know my little prince." Harry whispered and placed a kiss on the blond’s forehead.
So another chapter is here. Harry and Draco are getting a little bit closer and talking a lot. I hope you will like it.
"It’s okay, Draco, I just need to see the bruises. I won’t do anything to hurt you." Harry whispered as he caressed Draco’s hair with his other hand. "I just want to heal the bruises, you don’t have to be scared little prince."
I laugh. "Yeah, the squid is pretty cool. There are other interesting things in there as well, we might see them if we’re lucky."
"No, originally it would but I mixed it with strong dreamless sleep, he will be out of it for two or three days." Hermione smiled.
"How could you be hiding fucking Malfoy in your house and not tell me? I thought we were friends, Harry!" said Ron annoyed.
Harry didn’t tell Draco about how in his last moments the blond smiled at him and told him that it’s okay and not to cry.  And that he didn’t even realize he was crying until he heard him say that. Neither did he tell him that he kept apologizing after the life slipped away from the blond boy and stayed with his body till after the battle. Later he thought he just cried because of the shock of killing other person but now he knew that it was because it was Draco.
"Stop, Draco. That’s not true. He hurt you but you are still you. Still beautiful." Harry kissed his cheek. "Breathtakingly so." Another kiss, this time to his temple.
"I have just decided Robards, you really are going to stand trail for attempting the murder and harm of Draco Malfoy. And obviously any career plans at the ministry you had are highly improbable. Get lost," the old witch said.
"The sweetest little thing, I honestly don’t understand how did you manage to act like a such a prat at school." Harry chuckled.
My mother’s love for me was unconditional and uncomplicated. My father’s not so much. But right now, I could see pride in his eyes. Seeing the future was no ordinary skill and nothing one can learn.
"I’m okay, I just need the coffee and some rest, " he said and leaned back on the chair to get more comfortable but as he did that he gasped and flinched.
I appreciate any feedback, so if you liked it or if you didn't like it, please let me know.
There are a hundred and forty-two staircases at Hogwarts that keep moving, vanishing and appearing again. Without me, Hermione and Harry wouldn’t have made it to a single lesson on the first week without getting lost.
Draco seemed to slowly get more aware of himself and started shivering.
Draco lifted his face from Harry’s neck and looked at him, his eyes glazed, his skin pale but flushed along the cheekbones. "Please Harry… I want you inside me."
"It’s okay, you just aren’t letting your broom know clearly what you want, brooms react to our body language and instincts. You give it very confusing directions, it’s scared, it’s not even sure whether to keep you on or shake you off and bolt towards the Forbidden Forest." I explain and he stares at me, his eyes huge and his face all white.
Draco sighed and got into the bath. The water enveloping him, warming him up, cleaning him. For a moment he could forget he was a dirty little death eater, as Weasel said, and maybe be Draco, just Draco.
"That’s right, Draco. Shh, it’s okay, it’s over," Harry whispered comfortingly.
"I want to heal the bruises before I go, Draco."
"Is it expensive?" Harry asks, worried, and Ollivander is about to reply that yes, indeed it is, but sees me gesticulating behind Harry to be quiet.
"He’s overdosed. He needs water with crushed bezoar, quickly! His heart’s not good." Hermione pleaded and Head Warlock send the British Youth Representative – who was currently one of the Hufflepuff students, to retrieve it. The girl was back in a minute with a glass that she gave Hermione. Hemione put it to Draco’s lips and made him drink it. Draco’s breathing starting to slowly go back to normal.
"I saw him walking with his parents towards the Forbidden forest, " answered one of the younger students.
"Draco should feel the first results tomorrow morning but it will take several days for the full effect to take place. If it wasn’t summer solstice it would take even longer but the magic is strong today so I believe we have luck on our side." the witch said as she handed Harry the small vial with purple liquid in it.
"Fuck, Draco, enervate." Harry whispered as he gathered up the blond boy from the ice cold bath. Draco’s eyes slowly fluttered open but he seemed out of it. Harry’s clothes got all wet but he didn’t care. He sank on the bath mat with the blond boy on his lap and summoned another towel to dry him up.
"I won’t send you away, Draco." Harry said and caressed the blond’s hair. "I won’t make you do anything you don’t agree with but it could help you to talk with a mind healer."
"Are you okay, Draco?" Hermione asked, concerned.
"You asked if he is mad before, there is your answer. He is keeping something dangerous there – in the middle of school full of kids. What kind of headmaster does that?" I say and shake my head.
"Of course he noticed. You are a nice person Hermione. But he is not. The end justifies the means could be very much his motto. Yet he has all those medals and orders and never uses Dark Arts. Such a farce. He definitely didn’t hire Quirell for his teaching skills, the blabbering idiot won’t teach us anything useful. He must have other reasons to keep him close."
"You were so beautiful doing that spell little prince. Absolutely stunning." Harry whispered against his neck and it send shivers down Draco’s spine. Then Harry took Draco hand, looking at the cut on his palm and kissed it. Draco felt the familiar warmth of Harry’s healing spell flow into his hand and when Harry let go the cut was gone without a trace of ever being there.
"Not your fault Draco, you must have had a reason." Harry said and stroked the blond’s hair, letting his hand rest at the nape of Draco’s neck. "I just wish I knew, I wish we talked, I wish we did something."
"Attempted murder of Albus Dumbledore and he pleads not guilty." Hermione said confidently.
Harry shakes his head and Weasley sits down.
"Alright, but if anything makes you uncomfortable – you stop. Anything scares you – you stop. Understood?" Harry asked.
"You mean…" Draco hesitated to finish the sentence.
"Hermione, I’m hiding Draco at Grimmauld’s place but we can’t tell others about it, you understand, don’t you?"
"I know, my little prince, patience. I will warm you up in a second." Harry said as he started to unbutton his now completely soaked shirt.
"So what do you want to talk about?" Draco asked, his silver eyes meeting Harry’s emerald green ones.
"Well, we can try talking. But I’m going to help even if he doesn’t apologize. Whatever he called me, he didn’t deserve to be tortured by the unforgivable curse and what it caused to him."
"Mr. Malfoy, are you seriously slacking off in my class?"
"You just don’t know it. I can’t tell you, I just can’t… But, I could let you see my memories, then you would understand. Then you would know not to lose your time with me." Draco said weakly.
"No, it’s… I like it. I should also call you Harry now that we are officially friends, shouldn’t I?" Draco asked shyly. Harry thought seeing Draco Malfoy being shy was adorable.
"No need our slippery friend. You were right to approach us."
Draco spent the day reading. He tried going down to the kitchen offering Granger to help with organizing the research but she told him she already had system in sorting it and he should rest.
"Surely you see what state the house is in. I want to fix it." Draco said and the elf’s eyes widened in understanding. Slytherin prince was going to repair the Most Noble House of Black! Kreacher’s eyes filled with happy tears.
"Ron, there was no time to tell you." Harry sighed. It was quite typical for Ron to focus only about how things affect him. Harry liked Ron, but sometimes it annoyed him how selfish he could be.
"For the traces of whoever cursed Draco to be removed he needs to go through purification ritual. Snape thought the best chances would be with fire."
The blond was in a bath, sleeping with his head leaning back on the edge of the bath. Harry breathed a sigh of relief.
"Wake up Draco," Harry said softly as he moved one strand of hair away from Draco’s face.  The blond boy’s eyelashes fluttered in the morning sun and he slowly opened his silver eyes, then fixed them on Harry.
"How?"
The trial was held in the courtroom number ten in front of the whole Wizengamot. Currently the Head Warlock’s function was held by Griselda Marchbanks, who resigned when Cornelius Fudge usurped the control of Hogwarts but joined again after the ministry has been cleared from Voldemort’s pawns. She was believed to be fair in her judgement.
"Head hurts, I… can’t breath," he whispered, clutching his head in his hands and curling up.
"Harry! Snape actually finished the research!" she exclaimed and then took in the scene in front of her, seeing Harry holding Draco’s chin and feeding him pancakes. "Oh, am I interrupting something? Should… should I come later?" she asked.
He pointed the wand at Draco’s Dark Mark and whispered morsmordre, claiming the the mark as his own in order to have power over it.
"You are right, Hermione. Healing Draco is our priority." Harry said and run his hands down Draco’s back in caress. "When do we do it? Also we still need one more person…"
"I don’t need to tell you this needs to stay secret, do I?" I raise my eyebrow.
"I agree, Miss Granger. Yet the last accusation against Mr. Malfoy still stands and we have just seen more proof of it. Lucius Malfoy mentioned his son serving the Dark Lord and defendant himself admitted it under veritaserum," the Head Warlock stated, frowning. She looked at the boy, shaking and crying in his seat, wondering what in the Merlin’s name he had to do, hoping she will not have to send him to the Azkaban.
"I need to make some Weasley friends."
"Thank you, Mr. Malfoy. I would very much appreciate that."
"You are drunk! And you apparated! Do you want to get splinched?" Draco started scolding him. He got out of the bed and was checking Harry for any sign of splinching.
"We need to go home." Harry said, this time speaking to Hermione. He was angry at the witch even though he knew she had no choice. She picked up best possible memory to clean Draco’s name and leave no doubt Draco was a victim. In the memory, Draco wasn’t aroused at all, most of the time his forearm wasn’t visible, he was wandless and weak, unable of any resistance. Used, hurt, raped, humiliated. Perfect victim. Ten points to Gryffindor Hermione for picking it up, Harry thought bitterly.
"We aren’t even friends, Potter. It’s one thing that you don’t hate me anymore but being this kind to me just doesn’t make any sense. Why are you doing this?"
So she and Draco were left alone and she moved to sit next to him on the bed.
Draco was kneeling on the ground and softly crying. His hands were clutching and pulling at his dishevelled hair. "Father...father found out mother lied to the Dark Lord. I... couldn't do anything. He killed her... she is gone. Mother is gone." Draco whispered.
"You slept through the lunch break and next lesson is flying, I’m positive you’re going to love it. But if you don’t want to go, I can tell Madame Hooch you are not feeling well."
Draco thought it was really nice talking with her. Somehow his worries were pushed aside for a while and he could laugh and joke about things. It would be nice if he and Hermione would really become friends, he thought.
"Me too. I read about both of you and Harry in Modern Magical History and The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts and Great Wizarding Events of the Twentieth Century. Potters and Malfoys are some of the most influential and famous wizarding families." Hermione says awed.
"Do you mind it?"
"It will be quite large, covering your whole forearm and usually it would be done in more then one session but Harry really needs to practise, so I’ve made this tea." Hermione said and gave Michael what looked like a cup of tea. "There are anti-inflammatory agents and strong pain killers in it, it might make you a bit sleepy but it’s absolutely harmless."
"And what exactly is this? Harry, how could you?! We… I thought we were together." Ginny shouted.
And soon Hermione, this brilliant young witch would be dead too – I can see the last curse that hit her eating her up, unless I manage to change the past and therefore change the future as well. Great.
As soon as he stepped into the ruins of the castle, Hermione rushed to him. "Harry, where have you been? We’ve been worried! We heard you went after Malfoy!"
"Sure, sorry I forgot,"  Harry apologized. "I wanted to talk to you a bit more anyway."
"It hasn’t been even ten days since I’ve been with him and I’m already spreading my legs for you when you didn’t even ask me to, acting like a bitch in heat. He was right, I’m a whore."
Draco thought that after the Dark Lord, if he ever managed to get away, he will never be able to have sex again but here he was, quietly burning with need, his breathing heavy, imagining Harry's strong hands taking his clothes off, holding him down, exploring his body with his tongue. Dear Merlin, he was too far gone.
"No scars at all, your skin is so perfect." Harry said reverently and let his fingers trace across Draco’s collarbones.
"You are strange Draco Malfoy, it seems like you are always scheming and considering all possible scenarios. Always looking out for me and Harry."
"I even get free drugs," Michael said, emptying the cup quickly. "You guys are really something, living alone in a such a big house in the central London, making funny tea and doing tattoos. Do you wanna maybe hang out sometimes?"
"Draco, I’m so sorry, I didn’t know Ron would come by. Did he hurt you? Are you in pain?" Harry asked as he gathered the crying blond into hug. Draco was sobbing loudly and didn’t seem able to respond.
I move alongside him. "That’s right Neville, you are doing great. See? Now you are in perfect control of the broom!"
"Oh, Draco. We are glad that you understand the point of making alliances. Just during this last month, you’ve grown up so much. Lucius, you must see it too. All he did was studying, reading and practising occlumency."
"We’ve met before, Draco. You were always near. I don’t know much about reincarnation and souls, I’m not sure I even believed in anything like that before. Or maybe I just never thought about it that deeply I guess. But I think it’s very rare to be meeting someone in more then one life. The only other two souls I have met in one of the past lives are Hermione and Luna. But you were in every single one of my lives." Harry said and caught Draco’s hands in his. "You have no idea how special you are to me, Draco."
"So we were friends… before?" Draco asked, hoping that maybe, just maybe they were more then friends. This was all so strange to him but he was happy about this connection to Harry and the way Harry said he was special made his heart beat a little bit faster.
"You are going to the funeral. " Draco said.
"You are very lucky Mr. Potter, another person buying a wand for you is a sign of great loyalty. It would be rude to refuse."
"Yes, we are! Protecting the sensitive young Slytherins from nasty garlicky teachers!" George replies.
"Hey, it’s okay, you are alright." I say and caress his back.
Harry knew he needed to be careful, disciplined. He could too easily lose himself in his desire for Draco. The little Slytherin prince, even with his lips stretched around his cock, was an ethereal creature, whitest skin he has even seen, bruising way too easily, delicate lithe body. Everything about him was elegant, from his chiselled cheeks, that were now flushed delicious shade of pink, to the long toes on his feet.
"Harry, can you take off your glasses? Good, now come a bit closer."
"I understand."
"I’m sorry. " Draco whispered and stood up.
I sit next to him. "I wish I could do away with you relatives for how they treated you without the threat of legal repercussions, but we have to be smart about this. You are worried, whether you will do alright at school. You will. There are many other first years who haven’t done any spellwork before either. Also, I’m here to help you, okay? We can study together, you will do okay."
He was taller and so strong, his muscles obvious even under his muggle clothes. His face more manly with a slight shadow of facial hair and knowing depth in his eyes, that wasn’t there before.
Draco should be thanking all the gods that Harry got into talking distance with him, let alone having Harry as a friend and caring for him. Merlin, after everything, he was still somehow surprised Harry was giving him such a chance.
"You didn’t have your first kiss, yet." Harry said, surprised.
"It’s getting dark, we better get started." Harry said and pointed his wand at the wooden platform to transfigure it a bit. He whispered a transfiguration spell and a wooden pole appeared in the middle of the platform.
"Draco, that was brilliant!" Hermione exclaimed, full of excitement and the blond Slytherin blushed a bit.
"Are you awake? How do you feel?" Harry asked and nuzzled against his hair.
It felt so strange and warm and good and when Harry softly brushed over one of Draco’s nipples the blond boy couldn’t help but moan softly.
"Hermione, does he have to be conscious during the ritual?" Harry asked and Draco stiffened a bit in his arms.
"A little bit." Draco admitted. "I must confess I also added a garden. I hope you don’t mind."
"See you later, Harry." Hermione said but Harry was already gone.
"Yet here we are." Smiled Harry.
"Okay, I’ve been watching you a bit, you focus a lot on the incantation and the wand movement, both of which you do perfectly. But do you visualize it?"
"I never thought about it like that. I guess Slytherin could be nice." Hermione says and smiles at me.
"Remember, Draco, you can stop anytime. I wouldn’t mind." Harry said and kept his eyes fixed on the blond’s face.
"I just wanted to get clean." Draco whispered and then gasped when Harry’s palm moved over his forearm, sending again this strange warmth, healing him.
Draco was lying sprawled on the floor. Harry wasn’t surprised, the strong mix of potions didn’t make the blond the most coordinated being. He picked him up easily and carried him to the bed.
"If you would excuse me, I think, I need a moment, I will be upstairs." Draco said and left the room. He was dirty, his own magic was tainted. The Dark Lord really took everything – his freedom, his body, his magic. He was breathing hard as he hurried up the stairs, not caring about the pain jolting up his legs. He needed a bath, he needed to try to get clean, he still felt the Dark Lord’s fingers inside him, on his skin, in his mouth – everywhere.
"Yes, but you were scared and crying, I don’t know the details but Voldemort was blackmailing you, using you and there was nobody to help you. And me, all I wanted was to prove that you are a death eater and catch you. I could see you were struggling but I couldn’t look past my grudges and help you. No, instead I went around spying on you and ended up almost killing you."
He was never with a boy like Draco, so delicate and prettier than any girl. He run his hands through his hair and down his spine. Draco was still wearing only unbuttoned shirt, which was falling from his shoulders, but blanket was covering him from the waist down.
"It’s good to be able to joke once again but Draco, seriously, when you get back in there, you need to make us work ourselves to the bone and you have to focus on your talents too. This time around we will have to be stronger. Too much depends on it."
"He looks like a stuttering idiot but don’t underestimate him, he is dangerous. When you do it, make sure there aren’t any first or second years around, but don’t be alone, he could get aggressive." I frown.
I’m sorted into Slytherin and it pleases me this time as much as it did the last time. It’s not surprising at all, I’m much more fitting to be one now. But when both Harry and Hermione get sorted into Slytherin too I’m besides myself with joy. Weasley watches Harry sit down at our table with open mouth and I can’t help by smirk at him.
"It’s okay, I got you. We will warm you up in a second. Let’s get you to the fireplace, it will be nice and warm. " Harry wrapped him up in the towel and stood up, carrying him in his arms out of the bathroom.
"I figured that part about the drink out." Draco said as he switched to massaging Harry’s other feet.
Harry wanted to stop Draco going upstairs but he restrained himself. He needed to hear the rest of it from Hermione before talking with Draco. The blond was upset but so was Harry because how dare anybody do that to his Draco? His Draco, hmm. Harry was starting to consider Draco his. His to take care of, his to protect. He was interrupted from his thoughts by Hermione’s voice.
