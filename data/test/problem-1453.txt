The last memory he has of this Manor is of flooing in to find his mother sat in the living room. He remembers her bemused sort of joy upon the sight of him, putting her wine glass away as she stood from the sofa. He remembers being tired in a way that seemed deeper than a need for sleep, crossing the weary steps towards her as he fell, more than anything, into her arms.
"Actually," he said. "I'll sit over there." He nodded at Harry's side of the chair, which he was just about to take out.
Draco hummed, inquisitive. He appeared bemused. "Of course. Why wouldn't I be?" Harry eyed him, scrutinising, and he sighed. He mindlessly adjusted Harry's glasses on his face, sliding it straight, one-handed. "It's alright. I was only thinking how… strange it is, I suppose… that we won't be having anything like this. Isn't it strange?"
"Somebody has to." Harry smirked. He nudged his shoulder.  "If you could have anyone you want, Malfoy. Come on. Who would it be?"
It sounded very specific. Harry wasn't entirely sure of the exact shade of those colours, but for some reason he'd expected something much more
Through dinner, Harry was sitting beside Draco, holding his hand under the table. He could feel the cool metal of Draco's ring on his skin. Half-way through listening to Arthur's story about the accidental animation of a rubber goose that turned out horrifically aggressive, Harry found himself distracted by their hands, and the gleam of silver amidst the tangle. While Draco was still listening to the story, Harry pulled their hands up and gently kissed the ring.
She leans her head against the shoulder of his robes, her white-blond hair nestling against him, her arm curling around his bicep. The threads of magic dissipate, and in its place, she takes his hand in her own, warm and grounding.
Harry glances at Draco, whose face is unreadable. Harry lets him go, but not fully. "No, it's alright," he says. He smiles at Draco. "We'd like it if you stayed."
A minute later, the door opens, slowly, Draco standing there in the doorway, his face bemused. He looks impossibly young in his pyjamas, his eyes red-rimmed, his nose tinged pink.
So Harry gets off his bed as soundlessly as he can, gets out of his room. The coin in his hand speaks at the stretch of his silence, cracking, "
And Harry is looking at Draco, but Draco is adamantly not looking at him, is telling Neville that he has no interest in dithering around at the very last minute like the rest of them, and a part of Harry wants to say something, and another part of him just wants to grab him by the wrist or hand and pull him next to him — or on him, but that might just be his glass of elf-wine talking.
Ginny slams the door shut on her way out. Harry feels sick to his stomach, sick with himself all the time, and like he might just lose everything after all. He lost Draco because he was too afraid of just that, and now he might just lose everything anyway.
"No," Draco snaps, loud, a rush of fierce, protective anger like he hadn't felt in a while now, leaving him nearly breathless. "Merlin, no, Pans, what the fuck are you even—he wouldn't ever—"
"I think they did something to me," Draco said, quietly. "What I don't understand is why they didn't tell me."
Even at St. Mungos, Potter had only gotten annoyed and frustrated with his crude demeanor. He had scoffed and rolled his eyes and taunted him back if he'd ever lost patience, and when he'd used up the last meagre amounts of it, he had lashed out and left him in his hospital bed to stew alone.
"You're mad, you know that?" Harry told him, with a huff. Draco bounced his brows at him, smirking. Harry broke into another laugh, and then sank down onto that hot mouth again, closing into daylight between them.
What he had with Ginny was a lot more real, less about hormones and more genuine feelings when it had happened. But after the War, they just never got back together. It was just an unspoken sort of understanding and agreement, that there were a lot of things that could never go back to normal and they were one of those things. Neither of them were in the mindset to maintain a whole relationship after. She was dating Dean Thomas now.
onto the makeshift dance floor of the living room, but soon he was laughing, shaking his head, letting all their goofy spinning and dancing make him forget for a moment.
There's Potions, first, where Harry and Hermione sit together, noting down the instructions on how to brew a Laughing Potion. He sits two seats behind Malfoy on the row to his left, notices him stare ahead at an empty space at the front of the classroom until Slughorn comes and fills its place, and then never lifts his head up again, only listening and taking notes.
Draco remains transfixed above them. There's a huff, something that isn't quite disdain, something else entirely. "What do you want to know?"
Something in Harry gave at that, only half-aware of the sense that maybe he would have anyway, that he was only just waiting for a reason. He ignored ever having the thought, ever feeling terribly filthy, and pulled Malfoy in by the back of his knees, one after the other, Malfoy falling closer, pressing against him, gasping.
as his gaze roves over Harry's face, the kind of quietly strong and brave that Harry's come to realise he is much later. There's a memory, of him on the floor of a cellar and in a hospital bed and Harry doesn't know if he will ever wake up again, and it scared him then but it
They stayed for dinner, the awkwardness dissipated entirely by then. By the time dinner was over, the whole thing was only a faint weight in the very back of his mind. Hermione was telling him about her pet peeves when living with Ron, his dirty socks everywhere and how he slept in them, and how he forced her to watch his stupid reality shows with him on weekend mornings. Ron gave her a mock-scowl, but it broke into tenderness when she pushed her head against his shoulder playfully, laughing, kissing him.
Hermione laughed, the bridge of her nose wrinkling up with it, and Ron threw his NEWTs results at him and called him a tit, but it didn't reach Harry's face, instead floating down unimpressively to the floor. Hermione would have been annoyed by it, usually, but even she seemed to have enough alcohol in her system to be relaxed about mistreatment of results parchments. They all watched it go down, snorting into another small fit, warm and woozy from the wine.
Draco snorts. "I can't believe it took you this long. I've been waving my hand in your face all day." Even so, there is a hushed tone to the way he's speaking, and Harry can feel his eyes on him, observing his reaction.
When he startles awake that night with a cry half-buried in his throat, he isn't alone. Harry is there right in front of his eyes flying open. It takes a second to register it's him, with his face and the green of his droopy, half-mast eyes in the starlights, but it's his voice shushing him softly and his hands all in his hair, running featherlight over his face and shoulders and down his back, the bumps of his spine. His arm is pulling him closer when Draco finally does reach calm and steady breaths, and his face is very close to his own on the pillow. The pounding of his heart is settling down—just by the sight of his face, the warmth of his hands, his breaths steady against Draco's chin. He tries to stay awake to watch Harry's eyes slip shut, watch him return to slumber first, but is too tired and falls asleep quickly after.
Harry always tries to somehow end up next to him if there is ever free space, arms and shoulders pressed together subconsciously because of the tight squeeze. Throughout it all, Harry keeps finding himself glancing over at Draco, to see if he was amused by what Harry or somebody else said, to gauge his mood, to ask him something in a murmur between them, to point something funny out.
"But I can also see you're sincere, and you're serious about him," Blaise says. He shrugs, leaning back on the sofa, elbow on the arm. "Let's be honest, anybody else would have turned tail and ran in your place, not pined after him for years. And everything Draco's told me about you — besides, there was a lot of complicated shite going on before with you two. Maybe now that there's a lot less of that... Pans, she'll come around once she sees that too. She's just never really been able to move past that night when it comes to Draco. I didn't either, for a long time. Not saying that was your fault, but...there's this fear that she can't shake off, since she's learned about those dreams, and you being tied to it. You know?"
Malfoy's eyes grew tinged with remorse with the briefest moment, before quickly becoming controlled and impassive.
, but as of now, I believe the priority should be on saving lives rather than weeping over lost love lives."
Harry reached a hand out across the space between their beds, through the rails, pressed slightly over the pads of his half-curled fingers. He liked that Malfoy looked lovely sometimes, like he did in the shroud of day, and in bed, and somehow even now under white bulb lights, with his hair all in messy waves around his ears, a sleepy and confused frown on his face.
Harry's face bloomed into a broad grin at that. Then he grabbed Draco's wrist, still sat on the stool, and pulled him down on his lap, into a kiss.
Harry did finally manage to pull him down, get him flat on his back to the bed, grinning above him as he kissed him. Draco's breaths were still hitching on his laughter, and the camera was still in his hand, recording, forgotten into the kiss.
Draco tries to gauge his expression, his body language. He leans a bit closer, tilting his head to try and get a look at him. "What?"
And Harry began to breathe, thick and watery, eyes closed. He could feel himself steadying, his body relaxing against Draco's. He could feel Draco's eyes on him, in the silence that followed, thumb on the hollow of his cheek. The way it came to wipe over a wet streak.
Slytherin has forty points on Gryffindor as of now. The Golden Snitch hasn't yet been seen by either of the Seekers. In a time-out between the game, Potter pulls his broom to the right, swooping down and flying over towards Draco. He lowers down a little, coming to a floating still in front of him.
Narcissa was eying him, then smiled softly. "You're too good a man, Harry," she said, and it was genuine, before Draco had come and borrowed her for something. Harry let him have his time with her, moving away into a corner, accepting a drink from one of the servers. A little while after, somebody had come and asked for a dance from Narcissa, and a little while after that, Draco accepted a dance from a woman, black-haired and very conventionally beautiful. A name niggled at the back of Harry's mind, with that face, and he finally placed her as the younger Greengrass sister.
"Yeah," Harry said, when he trailed off. He said nothing else after. Draco didn't ask anything more either, and Harry was grateful. The next day, he firecalled his Mind-Healer again.
Harry swallowed hard, closed his eyes. It was like he was trying to take in too much, yet at the same time, nothing was reaching him at all. Everything was warped and twisted and he didn't know what they were meant to do anymore to stop this from happening, what they weren't. His head hurt, trying to sort through it all, until he was almost half asleep curled around Draco, mouth pressed to the top of his spine and the expanse of his back flush against Harry's chest, knees behind the curl of Draco's knees.
One day, Draco forgets to bring himself clothes into a shower at night, comes out to move quickly for his room—and runs right into Blaise.
He is fascinated, even, by the contrasting stiff and uptight man that finds him at home time. Draco wears his pressed dress shirts tucked into his slacks, his sleeves squared at his arms, and Harry is sometimes annoyingly overwhelmed by his attractiveness, how neat and fresh and handsome he always seems to be. Scorpius is toddling along next to him, backpack bouncing.
Harry tries to smile, say something. He ends up saying nothing much beyond that, swallowing as he looks down at the chessboard. A pawn.
"I had five back then," Draco said, as in an explanation, shrugging. He was flushing slightly. "I thought two had to have been somewhat common." He cleared his throat. "So there you have it, my secret. Now you tell me yours."
One evening, Draco came striding out of the floo and into the drawing room, heading straight towards the bar at a clipped pace. He was fuming, clearly, hands shaking as he poured himself a drink.
"I don't like that nasty stuff we have to take when I get a cold," Jenny comments, scrunching her nose up.
Harry looked up from the paper on the table, at him, blinking. His mouth opened, worked around words he didn't have.
And then he stops, trailing off. Potter was slowing to a stop in front of him, hands in his trouser pockets.
"Draco said my magic would go away," Harry said, not quite sure why he did. It seemed a strange thing to imagine, a distant idea that he couldn't entirely grasp, like most things now. He hadn't been able to entirely grasp the war happening, and this curse happening, and now he couldn't entirely grasp Draco dying, his magic going away. Like it was all too big for his mind to take in.
He felt it first, that afternoon, while he was in the kitchen fixing himself something to eat. Harry let his plate drop with a light clink and clutter, gripping the edge of the counter in an onslaught of frustration and despair. He breathed through that for a moment, and then turned around, jaw set tight, as he went over and jostled Malfoy's arm, one of their many non-verbal signals. He'd been reading at the kitchen table, thick-framed glasses low on his nose, but he didn't look irritated this time, just looked up at him in that forever bored way of his, politely feigning interest. He must not be feeling it yet.
at the first sign of trouble between them. He was angry enough to tell himself they clearly wouldn't have worked out anyway, then.
Then he turns under the tangle of Draco's legs, his fingers curled loose on the soft between Potter's, his head lifting at the cue. Potter slides the other arm across his shoulderblades, pulling him close and rolling them over a little. He presses him down into the pillows, kisses him deep and unhurried.
Harry represses a smile back down at the pot, almost shyly. There's still a part of him that's trying to wrap his head around this — that Draco is here, and last night. "Hello."
"Yeah, okay. Uh, Ron?" Hermione was gripping him by the biceps and trying to drag him away, but Ron was still stuck to his spot, struggling to process what was happening as he stared at Harry, a wrinkle in his forehead.
"I don't want you to go," but then Harry was choking out, before he could even think about it, when the tide of grief had come over him in such a blinding rush.
Draco huffed, smirking slightly. His head shifted against Harry's shoulder, his hair all a mess against it. "I know you. Wouldn't want you to spend the rest of your life thinking about… about poor old me."
"I hope they'll tell you about me," was what Harry heard Draco murmur once, just between him and Teddy, as he was coming into the room. "If nothing else, I hope they'll tell you that I loved you very much."
There, he stays with Pansy and Blaise, with plans to get a job and save up money and build himself a life of his own. The distance and time was there between them at first, but eventually they bridge the gap. Eventually, the three of them come to be as they used to be, teasing him, a chaos of banter that they always pull him into, and maybe Draco does manage to act enough like the person they seem to be looking for, as if his body has its own practiced will. It helps him, just a bit, to not think about all that he left behind, to keep himself here and awake.
Draco places his suitcase at his feet and steps forward into her hands, his throat burning. He lets his mother's palms cup his cheeks, her thumbs brushing over the apples of them and under his eyes, lets her kiss his face all over, lets her weep against the side of it soundlessly after. He holds her, buries his nose into the shoulder of his mother's dress and almost feels small again, almost like he's seven years old and not older than seven decades, when nothing had ever happened to them.
He certainly would not have held doors open for them. They could open their own doors for themselves, thank you very much.
does. "—care for somebody like me…I didn't really know what that — I didn't think I'd ever… I mean it'd always seemed to me like… like my parents were the only people who would have, until I came here. Until Ron and Hermione, and then all the Weasleys and..." Harry clears his throat, the ebb of loss arising in it for the names he left unsaid. "But it's just…"
Five minutes later found him opening the door of their bedroom, moving inside it. He needed to keep himself occupied by something else, before he drove himself mad turning over those three words, finding all the most ludicrous meanings in his disbelief, trying not to be too hopeful. But he kept thinking of the way Draco had angled their mouths together, the hover of a hot breath, and now Harry just wished he'd kissed him first instead.
There was a jolt up Harry's arm when Malfoy touched him back, a swift rush of energy flooding into his body, laced with a strange mixture of malaise and warmth. Harry jerked his hand out of his grip abruptly, like he'd been burned. Malfoy blinked, turning his own hand over in front of him, looking at the back of it.
They write to each other almost daily. Harry works. Draco works and studies. And at the end of the night, Draco's barn owl comes to him with a new letter, along with some drawings.
Draco hit his chest, but it was feeble, hardly hurting. He was hitting him again and standing rigid when Harry tried to pull him in. It wasn't too hard to draw him into his chest on the next tug, gripping him tight as he was falling, gasping out in a terrible voice, "Look what you did to me."
"You really took all these pictures, without me knowing," Draco said, blinking. "Some of these are quite unflattering, you know. You're not a very natural photographer."
Potter's kiss tastes like warm wine, feels like home, pulling at the violent bubbling in the deepest pit of his stomach, heated and tender beneath his skin, from his spine to his cheeks to his scalp. It is a raw and cavernous hunger all the way to his bones, held together tight, by stitches, in the tremors of his body. Some part of him is certain that to allow the absolute depth of his feelings to slip through is to terrify Potter almost as much it terrifies himself.
They go out for lunch, and it is all simple and easy at first, mostly small talk and little jokes, trying to find their footing and old comfort again. Harry asks Draco where he's been, and the story is that he's been staying with Pansy Parkinson and Blaise Zabini in Wales, had grown close over the years with them again. He worked for a bit while he lived with them, but it didn't work out. Pansy got a large inheritance from his maternal grandmother, and she used this to aid Draco financially with his Mind-Healing and then partial Obliviation procedure, and he plans to pay her back. There's a lot more to it, Harry is sure, but he lets that be enough for now.
. He'd only wanted to not be at the Great Hall. But he thinks saying this will make Draco less likely to believe him anyway.
Harry swallowed hard. Draco closed his eyes, leather-gloved fingers curled into the back of Harry's hair.
"Maybe. Yes. It's… it's the only thing that makes any sense, what little it does," Draco said. "But… if I am honest, I wouldn't have listened to you if I didn't have my own reasons as well."
He'd known it in all these months he had him in bed, transfixed by the rosy flush of his cheeks, and in the way he found himself outlining him in his mind, making a painting out of a moment that he stood in. In the mornings, the first sight of him, sitting cross-legged at the table in the shroud of daylight, at the counter making breakfast, softly asleep right in front of him on the other side of a pillow.
It was only when Draco's body relaxed, his hand loosening around the camera, that Harry broke the kiss and snatched it out of his hands, wrist twisted to hold it behind his back. He was still keeping himself on an arm over Draco, hand beside his head.
Harry finds the idea confusing and difficult to grapple with. It seems a distant thing, for the most part, and to test out the thought feels like a mere recited fact that he understands nothing of, like rehearsed words detached from his comprehension. And the memory, returning in sporadic moments, but still too surreal and dreamy most of the time, impenetrable to the film of uneasy skepticism over his mind.
At that, Draco makes the mistake of looking up at him, finally, and is stuck on brilliant green eyes, on the ebony of his curls falling against the hinge of his battered glasses, on the golden-brown of his skin alight in the day.
And then the stage lit up, bright sparks and glows of light all over as coloured smoke permeated the air. The band went wild, jumping all over with their instruments and banging their heads and bodies to the music, as the guitar and drums start up, a hard and fast rhythm and riff raffs that have the entire crowd cheering loudly, others behind Malfoy jumping and dancing. Malfoy cupped his hands around his grin and whooped with such passion and joy that he had to bend slightly at the abdomen, knees crouching down by the force of it. The golden sunlight glittered down on him, caught in the silver of his crinkling eyes and platinum hair, making him all golden too.
Draco puts his hand on her forehead to check her temperature. Narcissa shakes her head, taking his hand and kissing the back of it, pressing it against her cheek.
Draco's cheeks tighten into a smile, just as terribly mad himself, over him. He kisses him again, kisses him long and deep and slow like he's making up for all the years worth of losses, skin heated, tender all over from his spine to his scalp.
"I know." Narcissa brushes her hand over the side of his hair, pulling it back. "But I hate seeing you here as well."
Malfoy's face was right there in front of him, half-hidden behind the pillow, asleep. Harry closed his eyes, trying to sleep too.
Muddled up emotions and despair, that had laid dormant in his chest, began to swell up into the forefront, overwhelming, running through him. He thought of five years, the burden of a life on his shoulders, dependent on the choices he made
Harry's hand itched to reach for his wand, staring at the man in front of him, but Malfoy's face had twitched into a frown, and he was looking back at his hand again. He appeared just as confused as him, like he didn't know what had happened either. He blinked hard again, found Harry's gaze once more, his expression thoroughly perplexed and slightly apprehensive.
Harry kissed him on the mouth, and then kissed his crumpling mouth again, and then kept on burrowing kisses everywhere, to his upper lip, and his bottom lip, and the corner of his lips, and his wet cheeks and jaws and neck and shoulder, blindly and desperately kissing every part of him that he could get his mouth on until Draco fumbled to wrap his arms around him tightly, shoved his face into his shoulder with one hard, gasping sob and then cried and cried and cried. Harry held him tightly by his hitching shoulders and the back of his head and whispered,
Harry smiled at him on the screen, at the turn of his face, behind the camera where he could not see it.
"I do feel strange," Malfoy said, threw him a quick glance, a brow raised. He was leading him up the stairs, to the left of the first floor, towards the bedroom. "But not quite like you yet, I suppose."
Draco hesitates. He turns his head, looks to Luna, who's sprawled on the grounds next to him. They've been 'cloud-watching', as Luna calls it, her telling him what each cloud in the sky seems like to her. Too often her observations are comically wild, but sometimes they're a creature that Draco has never heard of, and isn't even sure are real, so she has to describe their appearance.
"Harry!" Hermione said, upon seeing him, grinning. She shook a loose strand of curly hair out of her face, escaped from a messy, slightly damp bun on the back of her head. Ron saw him and smiled too, tossing a cheerful
But Harry's eyes drift, in the midst of chaos and applause and wolf-whistles, to the boy he told weeks ago that he was in love with him.
And as always, thank you so much for all the kind feedback and for sharing all your thoughts on the last chapter!! 💙
"Right. Well. I'm still confused as to how these two are alive," Ron asked, waved at Harry vaguely, his face quivering into an awkward smile, or rather, grimace. "There's got to be some sort of mistake, right?"
Draco was standing next to her, witnessing the exchange. He looked strange, when Harry lifted back into a straighten of his body and saw him. He turned his eyes to his mother, instead, gave her a slight, slanted smile.
In the video was a dim room set golden and alight, a study light somewhere off to the side on the desk. There was Draco drawing his hand away from the lens of the camera, scooting a little back on the chair.
"Well, that doesn't mean I do," Draco said, with a scoff. He looked down at the top of Teddy's head, a slight smile twitching a few seconds after, which made Harry think he did like one, at least.
There had always been a missing page to this entire story, one Harry had unknowingly, continually forced himself not to fill in the gaps of, because the curse had muddled so much between them that there was no way of saying what was necessity, and what wasn't. Because he was scared of laying another burden on Draco after all the things that had happened to him because of Harry. Because he was scared of making things uncomfortable between them when they needed the ease and comfort of being close together, now more than ever.
"You must miss them a lot," Harry said softly, once the laughter died down, as they walked down the street together.
He remembers not much after. The days that follow are a blur. He feels as if he's floating above his body, watching his life happen to someone else. His mind is full of a confusing, baffling meld of memories that he can't always pick apart where they came from. There are times when he can't remember his own name. He lays curled in bed, locked inside of himself.
not fancy a repeat of stumbling across half the floor to your room whilst feeling like I'm about to die the next time I awaken, as I'm sure you do not either? Hm?" Harry could not see his face, but he could hear the thin and satirical smile in his voice, before he turned over onto his other side, his back to him.
"I don't want you to want me. I…" There was a silence. It seemed to last a second too long. Draco's jaw shifted. He was still not looking at Harry. "I'll likely never want you that way either. And you think we have to… to love each other for these two decades to work, but maybe we don't. Maybe we only have to be good to each other. Maybe
. A teal-coloured sleeping potion. Theirs was a bit more green, but well, Professor Slughorn deemed it passable.
Draco huffed, turning his head away, that private edge of a laugh. He lifted his head again, meeting Harry's eyes with his own, smirking back. They seemed so bright in the squint of daylight. "Alright," he said, low, as if accepting a challenge.
"Not that hard," Harry said, shrugging as he made himself tea, well-aware that he might be acting somewhat childish about it but not able to stop himself. It wasn't as if
scouring the entire ground floor, which was enough time for the announcement—or rather, warning—of a visit.
"How can I hurt when holding you?" Harry mouths along to him, smiling. Draco stares at him. "What? It's a cute lyric."
He wonders of Draco, of where he is. Harry had sent an owl to his mother sometime after St. Mungos, inquiring of her well-being and that of Draco's. True to Draco's word, and to Harry's expectations, Narcissa had replied he was no longer staying at the Manor. He'd stuck around for a day, said his farewells and then took off, sending her letters every few days with no disclosure of his current location.
He can hear Longbottom draw a breath, slow and quiet, after a contemplative moment. "Okay. I'll take your word for it, for now, very loosely." There's a long pause, long enough that it seems it's over. "Can I ask where you were last year, then? You weren't at Hogwarts, so I'd have thought you'd be home."
almost imperceptible over the loose curling of the backs of his fingers, the tuck of a touch into the haven of his half-folded palm, fading away as the dream fell into another dream, full of incoherent, distorted images that made no sense to him when he awoke.
Draco takes a spoonful. He tastes nothing. But somehow, having Potter in front of him makes it easier to let it settle, the sight of him that makes the unreachable and intangible malaise in him settle down into a calm and ease and
"Oh." Harry grew warm and flustered. He wasn't sure how he didn't catch the sarcasm, but then again, could he be blamed? He had thought there was no way it could have been as simple as
"We can't keep going like this anymore," Harry said, quieter. "This, not working together. Not talking to each other about important things."
" He sounds overly posh, and Harry represses a smile behind a bite of his treacle tart. He shakes his head and mouths,
He wanted Draco to find out what happened to him. He wanted him to know everything that was his to know.
For an act, it was the easiest thing, to hold his arm out for him, and smile broadly at him, and have him move up next to him, sidle up against his side. He was watching Draco hook his arm through it, touch Harry's bicep with a hand, smiling a little back.
Healer Francine, it turned out, was dealing with another emergency patient, so they had to get another Healer.
no." He sounded strange, a bit strained. He straightened, cleared his throat, quickly, "No, I suppose not. I"d rather… not live like this."
He huffed, and then nodded, raising his head again. Ron was settling down on her other side.  He paused, brows furrowing. "Mate, you don't look very good."
Draco had woken up bitter and aching, filled with an unspeakable fear and anger thrawn in his chest, an ugly and raw thing. It had followed him all through the morning, and seeing Potter in that moment had felt like the last thing he could bear.
"Showing off those beautiful abs!" George came in from behind them, even though he wasn't even a part of the conversation, all flushed and grinning. Then he was sitting down on the opposite arm of the couch, looking at Draco, saying something to him with a smirk, gesturing at Harry.
Harry shook his head, pressing his nose into his snow-blond hair. He swallowed, pressing a kiss to his forehead and wrapping his arms around his neck. "You can go back. You can always go back."
Draco favoured strawberries and cherries in fruits. He'd been taking violins classes since he was seven. He was currently fascinated by and learning to play Jascha Heifetz' pieces. He was trilingual, the third being Italian. He liked butter biscuits.
"Draco," Harry said, quietly. His throat felt strange, a little dry. His temples still throbbed from the alcohol in his system.
"A bit," Harry says, scribbling over his parchment, pausing, crossing out an accidentally repeated word. "Why?"
"I love you too." She draws back from him, touches his cheek, lets it linger for a moment. Then she steps away, takes her broom off the wall. "Take care of yourself, yeah?"
"Interesting," Malfoy said, sounding very much interested. Harry had no idea why his sexuality would fascinate the other man so much, but apparently it did.
He has Draco try some of it, dipped in coconut chutney. It’s only then, when he’s lifting it to Draco’s lips that he remembers a part of Draco’s letters, speaking of moments just like these — the two of them in the morning light of a kitchen just like this, Draco on the counter, Harry making him try his cooking. Draco saying,
"Um. Thank you, really," he said, awkwardly, holding it up for her. "But I don't know if I can… it's too expensive, Luna. I'm really the last person you should be spending that much money on."
Draco let out a breath of something wry, strained and low. "I wouldn't have made it anyway. But I knew you would have tried, because you are annoyingly noble as such. Only…only maybe not nearly as hard as if you were to lose something important to you."
Draco began to tremble slightly against his chest, and Harry's shoulders tensed. His hand was quick to the side of Draco's jaw, craning his head down to get a look at him, terrified it was all coming back again until he heard the sounds coming.
There was complete silence then. Malfoy's eyes were narrowed with intrigue, snow-blonde head tilted slightly.
Here, they watched life live itself through a city. Above, the sun was golden through the clouds, all brilliant waves of light everywhere. Draco was losing himself in it all, the way he had with those paintings — that almost-peace and quiet awe for beauty, like he was seeing it all for the very first time, not the last.
Sometimes it was visible, running bright and sharp through him in tremors. Other times it just made him go lax against Harry, quiet in his arms except for his shallow and slow breaths against his neck. Harry couldn't tell which was worse.
"You'll just make yourself miserable, and you're a coward if you can't tell her you don't want her to her face. You're a coward for letting those Weasleys dictate anything of your life.
"I'm not even much into photography," Harry said, staring down at it as he rubbed the back of his neck. "I don't…. Sorry, I really sound ungrateful, don't I. It's really great, but I just mean…"
. The thought comes out of nowhere. "No, just... like you..." He fumbles with words for a few seconds, finally settles on, "...feel good."
They fell asleep on the bed, Harry between the two of them, Hermione's arm curled around his bicep and her head against his shoulder.
*The constellations spell was mentioned in the ninth chapter of the first part, which Harry had used to try and calm Draco down from his fear of wands.
medical help and was turned away, and we had to resort to seeking a diagnosis from some unreputable underworld Healer instead, which, as we discover now, turned out to be very wrong. He could not even differentiate between a curse and an illness, it seems." Narcissa paused, her face cold, only the slightest raw edge to her voice. "For weeks, I've watched my son live as if he were on numbered days. I have no interest in any sort of power and status if this is what I'd be required to watch for any amount of time."
He wonders if he's ever going to not think of him. If he's going to spend all his life trying not to now.
, that the bond might act up far more, or become more unpredictable, with much less time for pause in between.
He hardly seemed to be mentally present in classes, his gaze somewhere far away deep in his own mind, always hazy and lost. Always so lost.
The thing was that bonding curses that worked on something as internal and volatile as emotions could hardly respond much to any external treatments. There was only easing the symptoms that were to follow, only shifting their focus to the quality of life.
It's a bit strange at first, even if Harry likes it all very much — but it feels a little off-kilter, trying to relearn the way they were, only now there's another layer over it that allows them to kiss behind statues and in alcoves, and fall asleep close and warm under invisibility cloaks in the corners of towers, and sneak in and out of each other's beds some particularly courageous nights and hold hands hidden between their bodies at the edges of lakes.
Okay. Malfoy might not be an evil, scheming git, or even a git at all anymore, really, but that might be ringing a lot of alarm bells in his head. Why did he want to meet
The next time he woke up, it was just when the beginnings of a pre-dawn haze was coming into the room. Draco was sitting on the windowsill, one knee up, looking out.
Harry grins, sidles up next to him to look at them all with him, touching the side of his head against Draco's. They reminisce about them to each other, crack up over the stories behind some of them. Draco turns his head and catches Harry's mouth mid-way through his laugh, quieting them both into the kiss.
The thing was that Harry had been seeing Draco and his things in the kitchen for over a year now, or seeing him in the living room, with a drink and a song on his record player, or him with his violin. Now that he wasn't in the kitchen, and hardly ever came out of his lab beyond when it was necessary, it sometimes seemed like he wasn't in the house at all, and something about that didn't sit right with Harry.
They would pass by each other on the grounds, in the corridors, in the Eighth Year commons on their way to their own dorms. Sometimes, he'd think he noticed Malfoy's steps falter right as they crossed each other, but then would chalk it down to imagination.
There's a pause, a long one, and then a quiet, "If it really means that much to you, Potter, then have at it."
"I…" Harry clears his throat, not sure what to say that won't provoke a rebuke. His face feels hot from mortification.
Malfoy half-smiled slyly and pointed his wand at the man, who was no longer glaring at them, but walking forward, unsuspecting and content in his misconception that he was walking away without any consequences.
"The Basilisk," Potter says. He's told him the story, the Chamber of Secrets in second year, the diary that his father slipped into Ginny Weasley's books, the sword and Dumbledore's phoenix. He hasn't told him about this injury. There is another on the back of his hand,
Draco shakes his head, huffing at himself, muttering, "Nevermind, I— " Potter just pulls him in by the shoulders, holds him closer.
"My daughter," Dudley said, when he saw that. He looked at her. "Emelie. Emelie, say hi. This is your… your uncle, Harry."
Harry swallowed hard, looked down at the back of his own hand on Draco's side, the dampness on them. He could still feel the heat of them through his face, and his breaths were still so heavy they hurt in his throat. "It's not for you to comfort me."
"Tell you a secret?" Draco said, hands steepling together. "Perhaps one of my worst ever, I believe."
It feels a lot like freefalling, when Draco begins to speak, his voice only between the breadth of their faces apart. Potter's arms are a tight grip around him through that freefall, grounding and comforting. He just listens and holds him together all throughout.
Harry sincerely appreciates her efforts, but he has already decided, from then on, to just take all his meals straight from the kitchens.
He can't muster the heat or energy to be proper scathing at the moment, and perhaps this is why Potter, the damned bastard, scoots downward and lies beside him as well, albeit with a great deal of distance between them. He shifts around, getting comfortable, and then faces up at the stars.
Harry is desperately, painfully relieved to hear that, that he has people there around him, that he's safe and getting better and not alone. He wants to ask who the friends are, but he thinks Narcissa won't answer that. There is a lot she doesn't answer, to protect Draco's whereabouts.
, and of course you deserve to go out and find people you really want to be with." Harry relaxed in his chair, and then felt chagrined for his premature reaction. She waved his apologetic look away. "I'm just saying, no, it shouldn't really be considered infidelity in the moral sense, but in the eyes of the
Ginny nods. They share a small, wavering smile. "It's... I can't say it's easy or anything, talking to Aileen either. But it's still easier to talk about it with someone that's outside of it all, you know? Someone that didn't love him and know him. Even if I was any better at talking about things, I wouldn't have wanted to add to your plate either."
Draco pushed at him again. "Get the fuck out! I don't — This is — " His breaths shuddered, his face contorting fully. "Fuck you. You did this to me. This is—this is all your fault—" His voice was thick and wavering again, and he was breaking apart again, and he was breathing hard, laboured. He looked so very sick, hurting.
Nobody knew what had him looking like that, exactly, once it had gone on too long for it to be the usual surprise. Harry had begun to think that it wasn't a good thing, how long the lack of further reaction went on, though he couldn't remember at all any trouble between them. George was taking a sip of his drink, awkward. Draco was clearing his throat next to him, leaning slightly away from Harry to murmur something to Ginny next to him, her making a noise of alarmed agreement.
, because letting go must mean he can imagine throwing them all away, but he can't. Not yet. Maybe one day, but the day is never today.
And then one day, there was a loud crash from the kitchen, shattering ceramic, an almost buried cry amidst them.
The only line of reasoning that makes even a lick of sense for Draco's sudden cold shoulder is that Harry doesn't return his feelings, and Draco is aggrieved by this. But Draco said, in the hospital, that he'd always known this, and surely it means that he doesn't expect Harry to reciprocate what he can't feel. He's only ever been into girls, after all. He's with Ginny.
"And clearly you'd changed your mind," Potter lifts one hand out of his pocket to gesture at him, vaguely. "What did it?"
"Were you really so deprived of romance in your life, Potter?" Malfoy scoffed, remnants of that strange tenderness seeping into his voice despite it. He was still sitting so close to him, his gaze still leaning to meet his. "It's called a kiss. It's what you do when you're in love with someone, to show affection."
"I don't know," Harry said, though maybe he did. Maybe he didn't entirely. It should have been okay, but it wasn't, and Harry just didn't know what had gone wrong. He looked down at his hands. "It's the only thing that makes any sense. I don't know."
Harry returns his smile and rolls back a small laugh, glancing down briefly at the clasp of his hands between his lap to hide it. He knows the answer, but he still asks, "Why do you want to know?"
Draco awoke in a slow stir, Harry's knuckles running featherlight over his cheek. His eyes opened, finding Harry's face, cheek on the soft part of Harry's shoulder joint, head tilted back a bit. He brushed a thumb under his eyes, a breath stuck painfully in his throat.
"You're here," is what Draco says first, into the long silence, like he has perhaps wondered if Harry would be. "You came."
stay after last night. All he wanted right now was to be close to the other boy. "I want to." He shrugged. It wasn't like there would be much consequence anymore. They were adults now.
What he had not expected was for Malfoy to settle down right between the spread of his knees, at his feet. He was startled, staring down at him wide-eyed and frozen. Malfoy's hands held him firm against the chair, warm to his skin. The beginnings of arousal pulsed low in his stomach. Malfoy was looking back at him with a perfectly bland sort of innocence.
When he looked up with a raise of his brows, mid-chewing, Malfoy was unmoving. His nostrils flared. He had that thin smile at his mouth again, more of a sneer than anything. He sat back, a little sideways. "Well. I'm sure it's all very easy, Potter, when you don't have anything better to do than sit around in a bookshop."
That's an idea that Harry can't even wrap his head around. "Wow. That's..." he says. His throat convulses around his lack of words. Everything he can think of saying sounds underwhelming, so he gives up trying. "What—what did you see there?"
It was impersonal and detached, all primal, no meaning. They never kissed, too intimate and something of meaning. They never talked about it outside of what they needed from each other when they were doing it. The level of sexual appetite, it seemed, would be the only thing they had in common.
He didn't, however. It was right as Harry had opened the door of the bedroom that he heard Malfoy's footsteps on the stairs behind him. He leaned beside the door frame on his shoulder, waited until Malfoy had slipped in, closed it shut with a soft click.
There are times when it hits him, out of nowhere, the sudden weight of the realization that Draco has been in love with him for years, even if Harry would never have known this if their time at St. Mungos hadn't ended the way it did. There are times when he feels that phantom of a kiss again, the way it leaves his lips and his chest feeling strange, leaves a fluttery and fast and erratic pulse that beats down into his gut, leaves his skin hot and uncomfortable.
After a momentary bout of shock, eyes shut in startlement and white-blond eyebrows raised up high, Draco responded, lips parting slightly on the next kiss. His hands tugged him closer by the biceps and then wrapped roughly around his waist, one hand clutching at his cheek to hold him in place. He was snogging him back just as desperately, like he was compelled and couldn't help himself, giving back one open-mouthed kiss after another after another, one kiss, two kisses, three more, tongues pressing tentatively against each other's. Their tilted heads switched to their opposite sides to fit their lips better, noses knocking together and Harry's glasses cutting into the bridge of his nose.
He knew that Draco had a mole at the side of his throat, that he had a birthmark on his hip, and he was sensitive on his neck, and his abdomen, the dips of dimples at his lower back, the inside of his knees. He had a greyed Dark Mark, with so many glamours on it that the skin there looked bright. He had scars, the terrible ones Harry had given him, but he hid them too. Harry wondered, vaguely, what it was that made him turn out the lights until he came back one day without them. Had he interpreted whatever Harry must have looked like as a face of disgust?
I don't know if they'd be allowed to leave school grounds, but seeing as they're 18, I'm going to assume they have the freedom after school
Harry hides a smile behind his fingers, one arm folded across his chest. Draco somehow manages to catch him anyway and glares, that scowl of his that Harry's noticed Scorpius take on at times. Harry wipes it off quickly.
Ron stared at him some more. He blinked. Beside him, Hermione's eyes were widened, her cheeks red. Clearly, she had caught on much faster.
Harry closes the box quickly, closing his eyes, putting the back of a hand to his quivering mouth. He opens his trunk and fits it inside with all his things and the drawings and the notes.
"Please do," Draco says. The chocolate frog ribbits in his grip, as he turns his card over to look at it.
"Hi," Draco responded in kind, just as hushed, the two of them quietly staring at one another for a moment. He then swallowed, rolling over on his back, and then stared at the ceiling for a moment. He lifted a hand and rubbed at his face. "What… what time is it?"
He made his way to the drawing room and settled him down on the couch, kneeled down on the floor beside him and rucked up the tuck of Malfoy's shirt into his waistband and got his hands, still trembling, on his skin, the slight curve of his waist. It was the only thing he could think of doing.
Neville stares at him, and nods, arms folded over his chest. He looks down at his shoes, away. "Yeah. Okay. I'll… I'll come back, yeah? To check on you."
It took a moment for Harry to really understand what he was trying to say. When it sank in, Harry's face furrowed, and he was left voiceless for another moment, mouth working. "Draco," he whispered. "Come on."
Then, he smirked, slightly, and he looked at Harry. "What do I want?" He pushed himself off the wall, the wine in his glass jostling slightly. "What don't I want?"
In watching these videos, he could remember all the times the words had been there, right there on the edge of his tongue. The way he felt. He had watched Draco laugh at something Harry said, and all he could think was,
— and she kept repeating it back to him all sympathetic and patient. Then, she asked for his hand in a very soft voice, and when he gave it to her only half-aware of anything, she touched it to Draco's sternum, said that spell again,
"I brought 'Mione's duplicated notes," Potter announces as he shuffles in through the curtains, stacks of papers under his arm. He drops them down beside Draco with a thud.
Madam Pomfrey raises an eyebrow, pushing him down with one hand. His head is spinning again. He clenches his eyes shut, trying to make it stop. "I don't believe you have much of a choice, young man, seeing as you can hardly get up of your own accord."
He took up art again, an old hobby revived. In Eighth Year, Hogwarts built a system of including muggle extracurricular activities. There'd been a lot of options, but Harry had remembered himself at five through ten, sitting in a small cupboard surrounded by crumpled paper and broken, used up colour pencils, wishing for paints and art sets like the ones Dudley had and never bothered to use, and he'd chosen painting without a second thought. He never stopped loving it after, found a corner of peace within it in the midst of his chaos and grief.
He has always struggled to feel it. Being loved. But with Draco, the way he loved Harry, there was never any doubt, because he loved him so openly and tenderly that Harry had no choice but to feel it.
The first time anybody referred to their 'marriage' was a teasing by an elegant, middle-aged woman when she saw how close they were standing next to each other. The second was an old, bizarrely dressed lady that made everything her own business, it seemed. She noticed how aloof Harry was, and was going on about how
"Five months," Draco says. He has Harry against a pillar, away from eyes, Harry's hands running up his arms.
When the chilled silence persists long enough for it to grow thick and uncomfortable, he nods uneasily, rubbing the back of his neck. "Er, right." He turns fully around, and then stops, and then turns back. With another smile, softer, he says, "I'm glad to see you here, Malfoy."
The cushioning charm on the floor of the Astronomy Tower is a bit of a relief, Potter's back wedged against the wall, but trying not to shift around too much under the Invisibility cloak lest if fall off doesn't help sleep come easy. Still, Potter's arms wound tight and warm around him settles the malaise around his heart, as if it's been pushed out of place and now finally fitting in its cavity. The things he doesn't want to think about, they fray at the edges of his mind, and he focuses instead on counting Potter's breaths, one inhale, one exhale. Inhale. Exhale.
Harry laughed, small. It was still a little too loud in his woozy, heavy mind, to his own ears. There was that surprised raise of Draco's eyebrow, a longer glance, a hint of a smile, or a smirk. Harry couldn't tell from the mere wisp of it. He looked a little flushed from the drinks, Harry noticed.
Draco nods. "Good. Well. That's done, then." He holds his arms out, hands around the bottom of the basket full of food items, most of them being Potter's usuals.
On Wednesdays, Hagrid invites Harry, Ron and Hermione into the hut for tea. Then it's off to Quidditch practice for him and Ron, during which Harry gets to see Ginny as well. Then, around evening, after a shower and a change of clothes, they all go out to The Three Broomsticks.
Even so, Draco's face goes pink up to his ears, obviously mortified. For all his composure, this has always been what has given him away. A second later, his eyes dart quickly, mystifyingly, onto
Now he wondered if it didn't matter, if Malfoy had maybe just needed someone. Anyone. Even if it was an ex-childhood rival he hardly even liked or wanted around him.
"Or not," Potter says. He gives him a flicker of a smile, holds it, rueful and small and tight. He looks impossibly young, his face sweet with boyishness and free of a life full of laughter.
And finally, to Tepre and their beautiful, beautiful fic, Grounds for Divorce. It really got the ball rolling for this one! That fic was so badly on my mind the first (and second) time I read it, and I think this largely began as an attempt to calm down some of that love that I nearly didn't know what to do with
It was his fingers, brushing over Harry's lightning scar, thumb coming over his brow, and his mouth slanted into the slightest of a smile. It was the two of them, circling slowly in the small steps of a dance, a strange and sad sort of finality breathing between them, and the man at the piano, still singing,
"Please, Uncle Harry," Emelie said, then, clapping her hands together and putting them on her cheeks, her chin, as if to express excitement. "It'll be so fun! And maybe you can teach me some of your magic tricks, and you can tell me all about the wizards and witches, and the magic school— " She rambled a bit.
There were many reactions Harry had expected. It was not the way he stayed entirely quiet and still, fell asleep not long after. Harry followed him as well, with the calm of waves between them, like the sea, and the heat of their bodies close, the tender ache in his chest closer. His own heart, throbbing against Draco's back.
Draco looks up at him, shifting his jaw. There's too much to the answer of that question. There's not much that he can say of it, and Potter's staring back at him, waiting for it. Draco's vision focuses on brilliant green eyes, thick black lashes, and he is so very beautiful, the only thing still as bright and beautiful as his dreams—the dreams of whom kept Draco as sane as he still is, somehow, after everything.
And eventually taken up by the tumultuous waves of his own foolish feelings, Draco finds himself growing completely lost to the deep, blinding pull within himself, something that shuts his eyes and mind to imprudence and rationality after a particular point.
In all this, he tries his best not to think about Draco, and ends up thinking about him anyway. He's looking through furniture for Grimmauld Palace and thinking of what Draco would have said about the ugly ones. He's studying and beginning to slack off and he can hear Draco admonishing him. He's looking at a corner of his home, the countertop, the fireplace of his living room, and thinking about a part of Draco's letters, a part of his memories. He's wondering what their home looked like in Draco's dreams, sometimes wondered what it would have been like, remaking them all here, the two of them. Draco would leave him notes here, and here, and here, and he would kiss him every morning before he left for his training, and on Christmas every year, they would dance under fairylights by a tree, just like they did on the Quidditch pitch and the Astronomy Tower all those nights a long time ago.
He laid down on the bed, still breathing unsteadily, but fatigue had begun to set into his muscles, overpowering the turmoil of his emotions, and soon, sleep came over him, fading him away.
Malfoy was sitting across from him at the table, having oh-so-generously left some space for Harry to have his breakfast again.
Draco was not amused or impressed, going by the glower he threw him, all tightened lips and a raised eyebrow. Harry laughed, smiling to himself, still, when he tore his eyes away from him. He picked up the mug Draco slid over to him, and subtly, he stepped closer to him as he did.
Malfoy didn't say anything to that, thankfully. He threw him the green and red cap. Harry caught it on reflex, and then glanced down at it, not sure what he was supposed to do with it.
Harry's smile slid off very quickly from his lips when Malfoy's curled into that damn smirk, narrowed silver eyes glinting with mischief, as if he knew just what to do to shut Harry up.
It took awhile for the words to sink in, so bewildered he was. "I'm… I'm married. If you forgot that."
Draco shakes his head. "No." He is watching the pavement, hands resting into the pockets of his coat. Harry remembers, vaguely, Narcissa's letter, telling him of the sickening air of dark magic left behind. The way it suffocates her, haunted Draco. "I owled her yesterday to tell her I won't be. She responded this morning. Told me it was alright, as long as I was well."
Draco is currently on probation, so travelling isn't possible anyhow at the moment. Most likely, he will wait until after graduation, if only for his mother's sake, before he can take any steps towards this.
He was roused from sleep in another blink, his head pounding. When he checked the Tempus, it had been an hour since they'd returned from the party. More than that, he felt the beginnings of a nauseating malaise through his body. He looked beside him. The other side of the pillow was neat, untouched.
"Yet she has never tried to reach out to me once," Andromeda says, coolly. She has a sharp and stern face when she isn't smiling.
They both turned around at the same time to look at the newcomer, Harry's smile growing on his face. Ron spread his arms wide as he entered, and Harry got up and hugged him. He let go with a pat to Harry's shoulder.
"In the forest," Harry continued. "I had the resurrection stone." It was now that he wished, desperately, that he still had it. "It gave me a choice to go, or come back."
Draco can do nothing but stare at her for a long moment, perched on the edge of his seat, hands tight around the arms of the chair. There is hope brewing in his chest, even against all the odds, that he most likely can't afford such services, or the trek of searching for someone who can help him in such a way.
Harry stared at him. So Malfoy called him all the way here to have him publicly endorse his family name. His eyes narrowed, smiling thinly. "You can't be serious."
Draco sees Remus Lupin in the child's face. He hasn't seen Nymphadora closely enough to say much about her. But his nose is the same as Andromeda's, certainly.
And they're walking down the streets of London after a night at the pub, Harry's tongue running away from him, telling him this and this and this. Telling him everything, namely of these past few years, except he's leaving out all the ways he's been craving after him.
And then Harry forgot all about his social rules. "He's not a Death-Eater anymore," he said, coldly. He stood up, pushing himself away from him. "Now if you'll excuse me
"Get your shite off the table so I don't have to put mine on yours," Harry retorted, still flipping through the pages, and then flipping backwards when he saw that he was too far ahead.
Draco frowned. He touched his face with his inked fingers, got more faded smudges there. Harry smiled, dropping his head a bit to hide it.
He would feel it, wouldn't he? Their magical cores were connected. The bond, the marital channel, they linked them together. Harry would feel it, if it was happening right now. He kept telling himself this, whilst murmuring the spell that would let him feel his internal state,
you think I like this very much myself? Living with you here in this house?" Malfoy leaned forward, slowly, mouth curling around the edge of a sneer. "
He was just laughing, thick and watery, sort of choked and forced out of him in stilted bursts, and Harry was putting his forehead to his before he was realising it, laughing with him in that same thick and watery way, overcome with a love so tender and painful he didn't know where anything began and ended. He could not bring himself to tell Draco the rest of the story, when the Dursleys came home and got so angry at him.
But Harry loses all his nerve, and ends up asking instead, "So, the obliviation procedure, um — what happened?"
The auction came and went, and the highest bidder was a young man, Timothy Foster, who had a habit of interrupting people too much, or so it seemed. Draco would begin to speak, only to be left trailing off as Timothy cut in over him with some comment or the other. By the third time, Draco seemed thoroughly annoyed by this, though he only seemed coldly reposed on the outside, but Harry saw him because he always saw him, always too busy glancing over at him, trying not to, than to be paying attention to the conversation at hand. The lady on the left had noticed by then too, throwing them an apologetic look.
"What if it gets in the wrong hands!" Harry was saying, slightly wild and frantic, trying to pull him down and tugging at his arm. "Somebody like Skeeter would have a field day with—"
Your wand movements are all way off, Potter, and only Salazar knows what you just said right now because your pronunciation was entirely incorrect. It's not
"Stop trying to comfort me," Harry said. "You're not supposed to be the one comforting me after everything that's just happened."
"Yeah," he says, finally giving that breath of a small, hesitant smile. He brings with him, like summer breezes, the memories of coin calls and sneaking in and out of dorms and arms around him under the rectangle of a doorway, lying together on the floor of towers under galaxies, dancing under stars, huddled together in alcoves. Soft kisses and warm laughter and wild, spontaneous dancing. "Yeah, I did."
"My magic," Draco said, then, hoarse and thick, and the bottom of Harry's stomach fell out right then and there.
Between them, in the winds of their silence, are all the years, time and history and the things said and unsaid. Done and undone.
Every night, he ends up here, sitting stone-still on the foot of his bed, his gaze losing focus on the wood line patterns of the floortiles. His mind is becoming hazy again, full of fragmented memories and dreams of a boy and a man in another faux life that was more real than anything here.
"Excuse me," Harry said, just before dinner, thinking about Draco, who would already be done with dinner by now. He would be waiting up for him, as he always did, with a book and a light on. "I have to make a call."
His secret crush on Cedric had complicated things even more, even if he hadn't entirely understood it then.
He had been on the edge of erasing him from his mind, wholly and irrevocably, that day. He would have. Pansy says that he should have. That surely nobody could be worth remembering, holding on to, after such terrible grief. That, he did remember, though hazily when it was so closely associated to his lost memories, but he remembered the way it had felt, with not much exaggeration, like he may just be dying without him. Love at its worst. Too much of it, and too much of anything was never a good thing.
Though these days Draco still seemed almost alright, if only a little fatigued. If only a little out of it sometimes. But he got out of bed, and he took care of himself well, with a forceful and mastered sort of discipline even through his fatigue. He visited his mother, Andromeda and Teddy, and he wrote owls to Luna, and he met with his Mind-Healer, who was specialised in dealing with people undergoing terminal illnesses.
Harry's mouth works around the answer. "Yeah. I just want to... be alone, if you don't mind. You should go on."
Harry couldn't speak, his eyes following Draco when he walked past him. He watched him ignore him for a moment in favour of continuing his work, his back to him, and then Harry turned and headed for the door, leaving the room.
" She swallowed, inspecting the smoke that dissipated a few seconds after. "It's a curse. From the looks of it, it's a dark one. Oh, Harry, why didn't you say you haven't been feeling well?"
an explosion of dark magic that had killed both parties as well as the rest of those in the room. Surely we will not be trying this?" The room was silent. Narcissa stroked back the side of Draco's hair, soothingly.  Hermione gripped Harry's hand tighter. "I understand that this is not...
Harry hadn't thought much about that in these last four days, frankly. His head had been too full of the alteration, too full of the idea of freedom and hope, but now that the moment was so close, it had never felt further away. He had never felt so surreal and aware of everything that could go wrong. So afraid, in particular after reading the clauses of the contract, all the uncertainty that they had to agree to. But he'd thought of all of last year, thought of every year being like this until he was forty, and then it was worth a try. And then anything was worth more than sitting silent and stuck in a life so small and boxed in by this curse.
He turned the doorknob, walked into the bedroom. He paused in the doorway upon seeing the silhouette under the blankets, the flash of bright hair in the dark. The pillow was back in the middle of the bed again.
Draco hums. In Harry's peripheral vision, he can see him turn to face ahead. "You were the last piece, since you were the clearest root of those memories. Forgetting you would have made my obliviation permanent."
The new Eighth-Year Commons is a modest-sized expanse of area themed with colours of all Houses, a fireplace at the opposite end of the entrance door, which is guarded simply by a door that allows entry to only certain people and opens at the correct password. It is, essentially, a small central lounge opening into several dorm rooms.
To be kissed by Potter is to live a thousand moments in a few seconds, familiar and strange all at once.
"To cry for a person is one of the purest expressions of caring," Madam Aileen says. "Surely it means something." When there is no acknowledgment of her point, she continues, "What is it like, waking up again?"
It was when Harry had laid down next to him, shifting under covers, that he heard, softly, "My love."
"I'd like to have a kiss from a good-looking man," Draco said, the corner of his mouth quirking slightly.
Potter's brows are furrowed in contemplation, picking out a handful of sweets as he peers at something else on the shelf, as if contemplating whether he wants to buy it or not. He turns, without lifting his gaze away from it, lingering indecisively. He finally tears away after a moment, looking up and ahead and then right at Draco, worn trainers halting to a stop.
"Have it later then, when you can," was all he said, pressing it to Harry's chest. It was warm. Harry's hands raised up to it, holding it close in baffled instinct—and in doing so, he accidentally brushed his fingers over the back of Draco's knuckles, a sweet fizzle up their nerves.
Malfoy seemed to be in a hurry, perhaps doing last-minute homework. He had a blotch of ink at his jaw, his temple. "Because you're already there and I don't want to lose my flow."
There was nothing after that. There was just the sound of rustling clothes, when he took off his own robes, and the sheets when Harry laid down behind him on the bed. He slid an arm around him, scooted up close to his back, feeling the clarity of his body and heat through his shirt, reflecting back to himself.
Ron peers at him for a moment, and then snorts out a laugh. "Don't tell me it was the one after his own name." Neville stares at him, sips at his drink and shrugs. "Oh. Wow. Some things never change, eh? The sun might die, but the constancy of Draco Malfoy's narcissism never will."
"You might guess where it came from," Harry said, letting out a wry breath, as Draco touched it beneath the centre of his glasses. It was slight, hardly noticeable unless somebody looked very closely.
like war all over again. His life had become so small, with this curse boxing him in, and the ring stuck to his finger, weightless with habit until he caught sight of it, remembered what it meant. Then it was like a noose around his neck.
—it was used especially in transplantation processes. The wand movements were awfully complicated, as were the Latin words. He thought he must need Hermione's help with these, only he knew she would work out what he wanted to do, not let him do it. So he had to do it all on his own.
How long had he felt it coming, Harry wondered. Draco must have known something was wrong, for a long time now. He was too smart not to.
Harry had a drink after that, and then two, sat in the corner as the party went on. Draco was sitting in a circle of Luna and Ginny, and he was seemingly getting along quite well with Ginny. She was laughing, glancing over at Harry along with a smiling Luna, while Draco hid the quirk of his mouth into the rim of his glass.
"Quite a convenient time to have your realisation. No matter, Potter," Draco said, still sounding very cold. He stood up, adjusting his folded suit over his arm. "You understand I'm under just as much necessity as you."
"You're terribly saccharine," Draco said, though he didn't seem to mind it all that much. "Can we get up now?"
Malfoy only spoke again after he returned, handing him his glass. Harry did not plan to drink it. "Right. Let's get down to business then, shall we?" he said as he settled back down on the sofa, leaned back, legs crossed, ankle over knee. He picked up his drink again. "You see, Potter, Mother and I believe it is time for us to make our amends, and so—" He cleared his throat, a hint of a bob against the neck of his jumper. "We're hosting some charity events, the proceedings of which should go to renovations of Hogwarts and any other affected areas, as well as to war causes and organizations."
Only, when he does try dating other people, it doesn't work no matter how smart and funny and attractive they are because none of them are the right kind of smart and funny and attractive and none of them have the right accent or the right voice or the right shade of silver eyes and white-blond hair and none of them — none of them are him.
Either that, or they give each other the googly eyes, and sometimes, if given the opportunity, they disappear off to snog and do other stuff that Harry's not interested in thinking about.
Whenever he does come back, Pansy is often sat there beside him, though with a good amount of distance to give him space. There with her closeness, but not touching. Sometimes Blaise comes in, taps her shoulder, takes over.
"Draco," he whispers, in that tender way he often did now, a voice reserved for him. Draco listens only for that, stilled, his chest heaving slightly. His breathing is still a bit heavy. "I'm sorry."
Malfoy's eyes were on Harry's face, but he seemed just a bit more aware than some moments ago, and when his lips moved around a murmur, it formed into a shallow, ragged blur of breaths, "you need
Draco tries to push himself up into a sitting position. His mother shakes her head, pressing down on his shoulders. "You've lost a lot of blood. You must rest." She swallows, her face quivering. She blinks, pressing her lips together in restraint. Draco complies, laying back down with a frustrated breath. "Tell me what happened. Who did this to you?"
"But you were still unsure, weren't you? Would you have done it if I hadn't said all those things, pressured you?"
"Your father seemed very sad whenever he spoke of you," she says, then. "as if something had happened to you."
Then Harry's bathroom was full of Malfoy's hair and skin products. Then, on the kitchen table, were his parchments and his quills and his ink bottles, the ink stains that were left forgotten and uncleaned, and his books and notes strewn about, and Harry would have to pull up his chair to the counter in order to have a place to sit. Then, there began a daily reminder in the evenings when he would play his violins in the drawing room. In the living room was his ancient record player, sitting on a side table brought specifically for it.
Draco can't speak, can only stare at him. His brows scrunch together, his lips parted in uncertainty.
Draco's jaw shifts, close-mouthed. Sometimes it's still hard not to feel small next to him, to feel like he's nothing more than a broken body in a hospital bed. Telling him anything about it feels like bringing himself back to that level to Potter.
The embarrassment begins to sink in deep, spreading a hot flush up his neck. It sounds much too lamenting. He wishes he didn't say anything.
Harry fell asleep very late, focusing vividly on the rise and fall of Draco's chest, and the soft rush of the sound of his breathing, warm and steady at his own neck.
Harry was forgetting to take care of himself often, these days. Draco had taken to reminding him of it whenever he could, to go take a shower, to eat as well, as did the notes left by Ron, Hermione and Molly around the house.
And off went Draco's list of adventures for their day, fairly extensive. It included a tour through Canal Saint-Martin, the Versailles Palace, the Notre Dame cathedral, the beautiful bridge of Pont Alexandre III, and many more plans that Harry didn't believe they could fit into a single day.
Harry turns his face, so close to his beneath the constricted space of the coat. "I didn't mean…" But he stops, because he may not have meant it that way, but maybe that is exactly what it means. "No. Sorry. You're right."
But then everything Draco still didn't know had cast a gloom over him, when Draco had taken his arm and wrapped it around himself as he shifted over onto his side and let Harry push his mouth into the nape of his neck, breathe him in, falling back asleep for another hour or two.
Harry had a hard time wrapping his head around that. "Really?" He sounded skeptical, trying not to be too hopeful. "It can't really be that easy."
When the sight of Draco at the fireplace finally seems to sink in, his mother begins to cry, reaching forward for him with her hands. Her hair is well-kempt, her clothes sharp and pressed as usual, but she is thin and frail under it all.
He comes back to Harry's face, finds him gentle and understanding. His love for him is a calmer thing now, no longer an entire ocean gone to storm—but he is impossibly, overwhelmingly precious, and for a moment, it drowns him under.
"Sorry to disappoint," Draco said, just as quietly. His jaw was tight, his eyes cold. "But I'm not very eager to end my life all too soon."
"So, in short, Ron and I got on fairly quick. It took time to get used to Hermione, especially for Ron, but here we are."
"Make me a cup too, would you?" Malfoy didn't look up from where he was scribbling down at a parchment, fingers and eyes moving in intense concentration.
But now they aren't talking. Days ago Draco would make a step towards him only for Harry to turn around and walk away, and sometimes he'd look at him in an unfathomable sort of way, but now he is adamant in avoiding his gaze, hollow and turned firmly past him whenever they cross each other, Harry's eyes following him until he's disappeared at the end of the corridor. He keeps wanting to say something, his voice at the tip of his tongue whenever he sees him, but he's always left without words.
"Fuck," Harry gasped out, nearly a sob, into his neck. He was grappling for him, pulling him close by the waist, trying to breathe through a terror and grief that hadn't happened, that only lived within himself. "Fuck."
He doesn't notice his long sleeve has ridden up, until Potter's eyes have strayed, a frown twitching between his brows. It startles him a bit, when Potter's fingers push it down, trace over the jagged scars over his left forearm, edging around his Dark Mark, as if he thinks it will hurt Draco if he touches it.
looked at him." She scoffs, shaking her head, leaning back against the headboard. "I tried to ignore it for the longest time, but — eventually I did realise there was no chance, because you weren't even into girls."
Harry has nothing, no way to reach that train. He didn't bring a broom. He can't Apparate in these warded areas. He can't breathe even as he's pulling desperately for it, his body gone numb, and he's just standing there, watching a train take away the boy he loves, disappearing completely to the eye.
The details of the curse were still mostly unclear, besides that it was passed on from the primary source, Malfoy, and would likely demand some sort of contact, that it deteriorated the magical cores, and as it did, it emitted unstable dark magic in an open flow, spreading its sickness.
Harry opened his mouth. Draco shouldered past him quickly, nearly knocking into him if Harry hadn't moved a little aside. His jaw shifted, mouth parted around another apology. He sighed, closing his eyes, closing his lips together. He turned around, then, and followed after Draco, not looking forward to a cold, awkward necessitated contact, feeling sick with mild hangovers and shame and as if they'd just gone ten steps back.
He's entirely breathless and sweaty, his heart pounding terribly, by the time he's turning into the crack of an Apparition and landing where the anti-Apparition wards started, by the time he's running the rest of the way to the Hogsmeade station. Far in the distance, the train is a mere pin-point. He's breathing heavy and hard, folded at the abdomen with heaves for air, a hand on a pillar. Draco is in that train, and he is leaving Harry behind, going Merlin knows where, all without even a word to him.
There, footsteps come nearer behind him, trudging in the dirt, rustling grass. He doesn't look behind him. He doesn't need to.
Some days went like that, when talking was easy, topics branching into more topics, until they ran out of things to say. Other days Draco seemed less inclined for a conversation, or at least seemed more resistant and wary to it, though Harry wasn't sure what for.
Potter kisses him behind a statue in the corridor they'll have to part ways from, asks Draco to be by the Great Lake for lunch, and grins much too brilliantly at Draco on his affirmation before he kisses him again, hard enough this time that it bobs his head back.
"Fuck off!" Draco shoves at his shoulder, nearly tipping him over into the Lake. Harry laughs, gripping hard at the edge and Draco's arm to keep his balance.
Malfoy shook his head, coughed a bit to clear his voice, and then inhaled and exhaled, trying to regain his breaths back.
"For one: Headmistress McGonagall won't stand for it, and you know everybody's scared of her wrath. And two…" Harry pauses, licks his dry lips. He glances down at his fingers, idly rubbing sheets between them. He shrugs. "Well. They all know, don't they? That they can't do anything to you? Not unless they want me on their arse for it."
He would ask every night, or he would ask about his outing when he visited Ron and Hermione or the Weasleys for short hours, or he would come into the drawing room for a drink while Harry was painting and ask him what he was working on.
The world outside the pane of window is a haze of platforms, and then the spread of the city of London, and then the cloudy skies and verdant lands. Draco watches it all pass him by, his head full and distant, lips pressed into the ring on his knuckle.
"He doesn't know that it worked," Xavier said, speaking a bit over him. His hollowed cheekbones made his eyes look older, baggier. Faint lines ran across his forehead when his brows went slightly high. "And he cannot know any of this."
It takes her a while to get herself to speak, as if she's forcing her voice out. "Why did you try to do that?"
This goes on for quite a time, Harry so fixated by Draco as he works almost desperately to find facts and concepts that he thinks the children would find fun, and the children don't seem to understand.
holding it still very gently, his polishes neat and careful. He'd taken one of Andromeda's nail varnish bottles. He didn't want to do it on Teddy's fingers, because Teddy still had that terrible baby habit of putting them in his mouth.
"Leave me," Draco mumbles, pushing at Potter's hands, his chest, his own hands too heavy to move much.
and saw it was seven. I got out of bed, and it's completely dark. I'm really confused in my half-asleep state, wondering why it's so dark at seven in the morning, right? And why the hell is the sky
His friends worry about him. He knows he doesn't talk enough anymore, and he's always irritated when he's with them, and he doesn't care to clean much of his house or himself these days. He knows he's an utter mess.
Harry went back to sleep, ear to the reassurance of his heartbeat, Draco's hands stroking his hair back.
In the evening back at Andromeda's, they went to the backyard, where Harry flew low and careful on a broom with Teddy, who was gripping the end tightly, giggling on a squeal. Draco must have come in at some point, lounging into the doorframe with his arms folded over his chest, graceful and cat-like as ever.

He's never noticed these things about a boy. He hasn't noticed he's been noticing them about Draco. Or maybe he has. Just hasn't thought much of what it meant for him to be.
"We really need to stop falling asleep like this," Harry declares. His back aches. His neck aches. Everything aches. He winces, grimacing as he rubs at the twinge in the back of his neck, sharing a look with Draco. "
1) Both parties were well-aware of the level of risk and uncertainty involved in this procedure, and that if anything were to go wrong, it was agreed that the curse-alterer and the medimagical staff would not be held responsible or liable to charges.
And Harry always liked the way Draco would mindlessly grab for the wrist or sleeve of his free hand, jostle at him to get his attention, pull him along to something he really wanted to see or shop at or go into. He liked the way he would turn around into the camera with the crescent-moons in his cheeks, a crinkle lighting up his eyes, and the wind in his hair playing up as he walked backwards, hands in his coat pockets, and told Harry about an old childhood memory here, a fascinating fact of history there.
Harry hummed, affirmative, unspeakably relaxed where he leaned back against the tub. He was stuck on Draco's face, sure that all his soppy feelings were coming through: his heart, an aching swell in his chest, in his throat. Not that he was trying very hard to keep it off his face. Draco was so busy and focused on what he was doing that he didn't see it.
Harry stayed silent, resisting the urge to side-eye Malfoy. He had no idea who the Colovaria were. And
Hermione was sitting with half of her back against Ron's chest, their hands tangled on his thigh. Ron's knee was touching his, a wordless comfort. His mouth squinched up at a corner, cleared his throat and looked away, like he didn't know what to say about it. None of them knew, it seemed. Harry knew this was all they had. Cutting down to five years was the most he could get, and it still felt like forever, more real and fathomable in a way that twenty years hadn't been.
Part of him wants to run, to leave Potter first, but then what is he left with? It seems these days that Potter is the only thing that makes him feel anything close to real.
It meant nothing. Nothing beyond that they both had needs, and nobody else to fulfil them. A last resort and an only choice, just until this was all over and they could find other people.
"It's alright. It's in the past now," Draco says, reading his remorse. "I left, didn't I. It's her you ought to
When they were in the VIP section, separated by a barrier surrounding a region up close to the stage, Harry turned around to the taller boy and gritted out, "Merlin's Beard, this better not be all because you wanted to get into a stupid concert without a ticket, Malfoy!"
At night, Draco finds that sleep is impossible without a certain voice murmuring him towards it. Without the vivid awareness of a presence beside him, and the calm and safety that had settled inside of his chest like the quiet after a storm.
There were many mundane pictures, just Draco walking down the street, sitting in a car beside him with his face towards the window, across the booth from Harry where they ate, stood beneath tall historical buildings as he observed them to the fullest.
Strange, that he should come back again years later, and not feel so much the stench of the horrible things that happened here, the horrible people that lived here once. Strange that none of this weighs down on him so much anymore, because hardly anything is there of it in his mind, now, to hold that heaviness in him.
After a moment of appraisal, an obscure sort of look, Draco said, folding his arms as he leaned back on the chair, "Burgundy. Or Auburn. I suppose I should say certain shades of pink or red, then, but I wouldn't want you to think it's something like your Gryffindor red. That is an eyesore, truly."
on the ink, faded blue stains still left behind, and then repairs the shattered bottle. He puts the box under his bed, charmed to disintegrate if anybody other than him ever touches it. He stands up from his chair, abrupt, grabs his coat on his way out of the room.
"Okay," Draco said, softly, and burrowed closer to him. Harry pulled him in, tucked his nose into the hinge of his jaw and breathed him in.
"You Gryffindors," Malfoy said with a scoff. "Always with the violence. Don't you know the art of subtlety can be utilized brilliantly when it comes to vengeance?"
were okay, but nothing was making sense anymore. This curse didn't make sense, and why this had happened didn't make sense, and no Healer or Cursebreaker could say much about anything when it came to curses like these, when everything was so ambiguous, and so Harry was left with a harrowing confusion and no explanation and nothing to tell Draco except that —
He was leaning his forehead against the dried canvas. He opened his eyes and saw the face in front of him clearly. For the first time, he saw not his eyes, or his hair, or his cheeks, or his hands, but wholly the person in front of him. All of him.
Still, his hands were trembling, and still, they were gentle when Harry laid him down on the bed, one knee on the edge of it, supporting his head in the very last of the lowering. His head came very close to the hollow of Draco's neck.
It's only when Potter's fingers touch his cheek that he feels the dampness of his own grief, the force of his own love mingled with it. He hears the tremor of his own breathing.
In the Fourth Chapter, Draco is rescued by Harry, Ron and Hermione, but remains comatose due to the potion and is on the verge of death.
Teddy is a fickle one, having days where he prefers certain people more than others. Andromeda will never be able to say it, but Harry knows she doesn't mind too much when others take over caring for Teddy. No one else does either. He sees grief in her eyes, still, when she looks at Teddy. He thinks it hurts her to see him sometimes, to see his eyes and his lips and not have her daughter.
"You're going to be so loved." Harry brushes his lips against the baby's forehead. He's fallen asleep against his chest. They were the same, Harry and Teddy, but they won't grow up the same. "I know you'll grow up one day, and you'll miss them very much, but you'll never be anything short of loved, Teddy."
It's normal, Harry thinks, to feel flustered and discomfited about something like this, especially if he's not into boys, especially if the boy is one he knows has feelings for him. He averts his head further away, looking down at the cracked concrete floor. He gathers his things, feeling Drado's sharp gaze bore into him. "Nothing, I just…" He stands up quickly, dusts his knees. "I just remembered I had something, so I have to go before the classes start." He spins on his feet, and then pauses. He turns back around, clearing his throat. "I'll see you at lunch. Draco."
Draco spread his hand out in a quick shrug of a gesture, an opening of his fingers before curling again. One elbow was on the arm of the couch. His drink was in his other hand, the sprawled arm, the tumbler held loose from the top. "What you're painting. Beauty? Someone you love?" There sounded an underlying wryness to it.
When the birdsong and the gentle hue of daylight, through translucent curtains, awoke Harry again, it was to the first sight of Draco's sleeping face in front of him. He was a heated line pressed flush against Harry's side, all fine skin and thin scars and elegant bone structure.
Grief had been something so big that Harry didn't know how to feel it for months after it happened, and now it comes out in ebbs; at the sight of their old pictures, at the sight of Teddy doing something wonderful or funny or endearing, or him reaching a milestone, and the sight of the empty spaces in George's room and the unoccupied chair at the kitchen table, the whereabout clock where Harry came back one day and found his own face had taken its place. Not to replace, of course. Never to replace. But only to put it there.
In the papers, that was what everybody seemed to expect of him — that he would go on and continue to be the saviour of the world in some form. Saying that now, he kept having the strange sense that he disappointed somebody ever since the words left him.
He sees his tousled raven-black hair amongst ginger-reds and bushy brown, all the rest of the world around him blurred out. He sees him leaning his face close to the crying infant in his arms, murmuring to him, a soothing hand running over baby-blue locks. The golden sunlights of the morning are falling down on him, alighting his cheeks, catching on the ebony of his curls and the green of his eyes.
Malfoy moved forward, tried to angle their mouths together for a kiss. Harry turned his head away, jaw clenching around a lock of muscle, even as arousal weaved sharp down his spine, coiled at the root of him. Harry wanted to think it was not his own. "What are you doing?" His voice sounded hoarse, strained to his own ears.
He kept looking up at Draco, getting distracted by him standing in front of the kitchen window with a mug held high in his hand, the other tucked under his other arm over his chest. The sun shone against his silhouette, shadowed around his back, the rest of it diverging into blurry, bright golden around him.
"You've changed a lot," Harry said, staring up at the expanse of the night sky. He understood a lot of the Malfoy he used to be, even if, in Malfoy's own words, it didn't justify or excuse his actions now. "You're still a git, but you're not… a
He snorted. "I mean, technically, I'd still be considered very homosexual if I had fancied someone as virile as that."
Here, in their deserted alcove, sitting there with their bags toppling onto each other next to them, he misses that with an almost sickening intensity. All he wants is to ease whatever grief has the boy he loves looking like this, all haunted and tired, his eyes red-rimmed now in a way it hadn't been when his face wasn't half-nestled into the middle of Draco's shirt, his body sprawled between his legs. Potter's fingers are curled loose at the base of his spine, gripping at him.
Career Day comes around. The parents enter the classroom, introduce themselves and talk about what they do for a living, and leave to the sound of the kids' applause with a smile.
Teddy turns out to like Draco well, by the end of the visit. Draco obliges to his every request for play in his scheme to get Teddy to like him, and ends up enjoying himself in the process — acting out Teddy's comically wild and theatrical scenarios, one involving Harry acting as a dragon, Draco as a pirate, and Teddy as the 'boss Auror' commanding his line of stuffed toys against Harry, even though Aurors did not really fight dragons. They stay the entire day, and make to leave after dinner until Teddy fusses and cries and throws a fit over seeing them at the fireplace. So they stay a while longer, until Teddy gets tired and falls asleep on Harry's shoulder.
Draco went silent. He spoke after a moment, when Harry had turned back to the canvas, brushing it up, leaning closer. "I see. He seemed… familiar." His voice was slow, cautious, and Harry suddenly wished he hadn't told him Sirius' name.
The drowsiness began to set in almost a minute later, making him all heavy and liquid into the mattress, like all the soreness and tension in his muscles and joints melted into it. The lights were too bright overhead, falling over the otherwise dim-looking, white room, and his brain was becoming very slow and fuzzy, but in a nice way.
Harry brought his camera along, and was taking a wide view of the entire room and everybody in it, all the golden fairy lights and a lovely Christmas tree — there, Draco with his mother, Andromeda and Molly, the four of them in a circle of conversation. There, George with Angelina and Luna and Teddy. Ginny had come up to him, which he only realised when he turned with the camera onto her face, her freckles magnified in the grainy, dim quality of the viewer.
"Right. Well," Harry said, looking down at the bag in his hand. He just wanted to go home, see Draco again, have dinner with him and kiss him before bed. "I suppose I should—"
Harry looked away too, wanting to ask, wanting to—but he didn't know how. He just didn't know how. His stomach was queasy, and a strange, inexplicable sort of dread was gnawing at his insides.
When he told him that maybe they didn't have to be in love to make this work. Like it wasn't entirely what Harry wanted to hear.
The train whistles, beginning to roll forward. It is a silent ride, for the most part, save for Lovegood and Longbottom's murmurs of conversation every now and then.
"I just… I don't feel right, that's all," Harry said, hand half in his hair, a tremulous and uncertain sort of laugh. "I don't know."
He hunched over low, a knuckle clasped into his hand, trying to ease the vice around his lungs. He looked over his shoulder, after a long moment, finally letting himself. There was the tangle of legs under the sheets. A wrist twisted under a cheek.
Draco does, a flick of a glance. "I know." He clears his throat, clears his voice. "But still. It should not have happened."
He goes with Hermione and Ron to a pub every weekend. They come in sometimes with a suggestion of somebody they know or the other, a co-worker, cousin of a friend, this one bloke they've heard a lot of good things about, trying to get him to move on without telling him that's what he has to do.
Harry made his way to one of the cabinets to get the plates out anyway, telling him and Hermione about his visit to Malfoy from the start.
"She needs a bit more time to really, truly forgive me." Harry pulls a bit at the muffin wrap, idly. "But I think we'll be alright."
Draco smirks slightly, threading their fingers together on his thigh. "I might like dancing with one clumsy oaf."
Jenny calls his name shyly, and Draco leans close so she can ask him a question that Harry misses, Scorpius still clinging to him.
He huffed out a derisive laugh. "Salazar, Potter. Don't tell me the Saviour of the Wizarding World is
His eyes were gritty and heavy, burning with fatigue, still locked tenderly onto Draco's sleeping face.
"It's not about that. I just… don't like mysteries." It was the truth, in a way, or not, depending on how it was seen. The wording was just ambiguous. Harry tried to uncover every mystery he came across because he hated not knowing, and he certainly hated not knowing right now. Even so, Harry knew he was being irrationally paranoid, but could he be blamed? Malfoy had never even liked him all these years.
Hermione paused at something over his shoulder. Harry turned to look, bemused, and found Malfoy standing in the doorway, his face pale and eyes bloodshot from a hangover, his hair damp from a shower.
Draco comes in fairly late. His lips are pressed together, but he is clearly nervous in the roomful of children, eyes everywhere, tugging at his collar with two fingers as he clears his throat.
Aside from these encounters with Malfoy, the nights and mornings, they opted to stay out of each other's way, and Harry was able to ignore Malfoy's presence in his house for a good while. He didn't know what Malfoy got up to when he wasn't here at Grimmauld Place, and he didn't entirely care to know either.
Draco turns around, then, walking down the streets where he came from. Potter's following gaze is burning on his back, twisting him inside and out.
In trying to find a place to breathe easy, he ends up at the empty Quidditch pitch, right in the middle of it, watching real stars high up in the sky. The world is quiet, but open in front of him, reminding him that he's free. He turns the wireless on in his hand, tunes it and changes stations until he can hear the grainy and soft singing of an old song, a woman's voice. He puts it next to his head.
He and Malfoy were made to sign a contract at her office, sitting together in adjacent chairs. The contract had several stipulations, among them being that:
Malfoy was flustered and speechless at his mishap. Harry held back the snort of laughter behind tight cheeks and lips, a restrained smile playing on his lips.
Harry smiles at her. He then looks to Ron. He seems to be trying to absorb this, staring ahead with a furrow of his brows.
Malfoy's mouth tightened slightly, a small puff of air through his nose. His eyes were fixated up at the ceiling. It made Harry feel stupid.
Here is the one thing that he can no longer bear to gain and lose, that can break him in ways he can't bring himself to imagine should it come to that, and it's either that he latches on to it now for a chance that might not work or give it up right then and there, because even now blinded by love and desperation and love there is the smallest corner of clarity somewhere in the back of his mind, that can sense that there is too much that is not right with this picture.
Harry stared at him, throat still burning. He squeezed his waist with an arm, nodded, small and slow at first, then quick and jerky. His eyes were beginning to burn again. It seemed to do that a lot these days. "Yeah. Yeah, we will."
He looked like one too, standing there like that; in his long black coat, the enamored tilt of his head. The grace of his shoulders, with his gloved hands in his coat pockets, and his face soothed with an almost-peace.
badly, Potter." He uncrossed his arms, pulled his silver ring out of his finger with one swift tug of a hand and then held it up, shining it in the light for Harry to see. "A fake proposal."
Draco splayed a palm all over his grinning face, making a face at him. Harry laughed, shaking it off himself. He entwined their hands together, settled the tangle of them on his own chest.
There is a long pause, some old hurt warring within perhaps. Then, finally, "I am willing if she is."
"I don't want him," he said to the room. Only the music coming from the drawing room, distant and echo-like, came back to him.
And then Potter appears, as if from behind a cloak falling off. He raises one hand, the other holding the now visible cloak to his abdomen. "Sorry. It's just me."
Mingling with it all was that burning throb in his chest again, the one that kept trying to force his hands and body into something imprudent and unwise, the one that had kept coming back over and over all throughout the day, that was now overwhelming his entire body with the urge that gnawed at him from his skin to his bone. The one he thought he could never give in to.
He found Draco in the bathroom, curled up against the wall, sweaty and tensed and trembling. His neck was taut with it, his breaths shaky and erratic. The bathroom smelled sick.
"Thanks," Harry says. Neville pushes himself off the doorframe, and then leaves. Harry goes into his own room, sits down by the bed on the floor.
They ducked into the first alley they could find when running through a moderate crowd of people, crashing against the brick walls together, panting and gasping.
Malfoy's eyes kept slipping shut, all droopy. It made him look softer, and Harry felt very tender and raw in his heart. He was thinking about his aunt saying,
. Draco slanted a small smile at him, kissed him chastely, quietly, in the midst of chatter and stolen attention.
This couldn't be what Malfoy brought him here for, just to use his name to get into a concert without a ticket? Right?
"I love you," Harry said, all out of nowhere. Draco paused, looking up at him. Harry suddenly wondered if the timing seemed off, or if it was the way he said it, if he shouldn't have said it now. He said it all the time anyway, hadn't thought it would seem so out of place.
Draco knew something had gone wrong with the alteration to be having this effect on him, though he didn't know how exactly - he knew this had happened because he was in love with Harry. He just didn't know that Harry knew the alteration had gone wrong - and Harry is afraid that Draco finding it out now would cause him to feel hurt and betrayed and doubtful of Harry's love in some way, and so it would make him sick again (because negative emotions between them affect Draco badly now)
"Did you eat?" Draco rasped, whilst they were laid together sideways, facing each other. Their legs were tangled together.
In the tub full of soapy water up to their middle, the two of them stripped of clothes, Draco was putting the shampoo bottle aside and leaning forward on his knees. He was digging into Harry's curls, lathering it thoroughly, his soapy hands careful and gentle as they rubbed across his scalp, massaged his head.
So, did... did Malfoy take all the people he hung out with to posh restaurants and hold doors open for them? Was that normal, somehow, for him? Maybe it was a pureblood thing…
Hermione straightened. "You should rest for now. We'll talk about it when you're feeling a bit better, okay?"
Ron had stepped up, shoulder fractionally in front of Harry's in some protective stance, which was somewhat confusing because hadn't Ron just implied he'd gotten over his grudge against Malfoy the other day? He supposed, even so, none of them really trusted the bloke.
"Nothing. I've just never taken you to be somebody that would miss out on classes just because you didn't feel like it."
Draco obliges her soft beckoning, rolling over to his elbow and placing his head on her lap. She bends down, folds an arm across the front of his shoulders and pulls back the side of his hair, kissing his head.
The next few days, Elias was coming in every day, looking for one book or the other, until he finally dropped the pretense and asked Harry out for dinner, and Harry said yes.
"I'm sorry," Harry said after, breathing heavy and slow, his brain feeling heavy and slow too. He swallowed hard, watching Malfoy step back, avert his head away just so. "Sorry. You had to
"Well then. Did you work them out?" he asks, a hint of something thin and wry quirking up at his lips, though not quite a smile. He looks up at Harry, looks a little like he's faintly bored of this conversation, but Harry knows by now that usually it means he's trying not to show something underneath the surface. "Or perhaps you need another two weeks of ignoring me to work them out some more?"
, it is. Such curses were used for exactly what it sounds like they would be used for, you know,  to force marriages without an escape, to force contact and interaction, and then to ensure neither party can leave or find other people. It never ended very well, you can imagine."
"In the gardens," Narcissa says. She smiles at him, sincere, touching his arm delicately. "I'm glad you're getting to see him again, Harry."
But his words faded, and his eyes were glazed, and Harry knew they couldn't go on. He held Draco tighter by the waist and took them back to the hotel room by the wrapped portkey in his pocket, where they spent the rest of the day in bed doing nothing spectacular and adventurous, ordering room service and watching TV on low. Harry was sitting up on the other side of a pillow, couldn't stop looking over at Draco drifting in and out, breathing a soft lilt of squeaky inhales and exhales. He had the back of a hand in the space between them, a loose curl of his fingers.
"Bill's on it," Hermione told him. "He demanded that he be put on the case. I think we just need to learn what kind of bond this is, and then work our way from there, you know?"
"No. God, I..." Harry says, huffs, a tremor, thick like a cold. "I haven't been happy without you in years." And maybe given a few more years, Harry would have learned. And Draco would have learned too. But they are here now, and they have waited and are still wanting and in love, and Harry would rather be happy with him than without. He entwines his hand with Draco's, pulls it to his own lap. "I'm not letting you go ever again."
"Salazar," Draco huffed, a little to himself. Then to Harry, "no, Potter, this must be the most unforgivable thing you've ever done, awakening me from my wonderful dreams of becoming a world-renowned potioneer winning his third ever award."
"Did you think," Draco said, still that quietly mocking voice. "that you would die too? No. Aren't you fortunate?"
At the fireplace, as the two of them were leaving, Narcissa said to Harry, "Will you take care of him? Will you make sure that he..."
"God," he says, out loud this time, breathing a laugh, uncertain if what he's feeling is him about to cry as well.
It was nearly five songs later that Harry lost himself in it, unaware of his own swaying and the subtle, rhythmic head movements and tapping fingers on the biceps of his crossed arms to the music until he caught Malfoy's eye, watching him with an unfathomable look in his sharp moonstone eyes, that didn't look as sharp at the moment, for whatever reason. He stilled, suddenly feeling flustered and awkward. One pale eyebrow cocked up as it roved over him, his lips curling up into that bloody smirk again.
It's about two weeks later, at a New Years' party in the Eighth Years Commons, that they finally speak again.
Luna was giving him further lessons on how to substitute wand movements with hand movements, but when Draco began to grow frustrated, she'd stopped him, made him sit down with her on the grassy embankment and take a break.
Hermione would come some weekends with entire tombs of books, searching for something and forcing Ron and Harry to read along with her, but by now, it was clear that there just wasn't much information about these things. She was always encouraging honesty and communication between the two of them, the only other thing there was to cope with their predicament.
The pristine snow coats the ground and the rooftops of cottages and shops in the Hogsmeade village. Holly wreaths hang on their doors. Christmas lights string along their walls in preparation for the upcoming occasion weeks from now. The skies are winter-grey above, holding a somber sort of beauty.
Draco settles in bed and casts the constellations spell. He watches the night swirl up into the ceiling. There's a memory, a voice murmuring,
Draco tenses up instantly against him, arms still at his sides, and Harry remembers Smith, and Theo at his bedside touching his shoulder, how Draco moved away from it even in his stillness, his gaze sunken and flat and fixated ahead. How Draco moves away from everybody's hands these days.
"Yes. I have a lot of them," Draco says. Harry's tracing a line of the Narcissus flowers covering over his Dark Mark.
Malfoy paused, his brows twitching, and then he deadpanned, "Didn't think I just wanted to hang out with you, did you?"
Thank you for reading! And thank you very much to everybody that took the time to share their thoughts and kind feedback 💙 it was fascinating and lovely to read through it
There, the grief lurched violently in his chest, and he broke off with a gasp. His hands had stilled, featherlight around Draco's narrow waist as he closed his eyes, pressed his lips together tightly, Draco's temple pushed onto his. His breaths shuddered, close-mouthed, trying to push back at the turmoil within himself. All the love and horrible grief and love.
They were quiet all the way until he took his coffee, grabbed one of his textbooks from the table and left.
"Why, because you were the Gryffindor in school?" Draco said, with a raised brow. "You don't think I could be the brave one?"
A blind jolt of terror woke Harry in the middle of the night. He blinked, rapid and hard through the grit of slumber in his eyes, trying to see. He breathed, trying to settle down his heart. There was no solid press of a back against his chest.
Potter doesn't come back the next day, or the day after. Whenever Draco sees him around, he's avoiding his gaze, focusing too much on his tasks, Weasley and Granger shooting him bemused and worried glances every now and then and attempting at humour to cheer him up.
He knew the way Draco looked, coming up to Harry when he was either bored or wanting it. He would always have this edge of a smirk at one corner of his mouth, stepping forward into his space, crowding him in, or pulling at Harry to crowd
"You're spending a lot of time with him these days," Ron says in the common room a bit later, more to the chess pieces than to Harry. "Malfoy."
"Yeah," Harry says. "And besides, the food's way better when it's fresh out of the kitchens. So I don't mind."
He and Draco haven't talked in days. Harry thought he would go to him when they were both feeling a bit calmer, though Harry doesn't think he's entirely calm about everything yet. There is still a lot that he needs to wrap his head around, and he thinks it might take him a lot longer to, but he hasn't talked to Draco since that night on the Astronomy Tower. The guilt sank in deeper the longer he ruminated over what he said, tried to understand better how Draco must be really feeling.
When he's calmer, Harry draws him carefully back onto the bed by the shoulders, climbs up next to him and takes him up into his arms. Draco's eyes still red-rimmed and of a bright sheen, but as soon as they're settled, he catches Harry's mouth with his own, head craned a little over his shoulder to reach him, the heavy kissing leading to Harry on his arms, head over Draco's and a hand on his face, and then Draco does laugh into his mouth, a bit tremulous. Harry stops to look down at him, nose and temple pushed over his, grinning, the two of them breathless and heady and smiling stupid.
When he reached the fruit bowl portrait, he found Malfoy sitting up underneath the portrait against the wall, one leg up and an arm hanging off his knee. He was staring at the ground, his gaze rooted to a spot, unaware of Harry's presence. He still looked as if he'd hardly slept last night, scarlet circles around his tired eyes that made something deep inside Harry's chest ache.
He doesn't plan to stay, but after Potter takes his token from him, he moves aside, silently inviting him inside the dorm to share breakfast. Draco halts, mouth opening for words of refusal. But Potter is looking at him in a way that looks as if he's trying not to look too hopeful, lips bitten back, and Draco is a fool too in love to deny him, so he enters inside the dorm, his steps hesitant and slow.
It's some red-headed boy with a yellow tie. Zacharias Smith, he recognizes after a rather long moment of looking at him, trying to place him. He hasn't been all too central to either of his lives.
There's a First Year sitting beside Draco, quiet and boring holes into the table as she fidgets restlessly with the tablecloth. Draco looks at the brunette little girl, seeming to finally notice her as he arches a pale eyebrow. He puts down his utensil and bends his head close to her, saying something to her. The girl looks at his face, still void of much expression, but for a shrug. Her lips break into a smile, and then a giggle, her hand raising to her mouth.
"Come on. I've been following the news. Just a few months ago you were saying you'd never marry somebody like him
"I'm sorry too," Harry says quietly, nearly breathless with the weight of his emotions. Draco looks up at him across the table, his face smoother than it was minutes ago. "I was selfish, wasn't I? You going through all that, and all I could…"
and a evil madman, how many died for him. Harry knew Malfoy would only tell him straight up and honestly what he deserved.
Draco's throat flexed, a hint of an apostrophe smile. He was tracing circles on Harry's chest, seeming almost shy. Harry couldn't help reaching for his hand. Draco looked up at him, watched him kiss the flat of his fingers, his face as when he was watching Harry kiss his mother's hand. He could read the emotions now, when he had the context, the missing layer of knowledge, how he felt about Harry. Draco was smiling, running them over his lips sweetly after the kisses.
Potter's skin was smooth there, in his Dreams, just as Draco's had been, the two of them forever unmarred by the terrible things that had happened here, and his pain and empathy is a violent and alive rush through the nerves of his body. Awakening.
It was confusing, overwhelming, exhausting. All of it. Trying to meet the curse's demands, each other's needs due to it. Trying to live a life, see the people he loved, especially on the days that one or both of them just didn't want to bother trying with sex, even to afford themselves time.
There is one thing, only, that comes to mind, that he never believed Potter would ever know, could never know. He tells himself it cannot possibly be that.
After that was a dance party, the wireless playing a song as Harry kneeled before Teddy, holding his hands and swaying them gently as he waddled along to it, brown eyes bright. Harry was smiling back at him. He was still thinking about Draco in the corner, the hint of crescent-moons in his cheeks.
Hermione held Harry's hand tighter, grounding in the midst of all the chaos and outrage, the battle for things to tide over in one side's own favour, in Harry's or Draco's, until an arrangement had been accepted, grudgingly so by the compromised. The drawing room was emptied out of all Ministry members, then, leaving the two families alone. Immediately, voices rose again.
Harry hums, and then grins. "You being a cheat and a sore loser every time I won against you in the Quidditch cup? No, I suppose not."
He helped them with breakfast the next morning and then watched the two of them standing at the floo, Ron grabbing Hermione's robes for her from the bedroom because she'd forgotten to bring it with her. She was late because she'd spent too long being engrossed in furious revision of her notes. Ron pulled it on her shoulders for her, Hermione's arms raising to let him, switching notes between her hands. She gave him a smile, a departing kiss to his cheek that he tried to return at the same time in a hurry, and then, with a wave and a
"I did," Harry insisted upon seeing the astonished expression, his chest growing heavy at Malfoy's incredulity. "We should do this again."
It's a certain thing that Potter says, something painfully familiar and echoing of his dreams. It's a certain thing he does, or a certain way that he looks at Draco and smiles at him. Even if they don't hold the same meaning, it's all the ways that he's never done before.
you would likely have resented me for all of it, for being a coward and not taking our only chance out, for keeping both of us stuck. And that didn't sound like a very appealing life for myself, of course. But I didn't want to choose something just because I was afraid, for once."
That night, Draco finds him at the Astronomy Tower again. Potter is sitting there in the corner, head in his hands. He raises his head only at the scuff of his feet.
"It's not working." Malfoy's voice sounded, still, like a breath, a whisper, but now strained and frantic. "It used to work, why isn't it working anymore
Draco stopped humming. His brows jumped, even with his eyes closed. He was settled between Harry's socked feet planted onto the settee, hand curled around the neck of the empty bottle they'd been sharing.
Afterwards, Harry recorded the room again, roving slowly upon every person there, and zoomed onto Draco, speaking to Molly, as he helped her clean up the table alongside Ron, caught Molly's full-bodied laughter, tapping Draco's cheek as he was turning to carry the dishes towards the kitchen.
After, the silence comes over them, sitting across each other on booths. The large panelled window of the coffee shop brings daylight in on them. The server comes with their orders and leaves.
"He already did," she says, coldly, and Draco goes silent, thinking of his thinnest, oldest scars beneath the others. There's something else there, the way she's eying him.
"Draco? Does it..." Harry stopped, swallowing hard. He rephrased the stupidly obvious question he was about to ask. "Where does it hurt?"
"He fucking obliviated me out of his mind, Hermione!" Harry snaps, whirling on her so that her arm lets go of him instantly, and then it's all quiet, and it's just him breathing heavy and hard, Hermione staring at him with bald shock. The words are out there now, in the air, and it has never felt so real, every image he has ever had since of seeing Draco again one day, only for him to look at Harry like he's just a stranger he never met. A stranger he never kissed, wrote unsent letters to. A stranger he never loved.
In the silence that follows after, comfortable and easy, they watch the bright yellow glints in the water, eating sweets together.  Harry's gaze keeps getting drawn to Draco, to the raise of his cheekbone, the sharp cant of his jaw, a small smile playing at his lips each time.
Hermione raised an eyebrow. "You're both in a similar situation. I think that gives you plenty to talk about."
Whatever he saw made his eyes soften. They fell down to Harry's lips, and then to his chin, and then somewhere down past him.
"You don't need to be a photographer for it," Luna said, when he trailed off, not knowing what else to say. She took his hand and smiled. "You can just use it for anything you find beautiful. Anything you'll want to remember and look back on later. It would be like keeping a piece of them with you."
Harry was somewhat taken aback. He had always thought Malfoy was the kind of person to be opposed to people like him. Bigoted and biased. His bisexuality was one of the biggest things he had hoped Malfoy would never find out about.
"I was just going to say that… you look good," Harry says, still smiling from their prior moment. Draco looks healthier, and happier. He looks lighter somehow in the way he held himself, like he's been taking good care.
Potter pauses, looking at him. The surprise seeps slowly into his face first, and then pleasantly so a moment later.
There was a certain kind of pause, a subtle flex of his throat, before he said, "She sends me letters. Yes."
He doesn't finish what he's trying to say, ending it on another rough, quick clearing of the throat. But in the dark of the room, Harry finds himself smiling a hushed smile to himself. He can't explain why the words settle warmer and sweeter in his chest when they're coming from Draco, but they do.
But then he thinks about the way Draco used to look at him, with all the love of decades of a dream, like he had that day he kissed him goodbye next to a hospital bed, and then all the time after they got together. He thinks about how he's loved him in ways Harry hasn't quite caught up to yet, sometimes wonders if he ever will now. And he thinks he understands. It's terrifying, to have somebody look at him like that, feel that way about him, but he understands why he left to keep himself safe.
Draco was moved back home that morning, spending most of the day tired and sleeping in his bed. Their bed. Harry held him close there too, the only thing he knew to do. The pillow that had always been between them was at their feet, bumping against Harry's ankle. Somewhere on the edge of sleep, he wondered if there was any space left anymore for all this distance between them.
"He — he just fucking erased me out of his mind, and I—" His voice shakes. "I know I shouldn't be angry at him, I know he's just doing what's best for him, but I— what am I supposed to do now? He forgot me, just like that. What am I going to do when I can't..."
That month, Harry's birthday came around. He skipped the dinner party planned for him at the Burrows, told everybody he couldn't make it, so everybody brought the dinner party to him, flooing into his house one after the other.
"Because I'm not happy here, Potter." Malfoy looked over at him in some desperate plea, perhaps in a plea for some understanding. "I can't be at peace until I get out. I can't… I can't do it. I can't finish this."
"Hm." Harry's lips quirk into a small smile, and he leans in slightly. "That's only for friends, Malfoy."
"Harry, um," Harry said. "You can...just call me by my name, really." They haven't talked much throughout the last two years, ever since the curse had happened, but Harry did find it rather strange for her to be addressing him so formally even now.
but his hands are beginning to tremble anyway, and he remembers a dim and grey cellar. He remembers Greyback and Rowle, hands on him, wands over him. He remembers things he doesn't know if he can ever speak of.
Harry sighs, and looks at her, the faded flickering blue of the film on her. She looks sad, rueful. “I know you meant well.”
Blaise runs a hand down his face, resting at his mouth, wild-eyed and ablaze where they set lower on him again. "if I got my hands on whoever this was, I'd fucking kill them," he grits out, a low, trembling rage.
, I mean it generously. He's going to get on top of the table, sing all the lyrics out drunkenly into an imaginary mic as he points at Hermione, while
In the silence that follows, Draco thinks of his dreams again, of waking up that day in a hospital bed. Some days are bad enough that it's hard to be sure, that he won't just wake up somewhere else again, somewhere better, somewhere worse.
But Harry has already told Draco to meet him at an alcove on the third floor. "Ah. No. It's fine. You two should go on to the Great Hall, get some proper food. It's just the meals, right? I spend the rest of my time with you lot anyway."
But once it was over and most of it had calmed, Draco pushed him away again, his breaths just a little short of steady, all hollow-eyed anger and exhaustion afterwards.
"Don't say his name." It comes out abrupt, the breathless plea out of him before he can stop himself. His eyes burn, a horrible, nauseating lurch through him that leaves its pain long after. "Please just don't..."
"I still love you, I do," she says. She sounds distressed, sort of breathless with it. "but I'm — I'm
He seemed particularly adamant, insistent. Malfoy's jaw was set. There was something in his gaze, a few shades off of some brimming emotion. On Harry's persistent silence, Malfoy closed his eyes, as if trying to summon patience and composure, and said, dangerously low, "Potter, for Salazar's
He came later, with a hand to Harry's shoulder as he settled on a chair beside him. He was sitting very close to him, kept his hand lingering on Harry, smiling in that slanted way he did, with one corner of his mouth quirked more than the other, saying, "Mr. Naborowski, what a pleasure to see you here."
"Do you know why your father was desperate enough to risk his life in order to escape the Aurors, Draco?" Narcissa asks softly.
"You were the one that—" Harry begins to say, and then sighs, giving up. He shakes his hair off his temples. "Alright. Fine."
"Neville says he thinks you sometimes have somebody else in bed with you," Luna says. Pauses. "Oh, I'm not sure if I was supposed to tell you that."
Harry wasn't allowed to tell him because to do so would base any further developments in their relationship on something artificial (the two of them would be /forced/ to get along under duress, which is hard to emotionally connect with, I imagine, so wouldn't work anyway)
Some people would not be happy to see Harry happy with Draco Malfoy, but there was a chance that others would be influenced by the sight of them happy together. For others, there would still be doubts. For some, should any hatred befall Draco further after this, it would likely be for a far different reason that would have nothing at all to do with Narcissa, or essentially, the Malfoys in general; jealousy. Either way, it might stave off at least some of the negativity surrounding them to have Harry publicly endorsing them.
"You're good with him," Harry said. Draco looked at him, visibly surprised by the compliment, flushing slightly.
A moment after, Draco steps back, hitching the strap of his bag higher over his shoulder. He makes to turn around and head for the train. Harry hauls him back into another kiss, the last one for a while, and then finally, really lets him go.
"I think I'm quite close," Draco was saying, busied and distracted. Harry watched him work, pouring vials into the cauldron, adding ingredients to it that Harry couldn't even name. "Should only be another few weeks now."
There was a pause, a flash of something in his eyes that evaporated almost just as it came, and then Malfoy was left with only an unfathomable look on his face, teeth at the inner edge of his lip slightly, and then a twist, a sort of curl, at one corner of his mouth, turning his head away. "No," he said, low.
How funny, he thinks, that he's spent months half-convinced he's moving on, only to run after Draco the first chance he gets.
Harry wasn't able to steer clear of Malfoy for all too long, but he tried anyway as much as he could, avoiding rooms he was in, going off somewhere outside as much and as long as he thought he could afford.
"I imagine that's better than the alternative," Draco says, carefully, throwing him a quick glance, a raised eyebrow.
The lady behind the counter was swiping his card. Harry was reaching at his back pocket to push in all his change and keys back, making sure nothing fell out, when he heard her say, "Is that him?"
Harry's eyes burned, and he blinked furiously as he reached for his face and touched his cheeks very softly, whispering, "I know. I know. I'm sorry. God, I'm so sorry—"
By the next second, Elias was on the floor, bewildered and blinking at him. Harry had sat upright, hands pushed back into the couch, panting heavy and hard as he stared down at him. For a good minute, he was muddled as to what had exactly happened. Then slowly, it followed, one understanding pulling along into another, clicking together
It almost went hushed under the whipping wind in his ears, breathed out thick into it. Draco was not looking at him, so lost he was in the view, that almost-peace and quiet awe for beauty.
"No," Draco said, his breaths shallow. He lifted his head, hand on Harry's shoulder, and he was swaying slightly. "No, it's fine, we can… we still have to…"
Draco's head is snapping up, sat on the edge of the bed, when Harry opens the door. He's breathing in a very controlled way, blinking a little fast.
isn't a word that really fits Draco Malfoy all too well, and it seems much too odd to call him that aloud. So he doesn't.
"You don't have to be," Draco says. He leans forward onto the parapet again. Harry, too, does that, hanging his head down between his shoulders. He doesn't look down below, hasn't been able to all through the school year. "But what are you going to do about it?"
"I—" Draco said, a very long time later, raspy like he was trying to speak through a dried throat. It fell off, again, for a moment, and then, "What is this? All these..."
There wasn't anything back, and again, Harry began to think that there wouldn't be anything back at all, until there was a small exhale, and a hand finally moved up, flexed over a shoulder and onto the pillow, and clasped his own, trembling and tight. Harry turned their hands over, keeping the strain off Draco's wrist.
Before Harry headed upstairs, he bent down from behind the couch and gave Hermione a goodnight kiss on the cheek, Ron a pat on the shoulder as he passed him by. He heard the faint murmurs start up from the drawing room as he was trudging half-way up the steps, but couldn't muster enough energy to care about it much.
"Yeah," Ron says, with a soft, fond huff. "Okay. I'll give it a go, if you want me to." Hermione smiles and kisses his freckled cheek, and he doesn't stop looking at her, tender, even when she turns away to face Harry and Ginny.
"I was the one that told Harry," Hermione tells Draco, one day, sitting in the kitchen. She and him, drinking tea together, and he never would have thought of this in school, the two of them here like this, being friends. "The truth of those dreams."
About a half an hour later was the dance party. A favourite song of theirs came on, and Ron pulled him up by the arm, Hermione by the hand, drummed on the coffee table to declare
There was that time Malfoy had hovered stiffly beside him some feet away, stood in front of a bookshelf. He'd been standing on the toes of his shoes, head tilted upward, eyes pointedly roving over the spines of the books as his fingers slid over them, the touch unbreaking. His lips had been moving, shaping around the title names as he read. Harry had moved aside to allow him to keep looking, leaning back slightly on the shelf behind him.
He was just on the verge of leaving, when he heard a voice behind him in the midst of low chatter, saying, "Harry?"
"Horrid," Draco says, a little low and raspy, another half-hearted huff. His face is still very close to his own, tilted down towards his lips. "I shouldn't have opened my eyes."
"You were, um… " Harry gestures vaguely, at a loss yet again. He swallows around the throb of his own erratic heart, the turmoil of his feelings that made him feel tender under his skin all over. "You were going to say something."
Malfoy bit the inside of his mouth for a moment, perhaps in hesitance or contemplation. He sighed, and then leaned forward. "Do you have any plans for tomorrow?"
"Ah, come on," Harry mutters, annoyed. He tugs at it, trying to unknot it completely and begin again. He can feel Draco's gaze burning on him. A flush of mortification runs up his cheeks. His desperate hurrying was only making him tardier, and suddenly it seems a lot more embarrassing that he doesn't know how to do something so simple than it has ever been.
His mother is frantic, hands all over his face and over his arms, her panicked breaths gasping and short as she screams for a house elf. Being on House Arrest and unable to cast a Patronus nowadays, there isn't much she can do to get him to St. Mungos when he stops the house-elves from Apparating him there.
Malfoy shrugged. "Never hurts to be well-dressed. I reckon you could use a lesson or two." He smirked in amusement, as if to take the edge off the barb.
His wand was out by the next second, and he lurched forward toward the man, ready to stride over and—
It took him another moment to actually tear himself away from there, but he did, finally going downstairs to get started on preparing dinner.
Harry wondered if he wanted something with her that he could never have here with Harry, "Did you want to marry her?"
Harry tries to shake his head, meet his eyes, but for some reason, finds that he can't, too quick to look away. "Just been a strange day."
When it passed, Harry's smile faded, turned a little rueful. He thumbed a line of a scar across Draco's waist, the ones he had always kept hidden behind glamours. Draco couldn't cast them anymore. "Not always," he said, quietly.
That being said, while the barebones and certain details of the fic (and a LOT of the first half of this chapter, embarrassingly) are similar to GfD, it has come to take an entirely different path by chapter two!
"Draco, fuck, I—" Harry's saying, touching his arms, stumbling in front of him. "I didn't know she was going to do that."
Draco doesn't say anything to that. Perhaps the worst thing is that he doesn't have enough in him to be angry all that much.
"Blaise Zabini." He then leaned in, murmuring to her so that others wouldn't hear. "I haven't got tickets. Sorry. But I've got Harry Potter with me—" Her eyes widened, glancing over at Harry with that awful, awed and starstruck expression he could never get used to. "And I imagine he doesn't need them. He loves the Colovaria, you know, but unfortunately, the tickets were sold out before he could get them. I'm sure you can do something about that? I mean, it's the least he deserves after everything, don't you think? Getting to see his favourite band here in the city, having a fun afternoon to himself with his good friend?"
Her face smoothed, mouth parting in an 'o', as if she understood, even though she might not have entirely understood why he was buying such an awfully expensive ring, the kind that would usually be purchased exclusively for proposals or weddings. "A present for him, then?"
It was still too small. Harry had a fierce urge to shove everything off the table, or to upend it completely. He huffed out a hard breath, plopping down in his chair, dropping his novel on top of Malfoy's stuff to satisfy a fraction of the petty, vengeful urge to irritate him.
people, who had to spend hours and hours gelling it up to get it to look right. Salazar, it made me so angry—"
Harry watched him, not being able to move or breathe or speak. The dread swelled up even more in his stomach, causing his heart to begin to speed. He could hear the hammering of it in his own ears, and he felt sick to his gut. His throat was burning.
"Fair point," Draco says. It's their side of the family, after all, who broke ties. But his mother is alone, stuck at the Manor, and Draco knows she will love having Andromeda back in her life. Even before, when they were children, she sometimes shared memories of his aunt with him. She is only afraid that her sister will reject her. "Will you come over for dinner?" Andromeda does accept the invitation, after some thought.
"Not pity," Harry murmured, shaking his head, tugging his face back to his own. "I've been wanting to do that for a while now." For all of today. For months, even if he always shook away the thought. He kissed him, once, Draco's head bobbing back from the force of it. He gave a flicker of a wavering smile. "Not being a
By the time the discussion came onto details of what would happen afterwards, the potion that had kept Harry aware had worn off again. His head was, once again, pounding and fuzzy, his vision blurry. There was noise, fragmented words again, several voices speaking at once in argument, dying down eventually before starting back up again
Malfoy had hardly raised his gaze from the ground the last couple of months, so this was a change. A good change, Harry supposed, but also a curious one.
"Ron's right, Harry," Hermione agreed, glancing up from the book. "He's just minding his own business, you know. I think we should extend him the same courtesy."
Harry didn't say much, but he remembered the last time he saw him on a broom, felt his heart pounding and his body flush against his back, and his arms painfully tight around Harry's waist. He remembered the heat of flames licking up all around them, how terrified he'd been.
For a moment, nothing is said. The glass of wine in Harry's system is just enough to make everything feel a little far away, a little bright and dim all at once. He's swathed in gold under the string of twinkling lights along a wall, catching in his silver eyes and his platinum hair, all over him, and Harry can't remember wanting to kiss somebody like this for a long time. The last time being when he was in the forest, missing Ginny—
There were also the isolated incidents, such as when Harry made the mistake of settling into the right side of the bed at night instead of the left, unsuspecting and unaware of what he'd brought on himself.
Not after having loved Ginny. Crushing on Cho. Imagining a future with a wife and children, craving it, dreaming of it in a lonely forest when he didn't believe he'll ever have it.
A few couples were swaying together at the open space by the piano, and there was a man sitting there at the stool, singing along to the soft melody playing to his fingers.
next to silly and exaggerated animations of a little doodle Harry’s mannerisms upon waking. They capture his sleepy frown, and the way he yawns and stretches his legs and back out while lying — things he’s never noticed of himself until now. He smiles down at it, scrubbing a hand through his hair, still sitting half-tangled amidst sheets.
"When did you and your wife get married? How did you two meet?" Dudley asked, always two questions at once. Harry didn't correct his assumption. He didn't think he could really be bothered to deal with whatever can of worms that would open.
Luna smiles, in that way she often does, hazy and small. There's a strand of her hair, brushing her cheek, dancing in the wind coming in from behind her.  "Okay," she says, just as quietly.
And there he learns of another one of these newfound weaknesses of his; that no matter how much he argued with himself over it in his already restless nights, he could only momentarily evade the feeling of being an absolute wanker for hurting a boy he's indebted to more than he can repay in a lifetime. A boy he'd dreamed of loving forever.
It's a long while after, when the movement of his chest steadies and his body finally relaxes slightly, that Potter speaks again.
He has a lot of questions. He'd tried getting them answered by searching through books in the Hogwarts Library, but there wasn't much information available beyond what he already knew. The subject of interest seems to have much to do with the mind. So, surely a Mind-Healer would know something about it.
"I told you, didn't I," Malfoy said, abrupt, teeth grinded. "I told you it could go wrong, but you just
"So you know, you can leave now. You don't have to stay here anymore. We could just…" Harry didn't finish the rest of the sentence. Still, Malfoy hummed a second or two after, like he understood, sounding noncommittal and somewhat half-asleep. He got rather sleepy after sex. Harry, on the other hand, got riveted up. "Yeah. Like every few days, maybe?"
Harry felt somewhat embarrassed, even as he knew that was true, that it was new, either of them taking any sort of interest in each other's lives.
"This is muggle music, you realize." Potter's transfixed on the stars, Draco on the lights in his eyes.
"But I do miss him," Draco said, quieter. The secret. "I know he wasn't a good man, or even the best father… but sometimes I think of being six, that time he read to me with all the voices… and I…"
Harry nods, tearing his gaze away from Draco, finally, to follow the movement of his own steps. He pulls his hand out as a shiver runs up his spine, flicks his wand again.
gone to school together for seven years, if you didn't notice," he says, as if that explains anything. "Come on. Eat with me."
Harry had gone a bit late, having gone back to the common room to change into some casual clothes and having had to talk Ron down until he begrudgingly calmed down. Hermione, ever the reasonable one, swore not to let him follow Harry.
When it's clear that he'll be following him right out the door, Draco whips around, Potter nearly running right into him.
There was silence. Harry didn't hear the sound of Malfoy leaving, as he was expecting. He knew that he was still standing there, but he didn't want to look up. He heard the pads of his bare feet a moment later, only it was coming closer.
"I found myself on the edge of their balcony, Harry." He's quiet, his voice nearly taken away by the wind. "And my friends... they saved me."
Harry pulls him closer instead, just so, burying his nose into his shoulder, inexplicably struck with the memory of him at seventeen in his home, small and hurt in his father's arms and telling a room full of people that hurt him that he did not know if Harry was Harry or not.
In the end, what it became was the profile of a fair face. A high cheekbone, the shadowed hollow under it, a faded blush across. There was the dusting of long lashes, framed around a silvery-grey eye, mellowed by an expression of drunken leisure, and the pupil pointed somewhere afar. There were the messy waves of white-blond hair, tucked behind an ear. A cupid-bow, rouge mouth. The slope of a lightly freckled nose.
Malfoy took out his wand and transfigured his current clothes into a proper suit. He left the hat unchanged.
"I don't know what I was thinking," Harry says, desperate, hands rubbing his eyes. "I don't… I don't know what the fuck is wrong with me."
somber, maybe. Black. Something much less mellow than shades between red and pink. He'd known his favourite colour was green and silver in school, all Slytherin pride.
"Mother," he said, seeming surprised. She stood, moving towards him, and let him kiss her cheek in greeting. "What brings you here so early?"
Draco asked him other things, though he always spoke a bit like he wasn't entirely interested. Harry chalked it down to just his way of speaking in general.
Draco's already guessed where that one could come from, having heard later on the disgusting truth of Umbridge's detentions. He's held that hand often, brushed a thumb over it.
"Shall we fall in love this time then?" Draco said, and looked him in the eyes, making it so clear how absurd he found the concept to be.
Malfoy's gaze was going far away again, like when he sat alone in corners or unpartnered in classes, glazed and distant, and he noticed again just how sunken in his eyes still were, and how pale and thin he still looked, and after all the laughter of the day, he remembered that it was going to be a long time before Malfoy would really be okay again.
Harry halts there, finally looking up at him. Draco’s eyes widen, terror travelling through him. He  has no idea what he must look like to Harry, a whirlwind of emotions reflecting on his face. He knows Scorpius sometimes ends up listening to Draco talking about Harry to Pansy, but he's still reeling frantically on,
Malfoy huffed, somewhat nervously. "Potter, I think you believe you want that about as much as I do."
Malfoy insisting to pay the bills like an old-fashioned man with a lover he was on a date with. Check.
It's two songs later that Potter dozes off, right there next to him, and Draco sees them from the eyes of the night sky, the image of Potter asleep stark in the middle of an enormous pitch, Draco not far behind. When his heart finally comes to a steady pace, the storm, the turmoil, of his body settles to calm, to a deep and aching tenderness in the spaces between his bones. His eyes fall shut to the stars, the sound of Potter's breathing soft and steady beside him.
Madam Aileen sits across from him, on the other side of her desk. Her arms are folded atop it, in a clinically attentive sort of posture. "It gives the user realistic and vivid dreams of all they desire, but leaves them severely comatose in the external world. Why do you ask?"
Their lives are not bright beyond imagination, or perfect, but they are full of love and laughter and warmth, all the same.
The fourth time it hit had Draco folding over, hands tight around the desk. He was gasping in pain, and Harry was already at his side, trying to pull him towards himself.
There was the tussle over who got to have the first shower in the morning. Harry's stance had been that he got to it first, and Malfoy took too long in there, and he had
"No you won't," Draco grits out, and then tries to get up, pushing onto his hands and feet. For Merlin's sake, he can't stand a repeat of St. Mungos again, confined to bed for hours on end. "I'm not staying here for bloody
His vision blurred, hands thick and uncooperative as he pushed an arm under Malfoy's waist, under his shirt rucking up, curled it around his lower back, hitching him in against him. He tucked Malfoy's head over his own shoulder.
"I know," Harry said, stepping forward, touching his arms. "I know. But… but your body and core need time to recover. Remember? You need to rest. Not push yourself around just yet."
And on he went for a good three minutes, in that haughty and frustrated tone he'd been using the entire time he was teaching Harry all the spells he needed to look 'presentable and not like your horrid barbaric self', brushing quick fingers through the front of Harry's hair in an attempt to straighten it enough before the spell could do the rest.
"But trying to force two thirteen years old to date with the prospect of marriage in mind? That's fucked up." Draco made a noise, sort of agreeable, sort of
"Right. Well." He cleared his throat. He let his hands fall to his sides, moving towards Harry. "Well, I will need you to do whatever you can, as much as you can, to show people that you are amicable and fond of Mother and
It was something to consider, for Harry, though he still doubted he was skilled enough to have them hung up on walls for the world to see. But the more he considered it, the more he found himself liking the idea.
Draco stared at him, still seemed to be breathing a bit high and shallow in his chest. He nodded. "Alright. Good. That is…"
"Yeah," Harry said, trying not to look like all he wanted in that moment, with a terrible desperation, was to kiss him, to have Draco kiss him back just the same way. "Okay."
Harry hums, agreeably. "Your mum's strong. I think she just needs you to keep in touch, is all. I'm sure that helps."
It was when he was setting the cutting board down on the counter that he heard a loud crash from upstairs, a chorus of several deafening thuds. It had Harry's heart shrivelling up, jumping up to his throat. By the next minute, he was running out of the kitchen and up the stairs two at a time, terror curdling in his gut.
Draco was speaking to his mother quietly. He couldn't hear what they were saying, but the movement of his lips were different, a hint of dimples appearing, disappearing. He could only hear the low accents of another language. Harry had a faint memory of him speaking to Beauxbaton boys in Fourth Year. He'd been oddly shy with them, speaking in stuttering French, not quite able to meet their eyes.
"It's okay if you like blokes, you know," Ron says. "If you felt...feel that way for... Malfoy. I was just angry because you hurt Gin, and you need to seriously make it up to her for that. But there is nothing in the world,
"Thank you," Harry murmured, the movement of it on Draco's lips, smiling into it. Draco huffed a small, amused laugh, took his face and kissed him again, heads bobbing together.
His eyes slipped shut again, and thoughts morphed into incoherent, blurred images. Waves of messy, white-blond hair. Bright bulb lights.
Nothing much was said after that. They drank from the same bottle of wine, passing it around between the three of them. Ron's arm was across the cushions of their new couch, long enough to run around Hermione, his fingers brushing over Harry's shoulder.
"Draco?" Harry said, kneeling down in front of him, where he'd fallen back against a tree. He had a hand on his elbow.
"Can we please be nice and let Mr. Malfoy finish what he was saying?" Harry says loudly from the corner, but nobody listens.
Malfoy threw an arm in an angry sort gesture at him as he walked away, the back of his pressed white shirt to him, bellowing back, "And I say, the feeling is mutual!"
Harry gets back together with Ginny after the NEWTs have come and gone, and breaks up with her three days later.
"Maybe it finally broke or something," Ron said, with a confused, nervous huff. "It's been in the family for ages, hasn't it?"
Harry gripped Malfoy's biceps, hitching him closer, off the cabinets. He was so cold. He grabbed his back, hooked the other arm under the sprawl of his legs, hoisting him up against him and in his arms.
Harry looked down. He touched a finger to his mug to check its temperature. It wasn't too hot. He took a sip.
It was sickening to look at, both of them in conflicting ways, and he had only a few seconds of black cloaks in masks and bloody running water in a bathroom before Malfoy had shoved him down onto the bed, hand flat on his chest as he climbed over on top of him, bending over him with his mouth at his neck and a hand beside his head.
"They hurt her, bad, with the Cruciatus Curse on repeat. Your aunt. Your father." Draco's chest tightens, his breaths high in his chest, trying to hold it steady. He knows his father had done terrible things, but to know he'd hurt a girl only as old as himself, just as Rowle and Greyback had
There isn't an explanation for what it is that comes over him, the painful and irrational need, the want, the tenderness to the point of raw—the way he feels all the joy and good and comfort of his life in a moment, all of his dreams now fitted inside of one ridiculous boy with unruly hair and mismatched socks.
"Luna once told me about karma. Did you know?" he spoke again, after a while. His voice had gone strained.
He doesn't think Draco does mind it. Even when he's smirking at his flustered demeanour, there's always a hint of something mellow about it. Even when his reactions are controlled about the things Harry does, about the way he can't stop touching him, he can now tell Draco likes it, because he always runs his fingers through his hair after every one of Harry's zealous, greeting kisses, under the pretense of fixing the front of his messy hair, and when Harry takes his hand, Draco is never the one to let go first. Harry hadn't thought Draco was the sort of person to like things like that, and certainly not one to tolerate sweaty hand-holding, but apparently he is.
"Do you remember Third Year here?" Harry asks, glancing over at Draco. His gloved hands are shoved into his pockets. "When those snowballs had started coming at you out of nowhere?"
Malfoy hummed, glancing away. He made a small, close-mouthed scoff in his chest, and then looked back at him again, grey eyes almost icy in its colour. "My, my, Potter." A corner of his mouth curled, something of a hollow smile, an almost-sneer. "To be a married man and to engage in such
Malfoy seemed a bit surprised at the mention of her. Harry wasn't sure if he should have brought her up, given that they seemed so close when she was still here. Most of the Slytherins seemed to have dropped off the face of the Earth these days.
Draco hasn't been sleeping well, certainly. He finds that he can't remember the last time he ate either, except for a vague memory of sitting at the Great Hall, staring down at his food that he can't remember if he ate any of or not. "Of course I have been sleeping and eating."
because Draco may have forgotten it all, but Harry will always remember that that was the way he hurt him, and that is the way Draco got to the point where he found it better to carve holes into his memory than to remember him, and that Harry would never have him back again after the way they ended. Would never get to tell him that he still loved him, wanted him back.
Harry looked at her, and then down where she was looking. The picture in his wallet, where it was still gripped in his hand, resting atop the counter. It was just a candid of Draco, laughing under the sunshine and wind tousling up his hair, unaware of the attention on him.
Malfoy dropped his spoon and grabbed him then, reaching out quickly and wrapping his cold, lithe fingers around Harry's wrist. His hairs stood on end at the skin-to-skin contact, perhaps due to the mild change in temperature.
Malfoy hummed, and then stopped too. And then his eyes flicked over to Harry, like he had just been caught red-handed with his hand in the cookie jar. His pale skin grew flushed around the neck and ears.
"Don't cry, Potter," Draco mumbled. His eyes were so sunken, scarlet under the white daylights through the window. "You don't look so good-looking when you do."
He wasn't lying. He walked by every painting in the gallery and stopped to stare at a few for very long minutes, his eyes roving up and down over them, as if taking in every detail.
"I'm sure the two of you won't mind being placed in the VIP section?" She smiled brightly, looking to Harry with an even brighter gaze. He nodded awkwardly, and then shook his head awkwardly when the phrasing registered in his mind.
Draco's first mandatory visit to the school's Mind-Healer's office is merely introduction, a series of personal questions building up into a whole life story that trails off at the events of the past year, at the war on the very Hogwarts they sit together in.
Draco was an awfully restless person who didn't like staying still, and so after a few days, he tired of being in bed so often and began to grow exasperated by Harry's insistence on rest, though he did soften by his clear anxiety.
"I just… I need a minute," Draco said, thick and tremulous. There was a smudge of blood under his nose, on the knuckles of his hand where he was pressing against it, and his breathing was heavy. Harry quickly got out a handkerchief and gave it to him, Draco's hand fumbling to take it, pressing it to his nose. He looked like he was in pain, a tense line between his brows.
twisting him around hard to face him. Malfoy's expression was pinched with annoyance and exasperation, as if Harry had no reason to be trying to run away after all this time of being kept in the dark about
Somebody else had gotten him a stack of novels. Hermione, he guessed, very easily. Somebody else had gotten him a set of glasses full of beautiful, intricate patterns and a bottle of wine. Somebody else had gotten him a nice, branded pair of shoes. A piece of wall art and decor. A fancy box of art supplies.
Harry had Colovaria songs vaguely playing in the back of his head, the rock tunes, the hard and fast riff raffs that had delighted Malfoy so much, and the memories of the day drifted across his thoughts. He kept thinking about Malfoy's lips against his cheek, and the tender half-grin and silver eyes just before, and his cold hand gripping his own in the alley.
Malfoy turned out to be correct in his presumption that the bond acted up sporadically. What they hadn't been able to feel the first time, the two of them asleep when it came in, was
Harry stared at him. Kept staring at him. He turned fully to him, with a step of each foot. "Did you not hear me? The curse could last
Hermione sometimes pointed out how sickly and thin and tired he looked, but mostly Harry supposed they were all just relieved at Malfoy's quietness and the lack of impertinence.
Draco eyes her for a moment, wondering what he did to deserve a friend like this. A smile quirks at one corner of his mouth, dwelling in the way his chest has loosened, how it feels just a bit lighter and calmer from carrying this secret around, somehow. He looks up at the sky, the clouds floating slowly above them. His magic swirls around his hand, curls the threads around hers, passing warmth and light between them.
Hermione had told him, which Harry hadn't understood the meaning of until now. The increased speed of the curse's flow, Xavier said, compensated for the great amount of loss in Harry's core, so the effects wouldn't be so drastically different for him than before.
Among the audience, Draco is standing there in the long distance between them, the most still thing in the chaos of the crowd, watching them with an unreadable expression.
"Hey, what about me?" Ginny said, bouncing excitedly on the couch. "Are you ever going to take me to see that grand Quidditch museum in Sweden?"
That evening, Draco came in whilst Harry was having a drink, and Harry, surprised, made space for him to sit beside him. Draco had the papers in his hand.
Outside of the heat of a fight, when clarity shone through the cloud, he could see himself playing a dangerous game with Malfoy's life, and the guilt would sink down and deep on him. He would tell himself he'd be better the next time, that he wouldn't get into it with Malfoy again.
He lifted one hand off of Harry's neck and put it light at his temple, eyes flicking up there, back down to his own. They seemed a little mellowed, glazed with inebriation in this light, almost as if in a sort of fondness. "Well. I think you'll do just fine, Harry," he said, softly.
