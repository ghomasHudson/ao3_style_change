For a moment, he stood there, listening, his mind blank of all thought, his face slack from enchantment as he indulged himself with her singing.
Chapter Eighteen: Seven Sirens of the Great Seas
Chapter Thirteen: Never
Narcissa shook her tear-streaked face. Her eyes were red but resolute. "No, we're not. Trust me."
"You look…" Voldemort began. "Vexed."
He didn't look at her though. He was squinting and smiling ahead at the purple lagoon where six languishing mermaids gossiped, arguing, antagonized, and talked over another with their angelic voices. He felt drunk with joy. To him, this was the pinnacle of his career in seeking immortality: Conversing and enjoying the company of real immortal beings. It was nearly giddy, thinking soon I will be one. But for now, he got to be in the company of goddesses and that was more than enough.
Hopeless, and convinced she was going to die, she wanted nothing more than to cry but found the spell used on her wouldn't let her. She was nothing more than a living statue, helpless silent, and doomed.
Ariel goose-honked when she laughed, holding her hand to her face with slight embarrassment as she kept on laughing and she looked so beautiful in that moment. He almost proposed to her then and there. When she looked back at him, she gave him a closed-lip smile of utter adoration. She then caressed the side of his face and breathed, "You're too sweet." Snape held her hand against his cheek and they laid there like that for a few heartbeats in content silence.
"Hello, everyone. I'm going to keep this short because, believe it or not, even sirens can't stand public speaking. Ha. Get it? Can't stand… 'cause they have…tails."
"Well," Attina said with a happy laugh as the witnesses broke out into overjoyed cheers, drowning out the eldest sister's voice as she tried to continue, "With this I now pronounce you two—"
He lobbed the flame protruding from his wand into the ceiling where it arched and exploded like a firecracker where the tendrils of light hung in the air and froze into the shape of a chandelier. His spell illuminated the entire cave like he created his very own sun and Ariel marveled, mouth open, at his work.
The dank, old wizard's bar with the sticky floors covered in hay and trace amounts of goat feces was, unsurprisingly, dead. With the exception of Harry, Ron, and Hermione of course who walked into the seedy establishment hours ago, providing that grubby bar with the welcoming sight of profits.
"Any special reason?"
"None that I am aware of, my lord."
What fresh bullshit is this? Snape asked himself as he got into the groveling line with Draco, Narcissa, and Bellatrix.
Ariel gave his cold, colorless hand a soft squeeze of forgiveness. "You can make it up to me by reading me a story."
Voldemort lost track of time. He didn't even realize Ariel had left the garden until Greyback had lost control of his bowels which was usually around this time that he found the task of torture tedious. When he idly glanced out into the garden to discover the small white round table was empty, he told Greyback, as the werewolf writhed in his own waste against the kitchen floor, "Today's your lucky day, Greyback." He planted his blood-speckled foot onto Greyback's throat and pressed down until he felt the man's Adam's Apple flatten under his weight. "I've decided not to kill you. Better yet, I've decided not to tell Ariel of the horrible things you said about her."
Chapter Three: Sleepless Night Part Two
She looked at the back of her hand where a thin, shallow cut the width and length of a stray cat hair remained. "Fine."
He made her breakfast or lunch depending on the time (with magic of course); he would charm the dishes to clean themselves, make them tea, and ask about her week and her sisters ("I love Arista but she kills every single one of her lovers then complains about being lonely all the time. Like, sissy, you wouldn't be lonely if you just kept three of them alive!" "Some people just can't be helped."); then they'd talk until dinner or until Severus came back from work and then he'd shower her with last-minute affections, tease Severus for being her husband and leave without hurting anybody.
“No,” he replied simply. “It went…well, it went pretty good actually.” He waved at the carnage and said, with a dismissive laugh, “This is just how meetings usually go for me.”
He looked at the sketch then back at Ariel, giving her a toothy-lipless smile that made her insides clench.
"Legilimency isn't as simple as reading minds. It's—"
"It's a habit," he said. "I was taught it's rude to call adults by their first name. And since you don't have a surname, I thought Lady Ariel was the only proper way to address you."
Ariel tapped her cup into his. “To life.”
She galloped away from the lake, screaming.
Voldemort wasn't much of a singer but thankfully with Ariel's voice, he could sing a Hungarian Horntail into letting him ride its back, literally.
"And if I said 'ghosts', you'd say…?"
"Told you it's not that hard to break out of Azkaban," Ariel said with a bratty smile as she laced her fingers with Lucius's and reached for Bellatrix's hand.
"Lord Fuckface," said Adriana.
"I will never understand how anybody can find cleaning without magic peaceful," said Voldemort to Ariel. "But he insisted."
Narcissa didn't reply. She merely watched the unlikely pair as they continued to talk like old friends while the beginning of the idea formed in the back of her head.
Draco gave her a devious smile. "Got any more stories?"
"Can I ask you something?"
"It doesn't look like an old house at all," Ariel replied, turning her head towards the grand mansion which stood so sharp, tall and proud against the cloudy sky it looked like it was turning its nose at the heavens itself. Then she turned her head to Narcissa and said, "I would love a tour sometime."
Harry ground his teeth, once again wishing he were anywhere else, or at least that he knew when to keep his mouth shut. “It was addressed to the Cupboard Under the Stairs,” he mumbled, looking down at his fidgeting hand on his mug, tracing the edge of the porcelain. When he looked back up, Ron and Hermione both wore identical expressions of horror.
“For now.”
“Yeah, for a bit,” Harry winced.
“Something in the air vents,” Harry said. “Nearly knocked us all out.”
Draco had surprised Harry with a date last week, to the most
Malfoy slowly lifted his wand from his pocket, holding it in a loose, easy grip as he aimed at Harry’s head. Harry tried not to flinch, unsuccessfully. He had never been this close to Malfoy without them hurting each other—what else could he expect?
The chords of
His thoughts drifted to his current patient. He’d never before worked on someone he knew personally, and it was frustrating, that he had to realign his own memories of his and Harry’s interactions with what he’d seen from Harry’s own perspective.

After a few moments, Harry opened his eyes, and gave Draco a look of such resignation and defeat that it was shocking.
“I think that maybe,” Draco said, aiming for flippant haughtiness but landing somewhere much closer to sincerity, “we’re just right.” He buried his nose into Harry’s hair, smelling
Harry’s muscles ached. He realized that as his core worked overtime carrying the magic of the earth, his body had to work twice as hard to carry his own weight. By the end of July, his shirts felt a little tighter around the shoulders, his jeans snug around his thighs.
“Any questions so far?” Draco offers. Harry thinks for a moment before writing.

“Thank you, Timsy,” Draco said fondly as he slipped it on, enjoying its warmth. The elf walked away, muttering under his breath, something about “Master has too many clothes, he is never knowing where anything is, never learning, he is filling the whole house…”
“We don’t know. We think he’s been cursed. But he’s been on holiday for a week, so we don’t know who did it or what it was.” Weasley’s Auror voice was coming out, ready to debrief a crime.

Draco grabbed a pinch of floo powder from the pouch, threw it into the fire, and stepped into the green flames, quietly calling out the name of his home: “Silver Hawthorn Residence.”

but they both knew he wouldn’t. He felt his cheeks heating.
There was a creek, in the vast, dense woods behind Malfoy Manor. Draco used to play in it, as a child, catching frogs and scaring the squirrels and looking for fairies. He’d roll his trousers up to his knees and stand barefoot in the cold, shallow water, watching it distort his pale skin as it rushed past him.
actually, and I know you’re only trying to drown yourself in it to avoid something.”
“I’m here,” Harry said.
“You poor thing, how I’ve failed you.” Harry’s hands slid lower, fingers catching on the tied drawstring of the joggers. “I suppose I’ll just have to work twice as hard to fulfill that promise.”
“Er… which one?”
“Sir, you need to let go now—”
“Well, then depriving you of it now would be a crime. Put it on, go on then, track eight.” He flapped his hand at Harry with faux impatience. They had time for one more song, before they had to get back to work. “Then sit back and relax. Appreciate the
“Yes, someone cursed him, but it was quite bizarre, I was unable to figure out a motive… Might have been a fan that lost the plot. The person was… indecipherable. I could not make out a single defining feature at all, it was charm work like I’ve never seen.” Draco paused, unsure how much of this memory Potter was willing to share with his friends. He decided to skip the morose parts for now.
Draco pulled away reluctantly, his hand rising to Harry’s cheek. Harry opened his eyes to see Draco staring at his hair, brushing a curl out of his face, his expression shockingly open and admiring. Harry watched a few snowflakes land on his blond lashes.
“Most assuredly,” Narcissa replied, her smirk widening into a full smile as she took his arm. “I’m sorry to have surprised you like that, I must have lost track of time.”
“I know,” Harry croaked. He pulled Draco in and wrapped his arms over his shoulders, pressing Draco’s face into his neck. Draco trembled violently in his hold. “I’ll find her, Draco.” He caught himself, and quickly corrected it. “We’ll find her. I promise.”
"No—"
He couldn’t believe it. Like Draco had said, she wouldn’t miss tea on Sunday. Harry knew she loved Draco more than anything—he’d felt probably a fraction of it, last night.
“You don’t know me,” Harry snarled, in a low, painfully familiar voice. Then his eyes widened, and Draco closed his eyes against the obvious lie, letting out a shaky exhale.
Harry leapt up and ran towards the door, hearing the quick footsteps of Parkinson and Timsy behind him. He yanked at the door, but it was locked.
It wasn’t until ten days into the month that he realized exactly what he was counting down to.

It held everything Draco had written, everything Harry had already seen, and none of Harry’s own writing. As expected. He put it back, wondering what Draco would do with it now.
Harry stared at him in shock for several moments until Malfoy apparently felt it, and glanced up at them. This time, Malfoy could not suppress his eye roll as he clicked his tongue, clearly annoyed. “What now?”
And then he had to go and get cursed and Obliviated, the day before coming into work.
Harry scoffed as he recognized the top half of his lightning bolt scar, and Draco started to laugh.
Draco let out a shout as his core was attacked again, it felt like a hippogriff was digging through his torso, pulling and ripping with its sharp beak, like it was trying to tear something out of him—
“You’ve never missed a single day of observations, in ten years,” Kramer mused, turning to look at him. He raised his eyebrows, smiling a little, as if impressed.
Harry raised his eyebrows, his pen moving quickly across the page.
Not trusting himself to speak, Harry could only nod. So Malfoy led him down to the beach, where they walked unhurried along the shore, basking in the scant warmth of the morning sun on their faces. And Malfoy talked, to Harry’s delight, about anything and everything.
Harry huffed a laugh at Draco’s shocked expression as the Patronus dissipated, looking back down at him with one eyebrow raised.
The curse was painless, yes, but he really did need it fixed, ASAP. He couldn’t work without a voice, and though he could do quite a bit of nonverbal magic, he wasn’t able to use the full strength of it without incantations. Kingsley needed him for endorsements, too, and the anniversary of the Battle was coming up, Harry was always forced to go to the Ministry Memorial event and make a stupid speech. So the Healers had insisted that it was a job for the Specialist in Mind Curses and Afflictions, who worked privately, and whom Ron had set out to recruit that morning while Harry slept, apparently.

Malfoy glared at them both a moment more, then turned away to put the kettle on. Harry internally claimed victory, and unclasped his heavy Unspeakable cloak.

here. My friends call me Big D.”
“That’s six.
“Now, why do you think that one was so important?” Draco asked. Harry shrugged, looking just as confused as Draco was. It probably wasn’t the first or the last time he’d argued with McGonagall. Draco closed his eyes and set his clever brain to work, idly twisting a lock of his hair in his fingers. That short, dismissive conversation had shaped Harry in some way, had changed the course of his life, affected his future…?
“Do I?”
eager. “We can listen to it while we eat, if you want.”
“Merlin, I don’t know how they do it, Draco,” Pansy said, exasperated. “I just pay for the premium telly package, and Camila turns it on and presses the buttons and finds it, every Saturday morning. I think she even records it, to watch later, because of the time difference. No idea how she does it.”
Draco tried to press his mouth closed, to resist it, but he was only a mere passenger.
“We’re getting good at this. Shall we do one more, before our break?”
There were heavy bags under his eyes, but he wasn’t covered with dirt or sweat or blood, as one would expect of an Auror that looked this harried and claimed he “didn’t have time to change”, so Draco couldn’t really tell what his problem was. He’d have to wait for the inconsiderate, bumbling, surprisingly-muscled Gryffindor to actually explain himself.
“Well, it’s a little over halfway finished, which is great progress, considering this is only week three,” Draco observed, shifting the mood. He put his chalk down, and walked back towards the wingback chairs.
Ron had seen him work a couple of times, when they’d run into each other on assignments, but Harry never got to
“I want to be around you,” he answered, his voice just above a whisper. “All the bloody time.”
He could have sat and stared at it for hours, retreating into his numbness and reverie, but that wasn’t why he was here.
She was eyeing him with her signature shrewd look, analyzing his face, which Harry was sure did not hold a comfortable expression at the moment.
His eyes snapped open and he saw the stone of the floor against his face, the dimness of the large, windowless room he did not recognize. Then he saw the bars, cold, hard iron, separating him from the rest of the room. Panic shot through him as he launched himself into a sitting position, then hissed at the wave of nausea and dizziness that rolled through him. His muscles weren’t moving like they should—he felt heavy, lethargic, like his body was taking much too long to catch up with his brain.
And what else?

With a movement like an exhale of air, Timsy exited Harry’s head, and lowered the wand. Harry slowly blinked himself back to the room around him, where his fellow Aurors were staring at them in complete bewilderment. Parkinson’s slender hand held on to his shoulder; she quickly dropped it as he came to full awareness. Timsy’s thin mouth was frowning in concentration.
“Do you have any idea who—or what—that was?”
Harry waited until the church went dark, its only lights that of the ornate, gilded spire, the Christ Triumphant illuminated at its peak.
Harry looked at him curiously, and started writing again.
“I may have…” Harry huffed, regret making him feel heavier than ever, “...attacked him.”
there in order to remember it,” Harry replied, eyes dancing with amusement. The sunlight was settling into an early evening gold, the shadows of the trees around them elongating with every passing minute. “Besides, I’d prefer to spend my time differently, today.”
“I thought you hated me,” he mumbled.
Layers upon layers of iridescent strands of pure energy and emotion, shifting and swirling and growing in front of Draco’s eyes, filling his vision. He wished Harry could see it, how utterly awe-inspiring the essence of him was. Draco sighed contentedly, enjoying the faint scents of treacle tart and thunderstorms.
“Narcissa and I,” Harry clarified, to a scathing raised eyebrow. “Merlin, Draco, I swear she tried to suffocate me anytime I dared entertain the

Lucius growled, pointing his wand at Boran, who flinched, curling into himself. Draco was suddenly reminded of Harry’s Uncle Vernon, and he’d never wanted to kill his father more than in that moment. “You will keep your mouth
Draco sighed as the beat kicked in, Hill’s angelic voice reverberating around the room and his head.
Harry sagged with mixed relief and dread. He could tell that if the situation were less dire, Timsy would be rolling his eyes at Draco’s thoughts. “Thank you, Timsy,” he said, as Timsy opened his eyes and handed back the holly wand.
“Anyway. It’s in your head, probably hidden somewhere in your mind or your memories, which is where I come in. The numbers here show a small potential that you’ve been Obliviated, but certainly nothing major or dangerous to recover. As you know, I use Legilimency, to find curses or diseases that may be hidden in someone’s mind, or to guide someone through countering a mind curse on their own, or in the most dire circumstances, helping someone learn to cope with afflictions or curses of the mind that do not yet have a cure.”
Harry rolled his eyes, his blush only increasing as he stepped closer. Draco took Harry’s other hand in his, holding it up a little out to the side, and carefully placed his right hand on Harry’s waist, feeling his own cheeks heat up. Why was he doing this?
Third, his rational brain kicked in.
Draco soon saw the thick, bowed tree he thought of as “the meeting place,” and began whistling a little tune. It was Celestina Warbeck’s
Yes, there was no doubt about it, something had gone unnoticed by the Healers. He was definitely hallucinating, or something, because there was no way
“Coffee, Harry,” Draco called, and Harry skidded as he turned and jogged back to the kitchen. He grabbed his coffee, and, since he was there, kissed Draco one more time.
“Bet he did,” Draco scoffed, feeling extremely drunk and terribly sad for this small probably-human. “He’s quite fond of lies.”
And what else? Draco looked terribly ill, his skin clammy and sweaty, his hands shaking. Harry felt like a monster, fighting back a wave of guilt and nausea. For a second, he wished Hermione was there. She’d probably know what to do. And then she would scold Draco until everyone within a five kilometer radius of here felt ashamed of themselves.
“Was it common for people to make conversation with you, there? Were you friends with any of the regulars or staff? Could this person have been chatting you up for a while, maybe under a disguise, until they were close enough to be able to slip potions into your drinks with you unawares?”
Harry looked back at Draco’s sleeping form next to him, at their hands intertwined between them, memorizing the way Draco’s hand looked against his.
The question went ignored. The figure simply continued watching him, which Draco felt was fair. The answer was quite obvious, they were in a
“Come on. Surrogacy…?” Draco raised an eyebrow, vaguely motioning with his hand. Harry’s face didn’t change, and Draco couldn’t decide if he was surprised about this or not.
Draco searched Harry’s face, but he didn’t move to communicate—he just sat there, staring at Draco with knowing green eyes. Draco pointed his wand at the board, labeled a new dot “First Unforgivable”, and moved on.
with Draco’s pinky casually hooked with his, with Draco’s sharp smile and softened gaze, between bouts of grief and suspicion.
“Oh, Merlin,” Ron breathed, his face red from suppressing his laughter. “Tea, yes, I think we need tea.” He made his way toward the kitchen, and Draco, unsure of what else to do, followed him, still wearing his transfigured fuzzy slippers. It would feel wrong to change them back now.
“Sorry, Hannah.” He turned his gaze to Harry, then Narcissa, and back.
It was of Harry, floating above a violent sea, surrounded by dark, treacherous storm clouds. Silver forked lightning interrupted the darkness, framing Harry’s form. His wand was stretched in the air above him, his hair wild about his determined face. And reaching down from the tempestuous sky, wearing a blue dress and surrounded by fiery light, was Narcissa.
Malfoy insisted.
Malfoy huffed. “Yes, yes, I was a prick, karma’s a bitch, and now I have to wear reading glasses at age twenty-five. Anything else we need to get out of the way before I can start working?” He asked, exasperated.
“Boring,” she sighed. “I have a boombox in my attic somewhere—never liked it as much as the vinyls. I’ll bring it over whenever I find it.”
Timsy immediately popped into the room, with two steaming mugs of hot chocolate topped with homemade marshmallows, Draco would never get over his speed and efficiency. But his big, round eyes landed on Draco, recognizing a(nother) Veritaserum overdose, and he turned quite a menacing glare on Auror Potter.
Draco handed Harry a carrot, just as Hera’s head poked around the side of a tree, stepping fully into the small clearing. She headed straight for Harry first, this time, making both of them laugh as Bubo swooped down, landing gracefully on Draco’s arm. Obligingly scratching behind Hera’s ear, Harry felt himself truly relax for the first time since Draco had healed him.
Draco pressed his lips together as Harry wove his hair; over, then under, over, then under.
He looked up at Harry, who was just staring at him, eyes wide, jaw clenched tight. His hands were held tensely out in front of him, as if he had wanted to grab Draco, but decided against it halfway through.
“You can trust that Harry knows I had absolutely nothing to do with it, which he learned during our first week, when I realized the suspicion the situation would place upon me. He questioned me under Veritaserum.”
out of Harry’s path as he advanced on the Minister.
“It’s alright,” he repeated, unsure of what he was trying to console. “I’m going to steer us around, hang on.” He focused, imagining what he was looking for. He found a similar image quickly, and latched on, commanding his wand to find
“I don’t lie,” he said. “I won’t hurt you. ‘M moving to the wall.”
, and the duvet was heavy and warm, and the beat of Draco’s heart against his hand so soothing…
, but Pansy was right. He couldn’t keep this up much longer.
This may have been the most obscure prophecy he’d ever heard of; he could have written something like this in Divination and received perfect marks for it. There was so much that his father had never had—like real friends, for instance, or a loving relationship with his family—just a few examples. But the wording could mean something different, it could mean ‘taking what his father never had
“Kingsley…” Harry began, swimming through the onslaught of memories, connecting the many dots.
“Both of you need to mind your own business,” Harry retorted, his cheeks pink, his hand left stubbornly on Draco’s leg. He picked up the scroll of parchment he’d been reading—it was upside down.
“You need this, too, you know,” Draco muttered, but he wiped his face anyway. Harry blinked, bringing his free hand to his face and feeling the wetness there. He seemed surprised by it—Draco knew the feeling. He handed the handkerchief back to Harry, who wiped his own face and awkwardly tried to hand it back to Draco. Draco’s lips quirked in quiet amusement.
Harry’s eyes were as wide as saucers. Draco shook his head in disbelief.
“Why was he angry the first time?” Hermione asked, nonchalantly taking a sip of her tea, and this was starting to feel more like an interrogation.
Draco swallowed, his arms tightening around Harry’s waist.
“Yep,” Ron replied, crossing his arms and relaxing his posture, readying himself for a long watch.
Pansy was finally quiet, winded from her rant, eyes wide with fear and concern, which quickly morphed back into anger when the last track came on. She turned her fiery glare on the boombox.
. Harry stared and let it flay him, strip him down to something raw and tender. He had kept himself going, all this time, with only the memory of Draco: his long, messy plait, his favourite blue cable knit jumper, the perpetual indigo ink stains on his elegant fingers. But Harry’s memory could only capture the cool grey of his eyes, not the way his gaze shot through Harry like lightning, igniting him. He could recall the weight and solidity of Draco’s body, but he couldn’t feel the warmth, or the security that came with Draco’s limbs wrapped around him.
“Potter.”
in exactly the same tone Draco used when complaining about the nitwits he worked with at the Ministry.
Harry got lucky with the weather. Well—lucky for someone who wanted to get struck by lightning.
Harry sat down in the chair in front of the desk, eyeing him. He was paunchy and balding, with several visible scars on his face and hands. He looked like someone who couldn’t be messed with. The Warden surveyed him, too—Harry didn’t want to think about what he looked like, right now, but he probably gave off the same violent energy.

Draco lazily traced the lines of Harry’s palm, holding it close, intertwining their fingers. Harry had never felt so adored as he did in the moments before sleep claimed Draco, with Draco’s affectionate, uninhibited touches, his kisses landing like moonlight on Harry’s skin. Harry was the one holding him, but he felt
“I don’t know. They never wore badges around me.”
Memorize, memorize, memorize.
“Yes, Master Draco,” Timsy replied as he slipped back into the sitting room. Draco smiled faintly as he heard the muttering about “Master is never learning to be sleeping when he is supposed to, never learns.”
Weasley asked, clearly affronted.
He carefully lifted the Pensieve from its plinth and sent it floating back towards Potter. Potter stood as Draco returned, and continued watching him warily.
“Oh!” Draco said, laughing at himself. “I was so excited for tikka, I forgot.” He set down his food, which was nearly half gone already, and carefully pulled the record out of its sleeve, placing it on the turntable and lifting the arm to the outer edge.
No response. Harry’s worry intensified. He moved in front of him, pulling the cloak tighter over Malfoy’s shoulders, and knelt down in the snow at his feet.
The wind and sun was invigorating against Draco’s face. He felt like a part of the air, swerving and diving and drifting with the currents. It was exhilarating, competing against Harry again, even casually, in the way they both loved best. By the joyful, carefree look on Harry’s face, and the way he kept careful watch on Draco in the air, eyes alight with competition, he was feeling the same, and Draco didn’t want it to end. He wanted to stay up there, where he and Harry were friends who loved flying together, but eventually Harry caught the Snitch for the second time, effectively winning and ending their little contest, and they made their way to the ground.

“Malfoy—Draco—was your Healer? A Healer Legilimens?” Susan Bones spoke up, facing Harry, removing her Auror cloak. Harry nodded at her.
Draco quickly sat up, looking around, finding that the cloud of Lucius’ magic was advancing on them steadily, silently. He tried to stand, but his legs crumbled beneath him, completely drained. He instead flung himself on top of Harry, just as another loud

He checked into an inn and didn’t leave his bed for days. He ordered room service and wasn’t surprised when the delivery boy hurried away without collecting a tip. Harry didn’t want to know what he looked like.

Harry’s mind stopped for a moment, then everything flew past Draco’s presence in a

Harry thought. His contract wouldn’t allow him to answer, but he wouldn’t have been able to get the words past the tightness in his throat, anyway. Draco simply stared at him, but it wasn’t expectant—he knew Harry wouldn’t answer.
Harry closed his eyes, gripped Narcissa’s frail body a little tighter in his arms, and apparated.
Harry’s pen scrawled quickly across the page.
“Don’t look at me like that, Harry, you know he was right.” Ron glared at him, and Hermione sat back in her chair, folding her hands in her lap.
The heavy, thick smog of London nearly made Draco gag after so much time in the fresh, natural air at home. It didn’t help that he had to apparate into a dank alleyway, next to some overflowing dumpsters and the dinky red telephone booth that marked the visitor’s entrance to the Ministry.
Harry is nearly bowled over by the strength of emotion in his chest, as the door to the Burrow swings shut behind him with a soft
Draco’s breath caught in his throat, and he cleared it awkwardly, feeling his cheeks heat. He knew Harry had adored Professor Lupin. This was quite a compliment.
“Now, Smith.”
After a moment, Ron cleared his throat softly. “Well, someone had to,” he mumbled, and Harry snapped his head up, ready to fight again.
. “Our next step is to figure out what the hell she was studying.” Harry’s finger scanned along the shelf, finding another clean leather spine:
“No.”
“Morning,” Harry said, because Malfoy wouldn’t. Malfoy huffed, shaking his head, and crossed the garden to where Harry stood.
He swallowed around the lump in his throat. Sometimes, he wished he was alone.
and I am a better man because of it, better than you will ever be,” Draco’s voice was rising, and Lucius only chuckled patronisingly at his hysterics, but he continued anyway, trying to make his father see any scrap of sense.
“Does it feel like that, to you?” Draco asked, curious. Harry’s face was flaming with a blush, his eyes still wide with surprise, and it was so stupidly endearing that Draco could feel his own cheeks heating, as well. Harry simply coughed gently into his fist, and shook his head.
“About what?” Harry rasped, trying to keep his eyes open, melting under Draco’s unexpected but entirely welcome touch.
Harry said nothing, his jaw clenched with all the words he was desperate to release. Draco lifted his hand to Harry’s cheek, and it felt like whiplash, the softest touch delivering the sharpest words.
Draco stood as well, still subtly clutching his torso.
“This is why I sent the Minister, and not myself,” Harry whispered, after a long, suspended moment. “I didn’t know how to be around you without hurting you.”
Draco was still staring at him, his worried expression melting into one of thoughtfulness.
“Draco, if the Unspeakables were behind this, Harry would have found a way to tell us,” Ron cut him off. Harry swallowed back bile. “He’s fond of your mother, you know. She did save his life, and all. And he’s somehow fond of
Harry smiled in greeting to the three of them, but his face fell immediately upon taking in their silent expressions—Ron and Hermione with shock and maybe concern, and Draco looking ill, defensive, and in pain, and also wearing green, fuzzy slippers.
Draco, right now.
Harry began his new assignment immediately, by bringing Ron a sandwich from the canteen.
“Do it right,” he said. Harry huffed a laugh and raised the wand to the sky.
Harry scoffed, and turned his body, swiftly throwing his leg over Draco’s to straddle his lap, looking him square in the eye.
It took almost the whole day to reach the middle of Harry’s pentagram. The stormy sky had grown denser and more threatening with the night, throwing the world into pitch black darkness, the only light that of the few bulbs on Willem’s boat.
Now, Draco couldn’t help but scoff. Lucius’ head snapped towards him, and suddenly a wand was pointed at him, the shadow of Lucius’ mouth moving silently.
etc etc. Let me know!
He wanted to know what Draco wrote about, what he dreamed about; he wanted to know everything about him. He wanted to kiss Draco whenever he wanted, and he wanted Draco to be happy, but he didn’t
instead of
isn’t it? That is
it all happening. If they were an Unspeakable—which was likely, thanks to Kingsley’s insight that the Unspeakables answered to
“By demanding a favour in return for a favour.”
—and pulled out his wand, slowly, aiming it at his feet, concentrating hard on the thought of his favourite slippers as he transfigured his shoes.
to take this case—but he wouldn’t beg for it.
Draco turned his head, pressing a cold, pointy nose into the warm skin behind Harry’s ear, making him shiver.
As soon as he decided it, the leatherbound journal came floating out of the bag. It landed in his waiting hands, heavier than it should have been. The leather felt scaly and harsh against his oversensitive fingertips, though he knew from memory how supple it was.
“I hate you,” Draco repeated, then kissed him, and it was hard and aggrieved and Harry felt all of it, Draco’s pain and loss battling his love and adoration. Harry surged forward, arching into him, hoping this would be enough, hoping Draco would keep him anyway. He hated himself for it.
or obligations or sacrifices.” Harry’s hands slid down, fingering the frayed collar of Draco’s—
” He wasn’t sure that made sense, but it was true. “It wasn’t hidden, just sort of… tucked away…” He mumbled, making more notes. “It wanted to be found. It knew it would be.”
you.”
precarious, especially in that kind of state. You can’t spend too much time around magical folk like that, or you’ll hurt them, too. There’s amulets and charms and potions one can take to protect from fire and electric currents, but I doubt they make the experience any more comfortable. Plus, you’ll have to affect the weather, yourself, in order to make the conditions just right, then become your own lightning rod and get struck by lightning in the middle of these cities.”
It was conflicting, Harry thought, seeing Malfoy in what Harry had always assumed was his element. He fit right in among the gold gilt and deep velvets, his impeccable posture and poise a monument to his bloodline. And yet, he didn’t fit at all.
Harry nodded to prove his point, and went back to his quiet
The Department knew what he was planning to do, and didn’t believe he would survive it.
“Yes. He just… took care of it.” Draco’s face was practically begging as he awkwardly stuffed his hands into his pockets.
Harry valiantly managed not to hit him. He knew it was an Auror tactic, trying to get on Malfoy’s side, to make Malfoy’s problems Ron’s as well. Malfoy did look a little mollified.
Potter sipped his coffee as he worked, kept warm by Timsy’s temperature regulating charms on the mugs. He raised his eyebrow at Draco, apparently surprised that the coffee was still perfect. Draco only murmured, “That would be Timsy’s doing.”
Harry. You defended yourself. And I would not have accepted your help—I didn’t even accept Dumbledore’s help, when it was offered.”
A colossal shelf finally halted directly in front of them, and Harry stepped forward to examine the nearest tag. It had only his name—he needed his
“No,” Harry replied. “Draco was pissed about what I was doing
Draco shook his head slowly. He clenched his jaw to keep from speaking his honest thoughts—like
Harry held his breath.
Draco patted the armrests of his chair, and stood up, effectively ending the odd confessional moment.
Draco frowned at the chalkboard in his study, his hands on his hips.
completely confident in his ability—that was definitely a formative memory, to Draco. His own mind would have definitely chosen it as a breadcrumb.
to speak to him since he offered me up to the Dark Lord, as collateral, in an effort to remedy his failings.” Harry raised his eyebrows again, probably at Draco’s switch to “the Dark Lord.”
“Do you know anyone like that in your, erm… circles?” Ron asked tentatively.
In Regulus’ bedroom, he found a long, platinum chain in an old bureau. He held it up in his hand, examining it, then pulled the cheap metal house key out of his pocket. It was a miracle he hadn’t misplaced it, yet.
Draco sat at his kitchen table, eating Timsy’s perfectly cooked bacon and eggs and buttered toast, his mind practically vibrating with eagerness to get started on this particular puzzle.
Draco wiped the tears from his eyes with his finger. “Oh, Merlin,” he breathed, still chuckling. “If chasing down Dark wizards doesn’t work out, Auror Potter, you’ll definitely have a career waiting in pantomime.” Draco giggled some more, and Harry rolled his eyes, still smiling. “But yes, you should absolutely hand over your Order of Merlin to Timsy. He was roasting into the wee hours of the morning, you know, the dedication he has to providing the best coffee in Wizarding Britain is unsurpassed. Now, finish the sandwich our hero has so graciously prepared for you.”
“I think we should actively start our search today, do you agree?” Draco asked. Harry nodded, putting three sugars and plenty of milk in his own tea. Draco refrained from wrinkling his nose at how that might taste.
After another day of traveling the coast and asking around fishing villages, he found someone willing to help him: a quiet, older man called Willem, and his retired fishing boat, who agreed to help Harry simply out of the goodness of his heart.
“Then you’ll have to agree to another date,
of it. He felt completely detached from his body—his legs were moving without his permission, and Boran was whimpering behind him, as he stood fully and began to walk, no longer in control. Surges of panic and terror and rage were pulsing through him violently as his legs carried him forward, closer to the bars, closer to his father.
Harry’s mouth twisted; he turned his notebook back around, returned the pen to it for a minute more.
“Let me just get this straightened, then we’ll head back to the Manor,” he said, striding out of the cube, leaving Harry alone with Hermione.
Draco nodded. Harry guessed he was probably thinking of ways to help Boran, himself.
They would heal, but it would scar.
Hours later, Harry would add another smile to his collection: something sated and satisfied, affectionate and anxious, that incisive curl of Draco’s lips somehow softer with piercing, blood-stained teeth behind it.
“‘Mione’ll be home today,” Ron mentioned casually, leading the way out of the DMLE, and Harry groaned internally. That meant they would
“It’s bad, Ron, I couldn’t wait.”
I’m so tired of fighting the corrupt bloody Ministry.” He plopped down in his chair, scrubbing a hand through his vibrant ginger hair. “What now?”
“That’s sick,” Draco said quietly, closing his eyes against the wave of nausea. “One Horcr—” Draco grimaced. “One of them is horrific enough, but
It was a good thing no one could see him blush, in the shadowy Hall.
“Didn’t Conjure a properly functioning human anatomy?” Hermione finished for him.
The library looked different in the golden evening light. Warmer, more welcoming. Harry wondered if this was the hour when Narcissa liked it best, if it looked like this when she came back from the Department every Saturday.
“Still creepy,” Draco nodded, twisting the pen in his fingers. “But very useful.” He winked, setting off the resident butterflies in Harry’s stomach.
“Draco received a letter this morning, full of death threats and the usual nastiness about ‘Death Eater scum,’ you know,” he said. “He said he gets letters like that sometimes, but nothing this…
“I’m going to fix it, Harry,” Kingsley said firmly, setting his jaw. “I’m going to take back my Ministry, and I won’t stop until Draco is safe, Lucius is locked up for good, and every single Unspeakable is accounted for.”
Draco had
how you’ve always been. You’re the Chosen One and the Saviour, the same way you were the protector of the Sorcerer’s Stone when you were eleven. You had to take up the role, own the scar and all it represented, because no one else would...”
“This looks to me like it might be a mind curse,” Draco continued, “but we won’t know for sure until we get in there. I’ve certainly never seen anything like it—most silence curses simply remove one’s voicebox, physically. But curses inside the mind tend to leave clues, or marks, like… like breadcrumbs.'' He furrowed his brows, recalling a muggle fairy tale about siblings that dropped a trail of breadcrumbs to prevent themselves from getting lost. The words were barely out of his mouth, however, when he realized how utterly ridiculous that sounds to anyone who didn’t know the tale, like it had to him a few years ago when a curse breaker used that analogy in a lecture.
Damn it. Draco tried to hold his lips together, but it was no use. This was so embarrassing. “Not a memory,” Draco panted as the truth burst through. “A dream. A fantasy.”
He thought of the peach rose at his bedside, her impeccable posture and poise, of
“Can’t blame a lad for checking his own reflection every now and then, Potter. I have to make sure I look good for my big win.” Malfoy looked like he was
Draco didn’t let go of his hand, this time.
The spell rushed through the office in a wave, covering every inch of surface area, revealing one human in a closed office in the back. Harry stepped around the desk and stormed his way to the back of the room, wand in hand, anxious entourage in tow.
“I have a letter in my pocket, that I’ve kept in there all day—it’s from Pansy, informing me of the child she’s expecting, how happy she is about it, the names she’s picked out, and the godfather she’s chosen: me.” Draco could feel Harry feeling his own happiness—it was odd, but enjoyable. Draco gently moved them to the next memory, which was significantly noisier than the first.
No, it's September. He assured himself. He's usually too busy with his studies.
"You…you adopted a witch?" Arista gasped her voice pitchy as it started to crack as tears appeared in her big, violet eyes.
If only his childhood-self was there now. He'd be sick with envy. "I genuinely would love that."
He lifted his head up, confused.
"Uh-huh. He did it without magic too."
He dropped his wand immediately. "Sorry, I thought—" he held his head suddenly slammed by nausea "Fuck me."
They landed, hard, into a plot of sand just before the cave where she knew he was going. She was all arms and hands trying to pin him down but Voldemort shoved her off of him. She fell on her side. She was picking herself up, ready to charge him, when she looked and saw his wand pointed directly at her nose.
His quick lie made the Dark Lord smile. "Such a well-mannered young man." To Ariel, he said, "You know it's funny, I was talking to Draco, here, about how, as a late Saturnalia gift, I was going to send a bunch of elves to clean this house—because I couldn't help but notice how filthy this place has gotten over the years—and Draco, here, not only offers up his services but he insists on doing it without magic!"
"No, thank you." She replied, biting back bile and forcing out a smile.
The woman didn't seem to care about them either for her focus was squarely set on him. He could tell from the expression on her face that his unwillingness to be afraid of her interested him.
"Fuck." He groaned in English.
"Nar…"
"Silencio!"
Shortly after Voldemort went to the grab Draco, Nagini woke up from her 3rd nap of the day looked at the couch her master's beloved currently occupied and said to herself, approximately, 'I don't know what that thing is but I'm going to climb the shit out of that.'
"And Ariel, do you—" She asked her emerald gowned sister.
"He's very sweet," said Ariel in a voice slightly louder than normal. "When he wants to be."
"You're so full of shit, Draco," Harry said. Then he smiled. "I bet he was furious today that he lost five members."
"So, how's..." he passed out face-first into the kitchen table before he could finish his sentence.
"For fucks' sake," Draco said with an angry sigh. "Is it so much to ask for a clean glass?" He glanced at Harry's glass and made a grossed-out noise as Harry took another small sip. "How can you drink from that? It looks like it was washed with sand."
Then, the glorious epiphany entered her mind with the same dazzling brilliance as the coming dawn. It sent her flying out of the warmth of her bed, accidentally waking Severus in the process.
Rufus believed it all.
"Ah, tu parles français?"
One of his friends charged towards her, wand raised but again, they were too slow.
Dust and bits of debris fell to the ground as the shack trembled weakly.
"What?! Where?! How?!"
"And, as it turns out, we are both of the same minds," She continued dropping an open issue onto his lap with the pages flipped to an article that he wrote titled, 'The Exorbitant Cost of Unhappiness: How The Potions Industry Profits From Lack of Mental Health Resources in the Magical Community', "That mental health potions should be low cost and free to all."
"I'm sorry for snapping at you." He grunted out awkwardly not used to apologizing.
"Yep," Ron said, showing his scribbled-up papers as proof. "I did the easy assignments when I got them and worked on the tedious projects ahead of time instead of procrastinating."
Voldemort started to laugh. "'Shrine boy'. Merlin's Beard," He leaned in and told her conspiratorially, "You know, until you came, I thought about hiding the shrine while he was away at school. That way I could watch his face as he tried to find it without asking anybody if they have seen it because how was he going to go around asking people if they'd seen his Harry Potter shrine?" His sentence ended in a fit of snickers.
"Of course, they have met Severus and they already like him better than they like me," said Ariel as she waded through the purple lagoon to receive a hug from each of her sisters.
At last, Dumbledore stepped out of the wall and appeared with his wand raised. "I'm not the only one on borrowed time, Tom. Or should I say…mama's boy."
Slowly, the dementor compiled but even when the cell opened with a creak the prisoner didn't show signs of noticing them. It wasn't until Ariel stepped inside and told the dementor to give them privacy, did the man turn his head to address her.
He stepped aside to open the door with his wand and allow Ariel's first entry. She grinned at him, excitedly, when she passed by.
Snape looked to the side like he spotted a ghost in the corner. Then after a heartbeat, he said, “When he killed my best friend and her spouse, I knew I was on the wrong side.”
But how could he plot when his eyes couldn't bare the garish sunlight coming through his classroom's windows? How was his supposed to think of a plan to fulfill his order when his head felt like it was filled with mud? He couldn't bare it. He needed sleep. He needed rest, desperately. And that's why he found himself, half-dead, in front of Snape's office door his limbs so heavy from exhaustion he could barely bring himself to knock.
"I do. But up until last week, I was, in fact, Severus Snape, Potions Master and guest editor/ contributor to Potions Heads Monthly."
She looked down at his hand sitting on top of hers then lifted her head and said, "I remember looking at you and just knowing right away that you were full of this…rage. I figured, maybe, if I became your friend…you wouldn't grow up to be a serial murderer."
He looked over his shoulder to see the green flash of light coming from the dining room fireplace. He turned and raised his wand lazily for Bellatrix and Narcissa had their wands drawn and pointed at the mouth of the smoking fireplace, ready and waiting to attack whoever stepped out.
Draco adjusted, trying to get comfortable in the stiff manor chair. Despite being absurdly expensive, most of the furniture in the manor was not all that comfortable.
The room immediately filled with snickers and grins. “Where've you two been?” Finnigan chimed out mischievously.
Teddy bobbed his head to imaginary music as he plowed into his meal. It was clear that pasta, Draco, and Harry all at once made this the best night ever. Teddy kept the conversation going as they ate, asking unprompted questions and telling funny stories. He made a comment about a dinosaur, and Draco made a note to ask Harry about that before he left.
“Yes, of course I have. Why wouldn't I? I'm a great boyfriend.” Malfoy just nodded again, not looking slightly amused at Ron's defensiveness or embarrassment.
“Potter.” He didn't say anything else. Like that was his entire argument.
problems. Something was going on. He felt like he was one step away from cracking it, but what was that last step?
“They were saying that... it was us flirting.” He wasn't sure why he told Harry. Perhaps because he knew they would undoubtedly have the same conversation with him at some point. The least he could do was help Harry be more prepared for that storm than he was.
had inherited it. Draco had been there a few times as a child, but not for years before the war.
Malfoy grabbed Harry's hand. “I want to be with you.” Harry started to respond, but Malfoy continued sharply. “I swear, if you say something as obtuse as, '
Harry playing with Teddy. Draco's heart raced when he remembered the unbridled joy on Harry's face while watching his Godson. If Draco could ever make Harry smile like that, he just might decide all the years of unrequited love were worth it.
“No, I think he got Harry something else.” Their staring contest continued. He wouldn't break. He wouldn't look away. He was a damn Malfoy, a Slytherin.
“Uh, sorry?” Malfoy was biting his bottom lip. Harry did not find this distracting in the least. It did not make him picture Malfoy biting Harry's lip while-
“Mess with them how?”
“Why, looking to lose?” Malfoy shrugged.
Draco gulped. He had never, in all his guesses, come up with anything remotely close to that. He almost wanted to say something kind, or at least not rude. But clearly, he didn't come to him for that.
Harry watched from across the room. The boy he was intently observing continued scratching his quill across his parchment without looking up. Like he hadn’t noticed Harry watching him, or maybe just didn’t care.
"Don't stay up all night
“So... what are you saying, exactly?”
“I just... I know you've been watching me, following me. It's like sixth year all over again. I don't blame you, I really don't. But I'm not doing anything, I swear. I just want to come back and finish Hogwarts, get a quiet job somewhere, and never cause another problem.” Harry gulped. “You can check my bags, my wand, my chambers, anything you want. I'll take Veritaserum and you can question me. I'm not doing anything.”
Harry didn't even look up when someone came in the room. He continued his very important task of staring at the ceiling above him. Were there a hundred other things he could be doing? Yes. Could he convince himself to move to do any of them? No.
“I'll give them two days. I can't sit around forever waiting for Weasley to solve a simple problem.”
He was fully aware it was nothing more than a fantasy. There was a long list of reasons Harry would never return the feelings. When he thought about it, he decided that it wasn’t the fact that Harry was clearly straight or that Draco had been a Death Eater that was the reason he knew Harry would never be with him; it was the simple fact that Draco had been an awful, prejudiced asshole in school.
“Love feels no burden, thinks nothing of trouble, attempts what is above its strength, pleads no excuse of impossibility; for it thinks all things lawful for itself, and all things possible.”
“Well, I won it in a contest. But after riding it once, I just can't bring myself to part with my Firebolt. I wanted to give it to someone else.”
“No?”
“He follows me around so I will insult him just because he's so sick of being worshiped.” There was a profound silence.
“But... then there won't be anyone fighting you. Insulting you. That's what you want, isn't it?” Harry had the nerve to laugh.
“Weird. I feel like... you might also be out after curfew for no good reason. And you don't seem to avoid an argument any more than I do...”
He'd asked Harry, and they'd brainstormed some half-decent ideas, but none of them seemed good enough. He'd even asked Ginny, knowing there was plenty Hermione only shared with her. His sister had merely rolled her eyes and said that
“Harry,” he breathed out. He kissed a hot line from his jaw to the edge of his robes. Harry rested his head against the neck he had just been attacking. He was as out of breath as Draco was.
“You have made a point to be near me for weeks because I don't like you.” Harry hesitated, then made a grumble Draco assumed was a positive. “What are you, some kind of masochist?” For a moment, he wondered if perhaps the Savior had some really deep-rooted mental issues where he craved an enemy in the absence of the one he had been fighting his entire life. But Harry responded.
“Please. I've had to cook since I was practically Teddy's age.” When Draco looked closer at him, he noticed Harry's smirk flicker. He didn't think Harry had meant to say that. Harry jumped to his feet and started cleaning up the kitchen, pointedly not facing Draco. “And I didn't think Draco Malfoy would be a good babysitter, but here we are.”
His hand slipped when the announcer turned to Harry Potter. Draco stilled for a few moments, debating turning it off or listening intently. He turned it off when he realized it was just another blurb about Harry Potter not dating anyone. It had been over five years since Harry had broken up with Ginny, and no one had seen him date anyone since. Not even one date, which even that would have been front page of the Prophet.
Draco tried to kick the garbage bag behind a chair before Potter could notice it, but that only made it more obvious. The grin faded immediately when he saw it.
"I just... you're so distracting, you know? How am I supposed to think rationally when you're
“All this time. Arguing. We could have been. Doing this.” Harry took a short breath between every few words. Draco laughed. There was a snap from a distance, pulling them both apart and reminding them where they were.
He did his best to focus, with faint images of Harry flitting across his mind. Harry catching the Snitch, Harry's face when they won the House Cup, Harry writing an essay, Harry dancing with Luna at a party, Harry Harry
But he didn't want to sell it or give it to just anyone, since it was such an important house to a long-standing Wizard family. More importantly, it was something his Godfather had given him.
“You were right. I shouldn't have encouraged us to be that risky.” Malfoy just shrugged. Harry waited, like he thought Malfoy was just letting his anger build up for a powerful release. But the blond just gestured for Harry to come closer, which he did. As soon as they were in reach of one another, Malfoy grabbed Harry by the robes and yanked him flush with his body. Malfoy pressed his thighs against Harry's waist on either side. Harry gulped. He thought maybe they'd have some great angry sex after arguing, if he was
All at once, Ron felt a wave of dread. Something was off in the room, but he couldn't place it. After looking around for a minute, he realized that although the curtains were almost drawn all the way, he could see that Malfoy's bed was empty, too.
It was a nice fantasy, one he allowed himself to indulge in during their return year to Hogwarts. There was no real harm in studying Harry in the library and Great Hall, listening to and watching him with his friends in the Common Room, or daydreaming about being with him.
“Malfoy, can he just have one day where-”
“Merlin, Harry,” Ron sputtered. Harry braced himself. “A nice way to show you like a bloke.” Harry shrugged.
“I don't expect you to understand, Weasley. But Granger, use that big brain of yours. Why do you think he doesn't want to hear about his accomplishments? Why haven't your attempts at cheering him worked?” Hermione's anger was replaced with confusion.
“You tell me. I just meant you've talked to him recently.”
“How do you not get it? I don't give a damn if you insult me, or praise me, or argue with me, or kiss me. I care that I know you're doing it because of who I am, not my title or fame or any of those meaningless things.
“In so many words. It wasn't hard to figure out that overly-adoring him on his birthday was the last thing he wanted.” The girls both looked lost in thought.
“I think that can be arranged.” Harry leaned forward so he was a centimeter from Malfoy's face, his arms pressed to the desk against his thighs. “Shall we just start snogging on the table in the Great Hall, do you suppose? Or let them figure it out on their own?”
to Malfoy's apology.
“Did you, for one moment, consider that he doesn't want this?” He cried, no longer able to hold in his anger. He gestured towards the cards vaguely. Both of them looked confused.
“Huh. I guess
“It's fine, Potter.” Harry felt some of his tension release. Malfoy didn't even sound annoyed. Harry took a hesitant step closer.
“Oh? What exactly do you call what you and Harry do everyday?” Instead of flushing, like he would have expected, the color drained from his face. He narrowed his eyes.
Ron hesitated. It didn't sound like Harry was in trouble, so eavesdropping felt wrong. But... but he was in the common room at two in the morning with Malfoy. So Ron cast a silencing charm on the door and cracked it open, just enough to see a glimpse into the room.
“I thought we could come up with some other ideas along that line. You can help, Draco. What's stopping
.” Teddy giggled when Draco poked him in the chest as he said his name.
His eyes darted around them to see if Harry was with them, but he was nowhere to be found. Granger quirked an eyebrow. She was definitely too smart for her own good.
“What do you mean?” Harry interrupted. “It's perfect!” He reached out to swipe frosting off with his finger, but Draco leaned down and smacked his hand away.
“Ah. So you
about not eating it.
Ron smiled. “Nothing wrong at all, mate. I was just thinking that you might be right. I'm starting to think Malfoy isn't the absolute worst.” Harry was too surprised to hide the pure joy that spread across his face at that.
There were a few moments of silence as everyone dug into their fried food. Pansy moaned when she ate her first bite of onion rings. “Ugh, I hate being on a diet. Saturday nights are the only times I'm happy.”
“Good point, good point.” He wrote Neville's name down. Then Dean and Blaise, followed by the names of those in the adjoining dorm - Ernie, Michael, Justin, and Theo. He stopped, looking back at Ron. “No one seems likely. We'll just have to check them all out.” Harry's heart calmed.  They hadn't even written Malfoy. Why would they? Even if they were supposed to be checking every suspect, they didn't need to check the person Harry “hated.” Harry felt something in his chest, although he couldn't tell if it was anger or relief. He did his best to ignore as the sudden detectives went around interviewing people.
“Did you know that we went to school together when we were kids?” Teddy's jaw fell open.
The man sat down on the bench across from his and started pulling things out from his bag – a pad of parchment, a quill, a camera. Harry held in a groan, just barely. A reporter.
“Now I don’t know quite what you’re getting at,” she bristled, “but my Terry has made up for his mistakes in the past. He has nothing to do with any of this nonsense. Now please, leave.”
Soft lips swallowed Harry’s words. He instantly kissed back. His brain went fuzzy in the most delightful way. He’d been longing to feel this sensation again for what felt like ages.
It wasn’t all that strange for Malfoy to join the trio in walking to and from lessons considering they had many of the same core classes. However, Harry was not so thrilled when Malfoy arrived at the table he shared with Ron in Potions and spotted the test score Slughorn had just handed back out. His raised eyebrows were telling enough, but Harry sent him a fierce glare, trying to will him to not comment. It mostly worked.
“Oh!” Harry waved his opposite hand at the alarm clock and the sound fizzled out. They’d need a new soon already, electronics never liked to be turned on or off by magic.
Harry noticed Draco involuntarily cringe at the name. He leaned closer, his hand giving a small squeeze to the knee it was still rested on. "You know you don't need to be scared of him anymore," Harry said gently. "He's dead. You saw his body."
"Welcome home, Master," croaked Kreacher from the doorway.
If time stopped at that moment, he would not complain.
“Wait.” Harry straightened, the bench hitting the back of his knees and nearly making him fold back up again. “You want to help him?”
"I don't think I'm going to be invited around the Weasley house anytime soon," Malfoy mumbled. For a split second, Harry forgot who he was talking to and frowned at the other man. It wasn't until he noticed how concentrated he was on the steamed vegetables, pushing them around his plate with his fork, that it finally occurred to Harry what he'd said. Molly refused to even name a Death Eater, especially around George, let alone invite one over for dinner.
What the hell was he doing?
Ron let out a long dreary sigh as he looked out the window. It was another decent day in late October.
“Sir,” an Auror called their attention from behind Ron and Hermione, “the minister is requesting an update on Auror Potter.”
Without even noticing, he found himself sitting at the desk again, his head in his hands as he tried to steady his heart.
“Guys, please, let’s not do this right now,” Hermione urged. “Harry should rest.”
There was a moment of lag before Malfoy’s thoughts caught up. “Do you mean you actually opened a book outside of school?”
Malfoy also started to sleep regularly in Harry’s room, only separating when someone would catch wind that McGonagall would do a room check. These nights were also when Ron magically materialized in his own bed. On the nights when they were together and their nightmares overwhelmed them, they would either go down to the Common Room to watch the fireplace or sit in the room and talk.
Harry nodded gravely. “I did. He thought what Lucius was saying was just as ridiculous as I do.” He shrugged out of Hermione’s hold to sit down at the table. “None of this would be half as bad if he hadn’t pulled his son into the war.”
It had been a long day. Panic attacks definitely took a lot of energy out of a person. It was a wonder Harry had lasted as long as he had, but he soon felt drowsiness beginning to take over.
Harry's eyes slowly worked open. He shifted under the thick duvet uncomfortably. It's been a long time since he'd woken up feeling like
Harry shrugged. “I hated Snape,” he paused before admitting, “but I knew why.”
Harry rolled his eyes, but the corners of his mouth were pulling up as well. “Fantastically narcissistic.”
Another bout of laughter fell out of Draco’s mouth, and Harry couldn’t help but follow. They started to walk again, conversation flowing easier now. Draco asked questions that Harry never imagined anyone would want to know the answer to. Did Harry have any childhood pets? What did he want to be when he grew up before learning about magic? How about now that he knew about magic? Draco rolled his eyes at the mention of being an Auror.
He was the only man that the Dark Lord was truly afraid of and yet he had sent Draco, a sixteen-year-old boy, to kill him. He had assumed Draco would not succeed. It was meant to be a death sentence, a wild goose chase to humiliate and destroy the Malfoy family.
“I love you too.”
“Yes!”
Draco looked around the flat frantically until his eyes came across the papers that had fallen onto the ground. He pointed at them. “Look, if I was trying to kill him, then would I have his letters?”
A sharp breath sucked into Malfoy’s nose though he actively kept his mask firm. “That was a cheap line. You’ll have to start doing better.”
The pair fell back into their old habits without hitch. Harry didn’t go back to work until after his Monday appointment with Sow, who was delighted to see Draco’s return. She finally cleared him and sent him on his way but, to Draco’s surprise and gratitude, he didn’t head straight off to work that day after getting the news in the morning. Instead, he spent his last day off with Draco which was far less tense now that Draco didn’t have to be so worrisome and Harry was given all of his freedom back.
As Harry had expected, he walked into a spotless flat. There wasn’t a spec of dirt around although there was clutter. All of the books from the long shelving unit behind the dining table had been pulled out and stacked onto the table, counter, and floor. Draco stood among them. His brow was in deep set concentration as he stared at the cover of two red books. At second glance, it appeared he was sorting them all by color.
Hermione released her tight grip on Harry’s shoulders so they could both look at Ron but kept one arm around his back as if he needed support. Harry rubbed her back as a silent thank you. “It’s okay, I went home voluntarily. I didn’t want to go in at all today but Draco didn’t want it to seem like it affected us.”
Draco was trembling with frustration. “I would never hurt him, so, please, take me to him.”
“Yeah, but…” Harry twisted around to face him fully, refusing to linger on the wince of pain which crossed his face. “You don’t leave the house alone.”
“Did you actually think I’d kill him now?”
“Yeah, but I assumed he just didn’t care. It never felt like he was doing it out of spite. He just doesn’t care who his actions affect.”
Both Ron and Neville rolled their eyes, but at least Neville was smiling.
Harry only chuckled as he sat back. He left one hand on his knee as if not entirely able to keep that far away.
We can turn it into gold dust..."
So, instead, he sat in his bed and attempted to read, but all the while he daydreamed.
Everyone began to scoop out helpings onto their plates, but Harry let go of Draco only long enough to pass bowls around. When things were settled and several conversations began to spring up, he felt Harry’s fingers interlace with his. Draco didn’t fight it. He knew he should. There were too many people around and they agreed not to do this but it was helping. He almost forgot how many people were around him and how much they wished he wasn’t there. It wasn’t just Harry who helped though.
Both boys perked up. “Are you sure?” Never in a million years would have thought he’d be invited along to vacation with the Malfoys. She had to be joking or trying to trick Draco into it without seriously meaning to extend the offer.
“Hiya, Harry,” chirped Dennis Creevey.
“At least they fixed the pitch right up,” Harry said, on a happier note. “Not much to put together I suppose. So, are you coming?”
It was the only thing written in the book when he checked it Monday. He felt a small burst of pride. He almost wanted to read their voice as desperate. The thought of anyone wanting to desperately see him was thrilling. Someone actually wanted him. It almost made him regret not going.
Harry decided to push past the topic, looking down at Kreacher, who suddenly looked nervous by the conversation's direction. "We won't be here long," Harry informed the elf. "We need some pots and pans."
“I nearly knocked Robards teeth out when he said you went home,” Ron claimed. “They can’t sack you for something like this. It’s bloody mental.”
Before Malfoy could get to his bedroom door, Harry spoke up, “It’s not that late. We can find a show.”
He sighed and leaned forward onto the armrests of either side of Malfoy’s chair, trying to keep his voice low. Many people were outside or elsewhere in the castle, enjoying the last few decent days of the year before winter washed in. He had to be quiet to keep Ron and Hermione from hearing across the room.
"They may not know everything about wine, but Molly Weasley could outcook me any day. You should try her treacle tart. She always makes it for my birthday since she knows it's my favorite."
Draco nodded, but he didn’t look convinced. Harry wanted to hug him, but the throbbing in his skull told him not to sit up ― that and the many watchful eyes in the room. He could feel Ron’s burning stare boiling against his skin.
It was ridiculous. What could Malfoy really get up to in his room? It’s not as if he was going to lock him out like Zabini did.
He’d done this
, from Harry's POV.
A soft sigh and another creak of wood as Harry stood from the bed, putting away the book and padding stealthily across the floor to the door. He nearly jumped when he pulled it open to find Draco standing there, leaning against the wall, with what must have been a pathetically fond expression on his face. He closed Scorpius’ door—not all the way, Scorpius didn’t like to be so closed off—and squeezed Draco’s hand, giving him a peck on the cheek as he pulled him toward their own bedroom.
Draco barely got a glimpse of Harry’s wicked smile before he shot off, and Draco followed closely, urging his broom faster as they raced towards the house. It was close, but the
“You’re always distracted with your cases,” Pansy argued. “They don’t usually make you gaze longingly at my garden, or tap your foot incessantly on my floor.”
“If there’s a prophecy, it probably concerns me too, otherwise I wouldn’t have been attacked. I’ll be able to hear it. We need to go to Level Nine. We should have done it weeks ago,” Harry said, desperate to get moving, to
And Harry would only keep hurting him.
“So that’s why you trust my mother,” is what Draco finally decided to say, because he didn’t trust himself to say anything else and not completely explode. Harry searched his face carefully for a moment, before a corner of his mouth lifted a little, and he nodded.
“Smart woman,” Draco smirked.
than during that kiss—
“Ev-erything,” she answered. Harry hummed, then sat up slowly, rubbing feeling back into his face.
Harry ate lunch at his desk, again. He had thought he’d be kept busy, being back at work after nearly six weeks away, but his pile of paperwork was dwindling quickly, and he’d already run two interrogations this week, and successfully completed a raid of an illegal potions dealer’s warehouse… it was only Tuesday, and it wasn’t

Harry flicked his wand back towards Kingsley, who gasped with the surge of power that ran through him.
Potter looked to Weasley, then seemed to realize he couldn’t tear him a new one with just his face, so he scrambled his hands on the bedside table, desperately grabbing the blank parchment and quill that sat there. He started frantically writing something, then shoved the parchment in Draco’s face.
“Go on,” Shacklebolt muttered, clearly curious.
He hadn’t been allowed to find where it began or ended, he was forbidden to go beyond the property lines—there were

Harry buried his nose behind Draco’s ear, breathing him in, desperate to hold the world and real life at bay a little longer. He could feel an anger building within him, as if he was fighting it all, trying to protect this fragile happiness he’d found.
Tomorrow, he’d be going to
Harry’s stomach twisted with guilt. Draco saw it on his face.

Draco watched him, absently twirling a lock of his hair around his finger. Even sitting still, Harry looked like a masterpiece, and he was only
When Draco finally came down from the adrenaline rush, his breathing smooth and even, he raised his wand and pointed it at the chalkboard, labeling a new dot “Voldemort’s Return”. He took another deep breath and looked back at Harry, who was still watching him cautiously, as if Draco might spook at any moment.
Lucius had been pretty damn powerful in his prime, he had bribed and blackmailed and manipulated nearly every person he’d met. Draco certainly didn’t want that power. He had rejected it, after all, in rejecting his name, how would he rise higher…? But rising higher than someone didn’t have to mean power, it could mean anything… But someone wouldn’t have acted on it if they’d believed it meant anything benign… but only

“Doing what?”
Harry’s eyes were smiling, but a corner of his mouth was turned down in concern, or concentration. He seemed to light up a little as he wrote the next question.
“Good luck,” Pansy said, widening her eyes. Draco huffed, and pulled himself out of his fireplace.
Draco continued the reverie for a few moments more, before ending his spell, gently pushing Harry out of his head with Occlumency. Harry’s smile was small, but it reached his eyes, and Draco knew he could feel Draco’s emotions in those memories. Harry lowered his wand, watching Draco’s face, and mouthed
The muggle-repellant wards Harry had cast around Meayll Circle might have been strong enough to hide this place from muggles for the next fifty years, but there was nothing to be done for it now. Harry felt the restlessness of the earth beneath him, the friction and vibration in the sky above him, and thought he might actually combust, but that was the point, wasn’t it?
“You’re a brute,” Draco muttered, but one hand found Harry’s, lacing their fingers together over his hip. Harry pulled their bodies flush, and began to sway, guiding Draco’s hips.
“That was obviously an important conversation,” Draco began, “but why do
Harry rolled his eyes and scoffed, oblivious to their nonverbal conversations, and nodded his consent firmly. Draco couldn’t help his sigh of relief. “Thank you.”
Harry took him back to the summer before fourth year himself, and they made no detours along the way.
“Come on,” Harry said gruffly, standing and pulling Draco up from the bench. He draped Draco’s arm across his shoulders and held onto Draco’s narrow waist, helping him and his numb limbs inside.
Harry slapped his hand over his mouth as he broke out in laughter. The movement of his shoulder jostled his plait, tugging some stubborn curls loose. He reluctantly pulled off the elastic as his giggles subsided, the silly grin still stuck to his face as he imagined Petunia shrieking in fury at her withering agapanthus. He looked up at her again, his cheeks heating at her fond, mischievous expression, and held up the elastic in his hand.
“How much more of yourself are you going to give them, Harry? How much longer are you going to keep this up?” Draco’s voice was rising, hands clenched into fists, shaking in his lap. He’d dropped his wand again, at some point. Harry didn’t answer him, of course, but Draco could see the start of a glare—getting defensive. Draco didn’t care. He stood up to pace the room, the energy of his anger overflowing. At Harry, at Kingsley, at the Ministry, at Dumbledore and Voldemort and the
Of course,
,” Draco said, his eyes wide and furious, “how convenient that would be. I assume you’d want to be Secret Keeper, then? So you can give all your little Unspeakable friends exclusive access?”
A flash of wild fury crossed her calm face. It was so quick, Harry wasn’t even sure it was anything. He furrowed his brows.
“Timsy is collecting the traces,” he mumbled. “Timsy is finding.” He closed his big eyes, and tightened his grip on the wand at his side. Harry stayed right where he was, waiting as patiently as he could, that soothing hint of candlesmoke still wafting in his head. The room was frozen in silence, in anticipation. Timsy’s frown deepened, further wrinkling his greyish face, and one huge ear twitched as he worked, the wand moving slowly to point at the floor in front of him.
Rose’s little smile was bright, and she nodded again with enthusiasm.
And then with a final, harrowing
“And what a delightful bonding experience it was,” Draco said. “I’m not some sort of Gryffindor charity case, Potter.”
him, but it didn’t take the place of the pain they both had endured.
Harry still had a little smile on his face. “That was a fun one,” Draco said, grinning. Harry’s smile widened, but faded slowly again. He grabbed his notebook and started writing.
Potter’s eyes met his again, emerald green on sterling silver, with a glaring intensity that made Draco sigh and lower his wand. He hadn’t cast anything, but Draco could read his expression:

Harry’s lips quirked with amusement. That was much more familiar than the smooth, indifferent, professional Malfoy. He slowly raised his hand to point at the wire-framed glasses on his own face, that Malfoy had taunted him about for

raising an eyebrow.
He just happened to be doing it all in the most Gryffindorish way imaginable.
“So, I’ll be seeing you twice weekly for the next six weeks—Mondays and Thursdays, and full eight hour appointments. It’s not Legilimency the entire time—” Malfoy added, seeing Harry’s wide eyes, “—it’s a session in the morning, followed by rest and mapping out the progress, then another session in the afternoon. It’s irresponsible to do anything more frequent than that.”
seeing Harry like that, retreating into himself, numbing himself into an empty shell. Draco knew it was the only way he could get through all these funerals, because Harry had brought him along to every one. And he obviously had no right to claim the role of
Draco groaned as the floo chime continued to clang incessantly from his sitting room. He groped for his wand beneath his nest of pillows, squeezing his eyes shut against the harsh light of dawn streaming in from the large windows next to his bed. Not for the first time, he sorely regretted his bedroom layout. However nice it was to be able to look out the window into the starry night when he couldn’t sleep, it surely wasn’t worth the direct sunlight on his face first thing in the bloody morning.
me, as well, he was angry at a lot of things… people…” He waved his hand around vaguely. “He was pretty fucking furious, actually. He’d only ever been angry like that during our sessions once before, and it wasn’t—he didn’t put blame on me, that time, but this time… it felt like maybe he’d been holding that all in, the entire time, and he just exploded,” Harry said, feeling a bit desperate.
“Agreed, Granger, not a fun story. But the breadcrumbs are the best analogy here. Sometimes, I have to find all of the breadcrumbs and connect the dots, which together make a countercurse,” Draco explained. “Sometimes the patient has been thrown into their unconscious mind, and has to be guided along a trail to find their way back.” He suppressed a shudder. He hated venturing into an unconscious. They were bloody huge and nonsensical and near impossible to navigate.
Patricia gave him a perfunctory smile from the secretary desk as he approached, signaling to Harry that Ron wasn’t busy.
“Were you able to identify my presence in your head?”
He was gone for a while. They could hear drawers opening and banging around, and Harry knew he was taking his sweet time about it to piss Harry off. It was working. They left the office to follow him, eventually, pressuring him to hurry it up, which made for an interesting sight: Zacharias Smith being followed around filing cabinets by the Chosen One, the Head Auror, the Minister for Magic, a house elf, and a divorce lawyer. Too bad no one else was around to witness it.

you do?” Draco raised an eyebrow at him. His tea was going to get cold, if he kept ignoring it, Harry thought to himself. He opened his mouth to answer, and choked, a little—he’d forgotten about his contract. Of course, he was magically forbidden to answer that question. He physically couldn’t.

Three incredulous faces stared at it for a moment, until Harry waved his hand pointedly.
Malfoy’s nose twitched, and he took a deep breath, smacking his lips a little,
Harry’s lips quirked in amusement as he looked from Draco’s face, to his fuzzy-slipper-clad feet, and back, raising his eyebrows in a silent question.

Harry sat himself silently and petulantly at the well-worn wooden table in Ron and Hermione’s kitchen, where most of the scoldings occurred, crossing his arms over his chest, feeling like a child.
Harry interrupted, growing more frustrated by the second.
Hermione narrowed her eyes at him, scrutinizing him. “Harry,” she began, hesitating, “you and Draco didn’t do anything
but differently—he watched Harry
After a moment of tense silence, Ron shrugged and sighed.
As expected, Hermione was able to make much more sense of Narcissa’s notes. But she couldn’t provide any optimistic insights.
Ron asked, oblivious to his wife’s barrage of silent questions.
Draco nodded. That wasn’t unusual for his patients.
Draco relaxed his control a bit, and let the jumble of first year flow around him, all out of order.
“I wouldn’t say he’s
one, after all.
,” Draco whimpered, his trembling hands beginning to wander, mapping out Harry’s shape, making sure Harry was actually occupying the space in front of him.
Draco’s gaze shot through him, scorching and incisive and Harry had no idea what he was doing anymore. He no longer knew if he was here for
So he’d taken hold of Harry’s slack face and kissed him square on the mouth, gentle but direct, and it was finally enough to wake Harry up, to call him back. Harry had gasped against his lips, his hands slowly rising and tentatively gripping Draco’s robes.
Draco thought.
The quick flashes were expected, even with the meditation, and he rode it out, while softly explaining himself to Harry.
I’d heard of the phenomenon, but I never…” Draco took a deep breath, and sipped more of his hot chocolate, letting the warmth fill him. He felt like he couldn’t finish a thought before his mind raced to the next.
Harry shuffled to the lift and rode it all the way to the top floor. He eventually found a hatch that opened to the roof and dragged himself up.
“Oh,” Harry said, because what else could he say to that? Ron took a huge bite, hummed in agreement, and made sure to chew and swallow before he spoke again.
“As the guest, you get first pick,” Draco motioned towards his brooms. Harry took his time deciding, inspecting each one, stroking his fingers against the smooth wood, tracing the ends of the carefully trimmed twigs, before picking up the Nimbus 2001, and looking back at Draco with a mischievous smirk.
Malfoy was
“Okay, point is, Healer Malfoy is our best bet,” Weasley interrupted, “since there’s nothing wrong with you physically, the Healers agree this is a problem for the specialist in Mind Curses and Afflictions, and he’s agreed to help regardless of your history, and Harry, you’re just going to have to trust us on this,” he implored, as Potter began to deflate more and more onto the bed in defeat.

He walked out of the shop, waving a cordial goodbye to the harried baristas. He looked back only once, already missing the vibrant yellow of the lemon slices, and watched the steam curl gold, instead, illuminated by the warm, opulent bar lights.
post haste.
Draco’s voice shook a little. “Tell me.”
“Oh! Right!” Teddy jumped, and his hair swiftly morphed into chaotic black curls. His eyes remained a mirror image of Draco’s. Draco was utterly charmed.
“Plus,” Draco continued, “you’re not telling me to get any affairs in order. You’re not telling me you’re sorry for my loss. You

Draco flipped and flipped, moving forward and faster, through Quidditch matches and illicit Hogsmeade trips, until finally the glow appeared in his peripherals, and he seized it—
Now, Draco pulled the scrunchie out of his pocket and stretched it taut between his pointer finger and thumb, heading toward the bedroom. He felt rather ridiculous pulling out the warded box from his bedside drawers, but needs must. Dumping the box onto the bed, he surveyed the veritable rainbow of colors; there must have been at least twenty scrunchies, but was it really Draco’s fault when Harry just kept buying more?
There was nothing in the file he hadn’t already expected. He was pleased to note that Potter was still shorter than him by a few inches. He was apparently healthy, physically. Despite the loss of his voice, his larynx was perfectly fine. There was no curse residue, nor any trace of Dark Magic, and the statistics of his memory showed potential for a minor Obliviation, but nothing major. Whatever was going on was happening entirely in his mind. Truly, Draco was the best person for the job. This is what he
“—guess they locked his speech, he can’t tell us anything about the Department at all. Only good news is they can’t get back in, with the place under a hefty Fidelius, but that also means they’re all just… out there.” Ron waved his hand vaguely. “Doesn’t feel right. I’d feel much better with them all behind bars, after what they did—what they’ve
that roiled within him whenever Draco was around, that had once caused vicious fights and venomous, obsessive rivalry. It now caused painfully intense protectiveness, and a powerful, irresistible desire to experience Draco’s happiness, to be the cause of it. To know what it felt like under his fingertips. To know Draco in every way.
“I’m sorry,” Harry said, because he was, for things that hadn’t even happened yet. He kissed and sucked his way up Draco’s neck, rolling on top of him.
Finally, he let out a huff, and closed his eyes as he nodded his assent to the room. The other occupants let out a collective breath, and Draco moved forward to grab Potter’s chart from the foot of the bed. He sat in the chair on the other side of the bed, crossed one long leg over the other, and pulled his tortoiseshell reading glasses from his jacket pocket, putting them carefully on his face. He started to read over the file, familiarizing himself with its contents, until he realized the silence of the room was heavy with something he hadn’t expected.
specifically, just a
Draco gave Harry a few moments to wake up, hearing the rustle of fabric and leather as he stretched and sighed, the clatter of metal against glass as he plucked his glasses off the table. Draco turned to look at him, and was momentarily startled by the brightness of his eyes. He’d apparently forgotten how vibrantly green they were, green like his old Slytherin tie.
Harry shook his head with a wry look, but the solemnity of his expression remained. Draco was rolling his wand between his hands, face creased in thought, digesting all he’d seen, connecting it to what he knew about Harry.

“—he stepped into the floo and he—he made me call out the name—”
one, if I could help it.” He shot a fiery glare in Harry’s direction, which Harry thought was a little unfair. He hadn’t said a word. He thought he’d been rather polite, so far. He’d mostly just looked around and blushed.
Malfoy’s tour was ten times more interesting than Harry’s exploration could have been, because Malfoy knew
Draco scoffed. Quest for knowledge, indeed. Someone was having a laugh, somewhere. He pinned the nametag to the crisp black lapel of his suit, right under the Healer’s Emblem pin. The charms probably wouldn’t do him any good, here, but a little authority couldn’t hurt.
Draco looks up, and his breath catches as Harry takes that final step, sharing in Draco’s sunbeam. From this close, Harry can catch the sunlight glinting off the flecks of blue in his eyes, which roam frantically over Harry’s face. Harry brings a tentative hand to his arm, turning him until they’re face to face, chest to chest. Draco’s hands waver around him, unsure and shaky and sticky.
“I can’t,” Draco said, eyes pleading. Their confused frowns only deepened.
Draco heard little footsteps jump out of the bed, run to the bookshelf and pull out what sounded like a heavy book. He could imagine the incredulous look on Harry’s face.
Harry couldn’t read the title from his place in the room. He looked next to him to see whose memory this was, and wasn’t surprised to find his boss standing there. He didn’t recognize anyone else, but he recognized the robes.
Draco frowned at him. “What do you mean?”
been a while. He didn’t question it—he remained stubbornly entrenched in his reverie, where Draco was sighing contentedly against his lips, kissing him over and over, stroking the backs of his ink-stained fingers down Harry’s cheek, like Harry was something precious, cherished. Loved.
“Have you had breakfast yet?” Draco asked. Potter nodded once. He was wearing a long sleeved black t-shirt and a pair of snug, well-worn muggle jeans with his Auror-standard dragonhide boots. It suited him, which made Draco frown. It was annoying how good Potter looked, especially in something so casual. He probably didn’t even think before pulling on those clothes this morning.
As if Draco could do anything else.
Willem stepped over with a hard look on his weathered face. He grasped Harry’s shoulder and gave it an affectionate squeeze, then slid Harry’s wand into his hand, and the beer bottle into the other.
was more important than this—
as they called him. Draco had never felt so angry in his life.
Draco nodded. “I figured,” he muttered. “But the Healers I trained under have more experience, they might have been faster.”
“Ready for a break?”
like that. He wondered if the Department knew about such things, if they had considered using a similar method on Draco.
“Now, back to business,” he declared, shaking himself out and taking a deep, stabilizing breath. “I didn’t see anything that particularly stuck out to me as a clue, but the memories were flying past me rather quickly. Tomorrow, when we go back in, we’ll do more meditation. It helps slow things down, in your head. I’ll be able to look more closely. But since we’re nearly finished for today, how about I grab those memories from the pub?”
Harry leaned down and kissed him thoroughly, demonstrating exactly how he’d prefer to spend his time today, stealing Draco’s breath. Harry kissed the same way he did anything else: vibrantly, intensely, with his entire being. Harry’s kisses were completely enthralling, all-consuming, and Draco couldn’t get enough.
Harry simply frowned back at him, letting out a harsh, shaky breath. Draco raised his eyebrows, rolling his wand between his hands, and waited.
One storefront away, and Draco is deflecting his depressing thoughts; there’s still time, he’s only taken a few steps. Two, and his fingers are tapping on his legs, impatient and anxious, that window of time is closing rapidly as he approaches the end of the block. Three storefronts away, weaving through patrons lingering outside of another bar, breathing in more secondhand smoke, he feels like a bloody
Ron had placed on the room.
They landed hard on crunching dry leaves and thick undergrowth, a smell Draco recognized as the Forbidden Forest. He fell from Harry's back and hit the ground, and then Harry was on top of him, nose pressed to Draco's neck, boxing him in against the earth.
