"When we first got back. I said 'good morning' and she nodded and said it back like someone was holding a wand to her throat."
Snape wrenched the door open and glared out at them. His scowl faltered with surprise, and reformed into a more reserved scorn.
So Potter thought Snape would supply them with Truth serum, did he? Or did he know Snape was a Legilimens? Draco tried to assume a Gryffindor air of surety. "They won't catch me."
"I--" He looked at her -- really looked -- at her rough face and broad torso and muscular arms and intimidating height, and tried to imagine that she didn't have breasts the size of melons. "Okay. I can see what you mean. You wouldn't be my type, as a bloke, but you'd be impressive."
"I didn't say that!" Harry protested, sitting up. "She was just the one who wanted to. Anyway, does it matter?"
Draco's kiss was fire. When Harry tried to back into his room, Draco couldn't follow. The next room didn't work for Harry, and neither of them was willing to disrobe in the hallway.  Still, they made enough attempts to find space, hands stroking here and there, that they needed to stop at the top of the stairs to make themselves presentable again, and Harry was feeling smug as Draco lead him through the grandiose chambers of the ground floor.
From the wicker basket, Snape pulled a soft cloth bag with handles, and a small knife. "Hang this from your broom handle, and keep it in place and open with a Sticking Charm. Hold the stem below the berries -- you do not want to touch them -- cut through it below your grip, then drop the berries gently into the bag." As Harry was done affixing the bag, he handed him the knife. "Half full will be adequate. More than that and the berries at the bottom will be too crushed to use."
With a lopsided smile, Millicent nodded and took off her robes. Despite the weather, she was wearing a loose short-sleeved shirt under them. Her trousers, at least, looked thick and warm. Harry found the frayed edges of his glamour and dispelled it with a flick of his wand.
"I know," Harry answered. He felt a little better. Shyly, he sat at the end of the bench across from her. "I ... I still
Snape sniffed, but he sounded almost amused. "It still siphons too much time from useful pursuits.  However, I admit that victories, whether useful or not, have their own merit." He stood back, crossing his arms over his chest. "Well, Potter? Will you assist or not?"
"So it would seem." Dumbledore sighed. "However, even if she is caught, there are some attempts our enemies may make that will do no harm if you are in safe environs. As I was about to leave to help with the search effort -- reassuring myself with the thought that at least you were safely here at school -- I recalled Hagrid saying that you usually escort Miss Bulstrode down to her Tuesday and Thursday lessons. Even those familiar tracks on the grounds present dangers for you now. I must ask that you not leave the walls of Hogwarts Castle, even in the presence of friends, until your aunt has been located. Also, do not take any risks within it, as the effects may be magnified."
“I need the containment lifted,” Hecksban said. “Get something to deal with the blood. Quickly, please.”
"Oh." It hadn't occurred to Harry that Ron might not have mentioned the matter yet. He wondered if that explained some of the awkwardness between them earlier, and if Ron had even noticed it. "I expect he will." Quite suddenly, Harry found himself with an armful of Hermione. She twisted into him, hiding her face.  "Shh," he soothed. "He probably just hasn't thought of it yet."
"Yeah. They don't work on me anymore," Harry completed quickly. "So changing the wards is a bit much."
They discussed the divination, and Harry told Snape about what had transpired in the Chamber of Secrets, and why he thought that was what the Seer had drawn on. Snape concurred, especially as Madam Langston had said that the Dark Lord had appeared in his original form.
Ginny nodded acceptance, Padma sniffed in contained amusement, and Sophia called a vote. The new rule passed.
The painted colors smoothed and deepened. The square jaw lifted, and the tail lashed back and forth as the tiger snarled. It paced three inches to the crumpled paper of the package and three inches back. Draco touched his wand to it again. "Wait," he said, and the tiger yawned, and lay down, and seemingly went to sleep.
Harry didn't think the girls had gossiped, or that they were at the head of some secret cabal or something, but they relaxed more around him, and that trust seemed to diffuse through his house. On Tuesday evening, he was surprised when conversations stilled as he entered the Gryffindor common room. Hermione quickly broke the silence.
For a moment, Hermione looked like she might launch into theories, but then she took a quick, settling breath. "Harry, look -- David Charmer can make a perfectly adequate Wolfsbane potion, and I'm only planning to nurse for twelve months, so by next winter--"
"Harry," Draco implored, stopping all thought but the need to please him more. Harry adored him desperately through his cock, picking up the rhythm of his breathing and moving his mouth to match. Draco's cries grew in response, until Harry could hear him on the edge. He pushed his hands up Draco's sides and grabbed his nipples, squeezing tight, and Draco cried out, arched up, and flooded his mouth.
Seamus sprayed pumpkin juice halfway across the table.  Dean and Ron burst out laughing. Hermione laughed too, the sound tight and high with nerves. "You're awful," she said, when she could.
each other any more than we did then. After I turn seventeen, I don't expect we'll ever talk, never mind visit. Besides, they hate magic, and they wouldn't
The door opened. Harry listened to footsteps, and the click of a cubicle door being latched. He didn't have the nerve to continue.  Unnecessarily, he flushed the toilet, then slipped the letter back into his bag. A quick squirt of water in the sink, and he left, his heart beating as if he was waiting for a duel.
"Okay. Well," she simpered, "there are two rooms under my bathroom, one under most of it, and the other under just the end of the sinks."
For a moment, she -- he -- almost looked like he remembered, just from the force of the pedantic expression. "Well, properly, the masculine form of my Christian name would be Hermes, but that seemed a bit pretentious. I considered Hermokrates, which means 'the power of Hermes,' but after some thought, I decided on 'Eugene,' which means 'well-born.'" Cheeks rounded, finally, over a disturbingly angular jaw-line, as the-Boy-Formerly-Known-as-Hermione smiled.  "Because I
Harry swallowed. He could travel, walk through Diagon Alley, sit anywhere at school.... "Don't teach me that," he said.
"I am not actually certain, I'm afraid." Draco said. "While my sources are in agreement that the potion is safe for a single supervised use, they also agree that the effects, as I said,
"Of course not!" Harry shrugged. "Oh, Draco and I set a password to get past the mirror. It's 'reflective'. If that doesn't work, someone's reset it for privacy."
"But I am. Fourth year is the only one in question, but I was definitely in mortal danger at least once every other year."
"I didn't think so. If you'd like them to think of you as more than a tool, you need to try a little harder."
"I know what you mean! But it's not a problem.  Witness interviews under Veritaserum aren't at all like criminal interviews! We'll negotiate the questions with you ahead of time, so you won't be asked anything you haven't consented to, and you get to choose one of the Aurors present and have right of refusal for the other. So choose me, and Kingsley Shacklebolt will arrange to be the senior Auror, and you'll be safe."
"Linnet's father, you see, is the Undersecretary of Land Preservation. If you want to make new land Unplottable, or set long term Muggle-repulsion charms, he's your man. Mr. Parkinson's tongue got ahead of his brain, I would say."
"I'm so sorry," Draco said quickly. "It must be some sort of allergy. This is not a usual reaction."
She could have broken through them. It would have been easy.  Choking down something she had needed to steal from Harry -- any Harry -- would have been close to impossible. She left the meat untouched.
"Look," he said, "I'm fine with the seventh years, because they know me, and the sixth-year girls -- two of the five are on the team, and a third is Ginny, so that's okay. And at least two of the sixth-year boys think I'm okay. But the younger kids are a little wary of me. If I start with the first years, they have the least bias. They didn't go through all the fighting and distrust and such of last year, or the rumors that I was crazy the year before that, or Cedric dying with only my word on how the year before that." The last still hurt to mention. Harry had to stop to steady his breath. He took a bite of his sandwich.
Harry snorted. Could his housemates be just as paranoid as the Slytherins? "Oh, don't tell me you think I'm corrupting them!"
Harry's mouth fell open. He had entirely forgotten about his early morning impulsiveness. "Um, no?" Had that looked threatening to Blaise? "I just, um, couldn't resist. I mean, he was there asleep ... I don't think well before breakfast. Did he panic?"
"Or you could behave yourself and ask him more privately," Gilbert said with a frown. "I hardly consider this preferable to the Slytherin Common Room."
"Oh."  Hermione swallowed. "Maybe.... They say the curse is getting milder. No one's died in the last three years."
Snape did not take the offered item. Instead, he drew his wand and began to cast spells at it. Harry recognized two of the incantations as ones they had learned in Cursebreaking. After another dozen of these, Snape sat back, puzzled. "Set it on the table," he instructed. His next spell made the marble glow orange, and he let out a little "ah" of satisfaction. Picking up the marble, he looked at it for a moment, tossed it in the air, and caught it.
Ron's eyes widened. "Oh," he said, and then, stumbling, "I suppose ... s'pose I can understand that. Maybe." He managed a lopsided smile. "If he wasn't Malfoy."
"Oh?" Ron asked, looking curiously at their school bags. Draco put his down and drew his wand with a flourish. Ron, Harry noted, brought his hand to his own wand at that.
This was their fifth Friday gathering, and they were out of beer and down to three bottles of wine, so Draco had decided that tonight's refreshments would be an assortment of little cakes and sweets with a choice of coffee, tea, or hot milk. He hadn't mentioned that he was planning to arrange them with white roses and sprays of currants. When Harry and Neville came around the curve in the passage, the impressive display claimed their immediate attention.  Curves of glossy green leaves, white blossoms, and translucent red berries separated china cups and silver carafes from a tiered display of glossy chocolate cubes and orbs, glittering crystallized flower petals, and golden custard tarts.
"Draco." Snape met Draco's eyes over the table.  "You need not fear losing him. I am being cautious."
"In the hemlocks would be more concealing." Draco smirked. "But I prefer the symbolism of birches. Yes."
Draco scooped out the rice, and the chicken with its burnt orange sauce, and when Harry held out a piece of paratha, he tore a piece off of it. He ate a bite of everything, and then, closing his eyes, stopped and breathed. When he opened them again, he looked straight down the length of the sofa at Harry.
"No." Harry shrugged.  "I told her it might be better to wait a week -- that there had been a bit of a row last time, and we needed to work some things out."
They kissed again, for a very long time. Harry enjoyed the way Draco shifted against him, but he was careful not to respond too enthusiastically. He didn't think he'd be able to stop if they really got going.
"Hm," she said, once the group had quieted. "Oh, I know! I've never mistaken Muggle technology for magic."
Harry looked sidelong at Snape. Perhaps he thought of it that way because Snape was more ambiguous than he wanted to deal with. "So -- have you told her who she'll be seeing?"
"Well, you've noticed it wasn't mentioned at the Welcoming Feast, I expect. So I went to talk to Professor Dumbledore."
Harry couldn't remember if he and Snape had discussed his extraordinary potential to destroy Voldemort. On the other hand, Dumbledore may have told any number of people. "I think so. Not from me, but ...." Harry shrugged.  "He seems to. We've certainly discussed how I might go about it."
"That was just mocking me, and you know it! I was terrified, I was injured, and I was being tortured." Draco dropped down to a crouch in front of Severus, and ran his thumb down his cheek. "Most importantly," he said softly "I didn't want to be his."
Pomfrey returned with a vial, and forced a smile as she handed it to Harry. “Drink this now, and then follow it with the rest of the water. Professor Hecksban is right. Move and stretch –
"Well, life as a fugitive is kind of boring, okay? I promise you, I have no intention of using gargoyle dust."
Sunday, Draco was brewing with Millicent. Harry had been planning to risk the short walk, but Millicent had told him not to be an idiot, and Draco, once she asked him, had pointed out that the hazard was not just the walk on the grounds; if both of them were taken out in the privacy of the tunnel, it would be hours before anyone missed them. It was sensible, but the change in schedule had Harry at loose ends. While wandering around feeling useless, he came into the entrance hall and saw Blaise crossing to the stairs.
They went to the Uncommon Room, walking in companionable silence where the hallways were crowded, and talking about lessons where other students passed them only occasionally. She stood aside when it was time to reach through the mirror, and followed him in as a guest.
Hermione sighed. "Professor Snape," she explained, her lips tight, "took Harry to a seer, who did a Dark scrying
"Oh, you'll get one." Draco smirked. "I may make you be nice to my friends, but intend for you to find it
you that you don't understand us, and this is just the sort of thing I mean. Draco has not only the right, but the
"Perhaps you should," Draco murmured, bringing his own mouth closer. His lips parted before Potter's moist breath, anticipating his taste.  So hot...
"That was my firmest criteria. They could send me to England, to some man I had never met, but if he wasn't a good dancer, I would have nothing further to do with it."
"Nah," Harry said modestly. "Some friends of mine did." He followed Zabini up the iron steps, only absently noticing how Ernie was staring. "Let's find an empty compartment."
"And the captains of our respective teams," Draco informed her, apparently tempted out of silence by the opportunity to tout his importance.
“This is all dependent on his condition, and the conversation must be less grim,” Pomfrey admonished. “We are trying to keep him comfortable. Mr. Malfoy is acceptable for now.”
"No. Well, he would have," Harry amended quickly at Sirius's glower, "but I got off a Stupefaction hex first, so whatever he cast went over."
"What?" Canceling the glamour, Harry pushed back the hood of his cloak to meet her eyes. "Look, why would I--"
"Really. I wasn't drinking, I wasn't off the grounds, I wasn't doing Dark Arts.... It is none of your business."
After a moment's hesitation, Draco nodded. "Agreed.  For now, this isn't a secret, but it's just gossip -- an oddity. Spread it in whispers, if at all. Harry, Hermione, and I will talk to Dumbledore." The Gryffindors looked to Harry, and the Slytherins to Draco, but within a few seconds, everyone had nodded. Linnet and Blaise headed back to the castle in silent proximity, and Dean left with Ginny, whispering. Ron and Millicent lingered.
"Bribery, embezzlement, and concealing affairs from a jealous partner," Draco said succinctly. "Of these, my father advised me that it is of greatest effectiveness in bribery, because the subject
"The letter." Harry understood what she wanted now. She had answers from someone -- probably the Aurors -- but not enough information to make sense of them. "Voldemort told me that he had not authorized this attack, and if he had, he would have sent someone more competent. He said the head was for me, to share his, um, 'latest amusement.'"
"Report to my office in the morning, with whatever you've got." He grinned. "Not too early, just morning."
"I'm not sure. But whilst home, I wished to use it, and applying your lessons, examined it first. I am quite certain it has at least two layers of protective curses."
When the last student had left, Harry was not surprised that Snape waved the door closed and cast privacy charms on it.
Draco relaxed. He caught at Harry's hand and let him to the chairs. "Once it's underway, I promise -- dinner anywhere you like.  For tonight, I've ordered a good meal -- as good as this place can manage, at least -- to share in private."
With a glance over at Draco, Harry dug in his pocket again, and pulled out the marble that had once been a portkey. "Draco.  Make me a glass, would you, please?"
"Nothing huge, I'm sorry to say, but yes. We're making progress. We have small, but significant, fragments of evidence that Pettigrew is alive, as you know, and the investigation has been reopened, but it's stalled. While there are provisions to use Veritaserum on convicted criminals -- so we're fairly sure he's alive -- there is no way to force someone to extract a memory, which we'd need to distribute a quality sketch.  I'm here to ask you if you'd be willing to provide a pensieved memory of your encounters with Pettigrew."
"Which makes losing a few hours of Saturday not as bad either," Harry pointed out. "Why don't we decide for each week, based on what's going on then?"
Malfoy stepped close, so close that his shirt brushed lightly against Harry's, but Harry refused to look. He wasn't intimidated. Malfoy wouldn't kill him. He wouldn't dare.
Remembering how Draco had practically crackled with Dark energy after his tutoring session with Snape, last spring, Harry frowned. "What did you do with Draco? Before Easter, last year?"
He waved to the door. Turning towards it brought back all of Harry's annoyance at his upcoming confinement. Pushing that down, he paused, hand on the latch, and turned.
"I believe you will find my brewing facilities adequate," Draco volunteered in a bored tone. "Not to your standards, of course -- nothing ever is -- but adequate to the purpose."
"Harry!" Hermione darted past Ron and into the room. "I'd thought that must be it! You need to let him stop experimenting on you."
Julian laughed. "Love the name!" With a sunny grin and a deferential nod to Draco, he shook Harry's hand, and then stepped past to hold his hand out to Susan. She and Caradog had arrived a few minutes earlier. "Good evening, Miss Bones," he said, bowing over hers. "A pleasure to see you. Socially, I mean." He hesitated. "This is socially, isn't it?"
Just then, the instructor dashed into the room. His brown hair was mussed, and his robes askew. He tugged them quickly into place and gave the class a quick smile.
germane to the subject, after all.  But I'll need to be able to leave early if they become agitated."
To his surprise, Ron scowled, crossing his arms over his chest. "Well, she won't be much of a wife, then, will she?"
Getting back in bed was easier said than done. He couldn’t lift up on his toes at all, and she had to lower it for him. She applied liniment from a small jar to his lower legs and then pulled the curtain so he could do his thighs and buttocks himself.
Saturday morning dawned overcast and windy. Harry didn't like it. A fresh wind could make flying more exhilarating, but this was the sort of blustery, biting November gale that made it hard to keep hold of a broom. As captain, he felt responsible for the other members of the team, and he couldn't help feeling a little anxious in this sort of weather. He would be fine himself, of course. And the players from last year had been through this before. The only new members were Ron and Ginny, he realized, and felt better immediately. Both of them could take a lot.
Draco looked up. With a flash of irritation, he stretched an arm past Hermione to hand the device to Harry. "Here," he said.  "Have a look."
"Couldn't finish without you." With a coy wink, Malfoy reached out and took the diaphanous garment, and then carried it off to his room. Eugene leaned back against the wall and waited. Harry tried not to growl.
"Yeah, that would make it easier, wouldn't it?" With a final light slap to Draco's arse, Harry made his decision. "Up. Back on your heels."
"What? Oh, yeah!" Harry hadn't thought of it that way. "Yeah, she was a University student, if you believe her ID."  Harry decided he might as well tell the bones of the story; at this rate, it would be better than letting Millicent make one up to match the few facts she knew. "I flew down in my invisibility cloak and took her rucksack up to where we were picnicking. After that, it turned into sort of Muggle show-and-tell.  She had textbooks and a calculator and an electric torch and make-up and a lighter and cigarettes, and then all the things in her wallet."
Snape, to Harry's irritation and relief, rolled his eyes.  "Nothing is wrong, Potter; I merely thought we had limited time. Are you hurt?"
The dog bounded in, tongue lolling out. As soon as the door shut behind him, he turned into a man. As always, Harry envied and admired that easy, casual change of form. He was wearing Muggle clothes, Harry noted: black jeans that had faded at his seat and knees and above a wallet; and a loose-woven collared shirt that brought out the blue in his eyes. His hair fell over the collar only at the back, and his face was tanned.
"In your own bed, in Slytherin," Malfoy answered, his voice still gentle. "Do you need a little distraction?"
"This really is quite lovely." She trailed a hand over the stone sideboard, on her way to the sofas, where she hesitated.
had Wormtail create a new body for him, my blood was in the potion, along with dust from his father's bones, and Wormtail's severed arm."
Slowly, Millicent's confused look brightened. She straightened. "Yeah. Good thought. It's bound to be awkward at first."
had applied to the MLE research division. After his father was killed? Harry checked the date and thought back. No, it would have been about a month before. That was 1999, and he remembered it was in December, because he had been Christmas shopping when he was called in for the meeting. Reading on, he saw the application had been tossed upstairs multiple times -- no one wanted to approve a possible Death Eater sympathizer. Despite Malfoy's assertions that working for Voldemort had been the worst year of his life and had entirely changed his outlook, his first interviewer had pointed out that he knew several fugitives personally. Kendall, the new head at the time of the application, had actually interviewed him again, and his comments were mostly positive. He had passed the application on to Kingsley for advice, and it looked like Kingsley had never responded. Of course, he'd been busy with reforming the Ministry at that point. Harry shook his head. At least this one wasn't the curse; Malfoy would have withdrawn his application after his father died in Auror custody.
Harry started to shake his head, but then gave that up as a bad idea. "I doubt it. Draco and Blaise and Millicent and I were watching each other's drinks, so any additions would have been friendly."
Harry glanced over to where Julian was choking down some Skelegrow, and grimacing, nodded. "Okay. She, er, was saying I'd be fine, but I think there was a 'but' there."
A slender blond girl launched herself at him in a surprising fury of thrashing limbs. Harry laughed more while he tried to grab enough to pin her.
"Great. The rest of you get flowers and I get a poison." He laughed. "Actually, I bet that's what Malfoy wanted it for, not some hokey love divination--" Harry's eyes widened.
The walk from Hogsmeade, Harry thought, had brought Ron down from tipsy to mellow. He seemed clear on everything, but he didn't tense as Draco explained the procedure again.
Harry had never come through a portkey still balanced, but this time, he was drawing his wand as the world resolved around him. He was still on his broom and Malfoy was still under the dragon, but they were in a large cavern, down a steep, short slope from a wide strip of lit sky. No one else seemed to be present. The dragon dropped Malfoy and rattled out the door, temporarily blocking the light. Malfoy moaned.
Snape's mouth twisted. "Of course not. However, the disorientation of being immersed in such delirium should buy us some time. We were in luck Wednesday night; several of us were meeting outside the school when Lupin received the signal--"
She snorted. "He wants time for his studies, I expect. We read one of his recent articles in Arithmancy, and I can imagine that Hogwarts might be a touch dangerous during the summer. There was a humorous aside about how the roof of the West Tower was overdue for replacement anyway."
"In part. A Muggle with glamours and Polyjuice and an invisibility cloak for when I crossed back into our world. I came into Diagon Alley a few times, and Knockturn Alley twice."
Cornelia laughed. Draco passed a plate with some rounds of bread and Cheddar to Millicent, and wordlessly drew Ginny's attention to the cheese. He loitered by the drinks until everyone had food of some sort, and then started over to the sofa, in conversion with Cornelia about why she had decided to switch positions. When he was at one end of the sofa, and Cornelia in one of the chairs, Harry followed, Millicent and Ginny posturing amiably as they trailed behind him.
While he was drawing on clothes, an explanation for the name occurred to him. Perhaps he was actually in the body of another person, someone who didn't exist in his world. That would explain how he could be related to Snape, and also why he had reacted so strongly to Malfoy. It wasn't just that Malfoy was talented; it was probably that he was in the body of someone who was gay, so really, nothing he did could count. Nodding to himself, Harry stood and found that the trousers were slightly big at the waist, and pooled slightly over the boots, but only slightly.
Leroy laughed. "Score one for you. Octavius married a Danish girl, left her at home most of the time -- someone needs to watch the Krups, you know -- and was eventually photographed with his hands all over the young man who was living on his yacht -- reputedly for money."
She had the sword laid out on the table tonight, along with a chunk of bark from the tree Harry had struck, and she was trying another run of diagnostic spells on the two in combination. She could see that the sword had Opening magic, and suspected the effort was futile. It was what the sword had
"Faster than an actual bird, fortunately," Remus said, turning back to the shelves over the sink to take down a teapot.  "Severus may fume, but he'll accept it. Sit down, Harry; the chairs are cleaner than that wall you're leaning against."
"Loyal," Draco added. "I often thought Crabbe and Goyle should have been Hufflepuffs. They didn't have any real ambitions of their own."
"Right." That was less reassuring than Harry had hoped. "Well, I'll talk to Professor Hecksban about it, if that's all right."
"Ah." Harry drew his wand. "Shall I cast it anyway, then?" He grinned. "Not that I'll be able to tell if it works -- a glamour that makes you look exactly like you do now."
In the seconds she was speechless, he took the few steps to her bed, and threw himself down on it with a bounce, then, just as quickly, twisted back to sick up. Harry lunged and got Hermione's waste bin in the path of it.
Without even checking the corridor, he ducked out of the room and headed back to the stairs. Harry told himself it was okay; they'd talked, and it was done.
Harry looked over at Tonks. "The thing is, I don't think a person's house says that much about their character," he admitted. "I know too many people who argued the Sorting Hat into changes, and even more that I believe it Sorted on their name or expectation alone."
Ron looked about him at the comfortable furniture and small tables. "Right. Seamus said something about this."
Curious now, Harry did as he was instructed. Draco came over to sit on the sofa. "Hm," he said. "That's quite a lot of glass. Let's see...."
By the time Millicent's alarm spell activated, she had managed to make her oversized woman's shoe look more a man's blunt-toed work shoe. The glamour wavered a little when she moved it, but that could wait a few lessons, Harry decided.
"We mostly use given names here," Luna said agreeably. "Hello, Hermione. I'm curious to meet you out of the classroom."
Snape's testimony went on until the lunchtime recess, when Tonks once again escorted them -- or Draco, really, Harry reminded himself -- from the courtroom. Before they made it through the doors, a spectator -- not in somber Wizengamot garb, but in elegant robes of soft cream that were both feminine and modest in cut -- moved down the seats to intercept them.
"But I wanted to tell you," Harry said urgently, "Cornelia wants the Beater slot.  Keeper's position is open now."
chair -- he did feel undeniably possessive of it now -- Harry approached hers and cautiously stroked the wood.  It felt the same as the first one had; milder, if anything. Again, he moved close in, sinking down into the curse that flowed along the grain. He didn't understand the trigger, but he twisted the malice to face the other way, and felt it settle.
As they crossed from the slate floor of the kitchen to the wood plank of the new addition, Harry guessed that Draco expected to be taken to their bedroom.  Indeed, he had to tug twice to get Draco to turn down the corridor instead.
Gilbert raised his hand immediately, as if he were in a lesson, and Caradog and Linnet followed his lead. Harry supposed that made sense. The sixth years who weren't in Gryffindor wouldn't have spent time with her.
He waved a hand in front of Ron's face, and Ron's entire body twitched. "Merlin!" he swore, licking splashed beer off his hand. "Don't sneak up on me like that!"
"Oh, you got a package.  From Professor Lupin. It looks like books, or something." He grinned.  "Seamus tried to peek and ended up with hairy hands for the evening. Some of the kids were panicking -- thought he was turning into a werewolf from touching the same twine -- so I used the Classification spells from Cursebreaking. It was brilliant!" His hands chopped spaces in the air.  "Minor hex; wand-cast. 'There,' I said. 'It's just a prank.'"
After a long moment of no one saying anything, Harry felt his shoulders start to relax down. He hadn't realized how tightly he had been holding himself. Deliberately, he let his bum rest back against the hard sideboard, fleetingly noticing that even that pressure didn't hurt. "So," he said. "Thoughts?"
-- and just happens to take out Slytherins who won't back off applying. It was Lucius Malfoy making sure his son wouldn't work for the people who were beating him to death." He stood up, pacing to the wall and back. "The time works. It works exactly.  December 1999."
"Wait here." Eugene went back into his room, emerging a minute later with an armful of fabric. He flipped it out of its bundle and held it up, vaguely in front of his own body, displaying gauzy, multi-layered robes in soft turquoise and blue, which grew more transparent closer to the floor. "There. Won't it look lovely with your pale gold and pink?"
"Well, then," he said cheerily. "Just let me reset the password on the door, and we can get started."
wasn't that important anymore. "Then don't let me detain you further," he said haughtily. He tossed down two Sickles on the counter and hoped he was trusted enough here to get away with it. It was almost enough, and he couldn't bear to stand here any longer after having been so thoroughly humiliated.
Auror Shacklebolt flooed into the parlor. He was followed by last night's junior Auror and by a cheery-looking pink-haired witch. To Harry's surprise, the witch was also wearing Auror robes. He would have expected, had he ever thought about it, that the MLE would be too conservative for hair like that. To Harry's embarrassment, she spotted his stare, flashed him a grin, and walked directly over. Harry was afraid that she would make a fuss over him, but instead, she gave Draco a brisk nod and a bright smile.
"Er, yes?" Harry tried. He put the book aside.  "Nothing I can't read later, though." He reached for the phial Malfoy was holding, but the girl pulled it back.
Snape appeared at their side. Everyone else, it seemed, had left. "Are you unable to place your scales in your school bag, Potter?"
Harry hesitated. He wanted to say no, that his devotion to a child -- and he was fairly sure it would be devotion -- would not extend to its other parent, but he wasn't sure it would work that way. "No women," he said instead, and was rewarded by seeing Draco's tension ebb. "So, does that eliminate all the werewolves we know?"
The voice faded behind Harry as the stairway descended. It felt much better than being ushered out in silence. He wondered if the sequence of bells informed Kingsley of how much could be said.
Harry didn't want an explanation of what he thought Ron was babbling about. From what he could tell, hardly anyone ever did that, anyway. Certainly no one he knew did.
Millicent was lying on her back on the comfy sofa, with her feet -- still in heavy work boots -- up on one arm of it. She had dissolved her glamour, and her shoulders were massive when she twisted to look at him.
"A good choice," Draco affirmed, before Harry could get a word out. "She expects that, if she has half the sense I think she does, and she probably anticipates Ron as your other ally. Choose a Slytherin instead."
Harry nodded. "Neither was I, really." He looked down at the bench they were sitting on. "Is it too soon to ask you for favors, then?"
Harry had expected him to know. On the other hand, Tonks hadn't been with him as a work assignment, so maybe it made sense that he didn't. Like Snape, she had emphasized the need to keep the visit secret beforehand. "Narcissa Malfoy invited me to their Midwinter Ball. I think she wanted to meet her son's lover. Is this official?"
Throughout the day, Harry had been thinking about how to get a few minutes alone with Snape, before seeing him with Draco along. When Draco went up to ask Professor Hecksban a question after their Cursebreaking lesson, he dropped a brief note in Draco's school bag and slipped out.
"Right. But by the time I got there, he'd taken enough of her life to start forming his old body -- the one he had at sixteen, when he wrote the diary."
"Millicent's right," Harry shot back angrily. "Poison isn't Gryffindor's style. On the other hand, I'm not sure I trust your glass."
His body stiffened momentarily under Harry's ministrations, and he abruptly curled up to stare. "Oh," he said, flopping down again. "You. Merlin."
"How do you have the name Parkinson, then?"  Astoria objected. "If it was only her and her sister left alive?"
"Your torclinde is violating her pose, Potter," someone remarked scornfully. Harry glanced over. It was Cassandra Vere. Julian Devary, looking nervous, and Astoria Greengrass, looking amused, were near her. The others still trailed behind.
"She's in, then?" he asked, although he knew he could ask her directly in a few hours, when they met for her glamour.
"The game. They lost both Seekers, both Contrivances, and both captains. Do you think they've called a break until we're back?"
"Yeah." Harry couldn't very well deny that.  "But you ... I don't know ... smell wrong, or something? I felt like we'd end up fighting, and I was trying so hard...." He stopped, uncomfortable, and Malfoy frowned.
Hannah blushed and said she had never had a long conversation with someone whilst pretending she knew who they were, immediately giving the lie to the statement with a misty blue bead. She seemed cheered by the number of others that were taken, by everyone except Millicent and Cornelia -- who probably wouldn't bother -- and Gilbert -- who probably couldn't forget someone's name if he tried -- and Luna, who just wouldn't think to be less than sincere.
"I wanted to be sure you didn't have guests," Harry corrected, swinging the cloak off completely. "You promised, and I trust Sirius, but--"
Though tailing Creevy, he thought, was hardly better. Now if he could spy on Potter talking to Creevy....
"Oh. Um -- so I was sent into another world," Harry said. "And the people there tried to send me back, but I ended up in
Harry wondered what he would say when they stopped with enough privacy for conversation, but Draco drew him to long sideboard that was covered with half-unwrapped bundles, and began pulling them open, spilling out little toys and ornaments and other small things. As he started on the third, Harry picked up a hair clip. It was well made, but surprisingly plain.
He went up to the second floor immediately, and around a couple corners to where he had left Creevy. To his surprise, the younger boy was not waiting in the corridor. He came closer, and at the sound of he footsteps, Creevy emerged from the broom closet in which they had left Thornton.
Harry ran his mouth over Draco's neck, and up to the graceful curves of his ear. "I have had every indication that it will."
"Blood of man, blood of vine, blood of earth, all combine," she chanted, and the two thick substances mingled in ugly swirls, spiraling fully around the vessel before she lifted her wand. As they stilled, the change started. The grey lines blurred into the red, and together they altered, becoming a single liquid, transparent and ruby-bright. Once again, Harry could see the lines of tarnish in the silver at the bottom of the bowl, but now they seemed to move and twist, almost as if they were about to form into a picture. If he could just get a little closer....
Harry felt his blood rising at the thought. "I don't actually have a whip," he answered contrarily. He smiled. "Not a proper one, although I have considered it. What I used on you was a flogger."
Harry had to twist Nature all the way to Dark to get the writhing Pensieve to center. Means was unambiguously at Physical. The flickering left by that alignment subsided as he moved Intensity higher and higher, finally vanishing as he reached the final click. Swallowing, he closed his eyes and lifted the Hexacles off.
"Hm." Draco set down the marble on the table, and gave it a tap. It spun as if it was on a potter's wheel rather than under his wand. He drew the tip up, and the glass rose around it into a curving bowl, with the snake underneath. Another slow draw up from where the glass met the table gave the vessel a wide foot and a short stem with the tail of the black snake curled around it. He slowed the spin and coaxed the head of the snake half-way up the bowl. Because of the size of the marble, the whole thing was small, but not quite as small as Harry had expected.
"Snape seems to know a lot of things. When my parents were dead, and Pettigrew supposed to be, and Sirius in jail -- and that betrayal meant Voldemort prob--"
"How about Apparating?"  Susan suggested. Everyone turned and looked at her. "Well, if the curse is on the doorway...."
"Yes, yes, of course," Dumbledore said brightly. "I'm afraid it slipped my mind in making introductions. I am accustomed to setting my students at ease, of course."
Draco turned away, as if the grey sky outside his window was fascinating. "I know. That doesn't make it easier. Talk about something else, Harry. Do you have plans for your birthday?"
, Draco! I love Quidditch, and I like winning, and, honestly, I'm still angry with her, some, but I decided last June that
Harry did not push back against the mattress when Malfoy set about touching his new breast as he'd been told. Instead, he dropped his hand to his groin, and began to squeeze his cock through robes and trousers, timing each motion to match that of Malfoy's hand. He heard his breath come out in a shaky rush, but the others seemed not to have noticed.  Malfoy's foot was dragging across Eugene's lap as his knee bent. Harry wondered if it was pulling across Eugene's cock.
"Oh," Harry said, unable to express how good that felt. He coasted along the peak of his expectation for a breathless, extended moment, and then, exhaling, pushed back. That smooth intrusion came further in, and he was stretched more, with just a slight, sharp feeling around the rim.
Hermione shoved Harry, Susara's mangled body suddenly stiff in his hands, toward the door. "That will prevent damage from progressing for ten minutes. Get her to Madam Pomfrey -- she can help animals."
She laughed at that, and settled. Ginny and Ron had parted quickly, in good cheer. Harry suspected they were off to get hats and gloves.
Privately, Harry thought Madam Pomfrey might be easier to deal with, but at least Dumbledore wasn't giving him detention to match Ron's.
"Yes. I mentioned Hermione specifically." Draco smiled at her. "You'll need to stay out of the library, I'm afraid. Many of the books are restricted to specific bloodlines, and my ancestors were not
Draco shrugged, as if his heart were not pounding in his chest. "I have plans," he lied. "But this is the only way to start with him."
"Quite. However...."  He let Harry sweat for a few breaths before continuing. "There is another issue that Albus did see fit to inform your godfather about ... some matter of showing up drunk to Professor McGonagall's office?"
"If he knew someone who was already using it." Draco sneered slightly. "I might, perhaps, know who."
The school week passed without incident. A few times more, Hermione remarked on Harry's beads, but she never asked an actual
Auror Tonks nodded. "I think that will do for today, then. I expect that Ron Weasley would be able to provide us with a picture of this rat?"
The password today was Blood Pops, which Harry found a bit disturbing. They rode the spiral staircase up to the antechamber and found the door to the office open. Dumbledore, standing next to Fawkes, turned as they arrived.
"Oh, you might not notice all of them," Harry said. Draco shot him a look, and Harry was glad he had explained that conversation to him previously.
"Mm," Malfoy said. Harry froze. The position had brought his erection against Malfoy's arse. He thought he should be jerking back, but it felt too good. Then Malfoy rocked his hips back and forth, and it felt better. Harry ground down, pressing his clothed shaft into Malfoy's crack.
"Oh, not directly," Draco said airily.  "Those are quite powerful ... and frightfully expensive. You soak them in a distillate and use that."
Harry trailed his touch around to Draco's arse, sliding a finger lightly up his crack. Draco responded with a promising shiver. "Say 'fuck me, please.'"
"Le'er ou'" Harry slurred. His lids dipped down and he forced them up again. Susara was on his chest, lying still. Hermione had apparated to the other side of the bed. "Galle'n."
Taking another painfully deep breath, Harry reminded himself that this was for Sirius. He needed to worry about his testimony, not hypothetical attacks. Well, his testimony and the lack of a loo.
The next day was Sunday. Harry slept through breakfast, had lunch early, and slipped away for an afternoon of brewing with Millicent. They spent some of the cooling time talking about Nott senior. Throughout the week, the
"I don't have any! I just don't want to be the cause of any more deaths, even if they aren't really my fault. And you probably would have had me go to the Burrow next, and then the Weasleys wouldn't have been safe."
"Education," Harry said firmly. "If you are going to attempt to change my personality, you should at least learn what it is."
"Now," Tonks said cheerily, as she took the empty glass from him, "this is the monitoring room. Once the monitors arrive, I will take you into the interrogation room. Everything that happens there is recorded and part of department record, so potentially of public record."
Despite the unusually terse manner, Harry had no doubt this was Dumbledore. Without hesitation, he took the powder, threw it on the fire, and stepped in, calling out "Hogwarts Headmaster's office," as instructed. This close, the usual sweeping ride of the Floo connection was compressed almost to stepping through a door -- except for the exit. Rather then being pushed out with such force that he had to stumble forward to keep his balance, he was thrust into air the consistency of syrup, and had to strain to continue towards the wavy golden vision of Dumbledore's office, with three chairs arranged by the fire, and a House Elf clearing tea things away. Harry wondered if he might have been tricked.
"Believe me, darling -- I wouldn't have you do even that if I didn't think you were basically competent."
"Well," Draco said finally. "I think we had better determine what the esteemed headmaster is doing to you."
“Terrible muscle tension,” she said. “You need a liniment for that, and then to move carefully. Back in bed, now, and I’ll let you go once it’s applied.”
"I'll do it." His drying and warming charms were not constrained to Harry's shoes, and Harry felt better after them. "And step in here." He ushered Harry into a small audience chamber next to the cloakroom, and set the fire going with a spell. "Brr.  I've been standing in the wind by that gate for ages!" Nudging one of the armchairs closer to the fire, he gestured to the other. "Pull up a chair."
Professor Hecksban’s powder didn’t just flare this time – it shot out in lines toward Harry. Sparks of pain answered in his legs. The professor met his eyes briefly, and then glanced toward Draco.
"Right." Harry pushed himself upright, and swung his legs off the side of the bed. It made him only a little dizzy. "Let's go."
Harry bit his lip at the obvious reprimand. It wasn't as if he hadn't thought of that, he just didn't think it would work. "After last year, I doubt she'll--"
"Not so much, as trimmings will do, though they need to be fresh, but it's mostly used for, uh, getting it up." Her face reddened. "For blokes that can't, you know."
"Well, no," Draco objected. "It isn't. We also know that the Dark Lord's new body has no nose, for example, but that does us no good."
A flash of gold shooting towards him fitted into thoughts of flying. Doubt came fast, but not as fast as honed Seeker's reflexes. Harry was already snapping his arm out to grab the tiny Snitch, his body moving too quickly to stop. The arm around his shoulders tightened, and Draco threw his weight back, pulling him away. Harry crashed to the ground on top of him, kicking Professor Flitwick in passing and bruising his shoulder on the edge of the bench. Around them, people were shouting and moving. An orange hex shot overhead.
"But it's so easy to fall behind...!" For a moment, she lifted her hands in front of her face. "I know," she said, her face still hidden. "I know I shouldn't panic yet, but...."
"Yes, but it's Ron," Harry explained. "Doing our divination, I mean. And since Scabbers was his rat -- well, sometimes things with us end up in there too."
"Seven years ago, the government didn't want to hire Slytherins, and most Slytherins were too angry or afraid to apply. There were a few accidents, and people came up with this idea of a curse, so no one had to try too hard. It's not true. Saturday, I get my Auror robes and
Draco pushed himself up on one elbow, and Severus saw him. Harry paused, stopping to brush his hand over the pink lines he was leaving on Severus's back. He continued the touch down his thigh again, and then forward. Severus whined as Harry rubbed over his cock.
"Hold it," Harry said, throwing a warning glare at Blaise, who smirked. "Calm down." He smiled apologetically at Seamus. "They think anything I do must be the way of Gryffindors."
Draco snorted. "Ravenclaws are less boisterous," he pointed out. "And my housemates, of course, adapted."
Her breath came out in a whoosh of relief. "There was a blur after you wished you didn't," she confessed.
"Definitely not yours," he affirmed, before looking back to Ron. "So, how is your schoolwork going? It's odd only having you in three of my classes."
"My dear boy, not at all!" Dumbledore replied, beaming, as he rose to shake Harry's hand. "You are always welcome to visit. Is there anything else you wish to discuss?"
Ernie's voice carried over the gusts. "Gryffindor scores! Twenty to naught, Gryffindor in possession-- Oh! Now Slytherin in possession. Nott diving under-- OUCH! A hit!  Former keeper, Cornelia Carter, has certainly taken to her new position! Gryffindor in possession, Greengrass moving in--"
"And imagine the advances he could make in his research with first-hand experience of the Wolfsbane potion."
Embarrassed, Harry pushed a hand back through his hair. "Well, you know half his ideas are, well, good. Draco just had two of his best moon recoveries ever."
"Is there a reason why you're here?" Harry asked Remus. "I mean, not that it's not nice to see you, but term doesn't end until tomorrow. Is something wrong?"
As they rounded the last corner, coming in sight of the mirror, she glanced over at him, but to her credit, still said nothing. On the other side of the glass, she added her wandlight to his. Harry closed the door. Draco, he reflected, was either not here yet, or was waiting dramatically in the dark.
Others were arriving now. Some people set bags where they wanted to sit first, while others went straight to the food. Harry watched contentedly while they greeted each other and settled.  When the last person had sat (it was Caradog today), Harry stood up and clapped his hands twice, like a professor about to start a lesson.
"No," she said, her voice scraping her throat.  "As far as we know, he's fine, and just can't find us."
"Oh, we don't care if you beat Hufflepuff," he responded. "They have an excellent team, this year. Please, keep their score low for us."
Harry winced. "No, I'd meant--" It hadn't occurred to him that Neville might take the phrase critically. His face would always tend to roundness, but years of the stairs to Gryffindor tower had compressed much of his fat to muscle. "Honestly, Neville -- you haven't been overly heavy in years."
"Your office, sir," Harry said, pleased to be offered a choice. More significantly, the headmaster did not argue the point.
Ron nodded, but pointed his wand at the bowl. He gave a tiny little jab forward, like a fencer who meant only to offer insult, and whispered, "
in her bag as he entered the room. He didn't ask to see it. The sick dread in his stomach probably left him better able to behave than the anger that would replace it.
Indeed, the top photo was of Voldemort, and the second of Narcissa. Harry didn't recognize the next man, and the woman after that was someone he thought might have been at the ball, but hadn't had any interaction with. The next one made him snort.
"I...." Harry took a deep breath and turned to face him. "I'm not the Harry you know. I ... I started a chain of timeline hops -- I mean, I went into some other Harry's place, and that one went somewhere else, and then when I tried to go home, I went to the place he had been, which wasn't home--"
Harry had been going to stay out of it, but he felt he had to weigh in here. "In some cases, people may not even know what will be a problem for someone else."
Harry reached Draco's cock and ran his open mouth up the velvet skin, listening in satisfaction to Draco's quick exhale and following moan. Hands touched his head and left, only to return again, clenching in his hair as he took the hard length in his mouth.
"We've met up since. I mean, she wasn't unprofessional or anything. She wanted to get to know her cousin."
"Oh, you don't want to know," Draco replied, with false lightness. "We got a bit kinky that's all. And I'd quite forgotten -- telling Harry his boy was his best girl -- I'd just been offended at the time."
"Er, um--" Harry thought frantically. "Streeler shell for color matching. Wood spirits. Fluxseed oil to dilute the Dragons' blood to legal concentrations. Erumpet hide and ironwood for the shell. Fairy cocoon silk for--"
"Ah. They will certainly do." The solicitor's sharp eyes flicked over him like a blade, as they took their places at the table. The seating reminded Harry uncomfortably of their tea with Dumbledore in the greenhouse, but Clark couldn't have been less like the old headmaster. He was dark-haired and sharp in features and language, and dressed conservatively in charcoal robes with black trim. Nothing about him soothed or amused.
"Good. We should be able to reach Slytherin before them.  Discussion that they should be exposed to can be in front of them without appearing planned; after that, we'll go to my room."
She started a recording device -- a sort of floating ball -- and she went quickly through the motions of requesting pensieved testimony and a limited Veritaserum interview. He still asked about the parameters -- he thought he'd look like a fool if he didn't -- but the matter was quickly concluded. In a few minutes, they were riding the circular staircase down.
"Hermione?" Draco's settled back on his heels, his eyes narrowing as he studied Harry. His voice slowed to a haughty drawl. "Do tell."
"Of course," Snape answered, setting knife and fork down on the verge of his plate. "Harry informed me that the Credulity curse was overly effective on Miss Granger, and that he had told you of his use of it, so that he might request your assistance in countering the matter discreetly."
"Now come here," he said, over his shoulder. Harry approached cautiously. He couldn't see Malfoy's mouth, but his cheek lifted with a hidden smile. "I just want you to touch me," Malfoy coaxed.  "Sit on the bed. Long strokes, everywhere. Don't worry about pleasing me, yet. Just explore."
"Hexed you and turned you over to the headmaster, more like," Harry retorted. He didn't think Draco had ever called him "darling" before. He sounded like Pansy. "Though, yeah. We never would have become friends if I'd seen you cast a curse like that beforehand."
, people will assume that Severus doesn't wish to say, implying that he is protecting someone -- possibly himself, or perhaps you or a third party."
Harry grinned. "A marble." He fished the item out of his bag. "And it didn't do anything to me, but he seemed surprised by that."
as well, but Parvati had been furious and shouted at Eugene about caving in. "You just can't handle being a girl!" she yelled, and Eugene had replied, with a cold, precise nod, "Exactly."
Harry didn't hear the third item. The blood in his ears drowned out everything around him. He stared across the room at Draco, and Draco stared back, but they did not spontaneously develop telepathy. The second-floor bathroom! If they couldn't get in there, how would they get down to the Chamber of Secrets? Harry didn't believe it was chance. Dumbledore must know what he was doing.
"All right there, Ron?" Harry asked carefully. He set his free hand on the floor and let Susara glide back into his robes. She went all the way up to his neck, which was one of her favorite spots when she was cold -- or anxious.
There had been another attack on his parents' graves -- also unsuccessful, but even more dramatic, as the phantasms from Severus's potion had sent at least one attacker into delirium, flooding the usually quiet cemetery with 3 AM screams of terror and rage. In response to urgent reports from a neighbor, the Department of Spirit Management had sent out a representative to orient and register the assumed new ghost, and the Ghost Greeter argued precedence with a swarm of Aurors who would give no information until someone connected the dots and realized who she was and why she was there. If it had been in some other story, Harry would have laughed.
Nott grimaced. "He started hanging out with Potter, and Potter's always in trouble. He's been drunk at school, and he spent half of last spring being punished for leaving the grounds, and everyone knows --"
After lunch the next day, armed with a hip flask of Polyjuice, his Invisibility Cloak, his school list, and a fresh knowledge of how to tie Muggle alarm systems in knots, he went down to Flourish & Blotts to check out the required texts for Cursebreaking and Symbology.
"Not for long," Harry answered, dropping his robes. He was wearing an old T-shirt, which was unfortunate; if he'd been planning for this, he would have worn the green silk. Still, he unzipped his jeans and pulled out his swollen cock, sliding his hand along it as Draco had wanted. Draco stared, his eyes wide. "I just wanted a little time to feel all of how much I want you. Touch is so fast."
"Disturbing to watch, though," Draco volunteered, in face of Hermione's unease. "He was trailing a claw up one arm, like he might cut himself open on a whim. As soon as it was in, I had him do a grounding exercise -- an infinity symbol with Lumos, changing color at each upward cross."
"Ah." Harry felt the hairs behind the touch rise, sending sensation up his scalp. He stretched back into the contact.
"Ah." Harry ran a finger along the floor, getting dirt under the nail. "And when do you start needing glamours?"
Harry thought that he was expected to laugh, but he couldn't manage it. He forced a sickly smile and stuffed some toast into his mouth to obscure his dismay.
"But...." Draco twisted the soft bread in his hands -- "why correspond with me? If it wasn't for.... I suppose I thought of it as closure."
Draco, he knew, could hear him opening drawers and shifting things within them, and walking back. He wouldn't know what Harry had selected, though -- an exciting departure from Harry's usual toys. Harry felt that the kitchen ought to have a plethora of useful implements, but he wasn't finding much to his liking. He tried a bamboo skewer against his bared arm, but it didn't have the sting that he had expected. The wooden spatula would probably work, but he wanted something more pliant. Perhaps he wasn't in the right mood for innovation.
Gilbert's eyebrows arched up. "Having not been caught," he said haughtily, "I am scarcely inclined to provide details."
He was talking about divination, Harry thought. He looked at Ron's tense expression, reconsidered, and then reached the same conclusion again.
"The one that keeps the Ministry -- well, at least four departments of it -- from being able to hire Slytherins?"
"More or less," Seamus said amiably, setting a worn text aside and stretching in a yawn. "I'd feel awkward, at least."
The delivery contained nothing too damning, but the quantity of fluxweed would be hard to explain.  Fortunately, the twins had included a large number of samples: Tilt Lines, Babble Drops, and Twister Jacks, as well as more familiar things like Skiving Snackboxes, so Harry had goods from the package to bring down to the Common Room. He unrolled one of the Tilt Lines safely away from the windows and fire, and challenged people to walk on it. When Hermione returned, Sajid was trying to stay on the line for its full two-meter length. He had his arms held out and was teetering madly as he inched down what looked like a stripe of paint on a quiescent carpet. His housemates cheered him on, with those who had already tried it especially enthusiastic in their mixed encouragement and laughter.
"Very good!" The disturbing extra finger sank back into her palm. "I can't even get you on a trick question. How much do you remember?"
"Well, yes, but we'd never met. I suppose she saw me when I was a baby, but you must remember that she had spent most of my life in prison."
have it put about that you are lost. However, your behavior towards the Muggleborn students, over this past week, has been hostile enough to draw comment. Draco brought the matter to my attention earlier, and again today, when you attempted to involve him and Theodore Nott in a scheme to sterilize the Muggle women of a nearby town. We had just determined that you were not, in fact,
Once that plan was set, he recalled the matter of Millicent Bulstrode. He was due to meet her tomorrow, although he had deliberately not set a place. The book shop was a natural location for her to look for him, as that was where they had run into each other before. It would be simple, if he trusted her.
"Well, I woke earlier, but you didn't, so I went back to sleep." Draco yawned slightly. "We must have been up late. I can't, usually." He smiled slowly, that strange, new smile that seemed to be only for Harry. "Or maybe I've never had such a fine pillow."
waltz.  Maybe that's a pureblood thing? You just switch a few times -- at the end of each, um, whatzit. Passage? What would be a verse in a song. You'll know when we get there." The music was starting, and she stepped forward into his arms. "Just turn around, step forward, and bow."
With a long sigh, Draco straightened against the sag of the mattress. "Merlin, but this is miserable!"
"Unclear. They'll be gone at least six weeks, but that was how long she said they might stay." Draco smiled wanly. "She has promised me that I can visit when I'm out of school and she's somewhere I
"Below that, sir," Harry said. Dumbledore tilted the paper and adjusted his half-moon glasses. "I see more of this 'EU' curren-- Oh!" He lifted the paper closer. "Oh, dear."
Remembering talking to Remus and Sirius about Draco, Harry nodded. "My-- Professor Lupin, who was a Gryffindor, thought Draco jumping out the window after me was a clear sign he was in love; he said a Slytherin would have to be. Even so, that was helping me fight Lestrange -- not just getting distracted during a match."
"At another time, I might agree with you. But I have had as many complaints about her in the last ten days as in the previous ten weeks. She broke this; she argued about that; she terrified some passing Hufflepuff children...." Snape stopped at the base of a great oak, and tilted his head back. "This one, perhaps."
"This hearing will continue while we await the arrival of additional Aurors. Professor McGonagall? You may continue to question the witness."
They hissed with harsh pleasure, coiled about each other ... and crumpled under the contact. As Harry stepped forward, the last withered remains fell into dust. He froze.
Harry wasn't surprised when Malfoy slipped something into his bag on his way out of the Potions classroom. He had been waiting for the other shoe to drop since he had woken up on Sunday morning, thinking
Draco shook his head. "Breakfast in Hogsmeade, I think. And then we need to look for some books, and I, at least, need clothes, and a new arm guard for Quidditch -- I took a bad Bludger hit in practice.  Right before we head back, we should buy some wine -- six bottles, perhaps? -- for the Uncommon Room."
Parvati shifted uneasily, but then let out a theatrical sigh. "It wouldn't be fun if we didn't ask anything embarrassing--"
, and some members of my house are angry at me, but what if she'd fallen and died? Then I'd feel worse."
"Challenged her to a stair run -- dungeons to Gryffindor to Entrance Hall to here," Cornelia gasped out, as she dove under the sideboard for something to drink. "She's in better shape than she looks."
"That's not exactly the choice," Hermione answered warningly. "You're not going to be Minister for Magic, Harry."
At Draco's uncertain query, Harry looked up from the picnic basket Dobby had brought. "You can go to the Great Hall if you want," he said. "I just couldn't; everyone looks so sorry for me."
thing he didn't know about Sirius! The House Elf returned, and, at a snap of her fingers, a fresh plate appeared in front of Harry.  Another snap, and something like a roast chicken in miniature appeared on it. The dark glaze on it glistened, and it smelled wonderful. The white mound to the side looked too wet and translucent for mashed potato.
"Hermione," he said firmly. "Not that I don't admire you, darling," he added with a sidelong look at Harry, "but I am going to choose
"No, it's -- I mean, my ability is to take power from Voldemort, right? Snape felt that I could do it with him because of the Dark Mark. But that really doesn't-- well--
Harry followed Draco into a tiny room -- no, a small room that was almost all bed. A glorious bed, at that. It had probably come from Malfoy Manor, and was worth more than the entire flat.
"Yeah, well. Cows." Harry ate a slice of carrot that had been caramelized in the juices from the roast. "Rabbits, now -- they're fun to chase. I think birds are my favorite, though."
"Ah." Snape stood down, his shoulders relaxing fractionally. "Yes. And he would have the clout to get me that, despite her father's will."
After lunch, Dumbledore returned to the trial, and Tonks escorted Harry and Draco back to the Leaky Cauldron.
"Only on the outside! And diluted! And we still had to restrict the top speed, or the wind would set it off."
Millicent, her own copy of the article tucked inside her robes, left them just inside the Entrance Hall. Ron followed them up to the second floor landing. There, he paused and cleared his throat. "Er, would you like another...?"
"Angry?" Snape suggested. "Defensive? Yes, probably. They've picked up on the idea that you are an out-of-control mess."  He shrugged. "By the end of the week, you will no doubt be a healthy young lad having a bit of fun."
"Cover the bottom," she whispered. "Cover...."  For three heartbeats more she steadied his arm, and the blood dripped red and warm, and then, with a soft breath out, she folded his forearm up. "Done."
Dumbledore. Harry wasn't sure if this was rescue or doom. It was sometimes hard to tell with the headmaster.  Today, he strolled into the room looking the part of a charmingly mad great-uncle, with delicate little bells dangling from the braids of his beard.  The bottom foot of his purple brocade robes sparkled with yellow daffodils and darting silver dragonflies, while above, the swirled purple lightened gradually to a medium violet. Harry watched a single silver and gold dragon soar lazily across the headmaster's torso, dip behind his beard and emerge on the other side, only to vanish under his arm. "I surmise," Dumbledore continued placidly, "that it is not a matter of treacle tart or peach trifle."
"I was too busy planning my escape." He shrugged. "Anyway, it wasn't all his fault, you know. I don't do what he wants unless I
"Now, there's no cause for alarm," Tonks said sincerely, "no additional sightings or anything -- but we want to ask you some questions about your encounter with Sirius Black, back in 1994."
Harry waved nebulously at the air. He would need to keep this vague. "Just ... I know a few more of the Slytherins, now. What they want isn't always so simple as money or power."
The door slammed behind them.  Harry felt better immediately. It took a faint whimper from Draco for him to realize his lover was trembling.
"Of course," Neville said quickly. Leaving his things, Neville followed Harry up to the dormitory. As Harry had hoped, it was empty.
"It wasn't a threat! It was a snippet of information. I'm not responsible if they draw the wrong conclusions!"
However, no one did. The Auror standing out of the group watched them, but the rest turned away. Someone had brought a ladder -- or conjured it -- and was climbing up to the top of the gate. Now that they were closer, Harry could see that the object was something oval, and about the size of -- He stopped in his tracks. It was someone's
"I offered to explain things to you, of course. And I told you all about Quidditch, and you thought it sounded brilliant, and I said you should come to Quality Quidditch Supplies with me. Professor Flitwick wasn't keen on it; he asked where my parents were. Quite innocently, I said my mother was picking out a wand for me, and as you can imagine, he rather exploded out of his chair, saying I'd
Tonks stiffened, a small frown line creasing her forehead. "I doubt the Fey would care about such details of human society."
, and that takes precedence at school." Briskly, Snape turned back to his desk. "Now.  You are going to write a letter to the werewolf requesting pertinent educational information. I have quill and parchment ready for you."
Sirius, taking advantage of his handler's laxity, launched himself at Harry, who staggered back against the hall table from the weight of the dog's paws on his shoulders.
"Want to try?" Harry asked her. He wasn't sure if he was more relieved or disappointed when she left in a huff.
"Except he wanted me to win," Harry objected. "That was rather the point. Still, I'd give it to you on being tied up unconscious at the bottom of the Black Lake."
The next morning started out much the same way, except that they stayed in the bedroom. Harry took over the bed with a spread of vampire reports that had been too tedious to correlate before, and Draco lounged across the armchair, reading a weekly. Severus sat cross-legged on his bed and watched with pointed intensity. It was distracting. Eventually, Draco crossed the narrow strip of floor and settled against Harry's side. Severus still watched.
"We had better do, though," he answered, "or he'll chew me out for taking advantage, and he'll move you, maybe back to prison." That little bit of face wrinkled miserably. "On the other hand, I think we'll be able to get away with it after a few weeks, as long as it looks mutual -- I mean, if we've become close enough, and look it."
Blaise, Linnet, and Gilbert arrived next, and then Ginny, Luna, and Neville. Cornelia and Millicent thundered in a minute later, red-faced and panting.
"Rested?" Harry asked incredulously. "Do you know how far up Gryffindor is? And my room is on the top floor of the tower." As Gilbert smirked back, he realized that he may have been giving them an excuse to change their minds about staying. He had probably done as much as he could here, and the longer he stayed, the more likely that Nott would show up. He looked at Draco, who was surveying his housemates in a bored manner.
"Yeah." A light pink crept up Draco's cheeks. "Thank you, Harry. For being here, I mean. For the things that
As he related the publicly consumable account of his interrogation to Ron and Hermione, he noticed that Ron wasn't the only one he needed to talk to. Seamus and Neville had been joined by Cornelia, and when Parvati walked past their spot, Seamus looked away so sharply that Harry was afraid he would hurt his neck. Scanning past Parvati, he found Ginny by the tapestry of a griffin fighting a knight. She frowned pointedly, mouthing something Harry couldn't understand.
Harry sighed. "Maybe. It wasn't settled for several days. I could have told you after that, but I was afraid you'd argue with me, and someone who heard about the invitation would guess what we were fighting about. The last day or two of term, I thought I could, but then-- well, it was never a good time."
The weekend that the shop was open passed without incident, except for Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes making a lot of money. It was the day before that, on Friday, that Harry spotted Ron and Hermione coming out of Slug & Jiggers. He managed to keep from revealing himself, but he followed them all over Diagon Alley, feeling lonelier by the minute, and longing to be back at Hogwarts, where he could both talk to them and be with someone the way they were with each other.
Potter started to nod, and then caught himself. "Good enough. I did need to ask, you understand. Oh, and I suggest you don't meet with him for the next few days."
Esmée, who had gasped at his vulgarity, was now as far back as the curl of the path would allow. Her wide skirts would not permit her to reverse Draco's entrance through the branches.
"As long as he doesn't see this." Malfoy let out a loud breath, and then stilled as Eugene began to stroke a pearlescent lotion across his brow. "He'd make sure everyone knew. Probably send that prat Creevy to take photographs."
Smirking, Mill handed her a glass. "Enjoy your dreams, Carter." She grabbed two bowls of nuts and one of the tarts, breaking the perfection of the display. Within seconds, Susan had scooped up a plate and started choosing things to put on it. A swift flow of people followed, and the room was soon filled with the bright sound of clinking china, and cheerful chatter, and the scents of beer, pastry, and crunched nuts.
"Quiris...." Hermione flipped two pages ahead and frowned. "So who -- never mind. When we get there. He poured this
. This Snape wasn't a childhood friend of Lily -- though he may have liked her, and he did hate James.
"It's wonderful to see you, Harry," Draco said.  His voice was uneven with emotion. Harry felt his anger turn to churning confusion.
Ruthven looked terrified. Harry couldn't really blame him, especially if his family supported Voldemort. Or did he not know who was to blame?
"So," Ginny prompted as people cautiously chose seats, the spaces left by the absence of other houses buffering one from another. "Shall we start?"
Ron was waiting half-way between the main staircase and the library, and he stepped out of the shadows silently, giving Draco an almost furtive nod. Going along with the mode, Harry grinned at him and gestured at him to come along as he set off away from the library and toward the back stairs.
Draco took the marble and chuckled as he held it aloft. The whispers that had grown around them sputtered into silence. Nott, who had started towards them from near the wall, turned and stalked off into the corridor to the boys' dormitories.
The tarp bulged. Wings extended, the tips protruding from beneath the waxed canvas. A green metal neck stretched up, sending the tarp sliding back towards the ground. An involuntary "Ooo!" came from the audience as wings flapped, shedding the covering entirely, and revealing a mechanical dragon.
Curious, Harry chose carefully -- a flawless bloom just coming out of bud. He reached out an arm weighted down by a heavy wool cloak and took hold of the stem, and Draco dropped his wand into his free hand and cast a cutting spell.
She nodded. "Because of that, and because I value your trust, I will tell you: there is nothing more I can do." Quickly, she held up a hand to stop him from leaving. "
"Because he offered!"  Harry snapped. Even that second of anger was exhausting. "And Draco comes, so it really
, but she and Draco are, and I think that she deserves to know what happened, as much as you can say. He
, so anything I don't understand is a taunt, right? And it was actually sort of friendly, and I was an ass about it. Now he glares every time I try to smile at him."
Ron looked up, astonishment wide on his face. "Keeper?" Slowly, he began to smile. "I might have a shot at that."
A daydream from several days ago asserted itself in his thoughts. "Do you think Pettigrew might come up, sir?" he asked hopefully. "If he's mentioned, we might be able to clear --" Despite the private room, ingrained wariness made him stop, his godfather's name unsaid.
"Rumors have been circulating about what each color stands for. I suspect it's all nonsense -- the usual hysteria about young people's fashions. However, each Head of House has agreed to ask one of our students. So. Tell me, and we'll be done with it."
After agreeing to the change, Harry ducked around a corner and put on his cloak. Invisible, he returned to watch Zabini. The boy didn't seem to have moved in the few seconds he had been out of Harry's sight, and he made no move to contact or signal anyone, as far as Harry could see.  When he left Fortescue's, Harry followed.
"Severus!" Draco yelped. Harry ducked his head to hide a grin. He liked it when Snape talked this way -- like they were all adults -- but he suspected it was more embarrassing for Draco. Still, he was determined to come up with a smart rejoinder.
Harry frowned. "Just once, really. When I came home with this stuff, Fred and George were freaked out, so I gave them a bottle and we all had some. That's all. Nothing like before Easter."
Draco's eyes widened, but he scrambled down, crossing his ankles behind Harry's back. "This feels terribly dirty," he confided, but rather as if he liked the idea. Harry laughed. He worked his fingers back into Draco's arse and enjoyed watching Draco's eyes flutter closed.
"Go on." At Harry's silence, Draco's glare turned to a contemptuous sneer. "Shall I finish for you? You discussed this with my spellfather, who is, of course,
"One is, and one is not," she said, with a tight nod. "I am certain that you can place full confidence in Auror Tonks."
"We don't," Sophia answered. "We allow people to challenge, if they're the only one to take a bead, and then we vote."
This was it. Harry realized that he was nervously turning a piece of cheese into crumbs, but he couldn't manage to stop. "Look, I need to obtain some proscribed ingredients, and I expect that you do too, is that right?"
"No, of course not," Harry agreed, shooting him a smile. "We covered that earlier; you're joining an argument in progress.  However," he said to his present team members, "Professor Dumbledore approved the idea of pickup Quidditch --
So they walked out the dungeon door, and from there to the Slytherin Common Room. Harry was settled in front of the great fireplace before Draco finally handed him the letter.
"I know, but-- Look, let's find Hermione first, okay?"  Harry pleaded, as he ducked under the door flap. "I don't want to explain this twice."
"Well, Professor Snape, because Draco and I interrupted him when he was brewing the phantasm potion. We're planning to talk to Professor Hecksban as well, on Monday. Draco made a logical point too, though -- that if this was a serious threat, witches and wizards wouldn't be buried."
"Oh, here's something you'll find funny," Potter offered, in a cheering tone. "I finally had it out about my sexuality with Ron. It turned out that since I took you as a first year, he was convinced I must be straight."
With a cover of wet heat sliding over the head of his cock, Harry couldn't begin to object. When Draco started sucking, he couldn't remember there might have been something to object to. By the time he came, seconds after forcing out an incoherent warning (that Draco, to his relief, ignored), he was quite certain that Draco was entirely, inarguably, correct.
"Now, Theodore," the man said, "you go to school with Draco Malfoy, don't you? Would you say he's a reliable witness?"
Harry looked at her incredulously, his brow tightening. "What?  Hermione, disguises could be critical to my survival. I can't always use Polyjuice, you know."
Snape drew back and up, like an offended goose. "Die? I am hardly about to kill you, although if the headmistress hears of this, you may wish I had."
Vernon silenced suddenly. His mouth kept moving, but no sound came out. With a look of terror, he fell back, and Snape stepped inside, pulling Harry after him.
"Harry's not always trustworthy, but he takes no pleasure in harming others. I don't think we're in any danger of him becoming particularly vicious, barring long-term exposure to Dark curses."
Draco considered a moment, and then sighed. "Not really. Let's come back here afterwards, though. I'll want to kiss you privately after kissing you in front of her."
"So, do I know where this goes?" His face twisted.  "You returned, making the switch just in time to save Granger, and have since decided you're entitled to me in this world too?"
"Nymphadora," the deep voice warned. "I will not hear baseless allegations against a senior Ministry official."
With a dismissive flick of her eyes, Linnet advanced on Harry. "I," she said, pushing against his chest, "will standardize -- to the benefit of both preternature and the Magical community of Britain -- land usage and development." She shot him an almost flirtatious smile. "It may involve a fight or two with Daddy, but he'll still be proud."
"I think so. I said what we wanted on the record, and nothing too embarrassing." He hadn't really intended look at Ron for the last word, but he was amused to see Ron develop a sudden interest in the brocade of the sofa cushions.
"Right, but why do it alone? We could go to the Prefects' bathroom after the meeting," Harry suggested.
"Do you still want to do that?" Harry remembered Auror Tonks that afternoon and Draco's nerves when he arrived, and hoped that perhaps Draco would decide that they should stay in. For his part, Harry wasn't too worried, but he would far rather an evening in with just Draco than out with a group of Slytherins. Any reporters who saw them would probably assume he was dating Bulstrode.
"Ending with 'Happy Christmas, my destined kill,'" Harry affirmed. "He knew I wouldn't be pleased. It was a threat, aping friendliness to make it worse."
Harry looked up. He could see green balls of mistletoe in amongst the sparse brown leaves still clinging to the wide branches.
why I'm here with you." With a relieved smile, he straightened. "Good. Didn't think we were friends yet." He reached for the flask. "Let's."
"And went on to work for You-Know-Who," Sirius answered. "And got himself killed. He fell short, somehow. His precious
"Right. Believe me, that's sinking in like lead." The bitterness was enough sign that he believed her. Hesitantly, she reached a hand out to lay on his arm.
"Yes." George cleared his throat. "Er, he wanted to remind you to keep your temper, and to tell Draco that the prosecution will call on him in the morning, and that you should both join the group for breakfast."
seem to be afraid of that, as he had feared from Hermione's account. Considering his father, Harry couldn't blame him, but he didn't think it was warranted.
"You have a hip flask?" Hermione asked, scandalized. Harry was aware of the conversations around them fading.
Harry bit his lip. "Okay. If I use this on ...  someone, that person will be more likely to believe me, but only
"And I did check for anomalies," the Auror added. "Don't think I'm just taking their word for it. This place is even blocked against Apparation, in or out. Oh, and sir?" She grinned cheekily at Dumbledore. "You'll understand if I lock the Floo. Kingsley would expect it of me."
Harry shook his head. "Draco and Hermione did the actual isolation of ingredients." He stroked a hand down Tuktuk's silky fur. "I went to Snape when we already knew, though I pretended we didn't."
Harry couldn't keep from making a face. He knew that Mr.  Clarke was referring to the mixed-house space, but Dumbledore's potion was the first thing to come to his mind. He was also belatedly recalling the black bead on Gilbert's string. This man, however pleasant he seemed, had tacitly supported Voldemort in the past. "My influence with him is mostly in other people's imaginations," he said. "Or at least so unpredictable that it hardly matters."
"Yeah." Millicent joined him. "Thanks for your help. I'm not sure how I would have managed adding the jack bean."
, but it wouldn't be suicidal. He could use the Room of Requirement, though it should probably look the way it did when Malfoy had caught a glimpse of it in fifth year, in case Malfoy didn't already know what the room could do. That meant they wouldn't have a bed, but there were mats on part of the floor, and he could ask for a lot of cushions, and a jug of water. Of course, he would have to stay in the room to maintain it, but he could put a remote Sight charm on the stairs -- he wasn't good at them, but it didn't need to last long -- and a Foe-Glass in the room, so he would know if Malfoy was about to attack him. Perhaps he could get Malfoy to agree that they would both set their wands aside. If it came down to a physical fight, he was stronger than Malfoy, he was sure, and while Malfoy now had the advantage in height, he had never learned how to use it. Harry suspected that no one but him ever scrapped with Malfoy.
"Yes." Harry had pushed Malfoy's coat off, but with two buttons of the shirt underneath undone, he paused to twist his hand into the opening and touch the soft skin beneath.
"Yes." Harry grinned.  "He asked Draco and me -- in front of a lot of people, when we couldn't get away -- which of us took it up the arse."
Other people began to trickle in. Draco poured wine, pointed out which cheese was which, and was generally pleasant. Harry didn't think he had the knack of that, but he made sure to talk for a bit with Blaise and Gilbert before taking what seemed to have become 'his' seat on the comfortable sofa.
"Already had it," Draco answered. He straightened suddenly, reaching into his pocket. "Oh -- I nearly forgot!  Here's my schedule. Match it as much as you can."
"Yes, I am!" Harry ran a hand forward through his hair. "Of course I love you! I just don't know if we could
They flooed away, and Madame Pomfrey began her own examination. It was at least ten minutes later that Harry finally got to set out in search of Draco.
on decent terms. He seems to hate me now -- over Draco, I think. And Macmillan is a stuffed shirt." Harry caught Gilbert's eye and winked. "A pity, though, because I think knowing some Slytherins would do Justin good, and it would be entertaining to watch Gilbert meet his Muggleborn equivalent."
"It was a bit upsetting," Sirius confessed, "but only in the sense of making it obvious how little we know each other." At Harry's quick nod, Sirius reached across to set a hand briefly on his shoulder. "We'll have to work on that," he said sincerely.
"Right. So it's time to try something else. I was studying a different source, and it had a significantly different approach." The source was the book of cosmetic charms, but there was no way he was going to tell her that. "For one thing, it emphasized that it's easier to change your looks to match how you think of yourself."
"Oh, I think you're right," Harry agreed. "She's upset at some things I did to hide it, but I decided to confess and get them over with in context, so it's settling out."
Draco's hand squeezed and moved in a hard blur. When Harry roared, Draco's wand snapped forward, severing the ropes at wrists and waist and ankles. Harry fell
Madam Langston drew her wand, which was pale and wavy, and moved it over the pile of silver, muttering under her breath. Slowly the coins blended into a single mass, which she then drew out into a shallow bowl.  The more tarnished coins left lines of grey and black that marbled the surface as it hardened.
"Uh-huh," Harry agreed, leaning back against the wall and folding his arms. "If you don't like the idea, you'll say so, right?"
He brought his hand out and looked at it. It was fine.  Shrugging, he put his head through. He couldn't see anything.
On the third floor, he hesitated. Perhaps he should look in the library and see if Hermione was there? Hadn't she mentioned something about him avoiding her, as if that would be normal, when she'd said he wasn't with Draco? He
Draco shrugged. "The upper years, at least." He thought. "Well, no. Pro or neutral, mostly. I can only think of a few who are genuinely opposed to him. Of course, Millicent seems to be firmly pro-you -- I'm just not convinced she's noticed the corollary. Her family is neutral."  With a sigh, Draco turned slightly away from Harry, but only to settle back against him. "Do you know what's up with Hermione? She's ignoring me."
Quick footsteps crossed the room, accelerating in the hall. The door to the bathroom slammed. They separated -- guiltily, Harry thought, but guilt was apparently the furthest thing from Draco's mind.
Snape rubbed the bridge of his nose. "You are a very odd boy, Potter." He choked out something that might have been a laugh. "They must have been terrified, if they understood even a fraction of the significance." Dismissing the matter with a quick wave, he sat down behind the desk. "On to business," he said. "Have you completed the reading I assigned?"
Indeed, Tonks picked up the glass and took a swallow of it herself, drinking almost half the liquid. Harry tried to look away, but she stepped in front of him.
She hesitated, looking over at the youngest group, who were noisily enjoying their game. "Are they all Muggles? Muggleborn, I mean?"
"No." Harry shook his head. "It's not like that. And anyway, if I'd just gone to this world where I was a murderous bigot and your lover, why would that make me think better of you? But it was more complicated than that."
Slowly, Zabini nodded. He scraped up some ice cream with his spoon. "Well. What can I do for you, Weasleyish?"
"There," Draco stepped closer and stroked -- his hand still heated -- down Harry's naked body, warm fingers just brushing the tip of his cock. "Cushioning charm, darling? The floor's much too hard for my knees."
Harry looked at how the strand was hanging down to the top of his thigh, and decided she was right. It was a bit suggestive. He rocked his hips, making the string sway, and grinned. "I suppose. I could move it back one."
"Mm-hn," Luna answered. "I remember when I discovered that. It was comforting to realize that beautiful things were mathematical too." Her already dreamy gaze grew more distant. "Arithmancy can be very dangerous," she said sadly.
"It's an impossible question," he answered, as a House Elf appeared and snapped her fingers. Soup appeared in each bowl.  "It's like asking if I'm afraid of people. Nagini was terrifying, when I was tied up. Most snakes aren't."
"I see. No, don't turn around. I'm becoming the Malfoy patriarch." Harry could hear the shush of fabric and the jangle of hangers behind him. "And me, Potter? Am I the Slytherin you would most like to have in bed, or the best symbol of my father?"
“’S’okay,” Harry managed, as the pain slowly ebbed. His eyes cooperated, finally. He was in the hospital wing, and the extra person was an unrecognizable blur. Harry shifted to sit up, but only succeeded in raising his head an inch or two off the pillow before collapsing down again. He had a moment of fear for Susara before remembering he had left her in Gryffindor before going to the Pensieve practical the night before. She must be worried about him.
"Ah." Harry reached out to stroke his fingers through his girl's bright hair. "This is goodbye, then?"
his mother's line. An old enough curse might respond identically to an Egyptian pureblood ... not that I understood that until rather recently."
"Why?" Harry retorted. "No one wanted to listen to me then." It was true, and it also gave him a moment to think.  Dumbledore had made it clear that he should cooperate "appropriately."  That probably meant that the strange Auror wasn't an ally, but he could say a lot of the truth. Anything he would have said that night, almost -- anything except that Sirius was an animagus. All of the truth that didn't endanger Sirius, he decided, as Tonks cleared her throat.
"As do I," Shacklebolt answered, nodding slightly. "And you can trust me. I am not recording this, Harry, and I will edit appropriately. Remus let me know the dog was with him for a reason." With that, he opened his folder, and extracted a small stack of photographs. "However, here we move onto the investigation. I would appreciate your assistance. For each of these, please tell me if you know the person. Some, of course, will be obvious."
had hinted at "security breaches" in Azkaban, and Dumbledore had twice assured Harry that he was making progress.  It hadn't been until Friday that Nott had finally been identified as an escapee -- in a collection of single-paragraph items of local news. In this morning's edition, however, his escape was all over the front page, in articles that made it seem as if he had only been loose for a few days. Harry had to agree that it was adequate warning, but it did not satisfy his sense of justice.
"Beast Hunter's Mark, but at a high concentration -- not the formula you drink, which would be all right for anyone."
Draco was busily setting up small caldrons -- one copper, one iron, and one silver. He turned from the task to give them a smile.
Carefully, he slid his wand in above her, as far as he safely could, and then cast a mild, focused Lumos. Her tail-tip flicked.
Draco shifted impatiently. Thornton was supposed to meet him with the new team uniforms at the end of practice, and everyone else had already left.  The boy was probably dallying just to be irritating. He strode to the door, but before he could look outside, the object of his annoyance appeared in front of him.
"Oh. That makes more sense." Millicent began to grind Mountain Crab shell in the large mortar, so Harry filled the cauldron with water and set it to heat. It wasn't until the fluxweed had been added to the brew that she spoke again.
"Are you enjoying the evening, Mr. Potter?" the man asked cordially. He was wearing robes, but of an iridescent purple velvet that was almost black where the shadow of a garland fell on it. His matching hat was embroidered in silver.
"But it's hardly fair that I had an orgasm and you didn't, right?" Malfoy shrugged, the motion now moving small breasts.  "I won't ask you to do that again."
Snape told about how a window had opened just in time to admit Draco, and how, with no time to pause, he had bent down and tucked up his feet to go straight through, and how someone -- either Lucius, whose hood was down, or the person directly behind him -- had struck him with the Cruciatus curse as he passed over the window ledge. He talked about landing on the lawn, and the attack by the staff, and how, in a split-second judgment, he had attacked his companions from behind, rather than fighting with them against his patron, Professor Dumbledore. His painfully tense delivery did nothing to rob the account of its excitement, and many members of the Wizengamot were on the edge of their seats. Still, Harry wasn't sure they
"So, do you think that's all it does?" Harry asked, relieved. "Just make me sick if I drink?" That seemed unfair, but the critical part was that it was harmless.
Harry, who had been taking a sip of currant juice, choked. Draco blinked at him while he coughed and dabbed at the purple spots on his t-shirt.
she is." She looked down. "And ... yes, I admit that I hadn't thought about the people I didn't know."
"Agreed," Gilbert said crisply. "He gets away with it. However, if anyone else wishes to abstain, they must say so now."
"Oh, you know!"  Draco waved a hand carelessly to the side. "Tiny brooms that fly -- and if you're really lucky, maybe you find a player to go on it, as well. Or little sets of runes with some theme in common, or a child-sized telescope, or a clever little box with some candy inside it, or a glass pendant that you can change the color of with only a little magic. Use your imagination!" His eyes shone in the low winter light as he looked back at Harry. "You'll be marvelous, I'm sure."
"Oh, don't!" Harry exclaimed. "I hate that." Looking at Ogden's haughty sulk was giving him a strange feeling of being out of his own body. It took him a moment to turn the impression into a thought.  The boy looked everything and nothing like first-year Draco Malfoy, making him seem too small and far down. The connection lent Harry some empathy. "Voldemort's a mixed-blood, you know."
He lay a long time in bed, letting his heartbeat settle, and telling himself, again and again, that he had not killed Pansy's father. He wondered if he should worry about her threats; he had the feeling she would be a more effective enemy than Nott. Finally, he felt the crumpled letter still in his hand and brought it closer. It was from Draco.  Sitting up, he cautiously eased it open.
"Exactly. I ended up leading a secret study group for students that actually wanted to learn practical defense."
The suggestive slide of her voice was inescapably a demand. His face going blank, Draco turned, and Harry turned to face him, reaching a hand up to touch the tight muscle of his jaw.
Ginny barked out a quick laugh and slapped him on the shoulder. "Of course we are. Idiot. Come on, or we'll be late for dinner."
Dean looked away. "Yeah." He took a deep breath. "Sorry. I wasn't thinking." He cleared his throat. "Still, if they start talking to Slytherins that young, they're bound to pick up bad attitudes."
Harry complied, his fingers working unsupervised as he watched the tip of Draco's cock appear, and then the shaft, and then the blond curls at the base. He parted his own robes and wished he'd had the sense to change out of his T-shirt.
"I know that," he said, turning the corner into a narrower corridor. Two figures twenty feet away, even expected, disturbed him, and Millicent jumped.
It was immensely satisfying to have broken Draco's diction. Harry grinned as he crawled up to lie beside Draco. There wasn't much room on the bed for two, but they didn't need any space between them.
"An hour?" Hermione glanced at her watch, and shook her head. "Where did the time go? All right, Harry."
a neutral. That means something. I need to talk to her while she's willing to listen. I wouldn't risk going out alone, or during business hours, but I've stayed in for the past two nights. No one will be expecting me to leave now, and there are no crowds of shoppers for an attacker to hide in. And I'll have you with me."
The slopes were not as bad as stairs, but they were still challenging. The first time Harry stumbled, Ron caught his arm, and he realized Hermione had held Draco back a few paces; perhaps to chide him about Hagrid.
“Now,” Draco said, shifting slightly forward to sit straighter on the comfortable loveseat he was sharing with Harry. “Welcome to our new members! In the past, we made additions less formally, but our group has become rather large. Let’s start by going around with introductions. Established members -- with your name, say something that the rest of us know about you, but that the new members may not. New attendees -- say something that worries or excites you about this venture. After that, we’ll talk about security, and perhaps play our usual … little game.
"We are aware of that, Mr. Malfoy," Snape growled. "The headmaster is doing his best, but the Muggles are not cooperating. It seems they do not want his
Harry was distressed by the near-hysterical tension behind the words. "I won't tell. I swear." He looked down at the more generic
"What about...?" She pushed in deeper, so her knuckles pressed into Harry's cheeks. Her fingertip did something that sent a sudden shiver through him.
"Of course." Harry's mouth twitched, and he let go of Draco to cut a slice of his beef. "Where would the world be without you mocking it?"
When the round was over, they talked for a while, with people drifting out of their original seats, and only sometimes back in again. Draco sat in Harry's lap, which turned out to be more comfortable than Harry would have supposed, but was also distracting. When Ron complained, they moved together to Draco's chair, and Hermione switched to Harry's place to continue to talk to them while staying next to Ron.
"I'm more surprised by Draco," Blaise said, leaning forward. For a moment, Harry thought he would take a bead also, but he was just reaching for his wine.
"No. I told her that I was helping someone, and I wasn't doing anything wrong, and I wasn't breaking any school rules that she hadn't broken herself."
Draco examined the scar. "'I must not tell lies?'"  he read with a sneer of disgust. "Did you do that to yourself?"
Harry thought Parvati's smile was on the malicious side.  Draco apparently did as well, for he immediately jumped in.
. When I told her about my yellow one for getting in trouble for accidental magic, she said that had been presented to her as--" he cleared his throat and tried to pitch his voice up-- "'a Hufflepuff conquest.' Or maybe something worse."
She reared up, coming strangely close to his eyes to look at the scar. He could feel her distaste as she tested the air in front of it.
"Well, I don't want to seem too well-behaved. I mean, it's not natural, right? And besides, it will be stressful."
Draco paled. Perhaps Myrtle had some idea how off-putting that was, because she immediately stepped back, clasping her hands and setting her head to the side. "Well, you
Ron went up the stairs, presumably on his way back to Gryffindor, while Harry and Draco headed down. Draco waited until Ron was well out of earshot before speaking again.
His eyebrows rising, Draco held out the glasses to Millicent, who poured two measures of the cognac. He handed one to her. The glass Pansy had brought was now sitting untouched on a small table behind her.
"Yes. You simply aren't with the Quiris often enough for a four week gap to show -- assuming I even still have them, which I might not.
Curling even further, Neville's voice dropped to a mumble. "I'm not a decorated dueler like my father, and I shouldn't keep dangerous plants. Besides, it's not--"
Draco's eyes narrowed. "To be more specific," he said clearly, "if you are going to leave the Hogwarts grounds, talk to me first."
"Yes, of course." Snape steepled his hands in front of his chin. "Do you know there is a spell to physically repel them?"  He smiled thinly. "Of course, if you cast it, you need to."
Harry remembered. He grinned and bumped shoulders with his friend. "Not that!" He took a quick breath. He thought he probably shouldn't tell Ron what had happened, but he felt that if he didn't tell
do that for you, of course," he drawled, as he took the sponge and began to rub in a pleasant spiral up Harry's back. His voice sounded almost normal, but his hip was braced against the rail. "I think that bird we brought home is too contaminated to use. I left it outside, and if nothing takes it, I'll remove it tomorrow, okay?"
Harry wondered if she meant that, or just wanted him to make things easier by leaving Draco. Or did she think he was too unsophisticated to realize there was more to the world?
It was a question that took some thought. When Harry woke, it was usually in their bed, or occasionally on the sofa, or in the forest. Now, he was on the carpet in the sitting room, and he was sure he had not fallen asleep there. He thought back to the moon. It had all been strange, and then they had taken a Portkey back from the island retreat that Draco had insisted upon, and then Hermione--
sent already sorted flecks of blood to their pools. Each drop had split into many more tiny ones, and they looked like schools of red minnows against the streaked marble. Harry thought the section on the right must be his, because it had a larger school.
"No need to wait, darling," Draco said. "We ha--" His voice tightened. "You have a House Elf, after all." He looked away, and scraped moodily at his empty plate. Neither he nor Harry took a bead.
"Yeah. She wouldn't let me pick up a project with Professor Snape, though. Said I wouldn't have time."
By the time it got back to Hermione, who smiled archly and said she had secretly brewed her first unapproved potion in second year, Harry was ready for the game. He watched Draco and Padma explain the rules and cast the secrecy charm, and then they were off, with Draco waving to Linnet to start.
"Mm," Draco murmured. "It doesn't have to be real -- Snape, I mean." He tilted his head back as Harry licked his neck. "It can just be our fantasy."
"Yes," Harry said firmly. "I am in frequent sight of someone else -- someone I trust not to betray me."
"It would be my pleasure," Draco replied, and slowly pushed in, stretching and filling, while the magic thickened and roared like wind.
Had Miranda found out who he was? He looked for notes on the Avalon Club, but there was only a time -- 4 PM Sunday.
"About--" Harry stopped. This clearly wasn't what he had hoped. "Sorry. Why did you want to see me, sir?"
"I don't know why I care!" Draco snapped. He pushed away, getting to his feet. Harry's lap felt cold where he had been. He watched Draco take a restless step clear of him and then turn back angrily. "I've done more Dark Arts than you've
Hermione had tears on her face, now, and her eyes were turning pink, but she looked furious. Ron, red-faced, was standing with his fists clenched at his sides.
Harry took out the paper and spread it against the wall, pointing at the photograph. "I'm sure that's Mr. Nott."
Harry nodded quickly.  "Yeah. Pansy's dad went out of his way to come over and call me a 'mongrel'. That was the worst of it for a few hours, but then I went walking in the gardens with Esmée--"
Harry shrugged. "Nah. I ran into a ... an acquaintance and put on my cloak to see what he was up to."
Severus made an inarticulate noise, and Draco rose to his feet, pausing for a stretch at the top of it. "Harry finds the most interesting things in equestrian shops. I believe some of the shop assistants believe he actually has a
Harry looked uncertainly at Draco, but confidence covered his face like a mask as he turned back to Seymour. "Control Spirit. It allows you to give one command to a ghost. I used it to ensure Moaning Myrtle wouldn't tell about something she'd seen me and Draco do."
The rest of Harry's hand clenched in. He was marshalling words when a flurry of aquamarine flew in from the side, and a small hand slipped under his arm.
Finally, it was Draco who said his name, and Harry put down the book and walked over. Fred was looking mutinous and George worried.
"It's not that bad. I couldn't go near the Quiris for a couple of weeks, but it wasn't anything like having
With a smirk, Draco unbuttoned the garment and let it fall.  Rather than kicking it away, he stepped to the side, clear of the fallen fabric. Harry bit his lip. Draco was half-hard, his swollen prick not at full length, but rising forward enough to part the placket of his shirt.
Harry didn't argue, and Hermione didn't protest, and Hermione and Ron settled down into a cuddle punctuated by occasional kisses. Harry kept his eyes on his books and consoled himself with the thought that every minute they didn't speak brought Ron closer to normal.
"Oh." Harry leaned back, belying the way his heart sped up. Would this dangerous topic destroy his short alliance with Snape? "I've become interested in it. Hermione is so ..." He grimaced -- "
"Which only mattered because I was there! With people who hated me! Some summers I couldn't even do my homework -- Uncle Vernon locked away all my school things, one year, including my books and wand, and I was never able to get supplies or books or anything. Here, I could have been learning something useful, and have been more ready now."
Blaise rubbed his forehead. "Look," he said, his voice low, "I know what you'll--" He looked up and down the stairs. No one was near, but there was no telling about the corridors off the landings. "All right. I only have a few minutes, though."
The unrestrained warmth of her smile was unnerving. "Of course," she said sincerely. "I understand."
Green and black swirled around them and drained away, leaving the bright colors of the headmaster's office.
"Think about it!" Harry insisted, looking between them. "There are two sides to a conflict that you haven't made up your mind about. One side talks to you, and the other one doesn't. Which way will you drift?"
"Mm. I think someone doesn't mind me being a pervert. Shall I ask Draco if he's up to sucking that for a moment?"
People had started to file into the classroom. Ron looked at Harry, huffed, and settled on the other side of the room. Draco came in later, looked around the room, and came straight over to Harry.
I don't want to argue about it. And I am terribly sorry for spoiling the mood, and I promise to not mope next time."
Rolling her eyes, she sat back, but her scowl faded. "You can't blame me if it's hard to get used to, Potter. Fine. Have a seat."
"Cleaning, I think, and then some charms to keep away the bugs and such, and then sometime during this week I should bring Draco here to do some stone-shaping and maybe look at the lights."
Draco entered the room first, and then, after confirming that no one else was there, opened the door for Harry.
"It's a glamour, Harry," the stranger who was Sirius said. "There are ways to undo it, but someone would have to try. We should be safe enough for a couple of hours."
Hermione nodded vigorously, her hand rising near Draco as if itching to grab the device from him. "I've read about them," she said, "but I've never had the opportunity to use one."
"Leave dinner with me tomorrow," Harry suggested. "I'll take you from there. Oh -- and skip puddings."
Harry waited. She sniffed again. He'd thought that was contempt, but now, as Pansy struggled to speak, he was less certain. Now that he looked, her eyes were pink, and the upper lids puffed up. "The Greeter," she said faintly, her voice catching. "He set it off for me."
Draco studied her like she was a difficult runic overlay. "He's right," he said finally. "I'm fine."
Despite his worries, it was impossible not to enjoy the Welcoming Feast. While he sampled delicious dishes, Hermione was cheerfully babbling about what options to take for her final year. A stranger might have called it fretting, but Harry could tell she was enjoying every tortured choice. Some of the younger students were looking at him and whispering, but everyone in his year seemed to be fine -- even Dean gave him a quick smile.  Further down the table, Damian, one of the Gryffindor Beaters, pointed to him and said something to the younger girl with him. Harry felt his relaxed mood fade. Hermione tsked.
They talked for an hour, with Harry occasionally heading off building clashes between Ron and Draco. Despite the extra work, he was happy, and they both pretended that nothing was odd about the situation. Harry and Ron had second bottles of butterbeer, and when Draco pushed his second back to Harry, Harry nudged it over to Ron. While Ron opened it, Draco and Harry kissed. Afterwards, Draco continued to stare at him, his eyes promising more. With an effort, Harry looked away.
Parvati nodded. She and her sister had been part of the group that Harry had invited to discuss the matter last spring. They had only met twice. Dumbledore had showed up to the second meeting, listened carefully, and said that he had sufficient information.
"I assure you, Slytherin will have the cup again."  Draco's eyes sparkled, and Harry bumped against him.
"Eh." Blaise shrugged. "It makes more sense the longer I think about it. The turd left his mother, you said?"
"Good," he retorted, stepping out of his fallen trousers, and dropping to his knees beside her. He wanted to say he couldn't keep his mouth off her, but that was too strange, considering this was Malfoy, so he kissed down her neck to the nearer breast instead, until he was sucking on that and playing with the further one in his hand.
"The mixed-house space is good for that," Draco added. "It tends toward people who are open to learning new things."
Draco lay down without argument, but after a pleasant interval of kissing – and undressing bit by bit -- he caught at Harry's shoulders when Harry tried to roll away onto his other side.
Draco got to his feet. Harry had only time for a moment's confused hurt before Draco reached a hand down to him. "Come to bed?"  he asked, his voice low.
“Of course!” Sirius rubbed his hands together. “Money does no good sitting in a vault, they say! Let’s have a spree.”
He had to think about it for a moment. "A lot better than usual, and you probably know about the worst moments. I mostly hid out, after the trial."
Harry paused to look at Draco and then to kiss him. "Are we serious about this?" he asked. "I mean, he's still Snape."
"Oh," Draco said. He sounded lost, and his hand still lay motionless on Harry's thigh. Harry gave up on kissing him in favor of coming up on one arm to get a better look at his face. Draco was staring past him at the floo screen as if it were exotic, rather than a standard Wizard furnishing.
"Oh, but he must." Harry reclined back and tossed the apple again. "No one has lips that sort of pink."
"I genuinely didn't mean any harm. I wasn't entirely sure what it was, but I can tell vicious from merely irritating."
. In different ways, even. And I think...." Harry moved his hands through empty air trying to gather something intangible. "There must be
"Well, maybe the Owlery, if I finish," Harry amended. "If I'm not in the Common Room, I'll see you in the Great Hall, okay?"
Harry looked over in surprise. "I'm not. He wouldn't think so! He's a Slytherin; he's working at getting what he wants. That happens to be Voldemort dead, so we're good."
"I -- it's hard to know what to say," Lucius continued, his voice just slightly unsteady. More than one listener was dabbing at her (or even his) eyes. Except for Voldemort, Harry had never wanted to hurt another person so badly as he did Lucius Malfoy now.
"Everyone is -- or will be -- fine," he murmured quickly, cutting his meat efficiently into small bites. "I'll let you read it later, but let's have some food now." Harry followed his glance to where the headmaster would sit when he arrived, and nodded. Draco leaned close.  "I'll leave first," he whispered. "Meet me in the Quiris' room."
"It was only a dream," the voice continued, and that was a long enough utterance that Harry recognized the aristocratic drawl, although he'd certainly never heard it with that reassuring tone, before.
Harry didn't answer, but he wrapped an arm around Draco as well. It made going down the spiral staircase awkward and slow, but they stayed like that anyway. By the third flight, they had the rhythm of it.
"I'm closer to her than to any of the others," he said deliberately, Narcissa's eyes widening as he spoke, "except possibly Blaise. The manor would pose dangers to her, though."
Harry looked speculatively at Draco. "That I'm dating a Malfoy. He's quite down on it. If I could reply, of course, I could tell him it was only temporary -- no idea if that would help."
Miranda grinned, her teeth looking large in her child's face. "Sir. You are influential, a brilliant dueler, keen, and as unstoppable on a case as a Krup after an Erkling -- everyone says so -- but I don't know that you're much of a curse-breaker."
Supremely unaffected by the clang behind him, Draco continued forward to Harry. "What happened to her?" he asked tensely.  "Do you know?"
that opportunity is upon each of you. If you do not complete your readings, put thought and effort in your assignments, and concentrate meticulously upon your practical work, your chances remain ... abysmal.
"Yeah," Ron said, finally raising his head. He aligned the stiletto and hesitated, the thin point just above Harry's skin. "You okay with this?" he asked. His gaze flicked significantly over to Draco and returned. "Really?"
Harry looked querulously at Draco, but despite his lover's obvious pleasure, he couldn't make himself step back. He knew that Draco trusted his mother, but was less certain that such trust was deserved.  The Auror came to his rescue.
"Thank you," Snape said. For a moment, he almost sounded sincere, but then he grimaced, withdrawing a few inches. "If you would both give me details...."
Breaking into a smile, Harry finally looked at him again.  "No. He had a Plan, of course, with a capital P."
Linnet fluttered her eyelashes at him, hands clasped over her heart. "Dearest! We cannot hide our love!"
"I'm not a dog," Draco complained, but the words came with a wicked smile, and he pulled Harry's pillow a little further down under his head. He looked so satisfied that Harry was worried that Draco expected him to suck him. He wasn't sure that he could do that -- not now. It still seemed weird.
Harry laughed hollowly.  "You might say that. Voldemort sent me his head as a 'present,' along with a note saying he'd have sent someone more competent."
The next afternoon, while the twins were working, Harry took advantage of the offer. He was surprised to find that Polyjuice Potion with Fred's hair wasn't disgusting, just hotly spicy and a bit odd. It was the perfect time, he decided, to return to Gringotts and get the money he would need for sphinx feathers. He stuffed his Invisibility Cloak in his bag, just in case, and headed out.
"I have it," Draco said. "I think we do need some minor truth magic, now that it's been explicitly pointed out that lying is possible, but in counter to that, we also need a secrecy charm."
"I do find myself torn," Draco said mildly.  Around a corner from the classroom, he stopped. "Signal now?" he suggested. "It will be a quicker walk from lessons than from houses."
"What?" Ron exclaimed, staring at him. Seamus ignored him. Draco nodded at Linnet, and Blaise at Draco. When they looked at Millicent, she glanced at Harry. He didn't think he had signaled anything, but with a sigh, she set her heavy boots on the floor, rolled her shoulders back, and nodded. "This time."
"Then just trust us, will you? And try to follow along when we're reviewing 'obscure laws', because they may make the difference between getting him in prison or having him free."
Harry did go to the Great Hall for dinner, and Draco's interference seemed to have helped. Hermione -- and Ginny -- were cheerfully normal with him, and other housemates followed their lead. After the meal, he walked up to the library with several housemates, checked out a book on curse breakers in the Himalayas, waved to Hermione, and slipped away to the Uncommon Room.
on myself when I thought I might be tempted to show mercy at a time when I must not. In such a case, you need to remember to use a compound incantation that ends the spell at some preset time or condition."
Harry paused. Prudence demanded that he tell Narcissa Malfoy as little as possible of his strategies. However, the potential fun of her reactions was tempting. "Most of the people who want to kill me," he said carefully, "aren't comfortable in Muggle places."
Millicent snorted. "It's about the only hard labor acceptable for a young lady. Well, if you don't have the flying space for horses."
His eyebrows rising, Dumbledore drew back. "I had simply thought it would be a more comfortable place than my office. There is no need for you to take offense."
"I'll scout," Harry said, understanding.  "There's unlikely to be anyone out there -- I think it's just Seymour and Ruthven from your house."
"Yes. I mean, we definitely don't love or like each other, which is what people usually ask. But also...."
"Really?" Her heavy eyebrows rose as she looked sidelong at him. "You did a good job of looking like it was nothing."
"You get acclimated to it," Draco volunteered, coming down to join them on the floor. "Though Frieda's tendency to want everyone to hug and make up makes a little more sense to me now."
The Ravenclaw sniffed contemptuously. "As if little kids can't keep secrets. I don't know why grown-ups think that."
"Malfoy has always had his own room, actually. His father used to pay for it, and apparently Snape decided he should keep it this year 'for security reasons.'"
She was silent for several seconds, her mouth moving, then closing. She bit her lip. "May I see it?"
After he had left, Harry cast a noise block on the door and lay down beside Draco. "So, Slytherin, how much of that was real?"
Flying -- or rather, playing -- was just the thing. Draco had brought a practice Snitch, and cast a charm on it that impaired hiding. It maneuvered just as evasively as in games, however, and kept them chasing and dodging for many rounds.
"Oh well. You'll need to hang out with me in public, then, sometime when Colin is around. He loves it when I ask for prints."
"I was advised to find someone who knew me well," Harry said. "And he came out with a couple of unexpectedly accurate things during carelessly done Divination assignments, last year."
Slowly, Draco turned away, though he kept one hand in contact with Harry. "I suspect it was actually a breakout," he offered. "Theo was doing his best to taunt me in the common room, yesterday. Ranting on about how his family was loyal to the Dark Lord and would be rewarded, whilst my father had ineptly attempted to play both sides, and he would suffer, and Professor Snape would suffer...." Draco swallowed, and tossed his head. "It was really quite tedious."
Harry took out his purse. He had fifteen galleons in it, and another fifteen hidden in an inner pocket of his robes. It was enough, he hoped, to impress. "I'm good for it," he said, spilling money into his hand.
"Harry!" She waited for a hug before saying anything more. "Did you have a good holiday? After the start, I mean." She grimaced. "I know you were here when they found the head."
"That I'm better with a wand," Harry answered quickly. "And I shouldn't get into fights while I'm wearing Susara."
He kept waiting for someone to scold them about last night's activities, but after both Auror Tonks and Dumbledore had greeted them without their excursion being mentioned, he decided they must not know. He and Draco should tell the Aurors, he knew, but he didn't want to. They couldn't identify either of their attackers -- or even prove they had been attacked -- but someone would question his judgment, and Dumbledore might put him under guard.
"Do you think that what you are doing is unimportant to what you are trying to accomplish?" Harry demanded.
"As much as is possible while you are a fugitive," Remus amended. "Which may not be much. We can't risk this often, Harry."
"You want to get your money before Dumbledore sends me back to the Dursleys' right? If we do it now, we can go down to Gringotts while Draco's bodyguard is still on duty."
"Yeah. They'd fallen into despair at one of the third floor landings. I told them it happens to everyone."
A warm body curled up against his, one leg -- also bare -- overlaying his own. Something soft -- lips? -- brushed along his cheek.
If the game had started like this, Harry didn't think any of them would have kept on with it. He was relieved that Neville was next.
Harry licked his lips. Draco's body was long and lean. He could possibly use a little more food and a little more exercise, the trainer part of Harry's brain assessed, but the basic form was stunning -- flawless skin and clean lines, the smooth sweep of his ribs like a parting curtain above the flat oval of his abdomen. His hands were at the front of his trousers, now, undoing the hook there.
Harry nodded, but he didn't write anything back. Draco, as a Slytherin, could get away with that. He was a Gryffindor, and could lose points for his house.
There were three of them. Harry recognized Kingsley Shacklebolt immediately. It would have been reassuring that someone in Dumbledore's confidence was there, if it hadn't been for the other two -- Special Inquisitor Valerian Cabot, and Auror Mason, who had come to Hogwarts with Tonks weeks ago. Harry looked nervously at Tonks.
"It was Dumbledore," he said. "I hadn't been at the door a minute before he showed up. He has to be watching the place, somehow."
In the charming of the favors, Harry had nearly forgotten the tense exchange that had preceded it. "Do you mean you'd pretend to hate Muggleborns if I wasn't here?" he demanded.
was an extended hoax meant to discover how long a respected Quidditch publication would pay for nonsensical gibberish written by a famous ex-pro Seeker. Harry was of the camp that that thought Patrick had taken a Bludger too many to the head, but if you could manage to figure out what he was trying to describe, the advice was always good.
"Haven't lied?" Draco prodded incredulously. "You have cursed her to believe you, and then told her the truth? That's likely!"
"Yes," Draco said, but for the first time since Harry's mention of the Weasleys, he sounded unhappy. Reining in the selfish urge to fuck Draco
"Huh." He shrugged. "I'll take what I can get -- but I'd rather you brought in the Greengrass girls, and Cecilus, and others."
Tonks, from a few steps away, answered. "THE POSSIBLE TARGETS ARE BOTH HERE AND ALIVE. THE OBJECT IS SECURED."
"Ah. Ginny's good. We might win, after all." Harry rolled towards him. "Of course, whatever happens, both of us win." He looked uncertainly at Draco. "Yes?"
Harry leaned back against the table and crossed his arms over his chest. He had an idea what was coming.
"Very nice." Harry stretched overhead to reach his wand, and with a tap set the butt plug to moving slightly inside Severus. "There's a little more sensation for you to ride on. Now just put your mouth over the head of my cock and explore. See how many ways you can use your tongue, or your lips, or the sides of your mouth. No deeper than you can go with your hand in place, now. Draco will instruct you on deeper."
"Yes!" Harry surged forward and hugged him. "Thank you! We must have at least softened it. Are you on the Floo network?"
After writing the note, he decided to check the library.  Draco wasn't at the study tables, but by the time Harry had finished looking, he had received a reply in the notebook.
Harry trailed fingers along the strip of light as he walked down the short curve of corridor to the Uncommon Room. Susara, as often when they were here, spiraled down his arm and out of her pose. A little gold head emerged from Harry's sleeve as he sat on the comfy sofa.
