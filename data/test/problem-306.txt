‘No, they’re not.’ Harry retorted, a chill travelling down his spine and causing goose bumps to arise on his blemished skin.
‘Come Draco,’ Bellatrix grabbed his elbow and brought him over to where Harry was. ‘We need you to tell us if this is Potter or not.
Slughorn didn’t look happy that it was Draco had answered, his expression falling slightly at the boy’s darkened look.
‘I didn’t fancy getting in trouble on the first night back.’ Draco replied immediately, his answer seemed already rehearsed and ready.
‘What’re you doing?’ Hermione inquired, eyeing Harry’s actions. ‘That’s not what the instructions said to do.’
‘Well you look particularly perky this morning,’ Harry said the next morning as he took a seat opposite his jittering best friend.
Everyone but Draco looked towards him, the scorching heat of their gazes numbed Harry’s skin as he stumbled forward. The bite of toast he had eaten earlier swirled in his stomach as he stationed himself in front of the cauldron, trying to take in its scent as best as he could.
Harry again, put on his Slughorn-approved façade and swivelled to face the red-faced professor, a wine goblet clasped in his hand.
‘I almost forgot; McGonagall told me to pass this on. It’s from Dumbledore.’ She said, waving at the trio as she ventured towards the girl’s dormitories.
The intoxication he felt dissipated as soon as Hermione’s gasp was heard from behind him and Harry’s body was burning now.
Draco stared blankly at him, the creases in his face smoothing out as his face relaxed. Harry couldn’t comprehend what he was thinking as a minute of silence passed. It suddenly felt as if they were the only two people under the castle’s roof, the sound of their mingled breathing permeating the bubble of air around them. With his eye’s shifting upwards, Draco’s face softened enough for Harry to follow his direction of sight.
Draco’s words were so quiet that Harry almost didn’t hear them. He followed Draco’s captivated gaze to see it was focused on the herd of Thestrals that usually pulled the Hogwarts carriages. Realisation dawned upon Harry. Draco hadn’t been able to see them in the previous years.
Narcissa looked as nervous as Harry as she nodded at the house elf who scampered away instantly. Feeling his breathing hitch, Harry felt a sharp kick at the back of his kneecaps force him down to the ground as Bellatrix looked towards Ron and Hermione.
‘Check the list,’ the man said to his side before turning towards Ron whose face was now as red as his face. ‘And yours?’
Before either of them could process Hermione’s words, the sound of voices could be heard from the outside of the tent. Harry immediately knew who they belonged too, the snatchers had found them, and it was all his fault. As he turned to his friends in panic, Harry was met with the sight of Hermione’s wand tip in his face before a searing flush spread across his face and made him gasp.
‘I just hope it’s worth it,’ Blaise’s words made Draco freeze. ‘I just hope everything you’re losing out on is worth it Draco.’
‘Dobby, can you apparate in and out of this room?’ Harry asked eagerly, a plan already unfolding within his mind.
‘Harry!’ Hermione screamed with such an intensity that both boys froze, ‘you can’t say his name. It’s taboo!’
Next chapter will be the final one and then there'll be a short epilogue chapter too! Thank you sm for reading and all the comments <3 I should update by saturday!
The man cocked his head at this, ‘are any of them on the list?’ He asked the clipboard man who had been busily sifting through the various papers.
‘Quick, get under.’ Harry lifted the edge of the invisibility cloak to let Hermione under, covering both of their bodies from view.
With that, Draco walked out of the carriage, his footsteps resounding all around Harry who wished to be anywhere else but here right now. He wished that one of his friends would report him missing as soon as they reached the castle, this was the only hope he had. But as he lay motionless, having nothing else but his surroundings to be alert of, Harry again heard the sound of footsteps coming closer to where he was.  He cheered in his head, knowing his Gryffindor classmates would never disappoint him. But he was taken aback to see Draco’s shoes again. He had come back for Harry.
‘He wasn’t gate crashing,’ he spoke up loudly and turned towards Slughorn. ‘I invited him professor, you said I could bring someone along.’
‘Yes, indeed this is a curious little potion, Felix Felicis, commonly known as Liquid Luck. One drop and the taker is the luckiest person in that moment, gearing on the edge of being successful in whatever they do.’ Slughorn explained, ‘and it seems like you’re all in luck ladies and gentlemen, for whoever in the next hour brews a perfect draft of Living Death will receive one vial. I hope that should be your motivation to work hard this lesson.’
They both chuckled at this, knowing that Ron was most likely screaming profanities at Cormac with the colour of his face matching his hair. Hermione’s eyes caught onto something behind Harry, her smile dimming into confusion, causing Harry to turn his body in one swift motion. He took a few steps closer instantaneously at the sight of Filch gripping onto a nervous looking Draco dressed in all black. Filch dragged the fidgeting boy towards where Slughorn stood with a guest, an eerie silence fell upon the rest of the party.
Harry nodded, ‘he needed my help in recruiting a new teacher, apparently I’m a pretty convincing person.’
The snatcher who had been holding Harry hostage suddenly loosened his grip ever so slightly as the man again began to sift through the list.
‘Take the boys down to the cellar!’ Bellatrix instructed, walking closer to Hermione till their faces were only inches apart. ‘I’d like to have a talk with this one.’
‘But it makes sense, doesn’t it?’ Harry interrupted, his brows knitting in the middle of his forehead as he spoke fiercely. ‘His entire families full of death eaters. It’s only normal that Malfoy’s one too now. Especially since he was staring a bit too intensely at that cabinet thing.’
‘Taking a detour into such a place as Knockturn Alley wasn’t such a wise thing to do for someone like you.’
‘The Malfoys are death eaters though.’ Harry murmured, shifting his gaze towards his two best friends.
Without his permission, a tear escaped from the corner of Harry’s eyes. He hadn’t known how much he had needed someone to acknowledge his pain until now. His friends had avoided the topic, deciding that Harry was better off dealing with his emotions in private. But Harry had needed the opposite, he had wanted pity so desperately. And Draco was the only one giving it to him.
Harry’s attention was piqued by this, having a vial of such a potion would prove to be particularly useful to his fight against Voldemort. Yet he couldn’t help but let out a sigh, knowing his potion-making skills were subpar at best. As he gathered his materials and opened his textbook, Harry noticed the marking on the first page.
‘I’m sorry.’ Draco whispered, loud enough for Harry to turn towards him in a mixture of anger and shock.
‘I said not to touch my arm, didn’t I?’ A familiar voice sneered to Harry’s left. He turned his head to see Draco standing in front of a visibly nervous Madam Malkin pinning at his robes.
‘Potter! My broom malfunctioned. You have to let me go again!’ Cormac cried as he slipped off his landed broom.
‘Yes. If I recall correctly, he said something like, I can’t believe someone like Potter has such an incompetent fool as his best mate. I just left them to it.’
This was enough to satisfy Hermione and she began discussing the classes she had chosen for her N.E.W.T classes with Ginny. As if Harry could sense it, he looked up ahead at the Slytherin table to see Draco’s gaze trained on him, his face leaned against his palm. Draco’s expression was as indifferent as ever, there being no room for Harry to interpret what he was thinking. But as his cloudy eyes met Harry’s, he averted his gaze to focus onto his sparse plate instead.
‘Of all people, it had to be Malfoy Slughorn chose.’ Ron said abruptly as both boys lay lazily on their respective red and gold beddings.
The fumes of the potion went straight to Harry’s head, clouding his thoughts for a few moments and before he could stop himself, he had spoken the truth.
Slughorn didn’t react as Harry had expected, quickly moving the subject onto what he personally smelt to avoid lingering on Harry’s answer. As Harry turned to retake his position next to Ron, he noticed that everyone was avoiding his eyes now, everyone except Draco. The same indifference radiated from his lean body as he tilted his head, his icy eyes filled with thoughts Harry would never hear. Harry shivered now, hoping his words would be forgotten across the course of the lesson. But he knew this was highly unlikely.
Ron stalked towards them, ready to say something but Harry held up his hand to signal for him to wait.
‘Calm down Ronald. The food isn’t going anywhere.’ Hermione lectured; her eyes focused on the open daily prophet in front of her.
A silence lapsed as the tips of the castle became visible. Harry didn’t believe Draco’s reasoning, but the exhaustion of the night’s events stopped him from saying anything further. With the spasms in his stomach accelerating, Harry realised just how hungry he was and his mouth watered with thoughts of the feast in the castle.
‘Your popularity is really making trials chaotic.’ Ginny joked as she stood next to Harry who had been looking through his list.
Harry figured Ron was semi-right, his performance always suffered greatly under the mounts of pressure. His nerves always found a way to overpower him, but Harry was hoping they’d sidestep for at least today for Ron’s sake as well as his. Hermione, however, seemed to be in an elated mood as she approached the pair, dressed in thick wool for the autumn weather.
Draco was stressed, knowing that once he got home, his mother would be hysterical and demand comfort from him. It wasn’t that he minded, he loved her more than anything and was more than willing to support her, but he knew his father’s imprisonment meant things were to change drastically. Not only would his previous ministry connections dissipate, his fellow death eaters would also look down on his failure to obtain the prophecy from the ministry. Draco didn’t even want to think about the dark lord’s reaction to all of this, it only made his stomach turn and made the trifle he’d eaten at dinner threaten to spill out of his mouth.
The guard’s eyes widened as he looked at Harry whose face was still red and puffy with the spell Hermione casted. Even though he looked unconvinced, he still moved to open the gate and allowed the snatchers to drag them across the winding path of the lawn. As Harry looked around, trying to determine where it was that they had been brought, he couldn’t help but feel as if he was somewhere significant, somewhere familiar.
Before Ron could reply, Harry was rushing in the same direction Draco was moving. He kept the distance between them, ensuring his footsteps weren’t resounding enough for Draco to realise he was being followed again. Harry recognised the route instantly; Draco was taking long strides towards the same area where he had found Harry crying the previous year. His icy blond hair seemed to be glowing as he walked, contrasting the dense blackness of his sweater and jeans. His appearance always seemed to be at war with itself.
And as the trio entered the classroom, there he was, already standing amongst his Slytherin peers who were busy sneering at the Gryffindors in their midst. Professor Slughorn was overjoyed at the sight of Harry and ushered him to gladly borrow a textbook from the cupboard. Even though the textbook Harry had chosen was breaking at the spine and visibly aged, he figured it would do for now.
Like always, Draco was running away from him again, desperate to escape the heated attention he couldn’t afford. This time, Harry followed him into the corridor, knowing he was only escalating his problems as his friend’s watched him leave. But for some reason, this recklessness was difficult to control.
‘I caught this boy loitering on the seventh-floor professor,’ Filch said maliciously, knowing he was humiliating Draco in front of everyone right now. ‘He claims to have been invited to your party, but I assume he was gate crashing.’
‘Breakfast is long gone mate. Mum’s making lunch right now so we can eat before we’re escorted to Diagon Alley.’ Ron explained, picking up a peculiar looking toy from one of the twins bedside tables.
‘God knows what he plans to do with the Liquid Luck he won today.’ Harry said bitterly, the image of Draco’s expression of victory that had unfairly lightened up his blurred complexion pitched in his mind.
‘I’ve had enough mother.’ He snapped and shrugged off the robes which fell onto the ground around him. ‘I’ll just get my robes elsewhere.’
Harry flicked through the book to see every page was marked by scribbles from the mysterious prince person and he frowned, knowing making the potion would be drastically more difficult now. As he glanced towards Draco’s table to see him already busily working on his potion with a determined crease in his face, competition soared within Harry in waves. He began readily to read the instructions, at first trying to ignore the black handwriting wedged in between each line; however, as it became increasingly hard to ignore the corrections, he gave in.
‘You’ll be fine, I don’t know why you’re stressing so much. Besides you were on the team last year, of course you’ll make it back.’ Harry reassured him, taking a sip of the bitter juice in his goblet.
It was when he turned towards Hermione that both Harry and Ron felt their hearts begin to hammer harder within their chests. Hermione, however, was visibly unmoved, holding her head up high despite her clenched jaw that Harry recognised as a sign of her fear.
By ten pm, Harry had finally collapsed onto the array of blankets on his bed, the fatigue leaving his entire body dried up. He had had to practically pry himself away from Hermione’s incessant comments about his new potion’s textbook. She was convinced that the Half Blood Prince was some treacherous wizard and that the book – like Tom Riddle’s diary – was some type of dark artifice. With Ron’s help, Harry had shaken her concern with a yawn that prompted him to head to the dorms.
‘It’s only the first day, he’s bound to do something soon.’ Ron reasoned, pulling his school shirt over his head.
‘It’s not about the damn cabinet Hermione, it’s the shop the cabinet was in!’ Harry’s tone increased in desperation as he tried to convince his friends.
As Harry left Dumbledore’s office that night, he found himself less dejected than he thought he would be. He had expected such a reaction after all, being used to pursuing things alone. Of course, the majority of the times, he had his best friends alongside him, aiding him in the best way they could, but this time was different. Something within Harry told him that this was a journey he had to experience as an individual. He shuddered as he walked through the Gryffindor dorms, recoiling at Dumbledore comparing him to such a person as Draco Malfoy. It was an insult at best.
Something raged within Harry as Draco averted his eyes to the ground, the dark shadows under his eyes and slumped figure making him look like a helpless child. Harry didn’t know what exactly possessed him as he stepped forward.
Harry was quick to pick it up, following Ron up the stairs quietly as Wormtail surrendered behind them. As they crept up the stairs, both boys were given a clear view of what had been occurring in their absence. Hermione lay limp with exhaustion on the polished floor, arms outstretched as Bellatrix peered over her. Her yellow teeth glistened menacingly in the light as Narcissa turned away in distaste. Next to her, both Lucius and Draco stood, their faces indifferent to the entire affair. The goblin Draco had taken from the dungeons stood clutching the Gryffindor sword, a slash against his coarse cheek burning brightly. Harry had started to think of what to do next when Bellatrix again pointed her wand directly at Hermione in attempt to torture her some more. Something within Ron snapped and before Harry could stop him, he was moving towards her.
Letting out a scoff, Ron ignored what his girlfriend had said, ‘are you forgetting about all those times he boasted about being a pure-blood and looked down on muggle-borns like Hermione? Sounds very death eater-esque to me.’
‘I come to save you Harry Potter!’ The house elf chirped, looking curiously at the other people around the room.
The amusement on Ginny’s face was enough to make Harry’s ears redden, ‘that’s always nice to hear Harry.’
‘Finite Incantatem.’ Draco whispered, bent down next to Harry’s body that was now slowly regaining its motion.
‘No – well yes, but that isn’t the reason,’ Harry quickly defended himself, straightening up in his seat. ‘You see, I saw him in Knockturn Alley entering a store named Borgin and Burkes- ‘
if anyone is interested, the poem Harry quoted is The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock by T. S. Eliot. It's my favourite poem so i really wanted to feature it since it also inspired the title <3
‘What?’ Draco moved closer as to grasp Harry’s arm, but Harry pulled his body back as if Draco would infect him with something poisonous.
Hermione stood quietly as she watched Harry rip the letters up and throw them into the metal bin. Harry ensured that no one would be able to read them now and that they were forever unobtainable. Yet this made him slightly glum, a part of Harry had wanted to keep them, but he knew it was an irrational want.
Draco stood still for what felt like several minutes, the sky began to darken around them, yet Harry did not lift his head up. His crying had stopped now, yet his body shook with the aftermath of hiccups.
As Draco walked into the clearing, Harry stood back, hiding behind the stone wall. The sound of a second voice, one sickly sweet and feminine made Harry peer slightly around the corner of the wall to see Draco standing in front of a lean girl with dark raven tresses. Harry couldn’t put a name to her face, another nameless Slytherin he had overlooked before.
‘Well well, look at what we have here!’ One of them exclaimed, a buoyant looking man dressed in mismatched clothing. ‘Grab them!’
Before Harry could register the fact that Draco knew about his invisibility cloak, Draco’s foot kicked at Harry’s nose. The blood trickled down his face and the pain that Harry couldn’t express through his vocal cords shot through his entire body like a virus.
Before any further questions could be roused, Harry called for keeper tryouts to begin. He walked away from Cormac as if being within the same vicinity as him would make him into the same blubbering mess of nerves that Ron currently was. To Harry’s relief, Ron was playing better than he had expected, defending the rings as if he had just consumed a cauldron full of Felix Felicis. Even though he had promised to be objective in his judgement, Harry couldn’t control the ovations that bubbled up his throat every time Ron knocked the bludger’s away.
The desperation in Harry’s voice was enough to convince Draco that there was nothing more he could do to help, and he nodded. Everything in him yearned for him to stay and push Harry’s boundaries, but Draco knew that he didn’t deserve the right to do this. Not after the many years he and his family had tormented Harry when he was already suffering.
‘Yeah,’ Ron added, walking till he was next to his girlfriend. ‘I’ve thought about things a lot, you know, all this stuff with you and Malfoy and I just can’t seem to wrap my head around it. I know somehow you’ve come to like him, but the state you’re in right now, I just don’t get how it’s all over a death eater who terrorised us for five years.’
‘Why do you always have to run away?’ Harry said in exasperation, following Draco’s hurrying figure.
‘You haven’t been very discreet with your actions Draco. I made your mother an unbreakable vow, let me assist you in whatever your plans are.’ Snape replied.
Draco’s voice, however, was anything but gentle. ‘I’m working just fine on my own. I don’t need your concern or anyone else’s.’
Hi! It took me awhile but here is this epilogue! I know it would've been better to write a sequel but i don't think i'd have any time to write one so I just decided to push a scene from DH into the epilogue. Thank you so much for reading this fanfic! I really appreciated all the lovely comments :(<333 but yas #DRARRYHAPPYENDING WOOOH!
For every day for the next year, Draco recalled this encounter from every angle he could think of. Even though Harry had most likely forgotten it had even occurred, Draco was stricken with immense regret. Whenever he saw Harry in the corridors surrounded by countless admirers, Draco wished he hadn’t run away that night. He wished that he had said something in response to Harry, something that could’ve possibly bridged a gap between them. But things only worsened as Draco’s father fought against Harry and his friends at the ministry. Things seemed irreparable now.
Just wanted to say there's a trigger warning for this chapter, there is a reference to self harm so please keep safe! Thank you for reading <3
‘Bill and Fleur’s cottage,’ Ron cut in, wincing at Hermione’s prolonged scream up ahead. ‘It’s a shell cottage on the outskirts of Tamworth.’
Ron nodded to where Dumbledore was now standing, behind the podium engraved with the Hogwarts crest. Harry gave Ron a silent thank you as Hermione’s attention was immediately stolen away from the topic of his disappearance. For now, his excuse would work. But this being the first night back, Harry wasn’t sure of the many other problems that would eventually befall upon him over the rest of the school year. And to his dismay, there would be many involving Draco Malfoy.
Harry wondered what Hermione and Ron would think when they would return to a now empty carriage. Hermione especially would know he was doing something impulsive and Harry was already silent bracing himself for the lecture she would give him as the train slowed down. The Slytherin students began to chatter incessantly as they collected their trunks and caged pets and began to trail out of the carriage. All of them except Draco were standing up and as Harry noticed him wave away his friends, an uneasiness filled his gut.
Harry rose his head at the sound of footsteps, the stray tears still trailing down his placid cheekbones.
And to Harry’s relief, Cormac’s last attempted save was muddled with his broom shifting in the opposite direction, allowing the bludger to zoom past him and through the hoop. Harry smirked as the movement of the broom looked too easily swayed and as he glanced at Hermione in the stands looking incredibly guilty, he recognised her involvement.
Observing the colour of Draco’s complexion in the light, Harry realised just how malnourished he looked. His face had a gauntness that Harry recognised as a result of a mixture of nightmares and a lack of nutrition.
Harry stared at his now tense back, his mouth slightly dry. He wondered who Draco had seen die over the summer and whether this was the reason his skin was tainted with a placid elasticity. There was an excessive amount of new information about Draco that had been unveiled to Harry tonight and he figured that this was the cause of the headache now brewing in his temple. Draco’s inconsistent actions were almost giving him whiplash.
The sixth floor bathroom is empty and quiet. Harry opens the tap, puts his entire head under the flow of water, and lets the water wash away the lost bits of his mind. He tries not to laugh again, because it doesn’t feel like a day for laughing. Harry thinks he might be going mad. He’s tired and sore and wants his bed.
“Well, I think she’s been with her boyfriend for a few years now.” Malfoy raises an eyebrow at him. “Her muggle boyfriend.”
Harry nods and snuggles closer, rubs the whole length of his body against Draco; he grits his teeth to keep his budding arousal from blooming into unstoppable desire. Harry, unfortunately, has such an effect on him.
“That’s not true,” says Harry, stubborn. He sticks out his jaw and swallows a good mouthful of alcohol in an effort to fall from tipsiness to full-on drunkenness faster.
“Merlin, look at them,” says Malfoy too close, breathing hotly at Harry temple, quiet and secret. “Nothing should be as adorable as this.”
Malfoy takes an angry sip of his beer, luminous in his gloved-hand. The black leather that hides his bony fingers makes Harry teeth ache. His own fingers burn.
Harry squirms, both uncomfortable and too comfortable with Malfoy’s proximity. He’s got the weirdest urge to get closer and smell the pale length of his throat. His rational mind reminds him of basic decency and makes him want to fling himself across the room, to escape the temptation.
“Yeah, okay,” says Harry, sounding a little bit helpless, and shedding his last garment once and for all.
“That’s why we’re here. He shouldn't suffer from our inability to hold a conversation peacefully. We should be cordial when with him.”
“I wouldn’t really say ‘bringing back’ more than trying to embody his ideas of racial purity to the rest of society.”
The sheets feel crinkly and rough against his bare skin, but Draco cannot presently find it in himself to complain. He pretends not to hear the offensive way Harry slurps at his tea; he is, for the first time in a week, content.
Harry swallows and nods, only then Draco takes back his hand. They stare at each other. Harry cannot believe what he has just said. He feels like the words slipped out of his mouth, where he had them stored for the last month or so. Harry was thinking of doing it right.
Albus eats with a determination that reassures Draco, and he even toasts at the memory of his father without shedding a tear. It’s alien for Draco to raise his glass in Potter’s name, but he indulges Albus and sees the appreciative gaze Scorpius sends his way.
He gestures to the kitchen, and Harry heads there to find the mess of toddlers baking. Albus is covered in flour and seems set on the idea of putting his brother in the same state. Rose looks carefully at the proceedings from a safe distance, chewing on a clean spoon.
Draco slides his hands from hips to thighs, grabbing and demanding. Harry grinds to feel and yes, Draco is hard and interested, ready to go again. It’s an easy feat to rise on his knees and arch, to reach behind to take Draco in hand and feel the heat of him burn Harry’s palm. It’s easy to sink on him, still open and wet from their previous activity and feel the buzz of white pleasure zapping along his spine.
The sky is overcast and it’s threatening snow, but he doesn’t comment on it. Harry aggressively rubs at his eyes until he sees spots of black swim in his vision. There’s a fresh pot once he’s done, and Draco pours him his first cup immediately, piping hot.
Later in the day, when they’re walking around in the lingering summer heat of the evening, Harry turns to him and asks, “So what do you wanna do?”
They dance, molten touches that caress, insistent fingers in the dip of a collarbone, sharp nails through tangled hair. They kiss, bright and wet, and the music beats a rhythm in the small space between them. They thrum as one, gasp their next breath from the other’s mouth, melt where they’re joined.
“What do you mean?” Potter tries for perfect innocence, but his smile is wide and full of mischief. “I’m working.”
So of course, it’s not even two hours later that he’s bothered, mid-chapter. The barks are sharp and demanding, filtering in through the drapes. Draco first dismisses it as the old man living at the village walking his particularly rambunctious dog, but when it doesn’t fade away in the settling night, he pauses. Draco goes to his window and leans over, scrutinizes the grounds and the driveway.
He would be flung beyond the limit of his body if not for the firm hold Draco has on him, circling his wrist and the round curve of his shoulder, keeping him there, bones rattling. Harry is only perception. He feels the burning breath of Draco at the curve of his jaw, wet and warm and turns his head on instinct, steals an open-mouthed kiss. Tastes the want on his lips.
The tease of Malfoy’s mouth slides hotly on Harry’s hipbone and comes to rest at the base of Harry’s length, light as a butterfly. Harry groans desperately.
“Bloody hell,” the man mutters and rubs at his eyes from under his glasses, rather aggressively. “Listen, I don’t know what kind of business you have, but we don’t want any trouble here, alright?”
“I like this,” Harry pants in the space between them, and sees the flicker of something anthracite in Malfoy’s eyes. “I like this,” he repeats, because it’s the only thing he allows himself to say.
Malfoy smiles; it doesn’t reach his eyes. He leans back on his chair, crosses his legs with a show of grace and agility, feline in his purpose.
He rides Ebenezer around the grounds for the next few days, squinting at the blinding horizon until his head aches with dehydration and the horse grows restless and eager to go back to his stable. He sees nothing.
“Astoria wishes to tell David of her situation before taking any legal step in dissolving our marriage. You understand that a divorce between two families of the Twenty-Eight is bound to make a commotion; we do not wish to put Scorpius through that if it isn’t worth it for her. And the Statute of Secrecy clearly states that one should be espoused to their significant other before revealing the truth of their upbringings.”
Silence falls over them; it’s filled with the gentle swish of leaves above, the song of birds and the snuffling of Ebenezer bending down to reach the crisp grass of summer.
Draco has to swallow twice against the emotions bouncing around in his chest before being able to answer. And even then, it’s quiet and spoken around the knotted lump of his tongue.
Draco looks less than enthused at the idea, but Harry pulls him to his feet and presses their hips together, kissing the dip of a collarbone through his shirt and lets him melt into his arms. A quiet Nox pulls darkness over them. They kiss.
The sign on the door is a curved band of gold writing ‘Malfoy’s Private Investigation’ and Harry takes a short breath in, lets it sit in his chest until he aches with it and knocks on the exhalation.
Draco blinks up at him. Is this man…? That’s quite bossy of him. He supposes that muggles just work differently on this topic; wizards always seem to complicate everything.
There is bafflement that is all Potter on his face for half a second before everything flickers. Draco stands there, holding emptiness between his shaking hands. He’s red from the sun and the fury and cannot stop the tremors that course the length of his arms.
“Oh, so we’re in a truce then? You Aurors ravage my house at least twice every month and I have no right to complain?”
By the time he’s laid back on the bed, bare feet brushing on the soft cotton of the sheets, he’s found his voice back and arches away from Draco’s questing mouth enough to speak.
Even now, he feels the bubbly embarrassment of too much, the crimson flush of being at the mercy of victors. It’s still fresh and it smarts, but Draco tries to breath through it. He swallows his drink and winces; he has maybe drunk too much for the occasion. Better go to bed before he has to ask Mimpsy to roll him around, or worse, that he starts to sloppily reminisce about Hogwarts.
Draco nods, two deep movements of his head. He steals Harry’s glass where it’s laying forgotten in a precarious balance on the arm of the couch and downs it a swallow; the smoke is thick when he exhales and Harry simply watches it dissolve between them.
Harry feels himself swell with alarm; he stops moving entirely and straightens up to look Draco in the eyes.
By the time he goes back to the house, night has fallen and Draco doesn’t stop to look at his disheveled appearance in the mirror. He’s sweaty and tired, the buzzing of his mind too loud for his body. He goes straight to the liquor cabinet and pours himself a stiff finger of Scottish whiskey.
“Really, Harry? You would think that almost a decade since graduation would have calmed you down. It would be funny if it weren’t pathetic.”
Potter hums but doesn’t answer. He simply closes his eyes and the sun slanting over his face lights his skin in shades of gold. Draco almost spills his ink all over his paperwork.
It sounds silly to say it now, after six steps of a courting ritual they didn’t intend at first, but he does, he murmurs “I love you” in the hollow of his throat and sees Draco swallow it.
Draco looks at him then. He smiles; it causes Harry’s inhale to catch in his chest, lust to twist low in his gut. It’s different than the night before. Draco compels him with his softness rather than his gleaming gracefulness and its burns him.
“Albus,” Malfoy replies with a straight face. Harry always looks for the downward twitch of his mouth when he says his kid’s name, bad memories surfacing without control. It doesn’t happen this time.
He pats his jean pocket, feeling for his wand. Malfoy notes on it and tries to cross his arm; looks incredibly inconvenienced when Harry keeps his own at his side.
Even though his friends didn’t find this occurrence something worth investigating, Harry strongly felt the opposite. There was something in his brain that wouldn’t allow him to forget the image of Draco with his palm pressed against the cabinet and Harry could tell it was some type of warning from his brain.
Before either of them could make a move, they were all grasped by different, gruff-looking death eaters. Harry didn’t recognise any of them except one, the man holding Hermione was one he recognised very well. Fenrir Greyback, the ruthless, infamous werewolf.
Harry let out a sigh, already noticing a strange shade of colour seeping into the liquid in his cauldron as he lifted the ladle. He wasn’t sure if the damage was irreversible, there being nothing in the prince’s textbook to indicate what to do in this particular circumstance. Harry could only hope that strictly following the further corrected instructions would aid him in saving the contents of his cauldron, however it soon became apparent that this wasn’t going to happen.
The heat travelled up Harry’s body, enflaming his pale face and his breathing only hitched further at Draco’s subtle glance towards his lips. Something unexpected pulled at Harry’s heart but before he could begin to acknowledge it, Snape’s voice interrupted their trance.
Harry turned his head to see it was Blaise Zabini who had spoken, a smirk on his lips as his peers joined him in jeering at Harry. Draco didn’t even raise his eyes to look, seemingly uninterested in the entire affair.
‘Professor Flitwick can deal with you Potter.’ Snape said, saying his name between clenched teeth. ‘I suggest you follow me to my office Mr Malfoy.’
Hermione snorted, ‘if standing next to a cabinet makes him a death eater then aren’t we all death eaters?’
A pained look passed through Harry’s eyes at the mention of his supposed popularity amongst the girls. It was solely due to the girls who had tripped over their feet for his attention and an invite to Slughorn’s party that Harry had decided to attend solo. Inviting a random girl would only open an opportunity for an attachment to grow and he had developed a paranoia that one of them would be slipping him a love potion.
Her lingering gaze on Hermione as if she was a piece of food to devour made Ron glare at her openly. Yet, before he could say anything, the sound of footsteps made Bellatrix divert her attention.
Harry opened his mouth to ask more questions, yet the sound of footsteps made him turn towards the door. He staggered closer to the barred door as he realised it was Draco, his forehead creased with stress.
‘Come on mate, don’t look so annoyed.’ Ron said, leaning towards him. ‘You’ve already got you know who lingering around, I doubt you have to worry about Malfoy.’
Harry’s eating also remained disordered; Hermione forced food upon his plate, but he was too overwhelmed with the many concerns haunting his thoughts and dreams to swallow them. He struggled to balance the various things occurring amongst him and the approaching meeting with Professor Dumbledore would only work to frazzle his mind further. There was no escaping it anymore, Harry could only guess that this was only the calm before the storm.
As both Harry and Ron trudged into the Great Hall several minutes later, they found Hermione and Ginny already seated and smiling knowingly at them. Ron was quick to begin shovelling various breakfast foods onto his plate.
‘Draco did you hear what I said?’ Pansy Parkinson called, snapping her fingers in front of Draco’s face.
Cormac settled his venomous gaze onto Ron, searing him with silent profanities before he stormed away.
With the last day before they returned being filled with numerous order members visiting the burrow, Harry and Hermione hadn’t gotten the chance to fill Ron in on what they had witnessed in Knockturn Alley. Harry couldn’t help but find his mind consumed with Draco and the outlandish cabinet he had been touching even when Ginny had tried to gain his attention with her coy remarks.
‘I don’t need your help. I don’t care what my mother says, I’m not a child to be coddled.’ Draco’s voice rang.
Draco’s sullen features became uplifted at this, his muted lips stretching into a smile for the first time that day. His pale hair was no longer styled neatly, but messy upon his head and signalled he had worked hard to ensure the vial of Felix Felicis was his alone. And to Harry’s dismay, it was. Slughorn was haste in crowning Draco the winner as he clasped his hand onto Draco’s shoulder, suddenly more interested in the Slytherin boy.
‘Can you believe them? Coming to conclusions like that when girls can wear cologne too!’ Hermione hissed as they crossed the lawn.
‘Of course, I am.’ Draco said, the irritation in his tone made his words seem harsher. ‘Besides what does it matter, it’s not like potions class will be useful by next year.’
Harry gritted his teeth, fighting the urge to shoot Hermione an irate glare for bringing up the topic in front of Ron. The last thing he wanted was to cause any misunderstandings over his non-existent feelings for his best friend’s sister.
The hurt passed over Ron’s face in an instance and he remained quiet for several moments, looking at Harry in an undefinable way.
‘He hates me and I’m not going to beg for his forgiveness.’ Draco said immediately, wincing slightly at the mention of Theo.
‘Maybe you should interrogate him later ‘Mione.’ Ron cut in, to Harry’s relief, ‘Harry looks pretty tired and besides, Dumbledore’s about to give his welcome speech.’
Harry hadn’t realised how exhausting shopping was until it was time for their yearly back to school trip. But this time, their trip was distinctly different from the previous years. Not only did they need the security of Hagrid as they went from store to store, but every building was tainted with a sense of unease and fear. Everyone was on edge, afraid of the circumstances that had fallen upon the wizarding world with the return of Voldemort and his followers. The trio stopped outside one of the only remaining stores on the street: Madam Malkin's Robes for All Occasions.
Whatever this indecisive emotion he was currently being invaded with; Draco knew for a tangible fact that he didn’t like it in the slightest. This boy crying in front of him was the same one Draco had sworn he would hate till the day he died. Harry Potter was a boy that made his skin crawl with the sensation of insects exploring it and made him act in malicious ways, even when his better judgement warned him not to. Yet, for Draco, Harry was also a boy who ensured he couldn’t sleep at night, filling his dreams on various nights with sweet moments that made him question what his own true motives were.
‘Has it ever crossed your mind that perhaps Mr Malfoy was just committing some light window shopping?’ Dumbledore inquired.
‘We’ll see.’ Harry replied through gritted teeth, glancing at Ron who was currently being coached by Hermione on the benches.
‘And Quidditch robes and fresh grass.’ He hurriedly spluttered, trying to rectify his previous mistake.
‘Draco,’ Harry said, holding him upright as the wind blew through their hair and the water splashed against their shoes.
Draco’s mind was taken elsewhere as he heard Harry’s quiet sobs from the same deserted area behind the castle. A part of him wanted to walk away, back to the castle, to avoid facing Harry for a second time. Yet he had waited too long for another opening such as this to abandon it. And so, Draco again, took feeble steps towards Harry’s hunched figure, watching him with a softness as if his gaze was enough to break Harry further.
Harry had been too focused on analysing Draco to notice that his foot had been jerked out from the seat, causing a petite boy to trip and sprawl onto the floor of the train. A few of his fellow students laughed and jeered for him to watch where he was going. Draco, however, turned to look at the commotion and his piercing eyes lingered on the area where Harry sat. Harry held his breath as he waited for Draco’s gaze to divert itself, but it lingered for several moments.
‘Goblin,’ he said curtly, ‘come closer to the door. The rest of you stand back, I don’t want to hurt anyone.’
I'm so sorry this chapter took so long, i've sadly been really stressed and busy with school work :( But since its the weekend, the next chapter should be faster, thank you so much for the comments, i really appreciate every single one <3 also, uhh sorry drarry
As the trio exited the classroom, on route to their Transfiguration lesson, they passed by the same group of Slytherins they had just shared Potions with. Draco sat in the middle of them, listening to them praise his win in class as if he was a noble king of some sort. Harry scoffed as he heard their veiled compliments.
Harry nodded briefly, his eyes catching onto Draco’s empty seat at the Slytherin table. His mind wasn’t allowed the room to mull over this as quidditch trials readily began. To his annoyance, various girls had shown up to the try outs, the majority of them not even in Gryffindor house but eager to catch a glance at the supposed chosen one.
there's only three chapters left including an epilogue so not long left :( hopefully, the next chapter should be up by tuesday/wednesday <3 Thank you for all the comments and for reading <3 (also i apologise for all the angst)
‘Why on earth is Draco Malfoy writing letters to you?’ She said in indignation, her eyes following the words written. ‘Has he gone utterly and completely insane?’
Harry rubbed the back of his neck sheepishly, ‘well I asked Luna, but Neville had already asked her beforehand.’
This time, it was Lucius who strode towards Draco and grasped onto his shoulder. Draco became rigged at his father’s touch and frowned.
‘Change of the plans, we’re going to headquarters.’ The leader said, turning towards Harry with a sneering grin on his face. ‘I think we just caught Harry Potter.
Just in case anyone didn't catch it, the reference to Draco wearing red at the end was supposed to indicate how brave it was for him to step down from the ledge :(
Hermione glared at her boyfriend briefly before turning to Harry, ‘we know that Harry, we just want to help you, help you get through this all.’
Before Ron could open his mouth and say something enraged with bitterness, Hermione was dragging him away towards a waiter holding a tray of hor d'oeuvres.
Almost reaching the Slytherin common room, Draco was agitated and ready to explode upon the next person who interacted with him. But as a concerned looking Blaise stood waiting at the entrance, he held it back for a few moments more. When he was in the comfort of his bed with the curtains draw, that’s when Draco would cast a silencing charm and scream till his throat was sore.
Harry was moving his eyes frantically as he delved deep into thought, trying to figure out what Draco’s words exactly meant. But there was no reason for him to even think as a popping sound announced Dobby’s arrival into the room.
‘Draco Malfoy, I assume?’ Dumbledore probed; Harry nodded in response. ‘Am I right in presuming that you and Mr Malfoy have formed some kind of rivalry over the years?’
Harry stood with his mouth parted, feeling as if he was currently hallucinating this soft and feeble Draco Malfoy standing in front of him. ‘Is this some kind of joke?’
The finality in his tone left no room for Draco to argue, Harry watched as he mindlessly followed Snape. As Draco walked away, his body slumped down in defeat and Harry knew he had to overhear their conversation. He waited for them to turn the corner before he pulled out his invisibility cloak and flung it upon his body.
‘Ah yes, Miss Granger.’ Slughorn repeated, his eyes swept over towards Harry. ‘Now can anyone besides Miss Granger tell me what the second potion might be.’
The supposed headquarters the man had been talking about had been a daunting manor settled in a secluded area of the countryside. The formidable towers leered above the trio as they were pushed forward by the snatchers who were busily discussing their supposed reward if they were to turn Harry over to the Dark Lord.
Over the course of the past year, Harry had read these words so many times that he had now committed the letter to memory. No matter where the trio had travelled, he had protected the flimsy piece of paper with his life, always ensuring it was with him before they departed for another destination. Harry was unsure how such a miniscule object could exercise this much control over him. It had transformed into a different person, someone only living for the next second in which he could read Draco’s scrawled writing as if it was a drug keeping him alive.
Draco nodded, swaying on his feet as the exhaustion from spending the entire day in the room of requirement lingered upon him.
Harry almost choked on his own spit; this was the last thing he had assumed Cormac had been inquiring about. Not only was the rumour one unbeknownst to him, but the sheer interest in Cormac’s question made Harry coil in dread.
Usually such a remark would’ve been enough to make Harry chuckle, yet he was too burned out to even move his facial muscles more than necessary.
Harry scrambled onto his feet with his invisibility cloak clutched in his hands as he followed Draco who had already began walking away. They had both just about made it onto the now deserted platform when the Hogwarts Express began to move its gears for its journey back to London. Harry leaned over, his hands resting on his kneecaps as he attempted to regain his breath.
Without any more prolongation, Dobby apparated them directly onto the beach outside Bill and Fleur’s cottage. As they landed, Draco’s body knocked against Harry’s, his arms shaking vigorously.
‘I know you’re hurting; trust me I do.’ Ron said, shifting on his feet, ‘but you’re not even talking to me and Hermione anymore.’
‘But that’s the thing,’ Hermione said, looking confused for once. ‘They’re not filled with threats or crude rantings, if anything…he sounds almost kind?’
Harry sighed. He wasn’t prepared for their potion’s lessons at all, having not even expecting to be allowed into N.E.W.T classes till Professor McGonagall told him his grades were eligible. Not only did he have no book and no materials, but their potions lessons were always joined with the Slytherins. It was seemingly difficult to escape Draco recently.
‘You seem slightly distracted tonight Harry?’ Dumbledore observed, peering at Harry over his half-moon spectacles as they sat in his office.
‘I’d like a word in my office.’ He seethed. ‘I’m sure you can find your way back to the party Potter.’
Nobody ever told Harry that becoming a werewolf makes you stupid. Yes, being a werewolf gets him fired; yes, parents keep their kids away from him; yes, crowds smell awful. Everything that Hermione has told him when she began to participate in meetings of the Fund and Aid for Lycanthropy, Lycanthropic Individuals and Communities has come true.
Albus comes over everyday for the remaining of summer. He looks sheepishly at Draco from under his lashes, eternally grateful, and brings him muggle candles every other week. Draco doesn’t really get it, but he accepts them nicely enough and even lights one when he’s feeling gloomy, on the first rain of autumn.
Harry doesn’t bother to answer and steadies him with a hand at his hip. He lets Draco sink into his lap with his full weight, and feels the twinge of muscles deep in his legs from their earlier efforts. Draco looks down at him, his sharp nose taking a royal tilt as he settles himself.
Harry scrambles out of his seat to join Draco, he smells of his expansive cologne and the fragrant curry he ate earlier. He leans over his shoulders to look at the book.
Harry tries for a smile and knows that he has not quite landed by the stiff one he receives in return. He feels untethered, like two pieces of a puzzle slotting together weirdly, too big and too tight for each other; being cordial and acting like an adult in front of Malfoy feels unnatural. Andromeda brushes a hand against his arm, and he nods, grinning genuinely at her.
The kids are pliant after a few too many madeleines and let Draco and David coax them into a guest bedroom for a well-deserved nap. James fights them mildly, claiming that he is too old for naps, but changes his mind quickly when Teddy begins to yawn.
He stands up and goes to turn away, leaving Malfoy’s piercing stare behind and the need to get closer that pulls at his sternum.
Malfoy is smiling back at him, teasing, looking calm and mildly blinded by the autumn sun. The air smells wet around them, soggy leaves that no longer crush underfoot. Harry blinks. The vision doesn’t go away.
It takes a few days for him to relax, but Draco is glad to have him here, close enough to see him eat and sleep, blue-grey shadows disappearing from the tired creases of his face.
“Accident,” corrects Malfoy and Harry looks back at him alarmingly. “The Aurors in charge of the case ruled it as accident. His daughter asked me to take another look.”
Harry nods, hands in fists at his sides. He wants to rage at her, scream in her face and tear her throat with his blunt human teeth (so much sharper since she bit him), but he has nothing to take from her. She’s already lost everything.
If there is anything that you need, don’t hesitate to ask, I know what it is like to have a child in pain.
Harry frowns, feels the dip of his mouth. “I was the Auror in charge.” Harry closes his eyes on the fresh wave of hurt that washes over him. “For a short time,” he corrects.
When Scorpius finally has enough and tugs Albus with him for experimenting, Draco is left once more with Potter. He feels his gaze like a burn on the side of his face, from his temple to his jaw.
Before he leaves the room, Malfoy touches his elbow, stops him mid-step. He looks very intense there, a tad uncomfortable too. He takes a sharp inhale before speaking; Harry sees it happen and cannot shake him off, lets him talk instead.
Harry looks at him with the startled look of the naive and Draco clears his throat, grasps his wand in firm fingers.
“Alright,” Malfoy says and Harry looks back at him. He’s leaning on his hand, chin perched on the dip of his palm, looking thoughtful.
Harry strides in, tie hanging unravelled around his throat. Teddy startles so bad, water sloshes over the rim of his glass. Harry only looks at him with vague amusement.
“It was nice, being married,” he says. “I didn’t… I am not in love with Astoria, but I liked that she was my wife. I like being her husband. I like being someone’s husband, really.” He winces. “Liked.”
Draco, at the very sight of him, calls for a roast and pours them all a heavy glass of whiskey. The boys (adults really, even if Draco doesn’t want to admit it) sip at it in pained little mouthfuls, eyes shining with the glaze of the tipsy. When they’re done, Draco fixes them a Gin & Tonic and sends them to the dining room, where alcohol makes them loose enough to feast.
It’s pushing one o’clock when he apparates close to the Lizard Point, and he has to shrink back against the sharp wind off the coast. He gets his wand out and readies himself to cast a Revelio when he’s assaulted, pushed face-down on the ground, a weight pinning him down.
Harry blinks and is surprised to find his lashes wet, sticking to each other. He turns away from Ron.
Drip, drip, drop, Little April shower, Beating a tune, As you fall all around, Harry thinks wildly, feeling a bit out of his body.
Draco grimaces and conscientiously looks at his nails before answering. Grief is a painful mask to witness on him and Draco is not selfless enough to watch it spread on his face.
Malfoy groans in the next kiss but shifts to dig in his clothes, leaving half of Harry cold and shivering. He comes back with the Hawthorne wand in his elegant fingers and has to sit back, out of Harry’s reach, to cast the spell.
Draco nods and steps out of his clothes as neatly as his own impatience allows. He doesn’t bother keeping his underwear and so Harry pauses to take in the sight of him, hard and waiting. Draco tries not to redden under his stare, and let the attention embolden him, instead..
I wish to apologise. Nothing that I can say to you and your peers will ever make up for what I have done and what followed, but I am genuinely sorry for the hurt I have caused you.
‘Uh…’ Draco trailed off, surprised that Blaise was willing to continue their conversation. ‘I’m staying at Hogwarts for Christmas this year.’
Harry only nodded, too tired with the conversation to persuade his friends any further. As both Hermione and Ron left for prefect duty several minutes later, Harry found it difficult to control his jerking knee. He knew Draco was most likely in the Slytherin carriage right now, detailing his newfound death eater identity to the rest of his cronies. If only Harry could be there right now, he would hear everything and prove to Hermione and Ron that he wasn’t being paranoid.
The things I do for Dumbledore, Harry thought as Slughorn excused himself for a few moments, leaving Harry alone with a man who insisted he write an autobiography. Harry knew people saw him as a celebrity of some kind with the rumours circulating about him in the daily prophet, but he had never seen himself as anyone crucially important. If anything, he hated being the focus of the public eye, especially when it meant everyone would be closely observing his every action or word.
But Draco was significantly taken aback to see no other than the famous Harry Potter seated on the crevice between two stone pillars with his face buried in his hands. His crying was anything but loud, it was muffled and strained as his body shook with a visible fragility to it. Despite the warm weather, Harry wore a thick black hoodie double his size and now, as he sat hunched over, the blackness seemed to be swallowing him.
Draco stopped mid-sentence as he looked at the scene in front of him. At first, he saw Hermione and then moved towards Ron, his heart began to beat erratically as he finally turned towards the kneeled figure on the ground.
Harry found his patience wearing thin as he had turned away a group of squealing girls from Hufflepuff and had realised that only a handful of the girls from the Gryffindors could actually ride a broom. Harry should’ve been relishing in the attention, if it was last year, he might have been, but now it only made his skin crawl. There was something off-putting about the girls’ behaviour, it had only made him realise that he really couldn’t handle any romantic entanglements for the time being.
‘Hm, what did you say?’ Draco – to Harry’s relief – turned his attention towards the raven-haired girl.
It was this letter that had exposed his relationship with Draco to Ron. One night, several weeks ago, Harry had fallen asleep with the letter clutched in his hands and this had resulted in Ron taking it from his sleeping figure and had read its content. His reaction the next day had been much more subdued than Harry had expected. It was Ron’s reaction that he had assumed would be the most disastrous due to all of the cruel things Draco had done to them all. Yet, Ron had only stared at Harry in shock for several minutes before he had proceeded to comfort a clear anxiety ridden Harry.
Draco nodded, ‘stop looking at me Potter.’ He seethed and fastened his pace, a look of fear passing over his face momentarily before he repressed it again.
Harry felt the panic flourish through him as they were all dragged outside of the tent into the chilled night air. If they were taken to the ministry, it would be game over, everything would be over.
‘Why the fuck did you do that?’ Draco hissed at him, stormy eyes frantically darting across the room. ‘Forget this.’
Draco stood next to a tall, black cabinet that loomed over his already lean figure and made him look smaller than he was. He was touching the surface of it with his right hand as his mother spoke to the man attending the shop. An equally stern expression was spread across her features, allowing Harry to notice how alike the mother and son were. As Draco said something, both his mother and the attendant turned towards him. Draco’s body visibly stiffened as the attendant said something in response.
The colour drained from Draco’s face as Snape stalked towards them, looking ridden with rage. He ignored Harry’s presence, stopping next to Draco’s rigid figure.
Harry picked up goblet, guzzling the fizzing liquid to calm his parched throat. He detected something like speculation settle on Hermione’s face as she observed him.
By the time Harry reached outside Snape’s office, the conversation was already well under way. He pressed his ear against the door, desperate to hear it.
‘I thought you said you’d find someone?’ Hermione said disapprovingly as Harry descended from the boy’s dormitories, clad in his brand-new dress robes and clearly alone.
Draco’s expression significantly darkened at this and having not noticed Harry behind the family already waiting, they left the shop. Harry’s interest was piqued by Narcissa mentioning an appointment and he considered ignoring his curiosity for the sake of a pair of fresh robes. However, Harry found his interest could not be quelled and he took out his invisibility cloak, swinging it over his body.
‘Draco…’ Lucius muttered, causing Draco to look down at his feet. Harry’s hold only tightened at this.
With a glance at her watch and a realisation that the party had begun half an hour ago, Hermione ushered both boys out of the common room and towards Slughorn’s office. Harry hadn’t expected the party to be tainted with such a vestige of formality, however as they passed through the tight security, they walked into a room filled with people of importance. Within the vicinity of his first steps in the room, Harry had recognised a member of the weird sisters, a quidditch player he distinguished from Ron’s posters and countless ministry officials.
Ron looked from Hermione’s dishevelled appearance and frustration to Harry’s bright spark and decided on which friend to copy for this lesson. He peered curiously at whatever Harry did and followed suit. But as Harry leaned over his textbook, Ron – who had been attempting to sneak a look at the colour of his potion – accidentally spilt a portion of the vial he had been holding into it. An abrupt spark resounded from the cauldron.
Narcissa Malfoy stood near, her eyes searing holes at Madam Malkin as she listened to her son. ‘Yes, that will work just fine. We should be getting to our appointment now.’
Hermione crossed her arms over the stark wine-coloured dress she was wearing, a quiet Ron next to her was attired in dress-robes very unlike the ones from the Yule ball. The tie he was wearing matched perfectly to the colour of Hermione’s dress and Harry knew that Hermione had most likely transfigured it to match.
With his fists clenched under the table, Harry only bowed his head, knowing that saying anything further on the matter was a lost cause. No one was taking him seriously. Harry knew his suspicions weren’t a result of his hatred for Draco, after all he had considered this before. But there was something deeper, a burning feeling in his gut that was almost cancerous and had convinced him to continue pursuing his paranoia.
Harry’s mouth dried as he suddenly felt uncomfortable watching such a private moment and he almost turned away. But Draco’s shifting, rain cloud eyes that locked with his made Harry's body freeze as if he had uttered another petrifying charm upon him. There was something lurking in Draco’s eyes, something that mimicked complete and utter satisfaction that Harry was witnessing this exchange. A ghost of a smile perked onto his lips as the girl pulled away, tired of his unwillingness to give her what she wanted.
‘Let me mourn in peace then.’ Harry turned his back to him as he said this, using the sleeves of his sweatshirt to furiously rub at his eyes. He was finding it hard to control his grief lately. Harry had thought Cedric’s death was one of the most difficult things he would have to overcome, but the loss of his godfather was much more torturous.
‘Shut up Ron.’ Both Harry and Ginny chimed synchronously, causing all four of them to burst into laughter.
As Harry entered the shop, he heard Hagrid begin to tell both Ron and Hermione an amusing story about Buckbeak settling back into his previous home. He sighed as he stood behind the group of people, knowing it would probably take longer than he had originally expected.
The leader narrowed his eyes suspiciously and grabbed the clipboard from his hand and began to peer at it. Harry couldn’t believe his luck as the man looked back at him as if he suddenly believed his story. He almost let out a breath of relief before a snatcher came bursting out of the tent with the daily prophet clutched in his hold.
Cormac was unstirred by Harry’s hostile tone, ‘just wanted to see if keeper tryouts were next, I’m ready to bag the position already.’
As Harry moved towards where his peers stood at the front of the class in front of three, full cauldrons of potions he didn’t recognise, he felt an overpowering scent fill the air around him.
Harry nodded, avoiding Hermione’s eyes as he filled his plate with the roasted potatoes in front of him.
‘Hey Potter, is it true what the rumours have been saying?’ Cormac questioned, his eyes glazing over Harry in a way that seemed almost predatory.
But even this instance hadn’t been enough to uplift Harry’s mood. He was constantly stuck within a realm of longing and grief that nothing could fill. Being around Hermione and Ron who had only grown stronger with Ron’s eventual return had weakened Harry, their relationship taunted him with images of what he and Draco could’ve been. And now, all Harry was the pending doom of facing Voldemort. The entire world was depending on him, each and every day a round of wizards who had died in his cause would settle onto his shoulders and make him feel weaker than he already was. Harry didn’t know how to control his own emotions anymore, feeling immensely guilty for being heart broken when people needed him.
As an unfamiliar Slytherin student was walking into the crowded carriage reserved for sixth years, Harry quickly slipped past him. He moved towards an empty area where no one was seated and upon scanning the carriage, Harry easily located Draco ahead of him. He was seated amongst people Harry recognised as his supposed friends: Blaise Zabini, Pansy Parkinson and Vincent Crabbe.
Dumbledore shook his head, his silver beard moving along with the motion. ‘I trust Severus’s judgement and besides, you might want to give Mr Malfoy the benefit of the doubt. You and him are more alike than you may perceive.’
Harry’s brow furrowed at the kindness in Snape’s voice, it seemed out of place and he had never heard the man speak in such a gentle way.
Draco Malfoy. Harry hadn’t been able to shake him from his mind. He had desperately tried, focusing on the Quidditch trials that were quickly approaching.  But no matter what Harry diverted himself towards, Draco always seemed to dive back into his mind and settle himself down comfortably. Harry swallowed as he realised, he hadn’t told his friends about the train occurrence. Telling Hermione remained out of the question, considering how she had reacted to the textbook, she would again lecture Harry. But telling Ron…Harry knew was probably a sound idea.
He breathed in the air, allowing it to cleanse his insides as it filled him, and his fingers grazed across the stone walls as he walked. Draco closed his eyes, his feet guiding him along the familiar path; he revelled in the silence for a few moments, enjoying the solitude. But even this was short lived as the sound of soft weeping forced his eyes open. Draco stopped in place as he rounded a secluded, crumbling area behind the castle. He had expected an early year to be there, crying over the tragic death of Cedric Diggory that had seemingly shifted everyone’s mood lately.
Harry felt in his pocket for his invisibility cloak and again swept it over his body. He knew that what he was doing was reckless, after all he was potentially putting himself at risk of being caught by unfriendly Slytherins. He knew they wouldn’t take lightly to anyone – especially Harry Potter – eavesdropping on their conversations but Harry had decided it was worth a try. If only he could obtain some form of concrete proof about Malfoy, he would be nipping a problem in the bud.
“Anyway,” Harry starts, “I’m going back to uni soon, so what I was asking is…” He grabs at Draco and pulls him to a stop. He looks at him with his huge green eyes, barely hidden by the glasses. “Do you think you would be interested in moving to Oxford soon?”
Draco is suspiciously cautious when he settles back next to Harry, tray between them and Harry props himself against the pillow to study him as he pours them a drink in delicate china. Draco avoids his eyes when he gives him his tea and Harry puzzles on what could have provoked such unusual coyness in him. It was definitely not the sex. The sex was wonderful, as usual.
“Yes,” Draco answers, too fast, and has to swallow against the words that want to come spilling out. He doesn’t think they would help; he gets closer instead, brushes his knuckles against his hand. Harry, in a show of vulnerability, clutches at them without giving a glance around.
Draco ponders for a long while, staring at the ceiling and the water marks at the left corner, if he should open the letter while Harry walks his confusion off, or if he should wait for the comfort of his presence before facing the flood of his bottled-up emotions.
“Please, if you need anything,” she pushes her nails in his forearm painfully, “anything, contact me.”
“I think you should go,” Harry says very slowly. He’s two breaths away from dissolving into a heap of unspeakable desires.
“Yes, it’s a no,” then shakes his head, his hair falls over his eyes like an ethereal curtain. “Ah, well, I’m going then.”
“You don’t believe me,” says Draco. He’s a bit hurt and it smarts even more knowing that he did not expect it. It’s an exercise in subtlety to not let it show on his face. “Well, thankfully, I have brought something.”
After, Harry tucks an arm around Draco’s torso, sick with nerves at the idea of being rejected or have Draco roll over and away. But Draco only jerks minimally and tugs him closer, gets a hand around his shoulders. He listens to his breath and heartbeat, brushing under his ear, the sharp bump of his shoulder against the curve of his head.
Almost ten years after the end of the war, it seems that our Saviour and Head Auror Harry Potter is trying to definitively bury the hatchet. He was spotted in Muggle London earlier this week sharing a drink with Draco Malfoy, a [reformed] Death Eater. Our source confirms that they were talking in friendly tones, like colleagues simply grabbing a pint after work. Is it the sign that the War is finally well behind us? Read more on page 4.
Before entering the magical post, he changes his hair a rich shade of black, not unlike Harry’s, and puts some patchy whiskers around his jaws. Draco has always been good at Glamours, but he still feels sick with anxiety at the idea of someone seeing through them and calling for his Father, and so he applies two-layers of charms on his face and checks his reflection twice again to make sure that he assuredly does not look like himself.
The smile there is for him. Harry itches to kiss it. He focuses back to the end of the waltz; best not to mess it up now.
Malfoy turns to him, eyes wide. He opens his mouth to say something, but Ron steps up to them. Malfoy doesn’t speak.
“Daddy?” comes from the carpet and they jump away from each other; Harry hits his head on the door frame and congratulates himself on not swearing.
They dance; Harry wouldn’t call it a glide exactly, because his remaining clumsiness gets in the way of Draco’s habitual gracefulness, but their feet chase each other without touching, and their hands are warm on the other’s skin. The tension unravels in Harry’s chest and he finds himself more confident, more assured in every step, enough to let his body lead on his own and takes a moment to appreciate the crescents cut by light on Draco’s face.
“So sorry to bother you, but could you tell me where I could find the adequate materials to compose a letter?”
Draco feels the sweat run down his back, into the sheets and winces at the sensation and the idea of soiling them. Harry doesn’t seem to worry about it,  and pulls one to wipe off his stomach. When he catches Draco looking with mild disgust, he blushes attractively and says: “I was going to change them anyway.”
initial on your chest for the same reason that wearing your boyfriend’s jacket isn’t tacky. It’s cute.
Harry furrows his brow. “Erm. I don’t really know, honestly. They’re just not good if they fall on you.”
“I’m stealing your identity,” Draco says, slipping off his coat and scarf. “This is simply the first step.”
Under usual circumstances, Draco would’ve made a comment about how sappy Harry is while asking for more words of affirmation. But these are not usual circumstances.
Draco crosses his legs, unsure of how to best make himself comfortable. Really, the entire situation makes him uncomfortable.
“Yes, Molly,” Draco says, though he sounds like he has to choke out her name. “I’m not used to the informalities,” he apologizes.
“Mum, it’s just a little one!” Charlie insists, back turned to Draco and Harry, showing his family something.
“Young love is always interesting before you realize it’s love,” Narcissa says, fondly and with minimal bitterness. She moves aside to allow Draco and Harry into her room.
“Aww, Ronniekins, we’re just having fun! Right, Perce?” Fred looks to Percy, now a very impressive maroon color.
The time Harry and Draco spend with Narcissa makes Harry ache for the Christmas memories he might have had with his mother, or the ones he does have with Molly and the rest of the Weasleys.
“It’s rude to place monetary value on someone’s relationship status,” Percy says, sounding as if he’s winding up for another long-winded speech.
Molly’s brow furrows. She says nothing, but Harry and Draco know that she’s silently judging the Malfoys. Harry can’t blame her; he’s done the same, often. Especially when Harry reaches out for Draco and he flinches, or when Harry tells Draco he loves him and Draco looks at him like he’s expecting something unpleasant to come after. Harry’s also aware he used to be that way: terrified to call Molly by her first name, used to formalities and not speaking at all.
Viktor, who is not as awkward-looking now as he was in their teenage years, smiles at Draco. He’s grown more into himself, as they all have. “You are Draco Malfoy, of the Slytherins.”
Ron pops around from the kitchen. “Oi, then, you two! Bloody hell, we’ve been looking ‘round for you
“My family’s holidays were far less… chaotic,” Draco replies. “We mostly sat in silence and drank wine.”
Ron comes in with a butterbeer. “Harry! Bloody hell, I was worried you weren’t gonna come.” He looks at Draco. “See you’ve brought Malfoy. Good for you, bringing ‘im. Prob’ly needs some time out in the real world.”
“Always had a hunch. Either you’d try to become me, or kill me. Couldn’t figure out which until now.” Harry pushes up his glasses.
“Thank you,” he whispers, because he never felt like he’d thanked her enough when she’d saved him. He probably never could. As far as he’s concerned, there will never be a way to thank her enough for what she’s done for him; he has so many debts to people that he will never be able to repay, so many people who have died for him and sacrificed everything for him. There are people he will never be able to thank properly. He continues to profusely thank those he can. It’s the least he can do, in his opinion.
Even being in the Burrow- the second home he’d ever had, after Hogwarts, and one that has certainly never tried to kill him before- fills Harry with warmth. Between the homely feeling and Molly’s maternal worrying, he feels right at home.
“Only when the twins bother her,” Percy says. He lays his hand on top of Oliver’s with only a little hesitancy.
Harry takes him out the door they came in. Draco breathes in the chilled air and opens his butterbeer, exhaling a cloud of hot air.
Charlie turns around, a bright blue Swedish Short-Snout in a festive onesie in his arms. Harry nearly lunges himself in front of Draco, memories of his encounter with the Hungarian Horntail fresh in his mind. Though he’s aware that using himself as a human shield isn’t necessarily going to save Draco at all.
Draco smiles, so brightly Harry could light the night sky with it. When Draco is happy, he rivals the sun. “I’d like that.”
They apparate into the Leaky Cauldron and ask for Narcissa Black (it’s Draco’s idea to use her maiden name, brilliant Draco). After getting her room number, they travel up to it. Draco takes a moment to steady himself before knocking.
, as if he’s trying to remove the skin. He’s tried, before. It pushes up his sleeve to expose the mark. “Are you sure you want to do that?”
Harry kisses his sharp cheekbone lightly. Draco bites the inside of his lip and goes just the slightest bit pink.
“Heard you weren’t thinking about doing professional Quidditch,” Oliver says. “All that wasted potential!”
Draco turns to Ron with a sharp look. “I didn’t choose to leave my family,” he says. “My father disowned me.”
“I was hoping,” Harry says. He rests his arm on the back of the sofa. Draco nuzzles against his side, book entirely forgotten in his lap. “I think it’s time to start telling people about our relationship.”
happened. So… happy Christmas.” He toasts with his own butterbeer, half-full. Harry and Hermione join in.
Draco goes quiet for a second. “I don’t like it when people shout,” he says, after the pause. Getting Draco to be candid has been a struggle. It’s been just as much of a struggle for Harry to be candid and honest, as well, but he’s been doing it for longer than Draco has.
Draco sometimes wonders how Harry talks him into doing these types of things, from trying sushi to going to nightclubs to- well, this. Harry holds onto Draco’s hand outside the Burrow, both of them having apparated in front of the door.
They bleed, little cuts that feel inconsequential, that sting with the salt of their sweat. By the time they’ve damaged themselves enough to be lying down, throwing half-hearted kicks at each other, there’s light in their eyes and the gruff voice of a police officer complaining loudly at his colleague.
“Potions, obviously. One of them gave birth to an heir and a spare.” Harry looks down at his stomach, green-tinged in the pub lights. “Yes, do not think about it.” Draco leans forward, perching his chin on top of his hand. “So, wanna come over here?”
He occupies himself with details instead. His sharpened senses are much better at picking up details; Harry is conscious of the room, the touch of fabric against his hands, the granny quality of light going through the window and the knowledge that one of the glass panes is dirtier because of it.
By the time dessert rolls around, he’s at the limit between tipsy and drunk, sleepy with all the food he has ingested. Little figurines of sugar glide over the remnants of pudding, the puddle of chocolate from Astoria’s fondant a small skating rink for them to perform. David looks at them rapturously, not even bothering to lend an ear to the conversation any more. Harry and Astoria note on it at the same time, and they exchange a smile, brief and knowing.
Potter only looks at him, panting and an ear cocked towards him hopefully. Draco sighs heavily, tries to slow the wild pulse of his heart. Potter is overtly non violent, he can absolutely do this.
“Where’s Astoria?” he asks to change the subject. He’s afraid they were about to reminisce about the war.
Malfoy sneers; it looks very ugly on his face. “Yes, because I’ll sleep like a baby with a stranger in the room.”
Harry doesn’t have an answer; he has no idea why everyone is ganging up against him. He takes a drink of his wine and tucks into his spinach and cheese pie, lets the conversation sway to other matters. David looks a tad bit more comfortable now that he doesn’t have to talk and Harry lets Andromeda’s wine carafe fill his glass more than what’s advisable.
Malfoy steps in, and Harry follows under her wary gaze. She seats them in a beautiful blue parlor, with ceiling-high windows and wrings her hands as she looks anywhere but at Harry.
“They’re not that bad. And no, I ran away when I was seven. But I got adopted, after, and honestly, it was ten times better. I never regretted it.”
Harry feels a knot in his throat; it tightens in his airway and he has to push the words out, almost desperate.
Harry does. Teddy is not that discreet with his affections and is lucky that James is so oblivious. Harry has planned to talk to him about it, sometimes. Draco answers such declarations with a roll of his eyes and a pinch on his arm. He always advises to let young people navigate the dangerous waters of love by themselves.
Harry looks at the bottle, shrugs and uncaps it to sniff at the liquid. It smells like vodka. He takes a swallow and winces, fire curling in his stomach.
“I guess I could. Thank you, that is.” He takes a breath, smiling at the corner of his mouth. It’s not a pretty sight. “It got you extremely unpopular with your men. Delayed your appointment as Head Auror, didn’t it?”
“Knowing that I’m a reformed Death Eater, and thus Astoria the wife of one, I do not see an outcome that doesn’t result with the arrest of one of us.”
The second is elegant enough for Harry to take a wild guess and say that it’s Malfoy’s. He opens the window for this one and shoos the other away.
There’s an unused century-old Necromancy classroom on the fourth floor that is blood-chilling if one doesn’t have an appropriate distraction; Harry tugs Malfoy in it by his tie most days. The carpet is plush and sweet against his back and Malfoy lays there for hours, between the shelter of his legs and bites kisses into his breastbone.
Harry sits up and pushes them up his nose. Ginny sits herself in an armchair in front of him in an ill-fitting shirt and smart trousers.
Harry doesn’t know how it happens; it just does. There are insults thrown, fingers grabbing at collars, the push and pull of their bodies and suddenly, they’re kissing.
Mrs Bruegel’s eyes fall on him, and she retracts her politely offered hand with a spasm. She holds her wrist as she has been burned. The gesture cuts sharp on Harry’s tongue. He can almost taste copper.
“You already are,” Draco answers naturally, and promptly feels himself combust. “Alright,” he pushes out quickly to stop him from answering, “out of here, let’s go.”
Harry flags the bus down and they get in, not without some confusion from Draco; Harry ends up reaching in his pocket once more and sorting his money out for him.
“Yes,” says Ron and he offers his elbow for side-along. Harry stares at it and waits for Ron to retract his offer. A minute goes and he doesn’t.
Harry does. He fishes out a half-empty bottle of vodka. He looks back at Malfoy and gets a disgusted face in answer.
“Right,” says Draco. And he repeats it once more for courage. “You better not bite me, or else…” He takes a deep breath. “Harry Potter, I welcome you once more at Malfoy Manor.”
Draco pinches him in retaliation and sighs when Harry doesn’t react. He lets himself sag in the mattress.
Harry finds out then and there that Ginny is the woman of his life and loves her, again, and again, and again.
“I will,” Draco answers and pulls her into a tight hug, doesn’t hide the way he longs for her affection. She presses her hands at his back, molten warmth suffusing through his clothes and he ignores her sniffles in his shirt. “Alright, alright, I should go. I have a few rounds of Apparation to go through.”
Draco falters, feels himself relax without his consent. It was the recipe for a Schwarzwälder Kirschtorte. He remembers it because he made it after, fingers trembling as he put chocolate all over his front.
Draco is pink in the face, swallowing back words and thinking, Adam’s apple moving once, two, three times before answering.
Later, after he has slept, he will remember this encounter as a dream. He will sit in Ginny’s bed, sticky with the sweat of a summer night, and remember the bitter taste of Malfoy’s war crimes. It will roll on his tongue and fester there, until he swallows it down and remembers, often and at length, that Draco Malfoy was a kid and a coward.
His back cracks when he stands up, but Draco pretends that he cannot feel it and goes to close the windows manually.
Everything feels like a dream, and that’s why when Malfoy’s hands shake too badly to cup water, Harry does it for him. He joins his hands, lets the icy, cold water pool, and presents it to Malfoy. There is a second of wariness in his ghost-grey eyes, stark and sunken in the hungry shape of his face before he bends his silver head over Harry’s offering and drinks. His lips are dry and chapped against Harry’s cold fingers.
Harry clenches his hand on the table, trying to breath through the temperamental allure of his words. When he looks at Draco, he only sees challenge shine in the anthracite of his eyes, and Harry has to stop himself from biting.
They go and the rain goes with them. Draco is left, lashes wet and sticky, looking at Potter all against him, fever hot through his soaked clothes.
“Yes, go, you vile muggle-loving man,” she mutters, half-hiding behind a hand. She waves her wand and the charms disappear, filling the space between them with the roar of the sea, the screech of the wind.
“You look good, Harry,” he says and studiously looks anywhere else but in his direction. “Do you want something to drink?”
“No,” Harry says and watches the tension being washed away from him. “I testified because it was right.”
Harry looks heavenward, through his charm where fat drops of rain crash at regular intervals. The sound of it is soothing, but not quite enough to drone out Malfoy’s pretentiousness.
In her letters (mailed through the British Post), Pansy still complains about the peacock bites she got when she stole it from the green parlour.
By the time Scorpius comes back to him, looking so small in his funeral attire, twelve once again, the sun has set and there’s only the blue-black shadows of the Potter children bent over a grave.
Malfoy raises an eyebrow at him; he used to do that all the time, since he first mastered it in third year. On his adult face, it looks unfairly attractive.
Harry doesn’t listen to her sharp intake of breath and the ringing silence that follows his departure. He climbs the stairs clinging to the banister, joints aching and collapses on his bed.
Potter reappears in the seat in front of Draco’s at breakfast. Draco almost collapses in relief; he had believed he had banished Potter the night before. He firmly pulls on his unflinching tenacity to seem untouched by his sudden appearance.
He’s about to protest and Potter must sense it because between a blink and the other, Draco is pushed against a trunk, a warning hand at his shoulder. Potter is looking away, somewhere only he can see between the thickened woods. Draco is tempted to break the silence when it begins to rain. Heavily.
Thank you for the flowers, darling, they brighten my room. I’m sorry I wasn’t awake when you came over this morning. The doctors have upped my medication and it’s making me incredibly sleepy.
They find Draco, Astoria, David and Teddy in the glass room. Draco greets them with a scowl as he fights his gloves into submission. It makes Harry smile, to see him so inconvenienced by such a simple thing, Draco who is always impeccably gracious and poised.
Harry breathes hotly on the skin of his collarbones and obeys. He pulls at his shirt and gets to his trousers, threadbare and seconds away from ripping according to Draco’s appraisal.
Harry groans from the confines of his arms and straightens to hide in his hands. There was one such pub night with Weasley; it didn’t go well and nobody is eager to reproduce it.
Harry nods and watches her get out. The door closes and with it his desire to look remotely interested in what is going to happen to him come morning.
“Then nothing, this is for work.” Malfoy gathers the letter attached at her talon. “Thank you, Colette, it’s much appreciated.”
“Right,” says Ron and looks like he doesn’t quite know what to do with his hands. “We’re taking him in for attempted assault, but Malfoy here told me that I should open a closed case?”
Harry is well on his way to being drunk and lets his body sway to the music, lets hands – large, steady – grab his hips and bring him closer. The beat thrums deep at the back of his head; Seamus laughs in his ear and goes away once more, probably to snog a stranger in a corner.
When they see each other, they freeze up, then relax in the same heartbeat. Malfoy closes the door, and the quiet swallows them.
“Your disappearance hasn’t been made public yet. Blaise is in the know, now that he’s shagging the Gryffindor Auror twat, and Longbottom has not spilled anything about it yet, so you still have time.”
“She doesn’t help,” he says, too sharply. Harry takes a pause to consider his next words. “I… I just want to be left alone.”
Harry looks to Draco and sees the heat there; it spills into him, and spreads like wildfire in his loins. Keeping his face neutral is a struggle.
Harry grinds his cigarette butt on the wall at his shoulder and pushes back to straighten up. There is hope for him and Malfoy, still. He is the bigger adult, and he can resist cursing the git blind even when inebriated.
“Aren’t we?” retorts Malfoy, drawing a circle in the condensation of his glass with the leather of his glove.
“Don’t fuck around,” he says, half in his beard, before realisation slaps him in the face. “Is that… Corpse Bride? How do you even know a muggle film?”
Ginny chooses Lily’s name; she does it with a smile splitting her sweaty and reddened face, eyes twinkling when they look at Harry.
Harry takes his keys from the night-stand. He is careful in pushing the letter aside and it makes the hand around Draco’s heart relax infinitesimally. Harry nods twice to himself before turning around. He’s opened his door and has a step outside when he turns to speak.
Draco blinks at him and takes a deliberate sip of coffee. It’s lukewarm and tastes vile, but it occupies his hands and hides his face while he tries to puzzle out what the man’s trying to tell him.
“What are you doing here?” Draco hisses, holding his wand in front of him. It feels very small in his hand, almost brittle when faced with the great animal that is Potter in this form.
Malfoy snorts, and Harry is so surprised by it that he turns to look at him. Malfoy looks sheepish for half a second before a cool mask of superiority replaces it.
The full-moon comes and goes. They do not dance. They do not dance because reporters are crowding Harry’s doorstep, and his chimney, and his windows and his pipes (yes) and so Harry is too busy dealing with all that and three screeching children. The children are not screeching because of the divorce (they were only very distantly aware that their parents were married after all) but because howls are tapping doors and windows alike and the noise is very upsetting in the middle of the night.
He dozes for a long while. When he comes back, eyes blinking slowly in the early evening light, it’s to the sight of Draco holding a tray, standing caught in the doorway. He looks smaller in a bathrobe, feet bare.
Draco expects something to happen, but only watches Potter trying to push against his gate, whining. He has to bite back a smile despite himself; he shouldn’t find the situation funny, he has a werewolf on his hands. A rather sedate (and, from experience, cooperating) werewolf, but a werewolf all the same.
Scorpius is getting better, even if it’s very slow. His doctors are hopeful. You would think that they should be more involved than hopeful with all the money we pay them, but no such luck yet. At least, he has stopped coughing up blood since he’s begun his treatment and if you can believe it, we are to start experimenting with Muggle medication. Apparently, a blood-thinning curse shares symptoms with serious Muggle ailments.
Malfoy nods. “She seems properly stricken and desperate for justice as a loving daughter would be. She admits that they had a difficult relationship, but he was still her father. I can… Understand.”
Presently, that means waking up after the full moon to an unfamiliar ceiling, on a carpet that is too comfortable to belong to Harry, next to what looks like a bed. Harry goes to touch it; the sheet feels very soft under his fingers, a thread count that’s much too high for him.
The intruder breaths in sharply, licks his lips. Draco only presses harder in the soft skin of his throat.
The day is too hot and the black of his robes too thick; he’s sweating heavily and it sharpens the blade of his irritation. He can taste the hurt in the air, it has a shape over the proceedings. Draco feels very removed, watching from a distance, not sharing the same stinging heaviness of friends and families. He’s not happy about Potter’s death, but he can’t say that he’s very much upset about it either. It’s maybe too young to die, and that’s what really bothers him, a reminder of how flimsy life is, for Potter, for him. He doesn’t have to mourn Potter, but he may have to face the new reality that he is not immortal.
With one look from Harry, Ron complied and took a step back. The goblin trudged towards the gate and quickly hobbled out as Draco cracked it open a little bit.
Harry’s gaze lingered on Draco’s eyes, they were raw and red and were enough to get Harry to lower his wand. He was surprised that Draco was even here, in such a vulnerable state, in front of him as if he was ready to offer any form of comfort his body would allow.
‘I was just wondering where you and Miss Granger had gotten to.’ Slughorn chortled, moving past Ron to greet Hermione.
‘My father works at the ministry!’ He burst out all of a sudden, causing his best friends to look at him in bewilderment. ‘I should be on the list!’
It was a relatively cold august evening and Harry was awaiting Dumbledore’s arrival as he had outlined in his letter. Despite the excitement of assisting Dumbledore on whatever his mission tonight was, Harry’s mind was fixated on the topic of Draco Malfoy. His eyes wavered towards the pile of letters Draco had sent him over the first few weeks of their summer vacation. Some were merely a few lines, badly executed jokes but others were longer, stories that drew Harry in and made him forget the narrator was the boy he hated.
As Draco walked away for a second time, he felt his heart sting again. It was as if his and Harry’s hearts were now connected and carrying the same wavelength of pain. As if they were made to merge with each other.
‘Would you rather I say something cruel then or what?’ Draco took a few steps closer to him, yet Harry didn’t move back this time. ‘I’ve seen you cry twice now Potter and both times my father’s been part of the reason as to why. I should be angry at you like usual but, you clearly have it harder than me right now.’
‘Shouldn’t you be at home having a meeting with mother dearest and your good old friend Voldemort?’ Harry spat.
ahhh finally at the last chapter! I know a lot of you were anticipating a happy ending so I'm rlly sorry for the emotional pain I have inflicted :/ I'll be posting a short epilogue type chapter and then it's all over! Thank you sm for reading <33
‘For what my aunt did,’ Draco said helplessly, unaware as to where his indifference had disappeared to. ‘I heard he was your godfather.’
Harry laughs and Draco feels his spine loosen, almost become liquid with the relief that floods him.
The smile falls clear off his face and Draco wants to scramble to take back his words, pluck them out of the air.
“Not in public,” he whispers and Draco nods, crosses his legs, feels his wand holster against his calf.
Harry flushes, feels the heat spread from his collarbones to his forehead. Too late, he goes to cover himself with his hands and only gets an eyebrow raise from Malfoy. He’s got half the mind to turn back into a wolf if only to gather back the shredded pieces of dignity, but he’s fairly certain that’s not possible, even this close to the full moon. He should not trust his canine self anyway. He makes questionable choices.
It’s their sixth day together when Draco realizes he has been shagging Harry Potter. The epiphany hits him as he’s pouring cereal into a puddle of milk, and he shakes with the force of it.
Harry takes a careful sip of his beer. It’s a bit acid on his tongue and he takes the sharpness of it in his chest, arms his heart against Malfoy. Harry is a sloppy drunk; he always has to be extremely careful around him.
There’s a hesitancy that Draco cannot shake from the first kiss; it’s little more than a brush of lips, and the quiet rasp of Harry’s stubble against his chin, but it lights a fire in the pit of his stomach. He cannot help but push himself closer, sliding a hand to the back of Harry’s neck. Draco’s thumb grazes over his pulse and elicits a moan Harry tries to swallow; Draco presses into him, parting his lips to eat the noises that spill out.
Harry rolls onto his stomach, lets Draco pin him like that, spread over him with all his weight. There are hands at his ribs, the sharp prickles of teeth at his shoulders and the burning length of Draco against him, dragging silky-soft against his skin in small aborted movements. Harry feels close to combustion.
“Winter is winter. It would be unbecoming to not have snow for your guests to enjoy when you’re still in season.” At Harry’s raised eyebrows, he adds, “The grounds are charmed to hold the snow longer.”
Malfoy nods and taps his fingers in a rhythm on the table top. His hand looks pale and delicate in the white light of the season, blue veins curling over his knuckles.
“But… You were quite young, didn't people try to take you back home?” They did in Wizarding Britain. Ask Neville Longbottom.
“I hate, hate, hate, snowball fights. We are too old for this. If my mum were still in the country, she would be appalled,” he tells Harry with a grimace.
Harry feels his heart lurch,an up-and-down that displeases his stomach. He doesn’t think; he tugs at Malfoy’s collar, brings him close enough to be heard, breathes on him with his alcohol-heavy exhale.
Draco takes a breath and holds it in for a long moment. He lets it wheeze out of his mouth slowly, calming in its softness.
“Yes,” Harry says, because that was the agreement for today; sleepover for all interested parties. “But asleep and not moving from their bed.”
“Potter, I may have been a Death Eater six years ago, but a lot has changed since then. I’ve been tried and was punished for my actions. If you deemed that it wasn’t enough at the time, you shouldn’t have testified for me.”
So instead of saying anything, feeling wrong-footed and gauche however he turns sentences in his head, he pushes Harry against the mattress and perfects his  toe-curling blowjob technique.
Draco looks alright, interested even and so Harry gives up on pretending he understands anything and just waits for Draco to solve things. If things need solving; Harry is not sure about that. He had barely gotten a few words in when Draco had begun to ramble about the circumstances of their bonding.
“I promised you I would be cordial in front of Edward. I am a man of my word.” Belatedly, he adds, “now.”
“Violet blossom,” Draco says, after a sip. “The first flowers of the year on the grounds; they bloom farther away, on the border, where the snow is not as thick.”
In the span of a breath, Draco is soaked to the bone, cold water sinking between the layer of his robes. He gasps as drops reach the bare skin of his ribs, so very sensitive, and takes a hold of Potter shirt; black, clingy, muggle-fashioned.
The song slows, then stops. Harry and Draco follow. They find themselves entwined in the middle of a windy meadow, cold nipping at their heels through the holes of Draco’s Warming charm and they breathe.
Scorpius opens the door, already bundled up in excessive winter gear and jumping around, tugging on Al’s hand and Harry is too caught up in trying to not lose sight of them at the corner of corridors that he stops thinking about it altogether.
Draco had no plan and still doesn’t have one. He fixes a helpless gaze on Harry and waits to see if an answer arises.
The snake ripple around Draco’s finger, and moves his head in Harry’s direction. Draco inhales sharply.
He folds his newspaper and lets it rest by the side of his plate, if only to gain a few spare seconds where he doesn’t have to answer. He doesn’t
The last week had been disconcerting enough that a bit of physical contact to righten the discombobulation sounds nice. Draco has tried to be open and curious about muggle ways of life, but it’s been a challenge to keep up with the bustle and the harsh flow of people around him, the constant stream of strangers stepping on his dragonhide shoes and not apologizing. In this world, The Malfoy name has no weight, and Draco feels cowed by the realization that he has achieved nothing but being born into the right house.
“A dragon charm, obviously. A very good one. I never had great interest in the Weasleys’ works, but I have to say they’re decent at their job.”
Harry dips his head in acknowledgement and takes a sip of his drink; he feels like he’s going to need it.
Secretly, Draco had been immensely grateful. He had gone home that day and cried until he ached with it. He never ever mentioned it to anyone, but he has since kept his wand in unparalleled conditions.
“We are in Wizarding Britain, Harry, no one cares about that here. Look,” he shows a corner of the pub with his chin, where two young wizards are necking. “We have none of the muggle reservations on the subject here.”
“Oh yes, let us all put the blame on my Grandfather Abraxas’s proclivities! You Aurors  look for reasons to send me to Azkaban by looking in rooms where no one has set foot in two centuries.”
“How much can you see without your glasses?” asks Draco, and he’s surprised by the arousal that washes over him when Harry turns to him.
“You’re not proposing to me right now,” Draco says firmly, face aflame in the yellow light. “I expect flowers and a decent amount of wooing.”
Potter is silent for a long moment and Draco has to turn and see if he’s still here or if he has puffed out of existence, as he tends to do.
He presses a kiss between Harry’s shoulders, and lingers for an additional second before pulling out of the embrace. He takes a sharp inhale and closes his eyes against the sting of tears. Draco is well-aware that this could be the last he sees of Harry for a while. He hopes Pansy hasn’t been careless.
“I’m gay.” He sees Hermione’s face slacken with shock. Harry hastens to continue. “She’s… We rushed after the war. Maybe we shouldn’t have, but we have James, and it’s not… It’s really not bad in any way.”
“Marriage between wizards, and witches for that matter, has been a common occurrence for centuries now. I believe I have great-great-great-grandfathers who had similar proclivities to mine.”
Draco cannot talk and simply nods, opens up his arms when Harry collapses into him. He lets Harry get close; closer again despite the heat. He slides a hand through the curls, at the base of Harry’s skull and untangles them with his fingers, consciously and with a patience he has never found in himself before.
Draco wants to protest but the waiter walks very fast and so he follows. He only has enough breath to answer.
“That doesn’t ring a bell,” says Malfoy thoughtfully. “You might want to look under the pillow before you settle down.”
Draco does kiss him. Harry melts into it and burrows closer in his arms, burning skin the shelter to his cold fingers. He wants to melt through his clothes and his skin, find a space in Draco’s chest for him to live here. He’s breathless with the need to get closer, to never go anywhere else than his arms.
“I can get out of your hair tonight,” he says firmly, looking Harry right in the eyes, daring him to say anything about the flush of his face.
Draco feels himself pinch all over, already cursing Potter in his head for letting his son out when he looks this bad before remembrance overcomes him, and he almost trips on his way to greet him. Right. Potter is dead.
Harry stops next to him and nudges a rock with the toe of his trainers, looking thoughtful and distant.
“I’m not blowing off some steam, I was just having fun.” He remembers Seamus. He wonders if he saw him get arrested. “With friends.”
They go and Harry does his hardest at ignoring the pointed stares of his former colleagues. They had almost been family once; now he can only see the aborted disgust on their face, the pain and pity of being in the same room as a beast. This is why Harry doesn’t go out in public anymore.
Nothing happens when Draco gets close, and so he marches on, wand raised in front of him and a Protego on his lips. His steps lose in confidence as he gets closer, up until he’s right in front of it and nothing has happened. His heart is a wild beast in his throat, pounding loud enough to echo in his skull.
But then steps echo and bounce on the old stones of the corridor they stand in, twisted together and Malfoy pushes him away and Harry’s skull smarts with the violence of it.
Draco has thought of finding the most disgusting place around and sending a card to his father, but he has yet to settle on an address.
Harry shakes his head, glasses sliding; his hands move over the expense of Malfoy’s chest, the feathery hair of his stomach, the pink bloom of his nipples. He watches as the skin pebbles following his path. His mouth is dry. He needs Malfoy. He needs him right now.
Malfoy, ever polite, gently shakes his head and seats himself, leaving the man in a standing position of power.
Harry takes his hand closer, and rubs at the discolouration there, he opens his mouth to answer, something teasing and inconsequential before the words dry in his mouth and Harry is helpless to stare. The line feels very familiar; a simple band that comes apart in a small following of dots around his finger. Harry has seen it under his own ring more time that he can count.
Harry has to blink back tears and dabs his mouth with the back of his coat. He puts his cup down and resolves himself to never drink anything when Malfoy is talking.
Harry flushes, the reality of the situation suddenly dwells on him. He is (gloriously) shagging Astoria’s husband and they’re not being very discreet about it. Astoria must see something on his face, because she giggles, mirthful creases on her face.
I heard about Scorpius. I’m in charge of the case, and I’ll catch the bastard who did that to a kid.
“Sure. Let’s get some tea.” He looks over Malfoy’s shoulder, at the belligerent open space and adds, “You okay with going outside?”
Draco bites the inside of his cheek, but cannot stop the words from spilling out. They taste bitter. “And why did you, then?”
Pansy is aghast; she gets her wand out and throws a Silencing Charm around them. Everything quiets and there’s a ringing in their ears, more an absence than an actual sound.
Malfoy looks up at him with wide eyes before nodding. It’s a short movement of his head that makes light spill on the silver of his hair.
“Gay sex is nothing but decadent, Harry. The end goal is rarely a baby.” His eyes shine almost blue in the afternoon light.
Harry sides to Draco and pulls on his scarf until he has it away from his face, where he was previously battling it.
There’s only one door at the end of the hall. Harry knocks on it, his heart a wild beast of anticipation in his chest.
Albus comes to the Manor two days later, looking empty and wan, like a flame drowning in wax, sputtering to keep going but in the end, unsuccessful.
“Actually, yes. Lately he’s been trying to plan how to get Scorpius to school with him without your knowledge. Don’t be surprised if he requests that you send him there.”
“Thank you,” Malfoy says, clipped, before pushing the bottle of said cognac in Harry unwaiting hands.
Draco cannot answer; his throat is closing up and his legs feel like reeds, ready to fold under his weight at the softest breeze. He shakes his head and clings closer, until he has his nose buried in Harry’s shoulder and has his arms around him.
Draco waves a dismissive hand, peering at the beanies hanging on the wall and selecting a plain one. It’s probably Erika’s.
Midnight finds them in the library, ostentatiously more sober and poring over volumes that Hermione would give her spine for.
“Bedroom,” Draco chokes out and Harry bodily lifts him against his front and wrestles him into walking.
Ron pauses for a second. He is not looking at Harry when he answers. “A trial and probably Azkaban after.”
I’ll probably be in Azkaban by the time you get around to reading this, if the Prophet is to be believed on how busy you are.
Harry’s flat is less messy than expected. Draco doesn’t know what he expected exactly, but it certainly isn’t the neat living room they spill into, with the small decorative cushions and the overloaded bookshelves. It’s probably Harry’s hair that gives this impression; it curls, defying gravity and common sense, looking unkempt and rugged, so Draco had surmised his home would follow suit.
