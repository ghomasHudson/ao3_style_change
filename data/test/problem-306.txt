At least this time he hoped it had worked.
Even as he heard someone start weeping, he ate. There was nothing left to do.
Draco was shocked. He couldn't understand the rage, but he also wasn't eager to be cut to pieces again. Draco loved Harry Potter, but he was also terrible at handling pain.
Harry sighed into his plate. It was everything he loved, but even now he couldn't eat too much at once. He'd get sick if he tried, but my god was he tired of it. So, he ate. He ate the mashed potatoes for Ron, who hadn't come back because of the grief. He ate the treacle tart in the desperate hope that it would fill the hole in his heart. He ate because he could.
"It's not about Malfoy or Greyback or even you. It's about stopping a cycle. Malfoy's done it, he's changed I've seen it. He's done everything he could away from the eyes of the media and people like you. If that isn't enough for you, then maybe you're the problem. You're the one everybody else needs to get rid of."
Harry had been mortified when Malfoy had commented on his silencing charms.
"Potter," he had winced even as he started, tired green eyes met his with the contempt he was used to, "you might want to renew the charms around your bed. I believe they aren't functioning as they're supposed to."
He remembered stepping in front of Pansy, trying to protect her from the worst. For a second it was like he was back in the war, stepping in front of his mother begging for her life.
Everybody was tired.
"I won't. I'm telling you I hadn't seen him in three days!"
He wonders what happened to those kids.
But, he looked really comfortable. Harry wanted to feel that comfortable.
Harry knew where he was going with this. It seemed like his life was a continuous stream of arguing for Malfoy these days. He had this argument memorised.
He had learnt that interrupting the nightmares meant a trip to the infirmary. The first and only time he had rushed to Harry's side, hoping to save him for once, he had been rewarded with a hex that left him more scars on his chest.
He couldn't help raising his voice. Madame Pomfrey simply shot them a look. It wasn't enough to quell Harry's rage.
It was a good thing Pansy had found him when she did. Harry hadn't woken up or he hadn't bothered to deal with Draco bleeding next to his bed.
Pansy was tired.
"I don't know what he still sees in your pathetic self."
Would it have been better if hadn't made it out of the war? Would they have been happier?
Draco knew this because she told him. When she was wrapped in his arms, the welts healed and abuse fresh in her mind, she had whispered about how tired she was. Even as she slowly dipped further into the more deadly potions in the stock her parents sent along, she mentioned how tired she was. Draco could only hold her close. After all, she had only come because of him, and he was tired of the ones he loved being hurt.
Draco woke up cold and tired.
It seemed like more effort to breathe in and open his eyes. Draco was so tired.
"He deserves it," one of the Ravenclaws piped up, Harry thought he was stupid," he was a Death Eater, surely he deserves it?"
He thought they were fine. Ron had never complained after all. And what was that he said about being cut to ribbons?
"Don't come near him again, Potter."
So, he had tried. Choosing the time right before he left for class - because the Saviour wasn't ever in his classes - to broach the subject.
"And for all of you who stood by watching, remember that Malfoy's blood is on your hands now. You lot aren't any better than he is now. You've all become everything you hate. Think about that before you run around trying to make your own justice."
There it was. Again. He'd hurt Malfoy again. What did that mean?
A chance to unite the houses, Mcgonagall had said, by putting aside the past.
"If he would tell me then maybe I'd know!" Harry snapped. Pansy visibly drew back in fear. Harry couldn't even feel bad about it. At least Malfoy hadn't woken up.
"Tell me, what did you do during the war?" Harry stepped up.
With those words, Hermione Granger seemed to deflate before his eyes. His best friend simply walked away, her shoulders hunched and dark.
Harry was tired.
Harry was torn between his need to help and pure satisfaction. They had attracted a lot of attention, many looked to Harry to see what he'd do. In the end, he didn't get a chance to make up his mind. As he watched the Ravenclaws prepare to cast what looked like another crucio, their wands flew out of their hands.
"Let me take him to the Hospital Wing, Parkinson."
Harry hated that name. He was so tired.
Harry was too tired to protest.
Simple, right? It was rude, it was simply observational. At the sight of Harry's face rapidly paling, Draco rushed to make things better.
Draco was quick to notice that he wasn't the only one that couldn't sleep. Harry's curtains might have been shut, but his screams slipped through the charms. He had to lie awake each night listening to Harry whimper in the dark.
She simply glared at him as she cast weak healing spells on Malfoy. He was paler than usual, Harry noted, barely breathing even as he twitched from time to time.
"Draco!"
"I can tell you what Malfoy did."
Draco was tired.
That night there were no screams. Draco still couldn't sleep, his mind racing with concern, fear, and memories of a time not long gone.
Draco sighed, he felt the breath leave him heavily. He didn't take another.
His breath came to him as soon as grey met green. It was quite funny when Draco thought about it. Wasn't it always Harry who gave him his life back?
Like a child, he held his breath.
All he ended up seeing was a couple of Ravenclaws with the jinxes trained on an unarmed body as Parkinson shrieked for them to stop as she struggled against the grasp of a seventh year.
"Thank god," Even as the pain hit him he could hear Harry, " you're alive."
Draco smiled.
Draco looked once more before he caught the glare of Hermoine Granger. He was too tired to care. Let her hate, he thought, it's nothing I don't deserve. Even as he moved the peas around his plate and Pansy leaned heavily on his shoulder, he sighed and thought about how tired he was.
He was so tired.
Not like anybody could stop him. Not like Malfoy would. He had known about that ridiculous crush for a while. He was faintly disgusted by the thought of Draco Malfoy caring about him at all.
Weren't they only kids when they were asked to fight in a war?
"Does nobody understand the concept of justice?" Hermoine started. Pansy had fallen quiet at the cold tone.
All three Gryffindors rolled their eyes at them, thanking the Sorting Hat for putting them in Gryffindor.
He didn’t register that Draco looked one last time back at him with bright eyes before the blond rounded the corner and got out of sight. Harry felt too numb, too done with everything. He was nothing more than an empty shell as he stood there and fell apart.
"Nope," Harry said, letting the
Pansy was sitting in the common room and startled when the entrance burst open and a sudden flurry of blond hair with billowing robes passed by her as though a miniature storm had hit her. The small glimpse she had gotten of Draco's face had told her enough. Something had gone horribly wrong. Draco would never let his guard down in such a way, especially not where anyone could see him. She jumped up quickly; the Witch Weekly she had been reading was left forgotten on the table, as she ran after him.
A week had passed since the incident and Harry was at his wits' end. He had tried several times to catch Draco alone, so he could talk to him, try to explain. But there was always either Parkinson around him, who treated Harry with profoundly evil insults, or Zabini had wrapped his arms around Draco's waist, laughing directly in Harry's face before pulling Draco out of the room with him.
Hermione shook her head, "No, we need to fix this. I will try to talk to him. Just be near when I do, I don't trust him to not hex me."
Hermione finally suggested, after sitting brooding in front of the fireplace, he should write to Draco, explaining everything and beg for forgiveness.
Harry hadn’t noticed and Hermione only laughed into her hand which she had clasped over her mouth.
"I would,” she quipped, smiling at him.
"Erm, guys? There’s something I want to tell you," Harry stuttered, eyes darting between his two friends wildly.
"You don't say?" Blaise drawled sarcastically.
"Erm, thank you, Hermione, and ... yes?" Harry said-asked, not certain if he should say more, given Ron's reaction.
Harry's body was bowed over Draco's back as he thrust into the willing hole of the Slytherin's body. His breath was erratic, his fingers clutching tightly at the blond's hips, leaving bruising imprints. He felt Draco's velvet channel clutching him tightly, massaging his hot rod from the tip to the root with every back and forth of his hips.
He had sneaked after Draco and Zabini again after dinner. The two had descended to the dungeons together, their elbows in constant contact. Harry was seething with jealousy. Why did this pompous pretty-boy Zabini have to keep touching Draco?
"Harry!" Hermione exclaimed urgently. "What are you doing? He looked so horrible hurt. Go after him. NOW!" She shoved Ron violently to the side and gave Harry also a shove to his back.
They kissed fiercely, till they were both breathless and broke apart, still clutching at each other for dear life. The dark-haired boy whispered hoarsely, "I’ve missed you so much," and tightened the grip he had on Draco's waist pulling the blond even closer to him.
He looked up to the sky and watched the clouds pass by. He enjoyed the peace and quiet that had come after the war. Until something dropped on his forehead. Instinctively, his seeker reflexes kicked in and he snatched the parchment out of the air before it could tumble down to the ground.
When the words were out his face fell. ‘
Draco sighed and then smiled at his friend, "Let’s forget about that subject. Let us go, I‘m starving."
The spectacle was breathtaking and nerve-wracking, every year anew and when Harry took his usual seat at the Gryffindor table, he groaned loudly as a downright owl storm descended on him and drowned him in a mountain of pink letters and chocolate hearts.
The kiss was so caring that it hurt and made Draco almost sob. He felt the apology radiating off Harry's chapped lips cruising through his body, as the last of his tension washed away. He had already forgiven his stupid boyfriend with this kiss but he was now curious about what his Gryffindor had planned for him. Luckily he didn't need to wait long to find out.
Draco needed a friend, now more than ever, and was happy inside that the other had offered.
Harry cursed heartily and looked up. "You remember when you said that I should go and hold hands with Malfoy?”
Harry laughed lightly, "Yeah, that too."
Draco groaned, "I can’t even begin to describe how exhausted this whole ordeal is." He waved his hand dramatically to show that he meant everything around him. "I think you know that I get hate mail almost every day. Even McGonagall‘s warning didn’t do much about it. And if that wasn’t enough…" Draco paused and pressed his lips together. He almost gave away what he got at breakfast on Saturday, but luckily he was able to resist it at the last moment.
"Why did he lie? It's been two years, Pans. Fucking two years!" Draco said, suddenly agitated with anger. He pushed slightly back from Pansy's warm body to look into her face. "Just last month, he told me that he loves me and that he wanted to be with me. And the idiot that I am let him into my life, into my mind, my heart, my body. I fucking gave him my first time, Pans, and for what? He lied, he pulled one over me, talked about me behind my back with his friends and I still can't-," Draco's breath shuddered as the last image of Harry sprang to his mind. Harry standing there where he had left him. Trembling, tears falling from his green eyes and running down his tanned cheeks, dripping off the jawline that he loved to kiss. "The sight of him after we were done ... he looked so broken, empty. I wanted to go to him, but I didn't- couldn't…" Draco's eyes searched Pansy's for answers to the urgent question squeezing his heart. "Did I do the right thing, Pans?"
“FUCK!" he exhaled heavily and then deflated visibly, "I made the biggest mistake of my life and now Draco is... he’s fucking... gone... Just like that... Like I don't even matter to him... He already has found someone else and-," Harry pressed the heels of his hands against his burning eyes, pushing up his glasses with it. "-and I don't want to be without him, I love him."
Draco looked up and quirked one of his elegant eyebrows. "Are you done with the Herbology essay for Professor Sprout?” he asked going back to his own Transfiguration homework.
Malfoy’s slow drawl let Harry snap his head up.
"Isn't Malfoy together with Zabini?"
Pansy had the most fun with it all. She took to dropping ambiguous innuendos or groaning suggestively when Weasley was near them. She couldn't wait to get her hands on the second part of the story.
Harry had given the letter to Draco's owl which delivered it at breakfast on the ninth day after their break-up.
Suddenly the pillow flew by him and he came face to face with fierce green eyes. "No, fuck! Nothing is alright." Harry spat, letting Ron recoil, and then all fight was gone from his body. He covered his face in his hands and Ron noticed that the tips of his ears began to show a deep red blush.
Was it to give Draco the ultimate blow for being on the wrong side of the war? Was that the background of Harry’s sick game?
"FUN?” Ron suddenly bellowed and sprung up from his chair, making it fall over. "Have you gone around the bend, Harry?” His cheeks colored again and his breath was coming in rushes as he tried to not hyperventilate.
"Parkinson, if you moan one more time into my ear I’ll skin you alive,” Ron growled and huffed as he stemmed a huge flower pot on the table in front of them. "Aww~ is Ronniekins embarrassed?” Pansy chuckled and flicked a pebble of dirt in his direction.
Draco closed the letter and put it back in the bottom of his trunk. He felt sad again, feeling as if the pressure from back then, was now back on his shoulders. He missed Harry so much. His unruly hair, his green eyes, his reassuring smile. Why had he taken Blaise's offer to be fake boyfriends? In the last few weeks, he had seen how hurt Harry was by this. More often than not he almost gave in to the temptation, but Blaise had held him back every time, saying, "If that is all Potter does to get you back, he's not worth it."
A quick
A guffaw escaped Draco’s mouth at that and he clapped a hand in horror over it. Malfoys didn't guffaw. But he couldn’t hold the snicker in when Hermione waggled telling her brows at him.
Harry felt honored and amazed every time that his former enemy trusted him so much. Even after two years of a secret relationship, Harry still sometimes couldn't believe that Draco was his. And this time he had almost lost him due to his own stupidity. Now it was time to make it up to him.
He shuddered at the thought; his pajamas soaked in sweat and blinked furiously tears out of his eyes. He knew it was just a nightmare. He tried to calm down as he remembered the night he almost accidentally killed his beloved.
Okay, maybe he would be caught in Madam Puddifoot‘s if the exotic teas described in the story were real. Maybe he could check it out at the weekend when they got down to Hogsmeade.
He was immediately surrounded by strong arms and a wild mop of hair had blocked his view when a pair of hot demanding lips conquered his own.
He suddenly looked up at Ron, making the ginger flinch violently. "Weasley I apologize for calling you poor and making fun of your family. I'm terribly sorry about what happened to your brothers and I know I can never make it up to you, but I hope that one day you can forgive me, not for my sake but for yourself," he said seriously, tensed with nerves. Ron had turned pale when Malfoy had mentioned his brothers, but gave a short nod that he had understood, not accepted, but it was a start. Malfoy then shifted his eyes to Hermione. "Granger, I apologize for calling you the M-word and that I was an insufferable git to you. I can't do well what my aunt did to you, but I hope that one day the mental wounds will heal even if the scar remains." Then he rounded to Harry. "Potter I-," he began but Harry stopped him with a raised hand. "That is quite enough Malfoy. I accept your apology under one condition," Harry said grinning. "Friends and first name basis?" he asked and stretched out his hand for Malfoy to shake. The blond Slytherin looked for a moment puzzled at Harry's hand and a deep longing creped into his silvery eyes. Then he nodded and took it, "Yes, friends... uhm, Harry."
As always on this particular day of the year, the great hall was in a state of commotion. Dozens of owls circled over their heads with pink letters or dropped boxes of confectionery here and there on their partially unsuspecting victims. Everywhere you saw pink smoky hearts floating in the air or heard the popping of sweets that two students pulled at both ends, with the roaring cheers from their friends, to be showered in hundreds of red miniature hearts with a pink glitter rain.
"What do you have there, Harry?" Hermione asked and snatched the parchment from his fingers before he could react. He tried to get it back, but Hermione being Hermione she was already halfway through the story no matter how fast he snatched it back.
The scroll bounced off of Harry's head and landed right into Draco’s fish and chips. The blonde Slytherin looked at it in disgust as he fished it out of the vinegar puddle he had accidentally created earlier. "Urg, Bon Appetit," he groused, handing it over to Harry and whipped his hands with the napkin. Harry snorted at the unintentional joke and put the parchment to the side, ignoring it completely.
Harry's chest contracted painfully at the thought and his hand clenched into a trembling fist around his fork.
"W-what?" Draco asked, astonished, and blinked at his friends.
He cursed under his breath as he saw his face in the mirror. He looked like an Inferi. Skin grey, bloodshot eyes, and deep blue shadows beneath them. "Brilliant!" he groused and scrubbed his teeth until he tasted blood.
Hermione suddenly groaned and got fifty shades of red while burying her face into her hands. “What did Pansy tell you?" she mumbled through her fingers, shooting him an appraising gaze.
Harry couldn’t believe his ears even if he had already thought that Draco used Zabini to get back at him. The only words that rang through his head were that Draco missed him and wanted him back. Before he could even think, his feet started moving on their own. He was through the door, grabbing Draco’s arm, and pulled him against his body while his invisibility cloak fell to the ground around him. Heedlessly of Zabini’s presence, his other hand found its way to the blond’s neck and he pulled him in, their lips crashing together passionately.
"Mate," Ron said, sighing, "this is a strategic plan to let you pay, and it bloody sucks. Is Malfoy really worth making such a fuss over though? He's a sodding Death Eater, Harry!"
When Draco sank completely relaxed into the mattress, Harry stripped off his own clothes and lay down on the warm body of his loved one. He started kissing Draco. First his ear, then his high cheekbones, down his neck, just every inch of skin he could reach. His own desire pulsed between Draco's buttocks and Harry rubbed it up and down with small pushing movements over the oil slippery skin with relish.
Once Harry was gone, Minerva McGonagall turned to Dumbledore's portrait. "Albus, do you think that the two can overcome their differences this time and get back together? The students didn't seem to know that the two were a couple, but this return of open enmity between them seems to set the other students on edge. I fear that there could be riots between the houses again if we don't stop it soon."
Draco, who hadn't heard anything of the conversation, froze in mid-step when he recognized the boy the Weaslette was hugging. Immediately a sharp pain shot through his heart and he suddenly had problems breathing properly. He braced himself with one hand against the wall of the house while his other tensed up in his sweater over his heart.
Draco was starting to feel sorry for Harry. Time and again the Slytherin’s had blocked his attempts and meanwhile, it looked as if Harry had given up, although Draco could still see him looking over at him, he no longer came as close. Still, Draco had the feeling that Harry was always around. He knew about his invisibility cloak, they had used it often to meet secretly. But he saw no reason why Harry would need to start using it again now since Draco was out and about with Blaise as often as possible. It was a strange feeling and Draco was afraid he wasn't quite right in his head. The stress of breaking up with his boyfriend and then fake dating his best friend was taking a toll on his mind.
Squirming in his seat, he suddenly froze and noticed with horror creeping up his chest, that he wasn’t unaffected by what he had just read. The blush that had found its way onto his cheeks washed out in an instant and his already pale skin lost all of its remaining color as he glanced down between his legs. No! This couldn’t happen to him! He wasn’t turned on! He couldn’t! This was …
Harry choked on his cornflakes and groused out between coughing to get his windpipe cleaned, "No, … no-thin..”
"You are alright with it?" Ron shrieked appalled.
Frothing at the mouth, Draco looked at his nails. It didn't look too bad actually. The silvery-blue was crisscrossed with fine white lines that kept forming new patterns. Pansy had done a really good job, but it was still done against his will. So he took out his wand and tried a
Draco snorted, "That is the right way to address me. Now come here, you stupid git. I fucking missed you. You have a lot to make up for." With that Draco jerked Harry toward him and crashed their lips once again together. He kissed the Gryffindor so hard that his green eyes looked completely dazed when they pulled apart. "I love you," Harry breathed against Draco’s parted lips and tried to snatch them again. Having Draco back in his arms felt like he was coming home and he couldn’t get enough of it. But the blond stepped back. "I think we should change our location. Then you can show me just how much you love me," Draco said with a lascivious smirk.
"So, who is the lucky boy, then?" Blaise asked incredulously, with the emphasis on
Harry’s head whipped around. "You get them, too?" he asked astonished and while his attention was diverted, Hermione snatched the scroll and placed it into Pansy’s waiting hands beneath the table.
Blaise and Pansy looked at each other and then back to Harry. "Slytherin!" they said in unison and began cackling.
Draco felt more than saw as soft bindings wrapped around his wrists and ankles and bound him tightly to the bed. It heightened his senses even more and Harry's mouth showed no mercy. The Gryffindor licked and sucked, sometimes he pushed only the tip of his forefinger into Draco's opening. But he never got deep enough to fill Draco's twitching hole.
Blaise looked at him with slightly glazed eyes as if in deep thought, then shrugged. He seemed to have come to a satisfactory conclusion and sent a Cheshire grin to Draco. Reassuring him that they were fine, no matter whom Draco dated.
"Uff, that was one tease too much for him," Blaise said, rolling his eyes.
Ron gaped at them in shock, pleading Harry with his eyes to tell him that it wasn’t true. Before Harry could open his mouth though, a red-faced Malfoy sprung up from his chair and was out the door faster than anyone could react.
Malfoy smirked and Harry‘s heart stuttered at the sight. It came so sudden and unprepared that he stumbled startled backward and almost hit his head against the stone wall. Almost.
"Uhm… yeah… you see… I wanted to apologize to you about my behavior from before about… Malfoy and the bullying… Uhm, I get it now. So… sorry about that,” reeled Ron, glad that he'd finally said it. Now he just hoped his friend would forgive him.
"I... well... yes, fuck, yes, it's Draco. Goddammit, Hermione. You witnessed Ron's reaction to his name alone. What do you think will happen when I tell him I have the hots for Draco Malfoy?" Harry exclaimed, muttering under his breath and pulling at his messy hair.
Harry glared at him, "If I hadn't listened to your stupid chatter, it wouldn't have lost him in the first place. And yes Ron, he's worth the effort. Don't even question that. I just want to be happy after everything and he is the one who makes me happy. So live with it. I'm done with doing as I'm told to and doing what everyone else wants me to. This is my life and I need him. Don't you get it?" Harry spat in frustration at his best friend.
"Granger-," Draco called after her, also getting up.
"Hermione," she corrected, waiting for him.
"Harry! What are you doing?” Hermione asked aghast as she sat down in front of him and placed a tome beside her plate, eyeing his breakfast warily.
Hermione chuckled, mirroring Pansy’s expression, and a certain kind of knowledge settled into her mind when she thought back to Harry’s reaction. He hadn’t seemed all too upset about it. Rather amused and curious. She smiled to herself, "I‘ll make sure he gets it."
The first group seemed to be harmless at first glance. There were a couple of girls and a boy who met in the library every week. Not to study, Ron had already found out that much. As much as they wrote, talked, and laughed it could not be homework. What worried him about this group were the looks they gave Harry, Zabini, Malfoy, and himself. Every time he got close to the group to find out more, they did a
"I think he has something for you," Blaise said with curiosity clearly on his face, as he watched the confident attitude of the approaching Gryffindor.
His mind set was an icy cold rage, as he got up from his seat by the window. He stalked over to the Golden Trio, just as Granger came back with Potter from their little side talk he hadn't managed to hear.
Feeling his cheeks catch on fire, he stuffed the sodding paper into his trouser pocket while looking anywhere but the girls.
pop and shoved another bite of fish into his mouth.
Pansy and Blaise nodded, both wishing their friend would have chosen someone different to fall in love with, but since something like love couldn't be influenced willingly, they hoped Draco had found his luck with Potter. Thus they would hold their mouths shut and hope for the best.
"Erm-" Harry began, but Ron shouted enraged, cutting Harry off mid-sentence, "No way, who in their right mind would like that pointy, rude, arrogant ass? He’s fucking Death Eater scum!"
“How are Lerch and Malcier?” Harry asked.
“Just curious I guess,” Potter said.
“Yes, I do.”
“And you are?”
He chose a cozy restaurant outside of London in a small Wizarding community. He was the first one to arrive and the five minutes until Draco appeared at the entrance had been torture.
That was the title of the new book. It was inspired by the story Harry had told him about Snape and Lily one night, but it was also kind of his and Harry’s story.
“You want me to fuck you?”
“Please don’t,” Draco answered, taking a sip of the excellent tea Blaise had served him.
“I don’t think I have to say it, but I will do it anyway, I don’t like this,” Harry said that evening after everyone had finally left and Draco had tuned into the wards to feel them hum in his veins.
It was true, since Harry had lost his virginity three weeks ago, he had been wanting sex a lot. Draco wasn’t complaining, at all, because sex with Harry was amazing and it got better the more they did it. He was still discovering little things about Harry, but his praise kink was doing it for Draco big time too.
Draco smiled. Harry had been right, he got along just fine with his new temperamental owl.
“Yes, the heart,” Harry said.
Was there a good way to start this conversation? Not really, or if there was, then Harry had never learned it.
“One does not become a vampire, one is born a vampire,” Antoine replied.
“Like what?” Draco asked.
“Just so you know, I don’t like this.”
“Well,” Draco said entering the cottage.
And by his tone, Harry had the feeling that part of the conversation was over, they went back to their battle plans.
“I walked out of the forest and then I walked home,” Draco replied. “I took a shower, I put on clothes. I ate, slept, and did it all again the next day and the next. Life went on.”
“And the lives of others,” Draco admitted. “Fuck,” he ran a hand through his hair. “I was a wreck my sixth year here, the day you found me in the bathroom and-“ he cut himself off. “Doesn’t matter. Lesson is over Harry.”
“It’s like you never read any of my books, Harry,” Draco replied.
Harry understood that it would be hard to be with Draco, if Draco even felt remotely the same way, because everyone around them would try to sabotage it. Including Harry’s friends.
“Nothing,” Draco replied.
“You’re hardly a boy, Harry,” Antoine said.
“Potter,” Draco said two days later. It was late at night, or maybe early morning, and it was raining. Potter was wet because...Potter was Potter and didn’t think to use a spell to keep the rain away.
Thinking back to his battles with Voldemort, Harry was very aware that he had had a lot of luck, and that was why he was drinking Felix Felicis and handing one to Antoine too.
“If McGonagall is still there she’ll take you on with no problems,” Draco said.
Antoine sighed. “It's done. There is nothing you or I can do about it now. The only thing we can do is rescue young Mister Malfoy and make sure that this doesn't ever happen again. And if they hadn't brought you to Draco to be healed -”
“Maybe partly,” Draco said. “It wasn’t like we could have stayed, without money or a home.”
“Yes, I know who you are Harry James Potter,” Antoine said. “And I know you've been looking for me.” He smiled, a wry smile. “Well, maybe not me specifically, but someone like me.”
Harry had a million questions the next morning, he was already up making breakfast and coffee and had showered when Antoine and Draco entered the kitchen.
“I really want to—" He stopped, took a breath. He wanted a lot of things; to touch Draco, for one.
“Draco-“
Harry blinked, breathed and then shut the book and put it aside. Luna had said the author was all the rage right now, Hermione had scoffed a bit, but he knew her well enough to know that she was probably in awe of the balls this author had and secretly liked the story too. Or stories, because this was the third book by H.J. Belladonna. Harry suspected that a name like that had to be a penname. On the other hand, in the world of witches and wizards you could hardly ever tell.
“Yes, but I have you and you have an excellent track record when it comes to saving my life,” Draco said.
“But you are going to help me find and free Draco Malfoy and whoever else is a Ministry captive
Draco sighed. “Yes, Harry, I know this is a date.”
They had pictures upon pictures upon pictures of the painting, but despite this, Harry felt like he needed to see it again. To be close to it, or maybe to touch it, with Draco’s permission. So he had called Luna and asked if he could come back over. To his surprise, Draco had allowed it.
“Didn’t take you for the shy type, Draco,” Harry said, just to see if he could goad him into losing his clothes. They had always been good at riling each other up.
Astra bit her lip. “Just a thought and don’t shoot me down yet, okay? What if Malfoy did the people on his list in? What if he’s the one who is taking care of the rest of them as well?”
“I’m sorry, it took so long,” Harry said, pressing his hand to the door. There was so much more he wanted to say but they didn’t have much time.
“Yes, truthfully, Harry.”
“I don't have enemies, Potter, I have business rivals. And I don't think one of them wants to kill me in a gruesome fashion,” he answered.
Neville nodded. “Is this going to be sixth year all over again?”
Of course, Harry’s little bubble was burst when Astra came by two days later to tell Harry the news about Goyle.
“Yes, I know,” Harry answered, waving it away: he was discovering new and interesting things about himself and his desires every day it seemed.
“I think we should start with the basics and make it fun.“
Harry shrugged. “I don’t know. I think maybe get to know this current him. It’s been ten years. We have all changed.”
“I can hear how scandalized you are about it, Potter,” Draco said, grabbed his drink and finished it.
“Everything you need to know, Harry Potter,” Draco said.
Malfoy nodded. “Yes, I did a lot of things back in the day because they somehow concerned you as well.”
He hadn’t seen Draco Malfoy in over ten years; in fact, hardly anyone had seen him after the war ended. This Malfoy was foreign like the old Malfoy hadn't been. Thirty-two years old and working with the Ministry of Magic. In fucking secret. Harry knew Malfoy didn’t get any recognition for the solved cases, and it didn’t seem he wanted any. Harry had looked into Draco Malfoy and his visions over the last few days—how could he not have?—and discovered in the process that Draco Malfoy was making a name for himself in the Muggle art world. He made quite a good living off of it, in fact.
“I don’t think I can watch,” Harry said, his voice wasn’t more than a whisper.
He closed his eyes so that he wouldn't have to look at what he had just created. He had no real recollection of painting it, only vague flashes of scents and colours. That was the one clue that it was probably a fucking – prophecy? Vision? Bane of his usually-peaceful existence. It was roughly one and a half meters wide and three meters high. The upper edge was still white in places—maybe he hadn’t been able to reach that far in his dreamlike state?
“The easiest solution would be to tell Potter everything and then let the hero handle it,” Pansy said.
Harry smiled briefly before he got serious again. “Okay, that is unexpected. Why did you keep it a secret?”
Luna nodded. “I'm not worried.”
“Well, damn,” Draco said.
There were things he was willing to do for his own gain, and there were things he was willing to do for the people he cared about and loved and then there were things he was willing to do for Harry Potter and he suspected that Harry had a list of these unspeakable things he would do for him as well.
“I don’t think I can watch you touch yourself and not try to feel your skin against mine, Draco,” Harry replied honestly, because even now he could feel the pull to be closer.
“Yes, they involve you and me being naked a lot. And in close proximity to each other,” Harry replied. “In fact I have elaborate fantasies about us being naked together.”
“No, no one but still.”
“I’m fine,“ Draco said and smiled at Blaise. It was the only apology Blaise would get, but Blaise didn’t need one anyway, that was not how they worked these days.
Harry nodded. “Step back from the door,” he said to Draco and waited a moment to give Draco time to do just that.
“I’m always careful.”
Harry didn’t reply to that. Ivan was right and they both knew it.
“Because you’re gorgeous and hot and your cock is hard,” Harry said, and Draco laughed.
He grabbed the quill, he just had to summon the old Draco Malfoy and tell his publisher in clipped certain terms that their professional relationship was over, because he got a better offer.
Harry rolled his eyes at him. “We don’t know the spell, Draco. It seems to be some kind of new Dark Magic.”
Antoine thought about it for a moment and then nodded. “I will talk to her alone, she won't want to meat with you.”
“When did you ever know me to be humble, Potter?”
The amusement was back in Blaise’s eyes. “I heard something else about your stalking Potter, I guess you do have some experience with that.”
“I can’t remember any of that. I don’t feel anything when you tell me stories about our adventures. I’m sorry, but that is the truth.”
“That assumption would be correct,” Antoine said, “It's easy to lose control.”
“The safe word is like a bubble in your mind. Out of reach, but there and when you decide that it’s too much, your mind will reach for that bubble and you will speak the word and it all ends. As I told you this is a spell designed for play and pleasure, it is not meant to harm. Most people start with a period of ten minutes to try it out and get a feel for it.”
“You’re insane,” Draco said.
“An arrangement?” Potter asked, but there was a soft blush rushing up his skin. It was fascinating. Draco wondered what was going on in Potter’s head right now.
She reached out then, and he stepped back. “Not a good idea, I think.”
“Yes, but some of us were heroes, while others… were not,” Draco looked past Potter and out of the window. “You were going somewhere with this whole thing?”
“It’s a poisonous nightshade, but yes, I guess you can call it a flower,” she teased. “You realize that H.J. could be your initials, Harry?“ Luna asked with an amused glint in her eyes.
Draco smirked. “I fear this has nothing to do with the case anymore.”
“Right,” Harry said and lifted the Imperius curse.
Bloody Potter, Draco thought as he was walking the mostly empty halls of the manor. Most of the furniture was gone, so where the books, the paintings, the ancient, priceless artifacts.
“Yes,” Blaise replied.
Harry sighed. “Thanks for the list. Keep me updated about the other cases as well.”
Ivan nodded. “Must have been hard for him since then.”
Harry frowned. It was adorable, Draco thought. He wasn’t even disgusted by himself anymore when he thought these things. He had always heard that the wizards and witches placed in Slytherin could be very loyal and love deeply. Draco just never really thought that he would love someone as deeply as he loved Harry Potter.
Draco took a sip of his tea. His brain was still half in the story he was in the process of writing, the characters feeling like demons wanting him to go back to it and finish their story, but he really needed food and sleep. Probably not in that order, but he knew that sleep wasn’t going to happen if he tried to do it now.
“Gentlemen,” Draco said, indicating the door.
“I didn’t say that, I just said that the author could be a man, is all,“ Luna replied.
“Check everyone else who had clearance as well, including me,” Harry said.
“Complicated is why I feel like you might want to end this once you can choose again who you want to fuck, Draco,” Potter said.
“Draco,” Harry said and this time it was a warning. He was close, Draco could feel it. He didn’t let up, he doubled his efforts, scrapped his teeth gently along the base and Harry cursed and lost it. Draco swallowed everything Harry had to give and then leaned his head against Harry’s thigh, to catch his breath.
“I like Harry too,” Draco said.
“He doesn’t fancy me,” Blaise said.
“He will understand,” Antoine replied.
“Over my dead body, Harry,” Draco replied. His books might be pornography with plot and feelings, but it was tasteful pornography and he wanted that reflected on the book covers, especially as his birth-name was on them too.
“I have something to tell you,” Draco said.
“Yes, of course, but this is a very delicate matter and—"
“The fucking Prophet, Potter!” Draco said and threw the paper on the table. Potter looked rumbled and messed up and it gave Draco a deep kind of satisfaction to know that he messed Potter up last night. They had been fucking like bunnies for the last four days. Draco had secretly hoped or feared, he wasn’t too clear on that one, that it would get boring, but it really wasn’t. Kissing Potter ignited something inside him, every single time.
Harry soldiered on, it wasn’t easy, because looking at Draco’s lips, made him crave Draco’s lips on him.
“Auror Potter,” Potter said. “You do respect me then?”
“Did you catch this case because you grew up amongst Muggles?” Draco asked. He knew that technically he wasn’t part of the investigation, and he had no right to ask these questions, but he—like Potter—liked to misbehave. He also liked to rule what little power he had over people that thought he was beneath them.
“Stop calling me that!” Draco exploded and then he turned around and fucking left.
Harry stopped, they were just outside the village, and took Draco’s hand. He looked at it and Draco did too and then Harry took a deep breath and Draco looked at his face. There really was something about his eyes: they were just so green.
“You think you can still paint the future?”
Harry shuddered, Draco had fought it for him, then he nodded. “So, back to the task at hand.”
“I think it’s a great idea, Draco. We surely need braver publishers around here,” Harry said.
“For whatever put that look of longing on your face just now, Harry,” Neville replied.
“Let’s do something fun?” Harry asked.
“Some of the people working on this case tested positive for a spell,” Harry told Draco a day later.
Or he’s trying to keep people out, Harry thought.
“I know they used to trace your magical signature,” Potter said as he poured himself a cup of tea.
“Okay."
“Are they down?” Harry asked. “Because I can’t fucking feel them anymore, Draco.”
“Walked right into that one, didn’t I?” Ron asked, but he was grinning.
“Did you check on Krabat and his mother?” Draco asked.
“I know it’s not your fault, Draco,” Harry said, because he was sure of that. He could feel it in his bones.
She looked at him long and hard and then nodded. “Tea?” Draco asked.
“When I got back home."
Draco smiled. “Well, I was raised as one, wasn’t I?”
“And if I don’t ask any questions?”
“Yes,” Antoine replied.
“That was…” Harry trailed off and then licked his lips. The green of his eyes was nearly swallowed by the black of his arousal. Draco wanted to dive right back in, but he refrained.
He leaned in and brushed his lips over Harry’s gently, he pulled back and then did it again and again and again, until Harry groaned. Draco smirked and licked Harry’s bottom lip gently, he was totally absorbed in the feel of Harry’s lips under his tongue and then Harry squeezed his hand and opened up to him and Draco didn’t lose any time to dive in deep, to explore Harry’s mouth with his tongue and his lips. Harry pulled him closer, his hands found their way to Draco’s waist. Draco could tell that Harry wasn’t a very experienced kisser, but he was learning fast, picking up on things Draco did and liked. Things were getting heated, so Draco slowed the kiss down and then stepped away, Harry followed him and then blinked.
Antoine looked at Draco and Draco looked up, his mouth full of Harry’s dick, but his eyes were smiling.
“You did great last night,” Harry assured and Draco looked at him. “You look smug,” Harry observed.
“Good, now we can concentrate on finding Julien,” Harry said.
“You really love him,” Luna said, softly.
“You still sound scandalized, Potter. People have sex.”
“You never made that connection before?”
Draco arched a perfect eyebrow. “Really? How would you know? I hardly shared my hobbies with you, aside from Quidditch."
“Well, you don’t want to give in into his demands, good on you by the way, and you don’t want to kill him, also good on you. This seems like the only good option.” Blaise took a sip of his tea and then reached for a Petit Fours.
For a second Harry wondered if his smile looked as feral as Antoine's and then he let it go.
“You look like something my cat dragged in,“ Blaise said from the sofa. Draco’s sofa, in Draco’s tiny flat.
“Who should I have told? I was alive and everyone else was in pieces on the forest floor. I’m a former Death Eater, and it was shortly after the war.”
“And where would you escape to when one of your pretty hook-ups won’t want to leave again?”
“Harry,” Harry interrupted, he wanted Draco to call him by his first name.
They had roughly ten minutes before the Aurors would knock on their door (they had bricked up their fireplaces when they moved in, so no one was able to use the Floo). Draco used those ten minutes to dress in presentable clothes and scrub the splattered paint from his skin, then made his way downstairs.
“I don’t care. When has anything ever been easy for me? Hell, Draco isn’t easy,” Harry replied. But he loved Draco. Hell, he really did love Draco and he was going to fight for them.
He shrugged. He didn’t know why he assumed that, because honestly it wasn’t like the writing was very feminine or masculine for that matter. The characters felt a certain way, yes, but the writing didn’t.
In fact, they were all in the library now, having tea, while Auror Bain was filling them in.
“I told you. I am not surprised it took the marking and disfiguring of a child to make the public demand something to be done, not that anyone cared when Voldemort put his Mark on me,” Draco said bitter.
“It was in the way you so lovingly described my cock, Draco,“ Blaise said.
“I keep my ears open for any hint, but even if I would have found him, I couldn’t have rescue him. We, vampires, can't use magic like you do, Mister Potter. The chances of rescue and escape were very, very slim. I needed someone to help me. I needed a willing wizard.”
“You should give up now,” Draco said, calmly.
“Well, they’re both a bit gaga.”
Blaise grinned. “Oh, Draco, I always knew that about you.”
He was so not looking forward to it, but it had to be done sooner rather than later. Not today, not now, because now he had hardly any brain function left besides basic needs.
Harry nodded and looked around. Everyone meant in this case, Hermione, Ron, Neville and Luna. These were the only people he had been close to the last few months, if you didn’t count Draco and Blaise. And he didn’t need to talk to Draco or Blaise about this.
Draco grinned. “Good to know,” he said.
“Is he at all interested in men?” Harry made himself ask. He wasn’t looking at Blaise, in fact he was looking at the delicate teacup in his hands.
“Money. Someone paid me a lot of money to do it,” Draco answered.
“Ron has a broken hand,” was the first thing Harry said when he entered the classroom.
“You are in too deep,” Astra said. “I should contact the higher ups and have you removed from this case, but we both know that won’t happen,” she added. “You are their golden boy.”
“What does it mean, that I’m in your Vision now?”
“What now?” Draco asked.
Antoine inclined his head and he looked so pretty and young in that moment that it nearly hurt to look at him, Harry thought. Were all vampires so alluring?
“He has to share it, right? That’s what his ancestors want?” Harry asked. An idea was forming in his head, an insane idea that could lose him his job, or even his life.
Ivan raised his eyebrows in a silent question.
“Good thing we cleared that up,” Draco said. He flicked his fingers and the barrier he usually used with Potter came to live, but it was a box now, and inside was Joel.
“Here, I made you a list of people who might hold a grudge against Malfoy,” Astra said.
“Yes,” Antoine said.
“Of course it is,” Blaise said and looked at Harry sharply.
“Oh, joy,” Draco said, but followed her into the kitchen.
“So, Malfoy, your boyfriend Malfoy,” Ron said, and to his credit didn’t even stumble anymore over the words, “is also a famous, soon to be infamous erotica writer?”
“I disliked you apparently for a reason too,” Harry said. “I can’t remember our first meeting, but I figure you acted kind of spoiled?”
“I think it means something. It might be his current case,” Luna continued.
“I know, but it’s not ‘Draco’s case’ Harry. It was never his case. He’s just a medium; he doesn’t solve crimes, he gives clues.”
“Do you age? The book wasn’t really clear on it,” Harry said.
“Lock the door,” Draco said.
Harry put a hand on his knee. Weasley stared at it and for a moment it seemed like he would comment on it, but then he didn’t.
“We all know that someone out there is trying to kill me. And what about Krabat and his mother?”
“He thought I was evil, I thought he was such a saint,” Draco replied. He knew very well that all his anger and resentment towards Potter had been because he had chosen Weasley over Draco. It seemed like such a childish thing now, but he had been a child back then. He had been raised to expect the best and to think very highly of himself. He had been raised to believe the world owed him, was his oyster. It was a harsh awakening and he responded with anger, because he had never learned how to respond to rejection any other way.
“Arousing? “ Luna cut in.
Draco rolled his eyes at him. “No. I could shackle you to my bed and never have you leave, Harry-“
Harry smiled. “Not what I had in mind, but now that you put that idea in my head, one of these days we should make out in a corridor.”
“Well, yes I am the root of all evil after all,” Draco replied.
Harry shook his head. “No, and that was the point, I imagine. From what I learned since I lost my memories, my life had been…hell. So much loss, so much betrayal. Maybe it had been too much at some point.”
Even if Harry would have been needed somewhere, there was no way in hell he would pass up mellow morning sex with Draco.
“You’re going to watch me die?”
“I’m rethinking a lot of the things I took for granted when I was a child, Draco. Haven't you?”
Blaise unfolded himself and stretched. He looked so graceful it was ridiculous. Blaise caught him looking and winked at him. “I’m glad I don’t have to duel the boy who lived for your honor Draco. I like Harry.”
“You’re not a bad person, Draco.”
It was from Harry, of course it was.
“I don’t get it, and also I’m weirdly flattered that I am your safe word, Draco. But if you can’t control your actions, how can you say the safe word?”
Draco wasn’t looking forward to the next part, once he had Joel helpless and at death’s door. He needed the heart. He could rip it out with a thought, but he would still have to hold it, to eat it.
She nodded. “I know.“
Antoine sighed. He looked young and a bit lost for a second before he straightened his spine. “This...this will have to wait, until we have Draco back.”
“Coming from you that means a lot,” Draco replied.
Was that the reason? Maybe? Maybe he was reimagining their history and had spiced it up with a lot of sex.
“And your power?”
“I bet you could spot one of mine in a London gallery now, after having seen this,” Draco said, stepping up beside him, though not close enough to touch. He smelled of paint and earth. The paint Harry could understand; the smell of wet, freshly-turned soil was a mystery.
Draco looked at him. “Why are you so into helping Potter all of a sudden?“
“Of course,” Pansy said. “Will you tell Potter about this?”
Draco pinched his nipples again and Harry moaned. “Potter,” Draco said, leaning down, so he could whisper the words against Harry’s ear. “You should, because I’m going to ruin you for everyone else.”
“Why the sudden interest in the whereabouts of one Draco Malfoy then?”
“I’m sorry. I didn’t think,” he replied.
Blaise closed his book. The common room was deserted, but that wasn’t unusual at this time of the night.
“You think Joel killed them all once he realised something went wrong?” Draco asked, aghast.
It seemed to Harry like they had it all under control and it was a pleasure to see Draco scheme.
“Sounds complicated,” Harry said.
“Luna, yes, I was wondering if Draco is up for visitors again?”
Harry nodded. “Well, except that one brownish blob near my scar,” Harry replied.
“You have seen him kill Cedric,” Draco said, “I knew he would kill me, or my mother, or anyone else I cared about if I didn’t do what he wanted me to do. The price for their lives and safety was the lives and safety of other people. I am aware that you wouldn’t have made that trade, Harry, but I did. I don’t regret it.” He took a sip of his wine. “I’m not proud of it, but I think my mother, Pansy, Zabini, they all live because I let the Death Eaters into Hogwarts.”
“And then he comes back at the age of twenty-two and starts to work with the Ministry half a year after.”
“You should keep it, make it your own. You are not your father. Just be the first Malfoy in your line then.”
“Who did we talk to then, at the Manor?” Draco mused.
“The Ministry did,” Harry said and regretted it a second later.
Draco waved it away. “Sure, she is. But it’s Lovegood. I don’t think for a moment that the rest of the public will be won over that easily.”
“Yes, I want to steal you away,” Harry admitted.
“Why did you come here today?”
“You wanted to make it on your own,” Blaise said gently.
“I buried him in the rose garden,” was the first thing Draco said when Harry opened the door.
“Relax Potter,” Draco said gently and then touched his finger to Harry’s rim. He didn’t push in, just kept it there and watched Harry breathe.
“You’re not screaming,” Harry said, once Draco broke away.
Which was of course true. Grab and Goyle had tortured other students and Draco had let the Death Eaters into Hogwarts.
It wasn’t romantic in a typical sense, but Harry had to admit that it fit them. He stood and walked over to where Draco was sitting on the leather sofa. Harry had to admit that he loved Draco against the soft leather of the sofa or the armchair. He caged Draco in, and Draco looked up, his grey eyes were so expressive, and then Harry leaned down and kissed him gently on the lips. He didn’t want to start anything, he just wanted to let Draco know how much this meant to him, how much Draco meant to him.
“I go out to feed.”
“We lost people too,“ Draco replied.
They were out of the facility in no time.
Harry swallowed. Fuck, but he did love Draco’s dominant side. It did all kinds of things for him to see Draco in charge.
“Yes, your stomach is probably trying to eat itself,” Potter replied. He terminated the warming charm on their food, and they started eating.
Because Blaise Zabini was apparently bi-sexual, and he had been in Slytherin and Harry remembered seeing him with Draco Malfoy.
“We are all here,” Hermione said. “You wanted to talk with us?”
“No, I don’t have to be anywhere,” Harry replied.
“I remember, bits and pieces, or think I remember.”
He laughed.
Antoine smiled.
“We’ve been making out and getting each other off for a while now,” Harry said.
Harry frowned. “You look awful.”
“Will do. You two be careful. We think it was only Lerch and Julien, but we can’t be sure. Maybe someone else is in on it as well. You are still in danger, Mr. Malfoy.”
“You weren’t close to me, Draco,” Harry replied.
“Before Goyle, I would have entertained it,” Harry said, and before living and sleeping with Malfoy. “But Goyle was his friend.”
“What are you doing here?” a sharp voice asked and although it had been years since Harry had heard that voice he recognized it immediately. A small ball of light illuminated the space between them a moment latter. “Potter.” Draco said.
Harry swallowed hard and Draco’s eyes snapped to his face. “Scared Potter?”
“I'm looking for one of you. For Draco Malfoy.”
She smiled and shook her head and then the fire died. The connection was broken.
“Really? Maybe because I feel smug,” Draco said. He rolled on his back and looked up at the ceiling.
“Yes?”
“Potter,” Draco said and had no idea how to finish.
Harry nodded. “And you?” He asked Antoine.
Harry blinked at him. He took off his glasses, rubbed the bridge of his nose and then looked at him again. “Please explain in more detail.”
If he was here already, he could stay, Draco supposed. “After you then.”
“Why are we dragging Harry into this again?” Draco asked, getting irritated at his friends.
“I think they’re dead. I can hardly remember what happened after, you see. I was in so much pain I blacked out, and when I came to, I was alone in the forest and there was red and green and black everywhere.”
It wasn't question, but Harry answered anyway. “Yes. In a secret Ministry facility.” He thought for a second and then decided to hell with everything else. He needed to find Draco. He made a promise, but that wasn't the reason at all. “Is he the only one?”
It was stupid how this kiss made his stomach flip. It wasn’t the first time Harry had kissed him after all.
“Cynical, Harry.”
“Yes, but – I think trying to do the right thing and being just that is part of who I am, but does that make me a good person?”
“What are you thinking about Draco?” Harry asked in a whisper. He could feel Harry’s warm breath on his skin. Did Harry know what that did to him? After all the carnal encounters they have shared he probably knew. He had always known how to rile Draco up after all.
“I know that,” Draco said. He looked at the wine in his glass and then looked up sharply and directly into Harry’s eyes. Harry had been studying his features – had been absorbed in the task if he was honest and he felt caught now by Draco’s eyes on him. “Do you think you might be on the killer’s list as well, Potter?”
“Maybe you shouldn’t have declined that post, Granger,” Draco said.
“Well, after the things he’s done I assumed everyone who knew him would have left him.“
“You take the fun out of it already and we haven’t even started,” Blaise sighed. “I really don’t know why you didn’t come to me with your first book, Draco.”
Henri took another biscuit and frowned. “If he stopped, it can only mean one of two things: he killed again and we haven’t found the victim yet, or he’s stalking his prey.”
Harry stepped closer until he could touch Draco. He put his hands on Draco’s hips carefully and slowly.
“Oh, I get that, but just this morning you were ready to take my head off because I told you to relax,” Potter said.
“Probably because of Potter,“ Draco said. In the years since the trials he had come to terms with the fact that it had been Potter who had saved him from a lengthy stay in Azkaban. He didn’t dwell on it too much these days. He was trying to leave his past behind. He was giving it all away in tiny bits in his writing. He didn’t want it back either.
“I told you, I would,” Harry replied.
“I went snooping around that private club. They weren’t very happy about it, so I had to stake the place out. And after two days I see Lerch knocking on their door one night.”
“Right, we will fold birds and then we will make them fly,” Draco said. And that sparked a memory maybe, but it was gone as soon as it came.
There was no telling in what state Draco would be either.
Antoine nodded. “Even if you wouldn't have been in love with him, you would have wanted to help him, wouldn’t you, Mister Potter?”
“Should we send him a reply?” He asked the bird and reached out to touch her soft feathers. She let him and he smiled again.
The more time he spent with Antoine, the more he liked the boyish looking vampire. He didn’t want to feel any kind of attraction. Harry was very aware he didn’t have the best track record when it came to romantic interests. So far he had lost every single person he had been in love with, one way or another. All around him people seemed to make it work, so why-
“Auror Bain,” Draco said with a slight nod.
Draco suppressed the urge to blink at him. This line of conversation was very dangerous to his heart. “I know why you’re here, Potter and I’m going to tell you now that I—"
“Yes, of course, it had been the house of my ancestors. I was raised to be proud of that,” Draco answered.
“Most of us have,” Blaise replied.
“Luna would,” Harry replied. “This might damage your career.”
Draco didn’t wait. He disappeared into the dark shadows the manor cast. Harry wasn’t stupid enough to try and get inside. By now Draco had most likely strengthened the blood magic inside and around the manor.
“You are one of the people I know,” Blaise replied.
~One~
“For what?” Neville asked.
Draco blinked up at him. “Why are you awake?” He asked groggily and then buried his face in the pillow. Draco was not really a morning person. Harry thought that was probably partly because he worked at night. Now that he knew that Draco was a writer, a lot of his odd little habits made more sense.
He sincerely hoped that there would be a book seven, because Draco had no illusions about this. The backlash would be immense.
“Why? Because I didn’t get to rip anyone’s throat out? I knew you wouldn’t let me do that, Potter,”
Draco smiled. “No one has been with a man like this before, Potter. Our circumstances are very unique. And you’re avoiding answering my question.” He flicked his eyes to Harry and suddenly Harry was naked.
“But the specialist said that,” Potter said, looking at Bears. “Your trusted curse specialist said that.” Bears shrugged. Clearly he didn’t have an answer either.
Astra was not happy about Harry suddenly doubting Julien and his work and she made it clear to him.
Harry liked that. He liked playful, dirty, cunning Draco.
“No,” Harry lied smoothly.
“I’m aware that people won’t like it, Draco and I don’t care. My friends will come around, or they aren’t really my friends. Blaise has your back, right?” Harry asked.
A few moments later, Pansy was standing in the middle of the studio. “Well, fuck,” she said as she looked her fill.
Harry’s brain was stuck on the word ‘medi-witch‘.
Harry blinked at him. “Yes, I am listening. Julien has been with the Aurors for five years now and he had always done an excellent job, Draco. Why do you ask?”
“But you were alive?”
“You know him,” Bain stated.
“Would that work?” Draco asked Mrs. Bellke.
“Already ideas are clawing at me, but no. I need some downtime and honestly waiting for the release and signing and interview to come out stresses me out a bit.”
“I’m taking a guess here and say you’ve done this before?”
“I’m obsessed with you now. I was thinking about you in that place, after you left.”
“I might,” Antoine said. “Walk with me Mister Potter?”
“That is why I advised Pansy and Blaise to get out of the country,” Draco said.
“Good,” Draco said and then pushed two fingers inside Harry, Harry moaned loudly. Draco was relentless, he played and pushed and was up to three fingers and hitting Harry’s prostate nearly every time.
“I know you and Ron cornered Draco a few days ago, and I want you to stop harassing him.”
Draco kissed him and then kissed down his body until he reached Harry’s cock, he kissed the tip and then pushed Harry’s legs further apart and put a pillow under his ass. Harry felt totally exposed, but it only heightened his arousal and when Draco kissed the rim around his hole, he nearly jumped out of his skin. “What?”
“Some people like submission and dominance play,” Draco said and looked at Harry. Harry nodded, because he might have lived in a cupboard once, but he was wiser now. “And there is a spell that some people like to use, it works like the Imperious to a degree,” Draco continued.
“Don’t,” Draco warned and Harry jerked back; he had been about to do just that. It was messed up how much he wanted it. He had always been better at controlling these kinds of desires.
Harry reached up and grabbed his hips, pulled him even closer, deeper inside himself. His cock got some friction like this as well and then Draco reached between them and started to jerk him. It didn’t take long for Harry to come messily all over Draco’s fingers. His body clenched hard and Draco cursed as he came. Harry could feel his cock spasm. Draco smeared kisses into Harry’s collarbone and then pulled out gently and carefully. It felt weird, but the afterglow was overriding everything else.
“There is a private Club I like to frequent. They have someone and something for anyone. Sexual tastes and appetites vary after all. They also evolve as you get older and try new things.”
“Okay, you couldn’t go to the authorities and so you kept silent. Did anyone ever come knocking on your door asking for someone?”
“You look like a prince,” Harry said before he could check himself.
“What you wanted so long ago: be Harry Potter’s friend,“ Blaise said.
Blaise poured himself a cup of tea. “Have you talked to Harry about it?”
“It came with the house,” Draco replied. Which wasn’t even a lie. He had modified it a bit of course.
“I never wondered about that,” Harry said.
Draco snorted and then smiled at Harry. “I love that I’m your first. Not going to lie. It turns me on.”
“They set in later, and as soon as I realised what they were I went to the authorities. Not that they took me seriously.”
“We should eat before the warming charm wears off,” he said. He would talk with Potter about company after dinner.
“But you’re wearing a glamour, right around here,” he said and put his hand on Draco’s chest. He ran it over the scar that he couldn’t see, or remember, but he had placed there.
“The answer is no.”
Draco gave Harry a look. Harry just shrugged. What could he say? She was an expert on curses, and she came highly recommended. It didn’t matter that she was also one of Ivan’s more elusive relatives. Not that he had told Draco that tidbit of information.
“There are a lot of nasty things at the Manor, Potter."
“Jesus,” Harry said.
“I don’t want you to deal with my problems, Harry. I don’t need a hero. I am perfectly able to handle my own problems.”
“Yes. We have eight victims so far. Ivan thinks the heart you painted in both Visions is somewhat important, but I’m more concerned about my face on those canvases,” Potter said.
“Or you could come and live with me,” Blaise offered, not the first time either.
Maybe because Draco had been present at the battle of Hogwarts this seemed rather anticlimactic. Maybe because he had lived in fear of Voldemort for years, trying to stay calm in the presence of so much evil and madness that having a wand pressed to his throat wasn’t anything that concerned him too much.
“There is nothing wrong with liking boys or girls or both, but Harry,” and here Neville turned so he could look at Harry. “No one will really understand if it’s who I think it is.”
“That can be arranged,” Draco replied, leaning in to kiss him.
“What do you want?” Draco asked, materializing in front of him on the other side of the gate.
“Please suck me,” he said and Draco smiled. Harry knew they’ve done this before, but this was better, of course, because he would remember every second of this for the rest of his life. Draco’s lips made contact with Harry’s dick: it was a kiss. No one had ever kissed his dick like this and it made his heart beat faster in his chest.
“It had to have hurt a lot,” Antoine mused. “It had to be agony for Mister Malfoy too.”
“Harry,” Antoine hissed.
“It’s like – muggle phone-sex, I guess? Or this new thing, cam-sex?” Draco said. He wasn’t totally clueless these days, but he preferred to conclude his business and pleasure with wizarding businesses.
“I woke up and was alone, or thought I was alone until I heard a voice. I think maybe someone else was there. Maybe someone found me, maybe someone survived the ritual.”
“Fuck other people’s opinion, Draco. They don’t know you like I know you. They don’t know you like Potter knows you.”
“I have a few ideas,” Harry said.
“Hm,” Draco hummed, he was already getting distracted as Harry kneeled down in front of him. Draco’s eyes settled on him and Harry’s heart missed a beat. There was so much hunger in them. Draco reached out and carded his fingers through Harry’s hair. “I remember this one.”
He wanted to end this with as little bloodshed as possible. They were Harry’s friends after all.
“What about Muggles?”
“What do you want to know?”
Draco growled and then kissed him hard. “You just love to rile me up, don’t you?”
“The thought of killing him crossed my mind once or twice,” Draco joked.
“He must trust you then,” Astra said.
“Can I have a better photo of that one? Maybe from different angles?” Draco asked. He might send it to Mrs. Zabini too, Blaise’s mother knew all kinds of things and all kinds of people.
Draco leaned back in the armchair he was occupying and looked at Potter. “I know that no one really wanted me to succeed, Potter. After all the horrible things I’ve done.”
He woke up to insistent tapping on his bedroom window and groaned. He was really tempted to throw a pillow at the bird, but it wasn’t the owl’s fault that he was still very tired. He turned his head and used that bit of nonverbal magic he had learned abroad to open the window. It wasn’t very impressive nonverbal magic, but it was very handy at times like this.
“It’s still wet,” Draco said. It was a whisper across his neck, and Potter shivered. They were so close he could feel Potter’s body heat; he could smell him. For the first time in over ten years, he wanted to feel skin against his own. He could hear Potter’s breathing, could feel it too, through the shirt, his fingers curled in the material and he breathed Potter in. He felt like a beast scenting his prey. Was Potter feeling it, too? Was he afraid? Or excited like he had claimed to be earlier, when he was around dangerous things?
Harry grinned at him as he pulled away. “Missed me?”
“Bloody hell,” Draco whispered, running a hand over his eyes. His fingers were green from the dust. Everything was green: from pale shades like budding flowers to nearly black like the Forbidden Forest, to luminescent-like poison; Potter’s eyes were staring back at him. He felt naked with all those eyes on him, hidden between trees or bushes or flowers. In some, the trees and bushes were inside Potter’s eyes. It was beautiful and creepy. Draco shuddered and gathered the paper, putting all the drawings in a box, which he shoved under the daybed he slept on more often than in his own bedroom downstairs.
Draco reached into his nightstand drawer and came up with lube. Harry nearly sighed in relief; things were finally progressing to where he wanted them to.
“Draco,” Antoine said gently. “You need to feed. We all need to feed.” He added with a look at the woman.
Thompson nodded.
Draco looked at him. Was Blaise fucking joking? Draco had a bedroom, a living room, kitchen and bathroom. And all of these rooms were tiny. He worked in his bedroom, for a lot of reasons. “You have enough space,“ Draco replied, because Blaise was by no means poor. Blaise’s mother had been very well off and Blaise was a spoiled rich kid and good looking too. The world was his oyster. In fact Draco had based the main character of his last novel on Blaise. Well, one of the main characters.
He was doomed, it was that easy.
“Everyone is singing your praises,” Draco said. He was sitting on one of the desks and looking up at the ceiling like he would find something interesting there. Harry liked to watch his throat, liked imagining running his fingers over it, liked to think about how that delicate looking pale skin would taste and feel under his tongue.
Blaise waved it away. “Point is, I should have been the one to get your artistic vision out there, H.J. Belladonna.”
Fuck, Harry thought, the possessive note in Draco’s voice heightened his arousal a hundred percent. Harry wanted to tell him that he was always Draco’s but bit his lip instead as he pinched his nipple.
“I've always wanted to protect you. Mostly from yourself, Draco," Harry admitted.
“I usually go to a club or a bar to pick up some company,” Draco said. He could already tell that this conversation wasn’t going well.
Draco looked up sharply. “On first name basis, are we now?”
“Fuck.”
“No one knows yet, except the Aurors who had been guarding him, the higher ups and us,” Astra said.
“Just wondering if you are one of those people who don’t like penetrative sex,” Harry confessed.
It startled Harry. When was the last time- “Is that when you decided to help me?”
Once Potter was gone with his coffee and his plate piled high with breakfast foods, Draco sat down at the kitchen table and drank his tea slowly in small sips. His mind was running a mile a minute. The most pressing question was why now? Was it the impending ten-year anniversary of the Hogwarts battle? Were the Auros even looking into the ‘why now’? Or were they focusing on the who?
Draco made a noise that didn’t mean anything, but hopefully conveyed strongly how much he cared for reality. Reality was shit right now. Only ten years after the war he was still a pariah. Granted he didn’t do much to change people’s mind about him, but he honestly didn’t think he should grovel at the feet of people who had never been in the presence of the Dark Lord himself and who had left the saving of the world to a seventeen year old kid.
“Maybe we should finish our coffees,” Draco said.
Blaise only went because Draco told him he was fucking Potter now and pretty sure Potter would not let him die. He kept the case of feelings he had developed to himself, but he was sure that both his friends knew anyway.
“You realise that I love you, right?” Draco asked.
“Ah,” was the only thing Potter said.
Draco would bet anything he had that it hadn’t been just curiosity, but Blaise’s motives didn’t matter anymore. Blaise was Draco’s friend and Draco was in love with Harry, so Blaise was also Harry’s friend. Draco nodded and Blaise swirled the wand between his fingers. “I ran some tests on it and Draco, he did it to himself. The spell that took away his memories came from this wand.”
“Did it work?” Harry asked.
“Stop over thinking things, Harry and get some sleep,” Antoine added, stepping away. “I will see you tomorrow.”
“I wanted to hurt you, that spell was created to hurt your enemies,” Potter said in nearly a whisper.
“Yes,” Draco repeated.
“Are you satisfied?”
Yes, Draco thought, he had recognized those traits too.
“Ah, don't lie now,” Antoine interrupted. “I am sure you don't recall a lot of what had happened with young Mister Malfoy, but you know what you feel for him. I don't think you would have gone to such lengths if you didn't love him.”
She huffed and rolled her eyes. “You buy me stuff because you want to, Draco,” she said, her voice soft on his name. She had always had a soft spot for him. Draco knew she had been in love with him at some point. Of course, when he realised he wasn't attracted to women romantically or sexually, that had put a damper on things.
Julien’s eyes were wide with fear. Draco smiled. He reached out and touched Julien’s nose gently. “I really think you deserve to die, but well…I don’t think Harry would approve.” He stood up, straightened his robes and without a second glance he went home where Harry was waiting.
“A child’s dream,” Draco shrugged. “You were always better than me.”
Potter shrugged. “Just a feeling, besides if you were writing pornography, tasteful pornography, but still, would you do it under your real name?”
“The painting, obviously, not what happened to Draco. Even if it made him stronger.”
She grinned at him. “Spoilsport, but I will wear you down, eventually. Maybe by book seven you will think differently about it.”
It wasn’t a vision. It was just as horrendous as the visions, but this one was—
“I could marry him,” Harry said, surprising himself. He had been married once. It hadn’t worked out, and he hadn’t had any intention to do it again, but here he was, proposing.
“And soon,” Harry replied.
“I want to publish my new book with Blaise’s new company as you well know. My old publisher didn’t take it well. In fact they somehow found out who Belladonna really is, yours truly and is now blackmailing me.”
Draco was not amused when he felt the wards stir. He knew it was Potter before he heard him enter, and was proven right when he heard him greet Luna.
“Yes,” Draco answered and pushed back to take Harry’s cock deeper inside himself. Harry groaned. “Move, Potter.”
“Someone just messed with the wards,” Draco said and then took a deep breath.
“I asked you a question, Potter. You do realize you’re trespassing right?”
“Harry didn’t fail anyone, every- fucking- one failed Harry,” Draco snapped. Because it had become clear over the last few weeks to Draco, that every adult ever in Harry’s life growing up had failed and used him.
“It’s the Gryffindor in me,” Potter replied.
“So rude, Potter. Didn’t anyone teach you to not interrupt? You have been sent to smooze up to important people, right? As a successful Auror, and all.”
Which was perfectly true, so Draco didn’t feel the need to reply.
“What happened to your face?” Harry asked.
“Is it because you’re too proud?”
“Are you flirting with me?”
Harry had to kiss him again, before he reapplied lube and pushed two fingers inside Draco. He loved having Draco’s fingers inside him too, especially when Draco was going down on him. The combined sensations always had him on the edge in a matter of minutes. Draco, Harry had learned, liked to draw it out. He liked to concentrate on his ass or cock only for a while and Harry loved watching him. All that pale skin, flushed with a pretty pink in all the right arousing places. He ran his fingertips over the scar he left Draco with all those years ago and Draco moaned. He had asked Draco about it pretty much the first time they got naked together, and Draco had told him that it wasn’t especially sensitive but once Harry got to touch it, he had moaned in that way he was doing now. For some reason it heightened Draco’s arousal.
“Are you keeping your clothes on?” Harry asked.
“I want your help.”
“I do think about it. I think, and it happens,” Draco replied.
Harry took a sip of wine. He didn’t have a real answer to that. When he had been asked before by his friends and the media, he had told them it had been the right thing to do, because they had been kids. But was that really the reason why he had helped Malfoy? Malfoy who had been closer to Voldemort than any of them – except Harry in a twisted way?
“Yes, I did,” Antoine answered. “You weren't going to let it go.”
“Would that really matter in the long run?” Antoine wanted to know. “You still feel love for young Mister Malfoy, don’t you?”
“There are a few ways to deal with someone like that. Of course I could just go over there and do my, I’m Harry Potter and I am very disappointed in you thing. Sometimes you can guilt-trip people into doing the right thing.”
Harry sighed. Put like that it was a rather half-baked plan. And very dangerous too. Harry was ready to risk his own life, but he wasn't ready to let Antoine fall into the hands of the same people who had Draco already. “We have to scout the places then.”
“No. The point of this spell is to not be in control. To give yourself over completely to someone else’s will. He told me to suck his cock, I fell on my knees and did it, without any real input from me. But I was aware of what I was doing all the time and I knew that if I said the word – which was Harry, by the way – it would end.”
Henri nodded, grabbing his mug of tea and heading up to the studio.
“You were seventeen,” Potter said.
Draco glared up at him from the hardwood floor. “No shit.”
“Really?” Draco asked, playfully, but there was that edge to his voice too, that Harry, really, really liked hearing.
“Something tells me you didn’t have a trial period like that,” Harry said.
“Lovers, Draco. I think we are good as lovers,” Potter said, and Draco smiled.
He wondered if Potter knew what he was doing.
“No, I don’t want that much power,” Harry said. “Not even by proxy.”
“I also love when you take charge,” Harry said.
“We don’t know what happened,” Potter said, shrugging.
Harry rubbed the bridge of his nose. “It will get better. And it wasn’t your fault, Draco. It was them.”
“It’s not pity, I care about you,“ Blaise said. “Pansy too.”
“I will remind you of that,” Harry said just before a lubed up finger was circling Draco’s rim.
“What kind of ritual was it?” Harry asked. During his career he had seen a lot of horrible things, including rituals and magic gone wrong.
“He will come for you, well knowing it’s a trap,” Bain continued.
“You’re doing it again, Draco.”
Ivar was whispering into his ears, but he tried to ignore him. There was something very enchanting about the color of it, a green like living things, it seemed to vibrate with energy. It wasn’t spelled in any kind of way, because it was Muggle, but there was something about it Draco couldn’t put his finger on.
“What I need is to know that these people will pay for what they did to me,” Draco hissed.
“What?” Potter asked startled.
For now he would just go with it. He was sure they would find a way to make this work.
“As if you wouldn’t have if one of your precious little brats had been marked like that. But of course your little Weasleys are safe.” He spit.
“Won’t you?”
“Like what?”
“You don’t believe that. You know what we did was right. No one died in the process either,” Harry said.
“I’d like a crack at him,” Harry said and Auror Bain smiled.
“And the last one, Vision No. 34,” Ivan said, looking at the close ups of the painting. He leaned his head back and stared at the ceiling. “It looks different than his other pieces. Draco Malfoy is a Seer, the real deal...”
“Merlin,” Pansy said.
“If you weren’t, well you,” Malfoy said, “I would put you on the top of the list.”
That was what Draco had been afraid of.
“We do it your way,” Harry answered.
Draco fought the impulse to put his hand over the scar Harry had left him with sixth year and won.
“Someone you're close to?”
“Why am I making such a big deal out of this?” he asked Hell.
“I think you should take off your clothes for me,” Draco said and sat up, Harry followed him because he wanted more of Draco’s kisses and more of Draco’s body heat.
There's no connection, Harry thought bitterly.
“I forgot earlier because we had our little moment in the hall, but Astra brought over Julien’s findings on that mark the killer left behind,” Harry said after dinner. He hadn’t only forgotten because of their moment he had also forgotten because he and Draco of course ended up in bed afterwards where Draco proceeded to ruin Harry for any other living person.
“Did you like not being in control?” Harry had to ask.
“I do. I want to keep doing it.” He rolled onto Harry to feel all of Harry’s skin against his. Maybe they should stay naked for the rest of their lives, Draco mused. “I like helping people too, but I don’t want to be tempted to use my powers like that in the field.”
“Did you do that?” Harry asked.
Draco really hoped he hadn’t made a mistake by admitting that he knew who Belladonna really was.
“You could teach,” Draco said from the door to the bedroom. He was naked and Harry just drank him in.
She sighed. “He says no, but he’s alright again. He just doesn’t want to see anybody.”
Draco sighed. “Yes, Harry, I know how to defend myself.”
“No one in their right mind at the Ministry would want to kill you, Harry.” She said. He could tell that she believed it too.
Blaise followed him. “I’ll take one too.“
Draco gave him a look. “Of course I fought, but I was drugged.” He shrugged like there was nothing more to add.
Draco put the papers aside and looked at Harry. “Word came back from Mrs. Zabini,” he said. There was something careful in Draco’s voice. It was strange how Harry could tell things about Draco and his moods now from only how he formulated words. Proximity would do that, he thought.
“You don't drink from a wizard - “ he stopped, thought about everything they have been talking about for the past half an hour, “except from the wizard you want to turn, the one that wants to be turned.”
Draco had known it would come to this, but he had hoped that McGonagall would see reason. He wasn’t the right person to take care of the hero of the wizarding world.
“Yes, when I was younger,” Draco replied, but didn’t elaborate on it. “Now you try, Harry.”
He got up and made some tea, he skipped the shower for now, grabbed a day-old poppy seed pastry and then went to bed.
“A pleasure spell?” Harry asked, because that didn’t make any sense at all.
Draco smirked, obviously pleased with himself.
“Last time you called it amazing, Harry.”
“How?” Pansy asked.
“Yes,” Antoine replied.
“By talking to him,” Harry answered. He was still kind of a little bit surprised that Draco had talked to him, but of course Draco was different from the kid he had been over ten years ago. Harry was different too.
“So you know all that I told you about your curse was a lie,” Joel said.
“We won’t,” Harry replied.
“He is right you should know how to defend yourself.”
“And you find this amusing?” Harry asked.
“Once you agree to this, I will set things in motion and I will make it work to your benefit, Draco,” Blaise added.
Draco rubbed at his eyes. He could feel a headache coming. He had been up all night again, because the new part wanted to be written. He loved that these stories and characters came so easily to him, but getting it all out of his head on paper still took a lot of time and a toll on his body and mind sometimes too.
“You’re full of surprises, aren’t you?” Harry asked.
“Maybe I was ready to take your head off because I haven’t had sex in a too long time,” Draco snapped. He took a big sip of his whisky and then put the glass on the nearby table.
“Will I now?” Draco asked.
Harry nodded. He watched as Draco whispered something to the bird and pointed his wand at it and then the bird took flight. It was a fascinating little piece of magic.
Plural, Harry thought. Of course there would be more than one protection spell on a place like this.
“No,” Draco cut him off. “There was no other way for me; my family was with him, and I was with my family. The same way you were with yours.”
“I would have tried to offer you money of course, so you wouldn’t have to sell dangerous potions on the black market.” He continued.
“Who else would you snag, Draco Malfoy? The king of vampires is just good enough for you,” Harry smiled.
Draco waved his wand and a small hourglass appeared. The sand inside was green and silver. He meant business apparently.
Harry smiled. “You have the scar to prove it, too.”
“I talked to Henri,” Draco answered with a shrug.
“Maybe,” Harry answered.
“What do you call this then?” Draco asked, he waved a hand between them. His hands were pale and slender, his fingers long. A fragment from Belladonna’s book came to mind, a very sensual bit of writing about, what was basically just a handjob, but Harry had to will himself not to blush as he followed Draco’s hand with his eyes.
“Goyle was killed in his home,” Draco pointed out and Potter winced.
Draco gave him a look. “No, no one messed with me, Harry.”
Potter shrugged. “I don’t wonder about the past anymore. It’s not like we can change it. Besides, it is not too late for us Draco.”
“And then what? The whole thing will begin from anew. You will forget, you will remember maybe with another scar. I won't know where you are. And even if by some miracle we could use a tracking spell that won't be detected by the people who run a secret medical facility, you would be in no condition to help me break you and Draco out. He is surely still under the Imperius Curse. He can't go against their wishes, you won't have your wand.”
“Calm down,” Blaise said. “I didn’t attack the boy who lived, and neither did anyone else.” He walked over to his trunk and got out a wand. It was Harry’s old one.
Blaise laughed. “I admire your self-confidence, but I’ve seen how he looks at me, Draco.”
“Bedroom?”
It was not the life he had imagined as a kid, but except for the Visions, the cause for them, and his little problem with human touch, he was doing alright.
“You don’t remember why you did it, do you?”
“I didn’t realize it was so-“
“With you naked before me? Always, Malfoy,” Harry said.
“Something else,” Draco replied and touched his hand to the barrier as well. Harry could feel the heat of Draco’s palm but nothing else. He could hear Draco perfectly too, like there wasn’t anything separating them at all.
Draco smiled. “Yes, I know.” He watched Potter eat the cakes and once he was finished Draco said, “Back to your partner, Auror Bain.”
Harry looked at him, his green eyes vivid and dark and alive. “Yes.”
“Back off Weasley,” Draco hissed.
“That came out wrong,” he said a second later.
Draco’s fingers curled around his cock. “You will love it.”
“I bet you did. I bet Granger and Weasley told you all that there is to know about me,” Draco interrupted hotly and shoved the sleeve of his robes up to show Potter the Dark Mark. He hadn’t taken it willingly, but it was there now, and he was done feeling ashamed for it.
Harry had always thought that he wasn’t a big reader when he had been at Hogwarts, but found out later that he enjoyed stories well enough and the Wizarding stories usually tended to keep his attention. He had a few favorite authors in the muggle world too, but he tended to stay away from all the stuff about magic. It was just too weird, because he caught himself shaking his head and comparing fiction to reality. That was no way to get sucked into a story or enjoy a book.
“Dinner is not a date,” Harry replied and watched as Draco blinked and relaxed just a fraction.
“I bet you can,” Draco commented. “Don’t think it would work with this guy.”
“What side?”
“Yes, I am sure you did,” Potter replied.
“That would be risky and it would still leave them enough time to evacuate if we should hit the wrong ones first,” Antoine said. “I can't make it on my own.”
“I did some digging like you asked, Harry,” Granger said and then handed them both copies of her findings.
“You are gorgeous, you know that?” Draco asked, but Harry was pretty sure he didn’t expect an answer. “Especially naked and hard on your knees for me. Desperate for my cock.”
“Did you think about killing me?” Harry wanted to know.
“That could work,” Blaise said.
Ivar said and Draco took the quill in hand. A scene was forming in his head already and he really wasn’t sure if it was his doing or if Ivar was something else, whispering it to him. In the end it really didn’t matter, Draco thought: it was going to be written either way.
“I want to fuck a pretty boy, Potter and I realize that it’s an issue with people trying to kill me, but maybe we can come to an arrangement,” Draco said.
“And I do fancy you,” Draco said. Harry smiled and it was hard to breathe for a long moment, but Draco got a grip, because he had to. “I just think you need to be aware that this won’t be all rainbows and candy, Harry.”
“Why haven't you tried to find him before?” Harry asked.
Draco read it and then he read it again.
“Well, there are rumors of course about the new book,” a young witch a table over said, and Draco tried not to react to it. Speculation about his new book were rampant to put it mildly.
“Well, rest assured it is not me who is hunting down former Deatheaters and war criminals.”
“He doesn’t always know everything, Pansy, because no one knows everything.”
It was both in Vision No. 33 and No.34. “That's the thing you find out of place? Not my face?”
Ivan nodded. “But you want to.”
“Because I’m stubborn and reckless and I want to get to know you. And I think you refused just out of spite or on principle.”
“What does my gender have to do with that?” Draco asked.
“You really think you can make me do things, Potter?” Draco asked.
“Did one of my friends do this to you?” Harry asked. The whole Weasley clan had a temper after all. Hermione could get really angry on his behalf as well. Neither Ron nor Hermione liked Draco. He was told that he hadn’t liked Draco either, but he couldn’t remember that. And there was this unexplainable draw to this young man. Harry didn’t see any reason to fight that pull.
“You want to hunt them down yourself,” Potter answered.
Blaise grinned. “I don’t know. Maybe being friends with Harry Potter rubbed off on me.”
“What is the new book about anyway?“ Blaise asked.
Potter ran a hand through his unruly hair. It was charming now, not a mess, but a nest of soft looking wild curls Draco would love to run his fingers through.
“If you have a problem with this situation, go and talk to the headmistress or you know, Potter, who it seems has a thing for me-“
“How do you know how the previous victims died?”
Harry shrugged. “Maybe I am a very good actor when I need to be?”
Harry’s green boxers were tight and the outline of his hard cock very visible. The tip of his cock was peeking out and Draco bent down and ran his tongue over that exposed flesh. Harry inhaled sharply and his hands found their way to Draco’s shoulders. It was only a matter of time until they would end up in Draco’s hair.
“He’s done it before,” Pansy pointed out.
“I am very relieved to hear that,” Draco said. He couldn’t quite suppress the sarcasm or maybe it was more accurate to say he didn’t want to suppress it.
A small smile turned up her lips. “Good luck, Mr. Malfoy.“
Draco nodded.
“I love you,” Harry answered, simply. It was the truth. Antoine had known it too. Probably because he felt the same way about Draco.
Which was of course true. No one would even show up, Draco was sure, and especially not when he wanted to get Potter arrested for stalking. He didn’t need Aurors on his property anyway and Potter, the bastard, knew it.
Harry took another sip of coffee and then sat down on the – thankfully softly upholstered – chair.
“Better than you,” Harry said and felt childish a second later. Thankfully Astra let it slide.
Astra nodded. “You preaching to the choir here. I’m with you on the whole thing. Just saying that not everyone is so enthusiastic about guarding former Deatheaters and pardoned war criminals.”
“So we have to feel pity for him now?” Ron asked.
“You’ve been holed up in your flat for months, Draco. We’re a bit worried, you’re losing touch with reality.“
“You know we’re dating,” Harry said. He had told his friends as soon as Draco had allowed it. It went over surprisingly well. Probably because everyone, except for Harry himself, had apparently known that he had been crushing on Draco sixth year.
Draco nodded. “I think I was alive again.”
“Touch me,” Draco gasped and both Harry and Antoine reached for his pale pink cock, their fingers tangled for a second and Draco groaned: his body shaking, coming all over their fingers.
“Blaise has it. I told him to keep it safe,” Draco answered. He had had reasons. “McGonagall wants to look at it and then she will give it back to you.”
“Back to the investigation. I mean I would love to talk with you about all this more, but my life is in danger,” Draco said. The funny thing was that he kept forgetting about the dangerous madman or woman lurking outside these walls. He kept forgetting because it was so easy to be with Potter.
He woke up in the middle of the night and grabbed for his pastels. He wasn’t looking at the paper because his mind was somewhere else, somewhere green and lush that tasted bitter on his tongue. Like regret, though he wasn’t sure if it was his or someone else’s.
That night Harry came all over his fingers to the memory of gray eyes and Antoine's wood and copper scent and didn't wonder what it meant.
“The murders,” Harry prompted.
“No way in hell, he doesn’t get another Knut out of me, or you,” Draco protested, nearly angrily.
Draco thought about it. “No...once I went home to the Manor.”
“Wizards did this to me,” Draco replied, balling his hands to fists. The anger was surprising, really; he had thought he was over it by now, but seeing it like this... It was different, seeing it from the outside.
“It’s blood protected,” Draco said.
“You talked to Henri,” Harry repeated. Draco nodded.
“You will be dragged into it, Harry. Papers are already speculating about the nature of our relationship.”
“I refuse to give into fear again, Harry. I had enough of that. I really fucking did,” Draco answered.
“Good, I am ready for this to be over,” Draco replied.
“It doesn’t mean you’re doing it wrong,” Draco teased.
He breathed easier once Antoine had kissed him. “A trigger, I guess…” he said, feeling embarrassed.
What harm could it do, really?
He looked at the cover, it was moving, the wind gently stirring the leaves of the dark trees. It looked harmless enough at a first glance, but the longer you looked at it, the more that little bit of darkness in the right corner pulled you in, like something or someone was lurking there, waiting for you to step between the trees. Harry got the feeling of the Forbidden Forest from it, even if it didn’t look like the Forbidden Forest at all. With a cover like that he had expected to read some romance mystery and had been totally prepared to hate it and be bored as well.
“The place is huge and he lives here alone, with a few servants. Before you ask, yes, I talked to them all. And if you can believe it or not, they adore him. Not a bad word to say about Malfoy. The whole lot of them.”
“I can walk and I want to walk out of here, Potter before they know that I am trying to escape!” Draco hissed.
Harry kissed his cheek. “Feel free to roam these halls as if they were yours.”
“Yes, but you’re...you haven’t left the house for years, Draco, and now you’re going to the Manor. You hate the Manor. Not to mention: Potter.”
She glanced from Draco to the painting, then back to Draco. In the painting the symbols and lines that were now silvery scars on his body where crimson and dripping.
“No,” Harry replied.
Luna was always the first who noticed the warning of the wards. Draco had a sneaking suspicion that the wards liked her better than Pansy and himself. Or, possibly, the whole house did.
“Yes,” Draco replied.
“Go for it Potter, my home is your home after all right now. And I do want you to feel comfortable here,” Draco answered.
“I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to make it sound like you let it happen. I’m just trying to get a picture of what went on. Please continue.”
“Or I could just spend a few days here and we could be naked together in this house,” Draco offered, and Harry loved that about Draco. Maybe it was true, maybe once a Slytherin decided to give themselves over to one person, they would do anything for that person. Maybe they were the most loyal people and Harry was honored that Draco had decided to give himself over to Harry.
Harry had no idea what he was doing here, standing in front of Malfoy’s bedroom door like – some kind of creep, really. He took a breath and then let it out slowly. He was about to call it all off when the heavy wooden door swung open.
“Don’t be daft, Potter. It’s not the first time someone lied to me,” he replied. He could have said something cruel like it’s not the first time a good fuck lied to me, it had been at the tip of his tongue, but he reined it in.
Harry frowned. “Oh, you know who it is,” Harry whispered.
“You’re working with Potter on that murder case?” Pansy asked, crossing her arms in front of her chest.
“You know what I want?” Harry asked.
Harry didn’t really want to admit it, but the answer to that was no.
“All this,” Draco said. “And I don’t even think it’s that bad. What I do hate him for is the inability to touch or be touched by anyone. What I hate is that I was confined to this house for years because brushing against someone on a crowded street would cause me so much pain I’d pass out. And if you bring him in, he won’t die, and who knows what an interference from Dementors would do to the spell. It could make it worse, Harry.”
Harry grabbed one of Draco’s legs for a better angle and pushed inside, slowly. Being inside Draco’s tight heat felt incredible.
Bain nodded. “This is him,” she handed Draco a photograph.
Harry looked at Ivan. He liked the guy; he was young, he was loyal, and he was different, probably because he had gone to Durmstrang and not Hogwarts. He was the only partner Harry actually liked working with. Before Ivan, he had six different partners over ten years and had disliked them all.
He liked spending time with Neville, because the boy was less intense than any of the Weasleys or Hermione.
“I noticed you’re only using non-verbal magic these days, Draco.”
“I wished, I knew how Draco and I became – whatever you want to call it. I wish I could get my memories back.”
“Yes, but the scandal is big enough already. No one wants to see Malfoy dead.”
He said it in a tone that was nearly hostile, and tinged with sadness. This fucked Harry up inside like the painting hadn’t. He had the urge to grab Draco’s arm and rub it, to comfort him somehow. After all, he knew how it felt to see things through someone else’s eyes or mind. He ignored this urge, however.
“Merlin, fuck,” Pansy said from the door, and the tray she had been holding slipped from her fingers; a thought from Draco had it floating safely in the air. “It’s—fuck, is that you?”
“Merlin, Potter,” Draco hissed and Harry opened his eyes. Draco’s gaze was on him and his eyes were dark with arousal.
Just imagining Draco naked and wet made Harry’s cock hard.
“It’s probably going to be even more scandalous than the last one,” her companion replied.
The first words that came to mind were: Merlin, fuck yes. Of course. “I want to make love to you Draco,” was what he said instead. “Badly.”
Draco laughed and then moaned when Harry pressed his cock against Draco’s. Draco was staring at him while he pleasured himself and Harry was staring right back. Yes, Draco was very attractive and he was very... Draco, but there was something more here too. At least Harry thought so.
“A toppy top who likes to top? Yes, Draco I figured that one out and still here I am and I think you should do something about the state we’re in now.”
“We will do it the smart way,” Harry said.
Potter sighed. “I know it’s not ideal right now, but are you really willing to risk your life for some mediocre sex?”
Draco shrugged and then shuddered. “It might well be. I need to call Henri.”
“Morning.” His voice sounded sleepy and gravely and warm and Draco wanted to bend him over the very sturdy looking kitchen table and fuck him senseless, but that wasn’t going to happen right now, so he did the next best thing which was to grab Harry by the hair and crash his mouth against Harry’s. Harry taste minty and warm and heat pooled in Draco’s stomach.
“Oh,” Draco said.
“Beat him up. I mean, I am aware you taught him all kinds of things, probably a lot of these things were not on McGonagall’s list, so he would have a chance against me in a duel, but let’s face it: it’s not only bravery that can save you.”
“What if I do it anyway?” Draco challenged.
“Yes, we did. But they don’t matter to most of these people who have lost someone,“ Blaise said.
“Ron does,” Harry answered. “He thinks I should know how to defend myself.”
Draco let the silk tie slide through his fingers, it felt soft and cool against his skin.
“I’m needed back at the office,” Potter told him.
“Blaise will publish your books no matter what,” Pansy said.
“Glass?” Harry asked.
Draco’s face wasn’t – if he was objective and he was not when it came to Draco – he never really had been, his face wasn’t really beautiful or handsome as a whole, Harry thought. But it was for sure interesting, he made you look twice, made your gaze linger on those pale but too thin lips, the sharp eyes, the pale hair. Draco was a bit too sharp too be called beautiful and a bit too unusual in places to be called classically handsome.
"Boys," Hermione muttered again, rolling her eyes.
Draco saw with satisfaction Potter's face fall. The
against the parchment, burning it to ash in mere seconds.
"I know what you mean," perked Neville up beside Zabini. "It certainly is weird, but... well, I don't know, if Harry develops feelings for Malfoy it's not our call to make. I think he deserves happiness in whichever way it comes to him."
Draco's eyes were starting to tear up in pure happiness, his ridiculously Gryffindor was finally coming out to everyone in the most embarrassing way. Draco wanted to lean forward and hide his flushing face in his boyfriend's chest.
"Mr. Potter, did we have an accident?" Professor Sprout asked beside him, eyeing his hand. She held a small pot with healing salve in her hand and gave Draco an approving look. "Well, as I see, Mr. Malfoy has already done the cooling spell. When you are done holding hands, put that salve on, and continue repotting. The lesson is almost over." She nodded to Harry, who snatched his hand back from Draco at her words, and pressed the little crucible into his uninjured hand.
Harry gulped audibly as he felt Malfoy’s long fingers caress through his black locks and pressed against his scalp. Electric shocks ripped through his body as he looked up into startled silver eyes.
"Let yourself be surprised. I will spoil you rotten today," Harry answered with a slight growl to his voice, as he smirked at Draco and pushed him back down onto the duvet.
"But this is brilliant," Pansy exclaimed and shot Hermione a mirthful grin. "Well, maybe you should cover your boyfriend's ears for this one, my dear friend," she cackled.
"Uhm, yes. I’m sorry about that. I was completely out of line there and I know that you anyway would never do that. I was just so angry that it slipped out.” Ron apologized and looked at his friend with worried eyes.
When he had gotten back to the castle and laid down in his bed, he pulled his duvet closely around himself and almost immediately fell asleep, dreaming once again of green eyes, wild black hair, and a beautiful crooked smile, that had belonged only to him for two years.
"This isn’t about Draco and you," she giggled like a five-year-old and winked at Harry.
When the owls had disappeared and it was a little quieter, the food appeared in front of them, which was completely held in Valentine's Day fashion being pink, white, silver, and red. The house-elves had once again outdone themselves. There was even a small fountain in the middle of the table from which the pink fizz spewed out when one hit their goblet against it.
Day in and day out Harry pondered on how he was going to get Draco to listen to him; he was utterly lost without him. Even his teachers had to admonish him several times to be more attentive in class because his thoughts always revolved around Draco and their broken relationship.
