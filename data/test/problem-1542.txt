Pieces of parchment lay strewn about the room, aged and wrinkled and covered in different shades of ink, completely faded by the years. It appeared that nothing in this room had escaped this treatment, the years and the sun from the window fading and memorializing the world within the four walls. Stepping into this room was like stepping into a different time, even after it was abandoned for how many years now. Sirius Black’s room was a time machine, leading back to the world in which the handsome, dark-haired teenager brooded, and where the much more world-weary, gaunt thirty-year-old wizard had returned. A piercing remembrance of his life, and his death.
Quickly a rush of red hair and bleary eyes made its way to the kitchen, followed by Harry and Hermione, who stood out from the diminished crowd of Weasleys. Mrs. Weasley clutched in her hand several letters, one of which open and slightly crushed. She nervously glanced around at everyone than started to read the letter aloud.
“Do something while I’m away, won't you? I’m sure that Neville would be open to meeting up for a drink. And George is having that party, you could go if you wanted to. I do worry you’ll become a hermit one of these days, Harry.” She said, tenderness and worry apparent on her face. Harry smiled back at her and promised her he’d try. Maybe he could meet up with Neville for drinks, but he wasn’t going to George’s party. He already had plans for that day.
“What was that about?” Asked Ron, his voice containing a lot of sensitivity compared to his usual tones.
Ok ya'll, I've had this story raddling around in my head for years - literally years - and I'm trying to get it out of me so I can move on with my life. I didn't mean it to be as angsty as it is apparently becoming, but I swear Harry will find happiness, and the story will (hopefully) be spicier soon.
“I don’t think she wants to be with me.” Harry stared, stunned at his own words. Could that really be it? It was her who begged him not to leave her for some heroic sacrifice, who had given him that passionate kiss before Bill and Fleur's wedding. It didn’t match.
“I have been thinking and, well, I think we need to think about what we are doing. That is  why I’ve brought you up here. I do my best thinking up here.” She leaned against the tree behind her as Harry contemplated her words.
"You never mentioned that," Ginny swatted at Luna's knee, accepting the joint from her but keeping it away from her face. Harry took it, holding it in his lips while he messed with ginny's hair, looping and knotting it loosely.
“These are good for tea,” Harry said, “there's another kind that looks similar, but will make your throat close up.” Draco looked at him skeptically as Harry took a little perring knife from his jacket pocket and started cutting the mushrooms from the dirt. Draco was so close to him, he could smell the smoke still lingering in the fabric of his jacket and the rose scent that seemed to follow him around. And something sweet, honey perhaps.
Jordan was tall and stocky, he was pale and freckled and angular. Draco weakened when his voice dropped to a low whisper, or when Jordan's sandy curls fell over his eyes. He liked to count his freckles, the ones that spotted the bridge of his nose and eyebrows and covered his arms. He looked good in knits and sweaters and the colour yellow draco discovered over the short months of their secret relationship.
"you're not being excluded, you're just dragging the team down so they are moving on without you," Sean said and flipped his page, continuing his writing. He looked up at Harry finally and frowned, "That was a bit harsh, sorry."
“Would you like to join me for a stroll this evening?” luna asked airily, her elbow brushing against dracos so he knew she was talking to him instead of the other students on their workbench. It was funny hearing luna speak so formally and properly. Draco supposed she was putting it on a little to impress him or something, he thought they were thoughts luna might have.
"And you, Mister Malfoy” she turned to draco, “ this is the third time you've shown up late to my class," she chirped ruefully, Harry sat there sheepishly with his head down pretending not to hear and picking at his thumbnail "do you not value my precious time?"
Harry reached down his top and pulled at the chain around his neck, presenting a coiled snake carved out of some sort of white material. "It's a bassisk carved out of one's tooth," he grinned, turning it around this way and that, "pretty cool ay?"
"here." draco took the flower between his fingers, twirling it around. "From Harry," Luna grinned at him, having already forgotten the whole story, and stood next to draco. She paid attention to the rest of the demonstration, smiling politely at pots, seemingly oblivious to dracos dilemma.
"You can borrow that one if you want," Harry told him, trying to hide a laugh that might come across as discouraging. He found it cute that Draco might be interested, that he had come so far from the boy who handed all lesser tasks down to elvs. He could see draco at a stove top, cooking a fine dinner with the same skill and effortlessness he had for brewing potions. It was a nice image, Harry smiled to himself.
He shrugged, trying to look at his shoulders. His chest where his knees had been pressed against were pale against the burnt looking flesh around it. “It's nice and warm, you should join me,” he responded.
What was he thinking? Maybe in a different life things would have been different, but in this one all he could hope for was uninterrupted nights to himself and his dreams, and for another person to appear in them.
"do you want coffee?" he asked, standing in the doorway. luna turned around from where she was crouching digging through a pile of clothes and sniffing each one. she was naked, but harry had grown used to this as her most comfortable state and leant down to sniff the shirt she held out to him. He shook his head and took it to put in the laundry later.
Dracos stomach flipped as he recognised the feeling of attraction. He shook the cat off his lap and stood up suddenly, declaring something about checking on the potions. He closed the door gently behind him, not wanting to come off as irritated, and went to the bathroom. His wet clothes were still in the tub, he thumbed his forehead in frustration and embarrassment and threw them into the laundry room and went to stand over the potions. Draco would not be attracted to Harry potter. But he could already feel strong arms wrap around his waist and pull him back into a firm body, he could feel warm breath on the back of his neck and stubble graze his jaw, soft lips on his cheek. He was thrown back to sixth year, the little fling he had had with jordan, the soft hufflepuff boy who had seen right through him and held him regardless, had kept their secrets and indulged draco in a kindness he hadn't deserved, and whom had left humbly and with understanding when draco had lashed out fearfully.
Harry thought stupidly. He followed him into the kitchen, setting his glass down on the sink and washing his hands while draco rooted through a draw. He produces a little plastic pack of fabric bandaids, muggle brand from a pharmacy. Harry smiled at them, so draco did explore muggle streets. draco passed him a towel to dry off, the bleeding wasn't bad any more, it had mostly stopped actually. But Harry watched draco tear open the little packet with his slender fingers and obediently held out his hand. The soft pads of malfoys fingers held him gently as he wrapped the bandage around the tiny wound and pressed the sticky material down firmly, smoothing it over his finger. Draco couldn't look Harry in the eye, he was pretending to concentrate on the bandaid as he held Harry's hand in his own, smothering Harry's fingers between his warm palms. Harry watched him curiously, experimenting with how far draco was willing to push their unsure relationship. It was a cruel and useless game of chicken that would end with them getting hurt that Harry couldn't quite help himself but to play. It excited him, some disgusting, twisted part of his being felt glee that he was finally able to inflict some karma, to torment Draco as he had done to Harry all those years ago.
Draco laughed nervously, not sure if they had reached the point of beig able to joke about the past quite yet. But he appreciated her effort at normalizing him. Harry peeled himself from the couch, setting the empty mug he had been cradling down on the coffee table.
“you can aparate here,” harry said, snapping draco back to reality. They were under the streetlamp, draco could see vines snaking around its cold metal surface, little buds of sleeping blooms decorating the leathery stalk. He looked at harry, his hair wild and jacket zipped up to his throat, stubble on his chin, skin golden under the lamplight. God he was beautiful draco thought. He apparated away with a sharp crack and not another dangerous word.
“You still have moss in your hair,” he said, then pointed to the little pink mushrooms in answer to Harry's question. Harry ignored the comment and squatted down at the shrooms. He squatted next to draco and scratched the surface of one of their caps with a stick he found on the ground. The abraised area of the shroom turned purple as it oxidised.
“What's wrong?” ginny asked. She flushed the loo and kicked her shorts off and slipped out of her shirt. Wincing Ginny stepped into the tub and under the water, settling in next to Harry, his body scalding besides her own. “Did Malfoy do something?”
"Ron and 'mione and I were going to catch up there Sunday night because of the government budget cuts and the student free day monday and what not," what was he doing? Harry picked at his nail and winced, the sticky feeling of blood touched his fingers, "I'll rope in Luna and Sean and prue and we can make a night of it."
Harry shrugged, "I suppose the regular amount of hungry," he said, slipping out of his jacket for the first time that night. The green knitted sweater was too tight on him, it hugged his body and showed off his thin waist in a way that almost made him look feminine, or maybe it was the low neckline, except he had strong arms and a broad chest and shoulders and draco spent a moment too long pondering what it would be like to fit his body against harrys. The sweater was a shade deeper than that of his eyes, it really suited him.
“You better not be knotting my hair,” Ginny grumbled, turning sharply to look at harry. He smiled politely and shook his head, ash dropping onto ginny's shoulder. She brushed it off and turned away and Harry quickly raked his fingers over her scalp, marveling at the deep red colour of her curls. Luna plucked the joint from Harry's lips just before he got burnt and snuffed it out on Ginny's shoe. She had a thing against putting fire near grass, something about attracting a little gremlin creature that protects good lawns, and luna was always without shoes apart from at school where they were sort of a requirement. Even then though she wore sandals and socks, something most of the muggle born kids cringed at.
"I'm sorry, come in," Draco huffed, a little embarrassed as he opened the door. harry stared at him for a second while draco squinted at the bright sunlight that streamed in through the doorway. he hadn't anticipated sleeping in so late, it was 12:36 according to his clock. he left harry in the doorway to decide for himself weather he would come inside and angrily opened up some curtains, filling the unit with light. he vowed to leave the curtains open at night from then on. "I won't be a minute, sit down anywhere," Draco said and hurried to his room. He threw on a silver knit jumper and trouser pants and his favourite socks with the grip on the bottom so he wouldn't slide about on his polished wooden floors.
"i like your place," he offered up eloquently, looking at draco now fully clothed standing nervously in the doorway. The pressure seemed to be let out of him for a second and his shoulders slumped in relief he didn't even know he was waiting on. draco nodded and set about setting up a cauldron on the stovetop unhurriedly, pouring a measurement of aqua into it to start boiling.
Ginny grinned at the posh way he spoke and held out her hand which draco shook. She had a firm grip, tough skin, not at all the tender hands of what one would expect form a young lady.
“Dracos not a git,” Luna told him, launching herself back into the garden. They had chosen the hardest patch to tackle first. The weather wasn't going to get any better any time soon so they had wanted to tackle the hard stuff and leave the easier ones for when it all went to shit. Harry hoped they might have some spare time after school on monday, luna had planned a day out with some mates tomorrow, they were going to see a film and bake bread or something at amanda's house. Her parents were professionals apparently, luna had been trying to get into cooking recently. “Besides, he really likes you, I think  he's liked you for a while actually.”
The two cats inspected each other, interrupted by large human hands scratching their ears and backs, and finally settled down again satisfied with their greetings. Tybalt was eyeing harry sceptically, looking slightly betrayed that he was allowing an intruding cat onto his lap. Harry knew he was going to suffer for it later. In fact he felt like he was suffering for it now. The way draco was watching him felt like an accusation in the waiting/. It was quite discerning. Being observed like that. Like it was Harry being inspected for oh&s and not the house.
"Yeah alright," Harry grunted, rummaging in his satuel and producing a cheap copper cauldron. He walked around the counter and set it up next to Dracos, going back to his bag to find his notes.
Luna was completely blazed when they returned to the clearing, humming that same song to herself happily and waving her arms through the air. The cats were sitting by her head next to ginny who was eating a plain bread roll. Harry said something stupid about ginny not bringing him a roll too and pulled tybalt into his lap. Ginny graciously broke off a piece of bread for him.
"Thats a muggle station isn't it?" Draco more stated than asked. Harry raised an eyebrow at him and draco shrugged.
“Maybe I did, you don't know that. Maybe it's a surprise,” Harry told her, pulling his chamomile jars out of their pantry where he kept spare mesh bags. He upended his bag and began picking through the flowers, discarding the stems in the compost bin. Draco watched him, his clever fingers knew the action well and he found himself helping out. Wedged into the small kitchen space next to Harry, their elbows brushing together, they worked through the pile of flowers and chatted.
To Harry's horror ginny caved in and started to get up, mumbling something about the temperature inside being
Harry looked down. It was worse than it felt, the bleeding around his cuticles was pooling and looked terrible. What a terrible habit Harry had to stop, it was a nervous twitch of sorts he had developed, he hardly noticed he was doing it most of the time. He examined his rough hands, trying to see them from draco's point of view. Untidy and torn and calloused, he looked tough Harry supposed.
Draco caught a glimpse of the clock on the wall and made a noise, it showed the time to be around half past seven. It shocked him a little, that conversation was so easy with people who used to despise each other, he felt a little embarrassed to still be there actually. As he started looking for the right words to excuse himself ginny yawned and pulled herself out of her chair.
Hermione was the first one to see it, his deep-rooted dissatisfaction, and that’s when she kept bringing up Dr. Clearwater.
“Moony..Oh hell..Remus…” Sirius was at a complete lack for words. The terror that would come from facing the man who wrecked your life, yet having to seem not at all perturbed, and needing to simply accept his existence, that could be easily classified as hell. Sirius watched as Remus, younger than him in age, but never in maturity, sighed wearily, looking sad beyond his years as he sank against the couch and leaned against Sirius’s shoulder.
Harry looked around him, and feeling began trickling into his body. He felt the warmth of the common room’s fireplace at his back and saw a number of students around him, draped over sofas. A group of girls were studying in the corner, huddling over a book that Harry somehow knew to be Herbology. Two couples sat near the entrance, having a conversation and passing a small muggle trinket around them, and then Harry saw what was right in front of him. Harry saw four teenage boys, slouched onto the couches directly in front of the fire. The furniture was arranged differently to when he was at Hogwarts, but he still recognized his favorite chair sitting between the two couches. No one sat there now.
But this belonged to his godfather, and he had found it in his room. It shouldn’t be the same type of danger as the diary of Lord Voldemort himself, even though this little book did have the flavor of magic that Harry wasn’t aware of. He didn’t know if he should touch it. He did know who would have an opinion on the matter, however. He went to the drawing-room desk and pulled out a self-inking quill and some parchment, and wrote:
Ginny was beautiful and perfect. She and Harry would take walks and play quidditch, but the moment of recognition came shortly after they settled into life at the burrow. Ginny came over to Harry, who was sitting slightly awkwardly by Ron and Hermione who were talking with their hands intertwined. She saved him and confidently  asked for a walk.
“Remus. What happened?” Sirius Black waited until his friend had sat down on the ordinary couch before he started his questioning. Remus Lupin looked up and met Sirius’s concerned grey stare.“I-I found him. G-Greyback... The one who-who bit me.” Sirius’s eyes widened and he took a second to sit down next to the trembling man. Remus was ordered not to tell anyone of his mission to infiltrate the werewolf community, but he would never keep anything from Sirius and James, Dumbledore knew that and trusted him to use his discretion.
His mind continued to wage this battle until Harry acquiesced and picked up the book. He let it fall open to a page, and his fingers were immediately drawn to trace the date, June 1976. Then, the strangest feeling came over him, as if his magic was being pulled, sucked into the tiny pocket-sized book. Harry began to panic, an overwhelming sensation of deja vu overcoming his senses as he recalled his first time entering into a pensive. This was like that, except so much more jarring and disorienting. He first felt his magic leave him, and then he was hearing the babble of teenage voices, then smelling food.. Something like spiced cake, something sweet and nutty. Then he lost the sensation of sight, and then suddenly his feet were upon the ground, and he was standing, not sitting. He was back at Hogwarts.
It did some good, Remus attempted a smile, but this only brought him back to that night, as a young boy, that Grayback snuck into his window, hungry for vengeance and flesh. That was the night that Remus’s life changed, where he lost all hope of an average life, a steady job, a stereotypical family. Everything was torturous until Dumbledore arrived and swept him from his doorstep into the loving home of Hogwarts. Into Sirius, James, Lily, and Peter. His relief and slight slip into gratefulness only allowed him to sob harder, flustering the caring man in front of him.
Hermione’s letter did little to comfort him, as it explained the idea that there were other records like this out there, but it raised more questions as to why the journal was letting Harry see memories, transporting him to these experiences even though he certainly didn’t own the diary. Harry reached for the little book and was shocked to find the leather cord tied around it, closing the book with a neat little bow. Harry certainly hadn’t left it that way, and the chord stubbornly resisted being tugged at, tightening itself further at his ministrations. Harry gave up and stared at the little bound volume for a second, unsure what to do. He decided to charm one of his desk drawers open and keep it there for the time being.
Oliver hadn’t really changed since Hogwarts. His dark hair was still windswept by a life spent on the broom, and was still tousled even in the years after he had switched to coaching Puddlemire until phasing himself out of the professional Quidditch world. His change of profession hadn’t made his well-maintained balance between burley and lean any less defined or attractive, though, and due to the slowed aging of wizards, he didn’t look a day over thirty. Harry took the time to examine him as Oliver sat on the sofa, the dark material of the other man’s muggle turtleneck sweater clinging to his shoulders. His oak eyes gleamed as they met Harry’s. His face had been etched a slightly weathered look, as he now spent his time in a small wizarding community on an island in Scotland, a short walk from the sea. He owned a broom repair shop, and Harry had sent his son’s James’s first broom there when he was too rough on it. They’d stayed in contact since then.
“I’ll see you ‘en, hey, Harry?” Wood said, and he made his way towards the fireplace. Harry nodded, glancing at him quickly and exchanging a smile, his stomach churning. “We’ll need tae talk, then, though.”
“It’s okay. I guess. I think she--I think she did it for the best.” Harry squeezed back and her grip relaxed a little. Ron stared at Harry and said, “You want me to talk to her for you, mate?”
With that, he heard her frustrated sigh which was followed by an amicable goodbye to Oliver, and the pop of her apparating away. Harry’s feet were still wary of moving, as his socks had fallen deeply in love with standing on this particular patch of floor and were therefore reluctant to move towards the drawing room. Why was Oliver here? What had he spoken with Ginny about? It took a moment, but his curiosity finally dissolved the sweet honey that stuck his feet to the floorboards,  keeping him from moving, and he walked with care towards the drawing room.
Lupin looked at James and rolled his eyes. “Bastard. You’re putting ideas into his head. Don’t do that.” His voice was quiet but sure, and he shifted on the sofa to get up. “Now, I’ve got a study date with Lily and I’ve run out of excuses for being late” He stood to leave, and Harry felt a deep pain resonate within his muscles. Exhaustion. Pure exhaustion.
The  remaining week flew by quickly, and Harry didn’t stop to think about the little book very much, except when his insomnia kept him up at night. His insomnia was always worse when Ginny was home, the soft huff of her breath next to him on their bed like an invasion into his brain. He couldn’t sleep with her there, and he often snuck down to the living room to curl up on the couch. But even that didn’t work, only giving him small batches of restfulness. At least Ginny was leaving this Friday for Holland, and Harry could get several days of restful sleep while she was gone.
The book was dark and worn, and appeared to be hand-bound, made of leather and crude stitches. He cracked open the volume to somewhere in the middle and saw date markings on the pages.  Harry was immediately wary, remembering the last time a strange diary fell into his hands. This looked similar to the Riddle diary, but this journal was softer, and the dates on the pages were all handwritten in distinctive, looping handwriting. February 1989  one read, and flipping to the next page it was June 1992. The dates were mismatched and out of order, and skipped from day to day, and skipped some years and months altogether. Harry noticed that a quarter of the pages were blank altogether, as he gently flipped through the book.
Harry waved his wand and set several cleaning spells to work, watching as dust and dirt was swept up from each surface, leaving the windowsill and faded bed sheets gleaming dully, adopting a slightly more vibrant hue. Sitting down on the bed again, Harry was hit by a wave of exhaustion and sunk into the crimson down comforter. He heard Ginny moving around downstairs, and the pop of an absolutely ancient Kretcher as he moved about the house. A door opened and shut, causing a rattle throughout the house. There were footsteps and then Ginny was speaking to someone, he couldn’t tell who, as he heard the murmur of her voice through the open door, and the reply of a male voice, drifting away as they moved away from the main staircase. It was exhausting, trying to smile and be happy for Ginny. It wasn’t like he always was this way, like he was pretending for the past twenty years. Quite the opposite really, he was so enchanted by his beautiful wife and his energetic children early on. Harry thought of how he loved his job, the thrill and adrenaline of working being so sweet, being able to protect others again. He even felt relief and satisfaction at the calm monotony of deskwork and publicity that had slowly but surely begun absorbing his time as he moved up the ranks over the years. He had grown calm and confident with the rhythms of his life, of making dinners for his wife and kids during the week, of having Ginny call off to go to some work event, of meeting up with the Weasley clan and Hermione. He liked the time he got to spend with Neville and valued the games of quidditch that sometimes spontaneously happened on the weekends when Seamus and Dean were in town. He reveled in the magic community and visited Hogwarts, his first home, periodically. McGonagall was always happy to see him, escorting him up to the headmistress’s office and offering him tea and biscuits.
Dust still played in the air as Harry contemplated the tribulations of his cousin and classmates, the room untouched when it should have been well on it’s way to renovation by now. Harry shuttered to think that the last person to tear through these drawers was not it’s owner, but a disgruntled Snape on the hunt for some sign of his lost love. Snape. Another Slytherin bully who never had the time or space to become truly reformed. A menace for sure, but someone who could love deeply and become so driven by it that he’d risk his life. This room felt like a time capsule, something Harry wasn’t ready to let go of yet. It was, after all, his one last strand attaching his godfather’s presence to this house, as they had long ago removed the last remanence of the black family tree, hiring three ministry wizards to finally take down Walaburga’s portrait and the dismembered heads of the house-elves. They did those things early on, right after Ginny moved in with Harry. Their friends gathered together to try and truly cleanse the house, and Harry could still remember the shrillness in Hermione’s voice as she insisted they buried each house-elf head in a marked grave. Ron rolled his eyes and Harry dragged his feet, but they managed to do it. Harry thought of Dobby each time they covered the tiny graves with dirt.
Hi! This is just a quick prologue before I get into the meat of the story. Seeing as I have nothing else to do in Quarantine, I plan to post quite regularly. I greatly appreciate your kudos and comments! They mean the world.
“You know it’s getting better- healing-, James. No need to worry about my furry little problem. It’d be wiser to be thinking about the Herbology exam next week, as I know you haven't studied.”
Due to the catastrophe of last year, we are running many of our courses again, to ensure that we have educated you fully.  We are offering recovery classes over the course of the year, along with creating an 8th year program for our students who have missed out on a year or more of schooling due to the war. We recommend that all of last year’s 7th years attend this year, but we do recognise that you have the right to not attend another year.” Mrs. Weasley paused and looked at Harry, Ron, and Hermione. She then stated, “I completely expect you to attend this year, Ronald, and although I can not do the same for you two, I hope that you choose to aswell.” She went back to reading the letter.
Remus only shifted when day broke, the weight of his head on Sirius’s thigh decreasing as he woke, and he eventually sat up and massaged a crick in his neck. Taking the opportunity to stretch, Sirius stood up and made his way towards the kitchen, knowing that Remus would join him when he was fully awake. Having this independence in his own apartment was wonderful, something that he still marveled at after the years he had spent living in the oppressive atmosphere that permeated the walls of his family home. This flat was a welcome change, and before he started making breakfast, he glanced back into the living room, watching as Remus leaned over a small leather-bound book, his eyes closed. Sirius could feel the deep emotion and magic pouring out of Remus as he turned away, a grim set to his jaw. If only this war would end, and they could forge a life for themselves, bereft of trauma and pain.
“I said that Oliver Wood stopped by! We haven't seen him in ages.” Ginny called from the drawing room, and he could sense some tension in her words.
Ron and Hermione quickly wrote up their acceptance letters, and Harry followed suit. He was unsure about this. He could probably get a job at the ministry or anywhere else if he asked. He didn’t technically need to finish his schooling. But then again, here he was, tying his letter to the School’s eagle owl, sealing his fate. Here he was, packing, several days later, making sure he had enough robes. And here he was buying his supplies. Doing the final check of his trunk. Walking calmly between the barrier of Platform 9 ¾ , unpacking his trunk on the train. Here he was, sitting by Ron and Hermione, on the Hogwarts express.
"fine. do what you want." Harry muttered, scooping up his mug to go sulk in his room for a few minutes before he had to go out for school.
"where's your bathroom?" Harry asked, after passing Draco a stirring stick without even being asked, he had just instinctively known what draco meant when he twitched a finger in its direction. it wouldnt do to be this comfortable with this man, who had killed others and enabled murder in a school. Harry needed air. his lungs were tight and he felt his heart in his chest.
of them growing to the east of the clearing, wildly swinging in the breese on delicate stems that spread upwards like a searching octopus. Draco recognised wormwood and absinthe and lavender and thick grasses and spindly shrubs of this and thick creches of that. He saw a number of the late blooming roses he had been seeking growing a few metres outside of the clearing, the old flower heads still spread open while the newer ones started to close up for the night.
“No.'' Ginny said. Looking dejected. She shoved a cat out of the way and lay down next to luna, curling into her side. Harry smiled at her fondly, sucking in smoke, and draco felt a sliver of jealousy which was quickly batted away. He had no right to get in between their relationship. Draco would eventually have to move on from this stupid crush he couldnt seem to get over. It was the damndest thing, Draco had fallen for Harry so many years ago in the robe store in Diagon alley. Back then the little boy on the stool, his ethnic appearance and shy, kind face, had caught draco's attention immediately. He had been interested in friendship, and when that offer was batted down so harshly in front of the whole year level he had grown somewhat obsessive. The stubborn allurence of
Returning home to Grimmauld Place was difficult. The nest was empty, and all Harry could do was stare at Lily’s room, at the absence of her favorite books and clothes that she had packed into her school trunk. Ginny seemed to be, to an extent, less bothered by the absence of the Potter children than Harry was. She dove into work, and her career blossomed in the weeks and months after Lily left, and she was away from home more than ever. Covering the lead up to the Quidditch season along with the wizarding world’s sudden and revamped interest in muggle rugby, Ginny traveled to every match for the Scottish National Rugby Union. She offered for Harry to join her, but Harry could never understand the point of Rugby. It reminded him of the brutish violent ways of his cousin, Dudley, memories he would rather not relive.
Harry ripped himself from his thoughts and remembered the small journal he’d stuffed in his pocket. He still felt wary of the thing, remembering the dazed look in eleven-year-old Ginny’s eyes, messages written in blood on the walls. He shuttered.
Harry got down onto his knees with a groan and gathered the letters that were still strewn across the floor. He couldn’t really say why he left all of the parchment there, considering it was Snape who had strewn the contents of the still-open drawer so carelessly. He also couldn’t say why he spelled the door to Sirius’s room closed even when he’d already told his family not to go in there. He wanted this room to be exactly how they left it. How Sirius left it, and how Snape left it too. Harry looked through the papers in his hands, mainly letters and correspondences with other members of the order, and some older mementos from Hogwarts, including several Hogwarts letters and supply lists, which Sirius appeared not to throw out. He opened the first drawer in the desk and set the papers in there, on top of several similar-looking letters and memos. Harry then opened the next drawer down, which contained ink and several broken quills, some enchanted to write in rainbow, others to fix spelling and neaten handwriting. The ink pots were also broken, it was as if a tornado raged through the room, cracking glasses and spilling papers. Harry also found his Godfather’s  O.W.L scores along with graded essays and his N.E.W.T scores. One of the drawers was firmly stuck closed, and after Harry jostled it for a while throwing alohomora at it several times, it shot open to reveal a number of muggle porno magazines with motorcycles, bodacious women and shirtless men on the cover. At seeing that, Harry laughed with mirth he hadn’t felt in years, a twinkle coming back into his emerald eyes as he leafed through the graphic pages of the unmoving muggle images.
Something had shifted though, as his children departed one by one, year by year, to go off to have their own adventures at Hogwarts. Suddenly Harry didn’t have the excuse of a doting parent, he was left alone and isolated with his grief. And there was grief, heavy like a dark cloud of magic, billowing behind him like the veil in the department of mysteries. He felt it follow him around, and he didn’t like the sensation of it’s grasp. There was something inevitable about it.
After work, the house was devastatingly quiet, and expected or not, that made his head spin. He needed to get out, Ginny was right about that. Harry tried in vain to tidy his hair, then apparated to Hogsmede, right to the doorstep of the Hog’s Head. Neville and he had a pleasant evening and ran into Lavender Brown on a childish gallivant to Honeydukes, but Harry went home early to make the most out of his empty bed.
Ginny and Harry hadn’t touched the Black brother’s rooms in all these years, even when they had sent their sons to Hogwarts, and much more free time to spend on remodeling number 12 Grimmauld Place. Ginny and Harry just turned their attention to their daughter, showering Lilly with all the affection that they could muster. The house was now cheery, a representation of all the companionship that had inhabited it, covered in homely representations of their children’s personalities. It was a place made for children, for a married couple living their life. Ginny suggested that once Lily left for Hogwarts, they would have the time and the motivation to finally approach the two rooms hidden away, and in the moment Harry agreed. Harry didn’t consider that Lily going to Hogwarts was actually ever going to happen, but this past September, there they were, a little family unit pushing Lily’s trolley, dropping all three of their children off at Kings Cross station.
Below this inscription two signatures appeared as if they were being written; the letters carved out carefully into the leather, one in dark black ink that stills shone brightly, the signature below it was more faded-as if the leather on which it was written was worn away.
“Yes, Harry. We’re in the drawing room.” Harry could sense the notes of frustration in her voice, as she raised it for him to hear. Still, he was stuck to the floor and didn’t wish to tell his feet to move. He felt like an obstinate and desperate teen all over again.
“That’s the spirit Pete! Never let studying rule your life… Your grades are really determined by the stars anyway… at least that’s what my nan said before I went to school!” James said, mirth woven into his every syllable. Harry was so overwhelmed at seeing him, not through pictures or memories, but seeing him almost in real-time. It was brilliant. He felt so free, like he was untouched by war and by sorrow. He was looking at his father. At Sirius. At Lupin. He could live without seeing poor Wormtail though. Harry still felt conflicted at seeing those beady little blue eyes.
Harry had no idea what to think. He loved Hogwarts. It was his home. But then again, there was everything there that reminded him of Lupin and Tonks and Fred… Was it worth the pain of being reminded of everyone that he hadn’t saved?
“Yes, yes. I’m fine.” He turned, to see his wife’s inquisitive brown eyes ponder what he had just said, before settling on stubborn disbelief in his former statement.
The door to number 17 opened and a handsome, dark-haired wizard took one look at the panicked man on his doorstep and pulled him inside, taking his freezing hand to steady him, ensuring that he would not fall over.
As Harry continued to perseverate over his missed appointments and Hermione’s badgering, he stretched and took a moment to swing his stockinged feet up onto the bed. He laid back onto the opulently embroidered red pillow. As he set his head down he felt something hard against his occipital bone. The pillow was thin, and beneath it he distinctly felt something flat and solid. Harry pushed himself up and picked up the pillow, tossing it to the other side of the bed. There was nothing there, nothing but the candy-striped bed sheets. But, when Harry probed his hand around where the pillow had been, he felt the hard, square object again. He pulled his hand away and watched as the air rippled around where it had just been. The air rippled, and he smelt burnt magic, like scorched water and oil, as he reached out and picked up what appeared to be an invisible, small book. Harry reached into his jeans and got out his wand, tapping it against the book, muttering
Thirdly, you will provide to the Great Hall and stay after for instructions regarding your final year of magical education.” Mrs. Weasley paused again “And that's all, including a packing list…”
“Aced the last one without studying- he did… Why should he mess with the formula?” Sirius said with a barking laugh, winking at one of the girls who was staring at him across the room. She blushed and looked down, tucking her feathered hair behind her ear.
Harry shut the small journal, and watched, entranced, as it gleamed dully in his hands. There was embroidery delicately worked into the front cover, but the back was smooth and worn. There was a chord of leather attached at the spine that tied the little journal shut. It was untied when Harry had first found it, the cord hanging from the spine, enchanted to not be lost. Harry tried to tie the book closed, but it didn’t let him, the string of leather rebelling against his fingers and knotting to itself to keep the book open to his hands. He sighed and gave up, opening it to the first page. On the leather binding, words slowly appeared in that same looping writing, etching into the material like it was being written in that very moment.
His owl was rapping at the glass window to the left of his desk, and he startled as he looked around to see himself back in his study. He stood stiffly to go unlatch the window, letting the bird perch herself on the edge of the sill, looking at him expectantly. Harry took the letter and then tossed some of the bird feed in his pocket to the satisfied owl. She took off, leaving him alone with Hermione’s response.
The class was instructed to split up into pairs to complete the next assignment and as they were dismissed to rummage the storage cupboard mis v dodged through the students over to harry. she stared at him for a moment and signed heavily. draco was still sitting next to him furiously scribbling down the notes off the board, anticipating the scolding he was going to get after potter.
Harry accepted a delicate mug of tea which he insisted draco didn't put enough honey in and perched awkwardly on the edge of a chair. They were on the little wooden balcony that looked out at the forest, a small latch gate leading down petite stairs to a path on the left side. Hanging plants swung lazily from the gutter and a fat white cat had come out to join them. He and draco stared intently at the hour glass on the table, avoiding eye contact and otherwise ignoring each other. Draco pulled up a seat, quite intentionally but subtly, away from Harry and sat down with his own mug. The cat rubbed its face against his thigh and gracefully swung its body onto his lap.
Harry yelled his greetings to Ginny who was in her chair struggling with history of magic homework and threw his satchel at his room, watching it bounce into the laundry closet instead. Luna Released him and bounced down the wooden steps onto the tame lawn, turning in time to watch as Harry tripped on the lip of the dorway and fell down the stairs, rolling ungracefully. He came to a stop on his back looking up at the sky. It was just gone dusk, the clouds were tinged pink and orange and he spent a moment just gazing at them. He didn't feel embarrassed around Luna, she was busy picking grass and dropping it onto his head. No, he thanked Merlin Ginny hadn't seen him do that just then. The merciless minutes of teasing he would have had to endure had she bared witness to that tumble.
“Yeah, me too,” he shifted the bag on his shoulder and started towards the flowers, “were almost out at home. You use them for tea?” Harry looked back at Draco, waiting for an answer.
Draco held his arm out again, “need a hand?” he asked stupidly. Harry studied him, his hand still down the back of his jacket, and then a tired or fed up look washed over his face and he gripped dracos wrist. His hands were wet and cold and rough like draco had imagined, and at the memory he felt himself blush. What an idiot.
it was annoying actually, coping harry's notes. He kept flipping between pages to try to stay on top of the work mis v was slapping on the chalkboard while allowing Malfoy to write down what he'd missed. Draco felt mildly superior with his parchment roll, he wouldn't have this problem if Harry had just stuck to good old wizard schooling equipment. but draco also found it a little.. kind, perhaps, for want of a better word, that harry was clumsily making an effort to lend a hand.
“You're soaking,” ginny said rather unnecessarily. Harry had just walked in the door, closely trailed by draco. They dumped their coats and shoes in the front entrance in a heap and bumbled into the kitchen. The house was still toasty inside, and it smelt of the brew luna made for bed. Harry spied the pot sitting on the stovetop and hummed appreciatedly. He ignored ginny.
“I suppose we could be friends,” harry started, looking somehow comfortable with the situation. He opened his mouth to say something else, draco itched to hear it, leant in almost, but harry looked away chewing on the inside of his cheeks. Draco nodded slowly and stepped away, their proximity suddenly feeling uncomfortable. harry continued walking and draco tailed after him, not sure what friends really, truly meant for them. Did it mean they would hang out at lunchtime at school? Study together in the library during their spares? Go on more walks in the forest, brew potions together? Chat and function around one another without qualifiers? It all felt so uncertain to draco, he could feel himself slipping into a maze of thoughts.
Draco hummed appreciatively at Harry, noting the stubble on his chin that made him look rugged and the loose hairs that escaped his hair tie. He was very attractive. Draco tore his eyes away and stirred the lentils. He pulled out his nicer bowls from the cupboard.
The person closest to Harry was a young man; small, stocky, and had a thick head of mousey dirty blonde hair, and was laughing at something the others had said. Slowly Harry’s vision cleared so he could see the others. Peter Pettigrew was surrounded by his three friends, and Harry got a distinct pain in his chest and behind his eyes as he realized that he was staring at his father. His father, who was handsome and reminiscent of Harry at 16, though his unruly hair fit his devilish face better, and his twinkling brown eyes were sweet and sharp at the same time. Harry felt his eyes sting and a wave of worry moved over him, his father was looking through him, it was as if he could reach out and touch them. The stinging behind his eyes at the sight of his father suddenly was overtaken by a feeling of absolute joy and acceptance, and also grueling physical pain. It almost made Harry double over, and want to rech. It felt like his bones were aching, like they’d been taped together with spellitape after being blown to smithereens. It wasn’t his pain, and it wasn’t his joy, but it felt extremely real. Harry pulled his attention back to the group of young men in front of him, trying to ignore the searing pain in his body, and that’s when he noticed a young Lupin sitting on the sofa across from James and Peter.
He slept like a baby all night, and the dreams that usually woke him so consistently stopped their attack, letting Harry dissolve into the warm covers of his king size mattress.
The flush of the morning painted a peaceful patchwork of light over the dresser, casting long shadows of the thin wire spectacles and worn book it was placed on the faded oak. The dawn had not yet touched the boy sleeping on the spare cot next to the bed. His hair was in a complete state of disarray, dark locks long compared to the length it was usually kept, scattered about the pillow in an unpredictable pattern. His quizzical and humorous green eyes shut and unwrinkled, the ebony lashes flickering as if mid-dream, tranquil within their fluttering movement. Harry Potter’s complication was tanner than usual, after days of sunbathing and playing quidditch in the clearing by the burrow, he was sporting a soft tinge of brown that was not there within the winter months.
Oliver’s words were soft and spoke to a desire to listen to Harry, instead of formalities. Harry forgot that when he was away from the Scotsman for long enough, that Oliver wasn’t cordial or polite, instead he was shockingly vulnerable. It must have been something Wood developed after Hogwarts, as his motivating and manic pre-game speeches were devoid of the remarkably present and disarming affection within his voice. Deep down in his chest, Harry felt the purring of the monster that lived there, who was calmed and seduced by Oliver’s very presence.
He could hear the beginnings of a whispered conversation behind him and felt two pairs of eyes on his back before he disappeared into the burrow.
“Alright, Harry?” He said, standing from the sofa. Ginny had picked out that sofa right after they got married. She liked the paisley pattern. Harry didn’t argue but he was immediately reminded of Birthdays spent at Mrs. Figg’s house, covered in cat hair and patterns. Harry didn’t like to question his fiery wife, and most of the things in this room and those around it were chosen by her. He assumed that she would know more of what was comfortable, and the end result did remind him of the everlasting comfort of the Burrough.
“Harry!? I have to leave. Are you coming down?” There was more frustration now, her voice was simmering with impatience. Harry then remembered that she had to go do an interview with the newest beater for the Holyhead Harpies, who had switched over from the Tutshill Tornados earlier that year. Harry still didn’t want to move.
Harry couldn’t help but smile at the opulence of his godfather’s signature, the balance of sweeping style and a loose carelessness. He remembered that handwriting from letters he had gotten, and from the letters he had pulled out of the dresser drawers today. Its broad strokes were balanced against that of his former professors, which was tight and well thought out. He could see Sirius's large, elegant hand sweeping over the parchment, and Lupin’s careful, long fingers clutching the quill doing the same, just with more intention and thought. The dark cloud hovering in his mind throbbed at the memory of the two men sitting next to each other at the table, Remus watching Sirius, monitoring him with a careful gaze, ready to speak some soft words to calm Sirius's frightful passion and irritability. Harry didn’t know what to make of this diary, he found its presence in the room fascinating, especially that it was so well hidden. He was at once immensely curious, and cautious. It was strange that all of the pages were blank besides the dates, and it was clearly not meant to be found. He didn’t have any time to consider it though, as Ginny was now calling for him, and he couldn’t make out the words. Harry slipped the small book into the pocket of his unclasped robes and trotted down the stairs.
The one thing the summer was good at was settling things. After Hermione’s unexpected arrival, Harry began to feel like a third wheel. Admittedly a loved and tolerated third wheel, but whenever he got the chance, he would leave the two to talk and be more than friends.
Harry uncovered toadstools and cigarettes and empty bottles of rum as he took apart the room, starting at the desk and then moving to the dresser and the open cabinets full of muggle records next to the archaic record player stuffed into the corner. He looked at faded record art of Bowie and Queen and Elton John, Black Sabbath, and Pink Floyd along with some alternative bands Harry didn’t recognise. Harry loved  imagining Sirius turning up the noise to irk his mother and father, blasting angsty glam rock through the walls of Grimmauld Place. He made sure to put back the muggle music in order, so that it preserved the feel of the room. He still couldn’t really imagine remodeling it, for now he was simply tidying it up, distancing it in some way from the unruly nature of Sirius’s existence.
“What is it Gin?” He called down after him, turning corners and coming to a halt at the base of the stairs.
Ever since Harry had graduated from Hogwarts, he and Dudley had slowly made amends, and every other month they would meet up at the same muggle cafe and discuss their children, and their lives. Somehow, these interactions never felt forced, instead, it was like Harry and Dudley found a certain refuge in one another, having been raised in two different versions of the same abusive household. Dudley would often share the advice his therapist had given him that week and Harry took comfort in knowing that Dudley too came out of Number 4 Privet Drive with his own set of scars. Not that this was a nice thing to contemplate, but it gave Harry peace of mind to have contact with the reformed version of his former tormentor. Maybe this was why his mind was so constantly bugged by the unresolved Malfoy situation. He had never given the pointy git any chance of redemption, it pulled at his memories and made Harry much more sympathetic towards anyone displaying bullying behavior. It was possible these people would turn into reformed versions of themselves given the resources.
under his breath. The shimmering air covering it quickly dissipated, the glamour running off the small bound book like water, and revealing it to Harry’s expectant emerald eyes.
Lupin was sitting next to Sirius, and Harry’s heart, beneath this extra pain that felt foreign in his body, Harry’s heart gave a lurch at seeing his godfather as a young man. Sirius’s face was glowing, and he was devastatingly handsome. Curling waves of dark hair perfectly framed his angular and giddy face, giving way to his bare neck and which sloped into defined shoulders and a lean body. He was wearing dark wash jeans and a t-shirt, and seemed absolutely free. He was the only boy not wearing the school uniform, but he seemed to revel in his difference, in his carefree ways. Sirius had his arms slung up onto the couch, dark eyes roaming around the room, making anyone looking at him blush. Lupin seemed demure next to him, and Harry was immediately drawn to his face. He was, like Sirius and James and Peter, full of mirth and rosy happiness, but Harry watched and saw a certain gingerly way he held himself, as if he could shatter into a million pieces. Like he was held together by unreliable stitches, ready to be undone at any moment. Sirius’s eyes stopped roaming the room and focused on Lupin. His hand moved swiftly and with a  nondescript motion slipped off the couch to gently tousle Lupin’s curly hair.
“I’m not so sure.. I might try James’ method this time round.” The stocky blonde squeaked, looking sheepishly up at James to see his proud smile. There was little resentment in his face, despite the jab at his intelligence.
he waved the percolator at Ginny and raised an eyebrow, asking silently if she needed a second cup, then fought off a yawn and missed the answer. He filled it up any way and threw it on the stove lighting the gas.
“I resent that accusation,” draco protested, leaning forward tediously to set his glass down on the little coffee table. He flopped back half into Harry's lap and tried not to look sulky. His shoulder was pressed against something hard under Harry's sweater, he slid off his lap and reached out to touch the form through the fabric. "What's this?" He asked, forgetting the stupid show playing nonchalantly in the background.
“ill walk you to the apparition point,” he said. Thinking better of the mug, harry picked it up and walked it over to the sink in the kitchen where he quickly rinsed it out. Draco waited for him at the front door slipping into his coat and slinging his bag over his shoulder. He handed harry his jacket and they stepped outside, the door closing with a soft click behind them.
The potions had to be left to simmer for an hour, which was why they were a homework task. their lessons were only fifty minutes. Draco thanked Morgana for that, he wasn't sure if he could survive any longer with the potions master. Or perhaps it was simply the classroom he didn't like. He had made a few acquaintances whom he could rely on to pass him the work he missed, all local kids which made up the bulk of students at school, but draco couldn't bring himself to do anything more with these people, he wasn't sure if he could call them friends and therefore didn't do any friend activities with them. He went on his walks alone and bought single discounted student tickets at the cinema and lived by himself. He had his cat, Brenton, who spent most of its days sleeping on draco's bed. Sometimes it would join him foraging out in the forest, chasing after the insects, but that was the most physical activity it seemed capable of.
Ginny snickered at them, groaning her comfort into Luna's side. “We should get going,” she mumbled, “i'm going to fall asleep here.”
Dracos nose was almost numb, the night was cold and dark, the moon hidden behind thick clouds. He could see lights from neighboring houses a dozen or so yards away, dim and warm. The street was light by a few scattered streetlamps attracting moths, draco thought he saw a bat fly through collecting insect snacks. It was peaceful outside, the gravel of harry and ginny and lunas drive crunching underfoot.
"No, yes I mean, yeah we should uh," draco looked at him and their eyes met, he was very red, "we should go out."
"No, I suppose i don't go out very often," draco confessed quietly. Harry picked out a note of sadness and his grin slipped. It was understandable actually now that Harry looked at him. What with the trials and his father and the press's vicious attack on his family, dracos sharp, pale and pointy features stuck out. Harry knew the glances and the stairs and the whispers better than anyone, and he knew how hard it was to look past it all. Draco had always been weak to the public's susception of him, he was weak to alot of things. Harry felt cruel for even thinking that.
Ginny shoved past Draco gracelessly and launched herself onto Harry's back, grappling him to the ground in a tangle of limbs. Harry yelled out as ginny shoved a wet handful of moss down the back of his shirt and squirmed on the ground under her weight in distress. Luna gazed at them a little confused and walked around, continuing down the path. Ginny saw her and sprung to her feet, chasing after luna and grabbing her hand swinging it theatrically. She had wet patched down the arm of her hoodie and along the side of her leg.
"you heard her, help me catch up.'' Harry pulled a hairband off his wrist and held it in his teeth, gathering his hair behind his head. He tied it off in a really shit bun and rolled his shoulders. Then he caught dracos eye and jerked, his eyes widening, "i mean, you don't have to if you don't want to, you don't owe me anything.." he trailed off.
He made his way over to the roses, careful not to stand on anything that might be a herb, he didn't want to disturb their secret little sanctuary. He stopped to inspect some mushrooms, their little pink caps stood out, almost glowing in the dim lighting immediately outside the clearing. It was strange the sudden difference in temperature as well, there were more bugs too hidden away in the shade of the forest.
Harry sat under the spray of the shower, he dug his thumbs into his eyelids and hugged his knees to his chest. What had he been thinking? He shouldn't have let Malfoy do that, he should have turned away sooner, he should have left when he first said he would. He should never have sought out to inflict karma, he shouldnt have done his potions assignment with a fucking death eater, he should have just ignored malfoy from the start. Maybe then everything would be alright.
"I thought you were staying at malfoys?" Ginny said. She was scrubbing hard at the bottom of a pot that she’d burnt risotto too. It was no small feat, when ginny cooked something always went wrong but somehow the food came out alright fifty percent of the time.
"don't throw it out. I'll plant some chives in there," Harry mumbled, wiping his hands cautiously on his pants before fishing the pottery out of the trash to place gently on the windowsill next to the other herbs he had growing there, most in actual pots. "also i wont go blind, i'm already blind, and mollys are just being theatrical."
He figured she would take him through the forest, or maybe down to the market, was it a date? No, it couldn't be, perhaps she thought they were friends. They were certainly friend
“I'm having a shower, last calls for the loo,” he yelled, pulling his flannel shorts out from the bed frame where they had been wedged. Ginny yelled something affirmative back at him and he stepped into the bathroom, casting a warming spell. The tiled floors were always cold in there. Luna had mushrooms growing in jars next to the bathtub stuck to the walls, they were looking a little sad but neither of them knew how to properly cultivate mushrooms so they were just hoping they might perk up. Harry stripped and kicked his clothes into the corner where they wouldnt get wet and turned the shower on. He examined his body in the mirror while the water heated up, there was nothing special about him. He had a few scars here and there, the gash that ran up his forearm from wrist to elbow pit hadnt healed nicely at all and was still waxy and puckered even after all these years. He thought of malfoys wrist, how it was marked in a similar way but with the curling black ink of a terrible mark. He had caught a glimpse of it earlier, when malfoy rolled his sleeves up to do the dishes after dinner. It had stunned him for some reason, still so vibrant and dark, the mark hadnt faded at all. He had been expecting it to dull, after his death and the years that had passed, he thought it might fade even a little. But there it was, cruel and harsh and black as ever. It disgusted harry.
Harry was sitting at his kitchen bench, which doubled as Draco's dining table and desk, looking about uncertainty. draco felt self conscious, like he himself was under scrutiny.
But what to do with the one he had now? He could put it in a cup of water and keep it for a day or two, he could press it, but that often squished the colour from flowers. Draco considered these options seriously for a while, hunched over his kitchen bench cradling the dainty flower in his fingertips. He decided to dry it with a cleaver little spell he had picked up from his fourth year transfiguration book, spelling all the water from it so the flowers wouldn't lose their shape or colour.
Luna was still mumbling her nonsensical song, holding a finger out for the glowing bugs to land on. The sky was dark now and the air was closer to frosty than chilled, but Harry felt warm where his fingers rested on ginny's shoulders, her hands covering them, and he knew what fondness really was.
Jordan slid a hand over dracos thigh and squeezed it firmly. It was a form of nonverbal communication they’d developed. Some glances across the great hall during meals meant
Harry paused and looked at draco who turned to face him head on. Feeling bold draco took a step closer into his space, the puffs of breath he was making in the air falling just short of reaching him. Draco was taller than harry and it became more apparent at such a distance, harry had to tilt his chin upwards to look draco in the eye.
"it used to be our thing, the three of us on the couch! i introduced you two to it!" Harry exasperatedly explained, sitting straight and looking panicked. Ginny found it hysterical in her evil little way, giving him the look that roughly translated to
Harry was sitting on the floor with Brenton in his lap smoking another cigaroll when draco finally dared to go back outside. There was still a quarter of sand in the hourglass and he was feeling tired despite the afternoon sun. He just wanted to finish up quickly and have a sandwich and maybe a good wank and go to bed. But Harry was still there, invading his space and petting his cat, and Draco felt obliged to be at least civil. Draco offered Harry another tea which he turned down. Harry was no longer shaking or chanting, he looked content and lazy in the yellow glow and draco resented him for that, and the fond feeling he got in the pit of his stomach.
Harry dusted himself off and collected their mugs. He looked at Luna for a long moment. "Thank you," he said finally, "Luna, really."
“I know, gin, I killed him,” Harry whispered. His voice came out hoarse as his throat was tight, Harry had cried a little, thinking back to all of it. “It was just, shocking, seeing it right there in such a casual setting,” he picked at his nails and ginny reached out, holding his hands still to stop him, “makes you wonder how many other murderers have mooved on, whether there are death eaters out there, fucking i don't know, like gardening or something,” he breathed, feeling exasperated and tired.
"I mean, if you want to, " Draco tried filling the silence, "saves you the trip in the morning..." he was drumming his fingers on his thigh awkwardly. Harry watched his hands but he supposed draco must have thought he was looking somewhere else because he took in a sharp breath, "No, never mind, that's stupid-"
"Can I kiss you?" He spoke the words quietly, Harry didn't react. He was still watching draco, his expression mild terror or excitement, draco couldn't pick. Without any real thought he took a wild leap into the unknown and pulled Harry forward. Draco closed his eyes as their lips connected, warm and gentle against each other. Harry didn't move, he seemed frozen for a long moment that stretched out even further when draco tried to deepen the kiss, slipping his tongue into the heat of his mouth.
rain. The wind was almost absent and Harry and Luna had set out to weed at least one garden bed before it really went to shit. Ginny was at quidditch training, she had looked pleased about the weather when she had set off.
Ginny called out to him from her chair that his fly was undone when he got back to their living room. He did it up and sat on the couch, patting his lap for Ginny to join him. she threw herself onto him ungracefully, finally giving in and smooching his clean shaven face.
Harry shook his head, pulling his shirt up to wipe the dirt off his face. Draco didn't like him, “draco doesn't like me,” harry had a girlfriend, draco knew that, “i have a girlfriend, malfoy knows that,” and besides, harry was pretty sure draco was strait last he checked, “and i'm pretty sure the gits strait.”
meant anyone any harm, that his hand had been forced for the most part. And Harry thought he too had moved on, that he could maybe.. not forgive, but accept and understand better what draco had been going through back then. He resented Draco for that in a way, that he had been allowed to move on and pass off everything he had done as childhood mistakes. If he had been four or five  years older draco would be in for a prison sentence next to his father, but he had gotten lucky. Harry knew those were cruel and unfair thoughts, but old habits die hard as it turned out, and Harry was back to resenting and watching draco.
“I left my wand at home, we’ll just walk,” Harry shrugged, allowing Ginny to pull him to his feet. She pecked him on the cheek and took Luna's hand, disappearing with a crack. Harry looked at draco, still sitting on the ground relaxing into the sensation of being high. Harry had almost asked him to aparate them to the end of the trail, but on second thoughts that probably wasn't the best idea. He nudged draco with the toe of his boot gently and picked his bag up, slinging it over his shoulder. “Come on.”
Harry thought about malfoys cold wet kiss, and about how tender Ginny was. He didn't want to hurt her, or for her to think anything less of him, that he could just mouth off at draco for being a murdering death eater and then confess to letting draco kiss him. What a confusing contradiction. Harry left it as it was, he nodded into ginny's shoulder and she rubbed his back and laughed at him for being an idiot.
Draco watched harrys hands, nodding along to the nonsense Harry was spewing, "Sunday night? Sounds good" he said more confidently than he felt, "do you want a bandage?"
Luna nodded, swaying with the head motion, "Yes he's mentioned the cat, we're good friends in herbology class." Harry was sure she was exaggerating  the
“You prepared for the history exam tomorrow?” Harry asked, nudging luna who looked like she might fall asleep. She blinked up at him and pulled her scarf up around her throat, snuggling her face into Brenton's dirty furr. Draco was going to have to bathe the cat when he got home, he wasn't exactly looking forward to that task.
. Draco made a note to take brenton for a walk through the forest after school tomorrow, collect some rose petals from the late blooming kid bears roses he'd seen budding on his last walk. Harry had smelt like roses and coffee.
The knock came a second time and Draco frowned, scratching at a scab in his eyebrow. then something clicked in his head and he slipped into a bathrobe, museing at the time.
"Good morning lovegood," draco chimed quietly, his eyes flitting between the ditsy shoeless lady in front of him and the demonstration going on about correct re potting of venomous wormtail weed. Something gently brushed Draco's hand making him jump and yelp, turning a few heads in his direction embarrassingly. He looked down and saw luna trying to pass him a little stem of dainty blue flowers like some kind of organised drug deal. He wondered for a second if the flowers were a drug, but he'd seen them growing in the front of the school and decided they were probably safe.
Harry coughed and raised an eyebrow at her, considering his answer carefully. Luna had heart enough to ask about even Voldemort's health. "He seems lonely," Harry mused, looking to the back door as Ginny stomped her way outside, clearly frustrated beyond belief at her homework. She threw herself onto the grass in front of Harry and wiggled her fingers at him. Harry slid his hand into hers and squeezed it, but she slapped him away.
"Uh, west witches I suppose," Harry decided on humoring Draco's little whims, it was actually kind of amusing seeing him so flustered, such a change from the cocky little twat back at hogwarts. He sat up straighter in his chair and picked up his glass, "I usually just listen to triple j on the radio though."
"help potter catch up would you?" mis v sayd, leaving them to yell at myrtle for dropping a bottle of fly wings. Harry looked at malfoy and tried out a smile which looked more like a grimace. draco returned the look and rubbed his temples.
"When do you go out? I never see you out!" Harry laughed, and it was true. Draco was a rare sight out in public, much less in muggle streets. Harry wondered if he explored any other muggle areas.
. He knew one day it would become an issue, but for now Jordan didn't mind. He was far more mature than  he looked, he acted with careful measured movements and considered his words carefully. Draco mostly did the same, but his reasons for doing so came from a place of pride and malice while jordans came from genuine care for others and a good natured soul. They would never have matched well out in the open, observed by everyone, but separate to the world, the few stolen and understood moments they had together was a manageable amount of time draco was glad for. It provided some relief from the endless piles of stress that was building. He hoped one day he might get to be open about his sexuality, hold his partner's hand in public confidently, but for now this would have to make do.
“His names Brenton,” Draco said, petting the cat's head fondly. Harry tore his eyes from the sand and his features softened. The corners of his mouth turned upwards slightly and draco noticed his fingers twitch, like he was stopping himself from touching the cat.
“Draco is rather polite isn't he,” Luna said out of the blue, shucking grass seeds and nibbling on them. Ginny burst out a short laugh and Harry scoffed at her, then considered the statement for a moment and found himself in agreeance. He had been polite, all year at school Harry had observed this out of character behavior being displayed in the classes they shared. He had been polite and reasonable and he was a good potions teacher, not that he would ever admit that out loud to anyone.
Draco malfoy watched the cats chase each other across the little animal tracks they were walking on. He hunted through the foliage with his eyes for plants he recognised, he stared at the ground for roots and stones that night trip him up, he looked at luna when she spoke to him, at birds when they made sounds and little magical creatures as they went about their day. He looked everywhere except at harry, who was walking in front of him in his stupid jacket and stupid washed jeans with his hair tied up stupidly in a terrible bun. God draco thought he was stupidly gorgeous, the kind of effortless gorgeous that you see in people right after a shower, or in the rain, or at the beach.
Luna passed Harry the half smoked joint shed had stored behind her ear and he accepted it without a word. Draco watched him light it wandlessly, slightly disturbed with himself about the way that image made him feel, and when Harry breathed out thick bluish smoke he had to look away, feeling a little overwhelmed.
“What now?” Draco looked at him, still stirring rhythmically, “what did you do wrong?” he snapped his fingers at Harry and pointed to the chopped bore root which Harry handed to him.
Then Draco Malfoy walked into the room and looked around, apologizing to the teacher for his tardiness. she rolled her eyes and indicated to the empty seat next to harry that trinity usually sat in. she was skipping potions to play quidditch with ginny as she was actually on top of the workload. Draco hesitated a moment and made eye contact with Harry for a second, who was trying his hardest to look indifferent. After Draco's trial and all the shit that happened post war, his father in prison and his mother's move to France for some much needed mental rest, Harry and Draco had come to a mutual understanding- to treat each other like classmates, nothing more and nothing less. there were no more snippy comments  thrown here or witty spells flicked there. it was mutual ground to leave each other alone to complete their final years of schooling in relative peace and harmony.
"It literally just stopped raining twenty minutes ago," Ginny pointed out, taking the mug from Luna carefully. Luna always underestimated the amount of space needed for milk in tea and the resulting cup was often way too full. It didn't help either that Ginny over milked her brew, not that Harry would ever say anything about the matter, Ginny had several arguments he'd already heard about his over moneyed tea, and several more he hadn't heard Harry was sure.
"My day studying  with Malloy, he seems more… manageable than he used to be," Harry murmured, starting to feel both light and heavy from the drugs. He smiled to himself a little, "Malloy has a chubby cat called brendon or brenton or something."
"Hello draco," she greeted him cheerfully, slipping for a moment into humming that song. Draco observed Luna almost fearfully for a second while she sang, her back to pots who were looking quite mad while also trying to hold it together and teach the rest of the class. Luna was lucky she always did well on assessments.
Notably, Ron shot up out of bed, mumbling. Harry took longer to react, grabbing his glasses and making a valiant effort to untangle his legs from the blanket. As Harry stumbled around pulling on his socks, he heard Ron struggling with his shirt, the disgruntled house waking up in the background.
They talked of frivolous things, walking quickly until they reached the Weasley’s favorite picnic spot. Ginny stopped and asked to sit. Harry sat down and watched her silken hair flow in the slight breeze.
On the bed opposite lay a freckly young man whose ginger hair was short compared to his bespectacled friend. His own cheeks were showing the time spent in the sun, freckles multiplying and covering his cheeks as he and his best friends relaxed after the war. Well deserved rest, they began the assimilation into natural life, slowly letting go of the nightmares and strategic planning and moving towards calm and relaxing summertime. Ron slept shirtless, a habit he had picked up this very summer, due to the new warm during the night. Harry laughed at Ron when Hermione had arrived in the middle of the night, returning from giving back her parent’s memories and spending half of the summer with them and then moving to the Burrow for the rest. She accomplished waking them all up by flooding into the living room from the fireplace with a loud clatter of precariously stacked items. Everyone had rushed downstairs, wands at the ready, to find Hermione blushing and repairing a broken sneakoscope. She got a huge hug from everyone except Ron, whose ears turned beat red at being shirtless in front of her. Harry had the best laugh in a while as Ms. Weasley reprimanded her son for exposing herself and Hermione blushed and in the most un-Hermione like way, giggled.
Sirius had not found the need to turn on the light and simply listened to the patter of rain as the night progressed. Even as Remus shivering sobs slowly decreased and he became a slumbering weight against Sirius’s shoulder, and then, he shifted and rested his head on Sirius’ lap. Sirius could not bring himself to fall asleep and succumb to the possibility that he would be unavailable in Remus’s time of need. He always knew that Remus would be there for him in the same fashion.
A shudder went down Harry’s spine as he felt the ghost of his godfather’s fingers tousle his own hair, and a warmth spread through his body, the pain forgotten for a moment. Young Lupin sighed, and Sirius quickly removed his hand from Lupin’s hair and picked up a conversation with James.
