to do the impossible and break the sacred Malfoy code. Technically, he had already done that by being in a relationship with Potter anyway. Lucius couldn’t judge him more if he tried.
“That’s a lot of words for you to say, isn’t it, Weasley?” Draco arched an eyebrow and pulled back to sit down on his chair again. He folded his arms over his chest. All of this was rather suspicious and he sure as hell wanted to know why. It wasn’t normal for Weasley to
you are here! Merlin, how dense are you really?” The last part was said in a rather low voice, even though it shouldn’t be in a low voice, Weasley deserved to know just how incredibly daft he was…!
Because talk they would. Once Weasley went home to his sad little flat, Draco sure as hell had several things to say to Potter.
“Plus, Harry’s away because he’s
“See, you will have an address like this too,” Harry said brightly, touching the computer screen with his index finger. It was going to leave a dirty print that Draco would have to spell away later.
computer. Ozzy was in his lap too, and Weasley hadn’t objected or pushed the cat away. That was surprising, actually, and Draco couldn’t help but wonder what Granger would do if she saw that. He knew very well that Weasley hadn’t been very fond of that giant ball of ginger fur--Harry had told him all the stories.

“Where are you going?” Draco mumbled as Harry placed his feet on the soft carpeted floor.

The computer was Harry's pre-Christmas gift to Draco, and he was clearly very pleased. His emerald eyes twinkled like a child's as he showed Draco the desktop with all the little icons, saying over Draco's head that he wanted to set up the email address right away. He said it to
Among the numerous families returning to Britain, the one people were most looking forward to seeing and gossiping about were the Malfoy’s. But they would be most disappointed to find out that during January 1996, their heir wasn’t present to be sorted.
From 2:00 am to 4:00 am, the DMLE was alerted of strange magical fluctuations in Wiltshire, specifically in and around Malfoy Manor.
“That’s the one.” said Neville.
In a completely different world, in a completely different time, Nico was getting summoned into the his father’s realm.
Draco laughed. “I guess in a way you’re not wrong, the house elves at the Manor usually did everything. I only really learned these skills in case I have children. I want to be able to provide for them, in a more personal way than house elves.”
“One is a protection charm,” Draco pointed to a charm in the bracelet that looked like a mini wand, “I used to ward my room at the Manor when the Da- when Voldemort lived there so I modified the spell to encase anyone who wears it in a protective bubble. It obviously won’t stop thinking like the Killing Curse, but spells with harmful intent with be slowed down if not completely stopped. This one charm,” Draco touched a moon charm, “is an anti-love spell/potion charm, for that one I had to do a bit of research; I took the properties of an antidote and inserted them into the charm, it was a bit complicated getting it to work in that type of metal but in the end I figured it out. Another one is an anti-portkey; you won’t be able to use a portkey unless you actively want it. This one lets you send me a small message any time you want.”
Nico didn’t know what to think. Nothing really made senses but somehow, he felt for Draco. He understood the death of a mother too well.
He finally departed from his parents and went to look for Pansy. Ever since she had joined Hogwarts during January, she had bombarded him with letters about gossip and the so-called important details of Hogwarts, such as who was dating who, who had presented as what, etc. thinking he would care.
Finally locating his parents Draco said, “It’s time we leave, I want to see if I can find Pansy before we board the train.”
also if any of you have any ideas abt courtship gifts pls lmk im out of ideas....
“I- er- of course, I’ll see you there.”
“I guess this is another yearly goodbye.” Draco said as he started gesturing to the train.
“What does it say, then?” Ron piped in, “another desperate girl wanted a courting gesture from you, mate?”
“Just distracted thinking, eh, Harry?” said Ginny and they all started laughing.
The news of their relocation comes just one day after the Greengrass family announced the dissolution of the marriage agreement between young Astoria Greengrass and Draco Malfoy. (For speculations as to the reason, see page 7)
“There’s a boy, his name is Draco Malfoy. He, for a lack of a better word, is like my surrogate son. When he was small, I worried that the prophecy regarding Percy would be about him. So, I sent him away to protect him.”
We have to speculate, as we know the Malfoy Manor now houses the Malfoy family and before the most current dark war, Sr. Malfoy was an avid dark wizard and supported of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. Were the Malfoy’s performing a dark ritual? Were they trying to resurrect He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named?
Draco started to take out the things from the basket, passing them to Harry. When passing a container to him, their fingers brushed. “Try them.”
Things with Malfoy had been awkward to say the least. They had silently agreed to put their rivalry behind them but well, it was awkward being neutral with someone who has been such a big constant in your life.
Getting things ready for his first outing with Harry was easy enough. He had decided something simple would do. Private and secluded to give him and Harry time to talk and get used to each other. While Draco knew he wasn’t in love with Harry, he hoped he could grow fond of him. While Draco was, in a way using Harry to benefit his reputation, he wanted for both of them to end happy. If everything went according to plan, Draco would be having babies for Harry and he’d much rather raise a baby with someone he loved than with someone he merely tolerated for his own gain.
Harry glanced down the table at Ginny. He quickly looked back to Ron, “You know I’m not really ready for that.”
I miss him every day. I can’t help but to regret that we ever sent him away. I remember the look of betrayal when I told him he would be going away. He was only seven and I don’t think he really understood the necessity we saw in it. He told me I was leaving him just like his mother did. It broke my heart but I did what I thought was right.
Draco quickly discarded that idea. He knew he was amazing and he didn’t need anyone else to realize that. Plus seeing how dense Potter was made him think it would take Potter ages to realize his intentions.
“Hey, Harry, now that that war is over and everything’s settled down, when are you gonna start courting someone?”, asked Ron, “I know that Ginny’s been hoping that you’ll initiate courting with her.”
Ever since he had seen how much of a madman and a monster Voldemort was, Draco had decided then and there that he would not win. Not because Draco himself would do anything to prevent it, mind you he still wanted to survive and going against Voldemort while he had to live with him just spelled trouble for him, but simply because the order of the world would not allow it. Voldemort was vile and evil and the magic in the world would not stand for it and since that crucial moment, Draco started to plan for the inevitable.
Hades was quick to shut that line of thinking down, “No. He’s Zeus kid. I think that apart from us three and Draco himself, no one knows that Zeus has another kid.”
Sometime later, after the plates had been cleared away, Persephone decided to start explaining.
“Uh, no one! I was just distracted thinking.” Harry said, slowly looking back towards the platform. He saw that the blonde guy was no longer with his parents where he had seen them before, so he started searching with his gaze for him, out of pure curiosity.
When almost all their food was over, only strawberries covered in chocolate were left. Harry felt, in a way, closer to Draco. They had talked about their childhoods and how it affected them now as almost adults. They talked about their plans for after Hogwarts, both of them not being sure about what to do now that they had survived a war. What Harry liked the most though, was that even though they were on a date, even though they were participating in a courting, they could still challenge each other. They were still snarky and outspoken as ever with each other. It kept things fresh.
If anyone is interesed, this is the ring that draco wants to give to harry,,, its gay ik... http://www.ricardobasta.com/rings/red-sapphire-and-emerald-eye-snake-ring
During the years he done his fair share of Potter watching and while he wasn’t anywhere near close to being friends with him, he’d learn many things about him, things he thought not even Granger or Weasley knew about their friend.
” behavior, and well, Draco was never above abusing instincts.
They walked a couple more meters into the forest until the finally came upon a clearing. For the second time in one night, Harry felt his breath get caught. All around the clearing, small multicolored light orbs floated giving the space a hazy, lovely feeling of peace. In the middle of the clearing was a white blanket with a basket off to the side of it. Draco let go of his hand (Harry immediately missing the warmth of it) to walk to the blanket. “Why don’t you sit?”
As we have previous reported here in previous articles, the Malfoy Heir, Draco, is what here we would consider a prodigy. At a young age Draco had showed enormous intelligence, when he improved various spells and potions.
anyways you ever read your own story and ur like damn…. wish the author would update this fic.. but that’s you…. me… i have to write more if i want to read more LMAO so i’m back… after like a year TEEHEE anyways i’ve read all ur comments and i have taken into account some of the gift ideas so they might be reflected in this chapter or in later chapters
Draco stared at his reflection. Deciding to drop the enchantments, he watched as straight blonde hair became a touch wavier, as his eyes turned from boring grey to electrifying silver, as his pale skin became a bit more rosy and lively.
Sometimes, with much difficulty, Harry could admit that maybe, living with the Dursleys had changed something in him. He wasn’t as confrontational as almost all alphas, he wasn’t as possessive of his friends, he wasn’t as ruled by his “alpha” instincts as he had seen some people be. Harry had different instincts, more caring and nurturing. In the war he’d force himself to play the role that everyone expected of him, and while yes protectiveness and courage were still in his genes, he’d like to think that over aggressiveness wasn’t. Harry thought he’d make a better beta.
Hi guys, Im posting this hoping at least someone will read it and tell me if this is a story you guys would be interested in. Ive been reading drarry and the percy jackson universe at the same time and this story came to mind. I was debating between percy and nico being the one to bring back draco but in the end picked nico. If I get any positive feedback ill definitely put more time into this!
Witch Weekly, April 1996
“I could see that. I hadn’t really thought about how purebloods would be raised.”
Hades and Persephone looked at each other, having an entire conversation with just their eyes.
So Lucius relented, but he taught Draco how to behave like an alpha. He once overheard a conversation between his parents and what his dad said stuck with him for a long time after. “Draco has already disappointed us by not being an alpha, the least he could do is act like one.”
He hadn’t expected that, oh the Great Savior Harry Potter himself would testify in his behalf. If he was honest with himself, saving Potter at the Malfoy Manor had been more about self-preservation than anything else but if the wizarding world and Potter wanted to believe it was due to his change of heart, well he wouldn’t correct them.
“We could always ask Hecate to send him into her weird magic realm,” the woman said, “he’s smart, I’m sure he’ll pick things up soon, when he’s already mastered so many of his powers. It won’t be forever; we’ll bring him back soon enough.”
He was startled out of his thought by someone clearing their throat. He noticed most people in the Great Hall had gone quiet. He looked up, to see Draco looking down at him. “Harry.” And wow, hearing his name come out of Draco Malfoy’s mouth was sure something. “I’d like it if you could meet me outside the Great Hall on Saturday, at 7.” Harry felt his face become hot. Having Draco look at him felt intense in a way he hadn’t felt before.
He was a bit puzzled as to what someone was sending him. If he didn’t know any better, he would think it was a wedding ring. It was a very pretty ring, two golden snakes with green eyes made of emeralds, both biting a very red ruby inside a velvet box. He took the ring out and twirled it around, inspecting it and discovering his own family crest on it alongside another one he knew too well. The Malfoy family crest. He saw a note attached to the wrapping paper he had previously ignored but before he could start reading it, Hermione spoke up.

Harry sighed, he had known that Ron would react like this but he hadn’t been there, rebuilding Hogwarts and seeing how Draco behaved, how he shied away from people, in what Harry thought, was shame. “You don’t understand, Ron. But to me, he seems like he’s changed.”
“He can’t stay here,” she said, her eyes softening when she looked at the small, sleeping, seven-year-old, “once they discover who his dad is, they will force him into this war that he shouldn’t fight.”
Upon entering he turned and looked into the mirror.
In that moment, he decided that, if not friends they could well be acquaintances.
While he walked around the castle, he pondered if his plan had worked. By letting Potter see him as more human, needing help, maybe he would decide to forgive him.
“Who do we know that owes us a favor? Someone that could make this easier?”
(See the end of the chapter for
He finally found her lingering next to some skinny wiry guy, who looked around their age. From his look and the various long descriptive letters of her friends, he could guess it was some pureblood named Theodore Nott, who she had taken a liken to. She claimed it wasn’t a replacement for him, but he wasn’t quite sure he believed her.
“What are the spells?” Harry asked. Harry knew that Draco was right, many omegas wore jewelry when they were being courted and the little kid in him was preening about being gifted anything. It made him feel worth something.
Debating with himself as to whether he should get out of bed or go back to sleep, he eventually decided to shower and get an early start on his day.
At 6:50, Harry was outside the Great Hall. Since it was prime dinner time, a lot of students kept throwing glances at him.
They all looked at him. No, they all seem to be thinking.
He was in Harry's arms still, unwilling to move. It was far too comfortable and far too warm, despite everything. Draco thought he had perfected the art of self-control, but there were some things that his self-control didn't seem to work on at all. One of them spelt H-a-r-r-y P-o-t-t-e-r, and that was fucking infuriating. Draco wanted to hate himself, but he was far too tired for that right now. He yawned in Harry's face before resuming to stare angrily at him.
Harry’s first thought was to put some space between them, though when he saw the peaceful look on Draco’s face, he quickly changed his mind. Truth be told, if Harry thought about it, it had been sort of cosy when Draco’s head had been on his shoulder and having him so close as he was now… That was cosy, too; he couldn’t deny that. More cosy, even.
"Yeah, I'd really like it if you could learn how everything works properly," Harry said, leaning close to kiss Draco on the nose. He took Draco's free hand, intertwining their fingers. "So you can tell me all about your day when I'll be far away, and I can tell you about mine. You know, going away is going to be incredibly boring. I'm gonna miss you."
Okay, truth be told, he was, perhaps, addicted to it. There was a slight chance that might be the case.
might know
Draco handled his potions ingredients expertly, cutting them neatly and throwing them into the cauldron like it was nothing. Why was everything he did so…
"Yeah, thanks for coming over, Ron," Harry said, giving Weasley a smile.
“About Potter,” Draco continued, almost smugly because he’d been right. “Tell me, Weasley, what the hell is going on?”
“I do,” Harry agreed quietly.
lightingbolt80(at)maildotcom
Harry’s fantasies had been crushed the minute Draco got frustrated with him. It had taken ages to convince the man to sit down by the computer in the first place, and then he didn’t like when Harry wanted to go through every letter of the alphabet and where they were placed on the keyboard. He also didn’t want to practice how to turn the computer on and off or learn how to navigate the desktop. Not even when Harry told him he could get a picture taken with Harry’s camera of Midnight, Dante and Ozzy to use as a background on his computer made Draco excited to learn.
Draco had tried to find out what Zabini was doing on Christmas and Pansy. Turned out they were doing each other, so that was a new type of information that Draco didn’t really need. Apparently hanging out with Potter and—very reluctantly—Potter’s friends led to him falling out with his former Slytherin associations. Not entirely, because he was still seeing them from time to time and Blaise had been over at Draco’s for tea just recently, but he clearly wasn’t updated on everything they did anymore. He wrinkled his nose, some information he’d been glad of not knowing.

As much as Draco hated to admit it, perhaps Weaselbee wasn’t so bad after all.

“Mm, what the hell indeed. Careful, so I don’t tell you all swear words I know in one long breath. I can do it, you know.”
“About what?” Weasley asked, narrowing his eyes too. Though the blush slowly forming on his cheeks and neck told Draco that he might be onto something.
Harry’s eyes widened in surprise. He turned to Snape and opened his mouth to object, but Draco was the one who spoke first. “Excuse me, professor—”
Harry only had eyes for what was happening in front of him. Was only hearing what was in front of him.
He began stirring,
“I can sleep on the sofa, it’s alright,” Harry said with a shrug.
“Merry Christmas, Draco,” Harry said in a low voice, kissing the top of his head. He didn’t say anything, but he knew that Draco was happy that he was back home even if he had a hard time showing it. Well, a hard time showing it until Draco without warning lifted his head and clashed their lips together before taking Harry to his bed and showing him
Any other day, Harry would have laughed, but he was actually trying to make a point here, and Draco didn’t help.
Snape’s eyes went from Harry to Draco and back to Harry again before he said: “It seems that Mr Malfoy is offering to accompany you to the hospital wing, Mr Potter. How very…
They had talked so much that they now were out of breath. Still, there was so much more that Harry could have said, but Draco was tired, and there was no chance they could continue this conversation.
dead either.”
Well, not exactly help. Draco didn't want to call it help. Or think about it like that, for that matter. It was simply… Well, he didn't know.
like the answer to that.
all the time…”
malfoycantmuggle(at)maildotcom
“You want me to live here?” Harry asked, mouth hanging half-open in surprise. Draco turned his gaze back to him, watching pink cheeks, emerald eyes behind round spectacles, wild, untamed black hair and those stupid lips… They stared at each other and without answering, Draco leaned into Harry, cupping his cheek with his hand. Their noses brushed, Draco felt Harry’s breath against his mouth. Harry didn’t seem to care that he hadn’t brushed his teeth, and perhaps for the first time, Draco didn’t care either.

react that Harry seemed to have gone missing.
Draco didn’t break the eye contact, even as he walked away. He threw Harry a long look over his shoulder. Harry stood, dumbfounded, with a mouth dry as a desert, realising that Malfoy knew that Harry…looked. He watched Draco’s back with a fast-beating heart.
of him.”
Harry already had an email account too, because of course, he had. He logged in to show Draco how it worked before they started on creating his account. Draco frowned at the name of the address: lightningbolt80(a)mail(dot)com.
And when Draco saw who it was, he flew over them faster than his mind could take in the situation, tossing his wand aside in the fall. Anger surged through his body, eyes unseeing as he slapped his target over and over in the face shouting on top of his lungs.
A/N: This story is finished, I'm editing it at the moment. Sorry that it took a while; I'm currently struggling with some health issues. Thank you for your patience. <3
But disaster always strikes. I never learned of how it happened but when I returned the summer Draco turned 4, I found him sobbing and his mother dead. At this point, I loved him. He was a beautiful child, the characteristics of Spring, he reminded me so much of myself. I begged Hades to let me keep him.
But Draco had other plans. He couldn’t let things naturally happen and he certainly couldn’t give Potter any power so he quickly excused himself, “I’ll be taking my leave, I’m going to the Hospital Wing to see if I’m really fine.
Draco walked up to him, giving him a small smile. “Are you ready to go, Harry?”
He was dressed in a simple grey long sleeve shirts and some of his nicest jeans. He wanted to look nice but he since Draco never told him what they would be doing, he had decided that simple would be better.
-•-•-•-•-•-•-•-•-•-•-•-•-•-•-•-
Potter mistook his moment of thinking for shock and was quick to reassure him, “Malfoy, you’re fine, see? Nothing fell on you, you’re okay!”
When the leading Auror was questions as to what happened, he refused to answer.
Finally, the reach the edge of the forest and Draco held out his hand. “Come on, wouldn’t want you to get lost.” Harry took his hand.
He chose to ignore the part of his mind that not so helpfully reminded him that, well, he also felt some guilt for what he’d done. He hadn’t been forced, per say, he could have stopped at any time he wanted and ask the light side for help but alas, Malfoy’s are proud, and he’d gone through and made a way for the Death Eaters to access Hogwarts and while he protected the younger students in the Battle of Hogwarts, he never truly went on the offense to defend the castle.
He could choose to feel betrayed that Draco was, in a way, using him. But was it so bad? Draco was being honest with him at least and he didn’t seem oppose to making this into a real relationship, not that it was ever a fake relationship. He had initiate courtship with him in the first place and as a pureblood, Harry doubted Draco took it as a joke. Also Draco mentioned kids. Kids with him. A family then made up of them two and whatever kids they had and Harry could picture it. He could picture them living together and falling in love with each other. Harry knew that if he choose to feel betrayed he would be throwing away an amazing opportunity for everything he wanted.
Harry was used to receiving countless letters and packages. Since the war ended, people all over Britain had been sending him letters asking for his hand in marriage, asking to be courted, other demanded he court them. The packages were worse, people sent him gifts in hopes he would send them back as courting gestures, it was getting annoying and a little bit pathetic.
It was a lot to take in. Harry could see himself reaction multiple ways.
“Yeah, fit. Do you seriously have no idea who that is though?” asked Neville.
just so everyone knows, in my story giiny and harry never dated ok thanks. ALso thank  u everyone who has left a comment and sorry it takes me forever to update but college is hard and nursing ... i just dont understand things auffsihd anyways heres this!! i hope u guys enjoy heh
Nico tried to get his head around that. A cousin then. Even though most of them didn’t consider their Godly parent as an indicator of familial bonds (since no one wanted to admit to sleeping with their cousin or something along those lines) his first thought after hearing what Hades had said was to think of this Draco Malfoy character as a cousin. He wasn’t lonely, per say, he had Will and all his friends at camp, he still missed that sibling bond he had shared with his older sister. As much as he loved Hazel, she was often busy and they never really formed a deep bond. “How did you come about him?” he asked.
But the thing so many people were used to forgetting was that Draco was his mother’s child. Narcissa was an omega and while she never went against the lessons that Lucius taught him, Draco was already used to observing, He observed how many people would fall over his mother, how Lucius would cater to her, how even when the dark lord was back she was never forced into taking the Dark Mark (and yes, Draco had used all he learned from her to avoid getting marked).
Looking in the mirror, Draco saw what he always saw. His reflecting and a halo of magic around him. Having the magic of the entire Malfoy ancestry at his disposal wouldn’t be so bad if he didn’t have to constantly see it. Once he married and had kids, he could make it so the power that belong solely to him as the Malfoy head would split to protect those he called his own. Tragically, ever since presenting no one had caught his attention. He can admit that he has set very high standards for any future spouse, namely a large magical reserve, a tight control over their magic and a strong personality that could rival his. Someone clever and witty, not a pushover.
as ya know,,, love kudos and comments... its what keeps me motivated.
Treacle tart had been an obvious one to make, he had taken a recipe book from the Malfoy Library and found the recipe he knew the house elves used to make for him when he was a child. The one at Hogwarts was good, he wouldn’t deny that, but generations of Malfoys had perfected the recipe and he had hoped Harry would enjoy it. He’d also baked crispy pastries filled with different types of sweet and savory fillings. He opted to prepare some orange juice instead of the typical pumpkin juice since he wasn’t the biggest fan of it. He covered strawberries with chocolate. He packed apples and cherries.
If things kept going right, the way they had for the last two weeks, then Draco would start the courting. He’d been gearing up for about one week, subtlety releasing pheromones into the air in places he knew Harry would be in.
Getting out of bed he made his way across his room to his bathroom.
“But listen to him, ‘Mione, this is Malfoy were talking about.”
“-Beware, he who seeks you has good intentions but not everything you encounter will be trustworthy.”
So yes, signing up to help rebuild the castle would be the first step of his plan and it also helped that Potter would most likely also be there. It would give him a chance to closely observe him and learn more information about him.
“It was akin to a magical vortex, sucking all the magic around the place,” a magical expert who wishes to remain anonymous tells us.
Nico was surprised. He knew his dad had kept him in the hotel because of the prophecy but to think Persephone had felt the need to protect another child was surprising to him. Usually the gods didn’t intervene where prophecies where involved.
8:47.
Daily Prophet, March 1996
We tried protecting him but we didn’t know how. Hades was already worried about you and your sister and I myself couldn’t cope. He was getting stronger. It would be no time before his stronger powers would manifest and it would make it harder to find. So we asked Hecate a favor. To hide him away until it was safe and she agreed.
He had so many things to get done. While his plan to woo Harry would not fail, as a Slytherin he always had to plan for the unexpected. And in case his first plan failed, which it would not, he still needed a good standing with the purebloods, if nothing else one of them would give him an heir. To accomplish that, he needed to see where he stood on the food chain. He wasn’t dumb enough to think that he would still be the Slytherin Prince. While he had worked hard at Hogwarts, the Malfoy name was still in shambles, he doubted any smart Slytherin would want to be seen with him, with the exception of those who were truly loyal to him.
When an owl delivered a package to him, he started his ritual of checking the package for hexes, love spells, love potions or anything that could harm him. When it finally came up with nothing harmful, he carefully took the package into his hands. It was a small box, with silver and gold wrapping. He slowly and carefully peeled the paper off and opened the box. To his right he heard Hermione gasp.
“Yeah, mate. I swore we had already checked this part of the train for you.” Ron said, sitting across from Harry.
While they were walking towards the forest they kept silent, and while Harry wanted so badly to break the silence, it was comfortable so he refrained.
Gasping as he was yet again woken up by his strange dreams Draco sat up and rested his face in his hands. While the dreams weren’t nightmares, per say, they definitely weren’t sweet dreams. He’d been having dreams for 4 days straight that were getting more vivid and clear as the days passed.
A couple of minutes’ after 7, Harry was looking around when he noticed Draco. He felt his breath get caught. Everyone, objectively, knew that Draco was one of the most attractive person at Hogwarts, there was no denying that. But seeing him now, with the light shining behind him giving him a halo made Harry realize that deep in his mind he had always noticed the way Draco looked.
He spent his first week at Hogwarts alone with his head down, metaphorically obviously, doing his share of help and generally appearing as if he was too ashamed of his past actions to join in the fun with everyone else.
While no one in the Malfoy house had let the public know, they were disappointed when Draco turned out to be an omega. The Malfoy heir was expected to be an alpha and if his mother had allowed it, they would have tried for more kids. Thank goodness his mother didn’t want to put her body through birth again.
“What?”
Draco and Harry spend a couple of hours talking and sharing food. Draco thought it was great, every time Harry laughed or smiled at him, Draco could see a boy who he could love if given enough time.
Apart from the foodstuff he prepared, he also had taken some time to pick a spot in the forest. He had planned for a picnic at sunset, so he walked around for a while until he found a clearing that seemed nice enough. As the only child of the Malfoy family, a family that valued power and knowledge, naturally he had had tutors all before Hogwarts and during summers, so getting the necessary charms and spells to make the clearing prettier and clean had been easy to find and use.
Draco started to panic. He had no idea what had came over him when he decided to be honest with Harry about -some of- his motives. Now that he had blabbed and Harry was quiet and thinking, he deiced to show Harry his courtship gift.
He figured he’d get no answers just going over the dream and it was quiet early in the morning, too early to be full awake, he decided to go back to sleep and worry about his problems later.
After the castle was more or less in order and Draco had free time to spend before going back to his Eight Year, he decided that he needed to go to Gringotts and search the Malfoy vaults. He had gone over all the family properties, jewels and artefacts and knew a good lot of the things his family had and their respective history. And he was almost 100% sure that somewhere in there, they had things that had belonged to the Potter family that they probably gained via marriages to them.
Nico’s brain thought came to a stop. Prophecy. “So he’s your son? My brother?
year he realized that Potter actually just wanted to live his life and in 4
He only hoped it wouldn’t take Harry too long to catch up to what he was doing. He also hoped Harry wouldn’t get offended. Most of his plan was riding on the fact that Harry wasn’t a typical alpha, most of them would probably think that Draco was mocking them with a gesture such as courtship. Draco hoped Harry would take it at face value. Draco wanted something so he went and got it.
Harry saw Draco contemplate with himself. Harry saw him clearly thinking about his answer. “You are a very powerful wizard. You’re also attractive and I won’t deny that you smell amazing. Additionally, it’s always been us, hasn’t it? We can’t deny that we’ve always had a strong connection to each other… And, I want to survive this after war world. I want my kids to be able to wear the Malfoy name proudly, and if this goes well, they might even wear the Potter name. I want my future kids and myself to thrive. And we are both strong, no? I think we could be great.”
The Malfoy heir is an omega, a shocking revelation when taken into account that there hasn’t been a born Malfoy omega in about fifteen generations.
Potter. Hm. If Draco was going to let him stick a couple of children into him, he might as well start thinking of him as Harry.
The end of the war was only the beginning. People had funerals to attend, Hogwarts reparations needed to be started, families needed to be reunited. Teens started to present their second gender left and right now that the stress of the war was over.
“Ooof, yeah Harry… sounds out of your league.”
The rebuilding process passed, oh so slowly. He was at least glad that didn’t get paired up with Potter again. He had certainly watched Potter enough after the “incident” and seen how he interacted with witches (and even some wizards) who attempted to flirt with him. Simply put, Potter was dense. Obvious. A bit of an idiot. Every time someone approached him to, we’ll chat him up, he would completely ignore their advances. At first glance Draco had thought that Potter thought himself above them all, but he quickly corrected himself when he watched closer. Potter, it seemed, just didn’t notice.
Now that the night was almost ending though, Harry felt it was necessary to ask a question that had been plaguing him for a while. “Why did you initiate a courtship with me? Don’t get me wrong, I’m happy and this has been fun and nice. I find myself enjoying this time with you, but I’m still curios.”

Once he was seated to the right side of his father and across his stepmother, he decided to get down to business. “What exactly is this about?”
According to multiple outlets, the esteemed Malfoy family consisting of Lucius, Narcissa and Draco Malfoy, have moved back to Britain.
He had a vague idea as to what this was about. He hadn’t meant to listen in when his father and his stepmom were talking but once he started he couldn’t out himself especially when he heard his name being mentioned. He remembers Persephone saying that he would be the indicated one for the quest.
Draco had contemplated letting Potter do all the work, making him realize what a price Draco was and fall madly in love.
Now, he’s submitted a new report which shows how blood family wards, which are worked through generational magic, can be put to use not only in family houses but distributed to members to offer optimal protection.
And helping with the rebuilding process would help.
So many of the other Hogwarts houses had questioned why the entire house of Slytherin, mostly alphas, had pledged their alliances to him. After all they didn’t know him and to them, he was just an omega who should be a follower.
Later in the morning, Draco woke up slowly. He quickly checked the time with his wand.
Im very excited to hear any feedback!
Harry was glad he had reacted fast enough to
“I’m sure being raised by your muggle relatives must have been different from the way I was raised, hm?”
Hades was the one who answered that, “When he was seven, we decided to send him away for his safety and have tried hard to let him go, we hoped his life was good where he was and have tried not to speak about him, not even to ourselves, for fear of his safety but now that the prophecy has been fulfilled, we’ve decided we want to see him again. If only to explain why we sent him away.”
The dreams all pretty much started the same way. He was sitting at a table, in a dark room that should have been scary and uninviting except Draco knew no harm could come to him whenever he was in that room. Sitting at the head of the table was a woman, tall and vibrant. No matter how much he looked up he could never see her face, though. The woman would start talking but Draco could never hear what she was saying until the last seconds of his dreams came.
“Oh, wow. I love them! If I’m being honest, it never occurred to me that you would bake and cook. Before this year I would not be able to picture Draco Malfoy doing anything that could be left to the house elves.” Harry said.
Deciding to help rebuild Hogwarts hadn’t been part of his original plan but once he saw on the Daily Prophet that they needed competent witches and wizards it quickly became the first step of his plan.
“Mate, are you serious?” Ron had his mouth hanging open.
“Harry!” Hermione admonished.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry knew that while, yes, he wasn’t ready to start courting anyone, he didn’t think he ever would. Courting… seemed too demand too much from him. All his life he had people demanding things from him and he… was tired. He wanted a break and having to pick gifts and preform grand gestures just tired him more than excited him.
“Oh, Ronald, close your mouth.”
Im back w anotther chapter. thank u everyone who commented!!! its literally what motivated me to get this chapter finished!! i a;ready started the third one heheheheh
Seeing as he couldn’t exactly disagree, Nico started eating, hoping time would pass by fast seeing as he was rather curious about his so called quest.
He knew the Malfoy name would be in ruins, Lucius dead or most likely rotting in Azkaban for life, he had hopes for his mother as she’d never taken the Dark Mark but only what she did from that point forward would tell. The hopes for himself. Well he would argue he was still underage and most importantly an omega. He’d say he was pressured by all the alphas in his family, namely, Lucius and his aunt Bellatrix, he hoped that would be enough for a light sentence, a couple of months in Azkaban and maybe only probation if he was lucky.
Although he could understand the reason he had to hide his appearance and even though the changes weren’t that plentiful or noticeable, it was still annoying.
We walked around for a while longer. Dusk had long faller when she started to slow down. I asked her what was wrong. Her water had broken. I told her I’d get help but she refused. Told me that she knew what to do.
A sigh was heard from her companion, “I know you wish to protect him, but where would he go? His powers will manifest soon, everywhere he will be an outcast.”
“I know a place, it could be dangerous, but he’s the son of-”
Draco had something specific in mind he wanted to take out. A courting ring that had been given to a Potter by a Malfoy back in the 1700’s. Draco thought Harry might appreciate the sentimentality, he was after all a Gryffindor.
While it wasn’t typical of alphas to take their omegas last name, Draco didn’t really care. He wasn’t about to let things be done in a typical way. And plus, while Draco was an omega, he had been raised as an alpha.
He would restore the Malfoy name by seducing Potter. By mating with him. By giving birth to the next generation of Malfoy-Potters.
-•-•-•-•-•-•-•-•-•-•-•-•-•-•-•-
But Harry needed more time. He would make an effort when he was ready. Sometimes he just wished that he had been born an omega, not just because no one would have forced him into a war as their leader if he had been an omega, but also because he could admit to himself that being on the receiving end of courting sounded nice. Receiving gifts and nice gestures sounded, quite frankly, amazing. Harry knew he had basically no chance to ever receive courting gestures. Yes, alphas dating other alphas was somewhat acceptable in the wizarding world, but even if Harry dated another alpha he knew that alphas don’t really get courted. Courting is for omegas and betas, if only sometimes.
like always.. kudos and comments keep me motivated.. gift ideas are still welcomed LOL i have like 2 more ish courtship gifts and a couple more dates before i end this but hmm i have trouble letting go so yeah! any ideas are welcomed and i might incorporate them into the story heh… i’ll add some pics of what type of layered jewelry harry is wearing next chapter
From the other side of the Great Hall, Draco was assessing his progress. After a little power play with his fellow Slytherins, they had quickly fallen back to following him like loyal little minions. He had promised them, not outright protection but the tools to protect themselves. He had gained many skills while living with the Dark Lord and if teaching them gained him power, well Draco wouldn’t let an easy opportunity like that one slip away. He’d been teaching them all defensive spells that, if one correctly, could repel very nasty hexes, never mind whatever the other houses were throwing at them.
I was confused. One of what, I though. I guess she noticed my confusing since her next words made it much clearer. “A god,” she said. I remember distantly thinking that it was a beautiful day for new life. I decided to walk around with her for a while. I don’t have many human friends. I asked her how she knew about Gods. She told me that he future son, Draco, would be son to one.
“So where is he? And how come I’ve never heard about him before?”

An after effect of the war ending that many people had foresaw, was the return of many families that had fled the country when the war had started or even before then. Many families returned by January of 1996, asking Hogwarts to let their children be sorted and continue their education where they should have started it in the first place. Even though it was a bit unorthodox to let children get sorted in the middle of the school term, they made an exception for many students.
(See the end of the chapter for
Deciding to stop dwelling on things he could do nothing about, at least not yet, he started getting naked and ready for his shower.
Her companion quickly hurried to stop her, “Don’t say it! Not everyone knows and it’s best it stays that way for his safety if you intend to send him away.” He looked around, as if checking to see if anyone was listening, “We need to keep this secret until he is safe.”
Witch Weekly, March 1996
He stopped looking when he came across a gray gaze, looking right back at him. Harry quickly looked away when he realized it was the blonde guy from before. He quickly looked back again at him, since wow, he was the most gorgeous guy Harry had ever seen. A very pretty face, angular yet he seem to hold a softness to him. That said pretty face raised an eyebrow at him, holding his gaze until a dark haired girl got the attention of the blonde boy and they quickly moved to ride the train.
In the end, Persephone was the one to break the silence and end their silent conversation, “I have a quest for you,” She stopped talking and glanced around the table, seeing the food laid out, “but I think we should eat first and talk about the details later.”
Her lips pursed, and she glanced at Draco with a far more stern expression now. "I see. And the others?"
Blaise blinked at him. “Draco…we just got here.”
Draco smiled. "Because. I think you're like me," he said.
“Draco?” Draco turned to glare at him, and Potter dropped his hand. But the touch wasn’t what had really upset him. Potter calling him by hi first name was something he had to discourage
“Mmm. True. Being able to tell when someone is lying is a very useful skill if one is king, after all. Still boring, though. And mothers…that's almost frivolous.” After all, who wanted to make flowers bloom? Girls, he supposed, but even so, it seemed a silly power to have.
Once in ‘Harriet’s’ room, Draco sent Blaise off to get Pansy so that they could talk. When Blaise had left he turned back to ‘her.’ “Is that really your hair?”
I was never going to like you?"
were going to kiss
Now very annoyed, Draco turned to her. “Because, mother, the idea was mine. Not his. None of them even suggested it. I wanted him to.”
Harry smiled, obviously able to see how pleased he was. Then he sighed. “This is going to take us forever at this rate. Look, Sirius…can’t you talk to him in your other form?”
Still, it didn’t stop him from glancing up to look for him every five minutes. He tried reading, but got no further than a page or two before he gave up.
“I’m sorry. I just…” Harry’s hand rose, then dropped. “I could have Kreacher bring something to drink, if you liked.”
“No need to shout,” Potter said, blinking at him owlishly and sitting up. “Time for me to get up, anyway. Auror training starts in an hour...” He slid out of bed, and Draco watched, wide-mouthed, as Potter padded, entirely naked, out of his room.
The man walking next to the young man was the first to notice Draco when he came out of the bushes. His eyes went wide, and he motioned to Harry to move back, then called out to the man ahead. “Um…Padfoot…?”
It wasn't until Potter brought his tray for supper he got his answer. "I agree to your terms. But I can't stay too long. So for every story, you get one question. Okay? And I promise to answer them as truthfully as I can. If I can't…"
Part of his brain was marveling over the fact that Potter was so fit, and another couldn’t get over those green eyes or the black rumpled hair. It took him at least ten minutes to gather himself enough to try to ignore the images and try to sleep once more, but after several minutes of tossing and turning, he gave up and got out of bed. Maybe there would be breakfast downstairs? And hopefully Potter would already be gone.
Draco’s throat closed as the two went to the window and looked out, Fenrir sniffing all the while, his eyes narrowed. He whispered something to Bella, who nodded, then waved her wand over the sill, and across the opening of the window.
"Very well. Dismissed. We'll consider this dealt with, then, Severus. Do come up and try some of this soup. It's lovely."
Draco shot a look at Blaise. He hadn’t told her, apparently. Checking to see the door was closed, he smirked. “Pansy, I would like to introduce you to Prince Harry of Gryffindor. Or…” he said with a widening grin, “Princess Harriet for the next day or so.”
with him! Can we just go?”
Draco knew he would, but what if he made a bigger fool of himself in the meantime? Still, he nodded. “Okay.” He let Harry lead him back to the couch, closing his eyes when Harry settled beside him rather than across from him. Bad sign, that, but he couldn’t manage to get his tongue working right to tell him so, or to ask him to move away.
All the air went out of Draco at her words. He couldn’t believe it. He could barely breathe.
Draco nodded again. "Because I thought you were like me. And… well, I was right, wasn't I?"
The other man’s distrust didn’t seem to fade at Draco’s reassurance. “You’re bringing them twigs and branches? Where’s your axe?”
“Oh…please…don’t stop.”
“No. Just your son, sire.”
"And…" He felt Harry move closer. "I also considered what you said. About becoming friends?"
Harry flushed. “Yeah, but…most don’t sleep with…I mean…we’re guys.”
“No.” Potter looked crestfallen now. He pulled away, and Draco felt bereft, but he looked at the bed rather than following him with his eyes. “Never mind. A promise is a promise. I’ll leave,” he said softly. “I’m sorry I tormented you, Draco. I never meant…” He sighed. “Good bye.”
Settling next to him, Draco turned to meet his friend’s eyes, trying to ignore the rising feeling of dread at the words. “What about them?”
“Goody…” Draco said, plopping himself into his own chair.
Draco snorted. “No. I’m from the palace.”
“Wood?” Draco looked at him. “But…I’d never be able to carry that much!”
“Moony” shook his head at this. “I don’t think so, Harry. Likely he’s just generally more intelligent than the usual beasty. But either way, we can’t take him with us. We’re late as it is. We’ll be lucky if we make it in time for the feast. Come on. We need to get moving again.”
“Sirius…that was then. Things are different now. And if Draco and I start on the right foot…” Harry met Draco’s eyes. “I’d trust you, Draco.”
Well, that was different, wasn’t it? Still…not so bad an idea when he thought about it. “Really? So…in a way it’s your First, too.” Draco couldn’t help but smile at the idea.
Blaise laughed. “I suppose she is. As I am yours, highness. I would…like your blessing to court her. Unless…she is spoken for?”
“I think, Harry,” Dumbledore broke in, “that he has chosen you for the one to ‘help’ him.”
"Ugh, god, Potter… haven't you heard of the Enervate spell? Works far better than shaking, and if someone is injured, it has far less chance of causing further injury."
Right now, sandwiches sounded like a feast to Draco, so he nodded, almost smiling at that. “Thank you.” Now all he had to do was last until Potter decided to stop. He could do that, at least. Right?
“So…what was the next, Draco? Were you a prince again?” he asked with a smile.
Finally, he took his broom and went out flying again. It was almost enough to distract him. Except for the flash of green eyes that he kept seeing every time he let himself relax. What the hell was wrong with him, anyway?
"I can't," he said. "I told them I'd only be a minute. Look, don't do this again, and I'll see what I can do to arrange another visit with your aunt."
When he made his way down to the dining hall, refreshed and well-dressed, his mother was waiting at the head of the table. “Draco. And where is your bride-to-be?”
Finally, Draco tried the only thing he could. He sought out Potter. It took him a few days, because he refused to go anywhere near the Weasleys’ hut, so he had to stake out the Ministry and hope he would run into Potter there.
They flew on that way for another stretch of time, and finally Draco relaxed enough to look around. While in the tower, he’d had little to do but read, but he had read as much as his aunt would allow. And there had been times when she’d been indulgent enough to bring him anything he’d asked for, so he’d had plenty of stories to choose from. So he knew about trees and woods and animals and streams… Still, reading about the world was very different from seeing it first-hand. It was all rather beautiful, he thought.
“I’ll tell you,” Draco whispered. “It starts with my parents wanting me to find a bride…”
Draco stuck out his chin. “And why not? I’m hardly old enough to marry some girl! I’m barely eighteen, father.”
Draco nodded and stood up, mounting Egan and giving him a soft pat. “Ready to go for a ride, boy? I bet you’ve missed this.” Egan had suffered from colic, and so Harry and his stable hands had been caring for the horse carefully to help him recover. The stallion threw his mane a bit and gave a snort that Draco interpreted as “yes,” and Draco couldn’t help but smile. He had his horse back, and Harry would be riding with them. What could possibly be wrong with the world?
Draco took the stallion’s reins, then led it after the cart, not sure what to make of the man who had helped him more in one day than the man he was to marry had since the moment they’d met. What he was sure of was that he
He looked away from Harry and back toward the lighted windows then sighed. “I should probably get back, before father sends the guards to search for me. I don’t suppose you’ll come in?”
Draco looked between them, his throat closing. His father had
At first, Draco blinked, not sure what Harry meant, then, realizing what he was asking for, he took a deep breath, then took both of Harry’s hands in his, looking up to meet his eyes. “Harry, will you be my First?” The words were simple, but formal enough. Right now, he wasn’t too certain he’d be able to manage anything more flowery. And he was quite sure that his patience couldn’t manage to wait more than a few moments longer.
"I found a description of a memory spell causing headaches when the memory comes to the surface," she admitted grudgingly.
”Wonder what?” Draco asked, his breath coming faster now. But he couldn’t find it in himself to pull away.
Not that he knew the true identity of his new boyfriend. But somehow, they found one another each time. He'd never known anyone he felt more at ease with. The other boy seemed almost to know him better than he knew himself. Even though they never admitted their names to one another.
“That’s her. Beauty, ain’t she?” he asked with another one of those toothy grins that showed the yellow of his teeth, along with a few gaps, making Draco shudder.
Harry's flow of babble stopped, and he swallowed. "If you don't want to date me, I understand."
Draco pulled back, shaking his head. He couldn’t do that. The guards would never listen to Harry if he did.
Draco tells Harry about a series of parties thrown at Hogwarts.
Draco didn’t want him to go. Or rather, he didn’t want to be left behind. But since he had no choice… "All right. I’ll see you soon?"
Draco nodded, then relaxed infinitesimally as his mother swept away. He knew this was going to be difficult. It would have been even before they’d found where Harriet was from. But now? Narcissa would do everything in her power to prevent this marriage, he knew. How could Blaise handicap them this way?
They don't know. Can't understand I'm far more responsible than they could possibly give me credit for.
threw, Potter? Honestly. Why don’t you throw your party, and I’ll go to the club, and we can both have our own good time?”
Draco and his friends, there to prove they had not simply passed by their teachers the previous year, fared the worst of the lot. Everyone blamed them, Marked or not, for their families' part in the war. Each day, the ostracism seemed worse. And the teachers seemed uwilling to do anything about it.
Draco’s heart flipped over a bit at that, but he smiled. “Fairy tales starring us?”
“So uncomplicate it, Harry.” He almost wanted to ask why Harry could ever want to leave him, but knew he could never do that. Harry wouldn’t understand the loss he’d feel if they were separated. To him, they were just friends.
“And you, Zabini!” Harry called after them.
“It’s all right, father,” Draco whispered, hoping to calm him. “He won’t be here much longer.”
Most times, he was retrieved and placed on a much stricter guard for the next day or so, but there were occasional times when he managed to find a few moments to himself with no one the wiser. He simply didn’t understand why everyone was so tense about his upcoming birthday. After all, he’d had seventeen of them before. Surely this one would be no different from any other?
Of course, there was, but Draco knew quite well that his mother would be even more horrified by his choice of spouse than she was by the fact that he seemed to have no interest in the girls she’d chosen for him.
Harry shook his head. "He took me back to the cottage. But—" He met Draco's eyes. "It was the best day of my childhood. And he took it from me." Suddenly, he looked at Draco in a different way. "Things between us could have been different," he said.
Feeling much more certain of himself, Draco nodded, then curled up under his comforter and fell into the most restful sleep he’d had since the day he’d first set eyes on Potter.
“It will be dealt with, mother. And none of your concern.” His arm went around Harry’s waist and led him to his chair. “Sorry I kept you awake so late, love. But it seems to have worked in our favor, doesn’t it?”
“Just that it was a good thing I had a good wank in the shower. I might have done more than just held you. Might have helped.”
“Well, one’s first kiss with someone is an astonishing thing, is it not? Surely it will be enough to shock him back to his true form,” the wizard said, his tone making it sound as though it were the most reasonable thing in the world.
He knew things that would be vital in winning Potter over and he couldn’t pass over the opportunity of learning new things that would potentially help him along with his plan.
“Oh, Harry. I’ve been searching the train all over for you,” Hermione sat down next to him.
This made Draco pause for a minute, he already knew that Harry Potter was a powerful wizard but seeing the sheer strength of power just added another incentive for his plan to work. His future children would be so powerful, maybe more powerful than even Potter himself.
Draco watched as Harry started opening the containers, watched as his eyes crinkled when he smiled as he bit into a treacle tart. “This is delicious; the house elves really outdid themselves this time.”
Remembering his weird dreams to see if he could figure out what they were trying to tell him, Draco laid back down.
Draco and Potter had been polite to each other, Draco since he didn’t want to seem to eager and Potter, well, Draco thought he was just too awkward and confused about their new not rivals dynamic to know how to navigate interactions with him.
From what he could gather, someone who wouldn’t harm him was looking for him but for what purpose? Draco was apprehensive about it.
Now that he was free of any charges, he, alone, would rebuild the Malfoy fame to its former glory. He would erase from everyone’s mind that he was Lucius’ son. By the time his plan was executed, his reputation wouldn’t be as the son of a disgraced Death Eater. It would be something better, someone to respect.
When Harry could no longer see him, he turned back to his friends who were all looking at him cheekily.
Retrieving the ring turned out to be easy enough, the Malfoy’s were still filthy rich and the goblins were still greedy little creatures.
Two weeks into the terms, Harry was sitting at the Gryffindor table with his friends. While he’d been eating his dinner, his friends started discussing something he had been avoiding thinking of. Now that the end of the war had taken the damper off their instincts and that they were over 16, a lot of his friends had started to think of dating and mating again.
Suddenly he heard the compartment door open and in piles in his friends. Old and new.
“So what? You’d rather he stayed here and die?!,” At her raised voice, the sleeping boy moved and mumbled, lowering her voice, the woman said, “fight to prove he won’t bring down the world? For some dumb prophecy?”
It was the end of a beautiful spring; I had made it so. It was almost my time to return to the Underworld. I was enjoying my last days a small town of France when I see a heavily pregnant woman waddled around the streets.  Dusk would be falling soon so I approached her, mind you disguised as a human so it surprised me when she asked if I was one of them.
Harry didn’t think so. He went back to reading the note, very aware of his friends eyes on him while he read. He could also sense another pair of eyes but he wouldn’t look to confirm until he had read the note.
Riding the Hogwarts Express for another school year felt surreal to Draco.
Some would call him narcissistic for wanting to date someone who had his best qualities. He would agree.
But what Draco thought was more important than the food or the clearing was his first courtship gift. He had thought long and hard about what to get Harry. They didn’t have the closest relationship, yet, so Draco at first was stuck on deciding what to get Harry. He had wanted something personal and something that would show his true intentions. At last, he decided to do something classical with his own touch. Typically, alphas will gift omegas jewelry so he decided on a charm bracelet with his own touch.
Getting the things set up and the place ready had been easy enough.
“Of course not, he’s like a son to me but that begs the question, where will he go?”
With their expectant looks, he continued. “It seems like none of the news outlets have gotten a picture of him but that’s the Malfoy heir, Draco.”
Aside from physical changes, he could feel as the lock on his magic started to slowly lift, if only partially. This was another thing he understood the necessity of but didn’t like.
as always, comments feed me and keep me motivated tee hee :D ill try to update soon i already have ideas ok many many ideas.
I remember being shocked at what her first words upon seeing me were. She told me to take him. I declined of course. She told me she couldn’t keep him. Maybe out of pity or the goodness of my heart, I offered her a place to stay and to raise him. Maybe her desperation was so great and she agreed. For years, I would visit that town and see them. Draco was a beautiful child and I got to know his mother.
She left and I didn’t see her again until next day. When I, thought, she now had an addition. She was carrying around a beautiful child. Very small and very clearly new born. Pink as all new born babies and sleeping.
Draco quickly reacted as he’d plan and forced his body to relax into Potter’s hold, “Thanks, Potter, that came out of nowhere. Now let me go, please.”
Draco once more adjusted his plan. His previous plan he called for subtly, soft intentions but now, he had to make sure his intentions couldn’t be misunderstood. Only loud and clear would work with Potter.
After he had “saved” Potter from Malfoy Manor, Draco started thinking. At this point, he already had a plan but it would take time. Not many people would trust him and getting a job would depend on him getting perfect N.E.W.T.s, only Outstanding’s would do. But what if he bound himself to the a powerful and respected wizard, what if he was mated to Harry Potter, what if he was to give birth to the next generation of Potters (okay, Malfoy-Potters, he still had to show where he stood on blood purity if only by less murderous methods)? Well, the wizarding world would have no option but to respect him, he was sure Potter would not allow for anything to happen to him.
Draco started feeling a sensation of being watched, but when he went to look he couldn’t see anyone looking at him. He turned back to his father.
As soon as the trials ended, Draco decided it was time to put his plan into motion.
Persephone sighed, “Frankly it’s a long story.”
September 1996
Draco felt the magic thickened as he was dragged by an inviable pull towards none other than Potter.
“Yes. Lead the way.” Draco started walking towards the forest. “Do you want to tell me where we are going?”
“Wait, wait,” said Hermione disbelieving, “the so called genius that the Daily Prophet seems to be in a love-hate relationship with?”
He started to feel a gaze on him, he turned to it and came across the prettiest green eyes he had ever seen. Said pretty green eyes quickly looked away from him and just as quickly looked back. Draco could feel his magic doing something it had never done before, it start reacting. Before he could dig deeper into the sensation of his magic, Pansy called him so they could get on the train already. Suddenly, he was looking forward to being at Hogwarts.
His host was silent for too long after, and Draco was about to shout at him again when he finally spoke. "No. Never completely alone. Though I felt like it sometimes. Is it truly so bad?"
“You didn’t tell me you were related to the Queen, Sirius!” Harry exclaimed.
The relief overwhelmed Draco, and he sagged slightly in place. Andromeda. Of course. He blamed his tension for his reaction, grateful when Harry helped him straighten once more.
Draco nodded slowly. He knew Harry was right. The idea still scared him, though. What if the guards attacked him again?
“All right,” Harry said with a smile. “Come on.”
"Dumb move," his caretaker said. "That could have been much worse, you know. I wouldn't advise you to try it again."
"Harry?" the king asked. "What about him?"
Draco waited until nearly midnight before sneaking out to see ‘her.’ All he could do now was hope that his mother hadn’t said something to scare Harry off. The longer he knew him, the more fascinating he found him. And he found himself hoping he would get to know him a great deal better.
Harry raised his chin. "Sir, I believe the only life lost because of Draco's actions was his friend, Vincent Crabbe, and I would say he held more fault for his own death than anyone else."
“No! It’s not that. Harry…do you know how long I’ve wanted that?”
the Prince?” Moony asked slowly.
The second Harry’s lips touched his scales, Draco knew that it didn’t matter whether or not this worked. This was what he wanted, either way. Harry kissing him. But then he knew it
“You don’t know him, mother. Not the way father and I do. He gets his nose in everything! He’ll follow us everywhere! And why on earth does he want a room near
With a sigh, Harry pulled back. “Ginny’s dating Neville. I made her wait a bit too long, I guess. And…they work together well, so…” He smiled softly. “I’m happy for them. I was a bit lonely, but… And honestly, Draco I never really think about these things until they’re shoved under my nose. So why should this be any different?”
Still, it was one thing to know he had to talk to Potter. It was quite another to gather his nerve to do so. He knew where the prat lived, of course. It was the Blacks’ ancestral home, after all. Not something Potter could truly keep from him. But facing him…how could he do that? Just the thought made his throat close, the memory of the dreams returning far too quickly. Not to mention he was certain to get a less-than friendly reception when he arrived unannounced.
“They…will?”
“Not now, Pansy!” Draco spun away from the window, then moved out into the hall, hurrying down the steps to the courtyard where Blaise waited with his prospective ‘bride.’ He hurried down the first turn of steps, then slowed, trying to regain his dignity. After all, this might not work out in his favor, and he needed to keep in control as long as he could.
Draco shook his head. If Harry wasn’t there, there seemed little reason to ride. He turned around and made his way to the gardens, settling by the pool at the centre of the main garden.
Potter shook his head. “Ah, that will be unnecessary, sire. Simply stack them in a wooden cart, and my betrothed can tow it.”
Snape gave him a shake. "I told you, boy. These parties of yours would end. Did you perhaps misunderstand me?"
"No, you didn't. Which convinces me more than anything else you deserve it, Malfoy. You don't deserve to be sent to Azkaban. Not for what you've done."
“Ah, right…” She lowered her hand. “Um…the stables? Whereabouts are they?”
"Don't move. You hurt your arm. It required some healing, but it will be better by the morning. Just don't touch the front door again. Or the back door. Or the windows. I don't want to have to heal you again, Draco."
Pansy gave him a hard time for it. She, too, was involved with a new beau—from Gryffindor. She refused to admit who yet, but she'd admitted he was a Gryffindor, at least.
dog?”
"I don't—"
Turning back to Draco, he asked, “You’re not a farmer, are you?”
“Oh…right.” Potter’s cheeks flushed. “I’m obsessed with you in that one?”
"No, aunt, please…"
Did this have to do with what those strangers were filling his head with? “Harry…”
"Please don’t leave me behind?"
The story of Obsession and its dangers.
Harry frowned. "You sent him into the ocean?" he echoed. He moved to sit across from Draco. "I wondered if it was just some excuse. Because I didn't even remember leaving the cottage they rented." He tilted his head. "You really did that?" Draco nodded. "Why?"
Of Towers and Witches and finding your way.
"If you want." Harry seemed ready to talk more, but Draco didn't think he could bear it right now.
Draco snorted and shoved at him. “Not funny. You see how you like it when someone is trying to force
Draco blinked at that. What did that mean?
Harry might not be getting the gist, but it seemed someone else was. “Harry…what if…he
“I don’t want that, Draco. You’re my best friend…”
"And he was pleased?"
Huffing, Draco turned away. "Either you're lying…" Or he'd been given a memory charm as well. If Lucius thought him a Muggle boy, that was likely exactly what he had done.
Harry looked a bit dazed, but he was smiling. “Wow…” His hand came up to stroke Draco’s cheek again.
All he could do now was hope that none of them would be successful.
“Harry,” his mother was saying now in the calm voice she saved for his father when he looked about ready to execute someone for no real reason at all, “it is a dangerous thing to encourage. It’s…wrong. He is making a mockery of those of us who try to live good, wholesome lives. Surely you don’t think he is a good example for how you should live?”
Obviously that had been the wrong answer. Potter’s eyes went cold.
The guards his mother had obviously stationed at the princess’s door were easily enough distracted with a spell, and soon he was closing the door to her bedroom. “Harry?”
“What?” Draco’d never heard that. “That is ridiculous. Our people love us.”
Why did the name sound familiar? Had Potter mentioned him before? "Who?"
"No… of course not." But it was a start.
Draco snorted. “You’re not sure it was a dog, or you’re not sure it’s
“All right. We’ll stop. We can have sandwiches.”
“God, I’ve missed this place,” he was saying.
"Me, too." He hadn't expected this to be something so helpful. He'd just wanted information. Somehow, this had become a nice distraction. "So… ready for another story?"
The Minister nodded. He flipped through a few more pages, and Draco waited for him to mention Dumbledore's death.
“Now, there’s one I definitely don’t mind so much,” Potter responded with a grin, then he zoomed in front of Draco, did a loop on his broom, and was off in a flash.
“But you said that a kiss was what would break the spell,” Harry said.
"Definitely," Potter said with a smile. He took Draco's tray, and hurried off to retrieve the others.
A soft, mellow voice, but one that could never possibly pass as female, answered him. “I’m shocked not to see Muggles hanging from the trees for the least infractions.”
“Nothing, hm?” Potter sighed, obviously disappointed. “Fine. I’ll take this back up to the palace, but if you don’t have anything waiting for me when I get back…” He let the warning trail off, and Draco shivered, knowing whatever he chose, it wouldn’t be good. He nodded to show Potter he understood.
are you?”
Another test? What was this? “What do you mean, mother?”
That is when the door opens, and Draco looks out at him. The startled look on his face says everything we need to know. “I am?”
“Please, Draco. You need to talk with someone about this. Why not me?”
Harry shook his head. “I don’t hate you, Draco.”
The other young man moved closer. "I’m sorry…Are you all right?" he asked.
Harry met his eyes. "I've always been on my own. I never thought about what it would be like to be completely alone. I should have worked out something, Draco. I realize it's too late for a simple apology, but I'm here to give it a shot."
it was that was wrapped around him.
"No. I wouldn't wish them on Malfoy, let alone you. I'll… go talk to them." He met Draco's eyes. "This doesn't mean I believe you, Malfoy."
"Sixteen, sir." Draco couldn't see why it mattered. After all, he'd chosen to be Marked on his own. "No one forced me into it, if that is what you believe, sir."
Harry raised an eyebrow then nodded slowly.
Draco missed whatever Weasley’s response was, but he recognized the first voice as Potter’s. He ducked out of the view of the single window, but pressed close, hoping to hear what they said to one another.
Harry made his way back to where Draco was hiding. “They won’t let me talk to anyone. And wouldn’t say why. How did you get out here, Draco? Were you out here when you changed?”
“Good.”
The head of the MLE hissed something else into Shacklebolt's ear. Draco could easily make out his words. "And Dumbledore's death?"
And so we see Harry take his leave. But we cannot help but wonder how the Malfoy heir will react to being required to live with his former obsession? Will he be able, in any way, to stand the thought? Can the two live together even a day and not kill one another?
But even worse, it seemed as though his parents were actually considering it.
He stopped abruptly in the doorway of the chamber when he saw Harry sitting on his bed, dressed only in leggings and a loose shirt now, which made Draco wish it were tighter; or better still, completely gone.
“It wasn’t just that. I see you are angry, but…can you honestly say you aren’t happier now than you were before all this?” his father asked.
"Now, if you’d like."
"Draco Malfoy, you are charged with several counts: attempted murder, sedition, being part of a terrorist organization, and use of several Unforgivable Curses. How do you plead?"
“Yeah, well, we never were on the best of terms. Did she treat you all right, Harry?”
As the three of them walked back up the steps toward the guest quarters, he leaned close to his friend and hissed, “What on earth were you thinking?”
“In the next one?”
“Then I’m not leaving,” Potter said with a smile and a shrug.
"Time?" Draco frowned. "What? Like during school hours? But won't that get us into even more trouble?"
"Are you certain this is wise, Harry?" the man asked. His voice was so calm, Draco wasn't able to read much from it, only his concern for Harry.
Potter’s eyes went wide at that. “Worse? Is that…possible?”
Potter’s face clouded at that. “Damn. Tonight, Draco. Okay?”
“Oh? Were we going to do that?” Draco asked with a bit of a smirk.
Sounded like excuses to Draco. Whatever reason Potter had for doing this, it would be over as soon as the King returned. And really, aside from what little he had to do for his own survival? He refused to do any more of Potter’s ridiculous chores. Especially the ones for the king and his betrothed.
Before an hour was up, he’d had enough dancing, and headed for the gardens once more, hope high in his heart. He waited to call out until he’d closed the doors behind him. “Harry?”
The Queen wavered for a moment, but at a nod from her husband, she held out her son. “Save him,” she whispered.
He set the parchment aside and went on with his cleaning. It was completely forgotten when his benefactor appeared for supper that evening. He hadn't been expecting him, but it was a pleasant surprise, and Draco found himself trying harder than ever before. Potter or not, he wanted to know this person. He wanted them to like him as much as he was coming to like them.
in the room when I mentioned they got worse each dream, right?”
“And if I don’t want to?”
your son.”
After supper, Draco was separated from his prospective bride by Minister Snape and his mother. Narcissa took Harriet’s arm and led her off to her rooms, talking to her so quietly that Draco couldn’t hear a word. All he could do was hope that Harriet would manage to answer her well.
Draco turned to Harry. "You did? Why?"
“It’s…going to hurt?” He’d heard it hurt for girls with their first times, but he’d always heard that with boys it was simply a matter of getting it over with.
"Tomorrow, Draco."
"Shut up, Malfoy." He shot the other young man a glower, then glanced down the hall again.
“I am here to claim your son. I heard that you would make king whoever married your son, no matter who they might be.”
“I’ll escort them, mother,” Draco said, before Narcissa could drag him off to fill his ears with reasons why he could never marry this girl.
"Draco,
Still, just when Draco was certain his fingers
Gryffindor? Draco looked at his guard, horrified. Was Blaise out of his mind? He could hardly ask the words out loud, though, for fear his mother would take the words themselves as rejection of the girl. Still, it was unthinkable to suggest that a Gryffindor could marry one of the Royal family of Slytherin. The two states had been on the verge of war for centuries.
He was about to ask why he was confused when Harry's confusion turned to anger. "How could he do that?"
"Someone’s been here, Bella," he growled even before she spoke. He was sniffing the air around the window.
“What do you think I’ve been trying to say? You’re not that dense, Draco. Surely you have some clue?”
This round ended much the way the first had done, though Draco managed to repress the snort of disgust that had caused the final girl to run off last time.
Though he had never flown before, and had been expecting to be a bit scared of being so far above the ground, he found that now he was free of that place, the wind in his hair, and his arms tight around Harry, he couldn’t imagine ever feeling better. This must be freedom. He even managed to relax, the further they got from the tower with no sign of his aunt or Fenrir.
At the Queen’s insistence, the remaining girls lined up on the lawn a few feet from Draco. It made him feel ridiculous. Like he was being put on display. The only thing that kept him from trying to scare them off again was Harry’s hand smoothing over his scales and occasionally running a hand up to scratch at that spot on his head.
Shacklebolt gave him a minor shake of the head and continued. "But you will need someone who can vouch for you, Mister Malfoy. Someone who will be held accountable for your actions should you fail in your duties or break any further laws. Do you know someone who you can stay with?"
With that, he turned and stormed back to his room, locking the door behind him. He would never be free again. Not unless he took freedom for himself. Let Potter have his kingdom. If there was one thing he’d learned in the past few weeks, it was that he could do anything if he was desperate enough. He’d learned enough to take care of himself now. He didn’t need anyone.
Potter appeared early the next morning, far too early, suitcase in hand, a trunk and several boxes floating behind him. He looked as though he’d been given an invitation to stay with the Queen at Buckingham Palace or something. It was enough to nauseate Draco, that pleased expression. As though they hadn’t been forced into letting him stay with them.
The conclusion of One Summer Day, and one possible ruling of Draco's fate.
“Will you take Harry inside? Somewhere in the center of the crowd would be best.”
The conversation he’d had with Harry the night before wore on Draco the next day, so he escaped the final fitting for his next set of robes, and made his way down to the stables to see Harry once more.
want to marry
Draco’s eyes widened even as he took the man’s hand. No wonder he felt it necessary to protect the king’s interest, if he were so personally connected to the king. It must be why he was worried about the way Potter was treating him, as well.
"It's not that, Malfoy. It's just, I never really considered it. I mean, until you started telling me these stories, I never wondered about who you might like. You…well, I didn't exactly expect a starring role. Let alone romantic."
Only once he had a good hold did Potter speak again. “Good. Now, come on.”
Most of Harry’s time as a boy had been spent cleaning the kitchen, or doing deliveries, then he’d become apprenticed to the last stable master, and now…now he was the head of the stables. But even that would not be good enough, Draco knew. Anyone less than a Baron wouldn't do for the Crown Prince, after all. Never mind that he could never care for anyone else the way he cared for Harry.
? He couldn’t even contemplate what would happen then.
Snape, a great alchemist, gave the boy a potion for increasing intelligence. McGonagall, a shape-shifter, gave the boy the ability to change his shape. The great truth-sayer, Skeeter, was next. She gave the boy the ability to always use truth to its best advantage. And after her came Moody, a great warrior-mage, who gave the boy the ability to always be aware of the danger around him. Next was Tonks, who gave him the ability to be whoever he could wish. Flitwick cast a charm that would increase his attractiveness as he grew. Sprout brought him a plant that would grow to shield the palace as he grew, so it would eventually become a part of the castle’s internal protections. Slughorn cast a spell that would give the boy charisma, drawing people to him.
He glanced toward Harry, who was smiling at the other two, and couldn’t help but wonder. If Harry approved, did that mean that he had the same leanings? Or was he just fond of them, so he let it slide?
"It doesn't matter." He stood, and Draco reached out to catch his hand.
"Well, it was a very unusual bird…"
He hurried to pack a bag, then rang for a servant. There were things he would need that he didn’t know how to access here. But a servant would know.
Finally, out of desperation, Draco tried to leave the house. But upon touching the front door, the world flared around him, and he knew no more. He found himself waking in his own bed with a dark shape hovering over him. He couldn't decipher any recognizable features, but this must be who was taking care of him, surely?
The clerk took the papers up to the Minister once they were signed, and after glancing through them, Shacklebolt nodded, then faced Draco. "Very well. I hope, Mister Malfoy, you will take this time to find a better path in life." He glanced at Harry, then Andromeda, then back to Draco. "It seems you have help. If you are wise, you will take the help offered. I sincerely hope we will never meet each other again like this."
Harry shrugged. “Someday, I suppose. I mean, I guess we could just have Kreacher deliver all our meals…” he added with a grin.
This process was repeated with the second and third girls, with no discernable effect. As the last remaining girl approached, Draco couldn’t help but give a sigh, which resulted in another cloud of smoke that enveloped the girl, and with a shriek, she hurried after the girls who had already failed and left.
“Kiss me again?”
"Yes, aunt Bella."
We can easily see that Harry doesn’t believe him. “You already did that, Malfoy. What’s going on?”
“That was the test, Draco. It seems you have yourself a bride.”
Draco was pleased to finally leave them behind, but the image of that boy draping himself over Potter didn’t leave his mind all weekend.
Both boys jumped at that. Draco because he’d forgotten that they weren’t alone, and Harry because the idea was one that simply hadn’t occurred to him. “‘Help’ him?” Dumbledore nodded, and Harry turned back to Draco. “You want me to…kiss you?” he asked softly.
“Ow…” Draco wrinkled his nose, hand going to his hair before he could stop the gesture, rubbing at his scalp in empathy. “That must have hurt.”
Harry lets the silence grow for a long time before answering. “I’m not. So…can we?”
Draco wasn’t sure how to respond to that, or what exactly the other man meant by that, but finally, he nodded. “Yes.”
. Just the thought made him ill.
!” And with that, Draco spun to storm off back to Potter’s shack, then realized he’d never have to sleep in that horrible place again. And that was when something else occurred to him. Potter hadn’t had to sleep there with him. But he had. Why? Draco turned back to look at him. “And what is it that makes me so special that you’d go out of your way to travel back to your kingdom without your guard, on foot? Or sleep in a shack that will likely fall over at the first wind?”
"Who hates me for being here when her daughter isn't! Please!" It wasn't strictly true. Their visit was tense at first, but after some tea, they'd been able to at least focus on what they had in common—Draco's mother. Still, it wasn't the same as talking to someone who actually
Severus seemed completely unimpressed when Draco claimed not to know when or how the parties were arranged, or who organized them.
Lucius was watching him closely. “Do you have a choice for us, Draco? There is no need to put you through this if you are not up to it, and have made your choice, after all.”
He heard the two boys talking, and come down to see. When he'd seen the bigger boy hit the smaller one, he'd scowled. "Why isn't he allowed on the beach?" he asked, stepping out of the shadow of the tree.
Draco’s heart sank. At hearing that the Prince of Gryffindor had been lost for so long, he had hoped, but this man, whoever he was, was not Harry. Harry’s hair was a short mop, while this man’s was long and silken, brushing his shoulders. He even held himself like a prince. Draco knew it had been too good to hope for.
It took a few moments before Draco could put into words what exactly was wrong, but finally, he looked up at his friend. “Have you had your first?” he asked.
But the problem was, Draco had been so wrapped up in being upset about Harry not being anywhere he could find him, he’d had no thought as to what his new power might be. “I…” He glanced at Harry, as though to ask him what he should do, when something clicked inside him, and he smiled. He turned back to his father. “I’ll show you. And if it leads me directly to Harry?”
“Right. You were just…running…in your dream. Really vigorously. Against my leg.”
"Oh, shut up, Malfoy."
Prince Draco has refused every suitor who has come to court him. So his father betrothes him to the next man to ask for his hand--a poor beggar who goes by the name of Potter.
“Not sure. Might just go long to try to get as far as we can…”
“What is it, Draco?”
“Oh? I’ll have to tell the king about that.”
Draco had to take several minutes to regain what little of his dignity he could manage to scrabble together before going back inside. And then, once inside, he was barely able to restrain himself from telling his parents that he was done and wanted to go to bed. After all, they’d hardly accept his answer if they hadn’t seen him even dancing with anyone since coming back in.
And Draco’s mother didn’t seem to be helping in the least. She kept inviting Potter to have supper with the family. Worse, she kept smiling at the git and chatting with him as though he were any other guest they might have. After their second meal together, he pulled her aside to ask her why. “He is a guest, Draco. One must always treat guests well. Surely I’ve taught you that?”
“Were you sleeping with anyone else last night?” he responded, the chuckle there just on the edge of his words.
"Not yet, Fenny. I want him to prove himself."
“Mother…” She raised an eyebrow, and Draco sighed. “Yes, mother,” he said, sitting up straighter, then spreading his napkin across his lap as his breakfast appeared. He dug into his food, trying desperately to ignore his mother and Potter’s chatting.
Sirius made a face. “Narcissa. The Prince’s mother.”
"Never mind. It doesn't matter, Malfoy. You're just…" He met Draco's eyes. "What are you doing? What do you expect to get out of this little story, anyway?"
“No. Just…” He swallowed. “Obviously, this was a mistake. It’s not helping.” In fact, it was making Draco rather distinctly uncomfortable, but he wasn’t about to tell Harry—Potter! When had he started thinking of him as Harry? He shook his head to clear it. “My parents are probably expecting me…”
Draco glanced at his bed, then moved to it, pulling out the journal and settling on the bed before opening it once more, and noticed a gap in the pages. He opened the journal to those pages and found a letter in his mother's handwriting.
The first few minutes, the two of them exchanged nothing more than kisses and touches through their clothes. But as soon as Harry began to try to undress him, Draco’s inexperience caught up with him, and he began to panic. This was something he’d never even attempted before. Even more than a peck on a hand or cheek was beyond his experiences.
"Oooh, threats from the Hero of the Wizarding World. Here I thought you could sink no lower. Was the rumor I heard true? Did you formally break up with the Weaslette?"
"Um… I wouldn’t mind, but…There’s no door. So unless you can fly…"
But apparently, Harry knew. “What? That he loves a man, rather than a woman? What’s so deviant about that? Love is love, majesty.”
So he was quite surprised when he found himself asking, "You thought I was dead?"
"Well, Headmistress—"
He towed the load home on his back, moaning with new pain in his back by the time he got to the cottage, and realized it was already noon. How on earth would he get it all done in time? Perhaps there were spells that he could use to help him? He’d not used his wand while on the road because Potter had forbidden it, but surely now… All he could do was try.
It was true. Harry’s muscular build was quite different from Draco’s slender one. He’d be lucky if he managed even to get an arm through a sleeve.
to teach you a lesson?"
“I was. And…my father wasn’t too pleased with me…”
Snape stepped forward. "Headmistress, this is intolerable. These students have been breaking the rules of this school, causing other students to miss classes, or to fail in completing their assignments in time."
Draco blinked rapidly, barely fighting back the prickling in his eyes. This was utterly horrific. He couldn’t live this way! “May…I send a letter to my father?”
“But…we’re meant to use those for our…wedding,” he managed to get out. “I’m a prince. We should be having an extravagant feast and celebration!”
Once there was a boy who had always been obsessed with bettering his rival, until the day when his family’s survival overrode everything else. But then the rival became obsessed with the first boy, and between the two, obsession slowly grew, until they were finished with their schooling, in the real world, and seemed to separate forever.
Lucius tried to let the smile calm his growing anxieties. Draco just shuddered.
“Oh, yeah. I think ‘Potter’ and I need to have a bit of a talk, too.”
Feeling his cheeks heat even more, Draco huffed. “And what makes you think you were anything more than a convenient body, hm?”
“You can’t go home, Draco. You saw that, right?”
“Didn’t what, Potter? You hardly gave me a chance to do anything.”
Draco saw Weasley at the end of the hall, glaring at him as well. Granger looked ready to hex him, and Potter didn’t look much more pleasant than the other two. “Can we talk somewhere more private?” Draco asked.
See now how Harry flushes. Not the usual action of a happy man. But he manages a smile for his rival. “Yes. Thank you. How are you doing these days?”
“Don’t you ever get bored of being here?”
It took Draco a few minutes to remember, his flustered state bringing very different memories to mind. "I…think it was the one where we…no, wait, that was later…Oh…I remember. I was living in this tower…"
"But you couldn't have been more than what, five?"
"No."
“You said ‘Harry.’”
Raising an eyebrow and fixing his father with the most imperious stare he had ever managed in his life, Draco sighed. “Yes, father. I had noticed. But, as
Despite himself, Draco winced at the slap, and even more, at the threat. If the parties didn't happen again, he might never know who his mystery boyfriend was. "You wouldn't," he said, but he knew Snape could hear the desperation in his voice now.
“Well look at the bloody thing! I think it’s imprinted on Harry…”
So it was Draco Malfoy found himself in a new home, surrounded by beautiful things, but always alone save for the lone house-elf who came to visit him every day.
Potter's words rang in his ears until Draco was sure they would drive him mad; suddenly an image formed in his memory. Two boys, one twice the girth and several inches taller than the other. The larger shoved the smaller boy to the ground. "You have to wait here, Potter. You aren't allowed on the beach. Mum said so."
“The audience hall is this way,” Draco told her. It was easier thinking of him like that for now. At least until they obtained his mother’s permission. If she should deny Draco this, he wasn’t sure what he would do, but he was going to do everything in his power to keep that from happening.
Draco slowly made his way back towards the palace, his mind lost in thought as he walked. It wasn’t until he reached for the door that he realized something was wrong. That wasn’t his arm. He held it up, blinking at the claws and scales that moved and shifted in the sunlight as he turned his hand. What had that man done to him?
"Clerk, if you will get her signature and the prisoner's as well, we will be able to release him into your care, Mrs Tonks."
Draco nodded. "Well… I'm starting to. I wrote down ideas for more, but I wanted to make sure I got what I already told you written down, too. Something to think about when I'm bored, or can't sleep. Helps."
Draco shook his head, eyes widening as the full memory emerged.
Their faces were so close together now, and all it took was a slight shift, and Draco’s lips were brushing against Potter’s. Potter responded with a soft sigh, pressing back, but letting Draco lead the kiss. Draco opened his mouth, and found Potter echoing the move. His tongue slipped into the open and willing mouth, and it was all Draco could do not to groan. He pressed against Potter, the kiss increasing in intensity with every second that passed.
“Potter,” Blaise greeted him with a bright grin.
. “Potter, please…can’t I have a bit to eat? Or to drink? Anything?”
“It wasn’t
“No, that’s all right. I’ll be right up,” Draco said with a smile, then cast a quick levitation charm on himself to make himself float, then used the edges of the mattresses to pull himself up to the top. He didn’t think to wonder what his mother was up to. He was more intent on seeing more of those green eyes and full lips again. Finally, he pulled himself over the edge of the bed, then settled next to Harry.
Harry nodded cautiously.
The kiss stretched out until one of them moaned. Draco wasn’t sure which of them it was, but it woke him from the dream-like state, and he pulled back to look at Harry. “Harry?”
“He’s hardly likely to send you back to the place he saved you from, Lucius… Do calm down. You’ll give yourself a heart attack. I’m certain it won’t be as bad as you seem to think.”
asked, Draco! You demanded. You whined! But…you never asked.” Potter looked sad.
Draco didn't know what to say. Why would Harry bother? He would probably be sent away to Azkaban, after all. Draco said the only thing he could think to say. "Thanks." He tucked it under his pillow before moving back to his bench.
Draco didn’t like the sound of that. “If what, Potter? Go on. Spit it out.”
When he finally did, he didn't say what Draco expected. "Are you gay? I mean…" He shook his head. "Never mind. It's none of my business."
"No, it's not. That's not what I meant. Sometimes… contact with someone who experienced the same moment can help break the spell." He held out his hand, meeting Harry's eyes.
There was once a King and Queen who wanted nothing more than a child. They tried so many things, but finally, just as they were about to give up, an old and very powerful wizard offered them help in conceiving their child. The couple gratefully accepted, and soon the Queen became pregnant, and they and their people celebrated.
He alighted near the tower, and Harry slid off quickly. “Hello?” Several of the guards turned, then gasped at the sight of the dragon, so close by.
Draco managed not to let his relief show at that. Snape didn’t know. The relief gave him courage. “I assure you, Snape, if I marry Princess Harriet, that will not happen. I have fought too hard to find an appropriate bride. I would not be so stupid to throw everything away.” And then, before Snape could continue to berate him, he turned away and made his way to his own rooms.
Something seemed to light in Weasley’s eyes, and his lips twitched. “Draco. We should get back to work if we’re to get this all to the palace by nightfall, though.”
Draco glared at him. “I noticed. Exactly what potion did you give her to make her so docile?”
Draco pushed the last of his food away, no longer hungry. "So… Snape really was a spy, then?"
"I saw how bad the headache was yesterday. Had one of my own. It's enough to make me wonder. Maybe you should have made excuses and stayed home?"
The words left Draco stunned, not sure how to respond. "Thank you," he finally said. "It means a lot to me."
Just remember that.
"I hurt so many people, Pansy. No one wants that for a lover. In a lover." He scowled. Especially if they were who he hoped.
Draco makes his way into the small room, and we can see he is uneasy, but there seems more spring in his step than there had been when he first arrived upon the scene. When Harry returns, Draco is settled in a chair in front of the fire. Harry approaches him uncertainly, but finally manages to find words. “Could…we start again, maybe?”
Draco's voice through the door is not at all welcoming. Not that any of us should have expected that. “Go away, Potter. I don’t care what kind of inanity you’ve thought up to make us friends, it won’t work.”
“I said hai’llow. It’s easier than saying all those syllables, don’t you know?” she said with a grin as she approached. “Are you from the town?”
At the word ‘friend,’ Draco felt as though he’d been stabbed, and he had to stand up and look away. “Right. But these…strangers apparently mean more?”
Draco was glad his blush couldn’t show through his scales. He nodded, then nuzzled Harry with his nose.
"It’s okay, Draco. This time, when I leave, you’re coming with me."
“Nope,” he said with a grin.
His father was looking at him with new eyes, at least. But it was his mother who spoke. “Draco?” she asked quietly, approaching him, her hand extended. Draco blinked, then nodded sadly, leaning into the caress. “What…” She stopped abruptly, her eyes wide, then turned to her husband. “The curse. The prophesy…Lucius…”
Harry didn’t answer, and Draco still didn’t pull away as he leaned in and pressed his lips to Draco’s. It wasn’t a long kiss. Or even much of anything, really. Just a brush of lips, then they were gone, and Harry was on his feet. “Sorry. I…”
"Have you talked to her? My mother, I mean."
Draco knew what that meant. It meant if Fenrir arrived and the smell was at least as strong, if not stronger, that worse than what Bella could do herself would likely happen. He swallowed. "Yes, aunt Bella," he said softly. The two vanished once more, and Draco curled into a ball on his bed. Could things get any worse?
“Food?” Draco asked, ignoring the question for now, and stumbling over to where Potter sat.
When Potter didn't speak again, Draco held out his tray to him. "So do I get my question?"
"I'm glad you see me in such a positive way," Harry finally said.
* * *
But there was no choice. If I failed, not only would father not be freed, but mother would be at risk as well. He would destroy us all, merely to show he could.
Draco shook his head. "Stories. Surely this can't be the most exciting job of all time. I can offer a way to make the time go faster. For every day you come visit. What do you think?" He knew it wasn't really much, which was why he'd offered the contract first. It was the more important bit anyway.
Draco calmed, then nodded. "Fine." He took the tray from Potter, then settled on the bench with it next to him and picked up the sandwich. It wasn't high cuisine, but it was better than he'd expected it to be. "So when?"
“How would you know? You were asleep.”
"Never mind," Draco scowled. He didn't want pity. "What do you want? Beyond absolution, that is, because I can't say I'm feeling up to offering it right now."
Draco decided to plan the next gathering for the middle of the week. Enough time to let Snape relax a little—not that Snape ever relaxed, but at least lull him into a false sense of security—and still far enough from the weekend the professors wouldn't expect it yet.
Oh, that was not good. If Severus Snape knew there was no Princess Harriet… Still, they would just have to brave it out. Draco knew he’d only get one chance at this. If his mother found out before…
Draco nodded, then sighed, letting out a small puff of smoke and nodded again. He’d go. But only halfway. Just out of sight of the gate. He didn’t want to scare people, after all.
Draco turned to Harry, placing a finger on his lips. “Trust me?”
Potter pulled back, blinking. "Woah. Sorry, Draco. I just meant…" He sighed and shook his head at Draco's glare. "So…what was the next about?"
Taunting was the last thing on Draco's mind. He couldn't shake the feeling the name was familiar. "You… talk about him a lot, Potter?" Maybe he'd read the name somewhere.
“I am not speaking of her, you idiotic boy! I am speaking of you. You think you are so clever and so secretive. Do you not know how open your little secret is? Half the kingdom knows your predilection for men.”
“Your family owes me, Malfoy. And if your son is to have any future in our world, he’d do well to cultivate new friends. I can help him with that.”
Draco might be upset, but Ginny seems to believe that finally all is right in the world. She plots and imagines, talking to her Harry every day about their plans (her plans, of course) for their upcoming wedding, and failing to notice his ever-increasing discontent.
“No,” Harry said softly.
Shacklebolt and the others looked shocked at the suggestion. "Did Malfoy ask you to speak for him, Mister Potter?" Shacklebolt asked him after a moment.
“Please,” Potter said, nodding slowly.
Draco met Harry's eyes, and Harry gave him a slight nod, then stepped forward to stand beside him.
Have you heard the legend of Pandora? The one about the girl who opens the box and lets all the evil out into the world? That's me. I'm her. I'm Pandora. I'm the one who let the evil into Hogwarts. The evil which caused Dumbledore's death.
Draco brought a hand to Harry’s cheek. “Look at me. Please. Want to see this. I’ve been dreaming about it for…” He smiled as he realized just how short a time it had been. “A week. Well…sort of. Please don’t look away now?”
Draco looked up at him and smiled. "It’s good to meet you, Harry. I’m Draco."
"Yes, about the spells. I witnessed at least one use of the Cruciatus curse myself, sir. And though Draco will not say as much, I believe he was given no choice not to refuse by his Master, sir."
meant to me.”
Even after the third reiteration, the thought still made Draco’s head spin, and he had been staring at Potter dumbly for the minutes that had followed the original request. Even now, it still made no sense. “That’s ridiculous, Potter. Why would you want to stay at the Manor? What about Black’s place? Surely you want to stay there?”
“P-potter. He…lives in the cottage just outside the wall of the palace.”
As they made their way through the halls, Draco's worry grew. They didn't head towards the Headmistress's office, but downstairs. Were they going to the dungeons? Or worse, would he be given to an Auror to be tried once more? Had Draco made it through the Death Eater trials only to be arrested for this?
being nervous.
The man halted in the doorway, then turned back to him. "Trust me. You wouldn't want that." Before Draco could say otherwise, the man apparated away.
"A journal?" Draco asked, turning it over in his hands before looking up at him. "Why?"
Draco hurried to the bars. "And father?"
"You have a treehouse?" He grinned at Draco. "Can we go up there?"
Draco was playing in the treehouse in the rented cottage. Mother was upset they were renting, but father had insisted. That probably meant his usual way of buying temporary vacation homes hadn't worked. Draco wasn't entirely sure what that meant, but he'd heard uncle Sev accuse father of using his magic, and he'd been angry, so it must have been bad.
Instead, watch him walk the London streets until he arrives at Harry’s flat. And look at the shocked look on Harry’s face when he sees who is at the door. “Draco?”
Remus sighed. “Well, that went well. I’m honestly amazed she didn’t have us thrown from the castle.”
"Yeah. So… did you have a story?"
She sighed. “Very well. But don’t expect me to wait too long, Draco. This cannot go on forever.”
"Oh. So she decided she didn't want you any more?"
"No, wait," he said, trying to catch the man's hand. "Please I know you have no reason to trust me. You think I betrayed your trust, but that list… I made it before our agreement. I swear it. I wanted nothing more than to know who you were. But not at the expense of losing you. I couldn't bear it."
“Of course not. I’m going to sell it all. Well…except for the beds…”
Stumbling to his new feet, Draco looked around. Now that he was more aware of his new form, he realized he was trapped in the garden. His form was too large to fit through the door into the palace, and he’d be more likely to knock over the hedges than fit between them. So there was only one other possibility. He shifted to look back into the fountain, hoping that he was the sort of dragon that could fly, and focused on flexing his shoulders, looking for some sort of flicker of movement behind his head in the water.
worked, because he could feel Harry’s lips against his cheek, and then he was shifting his face and pressing very human lips to Harry’s, his hands going around Harry’s neck as he shifted to settle in his lap properly.
Harry got a stubborn look on his face. “Well, they’ll have to get used to it, won’t they?”
"Andromeda Black Tonks, Minister."
Harry nodded. "You know my visions, sir."
to have another of the bloody things, and easier, because as time went on, the dreams were becoming increasingly more attractive to him somehow. The idea of those green eyes on him, that smile…
"The kingdom just over the border from here, actually. I was just visiting your kingdom here. They told me not to use this path, but it’s the quickest route home, and I’m very resourceful, so I wasn’t too worried. May I come up?"
Harry was staring at him when he finished. “We…you…I mean…we…?”
Draco glared at him, then looked back at Harry, hopeful that now he would finally get help.
"Get it over with, Draco. Like ripping off a plaster. It's for the best. I mean, obviously you want this to go somewhere, don't you?"
It was another long night.
Draco pulled his hand away. He didn’t get up, though.
"You. The thorn in my side, the light to my dark, and vice versa. You are…" He smirked. "Well, really, you're the only proper choice for a Malfoy."
Draco’s eyes widened. How had he not managed to think of that? As soon as she gave her blessing, everything would be out of her hands. He would become king upon marriage, and while she might be disgruntled about it, she would hardly have the power to do anything about it. “Blaise! You’re brilliant! But…even so…where do we find someone who would be willing, even for a few days, to pretend to be a woman?”
“If I do not see him within a week, I will return,” Harry warns him.
The two boys played in the treehouse until Draco's father came out to call him in for supper.
The problem was, Draco thought to himself as he walked in the garden later, this did seem as though it might drag on at least that long. He simply could see no way around his difficulties. He refused to marry a girl, and his mother would never agree to his marrying a man. It was a perplexing conundrum.
The place that Potter called his home looked as though it might have once been the home to very over-indulged pigs, but the creatures had moved out when it began to fall apart. The walls were spattered with mud where there weren’t holes most of the way through the plaster and wood. It was teetering to one side, as though a light breeze might knock it over. Worse, it looked like the place wouldn’t be large enough to hold more than one room. “That’s your house?” he asked Potter, horrified.
But Harry didn’t say no. In fact, he didn’t say anything. He just leaned in and pressed his lips to Draco’s muzzle.
Snape lead the way down the stairs, past the last dozen or so hopefuls who had wanted to meet Prince Draco, and to the doors at the far end of the hall that led to the gardens. “He is waiting for you out there,” he said, opening the door for the prince. “I will do my best to give you as much time to become—acquainted—as you can before your father interrupts,” he said.
Horrified at the words, Draco looked at Potter, who had already curled up under his patchy cloak, seemingly unconcerned. He’d thought the man was kidding that he’d make him tow it all the way. Apparently not. Already his arms felt like they were on fire. He wasn’t sure he’d be able to survive towing it even one more mile, let alone all the way to his new home.
"No, Headmistress, but—"
Draco nodded. “Of course, father.” He turned to Snape. “Lead the way.”
Harry glanced at him before meeting the King’s gaze. “Yes, sire?”
The King’s lips narrowed at this, and he gathered himself for a moment before responding. “You are the heir to the throne. I hope you realize that love must come second to duty?”
It would have been funny to see the expression on his face if it hadn’t been so serious. “Who could I trust the way I trust you, Harry?” Draco put his hand on Harry’s arm, wanting to keep that contact now that he’d had a taste.
For a few minutes, Draco did nothing more than swoop and circle in the air, but then a shout caught his attention, and he remembered his problem. Changing back. He looked down at the palace, so small below, then dove down to see what was going on.
Draco sighed, then let the matter drop. As it was, he did his best to ignore Potter as much as he could at any meals he appeared at, unless Potter asked him questions directly—which he seemed to do with alarming frequency. Some nights he had to go flying just to clear his head after. And even then, he worried he’d run into the git. It was absolutely unbearable.
It wasn't a lot, but it was a beginning.
Draco was certain the guards would drag him back off to his cell before they returned, but the Minister and the other two men returned right before that would have happened. After arranging his papers, he called the court to order, then faced Draco. "Draco Malfoy, after due consideration of your case, we believe your actions were all performed under duress, and at an age where you could not fully be accountable for your own actions. As such, your sentence will be commuted to community service for the next five years, or until such time as repairs to the damaged buildings and businesses have been completed to this court's satisfaction."
Moreover, someone who could convince his aunt he might be worth saving. That was a job all on its own. Unless they knew her well. She was much too much like his mother--Black pigheadedness which wouldn't let them believe anything other than what they already believed.
“Oh!” Draco could see a large range of emotion pass across Potter’s face, hope prominent among them. “Okay,” he said with a smile. “Where?”
As if sensing his doubts, Harry stood up and walked to his side, then took his hand. “You do still want this, right?”
"Thank you, Harry," he said, nodding at him. "We will discuss the case. There will be a recess while we determine our judgment. The Prisoner will stay, but all others are welcome to speak or leave, if they wish." He dropped the gavel on the desktop, then stood and led the other two men from the room to talk.
“Do you understand that this cannot be more than friendship between two future kings?”
She came across the lawn to where he was sitting, then glared at him. “Do you truly want to be a dragon for the rest of your life, Draco?” He shook his head. “Then please allow me to do what I can to help you,” she said, her eyes slightly narrowed. He nodded, then watched as she moved back across to the girls.
“Trust me when I say yes,” Draco answered through clenched teeth.
Both Malfoy men looked at her aghast. “Yes, Narcissa. But…living with us?” Lucius asked. “It makes no sense. Not unless the boy is trying to find a way to trap us somehow?”
Once the courtroom quieted, Shacklebolt spoke. His quite voice still filled the room, even without a spell.
“Do you…like guys?”
“Here is fine.”
Snape pushed Draco to the front of the hall, stopping him right in front of the Head table, where McGonagall and several of the Professors ate. She gazed down at the two of them for a moment, then focused on Snape. "Professor Snape, what is this about?"
But why is it that Draco seems so upset by this sight? Surely he should be happy, or at least care not at all, given that he was in such a rush to get away from Harry?
Afterwards, he pointedly ignored Harry each time he came to watch the cell. He deflected any conversation, whether about their day together, or anything else, even when it became the teasing banter with Potter. He couldn't handle talking to him at all. He wanted this over with, and Harry couldn't be the simple distraction he'd wanted, no matter the subject.
Neither slept all night.
Draco couldn’t see the expression on his father’s face, but the huff told him easily enough that Lucius thought this a waste of time. Still, he took his son’s arm and guided him slowly to the door.
Wife? Draco sputtered at the offending word, though he said nothing aloud, just glared at Potter. He also noticed that the man wasn’t about to make a move to clean anything. Apparently dishes were to be one of his regular tasks... He did little more than pick up everything and dump them in the water-bucket for now, then collapse on his own bed. The day hadn’t been as bad as the previous days had been, but even so…
“Please don’t, Draco?”
"What, so you can escape by tricking someone who doesn't know you the way that I do?"
wonder. You can’t stop me.”
Draco closed his eyes, hating the memory. "He was there."
Draco had kissed before. Had done a good deal more, in fact. But this was like nothing he’d ever experienced before, and without his own urgings, he found his own hands going up to thread in Potter’s hair, pressing against him as they kissed.
“All right. Come on. There’s another sitting room upstairs. We can use that.” He led the way, and Draco followed, trying not to notice Weasley’s increased glares as he passed by.
Diagon Alley was rather quiet, as it was a weekday, and most people were working, so Draco was able to easily make his way to Quality Quidditch Supplies. The problem was, the latest brooms were all sub-standard compared to Potter’s. So how was Draco to best him if he couldn’t even catch up with him? It was ridiculous.
However, at Draco’s words, the man turned grey eyes on him, glowering down at him for a long time before he spoke. He certainly didn’t seem the kindly sort. And he was almost as old as the man who had directed him out here. “No. I’m not. He’s waiting for you.”
“Harry! You made it.” Draco moved to his friend’s side then looked wide-eyed at what he was wearing. “Where did you get that?”
The image that looked out at Draco from the surface of the fountain wasn’t grizzly or scary, but it most definitely wasn’t his own face. It was a sleek silver snout with huge blue eyes rimmed with thicker silver scales that flashed with just a touch of gold in the sunlight. The mouth was filled with rather large, sharp teeth, and a pointed tongue that snaked out in discomfited annoyance. How had the man managed this?
“What? She’s very attractive!” Harry said, scowling.
They fell into a pattern. His host would generally join him Tuesdays and Thursdays, and after a short while, he began joining him on Sundays as well. They kept their talk on the news of the day or the latest potion Draco was working on. It was comfortable.
But Draco wasn't going to let him off the hook that easily. "No. You just meant what, Potter?"
Draco paled. "I had not completed them on my own, sir."
But that didn't mean the bloke at the masquerades who he hoped. And the worry it might be someone else kept Draco from being able to admit his identity to the other boy at least as difficult as not wanting to hear the other boy's disgust when he found out who he'd spent his weekends with.
He felt his cheeks warm, but nodded. “You know my interest in our history, mother.”
“Zabini. Hey. And Draco. I didn’t know you were here.”
She smiled. “Hm…well, it might to me.” She turned to Lucius. “I say we let him. If my assumption is correct, he’ll be very controllable. And we could always use the favour of a hero, couldn’t we?”
“Like this morning…” Draco muttered to himself.
, but…” He held out his hand. “Sir Ronald Weasley. The head of the king’s personal guard.”
Draco stepped forward. “Of course, Harry.” A thrill went up his back at the name, and even more so when he set his hand on Harry’s back. “I apologize. It was probably a long ride. Should I send for some refreshments while you change?”
“And what makes you say that, Snape?”
The Minister frowned at him. "Mister Potter has asked to speak with you privately in one of the interview rooms."
But Harry kept going, as though one exclamation of horror hadn't been enough. “And I snuck into your bed? Why would I do that?”
Startled, Draco stared at him, not sure how to respond. "Oh."
Draco nodded. "I'm turning into a Hufflepuff, I swear," he sighed. "I just wish…"
Harry met his eyes. "I…I mean, I don't think I am."
He made his way down to the courtyard to see if he could find Weasley, and was astonished when he saw his father’s guards ride into the yard. He knew that his father couldn’t be too far behind, and the thought lightened his heart. He smiled and greeted the guards by name, not even noticing the shocked looks the men were giving him in his delight that he would soon be able to return home.
“Oh, please…I can barely keep going as it is!”
The Wizarding World seemed truly lost, and each day after grew darker, with new and more horrific acts being played in front of my eyes. And all I could think was it was my fault. I caused this. I was the one to blame.
"Like you care, Malfoy," Harry said, settling against the wall. Draco knew it had to be uncomfortable, but guards weren't exactly supposed to be comfortable, they were supposed to be alert.
Draco doesn't seem startled at all at Harry's acting as though this is the first time they have met. He smiles, his fingers curling around Harry’s hand. “Draco. Malfoy. Very good to meet you…Harry.”
The other man smiled, then pulled a small stick from his back that he enlarged into a broom. "I’ll be right up!"
“And then?”
Harry glared at him. "Shut up, Malfoy. I told you, I'm not interested in bantering with you today."
Draco saw Harry’s eyes flash at that. “I think, majesty, that when all seemed lost, Sirius and Remus were the two most likely to stand by me, and they are the reason I am even standing here today. The rest is just so much noise. What do I care what they do in the privacy of their rooms?”
It all started at a celebration of the ending of a war. It had been a year, and their world was healing. Both boys had taken part in the war, and both had been on opposite sides, but both had ended up on the same side at the very end, and so both were at the celebration.
The wizard laughed. “You should have thought of this before you sent out your invitations, highness,” he said with a cruel smile. “You have your heir, Lucius. For eighteen years. And at the end of that time, the boy will simply waste away.” There was a flash of light, and the Prince began to cry.
Turned quickly to turn to his father. “Look at him. He couldn’t even be bothered to change before coming to see us, father. He is hardly a worthy spouse for your only heir.”
The words seemed to have a cheering effect on Harry, and he smiled. “What? You actually want to miss out on having all the attention on you? Don’t tell me…the world has come to an end?”
Shacklebolt frowned. "And what age were you when you received his Mark?"
“Please…” He couldn’t think for the pain, and Harry was the only thing keeping him from flying apart.
Draco smirked. “It’ll do a lot more in a minute, Potter.”
His wife smiled. “For a chance to be queen? What woman in her right mind would not? We will simply make certain that only those we hand-pick get the chance.” Her smile turned triumphant, and Draco’s heart sank. He knew, no matter what, that he was not going to be pleased, whatever might happen.
“You liked it?” he asked softly.
The other man frowned at the reaction. “And…who is your ‘betrothed?’”
to happen. What he wasn't expecting was for the large boy to vanish with a pop the way adults did when they apparated.
“There are a few new guests,” Narcissa said with a smile. “Perhaps one of them…?”
Complaining got him nowhere. The elf did what it was there to do and left.
Draco glared at him. "Get out, Potter!" If he hadn't already given him the tray, he'd have thrown it at him.
“But…can you see their thoughts, or through their eyes, or what?”
He dressed and walked downstairs, only to find Potter chatting amiably with his mother. It was unconscionable. Potter was taking everything from him! His home, his mother, his club, his bed… He viciously clamped down on the bit of his brain that assured him that it wouldn’t mind waking up to that rumpled hair and husky voice each morning.
The solution came to him in the form of a six-foot, two-inch young man with long black hair and golden eyes and skin. This vision’s name was Blaise, and he was Draco’s personal guard. Upon seeing his prince’s dejected countenance, he moved to walk next to him. “Another?” he asked him as they passed the serpent-headed fountain at the centre of the garden.
Harry gives Draco a new way of seeing their past, and then Draco begins a new story.
"No, sir. I do not believe he wished to offer any defense today. But I would like to offer one for him, if I may be allowed?"
“Eighteen years, actually,” Snape agreed. “But one family member was smuggled out of the country. And has now been found. And he would like to ally himself with your kingdom, sire. He knows that if he is to restore his kingdom, allies will be vital.”
And so Draco did, he surrounded himself with other alphas and learned to be one of them by observing them. He observed his father and Bellatrix, he observed the other children and their parents so well that by the time he was at Hogwarts, he had it down to an art.

Potter, in a manner that wasn’t exactly the same, also spent his time alone. Rebuilding and generally shying away from the attention everyone wanted to give him. At least this part was something he knew, Potter did not like his fame. While at first he had thought Potter to be an attention seeker, somewhere around 3
Hades eventually agreed and so we brought him here. But by then the Prophecy had already been made and it was quickly after we took him in that we discovered his powers. He would get excited and the air would fill with mist. Every time he remembered his mom he would create static in the air. We quickly came to the conclusion that he was Zeus’ son.
Still smirking, Draco tilted his head to one side. “Everyone has their secrets, Potter. It’s rude to ask. But… maybe you’d learn how to handle a knife properly in potions if you weren’t so…
what he needed right in this very moment.

but he had answered all of Draco’s emails up until this point.
"Sorry I scared you," Harry mumbled a bit sheepishly into Draco's hair. "Just wanted…just thought it would be a nice surprise to wake up to. In my defence, it looked a lot cuter in my head."
how happy he was that Harry was home again so he wouldn’t have to spend Christmas all alone.
A sharp pain shot through him like a spear, and Harry tried to bite his tongue to not cry out
it was true, he hated being alone; he couldn’t deny that. He hated being without Harry. He’d thought it many times, but yes, he absolutely

something,” he said, putting both hands on the table and leaning forward, so they almost were uncomfortably close. Ron wrinkled his nose at Draco’s Firewhiskey-breath, but he remained still on his chair, not flinching. “You’re not worried because you know something, don’t you Weasley?”
that Harry was in his bedroom and not miles away.
“Perhaps,” Draco pursed his lips. “However, that’s not the point. Potter’s dead, that’s the point. That’s why you’re here.”
Ron Weasley lay sprawled out on Draco's sofa, snoring heavily in his slumber. Ozzy had curled up close, sleeping with his head tucked under Ron's chin. Midnight lay on his stomach while Dante was nowhere to be seen. Cats and a sleeping Ron was the type of disgustingly adorable image that would have had Hermione Granger's heart beating extra fast, and Draco would have scowled and sent Weasley home—had he seen it. It just so happens that he hadn't,
Draco squeezed the edges of the bathroom sink and breathed out, a long deep breath. Well, what choice did he have, really? He might just
"Later." Draco's head pounded, suddenly remembering how much he had been drinking with Weaselbee last night. He buried his face in the crook of Harry's neck and closed his eyes. He was still angry, and he would come up with revenge, but
Harry had absolutely no idea where Draco had learnt healing spells. They hadn’t covered that yet in any class, he was sure of it. He really wanted to ask but didn’t dare to interrupt Draco’s spell-work. He didn’t wish to repeat second year again or something similar to it.
He wanted to protest; it was
"Splendid," Draco said, pursing his lips. He wasn't thrilled —at all—and only about a nanosecond away from crossing his arms defiantly over his chest or flip a table, whatever came first.
Then Weasley asked: “Why am I here, Malfoy?”
"Anyway," Weasley continued, "You press down on these keys here, and letters show at the screen. Better than any owl, and a hell of a lot faster. It's not so bad. You'll get the hang of it, I'm sure…"

A lot had been shared over a span of many, many hours. Harry was lying if he said he wasn’t exhausted too; he wondered if he had talked so much in his entire life before. A lot has changed between them. Before this talk, Draco had been Malfoy and now… he wasn’t anymore. Well, Draco refused to use Harry’s first name still, but he hoped that they would get there…eventually. That was the plan at least, Harry thought. That was what he wanted.
“Weasley?” He began before he realised he had opened his mouth. “A question.”
but he had been working when he'd replied too, and that had never been a problem. But now, it had been quiet for a while, for too many days for Draco's liking. Potter hadn't given him any reason as to why Draco's inbox was so empty either, and if he was busy, he should have let Draco know. That was only reasonable. That's what anybody with a brain would do.
Except that the person Draco furiously held at wand point wasn’t Weasley. At all.
"Here's how it works," Harry continued. "I'll write something to Ron, and within seconds he'll get it in his inbox. Just like with an owl, but it doesn't take days. Watch."
answer that question.
Harry sighed. This conversation wasn’t taking the direction that he wanted. “What the hell, Draco.”
Draco’s hair was lighter than everyone else’s in the dimly lit classroom; it shone so brightly and caused Harry’s stomach to flip. Draco bit down on his bottom lip when he concentrated—
Draco turned out to be a very difficult and impatient student, and Harry scolded himself for not realising how it was going to be. Of course, he was, he was Draco and apparently all sorts of dramatic. It wasn't that he didn't understand; he was just unwilling, it seemed like. Very unwilling.
“Sit still and shut up,” Draco ordered him, not looking up from what he was doing. Harry looked down and let out a shocked breath; Draco was
lightingbolt80(at)maildotcom
If anybody had been there when Ron Weasley arrived at Draco's apartment two hours ago, they would have been witnesses to a very panic-stricken Draco Malfoy who couldn't let go of the thought that Harry was dead. He was driving Ron slowly but surely insane. Not that Ron didn't understand why Draco reacted like this, but the truth was, the redhead was in a predicament of his own, and he couldn't tell Draco Malfoy that. So he needed to be very creative, but it wasn't easy with how dramatic Draco was.
“No, you two are not to leave this classroom,” he said with a sneer. Snape’s black eyes wandered around the classroom. Harry started saying that he didn’t need anyone to accompany him, he was fine, though when he met Ron’s worried eyes over Hermione’s head, he realised how dizzy he was starting to feel.
Their language was becoming too foul. It wasn’t appropriate; Draco and Harry were getting close to thirty and had mouths like fourteen-year-olds. Harry spent a lot of time with Ron and had adopted his language, his casual way with words. And since Harry lived with Draco, Draco, in turn, had adopted Harry’s language and they were now throwing around profanities like nothing else.
Ha, joke’s on Weasley because Draco
“What?” Ron said, turning his eyes on him.
“What? Merlin, no, I didn’t! Didn’t mean to…to violate you, why’d you say that?!” Harry said, horrified, blushing an ugly shade of red. “Look, Draco, I can explain everything!”
And now he needed Weasley’s help.
Draco turned around, stopping in his tracks. Harry squeezed his eyes shut, quietly wishing Draco away.
A few moments of stillness passed. Then, Draco lifted his head, heat returning in his stormy grey eyes as he demanded answers to a billion questions all at once.
No time like the present.
“For Merlin’s sake, couldn’t you two have waited until I’ve gone home?!” A complaining voice called from the doorway. Draco reluctantly tore himself away from Harry, who quickly moved his hand away from Draco’s thigh. Draco lifted his head to glare at Weasley, who stood with sleep-tousled red hair at the threshold holding Ozzy in his arms.
So, the only logical reason why Harry had been so silent was that he was dead. There was really no other explanation. Well, except for going missing of course. Draco had a very vivid image in his head of Harry getting kidnapped and was locked away somewhere without any Internet connection or his stupid Muggle computer-device.
cat, after all.
But that was a question Draco Lucius Malfoy didn’t want to think about right now. He didn’t think at all for the time being actually, as he too, was in deep slumber. His head pounded, but he wasn’t aware of that as he lay with his back against his closed bedroom door, the covers pulled up all the way to his ears. He was still in the clothes he had worn the day before: a plain white shirt and black, well-fitted trousers.
Narcissa and Lucius were travelling to the Malfoy vacation house in France. Draco supposed his mother would love if her darling son went with them, but Draco couldn't stand Lucius nowadays, so that was not an option. He remembered how he used to look up to Lucius so much, but not anymore. His father and their relationship belonged in the past, though Draco still had to play the part of the well-mannered, loving son whenever he visited them. He loved his mother, but she was still married to his father, so socialising with them was a challenge.
Draco shrugged. “I’m drunk. You’re drunk. It seems like an appropriate time to ask each other questions like this. But very well then. Do you have any idea why he won’t respond to my messages then?”
“Well…” Draco had no answer to that. He really didn’t, because he couldn’t understand how Weasley wasn’t pacing back and forth with him, just as worried.
“Wanted to surprise you,” Harry said, grinning at him, unable to mask the happiness Draco himself hid so well.
"Be away for a month, yeah. And I will be. I need to go back, so I can't stay. But they allowed me to spend Christmas with you at least." Harry's gaze was soft on Draco, and he reached out to brush his fringe away from his eye. "I had some extra leave they allowed me to take so I could be with you. Nobody likes or wants to be alone on Christmas, Draco. Nobody should
three types of different nasty hexes.
"So what on earth is going on?" He demanded when no one had said anything; clearly, neither Weasley nor Potter was going to willingly.
This wasn’t what Draco wanted to hear. He began feeling exasperated; Weasley was supposed to help and support him, not scold him! What on earth was so wrong with writing so much? Just because he’d written eighty-eight emails between last night and this morning, and three hundred the other day, didn’t mean that...Harry could have answered him
"Calm down?! How dare you, Weasley, he hasn't replied since… Since a few days! Something must have happened; he might be dead for Salazar's sake!" Draco threw up his hands in frustration.
Draco’s relationship with Harry didn’t improve the already strained relationship he had with his parents either. Although Lucius and Narcissa never said anything, Draco knew they didn’t exactly approve. They would never have grand-children, and the Malfoy bloodline would die with Draco.
his best friend; I thought
“We should email each other!” Harry said, with all the energy and excitement of a first-year on a sugar quill. He gestured eagerly to the brilliant Muggle device in front of them that had Draco frowning.
he wanted to say or perhaps not, that didn’t sound right.
He had talked about it while he made them dinner, but Draco had only listened with half an ear.

Ron and Harry exchanged a look, and it was that sort of look that told they shared something Draco wasn’t a part of. Weasley blushed, unable to stop it and Harry shifted weirdly under Draco’s scrutinising gaze.
He glanced at Draco next to him in the bed they were sat in, watched how Draco struggled to keep his eyes open. During their long talk, they had moved closer and closer to each other, and now Draco’s head was almost resting on Harry’s shoulder. It made him feel a little nervous; he could feel Draco’s warm breath, the warmth of his body overall. Harry swallowed, unsure of what to do. Unsure of what was expected of him.
Also, special thank you to the person in the Drarry: Fanfiction and fanart group on Facebook who came up with Draco's email address!
“No,” Harry said. “What are you going to do?”

“What the hell’s wrong with you?!” He asked, his whole body quivering as he struggled to breathe. “No, we have not,” he said, air quoting, “touched each other’s wands as you said, what the hell kind of question is that?!”
loudly, but failed. He heard Hermione call his name, horrified, but he could barely hear it. Several pairs of eyes turned their way, including Draco’s stormy grey, and Harry forced himself to look down. He was bleeding, and not so little, between his forefinger and thumb on his left hand. Lost in thought, he had cut himself, and badly too.
Seriously. Draco would
He had glanced at Harry, who had stirred some strange concoction on the stove without answering the question. Draco had left it hanging in the air, and now when they were together in bed, he still hadn't answered it.
Okay,
Draco shrugged, fighting the urge to glare. Weasley said something stupid to Harry—again, they talked over Draco’s head— and laughed.
“For Merlin’s sake! We need Hermione. There’s no other choice.”
It was better than talking. Talking meant dealing with things that hurt or were too much or fixing problems, and Draco didn't like that. He especially didn't like it when there wasn't any solution to the problem. He supposed he could check in with either Nott, Parkinson or Zabini and see what they were up to over the holidays.
Draco narrowed his eyes at that and threatened to put his fist up Harry's arse if he didn't shut up. Harry didn't want that, but he realised to get Draco to co-operate, he needed some sort of outside force.
