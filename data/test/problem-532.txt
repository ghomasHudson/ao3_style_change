"What should I do, if it never gets better? If I have to live with this pain for the rest of my life?" he asks quietly and Blaise decides there to do everything he can to let Potter see Draco. He burns Draco's face in his memory and vows to show Potter this if that twat ever messes up. Let that idiot die with guilt. But to do that, he has to bring them together. He owes Draco this.
The Ravenclaw pales and nods hurriedly. Draco can't help but smirk at that. Pince regards the other students with another chilly look, daring them to speak against her judgment. Out of fear for losing more points or out of respect Draco doesn't know, but nobody speaks to him again the entire week.
Severus dismissed him with a sympathetic expression, but Draco is stiff as he gets up and he thanks his godfather for the tea and leaves with a scowl.
"I don't think, it's the apology Potter craves, Headmistress," he opts instead and McGonagall lifts an eyebrow to tell him to continue.
But he didn't get very far.
The sex was more than just casual.
"He will, Harry," Ron claimed, "He loves you."
to feel comfortable around my best friends." The tears were running freely now. Ron looked a bit guilty, but Harry refused to feel bad for it. Ron hadn't been outright talking badly about Draco, but he would make suggestions about Draco's behavior that made Harry wonder and doubt. He should have talked to Draco instead of showing up drunk and dump that over Draco's head. And look where that got him!
They rarely talk. Potter informs him of changes in his schedule and Draco does the same. They don't greet each other and they don't talk about Quidditch. McGonagall reminds him to play nice, but he protests- he doesn't antagonize Potter, he just keeps for himself. Draco can't see the problem in that.
You almost stumble over your own shoes. "Harry?"
Draco was listening with barely concealed wonder. He still didn't believe Harry just yet, the hurt was too deep for that. But Harry was determined to put a smile on that face again, whatever the cost.
"We have a faculty meeting later today. I would ask you to join, but I'm sure, you need to unpack."
"Please. I have dignity and
"Maybe," she says, shrugging, "His name is on my list. But we can only know if we can find the Parselmouth."
In second year, Harry had surprised Hogwarts with his Parseltongue. Draco had been impressed. If that wasn't a sign for Harry to join Draco in Slytherin, then what else was? But Harry had been nervous about it and had never spoken to snakes in public again. Draco was disappointed. He found that ability quite cool. Maybe Harry needed someone to talk with? Snakes weren't a delightful company, after all, they would only know so much, but with Draco, Harry could converse. So Draco dedicated himself to learn the difficult language and after he found, that he was fluent enough, he sought out Harry again. But the latter fled every time Draco tried to speak with him. The Slytherin was distressed.
Malfoy came down a few times, always cleaning and feeding him. He expressed his concern that Potter would find out about it, that Potter would hurt Malfoy, but Malfoy only gave a thin-lipped smile in response.
"You'll never touch him again."
"If you ever hurt him.." Hermione threatened but Draco regards her with an almost bored expression.
"Just think about it: All those innocent students, looking up to you, just to learn, what a piece of shit you really are, Malfoy," you spat his name like a hex and you are louder than you wanted to be because Potter interrupts the Sorting and looks over his shoulder. You plaster on a sweet smile, but you can see the brittle grimace on Malfoy's face. Potter frowns at you.
"Then did you mean what you said about the second dance?" Draco asked, a little breathless. Everything was crashing into him, but somehow, the answer to that question mattered to him very much.
But he could try to get along. So he made an effort to get closer to Potter. He started greeting him in the mornings and felt quite smug when Potter tripped over his own legs in response. Weasley called him a ferret again and Draco let Granger hit Weasley for that.
"You have some serious groveling to do, Potter. You won't experience the next day should you do something like that ever again," Draco said eerily and pointed to the chair next to him, "Also, we will have a talk about all of our needs and boundaries in detail. If I like the result, then..."
Draco begged and pleaded in every way he knew to get Harry to let him down to their guest. Harry knew all of his tactics and the best reaction was an amused frown or a hard slap on his butt.
"Pansy," Harry began and slammed his foot in the door to stop Pansy from closing it. She glared at him with intense contempt and Harry feared for his life a bit.
"Good evening, Granger," he said nonetheless. He didn't have to like her to be polite and Harry would appreciate his effort.
"Draco, where is the hairpin that Uncle gifted me on Yule?" Lyra yelled through the Manor, disregarding all the manners and properness Mother had drilled into her since infantry, like the rebellious brat she is.
Draco willed his tension down, muted all thoughts screaming that this was a bad idea and bravely looked into Princr Harold's eyes just to promptly regretted it. They were such a vivid green, sparkly, just like the Queen's. He had the feeling, he knew them from somewhere, but he couldn't quite place it. They were so beautiful, that Draco almost missed his cue. Harold seemed amused by his antics.
So, Draco really has to call him Harry now.
"You fear, because of the past you share, he is not willing to be your friend?" she asks, to make sure. Draco wants to deny it. He doesn't want to be friends with Potter- he has no good reason too. After Hogwarts, they will likely never see each other again. Draco will be in the swamp of the Ministry doing... something...and Potter... well, he doesn't know what Potter will do, but he suspects he will join the Aurors and be on top of everything like he always was. Surely the Head Auror already offered him a position. Lost in thought, Draco doesn't feel the glance of McGonagall.
"Ah, yes," the redhead sitting there said, with a slight smirk, "the Malfoys."
"We weren't really fair to you too." Draco looks ready to object because Potter grabs his arm to keep his attention, "But we can move past that, can't we?" He almost looks hopeful and Draco asks himself if he can allow himself to support this hope. And he finds that he wants that. Move past that is. Maybe McGonagall was right. Maybe he and Potter really could be friends. So he looks Potter in the eyes and takes his hands as he says:
After everything was fixed on Lyra's hair and her dress was fitted snugly around her waist, he escorted the lady and miss of his house to their carriage. On the ride he passed the time with reading. Mother clicked her tongue at him and demanded that he should fix his posture, but Draco didn't care enough to follow her orders. Nobody was there to see and he knew how to behave in society, so her nagging now was useless. She seemed to understand that too, because she dropped it and left him to his reading.
You shake your head. "I've been several years behind Potter and never had the pleasure." Not that you wouldn't have liked that. Potter had been a celebrity since he was born and you would have liked to be his friend, but the age difference had been challenging and Potter was always so
Draco watched with anticipation, how Harry would react to his letter. He put his heart in it, it's the most honest thing Draco had ever written and he ached for an answer. But his confidence crumbled, because after the letter finished his hissing, Harry just looked at it, without any sort of expression. The Weasel tried to grab it, but Granger was faster. She attempted to read it again, but Draco charmed it so that only Harry can read it. But the Gryffindor just shrugged and took it back from Granger to leave it in his pocket. Draco is crushed. He had hoped for any kind of acceptance or rejection, but Harry didn't react to it at all. Draco hid his face in his hands. This was embarrassing. Not to mention humiliating. He hadn't felt this sad and dejected in a long time. Blaise eyed him and then stared at the Gryffindor table.
"Come on, hurry, we don't have time!" Malfoy ushered, grabbing him by the arm. He hissed at the pain, but bore with it, limping with Malfoy to the door. The stairs were the hardest part, but they managed.
"He needs something to ease his mind. He doesn't sleep that well," he admits and she looks surprised. She always thought, Harry was hiding something from her.
"Pansy!" Harry begged, "I just want to apologize. I know, I hurt him. I could slap myself for doing that."
"Well, then let them have their freedom. They were very brave confessing like that. You shouldn't just find them and dispose of their privacy just to reject them," she lectures and Harry can kinda see the point. Doesn't mean, it doesn't suck though.
The god of friendship sneers and the god of happiness wonders if that's a face, friendship should have. It doesn't look pretty. But the god of love doesn't look better. He glares at the other with an unknown, but possibly bad, intent and somehow the god of happiness finds himself even more uncomfortable.
"I shall share everything with you," Harry promised at their wedding and he had yet to disappoint.
to him!" Potter sighs and shoves a hand into his hair.
He fought in the war at Potter's side. He never knew him personally, but he was proud to call him a comrade. They even shook hands occasionally on different events, but now he regretted even looking at the man.
He woke up in the same room, but all of Potter's tools were away and a single device stood there. He knew what it was.
"And your mother?" Draco asked weakly, stripped off all his defenses. But Harry always had that effect on him.
Harry recoiled and the shock on his face satisfied Draco greatly.
Draco didn't leave his bed that day. He watched the side of Harry, willing it to become warm again. But it laid empty and unresponsive.
Draco. His lovely, unbelievingly gorgeous, and amazing boyfriend, well ex-boyfriend for now, was sitting on the bench under the windows nursing a whiskey glass, that was a bit too full to be healthy. He was staring outside, lost in his thoughts. But they weren't good ones, judging by the way his grip tightened around the glass. Harry just wanted to stand still and stare at him for a bit. He had just seen him yesterday, but Merlin, did he miss him. Draco's laughter and his little smirks and even his critics of Harry's food. Everything was better than the silence right now. But Harry couldn't just stare at him forever, he had a mission and he didn't know when Pansy would be coming back.
"I know all about nature," he says and Firenze frowns.
"-and that finishes my report. Does anyone else have anything to add?" A chorus of "no"'s comes back and McGonagall nods satisfied. "Then we see each other at supper. Please be present for the sorting tomorrow, heads of houses and you of course," she says, and her gaze runs over Malfoy, Sprout, Flitwick, Potter, and you. You fight your blush at being included in a group with Potter, but then they are all leaving and you hurry to catch up with Potter, who is of course at Malfoy's side.
"What? You have no date either? Go with me!" Pansy says and Draco sighs into his hands. This was what he was trying to avoid. Heterosexuality was so exhausting.
"I will come for you," he said and Malfoy managed a shaky smile. He took his hand back and ushered him with a vague wave.
"Potter has to watch him wherever he goes and I cannot see Potter anywhere," he says, sure of himself. Draco wants to chuckle, but he keeps quiet because Madam Pince
"Are you alright?" he asked, because of course Draco had to be sick if he was polite.
"What's his problem?" Harry asks, with a full mouth, and Hermione clicks her tongue and admonishes him to
Professor," you emphasize on the Studies, and glare at the blond guy, who just looks up and down once without changing his expression. You breathe deeply to will down any annoyance. "But you can call me Alex. I was in Hogwarts for two years before the war and finished school in the States." Potter's face was clouded at you mentioning the war. He doesn't quite grit his teeth, but the motion is there.
"I'm feeling great," he answered truthfully and Harry made a satisfied noise. He listened to his own heartbeat for a while until Harry spoke up again.
He says and the god of happiness kisses him on his cheek.
"You will have problems with me, Headmistress," Draco promises but he wants to sneer. McGonagall sighs. She anticipated this.
"What did I miss?" Harry asked and nudged Draco with his hip to make room for himself. Draco looked expectantly at Hermione, but she couldn't hold his gaze.
"Yes?"
"You are many things, Mr. Malfoy, but a traumatizer you are not. You were a little boy, walking down a path without someone showing you alternatives. You didn't start the war, you weren't the cause of it and you didn't kill anyone. Stop blaming yourself for things you had no control over." McGonagall says softly, but sternly, leaving no room for objection. And even if he could, he wouldn't. Instead, he was crying weakly and couldn't bring himself to stop. McGonagall holds his hands through it, caressing it with her own.
Hermione puts her book down, something about Divination, and shots him one look and Harry caved.
"Yes, I did," Harry agreed, "But I lost something more important than that."
"Definitely."
Potter hadn't come down in days. He was sure, that a lot of time had passed already, because he found out, that the drumming sound was in fact a coffee machine. Potter insisted on doing everything like muggles, so it made sense, that he would have such a device. The machine drummed twice a day. Once in the morning and once in the afternoon. He counted the hours between and it fitted.
"Can I also try?" Draco asked then and Harry looked at him with adoration shining his eyes.
that day for the first time," he says and swallows. Harry moves to his side, eying Draco's hands. They were the most open thing about Draco, Harry observed. They would tell the truth no matter what. And now his hands were shaking.
"Yes," Harry nodded, "I won't have him disrespect you again if I can help it."
"And I've said so many hurtful things to you, I don't even know how to apologize enough. Please believe me when I say, that I absolutely do love you and that I appreciate everything you do for me. And I know, you can't trust me, not after all I've said," Harry smiled ruefully, "But I want to work to earn that trust again. And I promised you to never listen to anyone regarding our relationship ever again. I've learned my lesson."
"Harry! That's great! That means, they know you're looking for them now!" she congratulates him and really, he doesn't deserve that praise. He really has to depend on Zabini's goodwill for now and hope, that the message got through.
"But you know someone, who does," Harry says like it's a fact and he's sure to see a flicker of acceptance in Zabini's eyes, but then the Slytherin sneers.
Potter was an excellent flyer, Draco had to give him that. He had been flying against Potter for years now and he wasn't too shy to acknowledge the obvious talent. Must be in his blood, Draco mused. Potter's father also had been a legendary seeker, the Daily Prophet wrote about him a couple of years ago. Draco knew better than to trust anything that the newspaper published, although James Potter had his own shrine in Hogwarts, so that must have been true. But even if Potter was an excellent seeker, he still was mostly a reckless idiot. One time he dived right into the tribune Draco had been sitting on and only because he reacted fast enough Potter avoided a week in the hospital wing. Weasly tried to give him the fault, but Potter just glared at him and Granger lectured him and Potter about safe flying. Their faces were Draco's only source of amusement.
"Were you ever in love, Severus?" Draco asks back and the potion master looks stunned. He clears his throat and takes a tentative sip.
"Even better than before."
"Well," Draco said, "Ronald Weasley is a pleasant man." Just to annoy Mother a bit. And judging from the frown on her face, it was working.
"I only want to talk to Potter, Malfoy. You can go," you snarl, and Malfoy frowns, not very happy for being dismissed.
but civility from me," he stressed the word nothing and seemed to get his point across. Harry took his hand back like he was burned.
"Hello, Draco," he said at least and Draco couldn't help but lift an eyebrow in silent wonder.
He knew something Potter didn't and it made him giddy with twisted pleasure.
The god of happiness agrees.
"Grow up, Granger," he drawled, "It's unavoidable, that I'll hurt him. Just as he'll hurt me. Because we're Potter and Malfoy and we're human. You can't possibly expect, that I will shy away from confrontation just so that I won't hurt his feelings," he sneered and took satisfaction in the way Granger's head seemed to redden just like her husband's.
"Why aren't you?" Harry asked and it's the first time Draco lets his face morph into something hostile.
Draco was still watching, clearly working through his words.
"And?"
Draco looked up and stared at him resolutely. "We are done, Harry," he said and closed the door in Harry's face.
King James seemingly believed in bonding for love and not for power or political gains and therefore never promised his son to anyone.
"Me too," he says then, holding their hands close. He slowly brings then closer to his face and Draco wants to ask what's wrong, but then Harry presses a soft kiss on his hand, and Draco gasps. But he refuses to let his hopes up just yet. But he scoots closer to Harry, who's still looking at their hands.
McGonagall smiles amused. "Why, yes, our Defense Professor, Harry Potter. You must have met."
"So, it's Malfoy," Ron says, muffled with food and Harry spits his orange juice on the table. "Eww, Harry," Hermione says disgusted and wipes it clean with her napkin. She seems unfazed by Ron's comment though. Harry chokes and coughs, hoping not to die. Hermione silently passes him another napkin.
"Do you think, our guest will like it?" A wicked grin found its way on Draco's face.
He was proud of his way with words, but everything he brought on paper was unsatisfactory and didn't convey, what Draco tried to say. He wanted to flatter Harry a little bit, stroking his ego, but also remind him, that he saw him as human, as Harry. Frustrated, he set the quill down and closed his eyes. This wasn't going to work. Harry was receiving fan mail every day and from the looks of it, he was quite tired of it. Draco's letter had to be special, had to stand out. He grits his teeth. This was harder than he thought.
Those meetings have been dates.
it seemed to say and Draco shudders, as a new wave of regret falls over him. He leans against the fall, touching it again.
"I'm aware," Harold replied "you already explained that to me once."
"Hey," he begins, and Draco watches him silently, telling him to go on, "I've met Potter today." And Draco goes stiff, but he's still listening, so Blaise hurries to explain.
"He'll notice, if I give you more, sorry," Malfoy whispered and he followed the line of his wand. His hand was shaking. Then there was a muffled sound from above and Malfoy stiffed.
"I enjoyed it. He looked so scared when I woke him, but then he looked at me like I was his only hope when I left the room," he recounted and Harry nodded, agreeing.
"You better," she growled and stepped aside to let him in. "I'll take Blaise or he will really cut your dick off."
And this time, there was no hesitation.
He says and that calms them down. The conflict is not solved, but for now, they could coexist. He takes them both by the hand and leads them to the edge of the tower and sits down with both of them. The god of love looks still pretty angry, but he's willing to put it aside. The god of happiness is proud and looks expectantly at the god of friendship. He just looks at their intervened hands and beams.
She hoped, she never had to let him go. Even if she had to deal with Malfoy.
"Look, but you can speak it, right?" Harry snaps and Zabini's eyelid twitches in irritation.
"Shit, I have to go talk to Draco right now;" Harry said and jumped up.
"So you don't know, that Draco's been a Death Eater?"
"But if he is willing to look beyond that and greet me and be nice and..."
"No, no, not as much. I'll be there," you promise and she seems pleased. While you were talking, the castle came to view. It had been restored after the war, but you hadn't been allowed to help. Granted, you were a second year, and the trauma still fresh, but your
in his hands, bringing it to his mouth.
"No wonder with his charming personality," Blaise snarks and Draco snickers, for the appearance.
"It was Parseltongue. I really had to pay attention to it, I haven't spoken or heard it in so long. But there's an English version. He must have spelled it, so only I can read it," Harry theorized and Hermione nods, agreeing. Ron looks thoughtful for a moment.
"Of course, thank you for your time," Draco said, bowed one last time while Lyra courtsied again and then lead her back to Mother, who was smothering Lyra with anxious attention.
"Draco! Lyra will not marry some common gentlemen! A lady of her status should at least marry a marquis! Or better even, a duke! And," she calmed enough to give Lyra a meaningful look, "if she does her job perfectly, even the Prince would not be out of question."
There he stood, wiping his sweaty hands on his trousers awkwardly, a habit he had when he was nervous. Draco simply watched him, not gracing him with any kind of acknowledgment and Harry hunched his shoulders, clearly uncomfortable.
"We met...
"We only have two minutes until the wards will tell him, that I broke in," Malfoy rambled, cutting through the
So when his husband asked, if he could invite a guest for an infinite stay, he agreed instantly without a second thought. Harry smiled down at him that evening, called him a
"I will keep an eye on him," he promises and the minister regards him with an odd look. "I think, I can handle him." He watches Draco for a moment. "And I doubt, that he will try anything funny."
In his pathetic attempts to feel closer to Harry, he started talking to him on a whim. That obviously didn't go well. Harry felt insulted every time Draco tried to be nice. If he would greet Harry with a "Morning, Potter! Where did you leave your comb?" to appear friendly, Harry would just scowl and snap at him to leave him alone. Draco was stunned to get such a reaction just from a greeting and when he turned to Blaise with a questioning glance, his friend would shrug and just say "That's Potter for you". Draco didn't know, what to make of that. Harry was surely capable of being nice since he had a ton of friends to prove he was likable enough. Why was he so weird to Draco? The Slytherin was not sure.
He looks at his list, expecting the human's name to disappear, but he's astonished as Draco Malfoy still stands on top of it. How is that possible? He watches as the subject jokes around with his new friend. He's definitely laughing and the god checks his list again. But Draco Malfoy is still there. The god groans. Why was this human so hard to please? He had been accepted by one of the most powerful witches in England and he had found a friend! What more would the subject need to be happy?
Meanwhile, Draco is thinking about telling Harry, how he felt. Of course not face to face, Draco was way too shy for that, but a letter might do the trick. He was sitting at his desk for the last hour, writing and erasing paragraphs of poetry, because Draco was not a
"Quite fine, thank you for asking. You are well, I hope?" he responded, and Harry's frown went deeper.
The young man still refused to let any positive emotion near himself and it was getting tiring. For a moment the god hoped for the subject to rekindle his very rocky relationship with Harry Potter, as the god had learned, but Draco crushed that hope with the very first conversation the two men had. Why did this human insist on making this more difficult?
"May his Highness Prince Harold find a partner for the dance," a page said and Draco glanced up, observing Harold standing up swiftly, walking through the masses, which parted as if he was Moses and couldn't quite stop gaping as the Prince came to stand before him.
And that made Harry's absence even worse.
"Who wants to know that?" Harry asked and cringed. He felt like a bad actor in one of those horrible thrillers Luna forced him to watch. Gorgeous man's lips curled into a nasty smile.
"Face it, Harry, you're bloody whipped," Ron slurred with his forefinger right in Harry's face. "And it's getting annoying."
"-and I think, that would be a great idea. What do you think, Professor?" Now they are both looking at you, McGonagall more exasperated and Potter amused. You make an effort to close your mouth and swallow. Damn him and his sexiness.
"You don't love me, Draco. You keep me here for something, but not for love," Harry stated and when Draco doesn't react, he added, "What do I even keep you for?"
The god of friendship coos, as he sits down next to the god of happiness.
"I'm happy to be here too," you say, and hope that your voice doesn't crack. You are more confident elsewhere, but the former Professor had always this effect on people. You suspect it is because she has seen you at the most humiliating time of your life. Teenagers are never easy, but you could have been a little bit more difficult than most. The knowing glint in her eyes seems to say, that she also remembers, and really, this isn't how you imagined it at all.
Their guest came in two weeks later. Harry had taken care of the room the guest would stay in, in the basement. Draco hadn't been allowed to help.
"Everything alright, 'Mione? Was he a prat?" Harry asked worriedly and Draco smacked his arm.
"Was there something you wanted?" Potter and Malfoy say at the same time and you are flabbergastered at Malfoy's nerve.
"You would never treat me like that again, would you Harry?"
"No," the redhead grinned, "not at all."
"No, I remember clearly saying yesterday, that I have plans for breakfast and coffee this morning with
"I expected you to yell at me," he uttered and Draco allowed himself to briefly laugh.
Harry bowed, like it was customary and offered his hand again. A collective gasp went through the hall and Draco couldn't even imagine the gossip that would entertain the city the next week.
"I have a crush," he admits then and Draco feels sick like he had been punched in the stomach. But Harry doesn't notice and stares farther into the flames as if he expects a face to come out and talk to him. Harry looks quite sad, Draco notices. He wiggles his way over, where Harry sits and his friend stiffs at the closeness. But Draco just takes his hand and looks at the fire. And after some time, Harry relaxes and closes his hand around Draco's. They're silent for a while.
"I could kiss you now, you know?" Draco deadpans and Blaise laughs like the free spirit he is. "Please don't."
She asks and the god of happiness looks down at them.
"Maybe you can tell my parents?" Malfoy asked quietly as if it was too much to ask. It probably was, but he found himself agreeing anyway.
"Obviously you and your friends already judged me, didn't you? Weasley surely wasn't speaking fondly for my person, did he? And you believed him, you believed what he told you and you will continue to do so," Draco said and he looked like he realized something, "Because you never did trust me, right? There was always a little bit of doubt in your heart and your friends and family only helped fuel it." He laid his head into his hands. "I should have known."
They were really perfect for each other.
"I wanted to see whether he had changed and if he was a good match for you," she answered honestly and Harry nodded, never leaving her eyes out of his focus.
Fuck.
It took the whole night but after more attempts than he could count, he was satisfied. Theo and Blaise had eyed his closed curtains with suspicion, but Draco flipped them off.
"Ah, yes, I forgot. The age, you see," McGonagall muses and you hurry to assure her of her youth. She smiles like she finds you charming and you consider your job done.
He wouldn't allow himself to cry. It was obviously his fault to feel so attached to someone, who treated him like a mere passing fling. He must have interpreted the signs wrong. The long talks after they fucked must have been courtesy and the invitations every Saturday must have been Harry's manners. Maybe he did that with all his casual fuck partners, not only with Draco. Maybe he treated them all like they deserved the world and dropped them like a hot potato. It was entirely possible that Harry Potter was this kind of casual lover.
"We'll try again later," Malfoy promised, and he found himself wondering when that later would be.
"How is it possible, that he has no date?" he asks no one in particular, but Theo turns from his conversation with Milicent and an annoying grin stretches his face.
"Is this good timing? Maybe give him some time to cool off?" Ron asked hesitantly.
He turns to the edge of the tower.
"Good luck, mate," Ron said and Harry apparated.
Draco was raised to be a Lord and to act and think as such, to feel superior and sneer while driving by, but all he felt was pity. Pity for that common folk, blind to all the possibilities and knowledge the world had to offer. Content like a dog with the owner feeding them scrabes, never intending to take the bird for themselves.
"I have to go back," he said, stood, but waited for a moment, looking down at him.
To find a bride for the Prince.
"What? Why?"
But now he couldn't care less.
"What about you?" he asked finally and Malfoy gave a tired shrug.
"No, they wouldn't," Harry said and swept a little bit of blood off his face. Damn Pansy and her fingernails. "Not when I say, it was my fault."
"Of course, love," Draco said softly and the squeeze on his throat was the promise of his reward in the evening.
house by the other houses and they made no attempt to become friends. He refused to let himself become the guilty one for everything his housemates had to endure.
But this human looked like a challenge. He went through a war- together with other young humans against someone, who might as well be dead. Cold eyes, conveying madness, and hate. The god shuddered. He felt uncomfortable, bringing this madman happiness. But it was his job and for a while, it worked. The madman believed the lie and was happy with that outcome. But he forgot that happiness doesn't last. He was defeated and cursed everyone in his last breath.
"Absolutely, yes."
"What now," he asks again and Harry scratches his neck, "I guess, both?"
But King James seemed adamant to remember him.
"In my office," she barks and all you can do is follow.
The god of happiness asked his colleague and receives an affirming hum.
"Yes, Headmistress," he says through gritted teeth, trying to be calm. She sighs again. She questions sometimes if this young man was worth the trouble. As a Professor of many years, she encountered more than a hundred problem students, but she managed to deal with them. Harry Potter was such a student. Well, he was somehow special and it was clear, that Draco still detested all divine authority for that. It will not be easy to direct this young man.
The god of happiness worries his lip between his teeth. He expected it to be bad, but this was worse than he thought.
"Sounds kinda shitty," Harry mumbled into his bottle.
"Remember your promise, Potter. You know, what a promise means to us," he says and Harry can only nod. Zabini smirks and takes his wand down, only to take it up again, when he feels a presence behind him.
"He's away on business," Malfoy explained. Ah, that's why he was so calm.
"Well, you can't do that if you're in love with a boy, can you?" Severus says and Draco sneers. He wanted to be stubborn, tell him to "Watch him do it", but he knew, that Severus was right. His parents would pressure him to settle down after school and he was expected to start in the Ministry as Malfoy Sr. did. That didn't mean, that he wanted to.
"It's fine," he croaked and Malfoy attempted a weak smile, that died the instant the dull sound came again from above.
After his colleague leaves, the god resumes his task. This one human denied himself happiness, after the chaos he saw. The god was right. Death doesn't trouble him- he will never understand the sadness it brings. But he knows, that time will make it pass. Time makes it bearable, but one has to embrace it. This young human was avoiding everything. The god huffs. Leave it to complicated humans to make his job more difficult. He jumps from his tower and makes his way down to earth. He has to visit this subject, find the stain, that troubles his heart and find something to make him happy. Or someone, he mused and watched the humans life.
You can't help but feel disappointed again. You don't really listen to Hagrid and Sinistra's introduction and watch Potter interacting with Malfoy instead. They seem very close, at least good friends and they have no qualms to touch each other in front of other people. You never try to analyze others, when you can help it, but Potter is the exception. You're interested in him and his surroundings and you want to impress him, if possible, but he won't even look at you! His attention is on Malfoy and Malfoy only and ugly jealousy runs through your veins. You take deep breaths and promise to yourself to catch him after the meeting.
"Why?"
!" Zabini barks and attempts to shove Harry out of the way, but Harry just catches his wrist and pulls him closer.
"Why would that be inappropriate?" Harold calmly asked. Draco looked at him incrudlously.
"Morning, mate," Ron greeted him joyously, "Spoke to him last night, didn't ya? Had a fight?"
"I can't! He has a spell on me, he will know where to we leave, it's too dangerous!" Malfoy explained frantically and his stomach was filled with dread.
"No," he whispers.
"You sure, mate? From my perspective, he still treated you like shit," Ron said.
The god of love squinted his eyes and sighs.
"I'm sure," he repeats, but his voice cracks. Tears spill and he rubs his hands over his face wishing his tears away, but he can't stop. He shudders and his broomstick shakes with him. Draco watches and carefully steadies his and Harry's broom with both of his hands. Harry taught him that a few days ago. He had been so proud and promised Draco to take him flying. Draco hadn't believed him then. But Harry came into their room today and took him out.
"A pleasure to meet you all. I am the new Muggle
"Muggles love these kinds of tattoos. Rather ironic, isn't it?" you press on and he stiffens ever so slightly. But it's the reaction you've been looking for.
"Draco. First and foremost: thank you. I appreciate your apology and you're right. Even if it doesn't help, it's still a comfort. To me at least," he smiles encouragingly, "and I want to say sorry too. I saw you suffer and I still had to follow you into that bathroom and I still had to
"Don't call me that!" Draco interrupted him furiously, "You lost that privilege last night!"
"Maybe you could ease his mind?" she asks and this time Draco laughs, but it's filled with bitterness.
And Draco moved his hand to cradle his husband's head, matching his grin.
He just shook his head.
"I love music," Potter commented and he realized that he just played in his hands. So he stopped resisting altogether.
"I'll remember your name, Ronald Weasley," Draco said, accompanied with a sharp smile full of teeth, "Have a good night."
"State your name, please," Draco asked, while ushering Mother and Lyra closer to the door.
He mocks her and she rewards him with a flick on his head. They are quiet again.
"Still not used to being called Professor," you hope to explain your nervousness and she kindly lets it go.
"But. We aren't the only ones, who lost. Right?" he asked, this time sharply. Hermione nodded numbly, not trusting her voice.
, but Draco refuses to let go.
"What do you think, darling?" Harry murmured, nuzzling his temple.
"Why, Harry," Draco smirks, "I'd thought, you'd never ask."
"Thank you, sir," Weasley said, looking bewildered and confused. He might have expected to be scolded or slapped for his impudence, but Draco wasn't that shallow. Oh, Father would have slapped him, no doubt, but Draco didn't want to make more enemies than he could keep his eyes on. Who knows, what connections this redhead could have? He might be acquainted with the chef of staff or a general or another high ranking individual in the castle. Most noblemen underestimated the power commoners had. Oh, they couldn't do much outwards, but they could talk. And gossip might ruin a family quicker than a sword.
He punished himself for his weakness. A simple breakup brought him to the edge of madness? Him? Draco Malfoy?
"He doesn't have to be. I wasn't really nice to him for the last seven years," he admits and Potter looks at him in wonder. It's a nice look on him, Draco finds.
Potter came back with Malfoy in a row, head down, shaking like a leaf. Potter smothered down his hair and Malfoy flinched at the contact.
"Maybe."
silence in the library. The more the student talks the deeper Pince frowns.
"What did you do?" Malfoy whispered, furiously as if he already knew.
don't.
"Po..." he began, but his throat constricted.
more, but I was so scared. I was so so scared of...
"He even had the guts to kiss you. I have to make sure, that his ride will make up for that," Potter said maliciously and Malfoy's eyes glinted with delight.
"If you two are quite finished," she says mildly, and the blond guy sents her a charming smile.
The Headmistress doesn't say as much, but she is clip and efficient with you, not warm and friendly as before. She shows you your quarters and classrooms and gives you a map with all of the main locations, namely the Great Hall, her office, and the rooms of the other Professors.
The god of death says, after a long pause. Then he turns to the other and whispers then,
She explains and the god of happiness listens.
"How have you been, Granger?" his next question was and sipped on his pint.
"Have you apologized, Mr. Malfoy?" she asks then carefully as if she tries not to offend him. Draco avoids her gaze, tense in his shoulders. He is ashamed enough for what he did. He doesn't need Potter to make fun of him too.
Ron snorted. "You look at him like he hung the moon, mate. And he always just glares and sneers and runs his ugly mug about how lucky you are to have him.
"Who are you talking to?" Potter asks with suspicion, but Draco just keeps walking.
Harry made sure their guest was comfortable downstairs, while Draco prepared dinner. Taking care of visitors always took a toll on Harry and he wanted to make sure, his husband was as relaxed as possible. He tasted the soup, before adding salt, as Harry pressed himself to his backside.
The god of friendship splutters at that.
And Harry Potter was the definition of unreachable for Draco Malfoy.
Granger across the table grabbed her glass a little bit to tightly and didn't relax even as Harry dropped a kiss on her head.
"Of course, Harry. I'll support you. I will," she promised and a glance at Draco told her, that he had planned this. There was smug satisfaction but also honest contentment. Maybe he had changed. For a bit.
"It's not your business, what my intentions are with Potter. But if you must know, I immensely enjoy his company and I would be sad to see him go," he answered her question, but she didn't seem satisfied.
"I'm happy to hear that, Mr. Malfoy. But I will remind you: I agreed with the minister only because of your talent and because I believe, that you will cause no harm. I will not hesitate to take my agreement back if I hear, that you disregarded the rules! Are we clear on that?" she says and this time Draco sneers. It's not like he has a choice, right? The Ministry had very plain expressed, that these regulations were not debatable. He'll make a mistake? That's it.
She says and looks rather proud. The god of happiness laughs then.
"No dark magic. It's not a howler either. I guess, someone just forgot to write their name on the back," she says, shrugs and presumes her breakfast. Harry glances at the letter, decides "fuck it" and opened it with his knife. He is surprised to hear hissing.
admit, that their relationship was in fact not a relationship.
"Harry," he says again, "ask me," he demands and something in Harry's eyes flicker. He looks hopeful again, as hopeful one the day he asked Draco to leave everything behind. Harry takes a deep breath to find his Gryffindor courage. When he opens his eyes, he looks determined.
"Did you find him yet?" Ron asks between bites and Harry sees, that Hermione only waited for one of them to crack so she didn't have to ask herself.
After a week of exchanging pleasantries, Granger proceeded to talk to him about Potions homework and Draco found, that she was a nice study companion. She was quiet and let him do his own thing, but she also asked questions here and then and it amused Draco to no end when she canceled on Weasley to study with him.
The god of love says and shoves the other god from the tower. The god of friendship yelps and sits down at the other side with the god of happiness between them, who looks very uncomfortable.
Harry shook his head vigorously, "No, not in my lifetime."
"There he is. Wasn't it nice of him to greet me when I came back? I was almost moved to tears," Potter said, continuing to stroke Malfoy's head. Said man didn't move, clutching his sweater in his hands.
"Jesus, calm down, it's not even that late," Harry slurred and pushed himself into a sitting position.
By the time the subject turns eleven, his life gets more interesting. He is going to a school for education the god guessed and the human strides with his father to buy things he needs. The god will never understand the human's love for material things and why some clothes are more worth than others. The god has no use for possessions, but he knows, that humans, in particular, find happiness in them, so he doesn't complain.
"Seriously Potter, how can anyone be late with magic," he asked rhetorically and Harry's eyes were blinking with amusement.
"Gotta say, mate, you notice him more and more every year," he claims and Harry turns his head in wonder.
His brother follows his finger and watches Draco Malfoy bicker with Harry Potter, who gets the bigger bed.
"Fine," Harry decided, "I will."
he wanted to scream.
Harry was determined to find his secret admirer before the Yule Ball in two weeks. He wanted the writer to give a chance. Maybe, if they understood each other and had a good time, he would ask him to the Yule Ball. But for that to happen, he had to find a Parselmouth. The easiest way, Harry guessed, was to walk up to them, say something in Parseltongue, and wait how they would react. People, who didn't know Parseltongue mostly felt insulted, if someone was hissing at them, but, and this was only a guess on Harry's part, the secret admirer should recognize the pattern of the hissing and he should react to that. Merlin, Harry hoped, that this would work.
Everything Draco wasn't.
The god laid his head in his hands. Disappointment was beyond him and his emotions were limited, but fatigue? That was something he could feel.
to be happy. The god thought that the subject might be pleased with the outcome of his trial. After all, he was allowed to continue his studies and he could see his mother whenever he desired. The god was sure, that any other person would be content with that, but not Draco Malfoy.
But he knew better.
Harry sighed and lay his head into his hands. Draco petted his back a little and then sat back, leaving him to deal with her.
"Important details, Harry," Pansy huffed and put her hands on her hips. She reminded him a lot of Hermione at that moment and he had to snort. Pansy would not appreciate that comparison. Hermione didn't approve of Harry's lifestyle and every person he choose to live it out with, so she didn't like Pansy on principle. And Pansy didn't like to be generalized and returned the sentiment.
There wasn't even a choice to be made.
"You are right, it should not be. But people have expectations for you. Your parents want you to marry a pureblood witch to produce an heir, do they not?" Draco scrunches his nose and nods. His father had implied, that Draco should start looking for a witch he liked. He had forgotten because it wasn't a direct order, but it could easily become one. His father was indecisive like that.
"I don't think he was."
The god of happiness is incredibly pleased. The subject was on the right path toward happiness. He couldn't believe his luck!
"Maybe for the next. I want to break them this time. Would you help with that?" Draco nodded enthusiastically.
a Death Eater. Has been acquitted of all crimes. But he's done his redemption, you know? He will tell you about it if you ask," he says and then he frowns at you displeased and angry. You're not quite sure, what you've done to earn that.
"Have you enjoyed being our guest?" Malfoy asked, bending down to his eye level. He could only look at him, feeling betrayed.
This was the mystery person Potter was talking about? Then he was truly fucked.
"He speaks Parseltongue and he learned it for me. He says I looked sad when I found out in second-year and that he wanted to talk to me," he adds, and Hermione coos.
Harry's eyes looked hopeful. "Then?"
Broked and left behind.
Draco can't find himself to be happy about anything, the Wizengamot decided that day.
Another gasp. Someone fainted.
"Your highness, that would be inappropriate," he said and stared over Harold's shoulder, looking in dozens faces distored with envy.
"I might be able to get you out of here," Malfoy said one day and he whipped his head so fast, he felt dizzy.
Draco wouldn't, no
"Draco," he whispered, "My love."
Draco gasped, "What the fuck are you talking about?"
"Draco."
"I'll go with you if nobody else wants to go with me. I haven't asked yet-" he begins and cuts himself off, as he realizes his mistake. Blaise perks up, clearly interested.
If Draco had to describe his relationship with Potter, he would say: "We tolerate each other."
A snarky voice behind them said and the god of love appeared. The god of friendship groans.
"Of course, love, whatever you want."
Yes, Harry Potter would do nicely. He was the tool the god would use to make his subject as happy as possible.
"Details," he yawned and ducked when a towel flew his way. Pansy had good aim, Harry had to admit. He liked a girl, that could fight. Or a boy, he wasn't picky like that.
"Harry," he murmurs gently and tries to move his away, but Harry has an iron grip on his hand and stares at them.
After his death, the god was busy. Many humans on earth demanded happiness after being denied for so long. The god hurried to fulfill his tasks. Little moments of happiness the humans shared with each other, as they rebuild their home and mourned their lost ones.
"So, you mean, it could be Malfoy?!" Ron exclaims and half of the Gryffindor table turns to them. Hermione shooshes him and Harry kicks him in the shin, for good measure.
He had to swollow a sob. Because he knew it would happen. He knew, he would leave eventually, find a new flame to watch, a new person to fuck. Draco doesn't feel like he's been anything but a person Harry met out of convenience, someone he used to feel better about himself. He feels dirty, uncomfortable with his own skin.
"If this is the kingdoms future generation, then we're sailing to good times, indeed," was all he said, before leaving Draco, who stood there gaping like a fish. His companions had praised his genius, but it had been an accident, really. He hadn't planned on gaining the King's attention, nor was planning to do so now.
"You're right mate," Ron said and took another sip, "normally I would support the shit out of you, but the fact that it's
Maybe it was because of the incident in first-year? Draco had been admittingly a tad rude, but to see the famous Harry Potter together with
"I will try my very best," he says, careful to hold his voice calm and neutral. McGonagall looks at him once again, but decided then, that those warning would suffice.
He says and the god of love scowls.
The god of friendship concludes and the god of love screeches.
"We separated the Eighth year students from the rest and set up a dorm in the west wing. Merlin knows you deserve some privacy," she explains and gives him a list with his timetable, "But I think, this will be all. You may go now, Mr. Malfoy. I'll see you in class." Draco nods absently, grabs the paper and leaves the office.
He asks, letting his feet dangle. He looks up again. She looks sinister but he can't bring himself to really care.
He formed the following conversation in his head, pondered about his responses to her questions and decided to be confident tonight. There was nothing she could tell him, that he hadn't heard before and he felt settled in his relationship with Harry. Compared to Voldemort, this was nothing.
"He was searching for you. Hissing at Slytherins to see if someone would react. I-I'm sorry, I couldn't help it. After you showed me yesterday, I recognized it, and... he saw," Blaise adds and watches his friend uncurling himself. He takes a deep breath and continues.
was all he could think of, but he fought hard to maintain a friendly smile on his face.
"What's wrong with Draco?" Harry asked a bit stung. Ron and Hermione had been the first to speak to Harry again, after he kind of dropped the bomb at Arthur's birthday, that he was dating Draco. The reactions had been... loud, to say at least. George was still a bit awkward around him. But Ron had taken it in stride. Harry had been a bit worried about him since Ron knew Draco out of his siblings the best and he had been bullied and teased by Draco for years. But he had given Draco a real chance and after a pint or two, they managed to get on friendly terms. That Ron was complaining now made Harry angry.
"He's a grown man, Granger. He's neither your child nor your responsibility. Let him make his choices. Merlin knows, he deserves that," he said dryly and this time Granger flushed from embarrassment. She wanted to argue, Draco noted as she opened and closed her mouth, unable to speak up.
"And you know, that I love you too?"
"It is your fault," Pansy hissed, "And you will fucking pay for it in one way or the other. But you will never get the chance to hurt him again."
The god thought grimly and for a moment, the madman saw reason. But his life was too short to act on it.
"That doesn't excuse it. I threw a curse at you I didn't even knew the effect of! And I want to apologize for that. I had almost killed you right there, had Snape not..." Draco wants to comfort him but isn't quite sure how to. So he just smiles as assuring as he can.
But Harry has been different. He had this thing, this
"Soon, love. He's almost where we want him," Draco said, hugging Harry close. His husband didn't look quite as pleased as he normally would, as he stepped out of the basement and this time he went straight for Draco's embrace.
here and there, Draco's passion was a secret again. His friends might resent him for his drastic measures, but they forgot before they could talk to him about it. Severus Snape observed his godson's behavior with worry. Draco's grades were decent enough, the Slytherin made sure of that (his father would have his head if he didn't get an O in the "important" classes). But his general attitude seems to be different. He invites Draco for tea.
Draco apparated to the Leakey on a cold Friday evening. Granger had invited him and Harry for a little get-together, but Draco knew her better than that. This was the "meet the family of your boyfriend"-meeting and he already dreaded it. Harry assured him of her good intentions, but Draco wasn't a Slytherin for nothing. This could very well end very badly and he didn't want to be the cause of that.
"You could be great friends," she says one time when Draco stays in Hogwarts as Potter went to Hogsmeade. He had nothing to buy, so he asked to stay. Draco scowls at her.
"Certainly, Granger. Ask away," he said and leaned back in his seat. Hermione narrowed her eyes suspiciously.
This was getting out of hand.
Harry wouldn't appreciate flowers, nor chocolate. He ate treacle tart every day, if he could, so that fell out too. Every present Draco came up with he had to dismiss, because either Harry had no use for it, or he had the means to get it himself. Draco laid his head on the desk and watched the ink drying. Written words could be so misleading...
"You wanna talk about it?" he asks hesitantly and Draco shakes his head. "Fuck no."
He enjoys Pansy's company well enough, but he couldn't imagine holding her hand, or... or...
"I'm afraid, I can't follow," Draco said frowning.
The god of sadness asks, and his brother sighs.
"The meeting is in two hours, should you be ready to make it. The faculty room is there," she says, shows you on the map, and then bids her goodbye. You mark the location because your memory is not as good as you'd like, and then begin to unpack your stuff. It's not much, just your personal belongings, a few Muggle items you plan to introduce to the students, and your study material. Everything else is still in your London flat. You were unsure, whether to move to Hogwarts entirely or to keep your flat, but your friends solved that problem very quickly.
"I don't spend time with people like you," he spits out, and you rise affronted. "People like me? What about people like him?" you say and point at Malfoy accusingly and Potter slaps your hand away. You cradle it close, clearly stung.
At the beginning of the term, she wasn't quite sure if Draco would hold on. She warned him enough, that was clear because there was no incident in which Draco offended or hurt someone. He still had no friends, but she counted that as a win. She didn't expect him to behave, but he had been nothing but polite and attentive. But McGonagall found his silence concerning. Draco wasn't someone, who stood in shadows. He was a powerful wizard and had so much potential. She would hate it to let go to waste.
"A pureblood witch, I presume?" Severus asks with a little smile, but Draco frowns. Was he supposed to like a girl? He wrinkled his nose. That didn't sound very pleasing. Girls were loud and...
He asks, but it sounds like a statement.
"Guess I deserved that."
"Ask your friend. I have no business with her, Weasley or you. Kindly leave me be," he snarled and Harry almost looked sad. Draco refused to feel responsible. The man bought this fate onto himself. He had to live with it.
"Yes, Harry, I would be honoured."
"Look," Harry said, hoping to at least be heard out, "I know, what I did was fucking shitty, alright, I know. I'm here to fix my mistakes and talk to him. I can't let him think, that what I said yesterday were my honest feelings because they weren't! Ron was talking on and on and I know it's not only his fault but mine, for stupidly running my mouth while drunk, but I really have to tell Draco this! Please, I love him to pieces, you know that, Pansy."
"That's great, Harry," he says and pretends, he isn't heartbroken. He swallows a sob and tries to blink his tears away. He doesn't want to cry in front of Harry, doesn't want him to ask, what's wrong, because Draco
"No," he answers truthfully and his godfather's smile morphed into a straight line. Draco knew that look. Severus was about to be disappointed.
"Malfoy." Potter nods, ignoring the obvious hostility. Somehow that irritated Draco. Does Potter think, he's above him now?
He asks and she nods.
"Before we discuss the curriculum and everything else, let's do some introductions. Professor, if you will," she announces and gestures to you. The sudden attention makes you nervous, but you stand up and bow slightly again.
The god of friendship stands up and takes hold of the other god's arm.
Healing the slash took a lot of time. For the first five months, Draco was utterly useless. The sixth month was littered in screaming matches with his friends and distructive behavior. He thanked God for his house elves or he would have no dishes to eat of. After he got over his self pity and anger, he was just sad. Wondered, why he wasn't good enough, what prompted Harry to leave, if it was something that he did. Pansy advised him a mind healer. Draco thought, it was bullshit.
For the first time after the war, he doesn't feel lonely.
"What," he asks and Harry grins, "Nothing."
He says then and the god of happiness turns to him to smile.
"Our guest was a Gryffindor, he will appreciate it."
Draco looked down in his glass as if he couldn't believe his ears. And he probably couldn't. This was the first time Harry stood up to Weasley for Draco and even if it was a bit too late, he was grateful.
"Harry," he says and looks in Harry's eyes. The latter wants to look away, but one tug at his hand snaps his attention right back. He looks like he is in pain, in so
"Someday I will kill him and he will beg me for it," Potter finished and he doesn't want to believe him. Malfoy didn't seem happy or satisfied in this dynamic with Potter. He doesn't dare to call it a relationship, it made him sick just thinking about it. No, Malfoy seemed scared of Potter and somehow that thought made him grin.
He took extra care to hold his sister's dress while helping her out of the carriage. Then, he escorted them both into the castle.
It still wasn't easy.
"Ah yes, young love, wonderful," Severus tries to soothe him and cover his mishap, but Draco glares at him. Why was everyone set on making him believe, that his feelings weren't valid? His friends teased and made fun of him and even his godfather didn't take him seriously. How was he going to get Harry to notice him if the approval of his social circle was all Draco could think of?
Potter seemed to like to peel his skin off. It never failed to make him scream. The pain was tolerable after a while, but the skin under was sore and sensitive. One-touch felt like he was being set on fire and Potter liked his expressions the most. He watched in delight, poking and stroking almost carefully the red skin, sometimes harder sometimes softer. It would go on for hours and he wished in those moments, that Potter would just kill him.
with a slash of his wand.
"Do you want to try the soup again?" Malfoy asked, casting a
"Are you still alive?" The silent whisper woke him instantly, like noise, no matter how quiet, always did. The face he came to see was not that of Potter though, but just as famous: Draco Malfoy.
"I know," Draco answers, defeat in his voice. He has to depend on a lot of people's goodwill and he isn't sure, how to feel about it. He hates debts with passion, especially if he's the one, who's indebted. He wonders if he's indebted to Potter. The other almost killed him in the sixth year after all. But it wouldn't do him any good to bring that up now. He feels, that he walks already on a thin path with Harry.
"'alfoy?" Ron asks and Harry grunts affirmatively. Ron shakes his head and loads his plate with more food.
"Prove it," he growls, and oh oh, there is a wand on his neck. Reluctantly, he lets Zabini's arm go and drops his own to his sides. But he stares back in defiance. Zabini should look Harry in the eye if he tries to hex him, but the Slytherin just points his wand to his chest.
And now everything fell into place. He remembered Harry as his childhood friend, someone he held dear and close to his heart. They only played for a few months together and Draco had missed him when he had left. Harry had promised to write, but he never did. After secluding himself in sorrow, Draco had buried those fond memories and hadn't let anyone close to his heart again. Now Harry's abrupt depature made sense. He had to go back to the palace and learn everything a prince had to learn.
"Soon, darling. I just need to hurt him a little more, so that you can be his knight in shining armor," Harry teased, but Draco sneered at the thought.
Malfoy had no bruises when he came down the next day.
Harry nodded enthusiastically. "Yes."
"Why were you talking to that vermin of a Weasley?" she hissed into his ear while they walked the long corridors.
"You are all mine," he growled and Draco agreed wholeheartedly. He was Harry's, body and soul, and nobody but death could take him away. But Draco was skeptical if even Death could pull that off. After all, Harry had beat it twice already.
The god of love sneers and for a moment, he looks like the subject, the god of happiness finds. He chuckles at that.
"How did you get in here?! I didn't let you in!" he demanded then, reaching for his wand.
"No, he doesn't," he begins nervously, "and I promise to you here and now, that I will give him a chance. Nothing more and nothing less." Zabini laughs.
"When you are my friend, Harry," he says and has to swallow his own tears, "then I'm not afraid of the future."
When he came to himself, he was tied at his hands, arms, legs, and feet, and in his panic he bumped his head rather hard, making him dizzy.
Draco stared at him, looking for any signs of deceit and found none. This was Harry, honest and lovely Harry, his first friend.
The god of friendship cries out and almost falls from the tower. The god of happiness nods in understanding.
His friends proved to be of no help. They would tease him, calling him obsessed with Harry and made fun of him learning Parseltongue. But with a well-aimed Stinging Hex and a
He was admittedly curious how he'd done it and if he asked the right questions, he might even get an answer, but he was upset. With Harry, Granger and Weasley.
him," he splutters and Hermione sets her chin in her hand, still smirking.
"Bold of you to assume, there is anything left to fix, Potter. You fucking broke him, okay, he's in a really bad place because of you fucking him up and I would rather kill myself than to let you in here and hurt him!" she said and pushed him again, "So fucking leave before I make you!"
"You're a good dancer, Lord Malfoy," Harold complimented, as he swirled him around.
"Be careful with that, alright? It's very important," he said to her and she nudged his hand, demanding more attention. Draco laughed and readily gave it to her. After some more petting, she hooted softly and got ready to take off. He watched her fly and hurried back to Hogwarts. He had to see Harry's face when he opened and read his letter. Blaise frowned a little as Draco joined him at the table, clearly out of breath.
"Thanks," he murmurs and proceeds to glare at Ron, who is still munching on his toast. "We don't know that yet."
"Right away dear sister," Draco said in measured volume. He had some manners, thank you very much.
What a prick.
in him, that made Draco feel alive. He was looking forward to their meetings, to their fucks and (dare he say it) dates. He felt his chest warming and his face twitching with smiles, he wasn't comfortable sharing with Harry yet. But Harry saw them nonetheless, squeezed his hand in return and it was doing all kinds of things to Draco.
"Maybe," he says after a while and leaves the Hall with such haste, that Harry looks up from his dinner to watch him go.
But that was not of Draco's concern. He would accompany his sister for introduction to the high society instead of Father and look for a suitable maiden for himself. His fiancé had died at birth and so he had to go out and socialize. Mother had been ever so angry at Father when she heard of Astoria's death.
He's careful with the letter, turns it to see if there's a name, but there still isn't. A pang of disappointment fills him, but he doesn't allow himself to wallow in it. With his knife, he cuts the paper open and takes the letter out and the familiar hissing fills the Great Hall.
The air around them cracked and Harry quickened his pace. Draco threw his head back, arching his back, chasing his orgasm. It was just around the corner, just a little
"But not yet. He's amusing, you know? He pretends, he doesn't like the pain, but he comes from it. He craves it. These days, I don't even have to touch his cock," a satisfied grin morphed his face and he almost looked pleasant, like the boy he knew from school, "I only have to grab his hair, bite his shoulder, or slap him across the face. He's a
And he feared, what it would do.
. He had always prided himself to be unattached, aloof and passionless about his partners, his lovers. Whether they left him first or he left them, he would carry on with his life, unaffected.
that the god has no doubts and doesn't even have to look: Draco's name disappeared off his list.
She glared at him again, this time promising dark and awful things. "Don't make me regret it, Potter, or I will never forgive you."
It wasn't supposed to end like this.
"You'll get over him, mate, you'll see. You just need a date for the bloody Ball and then you have something else to think about," he promises and Harry thinks that Ron tries to reassure him, but all it does is shoving him into his thinking again. About Potion homework. Not Malfoy. Certainly not Malfoy.
"Hello, love," Draco chuckled, bringing his hand in Harry's hair, "Everything settled?"
You have to read the whole thing twice before believing it. You have been approved! On the first try! Your friends had said as much, they always had more confidence in your skill than you and had laughed when you said, you were unsure. But they had been right and this letter proves enough. You write back immediately, obviously, because McGonagall is a woman you shouldn't leave waiting and so you send Oliver on his way to Scotland. You watch the owl go and Floo your friends right after because this calls for celebrating.
"Yes?" he asked, tone neutral. Harry frowned. He didn't seem to like the indifference.
He wondered, what to make of that.
"Both."
"It's a boy," he says then and looks hesitantly at Draco. He considers Harry carefully but lets a small smile grace his lips.
"Please have an eye on Lyra, will you, son?" Mother asked, no, demanded really and all Draco could give was an tired smile. Lyra would run off and mingle with her friends the moment they would set foot into the castle and he would be forced to tail after her like a puppy. He already dreaded it.
But, oh, was he afraid to even ask! He was confident to ask a girl because that's what his father prepared him for. Marriage was something he never could escape. His father made deals with other pureblood families, trading their daughters for something else. But a man? How could one possibly woo a man and in addition to that, Harry Potter? He was asked every day, since the announcement, but Harry declined every time.
They sat in silence for a while, clearly trying to grasp the situation.
Fucking Malfoy.
"Good. You are aware, that you will share a room with Mr. Potter?" Draco rolls his eyes. The next condition, he had to follow. When the Ministry said, that Potter will watch him, they didn't say that he would do that for 24 hours. Going to a school with dozens of students, who hold a grudge? Annoying, but manageable. But sharing a room with Potter? Absolutely terrifying.
Draco Malfoy didn't even
"You're welcome," she said sweetly. "I would do more, but Weasley and Granger would call the Aurors on me."
"Merlin, Granger, are you his mother? I'm sure, he'll be fine on his own," he said and sneered a bit.
"WHAT?" you yell, and the few students in the Great Hall stop in their conversations and turn to the staff table. Even Malfoy and Potter stop their weird thing and look at you with curiosity. How bad you wish, Potter would have looked at you like that before. You shrink in your seat and after a few seconds, the discussions pick up again. McGonagall gives you a funny look and your neck heats again in embarrassment. Longbottom seems to try hard to contain his laughter.
"I wouldn't be his date, even if they paid me," Draco tries to deadpan, but his voice cracks. Blaise looks at him amused, so Draco just coughs and frowns.
The god of happiness almost laughs.
"Hermione," he started, still speaking through his hands, "we fought a war, haven't we?" She nodded to agree.
"You promised to behave!" she whispers angry and Weasley rubs his hurting head. "But 'Mione..." he whines pathetically and Draco chuckles amused. Potter eyes him, out of distrust or interest, Draco couldn't say. But there was no hate or anger, so Draco continued being civil. Potter somehow didn't know, how to deal with Draco being nice, but after three days or so, he responded if Draco greeted him and he even let him talk about some Quidditch match. It was still incredibly awkward, but it was a starting point.
"Surely your highness must know, what that would convey. Dancing two times with the same person speaks of interest in pursuing a courtship," Draco said.
"I told him, that he could," Potter said softly and his eyes widened in panic. Malfoy was his only hope of getting out of here alive!
(See the end of the chapter for
"As you know, my father intends to let me marry for love and he never specified the gender of my future spouse," Harry said with a wicked grin, "And something tells me, that he already likes you very much. I'm sure, he won't be against it."
"Of course I know Parseltongue, every Slytherin knows, what that is, Potter," Zabini appears to be annoyed and taps with his foot on the stone.
"I love you, you know?" Harry said and squeezed her hand.
"I know, you don't particularly like them much, except for Malfoy," - "Hey," he interrupts, but she ignores him and continues, "and if you don't plan to respond positively to their confession, then I don't think, you should pursue them at all," she says empathically and Harry scowls in annoyment.
By Merlin! Why hadn't he thought about it before?! He could do it in Parseltongue! It was special enough to stand out, and it wouldn't lead to him, because no one knew, he was a Parselmouth! Draco grinned. He had the perfect plan and the perfect setting. Now he only had to write and charm the whole thing...
"I asked Rolanda. We have three hours until curfew," he said and Draco had teased him for calling Madam Hooch by her first name. Harry laughed and Draco was addicted. He swore himself to keep Harry as close as possible. For now, he lets Harry cry until he calmed down enough to hold out on his own.
, he only like one boy! Surely the world shouldn't have anything against that! It wasn't like it was their business anyway! He tells Severus so.
"Draco deserves that apology more than I do," he scoffed, "In fact, I have a lot of apologizing to do as well. I can only hope, he will even hear me out."
"It just got a bit out of hand, geez, don't make such a big deal out of it," Harry grumbled and frowned at Draco's expression. "Ron and I haven't seen each other in weeks, we had a lot to talk about."
"I asked," and now she's glaring, "if you were available for a visit in Muggle London with the third years. Harry volunteered to escort." You nod hastily and hold out your hand for Potter to shake.
"Obviously he will. But it's curious, isn't it? You were on each other's throats through school and now you're dating?" Draco had to chuckle at that.
Draco wrote Harry a second letter and he's even more nervous about this one than the last. He fed the Hogwarts owl some treats again and she hooted softly to get him to pet her again. She quite liked him, he noticed, not like his own owl. After she was satisfied, he gave her his letter and pets her one last time.
"That sounds perfect, love."
"I wouldn't have taken it," he says, but Potter shakes his head.
"Do you remember, in our First Year we had detention together?" Harry asks and lets himself just hover over the branches. Draco nods.
"You are our guest," his kidnapper said and now, in the light, he could clearly see that man's face.
"I don't know if I can come down again soon," Malfoy said, touching his neck. Blue bruises bloomed there and he felt an irrational spur of anger. Potter wasn't only harming him, he was also hurting Malfoy.
Not Harry.
He entered the Leakey on seven o'clock sharp and noted, that Harry wasn't there yet. Still caught up in work apparently, so he let his gaze wander to find Granger at the very end of the establishment in a secluded area. Courtesy of the owner, Draco supposed and made his way through the tables and smoothly avoided legs in his way.
Harry stood straighter and lazily pointed to his parents.
"I wonder," he said after he stopped poking little needles in his nails, "if Draco will respond the same as you." And so he screamed again.
Harry sighs, sits on one of the sofas and looks in the fire. Draco follows suit.
"And I spoke to Ron," Harry added almost as an afterthought, and Draco looked at him in bewilderment, "He will never speak to you like that again. I made him swear on his mother." Because he knew, this was important to Draco. Malfoy's were prideful people and Draco had to swallow his for Harry far too often. It was time to give him his confidence and snark back.
"Draco?" Blaise hesitantly asks from outside the door and knocks. Draco doesn't pause, unlocks the door and hugs his best friend, who is surprised but hugs him back.
That was the time Harry choose to come back. Somehow he escaped the Prophet and Draco was confronted with him while shopping for Pansy's birthday.
He says and she opens his list, flies over the names, and then smiles.
"Ah, Draco, my boy, please raise your head," King James's voice was pleasent and deep, but Draco cringed nonetheless at the overfamiliarity. He had catched the King's attention prior, due to his own thoughtlessness. He had spoken of war tactics without knowing, that the King was right behind him, listening to all his ramblings and instead of scolding him for his presumptions, King James had looked thoughtful and just clapped him on his shoulder with an hearty laugh.
The god of friendship says and his anger affects the other god because now they're both holding each other at their clothes. The god of happiness has to stop this.
Harry's head snapped up. "What?!"
surprised him. But the pain on his cheek was self-explanatory. Pansy had just slapped him.
The god of happiness is practically swooning.
The students didn't seem to have caught any of that, but the other Professors have. They all look at you warily or disappointed and McGonagall glares at you icy.
"People like us?" he echoes and Severus nods solemnly. "Men, who like... men," he says and Draco's eyes widen. He didn't like
"I only want, what's best for you, Harry," she whispered with tears in her eyes and Harry gently took her hand.
The god of friendship groans and pinches his nose.
"And you trust me."
And if the god of friendship and the god of love left together, then that's something the god of happiness will never tell.
The god of sadness leaves after that. He has to visit subjects as well and the god of happiness hopes, that he has one day more work to do than his brother. For now, he resigns himself to his task. The subject is sleeping soundly and the other human watches him. The god inclines his head in confusion. There is no danger the human would have to fear, as the subject is asleep, so he wouldn't have to watch him dream. But Harry Potter, the god decides to call him now, is looking at the subject with an unusual expression. It's not quite a smile, but it's also no frown. It's no suspicion. Maybe resignment? Content? The god isn't quite sure, but he sees potential in this human.
to us and he hasn't made fun of you even
you while you were crying and probably needed my help..." he squeezes Draco's hand again.
"He's just not very welcoming to you," he says and Draco nods his head in acknowledgment. Weasley really wasn't that friendly. Granger had surprised him with the studying and he appreciated her. But Potter was the nicest of them all. He even started conversations now. Draco looks at his feet. Should he make a joke about it? He decides to tell the truth. He defended Draco in front of his best friend. Potter deserves that much.
"And we all sacrificed so much, haven't we?" Again a nod.
His last words seemed to get Draco out of his stupor. He looked up at Harry with suspiciously wet cheeks. "You mean that, don't you."
"Then tell us everything that letter says," Ron suggests and Harry nods.
"Simple, mate," Ron suggests, "you just have to test the theory. Maybe scare him a little, leave for a while, so he learns to appreciate you."
"Rest assured Potter, you can expect
"Really?" he asked, not quite sure of it. But Malfoy nodded confidently.
The Ravenclaws are ducking their head in fear. If there are some authorities they respect, it's their Head of House and Madam Pince. She is essential for their studying and it would be devastating for Ravenclaw students to lose access to the library.
After the first task, Harry was as popular as ever. He seemed to be in a fight with the Weasel, however, but he snapped at Draco when he tried to cheer him up. Draco shook his head. He sacrificed himself to be laughed at, as Moody transfigured him into a ferret and quickly left after that, out of pure embarrassment, but Harry didn't seem so keen to talk to him. It was depressing.
"The Headmistress wants to speak with you after we arrive," Potter says and just looks outside the window.
"Yes. Err, no," he says and Ron frowns.
"Because you're bad for me. And I don't spent time on things, that aren't good for me," he declared and Harry looked a minute away from cardiac arrest.
This could very well be the chance of your lifetime, something you worked so hard for and now the fruit of your labor is just sitting there, waiting to be picked.
"Would you be up for that?" Harry finally asked and Draco had to wonder, why he didn't just demand it. Draco would never be able to deny him anything, whether about him or anything else.
"Yes, of course," he drawls, "I am Professor Malfoy and I teach the Art of Potions. I have been working here for the last five years, a pleasure to meet you." He doesn't add anything else and leans back. Potter huffs. "I already introduced myself, but sure. I'm Harry Potter, I teach Defense. Also been here for five years."
Outside his next headache waited. Potter was leaning against the wall, as he was earlier, looking relaxed and at ease. His eyes were closed and it almost seemed, like he was sleeping. As Draco left the stairs, his eyelids snapped open and just because he could, Draco glared at him, already forgetting the promise to try to get along.
"I hope, you're gone, when I'm finished with my shower," Pansy grumbled in the morning and kicked Harry in his calf, as she rolled out of her bed. Ah, it was one of those days, he mused.
"Blaise?" he whispers and Blaise nods, "Yes." Draco acknowledges him and then went back to staring out of the window. Blaise, a little bit unsure, what to do, sits down beside him and musters his friend. He looks... detached. Like he wasn't there at all. All of a sudden Blaise got angry at Harry again. Draco had tried so hard to get Harry to notice him. Sure, sometimes he was just over the place, but then the other times he would do something thoughtful and Blaise knows, Draco would do it all over again. That's how far he's gone for Potter. Tentatively, he lifts his hand and sets it on Draco's arm. Grey eyes flicker to set on his face. They're a little bit red around the edges and Blaise knows, Draco has been crying again.
"Yes?"
"Lyra Valentina Malfoy! Come to me and I'll find it for you." And there was already the favouritism. Draco rolled his eyes. Mother might believe she was subtle with her choice of favourite child, but she really wasn't. Lyra was the apple of her eye, her golden child, perfection without markle.
Harry is fidgeting in his seat like he's sitting on a bee nest. Hermione glares at him every now and then, but she is mostly bemused by his antics. Ron is eating as much as he can like he always did and Harry finds that weirdly comforting.
"I love you too," she said and squeezed back.
"Yes, apologies," he said, paused and added "Granger," with a smirk and noted with delight the little twitch of her lip.
You must confess, that your expectations have been exceeded. The Headmistress herself is waiting for you in front of the wards and she nods regally in greeting. You bow slightly because your mother drilled manners in your head when you could barely walk, but it had been a while and McGonagall seems amused by your attempt. Your neck heats in embarrassment, but she saves you as she holds her hand out.
"She threatened me with murder before she let me in. She did her part, really, don't worry," he said and allowed himself a short fond smile. Pansy always protected her own furiously, like a lioness protected her cubs and she would resent him for the comparison because they were all too hung up on their houses, but she would burn the world for those dear to her. Draco knew, he counted to her special ones and relaxed a bit at Harry's mentioning her bloodthirst.
"Go!" Malfoy said and so he went.
"The beginning is always difficult," Harry said after he introduced Draco to his idea.
"You're coming with me," he said, but Malfoy shook his head.
"We rarely are, but we have always time for you, Minerva, don't you worry," he grins, takes her hand to kiss it soundly, and McGonagall chuckles. You note the first name and you haven't been offered to use it and somehow you feel excluded again.
"What? That asshole, how dare he," Ron growled, "I'll floo call him and straighten him out."
"It's not that funny," you pout, crossing your arms and that sends Longbottom in another fit. You wait until he's done to glare.
"Harry, do you know what bloody time it is?" Draco asked and crossed his arms over his chest. Normally that would be sexy as hell, but Harry wasn't in the mood to be swayed by Draco's unfair good looks.
He chuckles. Destiny is a funny thing. No one is really sure, how it works or how she does it, but the god of happiness is certain:
"So, a friend, huh?" he smirked and Pansy stopped coloring her eyes to look at him with a sweet smile. "Don't worry, Harry, he's not a competition for you," she said and got back to work, "besides, we're not like that."
He could no longer deny it. He was done for.
and his personal favorite
"I'm sorry, mate," Ron said and grimaced when Harry glared at him.
"No, it's bloody not. Malfoy is a git and I don't get why you're head over heels for him," Ron said.
"How could you promise our son to a sick family like that?! They had no healthy children in almost three generations," she nagged and Draco could only roll his eyes at her. She hadn't been all that interested in him and left Father in charge of his raising. That Father was almost never there was convenient. Draco had seen more nannies than his own Mother. And she wondered, why he was so cold and short with her.
"I don't know, what you said to Malfoy, but let me spell it out for you plainly, Alex: You have no right to berate him, your fellow colleague, or me and you don't have any say, with whom I spent my time with. And if I catch you blabbering bullshit again, then don't blame me for the consequences!" he snarls, and then he takes off with Malfoy in a row.
"He's definitely going to Hogwarts. Not in Gryffindor, I think. He wrote something about Gryffindor bravery and that he doesn't have it," he explains and pauses. That comment sounded weirdly patronizing as if the writer was going to tease Harry with it. Not a Hufflepuff then. Hermione seems to think the same thing because she crosses Hufflepuff out on her list.
"But why not?" you ask pouting. And Potter takes Malfoy's hand and stands up. He looks down at you and the sneer on his face put's Malfoy's almost to shame.
"Good afternoon," his kidnapper greeted him joyously, pressing his hands on his hips, "and welcome to my home. I hope, you're comfortable, because you will stay here for a long time." The smile he received was sickening.
"So nice of you to join us," Potter drawled and he had never heard him so
"What, Potter? Didn't thought, it would play out like this?" Zabini asks, and he's smiling, so Harry allows himself a smirk.
"Oy, Zabini!" Harry yelled and the Slytherin glared at him with such malice, Harry had to pause. He never spoke with Zabini as long as he can remember, so what reason did Zabini have to be so hostile? A flash of silver hair came into his memory, the dejected look on Malfoy's face yesterday morning. Zabini had literally dragged Malfoy out of the Great Hall. Had they fought?
"No, he didn't," Harry replies and reads the letter again. It fills him with an odd feeling of peace. The writer obviously knows him well, so he must be going to Hogwarts. He pays enough attention to Harry to notice the little things, that made him happy. He reckons, even Ron doesn't know, that he's the happiest when he's flying. From the way the letter is written, Harry can only guess the type of person his secret admirer is, but he's intrigued. He wants to know, who it is.
"And I love you for that, 'Mione. But only I can decide, what's best for me. And at the moment and hopefully still for a long time, it will be Draco," he said, smiling at them both. Draco scoffed and pouted, but the flush high on his cheeks betrayed him.
"With all due respect, Headmistress, I don't want to be friends with Potter. I am thankful for what he has done," he pauses, taking a sip from his tea, "but he and I are not compatible."
"You'd be surprised, darling," he smirked, kissed him soundly on the mouth and didn't react to the sharp inhale on the other side of the table.
The Professors and students all helped and decorated the whole castle. Hogwarts summed in delight and it was all thanks to its festive mood, that the students slept in warmer sheets. Everyone was excited and the brave ones even asked their crush for the Yule ball out, an event Professor McGonagall insisted they would hold.
"I see you in Hogwarts," Potter says then as if Draco has a choice.
And he planned to go through with it tonight. Draco had grudgingly accepted, that Harry wanted to go out alone with Ron, but got Harry to promise to come to Draco's place later. Harry didn't know, what Draco had been planning, but he had been giddy for at least a week. So he stumbled to the Apparation point and hoped, he wouldn't splinch himself. Arrived at Draco's he had to sit down for a minute to get the dizziness under control. Draco must have heard him coming, because the door was opened and Harry landed flat on his back, looking up at a very annoyed Draco.
"She's pleased with you as well. You've shown your manners and your abilities before and you're known for your wit and knowledge. She wanted someone wise for me, not beauty." Harry smiled at his mother, who returned it with a regal nod. That's why she had been watching Draco so intently. He had been judged, not Lyra.
- whatever he happened to take his possessive love out on. And Draco never once complained about Harry's love. It was the most beautiful thing he ever experienced and he couldn't imagine waking up without Harry there to kiss and touch. If he had to choose between his friends or Harry, his parents or Harry, his job or Harry, his possessions or Harry, then the answer would always be the same. Harry was his reason to breathe, Harry's happiness was Draco's only concern.
someone, that wasn't him. He wants to take his hand away, to curl up and cry for a long time, but he couldn't bring himself too. Harry looks like he needs a friend. Who was Draco to deny him that?
"I must go," Malfoy said and left again in a hurry. It was already too late when he realized, that he forgot to vanish the rest of the soup.
"And you're sure, you're not going to put your tail between your legs and run if you see him? Because I sure as hell can picture you doing it. And he doesn't deserve that," Zabini's eyes flash dangerously and Harry has to gulp.
That's all.
He wasn't prepared for the indifference to hurt this much. Blaise watches him with silent sympathy.
"Watch it, Alex," is the only warning you get. But you don't want to listen. Finally, you found some ammunition against Malfoy, and you intend to use it one way or another.
"Malfoy," he says and you are not even ashamed to bump your head at the wall after he leaves.
"I helped to destroy you. How can you accept me this easily?" he asks, not expecting an answer. He remembers reading something in the fourth year, that the castle has a will on its own and that it will deny entrance to anyone it doesn't like. Hogwarts seems to laugh, the ground shakes a little bit, and the fire flickers.
"And you are both males, you are of the same age, you go to the same school, you learn the same things, you fought in the same war. I'd say, you have a lot to bond over, Mr. Malfoy."
And his plan really worked! It was the right decision to use Harry Potter as his middleman. This young human would ensure, that the subject will be happy.
"What, Potter? I'm quite busy, you know," he couldn't keep the annoyance out of his voice and Harry scowled.
"And we will get him all high and hoping and then," he paused, pressing a hungry kiss on Draco's lips, "when he's desperate to flee, to hold your hand, to
The year was going by and the Tournament was starting. Everyone seemed excited about the tasks and the other schools. The boys in his year were fawning over the Beauxbaton girls, but Draco found himself watching the Durmstrang boys instead. There was a weird beauty in the way they were holding themselves. They reminded him a little bit of wild beasts. Draco smirked. He could appreciate the raw beauty in that. But despite that, he cheered for Harry, as the Gryffindor fought with the dragon. Blaise and Pansy were obviously amused, but Draco justified, that everything was better than a Hufflepuff. They didn't seem to buy it, but they left him alone.
"I have some names, but let me be honest, Harry. Your secret admirer is most likely a Slytherin and from the looks of the spellwork at least in our grade. You know, what that means." Harry grimaces at that.
"Well, be that as it be, we really have to begin now," she says and all the other Professors take their seats.
"No, I think I want to see this," he says very slowly as if he was speaking to a toddler and you want to snap back, but Potter puts his hand on Malfoy's arm and shakes his head infinitesimally. Malfoy sighs as if he's doing Potter a favor and leaves.
The god of friendship says then grateful and takes out his own list.
He didn't remember, how he ended up on Ron's couch, but Harry woke up there with a massive headache and the sinking feeling, that he lost something precious.
But Pansy seemed to read his thoughts, as she passed him and tucked on his arm to get his ear to her mouth. "Don't you dare," she hissed and Harry lifts his hands in silent apology. Maybe later then.
The conversation with Severus was eye-opening. Maybe that was the reason, Harry ignored Draco? Because he was scared, what the others would think? Or maybe he was also pressured to be someone he was not. Draco tries not to think about it too much, as he prepares his notes and homework for the next class. For the time being, he holds his feelings and his new skill for himself.
for my Professors and I find it alarming, that a mere student is so touchy with school authority. Can't say, I'm surprised though. Everything the Goldern Trio needs is a priority for Hogwarts." The castle seemed to disagree because the wind gets colder and Draco suppresses a shiver.
but he refuses to let Harry see that. Harry shifts his legs so they're across each other and tugs Draco's hand into his lap. He plays a little bit with his fingers until he has found some courage to talk again.
The next time he opened his eyes, the room was bright with
"You know Parseltongue, don't you?" Harry asks with a smirk and Zabini schooles his expression into careful indifference. He knew something, Harry was sure of it.
"So don't go around and spread any gossip, alright? He doesn't deserve that."
"Draco," he begins, but fails to continue. He shakes his hand and lets go of Draco's hand, but Draco is fast to grab his.
"Don't act as if you care now. You never give me the time of the day, sometimes I'm not even sure if we're dating or not," Harry bit back.
"Maybe I'm getting sick?" he mutters and hopes, that Blaise buys it. He doesn't comment on it and goes back to insulting Harry.
and he called you names... I just can't understand, why you're suddenly so... so...
"No, I didn't. I'm bloody happy, it did though." Zabini pauses and regards him with a calculating glance and all of a sudden, Harry feels uncomfortable again.
He says and she laughs. It's quiet for a while. Draco and Harry dance on the ball. Draco beams at Harry and Harry smiles right back. They share their first kiss there. The god of happiness could hear the god of love cry in delight.
and he had my mother and my father was... but I could have helped more with
"It's time, Draco."
"Oh Harry," Draco sighed, as he was led downstairs. The room was white, clean and Harry had installed soundproof devices on the walls. That's why he was asking about the music earlier that week. There was a bed with chains, a desk with Harry's favorite toys, but the thing in the middle took his breath away. A Judas cradle.
"Oho? Are we friends now, Potter?" he asks, but he doesn't hear the confidence in his voice. Instead, it almost breaks with insecurity. In their first year, Potter didn't want his friendship. He called him out, embarrassed him in front of all the other students, and left Draco with burning hate. He worries his lip between his teeth and Potter takes his hand again.
! I also did some things I'm not proud of," he grimaces with a pained expression. Draco suspects, he thinks of the bathroom incident in sixth year.
"What? Fate? Draco, what are you talking about?" Harry swayed on his feet.
"No," Harry glooms and shrinks in his seat.
Harry's abode remained unknown. The Prophet tried and failed to pin him down. Draco considered hiring a private investigator, but Pansy talked him out of it. Yes, he deserved an explanation. No, he was in no state to hear it. She promised him to look out for Harry while she traveled however and Draco was grateful. It calmed his mind for a bit.
If the god of happiness could cry, he would. His brother was always looking out for him, grounding him and holding his hand in distress, and here he was, a god troubled by a human. He sighs again.
"I love your smile, you know?" Harry said and proceeded to kiss his lips softly, then more insistent. Draco never failed to groan eagerly at that and Harry would reward him with a squeeze on his hips, thighs, ass, neck, or
The long talks have been the basis of their relationship.
The journey was uneventful, safe for the loud noises around the castle. The festivies were  in full row and music was coming from everywhere. Common folk wasn't allowed to participate in the bal itself, but the market was lit with laterns and performers were hired to entertain the lower class. They all lapped up the bones the royal family was throwing them, none the wiser that the owners were dining juicy meat and tasty beverages.
"What was it?" Harry asked and this time, the searching gaze lay on her. It wasn't comfortable, she had to admit. She had to take a few deep breaths to steel herself for the conversation she didn't want to have.
"No, Ron," Harry signed resigned, "I deserve it."
Draco took all of his words with fearsome silence. Then, he said slowly, "You really think that I don't love you."
The god of happiness explains and the god of friendship looks at his list.
"He's a bloody arsehole and now he steals my girlfriend!" Draco one day overheard Weasley say and he hides behind a corner to spy. Call him nosy, but he was a Slytherin. He had to do this.
"Is that you, Draco, darling?" Pansy yelled out of her bathroom and Gorgeous man visibly relaxed. He really must have been concerned for Pansy, Harry noted.
He had yet to see the second person Potter spoke so fondly about. He doubted the spouse knew of their husband's sick "hobby" as Potter called it and the person never came, no matter how loud he screamed his lungs out.
"I will help you," he promises and Hogwarts seemed content with that.
"Nonsense Harry. Why wouldn't he?" he tries and Harry chuckles, but it sounds bitter.
"I'll heal you, but you have to stay quiet, this will hurt a lot," Malfoy whispered and the following
You avoid Potter after that dreadful interaction after the meeting. It's not very hard. You see him at dinner, once again engaging Malfoy in a conversation and you wonder, why they're on such good terms. You've learned, that Malfoy is head of Slytherin (of course, that stupid git) and Potter head of Gryffindor and the rivalry between these two has always been public knowledge. You try and snoop a little bit more, but the older Professors are strangely tight-lipped about Malfoy's and Potter's relationship, so you bet on Longbottom. After two glasses of wine, you struggle to steer the conversation to the heads of Slytherin and Gryffindor.
Potter came down the next day. His eyes widened for a second, realizing that someone other than him was here. He looked at the ceiling for a bit, amusement on his face and that was the moment he feared for Malfoy.
"You promised me breakfast and coffee, you bint," Harry grumbled back and stretched his arms over his head. He loved Pansy's bed. It was wide and comfortable and she had this tiny, blue pillow, that Harry attempted to steal every time he slept over. But she always managed to snatch it back, before he left her apartment. So he had to be content just cuddling it.
But it was Malfoys hunched form, that came down the stairs and relief filled his chest. Malfoy crossed the distance in long strides,
"Yes, that is quite right. But 'rivalry' isn't the word I would use," he mutters and takes another sip. He watches the liquid move inside his glass, seemingly deep in thought. You kind of want to interrupt, but he seems to ponder over past events. Maybe he will tell you if you're patient. And you are rewarded.
But Draco was not.
"He will put all his trust in you, waiting and anticipating your visits. And if we're lucky, he will even fall for you," Harry said and Draco turned his head, wanting to see his husband's expression. The dangerous smile made his heart beat faster and his cock stirred again in interest.
"Please enjoy the night, Draco, Miss Malfoy. We'll be surely speaking to you again," King James dismissed them and Draco breathed out relieved.
"Potter is fine for now," he answers and you are a little bit disappointed. McGonagall had said, that Potter was big on first names, but now he had been shoved into the "last name" box. You are determined to make it out by the end of the week.
He says firmly, but gently and separates both of them. They are still glaring and huffing, but at least they're less tense.
"No, you don't get to do that. You spoke honestly to me now, I can see it," Draco said and fat tears rolled down his cheeks, "I would have wished for a different truth, but I guess, you can't outrun fate."
"This is not over, Harry! And if he lays one finger on Hermione, I swear, I will hex him into next week!" he threatens and Draco watches him stomp off to his girlfriend. Potter stands alone in the corridor, glaring after them and signing. Draco debates walking away, but Potter's pained face stops him. He dusts off his uniform and steps through the corridor to Potter.
"I... I would like to talk to you... About last year and... everything really," he stated with such confidence, that Draco almost indulged him.
"No, Draco, my love...."
"My apologies. What were you asking?"
"You will not tell, who it is, right?" Draco asks, but it's barely a whisper. He is curious, oh
"You'll never kiss him again."
"Maybe someone, who isn't out then? They've recently discovered, that they like men and couldn't understand it at first. So they expected you also to be confused," she reasons and Harry can bring himself to agree with that. He frowns. He knew, he was bisexual, when he kissed Cho and later Florentin from Beauxbaton. So he could understand the hesitation and fear. Harry felt bad for the writer. He must be in a very confusing place and nevertheless, he dared to send a letter like this. He must remember to correct the writer later, that he was definitely brave. Not brave enough to sign with his name, but the effort was there. Harry could appreciate the effort.
He went through the list with an alarming tempo. He had to skip some people because he just couldn't find them, but he was already through half of the names and he only had offended at least 30 students. A new record, Harry mused and went back to the dormitories. On his way, he crossed Blaise Zabini, also a name on his list. Harry hissed at him and he could see Blaise's eyes widen in recognition. Was he Harry's secret admirer then?
"I don't talk about him," Harry denies again, stabs his own potato and Hermione looks at him, with something like pity. He doesn't want to think about why she's looking at him like that. And it doesn't even make sense what they're saying! He doesn't think or talk about Malfoy at all! Harry has more important things to think about! The Tournament. Or the Death-Eater attack. His friends. His potion homework. Or Malfoy. And there he goes again. Harry slams his head on the table. The git can't seem to stay out of Harry's mind for five minutes! How was he supposed to concentrate when the prat was haunting him the whole time?
He says and there is regret in his eyes. Surprisingly the god of love steps to him and tugs at his arm.
"Now that you know everything and we don't have any secrets left to tell, will you answer me, Draco?" Harry asked hopeful, offering his hand again. "Will you let me court you and get to know you better?"
"Oh, don't look at me like that. I'm a Slytherin, you know? I would never save you, without saving me first," Malfoy said and Potter laughed.
"Really interesting. The writer must have charmed the letter to let the words be read out loud. Do you reckon, it was the real voice? No spell?" Hermione asks and Harry has to smile at her eager mind. Hermione would always be too curious for her own good.
"Move," is all he says, and he looks positively murderous. So you follow his command and move out of his way, but you shuffle closer after he sits down.
He admits and stands up, dusting up his clothes, even if there is no dust. A habit he picked up, after watching Draco. She eyes him curiously and he gives her his list.
"It's alright," Malfoy said, "we have a little more time today." He wondered, how long that was, following Malfoy's wand movements. He cleaned him up, fed him water and soup, rubbed his back when he couldn't keep it down.
"Of course."
His kidnapper was Harry Potter.
"Ah, you must miss your Romeo, huh?" Potter asked and stood up, walking up the stairs and he tried to go after Potter, stop him from whatever he would do to Malfoy. But he was tied up, not able to move.
"Oh yes, Harry!" Draco sobbed and found, that if he couldn't walk tomorrow, he wouldn't mind.
"Who is your partner then?" you ask and you sound a tad desperate. Potter doesn't seem to pick up on that. Small miracles.
However, he had a long year thinking about what he wants. And what he deserves.
"Trial? What kind of trial?" you inquire and Longbottom looks at you like you've grown a second head.
"Hermione, can you help me find him? I'd like to give him an answer to his face," Harry asks, and Hermione's eyes glint with anticipation.
The god grits his teeth. He would not give up. He promised his brother to do his duty and he never broke a promise, so he wouldn't start now. So he pops himself onto his tower and watches again. He must have overlooked something. What was it?
"Would you be so kind, Professor?" McGonagall gestures to the blond man on her left.
"I agree," she said and crossed her arms, "what you did was moronic and fucking hurtful and you deserve far more than what I'm doing now but he's fucking miserable without you." She signed and looked away. "Even after all you did to him, he still misses your sorry ass and you don't deserve that kind of devotion."
"It's alright. Consider it payback for all the water and food," he said and Malfoy cried.
," he paused again, shifting his hips luring a gasp out of him, "then we will drop him on our new fancy toy."
"I don't know, Harry," she says with a knowing smirk, cutting her potatoes, and Harry scowls because he doesn't like that look on her face. She knows something he doesn't and teases him with that and if Harry was asked, what he would change at his friends, he would name Hermione's knowing smirk.
"Why would I do that?" he opted asking instead.
He thought about refusing it, but Potter was never generous with food or water. He gave him the bare minimum to survive but never more, so he lapped the water like a dog.
"Potter, I'm really sorry for all the things I did to you. I know, it isn't much comfort now and I should have said it right after the war, and I should have...
"Nothing, Professor," he says and she shakes her head.
Harry thinks, "then I can do that and treat him with the same respect. You don't have to like him, Ron. Just don't insult him." Weasley looks ready to snap at him again, but then Granger steps around the corner and Weasley just huffs.
Hermione grumbles in concentration and wraps a strand of her hair around her finger. Harry finds it terribly endearing.
"I'm sorry, is my politeness unsatisfactory?"
The subject gets older and older and with every experience he makes, his heart grows heavier and his mind a bit darker. His moments of happiness decreased until they were nonexistent and the god wonders, why he never noticed. When the subject was still a child, he visited him quite often, sometimes over a thousand times a year. But now, he sees, he hasn't visited this subject in over three years. He briefly puzzled, if this was the will of the goddess of destiny too. If he could feel resent, he probably would. This is the closest he can get to human emotions. But he refused to give up on this subject. He was a challenge, a test he was willing to take and confident to pass.
And Draco found himself in a conflict. On one side, he enjoyed his new friendship with Harry very much. They ate and talked, walked to class together, play chess, and at night they would sneak into the kitchen and devour whatever the elves presented them. He liked it. It was easy and all he wished for eight years ago. But now he was older. He found himself depressed when he thought about their friendship after Hogwarts. He came quickly to the conclusion, that friendship alone wasn't enough. He wanted more from Harry.
The god of love counters back and the god of friendship gasped.
"You have someone, you want to ask?" Draco winces and hides his face in his hands again. He wished for better friends.
"Shall we then?" Draco asked uselessly and escorted them into the snake pit. Their names were announced and several of Draco's acquiantances turned their heads to greet them with a toast. Draco smiled in return, left Mother with her chatty friends and then introduced his sister to the royal family. As the momentary head of house it was his responsibility to represent the Malfoy name and so he bowed in front of the royal family and waited for King James's command.
The god of friendship smiles at his colleague and the god of happiness watches them intently. When they notice, they both look away and frown.
The god of happiness asks the god of love and the latter opens his list.
"Where does this come from?" Severus counters, hoping to deflect. The knowing glint in Draco's eyes tells him, it's futile. Draco sighs again and watches the tea leaves settle on the bottom of the cup. He was never a friend of divination, but he would give everything to know if Harry might... like him back.
"So, you've been to school with Potter and Malfoy, right?" you ask hesitantly, but your worry is for naught. Longbottom laughs and munches on his potatoes.
"Maybe that would be a start," she says nonetheless, taking her own cup of tea. Draco glares at his hands, holding tears back. The war made him and his family criminals and he was receiving punishment for it. Clearly the whole school still hated him. After his NEWTS he would drown in the Ministry or die trying to survive. There was no need to apologize. The dead would not come back, the loss would not hurt less and he could not pay back the tears that fell. Had he be the one, some Ex-Death-Eater apologized to, he's not even sure if he would hear them out. Too deep was the pain and too recent the war.
So he tries to calm him down and distract him. He convinced Madam Hooch to let him and Draco fly and they went over the Black Lake and over some parts of the Forbidden Forest.
to hold him down while peeling the skin on his feet. Potter kept everything neat and muggle and he was nearly impressed by how creative muggles were with torture devices. He almost bit his tongue off, but Potter grabbed and fixed it with a stronghold.
The room was dark, with no windows or lights, and a faint drumming sound was all he could hear. He tried to find out, how his hands were tied, or if he could locate his wand. But the
You arrive punctually and McGonagall nods at you approvingly. Potter and the other man are not there yet, you notice with disappointment, but you use the chance to talk with the other Professors. Pomona Sprout and her apprentice Neville Longbottom are the most welcoming of the bunch. They pelt you with questions, not at all satisfied with your carefully chosen answers. By the end of your talk, they made you promise to visit them in the Greenhouses and you're happy, that they try to include you.
"She didn't tell me that," he whispered and Draco almost pitied him.
"Lovely, dear," was what she said, "you may rise. It was a pleasure meeting you."
"Why am I here?" he tried to ask, but all that came out was "Hai ang ah hing" and his kidnapper seemed to find that hilarious, but understood him regardless.
Not like some other students here."
Potter continues, but you don't listen to him. You watch Malfoy gripping his chair and you are delighted by his response to your taunting. But you are too engrossed in your thing, that you didn't hear the closing applause of the Sorting or McGonagall's speech. You startle badly as Potter taps you rather hard on the shoulder. Not that you would object. Because any kind of contact with Potter is good.
"Harry and Draco were always fighting as long as I can remember. They were even fighting before they were sorted into their houses. Harry never told me, why they didn't get along, but for the whole time they were staying at Hogwarts, they were at each other's throats. Draco, as you may know, is excellent at gloating and pushing your buttons. He was an awful person in school and he used to bully me. Never mind that he didn't need to - people would have followed him even if he didn't, but his upbringing was a big part, why Draco and Harry never saw eye to eye. And Harry is so easy to rile up, it was even funny sometimes," he stops talking for a moment, and a small smile sneaks on his face. You look to your other side: Potter and Malfoy aren't talking anymore, but they steal food from each other's plates. Or rather, Malfoy keeps stealing. Potter just lets him be and even gives him the last piece of his sausage. Malfoy takes it, with a huff as if he hasn't eaten Potter's food before and the Gryffindor looks pleased. You can't seem to figure out, what they are to each other because they don't seem like your normal rivals.
"Please, Pansy, let me fix it," Harry pleaded, "I'll do anything you want, just let me talk to him."
"Harry Potter, Defense," he says shortly and you are not sure, if that's his thing or if he's rude. McGonagall doesn't say anything, so you decide to let it slide.
He wasn't supposed to wake up left behind in an empty and cold bed. The sheets tangled with him and him alone, the other side almost tidy in comparison.
"Why?" Draco finds himself asking. Harry looks ahead and pretends, he didn't hear him ask. But Draco is persistent and asks until Harry tugs him into the common room. He is glad, it's unoccupied.
"And you really can't help me?" he asks, glancing between his best friends back and forth and Ron has the nerve to look
"You know better than that, Draco," she said and sounded disappointed.
The god of sadness asks quietly and understanding the deep meaning of that question the other gasps.
Harry's smile could have ignited London, that's how bright it was shining.
"Did they say, who they were?"
Harry thought of Ron's words and nodded. Draco needed to see Harry's misery with the situation. It killed him to feel like he was the only one doing something in this relationship. He needed Draco to understand his part.
"Now let's see, how he takes Judas," Potter said and that was the point he wished, he died in the war instead.
"You can't say his name still, huh?" Any other wizard and it would sound like a jest, but Draco knows because it's Harry, it's not.
for it," he spit out, but it sounds fond. Potter touched his cheek, making it impossible to turn away.
Harry took two of his friends. If not for the breakup (because let's face it, that's what it was), then Draco resented him for that.
"A boy then?" he asks and Harry looks startled. It had surprised him to get a love letter in Parseltongue, so he had forgotten about that important detail. Hermione looks at him, calculating.
The mind healer said, it was good to feel good about progress. That he should remember this feeling, as proof how far he came.
"What are you doing, Mr. Malfoy?" Professor McGonagall asks then with an amused frown. Draco steps away from the walls at once, somehow embarrassed. He hides his hands behind his back, the warmth of the castle lingering on them.
The pain was nothing new to him, he was hit with Crutiatus twice and nothing Potter was doing really reached that agonizing level of pain. Potter didn't even use spells, just
Now Draco was confused. This should be their first meeting. He would remember talking to the crown prince, wouldn't he?
So Potter hadn't come down in days. That fact itself was great. That meant no pain, no torture, no manic laugher, and no stories of war either. Those were all good arguments, why he should be glad, that Potter stayed away.
"No, he will just overthink it and he won't talk to me later. It has to be now," Harry said resolutely and drowned the glass of water. "Wish me luck."
"May I have this dance, Lord Malfoy?" Prince Harold asked, a smirk adoring his handsome face. Draco blinked several times, leaving Harold waiting longer than proper. The Prince's smirk softened at Draco's hesitance.
The other gods both yell and the god of happiness just smiles.
"I don't know. He doesn't seem that interested, you know?" Harry says and he looks so sad, that Draco wants to hug him. Stupid boy. Who was dumb enough to let a chance to be with Harry Potter waste away? He curses Harry's crush in his mind, burying him six feet under.
"There's a lot of screaming, crying, pleading, anger and fear. It's interesting to see all these emotions come together so quickly. I always try to break my record of how fast I can make them cry. No more than ten seconds, tops," he bragged and Draco nodded, intrigued.
"If you prefer to be called something else, that is also acceptable," McGonagall says and turns to walk to the castle, "At least if it makes you an authoritative. First names are not allowed, no matter what Harry says."
"Sure," Zabini gets ahold of himself and straightens his clothes, "let's give you a chance, Potter. I'll tell him, what you said today." Harry's eyes widen in surprise. He can't believe his luck! The key just agreed to open the door! Harry sighs in relief.
"Yes?" he asked amused, but the man didn't seem to have any plans to answer him as he crocked his neck to glance in the apartment. Harry scowled and attempted to close the door further, but a foot stopped him.
"Well, you have three minutes until curfew. I'll suggest, you hurry up, Mr. Potter," he drawls, and Harry winces and curses himself for staying out so late. Hermione would have his head if he would lose house points for his tardiness. Snape follows Harry's back with his eyes for some time until he turns around the corner and left the dungeons. He cast a quick Tempus, noting with satisfaction, that he finished his rounds for today and left for his own quarters with something like a leap in his walk.
And when Potter laughed he really knew, that he was fucked. And somehow this discovery hurt him more than the first.
"Is this about Voldemort?" he asked straight out and Ron glared at him.
letter and that the sender only wanted
You turn back to Longbottom, finding him staring at you instead. You flinch unintentionally, but he shrugs it off.
He would bring Draco Malfoy happiness, he decided and plans his further actions.
"Malfoy is a Death Eater?" You can hardly believe, that he's allowed to teach children, even if he's been a student here before. You've read all about Death Eaters and Voldemort of course. It came up in your Harry Potter studies. The cruelty and terror they disseminated and all the deaths, injuries, and maulings they were responsible for. The Malfoy name came up then too, but you assumed it was about Malfoy's father, Lucius. You never knew that Malfoy had been involved. Longbottom seems to know, what you're thinking because his eyes harden.
The burden he had to carry was lifted from his shoulders, the madman out of his home. Why he never left his mind and dreams, Draco didn't understand.
"He confronted me. He thought I was the secret admirer. He grabbed me, wanted me to speak Parseltongue, but I refused and he just... connected the dots, I guess. He doesn't know, it's you, Draco, but I think he expects it. He wanted me to tell you something," he explains but best friend's eyes stayed locked on his lips as if he's scared he's gonna miss something if he doesn't look.
The god of love nods enthusiastically, but the god of friendship doesn't look convinced.
"He'll appreciate, that you worry. But he won't appreciate your meddling. It's alright Granger. He will live without you there to motherhen him," Draco sneered again, but morphed his expression into something pleasant when he saw Harry enter the pub. He waved him to come over and blushed at the shiny smile Harry graced him with. Draco would never tire of that smile.
"Mate, calm down." Potter tries, but Weasley just glares at him angrily.
So he really couldn't tell, how long he had been here. By Potter's tenth visit he gave up hope, that he would be found alive. Potter didn't seem nearly done, but he also showed no sign of hurry or distress, so nobody must have reported him missing. Not for the first time he bemoaned his stupid decision to refuse his Mother's weekly visits. She would have noticed his absence.
Having an older sister was tough on many levels. The management of the household, the title of Count Malfoy and all the responsibilities that name brought with would befall to him, despite being a year younger. That was one of the reasons he had been introduced to society much sooner than his older sister. Today marked her first ball, an event organised by royalty. Prince Harold was coming of age just like Lyra did and King James and Queen Lily were anxious to find a bride for him. Other children of Prince Harold's age normally already were promised to someone since birth. Old families always wedded with each other, contracts were written by grandparents for their grandchildren. The royal family, or rather Prince Harold was the exception.
"You are my husband. I love you. I will never leave you," Draco promised and Harry smiled as he believed him.
He took that offer after the tenth month.
"Well, we're still on each other's throats. In more that one way," he said and took a sip. Hermione didn't seem to appreciate his humor, so his mood sobered a bit.
"Be careful with it, alright?" And then she took off.
"Yes," you only say and Potter frowns at your rudeness. But that's hardly fair! The other man was rude first!
Pansy hold onto her promise and somehow got Blaise out of the room they were consoling Draco in.
Pansy glanced at him out of the corner of her eye and regarded him in heavy silence. Harry couldn't bear her glare and looked down. But then she sniffed haughtily. "Fine."
"Follow me, Professor. I'll show you your quarters," she says and so you do just that.
He almost scoffed.
"I don't have to prove anything to you, Potter! I don't speak it and that is it!" he snarls and Harry mirrors his expression.
"It's a new beginning. We should celebrate," she announces one day at supper and the students begin to whisper and plan.
He went in and out of the basement. Sometimes he would play loud music and asked Draco later, how much he'd been able to hear. He asked until Draco said, that he wasn't able to hear anything and Harry deemed the room ready enough to show him.
"Relax," he whispered, "I won't let you fall."
"Someday it will get easier," Harry promises and looks over all those trees. But he's not watching the scenery. He's remembering everything, that happened here. He died there. And he came back to life. Draco's mother saved him. They fought. They've won. But at what price?
"Yes, of course," he assures.
Harry's first meeting with Draco was rather unconventional.
"He said, he didn't feel confident, that I would understand his feelings." Hemione lifts one eyebrow in question. "Understand, not return?" she asks and Harry nods. She puts her head in her hand and chews on her pencil. She is thinking hard and Harry's heart warms at her enthusiasm.
"Of course! Weasley is a military family, the oldest son was knighted when he was sixteen, despite born in the slums," she sneered, looked around and then spoke a bit softer, "They have more children than they could feed. Despicable family, really."
"You're welcome," Harold said before adding, "You wouldn't mind a second, would you? A dance, that is."
"How?" Pince asks and the student scowls.
"You're biased, Ron," Harry growled, "Even if you never spoke it out loud, you never really approved of Draco. I thought you two were civil, but..." he glared at Ron, "You never stopped antagonizing him whenever I wasn't there, right? And he never told me, because he wanted to make
And then Draco's manners kicked in and he stood awkwardly, leaving the book by his side.
The god of death nods then, content.
"I don't know, Harry. We can only wait and see," he says and even to his ears, he doesn't sound reassuring, so he continues, "but I know, that every day, that you are my friend, it gets easier. Today it's less painful than yesterday. And tomorrow will be even better," he says and looks at Harry. His face is red and his nose is running, but he's listening. His eyes are sparkling in a wonderful deep green and Draco is smitten.
He knocked on Draco's door three times before an angry Pansy Parkinson hissed in his face.
"Yes, I heard there was quite a rivalry. It's good to see them on such good terms after all that," you continue, and Longbottom smiles, while looking at Malfoy and Potter argue over pancakes. His eyes are soft and you smell history there.
the god of sadness said,
"You already did," he said and Malfoy pressed a light kiss on his forehead.
"He's hurting you like he's hurting me," he said and Malfoy nodded very slowly and continued watching him carefully.
And it is safe to say, that he has never been happier when he sees two names on that list.
The god of friendship yells and the god of love looks like he could fight them again.
"But everyone would be horrified to hear about how you got it, right?" And you make a show to gesture to the whole Great Hall.
"It seems, my dove went and did something unnecessary," Potter said and he wanted to spit on him, demand for him to free Malfoy, but Potter didn't look angry. He realized that he hadn't seen Potter angry yet. He was always enjoying himself, patiently, but he was never annoyed.
She says and hands him his new list. He pretends to be nonchalant about it, but he can't wait to open it.
the god of death says, almost amused and the god of happiness musters him. His colleague was a feisty one and he never wanted to fight with him. He kept his thoughts about him to himself and the god of death appreciated the silence.
"Good morning, children, Professor," she answers and Potter says goodbye to the students and walks over. You try and miserably fail to close your mouth. He's even more handsome than the pictures in the
"What are your intentions with Harry, Malfoy?" she asked and Draco bit back a smirk.
"You're right, I don't," Harry said honestly, even if it hurt, "but I will work hard to deserve it again."
Harry just watches the flames, as Draco's head falls on his shoulder. He goes stiff and wonders, what he did to deserve this. He turns his head and takes a peek at Draco's face and he looks exhausted. His family is worrying him, Harry knows. Draco carries a huge responsibility, but he is still so young. He wants to speak with his mother, he told Harry, but the Aurors won't let him. Harry tried to reason with them, but they would not relent. Draco is taking it hard, Harry notices.
"I love you," Harry had whispered as he carried him around. Because he was clingy after sex and Draco enjoyed that too. There was nothing about Harry, he didn't enjoy.
He swears, he never enjoyed a story of happiness this much. He is not surprised to find tears running down his face. The god makes no attempt to wish them away. He lets them wander freely, as he watches the two humans fly, holding each other's hand. And Draco, the god decided to call him now, looks so genuinely
"So I've heard what you did," you say, rather conversationally and he spares you a look, before turning to the Sorting again.
Harry winced. He had thrown Pansy under the bus, but maybe Draco would forgive her if he clarified things.
at the same time. He looked around him and breathed in relief as he couldn't see Malfoy.
He promises his brother and the god of sadness looks wistful.
"Lord Malfoy, with Lady and Miss Malfoy," he announced himself at the desk, where they had to give their invitations.
"Of course not, son. Lyra is a beautiful, educated and outspoken young lady. She's more than capable of charming that Prince."
"I'm so nervous," she said.
The god of love hisses and the god of happiness can feel him getting tense again. He lays a hand on top of his to calm him.
"Yes," he said and was silent after that. Draco waited a moment, but when it became clear, that Harry didn't plan to add something, he nodded.
"I lived practically my whole life in the Forbidden Forest," he states and Hagrid can't argue with that.
"None of your business. And now hurry up, I want to get to bed before midnight."
You and the Headmistress are greeted by several students, who came early this year. You bite back the cooeing at the second years. They are all so tiny and innocent.
"Do try to get along. I will try to stop this ridiculous feud between the houses. I hope, that you will show an example to every other Gryffindor and Slytherin, Mr. Malfoy." Draco tries to suppress a snort. No Slytherin would actually try to get along with Gryffindors. Not after the last Headmaster blatantly favored the red house. Potter was the Child of Wonder, the Boy Who Lived (well, twice now, but who's counting) and Draco had a strong presumption, that Dumbledore was secretly in love with Potter. That was really the only reasonable explanation Draco could come up with.
"No, not really," Harry gritted out and punched the cushion, "He broke up with me."
"A pleasure. May I say Harry?" you ask with a flirty smile, a bit startled when he takes his hand back abruptly.
"Of course, Harry! Can you write the letter on normal parchment? We can analyze it better then," she says and Harry's tempted to say yes. But then he remembers, that it's
"Oh, and I think he's pretty confident in his everyday life. Or sure of himself. He pretty much admitted that he was selfish for trying to stay in my memory, even if he didn't tell me, who he is," he says and Hermione writes everything down. She puts the pencil back in her mouth and chews on the top of it. Harry catches Ron looking at her softly and briefly wonders, why he hasn't asked her out yet. He nudges Ron with his elbow and Ron hisses in confusion.
"I'll come back," he promised and left.
"Will you quit stalling if I tell you?" he asks restless and Draco smirks. "Possibly."
was pretty good for your age. In the end, your mother insisted and you finished school in America. But Hogwarts was still your home and the castle stood magnificent, housing hundreds of children, once again heaven of safety.
"Of course, however you want, love."
And now Draco was blushing. Prince Harold was showing so much interest in him, it was uncomfortable.
"Hush, I don't mean you," he says and Potter looks at him like he lost his mind.
He didn't know, what he made Potter pick him, but he regretted it.
For a few days, he thinks about the things McGonagall said to him. Apologizing was still no option. He feared rejection and mockery to much to do that right now.
"This map is not to fall into the hands of children," she warns you, and you nod, trying not to snap back that you know how to be responsible. Your entrance wasn't as grateful as you hoped it to be, so you must take what you can.
The god of happiness nods.
Arrived, he greeted her with a simple nod and shrugged of his coat and hat.
"Oh yes, I'm sure of that," Draco sneered, "but I haven't seen you in almost a month now. Today was supposed to be our day."
"Who's it from?" Hermione asks and Harry turns the letter but is disappointed to see it blank. There is no sender address, just his name on the front. Hermione frowns.
"Feisty, are we?" And continued having his fun. He endured it, clenching his teeth, refusing to scream. The longer it went on, the more frustrated Potter seemed to get.
"The Prince?" Draco squeaked surprised, "Surely you jest, Mother!"
Hesitantly she grabbed his other hand.
"It's Granger-Weasley actually," she snipped and Draco rolled his eyes. Trust her to be still as annoying as in school.
"Yes, well, Granger has not spoken to me since last year, so her information might be outdated," he sneered. God, that felt good. The mind healer said that he should voice his anger to those, who inflicted it and Draco was inclined to believe him now. It was nothing but truth and talking with others like it was not
